Season 2

**Episode 1**

    [Mary Alice Young]: It was an accepted fact among the residents of Wisteria Lane that Ida Greenberg liked her liquor. People had seen her drunk at sewing bees... the department of motor vehicles... and the first methodist church. Ida had tried to quit drinking many times, but she couldn't. Then one night in a moment of despair, she challenged god to quench her never-ending thirst. Luckily for Ida, God was listening. It was at that moment it occurred to Ida God may work in mysterious ways, but he isn't particularly subtle. It had been a year since my death, and a lot had changed on Wisteria Lane. children had learned new games. New neighbors had moved in. Old houses had been rebuilt... And fresh tragedies had occurred. In one house, a widow was getting ready to tell her friends of her husband's passing. But until the time was right, she would wait. And life,as it tends to do, would go on.

    [Mary Alice Young]: It had been one year since my suicide... makes you wonder,doesn't it? And a lot had changed on Wisteria Lane. There were new flowers, new houses and new neighbors-- the kind anyone would want living right next door. It really is a lovely gesture.

**Episode 2**

    [Mary Alice Young]: The remarkable thing about Danny Farrell was that he had only been a paperboy for 6 months, and in that time he had become the enemy of every woman on Wisteria Lane. If there was a puddle on someone's property, he found it. If a new rosebush had just been planted, he destroyed it. If a cat was enjoying a moment in the sun, he ended it. People wondered if Danny would ever change. They should have talked to Susan Meyer. She could have told them: obnoxiuos boys tend to become obnoxious men. Just like the one she had been married to. Yes, the women of Wisteria Lane believed Danny Farrell to be the enemy. They also believed: The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Beautiful lawns, spacious homes, happy families. These are the hallmarks of suburbia. But if you look beneath the veneer of gracious living, you will see a battle raging. A battle for control. You see the combattants everywhere, engaged in their routine skirmishes, fighting fiercely to have dominion over the world around them, all the while knowing it's a battle they will lose.

    [Mary Alice Young]: Control. It's extraordinary the tactics people employ to obtain it. Some rely on deception, while others engage in outright trickery. Then there are those who resort to extorsion. Why do we fight so hard for control? Because we know: To lose it is to put our fate in the hands of others. And what could be more dangerous?

**Episode 3**

    [Mary Alice Young]: Over the years, bree van de kamp had grown increasingly concerned over her mother-in-law's forgetfulness. Her lapses had become more frequent... More glaring... And more dangerous. Yes, bree was worried about phyllis' faulty memory, but she was more than happy to remind her, especially when it came to the important things. It was in that moment bree could finally see the truth. Her mother-in-law's memory was fine. It was her soul that was faulty. The parties took place on the front lawn of 4347 wisteria lane every sunday afternoon. Chloe pendergast would bring the tea set, which was appropriate, since she was the hostess. Brittany chries provided formal attire from her mother's closet. And marissa anne mckay invited the additional guests, some of whom hadn't been to a party in years. Of course, it never occurred to the three young girls that while they were busy playing out their fantasy, one of the older girls in the neighborhood was engaging in a fantasy of her own. There was nothing gabrielle enjoyed as much as shopping. And even when she couldn't afford to take anything home, she took satisfaction in looking... at the merchandise.

    [Mary Alice Young]: Everyone enjoys a game of make-believe now and then. Of course, the ways in which we play can vary greatly. Sometimes we tell ourselves work won't interfere with our family life. Sometimes, we imagine certain relationships to be more meaningful than they really are. Occasionally, we put on a show, as if to convince ourselves our secrets aren't really all that terrible. Yes,the game of make-believe is a simple one. You start by lying to yourself... And if you can get others to believe those lies... you win.

**Episode 4**

    [Mary Alice Young]: The residents of the fairview county jail looked forward to every tuesday. That was the day that gabrielle solis came to visit her husband. The inmates went out of their way to give her compliments whether she wanted them to or not. With each visit,these accolades became increasingly inventive. Still,gabrielle was not flattered. In fact,gabrielle started to dread this special attention. Until one day,when... It was at that moment it occurred to gabrielle... This was the nicest compliment she had ever received. There was one thing all the fathers on wisteria lane had in common-- they could return home from a hard day's work to the family they'd left behind and not feel at all guilty about the precious moments they had missed. Sadly,the same could not be said for the working mothers.

    [Mary Alice Young]: The world is filled with good fathers. How do we recognize them? They're the ones who are missed so terribly that everything falls apart in their absence. They're the ones who love us long before we've even arrived. They're the ones who come looking for us when we can't find our way home. Yes,the world is filled with good fathers... And the best are the ones who make the women in their lives... Feel like good mothers.

**Episode 5**

    [Mary Alice Young]: Since her first day on the job, it had been clear to lynette scavo that her new boss nina was unusually tense. To help relieve her tension, lynette tried giving her boss thoughtful gifts-- a soothing wave machine... aromatherapy candles... even meditative chi balls. But nothing seemed to ease nina's tension. Until one day when it occurred to lynette there was one form of relaxation she had yet to try. And although it had come about in an unexpected manner... Nina's tension had finally been released... the old-fashioned way. Everyone in this world needs someone they can depend upon, be it a faithful companion, trusted confidant... or loyal friend. For susan mayer,that dependable someone was her book agent lonny moon. It was lonny who helped susan promote her first children's book. It was lonny who rushed susan to the hospital the night julie was born. It was lonny who took susan's mind off her painful divorce with a fun vacation. Yes,lonny was susan's rock. Sadly for susan, her rock was about to crumble.

    [Mary Alice Young]: Everyone in the world needs someone they can depend on, be they faithful friends, determined advocates... or a loving family. But occasionally in life, the people we thought would always be there for us leave. And if that happens, it's amazing the lengths we'll go to... to get them back.

**Episode 6**

    [Mary Alice Young]: George Williams had never been lucky in love. It seemed that the women he dated always invented reasons not to consummate their relationship. Um... I'm afraid we'd wake my roommate. Uh, I have to get up really early for work. I'm, uh -- saving myself -- for -- marriage. Sadly for George, it was one unoriginal excuse after another. But since he'd started seeing Bree Van De Kamp, George couldn't help but feel: His luck was about to change. Though painful to hear, George had to admit: At least this excuse was original. It's a fad that little girls dream of big white weddings. Of course, the exact same thing can be said for big girls, some of whom can get incredibly anxious waiting for the boys in their lives to make those dreams come true. Weeds are a common annoyance of life in Suburbia; and no matter how hard we try to get rid of them, they always tend to crop back up.

    [Mary Alice Young]: Yes, every little girl dreams of a big white wedding. But some dreams just don't come true.

**Episode 7**

    [Mary Alice Young]: It is often said that Necessity is the mother of Invention. This is how mothers came to invent play dates, so occasionally they could have a little time for themselves. But there are some mothers who don't get to take advantage of this maternal innovation. Mothers like -- Lynette Scavo, who was no longer able to rest on weekends because her twins no longer received play date invitations ever since they had convinced Sasha Eden's boy that a pair of magic wings would allow him to fly; and they had double-dared Sharon Chasen's boy to ride his bike blindfolded; and they had encouraged Lisa Seedman's boy to try an exciting new game called "Toss The Brick". The Scavo twins had become personae non gratae, and Lynette's secret dream of being able to take an occasional nap on Saturdays was growing dimmer and dimmer. Until one day -- And that's how Lynette finally got what she needed: time for herself. And play dates for her kids. Play dates she was determined to keep... at all costs. Cameras are simple tools designed to capture images. Images that tell us more about ourselves than we realize. They remind us of the long journey we've taken; the loved ones who travelled alongside us; those we lost along the way -- and those waiting for us on the road ahead.

    [Mary Alice Young]: Yes, cameras are tools designed to capture images. But in truth, they can capture so much more. They can uncover hidden longing of men who should no longer care. They can reveal the extraordinary secrets of the most ordinary marriages. Most amazing of all, cameras can quietly and clearly reveal to us our dreams. Dreams we didn't even know we had.

**Episode 8**

    [Mary Alice Young]: Betty Applewhite was a gifted woman. Everyone had always said so, ever since she was a child. Her first piano teacher praised her dexterity. Her first college professor applauded her sense of rhythm. Her first symphony conductor hailed her dramatic flair. But Betty was no longer a concert pianist. She was now just a woman with a secret .. one she was determined to keep by any means necessary. Yes, Betty Applewhite was a gifted woman. And the greatest of all her gifts was her timing. Once they've suffered a miscarriage, some women sit alone in the dark for hours. They refuse to go out in the light of day, afraid to face the possibility that life will go on. They hold on to reminders of their unborn child and dream of what might have been. Yes, this is how some women react when they've suffered such a loss. Gabrielle Solis was not one of those women.

    [Mary Alice Young]: In a world filled with darkness, we all need some kind of light. Whether it's a great flame that shows us how to win back what we've lost, or a powerful beacon intended to scare away potential monsters, or a few glowing bulbs that reveal to us the hidden truth of our past. We all need something to help us get through the night. Even if it's just the tiniest glimmer.. of hope.

**Episode 9**

    [Mary Alice Young]: Anyone who'd ever been to a party of Bree van de Kamp's thought of her as the perfect hostes Because Bree knew how to take care of her guests Her dinners will always served properly Her licer always flow freely And her anicdotes were always enjoyable But on this night, the perfect hostess was about to find herself... in a very imperfect predicament. yes, Bree knew how to take care of her guests, especially those who weren't invited. Good guys wear white hats, and bad guys wear black. This is how children distinguish between good and evil. But they soon learn that bad guys don't always look so bad. In fact, sometimes they even seem down right friendly. That is, until you get to know them a little bit better.

    [Mary Alice Young]: It's not always that easy to distinguish the good guys from the bad guys. Sinners can surprise you. And the same is true for saints. Why do we try to define people as simply good or simply evil? Because no one wants to admit that compassion and cruelty can live side by side in one heart... and that anyone is capable of anything.

**Episode 10**

    [Mary Alice Young]: There were many ways to tell Bree van de kamp was a lady. She was courteous to those around her, she moved with elegance and grace and she was very careful to never let others know what she was thinking. You see,like most well-bred women... Bree had something to hide. Yes,there were many ways to tell that bree was a lady, but the surest was to watch how she maintained her dignity in even the most undignified of situations. It's a story as old as time itself-- the return of the prodigal son. And no matter how many times it's repeated... or how the details might vary... or how the names might change... the story always ends the same way... in the tender embrace of a loving father.

    [Mary Alice Young]: The stories are as old as time itself... the prodigal son who returns home to the father who forgives him... the jealous wife who tricks the husband who trust her... the desperate mother who risks everything for the child who needs her and the faithless husband who hurts the wife who loves him so deeply. Why do we listen again and again? Because these are the stories of family, and once we look past the fighting, pain and the resentment, we occasionally like to remind ourselves... There is absolutely nothing more important.

**Episode 11**

    [Mary Alice Young]: Kisses are such simple things, we hardly notice them. But if we paid more attention, we'd see that each kiss conveys a meaning all its own. For example, some can say, "I'm so happy to see you." Or, "I didn't realize you'd be here." Or, "honey, it's time to stop drinking." The trick is in knowing how to tell the difference. Yes, kisses mean different things to different people. Ultimately, the meaning depends on the one who does the kissing... And the who sees it happen. After every party comes the time for cleaning. We attend to the champagne that was spilled, the knickknacks that got broken, the food that went uneaten. And whatever other messes need cleaning up.

    [Mary Alice Young]: The act itself never varies, but each kiss carries a with it a meaning all it's own. It can convey a husband's eternal devotion or a wife's enormous regret. It can symbolize a mother's growing concern or a lover's growing passion, but whatever its meaning each kiss reflects a basic human need. The needs to connect to another human being. This desire is so strong it's always amazing when some people dont understand it.

They were growing increasingly concerned that their street was infected with a dangerous kind of sickness. And they came to consult with one another about a possible cure.

    [Mary Alice Young]: illness can take on many forms those of the body are easy to treat Much more difficult are the hidden maladies festering in our hearts the secret diction that consume our soul and the disease we deny which affect our judgement To survive we need to find that special someone who can heal us But we can never predict who have the cure for what ills us or when they'll show up

    [Mary Alice Young]: If there is one thing Eddie Brit understood,it was nature of war after two fail marriages and countless rocky romances She had learned love was a battle field it is the easiest way to survive the carnage was total surrender but the day comes for every assaulter when she must take a stand and fight You see when it came to man,Eddie had a battle plan of her own yes,eddie brit understood the nature of war She also know to the victor go the spoils. the guest bedroom on the second floor of Whiteapples' house had the best view in all misteria lane from it's windows one could see Mike Delfino's house one down the street all the way to old huber's place one on the other but unfortunately for the room's newest guest the view is about to change,dramatically.

[Mary Alice Young]: Everyone understands the nature of war. We also understand that victory depends on the cards that we have been dealt. Some,when faced with a bloody battle, simply give in. But for some,surrender is unacceptable. Even though they know it will be a fight... to the death.

Bree intended to prove it. But Bree could you see, for her the proof was in the pudding. The world is filled with unlikely friendships Odd pairings that to the casual observer make absolutely no sense at all But if we look closer, we can see why these alliances formed After all, a shared purpose can give even mortal enemies common ground.

    [Mary Alice Young]: The world is filled with unlikely friendships. How do they begin? With one person desperately in need, and another willing to lend a helping hand. When such kindness is offered... We're finally able to see the worth of those we had previously written off. And before we know it... a bond has formed, regardless of whether others can understand it. Yes, unlikely friendships start up every day. No one understands this more than the lonely. In fact, it's what they count on.

He predicted the advent of the $3 cup of coffee. He even anticipated the surprising boom in bottled water. but the crystal ball that served Paul so well in the stock market sometimes failed him closer to home. Yes, in the world of investments, my husband had a remarkable ability to see the future. But sadly, Paul didn't see this one coming at all.

    [Mary Alice Young]: gabrielle solis had always been a demanding shopper. and whatever the purchase, she always expected the very best. whether it was exotic perfume shipd over from paris... a high fashion gown straight from a runway in milan... or designer shoes flown in from manhattan, but on this day, her expectations were going to be put to the test. you see, gabrielle was now shopping for a baby, and there was a problem... with the manufacturer. yes, gabrielle had always been a demanding shopper. because she knew there are some purchases... that can't be returned. at 6:10 the next morning, deana pruse went into premature labor d gave birth to what would t tually be an incredibly attractive baby boy. at 11:43, dr. hanson mills cut the umbilical cord, forever separating mother and child. at that exact same moment, dr. ron mccready entered the private room of susan mayer with every intention of severing their connection.

    [Mary Alice Young]: at that precise moment, as dr. hanson mills was cutting yet another umbilical cord, other ties were being severed all over town... like the one between a child and the mother who didn't want him to grow up so quickly... or the one between a case of fine wine and the housewife who hadn't wanted to admit that she had a problem... or the one between a woman and the boyfriend who couldn't forgive her betrayal. the choice to separate from what we love is painful... the only thing worse... is when meone we've trusted makes the choice for us.

**Episode 18**

    [Mary Alice Young]: On her first day of sobriety, Bree van de Kamp found an old cork, which reminded her just how much she craved Chablis. So she called her sponsor, who came over with a DVD which they watched till her craving had passed. Five days later, after she developed a thirst for Merlot, Peter arrived with a deck of cards. The next week, he brought over chinese takeout because Bree had told him she was consumed by thoughts of vintage Chardonnay. By her 20th day of sobriety, Bree had stopped thinking because her thoughts re now centered elsewhere. Though she didn't know it, Bree had answered her own question. The easiest way to overcome one addiction... is to replace it with another. Temptation... it's the name of a well-known establishment on the outskirts of fairview. Its clientele is devoted. Everyone who goes there wants to get their hands on something. And when they cross a line... They are punished... as a certain married couple were about to discover.

    [Mary Alice Young]: Temptation comes to all of us. Whether or not we succumb depends on our ability to recognize its disguise. Sometimes it arrives in the form of an old flame, flickering back to life. Or a new friend who could end up being so much more. Or a young child who awakens feelings we didn't know we had. And so we give in to temptation, all the while knowing come morning, we'll have to suffer the consequences.

For show and tell,timmy decidedto bring in something from your husband's collection of nazi memorabilia. Billy's been threateningto beat up the other kids for their milk money. We found the proceedsin his cubby. Of course,mrs. Pate also knew when it came to unruly children, some parents had more reason to be ashamed... than others. Yes,louisa pate believed in the power of shame. She always believed,when someone has that power... It's a shame not to use it. It had been six weeks since andrew van de kamp had declared war on his mother bree. The final battle was about to be waged at the fairview county courthouse. Bree knew it was about to get bloody. What she didn't know was... the calvary was on its way... Whether she wanted them there or not.

    [Mary Alice Young]: there is a prayer intended to give strength to people faced with circumstances they don't want to accept. the power of the prayer comes from its insight into human nature... we ask god to grant us the serenity to accept the things we cannot change... because so many of us rage against the hand that life has dealt us... the courage to change the things we can... because so many of us are cowardly and afraid to stand up for what is right... and the wisdom to know the difference. because so many of us give in to despair... when faced with an impossible choice. the good news for those who utter these words is that god will hear you and answer your prayer. the bad news is that sometimes the answer is no.

**Episode 20**

    [Mary Alice Young]: karl mayer didn't pray often, but when he did, it was usually to ask for god's help in breaking up with a woman and to spare him the nasty drama that usually accompanied such callous and unexpected departures. over the years, karl had dumped dozens of women, and not one of them had ever seen it coming. every retreat was always meticulously planned, right down to the personalized stationary, hence his record of successful getaways from women who did not want to see him go. so when he decided to break up with edie britt, karl prayed to god yet again to help him avoid all the unnecessary drama. unfortunately for karl... god was in the mood... to be entertained. as he sat there, karl couldn't help but wonder why god had forsaken him. it never occurred to him that god... might be a woman. god, grant me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change, the courage to change the things i can and the wisdom to know the difference... the members of the fairview chapter of a.a. ended every meeting with a prayer. and while most were asking god for help in resisting temptation, was busy thinking thoughts that were downright sinful.

    [Mary Alice Young]: it's a shocking moment for each of us, that moment we realize we are all alone in this world. The family we take for granted could one day abandon us. The husband we trust so implicitly might betray us... the daughter we love so deeply perhaps won't return to us. And then we could end up all by ourselves. Of course, some see great value in going it alone.

    [Mary Alice Young]: the most successful private investigator in fairview was a man named oliver weston. Try though he might, oliver couldn't remember the exact moment he stopped believing in love. Was it the night he caught an executive cheating with his secretary? or was it the day he saw a housewife cheating with her delivery boy? or was it the time he caught the girl next door cheating with the couple who lived across the street? whenever the moment, oliver weston was now officially a cynic who only believed in betrayal and suspicion. Luckily for oliver, that's what paid his bills. Yes,oliver weston had become a cynic, which is why he cldn't recognize a man who was still in love. Every family has a way of hiding what it doesn't want seen... whether it's with a picture that covers a stain on the wall... orith a closet door that conceals the chaos inside... or with artificial smiles that mask years of pain and heartache, every family goes to great lengths to hide ugly truths. Some,of course, go further than others.

But there is redemption if we try to learn from those mistakes...

**Episode 22**

    [Mary Alice Young]: susan mayer had always believed the one good thing about hard times is that you get to find out who your friends really are. When her grandmother died, it was bree who brought homemade cookies. When the critics panned her third book, it was gabrielle who hired the handsome masseur. When her divorce became final, it was lynette who poured the scotch. Sadly, susan's life had been shattered once again... but as always, her friends had come to help pick up the pieces. Yes, hard times were what susan used to distinguish who was a friend and who wasn'T. Not everyone enjoys being a small part of a large community. Indeed, some yearn to leave the stress and noise of constant companionship behind them so they strike out on their own, hoping their solitude will bring a little peace and quiet. It's only then they discover how dangerous it is... to be alone in the world.

    [Mary Alice Young]: When the truth is ugly, people try to keep it hidden, because they know if revealed, the damage it will do. So they conceal it within sturdy walls... or they place it behind closed doors... or they obscure it with clever disguises... but truth,no matter how ugly, always emerges... and someone we care about always ends up getting hurt... and someone else will revel in their pain, and that's the ugliest truth of all.

**Episode 23**

    [Mary Alice Young]: It's a fact of life in every neighborhood: People move in, and people move out. Although very few of them pack up and leave at 2am. But it wasn't the first time that Betty Applewhite had tried to leave in the middle of the night. It had happened once before, in Chicago. The same night one of her sons tried to break up with his girlfriend,... a young woman named Melanie Foster. Yes, a year had come and gone since the Applewhites had left Chicago. And Betty thought they could again slip away in the middle of the night. But as she soon discovered, it's not that easy to slip away in the suburbs. Because in Suburbia, once the neighbors hear you going, they all insist on showing up to say goodbye. Everyone must choose the road they will take in life. And for a special few, that road would lead to Wisteria Lane. They all arrive the exact same way: driving up in their overloaded trucks, bringing with them their expensive antiques and ordinary dreams. I remember the first moment I saw each of them. I met Susan Mayer the day she moved to Wisteria Lane. She seemed to delightfully confident, I couldn't help but feel intimidated. That feeling quickly passed. I met Bree Van De Kamp the first day she moved to Wisteria Lane. there are certain people, who, when you meet them, can't help but make a delightful first impression. Bree was not one of them. we all met Lynette Scavo the day she moved onto Wisteria Lane. we quickly decided she would be our friend, mostly because we were afraid to have her as an enemy. we met Gabrielle Solis the day she moved to Wisteria Lane. we were all excited to get a glimpse of a successful new york model. we saw more... than we bargained for.

    [Mary Alice Young]: This is the street where I used to live... and these were the people with whom I shared my life. I met them the day they moved in. And I saw what they brought with them... beautiful dreams for the future. And quiet hopes for a better life... not just for themselves, but for their children, too. If I could, would I tell them what lies ahead? Would I warn them of the sorrow and betrayal that lie in store? No. From where I stand now, I see enough of the road to understand how it must be traveled. The trip is to keep moving forward, to let go of the fear and the regret that slow us down and keep us from enjoying a journey that will be over too soon. Yes, there will be unexpected bends in the road, shocking surprises we didn't see coming, but that's really the point... don't ya think?
