- `Season 1.txt`, `Season 2.txt`, ...: Extracted monologues for each season.

## Usefulness of These Monologues

The monologues, primarily narrated by the character Mary Alice Young, are a unique storytelling device in "Desperate Housewives." They:

- **Set the Tone:** Each episode begins and ends with a monologue that frames the story, providing insight, foreshadowing, or thematic commentary.
- **Reveal Themes:** The monologues often highlight the central themes of each episode, such as secrets, relationships, morality, and suburban life.
- **Enable Analysis:** By extracting and organizing these monologues, researchers and fans can:
  - Analyze recurring motifs, language, and narrative structure.
  - Study character development and the show's approach to social commentary.
  - Use the text for natural language processing (NLP), sentiment analysis, or machine learning projects.
  - Create visualizations of word usage, sentiment trends, or thematic evolution across seasons.
- **Support Creative Projects:** Writers, educators, and fans can reference these monologues for inspiration, adaptation, or academic work.

## Accuracy and Limitations

The monologues and dialogues have been extracted from subtitle files, which may contain inaccuracies due to transcription errors or formatting issues. Due to the volume of text, AI was used to extract the monologues, and while efforts were made to ensure accuracy, some inconsistencies may remain. Feel free to open an issue or pull request if you notice any errors.
