**Episode 01**

    [Mary Alice Young]: There was a time when my husband and I were very happy. I remember warm summer afternoons and backyard barbecues and laughter with friends. Our life was like some kind of suburban dream. But the day comes when we all must wake up. For me, that day came when a letter arrived. As threats go, it was concise and to the point. I did what I had to to protect my family. My husband found out who wrote the letter. He let her know how much this upset him. Her sister figured out what my husband had done. So she decided to frame him for murder... Her murder, to be more specific. And that's when the dream that was Paul Young's life became a nightmare. Years later, a woman was pulled over for speeding. This woman had no identification, so she was arrested. And that is how people learned that Felicia Tillman was very much alive.
And so my husband returned to Wisteria Lane. The neighbors were surprised to see him. They hadn't thought about Paul Young in years. But he had thought about them. And he was going to make sure they'd never forget him... again.
The phone call that comes in the middle of the night... The letter that arrives by special courier... The e-mail marked "urgent!"... Yes, there are all sorts of ways bad news can be delivered. But some news is so bad... it must be delivered in person.

    [Mary Alice Young]: Bad news travels quickly, and when it arrives, we have to find a way to deal with it. If our husbands tell us they've moved on... we look for projects to distract us. If the bills start to stack up... we find ways to earn extra cash. If we're told a secret too terrible to share... we learn to keep it to ourselves. But we must remember the bad news that's delivered can sometimes be good news... in disguise.

    [Mary Alice Young]: It had been a long time since Bree Van De Kamp was a little girl, but she could still remember everything she'd ever been told about sex.

But no one had ever told her... how to get rid of them.
Yes, when Bree was a little girl, she'd been taught her sexual urges were dangerous. Unfortunately, she was about to learn... those urges were dangerous... for everyone.
The doctors and nurses at Fairview Hospital are experts at healing. They can set bones... bandage wounds... and treat diseases. Sadly, one thing they don't know how to heal is a guilty conscience.

    [Mary Alice Young]: There are certain kinds of pain that can't be treated in a hospital, so those who are suffering do what they can to heal themselves. Some cure the ache of loneliness by making new friends. Some soothe their excruciating guilt with an infusion of cash. Some alleviate their burning desire with small acts of kindness. But sadly, there will always be those who can't begin to heal... because they realize there is more pain yet to come.

Yes, Tom Scavo had been battling depression, but he was now facing a much bigger battle with his wife.
Happiness... it's something we all want, and so we search for it. Little girls find it in the taste of chocolate. Well-dressed men discover it at their local mall. Teenage boys experience it when talking to a pretty girl. And then there are housewives, who simply can't be happy until they've learned everything they can about the newest neighbor on the block.

    [Mary Alice Young]: Happiness... it's something everyone searches for. Some are sure they'll find it once they've moved back home. Some think they'll find it by making a new friend. Some hope to find it once they've defeated the competition. Then there are those who stop searching for happiness because they look up one day to discover... It was right there in front of them all the time.

So Paul decided to get help from someone sure to sympathize with his situation... "Hi. I'm Dr. Gable." Another man.
Yes, Paul Young was frustrated. But even frustrated men... "F.Y.I., until I get some action, it'll be Dutch treat." Have their pride.

    [Mary Alice Young]: Our lives are brief. That's why it's important to search for meaning. We find it in our daughter's smile... in the warmth of our friends... or the comfort of our faith. Then there are those who make their lives meaningful by making a great sacrifice.

Yes, there are certain things every parent must remember. "I'll-I'll... I'll tell her it's dead." Locking the door... is one of them.
It's a question we all ask ourselves. Do I trust the folks who live next door? Can I count on the woman who lives down the block? Will that couple across the street be there when I need them? Yes, good neighbors are people we can rely on. Great neighbors are the ones who do exactly what they are told.

    [Mary Alice Young]: We know what they look like. We know how they dress... and we know how they behave. Yes, we can all recognize the wrong kind of people. And when we see them coming, we do what we have to to protect ourselves.
And with that, my friends went to work trying to stop Paul Young. He knew what they were up to. But he didn't care. He should have. Paul had forgotten what ordinary men and women will do to protect themselves... from the wrong kind of people.
It was just before sunrise on Wisteria Lane... when a cab arrived... and a woman departed. She left the street quietly. But news of her disappearance would soon spread. And the sound would be deafening. But first... a young man in love had plans to make some noise of his own.

But Paul knew it was the sound of revenge.

"If you find out who did it, let me know. I want to send them flowers."
Yes, the police had many suspects in the shooting of Paul Young. But his wife... Had only one.
Yes, Paul Young had enemies. "I can't talk right n." More than he knew.
It's something we need to be reminded of whenever our world has been turned upside down. Come the morning, life goes on. We pull ourselves together and go on shopping sprees... Or reignite a love affair... Or go back to work. Yes, we must remember life will get better... Unless it doesn't.
