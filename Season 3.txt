**Episode 1**

    [Mary Alice Young]: Something awful happened on Lake View Drive last year. To understand why, you need to know that when Alma Hodge awoke that morning, she had no idea this would be the day she'd leave her husband. Certainly, it began normally enough. She put away the groceries per his instructions. She hung his dry cleaning exactly as he had requested. She folded the towels just as he had taught her. It was just before noon... Something inside Alma broke, and she decided it was time... to fly away. Of course, she knew better than to say this to her husband. He thought Alma was happy, and Orson Hodge did not like to be contradicted. So she waited till he left for work, and then... The next day, Carolyn Bigsby stopped by, and like most nosy neighbors, she knew you learned more if you didn't knock. ... Yes, Orson Hodge was a man who did not like to be contradicted... by anyone.
It doesn't rain very often in the town of Fairview, but when it does, it pours. It was on just such a day that Bree Van De Kamp went on her first date with her new friend Orson Hodge. A date that ended with a kiss in the rain. This occurred just as Gabrielle Solis was conferring with her new divorce lawyer, and describing in vivid detail her husband's affair with their maid, who also happened to be their surrogate. Meanwhile... Lynette Scavo was busy meeting her husband's illegitimate daugher. While resisting the urge to strangle the girl's mother. This happened just after Susan Mayer learned Mike Delfino had been badly injured in a hit-and-run accident, and was now in a coma at Fairview Memorial Hospital. At that same moment, Edie Britt was putting up a "for sale" sign on the lawn of the house where I once lived. Edie had also planned to spruce up the property by washing down the driveway. But she was pleased to see the rain had already taken care of that. This is what rainy days are good for. They make everything clean again, which is necessary on a street like Wisteria Lane... where everything can get so messy.

    [Mary Alice Young]: (Mid-episode) Ian Hainsworth had been miserable ever since a tragic horseback riding accident had left his wife Jane in a coma. For the next three years, he shied away from all social contact, because he wanted to be alone with his grief. Then one day, he met Susan Mayer, who, because of her own tragedy, was just as miserable as he was. And a friendship slowly blossomed, because as everyone knows, misery loves company. And Ian was loving this company... more and more every day.

    [Mary Alice Young]: Every storm brings with it hope... that somehow by morning, everything will be made clean again, and even the most troubling stains will have disappeared, like the doubts over his innocence... or the consequence of his mistake. Like the scars of his betrayal... or the memory of his kiss. So we wait for the storm to pass, hoping for the best. Even though we know in our hearts... some stains are so indelible... nothing can wash them away.

**Episode 2**

    [Mary Alice Young]: Brides are sensitive creatures, and no one knows this better than the bridesmaids who have to deal with them. But the one area where a bridesmaid's tact is most required involves the dress... she's required to wear. Yes, a bridesmaid can question many of the bride's choices. But the groom isn't one of them.
The perfect couple... We've all met them, haven't we? That man and woman so clearly made for each other, we feel certain they're on the road to happiness. But that road has many detours, and even perfect couples can find themselves... at a dead end.

    [Mary Alice Young]: Have you met the perfect couple... The two soul mates, whose love never dies? The two lovers, whose relationship is never threatened? The husband and wife, who trust each other completely? If you haven't met the perfect couple, let me introduce you. They stand atop a layer of buttercream frosting. The secret of their success? Well, for starters, They don't have to look at each other.

**Episode 3**

    [Mary Alice Young]: Orson Hodge dreamed of the perfect honeymoon. Indeed, he'd begun planning it the moment Bree Van De Kamp agreed to marry him. They'd start by flying first class, to an exclusive 5-star hotel, where they'd spend their days by the pool, and their nights making love. And when they returned home, their perfect honeymoon would continue... forever.
It was at this moment that Orson realized their honeymoon was over... In more ways than one.
It was a holiday weekend on Wisteria Lane, and everyone was packing their bags, hoping to get away from it all. Lynette was getting away from growing tension in her marriage. Gabrielle was getting away from an increasingly bitter divorce. Susan was getting away from mounting guilt. And then there was Bree, who had just learned there are some problems... You can't run away from.

    [Mary Alice Young]: (Mid-episode) Due to Lynette's sudden departure... Gabrielle was forced to spend the last night of her spa vacation alone, but she didn't mind. In fact, she looked forward to a quiet dinner alone with her thoughts. Unfortunately for Gabrielle, her thoughts quickly turned to her impending divorce, and the empty house she'd soon return to. And she began to resent the happy couples she was seeing... everywhere.

    [Mary Alice Young]: We all carry something with us. Of course, it's nice if we travel with someone who can help lighten the load. But usually, it's easier to just drop what we've been carrying, so we can get home that much sooner... Assuming, of course, there will be someone there to greet us when we arrive. Why do we clutch at this baggage, even when we're desperate to move on? Because we all know there's a chance... we might let go too soon.

**Episode 4**

    [Mary Alice Young]: The day Mike Delfino woke from his coma, Edie Britt was the first to know. Once she was sure he was responsive... Edie decided to share the good news with others. And that is how word began to spread. Mike's physician, Dr. Craig, was busy with a patient when he first heard the news. Not long after, he called his aunt Ida, who was busy knitting a sweater. She told Lynette Scavo, who was busy watering her lawn. And she told her husband Tom, who was busy playing at computer game. He then e-mailed his friend Carlos, Who was busy plotting strategy with his divorce lawyer. And Carlos called his soon-to-be ex-wife Gabrielle, who was busy doing the same with hers. Yes, word of Mike's miraculous recovery spread quickly throughout Wisteria Lane, And stopped cold everyone's busy, busy life... Everyone, that is... Except for Susan Mayer, who was busy doing something she would soon wish... she hadn't.
Edward Sibley was the beloved founder of the town of Fairview. Prior to that, and a horse thief. Of course, no one remembers those parts of Edward's past. Luckily for him, history is designed to be rewritten... And no one knew this better than Bree Hodge.

    [Mary Alice Young]: We all have our reasons for rewriting history. Sometimes we need to provide ourselves alibis... Sometimes we wanna hurt someone who has hurt us... And then there are times we just wanna spare ourselves embarrassment... Of course, there are some who feel that to rewrite history Is just another way to lie... But what is history anyway... But a set of lies agreed upon?

**Episode 5**

    [Mary Alice Young]: THE ART OF SABOTAGE-- IT'S PRACTICED EVERY DAY IN THE SUBURBS. SOMETIMES IT TAKES THE FORM OF A BUNDT CAKE OFFERED TO A FRIEND WHO'S ON A DIET. OTHER TIMES, IT'S A CABLE CUT JUST AS A HUSBAND'S FRIENDS ARRIVE TO WATCH THE BIG GAME. AND THEN THERE'S ALWAYS THAT ANONYMOUS PHONE CALL TO THE CITY ZONING DEPARTMENT. YES, IN SUBURBIA, EVERYONE YOU MEET IS A POTENTIAL SABOTEUR... ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE.
YES, THE ART OF SABOTAGE-- IT'S PRACTICED EVERY DAY IN THE SUBURBS... BUT FEW DO IT AS WELL AS BREE HODGE... OR AS POLITELY.
FAMILY DINNER-- THERE WAS A TIME WHEN THAT PHRASE MEANT SOMETHING ON WISTERIA LANE. OF COURSE, THIS WAS BACK WHEN MEALS WERE LOVINGLY PREPARED... BY WIVES WHO LOVED TO COOK... FOR CHILDREN WHO REMEMBERED THEIR MANNERS. BUT FAMILY DINNERS, LIKE THE TIMES, HAD CHANGED, AND THERE WAS ONLY ONE HOUSE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE DINNER REMAINED A FAMILY OCCASION... AND ATTENDANCE WAS NOT OPTIONAL.

    [Mary Alice Young]: SABOTAGE-- EVERYONE IS CAPABLE OF IT, BUT SOME GO ABOUT IT MORE RUTHLESSLY THAN OTHERS... LIKE THE ONES WHO CRAVE VENGEANCE... OR THE ONES WHO HUNGER FOR LOVE...

**Episode 6**

    [Mary Alice Young]: It is often said that confession is good for the soul. No one knew this better than a certain blonde, who had been confessing her sins to Father O'Malley, once a week since she was a child. As the years had passed, much to Father O'Malley's dismay, a theme began to emerge. And once she had been forgiven, Father O'Malley would tell Edie Britt to go out into the world and sin no more. Unfortunately for Edie, temptation seemed to be... Everywhere.
Yes, it's often said confession is good for the soul. But some confessions are just bragging in disguise.
There was nothing Bree Hodge hated more than an unexpected... knock at the door. She was always certain it would lead to a dagreeable surprise... Whether it be in the form of a cosmetics saleswoman, religious Zealots or extended family. But on this day, the surprise awaiting Bree was far more disagreeable than she ever could have imagined.

    [Mary Alice Young]: There is a place in St. Timothy's church where sinners go to confess their sins. And once they're done, they expect absolution. But the truth is, not all confessions are worthy of such forgiveness. Most who unveil hidden agendas deserve the condemnation they receive. Most who disclose vengeful motives merit the punishment that follows. Only the truly repentant have any right at all to expect a second chance... Which is why it's best to think twice before you confess... Especially if you don't know what it is you're confessing to.

**Episode 7**

    [Mary Alice Young]: FRIDAY It was supposed to be an ordinary day for Carolyn Bigsby. She had planned to bake her husband a strudel, give her dog a bath and water her african violets. Yes, Carolyn had planned to do all sorts of things she thought mattered. But earlier that day, a woman who wasn't her friend told Carolyn something she wasn't supposed to hear. From that moment on, Carolyn felt... nothing really mattered anymore.
Yes, Carolyn Bigsby had planned on it being an ordinary day... But as every housewife knows... Plans change.
THE NIGHT BEFORE She dreamt of the last time she saw me... and of the last time we spoke. It was still hard for Lynette to accept that this unremarkable exchange had been our last. Or that moments later, I would enter my house, and put a bullet through my brain.

    [Mary Alice Young]: Lynette Scavo had a dream that night. It was one she'd had many times before. But this night, something changed. This was the last time Lynette would ever dream of me, and for her sake, I am grateful.

**Episode 8**

    [Mary Alice Young]: Karen McCluskey had always believed in helping others, whether they wanted her help or not. Yes, Mrs. McCluskey's helping hand was known throughout Wisteria Lane. But on this day, it was about to get slapped. Yes, Karen McCluskey believed in helping others... Which she felt gave her the right... To help herself.
Each year as part of their fund-raising drive, the Fairview adventure scouts would award a shiny new bike to whoever sold the most magazine subscriptions. And each scout would set out utterly convinced the prize would be hers. That's the beauty of youth. Little girls believe anything is possible... That is, until they grow up anget divorced.

    [Mary Alice Young]: There are so many things we wish we could tell the young. We'd like to persuade them not to grow up so fast, but they won't listen. We want to tell them that beauty fades, but they refuse to believe it. We warn them that their actions will have consequences, but still they defy us. Sadly, the young can't begin to understand the world is a dangerous place. So it's up to us to do anything we can to protect them... Absolutely anything.

**Episode 9**

    [Mary Alice Young]: Susan Mayer had never thought of herself as Cinderella, but then one day... a prince showed up. And Susan realized her life had become... a fairy tale. And since her prince had welcomed her into his castle, She felt the least she could do was thank him... Again... And again... And again. The next morning, however, Susan discovered castles... Don't run themselves. Yes, Susan's life had indeed become a fairy tale. And what's a fairy tale... Without a dragon to slay?
We know dangerous men walk among us. What we can't be sure of is who they are or where they hide. So the most we can offer any stranger is reasonable doubt. But once the doubt is gone, people are anything but reasonable.

    [Mary Alice Young]: Dangerous men walk among us, and we can't always be sure of who they are or what secrets they hide. But once our worst suspicions are confirmed, we can take action. Once their agendas are revealed... We can take steps, to protect ourselves, and those we love. Yes, dangerous men can cause great harm. But sometimes the greatest danger they pose... Is to themselves.

**Episode 10**

    [Mary Alice Young]: The annual block party was a winter tradition on Wisteria Lane. It was a way for the residents to spread holiday cheer. Everyone was invited... Including Art Shepard, The newest resident of Wisteria Lane. But as the big night drew near, more than holiday cheer was being spread around. By Sunday evening, most of the gossiping had subsided, and the neighborhood was once again consumed by the spirit of the season. Friends laughed over eggnog, lovers kissed under mistletoe, and the mood was jolly. That is, until a certain guest made his appearance. Yes, for the residents of Wisteria Lane, it was the most wonderful time of the year. But for Arthur Shepard and his sister, it had turned t to be a very silent night.
For the residents of Wisteria Lane, the holiday season could only begin, once the decorations came out. For some, that meant pulling out the colored lights. For others, it meant locating that holiday wreath. And then there were those eager to display their nativity scene. But for a romantic few, it was all about the mistletoe.

    [Mary Alice Young]: There's a reason people can't wait for Christmas, and it has little to do with family reunions... Or curling up with a cup of eggnog... Or that unexpected kiss beneath the mistletoe... Or receiving a present from that special someone. No, people look forward to Christmas, because they know it's a time... for miracles.

He had to be punished. Yes,this was the journey of alma hodge... and it wasn't over yet.
There is a time of day all housewives look forward to. It occurs just after the chores have been completed and right before the children come home from school. It's a time for good friends to get together, have a cup of coffee and exchange gossip aboutthe other good friends who couldn't make it that day.

    [Mary Alice Young]: It's a dangerous world... So we all look for protection... And whether we find it in the arms of our mother... Or at the end of a jacket blade...

Yes,when it came to teeth,people expected dr. Hodge to have all the answers. Sadly for orson,this was not always the case.
Yes,orson was an expert on teeth. That's how he could tell when people were lying through them.
It can happen so quickly. In the moment it takes a gunman's bullet to enter his victim's leg... in the time it takes to tell a wife her husband won't be home for dinner... in the instant it takes a father to meet his son for the very first time... yes,life as we know it can change... in a heartbeat.

    [Mary Alice Young]: Yes,it can happen so quickly. Life as we know it can change in the blink of an eye.

    [Mary Alice Young]: It had been two months since Mike Delfino had awakened from his coma, and the memories he had lost were finally starting to return. He could now recall the first time he saw Wisteria Lane... And the first time he met his new neighbors... And the first time he heard Susan Mayer laugh. But the memory he most wanted to reclaim still eluded him. That's why he had gone to see a hypnotherapist, so that he could finally remember everything.
Yes, there were still many things Mike Delfino couldn't remember... But he'd finally remembered the most important thing of all.
It was 6:00 in the morning, and Bree Hodge was faced with a dilemma familiar to countless housewives. Should she wake her husband to discuss recent events that were weighing heavily on her mind? Or should she left him continue to get the rest he needed? Bree made the obvious choice.

**Episode 15**

    [Mary Alice Young]: Orson Hodge had always assumed that the moment before he died, his entire life would flash before his eyes. But as he fell from the roof of the Fairview Memorial Hospital, it wasn't his life he saw. It was one night in particular.
Yes... Orson Hodge had always assumed that his life would flash before his eyes the moment before he died. Luckily, for Orson... That moment... Was not scheduled for today.
The first light of sunrise. The sound of the cat purring. The smell of fresh coffee. Yes, there are many things a housewife likes to wake up to. But an unexpected guest in her bed... is not one of them.

    [Mary Alice Young]: A surprising thing happened to Orson Hodge as he'd left Fairview Memorial Hospital. His life began to flash before his eyes. But it wasn't his past he saw. It was his future. Ordinary suburban days, filled with ordinary suburban moments, each made beautiful because of the housewife by his side. Yes, Orson could finally envision a life free from secrets and pain. And he couldn't wait for it to begin.

**Episode 16**

    [Rex Van De Kamp]: My name is Rex Van De Kamp. I always hated cemeteries when I was alive. Now that I'm dead, I like 'em even less. Here's where I used to live. A whole lot nicer, don't you think? The place hasn't changed much since I left, as tasteful and tidy as ever. Everything perfect... at least on the surface. My family was the same way. Look at us. You'd never guess how ticked off we all were the day this was taken, but that was the thing about us Van De Kamps. To really fit in, you had to have a smile that gave away nothing. Like my son Andrew. To look at him, you'd never know he spent six months on the streets supporting himself with panhandling and light prostitution. Or my daughter Danielle. Does she look like the kind of girl who'd seduce her middle-aged History teacher? I mean, they're my kids, and I love 'em, but I'm pretty darn relieved to be dead. Here's the clown Bree replaced me with, Orson. I don't mind saying, he's creeped me out right from the get-go. To me, he always has the shifty look of a guy who knows where the bodies are buried... But Bree thinks he's sir Galahad. The kids like him. And all my friends... now his friends. So it pleases me to know that at least one of my old neighbors sees right through the guy.
No, Orson Hodge isn't exactly the guy I'd have picked to head my family, but I'll give him one thing... He's got the smile down cold.
Take a drive down any street in suburbia. You know what you're gonna see? Desperate women. That's right. One unhappy housewife after another, each completely miserable... in her own unique way. But I don't want to talk about them. No, I want to talk about their men and what happens to a guy when that special lady in his life starts to lose it. Like my friend Carlos. He used to have it all. Hot wife, tons of dough, then bam! She gets a divorce, and he gets stuck with the bill. But does he sit around and complain like your average hausfrau? No, sir. He finds creative ways to get what you can out of life.
This is my friend Tom. Have you heard what he's been up to lately? This silly bastard opened up his own pizza place. He thought that if he was his own boss, he could sleep in as late as he wanted, but the problem with that logic is that married guys... Are never their own boss.
This is Ian. Don't really know the guy, but Susan Mayer seems to like him. The other night, he surprised her with a proposal. She said yes, but he's still a little skittish about the competition. But Ian knows that if love is war... Sometimes you gotta bring out the big artillery.

    [Rex Van De Kamp]: Take a drive down any street in suburbia. You know what you're gonna see? A bunch of guys wearing the same expression. It's a look that says, "Oh, crap. My dreams are never gonna come true." "I'll never have a life free from scandal." "I'll never have a son of my own." "I'll never hold her in my arms again." "I'll never get to tell her how I feel." Yeah, the suburbs are filled with a lot of men who have given up hope. Of course, every once in a while you do come across some lucky S.O.B. whose dreams have all come true. You know how you spot them? They're the ones who can't stop smiling. Don't you just hate those guys?

**Episode 17**

    [Mary Alice Young]: if there was one thing ian hainsworth was sure of, it was that his love for susan mayer was indestructible. He knew this because it had been tested again... and again... and again. still,ian had found a way to forgive susan her... occasional lack of grace. The question now on his mind was, would his parents be able to do the same?
Yes,ian hainsworth knew his love for susan was indestructible. Unfortunately for his mother,chiffon was not.
In every housewife's closet, there's a treasured article of clothing that she refuses to part with. It might be an old cheerleader uniform that symbolizes her youth... Or the last bikini she wore before she had children... or a pair of expensive pants she prays will come back in style. But for gabrielle solis, every piece of clothing was a treasure-- carefully selected, beautifully maintained and utterly... irreplaceable.

    [Mary Alice Young]: (Mid-episode) As edie walked home, all she could think of was her nonexistent love life... and how much she wanted back in the game. it was just then she saw someone she might like to play with.

    [Mary Alice Young]: in every housewife's closet there's an article of clothing that tells you more about its owner than she would want you to know. It might be a shirt that she despises but wears without complaint. Perhaps it's some lingerie she knows isn't hers but refuses to discuss... or a dress she once loved... that she can no longer bear to look at. Yes, you can learn a lot about women from what they choose to wear. You can learn even more by what they choose to take off, and who they take it off for.

**Episode 18**

    [Mary Alice Young]: Eddie Britt had always thought of herself as passionate-- aggressively... relentlesly... violently passionate. Carlos Solis had always thought of himself as passionate romantically... spontaneously... constant passionate. So it was natural for Eddie and Carlos to assume that if they ever had sex, it would be amazing. And, in fact, it was... amazingly... bad.
It was at that moment Eddie and Carlos had the exact same thought... They would definitely be having sex again... just not... with each other.
It's so easy to spot the lonely ones. they're the peop who tell stories to their plants... And whisper secrets to their et ***** And have arguments with their tv. And the loneliest of all are the ones who talk to people... People who areo longerhere.

**Episode 19**

    [Mary Alice Young]: it was late on a tuesday night when the power went out all over fairview. for most of the residents, it was a minor inconvenience. But for those with secrets, the darkness proved quite useful indeed. Millie russell was able to indulge in another night of midnight binging. Timmy cooper was ableo sneak another peek at his father's adult magazines. Marilyn quinn was able to steal a few more puffs of her forbidden tobacco. but these secrets paled compared to the one a certain old woman was hiding in her basement.
Yes,as a rule,darkness helps us keep our secrets safely hidden. But every rule... Has its exceptions.
When the lights went out on wisteria lane, karen mccluskey wasn't the only reside left in the dark. Everyone else felt the pain of going without power as well.

    [Mary Alice Young]: (Mid-episode) Though reluctant at first, carlos soon saw the wisdom in edie's plan. Secret affairs e a lot like real estate. The three keys to success are... location... location... location.

    [Mary Alice Young]: power-- it's the type of thing most people don't think about... until it's taken away. Whether it's the political power of the many... or a lover's influence over just one... we all want some sort of power in our lives... if only to give ourselves choices. Yes, to be without choices, to feel utterly powerless, well... it's a lot... like being alone...in the dark.

**Episode 20**

    [Mary Alice Young]: I don't know my own strength... the night of her engagement party, gabrielle solis was injured. But she wasn't hurt by the chauffer who almost slammed a door on her fingers... or the stranger who almost stepped on her hand... or the waiter who almost dropped a knife on her wrist. No, gabrielle's injury came about in a more unexpected fashion and was caused by someone gabrielle thought was her friend.
and this is how gabrielle solis came to be injured the night of her engagement party. And though she seemed to laugh it off, gabrielle had been cut much, much deeper than anyone could see.
gossip-- for most housewives, it's just a harmless form of recreation, an exchange of semi-interesting tidbits concerning the semi-interesting lives of people they know. ... But the time comes in every neighborhood when something very interesting happens, and that's when gossip stops being recreation and becomes... obsession.

    [Mary Alice Young]: Gossip-- it's just a harmless form of recreation. It's careless talk that deals in polite fiction... it's nasty speculation that's based on not-so-polite fact... How do we protect ourselves from the venomous sting of such idle gossip? The best way is to just tell the truth... And wait for people to start talking about someone else.

**Episode 21**

    [Mary Alice Young]: it can happen to anyone-- an old woman hears suspicious footsteps as she walks down the street... a businessman sees a reflection in his car window... A shop owner feels a blade...pressed against his back... and in that instant... an ordinary person... is transformed into a victim. And a world that seemed so safe is suddenly... filled with danger.
Yes, in the moment it takes to bolt a freezer door, ordinary pple can become victims. And a world that seemed so safe... ...Is suddenly filled with danger.
At the exact same moment his wife was being locked in a freezer, tom scavo was having a nightmare about monsters trying to destroy his home. But it wasn't until he woke up the next morning that his real nightmare began.

    [Mary Alice Young]: Anyone can end up a victim... Injured by the actions of others. But whether the damage is inflicted by a cunning ex-wife... Or a blow delivered by the object of our affection... The time comes when we must pick ourselves up and continuen our journey. And if we can't, then all we can pray for... Is rescue.

So when mike took susan to her favorite restaurant, she just knew he was going to pop the question. And when he did... she'd be ready with her answer. But as the evening wore on, the moment susan had been waiting for... failed to materialize. and though many opportunities presented themselves... the question was never asked. Until the thought began to dawn on susan that perhaps... it never would.
yes,susan knew mike was about to pop the question-- the one she feared he'd never ask. And thanks to susan... He never did. luckily,it wasn't the question she needed to hear. It was the answer.
From the moment we wake up in the morning... Till our head hits the pillow at night... Our lives are filled with questions... simple ones that are easy to answer. But someuestions are so dangerous, the truth...is not an option.

    [Mary Alice Young]: From the moment we wake up in the morning Till our head hits the pillow at night our lives are filled with questions. Most are easily answered and soon forgotten. but some questions are much harder to ask because we're so afraid of the answer. Will I be around to watch my children grow up? Am I making a mistake by marrying this man? Could he ever truly love me? And what happens when we ask ourself the hard question and get the answer we'd been hoping for? Well,that's when happiness begins.

**Episode 23**

    [Mary Alice Young]: When Gabrielle Solis agreed to marry Victor Lang, she was determined to have a very traditional wedding. She was even more determined to be a very traditional bride. To that end, the handkerchief in her cleavage was borrowed, the garter on her leg was blue, and the diamonds on her ears were old. But sadly for Gabrielle, something was missing, and she was about to throw a traditional fit.
As promised, Bree had arrived with something new. And she also... brought the bracelet.
Family... there is nothing more important. They're the ones we want to laugh with during the good times... And the ones we need to console us during the bad. And even though the time comes when they have to leave us, their voices still linger in our minds. And sometimes we can't help but listen.

    [Mary Alice Young]: Family... there is nothing more important. They're the ones who show up when we're in trouble... the ones who push us to succeed... the ones who help keep our secrets. But what of those who have no family to rely on? What happens to those poor souls... who have no loved ones to help them in their hour of need? Well... most learn to walk life's road by themselves. But a sad few of us... simply... stop trying.
