# Season 4

## Episode 1

[Mary Alice Young]: The first thing you should know is that Edie Britt never actually intended to die, but someone she loved was trying to leave her.
So she planned every detail, from the silk scarf she'd hang by to the suicide note detailing her despair.
Now all Edie had to do... was wait... for her beloved to come home.
You see, to hold on to her man, Edie knew she'd have to find the perfect moment to let go.
Sadly for Edie, her timing was fatally flawed.
And this is how Carlos Solis arrived just in the nick of time to save the life of Edie Britt.
Of course, had he known what she was about to do to his life, he would've let her hang there.
There is a certain time of night, after children have been put to bed and husbands have begun snoring, that women lie awake and think of the secrets they've been keeping from their friends.
It might be an impromptu wedding... or a recently diagnosed tumor... or a make-believe pregnancy.
Regardless, it's all they will think of... until something comes along to remind them that other people have secrets, too.

[Mary Alice Young]: There is a certain time of morning.
It occurs after kids have left for school and husbands have headed off for work.
It's a time when women think of the secrets they've been keeping from their friends... and how shocked they would be if the truth was discovered... and how they'll do everything in their power to keep that from happening.
But what of those lucky women who have no secrets left to keep?
What do they think about every morning?
These women spend their mornings thinking of their neighbors and the secrets they may be keeping.

## Episode 2

[Mary Alice Young]: The great crime wave hit Wisteria Lane on a Tuesday afternoon.
That's when residents found their barbecues opened... their clean laundry trampled... and their skateboards missing.
Naturally, everyone began to ask who could be responsible for such carnage.
The answer lay in the home of a neighbor who, 20 minutes earlier, had been engaging in... an altogether different type of crime.
And so ended the great crime wave on Wisteria Lane.
No one ever found out who was responsible... because it was an inside job.
You will never see despair here... or rage.
You will never see the tiniest bit of regret.
You see, the people who live here have learned there is one sure way of hiding their secrets... from their neighbors.
That's why, in the suburbs, there is nothing more deceptive than a smile.

[Mary Alice Young]: There is nothing more deceptive than a smile, and no one knows this better than the people who hide behind them.
Some flash their teeth as a polite warning to their enemies.
Some put on beaming faces to keep their tears from falling.
Others wear silly grins to mask their fear.
But then there is that rare smile that is actually genuine.
It's the smile of a person who knows his troubles will soon be over.

## Episode 3

[Mary Alice Young]: All children love to play games.
But before they can race their bikes or jump their ropes or toss their frisbees, children understand they must first convince their friends to play along with them.
The same is true for adults.
Yes, not all adults like to play games.
But the ones who do... play to win.
Stella Wingfield hated to cook.
Still, she spent that Friday morning grating cheese... and greasing a pan... and laying in macaroni because her eldest daughter was sick, and Stella could no longer sit by and do nothing.

[Mary Alice Young]: All children love games.
But children grow up, and then they find new games to play.
They pretend to be well so their families won't worry.
They lie to their lovers about where they go in the afternoon.
They invent stories to hide the truth from their friends.
Yes... everyone has fun playing games right up until the moment... Someone gets hurt.

## Episode 4

[Mary Alice Young]: Mrs. Lillian Sims returned to Wisteria Lane on a Saturday.
As she emerged from the ambulance, it occurred to her the neighborhood looked exactly as she had left it.
She then decided she should have painted her house blue.
Moments later, she wondered if she would see her husband in heaven.
These are just some of the thoughts that go through an old woman's mind when she comes home to die.
As her guilt over the past began to mount, it occurred to Lillian death couldn't come quickly enough.
This thought occurred to her niece as well.
There were a lot of things Bob Hunter disliked about living in the city, and the thing he hated most were the pests-- the rats that lurked in the alleys... the flies that swarmed the garbage... the bugs that invaded his co-op.
Finally, Bob informed his significant other it was time... to leave the city.
So they moved to suburbia, which they quickly discovered had a few pests... of its own.

[Mary Alice Young]: Pests-- they come in all shapes and sizes and disrupt our lives in a variety of ways.
At first, they're merely annoying, and we do our best to ignore them.
But if we don't take them seriously, they can become quite dangerous.
For some, death seems to be the easiest solution.
But the problem with pests is that what they leave behind... is just as dangerous.

## Episode 5

[Mary Alice Young]: The odd-looking boxes were delivered to the home of Bob Hunter and Lee McDermott early on a Tuesday morning.
It wasn't long before workmen had opened them and begun assembling the various parts and pieces.
Happily, it only took three hours to turn the contents into a finished work of art.
Sadly, it only took 15 minutes for the residents of Wisteria Lane... to become art critics.
Yes, art came to Wisteria Lane on a Tuesday morning, and by Tuesday afternoon... war had come as well.
As word of the sculpture spread, Bob and Lee began to wonder if any of their neighbors would be supportive.
But when the sculpture's true function was unveiled the next day, whatever support they did have... was quickly washed away.

[Mary Alice Young]: It's the same for all of us.
We try not to get too close to the people who live next door.
It's easier to give them a polite nod than to ask what's wrong.
It's safer to keep walking by than to get involved.
True, we sometimes do get to know the people we share a fence with and end up lifelong friends.
But mostly, we keep our distance because we'd rather our neighbors know nothing about us... than know too much.

## Episode 6

[Mary Alice Young]: No narration found at the beginning of Episode 6.

[Mary Alice Young]: There is much to be afraid of in this world, but what we fear has nothing to do with gruesome masks or plastic spiders or lifelike monsters.
No, it's the thoughts in our head that terrify us the most...
What if she comes to regret her decision?
What if he really is unhappy?
What if the chance for love has passed forever?
How do we conquer these terrifying thoughts?
We start by reminding ourselves what does not kill us... just makes us stronger.

## Episode 7

[Mary Alice Young]: The thing you need to know about Victor Lang is that he was not above using deception.
Whether it was an insincere promise to a campaign donor, or the artful evasion of a reporter's question, or an outright lie to his constituents, Victor did what he had to to get what he wanted.
But thanks to some compromising photos, he learned that his wife knew a little something about deception as well.
Yes, Victor was not above using deception to get what he wanted, and what he wanted now was revenge.
The next day on Wisteria Lane began with a bit of deceit.
Bree Hodge told her friends she had given birth in the middle of the night to a beautiful baby boy.
And thanks to the healthy lungs of Benjamin Tyson Hodge, it didn't take long for Bree's friends to engage in some deceit of their own.

[Mary Alice Young]: Deception-- You find it in all the best homes.
Parents rely on it when dealing with inquisitive children...
Women use it to help keep secrets-- big and small.
Lovers need it to cover up inconvenient accidents.
Why do people resort to deception?
Because it's a handy tool that helps get us exactly what we're looking for.

## Episode 8

[Mary Alice Young]: We think of the past as water under the bridge, a current that carries away the mistakes of our youth-- the loves we lost... the addictions we gave into... the opportunities we threw away...
But sooner or later, reminders drift back into our lives... of the mistakes we made... and the sins we committed.
Yes, the mistakes of our past have a way of drifting back into our lives... And when they do... We have to pay for them.
One day in the early fall, Mike Delfino hurt his shoulder...
To ease his pain, he took a little white pill recommended by his doctor.
The pain persisted, so he took another... And another.
Unfortunately, when Mike's pain began to subside, his need for the little white pills... did not.
But Mike never shared this with those who cared about him, only with those who could not have cared less.

[Mary Alice Young]: The past is never truly behind us.
Ghosts lurk in the shadows, eager to remind us of the choices we made.
But if we look back, we might find an old friend with open arms... Or an old enemy with a hidden agenda.
Or a grown-up son with a forgiving heart...
Sadly, some of us refuse to look back, never understanding that by denying the past... We are condemned... To repeat it.

## Episode 9

[Mary Alice Young]: It was supposed to be a beautiful day.
Kids should have been playing in the park.
Husbands should have been doing their chores.
Women should have been tending their flowers.
But at 2:26 that afternoon, a tornado came to Wisteria Lane... bringing with it... unbelievable... destruction.
No one could have anticipated it... especially given how the day started.
Sadly, this was not to be.
Oh!
In four short hours, one of these women would lose a husband, and all of them would lose a friend.
But how could they have known this?
It was supposed to be a beautiful day.

[Mary Alice Young]: It was supposed to be a beautiful day.
But then the winds came and changed everything... And not just the houses and the lawns.
Oh, my God.
The people had changed, too.
While the storm had raged, each of them had learned something... about friendship... and forgiveness... and redemption.
And some had learned the hardest lesson of all... that life is always fragile and very often... unfair.

## Episode 10

[Mary Alice Young]: Once the tornado had passed, it began.
A man gave his coat to a stranger in need... a woman shared her food with those just passing by... a teenager reunited a dog with its worried owner.
These are the things that happen in the wake of any great disaster.
People start to perform small acts of kindness.
They do what they can to help, all the while knowing... it won't be enough.
Yes, in the wake of a great tragedy, people do what they can to help... all the while knowing... it won't be enough.
The morning after the tornado, the residents of Wisteria Lane began to sort through the devastation and slowly started picking up the pieces of their lives.
Bob Hunter found part of his fountain in the middle of the street.
Bree Hodge found her lawn mower next to her coffee table.
And Kayla Scavo discovered her music box in a tree... among... other things.

[Mary Alice Young]: It had been seven days since a tornado devastated Wisteria Lane, and the residents continued to pick up the pieces of their lives.
Some salvaged precious friendships.
Some uncovered colorful histories.
Others found challenges they hadn't expected.
And then... there was one girl... who stumbled upon the truth she'd long been searching for... only... to wish she hadn't.

## Episode 11

[Mary Alice Young]: Katherine Mayfair was not the kind of woman who liked to relive the past.
But when her husband Adam left her, Katherine's life began to unravel, and the mistakes of her youth started to flash through her mind.
She thought of Wayne Davis, the first man she married... And the first time he had hit her.
She thought of how sincerely he apologized... And how meaningless his apologies were... And how she finally decided... to hit back.
These were the thoughts going through Katherine's mind... when her friends and neighbors arrived... bearing gifts.
Yes, Katherine Mayfair was not a woman who liked to relive the past.
But lately, her life had begun to unravel.
And she couldn't help thinking of all the mistakes she had made... And especially... the ones she had buried.
It happened once a week on Wisteria Lane like clockwork.
The faithful would emerge from their homes in their Sunday best... with their family bibles... and their rosary beads... and they would head off to their various houses of worship, passing by a certain nonbeliever who had never taken an interest in their ritual.
But on this day, Lynette Scavo, for the first time in her life, was struck by something... something she would later think of as divine inspiration.

[Mary Alice Young]: Faith is a belief in something that cannot be proven.
So we trust in the words of the only father we've ever known.
We believe the promises of the woman who shares our bed.
We rely on the example of dear friends who help us to be better people.
Yes, we all want to believe in those we are closest to, but where there is doubt, our faith begins to vanish... and fear rushes in to take its place.

## Episode 12

[Mary Alice Young]: In a corridor of the Greenwood Rehabilitation Center is a sign.
It's there to remind patients to be honest about the past.
But Orson Hodge did not notice it.
He was too busy thinking of his past, or at least the part of it he shared with Mike Delfino.
Orson thought of the night they met-- the night his mother... had murdered his mistress.
He thought of the next time they met and how Mike began to recognize him.
He thought of his mother's fear Mike would remember too much and her demand that Orson stop this from happening.
He thought of how he agonized, but in the end, had still... done the unthinkable.
Orson then started to think about the message he had received from Mike, asking him to visit.
The thought was crossing Orson's mind that Mike had remembered something-- something dangerous, when suddenly... the time for thinking was over.
As he left, Orson thought only of his good fortune and relief, ignoring completely the feelings of guilt and shame that were rising within him.
That was the sad thing about Orson Hodge... He had no idea just how sick he really was.
From the moment his doctors had told him he was blind, Carlos Solis had worried about only one thing-- that the people in his life would come to see him as a burden.
But as it turned out, his friends didn't mind driving him to the store.
His neighbors didn't mind helping retrieve his mail.
The paper boy didn't mind helping him find his morning paper.
In truth, everyone on Wisteria Lane was more than willing to help Carlos adjust to life as a blind man-- everyone, that is... but his wife, who was quickly starting to feel she was the one with the handicap.

[Mary Alice Young]: Blindness-- It's an affliction that prevents people from seeing what is right in front of them...
Like the wives who can't detect the jealousy that consumes their husbands... the women unable to see that a rival might also be a friend... the men who stay oblivious to the guilt that lies deep within them.
Yes... the world is filled with those who cannot see.
The most dangerous are the ones who stay blind to the evil within their own hearts.
How do we protect ourselves from these people?
First, we have to open our own eyes and find them... before they find us.

## Episode 13

[Mary Alice Young]: The thing you have to know about Lynette Scavo is that she had always trusted her husband Tom, mostly because she could always tell when he was lying.
Sometimes he would ask her to repeat the question... Or he would use odd words he had never used before... Or his voice would get higher...
Clearly, Tom Scavo was at a distinct disadvantage when lying to his wife.
And on this particular morning, that's exactly what Lynette... was counting on.
Lynette Scavo had always trusted her husband.
She had no idea that trust... was about to go up in flames.
Everyone breaks the rules now and again, and when they do, they always have an excuse... like the neighbor whose own trash was already full... or the blonde who forgot to eat her breakfast... or the employee who needed an advance on his salary...
It's true-- everyone has a reason for not following the rules... even the people who are meant to enforce them.

[Mary Alice Young]: The truth is, everyone breaks the rules now and then...
Never thinking for one second they might get caught.
But if they do, they simply ask for forgiveness.
And most of the time, they receive it.
But some acts are so wicked, they demand only our condemnation.
How do people avoid such a fate?
Well... the trick is knowing which rules are made to be broken... and which rules... are not.

## Episode 14

[Mary Alice Young]: It happens in every marriage.
Couples accumulate lovely things-- things that make a house a home.
But when the home is broken, these things must be divided.
The most dignified way to do this is for each spouse to keep what is most important to them.
And Bree and Orson Hodge were nothing... if not dignified.
In any separation, it's only fair that each spouse get to keep what is most important to them.
That's how Bree Hodge got to keep her pewter cat... and Orson Hodge got to hold on to... his freedom.
The suburbs are flush with a certain kind of fool.
You know the type-- the man who opens his door to total strangers... the woman who never uses her latch.
It never occurs to them that letting someone into their home... means letting them into their lives.

[Mary Alice Young]: The word "Welcome" always carries with it a certain amount of risk.
After all, to let someone into your home is to let them into your life.
And we never know what sorts of horrible secrets they carry with them.
We can't foresee the painful effect they might have on our loved ones.
We don't anticipate the gossip that could result from their presence.
Yes... We must be very careful with those we invite into our lives... Because some... will refuse to leave.

## Episode 15

[Mary Alice Young]: The incident-- as it would come to be known-- happened late on a Tuesday afternoon.
Witnesses included an old woman... a blind man... and a young boy.
The old woman, whose hearing was not what it used to be, saw Bree Hodge emerge from her house in a way that told her she was upset about something.
The blind man, whose hearing had become more acute, heard Edie say... ...in a way that suggested Edie wasn't expecting any trouble.
The young boy, who was not yet 11, heard Bree Hodge say... ...but he couldn't understand why someone would be angry about kisses, which he thought grown-ups liked.
As the old woman pretended to clip hedges she'd already clipped, she saw the body language of her neighbors change.
As the blind man listened in, he heard Bree say... ...the young boy then heard Edie add... ...which included a word he was not allowed to use.
The old woman then saw Bree Hodge clench her fist.
A second later, the blind man heard a slap... and the young boy saw Edie grab her cheek.
As the two women parted company, a thought occurred to all those who had witnessed the incident... that right there on peaceful Wisteria Lane, the battle lines had been drawn, and someone... was going to get hurt.
It happened on every second Sunday of May... children purchase tasteful bouquets... sign sentimental cards... and create homemade jewelry... all in an attempt to honor that woman known simply... as mother.

[Mary Alice Young]: It happens the second Sunday of every May.
We celebrate the women who give us life... and so much more.
The ones who protect us at all costs... who have the courage to fight those who would do us harm... who put our happiness ahead of their own.
But mostly... we celebrate a mother's love, which is constant, eternal... and there from the very beginning.

## Episode 16

[Mary Alice Young]: Coffee mugs to the contrary, Lynette Scavo knew that she was not the world's greatest mother.
In fact, when it came to parenting, Lynette had done many things she was not proud of... like the time when she offered Parker cash if he agreed to eat all of his spinach... or when she told the twins there was treasure buried beneath the weeds... or when she gave her kids a little extra cough syrup so she could finish her novel.
But despite these lapses... Lynette didn't think of herself as the worst mother in the world either, until one horrible day.
Yes, Lynette Scavo was not the world's greatest mother.
But in her heart, she knew she had done the best she could... given... what she had to work with.
"Lynette"-- It's how the French describe "a pretty one."
"Katherine"-- Coined by the ancient Greeks, it denotes "purity."
"Gabrielle"-- A Hebrew word meaning "God is my strength."
"Bree"-- It's an Irish name that means "power."
Indeed... every name has a single specific meaning... which is why parents have trouble choosing one for someone who means everything to them.

[Mary Alice Young]: What's in a name?
Do the labels we attach to people tell us everything we need to know?
If we say she's just a child, does this mean she's truly innocent?
Does calling her a drug dealer prove she's purely evil?
Will a man known as "Preacher" always practice what he preaches?
Can a man branded a villain possess the qualities of a hero?
The truth is, a name can never really tell you who someone is... any more than it can tell you what they're capable of.

## Episode 17

[Mary Alice Young]: It had been 14 years since Katherine Mayfair had been in a police station, but she remembered the conversation like it was yesterday.
And so she did... to a place she thought would be safe.
In that moment, Katherine knew exactly what she had to do... again.
Katherine Mayfair had been running from the truth for a long time... and it had finally caught up with her.
There's a ritual my friends have observed for years.
Once a week, they meet to play a game of cards and talk about their lives.
There's always laughter and wine... and talk about the neighbors.

[Mary Alice Young]: There's a ritual my friends have observed for years.
Once a week, they meet to play a game of cards and talk about their lives.
Of course, there's another aspect to these gatherings that has nothing to do with gossip or poker.
Every seven days, my friends are reminded of a basic human truth: There is nothing more important than friendships that endure, especially in a world that insists on changing.
