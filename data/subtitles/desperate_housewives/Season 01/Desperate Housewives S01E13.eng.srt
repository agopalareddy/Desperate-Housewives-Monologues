2
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,969
Previously on Desperate Housewives...

3
00:00:03,036 --> 00:00:06,802
- Were you with a woman?
- You said you'd hate him forever.

4
00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:10,001
Don't listen to a woman
who's had her heart broken.

5
00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:11,304
Ending a relationship...

6
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:15,313
- I want to be with you.
- I don't think that would be wise.

7
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:18,646
...can be very hard.
- I was sleeping with your son.

8
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:21,778
- But it's over now.
- Keping secrets...

9
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:24,322
- It's not over.
...is even harder.

10
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:29,987
- I don't understand what you're saying.
- I killed my baby sister.

11
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,593
[Lynette shouting]

12
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:41,306
[Lynette] I want the toys picked up.

13
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:44,002
Pick up your toys.
You want a spanking?

14
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:48,979
There is a look
the parents of well-behaved children

15
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:52,142
give to the parents
of the not so well-behaved.

16
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:55,984
Don't look at me like that.
I will wipe that smirk off your face.

17
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:59,286
It's a look that says
"Control your kids".

18
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,850
We're just gonna clean the yard...

19
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:05,795
"After all,
they're your responsibility".

20
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:11,470
[Lynette] Hey, I'm not fooling.

21
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:17,067
It was easy for Susan
to fel smug with a daughter like Julie.

22
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:21,679
- She brought home straight As.
- Oh! You did it again!

23
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:25,177
She was helpful around the house.

24
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:33,422
She was bright, affectionate
and considerate of others.

25
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,329
To her mother's way of thinking,
Julie was the perfect child.

26
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:44,030
Unfortunately, Susan was about to
discover that no such creature existed.

27
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:49,436
Mom!

28
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:52,342
Were you just kissing my daughter?

29
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:56,212
- Uh... uh, a little.
- What are you thinking?

30
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:58,614
- Mom, calm down.
- She's 14!

31
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:01,677
I should...
I should probably be going.

32
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,949
Ya think?

33
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,786
Oh, just...

34
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:11,160
- See you Friday.
- What's happening on Friday?

35
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:14,894
- He's taking me to the school dance.
- Oh, no, he's not.

36
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:18,402
Mom, I know you saw us kissing,
but you've got to chill now.

37
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:21,201
I have no intentions of chilling.

38
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,775
Whatever.
I'm taking out the trash.

39
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:27,279
- You will talk about this.
- Not while you're freaking out.

40
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,473
You will not see him anymore.

41
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:31,608
There is also a look

42
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:36,347
the parents of not-so-well behaved
children give to parents like Susan.

43
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:40,882
It says, "Welcome to the club".

44
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,993
Suburbia is a place
filled with responsible people

45
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:29,040
trying to live responsible lives.

46
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:33,971
Of course,
even the most responsible among us

47
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,173
has mistakes in their past.

48
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:42,787
Mistakes they'd like to forget.

49
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:51,787
Mistakes that sometimes
come back to haunt them.

50
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,332
I'm gonna go get the mail.

51
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,936
Helen.

52
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:04,033
I don't believe
you've met my husband. Bob.

53
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,840
Hi. So nice to meet you...

54
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:12,279
Uh, we, um, came to talk to you
about our son.

55
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:14,479
I haven't seen John in weeks.

56
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:18,751
He's left messages, but I haven't
returned any. It's over. I swear.

57
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:22,818
We're not here about that.
We need you to do something for us.

58
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:23,987
Oh. OK...

59
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:28,329
John announced he was turning down
his college scholarship.

60
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:33,531
Instead he's decided to expand his
gardening business. Mow lawns full time.

61
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:37,070
Why, uh... why would he do that?

62
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:41,044
We don't know. Do you think
we'd be talking to you if we did?

63
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:44,606
Forgive my wife.
She's still upset over the, um...

64
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:47,414
- Statutory rape thing.
- Helen!

65
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,988
What do you want me to do?

66
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:52,991
He's refusing to talk to us.

67
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:56,517
If you could convince him
that he's making a mistake...

68
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:58,689
John and I made a clean break.

69
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:01,265
It's best we just keep our distance.

70
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:07,306
Please. Last week he turned eighteen
and moved out of the house. We're stuck.

71
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:12,466
I'm sorry. I... I... I'm so sorry,

72
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:18,108
I just can't handle this right now.
I have my own personal things going on.

73
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:20,550
- I don't care.
- Helen...

74
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:25,750
We haven't gone to the police about what
you did, but that can easily change.

75
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:32,022
I'll see what I can do.

76
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:35,063
Good.

77
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:41,964
So nice to meet you.

78
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:43,337
Ahem.

79
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:52,783
You can do this. Scooch down
a few inches and I'll grab ya.

80
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,719
- No. You'll drop me.
- I'm not gonna drop you.

81
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:59,724
I might strangle you
for climbing up here in the first place.

82
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:01,259
[Car horn]

83
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,295
Come here, ya monsters!

84
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,992
Look who I found
wandering around the airport.

85
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:08,533
Hey, Rodney!

86
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:11,263
- Is Parker back up on the roof?
- Yep.

87
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:14,534
See if he can find that Frisbee
while he's up there.

88
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:16,199
I'll get right on that.

89
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:19,472
- How's my favorite girl?
- So happy to see you.

90
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,706
Shame Allison couldn't make it.

91
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:25,114
Just another business trip
for the wandering salesman.

92
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:27,880
She'd be bored to tears.
Hey, Parker!

93
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,251
Aren't you gonna give me a hug?
It's Grandpa!

94
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:34,155
He's scared to climb down.

95
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,787
- Can I give it a shot?
- Yeah, sure. Knock yourself out.

96
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,491
- Yeah.
- Be careful.

97
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:44,895
Parker, I got a question for you.
It's an important question.

98
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:47,837
A character-defining question.
Wanna hear it?

99
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,464
Mm-hmm.

100
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:52,806
Only a girl would be
afraid to come down the ladder.

101
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,871
You're not a little girl, are you?

102
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:59,111
I'm not looking
at a little girlie-girl, am I?

103
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:06,921
- Are you OK?
- Come on.

104
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:12,087
- You got him down. How'd he do that?
- Sexism.

105
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,624
Let's address the division of assets.

106
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:19,535
We're not prepared to discuss
the primary residence at this time.

107
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,732
Are you prepared to discuss cars?

108
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:24,504
I'd like to discuss
country club membership.

109
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,272
Access to the facilities
is integral to Dr...

110
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:30,382
What are we doing here?

111
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:32,849
I'm sorry, Rex?

112
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,012
I'm talking to my wife.

113
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,555
With lawyers dividing our stuff.

114
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:41,320
I don't want this.
I thought I did, but I don't.

115
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:45,989
Maybe we should talk this over
before it's too late.

116
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:51,901
What do you say, Bree?
Should we send the vultures home?

117
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:06,882
I wanna keep the club membership.
Rex is terrible at tennis

118
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:10,046
and he hates buffets.

119
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,750
OK. On page two
of the proposed settlement,

120
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:16,158
you'll find our prioritized list.

121
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:17,319
Right.

122
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:21,255
- They were kissing, huh?
- Right at my kitchen table.

123
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,461
Must have shocked the hell out of 'em.

124
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:26,367
- I'm glad you can laugh.
- They're being kids.

125
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:30,170
You're the father of the boy.
I'm the mother of the girl.

126
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:32,234
If things get out of hand...

127
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:36,745
What is it you want from me?

128
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:41,013
Well, I want to know that I am not
the only one who's worried about this.

129
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:44,784
If the two of them are over here,
I want them supervised.

130
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,917
And I want you
to stop looking at me like I'm crazy.

131
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:53,364
I'm smiling because it's irrelevant.
I've sold the house.

132
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:54,956
Really?

133
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:57,160
We'll be out at the end of the month.

134
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:59,170
You sold the house?

135
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:01,763
- Zach...
- Why didn't you tell me?

136
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:03,968
I wanted to wait till it was official.

137
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:08,536
- You told me that you'd reconsidered.
- You need to take your medicine.

138
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:11,777
You think pumping me full of drugs
is gonna keep me quiet?

139
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,250
- Upstairs! Now!
- You don't care about me!

140
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:16,048
You didn't care about Mom!

141
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:19,649
You know what?
I wish she'd shot you instead.

142
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:33,694
So you're moving.
We're all gonna miss you.

143
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:38,710
[Lynette] Checklist means "is it in the
car?" not like, "do you remember it".

144
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:43,715
[Mary Alice] Before Parker Scavo's
Little League game had begun...

145
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:47,014
- Hurry!
- I'm not the one that forgot my mitt.

146
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:50,680
...a major player
was about to be tagged out.

147
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,923
Hi.

148
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:59,325
I thought you guys were at...
at practise.

149
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:02,731
Oh, Parker, um,
forgot his catcher's mitt.

150
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:08,463
Ah... Lynette,
this is Lois McDaniel.

151
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:13,342
She's one of my major suppliers.
She's in paper products manufacturing.

152
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,004
Oh.

153
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:17,811
Uh, it's nice to meet you.

154
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:20,283
Nice to meet you.
You have a lovely home.

155
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,218
Thank you.

156
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:25,552
Just working out,
uh, some of these new contracts.

157
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:29,355
Hammering out some of
the little things, the minor details.

158
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,862
Overhead, shipping costs...

159
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,761
Mommy, look what I found.

160
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:43,508
I'm sorry. These are mine. Thank you.
They must have fallen out of my purse.

161
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:52,113
Well, we don't want to be late
for the game. Nice to meet you.

162
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:08,723
- Hey.
- I'm not speaking to you.

163
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:11,065
Didn't like the settlement talks?

164
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:13,628
You demanded the good china
because I love it.

165
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:17,004
You take our timeshare in Aspen
and I'm vindictive?

166
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:20,977
- You'll hardly ever use that place.
- Hardly? How about never?

167
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,915
Fine. I'm gonna use your good china
for takeout food. Pizza. Spare ribs.

168
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:32,447
At our next settlement talks,
I plan on asking for your golf clubs.

169
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,618
Isn't divorce fun?

170
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:41,029
It's time for your heart medication.

171
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:45,036
I meant what I said at that meeting.
I will fire my lawyer tomorrow.

172
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:48,631
- Just give me the word.
- Sweetie, I think it's too late.

173
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:51,733
- Why?
- Because you were unfaithful.

174
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:54,871
But if you could
find a way to forgive me,

175
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:58,007
if we could be happy,
wouldn't you want that?

176
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:02,885
You know what I really,
truly want? Revenge.

177
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:08,325
I mean, if somehow we could level
the playing field, then, um,

178
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,658
maybe I could find
a way to come back.

179
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:13,596
So what does that mean?
You want to have an affair?

180
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:21,797
OK. Uh, so who are we talking
about here? Your dopey pharmacist?

181
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:26,139
Would that hurt you, Rex?
If I slept with another man?

182
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:30,205
It would devastate me.

183
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,442
Here you go.

184
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:39,458
- Bree, you... you can't possibly...
- Rex. Time to take your medicine.

185
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:55,899
[Phone]

186
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:00,570
[Julie] I got it!

187
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:16,292
[Julie] She doesn't hate you.
Mom just worries.

188
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:19,991
- [Zach] She thinks I'm crazy.
- No, she doesn't.

189
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:22,761
Well, maybe a little.

190
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:27,829
[Zach] You didn't tell her what
I told you, about what happened to Dana?

191
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:32,105
Zach, I can kep a secret.
I promise I will never tell her.

192
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:34,270
[Kettle whistles]

193
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:36,439
[Zach] What's that noise?

194
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,240
Hi.
What... what are you doing here?

195
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:10,578
I was walking outside
and I saw you in the window.

196
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,776
I never thought of you
as a diner person.

197
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:16,582
I'm not. The coffee's just dreadful.

198
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:20,250
Well, it's late
and I needed to get out of the house,

199
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:23,090
and it was the only place still open.

200
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,264
I didn't mean to interrupt.

201
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:32,461
George?

202
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:39,439
Would you like to join me
for a dreadful cup of coffee?

203
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:44,909
It was my first week in college
and I went to a... a meeting

204
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:47,815
of the Young Republicans
where Rex gave a speech.

205
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,378
And I went up to him afterward
and introduced myself,

206
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:54,688
told him I agreed with his stance
on the death penalty.

207
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,321
He took me out to a diner and, uh...

208
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:05,563
we stayed up 'til two talking about
big government, gun control,

209
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:08,300
and illegal immigration.

210
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:15,405
Uh, it was just...
it was just such a magical night.

211
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:19,076
And I knew by the time
he got me back to my dorm,

212
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:24,088
that one day
I was gonna be Mrs. Rex Van de Kamp.

213
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:26,317
Wow.

214
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,958
And even now,
after the betrayal,

215
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:33,829
I know that we're
supposed to be together.

216
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:37,232
But I don't know how I can
be with someone I don't trust.

217
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:40,295
So, what are you gonna do?

218
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,907
That I don't know.

219
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:49,108
What do you think I should do?

220
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:53,548
- You're asking me?
- I should not have done that. I am...

221
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:55,017
No, it's OK.

222
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,523
No, it was insensitive. I know
how you feel about me, and I...

223
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:02,025
Bree, I want to help.

224
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,889
Thank you.

225
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,865
So, does he love you?

226
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:15,301
Yes.

227
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:19,200
Is he a good person?

228
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:21,542
Aside from the adultery, yes.

229
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:23,740
Well, then it's easy.

230
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:31,085
If I could get a good person to love me,
I would find a way to forgive them.

231
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:37,118
You are such a special man,
George Williams.

232
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:40,060
And you deserve
such a special woman.

233
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,224
I think so.

234
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:23,265
[Ding]

235
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:34,651
Where are you going?

236
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:38,849
- I thought I'd eat this in my room.
- The house isn't that big, Rodney.

237
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:42,256
You're gonna have to stop avoiding me.

238
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:46,491
OK, OK.
Lois isn't a supplier.

239
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,827
Really?

240
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:50,026
Yeah, and I want to apologize.

241
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:54,266
I... I thought you and the kids
were gonna be gone all afternoon.

242
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:57,103
Is there anything I can do
to make it up to you?

243
00:17:57,209 --> 00:18:02,044
Well, you can wipe
that disgusting smirk off your face.

244
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:03,739
Lynette...

245
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:06,615
How could you do this to Allison?

246
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:10,212
I don't know.
It happens a little bit at a time.

247
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:13,156
Years go by, the kids burn you out,
I'm on the road,

248
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:15,693
we just drifted apart.
It's complicated.

249
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:19,458
It's not complicated.
It's completely irresponsible.

250
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:22,364
I have stayed married
to a woman I don't love,

251
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:26,461
because I made a vow to God.
Don't talk to me about responsibilities.

252
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:28,733
So you're the victim?

253
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:32,469
I can see that we're just going
to have to agree to disagree.

254
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:33,602
We're not done.

255
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:38,478
Yeah, we are. 'Cause my sex life
is my own business, not yours.

256
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:42,748
And there's nothing
you can do about it, anyway.

257
00:18:56,835 --> 00:19:01,932
- Dad? What are you doing?
- I don't want to talk about it.

258
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,567
- Does Lynette know you're out here?
- Oh, yeah. She knows.

259
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,704
- Can you drive me to the airport?
- Wait here.

260
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,044
- Lynette?
- Yeah?

261
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:15,348
Why is my Dad sitting out on the curb?

262
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:18,218
Because I kicked him out of the house.

263
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,554
I... I see. You wanna tell me why?

264
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,856
Hold on. I made you a drink.

265
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:28,933
Oh, God, what did he do?

266
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:35,463
Yesterday I came home and
I walked in on your dad with a woman.

267
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:39,203
He's having an affair.
I am so, so sorry.

268
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:43,408
- God...
- I know. I know. Are you OK?

269
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:45,575
Yeah. Um, I should go talk to him.

270
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:48,580
- That's it?
- What?

271
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:53,124
I just expected a bigger reaction.
I've got knots in my stomach.

272
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:57,719
I never mentioned this because
I knew how you'd react. But, um...

273
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:01,595
I'm not that surprised by this.

274
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:04,192
My father's
been having affairs for years.

275
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:09,432
- You knew about this?
- Yeah. Kinda. Yeah.

276
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:13,739
It was mostly in the past.
I didn't know that he was still at it.

277
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:17,543
I figured he was too old.
In some strange way, I'm impressed.

278
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:21,177
Impressed? Impressed? I...

279
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,118
Tom, don't tell me
you're all right with this.

280
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,090
I'm not. He should never
have brought her here.

281
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:29,524
He shouldn't have been with her at all!

282
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:32,291
I know.
But, you know, that's who he is.

283
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:35,697
It's been going on for years.
My mom's made peace with it.

284
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:39,703
- I seriously doubt that.
- There's no point in this.

285
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:43,036
I'm gonna bring my father back
and put him in his room.

286
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:48,204
- And we can all cool off.
- He is not coming back in this house.

287
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,805
- Yes, he is.
- No, he's not.

288
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:57,947
He is my father, this is my house.
You can't tell me what to do.

289
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:02,085
I say we kick the door down.

290
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:07,962
Yeah, Dad, you do that.
Let me know how that works out for you.

291
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:13,862
Hi, um...

292
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:19,743
I don't know if I have the right
address. Does John Rowland live here?

293
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:25,213
I'm really glad you came by.
I was gonna call you again tomorrow.

294
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:28,718
Uh, yeah. I'm sorry
I haven't returned any of your calls.

295
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:33,554
It's OK. I'm just happy to see you.
I heard about Mr. Solis.

296
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:38,790
- It sucks you had to take a job.
- Well, I'll survive.

297
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,694
Come here.

298
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,896
Oh...

299
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:59,479
Oh, no... John...
I didn't come here for that.

300
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:01,075
What's wrong?

301
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:04,883
You're going into gardening full time.
What happened to college?

302
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,016
- I decided not to go.
- Why?

303
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:11,152
Well, an opportunity
has presented itself,

304
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:15,027
and for me to take advantage of it,
I need to start making money.

305
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:20,265
John, what opportunity
is more important than college?

306
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:24,139
For the longest time, the only thing
I had to offer you was my heart.

307
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:27,268
Mr. Solis gave you security
and I couldn't compete.

308
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:30,644
But now he can't offer you that.
I can.

309
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:37,881
My business is taking off. I can
take care of you. We can be together.

310
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:43,751
Mrs. Solis,

311
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,959
will you marry me?

312
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:58,032
Why would you
want to chaperone the dance?

313
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:01,671
Mrs. Van De Kamp needed volunteers.
She begged me.

314
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:04,611
You're so transparent.

315
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:07,151
Anyway, you won't even know I'm there.

316
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:09,345
Well, not too much.

317
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:13,453
- You know you can tell me anything.
- Yeah, Mom.

318
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:17,824
So if you had a problem, or some sort
of secret was weighing on you...?

319
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:22,559
Of course. I tell you everything.

320
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:32,899
I can't believe
you're just uprooting us like this.

321
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:35,037
We need a fresh start.

322
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:38,616
Here.
You wanna get it about like this.

323
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:43,181
So many bad things
have happened around here

324
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:47,247
and finally I have someone I can talk to
and you want to take that away.

325
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:49,860
- You mean Julie?
- Yeah.

326
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:52,453
What bad things
do you talk to her about?

327
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:56,364
- Do you talk about your mother?
- Yeah... and other stuff.

328
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,801
Like what?

329
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:00,963
Zach. Like what?

330
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:08,038
Dad, this is what I've been
trying to talk to you about.

331
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:12,982
Ever since Mom died
I've started to remember things.

332
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:15,144
Just flashes from when I was little.

333
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:17,813
Nice and taut, like this.

334
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:21,150
What kind of things?

335
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:27,491
Lots of blood. Mom screaming.

336
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:32,094
And Dana.

337
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:35,731
I remember killing Dana.

338
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:39,502
You... told this to Julie?

339
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:43,238
I trust her.

340
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:45,441
Did she tell her mother?

341
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:48,075
I don't know.

342
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:53,649
Start from the beginning.

343
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:56,717
Tell me everything that you told Julie.

344
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:14,441
- Hey.
- Hey. What's that?

345
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:17,606
Oh, well,
I was going to give it to you, but

346
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:20,583
I saw the other girls
weren't wearing flowers.

347
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:23,779
I guess it's not that kind of dance.

348
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:27,256
If you don't want to stand out,
I'd understand.

349
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:29,418
I like standing out.

350
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:55,711
What's Paul doing here?

351
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:59,416
He's chaperoning.
He called and volunteered.

352
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:01,219
- Really?
- What's wrong?

353
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:04,353
He could have cared less
about Julie and Zach dating.

354
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:06,522
And now he shows up at the dance?

355
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:08,826
Maybe he's trying to be supportive.

356
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:11,027
Maybe.

357
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:20,744
Dr. Van De Kamp.

358
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:23,508
My cardiologist
phoned in a prescription.

359
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:26,413
Oh, right.
I've got it here somewhere.

360
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:30,947
So, have you seen Bree lately?

361
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:33,820
I ran into her last night
on Maple Avenue.

362
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:39,886
- We had a nice talk.
- Hmm. That's all you did? Just talked?

363
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:42,660
We're just friends.
Nothing more.

364
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:45,065
That's good to hear.

365
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:47,195
If you ever do get a vibe from Bree

366
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:50,400
that she's interested in more
than just friendship,

367
00:26:50,508 --> 00:26:52,840
I'd be careful if I were you.

368
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:54,503
Excuse me?

369
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:59,744
I just want you to know that she'd only
be using you to even the score with me.

370
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:01,877
Don't fall for it.

371
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:05,514
Bree would never do anything like that.
She's a lady.

372
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:09,788
Exactly.
A very beautiful, classy lady.

373
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:15,766
Remember, they tend to end up
with doctors. Not pharmacists.

374
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:25,500
Bree is very beautiful. And very classy.
But she's not very perceptive.

375
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:28,671
For instance,
she thinks you're a good person.

376
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:32,843
And it's now very clear to me,
you aren't.

377
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:39,685
I'd like my prescription now, George.

378
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:53,565
I can't seem to find it.
I guess I'll have to have it delivered.

379
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,572
Thank you.

380
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:59,007
No, thank you.

381
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:30,532
[# Kansas: Dust In The Wind]

382
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:46,785
Paul.

383
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:50,817
Did you notice
they're playing a classic?

384
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:51,953
Yeah.

385
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,832
Care to dance?

386
00:28:58,103 --> 00:29:00,196
I'd love to.

387
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:14,048
- I have a little confession to make.
- Oh?

388
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:16,178
I've been so concerned
about Julie,

389
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:19,814
that I sort of eavesdropped on her
the other day,

390
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:23,485
while she was having
a phone conversation with Zach.

391
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:24,789
Really?

392
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:28,361
They were having
an interesting conversation.

393
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:30,297
About?

394
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:35,668
Zach was telling Julie
about what happened to Dana.

395
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:39,437
- Was he now?
- Yes.

396
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:44,005
- How much did you hear?
- Everything.

397
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:53,014
You realize it was an accident.

398
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,991
Oh, of course. I assumed as much.

399
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,722
He didn't mean to kill Dana.

400
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:05,895
He was practically a baby himself.
He didn't understand what he was doing.

401
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:11,499
No, of course he didn't.
So... what happened exactly?

402
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:15,976
Mary Alice and I never really knew.

403
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:18,481
We heard the baby screaming.

404
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,018
When we got up to the crib,
it was too late.

405
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:23,246
Paul, I am so sorry.

406
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:26,515
Thank you.

407
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:36,526
So you and Mary Alice just kept this
to yourselves all these years?

408
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:42,699
It was a very dark chapter in our lives.
We preferred not to relive it.

409
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:47,972
It was also a private family matter.
I'd appreciate your discretion.

410
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:57,112
Sure.

411
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:15,369
- Did you have a good time?
- Yeah, I did.

412
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:17,532
It was great.

413
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:26,506
Look, I want you to know that
I'm really sorry I talked to Julie.

414
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:29,451
But she promised
not to say anything to her Mom.

415
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:32,614
It's OK. I handled Susan.

416
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,555
Good.

417
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:38,528
But we need to talk about these things
that you think you remember.

418
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:41,429
They're not true.

419
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:44,228
How can they not be true?

420
00:31:44,302 --> 00:31:46,395
Memories lie, Zach.

421
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:50,900
You didn't kill anyone.

422
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,348
Dana is very much alive.

423
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:17,635
- Hi. What are you doing here?
- Where is it?

424
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:21,194
- What?
- The ring. My grandmother's ring.

425
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:24,503
John caught me off guard.
I'm going to give back the ring.

426
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,271
Well, you'd better.
Because make no mistake,

427
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:32,578
if you try to ruin my son's life,
I will ruin yours.

428
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:37,144
Helen! OK, go to the car.
Come on, please. Just... please.

429
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:46,425
Obviously, I'm not leaving my husband
and marrying John.

430
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:48,624
I think that's wise.

431
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,669
I'll talk to John tomorrow
and give back the ring.

432
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:56,001
Good, good. Um...
we appreciate everything you've done.

433
00:32:56,708 --> 00:33:01,645
Hey, Bob,
I get why she's so angry with me.

434
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:04,715
But what I don't
get is why you're so nice.

435
00:33:04,782 --> 00:33:09,014
Well, John's a big boy. Whatever
happened between the two of you

436
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:11,988
was his mistake as much as yours.

437
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:17,494
I guess. I understand if, uh,
if you hate me just a little.

438
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:36,309
When I was a kid, I always played
by the rules. I never cheated on a test.

439
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:41,318
Never even missed a curfew.
But I can't help but think

440
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:48,557
how wonderful it would have been to have
made at least one mistake like you.

441
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:53,992
That's... sweet.
You... you're very sweet.

442
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:57,067
Well, I'm a little sweet.

443
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:02,139
Mostly I'm just middle-aged.

444
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:26,395
Are you OK? I know
this is a lot to digest all at once.

445
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:30,366
I'm fine. I'm just happy
you finally told me the truth.

446
00:34:32,937 --> 00:34:37,567
One thing, though.
Why are you telling me all this now?

447
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:41,635
I couldn't let you think
you killed someone.

448
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:44,214
No one should carry that kind of burden.

449
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:47,718
- You didn't want me running my mouth.
- That's not what it's about.

450
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:49,184
Yes, it is.

451
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:55,856
I won't tell anyone.
I'll keep your secret.

452
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:02,565
- Dad?
- Thank you.

453
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,260
But we're not moving.

454
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:08,897
That's out of the question.

455
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:15,411
I'm not leaving Julie. And if you
want my support, that's the deal.

456
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:18,141
- And if I refuse?
- You won't.

457
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:37,794
So here's the thing; I feel
really awful about how I acted before.

458
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:40,667
You threw me out of my own house.

459
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:43,901
I overreacted. I know. I'm sorry.

460
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:52,175
Look, I know you love my mom. But how
she decides to live her life is just...

461
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,343
it's entirely up to her.

462
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:59,151
You're right. You're right. I guess
I just got so upset because...

463
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,953
Oh, whatever.
Let's not beat a dead horse.

464
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:07,225
It's over. I'm sorry. Good night.

465
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:15,395
OK. Get it off your chest.

466
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:18,703
You knew he was having a affair
and it didn't bother you.

467
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:23,577
And that worries me because
if you can condone something like that,

468
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:28,118
then what's gonna happen when you've
been on the road for 40 years?

469
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:31,677
Lynette, I'm not my father.

470
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:35,021
I know. Of course.
You're not your father.

471
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:46,133
And just so we're absolutely clear,
I am definitely not your mother.

472
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:49,071
Because if you ever betray me,
I will leave you.

473
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:53,509
I will take the kids,
and you will never see any of us again.

474
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:59,848
Whew. Glad to get that off my chest.
Thank you. I love you.

475
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:11,926
- Couldn't sleep, huh?
- No.

476
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:17,093
Me either.
I'm sorry about the ruckus I caused.

477
00:37:17,201 --> 00:37:21,501
It's OK. I'm not...
I'm not upset about that.

478
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:23,699
- No?
- No.

479
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,241
What's wrong?

480
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:31,941
There's something Lynette doesn't know.

481
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:34,176
Something that I did.

482
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:37,949
And I don't know what's gonna happen
if she ever finds out.

483
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:48,894
The next morning, Gabrielle returned the
engagement ring to her former lover.

484
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:51,400
A gesture that was met with

485
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:53,266
measured enthusiasm.

486
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:56,329
- Please, calm down.
- This doesn't make any sense.

487
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,341
- I know you love me.
- Love isn't enough.

488
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:03,880
Where would we live? Here? The only
decoration in the bathroom is a bong.

489
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:07,781
- We could get our own place.
- You're barely making minimum wage.

490
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:10,320
We'd be poor at first.
But we'd be happy.

491
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:14,119
I've tried "poor but happy".
Guess what? I wasn't that happy.

492
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:18,628
But Mr. Solis is going to jail.
You want to stick around for that?

493
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:23,360
I don't know. You know, every once in a
while even I want to do the right thing.

494
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:30,498
Mrs. Solis, I love you so much. I mean,
doesn't that mean anything to you?

495
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:37,046
Honestly? No.

496
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:40,447
John, you're a toy. A sweet dumb toy.

497
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:43,646
So you might as well go to college,
because you and me,

498
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:45,780
no future.

499
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:56,861
Mrs. Mayer. Hey, is Julie home?

500
00:38:56,934 --> 00:38:59,027
She's in the shower.

501
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:02,594
Well, I just came by to give her
some good news.

502
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:05,107
What's that?

503
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:08,701
It turns out my that
my dad and I aren't moving after all.

504
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:10,576
- What?
- He reconsidered.

505
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:14,082
So I guess we're gonna keep
living across the street.

506
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:17,143
OK. Wow. Um...

507
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,914
Wow.

508
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:23,721
You know, uh, can you sit down?
I... I need to talk to you.

509
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,190
Hey...

510
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:38,505
Did you know that Julie is
the first girl I ever gave a flower to?

511
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:40,702
- Really?
- Yeah.

512
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:43,810
Yeah, I... I really like her,
Mrs. Mayer.

513
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:46,641
Zach, um...

514
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:50,417
Julie is only 14 years old.

515
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:54,321
And sometimes girls, when they're
that age, they just don't

516
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:57,884
always make the right decisions.

517
00:39:57,962 --> 00:40:02,831
As her mother,
it is my responsibility to protect her.

518
00:40:02,933 --> 00:40:06,300
You want to protect her from me?

519
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:12,798
No, I... I just... I think
that you should slow things down.

520
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:16,335
I... I... I want you
to not see her for a while.

521
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:20,147
No.

522
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:24,153
- No?
- You're not taking her away from me.

523
00:40:24,221 --> 00:40:28,954
I know being dramatic is the birthright
of every teenager, but come on.

524
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:32,553
Why are you laughing?
Do you think this is funny?

525
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:37,663
Thank you, you have just made this
really easy for me.

526
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:41,295
You are forbidden from seeing
or talking to Julie ever again.

527
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:46,469
If you come within ten feet of her,
I will have you arrested. Now get out.

528
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:15,672
Sooner or later the time comes

529
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:19,334
when we all must become
responsible adults...

530
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:28,810
...and learn to give up what we want,
so we can choose to do what is right.

531
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:37,883
Of course, a lifetime
of responsibility isn't always easy.

532
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:46,762
And as the years go on,

533
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:50,796
it's a burden that can become
too heavy for some to bear.

534
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:57,974
But still we try to do what is best.
What is good. Not only for ourselves.

535
00:41:58,115 --> 00:42:00,174
But for those we love.

536
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:10,349
- Hey.
- I'm glad you came.

537
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:14,727
Zach, I can't stay long.
If my mom catches me, she'll freak.

538
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:16,891
Come here.

539
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:26,669
She said I can't see you anymore.
What are we gonna do?

540
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:28,803
I'm not sure.

541
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:38,850
Yes, sooner of later,
we must all become responsible adults.

542
00:42:38,923 --> 00:42:42,654
No one knows this better than the young.
