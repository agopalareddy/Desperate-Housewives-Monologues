<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>

2
00:00:01,468 --> 00:00:02,799
Anybody home?

3
00:00:02,869 --> 00:00:05,838
Previously on Desperate Housewives...

4
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:08,703
- Susan played with fire...
- That's not my cup.

5
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:10,072
And could get burned.

6
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:12,872
Go to a spa, go shopping.
Find a way to relax.

7
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:17,246
- Gabrielle... found herself a playmate.
- Get here as fast as you can.

8
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:20,184
Lynette couldn't get her kids
to stop playing.

9
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:22,949
- Do you know why I pulled you over?
- I have a theory.

10
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:27,756
If I don't get some sleep, I'll be
forced back upstairs out of exhaustion.

11
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:30,227
And Bre played hard ball.

12
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,094
Everyone has a little dirty laundry.

13
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:41,163
When I was alive, I maintained
many different identities.

14
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:46,008
Lover, wife and, ultimately, victim.

15
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,415
Yes, labels are important to the living.
They dictate how people se themselves.

16
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:53,281
Like my friend Lynette.

17
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:58,016
She used to se herself as a carer
woman, and a hugely successful one.

18
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:02,891
She was known for her power lunches,

19
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:05,089
her eye-catching presentations,

20
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:08,793
and her ruthlessness
in wiping out the competition.

21
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:13,394
But Lynette gave up
her carer to assume a new label.

22
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:18,603
The incredibly satisfying role
of full-time mother.

23
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:21,306
[Phone rings]

24
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:24,612
Scavo residence. Yes, this is me.

25
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,047
[Sighs]

26
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:30,983
But, unfortunately for Lynette,

27
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:35,858
this new label frequently
fell short of what was advertised.

28
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:42,266
How in the world did they...?

29
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:46,101
I left the door to the art supply
cupboard open for five minutes.

30
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:48,470
That's all. Five minutes.

31
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:52,204
The little girl,
why didn't she say anything?

32
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:54,872
Your boys work quickly.

33
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:59,476
Well, obviously they will be
punished for this severely.

34
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:04,319
I hesitate bringing this up, since you
got so ugly about it last time...

35
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:08,121
They don't have Attention Deficit
Disorder, and I won't drug my boys

36
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:11,425
just to make your job easier.

37
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:12,988
I'd rather change teachers.

38
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:17,695
They're in my class because I'm
the only teacher who can handle them.

39
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:23,202
What if we separate the twins,
put them in different classes?

40
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:26,575
They're calmer when they're not
bouncing off one another.

41
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:29,774
We can try that,
but if it doesn't work,

42
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:34,012
we may no longer
be able to accommodate them.

43
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,782
It suddenly occurred to Lynette,

44
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:39,347
her label was about
to change yet again.

45
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:44,062
And for the next few years,
she would be known as

46
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:49,625
the mother of the boys
who painted Tiffany Axelrod blue.

47
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:43,818
It looked to be an interesting
afternoon on Wisteria Lane.

48
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:48,121
A mysterious cassette tape had ben
discovered by my friend Bre.

49
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:50,890
She had stolen it
from her marriage counselor.

50
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:55,799
A counselor I'd once spoken to
in strictest confidence.

51
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,994
[Goldfine] How have you ben?

52
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:01,234
- I had the nightmare again.
- It's weird to hear Mary Alice.

53
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:03,832
- Still the same one?
- Yes.

54
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:09,906
But this time I was standing in a river
and I saw the girl under the water.

55
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:13,578
She kept screaming "Angela"
over and over again.

56
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:17,952
What do you think the significance
of the name "Angela" is?

57
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,254
Actually, that's my real name.

58
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:22,794
Her real name?

59
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:28,496
I've seen her driver's license.
I did not say Angela.

60
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:31,968
- What does the rest of the tape say?
- More about her nightmares,

61
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:34,802
and this girl she was afraid of.

62
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:38,138
So what the hell do we do now?

63
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,919
I think we should show Paul the note.

64
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:53,288
Are you sure? He's gonna freak.

65
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:54,758
It's now or never.

66
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:59,662
I saw what he's asking for the place.
It's gonna sell quickly.

67
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:02,667
Can I say something?

68
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,999
- I'm glad Paul's moving.
- Gabby.

69
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:08,267
I'm sorry. He's just always
given my the creeps.

70
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:12,471
Haven't you guys noticed,
he has this dark thing going on?

71
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:14,672
Something about him just feels...

72
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:17,375
- Malignant?
- Yes.

73
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,849
We've all sort of felt it.

74
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:28,387
That being said, I do love
what he's done with that lawn.

75
00:07:15,576 --> 00:07:19,000
- Mom, the dish is clean.
- Huh? Oh.

76
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,714
I don't understand why you don't just
ask him out on an official date date.

77
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:54,912
I'm trying a new strategy.
I'm playing hard to get.

78
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,956
- How long can keep that up?
- Maybe until noon.

79
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:02,290
Then I'm going to have to run over there
and beg him to love me.

80
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:06,161
Uh, Mom, I don't think you're
gonna be able to wait that long.

81
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:13,469
You got to be kidding.
She washed her car yesterday.

82
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:28,045
Oh, no, she's not.

83
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:32,914
Yep, she's bringing out the big guns.

84
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:46,467
You better get over there.
She's wearing cotton.

85
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:52,636
What do I say? "I saw you half-naked
and I thought I'd drop by"?

86
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:55,873
- What's that?
- Mike's junk mail we got by mistake.

87
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:59,884
I held onto it
in case of an emergency.

88
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:01,783
God bless you.

89
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:18,168
- Hi.
- Hey, Susan.

90
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:20,762
We got this by mistake.

91
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:22,841
Oh, thanks.

92
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:25,835
I hope it's not important.

93
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:29,473
No, it's just a promotion
for the Rialto film festival.

94
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:31,517
Oh.

95
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:36,548
Well, I guess I've done
my good deed for the day.

96
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:40,082
I'll just head back home.

97
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:45,163
Bye.

98
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:48,200
- Hey, you like old movies?
- I love old movies.

99
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:59,004
I hate Susan Mayer.

100
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:03,310
Every time I see those big doe eyes
of hers, I swear to God

101
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:06,078
I just want to go out and shoot a deer.

102
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:08,153
What has she done this time?

103
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:13,385
She is out there throwing herself
at Mike Delfino, again.

104
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:20,023
- Susan likes Mike?
- Where the hell have you been, Martha?

105
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:24,331
She's been lusting after him
ever since he moved in.

106
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,111
I got your message. What's going on?

107
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,444
The boys refuse to be separated.

108
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:40,475
They refuse? [scoffs]
They're six years old. Make them.

109
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:45,686
The school regulations are pretty strict
about me wrestling with the boys.

110
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:49,693
But if you want to give it a shot,
be my guest.

111
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:51,922
Fine.

112
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:56,766
Oh, which one goes
and which one stays?

113
00:08:57,837 --> 00:09:00,067
You pick.

114
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:06,308
[Indistinct shouts
from boys and Lynette]

115
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:10,277
[Lynette] Come on now. Stop it! No. No.

116
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:18,149
I'm gonna take the whole table.
That's right.

117
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:20,485
- Ooh.
- Come on now. I mean it.

118
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:30,400
I love taking baths.
Especially with you.

119
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:33,700
It's like taking a vacation
from the world.

120
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:36,264
I hated taking baths when I was a kid.

121
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:40,778
Of course, back then, the only thing
I had to play with was my rubber ducky.

122
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:43,178
- [Doorbell]
- Who's that?

123
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:44,476
It's Mr. Solis.

124
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:49,987
Relax. Carlos is at work
and he doesn't ring the doorbell.

125
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,629
It's the cable guy.
He's three hours late.

126
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,001
Use the side entrance.

127
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:07,664
Gabrielle knew her vacation
from the world had ended.

128
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:13,303
What she didn't know was
John had left behind a souvenir.

129
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:18,213
Dad didn't come home last night.

130
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:20,979
- They had a fight. A bad one.
- How bad?

131
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,281
Like divorce court bad.

132
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,616
[Humming]

133
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:31,527
Listen to her. She always
overcompensates when she's worried.

134
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:35,590
If Dad moves out and leaves us
with her, I'll lose my mind.

135
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:39,427
[Sighs contentedly]
Dinner is on the table.

136
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,406
Mom, where did Dad go last night?

137
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:48,537
He got a last minute call to speak at
a medical conference in Philadelphia.

138
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:50,104
Take your seats.

139
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,584
- [Sighs]
- This marriage is so over.

140
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:08,132
Andrew?

141
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:17,508
Sorry I was late.
The scheduler overbooked me.

142
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:20,101
- How long are you going to be?
- Almost done.

143
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:24,046
What is that scent? Is that sage
and citrus? That's amazing.

144
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:27,677
Try to hurry. I have stuff to do.

145
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:35,151
Come on.

146
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:52,840
What's happening?

147
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:57,177
The cable guy fell. He hit his head
on the tub. He may have a concussion.

148
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:59,911
- It's almost eight.
- He was late.

149
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,805
- Mrs. Huber.
- Hello, Susan. I made you a pie.

150
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,777
Oh, wow! Why?

151
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:30,213
Do I need a motive
to do something nice?

152
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:36,387
I can't wait for you
to try this. It's mincemeat.

153
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:41,552
- Actually, I just had dinner.
- That's OK. You can save it for later.

154
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:45,463
What's so funny?

155
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:49,627
I was just thinking of that expression,
"I'll make mincemeat out of you".

156
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:53,297
Mincemeat used to be
an entrée of mostly chopped meat,

157
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:54,929
so it was like saying,

158
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:59,808
"I'll chop you up into little bits."
But that was centuries ago.

159
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:05,851
Today, mincemeat is mostly made
of fruit, spices and rum.

160
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:10,718
There's no meat in it and still people
say, "I'll make mincemeat out of you."

161
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:14,919
- People don't really say that anymore.
- I do.

162
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:19,259
- So, Susan, how are you?
- I'm fine.

163
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:25,098
Good. You know,
I have a confession to make.

164
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:28,231
I wish I'd been more
supportive when Karl left you.

165
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:32,640
Oh, you don't have to apologize about
Karl. Really, Karl and I are over.

166
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:34,736
- I've moved on.
- I know.

167
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:40,080
You've moved on to that nice Mike
Delfino. He's quite a catch, isn't he?

168
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:46,119
- You like him, don't you?
- Ah, sure, as a friend.

169
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:48,989
Oh, Susan.

170
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:53,657
Being coy is a strategy best employed
by virgins at their first dance.

171
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:57,395
For women of our age,
it's just annoying.

172
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:02,338
- You sure you don't want pie?
- No, thank you.

173
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:07,640
I hope it works out with you and Mike.
You've been so desperate to land him.

174
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:10,807
What? I am not desperate.

175
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:14,182
Good lord, Susan,
you burned your rival's house down.

176
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:18,917
If that isn't desperate,
I don't know what is.

177
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:22,619
Mrs. Huber, with all due respect,
you're crazy.

178
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:33,233
- What's that?
- I think you recognize it.

179
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:35,773
I found it in the ruins of Edie's home.

180
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:43,841
- Well, that's not...
- Shh. My point is this.

181
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:46,941
I wasn't there for you when Karl left,
but I am now.

182
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:50,113
As far as I'm concerned,
this is our secret.

183
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,782
And no one ever need know.

184
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:54,951
Oh, Susan.

185
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:59,559
You don't know how good it feels
to finally be able to help you.

186
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,594
You look so pale.

187
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:08,834
Now, I insist you try some of my pie.

188
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:12,501
Go on.

189
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:19,510
Did I mention it's mincemeat?

190
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,485
[Audible gulp]

191
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,694
- Open the door, please.
- Hang on.

192
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:36,963
- What?
- May I come in?

193
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:39,230
- No.
- I want to talk to you.

194
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:43,671
- Then talk.
- Where were you last night?

195
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:47,444
- Brian's.
- I just spoke to Brian's mother.

196
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:51,174
Tell me again where you were,
and this time don't lie to me.

197
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:57,021
Where did you say Dad
was again? In Philadelphia?

198
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:58,954
Andrew, don't change the subject.

199
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:01,618
Sorry, I thought
the subject was telling lies.

200
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:04,993
I called Dad's cell phone.
I know he moved out.

201
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:09,260
Well, it's just temporary and...

202
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,729
...I thought it would upset you.

203
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,534
Whatever. You lied.

204
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,167
So stop pretending like you
have some sort of moral authority.

205
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:20,871
Just because I don't share
my problems with you

206
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:22,914
doesn't give you the right to be rude.

207
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:27,281
How about driving my father away.
Do I get to be rude then?

208
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:15,757
- Hi.
- What's this?

209
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,166
- It's a sock.
- It's a man's sock.

210
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:20,728
I found it under our bed.
It's not mine.

211
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:24,173
Oh, for God sakes, Carlos,
it's Yao Lin's.

212
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:26,403
Our maid wears size 13 gym socks?

213
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:28,673
No, she dusts with them.

214
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:31,506
[Stutters]

215
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:34,579
[Eexasperated sigh]

216
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:38,854
See? Socks instead of rags.

217
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:02,473
- Susan, hello.
- Mrs. Huber.

218
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:06,909
Did you and Mike come together?
I saw him in the fresh produce aisle.

219
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:09,283
No. Like I told you.
We're just friends.

220
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:10,855
Oh.

221
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:15,693
By the way, if I didn't
make it clear yesterday,

222
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:19,993
I absolutely did not do
that thing you accuse me of.

223
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,397
Hey, Susan. Hey, Mrs. Huber.

224
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:26,427
- Nice to see you, Mike.
- Hey.

225
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:30,965
You like Alfred Hitchcock? They're
doing a retrospective at the Rialto.

226
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:36,114
Uh...

227
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:38,547
...I'm not really a fan.

228
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,586
[Laughs] Come on,
how can you not like Hitchcock?

229
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,518
I just, uh, don't.

230
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:50,726
Oh. OK.

231
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:56,998
Well, uh, nice to see you.
You too, Mrs. Huber.

232
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:04,765
You're so silly. Pretending not
to like him on my account.

233
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:06,140
I mean, really.

234
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:10,477
- Will you just drop it?
- You shouldn't be rude to me.

235
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:14,315
Your secret is not
an easy burden to bear.

236
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:17,320
That insurance company
is putting Edie through hell.

237
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:19,653
- But still I've said nothing.
- Well...

238
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:24,719
The longer it takes for her payment,
the longer she'll be staying with me.

239
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:29,199
Eating me out of house and home.
Using up my hot water.

240
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:34,865
What exactly is it
you want from me, Mrs. Huber?

241
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:44,682
Are these together?

242
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,151
Ring it up.

243
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:09,633
If the school and the pediatrician
think the twins could be medicated,

244
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,733
then what's the problem?

245
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,971
I used to run a company with 85 people,

246
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:17,812
and now I can't wrangle three small boys
without doping them?

247
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:21,216
- Talk about feeling like a failure.
- You are a great mother.

248
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:26,383
But, let's face it,
your kids are a challenge.

249
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:30,952
Thank you. That's the nicest way
you could've said that.

250
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:33,691
When they're not making me
want to tear my hair out,

251
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:36,325
they're actually really sweet.

252
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:40,837
I'm afraid if I change the bad stuff,
I'm going to change the good stuff.

253
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:44,239
- It's a tough call.
- Like this mug.

254
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:50,305
I love this mug. If I medicate them,
will they still make me a mug like this?

255
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:56,343
- You know, it's leaking.
- Yeah, I know.

256
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:02,018
We talked to Paul. We told him
we need to show him something.

257
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,187
He's on his way over.

258
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,693
So, Paul, we notice that
you're selling the house.

259
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:14,535
Yes, too many painful memories.
I'm sure you understand.

260
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:22,904
Before you move, there's
something you should know.

261
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:28,043
It seems there may be more to Mary
Alice's death than you are aware of.

262
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,815
Oh?

263
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:33,482
Remember when you asked us
to pack her things?

264
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:37,358
- When we did we found a note.
- And we think you should have it.

265
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:44,430
You can see from the postmark, Mary
Alice probably got it the day she died.

266
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:13,220
- Paul, are you going to be OK?
- No.

267
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:43,156
- Have you always cleaned with socks?
- Yes.

268
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:49,058
- What is that, a Japanese thing?
- I am Chinese.

269
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:00,678
- I don't like lying.
- Yeah?

270
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:04,010
I don't like your ironing, so there.

271
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:23,259
- What are you doing here?
- Carlos found this under the bed.

272
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:25,626
Oh, crap.

273
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:28,501
It's OK. It was close call,
but I managed to cover.

274
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:30,473
I got you these, so from now on,

275
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:34,534
we can't let Carlos see you wearing
anything resembling a gym sock.

276
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:38,413
You want me to mow your lawn
in sandals. I could lose a toe.

277
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:42,453
Imagine what you'd lose if he finds
out you're trimming more than the hedge.

278
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:44,215
Uh... yeah.

279
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:47,790
Why are your friends staring at me?

280
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,224
- Did you tell them about us?
- No.

281
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:54,127
They're staring 'cause
they think you're hot.

282
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:57,635
Oh... OK. [giggles]

283
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:06,100
It's 9.30.
What is your brother thinking?

284
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:09,908
[Sighs] Want my advice? Call Dad.
Tell him to go kick Andrew's ass.

285
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:13,212
I am perfectly capable of handling this
without your father.

286
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:17,085
- I'm sorry.
- Where's your cell phone?

287
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:22,758
- Call Andrew. Find out where he is.
- He'll know you're behind this.

288
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:25,455
He won't. Just act normal.

289
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:31,257
Hey, it's me. Ah, what's going on?

290
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:35,533
He knows.

291
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:39,043
This is your mother.

292
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:43,206
I am rapidly reaching the end
of my patience with you.

293
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:47,047
Where are you?
Are you at a bar?

294
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:49,813
Andrew? Andrew?

295
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:55,185
- Mom?
- He hung up on me.

296
00:24:56,795 --> 00:24:59,355
What are you gonna do?

297
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:30,220
[Wolf whistles]

298
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,533
[Man] Shake it, baby!

299
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:44,074
Over here!

300
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:51,008
Heath. Lan. Andrew.

301
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:55,951
Mom, how did you even
know I was here?

302
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:01,721
- You went in my room?
- You think that's bad?

303
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:05,455
Tomorrow morning, I'm cleaning it.
Oh, by the way, Heath.

304
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:09,296
That was a lovely solo
last week at church.

305
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:12,698
Thank you. We're out of here.

306
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:17,335
I hope it wasn't something I said.

307
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:22,205
Well, Andrew, shall we?

308
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:26,278
You just humiliated me
in front of my friends.

309
00:26:26,384 --> 00:26:29,547
- I'm not going anywhere with you.
- Fine.

310
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:36,349
- What are you doing?
- Staying for the show.

311
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:39,225
I'm dying to see
what all the fuss is about.

312
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:42,425
Excuse me, I'll have
a glass of your house chardonnay.

313
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:44,627
Of course, ma'am.

314
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:53,508
I'm curious. As you fantasize
about this woman,

315
00:26:53,578 --> 00:26:57,036
do you ever stop and think
how she came to be on this runway?

316
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,640
That's someone's little girl.

317
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:02,515
And that someone probably
had a lot of dreams for her.

318
00:27:02,587 --> 00:27:05,613
Dreams that did not include
a thong and a pole.

319
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:09,421
It's not going to work, OK?
I'm not budging.

320
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:11,985
God knows what
she's had to deal with in life.

321
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:16,726
Abject poverty, drugs, domestic
violence, maybe even molestation.

322
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,428
Mom!

323
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:21,904
Now she treats herself the way
men treat her. Like an object.

324
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:24,407
A piece of meat.

325
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:27,137
That does it. Kid, get her out of here.

326
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:30,373
She's killing it for the rest of us.

327
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:40,256
[Susan's voice] We're not here,
leave a message.

328
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:44,955
It's Mrs. Huber, Susan, are you there?
I can se your lights are on.

329
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:50,592
I hope you're not screning. That's so
tacky. Listen. I ned to talk to you.

330
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:55,038
My water heaterjust burst
and it's gonna cost $600 for a new one.

331
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,141
And I can't afford that.

332
00:27:57,242 --> 00:28:01,201
I'm just beside myself.
Call me as soon as you get in.

333
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:10,187
Julie, honey, wake up.
We need to talk.

334
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:16,625
- Can't this wait until morning?
- I think I'm being blackmailed.

335
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:21,165
And when I realized
I couldn't put out the fire, I ran.

336
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:23,530
I must've dropped
the measuring cup.

337
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:26,296
Why do I even let you out of the house?

338
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:28,133
I can't let her get away with this.

339
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,766
The only thing to do
is go to the police.

340
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:32,309
You can't do that.

341
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:35,403
I don't think
they'll throw me in jail.

342
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,141
It was an accident.

343
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:40,343
Dad won't care if it was an accident.

344
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:44,320
He'll just use this
as an excuse to reopen custody.

345
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:49,559
- Mom, I don't want to live with Dad.
- I know.

346
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:09,939
- I need to talk to you.
- Cool. Sure.

347
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:15,314
- You were working Tuesday, right?
- Yeah.

348
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:19,352
You remember the cable guy showing up?

349
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:22,620
And you usually work till
what time, five?

350
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:24,525
Yeah.

351
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:29,025
Damn it. That means
he was in the house for four hours.

352
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:35,303
Wait. Now that I think about it,
I might not have seen him.

353
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:38,967
Either you saw him or you didn't.
Which is it?

354
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:41,136
I didn't.

355
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:44,877
John...

356
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,943
...did my wife ask you to lie for her?

357
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:55,857
Mr. Solis, uh... I really don't want
to get in the middle of anything.

358
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:03,260
Thank you.
That's all I needed to know.

359
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:15,272
- Let's run through it one more time.
- Mom, it's not brain surgery.

360
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:18,315
You stand guard, I crawl
through Mrs. Huber's doggy door.

361
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:21,009
Once inside, I find
the measuring cup. Simple.

362
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:24,452
I hate that I'm turning you
into a little thief.

363
00:30:25,256 --> 00:30:28,157
It's our cup.
We're just taking back what's ours.

364
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:34,254
That's right. Ethically,
we have nothing to be ashamed about.

365
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:38,699
Oh. Wear these. I don't want you
to leave finger prints.

366
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:48,305
There she goes. OK. Move.

367
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:54,077
Oh, so glad to be playing Frisbee again.
Here you go. Coming at ya.

368
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:57,519
All right. Back up a little more.
There you go.

369
00:30:57,589 --> 00:31:00,387
Whoo! All right. Here we go.

370
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:07,564
Oh, my, whoops! You better go
get that. Yeah. Hah!

371
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:19,737
- Mike.
- Hey, Susan. I thought that was you.

372
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:23,770
Uh... Yeah. Julie and I are out
tossing a Frisbee around,

373
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:26,146
and it flew off
into Mrs. Huber's back yard.

374
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:29,448
- Oh, you need some help?
- No, no, no. Julie's got it.

375
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:35,525
OK. I'm glad I ran into you. I wanted to
make sure things were OK between us.

376
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:39,620
- The other day, you seemed distant.
- Distant? What do you mean?

377
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:43,531
I mean, you're not mad at me
for some reason, are you?

378
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:46,763
No. No, not at all.

379
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:49,636
Good.
'Cause I'm gonna take one more shot.

380
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:53,336
I got tickets for a Billy Wilder
retrospective, Wednesday night.

381
00:31:53,411 --> 00:32:00,044
- I'd love to take you with me.
- You are so sweet. I'd love to go.

382
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:02,484
All right.

383
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,825
Edie, I thought you'd be at work.

384
00:32:09,894 --> 00:32:15,764
I'm not feeling well. I got a sunburn
the other day washing my car.

385
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:20,668
Well, don't just run off.
Come and hang out with us.

386
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:23,206
- Boy, you are one sick ticket.
- What?

387
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:27,571
It's not bad enough I have to watch you
throw yourself at him every day.

388
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,512
Now you want to make sure
I see it up close and personal?

389
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:33,106
- No, it's not like that.
- I've got to take off.

390
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:35,914
I'll call about Wednesday night, OK?

391
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:38,916
Edie, wait.

392
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:41,150
Uh... [sigh]

393
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:45,290
Mike and I were gonna go see
the movies on Wednesday

394
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:48,025
and I thought it would be fun
if you joined us.

395
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:51,830
- You want me to come with you?
- Yeah.

396
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:55,999
- Yeah, that's OK, isn't it, Mike?
- Well, it's a limited engagement.

397
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:59,840
And it's sold out.
I've only got two tickets.

398
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:04,314
Edie, wait.
You should take my ticket.

399
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:10,947
Really? Is that OK with you, Mike?

400
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:15,723
Uh, yeah, sure.

401
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:21,990
So, uh, what time
do you want to pick me up?

402
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:25,932
Well, um...

403
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:28,767
[Edie and Mike continue indistinct]

404
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:44,711
- [Knock on door]
- Hang on.

405
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:52,253
[Groans]

406
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:55,891
You think you can have sex
with anyone you want, huh?

407
00:33:57,268 --> 00:34:00,669
Carlos couldn't help
but fel proud of himself.

408
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:04,640
After all,
he'd just defended his honor.

409
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:06,141
Or had he?

410
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:13,848
[Cable guy groaning]

411
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:25,888
- Are you gay?
- Yes. Is that why you're doing this?

412
00:34:27,965 --> 00:34:30,092
Uh... yeah.

413
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:39,807
"...will you buy some chocolates?"

414
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,344
Ladies.

415
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:44,942
Hey, Paul, what's up?

416
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:47,712
I wanted to apologize
for my outburst yesterday.

417
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:50,845
Don't worry about it.
We unloaded a lot on you.

418
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:54,584
I suppose you're wondering why
I reacted so violently to that note.

419
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,752
It did... cross our minds.

420
00:34:56,894 --> 00:35:00,762
Well, the truth is,
Mary Alice was not a well person.

421
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:02,957
She was very troubled.

422
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:07,398
- Troubled?
- At first it was harmless.

423
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:09,770
She'd leave herself notes,
reminders like,

424
00:35:09,907 --> 00:35:13,741
"Pick up the milk" or
"Zach has a dentist appointment."

425
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:17,713
But over time the notes became ugly.
Hateful messages started showing up.

426
00:35:17,815 --> 00:35:22,184
Mary Alice was writing them to me,
to Zach, to herself.

427
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:25,619
- Really?
- That's why I lost it.

428
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:28,989
I was reminded of what
Zach and I had been through.

429
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:33,362
- Paul, I'm so sorry.
- We had no idea.

430
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:34,522
No.

431
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,167
Anyway, I'd appreciate it
if you kept this to yourselves.

432
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,298
Yeah.

433
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:45,433
- For Zach's sake.
- Of course. Of course.

434
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:47,805
Bye.

435
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:53,142
- Wow.
- Yeah.

436
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:56,345
- I think he's lying.
- Huh. So do I.

437
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:04,090
[Boys making airplane noises]

438
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,942
Bang! Bang! Bang!

439
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:22,479
You didn't get me! Bang! Bang!

440
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:33,856
Boys, could you get in here, please?

441
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:37,055
- He broke my plane.
- Did not.

442
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:39,994
We'll discuss that later.
I need you to take medicine.

443
00:36:40,097 --> 00:36:45,057
- Are we sick?
- Not exactly. This is special medicine.

444
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:48,332
It's like a vitamin
and you'll take it every day, OK?

445
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:50,237
Oops.

446
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:53,833
Stay right there.

447
00:36:59,116 --> 00:37:01,676
[Boys chuckle]

448
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:07,482
- Now open up.
- Uh-uh.

449
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:10,083
- Here, you...
- No.

450
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:14,427
- Guys, this is a... Guys, here...
- Nope.

451
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:22,539
In that moment,
Lynette made a decision.

452
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:25,303
When it came to
dealing with her children,

453
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:29,436
medication was no longer an option.

454
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:33,843
Of course, given her continuing level
of frustration,

455
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:38,684
Lynette also felt a little
self-medication couldn't hurt.

456
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:49,728
So what's your strategy?

457
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,531
Are you just never gonna
speak to me again?

458
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:56,937
Something like that.

459
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:58,407
[Sighs]

460
00:37:58,476 --> 00:38:00,444
I suppose I do owe you an apology.

461
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:04,277
Careful. I wouldn't want you
to strain yourself.

462
00:38:04,348 --> 00:38:06,748
I shouldn't have lied
about your father.

463
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:10,480
You two are old enough to handle
the truth and I'm sorry.

464
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:12,488
Keep going.

465
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:15,184
I'm mad at you
for about 7,000 other things.

466
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:19,525
If you think I'll apologize for taking
you out of a strip club, you're wrong.

467
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:23,556
I consider it one of my finest moments.

468
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:29,897
[Sighs] Oh, Andrew.

469
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:33,841
I know you blame me
for what's happening with your father,

470
00:38:33,911 --> 00:38:37,347
but it's not entirely my fault
and I need you to understand that.

471
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:43,317
I do.

472
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:47,323
I just... don't want him to leave.

473
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:56,293
Neither do I.

474
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:58,665
- Mom.
- Yeah?

475
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:02,405
When can I have my door back?

476
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:08,443
- Three months.
- [Groans]

477
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:11,003
Royal Oaks was the scene
of a hate crime today.

478
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:15,451
Jonathan Lisco, local gay activist
and part-time female impersonator,

479
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:17,453
was brutally attacked in his home.

480
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:21,480
Lisco speculated the attack
was in response to his efforts

481
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:25,518
to secure same-sex partner insurance
coverage from his employer,

482
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:26,960
Cliffside Cable.

483
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:30,261
Police are circulating
this sketch of the assailant.

484
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:33,064
[Lisco] The circumstances
speak for themselves.

485
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:36,196
I've taken a strong stance
with my company.

486
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:38,775
Is there something
you want to ask me?

487
00:39:40,244 --> 00:39:42,371
No.

488
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,215
You took it, didn't you?

489
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:03,189
- Good evening, Mrs. Huber.
- It's my fault for not hiding the cup.

490
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:07,397
If you're capable of arson, you're
capable of breaking and entering.

491
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:10,633
I don't know what
you're talking about.

492
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,675
I suppose you destroyed it.

493
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:19,809
Again, I don't know what
you're talking about, but... yeah, I did.

494
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:25,817
I was going to keep your secret.
It's a shame you couldn't trust me.

495
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:30,224
You're a piece of work.
Do you know that?

496
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:32,854
Oh, Susan, let's not be unpleasant.

497
00:40:32,997 --> 00:40:37,058
We can go back to the same friendly
relationship we've always had.

498
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,769
I will keep my lawn looking nice.

499
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,273
And make sure my music
isn't played too loud.

500
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:47,742
And if I get some of your mail,
heck, I'll run it right over,

501
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:50,405
'cause that's what good neighbors do.

502
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:54,144
But from now on,
when I run into you on the street,

503
00:40:54,218 --> 00:40:58,780
and I say, "Good morning, Mrs. Huber"
or "How are you, Mrs. Huber?"

504
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:01,916
Just know that inside

505
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:06,929
I am quietly
but decidedly hating your guts.

506
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:14,095
Careful, dear, let's not say things
we'll live to regret.

507
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:19,541
Good evening, Mrs. Huber.

508
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,245
He actually said
Mary Alice was crazy?

509
00:41:32,356 --> 00:41:34,916
Not in so many words,
but everything Paul said

510
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:37,085
made it seem
like she was schizophrenic.

511
00:41:37,194 --> 00:41:39,526
I think he's hiding something.
I know it.

512
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:43,294
But wait, what about the tape?
She did say her name was Angela.

513
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:46,064
Mary Alice was not crazy.

514
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:50,231
My father was a prosecutor and he always
said that the simplest explanation

515
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:51,568
was usually right.

516
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:55,441
Remember what the note said:
"I know what you did. It makes me sick.

517
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:56,912
And I'm going to tell."

518
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:59,814
That's not something
someone writes to themselves.

519
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:02,785
That's a message sent by an enemy.

520
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:14,930
So exactly what is it
you hired me to do?

521
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:17,695
It's very simple really.

522
00:42:17,768 --> 00:42:23,138
Someone sent that note to my wife
and I need to know who.

523
00:42:24,408 --> 00:42:28,868
What type of person
would send such a note?

524
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:32,540
Was it an enemy? Of course.

525
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:36,450
But what kind? An acquaintance?

526
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,749
A stranger?

527
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:44,726
Or how about a neighbor
that lives a few fet away?
