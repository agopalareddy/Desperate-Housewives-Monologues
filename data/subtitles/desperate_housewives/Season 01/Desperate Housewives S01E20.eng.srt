Previously on Desperate Housewives...

3
00:00:03,069 --> 00:00:05,503
- I want a child.
- We made a deal. No kids.

4
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:09,269
- Tampering with prescriptions...
- File on Noah's daughter.

5
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:10,809
...uncovering evidence...

6
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:12,139
What are we looking for?

7
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,708
- What was that?
...breaking and entering...

8
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:20,617
- Bree is a lady.
- A very beautiful, classy lady.

9
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:23,884
Remember, they tend to end up
with doctors, not pharmacists.

10
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:27,358
...and a whole lot of revenge.

11
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:36,327
[Mary Alice]
Since she was a little girl,

12
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:40,533
Susan Mayer wanted to be a mother
in the worst way.

13
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:44,008
OK, I'm gonna get your bottle.
You're so cute, yeah!

14
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:47,569
And from the first day she brought Julie
home from the hospital...

15
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:48,841
[baby grunts]

16
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:51,008
Oh! How did you...

17
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:53,177
She was.

18
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:57,985
Oh, my gosh!

19
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:01,050
Despite her desire
to do well by her daughter...

20
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:02,116
[baby cries]

21
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:05,289
...Susan suffered
through countless failures.

22
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:07,026
So sorry!

23
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:12,059
Of course, it took Susan
a few years to realize

24
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:16,939
that even the best of parents
make mistakes now and then.

25
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:21,603
[Tapping]

26
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,917
But now that Julie was a tenage girl,

27
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:30,615
Susan had started to realize...

28
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:34,286
- [sighs]
...there was no room for error.

29
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:39,590
Julie, what is Zach doing out there?
I told you not to speak to him.

30
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:42,226
That's why he's throwing gravel
at my window.

31
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:45,897
Right, that's it.
I'm gonna handle this once and for all.

32
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:53,043
Zach, what do you think you're... Ow!

33
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,740
[Susan] Ow! Ow!

34
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:03,683
Mrs. Mayer, I am so sorry.

35
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:06,987
One pebble wasn't working
so I tried a whole handful.

36
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,153
- Ow... ow...
- I'll make it up to you.

37
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:12,460
- How, will you give me your corneas?
- Mom, lay back.

38
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:16,434
I wanted to talk to Julie. She hasn't
been returning my phone calls.

39
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:19,836
Well, I'm here now.
What do you want?

40
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:23,433
Come on, Julie.
I just wanna see you again.

41
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,478
You know. Talk, hang out.

42
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:28,844
Maybe it would be better
if we just cooled it for a while, OK?

43
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:29,904
Why?

44
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:34,010
You threw rocks in her mother's face.
How's that for a start?

45
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:44,760
Thank you so much.

46
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:48,995
I've been trying to break up with him
for weeks. Finally, an excuse.

47
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:51,559
Yes, Susan had failed
many times as a mother.

48
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:52,696
You did good, Mom.

49
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:55,332
So she took her victories
where she found them.

50
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:56,807
You're welcome.

51
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:44,655
Spring comes every year
to Wisteria Lane.

52
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:48,353
It's the time when flowers
start to bloom.

53
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:52,421
When butterflies
emerge from their cocoons.

54
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:55,763
When bes begin to search for nectar.

55
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:56,824
[Buzzing]

56
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:01,363
Spring is also the time
when a young man's fancy turns to...

57
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:02,931
...obsession.

58
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:05,443
We must buy that.

59
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:12,783
Hello, there.

60
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:14,615
Oh, my heavenly days!

61
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:16,382
Rex, look, it's George.

62
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:18,686
Nice to see you, Bree.

63
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:19,782
Dr. Van De Kamp.

64
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:21,349
George.

65
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,361
So, how's your health?

66
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,455
Not good. My cardiologist is an idiot.

67
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:29,763
The doctor upped his dosage twice
and it's still not helping.

68
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:31,701
I'm sure it'll all work itself out.

69
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,864
It's funny running into you both.

70
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,535
I have tickets to a bonsai exposition
in Mount Pleasant Friday night.

71
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,306
- Would you like to go?
- I would love to! Rex?

72
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,373
A whole evening of bonsai trees?
Wouldn't it be easier to shoot me?

73
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,418
Probably.

74
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:57,155
Well, why don't we
just go by ourselves, then?

75
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:01,223
Actually, Bree,
we have that thing, Friday night.

76
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,928
What? We don't have a thing.

77
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:07,735
I think your husband's trying to say
he doesn't want you going out with me.

78
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,934
Rex, are you still jealous?

79
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,602
No.

80
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:15,637
We dated during the separation
but we're just friends now, aren't we?

81
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:17,410
Strictly platonic.

82
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:21,078
- But if you feel threatened...
- I don't feel threatened.

83
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:25,549
Good. Then it's a date.

84
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:29,919
Are you going to make a purchase today?

85
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:33,454
I have finally convinced Rex
to buy his first orchid.

86
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:36,127
Study up. I hate people
who own precious flowers

87
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:38,193
and don't know
how to take care of them.

88
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:40,171
You know what I hate? Weeds.

89
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:43,333
They pop up and you have
to work so hard to get rid of them.

90
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:47,607
I find, with the right chemicals,
you can get rid of almost anything.

91
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,171
- See you Friday.
- Bye.

92
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:59,620
Mrs. Solis, what a surprise. We haven't
seen you in here in quite some time.

93
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:04,527
My husband and I went through a down-
sizing phase but we snapped out of it.

94
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:06,258
Life is good.

95
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:09,165
Oh, and this would make it
so much better!

96
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:10,600
Excellent.

97
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,332
Slip inside, see how that feels.

98
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:18,742
Oh! I'd love to have this
in my driveway by Saturday.

99
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:22,247
I'm having a big barbecue.
I want everyone to see it.

100
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:25,978
- How exciting. What's the occasion?
- My husband's going-away party.

101
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,612
Really? Where's he going?

102
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:32,385
It's a sort of
government-sponsored sabbatical.

103
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,221
How long is he going to be gone?

104
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:35,817
Eight months.

105
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,762
Six with good behavior.

106
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,060
- Isn't the leather interior wonderful?
- It is.

107
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:46,594
It is.
It's just the smell's a little intense.

108
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:51,075
It was imported from Italy.
It's 100ยบ% Italian calf.

109
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:56,972
[Vomiting]

110
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:02,047
I'm so sorry!
It just hit me out of nowhere.

111
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:05,613
It's so weird. Smells have been
making me nauseous lately.

112
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:10,625
- Boobs tender? Achy back?
- Yeah.

113
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:13,688
- Has it been going around?
- Only for centuries.

114
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:17,497
I went through it carrying my eldest.
The truth is,

115
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:21,165
you're never gonna fit a child
safety seat in the back of that Spyder.

116
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,435
The four-doors are much roomier.

117
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:26,376
Wha... Wait, uh... I'm sorry, you...

118
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,971
You think I'm pregnant?
No, I'm not pregnant.

119
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:32,643
Oh, you have all the symptoms,
I just assumed.

120
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:35,778
- Well, you assumed wrong.
- I'm sorry.

121
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:38,187
- I'm on the pill, for God's sakes!
- OK.

122
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:41,954
And I don't want a four-door.
I want a sexy little convertible.

123
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:44,724
- I wanna buy one, now.
- I'll start the paperwork.

124
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,493
Well, not this one.
I vomited in this one.

125
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:50,832
Right. We'll find you a fresh one.

126
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:56,164
[Phone rings]

127
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:58,267
[Woman] Peterson Advertising.

128
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,143
Lynette!

129
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:08,313
- You forgot your Halpern file.
- Oh, my God. Lynette.

130
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:12,983
If there was one person
Lynette never expected to se again,

131
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:16,358
it was Annabel Foster.

132
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:20,559
Eight years earlier,
Annabel had begged Tom to marry her.

133
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:23,693
But he told her
he wasn't the marrying kind.

134
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:26,169
Then one day,

135
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:29,174
Tom happened to met
a rising young executive

136
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:32,075
by the name of Lynette Lindquist.

137
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,771
And after a few torrid weks,

138
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:42,754
Tom decided perhaps he was
the marrying kind after all,

139
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:48,450
causing an embittered Annabel
to move back to Chicago.

140
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,654
Permanently.

141
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:52,220
Or so Lynette had hoped.

142
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:55,233
You look fantastic!

143
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:58,134
Thank you! And you!

144
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:03,574
You're here, in the office.
Tom's office.

145
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:05,372
Going on three months now.

146
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:09,312
- Oh.
- Didn't Tom tell you?

147
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:13,478
It, uh... must have slipped his mind.

148
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,043
[Forced laugh]

149
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:20,190
Ah! Afraid to tell the wife you're
working with the old girlfriend, huh?

150
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:23,751
I guess that makes me
your dirty little secret!

151
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:25,854
[Annabel laughs]

152
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:30,824
Well, I'll let you get back to work.

153
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,770
- See you later.
- Can't wait.

154
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,069
Oh, I almost forgot.

155
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:38,042
Your file. Here.

156
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,943
Hey, Paul. What's up?

157
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,614
Something's been nagging me,
I want to talk to you.

158
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,386
- OK.
- That night I found you in my house.

159
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:56,724
- Why were you really there?
- You know why.

160
00:09:56,796 --> 00:10:00,527
- I came to drop off your key.
- Some things were moved around.

161
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,366
- What were you looking for?
- What are you talking about?

162
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,964
Do I have to call the police?

163
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,634
Do whatever you want.

164
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,610
Suit yourself.

165
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:18,314
OK. OK! Susan made me do it.

166
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:21,683
She has this fixation
on why Mary Alice killed herself.

167
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:25,121
Keeps blathering on about
blackmail notes and dead babies.

168
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:28,490
She got really hot and bothered
when she found the name "Angela".

169
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:30,893
Written on one of your video tapes?

170
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:33,990
Did she find what she was looking for?

171
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:37,467
No. You came home before
she had a chance to watch the video.

172
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:40,094
I see.

173
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:44,609
She sort of thinks you're evil.

174
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,076
Thank you, Edie.

175
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:56,619
What was that all about?

176
00:10:56,689 --> 00:11:01,592
Susan Mayer's obsession with Mary Alice
almost got me arrested.

177
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,255
Now Paul's after her.

178
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,525
If I liked her better, I'd warn but...

179
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:07,998
You know.

180
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:11,626
Thanks.

181
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:14,669
[Chatter]

182
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,539
Susan.

183
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,622
Well... Talk to you girls later.

184
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,187
Still avoiding me, huh?

185
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,489
No. No.

186
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:38,856
What do you want?

187
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:41,991
I heard that you and Edie
broke into Paul Young's house.

188
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:45,128
- Who told you that?
- Edie.

189
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:49,871
Well... Yeah, we did. Um...

190
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,935
We were just looking...

191
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:54,639
It doesn't matter, it was dumb.

192
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,648
I want you to stay away from that guy.

193
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,150
I was planning on doing that anyway.

194
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:01,786
Good.

195
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,355
Mike.

196
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:08,223
I know why I was planning to stay
away from him. Why do you want me to?

197
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:13,027
I just know he's a bad guy.
So please, don't mess with him.

198
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:14,794
I won't.

199
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:18,031
I promise.

200
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:35,246
So, I've been thinking
about the pharmacist.

201
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:37,050
George. What about him?

202
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:39,250
I don't think you should
go out with him.

203
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:43,284
Please, he's the only friend I have
who's interested in cultural things.

204
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:48,833
Bree, I'm worried because
he is obviously still in love with you.

205
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:52,132
No, he just wants to be friends.
He told me so.

206
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:55,401
Well, what else
would a man in love say?

207
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:59,342
- He's desperate to spend time with you.
- He does not seem desperate to me.

208
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:04,441
I saw the way his hands trembled
when you touched his shoulder.

209
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:05,575
They did?

210
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:10,383
When we first started dating,
the same thing happened to me.

211
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,016
I don't remember that.

212
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:16,255
Listen, continuing to see him
would just give him false hope.

213
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:19,525
Well, I certainly
don't want to hurt him.

214
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:23,261
- Again.
- No, you don't.

215
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:26,862
I even think it would be a good idea
to switch pharmacies.

216
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:29,100
Really?

217
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,807
Well, OK.

218
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,709
You know what I'm gonna
miss most about him?

219
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:40,013
George always has a way
of making me feel good about myself.

220
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:43,077
Yeah, he's a terrific guy.

221
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:47,924
Honey, do your hands still tremble
when they touch me?

222
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:52,993
No. But, come on,
we've been married 18 years.

223
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,367
Yes, we have.

224
00:13:56,435 --> 00:14:00,166
And you still don't know
when I need you to lie.

225
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:11,015
Excuse me, this home pregnancy test,
is it a good one?

226
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,381
I guess.

227
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:15,477
OK, um...

228
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:18,455
- Do you have a rest room?
- It's for employees only.

229
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,652
Oh, it's right over there, Mrs. Solis.
Help yourself.

230
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:23,319
Thank you.

231
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,959
What did I tell you
about being rude to customers?

232
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:31,901
Stick a smile on your face
or I'll keep you in back

233
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:33,939
where no one has to look at you.

234
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:39,739
Bree, what a pleasant surprise!
What brings you here?

235
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:42,747
Didn't we fill Dr. Van De Kamp's
prescription last week?

236
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:46,911
George, as it turns out, I won't be able
to go with you to the bonsai expo.

237
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:48,510
Why not?

238
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:51,818
It would be a mistake for us
to spend too much time together.

239
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:55,349
Dr. Van De Kamp said something
about me. What was it?

240
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:58,658
- It doesn't matter.
- Please, tell me.

241
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,199
He said you're still in love with me.

242
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:06,327
[Sighs] That's... That's stupid.

243
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:09,841
I'm not in love with you. I'm not.

244
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:13,242
The truth is, I'm in love with Ginger.

245
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:15,837
Ginger? The stock girl?

246
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,509
Yes. It's very serious.

247
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,247
Oh! Why didn't you tell me?!

248
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:29,624
Well, we're taking it slow,
but she is definitely the one.

249
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,890
Oh, my goodness,
this changes everything.

250
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:35,365
Listen, a friend of mine
is having a barbecue on Saturday.

251
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,026
- You should come.
- Really?

252
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,694
Yes, and bring Ginger.

253
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:42,537
Ginger? I don't know if she can make it.

254
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,371
You have to bring Ginger because

255
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:47,071
if Rex sees the two of you together,
he'll relax.

256
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:49,808
Oh. Uh...

257
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:52,316
- OK.
- [Gabrielle] Son of a bitch!

258
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,883
You are out of toilet paper.

259
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,450
Bree, I'll call you later.

260
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:09,533
Lynette!

261
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,197
Hey, honey!

262
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:17,072
- Are you home?
- Three months?

263
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:20,134
God, you... scared the hell out of me.

264
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:22,612
Were you ever gonna tell me?

265
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:27,277
I wanted to, but I kept putting it off.
I knew how you'd react.

266
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,844
Congratulations,
you read me like a book.

267
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:34,455
Why would you hire that woman?

268
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:37,984
Well, technically, Peterson found her.
I just vouched for her.

269
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:40,554
- Tom...
- Honey, I'm just helping her out.

270
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:45,001
It's the least I can do. She was
devastated when I left her for you.

271
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,401
I felt bad.

272
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:50,398
Do you still have feelings for her?

273
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:52,501
All right, I'm not talking to you.

274
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:56,446
You can tell me. You still care
about her, don't you? Just a teeny bit?

275
00:16:56,515 --> 00:17:00,281
I was just trying to be a good guy.
That's all.

276
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:03,446
- You can't work with her.
- What do you want me to do? Quit?

277
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,888
Talk to Peterson,
he can get her transferred.

278
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,620
Weren't you guys
starting something up in Belize?

279
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:12,687
- Honey, you're crazy.
- No, I'm serious.

280
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:16,257
If she stays, I will haunt your office.

281
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:18,303
I'll bring your lunch every day.

282
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,737
I'll bring the kids to visit,
I will change diapers on your desk.

283
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:25,299
Every birthday cake in the break room,
every retirement party,

284
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,709
I will be there, watching her.

285
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:31,547
Well, I'd better
get you a parking space,

286
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:33,380
'cause she's staying.

287
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:48,060
Don't you think it spices up the room?

288
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:49,828
[Doorbell rings]

289
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:58,503
I was just leaving you a gift
to apologize for,

290
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,068
you know,
throwing gravel in your face.

291
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:06,108
- Well, you didn't have to do that.
- I kinda did.

292
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:09,518
- See, I want us to be friends.
- Yeah, well...

293
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:13,883
- That's not gonna happen.
- Why not?

294
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:17,053
Aside from you blinding me?

295
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:21,088
Several weeks ago,
you freaked out in my house.

296
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,657
You screamed,
you threw furniture around...

297
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:28,365
[sighs] OK, I realize that
I was out of line that night.

298
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,271
But I was upset.

299
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:33,038
And we have to get over that,
for Julie's sake.

300
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,773
For Julie's sake?

301
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:39,477
How does it make her feel that her
mother and boyfriend can't get along?

302
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:43,385
Julie does not think of you
as her boyfriend.

303
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:46,481
In fact, I don't think
she wants anything to do with you.

304
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,453
- She said that?
- Yeah.

305
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:54,192
- I don't believe you.
- Believe whatever you want.

306
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:57,258
It's because you tell her stuff about me
that's not true!

307
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:59,896
[Paul] Zach! Come here!

308
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,133
Right now!

309
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:10,338
Please. Don't ruin this for me.

310
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,504
[Mrs. Huber] How do you know Mary Alice?

311
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:37,565
- Who?
- Mary Alice Young.

312
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:40,840
She lives next door to me in Fairview.

313
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:43,006
She's here in this picture with you.

314
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:47,711
That's Angela Forrest, we worked
at the rehab center 15 years ago.

315
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:50,550
Don't be dense.
Don't you think I know my own neighbor?

316
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,493
Does this Mary Alice have children?

317
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:59,224
A teenager. A boy.

318
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:04,493
What?

319
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:09,867
Angela and I worked with
a very disturbed young woman

320
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:12,570
who gave birth to a baby boy.

321
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:18,014
About a year later,
Angela and her husband disappeared.

322
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:22,713
Not long after that,
I heard that the child was missing too.

323
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:26,019
People said it was just a coincidence.

324
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:29,925
But in my heart, I always hoped
she had given him a proper home.

325
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:35,492
Are you saying she stole the baby?

326
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:39,503
Don't look shocked, Martha.
It makes your face look fat.

327
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:45,539
The biological mother was a drug addict.

328
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:49,479
If Angela really is your neighbor,
which I doubt,

329
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:52,949
then that child was very lucky.

330
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:18,570
Lynette, hey! If you're looking for Tom,
he's out with a client.

331
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:20,942
No. I actually wanted to see you.

332
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:24,278
You know, that's really funny,
I was thinking the same thing.

333
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:28,115
I've been here all this time. We should
go out, for lunch, the two of us.

334
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:30,120
Yeah. I'll check my book.

335
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:34,519
So, Annabel... [clears throat]

336
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:37,562
...do you have feelings for Tom?

337
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,824
- What?
- You heard me.

338
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:43,834
OK, you wanna talk about this?
Let's talk.

339
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:48,430
Yes, Tom and I were in love.
But he married you.

340
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:52,443
I'm not looking
to break up a happy couple.

341
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:55,571
Anyway, that's rather
more your speed, isn't it?

342
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,644
Morning, ladies.
Just coming in for a little more fuel.

343
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:03,347
Yup. One man's sludge
is another man's liquid gold.

344
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:04,684
[Slurps]

345
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:08,385
Well, back to the trenches.

346
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:12,586
Watch your step. Tom and I are a team.

347
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:16,600
Our marriage is rock solid.
Nothing you do could ever break that up.

348
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:19,603
Then why are you down here right now,
warning me?

349
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,468
[Snort of derision]

350
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,337
[Bells ring]

351
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:36,151
Gabrielle! What brings you down here?

352
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:41,681
Oh, sweet Mother of God,
what have you done this time?

353
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,593
- You're pregnant?
- Yes.

354
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:46,756
And it's impossible, I'm on the pill.

355
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:49,323
Which you probably think is a sin,
but it works.

356
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:51,801
It's a 99.9ยบ% effective sin.

357
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:55,362
Maybe it's in that one tenth
of a percent that God resides.

358
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,908
Couldn't wait to throw that in,
could you?

359
00:22:57,976 --> 00:22:59,466
God is screwing with me.

360
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:02,513
He doesn't like the way
I live my life so he's punishing me.

361
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:06,312
Have you done something
that would warrant being punished?

362
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:08,879
The gardener?

363
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:13,881
- I thought that was over.
- No, it was, and then...

364
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:15,551
You just had to be there.

365
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:20,655
My point is, I'd be an awful mother.
I'm selfish and self-centered...

366
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:23,132
The only person
more self-centered is Carlos.

367
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:26,466
He's so self-centered, he doesn't
know how self-centered I am.

368
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:27,937
We'd be terrible parents.

369
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:31,407
Gabrielle, I'd like to help,
but I'm not sure what it is you want.

370
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:34,912
It's just, I wanna know
who to be angry at.

371
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,778
Here's a thought: Don't be angry.

372
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:41,182
Be thankful.
Children are a gift, are they not?

373
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:48,350
I don't have time for this crap.
I have a party to plan.

374
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:50,691
Thanks.

375
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,354
- Edie, hey.
- Hi.

376
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:56,959
- Wow. Things are really coming along.
- Yeah. Slowly and expensively.

377
00:23:57,035 --> 00:24:00,801
It'll be worth it.
You're doing an amazing job.

378
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:06,276
So look, you're basically... a predator
and I need some advice.

379
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:12,749
I know Tom loves me,
but I don't trust this woman.

380
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:15,548
I think there's an agenda there.

381
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,145
I don't know.
Maybe I'm being paranoid.

382
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:21,488
No, no. You did the right thing
coming to me.

383
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,154
There are two ways to approach this.

384
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:26,663
First, what kind of shape
is this woman in?

385
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:29,291
Fantastic shape, she's gorgeous.

386
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:33,098
OK. Now there's really only
one way to approach this.

387
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:35,867
- You're gonna have to act fast.
- I'm listening.

388
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:37,340
It's pretty simple.

389
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:40,401
When I feel threatened by a woman,
I pull her in.

390
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,242
I make her my best friend.

391
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,680
You said you didn't have
any female friends.

392
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:48,776
I don't. And I've never felt threatened
by another woman either.

393
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:51,345
But the point is...

394
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:55,018
- Keep your friends close...
- Keep your enemies closer.

395
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:06,501
Tom. We're having a dinner party.
I'm thinking of inviting Annabel.

396
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:13,371
- We're not moving.
- Susan knows something. Edie said...

397
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:16,209
I don't care what Edie said!
I'm not leaving Julie!

398
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:20,183
You wanna risk our lives, our future,
over some... schoolyard crush?

399
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:22,379
It's more than that. Julie loves me.

400
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:25,285
Then why does she refuse to see you?

401
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:29,560
Mrs. Mayer lies to her. If it wasn't
for that, she would be with me.

402
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:31,562
Are you sure?

403
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:34,997
- Julie's a very special girl.
- I know.

404
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:38,593
She could have
just about any boy she wanted.

405
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:42,971
I think you're a wonderful kid.
I do, but...

406
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:46,239
You're not that special, Zach.

407
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:49,372
Not really.

408
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:53,743
- She kissed me.
- Lately?

409
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:58,082
Let's pack our bags and get out of here.

410
00:25:58,156 --> 00:26:00,784
Leave this whole mess behind
and start over.

411
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:03,726
And there will be other girls,
I promise.

412
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:05,092
No!

413
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:07,256
If Susan goes to the police, it's over.

414
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:10,165
They'll take me away. Take you away.
Don't you get that?

415
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:13,671
If Julie doesn't love me anymore,
it doesn't matter.

416
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,036
None of it matters.

417
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:27,649
Oh, McGruder had absolutely
no idea what was going on.

418
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:31,815
During the entire shoot, he was
practically holding Benson's hand!

419
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:35,451
After the way Burnham screwed him over,
I'd be nervous too!

420
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:38,121
My God, it was awful!

421
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:43,734
Excuse me, I need to get in here
so I can clear the plates.

422
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:45,770
- You want some help?
- I'm good.

423
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:48,431
Oh... Looks like we got company.

424
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:50,406
Hey, guys. Isn't it time for bed?

425
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:54,206
Oh, they never get to see you.
Let 'em stay up for a while.

426
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,611
OK, come here.
I want you to meet someone.

427
00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:01,647
- This is Miss Foster.
- Hi.

428
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,450
She's an old, old friend
of your Daddy's.

429
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:09,325
- What you got there?
- A picture we painted.

430
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:11,419
Let me have a look at that.

431
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:15,489
[Porter] It's all of us with Mommy
and Daddy. We're really happy.

432
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:17,865
Oh, that is so adorable.

433
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:20,427
- When did you do this?
- Today. Mom told us to.

434
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:24,901
I told them to paint something nice.
The sentiment's theirs.

435
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:27,945
- But you told us to.
- Hold on, grown-ups are talking.

436
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:30,948
Well, this is really neat.

437
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:34,645
Hey, how would you boys
like to paint my portrait one day?

438
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:36,050
Sure, you're pretty.

439
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:39,579
OK, great. So like your dad said,
it's time for bed.

440
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,183
I'll take 'em back upstairs.

441
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,353
Come on, guys.

442
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:45,657
Thank you.

443
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:50,625
- [Boys giggle]
- [Tom] Here we go.

444
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:55,000
I must say,
your home is warm and inviting,

445
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:57,871
your children
are absolutely precious.

446
00:27:57,942 --> 00:28:01,708
This whole evening was practically
a commercial for the perfect family.

447
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,112
You think?

448
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,844
You couldn't have planned it any better.

449
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:09,011
And I mean that.

450
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:10,748
Good.

451
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:16,487
[Gasps]

452
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:18,292
Hello, Susan.

453
00:28:19,497 --> 00:28:21,556
Paul...

454
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:22,622
Hi.

455
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:26,694
I understand you and Edie
went snooping through my house.

456
00:28:26,771 --> 00:28:30,002
- Huh?
- It's OK, I'm not mad.

457
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:33,567
So, what do you want to know
about Angela?

458
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:40,982
It was Mary Alice's birth name.
She was named after her aunt Angela.

459
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:45,318
When she was a teenager, they fell out
so she changed her name to Mary Alice.

460
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:49,087
This was before we were married, so
forgive me if I'm hazy on the details.

461
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:53,023
That's it? That's the explanation?

462
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:55,623
Ridiculously simple, isn't it?

463
00:28:57,368 --> 00:29:01,930
She changed her name because
she got in a fight with her aunt?

464
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:04,839
That doesn't seem like
something Mary Alice would do.

465
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:08,072
Neither did suicide,
but we both know she did it.

466
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:14,116
So, can we finally put this behind us?

467
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:17,643
Or do you need to break into my home
for anything else?

468
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:19,622
Uh...

469
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:22,723
No. Um...

470
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:25,353
I'm good, thanks.

471
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:33,367
Though, if you wouldn't mind,
I'd like to see that videotape I found.

472
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,531
The one marked Angela.

473
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:40,271
It would be nice
to see Mary Alice when she was young.

474
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:43,371
I'm afraid that box of tapes
was thrown out with the trash.

475
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:48,285
OK, then.

476
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:54,019
Susan, I'm serious when I say I hope
you'll leave my family alone now.

477
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:57,493
This endless suspicion of yours
has become very tiring.

478
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,296
Yeah, I couldn't agree more.

479
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:14,575
[Cell phone rings]

480
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:17,046
Oh, that's my cell. Sorry.

481
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:19,015
OK.

482
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:25,413
My God, it's Peterson. Excuse me.

483
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,458
- Peterson?
- Hello?

484
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:28,787
Yeah.

485
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:34,995
So, that was quite a show
you put on tonight.

486
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:37,261
Show?

487
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:41,135
The boys paintings, all these references
to how happy we are?

488
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:44,369
Why not subtly remind Annabel
you're happily married?

489
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:46,740
It wasn't subtle.

490
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:49,336
And it's an insult to me.

491
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:53,275
I did not mean it that way.

492
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:58,822
Are you so insecure
that you have to pull that crap?

493
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,619
[Whispers] Keep your voice down!

494
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:05,752
It doesn't matter if she has feelings
for me as long as I'm not interested.

495
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:08,526
Have I ever, ever given you
any reason to doubt me?

496
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,091
Anyone is capable of anything.

497
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:13,399
The first time we met,
you were cheating.

498
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:15,632
With you! Cheating with you!

499
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,334
It's a pattern of behavior.

500
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:18,739
Give me a break!

501
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,869
Well, what am I supposed to do?

502
00:31:20,945 --> 00:31:24,642
You hire your old girlfriend and don't
tell me about it for three months?

503
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,810
If I'd told you on day one,
you'd still jump down my throat.

504
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,980
- Annabel is ancient history.
- She's in the next room.

505
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:34,821
How long do we have to be married,
how long until you trust me?

506
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,690
I trust you.

507
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:40,527
How many times have you said, "Touch
another woman and I'll take the boys

508
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:42,225
and you'll never see us again"?

509
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,736
That's just... something
wives say to their husbands.

510
00:31:45,803 --> 00:31:47,430
Not all wives.

511
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:51,703
God, Lynette, you're just so convinced
that I'm gonna be unfaithful!

512
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:54,745
It makes me sick,
the distrust, the paranoia...

513
00:31:54,812 --> 00:31:56,746
You know, it seems
you won't be happy

514
00:31:56,814 --> 00:32:00,773
until you drive me out
to prove yourself right!

515
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:06,185
OK, wait. Forget I said that.

516
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,282
It's too late.

517
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,657
You said it.

518
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:14,494
Then just consider it something
that husbands say to their wives.

519
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:16,533
[Door opens]

520
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:19,126
Well, Peterson's on cloud nine.

521
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:22,400
He discovered some inside scoop
on the Metro account.

522
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:25,704
The bad news is, we have
to re-do the entire presentation.

523
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:28,245
- Tonight?
- They need it first thing.

524
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:31,305
Peterson says
we might be pulling an all-nighter.

525
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:33,509
I can't drive, I've been drinking.

526
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:35,950
I'll drive. Come on.

527
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,045
- Thanks.
- Don't worry, Lynette.

528
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:40,556
I'll deliver him back to you
as soon as I can.

529
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:43,387
Please do!

530
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,969
[Music and chatter]

531
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:01,940
Honey, take over a minute.
I'm giving a speech.

532
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:04,607
Make sure they stay
pink like that, OK?

533
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:07,279
Are you OK?

534
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:12,654
Oh! Yeah, I just didn't realize
how disgusting meat could be.

535
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:19,622
Everyone, I just wanted to say it means
a lot to me that all of you came.

536
00:33:19,697 --> 00:33:21,528
And as you know, in a few days,

537
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:24,432
I'm taking a little
government-sponsored vacation.

538
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:27,562
Lucky for me, breakfast is included.

539
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:28,662
[Laughter]

540
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,935
- Oh, God
- [Carlos] The bottom line is,

541
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:37,038
I'm going to jail,
and when a man goes away to jail,

542
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:39,777
which I hope none of you
here ever have to do,

543
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,876
he sees who his real friends are.

544
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:43,887
So thanks.

545
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:46,549
[All] Hear, hear!

546
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,697
Excuse you.

547
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:01,134
Stay put until I need you.

548
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:04,800
Don't talk to anybody
and for God's sake, don't get drunk.

549
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,037
I'm supposed to be
at my cousin's wedding.

550
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:10,672
It's not a wedding, it's a commitment
ceremony. Now sit down and...

551
00:34:10,748 --> 00:34:12,875
...try to... fit in.

552
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:35,267
I got you a hotdog.

553
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:36,704
No, thanks, I'm full.

554
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:40,073
They have a croquet set.
Wanna go hit some balls?

555
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:42,942
- No.
- That's fine. I can just sit here.

556
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:44,879
Zach.

557
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:47,281
I don't wanna be your girlfriend
or hang out.

558
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:49,376
I want you to leave me alone, OK?

559
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:54,281
OK.

560
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,171
[Sighs]

561
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:36,330
In that moment,

562
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,359
while looking at the pills that
had ben so obviously tampered with,

563
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:45,569
Gabrielle's nausea was suddenly replaced
by an even stronger sensation.

564
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,440
Rage.

565
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:52,242
[Inaudible]

566
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:00,684
[Inaudible]

567
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:06,829
What are you doing?

568
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:09,093
I'm so sorry. That was an accident.

569
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,658
Answer my question.
What are you doing here?

570
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:14,102
- I was invited.
- By who?

571
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:17,335
You know what?
I don't believe I have to answer to you.

572
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:19,672
- I think you do.
- What's going on here?

573
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:23,680
He crashed the party. This guy
clearly is not taking no for an answer.

574
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:27,980
It's OK. George has a girlfriend.
You brought her, didn't you?

575
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:30,316
- He doesn't have a girlfriend.
- I do so.

576
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:32,049
She's right over there.

577
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:39,457
- That's his girlfriend?
- See? We were worried for nothing.

578
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:44,265
So, any time you want to apologize...

579
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:49,197
Oh, come on, Rex.
You owe George some sort of gesture.

580
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:57,404
Oh, what the hell.

581
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:59,312
[They shriek]

582
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:03,453
[Laughs]

583
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:09,492
Rex, have you lost your mind?!

584
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,585
To be fair, I only pushed him.

585
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:15,264
Carlos! You son of a bitch!

586
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:18,029
I am pregnant and it's all your fault.

587
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:29,573
Wow. This is turning into
one hell of a party. [laughs]

588
00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:38,788
Are you OK?

589
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:41,552
I think I can honestly say, no, I'm not.

590
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:43,594
I'm so sorry.

591
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:45,720
Thanks.

592
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:49,990
But you know what they say about kids?

593
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:52,934
That you can't imagine
having them until you do,

594
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:56,132
and then you can't imagine
life without them?

595
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:57,606
It's true.

596
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:05,276
All I'm saying is,
maybe this is a blessing in disguise.

597
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,315
I don't know who the father is.

598
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:09,717
What?

599
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:11,015
Yeah.

600
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:14,583
- So you and John have still been...?
- Yeah.

601
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:15,853
Gabby!

602
00:38:15,926 --> 00:38:18,292
I know, Susan,
I don't know what I'm gonna do!

603
00:38:19,263 --> 00:38:21,424
- [Both scream]
- Oh! Oh, my God!

604
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:24,024
- Oh, my God! That's my house!
- I'll call 911!

605
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:25,966
Yes, that's-that's my house!

606
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:28,369
Oh! Oh!

607
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,271
Oh, my...! Look, my kitchen!

608
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:34,743
Oh, it's a big fire!

609
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:41,381
Turns out, someone left the gas on
with candles burning.

610
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:45,718
That's not possible.
We don't burn candles during the day.

611
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:51,194
Uh, well, I did have a French
vanilla candle burning earlier, but...

612
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:53,492
I'm almost positive I blew it out.

613
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:55,293
You're almost positive?

614
00:38:57,702 --> 00:38:59,260
Yes! I did!

615
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,362
I did, I... I think.

616
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:03,304
[Fireman] The fire was contained.

617
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:06,901
The damage could have been
far more extensive.

618
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:09,878
You've gotta be
more careful from now on.

619
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:19,213
Don't worry. We will be.

620
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:27,787
- Bree, hi.
- Hi.

621
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:30,026
You left the party so quickly,

622
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:33,696
I didn't have a chance to apologize
to you for what Rex did.

623
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:39,334
George, I'm so sorry he humiliated you
in front of all those people.

624
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:42,971
- I don't know what got into him.
- Isn't it obvious? He hates me.

625
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:46,039
No, he doesn't hate you,
he doesn't even know you.

626
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:49,484
- You don't really even know him.
- I know this much.

627
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:52,113
He's not gonna let us be friends.

628
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:54,919
Well, that's not his choice to make.

629
00:39:56,627 --> 00:39:59,027
What if he asks you
not to see me any more?

630
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:02,658
What if he orders you not to?

631
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:05,793
Well, I decide who I need in my life,

632
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,997
and I've decided that I need you.

633
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:10,540
And that's all there is to it.

634
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:13,907
He could make it awfully difficult
for you to spend time with me.

635
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:18,608
Well, who says he has to know
how I spend my free time?

636
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:20,843
[Laughs]

637
00:40:31,495 --> 00:40:35,022
[Susan] I'm having trouble
with the family across the stret.

638
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:38,967
I think one of them
may have set a fire in my house.

639
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:40,560
And I don't know why,

640
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:44,904
but I fel like it's got something
to do with my friend who killed herself.

641
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:51,448
I called the police,
but they didn't take me seriously.

642
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:57,280
This family's got a secret,
a bad secret.

643
00:40:57,354 --> 00:40:58,753
I'm in over my head.

644
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:01,621
I need you to find out
everything there is to know

645
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:04,627
about Paul Young and his family.

646
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,593
Do you think you can help me?

647
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:11,958
As a matter of fact,

648
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:14,061
I know I can.

649
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:23,374
[Mary Alice] Spring comes every year
to Wisteria Lane.

650
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:27,611
But not everyone remembers
to stop and smell the flowers.

651
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:33,854
Some are too busy
worrying about the future.

652
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:38,418
Or mistakes they've made in the past.

653
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:45,732
Others are preoccupied
with not getting caught.

654
00:41:47,471 --> 00:41:49,336
It's a window!

655
00:41:49,406 --> 00:41:54,002
Or thinking of ways
to catch someone else.

656
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:02,577
Still, there will always be a few

657
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:08,387
who remember to take a moment and
appreciate what spring has given them.

658
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:16,595
Just as there will always be those
who prefer to sit in the dark,

659
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:21,036
brooding over everything they've lost.
