2
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,128
Previously on Desperate Housewives...

3
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:05,296
- Grandma's here.
- In life...

4
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:08,000
- A post-nuptial agreement.
- I'm not signing this.

5
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:12,673
- Sign it!
- Stop! You're hurting me!

6
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:14,509
Mrs. Solis. What are you doing?

7
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:16,845
...you can't change what's ben done...

8
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:20,215
[Noah] People leave trails.
One of those will lead to Deidre.

9
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:23,813
I'm not taking my money to the grave.
I'm gonna use it to save your ass.

10
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,324
...or who people really are.

11
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:29,920
Andrew just told me
he thinks he might be gay.

12
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:38,198
[Mary Alice] Every morning,
as she went to take out her trash,

13
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:42,207
Lynette Scavo would indulge
in a little daydream,

14
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:46,803
the details of which
were always the same.

15
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,509
One day, her nasty neighbor
Karen McCluskey

16
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:53,848
would kel over and die.

17
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,721
And her home would be bought
by a lovely Swedish family

18
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:02,023
with two adorable twin daughters.

19
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:05,929
The families would form
an everlasting friendship,

20
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:09,662
culminating in their daughters
marrying her sons

21
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,829
at an elaborate wedding

22
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:15,306
the Scavos wouldn't have to pay for.

23
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:21,775
Yes, Lynette enjoyed
her little daydream.

24
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:25,079
But Mrs. McCluskey
always had a way

25
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:28,177
of pulling her back to reality.

26
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:29,482
Hey, hey, hey!

27
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:33,390
Hey! Why are you
stealing my garbage cans?

28
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,861
Garbage pick-up was two days ago,
they've been here ever since.

29
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,229
- I assumed you didn't want them.
- Oh, that's very cute.

30
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,394
That's great. Here, give 'em here.

31
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,268
Bad enough that God-awful color
you painted the house.

32
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:49,103
We shouldn't have to stare
at your cans for days on end.

33
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:50,802
Good neighbor etiquette?

34
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:54,643
How about you hire a gardener to take
care of that jungle you call a lawn?

35
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:56,909
- I am on a fixed income.
- Oh?

36
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:59,918
Perhaps you should consider
somewhere less expensive.

37
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:01,954
- Like a nursing home.
- Go to hell.

38
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:04,353
Run by Germans, hm?

39
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,384
And, you know...

40
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,452
[groaning]

41
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,657
Mrs... Mrs. McCluskey...!

42
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:14,962
Mrs. McCluskey, are you all right?

43
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:16,558
[Moans]

44
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,797
I'll get the door.

45
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:21,534
[Groans]

46
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:22,666
Mrs. McCluskey...!

47
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:24,175
For a brief moment,

48
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:27,907
Lynette was presented with
an interesting choice of options.

49
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:33,515
And though she knew
she'd hate herself in the morning,

50
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:36,646
Lynette chose to do the right thing.

51
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:38,588
Lynette, where are they taking me?

52
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:42,025
You're going to the hospital,
you're gonna be fine.

53
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:45,496
- I don't wanna go alone. Come with me.
- Oh, um...

54
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:50,867
These are trained technicians
and I've got a roast in the... freezer.

55
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:53,497
Please. I'm scared.

56
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,063
[Sighs]

57
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:58,975
Yeah, I'll come with you.
OK, here I am.

58
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:00,740
Thank you.

59
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:05,141
If I die,
I don't want it to be with strangers.

60
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:09,552
- You're not going to die.
- How can you be so sure?

61
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,048
Of course, Lynette didn't respond.

62
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:17,585
How could she tell her neighbor
that some dreams

63
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:22,192
are just too beautiful to come true?

64
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:10,914
Life is a journey.

65
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:16,081
One that is much better traveled
with a companion by our side.

66
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:20,387
But sometimes,
we lose our companions along the way.

67
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:24,055
And then the journey
becomes unbearable.

68
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:26,564
[Man] Noah.

69
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:31,463
I didn't know you were a religious man.
What's with the rosary?

70
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:34,637
They found Deidre.

71
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:36,072
What?

72
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:41,075
Her body had been stuffed
inside a toy chest.

73
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:44,412
[Noah] Can you believe that?

74
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:47,248
A kid's toy chest.

75
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:51,617
[Deep breathing]

76
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:54,683
She'd been dismembered.

77
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:02,295
My God.

78
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,936
Cops ID'd her from her dental records.

79
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,579
She's been dead 15 years.

80
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:18,178
All that time I was looking for her.

81
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,913
She was already gone.

82
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:25,015
[Softly] I'm so sorry.

83
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:30,158
I have to bury my baby.

84
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:32,993
I came out here to...

85
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:36,229
...figure out
what kind of tombstone to get her.

86
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:39,437
You shouldn't be doing this now.

87
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,632
Let's get you home.

88
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:46,139
- There's a cop I want you to talk to.
- A cop?

89
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:48,043
His name is Sullivan.

90
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:51,777
I paid him to take the heat off you
for your neighbor's murder.

91
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,513
He'll get you the file
on Deidre's case.

92
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:57,786
Apparently they have some leads.

93
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:08,534
[Rex] I don't know.
I think we may be making a huge mistake.

94
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:10,967
[Bree] We made our decision,
let's stick to it.

95
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,369
Let's say we leave him here
three more weeks.

96
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:15,999
What's the worst that could happen?

97
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:19,135
Our son just told us
that he might be gay.

98
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,648
There are 200 other boys in this camp.

99
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:26,742
I could explain to you what might happen
if we left him here.

100
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:29,549
But I am a lady
and I don't use that kind of language.

101
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:33,582
[Sighs]

102
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:38,655
I bet we're worrying over nothing.
This is probably just a phase.

103
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:43,191
We'll get him into Christian counseling
so it won't become a lifestyle.

104
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:47,228
Whatever's going on with him,
he's still our son and we love him.

105
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:48,739
Why would you say that to me?

106
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:53,108
It's obvious how freaked out you are
by the whole gay thing.

107
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:56,273
I'm freaked out but that doesn't change
how I feel about him.

108
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:58,544
I'm just saying, be cool.

109
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:06,519
- I can be just as cool as you can.
- All right.

110
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,803
It'll be nice to have you back.

111
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:21,931
Andrew...

112
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:25,500
I would love you
even if you were a murderer.

113
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:38,382
Mommy, the line's not moving.

114
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,653
Oh, for Pete's sake.

115
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,953
[Woman laughing]

116
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,633
Mom.

117
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:50,168
Mom. The kids are waiting.

118
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:54,730
Oh, honey, Hector here
teaches salsa at the community center.

119
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:58,937
- I give private lessons too.
- I bet you do!

120
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:02,276
Mom, would you please not flirt
with the ice cream man?

121
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:03,337
Why not?

122
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:07,079
Do you need a reason beyond the fact
that he's the ice cream man?

123
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:10,054
It's called moving on with your life.

124
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:12,488
You broke up with Morty two weeks ago.

125
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:15,026
At least pretend
to mourn the relationship.

126
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:17,324
You are such a stick-in-the-mud.

127
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:19,864
We should be out there having fun.

128
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:22,025
I know what we can do tonight.

129
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:25,832
We can go to some hip club
and get some hot guys!

130
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:28,032
- Mom...
- It'll be great!

131
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:32,407
I'll say I'm 42 and you can be 28.

132
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:34,070
What?!

133
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:36,239
Oh! You can pull it off!

134
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:45,051
Mrs. McCluskey,
you're back from hospital already?

135
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:48,116
Turns out I OD'd
on my arthritis medication.

136
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:52,255
One pill, I can open a jar. Four pills,
I'm face down, crawling for my life.

137
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:54,458
You'll find out about that soon enough.

138
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:58,630
[Laughs] Well, I'm glad to hear
you're all right.

139
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:03,004
Here, my way of saying thank you for not
letting me die out there on the lawn.

140
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:05,669
- Oh, Mrs. McCluskey, you don't...
- Keep that.

141
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:08,407
It's genuine Tiffany.
Been in my family for years.

142
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:13,418
L-I don't know what to say.
It's stunning, thank you.

143
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:30,661
- I'd invite you in...
- I wanna tell you what my doctor said.

144
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,000
Arthritis is the least of my problems.

145
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,973
See, I had this skin tag,
or what I thought was a skin tag,

146
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:37,839
but it might be more serious...

147
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:44,774
What do you think you're doing?

148
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:48,047
Please, I can't sleep in the den
any more. I need to sleep in a bed.

149
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,886
You might wanna try a motel,
'cause you're not coming back in here.

150
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,917
[Sighs] How many times
have I got to say I'm sorry?

151
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:58,793
Obviously a few more.

152
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:02,392
I'm not proud of what I did.

153
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:04,368
I admit I was way out of line.

154
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,771
You want back in this bed?
You know what to do.

155
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,308
- I'm not tearing up the post-nup.
- Why not?!

156
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:17,338
Because it's the one way I can ensure
you'll be here when I get out of jail.

157
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:20,544
Well, then, have fun at the motel.

158
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,783
Fine. Tomorrow I'm canceling
your credit cards.

159
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:25,289
What?

160
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:27,826
And I'm taking away your ATM as well.

161
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:29,758
What am I supposed to do for money?

162
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:33,492
Once you see how good you've got it,
you'll treat me with respect.

163
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:36,558
You want my respect?
Tear up the post-nup.

164
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,467
Give me my pillow.

165
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:41,261
One more thing.

166
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,400
If you ever hurt me again,
I will kill you.

167
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,503
If you ever leave me for another man,
I'll kill you.

168
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:55,887
Boy, with all this passion,
isn't it a shame we're not having sex?

169
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:10,996
I feel trapped.

170
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:14,836
- Want me to open a window?
- No, I'm talking about my life.

171
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:16,306
Oh.

172
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,810
Are we done making out?

173
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:21,142
No, no, keep going.

174
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:23,771
So what's up?

175
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:28,013
I'm unhappy.
With Carlos and my marriage...

176
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:30,988
I feel like I don't have options,
it's driving me crazy.

177
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:34,356
Every time something went south
in my life, I always had a plan B.

178
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:37,157
- Now, I feel like I have nothing.
- What about me?

179
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:40,494
- Can't I be your plan B?
- Damn it, John. What is our new rule?

180
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:43,626
[Sighs] Stop pretending
we have a future.

181
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,763
- Thank you.
- Can't you just walk out?

182
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:50,275
No. If I leave,
I'll be broke and that's awful.

183
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:53,004
If I stay, he's in control
and that's horrifying.

184
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:54,876
And he cut up all my credit cards,

185
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:57,939
which means I'm married to him
and unable to shop.

186
00:11:58,017 --> 00:12:01,077
Which is probably
the worst of all possible worlds.

187
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:04,486
- I'm sorry.
- I'll figure something out.

188
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:09,285
I'm not much fun today.
I'm gonna go.

189
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,395
Wait.

190
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:19,103
- What's this?
- You deserve nice things.

191
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:22,140
And if Mr. Solis
won't provide them, I will.

192
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,974
- With your student credit card?
- I own my own business.

193
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:29,037
- You mow lawns.
- I make good money.

194
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:32,551
I've 20 houses and I'm this close
to getting the country club.

195
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:34,984
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

196
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,558
I'll pay it off.

197
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:47,121
If you want. But you don't have to.

198
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:50,100
Mrs. Solis... To take care of you...

199
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,464
...it's my dream.

200
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:59,307
Well, far be it from me to stand
in the way of a young man's dream.

201
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:04,546
OK, Tom, I will swing by the
dry-cleaners' after I hit the market.

202
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:08,109
I don't know. Porter
has a dentist appointment at 4 pm.

203
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:11,714
So the car might have to wait
until tomorrow.

204
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,259
OK, yeah, I love you too.

205
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:15,987
- Bye-bye.
- Hi, there.

206
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:19,155
I brought you some avocados.
I've a tree but I hate 'em.

207
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:22,359
Your family seems like
the kind that would eat guacamole.

208
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:25,892
Oh, Mrs. McCluskey, thank you.
That is very nice.

209
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:29,668
- So let's make up a batch.
- Oh, um... Now's not a good time.

210
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:32,233
I'm on my way out,
I have a ton of errands.

211
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:35,872
That's great, my car's on the fritz
and I could hitch a ride.

212
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:38,678
- I need to drop by the pharmacy.
- No, I can't.

213
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:41,311
I'm sorry, but I have
a lot of things to do.

214
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:43,514
You could take me later or tomorrow.

215
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:46,422
Mrs. McCluskey,
I'm not gonna have any time tomorrow.

216
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,016
Oh.

217
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:50,561
Interesting you can't
spend two minutes with me

218
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:53,962
but you have no trouble
taking my Tiffany lamp.

219
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:57,161
Oh, for God's sakes!

220
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:02,205
Here. You should take this back. I...

221
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,767
I don't have a place for it.

222
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,108
That was my thank you
for saving my life.

223
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:11,377
I know, and it was
a beautiful gesture, really.

224
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:14,578
- But I just...
- Save it, Lynette.

225
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:16,484
I get the picture.

226
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,024
[Yawns]

227
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,134
- Aah!
- Oh!

228
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:33,797
- Oh, God!
- Susie, this is Tim. [laughs]

229
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:36,365
Sorry if we startled you.

230
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:40,435
Oh, uh... That's OK, I...

231
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:43,640
I just didn't expect to see anybody up
at a quarter to one.

232
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:47,083
Oh, Susie,
you should have come out tonight.

233
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:49,245
I met Tim here at the Islands bar

234
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:52,779
and he introduced me
to this crazy drink.

235
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:54,416
The Dirty Volcano!

236
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:56,188
It's... Whoo!

237
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:58,093
[Sophie] Then we danced...

238
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,422
He dipped me.

239
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:03,229
Sophie's very... limber.

240
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:07,363
Uh, Mom, could I just talk to you
in the family room for a minute?

241
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:10,738
- Oh, sure.
- Susan is your daughter?

242
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:14,407
- Yup.
- No, she can't be!

243
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,504
- Yes!
- No!

244
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,843
- Yeah!
- No!

245
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,406
- Yeah!
- No!

246
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:20,577
- Yes...
- OK, we get it.

247
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:22,382
She looks young.

248
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:24,213
[Mouths silently]

249
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:28,326
Oh, that man has magic fingers.

250
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:30,954
[Whispers] What are you doing?!
I have a daughter.

251
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:34,522
You can't bring men you meet in bars
here in the middle of the night!

252
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,728
We're just having a few laughs.
What's the big deal?

253
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:41,170
You're trying to get over Morty
but this is not the way to do it.

254
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,208
Go out there and tell him to go home.

255
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:47,644
You know how blue I've been.
Why can't you be supportive?

256
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:51,114
- I've been plenty supportive.
- You haven't. You really haven't.

257
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:55,119
Tim is my guest
and he will go home when I say so.

258
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:00,389
If he's not gone in five minutes,

259
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:03,485
I'm gonna go out there
and tell him how old you really are.

260
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:12,636
[Eexaggerated yawn]

261
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:17,404
Tim, it's time for me
to go sleepy-bye. [giggles]

262
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:26,779
[Man] Delfino.

263
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:29,947
Yeah.

264
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,154
You must be Sullivan.

265
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:37,518
The file on Noah's daughter.

266
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:40,087
Yeah, he said you had some leads.

267
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:43,100
Yeah, sure, we got some leads.

268
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:47,172
- Is there a problem?
- Gee, I don't know.

269
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:52,040
I'm handing a confidential police report
over to a killer and drug-dealer.

270
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:54,579
Why should that be a problem?

271
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,808
Thanks.

272
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:02,781
Is this what our justice
system has come to?

273
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:07,155
Guys like you walking the streets
without a care in the world?

274
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:10,992
- I did my time.
- Not enough, you piece of garbage.

275
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:18,102
I'm glad we had the chance to meet.

276
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:22,800
Because apparently I'm no longer
a murder suspect, thanks to you.

277
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,070
I don't want to seem ungrateful,

278
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:27,271
but just out of curiosity,

279
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:32,307
how much does it cost to buy off
a homicide detective these days?

280
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:38,346
Thanks again.

281
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:42,185
Hey, Delfino. One more thing.

282
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:48,860
[Mike groans]

283
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:03,578
Now this file was misplaced...

284
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:05,708
...understand?

285
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:09,880
If even a whisper of this
gets traced back to me,

286
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:13,550
there will be one less
cop-killer on the street.

287
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:23,898
And for God's sakes,
don't get any blood on the file.

288
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:49,116
Ma'am, I'm sorry, but your credit card
has been declined.

289
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:50,957
What?

290
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:54,055
Oh, no, that's impossible.
It's a new card.

291
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,897
I just went shopping with it.
Try it again.

292
00:18:56,969 --> 00:19:00,461
Ma'am, I ran it three times
and then I called the bank.

293
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:03,269
May I try another card?

294
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:06,243
Of course you may.
Will you just give me a moment?

295
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:14,715
[Phone rings]

296
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:16,413
- Hello?
- It's me.

297
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,649
I tried to call.
You turned your cell off.

298
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:22,524
I'm in a lovely restaurant having
a lovely meal that I can't pay for.

299
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:25,290
- Did you order already?
- I ate already.

300
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:27,559
The credit card company
called my mom.

301
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:30,158
They said there was
unusual activity on my card.

302
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:32,328
- I bought shoes!
- I didn't know that.

303
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:34,702
My mom started asking
all these questions

304
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:37,469
so I blurted out it was stolen
and she canceled it.

305
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:39,773
Why call your parents?
It's your account.

306
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,541
They co-sign for it.

307
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:45,981
- If you explain to the waiter...
- What?!

308
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:48,451
My card was canceled
by my lover's mommy?

309
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,388
What other options do you have?
Return the shoes and get the money back?

310
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:54,823
Return the shoes?!

311
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:57,453
I can't talk to you
when you're being hysterical.

312
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:02,865
So, Ma'am, what would you like to do
about the bill?

313
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:19,776
Afternoon, I've got a package
for your neighbor, Karen McCluskey.

314
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:22,615
- Mind signing?
- Isn't she home?

315
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:24,417
No one answered.

316
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:26,719
All right.

317
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:31,121
OK.

318
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:32,561
Thank you.

319
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,398
[Bell rings]

320
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,736
So let me get this straight.

321
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:47,802
You play tennis, you know wine,

322
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:49,642
and you speak Mandarin.

323
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:52,707
Does every other man in the world
want you dead?

324
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:55,344
I'm not that impressive.

325
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,911
I pulled a gray hair
out of my chest this morning.

326
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,891
[Laughs] I don't know,
I'd watch your back.

327
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:05,529
You know, I've really enjoyed
talking to you.

328
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,531
You, uh...

329
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,263
Well, you've made my day.

330
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:13,827
I was thinking,
if you'd like to get together again...

331
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:19,976
Well, Sam, to tell you the truth,
I'm kind of in a relationship right now.

332
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:24,106
- I just wanted to be honest.
- That's perfectly OK, Tina.

333
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:28,953
By the way, this is on me.

334
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:31,649
- Oh, no, you shouldn't.
- Oh, please.

335
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:34,089
[Sam] It's my pleasure.

336
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:45,533
- This is gonna be a disaster.
- It'll be fine. [sighs]

337
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:48,698
Andrew! Honey, hurry up,
dinner's ready!

338
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:51,140
It's like we're setting a trap for him.

339
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:53,404
It's for his own good. You'll see.

340
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:57,814
Smells good. What are we having?

341
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:01,512
I'm making home-made bratwurst
with sweet and sour cabbage.

342
00:22:01,586 --> 00:22:04,578
It's a recipe I found
in an old German cookbook.

343
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,283
[Door chimes]

344
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:09,521
I'll get the door.
Honey, why don't you pour the wine?

345
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:16,867
- Isn't Danielle at Wendy's?
- I believe she is.

346
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:20,462
Well, then, why did Mom
set the table for four places?

347
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:23,667
- Huh?
- I asked, who's coming for dinner?

348
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:28,702
Andrew, you remember
Reverend Sikes, don't you?

349
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,408
[Quietly] Oh, come on.

350
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:35,977
Reverend, why don't you have a seat
and I will get some refreshments.

351
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,019
Ah...

352
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:43,960
So... Andrew...
It's been a long time.

353
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:47,328
Yes. Yes, it has.

354
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:49,697
Would you like some water?
Flat or bubbly?

355
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:51,463
Oh, bubbly, please.

356
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,637
So...

357
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,332
Your mother tells me

358
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:59,901
you've started having
some sexual desires for other boys.

359
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,875
I don't suppose
I could get some of that?

360
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:10,718
No. I'm gonna need every drop.

361
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:16,620
And over the years, we've had so many
young people come to our ministry

362
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:20,062
hating themselves
for their unnatural desires.

363
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:23,329
In a few months, they've found
an inner peace and tranquility

364
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:26,599
that is nothing short of miraculous.

365
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:30,732
All it takes is a little faith
and a desire to change.

366
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:34,802
I'm sorry, but I really don't want
to talk about my sex life.

367
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:38,374
Well, that's too bad,
this needs to be discussed.

368
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:41,886
Bree, please, let the boy speak.

369
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:43,352
Go on.

370
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:47,620
Well, I appreciate your offer to help,
I do. But...

371
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:49,887
I don't hate myself.

372
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:52,020
So... I'm good.

373
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:56,693
Son, I know what it's like to be
a teenager. It's a very confusing time.

374
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,531
I'm not confused.

375
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:01,936
I... I know exactly who I am.

376
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,537
Well...

377
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:12,777
If you ever do want to talk,
my door is always open.

378
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:21,520
Reverend,
I don't mean to criticize but...

379
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:24,255
...it sounds like you're giving up.

380
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:27,696
We can't force him
on a path of righteousness.

381
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:31,395
He himself has got to
want to make the journey.

382
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,928
What do we do? Just stand by
while he starts dating boys?

383
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:38,066
And by the way, the correct word
is not "gay", it's "sodomy".

384
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:40,134
- We're in the middle of dinner.
- So?

385
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:43,147
Can you wait till dessert
to call our son a sodomite?

386
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:45,615
How you can be so casual
is beyond me.

387
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:49,313
I knew this dinner was a bad idea
the moment you suggested it.

388
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:52,948
- At least I'm trying to be proactive.
- Please, no need to get upset.

389
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:56,516
I'm upset because there's a problem
no one seems to notice but me.

390
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:59,621
As far as I'm concerned,
if Andrew is happy with who he is,

391
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:02,189
it is our job to support him.

392
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:13,643
- Your father is into S&M.
- Bree!

393
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:16,180
He makes me beat him
with a riding crop. I let him.

394
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:19,581
No wonder you're perverted.
Look who your parents are.

395
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:28,122
Excuse me.

396
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:32,260
What a fun night.

397
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:35,731
You know, we should probably
do this again sometime.

398
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:48,807
Hey!

399
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,041
Hey, good news!

400
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:53,914
I know why you've been
so furious at me.

401
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:58,081
- I haven't been furious at you.
- Yes, you have. And I don't blame you.

402
00:25:58,156 --> 00:26:01,319
Men have been coming onto me
left and right.

403
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:04,954
And I've been having so much fun
and just enjoying life.

404
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:08,397
And what do I do?
I throw it right in your face.

405
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:11,026
- I'd hate me too.
- Mom, I don't hate you.

406
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:14,128
Well, be that as it may,

407
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:17,003
from here on out,
I'm including you in all the fun.

408
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:20,602
- The fun.
- Mm-hm. Your mother's come through.

409
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:22,874
What have you done?

410
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:25,178
You and I are going
on a double date tonight.

411
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,718
- What?!
- Tim has a friend from the factory.

412
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:31,586
I thought the four of us could hang out,
have drinks, hors d'oeuvres...

413
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:33,487
- Forget it.
- Susie!

414
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:36,857
Mom, I'm sorry, I'm just not
in the mood to hang out these days.

415
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,988
Susie, sweetie, please.
I can't cancel now.

416
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:43,523
Of course you can. Just call them up
and tell them not to come over.

417
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:53,637
- Tim.
- Hi, Suz. This is my buddy, Lamont.

418
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:56,476
I brought peppermint schnapps.

419
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,761
I'm sure she's fine.

420
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:14,162
She never leaves her mail
sitting out there.

421
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:16,393
How many times
has she thrown ours away

422
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,868
because we didn't pick it up
the second it came?

423
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:20,336
That would be five.

424
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:23,135
I don't know,
I think something's happened to her.

425
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:24,903
OK, so go check on her.

426
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:30,004
But if I'm wrong, I'm sucked into a
two-hour conversation about bunions.

427
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:32,072
- Don't go check.
- Six months from now,

428
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:35,210
when they find her corpse
at the bottom of the stairs,

429
00:27:35,286 --> 00:27:38,187
what do I tell the kids?
"Yeah, I let Mrs. McCluskey die."

430
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:39,951
Why would they care?

431
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:44,018
Like they'll miss the dry-cleaning
coupons she hands out on Halloween.

432
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:47,258
- Tom!
- Listen, honey, what can I say?

433
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:50,460
You're damned if you do
and damned if you don't, so...

434
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:53,197
I don't know. Good luck with that.

435
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:55,535
Honey, I'm hating you
a little bit right now.

436
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:00,372
[TV: Applause and chers]

437
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:02,675
Hi, honey! Look at my new shoes.

438
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:05,545
- Yeah.
- Aren't they gorgeous?

439
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:07,517
Honey, I'm trying to watch the game.

440
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:11,387
Sorry.

441
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:17,788
How'd you buy new shoes?

442
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:20,660
Shh! Talk later,
you're watching the game.

443
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:23,098
No, I wanna talk about it now.

444
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:26,934
- You have no money, what's the story?
- Oh, you've heard it before.

445
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:30,873
Girl meets boy, boy buys girl things,
girl leaves happy.

446
00:28:30,942 --> 00:28:32,068
What did you do?

447
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:35,203
I forgot how generous men could be.

448
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,249
I also forgot I have options.
A whole bunch of 'em.

449
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:41,444
- What are you talking about?
- I don't need your credit cards.

450
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:42,850
I don't need your money.

451
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:46,413
But if our marriage is going to work,
I need your respect.

452
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:49,654
- I'm not ripping up the post-nup.
- Yes, you are.

453
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:54,358
Because if you don't, I'm gonna put on
my new shoes and walk out the door.

454
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:58,934
- Are you threatening me?
- No, I'm just pointing something out.

455
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:03,531
I'm a pretty girl.
And pretty girls are never Ionely.

456
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,347
[Music plays, Sophie and Tom laugh]

457
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:22,721
[Sophie] Stop! I'm really ticklish!

458
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:25,524
So, uh, children's books, right?

459
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,087
[Sophie] That tickles!

460
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:32,125
I hope you know how lucky you are. Not
everyone gets to realize their bliss.

461
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:34,603
Yeah, it... it can be rewarding.

462
00:29:34,672 --> 00:29:35,969
[Sophie laughs]

463
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,600
Why don't you join me?

464
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:42,606
No.

465
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,739
I'm really ticklish!

466
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:47,978
- Come on!
- What's wrong?

467
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:51,613
For God's sakes, she's ticklish!
How many times do you have to be told?

468
00:29:51,689 --> 00:29:56,558
Oh... This is so much fun.
Let's find another CD.

469
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:59,722
Mother, don't you think
it's getting a little late?

470
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,595
Come on!

471
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:04,430
You haven't even
finished your schnapps.

472
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:14,336
The perfect capper
to the perfect evening.

473
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:17,506
So, goodnight. It's been lovely.

474
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:19,914
Lamont, good luck
with all your inventions.

475
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:22,475
Well, it's only 11.30.

476
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:24,784
I wanna hit the clubs!

477
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:27,222
I know a great place
just off the interstate.

478
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:30,591
- Warm up the old war wagon.
- Mom, hold it!

479
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:35,496
You are not getting into the car alone
with those two. You barely know them.

480
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:39,936
I have great instincts about people,
you know that.

481
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:44,634
- You've been married four times.
- Yes, but twice to the same guy.

482
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:50,645
- Mother...
- Susie, please, you're embarrassing me.

483
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:54,549
- I'm embarrassing you?
- Yes. And I've had it!

484
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:58,055
All night long, I've been trying
to get you to stop being so crabby.

485
00:30:58,122 --> 00:31:00,613
And you refuse to let me help.

486
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:04,685
Oh, and your idea of helping
is letting Tim just grope you?

487
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:08,459
Hey, you shouldn't talk to your mother
like that, she's a fine lady...

488
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:12,196
- Tim, could you just stay out of it?
- Yeah, mind your own business.

489
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:15,706
- What's your problem, pal?
- Dude, you were feelin' up her mother.

490
00:31:15,773 --> 00:31:20,005
It pissed me off, too.
C'mon, Susie, let's go back inside.

491
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:25,243
Let's go back inside? Lamont,
give it up. You're not getting any.

492
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:27,147
[Tim giggles]

493
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:31,484
Why are you being this way?
I'm just trying to lighten things up.

494
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:34,582
Stop acting like
tonight was about helping me.

495
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:38,060
You wanted to go out and have fun
and Lamont there needed a date.

496
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:40,461
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

497
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,960
OK, fine. It's true.

498
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:47,596
I wanted to get out and have fun.
Why shouldn't I?

499
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:50,835
You know how depressed I've been
over my break-up with Morty.

500
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:51,898
Yeah, I do.

501
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:54,809
That's what makes me crazy,
the difference between us.

502
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:58,474
You can be heartbroken
and you can just... move on.

503
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:00,642
And I...

504
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:03,050
...am just broken.

505
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:12,623
- I know you're sad.
- No, Mom, I'm not sad.

506
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:15,427
And I'm not crabby.

507
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:20,301
I'm devastated. And you keep acting
like all I need is a couple of aspirin.

508
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:25,001
Morty was just one guy
in a series of guys for you.

509
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:27,044
And Mike...

510
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:30,677
He was the one.

511
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:33,743
Why don't you get that?

512
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:43,394
It's Lynette!

513
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:46,487
Hello?!

514
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:49,860
Mrs. McCluskey?

515
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,965
Mrs. McCluskey, are you all right?

516
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,597
How did you get in here?

517
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:59,837
Uh, Mr. Mullins had a spare.

518
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:04,945
- Why didn't you open the door?
- I was hoping you'd go away.

519
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:10,848
- Have you been taking your medication?
- I don't need to.

520
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:15,018
- Sometimes the pain goes by itself.
- Uh-huh.

521
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:18,790
Is that why you didn't open the door,
because of your hands?

522
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:24,131
Mrs. McCluskey, do you have
anyone that could help you out?

523
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:26,762
A relative? A... friend?

524
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,328
I'm fine.

525
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:31,865
OK.

526
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:37,180
OK.

527
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:39,648
Uh... Before you go...

528
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:42,515
Open these, would you,
and put out the pills?

529
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,818
- Yeah.
- Don't get your hands all over them.

530
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:52,795
God knows what your kids pick up.
Last thing I need's a case of pink eye.

531
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:57,361
You're a piece of work, you know that?

532
00:33:57,435 --> 00:34:00,165
This is crazy,
why do they give you child-proof caps?

533
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:04,072
First thing tomorrow, I'll take you
to the pharmacy and get new bottles.

534
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:06,633
Don't do me any favors.
You don't even like me.

535
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:09,145
I don't want you to feel obligated.

536
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:12,671
Let me tell you something.
Half of life is obligations.

537
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:15,947
You don't wanna go to your husband's
company party but you do.

538
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:19,956
You don't wanna sell candy so your kid's
band can buy piccolos, but you do.

539
00:34:20,024 --> 00:34:23,619
You attend your third cousin's wedding,
pick up the dry-cleaning.

540
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:25,423
That's life, it's obligations.

541
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:28,855
And you are now my obligation.

542
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:31,265
So tomorrow morning,
we go to the pharmacy.

543
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:34,668
Gee, I'm touched
by your outpouring of compassion.

544
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,401
We don't have to be friends.

545
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:40,000
But we're two human beings,

546
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,807
living on the same piece of earth.

547
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:45,576
We can at least try and
help each other out once in a while.

548
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:51,752
And you know what?

549
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:57,718
I am going to take this.

550
00:34:57,795 --> 00:34:59,524
Fine.

551
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:02,395
- I'll see you tomorrow morning.
- Pick me up at nine.

552
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:05,597
And don't be late.

553
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:15,412
Andrew, come here,
I want you to see this.

554
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:20,748
Uh... What are you looking at?

555
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:23,753
I'm looking at your baby pictures.

556
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:25,618
Look at that one.

557
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:31,622
- How old was I there?
- Just four weeks old.

558
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:36,923
[Sighs]

559
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:43,165
I never told you this, but when
I gave birth to you there were...

560
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:44,902
...complications.

561
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:50,706
The umbilical cord wrapped around
your neck and you stopped breathing.

562
00:35:50,781 --> 00:35:53,341
The room got very quiet.

563
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:55,749
And I knew you were in trouble.

564
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,584
So I turned to the doctor
and I very calmly said

565
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:03,286
that he was not to worry about me,
that his job was to save your life.

566
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:05,852
When I say I would die for you...

567
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,929
...that's not an expression.

568
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:13,466
I mean it.

569
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:15,301
Yeah, well, uh...

570
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:19,275
I'm gonna go eat my sandwich.

571
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:23,040
Andrew, please,
just go and talk to Reverend Sikes.

572
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:25,344
- Oh, for God's sakes.
- He can counsel you.

573
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:28,180
- It can help.
- Mom, I don't need any help.

574
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:32,382
All right? I'm fine.
Why do you keep going on about this?

575
00:36:32,456 --> 00:36:36,290
Because if you don't change who you are
then you won't go to heaven.

576
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:41,454
[Snorts]

577
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,063
You, uh...

578
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:48,061
You don't think I'll go to heaven?

579
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:50,266
No, I don't.

580
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:56,144
And I need you there.
I would be so Ionely without you.

581
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,519
Well...

582
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:06,045
I guess... I'd better
go talk to Reverend Sikes.

583
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:08,557
Oh, Andrew!

584
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:12,824
Thank you so much! You don't know
how much that means to me.

585
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,900
Oh! My gosh!

586
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:21,700
Are you OK?

587
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:25,139
Oh, yeah, I just, uh, fell down
the stairs. I'm fine.

588
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:28,440
- What's up?
- Susan still loves you.

589
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:33,477
Wow, uh... OK...

590
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:36,784
This is not a good time
for this conversation.

591
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:39,584
She just misses you so much.

592
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:43,218
I just found out that
someone I was very close to is dead.

593
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:45,125
I've got to figure out what to do,

594
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:48,324
so I just don't have time
to think about Susan right now.

595
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:51,300
She's just very, very unhappy
and if you could just...

596
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:53,735
I really don't.

597
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:55,772
I'm sorry.

598
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:36,146
I swear before Almighty God I won't
reveal a word that's said here today.

599
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:39,273
Now, what's on your mind?

600
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:45,113
Well, here's the thing.
I lied to my parents.

601
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:48,283
- I'm not gay.
- You're not.

602
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:49,849
Not really.

603
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:54,794
All I know is, I wanted
to get the hell out of that camp.

604
00:38:54,865 --> 00:38:57,095
So... I lied to my parents.

605
00:38:57,168 --> 00:39:01,696
I told them I was really worried that
I was having feelings for other guys.

606
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:04,297
They did exactly
what I wanted them to.

607
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:09,210
- They're such tools.
- I'm sorry, just so I'm clear.

608
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,680
Are you a heterosexual or aren't you?

609
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:14,081
Look... [clears throat]

610
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:17,609
I love vanilla ice cream, OK?

611
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:22,455
But, every now and then, I'm probably
gonna be in the mood for chocolate.

612
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,960
You know what I'm saying?

613
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:30,897
I do. But God would prefer
you... stick to the vanilla.

614
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:33,732
I don't believe in God.

615
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:35,863
- You don't?
- No.

616
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,067
Sorry.

617
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,501
Your mother's gonna be devastated.

618
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:44,013
She's been praying so hard
for you to change.

619
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:46,515
Well, that's the good news.

620
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:49,075
I am gonna change. Big time.

621
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:51,986
L-I'm not sure I follow.

622
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:58,559
You know what my mom
said to me last night?

623
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:02,030
She said she doesn't think
I'm going to heaven.

624
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:04,693
Can you believe that?

625
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:08,068
I'm sure she didn't mean
to hurt your feelings.

626
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:13,008
But the only way you can know paradise
is by repenting your sins.

627
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:18,173
When she said that to me,

628
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:21,275
it suddenly hit me
how I was gonna get back at her.

629
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:26,119
From now on,
I'm going to be so good, I'm...

630
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:29,648
I'm gonna eat my vegetables,
I'm gonna get good grades,

631
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:31,695
say "Yes, ma'am"
and "No, ma'am."

632
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:36,290
I'm gonna make her believe
that God has delivered her...

633
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:39,200
...this little miracle.

634
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:43,104
Until one day,
when she least expects it...

635
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:49,546
...I'm gonna do something so awful,
it is going to rock her world.

636
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:53,208
I mean, it is really
going to destroy her.

637
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,280
And when that day comes,

638
00:40:58,255 --> 00:41:00,052
trust me,

639
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,592
I'll know paradise.

640
00:41:14,672 --> 00:41:18,608
[Mary Alice] Yes, life is a journey,

641
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:24,012
one that is much better traveled
with a companion by our side.

642
00:41:24,081 --> 00:41:27,915
Of course, that companion
can be just about anyone.

643
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,646
Mrs. McCluskey!

644
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:32,451
We're gonna be late for the doctor!

645
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:34,957
A neighbor
on the other side of the stret...

646
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:38,119
I'm coming, Jeez! Hold your water!

647
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:44,028
There you go. No more post-nup.

648
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:47,593
...or the man
on the other side of the bed.

649
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:56,744
The companion can be
a mother with good intentions...

650
00:41:56,814 --> 00:42:00,580
- Thank you for a wonderful service.
- Thank you so much, Bree.

651
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:03,848
...or a child who's up to no good.

652
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:06,651
Very inspirational.

653
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:14,058
Still, despite our best intentions,

654
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:19,467
some of us will lose
our companions along the way.

655
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:24,236
And then the journey
becomes unbearable.

656
00:42:27,411 --> 00:42:33,145
You se, human beings
are designed for many things.

657
00:42:34,151 --> 00:42:38,645
But loneliness isn't one of them.
