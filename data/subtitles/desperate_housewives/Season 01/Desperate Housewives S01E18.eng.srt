2
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,094
Previously on Desperate Housewives...

3
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:04,500
Is anybody here?

4
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:07,096
There may have been
a breakdown in our care.

5
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:08,504
You trying to buy us off?

6
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:10,202
If you're not careful...

7
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:12,471
There's this place called Camp Hennessy.

8
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:15,378
I'm not going to any camp
for juvenile delinquents.

9
00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:16,847
You don't have a choice.

10
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:18,213
...past mistakes...

11
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:20,149
We pulled it out of Rockwater Lake.

12
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,518
I must have sold
several hundred of these.

13
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:24,784
I have a list
of customers' names on file.

14
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,849
...will come back to haunt you.

15
00:00:26,926 --> 00:00:30,862
I won't tell anyone.
I'll keep your secret, Dad.

16
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:37,297
There were many things
Gabrielle Solis knew for certain.

17
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:42,001
She knew red was her color.

18
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:47,577
She knew diamonds went with everything.

19
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:51,083
And she knew men were all the same.

20
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:58,748
But the one thing Gabrielle knew
above all else,

21
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:02,558
she would never want children.

22
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:08,996
Unfortunately for Gabrielle,

23
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,732
her husband Carlos felt differently.

24
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:29,820
I'm so lucky to have you.

25
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:32,655
OK, I'll bite.

26
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,855
Why are you so lucky?

27
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,453
Because...

28
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,029
I don't want to have kids and you do.

29
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,069
Oh, that.

30
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:47,266
Most men would leave
over something like that.

31
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,241
And you're still here.

32
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,768
I'm grateful.
I know the sacrifice you're making.

33
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:57,248
There's still a part of me
that's hoping to change your mind.

34
00:01:57,317 --> 00:02:01,913
Once you had a baby, I think
you would love it so much that...

35
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:05,014
Honey, it's not gonna happen.

36
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:09,050
- You never know.
- No, sometimes you do.

37
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,893
Well, it is a sacrifice.

38
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:17,335
But you're worth it.

39
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:27,077
Yes, Gabrielle Solis knew without a
doubt she didn't want to be a mother.

40
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,115
But what she couldn't know was

41
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:32,481
just how much
her husband wanted to be a father,

42
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:37,751
or that he'd ben tampering
with her birth control for months.

43
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,092
Or that within one wek's time...

44
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,490
...she'd be pregnant.

45
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:38,213
Saturdays on Wisteria Lane
belong to the children.

46
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:43,221
And while most would spend the day
practicing their sports,

47
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:45,985
and riding their bikes,

48
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:50,352
and jumping their ropes,

49
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:54,025
others were no longer
engaged in child's play.

50
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:59,003
Inded, some children were being forced
to grow up very quickly.

51
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,870
Sorry to bother you.
We have a few questions for you.

52
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:03,772
About what?

53
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:08,837
Twelve years ago, your late wife
purchased a toy chest.

54
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,610
Toy chest?

55
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:15,581
Yeah, it was about this big,
had little dancing bears on it.

56
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:19,091
Gosh, I'm sorry.

57
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:22,787
The craftsman who makes these chests
keeps a list of customers.

58
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:26,229
Apparently,
you purchased one in August 1992.

59
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:30,099
We'd like to know
where that chest is now.

60
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:32,660
Wow, I, uh... wish I could help you.

61
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:34,969
I don't recall any toy chest.

62
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,032
[Zach] I remember.

63
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,544
It had little bears
and balloons on it, right?

64
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,773
Yes, son, that's right.

65
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,611
We threw it away when I was little.

66
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:46,151
I was standing on it and it busted.

67
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:49,017
- Remember, Dad?
- Vaguely.

68
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,022
I guess that's all, then.

69
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:57,892
Thank you both for your time.

70
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:01,229
Hey. What's the deal
with this chest, anyway?

71
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,429
One just like you had
washed up on Torch Lake.

72
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:07,166
- It had a woman in it.
- A woman?

73
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:12,500
She was all chopped up.

74
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:25,118
Obviously, we need to talk.

75
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:33,294
You lied to me.
You said it was a man in the box.

76
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:34,594
No, I didn't lie.

77
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,864
The policeman said it was
a woman's body. You were lying.

78
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:40,269
I told you a detective came
to take you away.

79
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,433
I never said it was a man.

80
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:45,540
- You didn't?
- No.

81
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:47,442
- L-I thought that...
- No.

82
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,572
Stop. Please stop. I...

83
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:52,743
I know you're lying to me, OK?
I know that you're lying.

84
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:56,050
For the last time, someone came
and tried to take you away...

85
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:57,919
Yes, a woman.

86
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,823
- A woman came.
- Yes, she tried to steal you.

87
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:03,828
From the only family
that you'd ever really known.

88
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:07,696
And we couldn't let that happen.
And we didn't.

89
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:10,065
And that...

90
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:12,001
...is the truth.

91
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:20,476
[Rex] We can't cancel now.
It's two days away.

92
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,673
I'm not going.
That's all there is to it.

93
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:25,582
Counseling is part of the treatment
at Camp Hennessy.

94
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:28,814
Nowhere in that brochure
did it say we're expected to attend.

95
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,186
What'll Andrew think
if you don't show up?

96
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:35,250
I'm making him this care package.
He'll know that I'm thinking about him.

97
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:38,991
Why are you putting in lemon squares?
They told us not to send him sweets.

98
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,589
I don't understand why.

99
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:44,500
I guess they feel baked goods from Mom
undercut the boot-camp experience.

100
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,664
Fine, I won't send them.
But I think it's a stupid rule.

101
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,571
Are you going to this thing or not?

102
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:50,768
- No
- Why?

103
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:53,607
Because the minute I get there,
Andrew will start...

104
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:56,443
...attacking me for abandoning him.

105
00:06:56,516 --> 00:07:00,043
- And I don't want to hear it.
- There's no reason to feel guilty.

106
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:02,178
You did everything you could for him.

107
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,246
I don't feel guilty.

108
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:09,552
OK.

109
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:24,208
Please, Christy.

110
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:29,146
There's no way I can get another
babysitter this late in the day.

111
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:31,740
- Parker, knock it off.
- No.

112
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:35,083
Because I'm having drinks
with friends I used to work with.

113
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:37,554
They never call
and if I blow them off,

114
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,682
that's it, I'm dead to them.

115
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,783
[Children yell]

116
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,192
No, I can't call Patty Binks.

117
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:48,331
Because she steals things.
Damn it, Christy, you're 13.

118
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:51,370
You got a lot of trips to the mall
ahead of you.

119
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:56,773
OK, I'm sorry. I'm sorry
I raised my voice. I'm calm.

120
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:59,471
So I'm starting to think
that this is about money.

121
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:02,343
So what is it that will make it
worth your while?

122
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:06,351
A hundred! That's extortion.
There's no way in hell that I'm gonna...

123
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:07,977
Hello?

124
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:09,544
Hello?

125
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:14,955
Parker, I swear I will spank you.
Knock it off.

126
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:16,824
[Phone beeps]

127
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:20,957
Hi, Mrs. Binks.
Is Patty there? Thank you.

128
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:25,900
Hi, honey. I'm back.

129
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,663
Hey, sweetie.

130
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:31,608
This is Mr. Steinberg,
the attorney from the hospital.

131
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:35,374
- Oh, have we met?
- Yes, Mrs. Solis. We've met.

132
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:37,348
Don't you remember?

133
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,475
It was after Mama died.

134
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,747
Apparently the hospital was negligent

135
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:44,688
and agreed to
a seven-figure settlement check.

136
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:47,624
A check I was never told about.

137
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,687
Oh, that.

138
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:53,758
I...

139
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:59,071
- Mr. Steinberg...
- I was just leaving.

140
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,946
- What were you thinking?!
- Let me explain.

141
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:16,887
- Why the hell didn't you tell me?!
- You wouldn't make the right decision.

142
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:19,754
The right decision
was to use that money for my lawyers,

143
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:23,090
to fight the indictment
instead of taking the plea bargain.

144
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:25,926
The government would have
seized the settlement.

145
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:29,991
- We could have fought that in court.
- And you would have blown the money.

146
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:33,596
Who cares?! If there was a chance
I didn't have to go to jail?!

147
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:37,109
You had Laotian convicts sewing
casual wear for two cents an hour.

148
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:39,701
Don't you think you deserve a time-out?

149
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:43,772
Eight months. Thanks to you,
I'm going away for eight months.

150
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:47,979
When you get out, we'll have money
to start over with. Thanks to me.

151
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:56,153
You know, once you calm down, you're
gonna realize I did the right thing.

152
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:59,686
And when that happens,
I'd appreciate an apology.

153
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,008
[Tires screech, loud crash]

154
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,414
Grandma's here.

155
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:24,616
[Grandma] Oh!

156
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:29,017
Now that is just... perfect.

157
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:31,553
Stay put.

158
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:37,263
- [Grandma] I am so sorry!
- Hey, Mom.

159
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:40,203
Oh, hey, Susie.

160
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:42,604
- I goofed.
- [Susan] What happened?

161
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:46,406
Oh, you know me.
No depth perception whatsoever.

162
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,879
I'm stunned
they even issued me a license.

163
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:51,246
So, you're Susan's mom.

164
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,410
Yeah.

165
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,249
I'm Sophie Bremmer. And you are?

166
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,720
Mike Delfino.

167
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:01,523
You're Mike?! Oh, my God!

168
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:04,290
Susan's told me so much about you!

169
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:07,526
Well, don't just stand there.
Give me a hug!

170
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:15,602
Mom. Uh... Mike and I aren't...
together anymore.

171
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:19,674
Oh! Sorry.

172
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:23,680
I guess I just made this
pretty awkward, huh?

173
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:26,217
Yeah, you... you really did.

174
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:28,617
So let's just call
the insurance company.

175
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,019
OK.

176
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:33,490
Well... It's nice
meeting you anyway, Mike.

177
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:36,960
You too. I never would've guessed
you were Susan's mom.

178
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,793
I know. I look too young.

179
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,425
I got pregnant
when I was a tiny teenager.

180
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:45,470
- OK...
- The first time I got drunk, ever.

181
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,267
- Can you believe it?
- Let's go.

182
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:51,867
Her father was a marine. Afterwards,
he gave me three of his medals.

183
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:54,538
- Mom!
- What?

184
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:57,309
Let's go inside
and call the insurance company.

185
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,010
[Sophie] Oh, right.

186
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:10,018
What are you smiling about?

187
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:15,363
I used to have all these questions
about how you got to be the way you are.

188
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:18,369
They were all just answered.

189
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:38,486
Hi!

190
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:41,754
[Lynette] Hi!

191
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:44,892
Hi!

192
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:46,761
What's going on?

193
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:48,800
Oh, uh...

194
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:54,068
- My babysitter cancelled.
- Oh, Lynette, I'm so swamped today.

195
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:57,109
My house is a mess and
I've got millions of errands to run.

196
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:59,371
Please hear me out. This is important.

197
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:03,006
Today, I have a chance to rejoin
the human race for a few hours.

198
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:06,074
There are actual adults
waiting for me with margaritas.

199
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:09,315
Look, I'm in a dress. I have make-up on.

200
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:12,585
- If it were any other day.
- Bree, I'm wearing pantyhose.

201
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:18,562
- Bring them in.
- Thank you, thank you.

202
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,155
OK, in you go.

203
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:22,359
Then the police showed me his mug shot.

204
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:23,958
- No!
- Yes.

205
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:27,301
Mike served time
for selling drugs and manslaughter.

206
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:30,240
- I can't believe it.
- Well, it's true.

207
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:34,268
- He has such nice manners.
- I know.

208
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:40,285
Susie, I don't want you worrying
too much about this Mike thing.

209
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:45,415
The right man will come along.
Just give it time.

210
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,619
I would have given up entirely
if it weren't for you and Morty.

211
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,122
- Morty?
- Yeah, you know.

212
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:56,157
It's the third time around for
both of you and you're really clicking.

213
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:58,260
Oh. It gives me hope.

214
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,837
- What's wrong?
- Nothing, nothing. Um...

215
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,174
I'm just... I'm tired.

216
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:10,647
You're not tired. You took a nap.
What is it?

217
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:16,354
- I left Morty.
- What?! Why?

218
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,356
Because he shoved me.

219
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:20,289
Morty? No!

220
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,157
You think I'm lying? Fine!

221
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:26,164
- Why would he shove you?
- I confronted him.

222
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:30,066
About how much time he's spending
at that damned pancake restaurant.

223
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:32,126
If that's where he's really been.

224
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,434
Oh, you can't be serious. Morty?

225
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:36,974
You think men his age don't have needs?

226
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,135
You should see the waitresses he hires.

227
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,839
Every year,
they get younger and younger.

228
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:45,611
Maybe you feel that way because
every year you get older and older.

229
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:48,175
- That's a horrible thing to say.
- I'm sorry.

230
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:50,688
- I'm not that old.
- I said I was sorry.

231
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:55,216
- People think we're sisters.
- That's 'cause you tell them that.

232
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:58,593
One time. You've gotta let go of that.

233
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:03,624
OK, look. I am just saying that
I don't think Morty cheated on you.

234
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:05,863
Well, he did shove me.

235
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:08,532
And the least you can do
is be supportive.

236
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:11,633
You're right. You're right.

237
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,679
- He also threw a book at me.
- Oh, come on!

238
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:20,685
I mean... He shouldn't have done that.

239
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,721
Huh. Thank you.

240
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:38,701
Porter, honey, those cookies are hot.

241
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,501
Wait a few minutes
and I'll give you one, OK?

242
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:47,740
You know, pictures are prettier
if you color inside the lines.

243
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:54,508
[Sighs] Well, art is subjective.

244
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:59,649
- Porter! What did I tell you?
- But I'm hungry.

245
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:04,594
Then I will fix you a very nice bowl
of peaches and cottage cheese.

246
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:07,530
- Ew! Barf!
- Don't be common, young man.

247
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:10,397
Come on. If you play
with those cookies one more time,

248
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,130
I'm gonna have to spank you.

249
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:15,173
- We don't get spanked.
- Really?

250
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,232
Mommy always says she's gonna
but she never does.

251
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,301
Well, I am not your mommy.

252
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,779
And if you misbehave in my house,

253
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:24,941
you will get spanked.

254
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:27,008
So be good.

255
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,791
[Crash of metal]

256
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:44,627
[Bree gasps]

257
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:48,264
- It was an accident.
- Porter, I warned you.

258
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,830
I'll be good.

259
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:54,345
Those cookies were made from scratch.

260
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:57,109
Your fate is sealed.

261
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,877
Come here.

262
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:00,475
No, no!

263
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:04,613
[Porter] Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

264
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:09,585
What's that?

265
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:12,459
It's called a post-nuptial agreement.

266
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:16,826
- It's a legal document...
- I know what a post-nup is.

267
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:18,870
What is it doing on my coffee table?

268
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:22,498
I can forgive that stunt you pulled
with the settlement check,

269
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:25,873
if I'm sure you'll really
be around when I get out of jail.

270
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:28,078
Hm.

271
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:31,810
And the post-nup changes
the terms of the pre-nup, so...

272
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:35,843
So if you try and divorce me
while I'm gone...

273
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:38,014
...you get nothing.

274
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,887
You don't trust me?

275
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,483
- Afraid not.
- Well, that's too bad.

276
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,052
Because I'm not signing
that piece of paper.

277
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:48,429
You're a very beautiful woman,
Gabrielle.

278
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:52,698
But... you're not very bright.

279
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:56,102
If you don't sign it,

280
00:17:56,175 --> 00:18:00,373
I'll pull the plug on
the settlement agreement, divorce you,

281
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:05,474
and then you get what amounts to
about 50º% of our current savings,

282
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:08,076
which is basically nothing.

283
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,354
So what do you expect to happen
right now, Carlos?

284
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:17,020
I'll sign the paper
and jump right back into your arms?

285
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,792
It doesn't mean that I don't love you.

286
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:22,459
You know I think
you're the perfect woman.

287
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,867
Oh, but I'm not. I have flaws.

288
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:34,811
- Flaws?
- Mm-hm.

289
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,905
I'll give you an example.

290
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:39,280
Remember the time when you were in jail

291
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:41,911
and you told me
about your secret compartment

292
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:45,320
and you told me to burn
the papers that I found in there?

293
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:49,019
Well, me being pretty
and therefore stupid,

294
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:51,187
I forgot.

295
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,163
You didn't burn the papers.

296
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:56,633
Worse. I read them.

297
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:59,398
- OK, OK...
- You have a nerve talking about trust

298
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:02,065
with a secret bank account
in the Cayman Islands!

299
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:05,577
- That was a safety net for both of us.
- I'll bet.

300
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,909
- Have you told anyone about this?
- No, but I could.

301
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,473
Isn't that why the prosecution
didn't have a case against you?

302
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:14,849
They couldn't find the profits you made.

303
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,788
So if I were you,
I wouldn't mention the words divorce,

304
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:22,258
trust, or post-nup ever again.

305
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,887
You don't wanna piss me off.

306
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:36,563
I know, baby. It hurts to lose.

307
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:45,273
Ante up.

308
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,682
Well, look at me!

309
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:51,587
Finally in on one of your legendary
poker parties.

310
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:54,387
Susan's always telling me
how much fun you have.

311
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:58,293
The rules are simple. We play for cash,
the dealer picks the game,

312
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:01,560
and unsubstantiated gossip
is encouraged.

313
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:05,569
Bree, thanks again for watching my boys.
They weren't too much to handle?

314
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:09,573
We had a wonderful time. Although
I think Porter had a little less fun.

315
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:11,370
OK, I'll bet.

316
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:14,935
So, Sophie, Susan says
you're going to the spa tomorrow.

317
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:18,141
- Is it an all-day thing?
- What do you mean, Porter had less fun?

318
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:21,414
- I'll raise.
- He misbehaved, so I had to punish him.

319
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:25,149
Yes, Susan is treating me
to an entire day of...

320
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,387
When you say punishment,
what exactly are we talking about?

321
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,519
Oh, I had to spank him.

322
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:32,826
OK, I will re-raise.

323
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,597
You spanked my son?

324
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:43,206
Las Brisas Spa.
Yup, that's where we're going.

325
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,902
Lynette, is there a problem?

326
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,540
Tom and I don't believe
in hitting our kids.

327
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:52,777
Sorry, I didn't know.

328
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:56,082
It won't happen again.

329
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,058
Of course, I'm somewhat
surprised you don't spank them.

330
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:04,061
Everybody knows they're a little bit...
out of control.

331
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:09,361
Wow, I am dragging today.
Shall we put on another pot of coffee?

332
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,425
Yeah, I'll do it.

333
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,706
I'II... I'll fold.

334
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:19,540
Yeah, you're right, Bree.
I've got a lot to learn about parenting.

335
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:22,011
I feel so blessed
to be getting sage advice

336
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,071
from an impeccable mother like you.

337
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:27,312
Your kids turned out perfect,
if you don't count Andrew.

338
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:29,513
Where is he, again?

339
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:33,149
Some kind of a boot camp
for juvenile delinquents?

340
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:35,216
OK, girls.

341
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,159
I never said I was perfect.

342
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:39,754
- Honey, nobody's blaming you.
- The hell I'm not.

343
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:41,458
Lynette...

344
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,608
If you will excuse me.

345
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:58,142
- Lynette, will you go after her?
- She spanked my son.

346
00:21:58,216 --> 00:22:00,411
I'm not apologizing.

347
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:08,351
Usually, poker is more fun than this.

348
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:09,451
Oh.

349
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:13,294
So help me, if you don't back me up
on this, I will lose it.

350
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:17,802
Yes, Bree shouldn't have spanked Porter.
But it's not like she hurt him.

351
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:21,361
That is not the point. You don't spank
other people's children.

352
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,375
He was misbehaving.
She had to do something.

353
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:28,174
But make no mistake,
she definitely crossed the line.

354
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:31,738
Damn right. She could've tried
something else, like a time-out,

355
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:34,581
or she could've simply
threatened to spank him.

356
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:38,020
Yeah, 'cause that works out
so well when we do it.

357
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,888
It does work.
It does work most of the time.

358
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:45,862
It used to work. They've figured out
it's an empty threat. They're onto us.

359
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:50,426
My mom used to beat the hell
out of my sisters and me,

360
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:52,231
and I won't do it.

361
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:55,969
I will not become my mother.

362
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:02,371
Fine.

363
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:05,541
But the boys
are getting older and smarter.

364
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:07,278
And eventually, believe me,

365
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:10,480
they'll figure out
that they outnumber us and then...

366
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,216
We're screwed.

367
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,216
Exactly.

368
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,331
[Groans with effort]

369
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:33,873
Excuse me, Zachary. Would you mind
helping me with these bags?

370
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:36,971
There's some banana bread
in it for you if you do.

371
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:39,778
Uh, yeah, sure.

372
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:44,550
Mm. This is really good, Mrs. Tillman.
Thanks a lot.

373
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:46,523
You're welcome, Zachary.

374
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:49,059
I've never been
in Mrs. Huber's house before.

375
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:52,187
Obviously you haven't missed much.

376
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:56,598
This is the place
where good taste goes to die.

377
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:03,864
So, I heard you and your father
arguing the other day.

378
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,376
- Everything all right at home?
- Yeah.

379
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:09,005
We just have... problems, sometimes.

380
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:13,384
I bet you miss your mother.

381
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:18,287
I'm sure things were...
different when she was alive.

382
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:21,291
Such a warm, loving woman.

383
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:25,761
You...

384
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,663
...knew my mother?

385
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:32,931
Yup. Years ago, in Utah.
We worked together.

386
00:24:34,372 --> 00:24:37,933
- I didn't know that.
- It's true.

387
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,969
In fact...

388
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,676
...I'll tell you a secret.

389
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:48,150
I once met you
when you were a little baby.

390
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:50,682
Really?

391
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:52,620
Mm-hm.

392
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:59,028
Your mother loved you so much, Zachary.

393
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:03,534
Of all the things I remember,

394
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:07,464
I remember that the most.

395
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:21,047
You wanna know what else I remember?

396
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:27,419
How lovely your original name was.

397
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:35,496
Dana?

398
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,607
[Piano music, fountains tinkle]

399
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:50,473
Isn't this nice?

400
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,109
Just the two of us girls hanging out,

401
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:55,175
getting pretty.

402
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:59,383
- Oh, thank you.
- My pleasure.

403
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:03,894
So, I was thinking
maybe you should call Morty.

404
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:06,556
You know, get started
working things out?

405
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:11,500
Why work things out
with a man who abuses me?

406
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,901
[Gasps]

407
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:15,940
You don't have to gasp.
My mother exaggerates.

408
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:18,339
She won't be happy till I have bruises.

409
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,345
Um, can we just focus?
What I want to know is,

410
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:26,146
have you thought about what's going to
happen if you don't go back to Morty?

411
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:28,014
What do you mean?

412
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:31,749
Well, you don't have a place to live,
you don't like to work,

413
00:26:31,823 --> 00:26:35,259
you didn't want to marry Morty
so he doesn't have to pay you alimony.

414
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:40,822
If you don't go back to this man who
allegedly shoved you once in five years,

415
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:43,527
what are your options?

416
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,467
I thought I could live with you.

417
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:46,868
What?!

418
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:49,463
Oh, God! Are you all right?!

419
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:51,805
- Get away!
- I'm so sorry. I was startled.

420
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:53,400
Here, lean your head back.

421
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:56,276
I'm not saying permanently,
just a couple of years.

422
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:59,579
- You broke my nose.
- No, it's just banged a little.

423
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:02,711
- Till I get back on my feet.
- Can we talk about this later?

424
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:06,314
- Should we call 911?
- It's just a nosebleed. She's fine.

425
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:10,088
- I thought you'd be excited.
- It's not that I'm not excited.

426
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:12,220
I'm not stupid, Susan.

427
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:15,962
It's obvious you don't want me here.

428
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:18,969
No, that's not true! Mom, don't go!

429
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:21,232
Mom, come back!

430
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,603
You know, I need to...

431
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,466
- We're good, right?
- Just go.

432
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,904
[Sobs]

433
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,297
[Mouths silently]

434
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:17,355
Why aren't you dressed yet?

435
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:21,991
I wanted to wear Andrew's favorite color
and then I realized that...

436
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:25,864
...I don't know what it is.

437
00:28:25,937 --> 00:28:30,135
Honey, I think the fact you decided
to come at all will make him happy.

438
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,335
Yours is blue.

439
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:35,106
Danielle loves pink.

440
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:39,310
And I have no idea
what my own son's favorite color is.

441
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:42,615
- I'm telling you, it doesn't matter.
- How can you say that?

442
00:28:42,687 --> 00:28:44,348
- Of course it matters.
- Bree...

443
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:48,153
That is a good mother. Someone
who knows their child inside and out

444
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:52,094
so that if they get in trouble,
they know what to do.

445
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:54,020
[Sighs]

446
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:57,194
I don't know him well enough.

447
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,531
You are a good mother.

448
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:13,341
Brown or green? I... just don't know.

449
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:19,517
I'm gonna wait in the car.

450
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,786
Whenever you're ready.

451
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,560
Green.

452
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:34,401
I'll go with the green.
Everybody loves green.

453
00:29:55,493 --> 00:30:00,089
- I told you. I'm not signing this.
- Oh, I think you are.

454
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:03,760
Because if you don't,
I will divorce you.

455
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,768
Then I'll go to the police.

456
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,070
And tell them what?

457
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:16,512
There's a secret bank account in the
Cayman Islands that no longer exists?

458
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:19,175
- You moved the money?
- Of course I moved the money.

459
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,121
That was risky. I mean,
the Feds are watching you right now.

460
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:29,592
I had to do something.

461
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:34,325
I couldn't just let you
make a fool out of me.

462
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:42,533
Oh! Stop, Carlos, stop it!

463
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:44,632
- Put me down!
- OK.

464
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:46,199
Put me down!

465
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,612
Let me go!

466
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:52,809
Stop! You're hurting me, Carlos!

467
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,851
Sign it.

468
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,188
Sign it!

469
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:13,361
[Carlos] I know, baby.

470
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:17,070
It hurts to lose.

471
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:49,469
Mr. And Mrs. Van De Kamp?

472
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,770
Uh, yes. Is it our turn?

473
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:55,779
Well, uh, sort of.
Andrew's waiting inside but, uh...

474
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:56,939
What's wrong?

475
00:31:57,015 --> 00:32:02,043
Well, he said he won't go forward with
the session if... his mother's involved.

476
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,645
He only wants to talk to his dad.

477
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:08,089
We drove 200 miles to be here today.
This is unacceptable.

478
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,650
Yeah, I share your frustration.

479
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:13,623
To hell with him, then.
We're going home.

480
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:16,166
- No.
- I'm not gonna let him insult you.

481
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:20,068
He blames me for his being here.
He blames me for everything.

482
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:25,107
- And he's probably right.
- Any mistakes were made by both of us.

483
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:29,178
One of us should go talk to him,
see how he is.

484
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:31,477
I'm OK.

485
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:35,349
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

486
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:40,619
Right this way.

Mom! Mom!

490
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:14,147
I'm coming. What is it?
Why aren't you brushing your teeth?

491
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,584
[Boys giggle]

492
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:19,425
- What happened?
- Porter pushed me and it fell in.

493
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,965
- He pushed me first.
- Can I flush it?

494
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:24,501
No, no, I'll fish it out later.

495
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:29,006
You're off the hook tonight
but not you two, so start brushing.

496
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:34,377
Preston, did you not hear me?
I said start brushing your teeth.

497
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:36,936
What are you doing?

498
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:40,650
Don't you dare.

499
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:42,276
[Boys] Do it! Do it!

500
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:46,346
Don't listen to them. Back away
from the toilet and no one gets hurt.

501
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:47,823
Do it! Do it!

502
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:50,588
I mean it this time.
These are not just words.

503
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:52,424
Do it! Do it!

504
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:55,625
If you do this, so help me...

505
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,726
[Mary Alice]
Hearing the hollowness of her own voice,

506
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:02,705
Lynette realized that it was time
to get one step ahead.

507

[Boys] Do it! Do it!

508
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:07,241
I will walk you over
to Mrs. Van De Kamp's

509
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:10,474
and we all know what happens
when she gets mad.

510
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:14,346
Now...

511
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:17,813
Go brush your teeth.
I want 'em to sparkle. Go on.

512
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:25,362
Sorry you had to bring your kid back.
What happened this time?

513
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:28,763
A couple of months back,
I caught Tug going through my purse.

514
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:31,893
Oh, I hate when they do that.

515
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:36,201
- Was he looking for weed or money?
- Who knows at this point?

516
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:40,370
Anyway, I'd knocked a couple back
and things got heated.

517
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:44,211
Pretty soon we're both screaming,
throwing stuff round the apartment.

518
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:46,580
Next thing,
lady upstairs calls the cops.

519
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:48,744
[Woman] Oh, gimme a break.

520
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:57,989
So, now I got some social worker
telling me how to raise my boy.

521
00:34:58,062 --> 00:35:01,088
Kids! Boy, if I knew then
what I know now,

522
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:05,568
I would've had that hysterectomy
20 years ago.

523
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:07,297
[Women laugh]

524
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:18,274
- Uh, Bree...
- Don't get up. I'll be quick.

525
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:24,151
All any parent can do is provide their
child with the tools to succeed in life.

526
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:27,419
Education, love,
a good clean, safe home.

527
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:30,552
I've given you those things
and I'm through feeling guilty.

528
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,994
If you wanna piss your life away
and blame it on

529
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:35,294
how horrible things are at home,
go ahead.

530
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:38,824
I want it stated for the record
that I'm a good mother. Do you hear me?

531
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:41,167
I am a good mother.

532
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:45,235
[Rex] Bree...

533
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:50,374
Andrew just told me
he thinks he might be gay.

534
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,512
What?!

535
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:56,280
That's why he wanted me
to come in first.

536
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:59,289
He thought I could take it better.

537
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:08,121
Well, he was right.
I will be waiting in the car.

538
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:12,893
[Door closes]

539
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:17,067
[Knocking]

540
00:36:17,141 --> 00:36:20,008
Mrs. Solis. What are you doing here?

541
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:26,744
- OK.
- Are your roommates here?

542
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:28,341
No.

543
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:31,047
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

544
00:36:32,156 --> 00:36:34,590
- What's this?
- That? Uh...

545
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:38,060
Carlos just got a little rough.
Made me sign some papers.

546
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:40,120
He hurt you?

547
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,591
- What are you doing?
- I'll take care of this.

548
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:48,468
- Don't do anything.
- We can't let him get away with it.

549
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:51,508
Look, if you really wanna
get back at him, then kiss me.

550
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:53,567
- How's that gonna help?
- Because...

551
00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:55,737
one day when the time is right,

552
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:58,805
I'm gonna tell him
how he drove me right into your arms.

553
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,874
And that's gonna kill him.

554
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:09,490
And tonight, just... Whatever you do,
don't call me beautiful.

555
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:25,100
Oh, Morty, look who's here.

556
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:27,667
Hey, Millie. Hi, Morty.

557
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:30,236
Susie, what brings you here?

558
00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:32,942
Mom. I brought her over.

559
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:37,582
What's she doing out there?

560
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:40,556
She says she won't come in
until you apologize to her.

561
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:43,890
- For what?
- For shoving her.

562
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:47,727
I only shoved her
because she wouldn't stop hitting me.

563
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:49,789
Why was she hitting you?

564
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:52,062
I threw a... I threw a book at her.

565
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:54,297
- Morty!
- It was a paperback.

566
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:57,967
- Well, even so!
- At least I missed.

567
00:37:58,042 --> 00:38:00,977
I mean, she...
She hit me square in the gut.

568
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:04,446
- Wanna see the bruise?
- That's OK. That's OK.

569
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:09,310
- It really hurt.
- Yeah, I understand.

570
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:11,321
So...

571
00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:15,087
Could you, uh,
just go out and apologize?

572
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:16,820
- No.
- Why?

573
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:19,886
- 'Cause I don't want her back.
- Morty!

574
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:25,266
Look, I love her, but the Pancake Shack
is just starting to take off.

575
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:29,397
We're talking about opening another one.
That's practically a chain.

576
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:33,168
I don't have time for her hysterics.

577
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:35,610
I sympathize, I really do.

578
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,978
- But you have to take her back.
- Why?

579
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:40,449
Because she wants to move in with me.

580
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:42,878
Oh.

581
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:46,719
I'd like to have a relationship again,
and at my age, with a kid,

582
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:50,124
if she moves into my house,
even for a couple of years, I'm doomed.

583
00:38:50,194 --> 00:38:53,925
Wasn't there a plumber? Your mother
said you were in love with a plumber.

584
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,831
I am. I mean, I was.

585
00:38:56,901 --> 00:39:00,530
- It didn't work out.
- I'm sorry.

586
00:39:00,604 --> 00:39:04,438
If she moves in, she will burn up
all my oxygen and I need it.

587
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:08,042
Please, can't you give her
another chance?

588
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:10,672
You guys are really good together,
you know?

589
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:13,774
When you're... When, when,
when there's no violence.

590
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:16,217
Well, we do have chemistry.

591
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:17,618
Absolutely.

592
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:21,385
And, you know, the sex was like... Wow!

593
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:25,486
I mean, there was this one time,
we were coming home on the interstate...

594
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:28,760
You don't have to sell me.
Just go talk to her.

595
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:31,428
Now.

596
00:39:34,605 --> 00:39:36,436
OK.

597
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,910
[Sighs]

598
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:48,417
That was a mighty big sigh.

599
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:51,546
I just keep thinking it's coming,
and I can't stop it.

600
00:39:51,622 --> 00:39:52,748
What's that?

601
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:56,224
The day my mother will need
to move in and I won't have a choice.

602
00:39:56,293 --> 00:40:01,458
I know it's years away.
She's youthful and vibrant, thank God.

603
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:06,162
But time flies. One day she won't be
able to take care of herself anymore.

604
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:09,764
- And I'll have to step up.
- [Millie] I suppose that's true.

605
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:12,741
I think it's nature's little joke,

606
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:17,076
that children ultimately
end up parenting their parents.

607
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:19,548
Well, when that day comes,
I'll be ready.

608
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:21,983
Honey, you'd better get out there.

609
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:24,111
Stop it! Aaagh!

610
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:28,990
[Shouting]

611
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:30,754
[Susan] What are you doing?

612
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:34,264
Porter says he can't catch me!

613
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:46,102
[Boys continue shouting]

614
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:01,814
Hey.

615
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:08,594
Look, I just wanted to apologize...

616
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:10,361
Lynette, don't.

617
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:16,336
The fact that you just crossed
that street means the world to me.

618
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:19,103
And if anyone here should apologize,
it's me.

619
00:41:20,077 --> 00:41:21,237
Thank you.

620
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,609
[Boys shout]

621
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:29,745
Looks like Tom's
got the mob under control.

622
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:34,348
Wanna have some coffee,
sit around, bitch about our kids...?

623
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:37,851
- I would love to.
- OK.

624
00:41:44,401 --> 00:41:48,633
[Mary Alice] Children come into
the world with their own agendas.

625
00:41:48,706 --> 00:41:51,675
Some to brighten our days.

626
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:57,579
Some to test our patience.

627
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:04,142
Some to give us purpose.

628
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:11,951
Some to take care of us.

629
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,663
Yes, when they come,

630
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:22,535
children change everything.

631
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:33,984
Especially when they're not invited.
