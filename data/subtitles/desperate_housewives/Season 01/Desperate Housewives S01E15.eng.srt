2
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,969
Previously on Desperate Housewives...

3
00:00:03,036 --> 00:00:05,368
John, you're a toy.
You and me, no future.

4
00:00:05,438 --> 00:00:06,803
Once some things are said...

5
00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:09,637
Remember what it's like
to work a 60-hour week?

6
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:11,506
...you can't take them back.

7
00:00:11,644 --> 00:00:14,807
No one cares as much
about finding Deidre as I do.

8
00:00:15,915 --> 00:00:18,247
- You shot yourself?
- Pretty lame, huh?

9
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:20,478
- The damage is already done.
- Mom!

10
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,214
- You're not taking her away from me.
- Get out.

11
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:26,816
I needed you to see something.
They stole it from Mike's garage.

12
00:00:26,926 --> 00:00:28,416
Is that blood?

13
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:36,092
[Mary Alice] Bre Van De Kamp
believed in old-fashioned values.

14
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:38,796
Things like respect for God,

15
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:42,698
the importance of family,

16
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:46,009
and love of country.

17
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:51,450
In fact, Bre believed
so strongly in her values,

18
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:55,544
it was always a shock
whenever she was confronted

19
00:00:55,688 --> 00:00:57,986
with those who didn't.

20
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:03,790
- It's not mine.
- You promised the cheating had stopped.

21
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:07,628
Could we not yell at each other?
I'm feeling lousy today.

22
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:12,433
- I want you out of the house.
- Bree, look at me. It's not mine.

23
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:16,601
It didn't just magically appear
in my laundry basket.

24
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:20,442
I'm not the only guy in this house
that uses that hamper.

25
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:23,946
- No!
- Sorry.

26
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:28,010
- Andrew's still a child.
- He's 16. It's not unheard of.

27
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,454
- Honey, talk to him.
- And tell him what?

28
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:34,755
That we found his condom and
that he is forbidden from... You know.

29
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:38,730
I can tell him we think he's too young,
but it won't do any good.

30
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:42,962
We can search his room and if we find
any more, we'll confiscate them.

31
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:46,664
- That will accomplish what?
- If we take away his condoms...

32
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:51,574
He's a teenage boy. We could take away
his penis, he'd still try to have sex.

33
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:54,044
Well, we can't put it back in his room.

34
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,447
That would be like we're condoning
pre-marital sex.

35
00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:00,553
Bree, let me put this another way.

36
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,687
Do you want to become a grandmother?

37
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:14,424
Yes, Bre believed
in old-fashioned values.

38
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:18,869
But she also believed

39
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:23,841
it was better to be safe than sorry.

40
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,083
Each new morning
in suburbia brings with it

41
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,751
a new set of lies.

42
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:16,659
Little white lies, told not to hurt...

43
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:19,425
Morning, Mrs. Petchul,
you look lovely today.

44
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:23,026
...but to make life more pleasant.

45
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:26,771
They tell these lies
to protect themselves

46
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:28,932
and their reputations.

47
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:31,971
Oh, for God's sake,
this is unbelievable.

48
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:34,569
This is the last time
I do my banking online.

49
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:40,244
Of course, every now and then,

50
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:45,290
the day arrives when someone
finally decides to tell the truth.

51
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:48,155
He was shot?
How could you not tell us about this?

52
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:52,460
He was embarrassed.
He said it was an accident.

53
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:55,557
Oh, don't look at me like that.
Accidents happen.

54
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,567
We know you want to trust Mike,

55
00:03:57,637 --> 00:04:00,697
but he had a dead woman's
jewelry in his garage.

56
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:03,298
Now did he?
We don't know that for sure.

57
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,401
All we know is that Lynette's kids
turned up with it.

58
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,913
Are you saying
the twins murdered Martha?

59
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:11,746
Well, I wouldn't put it past them.

60
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:14,684
That is about
as likely as Mike having done it.

61
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:19,884
He's a good guy. I know him.
I mean, he's... he's Mike.

62
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:22,154
I don't think Mike did it either,

63
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:25,720
but if we don't call,
we're guilty of withholding evidence.

64
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:30,292
If he is innocent, this should be
a simple matter to clear up.

65
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:34,363
But... we will do
whatever you want us to do.

66
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,342
OK, call.

67
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:45,884
- Shall I just dial 911?
- It's not really an emergency.

68
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:48,419
- There was a murder.
- Well, not recently.

69
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:51,388
Will you just call?

70
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:56,019
[Buttons beeping, ringing tone]

71
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,153
[Knocking]

72
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:00,421
Hey.

73
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,601
My Mom will be home any minute.
She'll freak if she sees you.

74
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:09,437
Oh, I just wanted to deliver this
personally. I'm having a party.

75
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:12,306
You know she doesn't want us
to see each other.

76
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,675
Well, you gotta come. I...
you're the reason I'm doing this.

77
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:23,086
I'll try to talk to my Mom, OK?
But you really gotta go.

78
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:34,026
- Hey, Mrs. Solis.
- I'm sorry. Do I know you?

79
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,568
Yeah, I'm Justin, John's roommate.

80
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:38,729
I've been waiting forever for you.

81
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:41,933
- Really? Why?
- I want to do you a favor.

82
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,168
What kind of favor?

83
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:49,078
John says that you can't afford
a gardener right now,

84
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:52,743
and I told him I'd be happy to do it.
For free.

85
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:55,788
You want to mow my lawn for free?

86
00:05:55,888 --> 00:06:00,188
Mow your lawn.
Water your flowers. Trim your bushes.

87
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:04,289
I could do everything
John did for you.

88
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:07,822
That's very generous of you,
but I don't think so.

89
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,197
Why?

90
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:12,498
Because my husband is home
quite a lot these days.

91
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:16,336
If any bush needs trimming,
he takes care of it.

92
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:21,106
This is a beautiful yard. I'm sure
it could use a little extra attention.

93
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,946
[Scoffs] I'm flattered,
but no, thank you.

94
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:28,446
Mrs. Solis, please.

95
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:34,148
Did I mention why my husband's
home a lot? He's under house arrest.

96
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,284
Oh?

97
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:38,524
He has a lot of anger
toward the government right now,

98
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:42,864
and he's just dying to find
someone to take it out on.

99
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:48,866
[Justin sighs]

100
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:52,975
[Boys all shouting]

101
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:57,106
Hey, guys. This isn't a hockey rink.
Can you take it outside?

102
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:59,276
Hi, honey. How was your day?

103
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:04,548
I didn't get the V.P. Gig.

104
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:08,184
Oh, Tom, I am so sorry.

105
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:11,525
It doesn't make sense to me.
I'm Peterson's "go-to guy".

106
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:14,964
How does Tim Duggan,
the biggest blowhard in the office,

107
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:17,400
get promoted to vice president over me?

108
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,063
I thought you liked Tim Duggan?

109
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:24,041
I do. I just... I don't know,
I just, I really wanted that promotion.

110
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,975
[Boys shouting]

111
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:29,640
Hey, boys,
take the Stanley Cup finals outside.

112
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:31,239
Whack!

113
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,581
Did you tell Mr. Peterson
that you wanted the job?

114
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,882
I have worked there for 8 1/2 years.

115
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:39,480
Duggan's been there two.
I am not gonna beg.

116
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:43,290
I'm not saying to beg. You just
have to step up from time to time.

117
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:48,265
See your opportunity and take it.
Nobody respects a shrinking violet.

118
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:53,566
There is more than one leadership style.
Mine is quiet but... effective.

119
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:56,506
Take that racket outside!

120
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:01,772
Whatever works for you.

121
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:07,210
Susan!

122
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:11,279
Hey, sexy. Where you been?
I called you twice. You avoiding me?

123
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:16,453
Why would I do that? No,
I've been really busy grocery shopping.

124
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:19,430
For two days?
You must be pretty well stocked.

125
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:28,003
- How about dinner tonight?
- Uh...

126
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:30,702
Dinner... tonight? Um...

127
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:32,300
You OK?

128
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,214
Can you hold these a sec?

129
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:43,277
Up against the car!

130
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,786
You have the right to remain silent.

131
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:51,762
Anything you do say can be used
against you in a court of law.

132
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:55,892
You have the right
to consult an attorney...

133
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:05,668
So get this: Zach Young's throwing
a pool party Saturday night.

134
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:08,042
He sent out formal invitations.

135
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:11,743
I'm surprised he didn't spritz them
with aftershave.

136
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:16,116
- What is wrong with nice invitations?
- Mom, it's a pool party.

137
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,383
He could've just passed out flyers.

138
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:21,483
He's genetically incapable
of being cool.

139
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,995
So, uh... are you going?

140
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:28,658
Uh... maybe. I mean, um,
Lisa and Justin and some of the guys

141
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,998
thought it'd be fun to swim.

142
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,766
We can always bail if it's lame.

143
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:37,069
Oh, is, um, Lisa your friend
with the pierced navel?

144
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:38,608
Yeah.

145
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:41,908
You've been spending a lot of time
together lately.

146
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:43,845
I guess.

147
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:50,153
Oh, uh, Andrew, I'm gonna
want you home by 11 on Saturday.

148
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,453
11? Mom, it's not even a school night!

149
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:56,518
Bree, a curfew isn't gonna do any good.

150
00:09:57,396 --> 00:10:01,059
You may be able to abdicate
all your parental responsibility,

151
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:03,692
but I cannot.

152
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:07,500
What... what's going on here?

153
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:12,540
Is this to do
with the condom you left in my room?

154
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:15,842
As a matter of fact, it is.
And just so we're clear,

155
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:18,679
if you get Lisa pregnant,
you will marry her.

156
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:19,842
Ha!

157
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:23,246
Andrew, this is not funny.

158
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:26,154
Mom, trust me.
This is very funny.

159
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:29,592
Mostly because
the condom wasn't mine.

160
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:42,131
You suck, you know that?

161
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:53,476
So obviously we need to talk.

162
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:57,817
I'm still a virgin,
if you want to know.

163
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:01,451
Well, good. But why on earth
would you need a condom?

164
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,223
I'm planning on having sex
and don't want to get pregnant.

165
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,822
You are president
of the Abstinence Club.

166
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,664
I wasn't planning on
running for a second term.

167
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,295
Who were you
planning on having sex with?

168
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:16,341
- John.
- I thought you broke up with him.

169
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:19,468
No. He broke up with me
because I wouldn't do it.

170
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:21,876
If that's the type he is,
good riddance.

171
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:24,780
Mom, every boy
at my school is that type.

172
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:28,843
And besides, it's different with John.

173
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:30,513
I love him.

174
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:36,189
Sweetheart, just because
you give a boy sex

175
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:39,527
doesn't mean you'll get love in return.

176
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:43,466
So maybe I'm being stupid.
What's the big deal? It's just sex.

177
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,268
I am looking out for your happiness.

178
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:51,002
I understand what it's like
to be young and feel urges.

179
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,409
But I waited until I got married.
As did your father.

180
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,914
And it was so much better.

181
00:11:56,982 --> 00:12:00,281
But Daddy ended up cheating on you.

182
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,047
Yes. Well...

183
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:04,386
Now he's moved back,
you're miserable.

184
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:07,459
- Why would you say that?
- The walls are paper thin.

185
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:10,393
I hear more stuff
than I probably should.

186
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:13,626
- Oh, uh...
- Look, Mom, I love you a lot,

187
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:19,194
but you're the last person to give
anyone advice about sex and happiness.

188
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:28,705
You seen these?
Five more Past Due notices.

189
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:31,442
- I'm handling it.
- How are you handling it?

190
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,347
Can I finish my sandwich?

191
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:35,818
Have you seen our account?
We're broke.

192
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:38,789
We have the mortgage payment
coming up...

193
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,324
Gaby, it's gonna be OK.

194
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,418
No, it's not.
We are screwed.

195
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:46,362
I am freaking out
that you're not freaking out.

196
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:48,524
- Things will turn around.
- When?

197
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:53,503
I don't know when. But we're
lucky people. And we'll be lucky again.

198
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,871
- What is that?
- It's the lawn mower.

199
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,879
We got a new gardener today.

200
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:05,041
It won't cost us a cent.
The kid's a friend of John's.

201
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:09,349
- Carlos...
- He said he'd do the lawn for free.

202
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:15,125
Can you believe it?
We are lucky people.

203
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:21,358
[Crowd cheers]

204
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,230
- Hey, Duggan. You're up, baby.
- You got it.

205
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,570
- Yeah, Duggan.
- Let's go, man.

206
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:32,473
Hey, guys,
good to see you again. [laughs]

207
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:34,636
- Hey.
- Hey.

208
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:38,141
Don't look so glum.
You'll get a hit.

209
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,981
Oh, it's not that.
This is my "hating Tim Duggan" look.

210
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:45,318
Oh, Duggan connects.

211
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:46,857
There!

212
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:50,956
Look at that job-stealing bastard run.

213
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:54,032
Duggan is showing
some of that glory-hounding,

214
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:57,000
ass-kissing hustle
that he is so well-known for.

215
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:59,935
I forgot how much fun you are
when you're bitter.

216
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:04,476
He's stretching for extra bases.
Like he stretched for extra territory,

217
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:08,138
screwing over unsung utility player,
Tom Scavo.

218
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:13,583
Oh! Down goes Duggan.
Duggan goes down. That's gotta hurt.

219
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:15,677
The glory-hound is tagged out,

220
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:18,688
and he's gonna have to deal
with tough dirt stains.

221
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:19,815
Tom...

222
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:25,086
No, I'm sure he's just grandstanding.

223
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:30,668
Oh, my God!

224
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,828
Holy crap!

225
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:40,171
- It's only a pool party.
- I said no.

226
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:43,612
Are you gonna keep a boy-free zone
around me until I'm 18?

227
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:47,152
You can see boys,
in a couple years, just not that boy.

228
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,312
[Sighs] Why do you hate Zach?

229
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:52,948
I don't hate Zach.
I just think he's sort of crazy.

230
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:55,186
People call you "sort of crazy".

231
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:58,422
I'm adorable crazy.
And he's rampage crazy.

232
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:00,158
[Knocking]

233
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:04,165
- Susan Mayer?
- Yeah?

234
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:08,536
I'm Detective Copeland, investigating
the murder of Martha Huber.

235
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:10,973
I need to talk to you
about Mike Delfino.

236
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:14,410
Do you remember seeing Mr. Delfino
on the 7th of last month?

237
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:16,845
Is the 7th important?

238
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,643
We believe it was the night
that Martha Huber was murdered.

239
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:23,085
She was seen
at the grocery store at nine.

240
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:26,749
She didn't show for
a dentist appointment the next morning.

241
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:28,884
- What day was that?
- It was a Sunday.

242
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:31,521
Oh! Oh, my God! Yes!

243
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,892
Yes! Yes!

244
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:35,057
Yes, I... I was with Mike that night.

245
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,600
- You're sure?
- Yes.

246
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:41,868
It was a big night, relationship-wise.
It was the first time that we...

247
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:45,900
- The first time you...?
- Did it. The first time they did it.

248
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:47,569
- Julie!
- It was.

249
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:49,944
- How did you know?
- I'm not clueless.

250
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:54,782
- Men's boxers in the clothes hamper.
- Don't write that down.

251
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:57,048
This is good.
You can let Mike go.

252
00:15:57,156 --> 00:16:00,592
Assuming everything you're telling me
is true.

253
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:01,819
It's true.

254
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:06,194
The next morning she made pancakes
in the shape of little hearts.

255
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,699
Seriously, little hearts.

256
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:17,641
[Gasps] Oh, God!

257
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:20,211
Justin. What are you doing up here?

258
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:25,581
Uh... I finished the hedges. Is there
anything else Mr. Solis wants done?

259
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:28,676
He's not here.
He had a meeting with his lawyer.

260
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:31,154
So that means we're all alone.

261
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:33,691
No. I'm all alone. You're leaving.

262
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,818
I'm not in a hurry.

263
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:39,455
- We could hang out for a while.
- [Scoffs] I don't think so.

264
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:43,661
Come on. If you just got to know me,
you'd see I can be lots of fun.

265
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:46,101
All my friends say so.

266
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:49,732
I'm not one of your friends.
Get out of my bedroom.

267
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,934
Come on, Mrs. Solis. Be nice.

268
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:54,905
[Gasps]

269
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,381
You shouldn't have done that.

270
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:01,680
Do you know how easy it would be

271
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:04,585
for me to tell my husband
what you tried to do?

272
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:09,025
Not as easy as it'd be for me
to tell him about you and John.

273
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:12,291
I... I'm sorry, Mrs. Solis,

274
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:15,333
but you're gonna
have to be nice to me,

275
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:18,130
at least once.

276
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:34,011
Mike!

277
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,314
Mike! Are you OK?

278
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:40,620
Uh... yeah. Yeah.
I'm a little bit embarrassed.

279
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:44,788
- Must be the talk of the neighborhood.
- No. Not really. No.

280
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:47,730
So guess what? I'm your alibi.

281
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:52,635
I told the police we were together
the night Mrs. Huber was killed

282
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:56,299
and that
I could never forget that night.

283
00:17:56,375 --> 00:18:00,744
- You don't think I killed Mrs. Huber?
- No! No, of course not.

284
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:06,011
I could never think you killed anybody,
even if I wasn't your alibi. Which I am.

285
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:12,012
OK. I'm, um, I'm gonna go
take a shower. Jail's kinda gross.

286
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:15,491
- I'll call you later. OK?
- Sure. When?

287
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:21,993
Later. I just got some stuff
I gotta take care of. OK?

288
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:25,898
OK.

289
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,033
- Mrs. Van De Kamp.
- Hello, John.

290
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:33,509
I'm sorry to drop by unannounced.
Do you have a moment?

291
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:34,705
Sure.

292
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:40,418
So... what can I do for you?

293
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:44,217
Well, my daughter is
planning on giving you her virginity

294
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:47,816
and I would consider it a favor
if you wouldn't take it.

295
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:57,061
- Hey.
- Hey! So what's the word on Tim?

296
00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:00,536
He came through the triple bypass
with flying colors.

297
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,732
Thank God.

298
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:04,639
It's not all coming up roses.

299
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:08,941
He's not gonna be able to come back
to work for four-and-a-half months.

300
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:10,072
Oh.

301
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:13,608
What?

302
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:15,744
Company still needs to expand,

303
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:20,757
so they need a fit, heart-smart guy
like me to step up, take the ball.

304
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:23,521
- You're going after his promotion?
- No.

305
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:26,029
I already got it.
You should have seen me.

306
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:28,656
I walked straight into Peterson's office

307
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:32,134
and told him he would be a fool
to hold Duggan's promotion.

308
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:35,434
- You called your boss a fool?
- I did.

309
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:39,238
That was risky in retrospect.
But still he gave me the job.

310
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:42,040
- Oh, my God. That's great.
- Honey, it's me.

311
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:46,107
- I got the whole west coast.
- Oh, my... What? What?

312
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,586
I thought you were going after
an in-house position.

313
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:53,523
No. I'm setting up new offices
from Seattle to LA. I told you that.

314
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:54,956
No.

315
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:58,756
No, you didn't.

316
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:03,163
OK. Well, so it's gonna be
a little bit more travel, but...

317
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:06,260
Tom, you're barely here
half the time as it is.

318
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:09,330
Now you're gonna have,
what, twice the workload?

319
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:11,638
Honey, please don't ruin this.

320
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,837
You should have consulted with me.

321
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:17,006
I did! You told me
to stop being a shrinking violet.

322
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:20,744
I thought
this was an in-house position.

323
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,214
OK, I'm gonna go shower.

324
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:26,314
Look, wait. Wait.
I know what this means to you.

325
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:29,588
No, you don't.
No, you don't. I am 41 years old.

326
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:33,495
If I don't make vice president now,
it's never gonna happen.

327
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,295
This is my career.
It's important to me.

328
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:40,371
So was mine. But I'm here, aren't I?

329
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,702
I'm gonna take the job.

330
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:56,520
She said you broke up with her
because she refused to have sex.

331
00:20:56,588 --> 00:21:00,718
Wow! Um... OK, here's the deal.

332
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:03,920
I said that.
But it was just an excuse.

333
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:07,454
I mean, the truth is,
I wasn't that into her.

334
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:09,591
Really?

335
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:12,398
She was always so proud
of never having done it,

336
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:15,530
I figured, "Hey, this is my way out."

337
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:18,542
Well, she feels
very passionately about you.

338
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:25,072
Don't get me wrong. She's nice.
But the truth is, there's someone else.

339
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:28,847
Oh, are you going steady?

340
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:33,550
Not exactly. We were seeing
each other pretty regularly,

341
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:37,891
but this other lady... girl,
she sort of dumped me.

342
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:41,124
Oh, I see.

343
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:47,699
Look, I'll talk to Danielle and
don't worry, I'll let her down gently.

344
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:50,571
Um, actually,
I would prefer if you didn't.

345
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:52,007
Huh?

346
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,044
I know my daughter.
She's very determined.

347
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:02,109
Unless you're really firm with her,
she'll think there's hope.

348
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,347
OK. I'll be firm.

349
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,285
Better still,

350
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:09,350
be brutal.

351
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:28,336
- Decided to indulge your sweet tooth?
- I'll be dead inside a year.

352
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:32,076
I've got bigger things to worry about
than my waistline.

353
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:34,618
So, who's the woman
they think you killed?

354
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,248
Martha Huber. Local busybody.
I thought her murder was random.

355
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:43,350
Nothing random about her jewelry
ending up in your garage.

356
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:45,293
Did you kill her?

357
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:50,028
No. Whoever set me up did a good job.
The cops are all over me.

358
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:53,936
- You're getting close to something.
- If I am close, I don't see it.

359
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:59,271
People leave trails. One of those trails
will lead to Deidre.

360
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:01,437
Whoever set you up must know that.

361
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:05,210
Maybe, but I won't
be much good to you locked up.

362
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:09,379
I'm rich, Mike. One of the best things
about being rich

363
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:13,447
is the security of knowing you can
buy your way out of any problem.

364
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:22,126
I'm not taking my money to the grave.
I'm gonna use it to save your ass.

365
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,669
- Mrs. Solis?
- Hello, Justin.

366
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,870
- What are you doing here?
- I am here to talk to your roommate.

367
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:36,710
John? I didn't think
you guys talked any more.

368
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:40,080
Well, now we have something
to talk about. You.

369
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:41,652
- Me?
- Yes.

370
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,087
How you're trying to blackmail me
into sleeping with you.

371
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,658
- I wonder how he'll react.
- Mrs. Solis...

372
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,284
You think he'll get violent?

373
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:55,198
- You can't talk to John about that.
- Oh, I can.

374
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,667
And I will, you little worthless
piece of crap.

375
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:03,333
Listen, Mrs. Solis, I'm sorry.

376
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:07,767
- I didn't want to blackmail you.
- Then why did you?

377
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:10,575
I really needed to sleep with you.

378
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:12,479
- Why?
- Because...

379
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:19,316
I think I might be gay.

380
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:21,752
Oh.

381
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:23,818
[Boys] Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

382
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:25,954
Hey! How about that?

383
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:32,327
- [Tom] What's up?
- The boys knew you wouldn't be home

384
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:38,569
till after, um, bedtime, and so we
decided to pop in and visit the new V.P.

385
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:41,976
Check it out. I finally
got an office with a window. Huh?

386
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,310
Yeah. It's all about the window.

387
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:49,276
Hey, guys. Hey, who wants chair rides?

388
00:24:49,354 --> 00:24:53,017
- [Boys] Me! Me! Me!
- Out this way. Here we go.

389
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:55,821
- Whoo-hoo!
- Here we go, guys. Ready?

390
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,297
[Tom] Hold on.

391
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:03,560
Checking out
the new executive digs?

392
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:06,466
Oh, you know it.

393
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:14,038
- Can I tell you a little secret?
- Sure.

394
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:17,672
Dan wanted to hold
the promotion over for Tim Duggan.

395
00:25:17,782 --> 00:25:21,548
And I'm the one that convinced him
to give it to Tom.

396
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,918
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

397
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:28,923
Tom is such a workhorse
and he wanted it so badly.

398
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:32,486
Yeah, he certainly did.

399
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:37,459
What is wrong?
Aren't you happy about this promotion?

400
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:42,906
[Mary Alice] Lynette realized
it was best to lie to the boss's wife...

401
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:45,534
Well, it's great.

402
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:48,272
Obviously. Thank you.

403
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,372
...provided she wasn't too convincing.

404
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:54,179
Of course, I mean,

405
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:59,314
I will... miss him
being gone all the time.

406
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:03,794
He'll be bringing in more money,
but he is gonna miss the birthdays,

407
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:10,664
baseball games, first steps.
But that's the trade-off. Right?

408
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:16,765
I just hope one day Tom doesn't
look back and regret being gone so much.

409
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:22,444
Oh, I better get out there
before they break something.

410
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:25,038
- Of course. I will see you soon.
- OK.

411
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:35,924
So, have you been
acting on these feelings?

412
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:44,163
I got a buddy. We get together.
Mess around. But it's no big deal.

413
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:48,171
It's just lately, I've been
starting to care about him and...

414
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:50,503
and I don't know how to handle it.

415
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:51,769
Wow.

416
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:54,573
And I thought
if I sleep with somebody like you,

417
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:59,275
I'll know for sure and
I can stop freaking out about this.

418
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:04,083
But why me? You're a good-Iooking kid.
Why not test drive someone your own age?

419
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:10,856
Girls talk. If I start something with
somebody and it doesn't... work out,

420
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:12,987
everyone at school will find out.

421
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:17,330
And I figured I can trust you,
'cause you have a husband and all.

422
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:22,635
Well, I guess that makes sense
in a weird sort of way.

423
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:29,937
You know, my buddy and I have been
messing around for quite a while,

424
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:32,983
and this whole time
I kept telling myself

425
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:36,747
that it didn't really mean anything,
you know?

426
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:41,959
Guess I've been kidding myself, huh?

427
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,255
We're all in denial
about something.

428
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:52,898
But you're finally facing the truth,
and I think that's sort of brave.

429
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:56,701
- Thanks.
- I should probably go.

430
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:05,146
Uh... just so you know, I never would
have told Mr. Solis about you and John.

431
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:09,448
I may be gay but I'm not a jerk.

432
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,463
Did you feel anything?

433
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:31,739
Not really.

434
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:35,137
You're definitely gay.

435
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:40,242
[Knocking]

436
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:49,960
- Hi.
- Hi. I'm sorry to bother you at night,

437
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:55,397
but I was hoping that you could come
to the station to answer more questions.

438
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:00,369
Now? Well, I'm sorry, my daughter
and I were gonna go see a movie tonight.

439
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:04,875
Mom? We can do it another night.
I'll be fine.

440
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:08,835
- Uh, let me get my purse.
- Great.

441
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,107
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

442
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:12,513
I won't be late.

443
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,677
- Bye.
- Bye.

444
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:33,461
You said that Mike came to your house
around 10pm on the night of the seventh.

445
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:36,302
Um, am I supposed to
talk into the camera or...

446
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:38,375
No. Just talk to me.

447
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:43,608
OK. Uh, yes.
He came over around ten o'clock.

448
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:47,811
Do you know of any tension,
uh, between Mike and Martha Huber?

449
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:49,410
No.

450
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:53,014
Were you aware
Mike was shot recently?

451
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:55,559
Yes, on Valentine's Day.

452
00:29:55,627 --> 00:30:00,257
- Do you know how that came about?
- He dropped his gun, cleaning it.

453
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:03,061
Ms Mayer,
I've been around guns for years.

454
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:06,661
I've never seen one discharge
when it hits the ground.

455
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:10,673
- Someone has to pull the trigger.
- I wouldn't know about that.

456
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:14,576
Were you aware there was
a home invasion on Pine Avenue

457
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,739
- the day before Valentine's?
- No.

458
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:20,342
The intruder was shot in the stomach.
Where was Mike's wound?

459
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:25,989
The stomach.

460
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:33,690
Do you love him?

461
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:35,824
What?

462
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:39,159
What does that have to do with...?

463
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:42,536
Sometimes people do stupid things
when they're in love.

464
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,906
I should know.
I've been married four times.

465
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:50,607
Tell me the truth.
He wasn't with you that night.

466
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:53,615
- He asked you to lie for him.
- No, he didn't.

467
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:57,678
He was with me. And Mike
wouldn't kill anybody. I'm sure of that.

468
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:13,827
Mike Delfino: Convicted 1987.

469
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:17,739
Did five-and-a-half years
for drug trafficking and manslaughter.

470
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:32,345
You want a coffe?
I'm gonna go for a coffe.

471
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:49,038
[Copeland] Is she covering for her guy?

472
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:52,602
No. She's just a sucker.

473
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:03,750
[# Rock music]

474
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:07,916
I guess no one's in the pool yet.
Are you gonna swim?

475
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:12,395
Please, I just spent an hour
blowing out my hair.

476
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:14,522
Good luck, man.

477
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,328
I'II... I'll see you later. OK?

478
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:20,495
OK.

479
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,464
Hey.

480
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:30,338
Hey, I got a surprise for you.
You wanna go somewhere and talk?

481
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:33,578
Yeah. We should talk.

482
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:37,519
- Hi. You made it.
- Andrew's here. Didn't think he'd come.

483
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:42,457
Yeah, he brought his friends. They're
acting like jerks. Alert the media.

484
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:46,257
I don't care. You're here now.
This is gonna be great.

485
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,358
[Boy] Come on, man. Let's go.

486
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:54,797
- Danielle!
- Don't touch me!

487
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:57,306
[Boy] Hope you can swim.

488
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:03,143
- Could you take it easy?
- It's cool.

489
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:05,307
Look, he floats.

490
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:09,716
All right? Relax. It's a party.
You're the main party animal, right?

491
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,415
Am I right?

492
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:13,615
I guess.

493
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:16,990
All right! Well, then act like it.
Come on, give me a howl.

494
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:22,930
Come on. You're the host.
Revel in it. Gimme a howl.

495
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:25,127
[Howls]

496
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:31,669
- [Weak howl]
- [Laughter]

497
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:37,205
There you go.

498
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:43,749
- You OK?
- What do I care? He's nothing.

499
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:46,346
I could take care of him if I wanted to.

500
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:48,790
How do you mean?

501
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,795
I know where my mom kept her gun.

502
00:33:57,468 --> 00:33:58,560
[Popping noise]

503
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:06,936
- That's not funny, Zach.
- If you think about it, yeah, it is.

504
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:14,217
Julie!

505
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:18,452
[Sobbing]

506
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:21,855
Hey! Danielle, are you OK?

507
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:25,520
I just want to go home. Can we go?

508
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:27,721
Sure.

509
00:34:31,035 --> 00:34:33,094
Julie!

510
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:36,298
I'm taking Danielle home.

511
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:39,501
- Are you coming back?
- I don't think so.

512
00:34:59,163 --> 00:35:01,097
[Lynette sighs]

513
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:05,863
- [Lynette] Oh.
- So, how was the P.T.A. Meeting?

514
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,996
Long.

515
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:15,370
So, Peterson called me
into his office today.

516
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,640
Really?

517
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:19,079
Yeah. He, uh, he changed his mind.

518
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:22,608
He's gonna hold that promotion
for Duggan.

519
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:25,781
- Oh...
- Yeah. It's, it's fine.

520
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:29,452
I'm glad, really.
I didn't want to work those long hours.

521
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:34,463
And you know how I hate flying.
It does horrible things to my back.

522
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:38,661
With all that extra stress,
I would have ended up like Tim Duggan

523
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:41,169
ten years from now. So...

524
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:46,336
Yeah. Of course.

525
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:49,504
So it's... it's over.

526
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,972
You'll make V.P. One of these days.

527
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:55,746
It's OK. Honest.

528
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,756
I am, uh... really glad
that it worked out this way.

529
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:12,293
OK.

530
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:26,242
Oh, God. You scared me.

531
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,443
How'd it go?

532
00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:31,212
It went just peachy.

533
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,090
And humiliating and shocking.

534
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:37,953
- Susan...
- How could you?

535
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:42,096
God, "Susan, do you trust me?"
"Of course I do".

536
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:45,135
Oh, I'm such an idiot!
And you're such a liar.

537
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:47,965
Oh, and apparently a killer
and a drug dealer.

538
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,599
That's quite a personal ad
you've got going!

539
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:53,142
- I came to Wisteria Lane...
- Stop, Mike!

540
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:55,337
Just stop!

541
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,807
If you keep talking,

542
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:02,909
you're gonna work your way
into my heart,

543
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:08,721
and I just don't want you
anywhere near my heart.

544
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:10,488
Ever.

545
00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:17,024
[Sniffling, sobs]

546
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:18,660
Julie?

547
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:23,632
Mommy needs a hug.

548
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,134
Julie?

549
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:48,659
Is Julie in there? Julie Mayer?

550
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:51,599
I don't know.
It's pretty dead in there.

551
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:01,241
Julie Alexandra Mayer!

552
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:08,350
Oh, Julie! Zach, this is ridiculous.
You can't hold your breath for ever!

553
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:17,820
You might as well stay under there
and never come up for air,

554
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:21,956
'cause when you do, I'm gonna choke
the living daylights out of you!

555
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:24,126
Oh... um...

556
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,795
Is my daughter under there?

557
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:36,070
Oh...

558
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:42,351
- I'm not... I'm not gay!
- Oh... I... OK. I... I'm sorry.

559
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:47,380
Uh, I'll just...
I'm just gonna leave those right there.

560
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:49,118
Oh!

561
00:38:49,226 --> 00:38:51,820
I'm fine. It's good.
You just, you know...

562
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:52,920
Whoo!

563
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:57,830
Did you see...?
No! Goodbye.

564
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:05,501
Sell the house?
Are you crazy?

565
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:07,668
We can't afford to live here.

566
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:11,476
If the Justice Department
unfreezes the bank accounts...

567
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:13,608
Then what? Huh?

568
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:18,451
We have tons of legal bills. And even
with our savings, we're screwed.

569
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:20,581
But...

570
00:39:22,993 --> 00:39:28,329
- It's our house.
- I love this place too. It's just...

571
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:30,959
It's time for us to face the music.

572
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:45,814
[Sighs]

573
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:56,821
I never thought I'd be poor
at this stage of my life.

574
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:03,560
You know, Carlos, I've been broke
a lot of times in my life.

575
00:40:03,634 --> 00:40:07,900
But I've never been poor.
Because poor is just a state of mind.

576
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:12,003
And right now, you and I are just...

577
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:15,101
Without funds?

578
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:16,544
Exactly.

579
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:24,953
[Sighs] I guess we could
get an apartment, start over.

580
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:29,717
Who knows? It might even be fun.

581
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:38,828
And once we're back on our feet,
we'll get a house as big as this one.

582
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,761
Bigger.

583
00:40:56,787 --> 00:41:01,724
[Man] I get my wife this dog
for her birthday. Stray from the pound.

584
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:03,953
She loves it. So I'm a genius.

585
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:07,293
Then I find out it's got
this weird blood disease.

586
00:41:07,364 --> 00:41:12,301
Now I'm laying out $600 a month
for doggie medicine. Am I a genius?

587
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:16,669
Don't be cynical. You did something
nice. You made your wife happy.

588
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:21,677
Now, let's talk
about what's gonna make you happy.

589
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:31,681
[Mary Alice]
Yes, each new day in suburbia

590
00:41:31,755 --> 00:41:35,088
brings with it a new set of lies.

591
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:40,687
The worst are the ones we tell ourselves
before we fall aslep.

592
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:45,895
We whisper them in the dark,
telling ourselves we're happy.

593
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:51,041
Or, that he's happy.

594
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:56,838
That we can change.

595
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:02,848
Or that he will change his mind.

596
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:11,686
We persuade ourselves
we can live with our sins...

597
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:24,268
...or that we can live without him.

598
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:32,045
Yes, each night before we fall aslep
we lie to ourselves,

599
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:37,418
in the desperate, desperate hope,
that come morning,

600
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:39,716
it will all be true.
