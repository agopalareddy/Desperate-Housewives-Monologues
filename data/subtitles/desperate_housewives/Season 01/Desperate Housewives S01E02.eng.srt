2
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:03,969
Previously on Desperate Housewives...

3
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:08,738
If Mary Alice was having a crisis,
we'd have known.

4
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:10,901
She lives 50 feet away, for God's sakes.

5
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:15,209
Gabby, the woman killed herself.
Something must've been going on.

6
00:00:15,281 --> 00:00:18,648
Every time I'm around that man,
he tries to grab my ass.

7
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:21,778
I made over 200,000
doing business with him last year.

8
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,880
If he wants to grab your ass, let him.

9
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:26,522
Why aren't you happy?

10
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:30,529
It turns out I wanted
all the wrong things.

11
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:34,262
- What's that?
- A letter addressed to Mary Alice.

12
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:41,439
Oh, Mary Alice, what did you do?

13
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:49,743
[Mary Alice] An odd thing happens
when we die.

14
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,510
Our senses vanish.

15
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:55,247
Taste, touch, smell and sound
become a distant memory.

16
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:59,883
But our sight? Ah, our sight expands.

17
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:03,690
And we can suddenly se the world
we've left behind so clearly.

18
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:09,167
Of course, most of what's visible to the
dead could also be sen by the living.

19
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:12,238
If they'd only take the time to look.

20
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:14,330
Like my friend Gabrielle.

21
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:17,774
I should've sen how unhappy
she was, but I didn't.

22
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:21,745
I only saw her clothes from Paris...

23
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:25,078
...her platinum jewelry...

24
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:29,053
...and her brand-new diamond watch.

25
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:33,683
Had I looked closer, I'd have sen
that Gabrielle was a drowning woman

26
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,228
desperately in search of a life raft.

27
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:39,854
Luckily for her, she found one.

28
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:42,901
Of course, Gabrielle
only saw her young gardener

29
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:47,133
as a way to infuse her life
with a little excitement.

30
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:54,037
But now she was about to discover
just how exciting her life could get.

31
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:07,883
- Damn it. Come on.
- Whoa!

32
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,519
Come on, hurry!

33
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:12,229
Let's go, let's go.

34
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,994
- Where's my clothes?
- I'll find them. Get out.

35
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:18,331
Where?

36
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:20,497
- Out the window.
- What?

37
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,069
- Go! Go!
- Aggh! Uh!

38
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:34,050
- Hi, honey, you're home early.
- My meeting got cancelled.

39
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:41,553
- Didn't you shower this morning?
- I, uh, just finished a workout.

40
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,822
Mm. Where's John?

41
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:47,899
- John?
- Yeah. That's his truck out front.

44
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,566
she would fel
the full force of his wrath.

45
00:02:56,643 --> 00:03:00,511
- Hey, Mr. Solis.
- Hey, John.

46
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,879
- Did you take care of the ficus?
- I'll do it as soon as I'm done.

47
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,144
All right.

48
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,353
She was quickly reminded

49
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:15,019
- that what Carlos couldn't se...
- Yeah. Sure, no problem.

50
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:17,426
...couldn't hurt her.

51
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:09,946
The peaceful facade of Wisteria Lane
had recently ben shattered.

52
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:13,611
First, by my suicide.

53
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,952
And then by the discovery
of a note among my belongings

54
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:21,391
that suggested a suspicious reason
for my desperate act.

55
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:25,463
My friends gathered
to discuss its implications.

56
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:27,123
We should give it to Paul.

57
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,363
He's still mourning, Susan.
He'll probably freak out.

58
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,667
She was his wife.
He deserves to have all the facts.

59
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:38,336
We could do it gently. We could tell him
about it over coffee and pastry.

60
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:42,437
That'll be fun. "We have proof your wife
killed herself over a dark secret."

61
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:45,882
- "Another bear claw?"
- We could always call the police.

62
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:48,419
Maybe it's just some sort of sick joke.

63
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:50,715
If it was, it was in very poor taste.

64
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:53,792
No, this was serious. I know it was.

65
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,760
We got to find out what was going on.

66
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:58,693
There's a chance
we're not gonna like what we find.

67
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,993
Isn't it worse to be in the dark,

68
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:03,695
imagining she did
all these horrible things?

69
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:08,605
It's the age-old question. How much do
we want to know about our neighbors?

70
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,115
My friends were right to be concerned.

71
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:25,048
They knew that every family
has its secrets.

72
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:26,318
[Owl hoots]

73
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:29,384
And as my son and husband
could've told them,

74
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:33,261
you ned to think carefully
before digging them up.

75
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,963
[Owl hoots]

76
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,711
After talking for hours,

77
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:56,118
my friends still hadn't agred
on what to do with the note.

78
00:05:56,856 --> 00:06:01,987
So they decided to talk about it in
the morning after a good night's rest.

79
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:07,026
But no one could fall aslep that night.

80
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:11,226
They each kept thinking of my suicide.

81
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:15,468
And how terribly alone I must've felt.

82
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:20,512
You se, loneliness was something
my friends understood.

83
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:22,307
All too well.

84
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:30,649
- [Coughs]
- It's OK, I'm up.

85
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:33,954
Good. I have a question for you.

86
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:38,355
OK.

87
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:41,126
[Sighs]

88
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,759
- Remember when you proposed?
- For God's sake.

89
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:47,135
We sat on Skyline Drive
and drank a bottle of apple wine

90
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:49,766
and you turned to me and you said,

91
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:52,310
"If you marry me, Bree Mason,

92
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,937
I promise to love you
for the rest of my life."

93
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:59,477
Even though I was engaged to Ty Grant,
and my father didn't like you,

94
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:02,419
- I said yes.
- That was a long time ago.

95
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:05,116
Cancel the meeting
with the divorce lawyer.

96
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,125
We'll find a marriage counselor.

97
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:10,559
- Bree...
- You promised.

98
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:21,202
All right.

99
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:24,401
Good. I'm going to make myself
some warm milk.

100
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:32,778
- Would you like something to drink?
- Anything but apple wine.

101
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:41,123
Susan awoke that night
alone and parched.

102
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:42,956
But as she gazed out her window,

103
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:48,695
she saw the tall drink of water
she neded to quench her thirst.

104
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,065
"Dear Diary,
Mike doesn't know I'm alive."

105
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:54,937
- Shut up.
- You're gonna have to ask him out.

106
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:58,499
- I keep hoping he'll ask me out.
- How's that going?

107
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:01,273
Shouldn't you be making brownies
for your friends?

108
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:05,180
- Have you seen the measuring cup?
- The measuring cup?

109
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:08,813
- Yeah.
- Mm.

110
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,322
Oh! Oh.

111
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,797
I... Well, it's got to be here
somewhere. Just keep looking.

112
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:27,132
- I know you're awake.
- I know you're a jerk.

113
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:30,232
Dinner with Tanaka ran long. I'm sorry.

114
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,972
I didn't marry you so I could have
dinner alone six times a week.

115
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,039
You know how bored I was? I came
this close to cleaning the house.

116
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:39,982
Don't be that way. I got you a gift.

117
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:44,079
Nope. No, no, no, no. You're not gonna
buy your way out of this one.

118
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:48,022
It's a good gift.

119
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:57,769
- Is that white gold?
- Yeah. Put it on.

120
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,808
And then make love to me.

121
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,537
I'm not in the mood.

122
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:07,841
But we could stay up and talk.

123
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:11,874
When a man buys a woman jewelry,

124
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:14,249
there are many things
he may want in return.

125
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:18,813
For future reference,
conversation ain't one of 'em.

126
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,926
- Hey, that was a joke.
- Yeah, right.

127
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:26,631
- What the hell's wrong with you?
- Let go of me.

128
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:29,701
- You've been a nightmare for a month.
- Stop.

129
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:33,933
I can't fix it unless you tell me.

130
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,274
It's not exciting anymore, Carlos.

131
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:47,313
So what am I supposed to do?

132
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:52,119
I don't know. Be the way you used to be.

133
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:54,819
Surprise me. Take my breath away.

134
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:58,930
OK.

135
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,295
OK.

136
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,751
- Hey, Susan.
- Mike.

137
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:23,083
What's wrong?

138
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:27,421
I didn't realize anybody was gonna be
out here. I just rolled out of bed.

139
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:32,156
- I'm sure you look fine.
- [Whimpers quietly]

140
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:38,927
Oh... Bongo, Bongo, Bongo.

141
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:43,302
Hey, hey, come on.
Sorry, he scares easy.

142
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:45,936
No, no, it's fine. I get it.

143
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:49,708
I didn't mean to disturb you.
I'II... I'll see you later.

144
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:58,316
- Do you want to have dinner with me?
- Just the two of us?

145
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:02,020
Well... and... and Julie.

146
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:06,087
Uh... it's a thing we do
when somebody moves in.

147
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:09,463
We invite them over for
a home-cooked meal. It's a tradition.

148
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:13,629
- I thought you were a lousy cook.
- Well, I order take-out.

149
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:16,799
You invite 'em for home-cooking
and give 'em take-out?

150
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:20,470
Yeah, ah, it's sort of a new tradition.
I'm working out the kinks.

151
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:27,042
I'll tell you what. How about I cook?
You guys come over to my place.

152
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:30,020
Oh, great.

153
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:33,580
- Friday night at six?
- I'll be there.

154
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:34,990
Right. Come on.

155
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,991
Bye, Bongo. [gasps]

156
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,092
Shh!

157
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,233
Julie! Mike Delfino just invited us
to dinner Friday night.

158
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:53,868
He did? Cool.

159
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:57,382
But only I'm going because
you're gonna come down with something

160
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,749
that requires bed rest and fluids.
[Squeals of delight]

161
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,880
Julie was glad
Susan was rekindling her love life.

162
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:08,984
Of course, she was unaware of her
mother's recent track record with fire.

163
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:15,432
It's all gone. Everything my ex-husband
worked for all those years, gone.

164
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,093
Don't worry about clothing.

165
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:20,297
I already started a collection
from the neighborhood.

166
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:23,466
What? I don't want to wear
other people's old crap.

167
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:27,979
You can be homeless or ungracious.
You really can't afford to be both.

168
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,982
That reminds me. My insurance check
still hasn't come yet.

169
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:34,019
Could I stay with you
a few more weeks?

170
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,452
Of course. What kind
of Christian would I be

171
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:39,616
if I denied shelter to a friend in need?

172
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:43,093
Oh, look.
Here's something we can salvage.

173
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,658
Your measuring cup.

174
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:49,064
We can scrape of the burnt part
and it'll look good as new.

175
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:52,137
That's not my cup. Mine was plastic.

176
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:57,675
- Well, how did it get in here?
- I don't know. Who cares?

177
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,877
Now, would you put that down
and start looking for jewelry.

178
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:16,258
Dr. Albert Goldfine
was the most accomplished

179
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:18,319
marriage counselor in the city.

180
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:23,098
He had dealt with problems
ranging from substance abuse...

181
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:27,502
...to infidelity...

182
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,870
...to domestic violence.

183
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:35,838
Yes, Dr. Goldfine
thought he had sen it all.

184
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:38,941
And then he met the Van De Kamps.

185
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:43,648
Hi. I'm Bree.
And this is my husband Rex.

186
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:46,486
And I brought you
some homemade potpourri.

187
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:53,431
The answer is yes.
You're about to make a fortune off us.

188
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:57,695
- Ah, get off!
- Boys!

189
00:13:57,803 --> 00:14:02,900
Guys, I'm begging you.
Sit in your seats.

190
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:06,570
I'm not gonna tell you again. Buckle up.

191
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:11,942
- [Siren]
- I mean it, so help me...

192
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:15,214
Oh, shoot. Crap!

193
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:21,253
- [Police radio]
- I was playing with it first!

194
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,295
License and registration, please.

195
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:29,096
- Ma'am, you know why I pulled you over?
- I have a theory.

196
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:32,137
The kids should be sitting
wearing seat belts.

197
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:37,107
I yelled at them. They never listen.
It's very frustrating.

198
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:41,442
You have to find a way to control them.
After all, that's your job.

199
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,812
Though he'd ben
a policeman for six years,

200
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:50,049
Officer Hayes had never found himself
in a truly dangerous situation.

201
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:54,354
Then again, he had never before told
a woman how to raise her children.

202
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,791
- Are you saying I'm a bad mother?
- Get back in your car, please.

203
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:05,200
I have no help. My husband's
always away on business.

204
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:07,501
I'm gonna have to ask you
to step back now.

205
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:11,031
My babysitter joined
the witness relocation program.

206
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,840
- I haven't slept through the night...
- Ma'am.

207
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:17,746
...in six years. And for you
to stand there and judge me...

208
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:25,255
Bleurgh!

209
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:34,930
OK. I'm not gonna give you a ticket. I'm
just gonna let you off with a warning.

210
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:39,565
I accept your apology.

211
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,174
[Sighs]

212
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:48,009
- [Boy 1] Aggh!
- [Boy 2] He's kicking me again!

213
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,513
Buckle up.

214
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,499
[Doorbell]

215
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,907
- Mrs. Solis.
- Hello, Jonathan.

216
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:28,079
Well, this is my room.
Sorry about the mess.

217
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:31,281
Oh, uh, don't worry about it.

218
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:35,156
You just missed my mom. On Friday,
she coaches my sister's soccer team.

219
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:37,661
Yes, I heard that.

220
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:42,190
John, we need to talk about
what happened the other day.

221
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,427
Mr. Solis isn't catching on, is he?

222
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:48,200
No, no, he doesn't have a clue,
God love him.

223
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:52,232
It's just I was thinking
that when you come over to garden,

224
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:55,939
you might actually have to garden.

225
00:16:56,015 --> 00:17:00,452
Great, you're breaking up with me.
In my own bedroom.

226
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:03,817
No, no. I'm not dumping you.

227
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:06,857
Lately, you've been
the only thing keeping me going.

228
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:09,155
But we can't do it
at my house anymore.

229
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:12,823
Oh, so then, where do you want to do it?

230
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:17,368
Well, what time does your mom
get back from soccer practise?

231
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:22,205
- Mrs. Solis!
- Hurry. We don't have much time.

232
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,982
And so there's just the four of us.

233
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:43,757
My older son, Andrew, is 16,
Danielle is 15 and...

234
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:47,526
I don't need to see pictures.
Bree, you've spent most of the hour

235
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,624
engaging in small talk.

236
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:52,067
- Oh, have I?
- Yes.

237
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:55,800
Rex has been very vocal
about his issues.

238
00:17:55,908 --> 00:18:01,608
Don't you want to discuss
your feelings about your marriage?

239
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:04,110
[Sighs]

240
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:07,380
Um, Doc...

241
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:11,354
Bree doesn't like
to talk about her feelings.

242
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:14,255
To be honest, it's hard to know
if she has any.

243
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:20,593
Does she feel anger, rage, ecstasy?
Who knows?

244
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:27,730
She's always pleasant, and I can't
tell you how annoying that is.

245
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,903
[Getting fainter] Whatever she feels,
it's so far below the surface...

246
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:35,070
[heartbeat]

247
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,239
[Rex's voice slow and indistinct]

248
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:44,247
[Dr. Goldfine] Bree?

249
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:49,889
- Bree?
- What? I'm sorry.

250
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:53,523
Would you like to respond
to what Rex just said?

251
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:57,261
- Oh, um...
- Is there some truth there?

252
00:18:57,369 --> 00:19:02,773
Do you use housework as a way
to disengage emotionally?

253
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,433
Of course not!

254
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:07,042
[Laughs nervously]

255
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:11,947
This is great.
I got tons of homework tonight.

256
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:15,247
- It's easy to concentrate after sex.
- I'm glad I could help.

257
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,254
Education's very important.

258
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:20,257
Oh, I got something for you.

259
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:24,523
I was gonna give it to you next time I
mowed your lawn, but since you're here.

260
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,033
- Oh, it's a rose.
- It's not just any rose.

261
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,637
Look at all the petals.
There's no flaws.

262
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:35,673
- It's perfect.
- Oh, John.

263
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:37,941
Just like you.

264
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,308
The truth hit her like a thunderbolt.

265
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:44,246
I spent days looking for
just the right one. I finally found it.

266
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:48,252
For John, this was no longer
a meaningless little affair.

267
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:52,756
Gabrielle could now clearly se
he was falling in love with her.

268
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:54,985
It's just beautiful.

269
00:19:57,496 --> 00:20:00,659
I... I got to go.

270
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,264
[John] Goodbye.

271
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:13,676
Hey, you. What are we having?

272
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:18,011
I talked to Julie
and she suggested rib-eye steaks.

273
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:21,211
- She said that's your favorite.
- I love my steak.

274
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,083
- [Horn]
- Hi, Mike.

275
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:26,188
Susan.

276
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,788
Edie.

277
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,624
I'm sorry about your house.
How are you?

278
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:36,430
All right, I guess.
Oh, is somebody having a party?

279
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:39,868
No, Susan's just throwing me
a traditional welcome dinner.

280
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:43,339
Only I'm cooking.
And having it at my house.

281
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:44,636
[They laugh]

282
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:47,873
Traditional? Hm! I didn't get one.

283
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,914
Oh, it's a new tradition.

284
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:53,449
It won't be anything fancy.
Just a little home cooking.

285
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:55,509
Mm. That sounds so good.

286
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:59,546
Susan suddenly had an awful feling
in the pit of her stomach.

287
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,423
I've been having
nothing but fast food lately.

288
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:07,124
As if she was watching
an accident in slow motion.

289
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:11,727
She knew it would happen,
but was powerless to stop it.

290
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,366
Would you like
to join us for dinner?

291
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:23,938
Oh, that's so sweet. No, I don't want
to intrude. Three's a crowd.

292
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:28,281
No, it's not like that.
I mean, Susan's bringing Julie.

293
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:31,618
It's not like that.
The more the merrier.

294
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:35,148
- Well, this'll be fun.
- All right. Tomorrow night.

295
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,354
- We'll eat at six.
- Great.

296
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:40,292
- Oh, and Susan...
- Yeah?

297
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:43,835
This'll make up for the dinner
that you never threw me.

298
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:45,631
Right.

299
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:47,137
Ta-ta.

300
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:51,369
Should I have told her we were having
steak. She's not a vegetarian?

301
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:54,276
Oh, no, no.

302
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:58,315
No, Edie's definitely a carnivore.

303
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,042
[Horn]

304
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:03,747
- Here's, um...
- Ooh.

305
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,449
Here's what I pulled for Edie.

306
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:08,617
Most of the clothes aren't that stylish.

307
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:13,892
Don't worry. Edie's a beggar now,
which means she can't be a chooser.

308
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:17,730
Of course, we don't have to
add salt to the wound.

309
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:20,135
Listen, I was just
getting dinner ready...

310
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:22,206
Say no more.
I'll get out of your hair.

311
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:23,400
No, no.

312
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:28,105
Was that you I saw getting
pulled over by a policeman?

313
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:32,741
Yeah, the boys were acting up in the
car, I couldn't get them to sit down.

314
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:36,617
- Young boys can be so willful.
- I try everything.

315
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:41,091
I scream. I threaten.
I reason. I beg. Nothing works.

316
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:44,492
I don't know if they're too young
to understand

317
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:48,498
or they're just getting some
perverse joy out of testing me.

318
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,160
My mother had the worst time
with me in the car.

319
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:57,539
So one time, she stopped and left me
on the side of the road and drove off.

320
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:02,436
- You're kidding?
- She came back immediately.

321
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:05,972
But I never misbehaved in the car again.
You should try that.

322
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:10,214
Mrs. Huber, I could never leave my kids
by the side of the road.

323
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:13,052
When it comes to discipline,
you must be creative.

324
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:15,888
My mother knew that. Smart lady.

325
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:20,159
Of course, she's in a home now.
And her mind has just turned to mush.

326
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,431
Like I said, I should go back
and get dinner ready.

327
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:29,166
Oh, right, well... goodbye.

328
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:32,004
Goodbye.

329
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:35,011
Susan, have you been able to find
old clothes for Edie?

330
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,707
She has nothing to wear.

331
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:39,181
I thought that was the look
she was going for.

332
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:44,211
Oh, Susan, Edie may be trash,
but she's still a human being.

333
00:23:56,635 --> 00:24:01,265
Zach, is your dad home?
I need to talk to him.

334
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:12,509
Hey, Paul, I hope I'm not interrupting.

335
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:15,348
Actually, I was getting ready
to go somewhere.

336
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:19,891
I just wanted to come by and say hello.
See how you guys are doing.

337
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:23,052
We're trying to move on.
It's been pretty tough.

338
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:27,588
I can only imagine.
Not knowing why Mary Alice...

339
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:30,658
- Why what?
- Why she did it.

340
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:34,238
- Oh. Here, let me help you.
- I've got it. I've got it.

341
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:45,777
- I'm sorry if I upset you.
- Can I be frank?

342
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:48,944
- Of course.
- I don't care what her reasons were.

343
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:53,013
Maybe she was depressed, maybe
she was bored. It doesn't matter.

344
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:58,119
She abandoned her husband
and her son and I'll never forgive her.

345
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:18,606
As I watched Susan,
I couldn't help feling sorry for her.

346
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:21,777
She wanted so much to know why I did it.

347
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:26,615
Why I killed myself.

348
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,953
It's not enough to want the truth.

349
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:36,397
You must know where to look for it.

350
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:44,407
And the truth is elusive
because it knows where to hide.

351
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:49,205
[Knocking]

352
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:56,186
Hello, Julie, I talked to your mom
about donating some clothes for Edie.

353
00:25:56,254 --> 00:26:00,452
She's at Mrs. Van De Kamp's, but I'll
see if she left some stuff upstairs.

354
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:21,378
[Coughs]

355
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:38,828
Oh, Julie, I was just admiring
your new measuring cup.

356
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:42,127
- Yeah, we've lost ours.
- Really?

357
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,500
- So I couldn't find the clothes. Sorry.
- That's OK.

358
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:50,801
- If you want me to keep looking.
- No. You've done more than enough.

359
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:53,001
Truly.

360
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:02,580
Bree. Rex just called. He won't
be able to meet you here today.

361
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:05,451
Apparently, there was
an emergency at the hospital.

362
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:08,991
Oh, well, I wish he'd called me.

363
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:12,996
He suggested perhaps you'd like
to meet with me by yourself.

364
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:16,500
You've been very quiet
in our joint sessions.

365
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:18,794
What?

366
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:23,273
Oh, oh, oh, no, thank you.
I have some things I need to do today.

367
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:27,107
- Are you sure?
- Uh, yeah, I'm sure.

368
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:29,009
OK.

369
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:41,289
Dr. Goldfine,
there is something you can do for me.

370
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:44,954
- What's that?
- Take off your coat.

371
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,499
So you're taking Julie
on your dinner date with Mike?

372
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:53,833
Well, if Edie's gonna be there,
I'll need emotional support.

373
00:27:53,905 --> 00:27:56,897
I can't believe she wormed her way in.
How did you let her?

374
00:27:57,008 --> 00:28:00,603
I don't know. I was gonna take her out,
but it happened so fast.

375
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,079
You need to get there early,

376
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:06,015
spend time with Mike
before the barracuda gets there.

377
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:09,542
That's a good idea.
Edie will get there at 5.45,

378
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:13,853
which means her breasts will arrive
at 5.30, so I should shoot for five.

379
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:16,290
I'm just gonna take these upstairs.

380
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:19,455
I'm gonna keep
my one little bag and go home.

381
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:25,932
That is a beautiful rose.
Where did you get it?

382
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:28,234
Oh, John gave it to me.

383
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:32,666
John... your gardener,
he gave you a rose?

384
00:28:32,777 --> 00:28:37,510
Yes... I'm having some
new bushes planted outside

385
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:39,675
and he gave me that as a color palette.

386
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:42,082
- Oh.
- Yeah.

387
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:44,513
OK.

388
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:49,419
Sure is beautiful, isn't it?

389
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:55,155
Yes, it is.

390
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:59,135
I'm sure Freud
would not approve of this.

391
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:04,335
Who cares? I took Psychology.
We learned all about Freud.

392
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:07,401
- A miserable human being.
- What makes you say that?

393
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:08,877
Think about it.

394
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:13,474
He grew up in the late 1800s.
There were no appliances back then.

395
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,315
His mother had to do everything by hand.

396
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:19,879
Just backbreaking work
from sun up to sundown.

397
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:23,189
Not to mention the countless other
sacrifices she had to make

398
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:26,263
to take care of her family,
and what does he do?

399
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:30,596
He becomes famous peddling a theory
that the problems of most adults

400
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:34,069
can be traced back to something awful
their mother has done.

401
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:37,300
[Sighs] She must've felt so betrayed.

402
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:42,642
He saw how hard she worked.
He saw what she did for him.

403
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:46,706
Did he even ever think to say thank you?

404
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:52,851
I doubt it. [sniffs]

405
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,557
There you go.

406
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:07,331
Just so you know, many of Freud's
theories have been discredited.

407
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:10,540
Good.

408
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:14,169
[Noisy boys in car]

409
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:20,748
Boys, I am not gonna
tell you again. Sit.

410
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,178
I mean it. I am serious.

411
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:29,386
You guys are gonna be in so much trouble
if you don't sit back in those seats.

412
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,691
[Inaudible whispers]

413
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,026
For the first time,

414
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,627
Lynette could se this was not
the innocent play of children.

415
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:42,569
She was being challenged.

416
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:47,835
So she decided
it was time to get creative.

417
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:50,915
[Boys continue shouting]

418
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:58,747
Out! Can't behave,
you heard me, you cannot ride.

419
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:02,490
You, out, move it.

420
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,860
Where is she going?

421
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:24,740
OK. Mommy's a genius.

422

doesn't think it's funny.

Oh! Excuse me.

I'm looking for my boys. Three boys
with red hair. Have you seen them?

431
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:05,252
Yeah. I also saw you
drive away and leave 'em.

432
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:08,450
I was just trying to scare them.
Did you see where they went?

433
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,527
Yeah, they're in my kitchen.

434
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:14,928
Listen, it seems to me that you have
some anger management issues.

435

I have four kids under six.

436
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:20,064
I absolutely
have anger management issues.

I think you need to talk to somebody
because abandoning your children...

438

I didn't abandon them. I came back.

and now I don't have time for this so...

go anywhere until you calm down.

- Stay put.

Oh, my God! Carlos, what have you done?

454
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:44,980
I saw it when I drove by the dealership.
I thought you'd look beautiful in this.

Carlos!

456
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:53,894
It cost me an arm and a leg. It's got
GPS navigation, 200 watt stereo...

457
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:55,933
It is beautiful.

458
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,266
So did I take your breath away?

459
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:01,838
Absolutely.

460
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:07,840
Is it the best gift you've ever gotten?

Gabrielle could se
what this gesture had cost Carlos,

462
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:14,746
so she responded
the only way she knew how.

ben lost on her husband anyway.

After all, it's the rare man
who understands the value

Bongo! I don't know why he barks at you.

475
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:19,011
I wouldn't take it personally.

what freaks them out, huh?

Is it a strange noise?
What is it? A weird smell?

- Round one...

- That is not true, Rex.

What have I been doing for
the past 20 years that's been so awful?

485

You're not saying anything
because I've been a great husband.

486
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:54,917
- And it kills you to admit that.
- Rex, I'm curious.

Do you ever acknowledge
the benefits of living with Bree?

from Mrs. Huber again?

00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:51,640
Isn't Mr. Mullen's brother
your divorce attorney?

500
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:54,371
Uh, yes, yes, he was.

501
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:56,639
Can I say something?

502
00:36:56,714 --> 00:37:00,810
In my heart, I still believe that you
and Karl are gonna get back together.

503
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:03,950
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

504
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:06,546
I've never seen two people more in love.

505
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:10,753
She's never gonna find that kind of
chemistry with another man. Never.

506
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:13,921
It was everything Susan could do
to kep a smile on her face.

507
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:17,489
Round two was underway,
and she was already taking a beating.

508
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:20,503
- You know, Mrs. Britt...
- What Edie hadn't counted on...

509
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:24,007
- I always liked...
...Susan had someone in her corner.

510
00:37:24,108 --> 00:37:26,668
Mr. Rothwell, your fourth husband.

511
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:31,238
He was my second husband.
I've only been married twice.

512
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:35,217
You weren't married to the tattooed guy
they took away in handcuffs?

513
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:38,312
No, Julie, she wasn't married to Javier.

514
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:40,584
That was just one
of her special friends.

515
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:43,524
I think we should change the subject.

516
00:37:43,628 --> 00:37:46,995
Unless you want to
keep talking about it.

517
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:50,158
- Bongo, get down.
- Wait.

518
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:53,328
- Let me show you something.
- He loves that gravy.

519
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:57,237
Come. While you were in there
tossing a salad, I taught him something.

520
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:59,742
Up. Oh...

521
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:01,937
Susan was furious with Edie

522
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:05,413
for using a dog
to ingratiate herself with its owner.

523
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:09,919
She was also furious with Mike for not
seing through this blatant maneuver.

524
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:11,989
- So...
- But mostly...

525
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,091
...I'm gonna get the desserts.

526
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:19,254
...she was furious with herself
for not having thought of it first.

527
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:22,059
I can barely get him to sit.

528
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:25,796
[Edie] Best dog ever. Yes, you are.

529
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:30,465
- I've never seen him walk on two legs.
- He knows who to come to.

530
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:41,980
- Here's your dessert.
- Thank you. Mike, this looks yummy.

531
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:46,454
Mm.

532
00:38:46,557 --> 00:38:50,550
Oh, look at that. Looks like Bongo's
finally warming up to Susan.

533
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:55,622
Ooh, we just got off on the wrong foot.
We're best buddies now.

534
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:02,363
- Oh, what a good boy!
- [Bongo retches]

535
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:05,306
- Bongo, are you OK?
- What's wrong with him?

536
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:08,344
I don't know.
I've never heard him make that sound.

537
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,610
- You OK, fella?
- Mom?

538
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:14,344
[Mike] You all right?

539
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:17,285
You OK?

540
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:25,558
The vet's number's on the fridge.
Tell him I'll be right there.

541
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:28,462
Don't worry.
I'll get everything cleaned up.

542
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:29,658
[Mike] Thanks, Edie.

543
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:33,298
Is there anything I can do?

544
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:36,330
No.

545
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:05,828
- Hey.
- Hey.

546
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,564
How's Bongo?

547
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:10,163
I'm waiting to see
if they'll have to operate.

548
00:40:10,274 --> 00:40:12,139
Oh, God!

549
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:16,371
Uh... I... I...

550
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,645
I stopped and I got this for...

551
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:23,547
I am just so sorry for this.

552
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:25,645
I'm sorry I snapped at you. I just...

553
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:29,123
- Oh, no, it's OK.
- Good news.

554
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:33,095
- We won't have to do surgery.
- Oh, that's great.

555
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:35,860
We've given him something
to help pass the earring.

556
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:40,131
- When he does, should we retrieve it?
- I'm gonna say no.

557
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:44,298
OK. You should be able
to take him home in about an hour.

558
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:48,936
Wow. You must be so relieved.

559
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:53,474
I'm sorry, I was just really worried.

560
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:55,746
It was your dog. I get it.

561
00:40:55,853 --> 00:40:58,583
Actually, he was my wife's dog,

562
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:02,785
one of the last thing's she said to me
in the hospital before she died

563
00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:07,592
was to be sure I looked after him
and I promised her I would.

564
00:41:07,698 --> 00:41:09,757
And just like that,

565
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:13,997
Susan could suddenly
se something she'd never sen before.

566
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:16,733
He, uh, meant so much to her.

567
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:21,608
Mike Delfino was still in love
with his late wife.

568
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:25,206
And if something had happened,
I would've felt like I'd failed her.

569
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:28,681
I know that sounds stupid, but...

570
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:30,481
And she knew right then,

571
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:34,752
neither she nor Edie would be laying
claim to his heart any time soon.

572
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:37,157
No, it doesn't. Not at all.

573
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:42,165
So she decided, for now, she could
settle forjust being his friend.

574
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:44,530
This is for you.

575
00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:46,865
Well, for Bongo. You give it to him.

576
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:04,788
Yes, as I look back
at the world I left behind,

577
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:08,188
it's all so clear to me.

578
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:11,353
The beauty that waits to be unveiled.

579
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:14,454
The mysteries that long to be uncovered.

580
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:22,204
But people so rarely
stop to take a look.

581
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:25,037
They just kep moving.

582
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:31,445
It's a shame, really.

583
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:34,450
There's so much to se.
