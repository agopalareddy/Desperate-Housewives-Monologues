2
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,026
Previously on Desperate Housewives...

3
00:00:03,103 --> 00:00:06,470
- I know why my mom killed herself.
- Secrets were revealed.

4
00:00:06,539 --> 00:00:08,973
I think we should go to the police.

5
00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:12,602
- Relationships got complicated.
- What are you doing here?

6
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:15,647
- You think she's cheating on you?
- I think so.

7
00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:17,615
We got a call about a break-in.

8
00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:20,208
I've seen a lot
but this is something else.

9
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:23,983
- And the mystery...
- Why did you do this?

10
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,149
- I don't know.
...depened.

11
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,824
Suburbia is a battle ground,

12
00:00:35,935 --> 00:00:39,072
an arena for all forms
of domestic combat.

13
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:44,367
Husbands clash with wives,
parents cross swords with children.

14
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:47,537
But the bloodiest battles
often involve women

15
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:49,842
and their mothers-in-law.

16
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:53,443
The war for control of Carlos
began the night he proposed,

17
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:57,614
and Gabrielle had ben losing ground
to Juanita ever since.

18
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:02,491
From the prenuptial agrement
which she reluctantly signed...

19
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:09,793
to the selection of wedding music
she despised...

20
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:15,439
to the color of the house paint
she hadn't wanted,

21
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:19,239
Gabrielle had suffered
one defeat after another.

22
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:25,380
And now that Juanita suspected
her daughter-in-law of having an affair,

23
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:28,477
it had become increasingly apparent,
in this war...

24
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,954
Mrs. Solis, I'll be at the market.

25
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:34,152
...no prisoners would be taken.

26
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,093
Thank you, Yao Lin.

27
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:40,792
I don't see why you have her.

28
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:42,926
It's a big house. I need help.

29
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:47,939
It's only called help
when you do some of the work yourself.

30
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:51,101
I supervise.

31
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:55,011
- You pay her $300 a week.
- Mm-hm.

32
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:57,948
That's $15,000 a year.

33
00:01:58,017 --> 00:02:02,420
Carlos, you always say you're not
putting away enough for retirement.

34
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:05,390
Baby, it would be a good idea
to cut back on expenses.

35
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:07,858
You want me to take care
of this place alone?

36
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:10,987
Other women manage.

37
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,635
Ahem.

38
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:35,218
That's nice.

39
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:38,847
- You like that?
- Oh, yeah.

40
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:41,860
God, I'm gonna miss this, Carlos.

41
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:44,989
What do you mean?

42
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:49,364
Well, since I'm gonna have to be
doing the cooking

43
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:54,031
and the cleaning and all the shopping
like the other wives,

44
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:58,373
I'm gonna be exhausted at night,
just like all the other wives.

45
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:02,245
Till I build up my stamina, of course.

46
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:05,148
And that might take a couple of years.

47
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:18,162
Sadly for Juanita, she had ignored
the first rule of war...

48
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:21,132
- Good morning, Carlos.
- The maid stays.

49
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:27,629
Never underestimate your enemy.

50
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,743
Of the many suburban rituals,

51
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:17,016
none is quite so cherished
as the neighborhood yard sale.

52
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:19,091
Shoppers come to sift through

53
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:22,093
the discarded belongings
of someone they don't know,

54
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:25,597
in hopes of finding bargains
they don't really ned,

55
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:29,657
each so determined to save a few pennies

56
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:33,001
they often miss hidden treasures.

57
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:38,942
- Hey, Paul.
- Hi, Susan.

58
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:42,470
I was a little surprised
to see Mary Alice's award for sale.

59
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:45,381
She got it for doing charity work.

60
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:49,410
Zach and I are moving. We don't need
to carry any more than is necessary.

61
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:54,051
That makes sense. I just wanted to make
sure you didn't want it for Zach.

62
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,823
Something to remember his mother by.

63
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:59,921
Zach doesn't need a piece of glass
to remember his mother.

64
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:05,198
I'm out of newspaper. Here.
Let's call it ten bucks for everything.

65
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:10,140
Great. Speaking of Zach...
I haven't seen him around lately.

66
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:14,441
He's been a bit depressed.
I sent him to stay with relatives.

67
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:17,277
- Oh. Which ones?
- You don't know them.

68
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:21,684
- How did you get the fat lip?
- The usual way.

69
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:24,484
Asking too many questions.

70
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:34,226
- Did you find out where Zach is?
- No.

71
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,098
But he's not staying with relatives.

72
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:40,969
It could be any one of these guys
she's having an affair with.

73
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:44,043
Don't worry about it.
I'm not letting her out of my sight.

74
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:46,236
Who the hell is that?

75
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:49,440
Do you think that's the guy
she's having an affair with?

76
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:54,509
Carlos, a guy she talks to in public
isn't someone you're gonna worry about.

77
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,885
So it's someone
that she doesn't talk to.

78
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,823
Do I have to beat up every guy in town?

79
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:04,727
Marriage takes work.

80
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:08,324
Course he's playing it close to
the vest. Paul knows we're onto him.

81
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:12,871
Zach said Mary Alice killed herself
because of something he'd done.

82
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:15,840
Is there anyone
who'd know what he was talking about?

83
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:18,741
No. We have to find him.
It's the only way we'll know.

84
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:20,870
Zach is such a sweet kid.

85
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,642
I can't imagine him
doing anything that terrible.

86
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:27,482
He did break into your house.
He's obviously troubled in some way.

87
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:35,652
Severe depression,
borderline personality disorder.

88
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:41,023
- Zach is a deeply troubled young man.
- I'm aware of that.

89
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,036
- What are you giving him?
- Antidepressants and a mood stabilizer.

90
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:46,230
Good.

91
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:48,174
I'm also recommending extensive
psychotherapy to help unearth...

92
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:50,608
I'm also recommending extensive
psychotherapy to help unearth...

93
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:53,236
I don't think so.

94
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:59,509
Mr. Young,
I can't just medicate him indefinitely.

95
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,782
Forget the Freud
and stick with the drugs.

96
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:05,653
No new treatments without my permission.

97
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:14,461
I think this is going to be a great
version of Little Red Riding Hood.

98
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:20,028
It is your involvement that makes
the plays here at Barcliff so special.

99
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:23,007
Thank you.

100
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:25,873
I would like to turn over
the next part of our meeting

101
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:29,779
to our parent coordinator,
the amazing Maisy Gibbons.

102
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:35,648
Thank you, Miss Truesdale.
Now before everyone leaves,

103
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:38,918
we have new copies
of the script up here.

104
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:42,893
Tilda and Frances and I
went to the rehearsal yesterday,

105
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:46,420
and we were a little troubled
by the ending.

106
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:49,865
Killing the wolf.
It sends the wrong message to our kids.

107
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:54,873
We believe that animals should
only be euthanized as a last resort.

108
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:57,341
[Laughs]

109
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:03,940
- Do you find something amusing?
- I'm sorry. I thought you were kidding.

110
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,645
- No.
- Oh. OK.

111
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:12,952
In our version, the wolf is aggressive
because he has a thorn in his paw,

112
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:16,688
and the woodsman will take out the thorn
and send Mr. Wolf on his way.

113
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:19,822
I'm sorry.
Aren't we doing Little Red Riding Hood?

114
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:23,027
- Yes.
- You know that the wolf is a bad guy?

115
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:25,228
He eats Little Red's grandma.

116
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:29,138
If you let him go, he's gonna chow down
on other defenseless old ladies.

117
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:33,303
- I'm sorry. And you are?
- I'm Lynette Scavo.

118
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:36,848
My twins just joined.
They're playing oak trees.

119
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,407
Oh, of course. Lynette.

120
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:44,182
Let's see. You are signed up to take
tickets the night of the show, right?

121
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:47,693
- Yeah.
- Well, with all due respect,

122
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,990
let's leave the creative suggestions

123
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:53,065
to the mothers
who have assumed the heavy lifting.

124
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,966
Sure. Whatever.

125
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:01,734
I must say I'm jealous
of how much time you two spend together.

126
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:05,800
My mother-in-law would
never want to hang out with me all day.

127
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,073
She sounds nice.

128
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:11,878
- Hey.
- Oh. Hey there, you two.

129
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:14,146
Hi, John.

130
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,984
Mrs. Solis.

131
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:20,252
I wasn't aware you two were friends.

132
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:25,457
- Yeah. We go to the same school.
- Of course you do.

133
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:27,761
We'll be upstairs in my room studying.

134
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,199
Have fun.

135
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:38,775
Doesn't it make you nervous?
A boy alone upstairs with Danielle?

136
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:42,780
I don't worry about John. Both he and
Danielle are in the abstinence club.

137
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:49,285
Coffee's a little hot.

138
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:58,793
Susan was infuriated
by Paul's evasive answers.

139
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,395
She was convinced
he was deliberately hiding Zach

140
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:07,666
and hiding the truth.

141
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,801
She hoped that finding one
would lead to the other.

142
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:18,179
To succed, Susan would
have to be evasive herself.

143
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,241
[Doorbell]

144
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:25,589
- Susan. Long time no see.
- Mrs. Greenberg.

145
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:30,594
Do you remember those two eggs
I let you borrow last Christmas?

146
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:35,258
- I need those back.
- Gosh, honey, I'm fresh out.

147
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:39,134
- But I could run to the store.
- Oh, forget about it.

148
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,469
It's not that important.

149
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:46,136
But since I'm here, do you still have
that hatchback sitting in your garage?

150
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:49,578
- Can I borrow it tomorrow?
- You want to borrow my car?

151
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,514
Just for a couple of hours.

152
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:54,747
I'm not sure.
Do you know how to drive a stick?

153
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:57,448
Yes, I think so. I learned in college.

154
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:59,683
It's like riding a bike, right?

155
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:03,661
- I'm not sure, dear.
- It's just for a couple of hours.

156
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:06,664
I let you borrow my eggs
for a whole year.

157
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:11,967
I'm very pleased with the work
we've done in our sessions thus far.

158
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:16,098
- We're making excellent progress.
- Thank you. I feel good about it.

159
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:20,669
But there are a few areas of your
marriage we haven't covered yet.

160
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:23,647
Oh, really? Like what?

161
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:30,418
Um... I've told Dr. Goldfine
in our private sessions

162
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,083
that I'm not happy with our sex life.

163
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:41,926
And Rex feels that
when the two of you have intercourse,

164
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:44,866
you're not as connected as you could be.

165
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,767
- Connected?
- Yeah.

166
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:50,467
Like you're thinking about other things.
Is your hair messed up?

167
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,478
Did you buy the toothpaste?
You're just not there.

168
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:57,640
This kind of disconnect is often
a symptom of a deeper problem.

169
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:01,847
So we were talking and the idea
of a sexual surrogate came up.

170
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:05,890
This is a licensed professional
who'd work with you as a couple

171
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:08,926
on solving whatever sexual problems
you may be having.

172
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:11,462
I have an excellent referral.

173
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:15,261
And what would this
sexual surrogate person do?

174
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:17,767
- She would coach us.
- She?

175
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,771
She's very discreet.
You'll hardly notice she's there.

176
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:26,402
Oh. So she would be in the room with us
while we make love?

177
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:30,676
Yes. Helping us to achieve
maximum sexual potential.

178
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:36,216
- Do you have any questions?
- Just one.

179
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:39,155
How much longer
is your mid-life crisis going to last?

180
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:42,786
Because it is really starting
to tick me off.

181
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,640
Right. Everyone's down for a nap.

182
00:12:57,743 --> 00:13:00,906
We've got no more than an hour.
Let's get cracking.

183
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,346
Five-card draw. Nothing wild.

184
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,717
- How is it going with Mike, Susan?
- It's going, finally.

185
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:13,350
We have a date next week. He's taking me
to see a play or something.

186
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:17,691
Might I suggest the Barcliff Academy
production of Little Red Riding Hood?

187
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:20,527
Oh, that's right.
The twins' stage debut.

188
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,294
- Are they having fun?
- Sure. They play oak trees.

189
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:26,098
I have to deal with the drama
behind the scenes.

190
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:29,141
- You've met Maisy Gibbons?
- She's a total nightmare.

191
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:31,869
- I shouldn't have challenged her.
- Oh, dear.

192
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,639
Now no one on the play committee
wants to talk to me.

193
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:37,875
Maisy does love
to rule her little kingdom.

194
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,408
Hasn't changed since Girl Scouts.
Girls smile at you to your face

195
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,650
then make fun of you
'cause you're not shaving your legs yet.

196
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:48,090
- [Car horn]
- That wouldn't happen in Boy Scouts.

197
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,993
When I worked with men,
I preferred how they fought.

198
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:53,587
A guy takes his opponent on
face-to-face,

199
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,725
and once he's won, he's top dog.

200
00:13:57,236 --> 00:14:00,171
- It's primitive but it's fair.
- And a lot less sneaky.

201
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:03,867
Isn't it sexist of us
to generalize like this?

202
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:07,344
It's science. Sociologists
have documented this stuff.

203
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:10,711
Well, who am I
to argue with sociologists?

204
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:16,954
Wow, this guacamole has got a kick.

205
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:21,288
I'm gonna run to the little girl's room.
You go ahead. I might be a while.

206
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,454
I hate playing three-handed poker.
Let's take a break.

207
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,624
- I'll play.
- You play poker?

208
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,569
- I used to play with my grandfather.
- Pull up a chair.

209
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:32,696
You're just playing for chips?

210
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:37,435
My grandfather used to say
it's always more fun to play for money.

211
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:39,977
- Why not? 50 cents a bet?
- Make it a buck.

212
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,479
Three raise limit, $20 buy-in.

213
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:15,880
- Mrs. Solis! What are you doing?
- Why haven't you returned my calls?

214
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:20,008
- I've been busy.
- I've seen who you've been busy with.

215
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:23,646
Danielle? Come on. She's just a friend.

216
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:26,452
Before you get any friendlier,
let me remind you,

217
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:29,083
I can do things to you
she can't even pronounce.

218
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:33,063
A lot of good it does me with your
mother-in-law following you around.

219
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:36,033
Maybe we should just cool it
for a while.

220
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,035
No, John, please don't say that.

221
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,799
I have everything under control.

222
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,171
Now give me a boost.

223
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,715
Hey. So what did I miss?

224
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:54,913
Not much. Just a few friendly hands
of poker with the girls.

225
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,067
I'm sorry I'm late.

226
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:17,973
As I'm sure you've all heard, Celia Bond
broke her wrist playing tennis.

227
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:21,740
Which means we are now in need
of someone to do the costumes.

228
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:25,272
I'm keeping my fingers crossed.
Are there any volunteers?

229
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:29,447
- I'll do it.
- Really? Do you know how to sew?

230
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:31,955
Absolutely.

231
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:35,152
Well, great. Thank you, Lynette.

232
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:46,467
OK. So now that
I'm going to do some "heavy lifting",

233
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:50,770
I believe I have the right to talk about
the changes made to the script?

234
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:56,681
Um...

235
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:59,182
Ladies.

236
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:03,243
We grew up with Little Red Riding Hood,
and survived it, scary stuff and all.

237
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:06,257
So I say to hell
with political correctness.

238
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:10,522
Let our kids experience this classic
like it was meant to be enjoyed.

239
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:14,190
Let's kill the damn wolf
and just put on the best show we can.

240
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:23,706
Thank you, Lynette,
for that impassioned speech.

241
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:27,711
- But I believe that ship has sailed.
- No! It hasn't.

242
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:30,976
We still have time
to change the ending back.

243
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:35,248
And you know, Maisy,
it is just a fairy tale.

244
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:38,482
I don't think
it will upset the children.

245
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:42,049
- I think you're wrong.
- That's what's great about democracy.

246
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:44,391
Everyone's entitled to their opinion.

247
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:47,296
Also, everyone has a right to vote.

248
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:52,167
So all in favor of the woodsman going
medieval on the big bad wolf's ass.

249
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:15,480
Dr. Goldfine.

250
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:18,421
- Bree.
- You're dining alone?

251
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,516
- Actually, I am.
- What a coincidence. So am I.

252
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:25,290
Seems a shame for us to eat
by ourselves. Shall I pull up a chair?

253
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:30,392
Bree, it's nothing personal,
but I never socialize with clients.

254
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,834
Oh.

255
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:36,705
Oh, I get it. I'm so sorry.
Of course. It's inappropriate.

256
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:42,771
It's just that after yesterday
there's so much I need to say because...

257
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:49,080
I suppose it can wait.

258
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:18,211
No, Lynette, I'm sorry.
Juanita's taking a bath.

259
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:22,015
How much did she win from you?

260
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,315
Jeez!

261
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:26,891
Yeah, I guess she'll take a check.

262
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:29,392
OK. All right. Bye.

263
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:33,954
- What was that about?
- Your mother is quite the card shark.

264
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:37,296
You let her play cards?
How long did she play?

265
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:39,597
Not that long. Why?

266
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:43,400
Carlos, what is it?

267
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:50,739
I never told you this, but my mother
had a serious gambling problem.

268
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,744
Was this before we were married?

269
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:57,447
Yeah. It was bad.

270
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:03,156
She went into debt. Dipped into her
savings, started hocking jewelry.

271
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,288
Honey, it was only
a small neighborhood game.

272
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:09,959
It doesn't take much
for her to fall off the wagon.

273
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:12,526
I know she seems like
a very strong woman but...

274
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,072
She has a major weakness.

275
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:21,204
Honey... Oh... It's OK.

276
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:24,043
You were right to tell me this.

277
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:28,483
And you understand
I have to treat this as a session.

278
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:30,544
Of course. That's fine.

279
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:34,456
- Shall I include the meal?
- Oh, no. We'll split that.

280
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,891
OK.

281
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:42,757
So let's talk about yesterday.

282
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:46,065
Do you think there might have been
some truth in what Rex said?

283
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,867
No, I don't.

284
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:52,569
Bree, it's not uncommon for people
experiencing sexual repression

285
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,908
to distance themselves during the act.

286
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,048
Do you see me as some sort of prude
who just lays there like a cold fish?

287
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:59,916
Do you see me as some sort of prude
who just lays there like a cold fish?

288
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:04,321
- I love sex.
- All right.

289
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:08,621
I love everything about it.
The sensations. The smells.

290
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:11,161
I especially love the feel of a man.

291
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:14,494
All that muscle and sinew
pressed against my body.

292
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:17,500
And then when you add friction!

293
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:19,729
Mm!

294
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:22,363
The tactile sensation
of running my tongue

295
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:25,136
over a man's nipple ever so gently.

296
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:28,737
And then there's the act itself.
Two bodies becoming one,

297
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,816
and that final eruption of pleasure.

298
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:36,211
The only thing I don't like about sex
is the scrotum.

299
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:39,746
Obviously it has its practical
applications, but I'm not a fan.

300
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:43,853
Can I get you something?

301
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:46,396
Uh... just the check, please.

302
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:49,160
Sir, you haven't ordered yet.

303
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:51,532
Oh.

304
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:56,835
- We're not shopping?
- Let's stop here for lunch.

305
00:22:56,942 --> 00:23:01,470
This place has the best buffet in town.
All-you-can-eat crab legs.

306
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:06,314
- Oh, no!
- What's wrong? Let's go.

307
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:10,616
It's late. They're only holding
the suede mini for me until 2:00.

308
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:14,090
If we stay I'll never make it.
We'll just have lunch at the mall.

309
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:17,719
Wait. Uh...
I'm really in the mood for crab legs.

310
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:22,392
- Drop me off and you can come back.
- It might take over an hour.

311
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:25,027
It's a buffet. There's no rush.

312
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:35,612
Hi, John. Motel. Ten minutes. Be there.

313
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,348
All right. Off you go. Thanks.

314
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:47,414
Lynette, I noticed you forgot the
coonskin on that hunter's coonskin cap.

315
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:50,051
Yeah. That was a creative call.

316
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:57,859
I'm in the middle of a crisis. If I
don't take shortcuts I'll never finish.

317
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:01,303
Jordana Geist manages
to get her work done.

318
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:03,738
She runs the concessions,
paints the sets,

319
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:07,677
and still has time to take care
of her three kids and a husband.

320
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:09,611
We can't have the students suffer

321
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:13,640
just because you don't understand
the concept of time management.

322
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:17,119
The kids won't suffer
without a clump of fur on their heads.

323
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:23,259
OK. I'll make a creative call.
We'll cut the oak trees.

324
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:26,229
That forest is looking
a little dense anyway.

325
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:31,264
- My boys are the oak trees.
- Are they?

326
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:35,863
Well, I wouldn't worry. We'll find
something for them to do backstage.

327
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:39,102
That's where the real action is.

328
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:43,045
- I'll finish the costumes.
- Well. Crisis averted.

329
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:55,049
- You have lost your mind.
- I checked up on Silvercrest.

330
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:57,720
It's a treatment center
for troubled kids.

331
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:01,265
I create the distraction,
you blend in and find Zach.

332
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:03,993
How could I blend in
with messed-up teenagers?

333
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:07,970
I don't know, Julie.
Pretend to be bulimic. Gag a little.

334
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:10,541
Come on. Work with me here.

335
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:14,134
When this is over, we need
to talk about your parenting skills.

336
00:25:14,212 --> 00:25:18,046
OK, fine. You don't want to help me,
I'm not gonna force you.

337
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:20,674
It's not that I don't want to.
It's just...

338
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:23,220
Why does this mean so much to you?

339
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:25,688
'Cause Mary Alice was a wonderful
person.

340
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:30,251
And now all anybody thinks is that
she did this terrible, selfish thing.

341
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,660
And I think there's more to it
than that.

342
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:38,294
She was my friend, Julie, and I owe it
to her to find out the truth.

343
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,209
Juanita, what's wrong?

344
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:05,287
Juanita?

345
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:09,424
I didn't go to the buffet.
I went gambling instead and I lost.

346
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:13,402
How much did you have on you?
It couldn't have been much.

347
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:16,099
I used Carlos' credit card.

348
00:26:16,174 --> 00:26:20,304
- OK. How much did you charge?
- I don't know. It stopped working.

349
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:24,678
What do you mean? This thing has like
a $15,000 credit limit.

350
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:29,545
Oh.

351
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:37,252
[Knock on door]

352
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:52,438
The man at the desk said there were
no vacant rooms. Can I bunk with you?

353
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:55,012
Bree, what are you doing here?

354
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:59,345
It's a little chilly out here.
Do you mind if we discuss this inside?

355
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:03,381
Come on in.

356
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:13,159
Sure is nice and toasty in here.

357
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:19,735
- You look amazing.
- Thanks.

358
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:22,363
I was hoping you'd notice.

359
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:29,003
Well, it certainly isn't the Ritz,
but it has all the essentials.

360
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:41,992
- I don't know what to say.
- Then perhaps you should say nothing.

361
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:12,621
Rex? Baby...

362
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:16,990
- I just need a minute.
- What?

363
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:23,090
Sweetie, just leave it, will you?
Just leave it.

364
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:43,185
OK, baby. Where were we?

365
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:45,313
I told you to leave it.

366
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:48,426
I'm sorry. I just...

367
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:52,827
Oh, come on. Are you gonna make
a big deal about this?

368
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,566
You know...

369
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:03,164
to tell you the truth,
now is not really a good time for me.

370
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:15,920
It's obvious you've
never had to remove a cheese stain.

371
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:26,253
Bree, I totally understand.
Yeah, I already tried Susan.

372
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:29,492
And Gaby can't sew.
Seriously, I'm gonna be fine.

373
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:32,730
Yeah. Ow! Thanks anyway. Bye-bye.

374
00:29:32,837 --> 00:29:36,705
I'm a little ahead with my painting
if you need some help.

375
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:40,800
Oh, Jordana, you are a life-saver.
Thank you.

376
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:43,403
Here. These pieces need trim.

377
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:46,780
I'll help for as long as I can
but I have a lot on my plate tonight.

378
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:49,285
I have to make 25 mini quiches
for my book club.

379
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:53,791
You're not human. You were sent by
aliens to make humans feel inadequate.

380
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:58,662
Seriously, how do you cram it all in?

381
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:04,533
- Can you keep a secret?
- Um... sure.

382
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,982
That's ADD medication.
My kids take this. Or they almost did.

383
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:22,484
I thought it calmed you down.

384
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:25,522
Has the opposite effect
if you don't have ADD.

385
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,922
Ever chug a pot of Turkish coffee?

386
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:31,418
You're taking your kids' medication?

387
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,987
Once in a while. Do you want a couple?

388
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:38,831
Oh, that's very kind of you but I just
smoked some crack a little while ago.

389
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:41,337
I'd better not mix.

390
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:49,010
I'll sell some jewelry, pay off the
card, and Carlos will never find out.

391
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,572
- You would do that for me?
- Why wouldn't I?

392
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:54,709
For starters, you hate me.

393
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:58,517
Oh, that is overstating it... a little.

394
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:04,823
The bottom line is, no matter how much
I dislike you, I love Carlos more.

395
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:12,195
If Carlos finds out, he'll be
devastated. I don't wanna see him hurt.

396
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:16,797
Don't believe I'm a good person,
but believe I care about my husband.

397
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:22,044
Fine. To heck with it.

398
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:26,139
I'm not gonna risk my neck
to protect you. I'm calling Carlos.

399
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:30,949
Juanita might have ben
the gambler of the family...

400
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:36,324
Wait. I believe you.

401
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:41,023
...but Gabrielle was the one
who knew how to bluff.

402
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:52,406
Hi. I'm Susan Mayer. I have
an appointment to see Dr. Sicher.

403
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:55,173
Yes, he's expecting you.
Let me get him for you.

404
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:10,525
- Hi. I'm Dr. Sicher.
- Susan Mayer.

405
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:13,392
So you're doing research
for a children's book?

406
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:15,261
I sure am.

407
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,140
Zach?

408
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:32,673
Oh. Hi, Julie.

409
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:38,913
- What's wrong with you?
- Just all the pills they make me take.

410
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:43,259
They kinda make me sleepy.

411
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:46,295
- What are you doing here?
- I came to see how you were.

412
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:50,824
And to ask you something.
Look, I don't have much time.

413
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:53,703
What is it?

414
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:56,603
You told Mrs. Van De Kamp
your mom killed herself

415
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:58,767
because of something bad you did.

416
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:01,879
What were you talking about?

417
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:08,577
After my mom died, I started remembering
things that happened when I was little.

418
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:14,883
- What happened to Dana.
- Dana? Who's Dana?

419
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,689
What are you doing here?

420
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:20,320
I was just visiting my friend.

421
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:23,629
This patient is not allowed visitors.

422
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:27,071
I guess I have to go.

423
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:32,069
I am so sorry, Zach.

424
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:50,754
Hi.

425
00:33:50,828 --> 00:33:56,130
I don't want to disturb you.
I just left some important papers here.

426
00:33:58,603 --> 00:34:02,232
- What are you doing?
- I'm repairing a chipped mug.

427
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:05,002
Why don't you just buy a new one?

428
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:08,011
Because I think it's better
to fix what you already have.

429
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:14,076
Listen. Um...

430
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:20,155
- About what happened today.
- You humiliated me, Rex.

431
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:22,692
For no good reason.

432
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:26,194
- I'm sorry.
- I was there. I was willing.

433
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:31,395
- Normal men don't say no to that.
- You... You upset me.

434
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:35,371
See, I don't think that's the reason.

435
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:41,072
After I left the motel, I did some
thinking about us and our sex life.

436
00:34:41,145 --> 00:34:44,239
I realized there has been a disconnect.

437
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:46,840
- But it's coming from you.
- That's ridiculous.

438
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:50,083
For years we've been making love

439
00:34:50,154 --> 00:34:52,884
and you've started
to ask me something then stopped.

440
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:56,960
- What are you talking about?
- You are unhappy with our sex life

441
00:34:57,061 --> 00:35:00,622
because you're not getting something
but you're too afraid to ask.

442
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:04,395
My problem is that you can't stop
thinking about the housework.

443
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:07,302
Then take me right here, right now.

444
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:11,171
The house is spotless. There are no
burritos around to pull my focus.

445
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:14,711
- I'm not in the mood.
- Why not?

446
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:20,182
We haven't had sex for months. Most men
would be climbing the walls by now.

447
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:24,516
- Please don't do this.
- Rex, whatever you want.

448
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:28,787
I will go there with you.
You just have to say it out loud.

449
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:32,090
Tell me. What do you want?
What do you need?

450
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:35,462
I need for you to stop talking like
this. You sound like a whore.

451
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:38,661
No, I sound like a woman
whose husband won't touch her.

452
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:51,646
Rex, after Mary Alice killed herself,
it all hit me.

453
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:55,344
We all have our secrets. I think
it's time for you to tell me yours.

454
00:36:07,965 --> 00:36:10,263
I'm going.

455
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:28,074
That night, while most
of Wisteria Lane dreamt the night away,

456
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:32,486
Lynette was in the middle
of her own personal nightmare.

457
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:37,392
Determined her boys
would not miss their fairy-tale debut,

458
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:41,556
Lynette had stayed up
18 hours straight, sewing.

459
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:47,593
But she began to fear her story
would not have a happy ending.

460
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:58,772
Luckily for Lynette,
she had a magic potion handy.

461
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:04,515
And once she had taken it...

462
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:11,487
the magic kept working...

463
00:37:14,298 --> 00:37:17,461
and working...

464
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:22,399
and working.

465
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:29,570
It wasn't until noon
that Lynette finally took a break,

466
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:34,675
and the reality of what she had done
began to sink in.

467
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:37,549
My. What big eyes you have.

468
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,186
I'm going to the store.
Do you need anything?

469
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:48,891
I'm fine, thank you.

470
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:54,102
So what's been going on with her?
Have you found anything out yet?

471
00:37:54,171 --> 00:38:00,735
Actually, the more I watch her, the more
I think she's not stepping out on you.

472
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:04,975
- Really?
- Yeah. She's not perfect, Lord knows.

473
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:08,450
But she loves you. I can tell.

474
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:10,520
[Sighs]

475
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:14,523
Mama. You don't know what a relief it is
to hear that.

476
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:20,522
You know, it's funny.
I really think she loves you, too.

477
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:22,725
Oh?

478
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:28,704
I got concerned when I heard
you played poker with her friends.

479
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,966
So I told her about your little problem.

480
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:38,547
You told her about my gambling problem?

481
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:42,312
Don't be mad. I just didn't want you
slipping into old habits.

482
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:46,948
- She was very concerned about you.
- She knew?

483
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:57,428
I don't get it. You and Zach never
went to school with anybody named Dana.

484
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,492
He didn't say
we went to school with her.

485
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:03,939
- Did it sound like a relative?
- It sounded like "Dana".

486
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:07,034
Unless he was using a code,
that's all I got.

487
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:11,275
OK, give me a break here.
I'm just grasping at straws.

488
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:16,878
I'm sorry. I'm worried about Zach.
It's really creepy in there.

489
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:20,582
- Can't we get him out?
- Honey, that's up to his father.

490
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:26,287
- Then I want to visit again.
- That's not a good idea either.

491
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:28,797
Why?

492
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:33,598
I just have a feeling.

493
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,713
Juanita was now
more convinced than ever

494
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:49,275
that her treacherous
daughter-in-law was having an affair.

495
00:39:49,353 --> 00:39:52,948
But the question remained, with whom?

496
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:09,501
And suddenly...

497
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:14,100
Juanita remembered
it wasn't the men Gabrielle talked to

498
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:16,270
that she had to worry about.

499
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:26,589
Hey, Jordana, Maisy.
Here are the costumes. Right on time.

500
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:29,285
Thank you, Lynette.

501
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:36,556
This is a bit awkward. There has been
an oversight with the programs.

502
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:40,000
Celia Bond is still credited
with costumes.

503
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:43,164
They forgot to tell the printer.

504
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,265
Uh-huh.

505
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:50,109
Who is "they", as in,
"they forgot to tell the printer"?

506
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:55,809
That would be me. I'm sorry.

507
00:40:55,886 --> 00:41:00,255
But I was so overworked this week with
all the script changes you demanded.

508
00:41:00,357 --> 00:41:02,882
Uh-huh. Well, these things happen.

509
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:07,564
Be right back.

510
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:12,400
Would you do something with this?
It looks like road kill.

511
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:17,839
OK, lady, that's it.

512
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:22,235
- I beg your pardon?
- We have kids the same age.

513
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:25,577
There are years ahead of us
having to deal with each other.

514
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:29,779
So instead of playing petty games, why
don't we put an end to this right now?

515
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:33,722
- What are you saying?
- Let's take it outside.

516
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:37,352
- Let's take what outside?
- Your sorry ass. We're throwin' down.

517
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:40,226
- You are crazy.
- Just being practical.

518
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:42,094
Isn't it better to settle this

519
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,532
rather than endure
all this alpha-mom crap

520
00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:47,160
until our kids graduate?

521
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:50,332
Come on.
I'll even let you take the first shot.

522
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:03,810
- I don't have time for this.
- Yeah, I didn't think so.

523
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:07,618
And just so you know,
next spring, when we do Bambi,

524
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:12,389
his mother's gonna take a slug
to the heart and you're gonna like it.

525
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:24,704
The search for power begins
when we're quite young.

526
00:42:24,775 --> 00:42:30,975
As children, we're taught that the power
of good triumphs over the power of evil.

527
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:37,578
But as we get older, we realize
that nothing is ever that simple.

528
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:41,522
Traces of evil always remain.
