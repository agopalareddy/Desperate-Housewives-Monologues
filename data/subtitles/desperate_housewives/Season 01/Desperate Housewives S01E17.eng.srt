00:00:03,236 --> 00:00:06,501
The police showed me your rap sheet.
You killed a man.

4
00:00:06,573 --> 00:00:09,167
- Want to hear what happened?
- It doesn't matter.

5
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:11,904
I will never believe
anything you say ever again.

[Mary Alice] Unexpected visitors...

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,441
- She's cheating on you?
- I think so.

8
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,541
- I'll take care of it.
- Thank you, Mama.

...lead to unexpected consequences.

10
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:24,019
Andrew, you almost killed
another human being.

11
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,717
She's lived her life.

12
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:29,353
I have my whole life ahead of me
and now it might be screwed up.

13
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:39,333
In the coma ward
at Sacred Heart Hospital,

14
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:43,536
the dreams begin just after midnight.

15
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,841
The pitch black of night
gives way to vivid images

16
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:49,473
that comfort the dreamer
until the morning.

17
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:53,313
Gus, the custodian,

18
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:56,753
dreams of some day winning the lottery

19
00:00:56,823 --> 00:01:00,020
and quitting his thankless job.

20
00:01:02,762 --> 00:01:04,855
Howard, the security guard,

21
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:10,597
envisions a luxurious retirement
in the tropics.

22
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,605
Ruth Ann, the night nurse,

23
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:16,904
fantasizes about leaving her husband.

24
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:27,183
But the most vivid dreams of all
belong to the patient in Room 312.

25
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:33,089
Yes, Juanita Solis had ben
dreaming steadily for five months.

26
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:34,751
Sometimes,

27
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:38,662
of the shocking secret
she had uncovered.

28
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:46,133
Other times, she dreamt of the accident
that had put her in the hospital.

29
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:50,469
But her most common dream

30
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:56,709
was the one in which
she finally told her son the truth.

31
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:01,012
And then one night,

32
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:05,251
Juanita Solis decided it was time...

33
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:07,088
...to wake up.

34
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,459
[Coughs hoarsely] Hello?

35
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:18,065
Is anybody here?

36
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:21,635
Hello?

37
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,804
I have to call my son!

38
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:31,246
Huh!

39
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,303
Aah!

[Juanita groans and grunts]

41
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:09,684
Even though she knew she was
about to die, Juanita didn't care.

42
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:12,884
The truth was finally going to come out.

43
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,053
Tell my son his wife is cheating on him.

44
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:17,653
Oh, my God!

45
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:22,997
Sadly for Juanita, this was
one dream that would never come true.

[Music filters from headphones]

47
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:13,750
We all honor heroes
for different reasons.

48
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,380
Sometimes for their bravery,

49
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:19,448
sometimes for their daring,

50
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:23,188
sometimes for their goodness.

51
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:29,202
But mostly we honor heroes
because, at one point or another,

52
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,761
we all dream of being rescued.

00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:38,332
[Knock on door]

54
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:41,938
[Mike] Susan, I know you're in there.
We have to talk.

55
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:43,642
This is crazy.

56
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:46,113
I know.

57
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:55,054
Everything the cop said is true.
I did kill somebody.

58
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,962
But there's one thing they didn't
tell you. I killed for you, Susan.

59
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:09,903
Susan, if I can't have you,
no one else can.

60
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,500
Shut up.

[Mike] Susan, are you home?

63
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:29,617
[Knocking] Susan? Your car's here.
I know you're in there.

64
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:34,665
I was hoping we could talk for a minute.

65
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:47,070
Susan, maybe you should have waited
till I left to do that.

66
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:51,676
I know you don't want to see me
right now but I owe you an explanation,

67
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:55,744
and it's all in there, everything
you ever wanted to know about my past,

68
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:57,517
my reasons for doing what I did.

69
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,785

Hey.

72
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:24,143
Guys, come on. What are you doing?

73
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,151
Uh...

74
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,279
You know, just bonding,
discussing current events...

75
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:33,722
Seriously, if you'd just parked across
the street I could have let you go.

76
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:36,421
Why don't you just pretend like we did?

77
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:39,797
Get out of the car.

78
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,531
- Get this.
- Hey, hey...

79
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:44,763
Stop the car! Hey! Hey!

80
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:52,672
I can't believe it. Two months
from graduation and he's expelled.

81
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:56,704
We are just lucky that security guard
did not press charges.

82
00:06:56,783 --> 00:07:01,311
- So what are we going to do?
- Well, I'm glad that you asked.

83
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:10,690
- What are these?
- Brochures for youth detention centers.

84
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:14,195
How long have you had these?

85
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:18,033
They've been in the drawer a few months.
I had a feeling we might need them.

86
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,732
Bree... I don't know.

87
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:22,832
We have to admit that we need help.

88
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:25,878
If we can't get through to Andrew,
we need someone who can.

89
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,573
You want to send our son
away to some prison camp?

90
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:32,414
Don't be so dramatic.
Some of these places actually look fun.

91
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,953
Look. Camp Hennessy.

92
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:37,819
"Teaches kids respect for authority
and boundaries

94
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:43,658
The perimeter is surrounded by
an electrified fence.

95
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:47,927
You have to admit that's an efficient
way to teach respect for boundaries.

96
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,128
OK, how about this one?
It's perfect for Andrew.

97
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:55,732
It's a ranch in Montana. It has lots
of fresh air and plenty of open spaces.

98
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:59,608
- And daily classes on anger management.
- I'm not comfortable with this.

99
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:03,740
All right, how about this one? It's
in the desert and it's very reasonable.

100
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:08,480
The barracks are a little bit bleak
but that recidivism rate is to die for.

101
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:12,115
Bree, I'm not doing it.
I'm not sending my son away.

102
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,584
It's easy for you, isn't it?

103
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,993
You're not the one he's rude to,
the one he challenges every day.

[Sighs] You're not the one he hates.

105
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:23,661
I'll talk to him. All right?

106
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:27,570
I'll sit him down for a little
old-fashioned heart-to-heart.

107
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:30,175
You talk to him all you want.

108
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:33,508
I'm gonna check out
the place with the electrified fence.

And I on the opposite shore will be

Hi, I wanted to introduce myself
to your mom. I'm Lynette Scavo.

Hi, Lynette. I'm Alisa Stevens.

117

Oh, I'm sorry! I thought...

118
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:09,845
- I read lips.
- Oh.

119
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,412
A lot of the time,
signing is just easier.

120

I don't like to misunderstand,
or to be misunderstood.

- Hi, nice to meet you.

[Boy] Hi, Mom!

123
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,625
- That's my son, Matt.
- My twins talk about Matt all the time.

124
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:27,188
- We should set up a play date.
- Sounds great.

125
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:30,030
- Let's have dinner too.
- I'd love to.

126

- [Porter] The British are coming!
- [Preston] Giddy-up! Giddy-up!

00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:37,342
Even better, let's just keep it adults.

128
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,844
Babe, they blinked.

129
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:43,109
- We got 'em by the short hairs.
- Who? Who blinked?

130
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:45,582
The DA. I just spoke with the lawyers.

131
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:48,449
- They offered a plea bargain.
- And that's good?

132
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:52,685
It means they know they got a weak case.
They don't think they can win.

133
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,386
- It's over.
- Oh, my God!

134
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:59,557
- That means we can keep the house!
- No, we still have to sell the house.

135
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:02,965
- I gotta pay the lawyers.
- You said they offered a plea bargain.

136
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:05,128
Yeah, but we're not gonna take that.

137
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,439
Put me down.

138
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:11,408
Honey, it would mean
me going to jail for eight months.

139
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:14,742
I think that's pretty reasonable,
as you're guilty as sin.

140
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:16,679
You were fine with selling.

141
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:20,515
Before I knew we could trade
a couple of months in prison to keep it.

142
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:23,054
What?!

143
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,454
No, this is her daughter-in-law.

144
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:28,755
Is it the hospital? Is it Mama?

145
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:37,700
Uh, thank you. Yes.

146
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:40,896

147
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,703
I'm sorry, Carlos.

148
00:10:57,723 --> 00:11:02,023
[Mary Alice] Some believe people
are judged by the way they live life,

149
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:05,029
and others by the way they leave it.

150
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:08,897
I like the Lexington mahogany
with gold leaf.

151
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:11,459
It has a pink velvet interior
and drapes,

152
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:15,234
plus it's hand-engraved so
in case of a flood or earthquake,

153
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:17,434
they'll at least know which one is hers.

154
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,944
Don't you think
that's a little over the top?

155
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,502
Only the best for Mama.

156
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:25,846
These funeral homes make a fortune
trying to convince people to overspend.

157
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:28,785
- What are you saying?
- Your mother was sensible.

158
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,846
She wouldn't be comfortable
with bells and whistles.

159
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:34,984
Maybe this one. Wood veneer.

160
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:39,393
- What?
- You never liked Mama.

161
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:43,128
It's awfully hard to like someone
who actively hates your guts.

162
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:46,035
She thought you married beneath you
and let me know it.

163
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:49,074
- She loved you.
- She treated me like trash!

164
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:50,438
God rest her soul.

165
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:54,343
I'm putting my mother in the grave.
Now is not the time to pinch pennies.

166
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:57,541
Carlos, we're not exactly
flush with cash right now.

167
00:11:57,616 --> 00:12:01,552
Let her be true to her roots.
She was born humble.

168
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:05,454
- And barefoot.
- She was a queen.

169
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:11,994
What did Mike say
when he gave you the letter?

170
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,658
- That it explains everything.
- Does it?

171
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,497
- I haven't read it.
- Why not?

172
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:20,403
- I just can't.
- I'd have ripped it open with my teeth.

173
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:22,737
Aren't you dying to know what he wrote?

174
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:25,902
Yes. But what if it's just
a bunch of far-fetched stories?

175
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:28,845
- Well, you should assume that it is.
- Why?

176
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,508
Think how good men are
at lying on the spot.

177
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:35,145
God forbid you should
give them time and a pen.

179
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,950
Edie, could you stop by the site?
I've blueprints of the master bath.

180
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:43,051
Oh, I'll see you in a few, Bill.

181
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:52,267
My new contractor.
We're sort of dating.

182
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:55,705
Didn't you once say you never mix
business with pleasure?

183
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:59,370
No, I said never mix pleasure
with commitment.

184
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,912
Right.

185
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:05,144
- What are you gonna do with the letter?
- Would you open it up already?

186
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,818
No. No, I won't.

187
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:13,586
I don't trust Mike any more
and without trust...

188
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:16,924
No, no. I'm just gonna go in
and rip it up and throw it in the trash.

189
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:19,089
- Why don't we rip it up now?
- No, no, no.

190
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:22,498
That's OK. I don't wanna...
you know, litter.

191
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:30,999
She is so opening that letter.

192

[Mary Alice] While Carlos was making
arrangements to bury his mother,

193
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:40,619
Gabrielle was making sure
she'd be taking her secret to the grave.

194
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:43,086
Hi, I'm Gabrielle Solis.

195
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,020
You're Nurse... Hisel?

196
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:48,958
Yes. Hi. Um...
When you said you were coming,

197
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:52,225
I collected all the personal things
your husband brought in

198
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,630
during Juanita's stay with us.

199
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:57,828
I assume that's why you're stopping by?

200
00:13:57,903 --> 00:14:01,839
Oh, that's so thoughtful of you
but, actually, no.

201
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:04,542
No?

202
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,841
No, you see my husband and I
still don't have a clear account

203
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:10,404
as to how Juanita passed.

204
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:12,041
How?

205
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:15,052
Yes, did she die quietly,

206
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,451
in her sleep...?

207
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,616
Um, yeah, that's usually how it happens.

208
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:23,557
I mean, I'm pretty sure
that's how it happened.

209
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,062
Pretty sure?

210
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:29,032
I mean, I don't know exactly
because I wasn't with her at that time.

211
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:30,862
Uh-huh.

212
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:34,303
Was anyone with her?

213
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,831
An orderly, candy striper...

214
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,377
...anyone?

215
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:44,811
No. She was alone.

216
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:50,588
Thank you so much.
That's all I needed to hear.

217
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:55,392
Oh, Mrs. Solis.

218
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:59,358
Oh, you can just toss that.

219
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,608
Great! Just great.

220
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,947
I think this is yours.

221
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:28,591
Yeah. Yeah, I've been looking
for this one. Thanks.

222
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,926
I don't suppose you have
any idea where I found it?

223
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:35,228
Those little suckers
are drawn to bare feet and car tires.

224
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:38,270
Since you're not limping or bleeding...

225
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:43,236
This is only temporary.
You need to get it fixed.

226
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:45,777
- Thanks, I will.
- Seriously, it's not safe.

227
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:48,074
You'll only get
20 or 30 miles out of it.

228
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,081
All right, I promise.

229
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:52,777
Hey, listen.
I'm about to break for lunch.

230
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:55,012
- How would you like to join me?
- Lunch?

231
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:56,952
Yeah, lunch.

232
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,719
Are you asking me out on a date?

233
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:04,251
That sounds kinda formal for a burrito
and a can of soda, but...

234
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,798
...yeah, I guess I am.

235
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:08,492

236
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:10,831
We went out on a date. We're not dating.

237
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:12,598
- Oh.
- So how about it?

238
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:14,104
I'm buying.

239
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:17,438
I just got out of this relationship
with this guy, Mike.

240
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:19,409
It's kind of complicated.

241
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:22,470
Anyway, I'm not sure
where I am right now, emotionally.

242
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:23,879
I'm all jumbled up.

243
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:27,441
I can't leap into something new,
relationship-wise, at the moment.

244
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,987
Again, just a burrito.

245
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,384
- I'm sorry.
- OK, I understand.

246
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,792
Sounds like you need time
to reflect and heal.

247
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:39,296
- I do, I really do.
- OK.

248
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:42,357
I'll check back with you again tomorrow.

249
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:46,666
This is so... delicious.

fingers and cartoon-shaped macaroni.

- Hey, shut up.

- Tom, you're in advertising, right?
- Mm-hm.

256
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:08,825

- We have to talk.
- Yes...

261
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:22,539
It's all over now. They'll be
talking shop for the rest of the night.

262

talking about Lynette too.

We're... in counseling.

- Oh, really? More steak?
- It's her idea.

268
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:45,928
It's not the most pleasant way
to spend an hour.

269
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:49,456
Basically, I look at the clock
and she blames me for everything.

270
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:53,096
I don't think you should be talking
about Alisa with her...

271
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:54,662
...so...

272
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,800
It's OK, it's not like she can hear.

273
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:02,940
Maybe I will have some more
of that, uh, potato stuff.

274
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:07,682
He actually said those things,
with her sitting right there?

275
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:11,416
It was really nasty,
and he wouldn't shut up, either.

276
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,720
I can't believe you said
we'd play tennis.

277
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:16,784
That was before I knew he was a jerk.
She was great.

278
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:18,557
Look what she taught me.

279
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,596
It means "I love you."

280
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:25,466
Yeah, that's great. What am I gonna do?

281
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:29,934
- What do you mean?
- Obviously she needs to be told.

282
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:33,273
No, no, no, she doesn't.
This is between Dennis and Alisa.

into that whole meddling thing you do.

- Excuse me?
- Let me handle it.

Let's avoid a big thing.

Are you saying I can't be tactful?

288
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:49,622
If he says something at tennis,

289
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:52,789
I will take him aside, man to man,
and say, "That's not cool."

- Bill asked me out.

- Bill? My Bill?
- Well, see, that's the thing.

He doesn't think of himself
as your Bill.

He said that date
was just a one-time thing.

Which I know,
because when he asked me out

319

I told him I thought
you guys were involved.

Because I saw him first.

325
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:22,310
That's a really
third-grade thing to say.

326
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:25,748

Are you sure you wanna be... saying
these things in front of your daughter?

506
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:21,330
Now you're telling me
how to raise my daughter?!

507
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:24,831
Lily, we're coming back.

508
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:30,033
Alisa, I am so sorry
if I caused a problem.

509
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:32,269
I just wanted to help.

510
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:34,334
Why? Why did you want to help?

511
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:37,677
- Well, because...
- Oh, because I was deaf?

512
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:41,150
No. Because your husband
was being a total jerk.

513
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:48,624
And you've just gotta come in on your
white horse and come to the rescue.

514
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:52,629
Well, guess what?
I didn't need to be rescued. Got that?

515
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,961
I didn't need to be rescued.

516
00:34:00,905 --> 00:34:02,463
Bitch.

517
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:05,836
Uh, she said...

518
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:08,105
Yes, thank you.
I know what she just said.

519
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:14,881
One minute we're making out
in his truck and next thing I know,

520
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:18,615
we're at the hospital and the doctor's
digging a bullet out of him.

521
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:22,318
When I started dating Mike, he seemed
like such a normal guy, you know?

522
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:25,590
They always do.
You wanna get some nachos?

523
00:34:25,663 --> 00:34:28,257
Obviously,
I am not going to read the letter.

524
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:30,960
At some point,
you've just gotta let it go, right?

525
00:34:31,035 --> 00:34:32,093
Right.

526
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:35,628
Mind if we leave off the jalapenos?
I'm not good with spicy things.

527
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:38,038
I don't mean to babble.
It's complicated.

528
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:41,875
And there is so much about Mike
you don't even know.

529
00:34:41,946 --> 00:34:45,006
That would surprise me at this point.

530
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:48,912
Edie.

531
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:51,648
Your foreman said you were
on a date with a hottie.

532
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:53,713
Evidently, someone needs Lasik.

533
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:57,659
- You tracked us down?
- It wasn't hard.

534
00:34:57,728 --> 00:35:00,925
I just followed the stench of betrayal.

535
00:35:00,998 --> 00:35:03,796
- We had an agreement, Susan.
- No, we didn't.

536
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:07,133
I said what you wanted to hear
because you guilted me into it.

537
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:10,538
I was trying to protect
our already fragile friendship.

538
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:13,372
- Am I in the middle of something here?
- Not any more.

539
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:17,073
You, I will hate forever.

540
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:19,116
And you are fired.

541
00:35:19,183 --> 00:35:20,207
Edie!

542
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,718
You're firing me
for going out with Susan?

543
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:27,724
Yes. And before you start whining
that dating her is punishment enough,

544
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,056
save it.

545
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:39,761
I suppose I could tell her
you threw yourself at me.

546
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:42,772
You were Ionely, begged to have dinner.
I took pity on you.

547
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:47,834
Well, excuse me, but that kinda
makes it sound like it was my fault.

548
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:51,348
You can't possibly blame me.
I'm not the one who fired you.

549
00:35:51,415 --> 00:35:55,784
You just chose not to tell me Edie would
be insanely mad if I went out with you.

550
00:35:55,853 --> 00:35:59,584
- Slow down. You're driving too fast.
- This is between you and Edie.

551
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,488
I just got sucked into the drama.

552
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:05,120
- Yeah. I bet you say that all the time.
- What does that mean?

553
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:08,029
You didn't get sucked into the drama.
You invited it in.

554
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:09,361
That's not true.

555
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:12,596
You've spent an hour
obsessing over your ex-boyfriend,

556
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:16,470
even though he's an ex-con who
very possibly strangled your neighbor.

557
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:17,667
No, he didn't.

558
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:21,542
And Edie told you not to go out with me,
but did you listen? No.

559
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:25,343
You saw the potential for disaster
and couldn't resist getting in there.

560
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:29,682
OK, Mr-let's-just-have-fun-
because-I'm-the-casual-contractor-man,

561
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:32,052
you chased me, so own it, my friend.

562
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:33,818
[Ioud bang, screech of brakes]

563
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:35,358
Oh!

564
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:52,868
You didn't get that tire fixed,
did you?

565
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,108
I was meaning to.

566
00:36:57,548 --> 00:37:01,177
[Sigh] I guess I do invite the drama in.

567
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:03,345
Just a little.

568
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:11,388
[TV] Stocks closed up yesterday,
with investor...

569
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:14,659
Tom, am I a bad person?

570
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:21,196
No. Why would you say that?

571
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:23,968
I don't know. I guess
I just have it in my head

572
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:28,774
that only bad people break up marriages
and offend the handicapped.

573
00:37:28,846 --> 00:37:32,247
- I did try to warn you.
- You did.

574
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:34,807
Why do I do it?

575
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:38,685
This compulsion to stick my nose
where it doesn't belong.

576
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:42,021
Honey, you were just
looking out for your friend.

577
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,391
A lot of good it did her.

578
00:37:44,462 --> 00:37:47,659
At least you tried.
I admire you for that.

579
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:49,222
Oh, please.

580
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,565
Hey, I'm the guy
who let Dennis bad-mouth his wife

581
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:54,832
because I was afraid of making a scene.

582
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:57,305
You knew it was wrong
and you let him have it.

583
00:37:57,375 --> 00:38:00,936
That's me.
I'm never afraid to create a scene.

584
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:04,038
Hey, honey, look. My point is,

585
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:08,745
you have a strong sense of what is right
and you're not afraid to act on it.

586
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:11,287
And I admire you for that.

587
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:13,755
You know what I admire you for?

588
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:21,420
You find a way to compliment me
when you could say, "I told you so."

589
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:31,906
You just signed "I told you so,"
didn't you?

590
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,911
You'll never prove it.

591
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:43,419
Thanks for coming in, Mrs. Solis.
I believe you've met Nurse Hisel?

592
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:46,183
Yes. Hello. Again.

593
00:38:47,591 --> 00:38:51,186
Nurse Hisel became quite attached
to your mother-in-law.

594
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:53,730
That's why I asked her
to be here for this.

595
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:55,823
First, I want you to understand that

596
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,926
we consider our commitment
to our patients a sacred trust.

597
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,698
[Sobs]

598
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:03,996
OK.

599
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:09,445
Having said that, it appears
that there may, and I stress may,

600
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:12,971
have been a breakdown
in our chain of care.

601
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:17,419
I can assure you we hold our staff to
the highest standards in the industry.

602
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:19,922
But we are only human after all.

603
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:22,015
[Wailing]

604
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:24,357
Honey, are you OK?

605
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:27,363
Nurse Hisel, why don't you step out?

606
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,126
- I'm so sorry.
- Uh-huh.

607
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:34,296
[She continues weeping]

608
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:40,143
We all share in your grief.

609
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:42,974
Apparently.

610
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:46,073
And we're hoping
to alleviate any further pain

611
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:50,814
your family may suffer
by offering some...

612
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:53,083
...monetary compensation.

613
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:59,626
Provided you and your husband waive any
future right to litigation, of course.

614
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:04,691
Monetary compensation?
You're trying to buy us off?

615
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:08,034
Let's not get tangled up in legalese.

616
00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:12,064
We like to think of it
as an extension of our caring.

617
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:17,706
Well, in that case, care away.

618
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:25,549
[Gabrielle] Mr. Hartley, I have
a hypothetical legal question for you.

619
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:29,684
I like to play the lottery and I...

620
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:35,528
Yes, I know what the odds are
but I just love those scratch-offs.

621
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,363
Say I were to win, I don't know,

622
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:42,338
a million, six hundred thousand dollars.

623
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:48,208
Would the government be able to take it
like they took everything else?

624
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:53,778
That's what I thought. The bastards.

625
00:40:55,586 --> 00:41:00,182
So what if we won the lottery
after Carlos went to jail?

626
00:41:00,257 --> 00:41:03,693
Could the government
touch the money then? Hypothetically.

627
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:06,857
I see.

628
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:09,092
And we could keep the house.

629
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:19,907
Oh, no, I'm just at the grocery store,
wondering if I should buy a ticket.

630
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:22,810
Thanks a bunch, Mr. Hartley.

631
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,646
So what time should I bring Carlos
to the DA's office tomorrow?

632
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:29,050
Great.

633
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:38,727
[Mary Alice] We all honor heroes
for different reasons.

634
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:42,129
Sometimes for their daring.

635
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:50,870
Sometimes for their bravery.

636
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:57,913
Sometimes for their goodness.

637
00:41:57,982 --> 00:42:00,883
I love you.

638
00:42:06,156 --> 00:42:09,455
But mostly, we honor heroes

639
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:14,121
because at one point or another,

640
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:18,032
we all dream of being rescued.

641
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:26,242
Of course,

642
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:29,973
if the right hero doesn't come along,

643
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:34,950
sometimes,
we just have to rescue ourselves.
