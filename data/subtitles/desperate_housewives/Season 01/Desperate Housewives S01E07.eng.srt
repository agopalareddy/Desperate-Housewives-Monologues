<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>

2
00:00:01,034 --> 00:00:05,061
- Previously on Desperate Housewives...
- What is it you hired me to do?

3
00:00:05,138 --> 00:00:07,606
Someone sent that to my wife.
I need to know who.

4
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,335
Some secrets were discovered.

5
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:12,674
After Mom died, I started remembering
what happened to Dana.

6
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:14,179
- Dana?
- What are you doing?

7
00:00:14,247 --> 00:00:15,976
Some secrets were uncovered.

8
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:18,415
Could be anyone
she's having an affair with.

9
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:21,181
Don't worry.
I'm not letting her out of my sight.

10
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:25,213
- And some secrets...
- Jordana Geist gets her work done.

11
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,555
- How do you cram it all in?
...were shared.

12
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:29,754
That's ADD medication.

13
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:39,072
Competition. It means different things
to different people.

14
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:41,472
Competition. It means different things
to different people.

15
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:45,307
In suburbia,
it means keping up with the Joneses.

16
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:50,680
On Wisteria Lane, that means
keping up with Bre Van De Kamp.

17
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,846
Everyone knew Bre had
the nicest lawn in the neighborhood.

18
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:56,912
And no one begrudged her this.

19
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:01,927
No one, that is, except Martha Huber,

20
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:05,954
whose own lawn paled in comparison.

21
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:09,331
No matter how carefully she trimmed,

22
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:12,462
or how lovingly she watered...

23
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:17,809
or how generously she fertilized,

24
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:23,179
the grass was always grener
on the other side of the fence.

25
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:30,320
Hello, Victor. How are you today?

26
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,791
- Out jogging again?
- I can't... catch my breath.

27
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:37,261
Would you like a slurp from my hose?

28
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:40,699
[Groans]

29
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:45,003
Victor?

30
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:47,369
Victor?

31
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,932
Don't worry.
I'm gonna get an ambulance.

32
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:59,875
Then one day, Mrs. Huber finally got
the chance to mow down the competition.

33
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:16,661
Help! Somebody help!

34
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:21,835
[Gasps] What happened?

35
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:25,503
He collapsed on your hydrangeas.
Call 911!

36
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:30,316
[Radio chatter]

37
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:30,577
[Radio chatter]

38
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:46,365
Yes, Mrs. Huber understood
the first rule of competition:

39
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:51,233
In order to win,
you have to want it more.

40
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:37,342
When I was alive, my friends and I
came together once a month

41
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:40,318
for a meting
of the Wisteria Lane Book Club.

42
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:44,550
We found the problems
of literary characters so absorbing.

43
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,450
The way they dealt with adversity,

44
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:52,259
conducted illicit affairs,

45
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:55,096
endured domestic dramas,

46
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:59,029
and planned romantic conquests.

47
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:04,509
But since my death, my friends
had lost their interest in fiction.

48
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,373
So, what did everybody think?

49
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:11,417
Their own problems
had become absorbing enough.

50
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:15,352
I thought the character
of Madame Bovary was very inspirational.

51
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:16,445
[Baby gurgles]

52
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:20,720
Inspirational? [scoffs]
She poisons herself with arsenic.

53
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:24,024
- [Lynette] Really?
- You didn't read until the end?

54
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:27,032
[Lynette] I stopped after page 50.

55
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,592
- Am I the only one who read the book?
- I saw the movie. It was good.

56
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:35,039
Ladies, I'm sorry, but
what is the point of having a book club

57
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,008
if we don't read the book?

58
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:39,670
- More wine?
- [Murmured assent]

59
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:45,776
Sue, Reba, Emma and Lori, would you
girls come and help me with the snacks?

60
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:48,912
Sure.

61
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:52,754
I will be right in.

62
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:56,056
God, I couldn't wait to get rid of them!

63
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,825
OK, so Lynette said
that you found Zach.

64
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:02,800
He's at a rehabilitation center.
Julie snuck in and talked to him.

65
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:04,996
Did he talk about his mother's suicide?

66
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:08,131
There wasn't time. He said
one thing that was mysterious.

67
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:10,937
He said something happened
to someone named Dana

68
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,103
and that he could never talk about it.

69
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:15,113
- Who's Dana?
- That's the mystery.

70
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:19,117
I figure Dana has something to do
with what Mary Alice was trying to hide.

71
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:21,483
Somebody found out
Mary Alice's secret...

72
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:25,251
- And sent the note.
- So who the hell is that?

73
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:31,795
Stationery is Parcher No.17.
100% cotton.

74
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:34,628
It's made by Cyprus Office Products.

75
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:37,932
They have stores in 12 cities,
including yours.

76
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,905
We traced that postmark
back to your local post office.

77
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:43,203
Meaning?

78
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:45,972
The blackmailer's probably
someone you know.

79
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:50,982
A neighbor, milkman,
pool boy, soccer mom.

80
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,712
Soccer mom?

81
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:56,914
Mr. Young,
sometimes evil drives a minivan.

82
00:05:58,458 --> 00:05:59,755
I had this gig once,

83
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:03,660
checking on this PTA mom who was
hell-bent on landing her daughter

84
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,756
a spot on the parade float.

85
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:10,769
She fed antifreeze
to half the homecoming committee.

86
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:16,699
- Did you catch her?
- Mr. Young...

87
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:21,704
The people who hired me
didn't hire me to catch her.

88
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,848
Wow, honey!
This place looks spotless.

89
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:32,481
Thanks.

90
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:38,190
So I have come up with this killer idea
for the Spotless Scrub campaign.

91
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:41,995
- Great. Want to run it by me?
- No. I'm good.

92
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:45,060
- But thanks.
- Oh. OK. [laughs]

93
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:48,174
You know how whenever I pitch
Hennessey always tears my ideas down?

94
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:50,108
You know how whenever I pitch
Hennessey always tears my ideas down?

95
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:54,875
I invited the partners and their wives
over so I could pitch to them here.

96
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:57,882
I thought we could make
a formal dinner for six...

97
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,510
When exactly would this take place?

98
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:03,384
- Ah, the day after tomorrow.
- Tom!

99
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:05,822
- I know it's short notice.
- You think?

100
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:08,690
How can I pull off a formal dinner
with no warning?

101
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:12,026
Bree Van De Kamp
does this kind of thing all the time.

102
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:17,001
- What did you say?
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that.

103
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:20,505
Forget it. I'll call and cancel.
Just don't worry about it.

104
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:23,440
No. No, let's do it.

105
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:27,074
Really?

106
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:30,912
Yeah. It's good for your career.
I'll pull it off.

107
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:33,747
Yes! Honey, thank you.

108
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:38,450
I promise, I land this account and I am
gonna buy you something awful pretty.

109
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:46,326
Luckily for Tom,
Lynette had a recipe for success.

110
00:07:53,773 --> 00:08:00,679
Unfortunately for her,
she was missing the secret ingredient.

111
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:02,839
[Lawnmower]

112
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:10,814
[Mobile phone rings]

113
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,289
- Yeah.
- It's me.

114
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,555
Don't! My mother-in-law can see you.

115
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:20,395
- I hate that she's watching us.
- Meet me at the motel in an hour.

116
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:26,131
- John?
- Uh... I've got plans.

117
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:27,331
So cancel.

118
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:31,069
[Sighs] They're with Danielle.
We're going to the movies.

119
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:34,010
- That sounds like a date.
- Yeah.

120
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,776
Well, I have a problem
with you seeing other girls.

121
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:42,185
I have a problem with you having a
husband. We both have to learn to deal.

122
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,767
[Mobile phone rings]

123
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:09,604
Don't even try to make it up to me
by talking dirty.

124
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:11,912
Hello?

125
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:33,562
Mr. And Mrs. Van De Kamp.

126
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:37,370
So, your son decided to entertain
some of his friends yesterday

127
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:39,809
by shoving a freshman's head
into a locker.

128
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,871
- The Johnson boy?
- Yes. He broke the boy's nose.

129
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:46,043
Because of our no tolerance policy,
he may face expulsion.

130
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:48,780
You're gonna ruin his future
over roughhousing?

131
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:51,220
Rex, this was practically assault.

132
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:54,384
Mrs. Stark,
what Andrew did was clearly wrong.

133
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,918
But his mother and I are going
through severe marital problems.

134
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:00,932
- Is that relevant?
- Our marriage is disintegrating.

135
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,867
Of course Andrew is acting out.
He's angry.

136
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:08,202
If he's angry about you moving out,
he should shove your head into a locker.

137
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:12,142
All I'm saying is we need to take
some of the responsibility here.

138
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:15,408
So does Andrew.
Blaming his actions on our problems,

139
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:17,711
which are not serious,
does not help him.

140
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:21,981
- Our problems are serious.
- Handle this however you see fit.

141
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:24,113
Bree, I've gone to an attorney.

142
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,785
You're gonna be served
with divorce papers later today.

143
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,328
- You went to an attorney?
- Yeah.

144
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:33,559
And a good one, too.

145
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:38,696
He'd better be, 'cause when I'm finished
with you, you won't have a cent.

146
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:40,898
Bring it on.

147
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,806
Perhaps detention is the way to go.

148
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:46,104
Mom, you're getting too dressed up.

149
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:48,874
I know, but I wanna look really sexy.

150
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:51,508
I told Mike I expect him
to have you home by 11:00.

151
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:54,610
- Hm. How about midnight?
- All right, but no later.

152
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:58,418
You know how I worry.
So, you got protection?

153
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:02,621
Oh, my God!
We are so not having this conversation.

154
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:05,687
We are, because I enjoy
being an only child.

155
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:08,893
- Are you finished?
- Almost.

156
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:12,768
I always assumed I'd have sex for
the first time before you had it again.

157
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,398
OK, you can leave now.

158
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:22,479
What do you think? Trying too hard?

159
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:26,712
What do you know? It's 80 degrees
outside and you're wearing fur.

160
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:29,687
- [Dog whimpers]
- [Knock on door]

161
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:39,496
Hiya, Mike.

162
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:55,409
Hey, Edie.

163
00:11:56,382 --> 00:12:00,876
Wow! Get a load of you!
You look so pretty!

164
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:04,480
- I hardly recognize you.
- Oh, this? [laughs]

165
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:08,789
Well, I have a date.
Right now. With Mike.

166
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:13,592
We kissed, F.Y.I.

167
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,138
Ooh, love that jacket. Good choice.

168
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:28,908
Um, Susan, I am really sorry,
but I've got to cancel.

169
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:33,418
I have an unexpected house guest.

170
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:36,455
Coming through. Ooh, sorry.
Hi. I'm Kendra.

171
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:40,720
- Susan.
- I'm gonna get my stuff.

172
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:48,024
I know how this looks,
but there's nothing between us.

173
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,864
- Kendra's just an old friend.
- Old friend.

174
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,700
- Yeah, you know...
- Yeah, yeah.

175
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,638
No, actually, no, I don't know.

176
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:59,872
By old friend you mean college pal?
Saved you from drowning?

177
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:03,244
- It's hard to explain.
- Could you give it a shot?

178
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:09,077
Mike, I'm gonna go upstairs
and take a shower.

179
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:14,958
Look, I promise
I'll make this up to you.

180
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:22,024
- And... you look amazing.
- [Kendra] Mike! Where are the towels?

181
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:26,801
Thanks.

182
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:34,678
Hey. How was your big date?

183
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:37,806
Mike had to reschedule.

184
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:40,283
Oh. Because of the hot girl?

185
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:43,321
With the suitcase? Over there?

186
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,887
Gosh, how devastating for you... F.Y.I.

187
00:13:56,635 --> 00:14:00,196
I just want to move this place fast.
I'll do whatever we have to do.

188
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:02,297
That's good to know.

189
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:06,538
You'll have to disclose the fact that
your wife killed herself in the house.

190
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:10,514
- I will?
- Oh, yeah. Legal crap.

191
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,882
People get really freaked out
by suicides.

192
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:17,980
You can't blame them. Hell.
I get the willies just standing here.

193
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,925
- Is there any way to get around it?
- Off the record?

194
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:24,189
Yeah.

195
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:27,164
You could say that she shot herself
in the living room

196
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,827
and then crawled out back to die.

197
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:33,532
I'm just saying.

198
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:37,466
Oh, I gotta go. I'll call you tomorrow.

199
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:46,213
Edie, wait!

200
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:57,354
Paul had always known

201
00:14:57,429 --> 00:15:01,297
Edie Britt was capable
of doing anything to close a deal.

202
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:08,639
But now he realized
she was capable of so much more.

203
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:13,736
- Hey, Danielle.
- Hey, Mrs. Solis.

204
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:20,415
Oh, Danielle, remember
when you said you wanted to be a model?

205
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:22,477
You remember? That was last summer.

206
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:26,456
Perchik Modeling Academy has
an opening for their summer program.

207
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:31,019
- Would you like me to sponsor you?
- That's one of the best schools.

208
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,360
- You would do that for me?
- I sure would.

209
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,525
I would so love to go to New York.

210
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:39,401
Oh, and I would so love
to help you get there.

211
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:44,332
[Children talking and laughing]

212
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:50,547
- Hey, Jordana.
- Hey, Lynette. How are you?

213
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:54,981
You look a little tired.
Is everything OK?

214
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:58,319
I'm getting ready for
a dinner party tomorrow. Six people.

215
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,620
- Sounds fun.
- Big fun.

216
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:04,390
You wouldn't have any of your kids'
ADD medication you could spare,

217
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:09,457
- just to get me over the hump?
- Tina! Don't push your sister.

218
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:14,233
Gosh, Lynette...
I'm really running low.

219
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,399
I need all my energy I can get.

220
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:20,206
My sister Elaine and her kids
are flying into town for a week.

221
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:23,942
That's exciting.
I wish my sister would visit more often.

222
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:26,484
Yeah, sisters are great.

223
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:28,918
Three or four pills.
I'm hitting the wall.

224
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:33,254
Yeah, the comedown can be a real bitch.
I wish I could help.

225
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:39,625
- I'm not gonna forget about this.
- What's that supposed to mean?

226
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:42,963
Come Girl Scout cookie time,
don't bring around little Tina

227
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:45,265
because we won't be home.

228
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:53,303
What's all this about?

229
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:57,406
You know your mother and I
have been unhappy for a while.

230
00:16:57,483 --> 00:17:01,715
We've decided that it would be better
if we got divorced.

231
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:04,153
But whatever problems we have,

232
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:07,420
it doesn't change the fact
that we love you very, very much.

233
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:11,752
- I've got a question.
- Go ahead. Ask whatever you want.

234
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:14,822
Can I live with Dad?

235
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,960
Come on, Mom, let's face it.
We drive each other crazy.

236
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:28,403
Danielle, would you prefer
to live with your father?

237
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,506
I don't really care,
as long as I have my own bathroom.

238
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:41,287
Um... all this, um... wine is, uh...
giving me a... headache.

239
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:58,567
Six weeks in the suburban jungle,
and this is all you got?

240
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:01,545
There are over 300 families
in this subdivision.

241
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:03,740
It'll take time to check 'em all out.

242
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:07,843
- Dad said you were ready to quit.
- I changed my mind.

243
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,788
This is a gigantic waste
of your time and my father's money.

244
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:14,257
Are you afraid
he'll spend your inheritance?

245
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:16,817
That's not funny.

246
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:20,331
- Mike, here's the thing.
- What?

247
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,267
Dad can't chase ghosts alone.

248
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:25,895
If you stop,
he'll have to accept it's over.

249
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:28,439
Let me have my father back.

250
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:30,771
If I quit he'll just hire somebody else.

251
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:34,609
Not if you tell him
there's nothing here to find.

252
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,444
I can't do that.

253
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:43,411
What happens when
your girlfriend finds out

254
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:46,754
you're not just the sweet,
neighborly plumber?

255
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:53,020
You're lying to her, Mike.

256
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,400
Oh, here it is.

257
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,168
Great.
This'll keep the crab dip warm.

258
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:05,676
It took forever
to shell the little buggers.

259
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:08,770
You shelled your own crabs?

260
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:11,816
Are you doing too much?
'Cause you look exhausted.

261
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:16,287
I'm fine. I just need some coffee.
Thank you.

262
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:21,018
Oh, my God! Look at this embroidery!

263
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:26,863
"Dana." Where did this come from?

264
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:29,196
Paul Young's garage sale.

265
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:35,533
Dana.

266
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:41,112
Dana was a baby.

267
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,212
Surprise.

268
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:54,692
- No way!
- It's all yours. Here are the keys.

269
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,560
- Rex, what's this about?
- I went and splurged a little.

270
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:02,088
Oh, Danielle, here's your present.

271
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:03,600
- Luggage?
- Yeah.

272
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:07,332
It's to take to the Perchik Modeling
Academy. I'm footing the bill.

273
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:09,931
- I can go to New York?
- Wait a minute.

274
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:14,172
- What's this about a modeling academy?
- Mrs. Solis is sponsoring me.

275
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:16,271
When were you planning on telling me?

276
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:18,373
I think it's a great idea.

277
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:22,682
Don't you two see what he's doing?
He's trying to buy your love.

278
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:25,018
For God's sake. Don't be paranoid.

279
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,285
A car? A modeling academy?

280
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:31,625
You should have discussed these gifts
with me first. We cannot accept them.

281
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:34,097
You can't let her do this.

282
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,964
We just told the kids
we're getting divorced.

283
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:40,266
- It's time to spoil them a little.
- I said no.

284
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:45,208
You know what? They're my kids too,
and I can give them anything I want.

285
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,435
There you go.

286
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:48,945
- Thank you, Daddy.
- Yes.

287
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:54,678
[Danielle squeals]

288
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,168
Did you offer to help Danielle
get into modeling school?

289
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:21,371
What? Uh... yes... No.

290
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,005
Um... Is that how she heard it?

291
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:28,075
Yes. Gabrielle, did you
or did you not offer to sponsor her?

292
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,821
- I just wanted to help out.
- It's in New York!

293
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,824
Why would you suggest that?

294
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,794
It's her dream.
Don't you want her to be happy?

295
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:43,096
No. And I would appreciate you keeping
your ridiculous ideas to yourself.

296
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,933
Bree!

297
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:49,434
[Sighs]

298
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:56,048
John.

299
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:58,006
John!

300
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:01,052
You're so jealous of Danielle
you tried to ship her off?

301
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:04,452
I'm not jealous.
I just don't like to share.

302
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:07,754
Well, you know what? I quit.
The yard. Us. Everything.

303
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,885
Oh, don't be that way.

304
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:13,590
What's the point, if we can never
be together? An hour here and there.

305
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:20,198
I don't want us to end on a bad note.
Carlos has this black tie thing...

306
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:23,264
- Mrs. Solis!
- John, please.

307
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:28,602
What we had was so special.

308
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:32,377
I think it deserves a proper goodbye.

309
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:35,284
We'd, um... We'd still be over, though.

310
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:38,255
Of course.

311
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:49,258
[Shouting]

312
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:54,837
- I knew this was a good idea.
- Thank you for suggesting it.

313
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:57,773
Your boys are the only ones
who could tire out Timmy.

314
00:22:57,843 --> 00:23:00,107
[Shouting]

315
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:03,636
- Yep, he's a feisty one.
- [Laughs]

316
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:06,411
Word on the street is,
um, you medicate Timmy.

317
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:08,885
Oh, yeah. For his ADD.

318
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:13,982
- The pills have been a godsend.
- I bet. [laughs]

319
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:17,484
Can I use your bathroom?

320
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:40,178
As Lynette swallowed the stolen
medication of an eight-year-old child,

321
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:43,710
she vowed she'd never again
sink to such depths.

322
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:50,218
Any time soon.

323
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,463
Looks like you've got your blackmailer.

324
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:08,408
- Is it time to bring in the police?
- That's not really an option for me.

325
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,539
Hm.

326
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:16,347
Before my wife shot herself,
we lived a life that I was proud of.

327
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:20,482
We loved each other.
We had values. We went to church.

328
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,585
We gave to charity.
We were good people, Mr. Shaw.

329
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:25,857
Oh, I believe you.

330
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:32,399
That's why it's so incomprehensible
that Edie Britt would try to destroy us.

331
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:36,066
Well, you've suffered a great loss.

332
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:39,804
For your pain to heal,
that's gonna take some time.

333
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:43,705
I can't wait.

334
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:46,546
I need help now.

335
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:53,824
For five grand she's hurt,
ten grand she's gone.

336
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:16,142
- Mom, what's going on?
- Oh, I'm throwing you out.

337
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:18,478
I've separated all your things.

338
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:21,815
This side is yours, Danielle,
and the other one is Andrew's.

339
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:25,789
- [Sniggers] OK, you've lost it.
- Where are we supposed to live?

340
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:30,954
I don't know. Everything in the north
quadrant of yours is clothes and books.

341
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,725
The south side are miscellaneous items.

342
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:36,665
Mom, this isn't gonna work.
I'm not giving up my car.

343
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:39,966
That's smart. You'll probably
have to sleep in it for a while.

344
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:44,501
You can't stop us
from going inside the house.

345
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:49,741
No? That's Mr. Conlin, the locksmith.
He's been very helpful today.

346
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:53,875
I could give you the new keys
if you'd adhere to my rules,

347
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:57,945
which include
giving back your father's gifts.

348
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:05,786
OK, fine. You win.
I won't go to New York.

349
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:12,929
I'm outta here.

350
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:15,773
[Sighs]

351
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:21,203
Oh, hello. Welcome. I'm Edie.
How do you do?

352
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,510
An open house in the suburbs?
This is beyond kitsch.

353
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:28,075
This is one of the houses
I've had a hard time getting into.

354
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:30,519
God, I wish you would let this go.

355
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:34,355
I'm taking you out tonight.
There's this cowboy bar you need to see.

356
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,450
Why?

357
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:38,621
It's the last place
anybody ever saw your sister.

358
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:45,428
Susan. What brings you here?

359
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:48,904
I just wanted to say goodbye
to Mary Alice's house

360
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:51,807
- before somebody else moved in.
- Aw.

361
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:54,902
That sounds almost plausible.

362
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,574
- I beg your pardon?
- Oh, come on.

363
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,252
We both know why you're here.

364
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:04,322
And the answer is yes,
they are having sex. No question.

365
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:05,846
And the answer is yes,
they are having sex. No question.

366
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:09,655
- They're just friends.
- Hm. Think so?

367
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:14,427
They're going to the Saddle Ranch
tonight for drinks and dancing.

368
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:17,831
Friends can do that.

369
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:21,668
Oh, my God,
I just want to slap and shake you.

370
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:29,773
Where did you say
they were going tonight?

371
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:33,147
[# Country music]

372
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:41,522
Why did I let you
talk me into coming here?

373
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:44,460
There is obviously
nothing going on between them.

374
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:47,123
- Where are you going?
- To the bathroom then home.

375
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:50,326
- I don't want Mike to catch me.
- It's only been ten minutes.

376
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:52,996
She could be waiting
to make her move.

377
00:27:55,974 --> 00:27:59,205
You're not gonna beat a girl like that
by knocking off early.

378
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:03,179
- It's not a competition.
- The hell it isn't.

379
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:05,978
Good night, Edie.

380
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:11,546
Suit yourself. But for the record...
I was rooting for you to land him.

381
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:14,592
And why would you root for me?

382
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:18,686
I figured it'd be easier for me
to steal Mike from you than her.

383
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:21,527
She seems like fun.

384
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:27,702
- Just take some antacid.
- It's not those kind of cramps.

385
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:32,402
This is a business dinner.
It's important.

386
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:35,446
- [Moans]
- Relax.

387
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:39,108
You and I can go alone.
Gabrielle can stay here and get better.

388
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:45,045
- Fine. See you in a couple of hours.
- OK.

389
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:50,558
- Take good care of Carlos.
- Oh, I always do.

390
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:57,593
[Whooping and cheering]

391
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:01,605
- [Woman] Yee-hah!
- [Man] Go, Edie!

392
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:10,542
Woo-hoo!

393
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:15,075
Oh, God.

394
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:25,292
Mike!

395
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:27,729
What a small, small world.

396
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:30,825
Yeah, it sure is.
I caught Edie hiding in the back.

397
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:32,665
No kidding. Is she here?

398
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:41,201
Yeah. Yeah, she said, "The jig is up,"
and then she went to ride the bull.

399
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,476
- And she said you two came together.
- Oh, well, yeah.

400
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:47,541
We did. I just thought she left.

401
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,917
- Were you following me?
- What?

402
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:54,821
No! No, I just came here,
you know, with Edie.

403
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:57,987
We just love to ride that bull.

404
00:29:58,062 --> 00:30:02,089
- You? Ride the bull?
- Yeah. Yeah, it's a real rush.

405
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:04,692
Come on, Susan. Give me a break.

406
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:07,465
You give me a break.
I did not follow you here.

407
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:11,202
Even if I did, it's just because
you've been secretive about Kendra.

408
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:14,404
- Kendra and I are friends.
- And I came here to ride the bull.

409
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:18,609
Whoo! We got another one
to ride the bull!

410
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:27,214
OK, little doggie, you're up.

411
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:30,261
Oh, fun. I'm a doggie.

412
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:52,211
Oh, yeah. I'm here to ride this bull.

413
00:30:53,818 --> 00:30:56,082
Check it out. Whoo!

414
00:30:57,155 --> 00:30:59,589
Yeah! Whoo!

415
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:02,524
Baby! Whoo!

416
00:31:12,737 --> 00:31:16,264
Andrew, you promised
you'd stay with your mother.

417
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:19,902
Dad, she wants me out.
She put all my stuff on the front lawn.

418
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:23,641
This is ridiculous. I'm gonna call her
and smooth all this out.

419
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:26,081
- You're going home.
- Dad, why?

420
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:28,209
Now I can live with you without guilt.

421
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:30,811
It'll be like
our own little bachelor pad.

422
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:36,955
- What?
- Son, that's not gonna happen.

423
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:40,156
- Why not?
- Andrew...

424
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:45,134
These last few months
have been incredibly difficult for me.

425
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:47,797
There are things I've got to work out

426
00:31:47,872 --> 00:31:51,069
and I can't do it
if you're living with me. I'm sorry.

427
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:55,574
I don't care. I'm not going back there.

428
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:58,707
- I don't think you have a choice.
- But, Dad...

429
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:00,114
Uh-uh.

430
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:09,458
Oh, come on now. Don't...

431
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:18,429
Heath? Yeah, it's me.

432
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:21,336
Do you still have your fake ID?

433
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:25,706
I've got to go home and kiss my mother's
ass and I'm not going to do it sober.

434
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:28,778
[Forced laugh]

435
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:36,648
- [Man]... more than I needed to know.
- [Laughter]

436
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:39,053
He was in shock. He was totally shocked.

437
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:43,492
He said, "Congressman, this was
not the vote. You voted already."

438
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:46,462
- [Man] That's what it was.
- [Woman] I love that one!

439
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:49,459
Oh, the desserts look wonderful.

440
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:53,569
- Do you need any help?
- I got it covered. No problem.

441
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:57,574
OK, Scavo. You're up.
Let's hear this genius idea of yours.

442
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:00,406
OK. Uh...

443
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:03,980
OK.

444
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:08,246
The single greatest obstacle facing
Spotless Scrub is a lack of visibility.

445
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,378
We need to concentrate ad spending

446
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:13,788
in places where women spend
the majority of their time.

447
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:17,487
For example, large chain grocery stores.

448
00:33:17,562 --> 00:33:22,795
Picture Spotless Scrub ads on the
side of every mother's shopping cart.

449
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:26,335
- Interesting.
- You know what'd be better?

450
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:28,565
- Dry-cleaning bags.
- What?

451
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,300
No, hear me out.

452
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:33,606
Put a big ad between
a woman and her cashmere sweater.

453
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:37,375
- You'll get her attention.
- I'm in the middle of a thing here.

454
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:39,439
Oh!

455
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:43,248
She's got a point. I would notice that.

456
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:46,313
And those dry-cleaning bags
hang in our closets forever.

457
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:50,452
- So it is like constant advertising.
- Exactly!

458
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:55,090
- Maybe we can work that in...
- This is a fantastic idea.

459
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:59,227
- Can we go nationwide with this?
- Start by targeting the top chain.

460
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:03,000
Then branch out from there.
Boom, boom, boom. Mass saturation.

461
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:05,133
And you know what else would be great?

462
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:08,440
While Lynette was commanding
everyone's attention...

463
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:13,943
Susan was trying to remain
inconspicuous.

464
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:16,316
Everybody's looking at me, aren't they?

465
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,617
Just the slapstick fans.

466
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:22,386
Oh, God, why couldn't I have
just been knocked unconscious?

467
00:34:24,028 --> 00:34:26,588
- Beer?
- Absolutely.

468
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:30,266
Oh.

469
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:33,701
Ow! Ow, ow.

470
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:40,136
- Susan, this is Kendra.
- We've been introduced.

471
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:42,406
No. We've been friends for years.

472
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,448
She's here on a visit.

473
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:47,075
- That's it.
- It's true.

474
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:49,642
I have no designs
on this man whatsoever.

475
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:53,623
I'll be right back.

476
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:58,589
- Sorry about the misunderstanding.
- Me, too.

477
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:01,154
So how long have you two
been seeing each other?

478
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:04,360
Well, you sort of interrupted
our first date.

479
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:07,529
But up until then,
smoking-hot tension.

480
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:13,133
- Sounds pathetic, I know.
- No, it's good to take it slow.

481
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:16,703
You'd be smart to be careful.

482
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:20,947
- Any particular reason?
- Look...

483
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:23,782
Mike's a wonderful guy. Really.

484
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:28,087
But you should ask him
why he moved to Wisteria Lane.

485
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:30,593
It's one hell of a story.

486
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,596
Here. Got some ice.

487
00:35:34,665 --> 00:35:37,031
- There you go.
- Thanks.

488
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:53,048
Well, it's been fun.
Thanks, guys. See you later.

489
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:55,381
Hoo-wee!

490
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:58,820
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

491
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:00,858
Have a seat.

492
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:07,229
I could get used to
this whole closure thing.

493
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:09,823
I love long goodbyes.

494
00:36:20,444 --> 00:36:23,504
Wait around the corner.
I'll be right back.

495
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,554
Smile, Gabrielle.

496
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:52,333
Well, that's it, then.

497
00:36:57,248 --> 00:37:00,342
What are you doing? She had a camera.
We've got to catch her.

498
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:07,856
Mrs. Solis, your husband's
going to kill us. Come on!

499
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:13,255
- [Juanita] Leave me alone.
- [John] Give me that camera!

500
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:16,960
- I'm not kidding, old woman!
- Stay away from me! Don't touch me!

501
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:05,378
No.

502
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:10,016
No, you go home. I'll take care of this.

503
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:14,380
And you were never here. Go.

504
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:15,982
Go!

505
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:25,766
Did you see that? A guy came barreling
around the corner and just hit her.

506
00:38:25,836 --> 00:38:27,565
- Do you have a cell phone?
- Yeah.

507
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,697
Call 911.

508
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:07,271
- What happened?
- Is she breathing?

509
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:11,577
As Juanita tetered dangerously close
to the white light,

510
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:15,641
Lynette and Tom were headed
into a black hole.

511
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,187
I was just participating.

512
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:20,746
Your participation was supposed
to be limited to making dinner,

513
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:22,952
not making my ideas look bad.

514
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,892
Maybe you need better ideas.

515
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:28,194
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

516
00:39:28,265 --> 00:39:30,358
No, we both know that your career

517
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:33,267
was going better than mine
before we had kids.

518
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:36,431
- You never let me forget that.
- That is not fair.

519
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:40,375
You were always competing with me,
and judging by tonight, you still are.

520
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:43,106
Tom, I am sorry about tonight. Truly.

521
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:46,616
But if I'm competing it's with
the Bree Van De Kamps of the world,

522
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:49,653
with their spotless kitchens
and their perfect kids,

523
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,848
who throw fabulous parties
where nothing ever goes wrong.

524
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:55,653
I try so hard to keep up but I can't.

525
00:39:55,726 --> 00:40:00,686
And when you work on a pitch,
I am reminded of a world I left behind,

526
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:03,859
where I was the winner
and people tried to keep up with me.

527
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:06,767
I can't go back,
I can't win where I am.

528
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:10,603
I am stuck in the middle
and it is really starting to get to me.

529
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:15,270
Whoa! For your information, I thought
you threw an amazing dinner party.

530
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:19,646
I was thrilled. I don't know
how you pulled it all together.

531
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:25,917
- Yeah, well...
- And whether you believe it or not,

532
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:29,687
everyone who knows you thinks
that you are a great wife and mother.

533
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,853
- No, they don't.
- Yes, they do.

534
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:36,600
Especially me.

535
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:38,635
Thanks.

536
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:42,672
What's wrong with your eyes?

537
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:45,106
Nothing. I'm tired. [scoffs]

538
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:49,408
- Turn around. I want to look at you.
- I'm fine.

539
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,505
[Siren blares]

540
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:54,050
What's going on outside?

541
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:04,087
[Medic] Right there.

542
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:12,128
Thank God you're here. Will you take
care of Gabrielle for a minute?

543
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:14,467
All right.

544
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:20,869
Oh, Andrew. Thank God you're back.
I need your help, honey.

545
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:23,641
There's been an accident.

546
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:27,247
Andrew?

547
00:41:31,355 --> 00:41:33,619
Mama?

548
00:41:33,724 --> 00:41:37,683
[Gasps] Andrew!

549
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,631
Rex, you need to come home.

550
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:46,829
Something's happened and we need you.

551
00:41:58,148 --> 00:42:02,346
Competition. It means different things
to different people.

552
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:05,354
But whether it's a friendly rivalry

553
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:07,390
or a fight to the death...

554
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:08,948
Cheers.

555
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:12,928
...the end result is the same.

556
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:15,465
There will be winners...

557
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,262
and there will be losers.

558
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:29,310
Of course, the trick is...

559
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,905
to know which battles to fight.

560
00:42:34,118 --> 00:42:36,484
You se,

561
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:39,785
no victory comes without a price.
