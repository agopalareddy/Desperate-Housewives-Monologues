2
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,992
Previously on Desperate Housewives...

3
00:00:03,069 --> 00:00:04,195
I left Morty.

4
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:07,262
Susan's mother made
quite an impression.

5
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,035
Bre made a secret commitment.

6
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:13,136
- He's not gonna let us be friends.
- Who says he has to know?

7
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:15,511
Gabrielle made a discovery.

8
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:17,675
I am pregnant and it's all your fault.

9
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:19,946
Tom made a mistake.

10
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,114
You hire your old girlfriend
and you don't tell me?

11
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:25,214
And Susan made an appointment...

12
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,691
- Do you think you can help?
...with trouble.

13
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:29,888
I know I can.

14
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:37,260
When she was younger, Sophie Bremmer
was a hopeless romantic.

15
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:40,670
She was also hopelessly naive,

16
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,403
which is how
she came to be married four times.

17
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:49,380
The first time
to a man who liked to gamble.

18
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:53,818
The second time
to a man who liked to drink.

19
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:58,654
The third time
to a man who liked other men.

20
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:05,096
And the fourth time to the same man
she married the second time.

21
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:10,664
Yes, Sophie was tired
of having her heart broken.

22
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:15,367
So she decided
she would never get married again.

23
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:18,306
And then one night...

24
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:21,677
- [man shouts] Sophie!
...she had a visitor.

25
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:24,717
Sophie!

26
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:26,775
Morty, what are you doing?

27
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:29,879
[Slurring] l-l-I need to talk to Sophie.

28
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:32,288
Now? Are you drunk?

29
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:35,623
Uh... just a little.

30
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:38,255
H-how are you, Susie?

31
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:44,303
I've got... I've got to speak
to uh... to Sophie.

32
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,100
[Susan] Are you crazy?
It's 1:00 in the morning.

33
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:49,869
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.

34
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:53,106
- What?
- Well, I thought I could be happy.

35
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:56,046
The restaurant
is starting to make money.

36
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,812
I just bought a new jet ski.

37
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:01,479
My cholesterol is down.

38
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:06,457
But none of it's any fun without her.

39
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:11,655
Oh, Morty. I just don't think
it's going to happen.

40
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:16,634
She's moved on. Why don't you just
sit down? I'm gonna call you a cab.

41
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:23,099
- Sophie.
- Your doctor told you not to drink.

42
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:27,738
Well, there are times
when you need uh...

43
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,339
when you need liquid courage.

44
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:37,318
Oh! Oh!

45
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,823
[Giggles]

46
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:44,356
Did this ring belong to Dolores?

47
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,625
You gave her your dead wife's ring?

48
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:53,263
It's a three-carat diamond.
She shouldn't care if it's used.

49
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:56,766
So what... What do you say, Soph?

50
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,606
- All right.
- Really?

51
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,839
- Really?
- Yeah.

52
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:06,284
[Whispers] But no... You've got to
do it officially. You know...

53
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,513
Oh. Oh um...

54
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:10,453
Yeah. Oh um... Here.

55
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:23,335
Sophie, would you do me the honor
of marrying me?

56
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:27,863
Sophie Bremmer
was still a hopeless romantic.

57
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:33,880
On one condition. Tomorrow
we trade this in for a ring of my own.

58
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:37,041
And I want a bigger diamond
than Dolores got.

59
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:41,976
But she was no longer naive.

60
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:30,267
Marriage is a simple concept.

61
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:34,204
Basically, it's a contract
betwen two people

62
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:38,005
that binds them together for life

63
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:41,740
in the hopes that
they can live happily ever after.

64
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:47,476
Sadly, some contracts...
are made to be broken.

65
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:50,716
- I didn't mess with your birth control.
- Really?

66
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,587
Really.

67
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:59,791
Look. It's been pulled apart
and put back together.

68
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:03,927
- It's probably a manufacturing defect.
- You can still see the glue marks.

69
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:06,233
I'm telling you, I didn't do it.

70
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,103
Don't insult me, Carlos.

71
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:10,734
You've been whining about
wanting a baby for months.

72
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,175
Who else would it have been?

73
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:13,507
I don't...

74
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:17,446
- Oh, no.
- What?

75
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,644
- Mama.
- Oh, please.

76
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:24,486
It's possible. You buy that stuff
in bulk, six months at a time, right?

77
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:25,854
Yeah. So?

78
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:29,554
Before the accident, I told her
how much I wanted to have a child.

79
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:32,063
She said that she would take care of it.

80
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:35,328
I just thought that
she would talk to you.

81
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:37,869
Baby, I am so sorry.

82
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:47,277
That bitch.

83
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,178
I can't believe her.

84
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:52,706
I loved her
but even I had issues sometimes.

85
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:54,514
She could be very controlling.

86
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:57,522
Reaching out from the grave
to screw with me.

87
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:01,587
God, she's good.

88
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:05,494
Where are you going?

89
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:07,931
I feel a wave of
morning sickness coming on.

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,902
I want to be standing
on your mother's grave when it hits.

91
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,570
I'm gonna be home late tonight.

92
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:24,207
Peterson wants to
take us out for drinks.

93
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:27,013
Oh, that's fine. Uh...

94
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:30,021
I wanted to talk to you about something.

95
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:32,023
- What?
- [Car horn beeps]

96
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:34,116
Oh, that's your car pool.

97
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:35,660
You gotta go. Never mind.

98
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,595
- Lynette, what is it?
- It's nothing.

99
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:40,564
OK.

100
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:43,329
It's just...

101
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:50,570
We haven't had sex in ten days. The
longest we've ever gone before is nine.

102
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:54,044
- [Car horn]
- Didn't we do it last Thursday?

103
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:58,550
We started to but then...
you fell asleep.

104
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:02,486
Is this why you're so worried?
We can do it tonight if you want to.

105
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:05,524
- Whatever.
- No, I've got ten days pent up in me.

106
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:08,424
We are doing it tonight.

107
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:11,793
- You have nothing to worry about, OK?
- [Knock on door]

108
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:13,923
Oh, crap. I forgot my briefcase.

109
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,968
Can you tell them I'll be right there?

110
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:17,366
Sure.

111
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:22,834
- Oh.
- Hey, Lynette.

112
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:25,241
- Hey.
- So is Tom almost ready?

113
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:27,370
Yeah, he's just getting his briefcase.

114
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,573
[Phone beps]

115
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:29,637
Sorry.

116
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:30,841
It's OK.

117
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:46,222
- Bye.
- Bye.

118
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:54,262
I got it. I got it.

119
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:58,574
Thank you for having me.

120
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:01,945
I'm gonna miss you both so much.

121
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:05,177
Us too. The house will feel
just empty without you.

122
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:08,243
- Can't you guys stay a little longer?
- No, no, no.

123
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,482
They wanna get their new life started.

124
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:12,956
We don't wanna
hold these crazy kids back.

125
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:14,583
[Both laugh]

126
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,685
Bye, Morty.

127
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:20,357
Uh... listen, I hope it's OK

128
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:26,065
but your mom told me some of the stuff
that you've been going through,

129
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:30,370
you know, with the plumber guy
across the street.

130
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:32,343
- She did, huh?
- Yeah. Um...

131
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:34,402
Don't give up on him.

132
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:39,508
I mean, if I'd given up, I wouldn't be
here now with this lovely lady.

133
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:43,817
Did she tell you that he served time
in prison for manslaughter?

134
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:47,485
No, she left that part out.

135
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:51,495
I don't suppose she told you
he was a drug dealer.

136
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:54,499
I don't recall that.

137
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:57,536
Will you stop?
You don't know the whole story.

138
00:08:57,603 --> 00:09:01,369
- Mother...
- I told him how much you love him.

139
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,601
What? What were you thinking?

140
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:06,144
- What did he say?
- Yeah, what did he say?

141
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:09,477
I think I walked in on him
at a very bad time.

142
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:13,007
Someone close to him had just died.

143
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:17,613
- Oh, God. Really?
- He could use a shoulder to cry on.

144
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:23,121
Can I have one more hug?
Please. I can't stand it.

145
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:41,677
Mm. Oh, George.
You have got to taste this.

146
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,908
- A little messy but...
- I can't wait.

147
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:49,020
Mm. Is that fennel seed? It's fantastic?

148
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:52,421
I don't know, but anything that good
has got to be sinful.

149
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:57,452
Isn't this fun trying different dishes
and opening up to new experiences?

150
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,555
Rex just hates these cooks tours.

151
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:04,433
He likes to stay at home with a plate
of spaghetti and a mug of root beer.

152
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,202
Mm.

153
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:13,268
So how about this marinara sauce?
I think it's the best I've ever had.

154
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,712
I had one better but that was in Italy.

155
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,909
- You've been to Italy?
- Mm-hm.

156
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:23,786
Rex and I took a vacation there
right before the kids were born.

157
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:28,893
We had so much fun
in those first few years.

158
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:33,728
Guess it was just easier
to be happy back then.

159
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:40,071
I don't know why I just said that.
No more wine for me.

160
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,772
Maybe we should go to Italy.

161
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:48,643
- What?
- Wouldn't that be a hoot?

162
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:51,706
All those museums and cathedrals
and trattorias.

163
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:55,948
- We could just make pigs of ourselves.
- I can't go on a trip with you, George.

164
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:58,287
Why not?

165
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:00,655
I'm married. People would talk.

166
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:03,991
- Right. I'm sorry. It was a bad idea.
- Don't worry about it.

167
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:08,727
Here. Try one of these clams. I bet
they're as good as the marinara sauce.

168
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:19,639
Mm.

169
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,179
You are absolutely right.

170
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,686
If it's that good,
it's just got to be sinful.

171
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:40,326
OK, boys. It's 7:00.

172
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,836
- It's time for bed. Let's go.
- Why do we have to go to bed so early?

173
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:48,203
I told you. Daddy and I
have a special meeting tonight.

174
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:50,105
- Go on.
- [Groaning]

175
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:51,973
I love you.

176
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:05,120
- Hi.
- Whoa!

177
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:06,624
I'm sorry.

178
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:11,527
Hi. Whoa. All right.
This is the tenth day.

179
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:15,033
Honey, give me a second
to let the office wear off.

180
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:17,160
- OK.
- OK, I'm in.

181
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:29,677
What are you thinking?

182
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,377
- I was wondering what that smell was.
- Oh.

183
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:35,181
It's probably baby drool.

184
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,717
There. Now you have easier access.

185
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:42,260
- Whoo-hoo!
- Incoming!

186
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:51,460
- What?
- That smell really soaked through, huh?

187
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:55,735
Yes. It soaked through a little.
That is the nature of baby throw-up.

188
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:58,106
Do you want me to wear a Hazmat suit?

189
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:02,614
No, I just like it when you're
all clean and in your sexy clothes.

190
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:07,618
[Laughs] I don't own anything
clean and sexy.

191
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:12,555
Everything is either covered in
baby spit or chunks of melted crayon.

192
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,751
OK, I'm sorry.

193
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:16,590
You make me feel like
I just got off the shrimp boat.

194
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:18,755
Honey, I said I'm sorry.

195
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:22,358
It's just that guys
sometimes like it when women,

196
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:24,868
you know,
put a little effort into things.

197
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:32,099
OK. Um...

198
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:35,375
Can we just go back to
the kissing thing? Can we try that.

199
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:38,177
Fine.

200
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,184
[Baby cries]

201
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:42,914
- OK. Off.
- [Boy] Oh, the baby's up!

202
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,388
Mom!

203
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:47,618
- [Crying continues]
- Mom!

204
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:54,031
- Susan Mayer hired you?
- I know. Huh.

205
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:58,160
She decided to stop poking around
in your life and call me of all people.

206
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:03,471
Lucky for you, I've got
the biggest ad in the phone book.

207
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:06,639
- What am I going to do?
- Run.

208
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:09,306
- Pack up your kid and leave.
- That's tricky.

209
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:11,975
My son doesn't want to move.

210
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:15,487
- He can be pretty insistent.
- Huh.

211
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:19,251
Well, I can throw her off the scent
for a while.

212
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:24,088
- Fine.
- All right then.

213
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:27,360
Tell me exactly what it is
you want this woman to believe.

214
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:30,498
She was born Angela,

215
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:33,868
but when she was a teenager
she changed her name to Mary Alice.

216
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:36,237
The application says

217
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:40,074
that she was named after
a relative that she no longer speaks to.

218
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:43,342
Now, here's her birth certificate

219
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:48,319
and her Utah petition
for a legal name change.

220
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:55,186
- What about Dana?
- There was a record of another child.

221
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:58,162
A girl. Dana Marie Young.

222
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:02,132
Died at 18 months,
apparently from some kind of fall.

223
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:07,302
It was all true. Everything he said.

224
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:13,375
- How could I have been so wrong?
- Well...

225
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:18,382
- I'm gonna need a check.
- Oh. Of course.

226
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:31,955
Actually, before you go, I need you to
check into someone else's background.

227
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:36,357
There's this plumber I know.

228
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:45,739
Hey. Did you get my messages?

229
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:49,440
Yeah, I didn't want to call you 'cause
I wanted to talk to you in person.

230
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:52,780
I have some potentially upsetting news.

231
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:57,254
Come on, Mrs. Solis.
You can tell me. I can handle it.

232
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,184
I'm pregnant and it might be yours.

233
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:15,803
I could barely afford my new dirt bike.
How am I gonna handle child support?

234
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:18,434
We don't know for sure
if it's yours, so relax.

235
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:21,707
- I didn't come to watch you freak out.
- Why did you come?

236
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,578
- I want you to let me protect you.
- From who?

237
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,141
Carlos, your parents.

238
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:30,552
John, something like this
can ruin your life.

239
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:33,420
That's why you have to keep quiet
about our affair.

240
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:37,656
There's no point in this catastrophe
taking both of us down.

241
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:42,828
- Thank you.
- Forget about it.

242
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:51,267
- I should have worn a condom.
- Yeah. That would have been helpful.

243
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,914
You hired a private investigator?

244
00:16:56,982 --> 00:17:00,383
I can't trust Mike and I want
to find out what really happened.

245
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:03,387
From a source
that doesn't have an agenda.

246
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:05,980
Now open it up.

247
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:08,356
OK. You ready?

248
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:11,724
Go.

249
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:13,628
- Stop!
- What?

250
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:18,864
OK. If you find out
something that's really bad,

251
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:21,906
just try to put a positive spin on it.

252
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:32,349
OK.

253
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:35,979
I have some good news
and some bad news.

254
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,649
Give me the bad news first.

255
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:42,285
The guy Mike killed... was a cop.

256
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:44,090
Oh, my God!

257
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:46,188
Oh, my God.

258
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:51,464
OK. Give me the good news.

259
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:53,767
- There is none.
- What?

260
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,773
You told me to spin it!

261
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:59,277
Oh, forget it.
Just let me look at it myself.

262
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,895
- I can't believe it.
- What is it?

263
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:19,556
I know her.

264
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:42,318
What's going on here?

265
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:47,987
You two just won't stop, will you?

266
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,393
Deidre's dead.
It doesn't matter who killed her.

267
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:54,660
- Just let it go.
- It's not that easy, Kendra.

268
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:58,100
Why? My sister hated you. Both of you.

269
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,934
- She said so.
- That was the drugs talking.

270
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:03,907
Right, right. The drugs.

271
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:07,935
Deidre humiliated this family and
she threw our love back in our faces.

272
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:09,776
She couldn't have cared less.

273
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:11,907
- Are you done?
- No.

274
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,179
I want to know what you're planning.

275
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:20,021
- We're just talking.
- I don't believe you.

276
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:22,253
Then don't ask.

277
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:35,364
I don't want a new cardiologist but
Lee's been conducting tests for weeks.

278
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,499
He should know what's wrong by now.

279
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:40,841
Honey, we socialize with them.
What am I going to say to Helen?

280
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:44,849
All I know is, I've never felt worse,
and I've got to do something.

281
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:50,816
Um... I uh... I have to talk to Edie.

282
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:53,187
Um... Bree, we're gonna be late.

283
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:57,217
Oh, it'll just take a second.
I need to um... get a recipe.

284
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:59,662
- Edie. Hi.
- Hi.

285
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:03,531
- I saw you at Fredo's yesterday.
- Yeah, I saw you, too.

286
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:05,536
[Tuts] Naughty, naughty.

287
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:08,129
- I beg your pardon?
- The guy.

288
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,801
The one you were spoon-feeding.

289
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:15,870
Not bad. A little petit for my taste,
but I'm not the one sleeping with him.

290
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:20,510
This is exactly what I was afraid of.
George and I are just friends.

291
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:23,054
Hey, I'm not judging you. I get it.

292
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:27,251
Rex was sticking it to that
hooker housewife. It's payback time.

293
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:30,693
You have got the wrong idea.
That man is my pharmacist.

294
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:33,629
You could have an affair with anyone.
A pharmacist?

295
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:38,693
- You are such a Republican.
- I am not having an affair.

296
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:41,261
George and I, we just talk.

297
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:45,936
He's a very good listener and
I share my hopes and dreams with him,

298
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:48,275
and my innermost thoughts.

299
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:51,111
That's all there is to it
and you have to believe me.

300
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:53,845
- OK. I believe you.
- Thank you.

301
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,716
I'm glad we cleared this up.

302
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:57,584
I know it must have looked strange

303
00:20:57,656 --> 00:21:01,456
and I didn't want you to think
that I was cheating on my husband.

304
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:04,017
But you sort of are.

305
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,997
- Excuse me?
- Well, come on, Bree.

306
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:09,795
You're telling him
your innermost thoughts?

307
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:12,268
Your hopes? Your dreams?

308
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:16,967
Sex aside, you're pretty intimate
with a guy that's not your husband.

309
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:20,637
Well, I mean,
everybody needs someone to talk to.

310
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:22,509
[Car horn]

311
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:25,916
What's wrong with talking to Rex?

312
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:34,825
[Man] Please leave a message.

313
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:38,852
Hello, Zach? It's Felicia Tillman.

314
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:41,694
I do so enjoy our little visits

315
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:43,792
and I haven't seen you for a few days.

316
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:46,497
I hope everything's all right.

317
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:51,668
- Zach's not feeling well.
- Oh. Paul.

318
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:55,804
And I don't think it's appropriate that
he spends so much time at your house.

319
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:05,623
Made us some cocoa.
How are you feeling?

320
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:08,524
I've felt awful for two days now.

321
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:12,692
Think I should see a doctor?

322
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:16,928
It's probably just a touch of the flu.
We'll keep an eye on it.

323
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:22,138
It's this house, Zach. I feel it too.

324
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:24,641
It isn't healthy for us to stay here.

325
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:28,476
I told you. I'm not moving.

326
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:30,276
It would be for your own good.

327
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:33,978
You can't keep doing
the kinds of things you're doing.

328
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:38,352
Susan Mayer's kitchen, for example.
People are going to catch on.

329
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:44,292
Wouldn't it be great to start over
somewhere in the country?

330
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:48,026
Could meet some new friends.
Maybe even meet a new girl.

331
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:52,730
How about I let you sleep on it?

332
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,240
We'll talk about moving tomorrow.

333
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,803
The lack of passion in her marriage

334
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:04,212
had become an unpleasant reality
for Lynette.

335
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:08,283
Then one day it occurred to her,

336
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:10,651
the best way to fight reality...

337
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:15,685
was with a little fantasy.

338
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:22,797
Of course, all the fantasy
in the world won't do you any good...

339
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,531
if no one shows up to enjoy it.

340
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:50,784
I feel bad about
putting you out like this, Tom.

341
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:54,093
You're not putting anybody out.
You've been flying all day.

342
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:56,259
Why stay in some hotel?

343
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:59,360
I just hope you don't mind
sleeping on the sofa.

344
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,299
Yeah. Sofa should be fine.

345
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,881
Hey, honey. Why don't you just...
let the maid get that?

346
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,721
[Feigns laughter] Not funny, Tom.

347
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:26,560
Gary's showering. He asked if you could
bring him a towel and your riding crop.

348
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,789
Come on!

349
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:33,065
No, I'm glad that you find
my humiliation so entertaining.

350
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:36,471
Honey, you were wearing
a French maid's costume.

351
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:39,840
I mean, come on. What were you thinking?

352
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:44,610
That our marriage was in trouble
and one of us should try and save it.

353
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:49,185
Whoa. Since when
is our marriage in trouble?

354
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:54,648
OK, so we haven't had sex
for a few days. Big deal. It happens.

355
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:58,355
- [Car horn beeps]
- Oh. That's Annabel. How ironic.

356
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:02,993
How is Annabel relevant
to this conversation?

357
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:07,300
Because she comes to this house every
morning to remind you of what I'm not.

358
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:10,034
- What?
- She's the fantasy, Tom.

359
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:12,508
The hot woman
that you work with every day

360
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:15,637
with her manicured nails
and her designer outfits.

361
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:19,377
I am the reality.

362
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:24,150
The wife who never wears makeup and
whose clothes smell like a hamper.

363
00:25:24,956 --> 00:25:28,357
OK, this may be the stupidest thing
you've ever said.

364
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:30,519
I used to be the fantasy.

365
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:34,554
There was a time
when I didn't need a maid's outfit

366
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:37,124
because I knew I was enough for you.

367
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,636
Even wearing a smelly T-shirt.

368
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:44,633
And clearly, that's no longer the case.

369
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,869
OK, honey, I don't know what to say.

370
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:51,973
If there's a way for me to fix this,
I will do it.

371
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:56,350
- Just tell me and I will do it.
- No, there's nothing to fix.

372
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:58,548
We've changed. That's all I'm saying.

373
00:26:01,526 --> 00:26:04,051
[Car horn beeps]

374
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:06,529
You ready?

375
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:11,632
You should go.
You don't want to keep Annabel waiting.

376
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:23,910
Be careful with that.
You'll give the baby heartburn.

377
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:27,816
I can't get it hot enough.
My hormones are killing my taste buds.

378
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:31,720
You've been paying more attention
to your food than you have to me.

379
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:35,226
I plan on getting really fat
as a tribute to your mother.

380
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:52,537
John, what are you doing here?

381
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:56,445
- I've been thinking about the baby.
- Really? Why?

382
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:59,950
There's a chance that it's mine.
I want to do the right thing.

383
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:04,114
No. No, no. Nobody expects you
to do the right thing.

384
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:08,523
I figured you'd try to blow me off.
That's why I'm going to Mr. Solis.

385
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:10,857
Are you crazy? He would kill us both.

386
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:13,193
He and I need to hash this out.
Man to man.

387
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:16,791
- It's what's best for the baby.
- John!

388
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:19,769
Are you gonna go get him or am I?

389
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:24,706
OK. You win.

390
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:30,540
Wait right here.

391
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,825
- Uh... don't get out.
- Why?

392
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:51,165
Because I was going to get in.

393
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:55,969
Yeah. You see, pregnant women
have very strong urges.

394
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:59,477
All right.

395
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:02,513
I'm gonna freshen up
and I'll be right back.

396
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:05,447
- OK.
- You sit.

397
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:09,749
Sit. I'm turning on some music.

398
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:14,315
[R&B music plays loudly]

399
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:21,726
Um... Carlos is unavailable
at the moment.

400
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:26,433
- You're lying.
- John, what are you doing?

401
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:29,473
- Mr. Solis! Mr. Solis, open up!
- Stop it!

402
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:32,704
[Music plays]

403
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:35,475
What are you... John!

404
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:38,345
- Mrs. Solis, get out of the way.
- What are you doing?

405
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:40,008
No!

406
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,043
Oh, my God!

407
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:46,056
[Music plays]

408
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:49,457
- Oh, God, it burns.
- I'm sorry. It's just salsa.

409
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:52,519
- It feels like acid.
- I've been finding it so bland.

410
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:56,363
- Mr. Solis! I need to talk to you!
- John, shut up!

411
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:58,994
John, shut the hell up. Listen to me.

412
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:02,665
You are never gonna be
the father of this baby.

413
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:06,700
No matter what the paternity tests say,
it's Carlos' child.

414
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:10,214
- How can you say that?
- Because Carlos can provide, John.

415
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:12,875
He will give this baby everything.

416
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:17,217
Piano lessons and summer camp
and the best colleges.

417
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:21,816
He can raise this child the way a child
deserves to be raised. You can't.

418
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:25,522
This isn't about money.
This is about what's best for the baby.

419
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:29,158
If you want what's best for the baby,
then you will help me.

420
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:33,568
Help me make sure this kid
does not grow up poor like I did.

421
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:35,936
What's taking you...

422
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:38,703
Oh, hey, John.

423
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,678
What are you doing here?

424
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:45,105
Um... he...

425
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:47,845
Justin thinks
the hydrangeas need replacing.

426
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,581
He wanted me to come by
for a second opinion.

427
00:29:50,655 --> 00:29:53,783
He's a good kid,
but he's not half the gardener you were.

428
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:57,521
You should come back and work for us.
You're practically family.

429
00:30:00,932 --> 00:30:03,230
Thanks, Mr. Solis.

430
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:32,052
- [Doorbell]
- Zach? Are you here?

431
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:04,856
I have to do this, dear.
I know you'll forgive me.

432
00:31:22,113 --> 00:31:23,740
- Hey.
- Hey.

433
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:26,511
- Are the boys asleep?
- Tucked in tight.

434
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:28,916
- And Penny?
- Sound asleep.

435
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:35,989
OK, when this thing goes off,
meet me in the bedroom.

436
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:40,087
- What are you... What is this...
- Uh-uh. Wait till it goes off.

437
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:50,036
- [Timer rings]
- All right. I'm coming in.

438
00:31:57,215 --> 00:32:01,151
[Gasps] Oh, my God!

439
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:04,746
You want fantasy? I give you fantasy.

440
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:06,346
Oh!

441
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:09,154
Come to me, woman,
and prepare to be boarded.

442
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:12,788
Please, will you make it fast?
These things are just chafing.

443
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:15,731
I uh... I kinda like it.

444
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,268
Good. Kill the lights.

445
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:23,569
- No.
- Please.

446
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:25,734
- Not turning off the lights.
- Please.

447
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:28,278
No, no, no.

448
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:30,507
[Growls and purrs]

449
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:37,843
- [Knocking]
- It's open.

450
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:42,791
Oh, Paul, it's you. I'm so glad. I have
some papers I want you to look at.

451
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,294
- Where's my son?
- Upstairs.

452
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:48,696
Sleeping off those tranquilizers
you gave him.

453
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:51,564
I don't know what you're doing
but I'm taking my son.

454
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:55,197
I am not my sister, Paul.
You do not want to screw with me.

455
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:01,472
Martha kept a journal.

456
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:08,452
Every drab event of her drab life
meticulously documented.

457
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:14,082
Including her discovery
that you and your wife stole a baby.

458
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:18,157
A baby named Dana.

459
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:27,868
I'm sorry if the copies
are hard to read.

460
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:30,339
I hid the originals in a safe place.

461
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:34,469
It seemed like a reasonable precaution,
since you murdered Martha and all.

462
00:33:36,214 --> 00:33:38,876
Would you like a cookie?

463
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,051
Suit yourself.

464
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:47,418
I have a little proposition for you.

465
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:51,792
These are the fantasies of a bored,
Ionely woman. They prove nothing.

466
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:54,559
The only reason
the police haven't caught you yet

467
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:57,294
is because they have
no reason to suspect you.

468
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:06,199
But once they found that Martha was
blackmailing Ange, sorry, Mary Alice...

469
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:09,678
- What is it you want?
- The same thing you want.

470
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:13,712
For you to leave town,
change your name,

471
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:17,778
and start your life over again
somewhere far away from here.

472
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:22,625
If you're so sure,
why don't you just turn me in?

473
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:25,321
Because Zach would never forgive me.

474
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:29,162
And it's important
that we be on good terms,

475
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:32,828
seeing as how
he's going to be living with me now.

476
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:36,802
- What?
- Your bags are packed.

477
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:41,836
You're about to become a fugitive.
Is that the life you want for your son?

478
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:45,314
The two of you spending every night
in a different town?

479
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:50,654
No. You're a better father than that.

480
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:55,082
I can't just leave him.

481
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:04,861
You stole him
so that he could have a better life.

482
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:08,736
That was a noble act, Paul. Truly.

483
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:13,234
And it's time for you to be noble again.

484
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:20,007
Can I at least say goodbye?

485
00:35:20,084 --> 00:35:23,349
Did you allow me
to say goodbye to Martha?

486
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:59,379
Oh, hi. I'm looking for Kendra Taylor.

487
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:01,584
I'm sorry. You're gonna have to leave.

488
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:04,423
Oh. Oh, you don't understand.

489
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,895
See, I can't just drive away.

490
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:10,730
- Please get back in the car.
- Look um... Bob.

491
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:13,429
- Let me try to explain.
- In the car.

492
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:16,166
See, the thing is,
this is maybe my last chance

493
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,435
to find out
if I can be with the man I love.

494
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,170
- Ma'am...
- And, Bob,

495
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:22,906
I can't begin to tell you
how much that means to me.

496
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:28,145
So I'm gonna walk up to that house
and you're gonna let me.

497
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:30,312
And you know why?

498
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:37,157
Because behind that badge and that big,
you-could-crush-me-like-a-fly chest,

499
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:39,059
there's a heart.

500
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:43,089
A heart that believes in love.

501
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:51,808
- Just get in the damn car.
- It's not my fault you don't have love.

502
00:36:53,744 --> 00:36:58,113
- Susan?
- Hi, Kendra.

503
00:36:58,182 --> 00:37:01,777
And despite all that's been
laid out in front of me,

504
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:04,412
I can't help thinking
there's more to the story.

505
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:08,083
- Does it sound stupid?
- No, no, of course not.

506
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:12,926
Unfortunately,
you've got the whole story right here.

507
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:15,488
But Mike's lawyer pleaded self-defense.

508
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:19,161
Delfino sold black-tar heroin
to my daughter.

509
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:23,435
He killed the cop that tried to bust
him, got convicted and did his time.

510
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:25,202
- End of story...
- Dad...

511
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:29,076
She deserves to hear the truth,
however awful.

512
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:33,640
I'm sorry, Miss Mayer. I really am.

513
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:39,882
I appreciate you talking to me.

514
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:46,822
What the hell was that?

515
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:49,866
If she knew the truth,
she'd go running back to him.

516
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:54,236
She might talk him out of doing his job.

517
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,631
I can't risk that.

518
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,476
Just don't have the time.

519
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:18,255
Quick. Drive around the corner.
We need to talk.

520
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:23,161
What do you think?
I chose green so it will work

521
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:26,203
whether Gabrielle has a boy or a girl.

522
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,238
That's great.

523
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,166
What's the matter?
You've been mopey all day.

524
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:36,236
I'm sorry.
I'm just worried about the test results.

525
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:39,408
If I don't find out what's wrong
with me, I'll lose my mind.

526
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:42,714
- Oh, honey.
- You must get tired of me complaining.

527
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:45,119
No. No, not at all.

528
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:47,453
I think we should talk about it.

529
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:51,222
In fact,
I think maybe we don't talk enough.

530
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,025
I guess.

531
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:59,560
Why don't we start doing things
together again as a couple?

532
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:01,730
Mm-hm.

533
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:07,671
As soon as you're well enough,
we should go on a vacation.

534
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:10,111
Take a trip. Go somewhere fun.

535
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:15,410
- Remember our trip to Italy?
- Sort of.

536
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,920
Sort of?

537
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:22,925
You don't remember the glorious food
and the gorgeous scenery and...

538
00:39:22,993 --> 00:39:25,188
What I remember is sweating like a pig

539
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:27,924
and wishing we hadn't
spent all our savings.

540
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,966
So where would you like to go?

541
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:44,944
It doesn't matter. You decide.

542
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:53,454
[Kendra] Mike wasn't a drug dealer.

543
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:57,523
- What?
- Deidre was.

544
00:39:57,595 --> 00:40:00,928
Mike, he kicked the habit early on.

545
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:05,367
But Deidre couldn't or didn't want to.
I don't know.

546
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:09,839
Anyway, she spiraled out of control
and was in and out of jail.

547
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:13,001
One day an undercover cop
caught her using.

548
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:16,205
He forced her to trade sex for freedom.

549
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:22,948
Mike found out about it
and he tried to put a stop to it.

550
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,818
He busted in on the two of them.

551
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:32,022
He... Well, the cop pulled a gun on him
and Mike fought him off,

552
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:35,122
but they both went over the balcony.

553
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:37,963
Mike was the only one that got back up.

554
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:45,903
It was self-defense.

555
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:49,039
Yeah.

556
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:54,573
Mike went to jail
trying to save my sister.

557
00:40:55,553 --> 00:40:57,646
But he couldn't.

558
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:05,025
I knew he was good.

559
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:08,058
I just knew it.

560
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:13,932
Thank you.

561
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:22,643
The vow is simple, really.

562
00:41:25,115 --> 00:41:30,178
Those who take it promise to stay
together for better or for worse,

563
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,688
for richer or for poorer,

564
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:38,919
in sickness and in health.

565
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:43,929
To honor and to cherish.

566
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:49,665
Forsaking all others.

567
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,546
Until death do us part.

568
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:10,123
Yes, the vow is simple.

569
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:14,722
Finding someone worthy
of such a promise is the hard part.

570
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,830
But if we can,

571
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:22,498
that's when we begin to live
happily ever after.
