2
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,026
Previously on Desperate Housewives...

3
00:00:03,103 --> 00:00:07,767
My electronic monitoring device.
I'm on house arrest.

4
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:11,637
- Investigations began.
- I need you to check into someone else.

5
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:13,542
There's this plumber I know.

6
00:00:13,613 --> 00:00:17,845
- Boundaries were pushed.
- You won't regret taking this journey.

7
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:20,818
- And the news...
- Peterson called me into his office.

8
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:26,117
...went from bad...
- He's holding the promotion for Duggan.

9
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:28,820
...to worse.
- I'm pregnant and it might be yours.

10
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:37,199
Edie Britt's favorite moment
of every day

11
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:41,070
was her arrival at the construction site
of her new home,

12
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:44,508
because she knew
what was about to happen.

13
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:49,981
Her sudden appearance was always sure
to generate a few appreciative glances,

14
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,848
a few lascivious looks,

15
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:55,820
and some downright ogling.

16
00:00:55,889 --> 00:01:00,417
Sadly for Edie, the one man
she wanted most to notice her...

17
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:05,654
...paid her no attention at all.

18
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:10,202
Yes, Edie neded attention
to fel good about herself.

19
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,034
And she was determined to get it.

20
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:16,735
Miss Britt,
you look extra beautiful today.

21
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,903
Cyrus, you're so sweet.

22
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:24,473
So anyhow, I was wondering if maybe...

23
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:28,453
I could uh...
take you out to dinner some time.

24
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:32,617
Oh, honey,
you are so far out of your league

25
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:37,720
that you are playing
a completely different sport.

26
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:50,604
- Hey there.
- Hey, Edie. What's up?

27
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:54,977
- Nice ensemble. You busy?
- No, not really.

28
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:58,347
Good. I bought fresh donuts
for my construction workers

29
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:01,251
and as you can see,
I bought a few too many.

30
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,312
So I thought you and I could...

31
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:07,255
- Susan.
- Hey there, Edie.

32
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:11,787
- What... What are you...
- Mike and I got back together.

33
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:14,629
- Super.
- I knew you'd be happy for us.

34
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:17,431
- So what's going on?
- Edie was about to...

35
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:19,267
Free donuts. Want 'em or not?

36
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:21,637
How sweet. Thanks.

37
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:24,700
Why don't you go put these on a plate?

38
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:30,682
And save me one with sprinkles.

39
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,344
I cannot believe
you are still coming onto him.

40
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:36,946
You said you were finished.
You thought he was a murderer.

41
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:39,253
And that was your cue
to come and flirt?

42
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,691
You wasted your time and your donuts.

43
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:43,956
Not if you choke on them.

44
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:48,091
- Thanks, Edie. The donuts look great.
- Pleasure.

45
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,193
See you.

46
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:56,538
I'm gonna run home and get some milk
to go with those donuts.

47
00:02:56,609 --> 00:03:00,602
Hey. It's a shame you've got to keep
running back and forth.

48
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,148
I can't have donuts and juice.

49
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:06,982
No, I mean, we should move in together.

50
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:13,285
- Come on. What do you say?
- Oh! Um... I say um... Ooh!

51
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:18,459
Hold that thought.
Edie! Edie! Stop!

52
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:22,399
- Hang on.
- What now?

53
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:27,997
I was just rude back there,
gloating and everything. I apologize.

54
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:30,872
Thank you, Susan.
That's very big of you.

55
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:35,972
And on a completely unrelated topic,
Mike and I are moving in together. Bye!

56
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,414
[Giggles]

57
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:42,386
Yes, Edie Britt neded the attention
of men to fel good about herself.

58
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,216
Hey, Cyrus. You have lunch plans?

59
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:48,521
No.

60
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:52,588
And even she was amazed at how far
she was willing to go to get it.

61
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:54,895
Ellsberg Hotel, half an hour.

62
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:58,836
Welcome to the majors.

63
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:49,414
Mr. And Mrs. Edwin Mullins
were finally leaving Wisteria Lane.

64
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:53,152
In the past year, their stret
had played host to arson,

65
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:55,956
violence, blackmail, and murder.

66
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:59,829
Fearing they too would be infected
by this moral decay,

67
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:03,266
the Mullins felt
it was time to say goodbye.

68
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,905
Strangely enough,
none of their neighbors

69
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:11,341
semed to notice
they were moving out.

70
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:18,817
Hey. I thought you might be thirsty.

71
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:21,877
No, I'm good.

72
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:24,115
So how's your roommate doing?

73
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,158
He's hanging in there.

74
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:30,286
Yeah. Well, I had to tell him some news

75
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:32,854
that was a little bit upsetting for him.

76
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:34,763
- No kidding.
- Excuse me?

77
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,530
John's not good enough
to raise a child?

78
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:40,265
- That kid could be his.
- It's a complicated situation.

79
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,036
Seems pretty simple to me.

80
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:45,509
You're an unfeeling bitch.

81
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:59,023
Why did you hit the lawn boy?

82
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:05,522
If you saw what he did to our begonias,
you'd slap him too.

83
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:21,102
I can't tell from this.

84
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:26,819
- Hey.
- Hey. What are you doing here?

85
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:30,549
Duggan's coming back to work.
I thought I'd do something special.

86
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:34,218
This has nothing to do with
you checking up on me and Annabel?

87
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:35,351
What?

88
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:37,862
Yesterday you brought
pictures of the kids.

89
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,330
The day before that you brought me soup.

90
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,494
Lynette, honey, it's got to stop.

91
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,036
Tom.

92
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:49,870
I don't care about you
working with Annabel.

93
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:53,241
I told you that. This is for Duggan.
He had a heart attack.

94
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:56,213
- I don't care about Annabel.
- Hey, Lynette.

95
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:00,384
Ah. Speak of the devil.

96
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:03,512
And I mean that.

97
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:14,065
Well, you're becoming a regular fixture
around here, aren't you?

98
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:17,398
Oh, yeah. I wanted to do
something nice for Duggan.

99
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:21,770
I suppose filling his bloodstream with
butter fat might be considered nice.

100
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:25,368
Actually, it's fruit juice sweetened.
Can I cut you...

101
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,141
a piece?

102
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,907
[Man] Everyone,
I need to see you right now.

103
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:36,546
OK, listen up.
I just spoke with Tim Duggan's wife.

104
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,921
It looks like he's not going to be
returning to work after all.

105
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:42,153
He had a relapse last night,

106
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:44,594
which puts us in a very tight spot.

107
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:48,191
But we're gonna work together
as a team and do what we need to do.

108
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:50,428
Jerry, take the Hollister account,

109
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:52,471
Suzanne, Paradise Springs,

110
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:56,338
and, Annabel, take the lead
on the Traveler's Hotel chain.

111
00:07:56,409 --> 00:08:00,072
- You leave for Hawaii in three days.
- I can't do Travelers by myself.

112
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,943
Not if they're moving into print.

113
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:04,141
Well, choose someone to take with you.

114
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:06,617
Oh. OK. Um...

115
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:10,417
I choose... Tom.

116
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:20,826
Let's see. I've beaten you at bridge
and mahjong and hearts.

117
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,664
This is your last chance
to redeem yourself.

118
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:26,170
Stop it. You're gonna make me laugh.

119
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:35,941
OK. OK, I'll be good.

120
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,944
- [Whispers] Miss it, miss it, miss it.
- Bree.

121
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,616
Come on. I'm allowed to psych you out.

122
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:58,331
OK. Time's up. Take your best shot.

123
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:01,936
I'm not ready yet.

124
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:06,411
- Hurry up. There are people waiting.
- One more minute.

125
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:10,643
- Come on, take your...
- Don't do that!

126
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,078
George...

127
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:19,724
Do you have an erection?

128
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:23,395
I'm sorry.

129
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,565
- What on earth?
- You were blowing on my ear.

130
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:30,500
- I was teasing you.
- Exactly.

131
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:35,363
You have got to get rid of it.
There are children present.

132
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:37,671
- How?
- I don't know!

133
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:40,541
- Think of something unpleasant.
- Like what?

134
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:45,550
Like famine or disease or hoboes.
Whatever. Just hurry.

135
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,984
You can't be mad about it.
It's not something men can control.

136
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:55,619
I thought Rex's dislike of you
was paranoid.

137
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,959
But you had feelings for me all along.

138
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,396
God, this is just such a betrayal.

139
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:04,800
Come on, Bree. The only thing
I'm guilty of is loving you in silence.

140
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,771
You shouldn't be doing that.
I'm married.

141
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,866
To a selfish liar
who betrayed you with a hooker.

142
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:14,902
I told you that in confidence.
How dare you throw it back in my face?

143
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:18,917
So you're ending our friendship,
after everything I've done for you?

144
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:21,044
What is that supposed to mean?

145
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:25,119
Nothing. It didn't mean anything.

146
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:30,320
George. I do love you. As a friend.

147
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:33,888
I wish you could love me the same way
back, but since you can't...

148
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,361
goodbye.

149
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:49,972
Later that day, Edie Britt
witnessed something disturbing.

150
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:57,989
Something she was determined
to put a stop to.

151
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:00,719
- Is Susan coming?
- She said she might be late.

152
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:03,921
They've started moving
Mike's things to her house.

153
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,760
- Already? Wow.
- Good for her.

154
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:10,563
Yeah. It's nice to see Susan
so happy again.

155
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:13,298
Yeah, I'm happy for Susan.

156
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:16,637
But don't you think she and Mike
are moving a little fast?

157
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:20,372
Two days ago she thought he was
a murderer and now they're moving in?

158
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:23,040
But she found out
it was in self-defense.

159
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:25,982
- They've cleared everything up.
- Good point.

160
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:28,782
- Mike's a decent guy.
- Yeah, that's true.

161
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,948
Of course,
there was the gunshot wound...

162
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:35,152
That's right. Did he ever explain that?

163
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:38,822
No. And I know guns,
and that wound was not self-inflicted.

164
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:44,330
What about Mrs. Huber's
bloodstained jewelry?

165
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:48,863
Yeah. That didn't walk
into Mike's garage by itself.

166
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:50,670
Maybe this is a mistake.

167
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:54,577
If there's one thing I've learned,
men can't be trusted.

168
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:58,344
Hold it. Are you saying
that we should put a stop to this?

169
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:03,354
I guess it wouldn't hurt
to sit her down and share our concerns.

170
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,985
- Yeah, we could do that.
- Yeah.

171
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,790
Edie, do you want to be a part of it?

172
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:13,661
Normally I prefer not to get involved.

173
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:17,826
But...

174
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:22,329
if there's any way
that I could help Susan...

175
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:30,547
- We need to talk.
- OK.

176
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:38,018
When I was packing up your stuff in
your bedroom I found a box of bullets.

177
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,557
Oh.

178
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:46,123
Look, I feel bad about Deidre and you
must want to find out who killed her

179
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:49,031
but we can't have this stuff
hanging over us.

180
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,262
You've got to get rid of it. All of it.

181
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:54,932
The file, the map, the gun.
Especially the gun.

182
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:57,942
Leave this to the police.
They're the professionals.

183
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:01,839
What can I say? Um...

184
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:06,883
It seems like a reasonable request.

185
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:12,822
Oh. Really? Well, that was easy.

186
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:19,092
Maybe after lunch we could talk about
your leather beanbag chair.

187
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:41,251
"I realize now
that I've treated you badly."

188
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,754
"I'm the one who needs
to get help, not you."

189
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:47,281
"So I have to go away.
Mrs. Tillman will look out for you."

190
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:51,591
I don't consider it a burden.
You know you're welcome here.

191
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:55,600
"I've left you some things.
I hope you can take comfort in them."

192
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,295
"I got you a new mitt."

193
00:13:57,369 --> 00:14:01,897
"Work on your curve ball while I'm gone.
I love you. Dad."

194
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:05,967
I don't understand. Why wouldn't
he come see me? Why just run away?

195
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:10,038
Your father's been very troubled.
I'm sure he did what he felt was best.

196
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:16,618
And he wants me
to take comfort in this junk?

197
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,214
I hate baseball.
You'd think he'd know that.

198
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,350
Zach...

199
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,967
- Susan's coming.
- OK.

200
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:10,338
OK, guys.
Interventions are never pretty.

201
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,741
Stay strong
'cause she's probably gonna cry.

202
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:14,745
[Doorbell]

203
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:19,682
Ahem.

204
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:26,048
Bonjour. Mwah, mwah.

205
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:32,797
Oh, hi. I didn't know that the cooking
lesson was gonna be a group activity.

206
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:35,527
Well, the more the merrier, right?

207
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,865
As long as no one makes fun
of my crepes.

208
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,531
[Giggling]

209
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:45,437
How come I'm the only one
wearing an apron?

210
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:47,536
It seems like we're ganging up on you

211
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:53,552
but you were moving so fast we thought
a sort of intervention was necessary.

212
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:58,647
I know it's tough to hear.
None of us wanted to do this.

213
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:12,359
I appreciate what you guys
are trying to do. I really do. Um...

214
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:14,736
I'm not gonna change my mind.

215
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:19,105
In my life, I've been hurt a lot.

216
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:23,175
Karl and uh...

217
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,944
Well, it's just taught me to be cynical

218
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:30,477
and expect the absolute worst
from people.

219
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,585
I don't want to live like that any more,

220
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,220
and when Mike asked me
to move in with him,

221
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:42,199
I was just happy, you know,
just ridiculously happy.

222
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:46,397
I still am.
And I want to go with that feeling.

223
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:48,702
I love him and... I love him.

224
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,876
So I'm gonna expect the best from Mike

225
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:55,607
and I know that he is gonna
deliver that in return.

226
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:00,608
- OK?
- Honey.

227
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,853
[Sighs] This is the worst intervention
I have ever been to.

228
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:20,930
This is fun.
It's forever since we had lunch.

229
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:26,535
Well, as happy as I am to see you,
I actually have an agenda.

230
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:30,571
I ran into someone last week
who said you guys are looking to hire.

231
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:32,913
- Is that true?
- Yeah.

232
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:36,079
Are you thinking of coming back?
Because say the word...

233
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:39,852
No, not me.
I was actually thinking more about Tom.

234
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:42,325
Oh. Tom.

235
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:45,795
Yeah, he's been thinking about
making a move for a while.

236
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:48,992
He feels like he's done
everything he can where he is now.

237
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:54,361
Well, Tom's certainly solid.

238
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:58,906
He's more than solid.
Tom's ideas are spectacular.

239
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:04,244
He's passionate about his work. His
visual instincts are off the chart.

240
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:08,844
- Is he as good as you?
- He's apples, I'm oranges.

241
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,287
We excel in different areas.

242
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:14,052
Trust me, you should give Tom a look.

243
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:16,185
I don't need apples.

244
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,695
I need someone like you.

245
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,358
Cutthroat. Ruthless.

246
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:26,029
Oh. Geez, Nat. You make me sound like
some kind of shark.

247
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:29,598
Oh. OK.

248
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:33,802
You know, actually...

249
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:36,575
If that's the kind of exec
you're looking for...

250
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:38,809
You got a shark for me?

251
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:42,149
Yes. A very pretty shark.

252
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:49,545
So here's what I'm thinking.

253
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:54,251
I'm gonna see if Dr. Morrison at the
Lipstone Clinic can come in and consult.

254
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:56,954
You want to bring someone else in?

255
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,726
Your body isn't responding
to the medication the way it should.

256
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,791
The tests we've run
have all come back negative so I...

257
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:08,468
I just want to be on the safe side.

258
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,064
[Pager beps]

259
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:13,168
Will you excuse me? I need to take this.

260
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:24,151
I don't know why

261
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:28,159
but I have this overwhelming feeling
that you're gonna be just fine.

262
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:32,360
Lee Craig has the biggest ego
of any doctor I know.

263
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:36,595
If he wants to consult with someone,
that means he's stumped.

264
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:40,431
- Which means I'm screwed.
- Don't say that.

265
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:43,963
Damn it, Bree, do you understand
what's going on here?

266
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:46,602
I could die.

267
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:54,045
- So could I.
- What?

268
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:57,282
I could walk across the street tomorrow
and be hit by a car.

269
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:05,321
What in God's name is your point?

270
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:11,235
All I'm saying
is that we're both gonna die eventually.

271
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:15,740
In the time that we have left,
whether it's two days or two decades,

272
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:18,105
I think we should
be nice to each other.

273
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:25,547
You're right.

274
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:29,320
[Doorbell]

275
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,314
Um... Miss Tillman.

276
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:35,918
Paul Young's been missing for a couple
of days. Have you seen him?

277
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:38,462
Why ask me?

278
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:43,126
I saw him leave a box on your doorstep.
And I've seen Zach over here.

279
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:46,227
If I did know where Mr. Young was,
why would I tell you?

280
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:53,510
Look, the police think I killed
your sister and I'm sure you do too.

281
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:55,307
But I had nothing to do with it.

282
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,372
And you think Paul Young did.

283
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:01,442
Well...
No, that's not what I was saying.

284
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,455
You gotta admit, it's a neat theory.

285
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:08,091
Care for a snack?

286
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:12,593
So it's not such a stretch.

287
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,859
I wonder if Paul
avenged his wife's death

288
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:19,029
by killing Martha
for blackmailing them.

289
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:22,604
But perhaps I'm alone in that.

290
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:27,668
- You're not.
- Aren't you sweet? Tea?

291
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:29,179
Thanks.

292
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:33,115
Does this say anything about why
she was blackmailing the Youngs?

293
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,279
Not specifically.

294
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:42,123
But I got the definite impression
that it involved a murder,

295
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:45,561
now here you are
saying your friend was murdered.

296
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:53,067
Any reason you haven't
shown these to the police?

297
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:57,507
Are you in favor of the death penalty?

298
00:22:57,576 --> 00:23:00,545
Um... yeah.

299
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:04,378
So am I. We had it in Utah.

300
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:06,849
Not in this state, though.

301
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:12,722
A shame, don't you agree?

302
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,422
Yeah, I do.

303
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:23,658
I like you so much, Mr. Delfino.

304
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:28,897
Do you know where Paul Young is?

305
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:33,339
I'm afraid not.

306
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,674
But I know where he'll be
on Thursday night.

307
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:52,520
That afternoon,
while retrieving her mail,

308
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:57,625
Gabrielle was surprised to finally learn
the truth behind her pregnancy.

309
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:04,435
Very surprised.

310
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:07,273
Babe, you want to go online
and check out strollers?

311
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:12,312
What's going on?

312
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:17,219
I just want to say goodbye,
because I'm leaving you.

313
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,618
What?

314
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:22,785
Our health insurance sent us a letter.

315
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:25,295
Someone ordered
a year's worth of my pills.

316
00:24:25,363 --> 00:24:29,390
Apparently our policy
doesn't cover drugs bought by the kilo.

317
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,595
I told you it was Mama.

318
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:36,733
The prescription was dated. Juanita was
in a coma when this claim was filed.

319
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,435
You did this. Not your mother.

320
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:42,071
At least be man enough to own up to it.
She would have been.

321
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:51,378
- Stop!
- Pregnant, caveman. Remember?

322
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:56,425
- Where are you going?
- Away.

323
00:24:57,429 --> 00:25:00,523
I'm going to jail.
I'll be gone tomorrow.

324
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:03,625
I know.
That's why I only packed one bag.

325
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:07,934
What about the baby, Gabrielle? Huh?
What about my baby?

326
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:11,533
- Oh, your baby?
- Fine. Our baby.

327
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:15,842
We're a family now. This baby needs
its mother and its father.

328
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:20,510
Oh, Carlos.
Who ever said you were the father?

329
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:43,099
Hey.

330
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:47,339
Hey.

331
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:51,411
Hey. What the hell are you doing?

332
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,184
Damn felon!

333
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:12,599
All units, code D 16-30.
Suspect is in violation of house arrest.

334
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:16,732
- Heading west on Park Boulevard.
- This is unit 14. We're on our way.

335
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:20,904
- Looks like the Feds have a runner.
- Let's go.

336
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,713
[Knock on door]

337
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:29,511
[Persistent knocking]

338
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:39,026
- Is John here?
- If I say no will you slap me again?

339
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:42,557
He's working. Why?

340
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:45,364
I just left my husband.

341
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:19,402
[Knock on door]

342
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,769
Hang on.

343
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:35,242
Think just because you mow my lawn,
you can bang my wife?

344
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,096
- Whoa!
- Hey!

345
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:05,848
Hey. What's going on?

346
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:08,385
Tom, I have had the craziest day.

347
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:12,446
This morning the guys from Mitchell
and Kerns call me and offer me a job.

348
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:16,358
- Are you gonna take it?
- I told Peterson about it.

349
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:20,228
He just upped their offer.
He just made me vice president!

350
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,966
- Of what?
- Tom! The firm!

351
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:28,801
He gave me Duggan's old job!
Isn't that wild?!

352
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:32,710
I gotta go tell Scotty.
I'll see you later.

353
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,782
Tom, I was just coming to find you.

354
00:28:41,953 --> 00:28:45,855
What the hell, Dan?
I mean, what the hell?

355
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:48,017
You promoted Annabel over me?

356
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:51,859
She got another job offer.
I couldn't afford to lose her. Not now.

357
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:55,696
Well, guess what. You lose me.
'Cause I quit.

358
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:59,032
- Tom, don't overreact.
- No. The first time you passed me by

359
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:03,700
I took it like a good soldier.
But I have already been doing the job.

360
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:06,266
And then you just hand it to Annabel?

361
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:08,676
OK. You made your point.

362
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:14,108
You make crappy decisions on
a daily basis, Dan, I gotta tell you.

363
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:17,882
- But this one, this is the stupidest.
- Hey, watch yourself.

364
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:21,084
You have been running this company
into the ground.

365
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:22,854
I'm getting out easy.

366
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:26,328
All right. You want to know why
I gave that promotion to Annabel?

367
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:28,797
Why she got the nod instead of you?

368
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:31,959
It was Lynette.

369
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:36,062
- What?
- She went to my wife and begged her

370
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:37,972
to get me to kill your promotion.

371
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:42,103
She said that if you start traveling
more, it's gonna hurt your family.

372
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:44,072
She did that?

373
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:46,709
Now I feel like a chump
for trying to help you.

374
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,276
I guess it was one
of my crappy decisions.

375
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:52,448
Have your desk cleaned out by tonight.

376
00:29:58,229 --> 00:30:00,823
You gonna tell us
what you got against this kid?

377
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:03,800
It's between him and me. And my wife.

378
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:07,463
Is that what this is about?
You doing his wife?

379
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:10,337
No. I'm gay.

380
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:14,402
- You're gay?
- What?

381
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,640
I'm gay.

382
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:18,909
This is not happening again.

383
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:21,349
What do you mean, again?

384
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:25,819
I want a lawyer.

385
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,290
[PA] All baggers to the front.

386
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,793
Got a cleanup on aisle four.
Cleanup on aisle four.

387
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:42,368
George.

388
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,704
Hi. What are you doing here?

389
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:47,540
I'm shopping. Obviously.

390
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:50,274
You live on the other side of town.

391
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:53,442
My friend had an operation.
I'm buying her some things.

392
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:57,477
Oh. That's very nice of you.

393
00:30:57,555 --> 00:31:01,013
Wait. Bree.
I have to tell you something.

394
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:05,790
Well?

395
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:09,630
You need to tell Rex to be more discreet

396
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:13,501
when it comes to
discussing your love life.

397
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:17,801
- I'm sorry?
- I don't want to say anything more.

398
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:21,710
You just really need to tell him that.

399
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:24,907
Wait a minute.
What in the world are you talking about?

400
00:31:27,118 --> 00:31:30,747
I was at the hospital visiting my friend
who had had this operation.

401
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:33,416
I overheard two doctors

402
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:37,860
talking about Rex's fondness for S&M.

403
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:46,864
You heard that?

404
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:51,932
Apparently he told them
he has a box of toys

405
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:57,243
and he gets you to do
very inappropriate things.

406
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:01,910
I see.

407
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:06,013
This is none of my business
and I would have never brought this up

408
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:09,150
but to hear those two men
laughing about you...

409
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:11,525
I just thought you should know.

410
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:16,130
Thank you for telling me
but I think I gotta go.

411
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,279
Hey, got some more boxes.

412
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:46,152
That's your answer to everything
these days.

413
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,323
What do you want to do for dinner?

414
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:52,426
Oh, I can't.
I just got an emergency phone call.

415
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:54,835
- Busted water main.
- OK.

416
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:56,965
I'll keep it warm for you.

417
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:59,771
I'm afraid
I'm gonna be too late for dinner.

418
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:01,903
I wasn't talking about dinner.

419
00:33:16,694 --> 00:33:19,492
- Need some help?
- Uh... no.

420
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:21,361
No, I got it. Um...

421
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:23,127
I got it.

422
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:27,493
So if you have a plumbing emergency,
shouldn't you get going?

423
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:30,200
Oh, I'm just part of the relief crew.

424
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:33,368
Oh. Well, I'll just get back to work.

425
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:44,551
Mom, stalking? Are we really doing this?

426
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:47,455
You just made a huge deal
about how much you trust him.

427
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:50,824
That was before I found
Mrs. Huber's journal in his truck.

428
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,660
So what's in it?

429
00:33:54,732 --> 00:33:58,532
It's not about what's in it, it's about
the fact that he had it at all.

430
00:33:58,603 --> 00:34:03,006
I'd bet you anything he's not going on
a plumbing job and we're gonna find out.

431
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:11,076
Mom... if you don't trust him,
why are you moving in with him?

432
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:17,020
I don't have time to explain
adult relationships to you.

433
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:18,988
Oh, duck down.

434
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:26,227
- I think you lost him.
- He's six cars up.

435
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:28,527
We have to stay back or he'll see us.

436
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:32,763
OK, great, but we can't see him either.
Mom, you're not great at this.

437
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:36,830
Yeah? When your father was cheating
on me I used to follow him all the time.

438
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,570
I know my stuff.

439
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:41,544
There he is.

440
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:47,683
[Julie] What's Mike doing?
Who's he pulling up to?

441
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:50,550
[Susan] I don't know
but I'm gonna find out.

442
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:52,452
Wait here.

443
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:54,684
And lock the doors.

444
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:11,237
What the hell are you up to?
Oh, my God.

445
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:13,834
Wow. Um... OK.

446
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:15,208
Ooh. Wow.

447
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,770
Uh... bye.

448
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:25,619
- Was that your wife?
- If it was, would I be here with you?

449
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,892
- It wasn't Mike, was it?
- No.

450
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,266
No, it wasn't.

451
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:41,737
They're charging you with a hate crime?

452
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:46,575
Do you remember when
our cable guy was beaten up?

453
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:51,010
That was me.

454
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:55,116
I thought you were cheating with him.

455
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:57,484
With our gay cable guy?

456
00:35:57,555 --> 00:35:59,546
I didn't know he was gay.

457
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:02,457
I didn't know Justin was either.

458
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:06,361
Now the cops think
I'm some kind of serial gay basher.

459
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,796
- Well, you sort of are.
- You provoked me!

460
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:16,840
You were pretending to have an affair
just to punish me.

461
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:22,037
Well, obviously.

462
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:26,275
So now I need you to lie again.

463
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:30,286
I need you to tell the cops
you were having an affair

464
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:33,551
and that I just beat up the wrong guy.

465
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:36,818
Guys.

466
00:36:36,894 --> 00:36:38,828
I am not lying for you, Carlos.

467
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:44,632
Gabby, if this charge sticks,
I get sent away for eight years.

468
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,465
Am I supposed to be impressed?

469
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,869
Because of your stunt with my pills,

470
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,841
I've lost my freedom
for the next 18 years.

471
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:57,270
Gabby, please don't do this.

472
00:36:57,348 --> 00:37:00,977
Gabby, don't walk away!

473
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:05,346
Gabby!

474
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:06,913
[Sighs]

475
00:37:08,192 --> 00:37:11,559
OK, next time I won't bring my daughter
to stalk my boyfriend.

476
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:14,097
It was a slight error in judgment.

477
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:19,260
Honey, please don't give me
the silent treatment.

478
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:21,737
I'm not.

479
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:25,708
- Did you say you read this?
- Part of it. Why?

480
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:31,342
Mrs. Huber was blackmailing Zach's mom.

481
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,699
- [Twigs break]
- Zach?

482
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:22,326
What are you doing up?

483
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:28,697
I couldn't sleep so I was just...
sitting here.

484
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:30,468
Thinking.

485
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,437
About what?

486
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:40,311
Do you really want to know?

487
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:45,788
Bree, I'm not feeling too hot right now
so just tell me.

488
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:47,915
What's up?

489
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:52,760
I was thinking that
the biggest mistake of my entire life

490
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,525
was agreeing to marry you.

491
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:02,300
Let me guess. I've done something wrong.

492
00:39:04,575 --> 00:39:07,806
Forcing me to share in
your depraved pastime wasn't enough,

493
00:39:07,878 --> 00:39:10,847
you had to share my humiliation
with your co-workers?

494
00:39:12,216 --> 00:39:13,945
- What?
- Rex.

495
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,782
Everybody is talking about our sex life.

496
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:18,788
Every sordid little detail,

497
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:21,620
right down to that
box of perversions in the closet.

498
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:24,354
I never said anything to anyone.
I swear to God.

499
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:26,293
- You're a liar.
- Who told you this?

500
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:30,027
- Doesn't matter.
- It does. I never said anything.

501
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:32,569
How do people know?
I wouldn't say anything.

502
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:34,866
Why would I talk about
what we do in bed?

503
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:37,464
I don't know, Rex.
Maybe you were bragging.

504
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:40,567
Or maybe you just subconsciously
wanted to hurt me.

505
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:44,136
Well, congratulations. You did it.
I am officially destroyed.

506
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:47,548
- I didn't say anything.
- I don't believe you.

507
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:51,578
Ow.

508
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:56,223
Ow.

509
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:59,319
Rex? What? What is it?

510
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:04,365
I think I'm having a heart attack.

511
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:09,472
No, you're not.

512
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,270
Bree, you're gonna have to take me
to the hospital.

513
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:21,548
Um... All right. You go downstairs

514
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:24,952
and um... I will be...
I'll be right there.

515
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:46,403
Daddy? What are you doing?

516
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:51,547
I'm waiting for your mother
to take me to the Emergency Room.

517
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:55,210
- What's wrong?
- I'm having a heart attack.

518
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,584
Oh, my God. Where is she?

519
00:40:57,655 --> 00:41:00,818
That's a good question.

520
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:08,096
- Daddy's having a heart attack.
- I know. I'm taking him to hospital.

521
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,230
Well, when?

522
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:14,967
When I finish making the bed.

523
00:41:16,073 --> 00:41:17,335
What?

524
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:22,141
I never leave the house
with an unmade bed. You know that.

525
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:24,943
But Daddy needs to go to the hospital.

526
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:30,080
There. Now we can go.

527
00:41:41,565 --> 00:41:44,466
Nothing is forever.

528
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:49,268
And the time comes when we all must
say goodbye to the world we knew.

529
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:56,839
Goodbye to everything
we had taken for granted.

530
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:06,252
Goodbye to those
we thought would never abandon us.

531
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:15,089
And when these changes finally do occur,

532
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:19,759
when the familiar has departed,

533
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:23,295
and the unfamiliar has taken its place,

534
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:28,806
all any of us can really do

535
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:31,109
is to say hello...

536
00:42:32,149 --> 00:42:33,741
and welcome.
