2
00:00:01,034 --> 00:00:02,865
Previously on Desperate Housewives...

3
00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:05,427
I am just trying to move on
with my life.

4
00:00:05,538 --> 00:00:07,335
Are you sleeping with my husband?

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,431
Suspicion ended in tragedy.

6
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:12,067
I'm here to see Rex Van De Kamp.
He had a heart attack.

7
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:14,409
- Trust...
- It kills me to put you through this.

8
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:15,914
...was put on trial.

9
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:18,280
Find the passport
and Mr. Solis can see his mother.

10
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:21,354
- An ex-husband...
- You walked out on your family.

11
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:22,614
...was replaced.

12
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:26,022
She is out there
throwing herself at Mike Delfino.

13
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:27,593
And everyone...

14
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,821
Your own personal nanny? Smell you.

15
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:33,559
...was getting in over their heads.

16
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:43,203
Edie Britt could never understand
why she didn't have any female friends.

17
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:49,178
Of course, she always tried
to tell people she didn't ned any.

18
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:54,744
But the truth was it bothered Edie that
other women didn't sem to like her.

19
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:58,253
Even after moving to Wisteria Lane...

20
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:00,189
There are breakables in there.

21
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:04,389
...Edie couldn't understand why
her neighbors kept their distance.

22
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,467
And then she met Martha Huber.

23
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,594
Hola!

24
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:16,108
Within five minutes Mrs. Huber managed
to disparage what Edie was wearing.

25
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:17,233
No.

26
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,577
In fact, whenever they got together,
Mrs. Huber insulted her.

27
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:27,177
She made fun of everything
from Edie's make-up...

28
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,448
...to her taste in men.

29
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:34,892
Yes, Martha Huber could be cruel,
offensive and downright mean.

30
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:40,129
But Edie didn't care,
because she was the first real friend

31
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,294
Edie Britt had ever had.

32
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:48,938
But now Martha Huber was missing.
She had vanished without a trace.

33
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:53,502
And Edie was not embarrassed
to admit she neded her back.

34
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:57,039
- Edie?
- Yes.

35
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,448
I'm Felicia Tillman.

36
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,044
- Martha's sister.
- Really?

37
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:05,022
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.

38
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:08,253
It's just Martha always said
how alike you two were.

39
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:10,592
I don't see the family resemblance.

40
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:13,860
It's there. It just takes a while
to become apparent.

41
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:19,371
- Do you have the key to her house?
- I do.

42
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:23,670
After the police kicked the door in,
they put on this temporary lock.

43
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:26,802
Oh, and the neighbors
are coming over at noon.

44
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:29,541
We're going to organize
and hand out flyers.

45
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:34,115
- The key?
- Oh, right.

46
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:37,054
I can only imagine
how worried you must be.

47
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:40,923
I'm not worried, Edie. Martha and I
have a very intense bond.

48
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:43,427
We were connected at a primal level.

49
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,899
A few days ago
I felt this sensation in my soul.

50
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:51,266
It dawned on me that something
had happened to my sister.

51
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:54,397
Then when she didn't arrive
at my home as scheduled,

52
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:57,408
well, that's when I knew
she was dead.

53
00:02:57,477 --> 00:03:00,412
Oh, honey, no.
You mustn't think like that.

54
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:06,008
- Martha's only missing.
- No, Edie. She's dead.

55
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:11,614
But she's my sister and I'm going to
find out exactly what happened to her.

56
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:17,086
Look, Felicia, it's natural to
freak out when a loved one's missing.

57
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:19,393
Loved one?

58
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:23,561
Oh, Edie, let me be clear about this.

59
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:28,596
I hated Martha.
She was a wretched pig of a woman.

60
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:32,166
The day she died,
this world became a better place.

61
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:37,478
It was in that moment that Edie
finally saw the family resemblance.

62
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,795
Mrs. Huber was missing.

63
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:28,196
The words echoed down Wisteria Lane

64
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:32,295
until every last resident
was aware of her disappearance.

65
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:35,738
By noon, dozens of neighbors
had gathered.

66
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:39,835
Some came to volunter.
Some came in sympathy.

67
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:44,610
And some came to learn
exactly what the police knew...

68
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:47,346
and what they didn't.

69
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,981
I'll need you to pass out flyers.
Put 'em in the mall, the park.

70
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,718
Anywhere Mrs. Huber
might have been seen.

71
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:56,920
We need to jump on this.
Time is of the essence.

72
00:04:57,997 --> 00:05:01,023
Edie, would you like to say something?

73
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:05,628
On behalf of Martha
and her sister, Felicia...

74
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:08,468
I'd like to thank you all
for coming here today.

75
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:14,377
You know, my last conversation
with Martha was one of anger,

76
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:18,110
and I'll never forgive myself
for the things that I said.

77
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:21,312
I lay awake at night
thinking about it.

78
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:25,014
[Sobbing]

79
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:31,388
I don't know how, but Edie managed
to make this all about her.

80
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:34,991
- She's a talented girl, Edie.
- Has anybody talked to Bree?

81
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:38,037
- How's Rex?
- She's bringing him home today.

82
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:41,267
I don't know how he had a heart attack.
He was so young.

83
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:44,774
- How creepy is Mrs. Huber's sister?
- [Lynette] I know.

84
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:48,245
She was talking about Mrs. Huber
like she was already dead.

85
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:52,011
- You don't think she's...?
- No, I'm sure she's fine.

86
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:54,245
Mrs. Huber's like a roach.

87
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,916
Everyone on Wisteria Lane is praying
for your sister's safe return.

88
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:03,561
I seriously doubt that.

89
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:12,270
[Danielle] You're not
taking care of him?

90
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,239
Dad's gotta have a place to recuperate.

91
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:18,766
He can go to a motel.
He's not allowed back in my house.

92
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,472
You two were getting along.
What happened?

93
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:24,846
That's... between your father and me.

94
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:29,479
You're selfish. I am so looking forward
to putting you in a nursing home.

95
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:34,083
I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I plan
to have an embolism and to die young.

96
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,357
- You might not be so lucky.
- Andrew...

97
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:42,093
Know how long I can hold a grudge?
Abandon my father and you'll be sorry.

98
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:44,796
You wouldn't say that
if you knew what...

99
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:47,396
Knew what? Come on, tell me.

100
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:52,035
I'd love to know what my father did
that was so awful.

101
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:55,376
Fine. I will see him through this,
but after that,

102
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:58,245
your father can rot in hell
for all I care.

103
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:04,719
We're not like other families, are we?

104
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,783
No, we're not.

105
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:11,091
It's not my fault
that your bank accounts are frozen.

106
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:13,665
I'm not saying it's your fault.
Just fix it.

107
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:17,361
The folks at the Justice Department
aren't very sympathetic.

108
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,939
I'm running out of money.
I'm gonna be screwed.

109
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:23,066
Why don't you hock some jewelry?

110
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:27,202
There's a lot of stuff
you never wear and most of it's ugly.

111
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:30,339
Don't you have a toilet to scrub?

112
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,850
God, I'm just so angry with Carlos.

113
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:36,616
What was he thinking,
exporting goods made from slave labor?

114
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,554
Why couldn't he have embezzled?

115
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:41,558
They want to make sure
he doesn't skip the country.

116
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:45,722
If he's released on bail, I can argue
that he needs money to live on,

117
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:49,029
and they'll unfreeze
one of the smaller accounts.

118
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:51,899
They won't release him
without the passport.

119
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:55,338
Exactly. You haven't
found that yet, have you?

120
00:07:56,509 --> 00:08:00,570
Gabrielle wanted
her old lifestyle back, no question.

121
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:06,414
But she wanted Carlos to suffer
for his betrayal even more.

122
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,818
I'm still searching.

123
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:11,856
You might wanna think
about looking for a job.

124
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:14,017
Ha!

125
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,388
- I had a good time.
- I bet you did.

126
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:21,126
- [Doorbell]
- [Mike laughs]

127
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,634
- Oh.
- [Doorbell]

128
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:24,931
Gotcha!

129
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:29,032
- Hey. Is this a bad time?
- For you? Of course it is.

130
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:31,406
Cute. Tax stuff.
I need your signature.

131
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:34,605
- We've been divorced over a year.
- 2003.

132
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:37,683
Well, please, just come on in.

133
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:41,686
Mike, I don't think you've officially
met my ex, Karl Mayer.

134
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:45,087
- Hey. Mike Delfino.
- Right. The plumber.

135
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:48,384
I don't have the right washer,

136
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:52,056
so I'm just gonna go on across
the street and get it.

137
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:59,361
- So he seems OK.
- Yeah, he is.

138
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:03,602
So, what do you want me to sign?
Oh, I see.

139
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:06,803
By the way, Julie told me
about her birthday plans.

140
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:11,213
We're going to a restaurant downtown.
A guy who plays piano and open mic.

141
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:14,617
Julie got a bunch
of her girlfriends together.

142
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:17,815
- Julie loves to sing. It sounds nice.
- Here you go.

143
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:20,916
- All righty.
- Give my best to Brandi.

144
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:24,554
Actually, um...
we're not together any more.

145
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,723
You're not? What happened?

146
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,131
I... caught her in bed
with another guy.

147
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,331
Go ahead. Do your happy dance.

148
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:38,206
No, no, really. I'm sorry
that you had to go through that. I am.

149
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:43,639
Uh...

150
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:46,479
It's just really hard for me right now.

151
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,715
Thanks.

152
00:09:56,329 --> 00:10:01,596
Um, try ripping up
old photos. It helps.

153
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:07,504
Well, have fun this weekend.
Let me know how the party goes.

154
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:12,708
Karl, do you want to join us?

155
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,809
Susan...

156
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:22,816
You're the best.

157
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:27,188
Oh, well... yeah.
I'm the best, aren't I?

158
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:39,094
Are we gonna buy a water heater?
We could go to the mall tomorrow.

159
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:43,039
- Can we talk about this tomorrow?
- I'm just trying to plan my day.

160
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,633
Please, honey. I'm so tired.

161
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:49,346
OK.

162
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:02,351
[Lynette] Hon, did you set up
the coffee maker?

163
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:08,263
Oh, no. I'll do it in the morning.
I promise I'll get up early and do it.

164
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:11,303
- Tom.
- [Groans]

165
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,531
Tom?

166
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:15,369
Come on.

167
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:19,937
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

168
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,568
- Claire?!
- [Gasps]

169
00:11:56,048 --> 00:12:01,008
I'm, uh... Wow, I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were up.

170
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:06,918
Yeah, I thought you were sleeping.
I was just going upstairs.

171
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:12,931
- Do you want me to make the coffee?
- Yeah. Yeah, that'd be great. [laughs]

172
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:17,492
I'm just going to, you know,
go back up to my room.

173
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,663
- OK.
- All right.

174
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:24,406
- Night.
- Good night.

175
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:30,782
If we go to the mall,
we can go to the shoe store.

176
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,580
You said you wanted new running shoes.

177
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:38,779
What?

178
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:40,723
Oh.

179
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:44,094
Oh. [giggles]

180
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:55,772
The next morning, while the search
for Martha Huber continued,

181
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:58,605
Lynette discovered
a little family secret,

182
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:01,077
one she wasn't even looking for.

183
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:03,443
- Good morning.
- Morning.

184
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:06,314
- Want some coffee?
- Yeah, thanks.

185
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:10,384
I didn't want to come down
till Tom left for work.

186
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:14,290
- I'm still a little embarrassed.
- About what?

187
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:16,520
He didn't tell you?

188
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,393
Well, actually it's kinda funny.

189
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:23,026
I was doing some laundry,
and I noticed the robe I was wearing

190
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:26,003
had some baby food on it,
so I threw it in,

191
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:29,506
figuring I could dash upstairs
while everyone was asleep,

192
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:33,807
and then I ran into Tom...
while I was totally naked.

193
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:43,177
And so, Claire,
when did this... incident occur?

194
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:46,254
I don't know. It was pretty late.

195
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:50,887
I think he might have come down
to make coffee or something.

196
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:53,158
You don't say.

197
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:55,826
Wow. Wow.

198
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:01,170
This is certainly impressive. I can
definitely get you work as a model.

199
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,404
You realize it's different from
the work you did in New York and Milan?

200
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:12,383
Of course. I made $10,000 a day.
I don't expect to make that here.

201
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:16,215
- That's good, because you won't.
- Yeah. So, what have you got?

202
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,517
Well, there is something.

203
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:22,253
They need a model to demonstrate
the new Buick LaCrosse

204
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,454
at the Fairview Mall.

205
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,499
It's just you and the car
on a revolving platform.

206
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,659
300 bucks for the day.

207
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:34,961
- Uh, what else do you have?
- Sure.

208
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:38,874
Um... Ooh. Can you swing a sword?

209
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:43,813
Sci-fi convention needs someone
to dress up as a warrior princess.

210
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,716
A warrior princess?

211
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:51,154
Mr. Gibb, I am a professional model.

212
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:54,522
Look at this bone structure.
This face is a cash cow.

213
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:58,586
And if you don't have the vision,
then maybe I'm at the wrong agency.

214
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:02,724
Look, honey, I'm the only modeling
agent in a hundred-mile radius.

215
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:05,702
I book women for boat shows
and garden-tool expos.

216
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:09,433
If you don't like it,
move back to the city.

217
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:18,444
This, um, Buick thing,
does it include lunch?

218
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:27,754
Just so you know, I really am grateful
for everything you're doing for me.

219
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,919
I don't need your gratitude.

220
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:33,624
You're here because your children
are master extortionists.

221
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:36,428
- You didn't tell 'em about...
- Your adultery?

222
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:39,903
No, I decided to keep
that little gem all to myself.

223
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:42,405
I know this is a real imposition...

224
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:45,341
It is. The doctor said
you could be here for weeks.

225
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:49,904
Would it make you feel any better
if I told you I'm sorry for what I did?

226
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:53,349
Yes, it would...
if I still felt anything for you.

227
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:56,421
But as it stands,
the place you occupied in my heart

228
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:59,252
is very much empty now.

229
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:01,953
You must still feel something for me.

230
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:06,387
- And why do you think that?
- Come on, Bree. Look at this.

231
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:11,334
The good china, freshly pressed
napkins, flowers from the garden.

232
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:13,803
This tray was prepared
with loving care.

233
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:15,806
Do me a favor, Rex.

234
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:20,072
Please don't mistake my anal
retentiveness for actual affection.

235
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,885
Hold on a sec.

236
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,664
- [Mike laughs]
- OK. Now I'm good.

237
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:45,659
- What?
- You're just... God, I love you.

238
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,766
Oh.

239
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:53,333
Well... that's great.

240
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:55,811
Wait, look. That just kinda popped out.

241
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:59,543
No, no, it's fine.
It just kinda caught me off guard.

242
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:03,520
- I mean, I wanna say it back...
- Yeah, but you're not ready. It's OK.

243
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:06,023
- You're not mad, are you?
- No. God.

244
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:10,425
We haven't been dating that long
and you've got other issues. I get it.

245
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:14,998
What kind of issues
do you think I have?

246
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:18,093
I retract my earlier statement.
I no longer love you.

247
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,603
- I just think of you as a good buddy.
- No.

248
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:24,039
You obviously think you have
some insight into my soul,

249
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:26,077
so go ahead, dazzle me.

250
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:30,877
- Your divorce left you vulnerable.
- Big insight. The postman knows that.

251
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:34,419
And there's a chance
you still have feelings for your ex.

252
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,852
What? [laughs]

253
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:40,517
I loathe Karl. And the postman
will back me up on that, too.

254
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:42,685
I'm sure part of you does hate him,

255
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:45,389
but maybe part of you
is still hung up on him.

256
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:47,556
Where are you getting this?

257
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:49,965
He broke up with the woman
he left you for

258
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:54,665
and the first thing you did was
hugged him and invited him to a party.

259
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:59,939
OK. The analysis part
of this evening is now over.

260
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:05,611
- Hey... you asked.
- Well, you know what?

261
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:09,347
You're gonna come to Julie's party
and see Karl and I together,

262
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,857
and you're gonna understand
that I have no feelings for him.

263
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:16,792
- I have tickets to a basketball game.
- You're coming to the party.

264
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:19,295
This is what I get
for saying "I love you".

265
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:22,060
- What?
- [Mumbles] Nothing.

266
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,700
- Thanks.
- Hello, George.

267
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:29,103
Mrs. Van De Kamp.
You're looking lovely.

268
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:33,941
- You always say the nicest things.
- Well, it's, uh... it's true.

269
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:39,211
Oh. Listen, I have a prescription here
for Rex. He had a heart attack.

270
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:42,117
- I had no idea. Is he OK?
- Yes, he'll live.

271
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:47,591
But the doctor says he's at risk
for something called pericarditis.

272
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:52,619
It's an inflammation of the membrane
that surrounds the heart.

273
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:56,065
- He'll need constant care.
- So I hear.

274
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:59,262
As the words "constant care"
echoed in her head,

275
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:00,396
[coughing]

276
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,839
Bre caught a sickening glimpse
into her future...

277
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,543
OK, here we go.

278
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:10,240
...which prompted her to sek
an old-fashioned remedy.

279
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,975
George, would you
go out to dinner with me?

280
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:19,046
- Um, you mean like a date?
- Yes. I think it would be fun.

281
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:21,592
What about your husband?

282
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,094
Oh, him.

283
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:27,826
Well, we're... separated.

284
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,635
In spite of Mrs. Huber's disappearance,

285
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,005
life on Wisteria Lane
started to return to normal,

286
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:44,811
until an intriguing discovery was made
on a dirt road next to the interstate.

287
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:50,553
I have an abandoned vehicle registered
to a missing person, one Martha Huber.

288
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,715
Please advise.

289
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:57,485
As news spread
of this mysterious development,

290
00:19:57,563 --> 00:20:01,795
everyone in the neighborhood
decided to band together

291
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:06,770
to show their support,
and to look for clues, or worse.

292
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,033
I'm keeping my eyes on the horizon.

293
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:11,575
Tell me if I am about to step
on a body part.

294
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:14,703
It's a search and rescue.
We don't know if she's dead.

295
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:17,145
People fake abductions all the time.

296
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,912
Can we talk about
something less depressing?

297
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:23,011
Well, here's something.
Mike told me he loved me.

298
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:25,989
- Oh, my God!
- Over here! They found the body!

299
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,686
I'm sorry, false alarm.
We didn't find a body.

300
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,854
Ah, Susan just had
some really good news.

301
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:35,492
- Sorry.
- [Man] False alarm.

302
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:40,071
Well, doesn't that figure? Susan always
finds a way to make it about her.

303
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:47,202
Ladies and gentleman, I present
to you the fabulous Buick LaCrosse.

304
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,941
[Microphone feedback]

305
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:55,745
It has an expertly crafted interior,

306
00:20:56,989 --> 00:21:01,926
peaceful Quiet Tuning
and ultrasonic rear parking assist.

307
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:05,258
Observe the remote activation feature.

308
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,832
[Two bleeps, car starts]

309
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,467
[Gasps] Ah...

310
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:15,267
And it also has a lot of
other exciting, good, cool car things.

311
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:36,519
Tom! Lynette!
What are you doing here?

312
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:39,290
Buying a new water heater.
How about you?

313
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:41,457
Just doing a little shopping.

314
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:44,057
Gaby, you need help? You're stuck.

315
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,104
- I guess I am.
- I got it.

316
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:48,639
Guess I got too close to the turntable.

317
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:51,835
- I'm a sucker for these Buicks.
- Come on, you bastard!

318
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:53,001
[Ripping]

319
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:58,072
With their perfectly crafted interior
and peaceful Quiet Tuning.

320
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,278
Uh-huh. A little formal for the mall.

321
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:06,619
Oh! You know, I... I wanted to match
the shoes to the dress.

322
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:14,222
This is Sarah, my shopping buddy.
We like to hit the boutiques together.

323
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:20,563
OK. Well, you gals, um, shop
your little hearts out. See you later.

324
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:22,731
Bye!

325
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:27,039
[Sighs]

326
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:35,716
Wow. Look at you. You going out?

327
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:39,655
Not that it's any of your business,
but, um, I have a date.

328
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:41,818
A date? What kind of date?

329
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:44,896
I don't want to say anything

00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:04,631
As God is my witness,
it will snow on the hills of hell

495
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:07,542
before I ever feel sorry for you again!

497
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:24,358
As the police interviewed
the residents of Wisteria Lane

498
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:28,160
about the mysterious disappearance
of Martha Huber,

499
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:31,963
my husband Paul reasoned
it would only be a matter of time

500
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:35,938
before their digging
would begin to yield answers.

501
00:34:57,662 --> 00:35:00,324
Since he knew
the police had no suspects...

502
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:07,531
...he decided to point them
towards the most logical candidate.

503
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:16,146
You se, if there's one thing
Paul understood about the suburbs,

504
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:18,580
it was this:

505
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:22,278
No one's ever more suspicious

506
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:26,881
than a new neighbor
who's just moved in.

507
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:34,358
- Parker's getting sniffly.
- Yeah, I noticed that too.

508
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:36,730
I hope he's not
coming down with a cold.

509
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:42,637
He doesn't have a cough yet, but he has
this post nasal drip thing happening.

510
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:45,005
I'll make an appointment for him.

511
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:48,340
I always say
it is better to be safe than sorry.

512
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:52,643
Little kids get sick,
and it's, sorry, out of control.

513
00:35:56,087 --> 00:36:01,286
[Faint] And kids with these colds,
it's just a vicious cycle.

514
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,665
Um, Claire?

[Rustling papers]

516
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:24,581
We have to make some changes.

517
00:36:27,718 --> 00:36:29,379
[Andrew] What are you doing?

518
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:32,820
Packing up your father's things
for when he moves out.

519
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:35,415
Here, let me help you.

520
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:40,762
Look, I talked to Dad,

521
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:43,959
and it turns out
you were telling the truth.

522
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:49,935
Andrew, I'm so sorry
that I said anything.

523
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:53,807
No, I'm glad you did. Now I know.

524
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:56,937
There comes this point
in every boy's life.

525
00:36:57,048 --> 00:37:00,017
What? Find out his dad's
screwing around?

526
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:03,753
No. That his father's only human.

527
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:08,049
So why are you taking care of him?

528
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:11,993
Because of what Danielle and I said?
Because you can forget that.

529
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,691
- I'll help take his stuff out.
- That's sweet.

530
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:18,565
But I'm taking care of him
because it's the right thing to do.

531
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:21,297
Why are you being
such a pushover?

532
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:24,568
I mean, he cheated on you. He's a jerk.

533
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:30,274
Andrew, you will not speak that way
about your father in front of me.

534
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:33,806
Why the hell not? I mean,
for once I'm actually on your side.

535
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:36,978
Yes, I'm angry with him.
I am gonna divorce him.

536
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:39,454
I may even marry somebody else,

537
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:43,289
but your father is and always will be
the love of my life.

538
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:48,760
He gave me
the best 18-year marriage that...

539
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:52,727
...I could have ever hoped for.

540
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,407
And for that you will respect him.

541
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:01,570
OK.

542
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:24,558
- What is it? I'm really, really busy.
- I came by to apologize.

543
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:29,868
Oh. Well, in that case, come on in.
I'm not doing anything.

544
00:38:33,277 --> 00:38:37,043
I can't believe
Edie brought the whole thing up.

545
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:41,983
Susan, I am so sorry.
I... I thought I was done hurting you.

546
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:44,112
Yeah, me too.

547
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:50,492
And just so you know,
I'm... sorry for flipping out.

548
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:52,892
I shouldn't let you
get to me like that.

549
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,594
- What?
- I do still get to you, don't I?

550
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:01,604
That's the difference
between the plumber and me.

551
00:39:01,706 --> 00:39:05,233
Don't get me wrong,
he's a good guy. I like him.

552
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:08,506
But I'm betting you two
don't have what we had together.

553
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:11,445
There was always a spark between us.

554
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:13,346
A spark?

555
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:17,512
Look, what I'm trying to say is
he must seem really safe after me.

556
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:20,556
A moray eel would seem safe after you.

557
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:27,693
That's what I'm talking about, that
great back and forth, joking around.

558
00:39:27,765 --> 00:39:31,098
We used to argue
and push each other's buttons.

559
00:39:31,168 --> 00:39:33,602
Newsflash: I hated all of that.

560
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:37,971
Come on. You have to admit,
when it was good, it was the best.

561
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:41,537
What are you saying?

562
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:45,548
Let's give this another shot.

563
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:48,744
- You want me back?
- Yeah.

564
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:53,984
Yeah. I realize now
that you were the woman...

565
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:58,295
...that was meant for me.

566
00:39:58,362 --> 00:40:00,455
Wow.

567
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:05,262
Just so we're clear,
so you want to move back in here

568
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:09,739
and be faithful to me and love me
with all your heart and soul?

569
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:14,977
- Absolutely.
- Oh, my God, this is so wonderful.

570
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:17,343
Yeah. I know, I know.

571
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:22,382
- I wanna kiss you.
- Oh, God. No, Karl.

572
00:40:22,486 --> 00:40:26,217
No. What I meant by wonderful
is that I wondered inside

573
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:30,420
if I still had feelings for you,
if deep down I still loved you.

574
00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:35,022
- And?
- And... [laughs] There's nothing there.

575
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:40,001
- Come on, you've gotta feel something.
- Well, actually, I do. Yeah.

576
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:44,165
Excuse me. Oh, boy! [laughs]

577
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:02,720
- Susan.
- Mike, guess what? I love you.

578
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:06,092
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

579
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:17,070
- Did I come at a bad time?
- They're just asking about Mrs. Huber.

580
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:21,843
I love him.
You can write that in your little book.

581
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:28,180
We are all searching for someone,

582
00:41:28,252 --> 00:41:33,815
that special person who will provide us
what's missing in our lives.

583
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:36,121
Someone who can offer companionship.

584
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:39,355
George? Hi, it's me, Bree.

585
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:44,089
I was wondering,
are you free next Saturday?

586
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,830
You are? Oh, that's wonderful.

587
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:48,337
Or assistance.

588
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:52,374
Hi, I understand
your agency handles nannies.

589
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:56,776
I need someone experienced
and preferably unattractive.

590
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:00,416
Or security.

591
00:42:00,484 --> 00:42:03,612
Hi, honey. Did the lawyer
tell you the good news?

592
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:08,021
You're gonna make bail.
I found your passport.

593
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:12,859
And sometimes, if we search very hard,
we can find someone who provides us...

594
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:15,763
I just called to say hi,
and I love you.

595
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:17,733
...with all thre.

596
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:21,134
All right, all right. Enough already.

597
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:28,378
Yes, we're all searching for someone.

598
00:42:28,445 --> 00:42:34,441
And if we can't find them,
we can only pray they find us.

599
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:36,611
What you got, boy?
