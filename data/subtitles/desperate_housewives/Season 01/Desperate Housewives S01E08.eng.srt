2
00:00:01,034 --> 00:00:02,968
Previously on Desperate Housewives...

3
00:00:03,069 --> 00:00:05,663
- I want to move this place fast.
- I'll call you.

4
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:06,864
Edie, wait!

5
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:10,307
...incomprehensible that Edie Britt
would try to destroy us.

6
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,106
For five grand she's hurt,
ten grand she's gone.

7
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,840
Some neighbors hired help.

8
00:00:14,914 --> 00:00:18,145
How can I pull off a formal dinner
with no warning?

9
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:20,448
And some helped themselves.

10
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,012
- I hate that she watches us.
- Some just couldn't stop.

11
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,580
Smile, Gabrielle.

12
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:29,526
And one... didn't stop in time.

13
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:33,693
- Andrew, I need your help, honey.
- Mama?

14
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:39,072
There is a widely read book
that tells us everyone is a sinner.

15
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:42,098
There is a widely read book
that tells us everyone is a sinner.

16
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,472
Of course,
not everyone who reads this book

17
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:47,273
fels guilt over the bad things they do.

18
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:49,907
But Bre Van De Kamp did.

19
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:54,282
In fact, Bre had spent
most of her life feling guilty.

20
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:58,881
As a child, she felt guilty
about not getting straight As.

21
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:04,790
As a tenager, she felt guilty about
letting her boyfriend go to second base.

22
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:09,698
As a newlywed, she felt guilty
about taking thre weks

23
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:12,169
to get out her thank-you cards.

24
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:14,763
But she knew
the transgressions of her past

25
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:18,469
were nothing compared with
the sin she was about to commit.

26
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:21,274
Can't we just tell the police
it was an accident?

27
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:23,872
This wasn't some simple D.U.I.

28
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:27,248
Not only was Andrew drinking,
he left the scene of the crime.

29
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:30,254
- That makes it a hit-and-run.
- I could go to Canada.

30
00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:33,348
Till the statute of limitations is up.

31
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,861
You think Mom and Day will pay
for you to go moose hunting?

32
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,024
If Carlos' mother dies,
there is no statute of limitations.

33
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:41,895
- Because it's murder.
- Shut up!

34
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:46,132
- You shut up.
- It was an accident!

35
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:50,874
We have to get rid of the car.

36
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:01,013
But we can't sell it. The police might
find it and there could be D.N.A.

37
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,021
We'll take it to a bad part of town,

38
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:06,388
leave the keys in the ignition
and the doors unlocked.

39
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,155
If the police don't find it
we'll get the insurance

40
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:12,687
and if they do,
it wasn't in our possession.

41
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:16,064
Anyone could have hit Mrs. Solis.

42
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,299
That sounds good.

43
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:21,532
Bree, are you sure?

44
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:25,135
Our son could spend the rest of his life
in jail. I won't allow that.

45
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:28,703
Bre knew what
she was about to do was wrong.

46
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,316
But like most sinners, she would
worry about her guilt tomorrow.

47
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:33,080
But like most sinners, she would
worry about her guilt tomorrow.

48
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,815
Everybody should go wash up.

49
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,216
We're having pancakes for breakfast.

50
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,200
Not since my own suicide

51
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:29,105
had violence intruded upon
the serenity of life on Wisteria Lane

52
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,370
in such a conspicuous fashion.

53
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:35,175
Nedless to say,
my friends attacked the problem head-on.

54
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:39,514
Lynette brought the broom,
Susan brought the trash bags,

55
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:42,885
and Bre brought
the industrial strength solvent.

56
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:45,481
Whoo. That stuff is strong.

57
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:48,321
It has to be.
I don't want Gabrielle and Carlos

58
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:52,421
coming home to this ugly reminder
in front of their house.

59
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:56,593
- Has anyone been over there?
- Julie and I went over this morning.

60
00:03:56,703 --> 00:04:00,730
- How's Juanita doing?
- She's in a coma.

61
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:03,401
Nobody knows when
or even if she'll wake up.

62
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:06,205
This is awful.
Carlos must be just devastated.

63
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:09,407
I hope she wakes up
and tells us who was driving that car.

64
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:12,040
We can only hope.

65
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:17,146
Slow down, you jerk!
This is a residential neighborhood!

66
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,649
That's quite a pitching arm.

67
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:25,164
I've got four kids. I was up all night
reading statistics online.

68
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:29,258
One out of every four traffic accidents
happens on residential streets.

69
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:33,135
I hope whoever hit Juanita
gets put away for life.

70
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:35,969
Don't you think
that's a little bit extreme?

71
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:40,034
An innocent woman gets hit by a car and
the driver takes off? It's not extreme.

72
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,017
You should go home and get some rest.
Eat something.

73
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:53,650
You have messages from work.
Tanaka called. Said it was urgent.

74
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:57,492
- I can stay here with your mother.
- I need to be here if she wakes up.

75
00:04:57,597 --> 00:05:00,157
You can't go on like this.

76
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:04,294
And what if she dies? People slip into
comas all the time and never come out.

77
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:07,362
Don't say that.
We need to stay positive.

78
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:11,338
- Mr. And Mrs. Solis.
- John.

79
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:16,546
- Is it OK if I come in?
- Of course.

80
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:27,618
Mr. Solis, I'm so sorry this happened.

81
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:30,822
It means a lot that you came.

82
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:45,810
I think I'm gonna go down
to the chapel and pray.

83
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:48,210
- You wanna come?
- Um...

84
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:50,908
No. I think I will stay here with Mama.

85
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:58,748
- Is it all right if I come?
- Course.

86
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,190
We need all the prayers we can get.

87
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,435
Mrs. Solis,
it's time for her sponge bath.

88
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,337
Come again?

89
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:20,277
Sometimes family members prefer to
administer sponge baths themselves.

90
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:24,848
I think I'll pass.

91
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:32,223
Martha.

92
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:36,719
- Where's your purse?
- Over there. Why?

93
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:47,532
- What are you doing?
- Taking back the $40 you stole.

94
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:48,174
- Edie!
- I know you did it. Hand it over!

95
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:50,438
- Edie!
- I know you did it. Hand it over!

96
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:53,410
I have taken nothing from your purse.

97
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:57,472
If you're missing money, I'd ask one
of those men you parade through here.

98
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:02,114
I am not going to apologize
for having a healthy sex life.

99
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:04,781
Healthy? I'm going to
have to burn every sheet.

100
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:08,952
- I want my money.
- I want those non-fat peach yogurts.

101
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:11,588
They didn't just walk out of the fridge.

102
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:15,133
You can deduct it from the $40
that you're going to give me now.

103
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:18,226
You're my best friend.
Why would I steal from you?

104
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:21,397
It's no secret that you've been having
financial problems.

105
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,942
- I hear you bitching to your bank.
- That's it.

106
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:27,706
I can put up with your debauchery
and food theft,

107
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:29,714
but I will not tolerate spying.

108
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,841
- I want you out.
- You don't mean that.

109
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:35,580
Oh, yes, I do. I'm leaving tomorrow
to visit my sister for a few days.

110
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,987
I want you gone by the time I get back.

111
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,615
I'll do you one better.

112
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:44,188
I will leave today.

113
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,804
I hope this works. My sleep cycle's
totally out of whack.

114
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:02,405
I'm up all night,
then dozing off during the day.

115
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,144
Trust me. This will do the trick.

116
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:08,619
In fact, you should be
feeling more relaxed already.

117
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:12,485
- [Boys shout]
- You know, you're right.

118
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:16,722
Boys, I can hear you out there!
Be quiet! Just sit there and color.

119
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:20,493
- Now is not a good time to be moving.
- Sorry.

120
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:23,296
Just block everything out

121
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:26,200
and let it go.

122
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:28,671
Imagine that you're in a forest.

123
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:31,767
There's a babbling brook nearby.

124
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:36,042
And the wind is just coming
through the trees...

125
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:37,673
- Mommy?
- Parker!

126
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,776
I don't know... Ow!
...what you think you're doing,

127
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,845
but put that back where it belongs.

128
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:50,160
Sorry.
You were saying something about wind.

129
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:53,424
I was just creating a soothing image.

130
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,194
[Boys shout]

131
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:57,701
Oh, for the love of God.

132
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:01,766
Knock it off, you little monsters.

133
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,870
Mrs. Scavo, lie down.
We need to finish this.

134
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:10,882
I'm on my last nerves,
so I'm gonna level with you here.

135
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:15,114
I've screwed up my entire system
by taking my kids' A.D.D. Medication.

136
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:20,681
Yeah, you heard me. I plan to stop.
But right now I need to sleep

137
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:25,163
and I need more than a few crappy
needles, so what have you got?

138
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:27,459
I'm not licensed to write prescriptions.

139
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:31,401
- I know you're not.
- [Shouting continues]

140
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:42,139
This will put you right to sleep.
It's a very powerful herbal remedy.

141
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,478
Promise me you'll use it judiciously.

142
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,779
Sure. Whatever.

143
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:50,983
Knock, knock!

144
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:55,049
- Hey. Come on in.
- You're a mess.

145
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:58,187
I'm tearing out the leaky pipes
in the upstairs bathroom.

146
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:03,459
- Wall-to-wall rotten wood.
- Sounds like a job.

147
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:05,833
Julie said that you came by before.

148
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:09,204
Um... yeah. Uh... I was thinking about

149
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:13,335
driving up to the Germani vineyard
tomorrow for this wine tasting and...

150
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:16,040
- What time should I be ready?
- About 6:00.

151
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,845
6:00 is good.

152
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,112
All right.

153
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:25,317
I thought maybe afterwards we could have
a little dinner, maybe some dancing.

154
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:27,723
Sounds great.

155
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:31,126
Um... you do know that it's, like,
a two-hour drive up there.

156
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:35,224
Isn't that kind of late
to be coming back?

157
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:39,134
I thought if worse came to worse
we could... grab a room.

158
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,469
Oh? Like a hotel room?

159
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:45,032
- Yeah. As a last resort.
- Of course. Of course. Yes.

160
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:48,602
So maybe we should make a reservation.
You know, just in case.

161
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:53,618
Yeah, I found some hotels online.
Let me get the print-out.

162
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:58,219
Hey, Bongo. Come here.
Do you want a treat?

163
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,418
- Where do you keep the dog biscuits?
- Sorry, what?

164
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,756
Oh, never mind.

165
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:05,854
We'll just find them ourselves, huh?

166
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:19,102
Sorry, I couldn't hear you.
What did you say?

167
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:23,213
Nothing. It's not important.

168
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:25,375
[Phone rings]

169
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:28,544
It's my tiler guy.
Here. See what looks good.

170
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:30,884
Hey, Phil.

171
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:34,391
No, tomorrow morning
I'm making a lumber run. That's no good.

172
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:37,291
No, I'm gone tomorrow night, too.

173
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:41,732
- I could let him in.
- No, it's OK. Thanks.

174
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:45,463
It's fine. Just give me the key.
I'll be around all day.

175
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,371
All right. Um... thanks.

176
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:52,172
Phil, I'll give a key to my neighbor.
She'll be here to let you in.

177
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:03,917
Like every city,
Fairview had a neighborhood

178
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:06,048
that was less than desirable.

179
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:09,720
It was an accepted fact, anyone
who lingered there after midnight

180
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:12,059
was usually up to no good.

181
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:19,095
Rex and Bre Van De Kamp
were no exception.

182
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:32,680
You really think this is gonna work?

183
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,482
This is an impoverished
neighborhood.

184
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:39,046
- Trust me. Somebody will steal the car.
- How can you be so sure?

185
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:41,716
Because I have faith in the poor.

186
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:48,630
[Paul] She's so beautiful.
I shot this last year on her birthday.

187
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:56,570
- How are you going to do it?
- I made contact with her at a bar.

188
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:59,076
She thinks I'm a real-estate developer.

189
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:02,410
- Is she going to suffer?
- No.

190
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:05,814
Edie Britt will disappear
and you'll go back to your life.

191
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:11,448
Before you do it, do you think you could
ask her why she sent this to my wife?

192
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:15,426
You can't think like that, Mr. Young.
You can't give in to your curiosity.

193
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:19,794
Curiosity leads to guilt.
Guilt leads to talking.

194
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:22,026
Do you still have questions?

195
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:27,697
I want to be clear about something. If
I walk away with this cash, it's done.

196
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,798
No refunds. No buyer's remorse.

197
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:32,434
I get it.

198
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:35,446
We won't talk again,
so I'll ask one more time.

199
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:37,675
Are you sure you want this?

200
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:41,081
My wife is dead because of Edie Britt.

201
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:44,612
I absolutely want this.

202
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,487
You've been awfully quiet.

203
00:13:56,135 --> 00:14:00,196
I've just been thinking about the kids.

204
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:06,200
They sure grew up quickly, didn't they?

205
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:08,542
They sure did.

206
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,817
I told them when they were babies
that they shouldn't get bigger

207
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:16,377
because they were so adorable.

208
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:21,315
- And we were so happy.
- Yeah, well...

209
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:24,851
They sure didn't turn out
like we expected them to.

210
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,694
No. They didn't.

211
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,502
Oh, we could have been better parents.

212
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:30,831
Oh, we could have been better parents.

213
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:34,999
- We weren't that bad.
- We still have so much to teach them.

214
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:38,168
We need to show Andrew
the enormity of what he's done.

215
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:40,872
I suppose we could punish him.

216
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:44,939
What's the appropriate punishment
for a child who drives over a woman?

217
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,814
I don't know.

218
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:51,988
No matter how the kids turn out,
I still love them.

219
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,525
Course you do.

220
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:57,892
But I'll never forgive them
for growing up so quickly.

221
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:05,398
Hey, look.

222
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:22,011
And I opened the cabinet
and there was all this money in it.

223
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:26,454
- There was wads of it.
- You're freaking out over cash?

224
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:29,288
Realistically,
I've known this guy a few weeks.

225
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:31,556
He could be a hit man for the mob.

226
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,723
Then why are you going
on a trip with him?

227
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,596
I never get out of the house.

228
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:39,832
If you need to freak out, remember that
you're spending the night with Mike.

229
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:43,170
No man has seen you naked in years.
Except your doctor.

230
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:45,870
And he retired.
I try not to take that personally.

231
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,573
You look old in that.

232
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:51,013
Maybe I am being silly.

233
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:54,381
But going to a hotel with a man
is a big deal to me.

234
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:56,977
What if Mike is hiding something?

235
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:59,923
- Like what?
- I don't know.

236
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:03,359
- [Car horn]
- That's Dad. I gotta go.

237
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:07,523
Now, listen. No more freaking out.
I need this weekend to go well.

238
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:11,501
- Why do you care so much?
- I'm gonna have a husband some day.

239
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,835
I really don't want you living with us.

240
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:22,437
- [Bree] Are the lady fingers OK?
- They're terrific.

241
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:24,914
We just appreciate you all stopping by.

242
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,452
We just wanted you to know
how much we care.

243
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,148
So have the police
come up with any leads?

244
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:34,852
Not really. They'll be able to determine
the make and model of the car,

245
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,293
but without any eyewitnesses,
no one seems very optimistic.

246
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:41,128
Is there any good news about Juanita?

247
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:44,862
No change. All we can do
is wait and hope for the best.

248
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:49,868
- We put her on our prayer list.
- That's very sweet. Thank you.

249
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:54,902
It must really help
during times like these, having kids.

250
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,881
Yeah. They're a blessing.

251
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,851
Children make everything worthwhile.

252
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:05,480
You guys are the future. Legacy.

253
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:07,319
Thanks.

254
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:10,760
After we're all dead, you'll be
the only ones left to carry on.

255
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:15,697
Gabrielle and I
are about to start a family.

256
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:18,066
Oh! Hey, that's great!

257
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:21,606
- When did you decide this?
- It's a fairly recent development.

258
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,207
I see.

259
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:30,044
- We'll talk about this later.
- Face it. We're shallow people.

260
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:33,141
Can our lives have any meaning
if all we do is buy stuff?

261
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:36,083
- That depends on what we buy.
- I want a child.

262
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:39,624
In case you've forgotten,
we made a deal. No kids.

263
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:44,287
- Deals were meant to be renegotiated.
- We're not negotiating my uterus.

264
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:47,263
- We should probably be going.
- Yeah.

265
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:49,561
Thank you so much.

266
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:54,102
- That was weird.
- I feel awful for Carlos.

267
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:58,075
That talk about children
is obviously coming from his grief.

268
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:00,270
Whatever. I'm off the hook.

269
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:11,015
A weary Lynette drank her potent tea

270
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:15,151
in hopes of finally finding the slep
that had eluded her.

271
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:19,993
Unfortunately for Lynette,
there would be no rest for the weary.

272
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,000
- [Doorbell]
- Go to hell.

273
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:26,629
- [Doorbell rings several times]
- Go to hell, go to hell.

274
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:28,764
[Urgent knocking]

275
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:39,480
Sorry we're late. Kenny Lipman
couldn't find his neckerchief.

276
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:42,349
Lori Jean, the Scout meeting is today?

277
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:50,722
- Mommy!
- What? Oh. Right.

278
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:54,493
OK. Boys.
This knot is called the bowline.

279
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:58,297
It is a remarkably useful knot.
Now, pick up your ropes.

280
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:01,100
First we cross this end over here

281
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,835
and then we make a loop
and then another loop

282
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:09,346
and then you sort of pull it through,
I'm guessing,

283
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:12,315
and then you just... Ready?
...yank it taut.

284
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,920
Mommy, that doesn't look like
the picture.

285
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:21,021
You're never gonna be a sailor.
What do you care?

286
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:23,686
OK, everybody. Let's just take a break.

287
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,499
Thanks.

288
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,613
OK. It's all up there.
Can I get a signature?

289
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,345
- Oh, course.
- Thank you very much.

290
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:52,219
- There you go. Have a nice weekend.
- You too, lady.

291
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:21,515
[Door slams shut]

292
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:39,497
- [Knocking]
- [Man] Hey, ma'am!

293
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:43,905
Are you still here?
I forgot to give you a receipt.

294
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:46,409
Ma'am?

295
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,760
Oh...

296
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:18,005
Hello!

297
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:23,908
I need help! I'm up here!
I'm trapped in the floor! Hello!

298
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:29,114
If you came in here to judge me,
you can just leave.

299
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:33,256
Wait! Wait, no! Wait. Don't go.

300
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:36,488
I have an idea. Here.

301
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:38,791
Here. Grab the towel, Bongo.

302
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:41,128
Come on. Grab the other end. Good boy.

303
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:45,101
That's it. Get the other end.
Come on, Bongo. Pull the other end.

304
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:48,799
Come on, Bongo. What are you doing?
Bongo, over here.

305
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:55,040
Bongo? Oh! Oh! Don't do that! Oh, Bongo!

306
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,048
While Susan remained hopelessly stuck,

307
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:57,811
While Susan remained hopelessly stuck,

308
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:00,317
Gabrielle was moving
to confront the issue

309
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:02,785
of her young lover's
restless conscience.

310
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:06,618
- Nobody's home.
- I know. I came to talk to you.

311
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:09,422
- But she would ned to be discret.
- Keep working.

312
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:13,758
What were you thinking
showing up at the hospital?

313
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,232
I had to see if she was OK.

314
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,530
You need to keep
a low profile right now.

315
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:22,874
Look, you and I are finished.

316
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:25,375
From now on, I'm sticking with Danielle.

317
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:28,709
- Why would you say that?
- I hate myself for what we did.

318
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,874
I can't sleep at night.
We've got to make a clean break.

319
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:35,613
We weren't driving the car. We didn't
chase Juanita into the street.

320
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:38,212
She was there
because we were having an affair.

321
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:43,022
Between you and Carlos! Listen to me.
You didn't do anything wrong.

322
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,624
- That's not what Father Crowley thinks.
- What?

323
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:50,394
I went to confession.

324
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:56,368
Have you lost your mind?
What did you tell him?

325
00:22:56,441 --> 00:22:59,808
- Everything.
- Including...

326
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:02,778
in the alley? Behind the truck stop?

327
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:05,509
- Everything.
- Damn you!

328
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:19,792
What is wrong with you? Lassie would
have had a fire truck here by now.

329
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,458
You stupid dog.

330
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:26,833
Good boy, Bongo! Run, Bongo, run!

Oh!

332
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:45,317
Andrew, um... I know the last few days
have been stressful

333
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:48,393
and if you ever need
to talk to anybody...

334
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:52,294
I know. You and Dad are here for me.

335
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:55,457
Actually, I was thinking
you could talk to a professional.

- You think I'm crazy?
- Course not.

338
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,698
It's just that the accident probably
stirred up a lot of emotions.

that my car got dinged

to look both ways.

349

have to ride my bike to school.

it died.

and you die without repenting,

it'll clean the slate, right?

457
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:05,202
Not only that. If you want God's
forgiveness you have to be truly sorry

458
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:07,801
and promise not to commit the sin again.

459
00:34:07,912 --> 00:34:11,780

does my repenting still count?

that they can't handle the pressure.

492

know, it's easier to keep it all in.

- Yeah.

00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:52,238
Seems so. Edie didn't move in with Huber
until after your wife received the note.

498
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:55,074
My God,
we almost killed an innocent woman.

499
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:57,773
Like I said, I don't do refunds,

500
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:00,908
but if you like,
I'm willing to pay Mrs. Huber a visit.

501
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:03,953
No. Just keep the money.

502
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:09,118
This whole thing's been tearing me up.
The nightmares, the guilt.

503
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,787
This isn't what Mary Alice
would have wanted.

504
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,558
What would she have wanted?

505
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,127
Answers.

506
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:26,203
- Hello, Mrs. Huber.
- Paul.

507
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:28,370
- Let me help.
- That's not necessary.

508
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:30,277
I insist.

509
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:36,175
- Ants, huh?
- Yes.

510
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,578
I've had a little infestation problem.

511
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:41,083
I wanted to take care of it
before my trip.

512
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:44,087
Never had a problem with ants.

513
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:46,884
Mary Alice and I had
these little black flies once.

514
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:49,551
- Oh?
- She was so funny about it.

515
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:54,495
She ran out and bought herself a can
of poison something to spray them down.

516
00:38:54,565 --> 00:38:58,524
So she's taking aim at one
on the counter and she just stops.

517
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:01,901
Puts the can down. Couldn't do it.

518
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:05,373
She told me later it felt too personal.

519
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:08,968
Literally couldn't kill a fly.
That's how gentle she was.

520
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:11,571
Then you must have lived with
quite a few flies.

521
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:14,550
I'm going to have to say
good night to you now, Paul.

522
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:27,261
- What are you doing here?
- I want to know why.

523
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:35,701
[Knocking]

524
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:44,446
I know you've got a lot of questions
and I know I don't want to lose you.

525
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:47,245
So ask me anything you want.

526
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:50,515
You just told me
everything I need to know.

527
00:39:57,862 --> 00:40:03,858
All right. My idiot husband died
and left me with a worthless pension.

528
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:05,866
I was desperate for money

529
00:40:05,936 --> 00:40:08,769
and I'd rather take it
from a bad person than a good one.

530
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:12,331
- I didn't know she'd shoot herself.
- She was a good person.

531
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,901
A good person
who leaves her child motherless?

532
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:17,675
Read the Bible. Suicide's a big no-no.

533
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:20,943
- Don't you feel any remorse?
- Why should I?

534
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:23,782
Your wife didn't kill herself
because I wrote a note.

535
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:28,154
She killed herself because
of what she did to that poor baby.

536
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:32,753
But rest assured
I'm praying for Mary Alice.

537
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:36,095
After what she did,
she'll need all of our prayers.

538
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:29,382
There is a widely-read book
that tells us everyone is a sinner.

539
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:39,129
Of course, not everyone fels guilt
over the bad things they do.

540
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:44,897
In contrast, there are those who assume
more than their share of the blame.

541
00:41:49,573 --> 00:41:53,304
There are others
who soothe their consciences

542
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:56,471
with small acts of kindness.

543
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:06,981
Or by telling themselves
their sins were justified.

544
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:15,392
Finally, there are the ones
who simply vow to do better next time,

545
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:17,990
and pray for forgiveness.

546
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:33,675
Sometimes, their prayers are answered.
