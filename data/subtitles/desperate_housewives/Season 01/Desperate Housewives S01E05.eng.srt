2
00:00:01,034 --> 00:00:03,025
Previously on Desperate Housewives...

3
00:00:03,103 --> 00:00:07,062
The boys are in my class because I'm
the only teacher who can handle them.

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,802
We may no longer
be able to accommodate them.

5
00:00:09,909 --> 00:00:11,399
Ultimatums were made.

6
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:14,446
She used this to kill herself.
Why would you keep it?

7
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:15,980
Questions were asked.

8
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:19,415
- Are you OK?
- I think he's hiding something.

9
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:23,650
And lots of evidence was uncovered.

10
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:25,622
What is it you hired me to do?

11
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:28,786
Someone sent that note to my wife.
I need to know who.

12
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,523
You like Alfred Hitchcock?

13
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:33,293
I found it in the ruins of Edie's home.

14
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,391
I found it under our bed. It's not mine.

15
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:37,834
Talk about dirty laundry.

16
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,577
Every neighborhood
has a woman like Alberta Frome.

17
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,138
And every woman like Mrs. Frome
has a cat.

18
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:53,378
When she traveled,

19
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:57,822
Mrs. Frome would arrange for friends
to look after her beloved pet.

20
00:00:57,924 --> 00:01:03,658
This time, however, she was forced
to ask her neighbor, Susan Mayer.

21
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,096
Mrs. Frome liked Susan.

22
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:08,724
But it was common knowledge
on Wisteria Lane,

23
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:13,068
where Susan Mayer went,
bad luck was sure to follow.

24
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:16,199
Her misfortunes ranged
from the commonplace...

25
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:20,076
...to the unusual...

26
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:25,307
...to the truly bizarre.

27
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:34,123
As she waved goodbye, she worried
that Susan's bad luck would continue.

28
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:37,459
For that matter, so did her cat.

29
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:46,461
Mr. Whiskers. Dinner time.

30
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:49,030
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

31
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:55,080
That's weird.
Cats can't open drawers, can they?

32
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:58,049
- You didn't leave them open?
- No way.

33
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:02,587
Wow. Do you think somebody broke in?

34
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,022
[Both] Mr. Whiskers?

35
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:22,103
[Susan] Mr. Whiskers?

36
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:24,609
Though she didn't know it at the time,

37
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:30,316
Susan's luck...
had finally started to change.

38
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:15,282
News that an intruder had breached
the security of Wisteria Lane

39
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:17,590
spread like wildfire.

40
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,257
At a Neighborhood Watch meting
the next night,

41
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,494
residents voiced their concerns

44
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:32,609
whenever she took a shower.

45
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,977
Bob Fisk warned those present
that a government agency

46
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,677
was listening in
on their phone conversations.

47
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:42,517
Helen Vale spoke of
a ruthless local tenage gang

48
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,648
that had egged her minivan.

49
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,018
Three factors contribute to...

50
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:51,722
The evening concluded with Officer
Thompson offering safety tips

51
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:53,891
and a plan of action.

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,195
...you have some control over.

53
00:03:56,336 --> 00:04:01,239
You can sign up for daily or nightly
patrols, which might seem like overkill,

54
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:06,176
but regular surveillance will deter
even the most determined criminal.

55
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:12,185
Are there any other questions?
All right. Let's be careful out there.

56
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,951
- Actually, do you have a second?
- Sure. How can I help?

57
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:20,652
Um... I'm the one
who discovered the break-in.

58
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,388
- I think I found some evidence.
- Evidence?

59
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:28,526
This is a screwdriver left behind
by the burglar. I didn't touch it.

60
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:31,468
Why didn't you give this
to the investigators?

61
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:33,630
I tried and they laughed at me.

62
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:35,833
Nothing was taken from the house.

63
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,911
I apologize.
That was totally unprofessional.

64
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:43,074
Thank you. So you think
it should be dusted for prints?

65
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:46,949
- Yes. And I'll make sure it gets done.
- Great.

66
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:51,490
Bye.

67
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,492
Boys, stop it! Go to bed!

68
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:02,796
- We're not tired!
- Well, at least go upstairs.

69
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:05,736
- We want to play!
- Look!

70
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:09,564
Gimme!

71
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:11,405
Go! Go!

72
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:14,437
[Boys shout]

73
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:20,043
So why weren't you sitting with Mike?
I thought you two were an item.

74
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:23,179
I sort of thought so too.
Getting a lot of mixed signals.

75
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:27,158
I'll tell you who wasn't giving mixed
signals. Sexy Officer Thompson.

76
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:29,888
- He stared at you all night.
- You noticed that?

77
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:33,193
Honey, trust me, when
they're not staring at me, I notice.

78
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:35,961
I appreciate you guys
staying and helping.

79
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:38,196
Oh, please.
I would have hosted it myself

80
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:41,603
but there's camping equipment
everywhere.

81
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,733
It's nice of you.

82
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,836
And there's something else nice
that I'd like you to do.

83
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:49,905
Your kids both went to
Barcliff Academy, didn't they?

84
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:54,385
We need you to recommend Porter and
Preston. We can't get an interview.

85
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:56,387
You want me to recommend the twins?

86
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:59,857
Yes. You can tell them
how beautifully behaved the boys are.

87
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:03,225
- So you want me to lie?
- Yeah. I thought that was understood.

88
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,423
I'm very well respected at Barcliff,

89
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:08,091
and my word
won't be good there any more.

90
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:11,933
Yes, but by the time they realize
their mistake, we'll be in.

91
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:15,371
You're not having any more kids.
What do you care?

92
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:18,899
I had hoped some day to get
my grandchildren into Barcliff.

93
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:21,605
But I suppose
that doesn't matter to you, does it?

94
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,807
It really doesn't.

95
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,408
[Zach] We've got to get rid of it.

96
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:30,046
- [Paul] I said leave it alone!
- No! You can't stop me!

97
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:33,718
- Paul and Zach are fighting again.
- The second time this week.

98
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:36,284
They never fought
when Mary Alice was alive.

99
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,024
It's a shame.
They used to be such a happy family.

100
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:43,535
Just because you didn't hear them
fighting, doesn't mean they were happy.

101
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,972
The next day, as residents
began to patrol Wisteria Lane

102
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:59,142
in the hopes of
foiling potential burglars,

103
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:03,450
Gabrielle was about to experience
a home invasion of her own.

104
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:10,957
Mama Solis! What are you doing here?

105
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:14,999
I came to visit my son and
daughter-in-law. What does it look like?

106
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,467
Does Carlos know you're coming?

107
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,834
No. He likes to be surprised.

108
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:23,604
Now come.

109
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:26,144
Gabrielle. Come.

110
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,441
Family should always hug...

111
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:36,852
[whispering]... regardless
of how they feel about each other.

112
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:03,442
Wow. She's a beauty. 30-footer?

113
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:05,006
32.

114
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:09,178
Sweet. I sail. I've got a Flying Scott.

115
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:12,088
We have several
yachting enthusiasts here.

116
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:15,422
- I could introduce them to you...
- That sounds great.

117
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,430
...if we decide to enroll your children.

118
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:23,493
To be honest, Mr. And Mrs. Scavo,

119
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:26,127
your children's educational background

120
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:29,606
is a bit more common
than we would prefer.

121
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:32,610
But Mrs. Van De Kamp said
they were identical twins?

122
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:36,910
Yes. You can't tell them apart.
They're like book ends.

123
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,177
We do strive for diversity at Barcliff.

124
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:41,686
Identical twins could be interesting.

125
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:46,157
The boys are fascinating. They even have
their own twin secret language.

126
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:50,787
- Yeah, it's pretty scary.
- Not so much scary as highly developed.

127
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:53,457
Yeah, they bark and growl at each other.

128
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:57,400
Tom, Mr. Lentz was trying to say
something. Go ahead, Mr. Lentz.

129
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:01,167
I'd love to meet these twins of yours.
I tell you what.

130
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,606
I'm going to put them
on our "must-meet list".

131
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:06,678
- Terrific!
- Thank you so much.

132
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:11,249
- What is a "must-meet list"?
- We bring them in for observation.

133
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:12,978
Observation?

134
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:17,385
Mm. To see how they play with the other
children, how they respond to authority,

135
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:19,651
that sort of thing.

136
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,956
- Great.
- That sounds wonderful.

137
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,360
- Hey.
- Hi!

138
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:33,735
- Kids ready?
- Almost. Thanks for driving them.

139
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:36,468
Happy to do it. I miss them.

140
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,811
Did you hear there was a break-in
at Mrs. Frome's?

141
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:47,216
Yeah. I heard they didn't take anything.

142
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,120
It's still frightening.
He could have been a sexual predator.

143
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:55,752
And he ended up at Mrs. Frome's? That
would have been a lose-Iose situation.

144
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:58,524
Rex, that's not the point.

145
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:03,324
I don't feel safe. I was wondering
if you could spend the night.

146
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,303
You're in the NRA. You own four guns.

147
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:09,135
If somebody broke in
I'd expect you to protect me.

148
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:14,007
[Sighs]
Rex, the truth is, with the kids gone,

149
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,346
I'll be all by myself in this house
for the first time in 17 years.

150
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:22,217
I know it's hard to hear, but the
marriage counseling might not work.

151
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:25,051
You need to get used to being alone.

152
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:30,356
You're right. That was hard to hear.

153
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,601
- What are you doing?
- That is for the kids.

154
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:41,538
Oh, come on. I'm staying at a motel.
I haven't had a decent meal in weeks.

155
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,075
The marriage counseling
might not work out.

156
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:47,304
You need to get used to bad cooking.

157
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:55,818
Hey. Screwdriver girl.

158
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:01,482
I took your evidence into the lab
for fingerprints.

159
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:03,060
Really? That's great.

160
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:06,792
- I'll call you if I hear something.
- OK.

161
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:09,130
- Sorry!
- Thanks.

162
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:12,864
Actually, I'd like to call you anyway
if that's OK.

163
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:18,843
Oh. You seem like a really sweet guy
in an interesting line of work

164
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:22,244
but I'm not really available.

165
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:26,842
- Oh. You have a boyfriend?
- Yeah, sort of.

166
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:31,389
- Sort of.
- It's hard to explain. Even to myself.

167
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:34,392
Unit 23, we have a 907 A in progress.
Please respond.

168
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:38,725
Ten-four. I'm on my way. I gotta go.
Apparently there's a hostage situation.

169
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:42,598
- Oh, wow.

00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:32,972
- The virgin gave it up already?
- I want you so bad.

334
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,376
- When can I see you again?
- Tomorrow.

335
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:37,438
Meet me at the mall after school.

336
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:40,917
- What about your mother-in-law?
- I'll think of something.

337
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:46,650
- [Juanita] Gabrielle! Gabrielle!
- Coming!

338
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,955
A donation?
Now Barcliff wants a donation?

339
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:53,258
Apparently we're in competition
with one other family.

340
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:56,698
A generous donation will ensure
our kids beat 'em out.

341
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:59,566
- How generous?
- 15 thousand.

342
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:02,229
- We don't have that.
- That's what I told them.

343
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:07,836
So what will we do? Public school is out
unless we move to a new district.

344
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,676
We're not moving.

345
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:15,775
Maybe it's time
that we look into home schooling.

346
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:21,023
- I know you did not just say that.
- Honey, it's got its advantages.

347
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,754
Kids at home school
do better in their later years.

348
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:26,854
They won't make it
if I have to spend all day with them.

349
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:30,423
Honey, sometimes
you've just got to make the sacrifice.

350
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:32,435
It's probably best for the kids.

351
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:35,996
Let's put them back in me
and cook them until they're civilized.

352
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:38,634
You'd be cool with that?

353
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:45,573
- I've never had plum pudding before.
- I'm serving it for Christmas.

354
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:49,085
I like to try out new recipes
before the actual holiday.

355
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:53,215
That way, if the cookbook's
gotten it wrong, I can fix it.

356
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:55,589
You must really like Christmas.

357
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:59,118
You and Mr. Van De Kamp
always have the best decorations.

358
00:24:59,197 --> 00:25:01,256
I adore the holidays.

359
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:04,529
I never get depressed
if there's a decorated tree.

360
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:08,004
My mom and I would always
decorate our tree together.

361
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:12,098
- This Christmas is gonna be weird.
- Oh, Zach.

362
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:18,013
You know, my mother died
when I was young. She was hit by a car.

363
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:19,550
Oh.

364
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:23,712
It was right before Christmas,
as a matter of fact.

365
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:27,747
We were all singing carols
and the dog was howling

366
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:31,295
because everybody in my family
sings off-key except for me.

367
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:33,591
Anyway, it was a terrible ruckus.

368
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:40,101
So no one noticed when my mother
went out to give the neighbors a gift.

369
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:43,470
The next thing we heard
were brakes screeching.

370
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:47,010
Wow.

371
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:49,342
Most of my family went to the hospital

372
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:51,847
but I stayed home
because I was so young.

373
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:58,252
When I looked out the window
I saw my mother's blood on the street

374
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:00,655
and nobody was doing anything about it.

375
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:04,388
So I got a hose and I washed it off.

376
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:09,127
And once it was clean,
I felt so much better.

377
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,233
I've never told anyone
that story before.

378
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:20,006
Those are the most interesting ones.
The stories that we never tell anyone.

379
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:22,978
Yeah. You're probably right.

380
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,413
I have one.

381
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,814
It's more of a secret really.

382
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:32,021
I know why my mom killed herself.

383
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:36,521
- You do?
- It was something I did.

384
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,155
Something bad.

385
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:46,935
What did you do, Zach?

386
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:51,442
- Zach. Sweetheart.
- No. I shouldn't have said anything.

387
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:55,876
- If my dad found out...
- I won't tell your father!

388
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:58,973
- I can't get you involved.
- Zachary, it's all right!

389
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:08,318
What else did Zach tell you?

390
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:12,489
Just that Mary Alice killed herself
because of something he'd done.

391
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:15,692
- You couldn't get any more out of him?
- He was so nervous.

392
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:18,497
He started shaking then he just left.

393
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:21,128
OK, I think we should go to the police.

394
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:24,505
And tell them what?
We don't even have the note any more.

395
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:28,034
You have to get Zach to tell you
something so we have more to go on.

396
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:31,674
You don't understand.
This poor kid is scared out of his mind.

397
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:35,277
Bree, you're a woman.
Manipulate him. That's what we do.

398
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:38,982
- But how?
- How did you usually manipulate Rex?

399
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:47,195
Hello, Zachary.
Are you free for dinner tonight?

400
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:48,732
Sure.

401
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:52,929
Oh, good. Because last night
you put me in such a holiday mood.

402
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:57,338
I'm gonna make roast turkey
and candy yams and eggnog.

403
00:27:57,442 --> 00:28:00,639
Have you ever had
real, old-fashioned eggnog?

404
00:28:00,745 --> 00:28:04,272
- I don't think so.
- You are gonna love it.

405
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:06,441
It has quite a kick.

406
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:09,146
Me!

407
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:13,486
- Preston!
- Boys, could you stop...

408
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:15,889
[boys shout]

409
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:21,994
Lynette was desperate
to avoid home schooling.

410
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:24,763
But she saw no options on the horizon.

411
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:28,499
Until a solution sailed into view.

412
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:33,702
Gabrielle, please.
You bought me enough things.

413
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:37,236
- You're the one who's shopping.
- Mama, you're in a rut.

414
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:40,011
We need to spice up your wardrobe.
Ooh. Here.

415
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:42,952
Try this one on. Go on. Try it on.

416
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:51,357
- How are you doing in there?
- Is it supposed to be so tight?

417
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:53,989
Yes, it's form-fitting.
You'll look great.

418
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:57,330
I don't think this dress
is right for me. I can't breathe.

419
00:28:59,971 --> 00:29:02,303
Well, maybe I made a mistake.

420
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:07,208
While you change, I'm gonna make
a quick run to the book store.

421
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:11,942
- Wait! I'm coming with you!
- No! I'll just be a minute!

422
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:13,916
I'm coming with you!

423
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:21,625
Wait!

424
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,087
- Gabrielle! Wait!
- Ma'am!

425
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:31,624
Ma'am. Sorry, I'm gonna need to look
in your bags, please.

426
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:34,399
Fine. Just hurry up.

427
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:42,412
Right on time.

428
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:44,948
I don't know
where that blouse came from.

429
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:47,984
- Security.
- Keep your stupid blouse.

430
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:53,046
I have to find my daughter-in-law.
Don't touch me. Don't you dare touch me!

431
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:56,651
- You have to come with us.
- Get your hands off me!

432
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:59,322
[Hums]

433
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,595
[Phone rings]

434
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:07,733
Hello.

435
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:11,537
- Hey, it's me.
- Oh, hi, Rex. How are you?

436
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:15,670
- Is something wrong?
- I was just about to grab dinner

437
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:19,547
and it occurred to me,
"What the heck? I'll go out."

438
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:22,085
Would you like to have dinner with me?

439
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:31,855
Mrs. Van De Kamp. Guess what. I found
all my mom's old Christmas stuff.

440
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:34,990
Oh. Sweetie,
I was just coming over to talk to you.

441
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:39,469
I am so sorry but something
important came up and I have to cancel.

442
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:42,699
- Really?
- We'll do it again.

443
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:46,710
We'll have our impromptu holiday dinner.
I promise.

444
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,079
Bye.

445
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,487
Mm. I got one. Kelly Halstatter.

446
00:30:58,556 --> 00:31:01,525
In eighth grade,
she used to spit in my gym shoes.

447
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:04,026
Kelly Halstatter.

448
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,562
Kelly Halstatter. Here, look.

449
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:11,124
Two DUIs, one check-kiting
and an open bench warrant.

450
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:14,831
How tragic. By which I mean, "Yay".

451
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:17,534
You've been a good sport
coming on my shift with me.

452
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:20,772
Well, time flies when
you're on a stakeout in Cracktown.

453
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:27,651
- When does our official date begin?
- Taxpayers say 20 minutes. I say now.

454
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:33,353
- They're down.
- Thank you.

455
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:37,192
Honey, you read up on home schooling?

456
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:40,355
Yeah. It gave me some good ideas.
Well, one, anyway.

457
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:42,797
Great. What have you got?

458
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:47,827
You know how we agree that one of us
needs to stay home and parent the kids

459
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,466
and one of us needs to make a living?

460
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:54,477
I remembered that when I was working
I made a little more than you.

461
00:31:56,047 --> 00:32:00,780
- What are you doing?
- You tossed out that sacrifice comment.

462
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:04,686
It occurred to me, I've made sacrifices
over the past six years.

463
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:06,552
I gave up my career.

464
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:10,754
If another sacrifice has to be made,
I think it's your turn.

465
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:13,126
- Lynette?
- If I went back to work,

466
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:15,688
you could stay home
and take care of the kids.

467
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,736
I can't be with the kids all day.
I'd lose my mind.

468
00:32:18,836 --> 00:32:19,894
Uh-huh.

469
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:24,271
Hey. OK, I get it.
Home schooling is out.

470
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:27,573
How are we gonna scrape together
15 grand for this endowment?

471
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:31,740
Mm. How, how, how...

472
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,846
Think. Think real hard.

473
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,790
- Oh, no.
- Aye-aye.

474
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:46,828
The restaurant's run by
an old guy named Arinello.

475
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:50,697
He will propose to you. Don't say yes
because he's dead serious.

476
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:53,760
But what if I like him?

477
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:59,436
Hey. I thought this went to the lab.

478
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:03,773
All right. You got me.

479
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:06,577
- And that means what?
- Look, Susan.

480
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:10,745
No one would authorize lab time or
a computer search for a case like this.

481
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:14,313
- It's just not a priority.
- So why couldn't you just tell me that?

482
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:18,259
Well, I thought we were clicking.
Does this need to be a big deal?

483
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:22,265
Well, if you'd only lied to me
about it once it wouldn't be.

484
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:26,201
All right. I get it.
You want me to beg. OK.

485
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,363
Look at me. I'm begging.

486
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:32,265
Come on.
Don't be such a girl about this.

487
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:37,613
I know who you are.
You're a Karl in disguise.

488
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:41,751
I'm done with you. All of you.

489
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:46,188
Oh, come on, drama queen.
What are you doing?

490
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:48,690
Where are you going? It's not safe.

491
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:52,196
I'd rather take my chances
on the street, thank you very much.

492
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:54,595
Why do I always pick the psychos?

493
00:34:12,116 --> 00:34:14,209
Excuse me. I'm a little lost.

494
00:34:14,285 --> 00:34:16,515
You best be lost. This here's my corner.

495
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:19,750
Oh, yes. And a lovely corner it is.

496
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:22,486
And I hate to bother you
while you're working.

497
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:25,653
Could you point me
in the direction of a payphone?

498
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:31,258
Oh, if you have some change
for this five. Preferably quarters.

499
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:34,702
If I got paid in quarters,
I'd be doing something very wrong.

500
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:37,934
Right. OK.

501
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:41,969
Thank you.

502
00:34:42,046 --> 00:34:46,176
Hey. You want to use my cell?
I have weekend minutes.

503
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:49,253
Thank you so much.
You're saving my life.

504
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:53,313
- Excuse me, honey.
- Oh, yes. You do what you've got to do.

505
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:03,232
Oh, please answer.
Come on. Pick up, Julie.

506
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:05,700
Oh, thank God. Don't ask any questions.

507
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:09,637
Just get somebody down here to pick me
up at the corner of Ninth and Foster.

508
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:12,039
Hey, babe.

509
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:16,603
Thank you. No. I'm on a break.
Hurry, please.

510
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:22,280
Excuse me. We got a call.
Something about a break-in.

511
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:25,651
One of your neighbors saw someone
breaking into your home.

512
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:29,214
We sent some guys out to investigate
and uh...

513
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:31,420
- What is it?
- I gotta tell you, ma'am.

514
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:34,988
I thought I'd seen a lot on the job,
but this is something else.

515
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:05,453
So let me get this straight.

516
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:08,226
He chopped down one of our pine trees?

517
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,562
I'm afraid so.

518
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:17,264
Zach, why did you do this?

519
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:22,210
- I don't know.
- Take off those handcuffs, please.

520
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,841
- Ma'am, he confessed to breaking in.
- This is not up for discussion.

521
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:29,947
Go ahead.

522
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:33,349
[Man] Sir, you can't...

523
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:36,325
Zach.

524
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:54,204
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

525
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:57,281
Then how much for a trip
around the world?

526
00:36:57,348 --> 00:37:00,681
I can't believe Julie sent you.
She is soon gonna be dead.

527
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:03,083
Come on. Get in.

528
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:11,190
- Wasn't that sent in for prints?
- No. The cop lied to me.

529
00:37:11,295 --> 00:37:15,095
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Just asking.

530
00:37:17,868 --> 00:37:21,235
Yes. Apparently they found
a blouse in her bag.

531
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:25,934
I don't know, Carlos. At some point
older people start to get confused.

532
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:28,808
She probably thought she paid for it.

533
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:32,041
No, no charges. Everything's fine.

534
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:34,778
OK. I'll tell her. Bye.

535
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:40,655
Carlos is gonna be late for dinner.
It's just the two of us.

536
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:43,853
- What would you like to eat?
- I'm not hungry.

537
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,021
OK. Suit yourself.

538
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:49,395
Don't go yet. I need to talk to you.

539
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,730
It's important. Please.

540
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:03,106
I married Diego Solis
when I was 16 years old.

541
00:38:04,148 --> 00:38:08,642
A few months into our marriage,
he started to beat me.

542
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:11,153
I didn't know what to do.

543
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:14,123
Juanita, I had no idea.

544
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:17,786
It got so bad that I started
praying to God to let me die.

545
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:22,526
But God, in his infinite wisdom,
gave me a reason to live.

546
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,692
Carlos.

547
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:27,636
Ah, he was a beautiful baby.

548
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:30,003
But my husband wasn't much of a father.

549
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:34,374
He never held him. He would yell
and scream at him for no reason at all.

550
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:36,970
One night, when Carlos was four,

551
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:39,912
Diego Solis came home drunk.

552
00:38:40,017 --> 00:38:43,214
He beat my Carlos.

553
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:45,755
Something inside me snapped.

554
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:50,022
At that moment,
I found a way to be strong.

555
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:54,427
So I made sure that Diego Solis

556
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:58,434
never hurt my son or me ever again.

557
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:00,595
What did you do?

558
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:06,234
Well, if you pray hard enough, God
gives you the tools to your salvation.

559
00:39:15,052 --> 00:39:18,044
Carlos said that his father left
for a waitress in El Paso.

560
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:20,590
Mm-hm. That's what he was told.

561
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:25,586
All mothers know
they have to protect their children.

562
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:28,996
But some of us take our job
more seriously than others.

563
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:32,968
I don't know why you're telling me this.

564
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:36,865
I think you do.

565
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:43,271
[Metal scrapes]

566
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:56,422
OK. I know you're mad at me.

567
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:59,156
I'm sorry I didn't stop you
going out with that guy.

568
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:03,326
I'm not just mad at you.
I'm mostly mad at myself.

569
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:06,928
- OK.
- I'm mad that I like you so much

570
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:08,972
without knowing anything about you.

571
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:13,441
Oh. What do you want to know?

572
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:18,070
- What's your favorite food?
- Mexican.

573
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:20,581
- Favorite sport?
- Football.

574
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:22,551
- Favorite band?
- Elvis Costello.

575
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:25,486
- That's a guy, not a band.
- It's a guy with a band.

576
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:31,520
What do you think of me?

577
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:57,010
I'm sorry, could you repeat that?

578
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:05,025
- [Zach] I don't want to talk about it.
- [Paul] This is insane!

579
00:41:05,095 --> 00:41:09,464
- [Zach] Do you even care about me?
- [Paul] Do not talk that way!

580
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:11,558
[Glass smashes]

581
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:20,869
- Mrs. Van De Kamp.
- Hi, Zach.

582
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:23,344
I wanted to see if
everything was all right.

583
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:26,474
- Everything's fine.
- Are you sure?

584
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:28,881
Yes.

585
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:33,413
Well, OK. I'll see you tomorrow then.

586
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:35,754
I'm sure that you will.

587
00:41:47,037 --> 00:41:52,532
People by their very nature are always
on the lookout for intruders...

588
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:57,912
trying to prevent those
on the outside from getting in.

589
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:03,742
But there will always be those
who force their way into our lives,

590
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:07,917
just as there will be those
we invite in.

591
00:42:07,992 --> 00:42:10,222
Hi.

592
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:25,507
But the most troubling of all

593
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:29,375
will be the ones
who stand on the outside looking in.

594
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:35,144
The ones we never truly get to know.
