2
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,832
Previously on Desperate Housewives...

3
00:00:02,902 --> 00:00:04,961
- Zach's gone from Silvercrest.
- Hungry?

4
00:00:05,038 --> 00:00:06,062
Sometimes...

5
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:08,265
If I don't get help,
I will lose my mind.

6
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:11,504
- Where can I score some nanny?
...no matter how hard you try...

7
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:14,512
FBI! Carlos Solis,
I have a warrant for your arrest.

8
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:16,105
...some problems...

9
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:18,844
- Sorry, you are...?
- You've met Maisy Gibbons?

10
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:21,978
- She's a nightmare.
- Maisy loves to rule her kingdom.

11
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:24,249
You are unhappy with our sex life.

12
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:27,225
You're not getting something
but you're afraid to ask.

13
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:30,228
...can't be easily solved.

14
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:38,737
To understand Maisy Gibbons,

15
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:43,139
you first ned to know
how she spent her afternoons.

16
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:46,701
Her mornings were spent
running errands for her husband.

17
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,304
Hi.

18
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:51,145
Her evenings were spent
helping with homework.

19
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:53,685
OK, so, nine plus one is...

20
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:55,982
But her afternoons,

21
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:59,855
well, they were spent
in the company of men.

22
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:05,959
Frustrated, misunderstood,

23
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:11,436
lonely men, willing to pay money
to fel a little less lonely.

24
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:14,766
And Maisy Gibbons
was willing to help them.

25
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:19,778
Maisy, I've always wondered. Nobody
knows about your little hobby, do they?

26
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:22,508
- Mm-mm.
- Is it hard?

27
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:27,019
- Keeping a secret like this?
- Well, maybe if it was just my secret.

28
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:32,617
But the way I see it, I keep the
secrets of every man who comes to me.

29
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:36,025
And I find that
absolutely exhilarating.

30
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:38,222
A few years back, Harold lost his job

31
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:42,564
and we had to give up our membership
at the country club.

32
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:45,604
And then one day
one of my club friends

33
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:47,765
asked why she hadn't seen me around.

34
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:53,780
I told her that
we couldn't afford it any more.

35
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:59,683
She waved it off like it was nothing,
but I saw her get that look in her eye,

36
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:02,687
that look of... pity.

37
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,223
Maybe she was just trying to be nice.

38
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:08,988
Anyway, is that so bad,
feeling sorry for someone?

39
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:12,428
When they say something,
they are being supportive,

40
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,592
but when they say nothing,

41
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:18,000
they think you're so far gone,
you're never coming back.

42
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:19,162
Gotcha.

43
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:24,199
Anyway, a couple months later,
I started my little hobby,

44
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:26,939
and the most wonderful thing happened.

45
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:30,505
This woman's husband
became one of my regulars.

46
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:31,880
Wow.

47
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,612
[Doorbell]

48
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:38,555
Oh, would you be a lamb
and go out the back?

49
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:41,691
- That's my next appointment.
- Sure.

50
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:45,356
It's the husband of the woman
I was telling you about.

51
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:51,534
- Hello, there.
- Hey, Maisy.

52
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:44,586
Every morality play
has its cast of characters.

53
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:48,427
There is always an innocent victim,

54
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:52,020
a deceitful villain,

55
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:55,794
a prosecutor who seks the truth,

56
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:59,963
a magistrate who dispenses justice

57
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:03,634
and a lawyer who charges too much.

58
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:10,547
This morality play was being produced
at the Fairview County Courthouse.

59
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:14,485
Its themes were trust and betrayal.

60
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:18,114
So what's your issue with bail
in this case, Ms McCready?

61
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:20,625
We want bail denied, Your Honor.

62
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:24,288
The company imported goods
manufactured by slave labor.

63
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:27,855
His business partner, Mr. Tanaka,
has fled the country,

64
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:31,164
and Mr. Solis has refused
to surrender his passport.

65
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:33,831
Dog ate your client's passport,
Mr. Hartley?

66
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:36,340
It's been temporarily misplaced,

67
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:41,675
but we maintain that Kisho Tanaka set
up and executed the entire operation.

68
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:45,775
Mr. Solis is no business partner
but merely a hired contractor.

69
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:49,049
I'd also like to point out
my client is the sole provider

70
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:53,387
for his wife and his mother, who is
hospitalized in a coma as we speak.

71
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:57,395
Bring me the passport
and Mr. Solis can visit his mother.

72
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:03,265
Until then, your client is denied bail
and remanded. What's next?

73
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:08,371
Finish those Brussels sprouts.

74
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:11,500
I can see them
hidden under your macaroni.

75
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:13,943
I hate Brussels sprouts.

76
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:17,039
Well, Brussels sprouts help you grow.

77
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:20,051
You don't want to be short
your whole life, do you?

78
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:25,682
You know what we'll do? We're gonna dip
'em in a little cheese. Here you go.

79
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:28,386
- Good. Yummy.
- Disgusting!

80
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,827
Fine. Be 3'8" the rest of your life.

81
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,831
See if I care.
Good luck finding girlfriends.

82
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,630
- Didn't you have a lunch?
- I'm gonna cancel it.

83
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:40,434
The boys are in rare form,
and you're still finding your way.

84
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,701
Lynette, it's been two days.

85
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:46,939
I... don't want to shock them
by suddenly disappearing.

86
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:50,777
- Deep down they're very sensitive.
- That's a paper airplane.

87
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:54,011
They'll be fine. Now go.
Get out of here.

88
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:59,057
You call me if you need anything.

89
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,958
- I will.
- OK.

90
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:05,462
Boys! Come here and give Momma
a three-bear hug.

91
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:08,796
Come on. Whoo!
One, two, three...

92
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:10,368
Get in! Get in!

93
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:13,098
- [All] Bye, Mom.
- Bye.

94
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:15,663
- Bye!
- OK.

95
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:21,276
- [Susan giggles]
- Watch you hands!

96
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:25,044
I'm gonna eat upstairs.
I've got a ton of homework.

97
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:27,552
What, are you storing up for winter?

98
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,180
I'm just really hungry.

99
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:33,087
I talked to Dad,
and he and Brandi might break up.

100
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,753
Oh, how awful.

101
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:39,525
- Mom, you're smiling.
- Am I?

102
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:45,094
Anyway, he can't take me this weekend,
so I'll be home after all. Goodnight.

103
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:52,004
Oh, great. Our romantic weekend's off.

104
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:55,740
- We can move it to my house.
- No.

105
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:58,214
Why not?

106
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:00,785
I just want it to be special.

107
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:03,253
And it can't be special at my house?

108
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:08,282
OK, I know this sounds weird, but I
just need to have my things around me.

109
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:10,852
- What things?
- Perfumes and oils.

110
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:14,126
I wanna pick out the outfit
you're gonna tear off me.

111
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,567
And plus I need to be
in complete control of the lighting.

112
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:20,571
OK. We'll wait till next weekend.

113
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:23,471
You are just the sweetest guy.

114
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:32,679
- I can't wait till next weekend.
- No, me neither.

115
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,845
Tomorrow?
I've got an early job and that's it.

116
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:39,584
My publisher's got me under the gun
for something. Friday?

117
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:43,719
- I'm re-piping a house.
- Damn Karl!

118
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:47,755
Not even married any more and
he's still keeping me from having sex.

119
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:53,636
I can't hide you in my room for ever,
and I think we need to tell my mom.

120
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:56,367
You can trust her, I promise.

121
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:58,672
You didn't tell her what I told you?

122
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:01,372
No! I would never tell anyone that.

123
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:06,776
- What are you doing?
- I don't wanna cause problems.

124
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:09,822
I'm just gonna go.

125
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:12,789
Zach, stop. Don't go.

126
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:15,588
I won't tell her.

127
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:20,230
I swear I'll be out of here soon.

128
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,995
I'll think of something, OK?

129
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:37,874
- Hello.
- Why are you up?

130
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,817
I could ask you the same question.

131
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:43,583
I'm going to bed.

132
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:46,857
I didn't ask you to wait up for me.

133
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:51,090
Remember, I'm here as our
children's father, not your husband.

134
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:59,060
What are you doing?

135
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:01,629
Were you with a woman?

136
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:06,603
Did you tell her you have a wife
or does that hinder your style?

137
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:10,672
All right, even if I was seeing
someone, I have every right to.

138
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:13,911
Exploring options
is the point of being separated.

139
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:18,150
- Options! I'm not a mutual fund, Rex.
- Oh, that's not...

140
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:23,322
Bree, you should get out there,
try and meet someone.

141
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:28,331
Meet someone?
I'm raising your children.

142
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:31,267
I am just trying
to move on with my life.

143
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:34,203
- It is nothing to be ashamed of.
- Oh, OK.

144
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:38,141
Why don't you just call up
your mystery woman and invite her over?

145
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:41,611
I'll pull out the sofa bed
and you can take her right there.

146
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:45,082
Andrew! Danielle!
Daddy's gonna fornicate for us!

147
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:48,312
Just keep your voice down.

148
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:50,878
Why? Are you feeling ashamed?

149
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:02,993
The next morning started
with a banging.

150
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:09,801
No one knew where Martha Huber was,
and Edie Britt was starting to worry.

151
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:13,605
Edie didn't like worrying.
She felt it gave her wrinkles.

152
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:17,308
So, out of concern for her face,
and Mrs. Huber,

153
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:20,716
Edie decided to find out
what was going on.

154
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:28,751
Yao Lin, listen. It's very important
that we find Carlos's passport.

155
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:33,059
I already looked through his office.
I need you to search the bedroom.

156
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,156
What?

157
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:39,761
With Mr. Solis in jail, how you
gonna pay me? I have children.

158
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,967
Yao Lin,
your kids are in their twenties.

159
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:47,602
But if it'll make you shut up...

160
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:52,015
Here. Three weeks in advance.

161
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:55,050
If you don't mind,
can I call your bank?

162
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:59,251
Yao Lin, don't be stupid.
People don't become poor overnight.

163
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,990
That's my car. Oh, my God.

164
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,433
Hey!

165
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:15,469
Hey! What are you doing?
Where are you taking my car?

166
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,771
The government's impounding it.

167
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,971
Call that number
if you have any questions.

168
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,053
Oh, my word.

You call this a paint job?

170
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:38,895
I don't want to see it again
till it's perfect!

171
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:48,000
I wonder what's going on over there.

172
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:53,067
Claire did OK yesterday. It could have
been beginner's luck. I should call.

173
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:56,637
For the first time in years
you finally have some free time,

174
00:11:56,749 --> 00:12:00,913
and you're wasting it
obsessing about the kids.

175
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:09,790
I don't know this woman. So she has
a degree in sociology. Who doesn't?

176
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:13,354
My boys are a lot to handle.
What if she's not up to it?

177
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:17,926
If you really have that many doubts,
you should go buy a hidden camera.

What, a nanny-cam?

179
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:23,831
Yeah. People do terrible things
when they think no one's watching.

180
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,434
Yeah.

181
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:29,708
I couldn't tape Claire.
It would be a breach of trust.

Fine. Why do you ask?

185
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,828
I'm just curious.
He moves out, moves back in.

186
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,333
Is he back for good?

187
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:56,101
The situation is... fluid.
I'm not certain what his plans are yet.

188

Huh.

189
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:05,246
So if you're not sure he's back for
good, why are you ironing his shirts?

190
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:11,119
Because I have faith that he'll come
back and that he'll do the right thing.

191
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:15,819
That's good.
It's good to have faith in people.

192
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:18,386
Yeah.

193

Now Zach's the one who's in trouble.

336
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:17,793
You sent him back to a man
who hates him.

337
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:30,514
As Gabrielle considered the vast
emptiness of her new surroundings,

338
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:35,884
she was surprised to find there was
only one thing she truly missed...

339
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:39,781
...her husband.

340
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:42,617
[Doorbell]

341
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,566
We have a warrant to enter your house

342
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:55,971
and repossess any goods we suspect
may have been obtained... illegally.

343
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,537
We're not into clutter.

344
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:08,111
All right. Harvey The Flying Turtle.
Doesn't this look fun?

345
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:11,019
- Where's Claire?
- I gave her the afternoon off.

346
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:13,557
- Who wants to turn pages?
- Is she sick?

347
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:17,652
No. I just wanted us all to spend
the day together, like we used to.

348
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:21,721
Here we go. "Once upon a time
there was a young turtle named Harvey."

349
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:26,999
"Harvey told the other turtles 'I'm
going to fly off and see the world."'

350
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:29,905
"The other turtles said
'Turtles can't fly!"'

351
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:33,239
It's getting good now, huh?

352
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:39,642
- Well, what's wrong?
- Claire does funny voices.

353
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:44,278
Does she, now? OK.

354
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:49,022
"Harvey didn't like
the turtles laughing so he told them

355
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:53,030
[squawking] 'I'll show you!
I will fly higher than the birds."'

356
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:58,400
- That's not funny.
- Yeah, well, I'm just warming up.

357
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:03,237
"Bruno, the big bad turtle, took Harvey
up on the cliff and threw him over."

358
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:09,338
"He proclaimed 'We'll see if
you can fly! Fly or die! Fly or die!"'

359
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,679
When's Claire coming back?

360
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:19,218
What happened to your nails?

361
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:23,158
Oh, I... I moved all our stuff
to keep it from the Feds.

362
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:28,194
It kills me that
I'm putting you through this.

363
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:31,564
Hands on the table.

364
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:37,938
It's not your fault.
You didn't do anything wrong.

365
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:41,773
I'll take care of everything
until you're back to do it yourself.

366
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,678
And you will be soon.

367
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:48,879
I gotta be honest. I didn't know
how you would hold up.

368
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:52,150
I knew you were a strong woman,
but I had no idea.

369
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:55,192
You're a good wife, Gaby.
A real partner.

370
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:59,687
Oh, Carlos, I love you so much.

371
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:02,426
I would give up
a houseful of expensive junk

372
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:06,265
just to put this behind us
and have you home with me.

373
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:08,703
That sounds pretty good right now.

374
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:14,637
- I'm gonna kiss my husband now.
- Hands on the table.

375
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:24,551
There's a false panel
on the back wall of my closet.

376
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:28,057
My passport is there,
along with some papers.

377
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:32,426
Take the passport to the lawyer
and burn the papers.

378
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:50,377
Carlos, did you know
what Tanaka was doing?

379
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:56,211
Just burn the papers.

380
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:13,760
Hey, Lynette. Did Martha Huber leave
a spare key to her house with you?

381
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:18,468
No. Where is she, by the way?
I haven't seen her in days.

382
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:21,977
You got me. She kicked me out so fast
that I forgot my laptop,

383
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:26,881
and there's just some stuff on there
that I don't want anyone else to see.

384
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:30,284
Oh. Well, good luck with that.

385
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:39,194
You're not looking half bad. What
have you done with your little posse?

386
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:43,633
- They're with the new nanny.
- Wow. Your own personal nanny?

387
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:46,704
Smell you.

388
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:49,467
Trust me,
it's not all it's cracked up to be.

389
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,668
Our mothers didn't get us nannies
or put us in daycare

390
00:31:52,777 --> 00:31:55,940
because they knew
if they did we'd find out

391
00:31:56,014 --> 00:32:00,348
there are other women out there
who were better mothers than they were.

392
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:03,182
I had a nanny for a while growing up.

393
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:06,018
- Mrs. Muntz.
- You had a nanny?

394
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:10,288
Well, actually, she was more like
a court-appointed social worker.

395
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:15,765
My mom did a little time. She had
a thing for bourbon and... shoplifting.

396
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:17,732
Oh. Sorry.

397
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:21,169
Muntz was a hard-ass. No mercy.

398
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:25,107
In fact, she was such a disciplinarian
that when my mom made parole,

399
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:27,700
I was actually happy to see her.

400
00:32:27,812 --> 00:32:29,677
Really?

401
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:32,215
Yeah. Lesser of two evils.

402
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:35,615
- Huh.
- Anyway, I gotta find a key.

403
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:37,780
- See you later.
- Bye.

404
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:42,887
Thanks for your help with Zach before.

405
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:46,260
It's my pleasure.
I hope he comes out of this OK.

406
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:49,698
He's a little squirrelly,
but he seems like a good kid.

407
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:51,894
Yeah.

408
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:55,964
So, how's Julie taking all this?

409
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:01,068
Not well. She accused me
of not being a good mother.

410
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:03,306
No, you're a great mom.

411
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:05,872
Well, she was sort of right.

412
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:11,043
After my divorce,
I really leaned on her a lot.

413
00:33:11,856 --> 00:33:13,915
Seems natural.

414
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,722
And I still kinda do it.

415
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:22,162
I just want somebody
to talk to about all my adult stuff,

416
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:25,895
and she's right there,
and she just acts so mature,

417
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:28,268
I forget she's thirteen.

418
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:31,706
Well, the good news is
that from now on,

419
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:36,837
if you ever want to talk to somebody
about grown-up stuff, you got me.

420
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,686
I can't talk to you about everything.

421
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:46,950
Oh?

422
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:50,085
What if I want to talk about
the big crush I have

423
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:53,324
on the plumber
that lives across the street?

424
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:56,423
- Big crush, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

425
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:59,365
Well, you'd have to tell me more.

426
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:04,999
Well... he's got a smile
that's to die for.

427
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:08,944
And don't get me started
on his tattoo.

428
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:15,849
Thanks.

429
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,718
[Doorbell]

430
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,258
Oh, Bree.

431
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:29,993
What a nice surprise.

432
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:32,194
Would you like to come in?

433
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:35,000
Well, that depends.

434
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:38,565
Are you having an affair
with my husband?

435
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:47,879
- Would you like some more potatoes?
- You already asked me that.

436
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:54,653
Sorry. I'm so relieved you're safe,
I'm not thinking straight.

437
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:58,183
Does that mean you're not gonna
send me back to Silvercrest?

438
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:01,595
You've gotta understand,
your behavior, the violence,

439
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:05,033
breaking into the Van De Kamps...

440
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:07,798
I just didn't know
what you were going through.

441
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:10,066
You could have asked me.

442
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:13,168
Well...

443
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:16,973
I've been remembering things.

444
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:21,611
Things from when I was little.

445
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:27,889
- What kind of things?
- Awful things.

446
00:35:28,726 --> 00:35:33,129
Zach, listen to me. Sometimes
it's not good to look back on the past.

447
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:37,668
But I can't help it. These images
just keep popping into my head.

448
00:35:37,735 --> 00:35:40,932
You've got to find a way
to push them back out again.

449
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:46,571
OK.

450
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,444
More potatoes?

451
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:55,075
Yes, please.

452
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:07,660
Sure is nice to be back to normal.

453
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:21,836
You should know that Rex
still loves you... very much.

454
00:36:23,814 --> 00:36:26,942
- He said that?
- Yes.

455
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:30,952
[Sighs]

456
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:34,389
Then why is he so unhappy?

457
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:38,223
He has certain needs, and he's afraid
to discuss them with you.

458
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:41,730
Needs? Like... sexual needs?

459
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:43,857
Yes.

460
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:48,564
And have you fulfilled those needs?

461
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:57,072
I see.

462
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:04,411
You are pretty brazen
for a woman who just admitted,

463
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:07,650
however tacitly, that she just slept
with my husband.

464
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:10,785
If I told anyone,
they would never speak to you again.

465
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:14,058
You're not gonna tell a soul.

466
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:18,261
Yeah, you may hate me, but you'd hate
the humiliation a lot more.

467
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:23,739
Oh, I don't hate you, Maisy.
I pity you.

468
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,810
- Hi.
- Oh, hey, Lynette.

469
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:33,941
- You heading out now?
- Yep.

470
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:37,454
I'll be home late,
so just the usual routine.

471
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:41,116
- A nap for Penny and...
- No sugar after five. I got it.

472
00:37:41,225 --> 00:37:43,318
You're the best.

473
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:48,756
Oh, one more thing. Since the boys
are having corndogs for dinner,

474
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:53,235
I'd like you to make sure
they get a vegetable to go with it.

475
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:58,533
- Brussels sprouts?
- They're full of iron.

476
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:02,772
- Make sure they clean their plates.
- Not a problem. I have this trick.

477
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,873
- I cover the veggies with some cheese.
- Ooh. You sly dog.

478
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:18,059
That night Lynette settled in
to watch her personal pick

479
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:20,891
for fel-good movie of the year.

480
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:25,126
You need to eat your Brussels sprouts.

481
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:29,536
- Brussels sprouts? Disgusting!
- I don't want this!

482
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:34,007
Hey! Yes, you do! Don't throw them.

483
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:37,911
- Hey! Hey, stop it!
- I hate Brussels sprouts!

484
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:40,246
You guys, stop it!

485
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:44,220
- Do not throw them at me. Cut it out!
- [Children yelling]

486
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,381
[Monitor bleeps]

487
00:38:57,201 --> 00:38:59,294
Hey.

488
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,705
Hey.

489
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:07,469
They operated, huh?

490
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:16,511
They sure did.

491
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:20,446
How'd it go?

492
00:39:21,392 --> 00:39:26,762
It went well. The surgeon says
you're gonna be as good as new.

493
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:34,527
- You look like you've been crying.
- I have.

494
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:41,539
I was so afraid you were gonna die.

495
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:45,775
There's so many things
I haven't had a chance to tell you.

496
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:51,552
- I'm sorry you were so worried.
- That's OK.

497
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:55,056
How are you now, Rex?

498
00:39:55,126 --> 00:40:00,564
Are you strong enough to listen
to the things I need to tell you?

499
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:02,724
Sure, hon.

500
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:11,297
I know you still love me.

501
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:17,572
Maisy told me.

502
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,143
She did?

503
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:32,919
As of this moment, Rex,
I am no longer your wife.

504
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:37,592
I am gonna go out and find
the most vindictive lawyer I can find,

505
00:40:37,701 --> 00:40:41,068
and together
we are going to eviscerate you.

506
00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:43,732
I am gonna take away your money,

507
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:47,767
your family and your dignity.

508
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,445
- Do you hear me?
- Bree...

509
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:56,486
And I am so thrilled
to know that you still love me.

510
00:40:58,055 --> 00:41:01,149
Because I want
what's about to happen to you...

511
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:07,262
...to hurt as much
as is humanly possible.

512
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:16,066
I'm so glad you didn't die
before I got a chance to tell you that.

513
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:40,826
Trust is a fragile thing.

514
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:45,900
- Bye, guys!
- Bye, Mom!

515
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:50,863
Once earned,
it affords us tremendous fredom.

516
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:59,415
But once trust is lost,
it can be impossible to recover.

517
00:42:03,487 --> 00:42:08,550
Of course, the truth is,
we never know who we can trust.

518
00:42:14,598 --> 00:42:17,999
Those we're closest to can betray us.

519
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,404
Police, open up!

520
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:27,467
And total strangers
can come to our rescue.

521
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:35,578
In the end, most people
decide to trust only themselves.

522
00:42:35,653 --> 00:42:39,817
It really is the simplest way

523
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:43,018
to kep from getting burned.
