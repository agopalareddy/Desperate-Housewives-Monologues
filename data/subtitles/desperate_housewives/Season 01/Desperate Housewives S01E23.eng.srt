2
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,834
Previously on Desperate Housewives...

3
00:00:03,903 --> 00:00:06,770
There is a motive to every mystery...

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,640
Your body isn't responding
to the medication the way it should.

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,510
- I think I'm having a heart attack.
...evidence of every crime...

6
00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:17,678
They're charging you with a hate crime?

7
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:21,380
- I thought you were cheating with him.
- With our gay cable guy?

8
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:25,185
I didn't know he was gay.
I didn't know Justin was either.

9
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:28,386
...and an answer to every question.

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,693
Gabby, the woman killed herself.
Something must have been going on.

11
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:37,863
All you have to do
is take a closer look.

12
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:41,532
It had a woman in it.
She was all chopped up.

13
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:45,339
- And eventually, every secret...
- Do you know where Paul Young is?

14
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:47,676
I know where he'll be on Thursday night.

15
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:51,045
...will be revealed.

16
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:55,349
- Mary Alice was being blackmailed?
- Oh, Mary Alice, what did you do?

17
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,124
My name is Mary Alice Young.

18
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:05,495
Before I died, my life was filled
with love, laughter, friendship,

19
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:09,057
and sadly, secrets.

20
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:16,134
The secrets had begun 15 years earlier
when my name was Angela Forrest,

21
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:19,940
and I was living a life
of quiet desperation.

22
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:25,649
I'd fel it every morning
as I made breakfast for my husband.

23
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:29,347
Could you could stop by the market?
I'm out of shaving cream.

24
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:32,050
And during the errands
I ran in the afternoons...

25
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:35,060
You'll save a bunch
if you come on Fridays.

26
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:37,824
...even at my work every evening...

27
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:41,128
What a lovely calendar.
Was this taken around here?

28
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:44,932
No, that's way out in Fairview.
I have family there.

29
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:47,529
Isn't it idyllic?

30
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,802
Here, Angela. You can file this.

31
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:55,939
...to me, each day
was gray and meaningless.

32
00:01:57,817 --> 00:02:01,548
And then one night, suddenly...

33
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,488
- Hey, Angela.
...there was color.

34
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:09,119
Deidre? What are you doing here?

35
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:11,425
I need some money.

36
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,770
Deidre. Here.

37
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,340
- You're using again, aren't you?
- No.

38
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:30,940
I've just got to get some food
for my baby. Some other stuff.

39
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:34,180
If the baby's hungry, come to the market
and I'll buy food.

40
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:36,415
I can shop for my own baby, OK?

41
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:40,755
- [Baby cries]
- Quiet. I can't think.

42
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:45,093
See this watch? It's worth a lot.
I'll give it to you for 50 bucks.

43
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,362
- She's not giving you money.
- Do you mind?

44
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:53,201
Angela, you're the only one at rehab
who treated me like a person.

45
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:56,606
Please. Please don't stop now.

46
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:59,408
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,114
I'll sell you my baby.

48
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:12,821
- What?
- I know you can't have your own.

49
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:15,622
- It's been killing you.
- It's time that you left.

50
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,721
I'm thinking about Dana.
You'll give him a good home.

51
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:20,959
OK? He'll be better off.

52
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,764
- [Cries]
- Shh! Quiet!

53
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:28,498
Honey.

54
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:36,214
How much money
do you keep in the house?

55
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:38,409
[Dana cries]

56
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:52,324
She has a ten-month-old baby.
Where is it?

57
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:57,131
I don't know. If we'd seen a kid we
wouldn't have left it in a crack house.

58
00:03:57,203 --> 00:04:01,037
- I will have your badge.
- Just let me do my job, huh?

59
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:03,735
We'll post an officer
at the junkie's bedside,

60
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,745
we'll let her tell us
where she left her kid.

61
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:39,406
I really do hope you folks
will be happy here in Fairview.

62
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,003
Thank you.

63
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,776
- And we were.
- Wave bye, Zach.

64
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,545
Wave bye-bye.

65
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:49,179
We were as happy as any family could be.

66
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:58,390
Until one night thre years later...

67
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:03,258
when there was a knock at our door.

68
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,803
And I was desperate once again.

69
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:20,676
It was 5:00 in the morning on Wisteria
Lane when the phone calls started.

70
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:24,751
Each of them knew something was wrong

71
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,451
from that first ring.

72
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:27,515
Hello?

73
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:29,561
[Rings]

74
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:32,928
It's an unwritten rule of suburbia...

75
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,125
Hello?

76
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,895
[Phone rings]

77
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:37,560
Don't call the neighbors

78
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:39,264
in the middle of the night

79
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,864
unless the news is bad.

80
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:42,930
Hello?

81
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,239
And so they came,

82
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:46,869
with their uncombed hair

83
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:49,506
and their unmade faces.

84
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:51,607
They came because

85
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:54,050
after all these years...

86
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,109
Bree.

87
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:59,215
...they were no longerjust neighbors.

88
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:03,293
What are you... doing here?

89
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,524
We heard Rex had a heart attack.

90
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:06,587
How is he?

91
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,726
Um... He's stable.

92
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:12,066
But they have to put in a pacemaker,

93
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:14,129
so they're gonna need to operate.

94
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,675
- How did you guys know?
- Danielle called.

95
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,105
So how are you doing?

96
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:22,204
We were having a fight when he...

97
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:25,216
got the heart attack and...

98
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:28,811
I'm feeling guilty 'cause I should have
gotten him here sooner and...

99
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,856
Honey, the doctors here are great.

100
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:33,221
He's gonna bounce right back.

101
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:35,385
You have nothing to worry about.

102
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:39,591
You know what? I am so happy
that you guys came here. I really am.

103
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:41,997
But I am trying hard to be strong,

104
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,195
so if you keep comforting me...

105
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,067
You're gonna lose it?

106
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,800
Then we won't comfort.

107
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:48,863
Thank you.

108
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:52,536
We'll just talk about non-crisis things.

109
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,842
Oh, I know. I found Mrs. Huber's journal

110
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,217
in some of Mike's stuff.

111
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:03,915
She knew Mary Alice's secret

112
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,423
and was blackmailing her.

113
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,256
Yep, that'll do it.

114
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:16,391
Zachary, come back here, please.

115
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:28,740
Your father said
you should let me look after you.

116
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:31,909
I will be fine by myself.
I am not a child.

117
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:38,487
I know you're not a child,

118
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,458
but I think we should discuss this.

119
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:42,153
I'm fine. Really.

120
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:44,321
Why should you fend for yourself

121
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:46,297
when you can just come home with me?

122
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:49,163
Let me shoulder the burden.
It would be my pleasure.

123
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:52,227
What kind of freak are you?
Just leave me alone.

124
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,465
You are not my mother.

125
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:57,566
I told you that I am fine.
Stop acting like my mother and go home.

126
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:00,339
I wish it were that easy, Zachary,

127
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:01,846
for your sake.

128
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:04,280
But it's not.

129
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,443
Your father's not coming back.

130
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:09,613
- He said that he was.
- He lied.

131
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:11,623
I wanted to spare you this,

132
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:14,558
but your father and I discussed it

133
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:16,959
and he decided

134
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:19,327
that he shouldn't come back.

135
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:26,394
Get your bag and let's go home.

136
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:31,606
I'm gonna make you some pudding.

137
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:44,314
What did you do to my dad?

138
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,687
[Mrs. Tillman screams]

139
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:47,453
[Zach] Tell me!

140
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:51,320
[Edie] Mrs. Applewhite?

141
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:52,386
Yes?

142
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:54,126
Hi. I'm Edie Britt.

143
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:57,865
The realtor who helped you
buy this house.

144
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:00,098
Oh! Of course. Hi.

145
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:03,198
Hi. I've been so curious to meet you.

146
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:05,710
Really? Why?

147
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:10,341
It's just that I've never sold a house
over the phone before.

148
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,250
You were brave
buying a place site unseen.

149
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,309
Not really.

150
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:18,880
It was just what we were looking for.

151
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,119
This is my son, Matthew.

152
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:22,751
It's nice to meet you, ma'am.

153
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:24,819
Please, call me Edie.

154
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,889
Ma'am is for middle-aged women.

155
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:31,128
Like her.

156
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:35,903
You can call her ma'am
any time you want.

157
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:38,535
So are you two finding everything OK?

158
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:41,079
We didn't do
our realtor's walkthrough.

159
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:43,843
Everything is fine.

160
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,645
Oh, honey. Escrow's closed.

161
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:48,915
Now I can show you where
to put the buckets when it rains.

162
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,456
Edie, the house is fine.

163
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:55,590
But how lovely of you to stop by.

164
00:09:57,129 --> 00:10:01,759
OK. Here is my card.

165
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:04,200
Call any time you want.

166
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,535
Bye.

167
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:19,242
People are very friendly
in this neighborhood.

168
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:22,685
Yes. Yes, they are.

169
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,916
Mike, hi, sweetie.
I hope the job's going well.

170
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,929
Um... So... I hope you're not mad

171
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:34,160
but I found Mrs. Huber's journal
in your truck

172
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:37,634
and I couldn't exactly not read it,
so I did,

173
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:42,231
and I know all about the blackmail,
so call me, we'll talk.

174
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,173
Love you. Bye.

175
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:47,679
I haven't heard back
and I was getting a little concerned.

176
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:52,081
The girls and I were talking and we
think maybe Paul Young killed Mrs. Huber

177
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,915
and if he did
maybe he killed your old girlfriend too

178
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:59,287
so we should really talk about this,
so call me. I love you. Bye.

179
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:01,918
I thought the whole point
of having a cell phone

180
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,258
was so someone could reach you.

181
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,458
How can we move forward
if you won't communicate with me?

182
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:10,400
Mike, I need you to call me back.
I mean it.

183
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:12,266
Love you. Bye.

184
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:16,669
I'm so sorry for that last phone call.

185
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:20,337
Um... let's just say
it was the worry talking.

186
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:23,814
- I just really need to talk to you...
- [phone bleps]

187
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:27,148
Can you hang on? I got another call.

188
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:28,914
- Hello.
- [Mike] Hey, it's me.

189
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:31,548
Oh, my God! Where have you been?

190
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:34,684
The reception's lousy up here
but I got your messages.

191
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,251
I'm really sorry for that last message.

192
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:39,456
- I was just uh...
- Stressed out?

193
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,558
Yes, let's call it stressed out.

194
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:47,197
Uh... So how did you get
Martha Huber's journal?

195
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:50,174
Oh, her sister, Mrs. Tillman,
gave it to me.

196
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:54,008
She was helping me with my search.

197
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,516
I really think we need
to give it to the police.

198
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:00,711
- [Starts engine]
- Um... yeah.

199
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:03,311
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Really?

200
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,653
When I get through with this job,

201
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,922
we'll make an appointment
with that detective. Copeland.

202
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:11,519
Great. That's great.

203
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:14,327
All right.
So I'II... see you in a few hours.

204
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:19,667
OK. Hurry, though. I have a feeling Paul
Young is in the middle of all of this.

205
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,934
Well, let's not rush to judgment.

206
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:44,551
- What are you doing here?
- I'm here to testify for you.

207
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:49,192
Can you take those off?
There's no way I'm dressing him.

208
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:54,604
Gabby, thank God you're doing this.

209
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:59,907
Beating up a second gay guy looks bad.

210
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:02,072
Yes, well, Carlos, in some circles,

211
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,616
beating people up at all
is frowned upon.

212
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:06,776
So why did you change your mind?

213
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,881
I'm about to be
the mother of your child,

214
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:13,413
which means a lot of responsibility
and little time for myself.

215
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:16,984
So if I'm gonna get you out of
this mess, you have to reciprocate.

216
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:18,256
OK.

217
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,594
When the baby cries
during the night,

218
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:24,500
you're going to get up,
without saying one word.

219
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:29,007
Doctor's appointments, you're driving.
I won't put a car seat in my Maserati.

220
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:32,566
And you will also be on bottle duty.

221
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,443
That means washing,
sterilizing and filling.

222
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:39,314
I'll have some semblance of a life
and maybe I won't hate you so much.

223
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:44,155
All right. There we go.

224
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:47,021
So we're good?

225
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:49,720
- See you in court.
- Hey, Gabby.

226
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:53,030
Aren't we breastfeeding?

227
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:57,467
Oh, honey, if you can swing that one,
more power to you.

228
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:03,364
Can I buy my own pizza?

229
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:05,706
You can, honey, if you can pay for it.

230
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:07,609
[Cheering]

231
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,116
That is 19, 19, 19-zip. Bring it.

232
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:14,516
Just stay here with Penny
for a second, OK?

233
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:17,752
Tom.

234
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:22,487
Yes! In your face.
That is 20-zip. Game. Out.

235
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:25,189
Tom. What are you doin'?

236
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:28,700
Playing air hockey, what does it
look like? Kevin, you're up.

237
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:31,531
It's the middle of the day.
Shouldn't you be at work?

238
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:33,731
Mm, no. I quit.

239
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,539
- You did not.
- Yes.

240
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,408
Yesterday.
Told Peterson he could stick it.

241
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:43,539
Boom! You're not bringing it, Kevin.
Bring it.

242
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:46,710
Could you talk to me for a second?
I don't understand.

243
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:50,653
What? You asked Peterson's wife
to make sure he wouldn't promote me.

244
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,419
So he gives a huge promotion
to Annabel so I quit.

245
00:14:57,963 --> 00:15:00,761
What don't you understand?

246
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,597
OK.

247
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:07,867
OK. Could we go home
and talk about this, please?

248
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,432
No, we can't. Serve it up, meat.

249
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:16,409
You're just gonna stay here
and play games all day?

250
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:18,211
No, I'm gonna get some ice cream

251
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:23,187
and then I'm gonna go to the lake, maybe
rent a boat, do whatever I feel like.

252
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,950
- God!
- [Kevin] Got you!

253
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:26,048
Tom...

254
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,855
Go home before
I say something I regret. Go home.

255
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:37,467
All right. You.

256
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:40,733
You score this next point,
you get your bike back.

257
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,817
What are you thinking about?

258
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:56,582
Oh. Uh... I was just um...

259
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:59,317
thinking that I need
to start spring-cleaning.

260
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:02,849
- You haven't done that yet?
- No, and I need to clean our gutters

261
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:04,953
and beneath the refrigerator,

262
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:08,329
and it's so long since
I replaced the shelf liners so...

263
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,766
You'll finish off
with our wedding silver.

264
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:13,327
How did you know that?

265
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:18,240
All those years, you didn't think
I was paying attention. But I was.

266
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,746
- Do you know why I save it for last?
- No.

267
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,146
Because it makes me think
of my Aunt Fern.

268
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:28,312
On the day we got married,
I told her how happy I was.

269
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:31,322
She told me that even during bad times

270
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,621
to always remember
that the best was yet to come.

271
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:40,222
So as I polish it, I think about you
and the kids and our life.

272
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:42,460
And how right she was.

273
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:48,202
- They're gonna operate on me.
- I know.

274
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:51,765
I wanna say some stuff.
I mean, just in case...

275
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,335
Rex, you don't have to say anything.

276
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:57,940
I'm sorry for everything I did.

277
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:03,478
The moving out, the infidelity,
the sex stuff.

278
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:06,353
It doesn't matter.

279
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:11,124
From here on in,
can we just say that we're even?

280
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:15,895
- OK.
- Thanks.

281
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,771
And for the record,

282
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:28,677
you are gonna come through
this operation just fine.

283
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,475
How can you be so sure?

284
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:37,011
Because I told you...
The best is yet to come.

285
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,430
Don't forget to feed Bongo.

286
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:57,270
Thanks. I'll go do that now.

287
00:17:57,342 --> 00:18:01,039
Go on in the car, sweetie.
I have to talk to your mom real quick.

288
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:06,515
So you're gonna go live in sin
with the plumber slash ex-con?

289
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:11,284
It's funny you should mention sin.
Adultery still falls in that category.

290
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:15,918
I don't like the idea of this guy
being around Julie 24l7.

291
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:18,562
He's a good person.

292
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:22,396
Mike's cool, Dad. He cares about us
a lot and I like having him around.

293
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:24,402
So don't mess this up.

294
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:28,603
You heard the girl.

295
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:33,042
He's still a plumber.

296
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:52,459
- [Growls]
- You be a good boy, Bongo.

297
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:55,056
Or you're gonna go to bed hungry.

298
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:04,332
Hi, Miss Mayer.

299
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,439
Will you sit down, please?

300
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:41,473
- I'm just gonna go get some water.
- I'd rather you didn't.

301
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:52,587
Don't answer it.

302
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:01,665
I know you're in there, Susan.

303
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:05,831
I can see you.

304
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:11,239
If you don't want to talk to me, fine.
At least have the courtesy to hide.

305
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:21,812
All right, but don't let her in.

306
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,687
Edie, what a pleasant surprise.

307
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:31,422
Right. Is Mike home?

308
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:35,424
Uh... no. He's on a big plumbing job.
What's up?

309
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,730
- Can I come in?
- Why?

310
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:41,762
I'm warning all the neighbors.
Felicia Tillman was attacked.

311
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,070
- She was?
- At the Young house.

312
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:47,236
They took her away in an ambulance.
I'm freaked out.

313
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:50,213
My guys haven't shown up
at the job site yet.

314
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:54,446
I'm over there all alone. Could I just
come in and hang out for a while?

315
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:58,285
[Mouths words]

316
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:00,052
Stick it up my... What?!

317
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,395
Just get the hell out of here.

318
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:06,988
God, you are such a bitch.

319
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:12,892
Why?

320
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:17,840
I asked Mrs. Tillman to tell me
the truth about my father. She did.

321
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:20,673
What did she say?

322
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:23,180
Mr. Delfino took my dad away
to kill him.

323
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:25,512
Now I'm gonna kill Mr. Delfino.

324
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:36,018
You Honor, this whole mess
is just a result of my Ioneliness.

325
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,424
My marriage is a bit strained.

326
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,364
After Carlos was convicted...

327
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:46,803
No one's been convicted yet, Mrs. Solis.
This is just a grand jury hearing.

328
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:49,500
Oh, no, I'm talking about
his other crime.

329
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:51,906
Oh. Right.

330
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:54,775
Go ahead.

331
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:57,110
Anyways,
he was placed under house arrest

332
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:59,309
and he being the jealous man that he is,

333
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:02,581
got a little crazy
every time I left the house.

334
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:06,317
He knows how men look at me and...

335
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:09,952
Well, I didn't exactly ease his mind.

336
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:16,795
I... falsely led him to believe
I was having an affair.

337
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:22,903
Before Carlos' house arrest, he was
always working and he was never with me.

338
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:26,967
I thought that maybe if he believed
I was having an affair...

339
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:29,910
he would realize he loved me.

340
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:32,313
I know it sounds stupid. I do. I just...

341
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:34,944
Is there a point to this?

342
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,979
My point is that Carlos
is an angry, jealous Neanderthal.

343
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:45,089
But he's not a gay-basher.

344
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:49,500
All right. I've heard enough.
Counsel, approach.

345
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:54,994
I gotta be honest.
I don't think we have a hate crime here.

346
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:11,184
Just so you know,
you beat up the wrong guy.

347
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:14,316
Didn't you think it was strange
that you had the only lawn

348
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:17,794
that needed to be mowed
three times a week?

349
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,835
You are so dead.

350
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:36,337
- You are so dead.
- [Judge] Order!

351
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,042
No! Carlos!

352
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:40,050
[Man] He's doing it again!

353
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:42,177
[Shouting]

354
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,654
For God's sake, somebody stop him!

355
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:47,248
Stop it!

356
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:49,987
- [Judge] We will have order!
- I'll kill you!

357
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:51,585
[Carlos shouts in Spanish]

358
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:55,326
- I am going to kill you!
- Order!

359
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,564
[Judge bangs gavel] Please be seated.
We will have order.

360
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:30,625
Get out.

361
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:40,868
I'm not trying to justify anything
but Martha Huber ruined lives.

362
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:43,938
For fun. She destroyed my family.

363
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:46,575
- This isn't about her.
- I don't understand.

364
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,482
Walk.

365
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:59,729
Remember when we first tested you,
your potassium level was a bit high?

366
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:01,925
Yes. You made me stop eating bananas.

367
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,026
But as we've continued testing,
it's kept climbing.

368
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:07,970
We've now run an entire battery of tests

369
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:10,974
and your kidney function is fine.

370
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:14,205
It has to be something you're ingesting.

371
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,372
Let me see.

372
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:24,988
These numbers can't be right.

373
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:28,949
Who prepares your meals?

374
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:36,960
Bree.

375
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:40,994
I understand you've been having
some marital problems.

376
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:50,005
- Wait a minute.
- Was there an incident at a salad bar?

377
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:52,982
She gave you onions
when she knew you were allergic.

378
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:57,020
That was an accident.

379
00:25:57,088 --> 00:26:00,489
You're getting this potassium
from somewhere.

380
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,293
- Get out.
- Rex...

381
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:05,659
I mean it.

382
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,197
Get out.

383
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:15,137
Leave the chart.

384
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:18,141
I want to read it.

385
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,356
[Door opens]

386
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:54,034
So did you have a fun day?

387
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:59,378
As a matter of fact, I did.

388
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:04,455
I probably had the most fun
that I have had in a long time.

389
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,255
You know, I didn't tell you to quit.

390
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:09,725
No. No, no, no.

391
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:14,891
But you made damn sure that
I'd go nowhere for the next 20 years.

392
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:20,367
I don't know what to say.

393
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:22,804
I hear "Please forgive me" is popular.

394
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:26,275
Yes, I am sorry. I am so, so sorry.

395
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:28,244
I didn't want to hurt you.

396
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:31,441
But I was trying to protect our family.

397
00:27:31,516 --> 00:27:36,112
If you got a promotion, we never would
have seen you. You would have been...

398
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:37,882
Lynette, you're right.

399
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:43,160
You're right. You're right. That
promotion would have just killed us.

400
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:46,356
So this is gonna all work out.

401
00:27:49,734 --> 00:27:52,032
What does that mean?

402
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:55,334
It means that I can use the break.

403
00:27:55,407 --> 00:28:00,071
Oh. Well, yeah. I think it would be good
for you to take some time off.

404
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:02,136
No, not some time. Full-time.

405
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:04,943
I'm gonna be a stay-at-home dad.

406
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:06,777
Huh?

407
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:09,945
What the heck?
You earn the living for a while.

408
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:13,787
Tom, that's... crazy.

409
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,621
Why? Why is it crazy?

410
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:19,095
You and I both know
that you're better at the ad game.

411
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:22,065
And you tell me all the time
how hard it is to be a mom.

412
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:25,432
Well, yes, it is hard.
But I love it, too.

413
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:30,099
I've been doing it for six years and
I haven't complained... the entire time.

414
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:32,370
Fair enough. Fair enough.

415
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:34,241
But be honest.

416
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:38,942
Secretly, you miss the ad game,
don't you?

417
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:44,114
You miss the pressure
and the deadlines and the power lunches.

418
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:46,282
Or am I wrong?

419
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:51,158
Maybe you want to sort dirty socks
the rest of your life.

420
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:57,728
We should talk about this seriously
before we make any rash decisions.

421
00:28:57,802 --> 00:29:01,203
I already made the decision.
You're going back to work.

422
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:18,851
Can I at least
get you something to eat, Zach?

423
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:22,415
Maybe a soda. Thanks.

424
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:34,161
I gotta say,
I think you're making a mistake.

425
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:36,707
Mike couldn't kill anybody.

426
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:41,576
I mean, this could just be
a misunderstanding.

427
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:43,739
This is not a misunderstanding.

428
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:45,442
I know you're upset,

429
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:48,782
but is this what you think
your mother would want you doing?

430
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:52,254
- Probably not.
- Exactly.

431
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:54,985
Because she raised you right.

432
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:58,324
Look, you have been through a lot.
You've lost your mom.

433
00:29:58,396 --> 00:30:02,196
You're still carrying the guilt
of what happened to your baby sister.

434
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:05,532
- I never had a baby sister.
- Honey, I know about Dana.

435
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:08,731
How stupid are you? I'm Dana.

436
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:12,334
My mother was some junkie.
They stole me and changed my name.

437
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:17,438
They have been lying to me
my entire life. Everyone lies to me!

438
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:21,042
My mother, my father,
Mrs. Tillman, even Julie.

439
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:23,553
Do you understand how much that hurts?

440
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:25,816
Look, Zach.

441
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:29,553
I know you're upset.
Let's just sit down and talk.

442
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:31,822
Why? So you can lie to me also?

443
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:40,064
No more talking.

444
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:45,740
[Breathes heavily]

445
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:23,146
[Phone rings]

446
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:36,387
- Hello?
- Bre, it's Dr. Craig.

447
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:40,659
I'm at the hospital
and I'm afraid I have some bad news.

448
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:45,396
- Oh?
- Rex passed away ten minutes ago.

449
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:57,314
But his operation is not until tomorrow.

450
00:31:57,382 --> 00:32:01,409
I know. He just didn't make it.

451
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:04,512
I'm so sorry.
We did everything we could.

452
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:12,256
- Bre?
- Yes. Of course you did.

453
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,662
Thank you very much for calling.

454
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,871
[Sobs]

455
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:07,739
This is a long way to go to do what you
could have done in my back yard.

456
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:11,145
You're kind of taking your time.
Walking a lot.

457
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:16,175
You sure you know what you're doing? You
ever had to kill anyone for real before?

458
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:19,613
Yeah.

459
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:22,318
Oh.

460
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:26,295
But since you're so tired of walking,
let's just do this here.

461
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:37,708
I don't expect any favors from you,
obviously.

462
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:41,677
But could you at least do me the
courtesy of telling me why we're here?

463
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:53,186
You knew Deidre.

464
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:55,054
Yeah.

465
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:57,356
And I know what you did to her.

466
00:34:58,563 --> 00:35:01,088
She was just a sad girl
with a lot of problems.

467
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:04,328
She did some terrible, crazy,
selfish stuff.

468
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:08,361
But you tell me what she
ever could have done to deserve death

469
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,703
at the hands of somebody like you.

470
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:16,647
It's complicated.

471
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:22,043
It's so... complicated.

472
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:26,784
And just like that,
my husband began sharing my secrets.

473
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,151
You want some carrot, Zachary?

474
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:34,323
Secrets I had died to protect.

475
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:39,033
There you go.

476
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:44,400
We have to get that fence up in the
back yard before the pool's finished.

477
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:47,444
- I know.
- I'm serious.

478
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:49,309
You know kids are drawn to water.

479
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,553
Hello, Angela.

480
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:17,463
You did a good job covering your tracks.

481
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:21,111
I had to spend
a lot of money hunting you down.

482
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:24,671
Congratulations. You found us.

483
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:27,843
You know, I never
told the police what happened.

484
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:28,908
You didn't?

485
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:31,284
They would have put Dana in foster care.

486
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,949
Or worse, given him to my father.

487
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:37,755
So I kept our little secret.

488
00:36:38,996 --> 00:36:42,329
Well, we appreciate that.

489
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,598
Anyway, I guess you can see
I've gotten myself cleaned up.

490
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,862
Yes, you look lovely.

491
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:54,002
I'm not the same person
you knew back then, Angela.

492
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:56,638
I'm in a good place now.

493
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:01,345
You can't have him.

494
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:04,752
I didn't go to the police before
but I can do it now.

495
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:06,983
- Zach is our son.
- His name is Dana.

496
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:10,494
If you think I'm giving my baby
to some junkie, you're crazy.

497
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,825
- He's not your baby.
- Just calm down.

498
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:15,092
You were always so high and mighty,

499
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:17,498
looking down on us poor degenerates,

500
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:21,732
pretending you wanted to help when all
you really wanted was to feel superior.

501
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:25,105
- You self-righteous bitch.
- You're still using.

502
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:27,007
Go to hell. What are you doing?

503
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,273
- Let me see your arm.
- I said I'm clean!

504
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:32,180
- Just take it easy.
- Where do you think you're going?

505
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,377
I'm getting my son and taking him home.

506
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:38,183
- Paul, stop her.
- Please. Come on.

507
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,053
- Sit down!
- Get your hands off me!

508
00:37:41,158 --> 00:37:43,888
We raised him! We're his parents!

509
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,559
Come on.

510
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:48,599
Paul!

511
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:58,067
Don't worry. I'll give him a good home.

512
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,545
No!

513
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:16,482
[Deidre moans and coughs]

514
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:22,790
[Deidre gasps for breath]

515
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:30,168
Oh, Mary Alice. What did you do?

516
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:46,587
[Zach] Mommy?

517
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:51,123
It's OK, Zach.

518
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:56,727
Mommy needs to borrow your toy chest.

519
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,497
You go back to sleep, OK?

520
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:14,210
What are we gonna do?

521
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:19,183
You said they were pouring the concrete
for the pool tomorrow?

522
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:22,089
- You can't be serious.
- They'll never find her.

523
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:25,651
- We can put her in this.
- She won't fit.

524
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:28,857
Then we'll have to make her fit.

525
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,635
- What are you doing?
- Checking for track marks.

526
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,937
Deidre had a baby?

527
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:22,845
Let's get this over with.

528
00:40:57,655 --> 00:41:00,715
It's an odd thing
to look back on the world,

529
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:03,726
to watch those I left behind,

530
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:08,663
each, in her own way,
so brave, so determined,

531
00:41:08,732 --> 00:41:11,599
and so very desperate.

532
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:17,601
Desperate to venture out,

533
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:20,872
but afraid of what she'll miss
when she goes.

534
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:26,781
Desperate to get everything she wants,

535
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:31,515
even when she's not exactly sure
of what that is.

536
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:39,355
Desperate for life to be perfect again,

537
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:43,958
although she realizes
it never really was.

538
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:50,831
Desperate for a better future,

539
00:41:50,908 --> 00:41:55,140
if she can find a way
to escape her past.

540
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:04,721
I not only watch, I cher them on,
these amazing women.

541
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:11,517
I hope so much
they'll find what they're looking for.

542
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:16,698
But I know not all of them will.

543
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:20,700
Sadly...

544
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:26,270
that's just not the way life works.

545
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:31,738
Not everyone gets a happy ending.
