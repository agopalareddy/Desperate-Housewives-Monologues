00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,367
Previously on Desperate Housewives...

3
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:06,796
One was careless...

4
00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:10,331
You put a woman into a coma.
Surely, that arouses some emotion.

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,844
- Well, it doesn't.
- You and I are finished.

6
00:00:12,912 --> 00:00:15,107
One said goodbye.

7
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:17,183
I'm tired of feeling like a failure.

8
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:18,614
One almost lost it.

9
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:21,448
Your wife didn't kill herself
because of my note,

10
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,989
but because of what she did
to that poor baby.

11
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:27,652
And one got exactly
what she deserved.

12
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:36,424
Gabrielle was waiting
for her next great idea.

13
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:39,734
Her first great idea
came when she was 15,

14
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:43,207
after her stepfather
paid her a late-night visit.

15
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:47,541
She bought a bus ticket to New York
the very next day.

16
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:49,809
Her next occurred five years later

17
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:54,115
when she decided to seduce
a famous fashion photographer.

18
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,953
One wek later she began her carer
as a runway model,

19
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,756
which soon led
to her next great idea,

20
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:06,458
her decision to marry Carlos Solis.

21
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:11,868
Before she knew it, she had jumped off
the runway and moved to the suburbs.

22
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:17,375
Her most recent great idea was born
out of her boredom with her new life.

23
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:21,971
That's how she came to start an affair
with her tenage gardener,

24
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:26,018
which was cut short
by a tragic accident.

25
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:30,954
So, once again, Gabrielle
was in ned of a great idea.

26
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:34,050
I know you're worried,
but it's gonna take time.

27
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:36,652
Hm? What is?

28
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:41,200
You look sad. I assumed you were
thinking about your mother-in-law.

29
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:44,930
- Oh, no.
- So, uh, what were you thinking about?

30
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:51,175
My life. It hasn't turned out
like I thought it would.

31
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:55,111
- Oh, honey.
- Oh, no. I know I shouldn't complain.

32
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:59,015
It's just there's something missing
and I don't know what it is.

33
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:01,849
- Do you ever feel that way?
- No.

34
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,788
When I go home at night,
I sleep like a baby.

35
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:07,825
I know I did something
that day that helped people.

36
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:10,590
- That must be a nice feeling.
- Hm. It is.

37
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:13,496
There's times I wish
I didn't have to work so hard.

38
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:16,433
We got a nursing shortage
and they cut our budget.

39
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:21,304
Attention, all available personnel.
Code blue, stat, room 214.

40
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:24,207
- Excuse me.
- All available personnel.

41
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:26,609
Code blue, stat.

42
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:29,011
[Rapid bleping]

43
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:31,607
Get a doctor in here.
I don't have an airway.

44
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:35,950
No time. I have to intubate.
Mr. Getz. Mr. Getz, listen.

45
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:39,549
You're not dying on me, OK?
This tube is to help you breathe.

46
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,719
I need you to be brave now.

47
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:46,128
It was then that Gabrielle
got her next great idea.

48
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:52,934
She decided to throw the first Annual
Sacred Heart Charity Fashion Show

49
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,406
to raise money for more nursing staff.

50
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:59,569
Gaby, I can't do it. I cannot walk down
a runway in one of these dresses.

51
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:04,048
They all make me look so fat.
Please get someone to take my place.

52
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:07,416
Listen, Betty! OK?
You're not quitting on me now.

53
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:11,753
We'll find you a gown that's black
and slimming and you'll look great.

54
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:15,089
- I need you to be brave now.
- OK.

55
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:20,963
And that night when she went to bed,
Gabrielle slept like a baby.

56
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:08,946
News of the fashion show
spread quickly on Wisteria Lane.

57
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:12,542
Though the event was for charity,
Gabrielle soon discovered

58
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:15,587
when it came to the latest fashions,

59
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:19,182
women are seldom charitable.

60
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:22,728
No one knew this better
than Edie Britt.

61
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:31,227
She understood that treachery
never goes out of style.

62
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,034
- Susan.
- Give me the dress.

63
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:41,069
- I gave it a shot.
- Hm.

64
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,175
Hi, Helen. How's the dress fitting?

65
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:48,687
Great. Maybe it could be taken out
in the shoulder a little.

66
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,847
Sure. No problem.

67
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,351
There you go.

68
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,190
Gabrielle,
I never thanked you properly.

69
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:59,527
- For what?
- For what you did for my son.

70
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:03,693
It was so nice of you to hire John
as your gardener.

71
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,637
Believe me, it's been my pleasure.

72
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:08,765
- How's he doing?
- Good, good.

73
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,935
I hear he's dating
Danielle Van De Kamp.

74
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:15,879
For now. It's just a matter of time
before they break up for good.

75
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:17,415
What's wrong?

76
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:21,214
She just seems to want much more
of a relationship than he does.

77
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,518
You remember what it was like
dating teenage boys.

78
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:26,683
- Vaguely.
- Thank you.

79
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:29,250
Tell Tanaka that if he doesn't call me

80
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:33,765
I'm gonna go down to his office,
find him and kick his ass!

81
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:38,234
Ladies.

82
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,233
- Trouble at work?
- I don't know.

83
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:47,541
He's making money left and right.
I just wish he'd relax.

84
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:53,483
Crap, crap, crap! I'm telling you,
all of the good dresses are taken.

85
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:55,884
Now, what the hell
am I supposed to wear?

86
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:59,857
Well, Mrs. Huber never showed up.
Why don't you wear this one?

87
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:07,728
This is an old-lady dress.
You won't even be able to see my body.

88
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:10,359
Edie, you're always thinking of others.

89
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:12,597
So why isn't Mrs. Huber here?

90
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,606
Last I heard,
she went to visit her sister.

91
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:18,838
I just can't believe that Martha
would agree to wear this.

92
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:22,312
She always says she'd never be
caught dead in black.

93
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:28,714
Sadly for Mrs. Huber,
this was no longer the case.

94
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:01,786
- [Door closes]
- Hey, Mom.

95
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:04,516
Julie, you got a letter from Zach.

96
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,684
- Isn't that weird, him writing you?
- Yeah.

97
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,662
Well, open. Open, open. He could
have said something about Dana.

98
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:15,633
- I'll read it later.
- Later? What's wrong with now?

99
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:17,999
I've got tons of homework, Mom.

100
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:21,096
- Julie, what's going on?
- [Sighs]

101
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:23,802
This isn't the first letter from Zach.

102
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:27,710
We've been writing each other
the last couple of weeks.

103
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:31,944
- Are you mad?
- No. Just when I was your age,

104
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:35,613
my pen pal lived on a farm in Ohio,
not in a mental institution.

105
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:38,316
That letter is one notch
above prison mail.

106
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:41,087
Zach's not crazy.
He's just upset over his Mom,

107
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:44,061
and his Dad doesn't
even seem to care.

108
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:47,826
He just... needs a friend.

109
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:55,373
I've packed the diapers, I'm getting
the juice boxes and carrot sticks...

110
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,875
- Sunscreen?
- Got it.

111
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,207
I go pick up the boys, we hit the park,

112
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:04,750
and that should give you
a good couple of hours.

113
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:08,216
Enjoy the vacation.

114
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:13,156
- [Baby coughs]
- What?

115
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:18,027
While you're gone, I'll be paying bills
and sorting laundry and cooking dinner.

116
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:21,759
So what part of that
sounds like a vacation?

117
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,302
OK, right. We'll pick up dinner.

118
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:28,237
You just take a hot bath,
relax, recharge.

119
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:36,110
OK, I get it. It's gonna take
more than a hot bath to recharge.

120
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:38,376
But don't forget, I'm here all week.

121
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:40,179
Then what?

122
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,490
And then we go back to normal?

123
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:48,219
Tom, our last version of normal
had me popping pills.

124
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:51,695
Normal is a bad, bad plan.

125
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:55,131
We'll put our heads together
and come up with a solution.

126
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:58,897
I think we need to hire
a nanny full time.

127
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:03,931
- God, it's just such a big commitment.
- I know, and we can't afford it.

128
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,776
And I know everything
that's happened is my fault,

129
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,212
but if I don't get some help,

130
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:14,379
there's an excellent chance
I will lose my mind.

131
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:19,082
OK. Well, then,
we have to make it work.

132
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:21,750
[Sighs]

133
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:23,055
[Boy] No, no, no.

134
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:25,925
Next up: 200-meter frestyle.

135
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:31,194
- It's just not right.
- What?

136
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:35,968
A woman is in a coma because of Andrew,
and there he is, happy as a clam.

137
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:40,672
We grounded him, took away his TV.
How else you wanna punish him?

138
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:44,876
Swimmers, take your marks.

139
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:47,077
[Hooter]

140
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,786
I think we should make him
quit the swim team.

141
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:56,626
Bree, this is the one thing in his life
that he's passionate about.

142
00:09:56,729 --> 00:10:00,358
Maybe if we take it away from him,
he'll understand what he did.

143
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,163
He has not shown an ounce of remorse.

144
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,705
Of course he feels bad.
He's just keeping up a facade.

145
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:09,206
Well, he's doing a fabulous job.

146
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:12,937
If we take him off the team,
he'll lose his shot at a scholarship

147
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:15,071
and he's never gonna forgive us.

148
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:19,675
If he grows up with some humanity,
that's a risk I am willing to take.

149
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:23,017
- Well, I'm not.
- You don't love him as much as I do.

150
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:25,990
- Isn't that nice?
- It's a fact. I'm his mother.

151
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:28,117
He lived inside of me.

152
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:30,923
He hung out in your womb
back in the '80s.

153
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:33,522
I have grown to love him
as much as you.

154
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,624
[Whistle]

155
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:41,862
- What just happened?
- That kid you both love won the race.

156
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:46,102
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

157
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:00,748
That's what she tells me, anyway.

158
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,893
John.

159
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:11,402
My mom said you needed volunteers,
so I volunteered.

160
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,369
Oh.

161
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:16,931
- Finally got the charity bug?
- You sound surprised.

162
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:20,843
No, not really.
You were always a giver.

163
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:24,906
Would you knock it off?
My mom's right over there.

164
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:29,151
Have a seat.

165
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:33,487
You can start by helping us
alphabetize the donation cards.

166
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:42,359
So, word is
you and Danielle might break up.

167
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:44,560
Maybe. I don't know.

168
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:48,971
- Is that because of me?
- Not everything is about you.

169
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:06,448
- Would you stop that?
- Have you been thinking about me?

170
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:09,358
- No.
- Really?

171
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:13,393
Could have fooled me.

172
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:20,096
- Hey. Do you need any help?
- Please. Just pull up a chair.

173
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:22,231
- Oh, gosh.
- That's OK. I got it.

174
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:34,343
Ow! Ow!

175
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:44,387
[Knocking]

176
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:48,497
Susan, hi. Wanna help
with the seating cards?

177
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:53,937
Wanna tell me why you had your foot
in John Rowland's crotch yesterday?

178
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:58,237
Oh, that. He was helping me
adjust the seam in my stocking,

179
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:02,508
and from your angle
it must have looked a little weird.

180
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,982
You're sleeping with him, aren't you?

181
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:09,748
OK, yes, but you have to promise
not to tell anybody.

182
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:14,088
Gabrielle, he's in high school,
and... it's illegal and you're married.

183
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:16,457
If Carlos found out,
this would kill him.

184
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,895
It's just sex. It's totally harmless.

185
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:21,967
How can you call
something like this harmless

186
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:25,663
after everything you know
about I went through with Karl?

187
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:28,070
- This isn't about you.
- Yes, it is.

188
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:32,270
Me and every other person who was
screwed over by somebody they loved.

189
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:35,972
When Karl ran off with Brandi
you saw what a basket case I was.

190
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:39,176
I was tearing up his clothes.
I couldn't get out of bed.

191
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:41,685
You were there.
How could you do the same?

192
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:44,450
How can you compare me to Karl?
That's not fair.

193
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:47,526
- You have no idea about my life.
- Enlighten me.

194
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:51,427
You're beautiful, you have money
and a husband who adores you.

195
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:54,260
No, he doesn't adore me.
He adores having me.

196
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,393
That's a rationalization
and you know it.

197
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:01,898
I'll see you at the show.

198
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,210
OK, honey, in you go. Hey, there.

199
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,907
- How many nannies did you interview?
- Ten. Ten!

200
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,506
Each one more incompetent
than the last.

201
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:17,613
One asked me... there you go... if she
was expected to change diapers.

202
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:19,816
Good nannies are so hard to find.

203
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:22,588
I hoped to take advantage
of your expertise.

204
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:25,255
Oh, Lord.
What do you want me to do?

205
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,424
All your rich friends have nannies,
A-list nannies.

206
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,867
I need to catch one
without their bosses.

207
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:34,906
- Why?
- So I can poach me one.

208
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:36,032
Lynette!

209
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:38,576
At my old job
we didn't wait for good people.

210
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:42,671
We raided other companies.
It's no different with hiring a nanny.

211
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:47,378
Good help is hard to find, but stealing
a family's nanny is so unseemly.

212
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:52,413
If I make a better offer, why shouldn't
a qualified person reap the benefits?

213
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:58,788
So, come on, where can I score
some high-grade nanny?

214
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:06,235
Hey, Mrs. Solis.
I have some awesome news.

215
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:09,001
I have some not-so-awesome news.
You go first.

216
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:12,339
I broke it off with Danielle.
I passed her a note in class.

217
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:15,278
- So we can be together.
- [Forced laugh]

218
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:18,714
- John, your timing is impeccable.
- What do you mean?

219
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:24,854
Susan Mayer saw us last night,
and she knows everything.

220
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:44,567
Since the accident,
Bre had started to worry

221
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:48,477
her son's sense of morality
was going up in smoke.

222
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,981
She was right to be concerned.

223
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:59,054
Andrew? Can I come in?

224
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,422
Uh, yeah. Just a sec.

225
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:07,326
Hey, what's up?

226
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:11,927
- Why are you smiling?
- Um, it's just a... joke that I heard.

227
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:15,563
- Oh. What was it about?
- Well, it's kinda dirty, Mom.

228
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:19,906
Charming. I was wondering
if you've bothered to spend any time

229
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:22,708
reflecting on why
you've been grounded

230
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,375
and the pain
you've caused the Solis family.

231
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:31,252
Yeah. I totally get how my actions
have affected, like, everything else.

232
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:35,191
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

233
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:40,459
I mean, you know, like,
when I do something like I did,

234
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:43,261
then you gotta do
something like you did,

235
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:45,735
which is, you know, it's cool,

236
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:50,502
because... then everything
just kind of balances itself out

237
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:54,740
and... and goes all smooth again.

238
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,372
- You know?
- No, I don't.

239
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:03,319
What's that smell?

240
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,989
Have you been smoking marijuana?

241
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:12,359
- No, of course not.
- You are strung out!

242
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:16,993
- No! No, no, no, Mom.
- [Sighs] Excuse me.

243
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:28,871
- What's that?
- The container you'll urinate into.

244
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:31,507
- Come on.
- Ow! Ow! Ow, that hurts!

245
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,095
[Knocking]

246
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,035
Dr. Sicher,
what are you doing here?

247
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:58,270
Mr. Young, I didn't want to upset you
by telling you over the phone.

248
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:01,676
- What is it?
- Zach is missing from Silvercrest.

249
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:06,410
It happened yesterday evening,
we think during the shift change.

250
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:09,784
I know this is difficult to hear.
I'm sorry.

251
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:14,155
Yeah, well, uh, it's just been
one of those days.

252
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:19,295
I still don't get why
you're not with Danielle any more.

253
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:25,168
- She looked so slutty at Ray's party.
- She's not my type, I guess.

254
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,501
You still hung up
on your mysterious married lady?

255
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:31,975
What is it with her,
besides the obvious, of course?

256
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:36,242
We talk about real stuff. She doesn't
treat me like some lame yard boy.

257
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:39,409
But you are a lame yard boy.

258
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:43,317
It's all messed up now anyway.
Her friend found out about us.

259
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:46,983
If it gets out,
her husband's gonna kill me.

260
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:50,687
On the upside, your social status
at school is going to explode

261
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:53,060
now you're doing a hot housewife.

262
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:55,224
Shut up, dude.

263
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:01,399
Explain how he could just walk out.

264
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:04,169
With the money I pay,
you can afford a padlock.

265
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:07,679
With all due respect,
we are not a high-security facility,

266
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:10,237
and you restrict our ability
to treat Zach.

267
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,748
What?

268
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:16,480
You insist we medicate him without
psychotherapy, a recipe for disaster.

269
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:22,249
Zach is a troubled young man,

270
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:24,852
and he's getting progressively worse.

271
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:34,630
[Julie] Hungry?

272
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,201
I'm starving.

273
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:50,685
Bre had given Lynette the low-down
on Valley View Park.

274
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:55,090
It was a gathering place for upscale
nannies and their young charges.

275
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:57,955
It was Lynette's first time there,

276
00:19:58,063 --> 00:20:01,055
and she was determined
not to go home alone.

277
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,931
Of course,
Lynette had high standards,

278
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:09,071
so making a connection...

279
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,372
...wasn't easy.

280
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:17,404
Still, she was desperate
to find that special someone.

281
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:19,473
[Snoring]

282
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:23,009
And that's exactly who she found.

283
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:25,556
OK. All righty.

284
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:30,084
Here's one for you, and one for Amy.

285
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:35,256
All right, have fun, and I'll be
right here if you need me, OK?

286
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:40,237
From the moment she saw her...

287
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:42,364
- Is this seat taken?
- No, go ahead.

288
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:45,568
...Lynette knew she had to have her.

289
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:48,612
You are wonderful with those children.

290
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,477
Thanks.

291
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:54,584
- I'm Lynette.
- Claire.

292
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:57,211
Claire? I always loved that name.

293
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:01,425
So, Claire... [laughs]

294
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:03,927
Do you come here often?

295
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:27,313
- What's this?
- Your son's urine.

296
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:31,146
I'm gonna need a moment.

297
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:34,158
I think Andrew
has been smoking marijuana.

298
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:37,024
- Get it tested right away.
- Why?

299
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:40,428
I want to pull him from
the swim team. They'll want proof.

300
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:43,627
- You're not taking him off the team.
- Yes, I am.

301
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:47,229
If you try, I'm gonna go to the coach
and tell him to ignore you.

302
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:51,366
We're not gonna screw up Andrew's
future because he sparked a doobie.

303
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:55,209
- I mean, come on, we've all done it.
- Not all of us.

304
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,681
Rex, I thought you moved back
to straighten Andrew out,

305
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,742
to teach him the consequences
of his actions.

306
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:05,254
- Why are you fighting me on this?
- Because I disagree.

307
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:09,987
We're still getting divorced and I
won't let you push me around any more.

308
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:14,658
I never pushed you around.
We always made our decisions together.

309
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:18,669
No, you always make decisions
then tell me I agree.

310
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:22,935
18 years of smiling and taking it.
What a liar I was.

311
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:26,738
- Thank God you're out of my life.
- Rex...

312
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:30,775
What are you doing?

313
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:34,818
Same thing you just did
to every memory I have of our marriage.

314
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:40,750
You know what? If you were my mom,
I'd smoke pot too!

315
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:46,688
So your boss made you
return her underwear?

316
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:51,225
- After she had already worn them once.
- Couldn't you have just said no?

317
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:54,772
You don't say no to Alexis...
if you want to keep your job.

318
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:58,138
- She sounds awful.
- What can I do? I love the kids.

319
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:04,308
If we had a nanny like you,
we would treat her like gold.

320
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:11,685
Did I mention
I have four very lovable kids?

321
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:14,282
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

322
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,258
- [Woman] Claire!
- Oh, no.

323
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:18,319
- What?
- It's Alexis.

324
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:21,456
- You should go.
- Are you gonna be here tomorrow?

325
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,693
- I wanna see you again.
- No, I'm busy.

326
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:26,827
- I just want to talk.
- Lynette, this isn't right.

327
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:29,965
Claire, please.

328
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:37,909
All right. I will be at this address
until noon tomorrow. Now go.

329
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:39,473
OK.

330
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:46,616
Hi. Where are the kids?

331
00:23:56,134 --> 00:24:00,002
- What are you doing here?
- I know you know.

332
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:04,167
And you're probably freaking out,
so I just wanted to explain.

333
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:09,276
What me and Mrs. Solis have,
it's deep, you know?

334
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:13,010
We've got a future. It's not just sex.

335
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:16,849
Listen to me. There is no future
for you and Gabrielle.

336
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,651
She's not gonna divorce Carlos
and run away.

337
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:23,717
- Why not?
- Because he has money, a lot of it.

338
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:27,595
I'm not gonna be mowing lawns for ever.
I have big plans.

339
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:30,999
Just stop talking.
John, how old are you?

340
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:33,299
- Almost 18.
- Exactly.

341
00:24:33,371 --> 00:24:36,932
You are not mature enough
to have a realistic perspective.

342
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:39,875
You would be much happier
with a girl your own age.

343
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:42,606
She's the one I want.

344
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:46,378
You know, I really love her.

345
00:24:57,729 --> 00:25:00,664
[Announcer] Please welcome
Mrs. Arlene Nord.

346
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,360
We have Arlene and Norris to thank
for all our folding chairs.

347
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:08,497
So, please remember, for all
your folding chair needs... rent Nords.

348
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:10,302
[Applause]

349
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:15,038
Next up, we have Mrs. Betty Nolan!

350
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:22,075
- Thank God Tom could fill in.
- Why did Carlos back out?

351
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,985
Some work emergency.
He wouldn't talk about it.

352
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:29,186
- Sometimes I could just kill him.
- Tom's having the time of his life.

353
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:31,386
Hands off, fellas. She's all mine.

354
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:36,729
I guess he does sort of have
a dorky charm.

355
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:39,895
OK, Bree, you're up first,
followed by Lynette,

356
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:42,132
and then Edie. Edie?

357
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:45,973
- Where's Edie Britt?
- Over here.

358
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:49,709
Edie, what did you do to that dress?

359
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:52,011
Well, I made it audience friendly.

360
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:54,381
Can you tell I'm not wearing underwear?

361
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:56,578
- Yes.
- Good.

362
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:02,718
Sorry I'm late.

363
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:09,161
You should never take this dress off
for your entire life.

364
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:13,603
- Really? I look OK?
- Oh, Susan, you look so gorgeous.

365
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:17,972
- Doesn't she, Edie?
- Ah... It's a bit much.

366
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:20,773
Change the line-up.
Susan has to go last.

367
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:24,281
- Nothing is gonna top this.
- Isn't Helen going last?

368
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:26,681
She never showed up.

369
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:29,913
I think that's a great idea.
OK, let's go.

370
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:39,622
You really do look fantastic.

371
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:46,836
Next up, we have
Mrs. Bree Van De Kamp

372
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:49,702
in a pink party dress

373
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:53,107
with laser cut,
full skirt and silk belt.

374
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:56,008
Here is another exquisite
ball gown by Halston,

375
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:59,346
modeled by the devastatingly
sexy Lynette Scavo.

376
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:02,352
Notice the fine detail,
the clean lines.

377
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:06,422
The dress is nice, too.

378
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:09,517
Next up, please welcome Edie...

379
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,987
[cheering, whistling]

380
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:14,691
...Britt.

381
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:17,030
Edie Britt!

382
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:20,161
Tell Gabrielle I'm sorry
I backed out of the show.

383
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:23,434
I'm just not
in a very festive mood right now.

384
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:27,604
Helen! Helen, you're here.

385
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,080
Did they tell you about the change?
I'm gonna go last.

386
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:35,209
There's a special place in hell
for people like you.

387
00:27:35,286 --> 00:27:38,050
I'm sorry. It wasn't my decision.

388
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:42,320
You're an adult.
Take some responsibility!

389
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:45,056
What is wrong with you?

390
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,431
She is wearing a dignified classic,

391
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,459
perfect for a Sunday tea
or christening.

392
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:02,276
For God's sake, Helen,
this is for charity!

393
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:04,611
Edie Britt, everyone!

394
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,413
- Keep your hands off my son!
- What?

395
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:16,358
- Finally, to cap off our evening...
- Come on, you're up.

396
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:22,162
...please welcome
the radiant Susan Mayer.

397
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:26,599
[Gasps and murmurs]

398
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:32,667
[Lynette] Tom, say something!

399
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:35,212
A vision in white silk...

400
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,977
chiffon with gold,
hand-beaded French lace

401
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:43,214
and lavender marabou.

402
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:47,892
Susan Mayer!

403
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:52,821
She's never looked better.

404
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:01,397
Susan, I feel awful
about what happened.

405
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:05,799
Susan, talk to me.

406
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:10,408
OK, you're gonna find Helen Rowland
and tell her the truth

407
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:13,918
before everyone thinks
I'm sleeping with an underage boy.

408
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:16,111
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

409
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:21,352
- Carlos will divorce me.
- So? You obviously don't love him.

410
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:26,658
I do love him. I do.
It's just... complicated.

411
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:30,895
You know, there's gotta be
another way to fix this.

412
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:33,869
God, you are so weak.

413
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:36,031
Susan, don't be like this.

414
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:39,577
What did you expect? A hug?

415
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:52,021
- Hey...
- Shh! Alexis is still here.

416
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:55,685
She was supposed to go to Pilates
but she got her period. Go.

417
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,388
- Give me a second.
- No. She saw you at the park.

418
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:01,624
She knows what you're doing.
You're not the first...

419
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:02,723
Claire!

420
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,894
How can you stay here?

421
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:08,166
She can be tough,
but it comes with the territory.

422
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:13,040
- I would never treat you that way.
- What did you do with the aspirin?

423
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:16,978
I will give you 20 per cent more
than she's paying, plus overtime.

424
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:19,778
Dammit, Claire!
Where the hell are you?

425
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:26,423
I don't take orders from your friends
and I don't do laundry.

426
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,652
- Dishes?
- Only the kids'.

427
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:31,286
How fast can you pack?

428
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:39,368
I got a nanny!

429
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:41,363
[Sighs]

430
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:45,272
- Where are you gonna go?
- I don't know. But I can't go home.

431
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:49,710
- Are you afraid of your dad?
- No. It's not him. It's... it's me.

432
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:53,148
My life is really messed up. It's bad.

433
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:57,278
- What's bad? You can tell me.
- No, I can't!

434
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:01,219
It's better that you don't know.

435
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:11,635
I already know a little.

436
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:37,318
- Hi, Danielle. How was school?
- It was OK.

437
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:40,956
Good. Where does Andrew
keep his marijuana?

438
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:10,060
Bre had resorted to extreme measures
to save her son's soul.

439
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:15,589
As she rummaged through
Andrew's private possessions,

440
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:20,797
it occurred to her
that sometimes a little betrayal...

441
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:23,363
is good for the soul.

442
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:36,910
I was really young, like four.

443
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:39,684
I heard my mom and my dad yelling.

444
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:43,989
I heard 'em yell my name... and hers.

445
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:47,122
- Dana?
- Mm-hm.

446
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:53,865
So... I went down to the room
and I saw them cleaning it up.

447
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:56,668
Cleaning what up?

448
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:00,636
Blood.

449
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:05,040
Was it Dana's?

450
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:08,543
I think so.

451
00:33:10,054 --> 00:33:13,285
I couldn't remember this
for the longest time,

452
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:16,758
and then my mom killed herself

453
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:19,591
and I started having these dreams.

454
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:25,829
I don't even see Dana.
I just... I see the blood

455
00:33:25,903 --> 00:33:28,463
and my mom picking me up

456
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:32,168
and putting me on my bed
and whispering that it's not my fault.

457
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:38,677
And after that, every time
I'd say her name, they'd get upset.

458
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:41,752
So I wasn't even allowed
to say it any more.

459
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:46,586
I'm not sure I understand
what you're saying.

460
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:49,785
I killed my baby sister.

461

Zach, oh, my God.

462
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:57,667
And they buried her to protect me.

463
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:34,032
- Helen, do you have a minute?
- Oh, Gabrielle.

464
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:37,904
I didn't tell you how sorry I was
about what happened.

465
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:41,741
- I didn't intend to cause a scene.
- People didn't even notice.

466
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:45,579
This is a little awkward.
I know you're friends with Susan Mayer.

467
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:48,412
But let's just say I had my reasons.

468
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:51,148
It wasn't Susan.

469
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:54,317
It was me.

470
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:56,257
What?

00:34:56,327 --> 00:34:59,660
I'm the one
who was sleeping with your son.

472
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,592
I'm so sorry.

473
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:08,971
For how long?

474
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,339
Almost a year. But it's over now.

475
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:16,338
So when it started,

476
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:19,247
he was... 16?

477
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:23,585
I think.

478
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:29,059
But, Helen, you have to believe me,
it's over now.

479
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:33,028
No, you're wrong.
It's not even close to being over.

hoping for a minute of your time.

found letters in his room from Julie.

00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:02,978
- They were writing to each other.
- I need to see those letters.

497
00:37:03,087 --> 00:37:06,079
Mom... they're private.

498
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:09,923
My son is missing.

499
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:14,430
Julie, in the letters, did Zach say
anything about running away?

500
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:16,932
No.

501
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:19,299
- There's your answer.
- Susan...

502
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:22,703
If we hear anything,
I will let you know right away.

503
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:26,208
I understand how worried you must be.

504
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:31,010
- Obviously you don't.
- Paul, my daughter doesn't lie.

505
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:42,884
This was a very popular design.

506
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:47,158
I must have sold several hundred
of these just like it, ten years back.

507
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:51,964
- Do you keep any documentation?
- I have a list of customers' names.

508
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:55,665
- Somewhere. It's been a while.
- We'll need a copy of that list.

509
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:59,800
Oh, sure. Wow, this chest
looks like it's been through hell.

510
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:04,974
We pulled it out of Rockwater Lake,
you could say by way of hell.

511
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:07,847
Was there anything in the chest?

512
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:11,615
It had a body inside. Adult female.

513
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:16,826
Yeah, but how do you fit a body
into a chest that size?

514
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:20,853
It was chopped up.

515
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:52,856
Of all the stupid, boneheaded
decisions. What were you thinking?

516
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:55,865
I was set up. The coach
got an anonymous phone call.

517
00:38:55,966 --> 00:38:58,628
Andrew, what does it matter?
The pot was there.

518
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:03,435
- I was holding it for a friend.
- You know...

519
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:06,601
I can't decide
which is more humiliating,

520
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:09,839
the fact that my son got caught
with pot in his locker

521
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:14,977
or that he can't even come up
with a decent enough lie to explain it.

522
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:36,703
Gabrielle believed there was a chance

523
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:41,973
Helen Rowland would inform Carlos
of his wife's extramarital activities.

524
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:47,179
Gabrielle knew she had to come clean.

525
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:49,347
- Carlos?
- Yeah?

526
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:51,546
But coming clean...

527
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:55,686
I, uh...

528
00:39:57,027 --> 00:39:59,791
...was not one of
Gabrielle's specialties.

529
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:03,391
- I'm going to bed.
- Thanks for the newsflash.

530
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:22,350
She turned me in!

531
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:27,554
Carlos. Carlos, I'm so sorry.

532
00:40:27,658 --> 00:40:29,888
- I am so sorry.
- Sorry for what?

533
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:32,588
Whatever happens,
I love you very, very much.

534
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:36,757
- F.B.I. Open the door.
- Oh, my God.

535
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:39,064
F.B.I. If you do not open the door,

536
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:43,003
I am authorized to enter
the premises by use of force.

537
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:49,908
Carlos Solis, I have a warrant
for your arrest.

538
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:52,471
- You have the right to remain silent.
- Huh?

539
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:55,212
Anything you say
can be used against you.

540
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:59,052
- Call our lawyer.
- Carlos, what's happening?

541
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:03,820
If you cannot afford a lawyer,
one will be appointed for you.

542
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:12,801
Carlos, wait!

543
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:16,966
Gabrielle, this will all be
taken care of, I promise.

544
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:21,671
I'm innocent, I swear to God.
It was Tanaka. He set me up.

545
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:37,023
People are complicated creatures,

546
00:41:37,127 --> 00:41:40,995
on the one hand able to perform
great acts of charity,

547
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:45,459
on the other,

548
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:49,700
capable of the most
underhanded forms of betrayal.

549
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:56,410
It's a constant battle
that rages within all of us,

550
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,473
betwen the better angels
of our nature

551
00:42:00,584 --> 00:42:04,145
and the temptation
of our inner demons.

552
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:12,258
And sometimes the only way
to ward off the darkness...

553
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:19,600
...is to shine the light of compassion.

554
00:42:28,445 --> 00:42:31,437
They took him away in... handcuffs.
