00:00:01,034 --> 00:00:02,763
Previously on Desperate Housewives...

3
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:05,202
If someone hurt her,
I want them dead.

4
00:00:05,305 --> 00:00:06,329
Sometimes...

5
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:09,170
I'm out of money.
In a few weeks I'll be screwed.

6
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:11,836
- Think about looking for a job.
- Ha!

7
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:13,572
The answers...

8
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,841
Tell me what he said
and I can fix it.

9
00:00:15,915 --> 00:00:18,782
- I can't.
...to life's biggest questions...

10
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:21,013
[Mary Alice on tape]
I had the nightmare.

11
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:23,248
[Dr. Goldfine] And the name "Angela"?

12
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,916
- [Tape] My real name.
...are buried...

13
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:28,893
She's not been dead a month
and it's like she never existed.

14
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:30,520
...under bigger lies.

15
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:35,762
- Zach was telling Julie about Dana.
- He didn't mean to kill Dana.

16
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:45,502
Most mothers will tell you
their children are a gift from God.

17
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:49,604
Most mothers will also tell you
the gifts their children give them

18
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:52,583
are less than heavenly.

19
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:58,717
Lynette had suffered through art work
made in kindergarten...

20
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:03,856
...spice racks made in summer camp...

21
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:08,591
...and jewelry
made at the scout jambore.

22
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:10,430
On this day...

23
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:14,940
...Lynette Scavo received a gift
every mother dreams of.

24
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:17,974
One she wasn't embarrassed to display.

25
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:21,172
- Where did you guys get this pot?
- [Twins] We made it.

26
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:23,841
Really? I love it.

27
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:29,111
Well, this is the nicest present
you boys have ever given me.

28
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:33,454
I'll put it out on the front porch
so the whole neighborhood can enjoy it.

29
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:38,687
Lynette would cherish
the memory of that moment

30
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:42,030
for the rest of her life.

31
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:46,334
The memory of that moment
was ruined the very next day.

32
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:56,103
Mrs. McCluskey,
why are you taking my flower pot?

33
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:58,582
It's mine. Your boys stole it.

34
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:02,280
No, no, no. My sons made that
for me for Valentine's Day!

35
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:06,449
I bought this in Costa Rica
on my last cruise. You see?

36
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:08,926
It's still got the price tag on it.

37
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:14,221
What? Nothing more to say?
Cat got your tongue?

38
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:17,599
You listen to me,
keep your brats off my property.

39
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:24,075
Yes, most mothers will tell you
their children are a gift from God.

40
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:28,011
Most mothers will also tell you

41
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:31,676
there are some days
when you wish you could return them.

42
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:17,486
It was the day before Valentine's Day
and every man on Wisteria Lane

43
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:22,001
was preparing for this
most dangerous of holidays.

44
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:24,467
While some purchased
romantic cards...

45
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:31,407
...and some brought home
candy and flowers...

46
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:35,573
and some made dinner reservations
at fancy restaurants...

47
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:42,654
...others managed to forget
about the day entirely... again.

48
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:48,661
This flurry of activity was lost
on the women of Wisteria Lane.

49
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:52,754
They were busy learning
a secret about their neighbors.

50
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:57,098
A secret
that was positively heartbreaking.

51
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:00,264
So Paul said
that Zachary killed Dana?

52
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,398
Yeah.

53
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:05,433
It must have been an accident.
Boys don't just kill their sisters.

54
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:10,778
That boy is seriously disturbed and
I've forbidden Julie from seeing him.

55
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:16,447
So this is it. This is the secret
that Mary Alice was trying to protect.

56
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:18,422
The guilt she lived with.

57
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:22,120
I never thought I'd say this,
but I kind of feel sorry for Paul.

58
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:25,528
I wish I could.
I still feel like something's not right.

59
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,624
- What do you mean?
- We've all been in their house.

60
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:31,397
Have you ever seen a picture
of another kid?

61
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:34,973
Why keep Dana's baby blanket
and throw out all the photos?

62
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,906
That's a good point.

63
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,707
And why did Mary Alice refer to herself
as "Angela" in therapy?

64
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:45,216
Mary Alice loved Zach
more than anything in the world.

65
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:48,014
When you love a child that much...

66
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:52,180
You're capable of doing
all sorts of things.

67
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:57,955
Yeah.

68
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:04,969
[Knocking]

69
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:11,505
Hello? These were delivered
to my house by mistake. May I?

70
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:13,511
They're for Mary Alice Young.

71
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,839
Oh, my God.

72
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:20,511
I, uh... had a standing order
with the florist.

73
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,952
I... forgot to cancel it.

74
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:28,516
Mary Alice was my wife.
She passed away a few months ago.

75
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:34,293
I'm very sorry for your loss.

76
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:35,994
And I'm sorry for yours.

77
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:39,835
- Pardon?
- Your sister? Martha?

78
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:43,806
Oh... yes... her.

79
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,115
Good Lord, that's Angela.

80
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:52,984
What?

81
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:57,682
Angela Forrest. We worked together
in Utah. It must be 15 years ago.

82
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:01,954
I'm afraid you're mistaken.
My wife's name was Mary Alice.

83
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,155
She's... never been to Utah.

84
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:12,663
Well, I could be mistaken.
As I said, it's... been years.

85
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:22,842
No, Mickey, you're wrong.
I wasn't acting like a diva.

86
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:27,613
I left the boat show because that
coordinator was making passes at me.

87
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:30,952
I mean, it's not my fault.
Yao Lin, you missed a spot.

88
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:35,084
No, spare me the lecture
and just book me another job, quick.

89
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:39,154
Carlos and I are up to our asses
in bills and we can't pay 'em.

90
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,325
Fine. Bye.

91
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:46,666
[Speaks Chinese]

92
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:51,806
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

93
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:56,580
Are you gonna clean that spot?

94
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:59,812
- Which one?
- The one I told you to clean.

95
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:02,818
I get to it.

96
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,623
Clean it now.

97
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,760
- Why?
- Because I said so.

98
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:23,074
OK. But you got to say please.

99
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,971
[Sighs] Fine. Please.

100
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:36,853
Anything to get you back on your knees
scrubbing where you belong.

101
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:40,984
- You're not better than me.
- Excuse me?

102
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:46,521
The only reason you have anything
in your life is because you're pretty.

103
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:50,932
One day you'll be old and
when that happens, you'll be nothing.

104
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:55,768
You are so fired.

105
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:59,241
No kidding.

106
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:05,309
[Scoffs]

107
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:13,419
Ooh, Valentine's Day card. It's pretty.
And meticulously hand-painted.

108
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:16,518
Whoever sent you that
must really love you.

109
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:20,259
- And be loaded with talent.
- It's beautiful. Thanks.

110
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:24,460
We still on for tomorrow night?

111
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:27,472
I got reservations at Le Petit Fleur.

112
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:31,339
That place is so pretentious.
I've been dying to go there.

113
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:34,777
Boys? Get your little fannies inside.

114
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:37,973
Guys?

115
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:41,884
Oh, poor, Lynette.
If she doesn't get a new nanny soon,

116
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:44,787
- she's gonna implode.
- Shh.

117
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:51,090
Hey, guys.
Who you hiding from?

118
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:53,791
- Our mom.
- She wants to spank us.

119
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,528
Did you do something bad?

120
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:59,764
If you hide out too long,
she'll get worried.

121
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:03,672
Then she'll get madder.
You know what I say? Go on home.

122
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:07,837
Decent chance you'll have
the rest of day to play.

123
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:11,680
- [Boys confer quietly]
- Come on, climb aboard.

124
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:15,445
All right.

125
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:19,853
- Pretty impressive.
- Oh, I love kids.

126
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:22,019
Can't wait to have my own some day.

127
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:23,152
Oh!

128
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:38,569
- We don't want to get spanked.
- We promise we'll be good.

129
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:41,875
Too late. You stole.
And then you lied.

130
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:45,440
Even worse, you made me look bad
in front of Mrs. McCluskey,

131
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:48,180
who you know
is Mommy's sworn enemy.

132
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,882
Time to pick your poison.

133
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:54,859
How about a belt? It's a classic.

134
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:58,488
Well, we could go
with the old hickory stick.

135
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,895
It's a cliché,

136
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:01,523
but it's effective.

137
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:06,094
I know. We'll go with the spatula.
The holes give it less wind resistance.

138
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:10,074
- Moves faster.
- [All] No! No, no, no, no.

139
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:14,636
Guys! Hey, my hands are tied.
Thieves get spanked.

140
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:16,773
Just the way it works.

141
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:20,745
- Unless...
- Unless what?

142
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:25,948
For a first time offence,
if you swear,

143
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:30,426
cross your heart,
that you will never, never steal again,

144
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:34,124
and you write Mrs. McCluskey
a letter of apology,

145
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:36,098
I will let it slide.

146
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:38,102
- [All] OK!
- Yeah! We swear.

147
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:43,540
All right, start with
"Dear Mrs. McCluskey..."

148
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:48,411
Mommy? Why are you smiling?

149
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,746
Do you know what
"psychological warfare" means?

150
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,980
- No.
- Well, too bad for you.

151
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:57,578
OK, start with a big "M", "C"...

152
00:10:58,624 --> 00:10:59,682
Good.

153
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:04,188
Rex and I are hosting a dinner party
for ten next week.

154
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:07,697
We're using our best china
and serving duck.

155
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:10,600
So, you and Rex
are a couple again?

156
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:15,903
Yes. You know, that's one of things
I hated most about our separation.

157
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:18,375
Not being able
to throw dinner parties.

158
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:23,177
There's just something so civilized
and elegant about them, don't you think?

159
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:27,379
I take it you've resolved
your feelings about his infidelity?

160
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:30,945
Let's just say
I've put them in an imaginary box

161
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:34,459
and don't plan on looking
at them for a while.

162
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,189
Is that the healthiest way
to achieve a reconciliation?

163
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:40,390
Well, it won't be easy at first.

164
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:44,960
There'll be a lot of forced smiles
and perfunctory love-making,

165
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:49,201
but after a few decades whiz by,
I'm sure I'll find a way to forgive him.

166
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:51,334
Well, as long as you have a plan.

167
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:58,812
I do want to forgive him,

168
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:03,821
but... there's something
he's still not telling me.

169
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:07,450
Really?

170
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:11,926
I think it has something
to do with why he had the affair.

171
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,191
- Have you confronted him?
- Once.

172
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:16,928
You should have seen
the look in his eyes.

173
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:21,098
He was terrified I'd figure it out.

174
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:26,034
You know what it is, don't you?

175
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:28,409
Bree, I can't discuss other patients.

176
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:32,041
I realize that.

177
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:39,121
This thing that he's hiding...
Is it bad?

178
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:46,895
Oh, OK, um... uh...

179
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:49,457
Maybe it's better that I don't know.

180
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,867
Bree, how does this reconciliation
have a chance

181
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:57,341
if the two of you can't be honest
about the innermost parts of your life?

182
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:59,673
We're, um... W.A.S.P. S, Dr. Goldfine.

183
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:03,545
Not acknowledging the elephant
in the room is what we do best.

184
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:08,315
You'd settle for that? A life
filled with repression and denial?

185
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:14,615
And the dinner parties.
Don't forget the dinner parties.

186
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:24,494
And, uh, over there
you got your queens and, uh...

187
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,868
Your Quad Spring series,
and your deluxe 1000s,

188
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:33,435
all the way to the Imperial Paradise.
[Laughs] Sweet racket, huh?

189
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:38,677
Sometimes I wake up in the morning
and I can't believe I'm the Siesta King.

190
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,878
Except for how I am.

191
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,011
Very impressive.

192
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:47,354
So, where does the photographer
want me for the shoot?

193
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,985
Uh, didn't your agent tell you?
There's no shoot.

194
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:54,623
Well, then what did you hire me for?

195
00:13:56,035 --> 00:14:00,301
[Siesta King] You've heard
the expression "sex sells"? That's you.

196
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:04,069
You're to remind people
there's a lot of fun things they can do

197
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:08,603
on a Siesta King mattress
that don't involve slep. Get it?

198
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:34,771
It is often said that good fences
make good neighbors.

199
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:38,710
But as Lynette was about to discover,

200
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:42,338
the fence might just ned
a little barbed wire

201
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:44,712
if the neighbor is Mrs. McCluskey.

202
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:46,717
Hey!

203
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:53,718
What do you think you are doing?
Get out of here.

204
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:57,728
Your little criminals snuck into
my house and stole my wall clock.

205
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:58,854
What?

206
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:02,924
It was a hand-painted, purple
and white wall clock. My son made it.

207
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:04,969
You sure you didn't misplace it?

208
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:08,529
No offence, but you probably
forget where you put things.

209
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:11,599
No offence,
but you should be sterilized.

210
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:14,271
My boys do not
break into people's houses.

211
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,644
They may have stolen your flowerpot.

212
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:20,116
- They apologized for that.
- They wrote a note.

213
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:23,814
The coward's way out.
They should've apologized in person.

214
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:27,586
- This has been fun. But now...
- You let those boys run wild.

215
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:31,891
Toys all over the yard, bikes out
in the street. It's a disgrace.

216
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:33,021
Get out!

217
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:36,261
Those boys would've been
better off raised by wolves.

218
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:39,633
God knows they would have been cleaner.

219
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:46,903
Valentine's Day is tomorrow.

220
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:50,437
I know. I already bought your gifts.

221
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:53,074
Roses and English toffee?

222
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:56,643
Mm-hm. Just like always.

223
00:15:56,755 --> 00:16:00,054
Yes. And I suppose we'll make love
tomorrow night, too.

224
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,720
That is our little tradition.

225
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,697
Good. I'm looking forward to it.

226
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:17,206
Are you looking forward to it?

227
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:19,267
What?

228
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:22,404
I know that I don't...
please you sexually,

229
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:26,110
so I was wondering if you were
looking forward to being with me.

230
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:27,584
Oh, for God's sake.

231
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:32,113
I'm sorry. I thought I could pretend
that this doesn't upset me anymore.

232
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:34,749
- But I can't.
- Please, don't do this.

233
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:39,526
You went to another woman for sex
to give you something I couldn't.

234
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:42,328
At least tell me
what that something is.

235
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:45,495
- Bree, I can't.
- Why not?

236
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,605
[Sighs]

237
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:55,778
Rex, please tell me. Let me
prove to you how much I love you.

238
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:02,482
I like to be dominated.

239
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:05,781
Huh?

240
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:09,821
Sexually.

241
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:15,298
- Huh?
- Never mind.

242
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:18,199
Rex, please,
I want to understand.

243
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,137
[Man on TV] Mistress, no.

244
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:26,506
- [Woman] Quiet, slave.
- Yes, mistress.

245
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:29,274
- Turn your head. Don't look at me.
- Mistress...

246
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:32,943
On your knes, now. Right now.
Tighten your cuff.

247
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,350
- Yes, mistress.
- Do it now. Take it out.

248
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:37,548
[Man] Ow, yes, ow. Yes.

249
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:41,114
- [Whip cracks]
- Put it in your mouth.

250
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:44,855
Well?

251
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,894
- What did your mother do to you?
- What?

252
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:54,097
This just reeks
of unresolved childhood trauma.

253
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:57,607
It has nothing to do with my mother.
This is a preference.

254
00:17:57,709 --> 00:18:01,372
- It's a perversion.
- You promised to be supportive.

255
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:02,914
What do you want me to say?

256
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:06,678
My husband wears metal clamps
around his nipples, hooray?

257
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,312
I want you to try it.
Just... just once.

258
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:13,449
Try what? Hurting you?
You actually want me to hurt you?

259
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,221
So, I can feel pleasure, yes.

260
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:18,452
Fine.

261
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:23,565
So, was it good for you, too?

262
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:37,273
Mike wants babies.

263
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:40,375
- What?
- He wants to have kids.

264
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,886
He had that look men get that says,

265
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:46,652
"I'm ready to procreate,
point me to the nearest cervix".

266
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:51,822
- [Laughs] And this is a problem?
- Oh, I can't have another baby.

267
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:55,161
I'm so grateful I had you,
I don't regret a minute of that.

268
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:59,294
But I... found it
to be completely overwhelming.

269
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:01,965
Sometimes I even wonder
how I got through it.

270
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:04,634
You and me both.

271
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:07,644
So, have you told Mike how you feel?

272
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:10,682
Oh, I can't tell him.
This could be a deal-breaker.

273
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:14,047
Julie, I really love him.
I don't want to lose him.

274
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:18,886
Maybe you're overreacting.
I bet he'd rather have you than a baby.

275
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,084
What if he doesn't?

276
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:24,555
Then that's something
you need to know.

277
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:31,664
Susan shouldn't have ben so worried.

278
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:35,973
Children were the last thing
on Mike's mind.

279
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:40,273
He was too busy
searching for answers

280
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:42,437
in all the wrong places.

281
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,441
[Knocking]

282
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:40,298
Please, just...

283
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:10,762
[man] You got lucky.
Didn't hit anything major.

284
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:20,273
- Noah's getting impatient.
- Tell Noah I'm getting closer.

285
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:22,336
- That's her, isn't it?
- Yeah.

286
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:26,544
[Man] Hard to believe a kid from such
a good family could get so messed up.

287
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,984
I met somebody
who recognized her photo.

288
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:31,385
Thinks she rented a room
on Pine Avenue.

289
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:34,550
- I was checking out houses when...
- [phone]

290
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:39,029
[Susan] Hey, Mike, it's me.
Are you there? Pick up. Hello?

291
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:42,965
OK, I know you're home.
Your lights are on.

292
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:46,436
Look, I really need
to talk to you about something.

293
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:48,598
You know what?
I'll just stop by.

294
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:51,335
Oh, hey, hey.

295
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,275
I'm here. Ow!

296
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:55,403
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

297
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:57,675
Yeah, I just, uh... stubbed my toe.

298
00:21:57,783 --> 00:21:59,876
Oh. Um...

299
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:05,984
So, can I come over? I need
to talk to you about something.

300
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:11,052
I got a buddy over here right now, um...
Can it wait till dinner tomorrow?

301
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:16,328
It's... kind of important.
Um... yeah, I guess it can wait.

302
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:19,734
- OK, se you at seven?
- I'm counting the minutes.

303
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:26,606
You should take it easy
for the next few days.

304
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:32,183
I can't cancel. The last thing
I need is for her to get suspicious.

305
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:40,452
Maybe it's my dementia, but I still
haven't found my purple wall clock.

306
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:44,995
Nobody in my family knows or cares
where your stupid clock is.

307
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:49,363
And tell your little criminals
to get their bikes out of the street.

308
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:52,426
- Oh, I'll get it.
- No. Don't you dare.

309
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:55,097
We'll move it when you say please.

310
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:08,809
Please.

311
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,946
OK, Ly... Ly... Lynette...
let's not get crazy.

312
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:16,653
Even though it was Mrs. McCluskey
who had officially declared war,

313
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:20,858
it was Lynette who decided
to deliver the opening salvo.

314
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:23,059
- You'll clean that up!
- Think so?

315
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:24,726
Yes.

316
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,938
Yes, the war of Wisteria Lane

317
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:35,378
would inded prove to be messy
for everyone involved.

318
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:39,775
[Man] Pardon me? Pardon me?

319
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:43,446
We were wondering
what the coil count is on this one.

320
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:49,025
Oh. Sorry.

321
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:02,333
What is this?

322
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:07,242
People keep coming and talking to me.
Asking me questions. That is not my job.

323
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:12,272
- You don't have to be rude.
- I am not a mattress salesperson.

324
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:16,545
Is there something wrong
with being a mattress salesperson?

325
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:21,786
- Is it beneath you or something?
- Honestly? Yes. I'm a model.

326
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:25,990
Your agent warned me
that you were a diva. And he was right.

327
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:28,429
You won't talk to the customers,

328
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,401
and you didn't chip in
for Hazel's birthday cake.

329
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:36,931
- I just met the woman today.
- That didn't stop you having a piece.

330
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:41,672
I'm sorry. But I don't want someone
in my store that's not a team player.

331
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:44,271
- Oh, no. Wait.
- You're fired, princess.

332
00:24:44,382 --> 00:24:45,610
No...

333
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,851
I need to know
if my policy covers it.

334
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:54,016
No, my car wasn't involved.

335
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:59,120
It was my neighbor's car...
but the egg was mine.

336
00:24:59,197 --> 00:25:02,030
Aha. Well, can I speak
to your supervisor?

337
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,728
[Tom] Honey? Can you come out here?

338
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:11,198
What?

339
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:14,143
Look what I found
stashed in the boys' playhouse.

340
00:25:16,748 --> 00:25:18,841
[Lynette gasps]

341
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:25,381
Please tell me
that's not a purple wall clock.

342
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:31,888
Pack your bags, we're moving.

343
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:45,840
[Sighs]

344
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:15,200
Discouraged over losing herjob,

345
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:21,542
Gabrielle decided a makeover would be
the perfect cure for her depression.

346
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:25,481
It was after finding a moisturizer
she couldn't afford

347
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,644
that it finally occurred to Gabrielle...

348
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,957
...perhaps it was her pride
that neded a makeover.

349
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:37,795
[Sighs]

350
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:40,922
[Woman] Excuse me, miss?

351
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:46,902
- You forgot to give me my receipt.
- Oh. Right. Uh, oh... here.

352
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:50,100
Here we go. Thank you. Come again.

353
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,345
Mrs. Solis?

354
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,285
Oh, God...

355
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:08,917
Hello.

356
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,986
Hello, Yao Lin.

357
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:15,260
- How are you?
- Good. Very good.

358
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:19,997
I wanted to call you. I felt terrible
about how we left things.

359
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:23,700
- I need lipstick.
- OK, but...

360
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,469
Now.

361
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:31,007
You must be loving this. Huh?

362
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:33,676
Having me serve you
must be a dream come true.

363
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:36,277
Can't complain.

364
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:40,620
That's the difference between
you and me, Yao Lin, our dreams.

365
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:42,751
Close your eyes, please.

366
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,351
Thank you.

367
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:48,695
You see, I dreamed of pulling myself up
from nothing, and I did.

368
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,327
I dreamed about the things I wanted,
and I got them all:

369
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:56,898
A high powered career, a handsome
husband, an extravagant house.

370
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:02,635
This is just a blip on the radar for me.

371
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:05,649
Because now I know what I'm capable of.

372
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:09,652
And if I did it once, I can do it again.

373
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:13,656
I'm never really down, Yao Lin.
Even when it looks like I am.

374
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:18,058
So, enjoy this moment,
enjoy your dream.

375
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:23,157
'Cause for you,
it doesn't get any better than this.

376
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:27,000
There. Don't you look beautiful?

377
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:48,615
Right this way.

378
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:51,753
- Everything OK?
- This dress is just riding up.

379
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:55,630
If I walk any faster it'll be
Happy Valentine's Day for everyone.

380
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,702
Especially me.

381
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:00,862
Thank you.

382
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:06,934
Excuse me, miss?

383
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,971
[Gasps]

384
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:17,082
I'm so sorry! Is... is everyone OK?

385
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:20,955
Oh, thank you.
Thank you, so much.

386
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:30,128
- Oh, ma'am, your napkin.
- Don't even think about it.

387
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:45,008
Oh... It's so wonderful,
what you wrote. Thank you.

388
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:56,456
OK, I'm not gonna be any type of company
until I get something off of my chest.

389
00:29:56,561 --> 00:30:00,429
Do you remember when you...
said that you wanted to have kids?

390
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:02,432
Mm-hm.

391
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,559
Here's the thing.

392
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:10,304
I don't think
I'm ready to have another baby.

393
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:13,571
I think we need
to have a serious conversation.

394
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,738
Uh... sure.

395
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:24,115
- I'm not going over there.
- Yes, you are.

396
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:30,559
No. I can deal with the humiliation
of returning everything the boys stole,

397
00:30:30,628 --> 00:30:33,563
but please,
don't make me apologize to her.

398
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,724
This is being a good neighbor.

399
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:40,271
Finding ways of getting along instead
of, you know, hurling an egg at them.

400
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:45,632
Why don't we just go, "we're even",
and start from scratch?

401
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:49,077
If the "pleasant human being"
argument doesn't fly,

402
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,205
we'll try self-preservation.

403
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:55,080
She wakes up, the house is on fire.
You don't want her to call 911?

404
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:59,112
If our house catches fire, I guarantee
she's the one that started it.

405
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:02,523
OK, my point is, the day will come
when we need her help.

406
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:06,825
And I don't want her not to help us
just because of some silly feud.

407
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:12,760
- Fine. I'll do it.
- Wow. Thank you.

408
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:15,829
Whoever came up with
"Love Thy Neighbor"

409
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:18,569
lived nowhere near
Karen McCluskey.

410
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:24,047
Yes, well, on Valentine's Day,
the only motto that really matters is,

411
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:30,611
- "Love Thy Husband".
- Really? I recall no such motto.

412
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:39,260
I understand
why you would want to have kids,

413
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,888
but that chapter in my life
is just closed.

414
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:44,127
I don't think I can go back there.

415
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:46,500
And so, you know,
given the way I feel

416
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:49,404
and given the way I think you feel...

417
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:57,777
Oh, God. You're not taking this well.
Oh, I was afraid of this.

418
00:31:57,849 --> 00:31:59,942
Um...

419
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:04,080
What?

420
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:07,324
I gotta go.

421
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:08,416
What?

422
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:11,886
I'm sorry.

423
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:18,033
You're leaving without trying
to talk me into having your baby?

424
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:21,037
How do you know I wouldn't cave?
I always cave. I...

425
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:23,164
[gasps]

426
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:24,299
Mike?

427
00:32:38,489 --> 00:32:41,253
- Good night.
- Night.

428
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:55,031
So, how does this...
domination thing work?

429
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:04,144
So there's nothing to be afraid of.

430
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:07,981
We'll be constructing simple scenarios
and acting them out.

431
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:11,852
So, it's like we're in a little play.

432
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:13,356
Sort of.

433
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:16,484
If things get too rough,
we'll have a control word.

434
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:18,927
If one of us says it,
the other backs off.

435
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:22,261
OK. So what's our control word?

436
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:25,803
Well, lately
I've been using "Philadelphia".

437
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,803
What's wrong?

438
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:34,811
Aunt Fern lives in Philadelphia.
I don't want to think about her

439
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:37,676
while I'm spanking you
with a leather strap.

440
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:41,776
OK. Fine. You pick a control word.

441
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:45,083
Um... how about "Boise"?

442
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:49,852
- "Boise"?
- What's the matter with "Boise"?

443
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:54,223
We're gonna be
doing psychological role-playing,

444
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:57,199
and a funny word like "Boise"
will ruin the mood.

445
00:33:57,268 --> 00:34:00,396
We need something that sounds serious.

446
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:05,340
Hm. How about "Palestine"?

447
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:09,803
"Boise" will be just fine.

448
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:13,944
So, I guess we should,
uh... get started.

449
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:19,154
What do you want me to do?

450
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:22,486
Handcuff me to the bed.

451
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:25,994
Bree, you are not gonna regret
taking this journey with me.

452
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:30,797
This is gonna infuse our marriage
with more passion than you can imagine.

453
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:34,796
You just have to trust me.

454
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:35,896
I do.

455
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:43,442
Would you mind if I ran these
through the dishwasher once?

456
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:45,910
Sure.

457
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:50,646
You can see him
as soon as the doctor's finished.

458
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:52,814
Oh, OK. Thanks.

459
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:57,591
Can you believe that story?

460
00:34:57,662 --> 00:35:00,460
No way that gunshot wound
was self-inflicted.

461
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:03,056
And he can't remember
who stitched him up.

462
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:07,570
Well, the police are on their way
to talk to him. Let them sort it out.

463
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:31,088
Sorry about ruining dinner.

464
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:33,254
Oh, please, I'm just glad you're OK.

465
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:41,829
So, you shot yourself?

466
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:46,709
[Sighs] Pretty lame, huh?

467
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:53,609
Yeah, I was cleaning my automatic
and was too embarrassed to tell you.

468
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:58,421
Well, I could see why you would be.

469
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,582
I know it sounds crazy, I just...

470
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:03,525
I couldn't let myself ruin
your Valentine's Day.

471
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:08,559
But I heard what you said
at the restaurant.

472
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:12,069
- About not wanting kids.
- We don't have to talk about that.

473
00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:14,229
No, Susan.

474
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:19,639
I just want to be with you
above everything else.

475
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,803
If that means not being a dad...

476
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:27,579
I may be stupid enough
to shoot myself,

477
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:32,049
but I'm not stupid enough
to walk away from you.

478
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:36,618
You know that, right?

479
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:39,389
Yeah.

480
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:48,363
I'm gonna go outside
and let you rest for a while.

481
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:57,710
Thanks...
for being so understanding.

482
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:11,520
[Policeman] Ma'am.

483
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:17,927
Mr. Delfino? I'm Officer Russell,
this is Officer Walters.

484
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:20,300
Uh, we'd like to
ask you a few questions.

485
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:44,387
What do you want?

486
00:37:44,462 --> 00:37:47,625
The boys have something
they'd like to say to you.

487
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:58,064
I have some tea heating on the stove.
Perhaps you'd better come inside, boys.

488
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:06,812
What about you, Lynette?
Do you have anything to say?

489
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:11,719
No. I'll just wait out here.

490
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:13,848
Suit yourself.

491
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,163
You boys want some peanut brittle?

492
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:27,864
Go ahead.

493
00:38:27,938 --> 00:38:31,066
Don't get any crumbs on my floor.
Move over.

494
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:38,270
OK, go ahead.
Make with the apology.

495
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:42,116
We're sorry.

496
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:47,784
That's it, huh?
Didn't you know stealing is wrong?

497
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:51,322
- How old are you anyway?
- We're six.

498
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:53,920
- And how old are you?
- Five.

499
00:38:54,965 --> 00:38:57,866
Boy, your mother
just pops them out, doesn't she?

500
00:38:57,968 --> 00:39:00,562
How old are you?

501
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:03,937
- How old do you think?
- 150.

502
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:08,176
Hurry up and eat your peanut brittle.

503
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:15,310
Who's that?

504
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:20,481
That's my little boy.

505
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:22,856
Where does he live?

506
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:27,392
- He died when he was 12.
- How come?

507
00:39:28,265 --> 00:39:32,998
He got sick.
He was a little terror like you three.

508
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:37,999
You would've liked him.

509
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:42,911
Now, you done with the peanut brittle?

510
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,777
Let's go.

511
00:39:48,252 --> 00:39:51,346
Now, I wanna say something
to you before you go.

512
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:53,913
What you did was wrong,

513
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:58,961
but it's nice you got a present
for your Mom for Valentine's Day.

514
00:40:00,598 --> 00:40:03,328
Nobody's ever gonna love you
like your mother.

515
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:07,028
All right, let's go.

516
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:11,534
Get the hell out of my house.

517
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:16,670
In her heart, Lynette knew she would
probably never love her neighbor,

518
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:23,050
never realizing love was the one thing
she and her neighbor had in common.

519
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:38,064
- Hi.
- Hey, Lynette.

520
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:44,007
- Um...
- What's wrong?

521
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:49,068
My kids have been on a thieving jag.
Stealing stuff from the neighborhood.

522
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:50,477
I'm so sorry.

523
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:54,109
I know. They're being punished.
Probably for life.

524
00:40:54,218 --> 00:40:57,710
But... I needed you to see something.

525
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:02,851
They stole it from Mike's garage.
From inside his workbench.

526
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:04,224
Your Mike.

527
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,736
- So?
- Read the engraving.

528
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:19,638
[Susan gasps]

529
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:25,003
- Is that blood?
- I don't know.

530
00:41:25,115 --> 00:41:28,482
What... what does this mean?

531
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,846
I don't know.

532
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:45,759
It's impossible to grasp
just how powerful love is.

533
00:41:46,737 --> 00:41:49,797
It can sustain us
through trying times...

534
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:58,513
...or motivate us
to make extraordinary sacrifices.

535
00:42:01,151 --> 00:42:06,316
It can force decent men
to commit the darkest deds.

536
00:42:07,658 --> 00:42:14,063
Or compel ordinary women
to search for hidden truths.

537
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:18,657
And long after we're gone,

538
00:42:18,736 --> 00:42:22,604
love remains,
burned into our memories.

539
00:42:25,943 --> 00:42:28,844
We all search for love.

540
00:42:28,913 --> 00:42:30,642
But some of us,

541
00:42:30,781 --> 00:42:34,376
after we've found it,

542
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:36,544
wish we hadn't.
