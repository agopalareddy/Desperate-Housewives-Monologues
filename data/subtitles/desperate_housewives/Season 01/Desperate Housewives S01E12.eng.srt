Previously on Desperate Housewives...

3
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:06,803
- These are nice people.
- My money says one of 'em isn't.

4
00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:10,274
- How creepy is Mrs. Huber's sister?
- Promises were made.

5
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:13,346
I'm going to find out
exactly what happened to her.

6
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:16,280
- Marriages came undone.
- We are starting a family.

7
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,180
We're not negotiating my uterus.

8
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:21,379
- Would you go out to dinner with me?
- Like a date?

9
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:23,422
- A date?
- And the truth...

10
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,924
- You burned her house down.
...was denied.

11
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:29,325
I absolutely did not
do that thing you accused me of.

12
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:36,492
Martha Huber waited her whole life
for something to happen to her,

13
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:39,197
something exciting.

14
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:44,470
As a child she hoped to be
kidnapped by a band of pirates.

15
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:50,482
As a tenager she dreamt of being
discovered by a Hollywood talent scout.

16
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,711
As a young woman she fantasized

17
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:57,621
a handsome millionaire
would swep her off her fet.

18
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,717
But the years had flown by
and still nothing exciting

19
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:04,059
had ever happened to Martha Huber.

20
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,328
Until the night she was murdered.

21
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:13,895
Hello, Mrs. Huber.
Let me give you a hand.

22
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:16,464
- That's really not necessary.
- I insist.

23
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:21,947
In those last moments it occurred
to her, in addition to being boring,

24
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:25,576
life could also be very cruel.

25
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:31,390
Luckily for Mrs. Huber,
death was far more merciful.

26
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:37,454
What do you think?

27
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:41,123
That's our missing woman all right.

28
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:45,933
Oh, jeez. Didn't take the media long
to get wind of this.

29
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:49,166
Make sure no one contaminates
my crime scene.

30
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:02,854
Hey, little lady. A lot of people
are looking for you. You know that?

31
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:07,052
Your face is gonna be on the front page
of every paper in this state.

32
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,220
How's that for exciting?

33
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:13,629
Officer Jackson couldn't be sure,
but for a brief moment,

34
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:18,965
he thought he saw the corpse
of Martha Huber smile.

35
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:11,190
Death had come once again
to Wisteria Lane.

36
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:14,420
I'm afraid I have
some bad news for you.

37
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,995
We found your sister's body.

38
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:25,732
Word of the tragedy would soon spread
throughout the neighborhood.

39
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:30,538
But for now people went about
their lives as they always did,

40
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,703
blissfully unaware.

41
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,070

42
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:38,378
- Hello? Anybody home?
- [Mike] In the kitchen.

43
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:40,543
Good news. I finished my book.

44
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,817
So I thought to celebrate
you could take me out to lunch.

45
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:46,016
- Susan.
- Can we do a rain check?

46
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:48,560
We're looking at the plans
for her house.

47
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:51,188
My insurance company's
cutting my check.

48
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:53,390
There's only one plumber I want.

49
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:58,267
Don't expect to see this guy for a few
months. I'm gonna be riding him hard.

50
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:03,241
Well, if anybody can go the distance,
he can. I should know.

51
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:06,002
See ya.

52
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:14,411
Mike.

53
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:17,347
Mike, we're on the clock.

00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:36,064
Edie?

57
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,905
They found Martha.

58
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:43,312
Here, blow. Good.
All right, come on.

59
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:45,874
This is gonna be fun. Follow me.

60
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:59,159
Excuse me? You can't do that.

61
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:02,393
I'm here for the 10.00am
yoga meditation class.

62
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:05,596
Unfortunately,
the daycare center's full.

63
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:09,164
Yeah, I noticed that,
but every time I come here it's full.

64
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:12,336
It's a popular class,
and the other moms come early.

65
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:16,381
Look, all I can tell you
is plan ahead next time.

66
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:22,149
Lauren, I'm a mother of four.
Today I had to get up at five,

67
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:25,588
make lunches, make breakfast,
drop the twins at school

68
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:28,855
and get across town
lugging a baby and a sick child.

69
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:32,420
Telling me to plan ahead
is like telling me to sprout wings.

70
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:36,594
And things like being told
to plan ahead make me so crazy

71
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,899
that yoga is the only thing
to relax me.

72
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:44,910
Except I show up here and I can't
get in, and you tell me to plan ahead.

73
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,503
It's a vicious cycle.
See how that works?

74
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:53,018
If I broke the rules for you, I'd have
to break 'em for the other moms.

75
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,987
The moms who followed the rules
would get pissed.

76
00:05:56,055 --> 00:06:00,549
I'd have to get pissy right back and
I don't have time to read my magazine.

77
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:03,060
See how that works?

78
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,896
I hope some day
you have lots of children.

What?

82
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:32,451
- I had a wonderful time today.
- Thank you. I did too.

- I'm sorry I can't invite you in.
- I get it.

Rex still lives in the house.
It would be awkward.

85
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:47,895
And I would rather cut off my hand
than hurt his feelings.

86
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:55,375
It'll be a lot easier
once he gets well enough to move out.

87
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:58,245
So do you want to have lunch tomorrow?

88
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:03,952
I'd love to.

Come on, honey. Let's celebrate.

101
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:58,037
Sorry it's the cheap stuff.
I had to economize.

102
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:01,045
Now you're back
we can restock the wine cellar.

103
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:05,147
- Let's toast.
- It's very good to be back.

104
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:07,277
What's that?

105
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:13,986
It transmits to this,
my electronic monitoring device.

106
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,756
- Didn't the lawyer tell you?
- Tell me what?

107
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:19,694
I'm on house arrest.
It's a condition of my bail.

108
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:23,394
- No, he neglected to tell me that.
- Yeah.

109
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:27,428
If I move more than 100 feet
from that telephone, an alarm sounds.

110
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:31,500
If I keep going, it transmits a signal
to the F.B.I. And I'm back in jail.

111
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:35,377
- But how are you gonna work?
- I can't. I can't do anything.

112
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:41,179
No, no, that's unreasonable.
What do they expect us to do for money?

113
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:45,553
The lawyer's working on unfreezing
the accounts, and in the meantime,

114
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:47,717
haven't you been modeling?

115
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:50,159
Carlos, this is not like New York

116
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:54,289
where I made thousands of dollars a day
modeling haute couture.

117
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:58,531
I'm doing boat shows.
I spend eight hours a day doing this.

118
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:02,540
Well, I'd buy two boats from you.

please... call me immediately.

128
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:42,608
I believe she did keep a diary
or something. I'll look around for it.

Look at them all. Vultures.

they want are the sordid details.

I don't know. I think
they just wanna show their support.

Please. Human beings feed on misery.

00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:06,331
Well, we might as well
give the people what they want.

Hello. I want to thank you all
for coming out here

your genuine sorrow and disbelief.

My sister Martha would've been touched.
I know many of you have questions.

137

The police are still putting together
the details of what happened.

138
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:30,591
What they do know is...
Martha died a violent death.

139
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:36,198
Yes, I know, it's hard to hear.

140
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:39,431
Apparently there was a struggle.

141
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:43,599
They found scratching and bruising
on her body, several broken bones

142
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:46,167
and traces of dirt in her lungs,

143
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,616
which leads us to believe she was
still alive at the time of her burial

144
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:54,311
and probably in great pain.

145
00:10:55,921 --> 00:11:01,689
But the good news is there are no signs
that she had been molested.

146
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:07,431
Now, I think it's time
that you return to your homes,

147
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,593
to your loved ones.

I'll be holding an estate sale
day after tomorrow.

00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:20,778
Please, no personal checks.

151
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:33,722
By the next morning,
everyone on Wisteria Lane

152
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:39,629
was aware of Martha Huber's demise,
with no exceptions.

153
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,099
OK, boys. You see this gum?

154
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:46,764

I am playing cards, it's all yours.

- Deal?
- [All] Yeah!

156
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,573
That's what I like to hear.

157
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:56,308
What are the odds? First Mary Alice
and then Mrs. Huber? It's shocking.

158
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,943
This is different.
Someone was murdered on our street.

159
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:02,886
I talked to her
right before she disappeared.

160
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:07,324
- What did you talk about?
- She yelled about my garbage cans.

161
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,520
- I'm gonna miss her.
- [Doorbell]

- Oh. You're all here.

00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:32,843
OK, then.

167
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,011
Well, here's the deal.

168
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:39,046
Since the ice queen isn't doing
anything to memorialize her sister,

169
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:41,888
I have decided to carry Martha's ashes

170
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:45,624
up to Torch Lake
and scatter them myself.

171
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:49,327
- It's where her husband proposed.
- That's so sweet.

172
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:56,600
I know. So I thought that some of the
neighbors could caravan up there

173
00:12:56,675 --> 00:13:00,008
and we'd have a little ceremony.

174
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:04,811
I've printed out maps if anyone needs
one, and the dress is semi-formal.

175
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:10,253
I'd love to go, but I just got back
into modeling, just for fun.

176
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:13,086
I have a gig tomorrow.
I can't leave 'em hanging.

177
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:18,791
- I would have arranged a sitter.
- I have to take Rex to his angiogram.

178
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:21,025
Hmm.

179
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:28,273
Well, Mayer, what's your excuse?

180
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:34,203
I'm just, you know, busy. Stuff.

181
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:37,942
Well, your friends
are much better liars.

182
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:45,651
[Door slams shut]

183
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:48,989
OK. Mommy's friends are gone now
and you can...

184
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,398
Ow! Ow!

185
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:58,527
Well, yeah, I know it hurts.

186
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:03,006
That's what you get when you let your
brothers put bubble gum in your hair:

187
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:04,973
Pain and misery.

188
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:08,741
- Are you mad at me?
- Yes! Yes, I am mad at you.

189
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:10,748
Ow!

190
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,718
And I'm also cranky, like you get
when you haven't taken a nap.

191
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,846
Mommies are the same way.
We need our downtime.

192
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:20,687
If we don't get it... Sorry.

193
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:24,889
...we end up saying and doing things
which we don't normally do.

194
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:29,094
And that's frustrating 'cause I do
want to be the best mommy I can be.

195
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:32,296
I think you're the best mommy
in the world.

196
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:37,804
Well, that's sweet of you,
but it's not exactly true.

197
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:47,408
I was so afraid when I suggested
a picnic that you'd make fun of me,

198
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,286
but it's such a lovely, old-fashioned
way to spend an afternoon.

199
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:55,690
Well, as it happens,
I'm an old-fashioned kind of guy.

200
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:59,527
And we got so lucky with the weather.
It's just absolutely...

201
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:06,936
Your lunch hour's almost up. We should
get you back to the pharmacy.

202
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:10,497
Wait. I've had such a good time
these last few days.

203
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:14,739
- I just wanna show my appreciation.
- I hope it's not another orchid.

204
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:18,874
- They're so expensive.
- Relax. This didn't cost me a dime.

205
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:21,044
OK.

206
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:30,257
George, you shouldn't have.

207
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:39,064
This is a nine-millimeter Luger PO8.

208
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:42,538
When you said you were in the N.R.A.,
I wanted to give it to you.

209
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,202
I can't accept this. It's too valuable.

210
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:48,474
It's OK. My grandpa left it to me.

211
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:52,277
It was surrendered to him
by a soldier during World War II.

212
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:56,753
- Since I don't know how to shoot...
- It's so lovely. Look at that handle.

213
00:15:56,822 --> 00:16:00,189
- Mother-of-pearl?
- Only the officers' models had that.

214
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:04,195
- Do you really like it?
- Absolutely.

215
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:09,428
George, this is just
so much better than an orchid.

216
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:24,271
Hi. I'm Susan Mayer.
I thought you might need a hand.

217
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,284
No, thanks.

218
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:30,549
I'm sorry for what happened.

219
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:35,491
It must be really hard
not knowing who did it or why.

220
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:38,654
- You must feel helpless.
- A bit.

221
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:42,598
I'm hoping her journals
will provide some insight.

222
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,728
- Journals?
- Yes. Martha kept them for years.

223
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:51,140
Oh. So she must have written
a lot of things in them?

224
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:55,909
Every mundane detail of her life.

225
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:59,178
And everyone else's, for that matter.

226
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:01,844
The police want to see them,

227
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:07,153
but I'm stalling them till I have
a chance to read through them myself.

228
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:11,559
Wouldn't want any embarrassing
family secrets getting out.

229
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:15,861
That's smart. That's good.
That's good to hear.

230
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:24,665
- I am so screwed.
- Mom, calm down.

231
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:28,941
Everything about the fire and measuring
cup is gonna be in that journal.

232
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:31,073
Everyone'll think I'm an arsonist.

233
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:33,549
It may not be as bad as it looks.

234
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:36,281
There's a chance
she didn't write about it?

235
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:39,586
Please. It's great dirt.
I even put it in my journal.

236
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:44,485
You're gonna have to convince Mrs. Britt
it was an accident.

237
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,691
If she doesn't press charges,
the police'll let it go.

238
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,291
Are you high? Edie hates me.

239
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:54,703
That's why you're going to grovel
at her feet and beg forgiveness.

240
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:58,368
That's right. You're gonna have to
suck up to Edie Britt.

241
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:29,767
Hey, Mike. As you can probably se
by now, I took back my money

242
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:34,176
and what little information you managed
to dig up on your neighbors.

243
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:38,842
Your replacement's gonna ned it.
Pack up and move on with your life.

244
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:41,179
Sorry for the mess.

245
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:51,319
We're here! Ten minutes early.

246
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:54,024
- Sign me up.
- You just missed the rush. Sorry.

247
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:59,332
No. No, I planned ahead.
We're ten minutes early.

248
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,364
- Oh, my God.
- What?

249
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,409
When you said you had
a sick child, I had no idea.

250
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,968
How long's it been?

251
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:13,380
Just kinda snuck up on us.

252
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:17,582
And he's so young, too.
God, it just breaks my heart.

253
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,523
Oh!

254
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:24,392
- No, see, here's the thing...
- You go ahead into class.

255
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,431
I'll find room for your kids.

256
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,295
OK.

257
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:32,133
Hey, Edie.

258
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:36,065
Susan.

259
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:41,776
I gotta say, I envy you.

260
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,941
In the name of God, why?

261
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:49,214
Well, you get to build
your dream house, for free.

262
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:53,748
In a weird way your house burning down
was really a good thing.

263
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:56,156
There is nothing good about it.

264
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:59,958
I can't replace the memories,
the photographs, the...

265
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,762
Is there something you want?

266
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:07,167
OK, here's the deal, Edie.

267
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:09,137
I...

268
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:12,868
- I...
- I, I... What?!

269
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:16,209
Spit it out already. I'm busy.

270
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:19,375
I just wanted to see
how you were holding up.

271
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:22,009
You know, with Mrs. Huber
and everything.

272
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:26,285
My best friend was murdered
and stuffed into a garbage bag,

273
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:28,484
and nobody cares enough to...

274
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:33,191
...go with me to spread her ashes.

275
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,199
I'll go with you, Edie.

276
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:48,611
Hey.

277
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,012
Thank God. I'm starving.

278
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:54,313
Well, dig in.
I am way too tired to eat.

279
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:56,445
Hey. I'm sorry.

280
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:08,163
Hmm?

281
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:11,999
So did you get to go by the hospital,
visit Mama?

282
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,937
I worked ten hours today.

283
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,009
I'll go tomorrow.
She doesn't know when I'm there.

284
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:20,772
She's gonna wake up soon. I know it.

285
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,378
And you know what'd make her happy?

286
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:26,917
If you say a grandchild, so help me.

287
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:29,988
- Gabrielle, please.
- You promised. No babies.

288
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:32,751
- Things change.
- Yeah, I know.

289
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:36,692
The Feds towed away my Maserati,
my husband is a felon,

290
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:41,529
and I spend my days getting groped
by fat tractor salesmen at trade shows.

291
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,503
- I am well aware things change!
- A baby is solid, a constant.

292
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:52,009
Who's gonna change diapers when you're
pumping iron in a federal prison? Huh?

293
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:55,240
I like my lifestyle
and I don't want you to kill it.

294
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:58,043
Well, look around. It's already dead.

295
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:00,277
Now there's nothing you can control.

296
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:06,017
Maybe. But having a baby?
That I can control. You, I can control.

297
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:09,322
You can't talk to me like that.
I'm the man of this house.

298
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:12,795
Oh, really? The man of the house?

299
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,665
Don't walk away from me.

300
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:21,603
Hey, hey. My food.
Gabrielle, come back here right now!

301
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,766
Hey. Hey!

302
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:28,312
I wouldn't go too much farther.
You're gonna end up back in prison.

303
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,781
Dammit, Gabrielle. Get inside now.

304
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:39,622
- Mmm.
- Hey, I waited all day for that!

305
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:42,216
It's perfect. Oh!

306
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:50,601
Crispy and burnt on the outside,
but nice and steamy on the inside.

307
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:55,734
- [Bleeping]
- [Gabrielle] Ah, ah, ah!

308
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:57,502
Mm-mm.

309
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,568
Mmm.

310
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:02,909
You're the man of the house?
You can't even leave it.

311
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:06,513
Mmm. Oh!

312
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:08,678
Oh!

313
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:10,621
Aaagh!

314
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:21,330
I love this. It's like an adventure.
I've never fired a gun before.

315
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:24,800
The memory of this night
will stay with you for ever.

316
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,700
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

317
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:32,505
You always remember your first time.
I hope I brought enough bullets.

318
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:37,981
You know, Bree, I can't tell you what
these last few days have meant to me.

319
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:41,280
Finally getting out of the house
and trying new things.

320
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:44,550
- Well, we sure have had some fun.
- It's more than that.

321
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:47,885
I forget what it's like to be Ionely.

322
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:51,759
Oh, George, that's so sweet.

323
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,822
Now, come on.
Let's go shoot something.

324
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:59,563
Before I fire a handgun, I go over
the basics to make sure I'm ready.

325
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:03,972
OK? So, number one. Strong stance.

326
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:06,875
Two. High hand grasp.

327
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,243
Three. Hard grip.

328
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:11,544
Four. Front sight.

329
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:14,141
Five. Release the safety,

330
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:17,551
and then squeeze the trigger slowly.

331
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:22,423
- What's a high hand grasp?
- Here, take the gun.

332
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:24,620
When you're firing a semiautomatic,

333
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:29,393
you want the web of your hand
up against the edge of the backstrap.

334
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:33,097
- What perfume are you wearing?
- I'm not wearing perfume.

335
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:35,765
Are you sure?
Because you smell amazing.

336
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:39,207
Oh! I was making macaroons
before I left the house.

337
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:44,112
Now, I want you to hold the gun like
you're holding a beautiful white dove,

338
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:48,482
firmly enough that it can't fly away,
but not so firmly that you can kill it.

339
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,748
- Got it?
- I think so.

340
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:57,022
Now all you have to do is take a
deep breath and squeeze the trigger...

341
00:24:57,095 --> 00:24:59,154
- George!
- [Gunshot]

342
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:02,257
- Ow! Ow!
- My God! Oh, George!

343
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,427
Sorry!

344
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:13,369
Hey.

345
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:19,441
George.

346
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:23,250
I'm so sorry you lost your toe.

347
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:27,724
The doctor said it's the middle one,
so your balance shouldn't be affected.

348
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:30,920
This really won't change your life
one little bit.

349
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:36,662
Please say something.

350
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:41,172
I've always dreamed that before I died

351
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:45,607
I would get to kiss
a truly beautiful woman.

352
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:50,443
I finally get the chance
and I end up blowing off a toe.

353
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:57,446
I'm not surprised. This type of thing
always happens to me.

354
00:25:57,522 --> 00:25:59,820
I know I'll get over it.

355
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:04,889
But the thing that I don't think
I'll ever get over

356
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:09,330
is that when I did kiss you,
you pulled away from me.

357
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:17,899
- Why did you do that, Bree?
- I was just caught off-guard.

358
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:22,844
But we're dating. Why would it be
so surprising I would try to kiss you?

359
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:27,749
I'm still married to Rex.
We're not even legally separated yet.

360
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:31,344
He cheated on you. You said
you were gonna hate him for ever.

361
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:37,193
You shouldn't listen to a woman
who's just had her heart broken.

362
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:40,162
We tend to lie.

363
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:49,938
I think we're a little late. Hi. Sorry.

364
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:57,737
Lynette knew serious illness
was not a matter to be treated lightly.

365
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:01,785
- What are you doing?
- Picking up my sick little baby boy.

366
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:04,184
All right, here. There. OK.

367
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:07,952
But making her yoga class
was a matter of life and death.

368
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:11,621
Sorry, sorry.
Excuse me, excuse me.

369
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:14,790
Hey, Lauren. Hi.
We had a really rough morning.

370
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:17,629
Don't give it another thought.

371
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,131
I bet you were a cheerleader
in high school.

372
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:26,700
My junior year. How'd you know?

373
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:29,336
Girls like you
were always cheerleaders.

374
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:32,508
Clear skin, honor roll, popular.

375
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:35,678
In high school I was the girl
that hung with the freaks

376
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:38,279
on the loading dock and smoked.

377
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:41,791
- Everyone hated us.
- Well, you know high school.

378
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:46,353
- Thank God we leave that behind.
- See, I don't think we do.

379
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:50,390
I'm still the outsider that doesn't
get invited to the cool parties,

380
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:52,936
and you're still the perky cheerleader

381
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:56,439
who thinks that she can pull the wool
over everyone's eyes.

382
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:57,668
What?

383
00:27:57,742 --> 00:28:00,006
You came on this trip,
paid for the gas,

384
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:03,536
and you're changing this flat
when you know I have Auto Club.

385
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:06,914
You want something from me.

386
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:10,887
I just know Mrs. Huber's death's
been hard on you. I want to help.

387
00:28:10,955 --> 00:28:15,051
- That's a lie.
- Why would you think I was lying?

388
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:19,062
Because we're still in high school.
The old rules apply.

389
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:22,759
The cool kids only talk to the freaks
when they need something.

390
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:27,099
You're not getting back in my car until
you tell me what it is that you want.

391
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:33,334
OK.

392
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:35,242
Look, I...

393
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:41,209
I just haven't always treated you well
and I wanna make amends.

394
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:48,753
Hmm. I still think you're full of crap,
but we don't have time to debate this.

395
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:57,334
I would have talked to you
in high school.

396
00:28:57,435 --> 00:29:00,529
Of all the lies you've told,

397
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:03,607
that's the worst.

398
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,025
Single malt?

399
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:29,892
- Have a seat. Take a load off.
- I want it all back.

400
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:32,094
My maps, pictures, my gun.

401
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:34,900
- And the money.
- Oh, my money, you mean?

402
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:38,965
You'll never get somebody who cares
about finding Deidre like I do.

403
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:44,481
Why? Because you loved her so much?
You abandoned her, remember?

404
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:48,952
You saved yourself, found a nice, safe
wife and you left my daughter to rot.

405
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:53,251
So forgive me if I question
your level of commitment.

406
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:58,959
I need to do this.
Why are you fighting me?

407
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:02,796
You haven't been moving fast enough,
and I'm running out of time.

408
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:06,301
- What do you mean?
- It seems I have a tumor.

409
00:30:08,273 --> 00:30:10,867
Apparently it's pressing on my brain.

410
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:16,338
I'm gonna die,

411
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:20,578
and I'd like to know what happened
to my daughter before I do.

412
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:29,993
That was the best class ever.

413
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:34,498
- I just feel terrific. Thank you.
- Lynette, this is my friend Callie.

414
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:35,656
- Hi.
- Hi.

415
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:38,702
- She wanted to meet Parker.
- Oh, really? Why?

416
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:43,499
I'm a survivor. Breast cancer.
About six years ago.

417
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:46,736
Can I hug your son?

418
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:50,239
Sure.

419
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:56,313
I know exactly
what you're going through.

420
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:58,946
But you're gonna be brave, OK?

421
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:03,153
And you are gonna survive this
because you are a tough little soldier.

422
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:13,069
Mommy, am I dying?

423
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:29,616
No. You're not dying. People just
think that because I shaved your head.

424
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:34,124
- You shaved his head?
- My brothers put gum in my hair.

425
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:40,290
Sorry. Excuse me.

426
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:45,268
And just like that, Lynette realized
the road to enlightenment

427
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:49,534
and spiritual well-being
was now closed to her.

428
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:56,071
Oh, George!

429
00:31:57,515 --> 00:31:59,415
Well, what a surprise.

430
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:05,423
See, I've been doing a lot of thinking
since we talked at the hospital, and...

431
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:09,924
- And?
- Bree, I don't care what we call it.

432
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:12,861
We can call it dating.
We can call it hanging out.

433
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:19,802
I just want to be with you.
See, I really need our friendship back.

434
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:24,432
- I don't think that would be wise.
- Why not?

435
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:30,343
Wouldn't you keep hoping that in time
I would feel the same way about you?

436
00:32:32,183 --> 00:32:34,276
Maybe.

437
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:35,977
Oh, George.

438
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:39,079
I wish you wouldn't say
"Oh, George" like that,

439
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:42,283
like I'm pathetic for even thinking
you could love me.

440
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:48,525
I don't think you're pathetic.
It's just that... I can't.

441
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:54,563
Aw, jeez. Aw, jeez.

442
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:58,540
Oh, George, please don't go.
Why can't we talk this over?

443
00:32:58,609 --> 00:33:00,702
Don't!

444
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:04,475
- Oh, my God! Oh, George, here...
- Get away from me!

445
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:07,780
- Lean on me.
- I don't need you!

446
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:10,480
I don't need anybody!

447
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:18,756
You know, honey, tonight's
the last night of the boat show.

448
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:22,993
We can spend some time together
before the home and garden thing.

449
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:25,733
Carlos?

450
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:29,796
I'm going to jail, and you're not gonna
be here when I get back.

451
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:33,433
- What?
- It's true, and I won't blame you.

452
00:33:33,544 --> 00:33:36,775
Don't talk like that.
Everything's gonna be fine.

453
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:40,681
We're gonna sort this mess out
and you're gonna be back on top.

454
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:45,246
They could find me guilty.
I could go to prison for five years.

455
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:48,553
We'd have to sell the house.
You'd have to keep working.

456
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:52,891
If that happens,
can you promise you won't ever leave?

457
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:58,625
I promise.

458
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:01,136
I gotta go.

459
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:11,005
This is far enough.

460
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:17,378
[Sighs]

461
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:20,449
[Sighs]

462
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:26,553
Do you need help with the container?

463
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:29,495
No, I got it open. I'm good.

464
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:38,174
So what are you waiting for?

465
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,540
I just need a moment, OK?

466
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:44,069
Of course. Take your time.

467
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:48,715
[Edie sobs]

468
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:56,425
Are you OK?

469
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:58,962
No, I'm just so grateful.

470
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:04,691
I know. I know.
Mrs. Huber was a good friend to you.

471
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:07,771
I'm not talking about Martha.

472
00:35:09,073 --> 00:35:12,770
- I'm grateful to you.
- Me?

473
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:17,747
Yeah, I've been such a bitch
to you over the years,

474
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:23,082
and here you are
rowing me out to dump her ashes.

475
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:27,448
Well, it's really no big deal.

476
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:32,792
Yes, it is. You stepped up
when nobody else would,

477
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:35,890
and here I am thinking
you have an ulterior motive.

478
00:35:39,003 --> 00:35:43,099
Susan, you're such a good person.

479
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:45,300
And I'm such a bitch.

480
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:51,206
Edie, you're not that bad,
and, believe me, I'm not that good.

481
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:55,241
- Yes, you are.
- Please don't do this.

482
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:58,049
And Martha may be gone,

483
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:01,956
but the good Lord above
has shown me that I'm not alone.

484
00:36:02,026 --> 00:36:05,393
I am so grateful
that I still have a true friend.

485
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,427
Thank you, Susan.

486
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:15,301
Edie, I burned your house down.

487
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:16,772
Huh?

488
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:21,403
I was scared you were sleeping
with Mike and so I let myself in.

489
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:25,209
I accidentally knocked a candle over
and the whole... just...

490
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:30,084
I'm so sorry. Can you ever forgive me?

491
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:46,499
Row me back... now.

492
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:56,472
I'm sorry about before, shoving you.
I didn't mean...

493
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,606
I'm not gonna break.

494
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:02,644
I'm sorry, too.

495
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:05,881
Questioning your commitment, your guts.

496
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:10,417
- I know better than that.
- Yeah, you should.

497
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:17,065
I keep this with me all the time
to remind me why I'm there.

498
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:21,501
If it turns out someone hurt her,
I want them dead.

499
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:24,541
We need to be sure
before we do anything.

500
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:29,637
When you're sure, I know
I can trust you to take care of it.

501
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:34,447
After all,
you already killed for her once.

502
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:42,250
[Vacuum cleaner]

503
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:08,978
Yeah, is this the pharmacy?

504
00:38:09,086 --> 00:38:12,817
My wife asked me to call.
She lost her prescription.

505
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:16,621
Gabrielle Solis.
Yeah, the birth-control pills.

506
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:23,193
Great, great. She'll be very relieved.
Can she get enough for a couple months?

507
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:27,569
That's right. Better safe than sorry.

508
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:31,197
Thanks a lot. Oh, do you guys deliver?

509
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:44,112
Edie, please talk to me.

510
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:52,093
I've been thinking about this
for the last 90 miles and...

511
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,654
you don't have to forgive me.

512
00:38:54,765 --> 00:38:59,429
You can go to the police, kick me,
you can burn my house down.

513
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:03,667
You just have to know
that I am so racked with guilt,

514
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:09,270
I don't think it's possible for me
to suffer any more than I am already.

515
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:13,078
Boy, I'd like to put
that theory to the test.

516
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:21,084
Well, whatever you want to do, Edie.

517
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:25,818
Just know that I'm sorry.

518
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:36,204
I'm not going to the police.

519
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:38,172
- You're not?
- No.

520
00:39:38,242 --> 00:39:42,076
The insurance company will investigate
and it'll delay my check.

521
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:44,909
- Thank you.
- But...

522
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:51,179
...there is something
I want you to do for me.

523
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:54,554
Of course. Anything.
You name it. What?

524
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:57,287
I want to be invited
to your poker game.

525
00:39:57,361 --> 00:40:00,421
- Our poker games?
- I'm not saying I'll go.

526
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:04,433
And I'm not saying you and your
little friends have to be nice to me,

527
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:09,235
but every once in a while, yeah,
it would be nice to be asked.

528
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:16,275
We meet on Tuesdays. And it's pot-luck
lunch. Everybody brings something.

529
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:19,315
- I'm not bringing anything.
- You don't have to.

530
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:22,611
Well, this is good.

531
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:25,914
Thank you.

532
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:32,994
I guess I should go take a shower
and wash Mrs. Huber off me.

533
00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:35,632
Hold it.

534
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:41,603
I can't stand the thought of Martha's
ashes going down some sewer drain.

535
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:46,432
Well, Edie, I have to clean up.

536
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:50,002
Well, this is such a beautiful lawn.

537
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,742
We could put her to rest right here.

538
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:56,309
- On my front lawn?
- Why not?

539
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:59,015
She can spend eternity
looking at her house

540
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,591
and keep an eye on the neighborhood.

541
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:03,887
She'd like that.

542
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:07,122
Stand over here. I'll hose you off.

543
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:11,593
I don't think so.

544
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:14,160
You owe me.

545
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:25,109
Martha, I'm gonna miss you.

546
00:41:42,466 --> 00:41:44,934
Death is inevitable.

547
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:48,529
It's a promise
made to each of us at birth.

548
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:50,938
But before that promise is kept,

549
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:54,374
we all hope
something will happen to us.

550
00:41:56,647 --> 00:41:59,548
Whether it's the thrill of romance...

551
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:04,378
...the joy of raising a family...

552
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:07,355
- I'm gonna get you.
- I'm gonna get you.

553
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:10,359
...or the anguish of great loss...

554
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:17,932
...we all hope to experience something
that makes our lives meaningful.

555
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:26,606
But the sad fact is
not all lives have meaning.

556
00:42:28,612 --> 00:42:33,675
Some people spend their time on this
planet just sitting on the sidelines...

557
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:39,281
...waiting for something
to happen to them...

558
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:43,354
...before it's too late.
