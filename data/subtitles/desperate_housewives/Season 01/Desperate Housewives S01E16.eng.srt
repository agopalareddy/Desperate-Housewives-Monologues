2
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,026
Previously on Desperate Housewives...

3
00:00:03,103 --> 00:00:04,161
Hi, Maisy.

4
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,435
Are you having an affair with Rex?

5
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:10,135
Mistresses were confronted.

6
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,678
- What's that?
- I'm on house arrest.

7
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:15,476
- How are you gonna work?
- I can't.

8
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:17,641
The tables were turned.

9
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:21,187
- Good Lord, that's Angela.
- And secrets from the past...

10
00:00:21,287 --> 00:00:24,848
- My wife's name was Mary Alice.
...caught up with everyone.

11
00:00:24,924 --> 00:00:28,257
I'm such an idiot!
You're such a liar. Oh, and a killer.

12
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:37,197
Even in the most respectable
of neighborhoods,

13
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:39,771
you can hear the sound of scandal.

14
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:46,575
Some scandals
announce themselves with a shout.

15
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:50,308
Ida? Ida Greenberg,
that is not your paper.

16
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:54,709
Some with a whisper.

17
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:58,222
Throw me a 20,
and I'll hook you up with free porn.

18
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:05,860
- And some with a bang.
- Get the hell off my lawn!

19
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:11,234
And once in great while, there
comes a scandal so deliciously sordid,

20
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:14,239
its roar drowns out all other noise.

21
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:19,603
Does your husband have any idea how
many men pay to sleep in this bed?

22
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:24,081
There's not a lot of sleeping going on.
Not if I'm doing my job right.

23
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:28,280
So, how do you wanna get started?

24
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:30,618
With these.

25
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:33,817
Well! That's gonna cost you extra.

26
00:01:33,893 --> 00:01:37,886
Maisy Gibbons,
you're under arrest for solicitation.

27
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:40,557
- What?
- Please place your hands on the bed.

28
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:43,966
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. Now.

29
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,902
Hey! Get off me!

30
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:51,705
This is entrapment.
You all are making a gigantic mistake.

31
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:55,179
Yeah, yeah. Hey, fellas,
here's one for your memoirs.

32
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:56,272
Hey!

33
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,518
No! No, don't you touch me!
You... get your hands off me!

34
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:06,183
[Policeman] Take it easy.

35
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:09,626
Yes, the scandalous arrest
of Maisy Gibbons

36
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:13,130
would soon prove to be the shot
heard round the world.

37
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:57,167
[Maisy] Don't you put me in here.

38
00:02:57,277 --> 00:03:01,008
It is often said
that good news travels fast.

39
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:05,551
But as every housewife knows,
bad news moves quite a bit faster.

40
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:11,648
Tish? You are not going to believe this.
Maisy Gibbons was arrested.

41
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:14,659
- You cannot be serious!
- Did you hear about Maisy?

42
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:16,820
[All gossiping]

43
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:21,697
Maisy Gibbons running in handcuffs?
I'd have killed to see that!

44
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:23,599
Stay put. I'll be right back.

45
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:28,403
[Man] Ladies, please calm down.
This is just a precaution.

46
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:31,568
- If you'll just take a flyer.
- Hey, guys. What's going on?

47
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:34,736
There's been an outbreak of head lice.

48
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:35,905
Head lice?

49
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:39,474
These flyers detail
all the important information,

50
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:42,919
including
the recommended delousing combs.

51
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:45,320
Delousing. It sounds so disgusting.

52
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:48,758
- Anybody know where it started?
- That's confidential.

53
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:51,921
Barcliff maintains
a strict "no blame" policy.

54
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:53,089
Guys, over here.

55
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:56,966
Parents have a right to know
who brought this into our school.

56
00:03:57,103 --> 00:04:01,802
Please calm down, ma'am. There's nothing
to be gained by pointing fingers.

57
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:06,173
To identify the child who initiated
the outbreak might result in him

58
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,147
or her being subjected to ridicule.

59
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:13,080
I, um... Excuse me.

60
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:16,713
- If you'll just take a flyer...
- Stop scratching.

61
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:19,553
Stop it. Guys, let's go, OK?

62
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:21,719
Stop scratching. Stop, stop...

63
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:25,827
- Hey. See you later.
- Bye.

64
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,927
[Gabrielle humming]

65
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:42,239
What the hell...?

66
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,144
- Gabrielle!
- What?

67
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:51,656
- Gabrielle. We got a problem here.
- I can't hear you.

68
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:54,750
I think we got a problem.
The water's backing up here.

69
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:56,689
[Gabrielle] What?

70
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:59,960
- Is that sewage?
- [Gabrielle screams]

71
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:02,967
Yeah, that's sewage.

72
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:06,368
So, uh, Mike,
the suspense is killing us.

73
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,498
Just tell us the bad news.

74
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:12,636
Your outtake pipe's corroded.
That's why it collapsed.

75
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:15,476
I'll have to re-pipe the whole system.

76
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:17,981
And how much is this gonna cost?

77
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:21,986
I'll do the job at cost, but you're
still looking at six, seven grand.

78
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:25,557
OK, we'll let you know.

79
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:30,323
Look, um... if money's an issue...

80
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,796
Oh, no. No, no, no. It's not the money.

81
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:37,427
Carlos and I are prioritizing some
things we need to do around the house.

82
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:41,769
You don't consider sewage
backing up in the house a priority?

83
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,901
It's definitely on the short list.

84
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:50,978
I'm surprised you called me.

85
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,645
- Why?
- Well, um, ever since my arrest,

86
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:58,680
nobody around here seems
to want to have much to do with me.

87
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:03,587
Innocent until proven guilty, my man.

88
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:07,858
I hope he's more innocent than you are.

89
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:11,461
Hey, it's Lynette. I know
you're down about this Mike thing,

90
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:14,767
but you gotta come to poker.
It'll be worth it.

91
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,206
I got dirt on Maisy Gibbons.

92
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,334
[Bep]

93
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:23,939
[Mike] Hey, Susan, it's me. Look,
I really wish you'd return my calls.

94
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:26,746
We ned to talk.
I know I messed things...

95
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:28,577
You OK?

96
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:31,581
Hi.

97
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:35,593
- You know I can stay home if you want.
- No, no, no. Now, I know how much

98
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:39,927
you were looking forward to this weekend
with your dad. I'm fine.

99
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:43,560
- You don't look fine.
- Well, I'm a little sad.

100
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:46,830
Mike and I were just a fling.

101
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:50,842
Not even a full fling.
Sort of a borderline fling.

102
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,004
Mom, anyone can see
how much you loved him.

103
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,742
I also loved junk food
and I gave that up.

104
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:57,840
[Car horn]

105
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,918
There's your father. Go have fun.

106
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:04,347
Last chance. You sure?

107
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:06,391
I'm sure. Now, go.

108
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:18,602
You'll find someone else, Mom.

109
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:20,434
Someone great.

110
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:22,599
I know it.

111
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:37,882
What's wrong? Didn't you enjoy
your golf game with Dr. Wallace?

112
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,949
I didn't play.
I'm still feeling sluggish.

113
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:43,587
Still? Did you talk to him about that?

114
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:48,225
Of course. He doesn't know
why the medication isn't working.

115
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:50,632
[Laughter]

116
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:55,470
Tish is making the rounds.
She must have some juicy anecdote.

117
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:58,442
Get her over here.
I could use a funny story today.

118
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:00,572
Tish! Tish!

119
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:06,982
I can tell you've got something good.
Now come on, don't be selfish.

120
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:11,683
Well, first off, you're not friends
with Maisy Gibbons, are you?

121
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:16,887
- No.
- Thank God, because this is too good.

122
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,090
Maisy was arrested.

123
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:23,225
While Harold was at work, she was
having sex in her house for money.

124
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,031
Can you imagine?

125
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:29,200
No. I can't.

126
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:34,338
And word is, she had a little black book
with all her clients' names.

127
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:40,613
So, uh... you think that'll get out?

128
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,244
Of course!

129
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:46,280
Nancy, Wait up.
I can't wait to tell you this.

130
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:51,159
Well, you heard your funny story, Rex.

131
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:53,494
Why aren't you laughing?

132
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,362
[Laughter]

133
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:03,708
[Phone]

134
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:05,835
I'll get it.

135
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:11,577
- Ah-ah-ah.
- Hello? Hi, Tammy. Yeah...

136
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:15,951
- Can we see one of the bugs?
- Yeah, here. See?

137
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:21,322
It's this little white thing.
Look, it looks like a sesame seed.

138
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,659
- That's cool.
- Lots more where that came from.

139
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,597
No, I'm so sorry.
Uh, he must be so disappointed.

140
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:32,001
We'll get all the boys together
once Topher's back on his feet.

141
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,301
- Bye.
- What'd Tammy want?

142
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:37,809
She's canceling Topher's party
He's got measles.

143
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,470
Measles, huh?

144
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,604
Yeah.

145
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:44,373
What?

146
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:46,917
Tammy spent a fortune
on Topher's party.

147
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:51,923
She'd call in specialists from
Switzerland before she'd cancel it.

148
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,618
Why would Tammy lie to us?

149
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:59,563
She saw Porter scratching his head
at school. Now word's getting around.

150
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:03,762
Why is everything a conspiracy theory?
Kids get lice. It's not a big deal.

151
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:07,202
It is for the rich B-l-T-C-H-es
at Barcliff Academy.

152
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:10,605
It's been one day and
they've been disinvited to a party.

153
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:16,444
If rumors start flying, these boys can
kiss campouts and pool parties goodbye.

154
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:17,982
Uh-oh.

155
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,109
Yeah. Not so cool now, huh?

156
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:26,217
It's all here. Appraisal,
title search, escrow documents.

157
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:30,159
Sorry about changing my mind but
it's not a good time to sell the house.

158
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:32,993
Zach wants to finish high school
before moving.

159
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:36,660
It's part of the business.
I expect to get screwed over.

160
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,696
Now, where is your house key?

161
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:45,374
Oh, I must have left it at home.
I'll bring it by tonight.

162
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:49,676
Zach's away and I'm going
to Mount Pleasant on business today.

163
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:54,743
- Just, uh, drop it by tomorrow.
- Or I could just keep it.

164
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:55,946
What?

165
00:10:56,055 --> 00:11:00,822
It's a joke. I know your wife's dead
but it's been six months. Lighten up.

166
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,521
- Hello!
- Felicia.

167
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:06,258
Oh. Hi, Felicia.

168
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:10,291
Edie, I found this in my sister's
things. It has your name on it.

169
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:17,070
Oh, my necklace! Oh, you know,
I lent this to Martha three months ago.

170
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:20,306
And she said
that it went down the drain.

171
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:24,873
Oh, I miss how we used to steal things
from one another.

172
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:28,681
So, Felicia, I heard they have
a suspect in your sister's murder.

173
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:33,048
- Mike Delfino?
- Oh, he didn't kill her.

174
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,320
They found her jewelry in his garage.

175
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:39,125
- His fingerprints weren't on any of it.
- That just means he wore gloves.

176
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,257
So, he's smart enough to use gloves,

177
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:44,825
but he leaves her blood-spattered
jewelry lying around

178
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:50,204
for anyone to find? Please. Is that
what you'd do if you killed someone?

179
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:53,439
I don't know what goes through
the mind of a murderer.

180
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:56,413
I'm just saying
I wouldn't trust him if I were you.

181
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:02,481
Edie, that is lovely.

182
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,149
- Is it an antique?
- Yeah. I think so.

183
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:09,388
I know a store you would love.
It specializes in antique jewelry.

184
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:13,261
It's in Salt Lake City.
Have you ever been to Salt Lake City?

185
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:18,326
No. I try to steer clear of Utah.
It's a little too conservative for me.

186
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,567
Too bad. Have you ever been, Paul?

187
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:24,174
No.

188
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:28,872
It's lovely. I used to live there
when I was a nurse.

189
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:33,680
You should definitely go some time.

190
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,778
Bye.

191
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:41,793
[Mary Alice] With no indoor plumbing,

192
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:47,299
Gabrielle was now forced to improvise
when it came to her personal hygiene,

193
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:50,699
wherever and whenever
she had the opportunity.

194
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,038
- Sorry.
- That's OK.

195
00:12:57,143 --> 00:13:00,135
I was just about to give
a Maisy Gibbons update.

196
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:06,446
Guys, we should be ashamed of ourselves
for reveling in that woman's misery.

197
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:09,921
That being said, Edie, please continue.

198
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:13,917
I hear from a very reliable source

199
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:17,189
that Maisy's gonna cut a deal
with the prosecution.

200
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:20,628
Apparently,
she has some high-profile johns

201
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:23,224
and the DA's looking for a second term.

202
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:27,567
I don't get it.
I don't get who would pay Maisy for sex.

203
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,371
Obviously someone
who's not getting it at home.

204
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:35,539
So, the upshot is, Maisy is going
to turn over her little black book

205
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:38,105
with all of her clients' names.

206
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,015
Really?

207
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:43,178
Can you imagine
the fallout when this goes public?

208
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:46,053
Ooh, blood on the walls.

209
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,523
- [Gabrielle] I'm all in.
- [Lynette] I'll call.

210
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:55,991
Bree?

211
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:03,433
- Uh... what just happened?
- The stakes were raised.

212
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,602
Yes. Yes, they were.

213
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:08,772
I fold.

214
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:11,707
You were lucky today.

215
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:15,844
Luck had nothing to do with it.
I was bluffing the entire time.

216
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:17,821
Really? Wow. You're good.

217
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:22,155
That's the only nice thing
I can say about my first husband.

218
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:24,958
- He taught me how to bluff.
- He played poker?

219
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:30,161
No. He was lousy in bed.
I had to fake a lot of orgasms.

220
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:36,402
- You don't have to respond.
- Thank you.

221
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,973
So, uh... where was Susan today?

222
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,742
Uh... I'm not sure.

223
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:47,183
Wow. Tom must be great in bed.

224
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:48,344
Huh?

225
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:53,585
Obviously,
you have no idea how to bluff.

226
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:58,062
OK, she's going through something and
I'm sure she'd prefer it to be private.

227
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:01,530
She's upset with Mike, isn't she?

228
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,730
Well, come on.
I'm gonna find out sooner or later.

229
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:09,865
She's devastated about the break-up
and she hasn't left the house in days.

230
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:13,138
Well, why didn't you just tell me that?

231
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:17,740
It's personal. It's the kind of thing
she would only tell her friends.

232
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:20,216
I'm Susan's friend.

233
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:24,886
Well, I don't hate her.

234
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:28,723
If you want me to share stuff with you,
be more supportive of Susan.

235
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:31,387
OK. How?

236
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:36,295
What do friends do? They call.
They're sympathetic.

237
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:41,601
They ask about the pain the other person
is going through and then they listen.

238
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:44,074
What if you want to be supportive,

239
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:47,509
but you just can't stand
listening to people bitch?

240
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:50,047
Then it's good to know how to bluff.

241
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:12,800
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, thank you.

242
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:18,000
I know, it's very exciting.

243
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,135
Thank you.

244
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:23,737
You know, I really think
you do deserve this award...

245
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:44,161
God, I have to go to the bathroom again.

246
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:46,864
- Go to Bree's.
- I've been to Bree's.

247
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:49,373
- Then go to Susan's.
- I hate Susan's.

248
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:53,070
She has all these weird scented candles.
It reeks of apricot.

249
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,304
Hose.

250
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:55,971
How about Lynette's?

251
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:59,346
No. I don't want
to go to anybody's house anymore.

252
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:03,854
I'm tired of making up excuses
as to why we haven't fixed our plumbing.

253
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:06,481
- Why yell at me?
- It's your fault.

254
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:07,616
My fault?

255
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:11,026
If you hadn't gotten indicted,
we would have pipes right now.

256
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:13,496
I got indicted making money
to keep you happy.

257
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:15,658
You're a little materialistic.

258
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:19,170
Me? When the Johnson's
bought their new seven series

259
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:23,402
you were the one who went and
traded in his car for something better.

260
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:25,875
Who ended up driving it?

261
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:29,141
I don't have time to fight right now.
I have laundry to do.

262
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:45,029
- Nurse Abigail?
- Mrs. Scavo, right? The twins' mother?

263
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:49,693
Yeah. I just wanted to tell you
that the boys are now lice-free.

264
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:51,861
Good to hear.

265
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:58,171
I just can't figure out
how it happened.

266
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:03,579
They get a bath every night. Trust me.
It's the ugliest 15 minutes of the day.

267
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:05,582
I believe you.

268
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:12,052
I keep thinking maybe it was the
petting zoo I took them to last week.

269
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:16,584
- That Ilama was really iffy.
- Mrs. Scavo, it doesn't work that way.

270
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:20,654
Lice spreads from human to human.
The cleanest kid in the world can get it

271
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:23,166
if he gets too close to the wrong kid.

272
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:25,066
- Really?
- Yes.

273
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:28,903
- So don't be so hard on yourself.
- I guess.

274
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:31,771
Still, I can't help but feel guilty.

275
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:35,041
After all, my kids
started an entire lice outbreak.

276
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:39,073
Look, your, uh...
your kids didn't start it.

277
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:42,245
They didn't?

278
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:46,314
No. I know for a fact that
Patient Zero was another little boy.

279
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:49,553
This is his fourth time
with this particular problem.

280
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:51,756
Oh.

281
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,958
That's a load off my mind.

282
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:58,695
Well, thank you.

283
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:06,234
- So which kid is it?
- I can't tell you.

284
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,643
You know we have a "no blame" policy.

285
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:11,443
We have to protect the children.

286
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,542
Of course.

287
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:18,249
No, I don't.
You're gonna have to give me a name.

288
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:20,416
- Mrs. Scavo...
- Here's the thing.

289
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,517
Acting like parents
won't assign blame

290
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:26,029
is like pretending they don't keep score
at Pee Wee League games.

291
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:28,589
If you don't give the mob
someone to blame,

292
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:32,296
they'll pick a scapegoat.
I can't let my boys be the scapegoat.

293
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:35,363
- Don't put me in this position.
- I'm begging you.

294
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,433
They've been uninvited from a party.
A really big birthday party,

295
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:42,673
with a bouncy house,
a hotdog stand and a clown.

296
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:44,306
I wish I could help you.

297
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:46,578
There's gonna be a magician!

298
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,778
Tammy Brennan went all out.

299
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:53,849
Tammy Brennan? Topher's mother?

300
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,188
Yes.

301
00:19:57,062 --> 00:20:01,226
Well, isn't that interesting?
Have a seat.

302
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:07,934
Meanwhile,
at the Fairview County Prison,

303
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,874
Maisy Gibbons was delighted
to find out she had a visitor.

304
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:16,244
But she was soon reminded,
one should always beware of visitors

305
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,374
bearing gift baskets.

306
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:23,153
You've gotta be kidding me.

307
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,281
Hello, Maisy.

308
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:00,484
Ta-da!

309
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,127
Stuff like this is why I love you.

310
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:22,380
So, what brings you here?

311
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,938
I need a favor.

312
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:27,417
I thought as much.

313
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:34,091
I heard that there's a little black book
with the name of your clients in it.

314
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,253
There is.

315
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:42,267
I was wondering if, perhaps, you could
remove Rex's name from that little book?

316
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:45,235
Wow. That's a big favor.

317
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:48,966
Those muffins better be really good.

318
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:54,942
I have some money that
I've been putting aside for emergencies.

319
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,344
It can be all yours, if you just...

320
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,441
Keep my mouth shut?

321
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:03,778
Continue to be discreet.

322
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:07,621
Gosh, I don't know.

323
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:11,623
I don't think it's asking that much.

324
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:14,291
All you need to do
is remove one little name.

325
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:19,201
But if I do it for you, then I have
to do it for all the other wives.

326
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,837
That wouldn't be fair, now, would it?

327
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:27,470
Maisy, please.
I mean, we used to be good friends.

328
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:31,141
Where were you when Harold
lost his job a year ago, huh?

329
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:33,684
Did you ask if there
was anything you could do?

330
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:35,845
Did you bring
a basket of baked goods

331
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:38,889
when you knew
we couldn't even pay our bills?

332
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:44,657
If you did, those displays of friendship
seem to have slipped my mind.

333
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:49,723
Maisy, I didn't mention it when you were
having financial troubles because...

334
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:54,204
- I thought it would embarrass you.
- I would've been embarrassed.

335
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:57,605
But it would have been
a whole lot better than the silence.

336
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:02,202
I have $14,000 in that account.
It can all be yours.

337
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,951
I'm not interested.

338
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:17,350
But you do get credit for one thing.

339
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:22,365
You came to visit me.
Even if it was for an ulterior motive.

340
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:27,872
None of the other girls from the club
bothered. I've been abandoned.

341
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:31,431
Guess that's what happens
when you become the town whore.

342
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:36,447
Oh, sweetie, they didn't
abandon you because you're a whore.

343
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:40,884
They abandoned you because
you weren't all that nice to begin with.

344
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:57,626
[Knocking]

345
00:23:57,736 --> 00:23:59,795
- Who is it?
- It's Edie.

346
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:01,736
Edie, not now. I'm busy.

347
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:04,367
- Hi.
- Or just come on in.

348
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:06,876
What are you doing?

349
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:10,607
I decided that
my life is way too complicated.

350
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:15,483
And so I'm simplifying.
I am getting rid of the clutter.

351
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:17,988
Ooh.

352
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,759
I was on vacation.
It made sense at the time.

353
00:24:23,428 --> 00:24:26,989
OK, not to be rude,
but is there a reason you're here?

354
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:31,661
I feel badly about
what you're going through with Mike.

355
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:35,502
- Don't worry, I'm not gonna date him.
- It doesn't matter anymore.

356
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:40,136
Well, don't get me wrong. I still have
every intention of sleeping with him.

357
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:42,840
Some mountains
are just meant to be climbed.

358
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:46,111
I gotta learn to keep my doors locked.

359
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,812
How long have you been sitting here?

360
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:52,983
I don't know. Five minutes,
give or take three hours?

361
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:56,221
That's it. Get up. Get dressed.

362
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,387
- Why?
- You're coming with me.

363
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:02,126
It's time to get wasted.
Happy Hour started 45 minutes ago.

364
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,101
Why would I go anywhere with you?

365
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:07,332
That's what normal women do
when they get depressed.

366
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:10,397
They put on short skirts,
they go to bars,

367
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:15,503
have one too many and make out with
a man in the back of a dark alley.

368
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:17,309
Wow.

369
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:19,646
Come on. It'll be fun.

370
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:21,718
I swear. Come on.

371
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:24,311
- Come on!
- Why do you even care?

372
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:27,483
I never said I cared.

373
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,459
It's just...

374
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:35,522
Well, I guess I know what it's like
to have your heart stomped on.

375
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:43,199
OK. All right. Gimme a minute.
I'll go change my clothes.

376
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:48,742
And don't forget to do something
with that skanky hair.

377
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:51,077
You're a little scary looking.

378
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:53,014
[# Billy Ocean: Caribbean Quen]

379
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:58,717
Ah! What about him?

380
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:00,484
Not my type.

381
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,757
The pickin's are slim, but isn't
there someone here you're attracted to?

382
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:08,993
I hate 'em all.
Look at 'em just leering at us.

383
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,194
They're so cocky.
They know they have the upper hand.

384
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:16,502
We have the upper hand.
Without us, they have nothing.

385
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:20,534
Maybe 15 years ago. Not anymore.
Now we're just Ionely and desperate.

386
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:24,513
And they know it. And they
just sit there, ready to pounce,

387
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:30,145
waiting for us to take any crumb
they're willing to throw our way.

388
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:33,122
I don't want crumbs. I want Mike.

389
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:36,888
Hi. Um, I'm gonna be
spending the whole night with her,

390
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:40,362
so I'm gonna be needing
a lot more of these.

391
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:45,027
I'm sorry. It's just so hard
to find a guy like Mike.

392
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:47,970
I know in my heart
he didn't kill Mrs. Huber.

393
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:52,408
OK. Let's say Mike's a peach.
And he didn't kill Martha. Who did?

394
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:53,808
I don't know.

395
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:59,111
Obviously, a bad guy. Somebody
really awful. Somebody like...

396
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,411
somebody like Paul Young.

397
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:03,612
Paul?

398
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:08,591
- Are you serious?
- He's hiding something.

399
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:12,652
He clams up every time
we try to ask him about Mary Alice.

400
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:15,859
And then when we found out about Dana...

401
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:17,401
Who's Dana?

402
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:21,132
Paul and Mary Alice
had a baby that died.

403
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:22,969
You're kidding.

404
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:26,442
- Zach killed her.
- Holy crap. Who told you that?

405
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:28,502
Paul. He said it was an accident

406
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:32,606
but I think that's why
Mary Alice was being blackmailed.

407
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:35,710
- Mary Alice was being blackmailed?
- Yeah.

408
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:39,848
The girls and I
found a threatening note in her stuff.

409
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:43,157
What kind of street do we live on?

410
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:45,253
I don't know.

411
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:51,026
Come to think of it, the other day,
Paul was talking to Felicia

412
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:55,038
and he was working overtime
trying to make Mike sound guilty.

413
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:59,338
See? Shifting blame onto someone else.
Classic criminal behavior.

414
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:01,435
He's up to no good.

415
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,344
Zach and Paul are out of town.

416
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:06,781
We should sneak into their house
and snoop. I have the key.

417
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:10,412
- Oh, my God. Yes, we should do that.
- I was just kidding.

418
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:13,616
This is our chance.
We should go in for ten minutes.

419
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:16,058
That's breaking and entering.

420
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:18,425
Martha Huber was your best friend.

421
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:23,297
If we could find out who killed her,
wouldn't that be worth the risk?

422
00:28:27,238 --> 00:28:30,298
- [Waiter] Have a nice evening.
- [Bree] Thank you.

423
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,707
Serena, hi. How are you?

424
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:38,743
- I talked to Dr. Wallace today.
- Oh?

425
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:41,684
Still no idea
why the medication's not working.

426
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:43,846
He said he's thinking of more tests.

427
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:48,222
I said I'm thinking
about getting a second opinion.

428
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:55,230
Rex, this might sound silly,
but are people staring at us?

429
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:02,598
Yeah. What's going on?

430
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:07,008
Well, I could be wrong, but I suspect
that Maisy Gibbons' client list

431
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,273
has been released.

432
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:16,545
You think they're laughing at us?

433
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:20,954
No, I think they're laughing at you.
I think they feel sorry for me,

434
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:24,426
- which is just as mortifying.
- What are we gonna do?

435
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:28,091
We're gonna act like
nothing is happening.

436
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:30,292
And when we've finished eating,

437
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:34,270
we'll walk out of here with
all the dignity that we can muster.

438
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:38,270
Please. Let's go now.

439
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:42,244
I refuse to give them this kind
of satisfaction. Open your menu.

440
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:45,305
Everybody's staring.
Bree, it's humiliating.

441
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:49,114
Should've thought of that before
you left a check on Maisy's nightstand.

442
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:51,485
All right. You stay here. I'm leaving.

443
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:55,754
Rex! If you walk out of this restaurant,
I will scream.

444
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:59,285
- Bree...
- I will scream about your cruelty,

445
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:03,425
I will scream about your infidelity.
And to make sure it really hurts,

446
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:07,938
I will scream about
your distasteful sexual habits.

447
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:12,738
You want to know what true humiliation
is, you just take one step.

448
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:35,125
So, what are you having?
The veal looks good.

449
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:49,810
What are we looking for?
An embroidered pillow that says

450
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:51,439
"I Killed Martha Huber"?

451
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,144
I don't know.
Just something... suspicious.

452
00:30:57,589 --> 00:31:00,285
Mmm. Smells expensive.

453
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:10,229
- Do you believe in evil, Edie?
- Of course. I work in real estate.

454
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:16,035
I'm serious. There's something about
this house that's so cold and creepy.

455
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:19,975
You couldn't tell
when Mary Alice was alive.

456
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:23,639
She just brought so much
warmth and light.

457
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:28,917
Now there's something...

458
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,750
I can just taste it. Can't you sense it?

459
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:35,589
The only thing I can sense
is that you've had too much to drink.

460
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:41,189
Something happened in this house,
so awful we can't even imagine it.

461
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:45,901
- [Edie] Ow! Sonofabitch!
- Are you OK?

462
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,900
I just stubbed my toe.

463
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:53,136
- Oh, my God! Angela.
- Huh?

464
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:55,473
Mary Alice used to call herself Angela.

465
00:31:55,613 --> 00:31:56,705
What?

466
00:31:56,781 --> 00:32:00,273
It was on a tape Bree stole
from her therapist's office.

467
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:03,115
It's a long story.
We gotta pop this in.

468
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:07,020
[Door shuts]

469
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,559
- What was that?
- I think it's Paul.

470
00:32:09,627 --> 00:32:13,996
- You said he was gonna be gone.
- Well, I guess I was wrong.

471
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:16,123
- Hurry!
- I gotta get the tape.

472
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:17,892
Hide!

473
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:20,927
[Susan] Oh, oh, oh!

474
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,254
- Paul.
- [Gasps]

475
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:50,494
Edie! God, you scared me.

476
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:51,728
I'm sorry.

477
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:55,239
I see that you, uh, made it back
from Mount Pleasant.

478
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,934
Yes.
What... what are you doing here?

479
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:01,809
I came by to bring you your key.
I was just about to leave you a note.

480
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:04,712
You're returning my key
at 11.30 at night?

481
00:33:04,782 --> 00:33:07,012
What the hell is going on here?

482
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:11,283
You're right.
We're too old to be playing games.

483
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:12,583
What?

484
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:18,594
My note was gonna tell you that I, um...
I... I wasn't kidding this afternoon.

485
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:21,564
I really would like to keep a key
to your place.

486
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:25,635
To use if the mood strikes me.

487
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,472
You've been drinking.

488
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:32,202
Just enough to get up the courage
to tell you how I feel about you.

489
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:09,637
OK, well, obviously
you're uncomfortable about this.

490
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:13,615
So, I'm really sorry if I embarrassed
you. Here... Here's your key.

491
00:34:15,753 --> 00:34:20,053
- I'll see you around.
- Edie. Um, I'm not embarrassed.

492
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:23,821
- Huh?
- If anything, I'm flattered.

493
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,831
Susan.

494
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:32,664
Susan, talk to me.

495
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:35,638
Mike, I'm a little drunk
and a little freaked out.

496
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,605
You haven't returned my messages.

497
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:40,667
We're broken up.
I thought I made that pretty clear.

498
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:43,213
- Can't we work this out?
- You lied to me.

499
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:44,680
When did I lie to you?

500
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:48,776
The police showed me your rap sheet.
You killed a man.

501
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:51,754
- You believe I'm a killer?
- No. Of course not.

502
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:54,291
But I didn't believe
Karl would cheat on me.

503
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:57,259
I didn't believe
Mary Alice would kill herself.

504
00:34:57,361 --> 00:34:59,522
Mike, blind faith is not my friend.

505
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,428
I was gonna tell you.
There wasn't a right moment.

506
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:05,459
Now that's a lie.
There were plenty of right moments.

507
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:08,061
When we went for pizza,
you could've said,

508
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:10,232
"By the way, I once killed a man".

509
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:13,310
Or when you said, "Let's jog",
you could've said,

510
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:15,606
"By the way, I killed a man".

511
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,342
At the movies,
when the hero shot the bad guy,

512
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:20,907
you could've said
"By the way, I did that once".

513
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:23,010
You didn't.

514
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,351
Do you want to hear what happened?

515
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:29,551
It doesn't matter. I will never
believe anything you say again.

516
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:47,406
Well, at the very least
you can believe that.

517
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,965
- Occupied!
- Carlos, I have to go.

518
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:09,930
You'll have to wait.

519
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:11,864
It's my port-a-potty.

520
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:14,962
- What do you mean it's yours?
- I'm the one who stole it.

521
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:18,531
Babe, I'm sorry.
You're just gonna have to wait.

522
00:36:27,051 --> 00:36:31,147
Thank you so much, Bree. Seeing your
tile has helped me make my decision.

523
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:34,385
Next time I remodel,
I am using limestone.

524
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:37,427
Gabrielle, is everything OK?

525
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,027
Sure. Why?

526
00:36:40,097 --> 00:36:43,658
Well, it's just that
you've been acting kinda odd lately.

527
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:46,328
In what way?

528
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:50,067
You keep coming up with excuses
to use everyone's bathroom.

529
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:53,474
And then two days ago Mr. Cawley
looked into your back yard

530
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:58,106
and saw you and Carlos
doing your laundry in the Jacuzzi.

531
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:06,483
Well, uh... there's a simple explanation
for that. I, um...

532
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:10,391
Are you and Carlos
having some sort of money trouble?

533
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:14,921
- Gaby, it's OK if you are.
- Is that so?

534
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:17,729
Yes. And I'm a little insulted.

535
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:23,297
I am a good friend. Why would you feel
like you have to hide that from me?

536
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:30,540
Probably for the same reason you didn't
tell me Rex was one of Maisy's clients.

537
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:32,947
That is obviously different.

538
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:36,953
Why? Because it happened to you?

539
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:40,220
Bree, this is how I see it:

540
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:43,954
Good friends support each other
after they've been humiliated.

541
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:47,964
Great friends pretend
nothing happened in the first place.

542
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:57,100
Well, then, good luck on your remodel.

543
00:37:57,174 --> 00:38:00,632
And please tell Rex I said hello.

544
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:25,562
- Hey, Tammy.
- Lynette!

545
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:30,000
I see Topher's made a speedy recovery.

546
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:33,100
- Can we go play?
- Yeah, sure, boys. Have fun.

547
00:38:33,177 --> 00:38:35,611
[Porter]
Let's go play in the bounce house.

548
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:42,108
All right, you caught me. I lied.

549
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:46,555
But you have some nerve crashing
a six-year-old's birthday party.

550
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:49,683
Just so you know, I got Topher
a set of bongo drums.

551
00:38:49,794 --> 00:38:52,092
You'll love them
as much as he will.

552
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:55,690
Charlie, come out. I don't
want you playing with those Scavo boys.

553
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:58,462
Mona, please! I'm sure they're clean.

554
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:03,529
You are not ruining my party.

555
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:10,380
Porter. Preston. OK, out, out, out.
Come on. Porter. Preston. Let's go.

556
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:12,939
Not quite yet.
Boys, keep bouncing.

557
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:15,018
That's right, keep bouncing.

558
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:20,615
Oh, by the way, I spoke to Nurse
Abigail. I know who Patient Zero is.

559
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,553
All right, that's it, kids. Get out.

560
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:26,289
Out, out, out! Go! Go!

561
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:29,890
How could you do that?

562
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:33,232
Look, this party
meant everything to Topher.

563
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:37,832
I couldn't risk people not showing up.
I had to do something.

564
00:39:37,908 --> 00:39:40,900
And so you let
my kids take the fall?

565
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:44,209
People were already suspicious.

566
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:46,340
- Oh, please.
- Yeah, it's true.

567
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:49,248
Your boys
aren't the cleanest kids on the planet.

568
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:56,920
- That was not a smart thing to say.
- Where are you going?

569
00:39:56,994 --> 00:39:59,929
I'm going to tell the truth
to every mother out there.

570
00:39:59,997 --> 00:40:02,989
And then I'm gonna take back the bongos.

571
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:06,764
No, wait! OK, all right.
Uh, look, I was wrong. I admit it.

572
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:10,830
- I'm really sorry.
- Too little, too late.

573
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:14,435
OK. I'II... I'll tell everyone
that I was wrong.

574
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:17,207
That your kids aren't the ones.

575
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:19,874
Please. I'm begging you.

576
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:25,121
Well, why are you standing there?
Get to it.

577
00:40:38,302 --> 00:40:40,236
- Bree, hi.
- Hi.

578
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:42,168
What's up?

579
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:45,640
Well, um...
I've been doing some thinking.

580
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:49,371
Rex and I have been members
of the Fairview Country Club for years

581
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:53,144
and lately it seems
to have lost some of its exclusivity.

582
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:56,209
And so, I've decided
not to renew our membership.

583
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:59,779
I'd rather see the money
go to someone I care about.

584
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:11,897
Oh, Bree, I... I can't take that.

585
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,369
Gaby, this is the way I see it.

586
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:17,737
Good friends offer to help in a crisis.

587
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:23,007
Great friends
don't take no for an answer.

588
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:35,751
We're gonna pay you back every cent.
I promise.

589
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,623
Take your time.

590
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:48,404
[Mary Alice]
Yes, everyone loves a scandal,

591
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:51,566
no matter how big or small.

592
00:41:55,913 --> 00:41:58,814
After all,
what could be more entertaining

593
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:01,817
than watching the downfall
of the high and mighty?

594
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:08,452
What could be more amusing

595
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:12,257
than the public exposure
of hypocritical sinners?

596
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:18,464
Yes, everyone loves a scandal.

597
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:22,005
And if for some reason
you're not enjoying the latest one...

598
00:42:25,943 --> 00:42:29,902
well, the next one

599
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:33,074
is always around the corner.
