1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,580
<i>Previously on...

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:04,460
<i>With Mike working in Alaska,

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:06,430
<i>Susan took a job as a nanny.

4
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:09,110
<i>Bree's relationship with Keith's mother...

5
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:12,110
Is Bree the one who's gonna
be giving me my grandchildren?

6
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:14,050
<i>Got off to a rocky start.

7
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,780
<i>That was a million years ago.

8
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,910
<i>Tom and Renee had a secret.

9
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,110
She can never know what happened between us.

10
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:22,410
<i>Paul's wife had a change of heart...

11
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,780
I wanna make love again.

12
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,350
<i>And a very big secret of her own.

13
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:27,590
Baby.

14
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:28,500
Mama.

15
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,780
<i>Felicia Tillman knew many things.

16
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:43,370
<i>She knew Paul Young had killed her sister.

17
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:48,780
<i>She knew she had to find proof.

18
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,790
<i>And she knew she would need help.

19
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:00,590
<i>Felicia also knew she was
lucky to have a daughter

20
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,370
<i>who did what she was told.

21
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:07,670
He's said nothing to you?

22
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,340
You've been living there for months now.

23
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,710
Well, I've tried to ask him questions,

24
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,870
but he refuses to discuss aunt Martha.

25
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,230
Did you look through his things?

26
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,250
- Maybe he has some sort of journal.
- Well, I've looked some.

27
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,180
Look again.

28
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,400
Is he still bothering you for sex?

29
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:26,780
N-not really.

30
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,070
I'm surprised.

31
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,780
He seems like the type who
wouldn't take no for an answer.

32
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,360
You slept with him, didn't you?

33
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,680
Beth!

34
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,980
He was going to kick me out.
I had to do something.

35
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,320
Oh, please don't be angry.

36
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,650
We always knew

37
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:54,950
getting justice for aunt Martha
would require sacrifices.

38
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,800
But this...

39
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:05,040
I allowed my own daughter
to be defiled by that man.

40
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,160
It wasn't that bad, mama.

41
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:12,050
Are you saying you enjoyed it?

42
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,480
No! Of course not.

43
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:19,000
It just wasn't as unpleasant
as I thought it... would be.

44
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:24,250
Well, if you've got the stomach for it...

45
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,980
this could work to our advantage.

46
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,270
Well, what do you mean?

47
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,590
Sex makes men stupid.

48
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,660
They say things in the dark

49
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,750
they can barely remember come sunrise.

50
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,890
You want me to ask
about aunt Martha's murder

51
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:40,820
in the middle of...

52
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,920
I'm not saying use it as foreplay.

53
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:47,640
But afterwards,
when you're both just lying there,

54
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,510
when he's...

55
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,930
spent...

56
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,540
get him talking about the past.

57
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,450
Maybe he'll let some detail slip,

58
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,810
something we can use, okay?

59
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:01,690
I'll try, mama. I should go.

60
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:02,530
And, Beth?

61
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,660
Sex makes women stupid, too.

62
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,950
They start feeling things that

63
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,850
they have no business feeling.

64
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,980
Do you understand?

65
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,890
I do, mama.

66
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:28,210
<i>Yes, Felicia Tillman knew many things,

67
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,870
<i>and if her daughter were stupid enough

68
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,030
<i>to fall in love with Paul Young,

69
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:39,650
<i>Felicia knew she would have
to punish them both.

70
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:55,330
<i>Thanksgiving... it's a time
for defrosting turkeys...

71
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,870
<i>for visiting families...

72
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,330
<i>for performing in pageants.

73
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:07,190
<i>Thanksgiving is also a time for shopping...

74
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,440
Well, don't just sit there
scratching yourself. Help me.

75
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,170
<i>And stress.

76
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,910
Frijoles, tamales?

77
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,200
Babe, I think you got the wrong bags.

78
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,500
Where are the yams and the cranberry sauce?

79
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,550
Hector and Carmen have a big mexican dinner

80
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,650
every Thanksgiving.

81
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,620
Since we invited them over,

82
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,960
I told them I'd serve
their favorite dishes, like...

83
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,770
chorizo stuffing, bollitos,

84
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,150
Jalapeno corn bread.

85
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,740
I thought it'd be nice for Grace.

86
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,560
It's our first holiday
we're together as a family.

87
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,750
That was very sweet of you.

88
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,250
Yeah. So good luck. We eat at 2:00.

89
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:42,080
Wait, wait.

90
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,540
I'm cooking?

91
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,380
Yeah. You're the one
who knows about mexican stuff.

92
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,320
You roll your R's, you call soccer football...

93
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,350
You're mocking me because
I'm proud of my culture?

94
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,210
No! I'm celebrating it.

95
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,140
And there's two bags
of your culture right there.

96
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,160
Start the party.

97
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,560
So, Lynette. Hi.

98
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,480
What are your plans for Thanksgiving?

99
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,460
Same as always...
cook by myself for four hours,

100
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,790
clean by myself for three hours,

101
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,350
eat with my family for eight minutes.

102
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:13,270
- Well, this year, how about coming to...
- We're in.

103
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,850
I haven't even invited you yet.

104
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,400
You can invite me over
for turkey and a punch in the face.

105
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,550
- If it gets me out of cooking, I'm there.
- Oh. Wonderful.

106
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,990
Oh. Wait. Susan was
already coming to our place.

107
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,410
Is it okay if she comes, too?

108
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,500
Well, I suppose she'll want overtime,

109
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,880
but I could use the extra kitchen help.

110
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,150
As a guest.

111
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:35,880
Oh, come on.

112
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,040
What have you got against Susan?

113
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,880
She's always so perky and poor.

114
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,710
It's an annoying combination.

115
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,920
She's my friend, and it is Thanksgiving.

116
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,920
I suppose it is a time to be thankful...

117
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,060
and I'm thankful I'm not her.

118
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,010
Oh, what the hell. She can come.

119
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,230
There's been a change of plans.

120
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:06,230
We're all having Thanksgiving
over at Renee's. You, too.

121
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,210
She's okay with me and M.J. coming?

122
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,880
Of course. You know how she loves children.

123
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,680
Yeah. Medium rare.

124
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,450
What are we doing?

125
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,160
Oh, I'm trying to get Paige to sleep,

126
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,120
and if I stop...

127
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,220
that happens.

128
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,660
I figure 12 more laps, and she'll be asleep,

129
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,160
and then I can put her down.

130
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,630
You know what?

131
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,360
I'm thinking it's about
time we sleep-trained her.

132
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,500
Sleep train?

133
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,680
Yeah, yeah. Here. You put 'em in their crib,

134
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:39,250
and essentially,
you let 'em cry it out. Come on.

135
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,470
Yeah, I know what it is.

136
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,310
I just never really got the point of it.

137
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,930
The point is she learns
to put herself to sleep.

138
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,110
The first night she cries for 20 minutes,

139
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:51,290
the second, ten.
Before long, everyone's happy.

140
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,070
Except the lonely little person

141
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,800
who was crying and
now thinks she was abandoned.

142
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,850
I know it sounds harsh,

143
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,770
but it's really a gift
you're giving the child.

144
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,600
The gift of a tear-stained pillow.

145
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,260
What a lucky little girl.

146
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:17,570
Something wrong?

147
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:20,850
No.

148
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:23,770
You sure?

149
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,030
You seem like you were a million miles away

150
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,210
while we were making love.

151
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:30,840
Well...

152
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,100
it's just that...

153
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:35,880
Talk to me.

154
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:41,670
I met a woman today a-at the store,

155
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,830
and when I told her who I was married to...

156
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,040
she said you killed Martha Huber.

157
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,380
What have I told you about idle gossip?

158
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:53,450
She said you had a motive.

159
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,460
Martha was blackmailing your wife.

160
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,570
This is ridiculous.

161
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,320
You are a passionate man.

162
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,470
I know that firsthand,

163
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:09,330
but sometimes our emotions
can make us do crazy things.

164
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:12,750
If Martha was responsible
for Mary Alice's suicide...

165
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,440
Stop it.

166
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,560
Do you honestly believe that I am capable

167
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,950
of killing another person?

168
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,610
Martha's sister sure thinks you are.

169
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:24,010
- Well, her opinion doesn't matter.
- Why not?

170
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:26,590
Everybody knows Felicia Tillman is crazy.

171
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,390
Martha said to my wife

172
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,800
that she couldn't trust
a thing that her sister said

173
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:36,530
due to her severe mental problems.

174
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:38,890
Really?

175
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,200
You're surprised?

176
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:42,910
The woman cut off her own fingers

177
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,120
to frame me for murder.

178
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,010
Who does that?

179
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,650
That's a good point.

180
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,680
Bree?

181
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,470
I brought these so if you saw me coming,

182
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,370
you wouldn't shoot me.

183
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,560
Uh, Keith told me you have guns?

184
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,730
Thank you for letting me off the hook.

185
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,850
In my defense, I'm an ugly drunk.

186
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,360
Well, you found out your son was dating

187
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,990
a slightly older woman.

188
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,690
Of course you were thrown off balance.

189
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,810
It wasn't just that.

190
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:32,370
I, uh, I've been going
through some stuff lately.

191
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,470
Oh. Is, uh, everything okay?

192
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,650
Ever since Richard retired from the army,

193
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:41,270
things have been... strained.

194
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:44,020
Well, there's always a period of adjustment.

195
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,170
It's more than that.

196
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,780
He was always thousands of miles away.

197
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:50,190
We got so good at being apart,
we forgot how to be together.

198
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,560
Well, have you discussed this with him?

199
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,970
I want to, but every time we talk,

200
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,040
it turns into a fight.

201
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,210
Trying to pick a movie friday night...

202
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:00,590
that-that turned into
a 3-hour screaming match.

203
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,690
Well, holding it inside isn't the solution.

204
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,420
You need to tell him how you feel.

205
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,100
Trust me. You'll be glad you did.

206
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,920
Well, it's just so much easier
when Keith is around.

207
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,960
He's the one thing we agree on.

208
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,100
I mean, I'm glad you two
are spending Thanksgiving together,

209
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,530
but we're sure gonna miss him at our table.

210
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,740
Hmm. Hey, why don't you join us?

211
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,150
Oh, oh, no. No, no, no. No.

212
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,550
I-I wasn't fishing for an invitation.

213
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,640
I know you weren't.
We would love to have you.

214
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:28,950
You are so sweet,

215
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:32,240
and I promise to be on my best behavior.

216
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,740
I know you will, because as Keith told you,

217
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,290
I have guns.

218
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,390
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

219
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,170
I was trying to get Mike on the phone,

220
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:46,550
but between the time change
and his schedule,

221
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:49,200
- we weren't able to connect.
- Aw, that's too bad.

222
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,030
I just put Paige down for a nap.
Come. Have some iced tea.

223
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,200
Maybe you can try Mike tonight after work.

224
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,060
Maybe.

225
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,580
Wow. She sounds really unhappy.

226
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:10,040
Shouldn't we do something about that?

227
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:11,920
You're right.

228
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,980
So... what's the weather like in Alaska

229
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:16,820
this time of the year?

230
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:19,960
Cold.

231
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:26,090
Good tea.

232
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,780
Really, really good tea.

233
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,570
Although it could use some lemon.

234
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:32,960
Um, I'll be right back.

235
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,730
Susan.

236
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,560
We stopped keeping lemons
under the baby a while ago.

237
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,960
I'm sorry. I couldn't take it.

238
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:53,710
Look, it's not fun for me
to hear Paige cry either,

239
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:56,400
but in the long run,
it's going to be better for her.

240
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:59,720
It's not better for me.
I tried letting her cry yesterday.

241
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:02,300
It was too upsetting.
Look at my nails. They're gone.

242
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,690
I hate to say it because you're my friend,

243
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,100
but this is your job.
I need you to do it my way.

244
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,790
- I get it. You're the boss. The mean, cold...
- Susan.

245
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,760
Sorry.

246
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,270
Unfeeling boss.

247
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,660
Oh, I thought you were the cable guy.

248
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:29,610
I'm trying to get free premium channels.

249
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,830
No, no, just me.

250
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,370
Lynette wanted me to bring
this over for thursday.

251
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:35,240
She didn't think it'd stand
a chance at our place.

252
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,170
Okay. Bye.

253
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:40,720
Uh, Tom?

254
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,220
Oh. Oh, oh, right. Here.

255
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,690
Do you mind putting that in the kitchen?

256
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:51,140
My hands are kinda...

257
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,350
Sure. Sure.

258
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:57,370
So... here you go.

259
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,610
Chocolate cream thigh... p-pie.

260
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,060
I said "pie."

261
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,950
Are you blushing?

262
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,790
Tom, you've seen it before.

263
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:10,970
I seem to remember you caught me
in a towel then, too.

264
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,670
Well, you probably don't even remember.

265
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,770
Blue towel, white stripes,
Coney Island beach club.

266
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:21,570
I-it was a good towel.

267
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,230
Uh, Tom.

268
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:26,790
What do you think?

269
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,870
What?

270
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,830
Oh, relax. I'm not hitting on you.

271
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:33,680
It's just...

272
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:37,740
Well, come on. I'm divorced. I'm vulnerable.

273
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,630
I'll take my compliments where I can.

274
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,340
I know it's been over 20 years,
but how do I look?

275
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,150
You look incredible.

276
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,150
I gotta go.

277
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,390
Table.

278
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,310
Oh, that reminds me.

279
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,530
I invited your parents
to Thanksgiving dinner.

280
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:18,240
What about the last ten minutes
reminded you of my parents?

281
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:21,150
I was working up the menu in my head.

282
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,240
So when you were moaning...

283
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,510
I thought of a new recipe

284
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,820
for chestnut stuffing with pancetta.

285
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,630
That does sound good.

286
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,490
Ah. I wish it was just you
and me for Thanksgiving.

287
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:37,990
I had a whole night planned.

288
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,990
Well, how about we do something
special next weekend?

289
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:42,420
Just you and me?

290
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,180
Yes. We'll go someplace romantic,

291
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:47,020
and I will plan the whole thing.

292
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,250
Great.

293
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,200
Just don't do it while we're making love.

294
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,610
I am famished. How about
I rummage around in your kitchen

295
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,200
- and find us something to eat?
- Mm.

296
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,130
Hey! Look who's here.

297
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,380
Happy Thanksgiving.

298
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:29,660
Hey, happy Thanksgiving.

299
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,250
Ay, it all smells so wonderful.

300
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,960
Well, Carlos and I have been working
our butts off all day.

301
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:35,300
She did her hair for two hours

302
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,290
- and told me where the can opener was.
- Who set the table?

303
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:40,250
- Juanita.
- Under my supervision.

304
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,510
- Well, we're happy to be here.
- Si.

305
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,610
Grace, sweetie, you wanna go up
and play with Juanita and Celia

306
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:49,970
- before we eat?
- Yeah.

307
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,830
So who wants a drink?

308
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,600
I made margaritas.

309
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,680
She is very proud of her culture.

310
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:02,320
Hey. Carlos, what's spanish for
"No sex for a month"?

311
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,220
Ah, Carmen knows.

312
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:07,930
So, Gaby, what'd you do with the pies?

313
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,250
What?

314
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,760
I kinda forgot to pick 'em up.

315
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:17,640
I cooked this entire meal,
and you forget dessert?

316
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,950
You had one thing to do.

317
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,650
It was your whole
"Where's the can opener?" thing.

318
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:22,650
- It just threw me.
- Well,

319
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,750
go throw yourself
in the car and get the pies.

320
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,230
I can't drive. I just had a glass of wine.

321
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,790
We'll just have something else for dessert.

322
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,430
I think I have some
leftover halloween candy...

323
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,330
And pudding mix. Who doesn't love pudding?

324
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:37,250
Gaby... get the pies.

325
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,750
Uh... I can drive you.

326
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,720
Thank you, Hector.

327
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:46,940
Oh, fine. Let's go get your precious pies.

328
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:51,270
And lose the attitude.
This is your screwup, not mine.

329
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,240
Carlos, what's spanish

330
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,090
for "You're sleeping on the couch tonight"?

331
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,710
Carmen's got that one, too.

332
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,390
She...

333
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,470
Hey, Renee.

334
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,990
Happy, happy Thanksgiving.

335
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:09,330
Okay, you live in an apartment.
Take it down a notch.

336
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,750
Oh. Hello, M.J.

337
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,200
M.J., what do you say to Mrs. Perry?

338
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,480
She needs medication?

339
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,410
That's what we say about her.

340
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:26,510
- What do we say to her?
- Thank you for having us.

341
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:28,740
Precious.

342
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:32,220
What's this chalk line?

343
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,530
No kids beyond this point.

344
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,480
Your mommy can bring your food to you.

345
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:41,500
Seriously? The kids' table's
in the driveway?

346
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,810
I put it in the street,
but the cops made me move it.

347
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,190
Hey, happy Thanksgiving.

348
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,660
Oh. Where's my little Paige?

349
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:51,610
Oh, we are trying to keep
her on her sleep schedule,

350
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:53,290
so Porter and Preston are watching her.

351
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,680
But don't worry, Susan.
I told them if she cries,

352
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,360
they can pick her up after 20 minutes.

353
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,410
20 minutes. You're up to 20 minutes now.

354
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,730
If they even hear her
over the football game.

355
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,340
What?

356
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,290
Happy Thanksgiving.

357
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,100
What?

358
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,240
Told you she forgot. Let's go.

359
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:20,620
No. No. Remember how awful
you felt when you found out

360
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,520
Roy and I spent last Thanksgiving

361
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,640
at Pancake Castle and
you invited us to your house

362
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,730
for the next year?

363
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:28,560
It's next year.

364
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,770
I'm... sorry. It slipped my mind.

365
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:34,810
Well, that's okay.
We can go back to Pancake Castle.

366
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:35,920
No, we can't.

367
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,870
The board of health shut 'em down.

368
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,300
Those weren't blueberries.

369
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:42,380
Wait, wait, wait.

370
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,260
Of course you're welcome to eat with us.

371
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:48,960
- Well, thank you, Bree.
- Hey. We're here.

372
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:52,830
Oh, look. Invited guests.
We'll get out of the way.

373
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,220
- Keith.
- Happy Thanksgiving.

374
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,330
Richard, Mary.

375
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,700
They were honking at you
because you were driving slow

376
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,850
in the fast lane.

377
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,760
No. I was driving
the legal speed limit in the left lane.

378
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,410
Otherwise known as the fast lane. Hi.

379
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,450
Happy Thanksgiving.
We'd have been here sooner,

380
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:09,320
- but, uh...
- Drop it, Richard.

381
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,290
Come on. Move!

382
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,140
I think it's an accident.

383
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,560
Well, they better be dead.

384
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,200
The bakery closes in ten minutes.

385
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,660
Maybe we should just forget the pies.

386
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:32,350
Are you crazy? If I show up empty-handed,

387
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,890
Carlos will go all Ricky Ricardo on my ass.

388
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,330
Take the shoulder.

389
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,300
What?

390
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:43,740
It's totally clear,
and we can pass by this whole mess.

391
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,740
Gaby, it's against the law.

392
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,050
Hector, I am sweating in a pickup,

393
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:50,730
and my buzz is wearing off.
You do not wanna tangle with me.

394
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:51,740
Punch it!

395
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,610
Maybe he didn't see us.

396
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,050
Sir...

397
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:13,630
You do realize that the shoulder
is used just for emergencies?

398
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,900
Officer, hi. Are we glad to see you.

399
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:18,480
We could really use
a police escort to the bakery.

400
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,190
It closes in ten minutes.

401
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,350
That's not an emergency, ma'am.

402
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:26,500
"Ma'am"? Ow. Talk about police brutality.

403
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:28,990
License and registration, please.

404
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:31,040
I-I have the registration.

405
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,870
And do you have a driver's license?

406
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,209
Sir... are you a citizen
of the united states?

407
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,539
Hey! Racist much?

408
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:49,099
Just because he's got dark skin
and drives a clunker

409
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,899
and has a coat hanger for an antenna

410
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,299
doesn't make him illegal.

411
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,219
Gaby, please!

412
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,069
He has rights. He pays taxes.

413
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:58,349
We're getting your name,
officer... Martinez.

414
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,300
Damn!

415
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:02,670
Just give him your license
so we can get outta here.

416
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:09,070
Hector?

417
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,019
Sir, step out of the vehicle

418
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,830
and put your hands on the car, please.

419
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,010
Hector.

420
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,020
Isn't that your truck?

421
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:36,120
Why is it moving like that?

422
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:42,030
Where's my husband?

423
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,040
Where's the pie?

424
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,949
Gaby, what happened?

425
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:47,289
Please don't yell at me.

426
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:49,249
That was my first time driving stick shift,

427
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,689
- and my nerves are shattered.
- Well, where's Hector?

428
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:54,039
- He got arrested.
- Arrested? Why?

429
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,429
Well, traffic was awful,
and the bakery was closing,

430
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:59,119
so Hector... a-and I begged him not to,

431
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,930
drove up on the shoulder,
and the police caught us.

432
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,790
Police?

433
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:08,359
- Grace, get in the truck now.
- But we haven't eaten yet.

434
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,240
I don't care. Let's go! Where's my purse?

435
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:13,759
What the hell is going on?

436
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,520
I think they're illegals.

437
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:17,039
Are they gonna deport Hector?

438
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,169
I don't know. They just took him
and left me in a car

439
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,609
- that I don't know how to drive.
- Okay, Carmen, wait.

440
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:23,589
We can get your husband out of this.
We'll hire a lawyer.

441
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:26,339
They will have him on a bus
back to Mexico by tomorrow.

442
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,799
I have to move out of our house

443
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,709
- before they track down our address.
- Where are you going?!

444
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:32,959
I have relatives in Texas.
We'll stay with them

445
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,899
until I can think of what to do next.

446
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,400
But what about Grace?
When will I see her again?

447
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:39,360
I don't know.

448
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:42,230
Say good-bye, Grace.

449
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,580
Good-bye, Gaby.

450
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,709
Hey, kids, I put some snacks on the table.

451
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,369
Mrs. Perry slapped the caterer,

452
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:00,300
so dinner's gonna be a little late.

453
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,690
Do you hear crying?

454
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:04,890
Maybe it's the caterer.

455
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,609
No, I think it's Paige.

456
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:09,520
Oh, yeah. She's been crying for a long time.

457
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:11,600
She has?

458
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,600
Who wants to play some football?

459
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,000
Okay. Go long, go long.

460
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,879
Oops! That's my bad!

461
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,320
I'll get it!

462
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,620
Oh! Look! Ha! Did it again.

463
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,630
I'll get it!

464
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:55,560
- Let's go, boys. Come on!
- 3rd and 6. You gotta throw it.

465
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:57,750
Oh, he's not gonna.

466
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,670
Come on! Throw the ball!

467
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,890
Ohh!

468
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:06,839
Ugh. It's like they're trying to lose.

469
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,099
Now 3rd and 16 from the 16
to give to Blake on the draw,

470
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,649
And Blake is hammered
at the line for no gain.

471
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:14,800
- Ohh!
- Come on!

472
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:18,609
So, uh, Richard, tell us,

473
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:20,610
what are your plans for retirement?

474
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,460
We're, uh, we're still discussing that.

475
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:28,100
He wants to sail down the coast
of south America by himself.

476
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:31,979
Bree, this cranberry sauce is delicious.
What is your secret?

477
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,559
- Well...
- Might I remind you,

478
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,299
the plan was always for us

479
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,730
- to sail down the coast of south America.
- Oh.

480
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:41,440
Please tell us that secret, Bree.
I'd love to hear it.

481
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:43,430
Is it cinnamon?

482
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:48,180
If it isn't, can we talk about cinnamon?

483
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:52,090
I knew a stripper
in Baltimore named cinnamon.

484
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,500
Nice broad.

485
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,100
You changed the plan.

486
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:57,489
You were the one that said
you wanted to keep working.

487
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:59,959
Well, I'm sorry if I built up
a successful practice

488
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,629
- while you were traipsing around the world.
- Traipsing?

489
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:05,019
- Yes.
- Like when I traipsed through Iraq.

490
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,750
Iraq! My goodness. What was that like?

491
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,530
When I think about it now,
doesn't seem so bad.

492
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:18,589
So... Richard,
we know that you like sailing.

493
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,759
What about you, Mary?
Do you have any hobbies?

494
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,010
Ask him.

495
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,340
Excuse me?

496
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:25,209
He has known me for 35 years.

497
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:28,590
I'd be curious if he could name
even one thing I like to do.

498
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,540
Um...

499
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,000
Bitch?

500
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:38,819
No. The stripper's name was ginger.

501
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:42,110
Cinnamon was her sister. Killed by a cab.

502
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,279
You're not happy unless you have
something to complain about.

503
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,859
Dad, mom. Come on. You're guests here.

504
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:50,539
Why do I even bother?
It's like talking to a wall.

505
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,009
A wall that paid for your medical school

506
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:55,079
after your homemade wooden
puzzle business went belly-up.

507
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,679
And everything you ever did was a success?

508
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,680
Iraq? Nice job!

509
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,639
I caught some shrapnel in Korea.

510
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,110
Came this close to being a lady.

511
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:11,009
See, Bree? This is just
what we talked about.

512
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:13,219
You-you talked to my mother?

513
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,619
Bree said I should tell you how I feel.

514
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:19,430
Well, here is how I feel. I want a divorce.

515
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:23,010
- What?
- Thank you, Bree. I do feel better.

516
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,569
You told my mom to get a divorce?

517
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:26,869
I never said "divorce."

518
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:30,619
You want out of this?
Fine! I'm happy to oblige!

519
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,820
Dad! Mom, wait!

520
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:39,320
And you didn't wanna come.

521
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:49,360
I love the stuffing.

522
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,119
Are you sure? Not too dry?

523
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,999
No. It's yummy. Hmm.

524
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,779
Did you use pecans?

525
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,759
Yes. It's my mother's recipe.

526
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,019
It's probably a lot different
from the stuffing

527
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,380
you had as a kid.

528
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:06,790
Actually, mama and I didn't
really celebrate Thanksgiving.

529
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:08,300
What?

530
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:11,140
Daddy left when I was very young.

531
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,879
After that, mama said

532
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,960
we didn't have anything to be thankful for.

533
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,079
So you never had people over?

534
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,649
No. It was always just...

535
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:23,110
mama and me.

536
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,060
That's too bad.

537
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,389
When I was 12, I did ask mama

538
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:33,570
if I could have a friend
from school to eat with us.

539
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,550
Danny Sullivan.

540
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,419
I didn't tell her I'd invited a boy

541
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,390
until Thanksgiving morning.

542
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:43,659
Well, what happened?

543
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,620
She started screaming at me...

544
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:50,080
saying boys were only after one thing.

545
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:53,810
When he showed up and knocked on the door,

546
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,630
she wouldn't let me answer it.

547
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,369
We just... sat there and ate

548
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:04,380
while he knocked and... knocked.

549
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,300
Finally, it stopped.

550
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:14,600
Your mother sounds like
a very unhappy woman.

551
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,980
I didn't notice it
so much when I was a child.

552
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:23,070
But now I'm starting to realize just how...

553
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:25,300
damaged she is.

554
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,310
Is that why you never introduced us?

555
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:33,140
I just never thought you two
would have much in common.

556
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,650
I can think of one thing.

557
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:39,570
We both love you.

558
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:47,779
You know, I think it's good
I waited this long

559
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,680
to have a real Thanksgiving.

560
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,460
Why's that?

561
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:55,500
Because now I actually have
something to be thankful for.

562
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,970
Hey, guys.

563
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,969
I brought you some turkey.

564
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:06,379
Can I have some?

565
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,879
Well, sure, but... where's your mom?

566
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,789
I thought you guys were throwing
the football around.

567
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,870
I haven't seen her since
she kicked it down to your house.

568
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:17,039
And how long ago was that?

569
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:20,600
A while ago, before the baby stopped crying.

570
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:26,319
And 1:35 left here in the 2nd.

571
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,900
... at their own 42-yard line,
trailing 21 to 3.

572
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:40,269
Hey, guys, how's it goin'?

573
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,889
Uh, Dallas is losing.

574
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:43,159
Where's the baby?

575
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,710
- They have no passing game.
- Guys!

576
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:48,870
Susan?

577
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:09,430
Ahh. Well, now I'm not suspicious at all.

578
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,900
Come on, Susan!

579
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,580
Aah! Oh!

580
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:21,239
God, you scared me.

581
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,490
You... stay right there. Guys?

582
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:25,240
Hey.

583
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:28,579
Will you watch the game upstairs?

584
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,000
I need to talk to Susan.

585
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:33,750
- When did Susan get here?
- Beats me.

586
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:37,849
What the hell?

587
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:40,309
I could hear her crying four houses away.

588
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:42,829
Yes. And last night, she cried just as loud,

589
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,869
but two minutes later,
she put herself to sleep.

590
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:48,469
She was self-soothing.
The system was working.

591
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:51,580
I don't care. I think it's
a crappy system for lazy moms.

592
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:56,049
Lazy moms? Who are you to talk?

593
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:59,179
You have one kid every... 18 years.

594
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,859
Me... I've got five in the
house at the same time.

595
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:05,459
It's a war. So if I need
to put my baby on a schedule

596
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:08,179
to stop my life
from spiraling out of control,

597
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,860
that's what I'm gonna do.

598
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:13,479
Well... you're gonna have to do it alone,

599
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,920
'cause I quit.

600
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:19,110
Whoa. Hold on. Isn't that a little extreme?

601
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,319
Lynette, I'm sorry.

602
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:24,920
I cannot stand by and
listen to that baby cry.

603
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,779
Even for five minutes?

604
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:30,040
Even for one minute.
It's more than I can handle.

605
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,469
I listen to M.J. crying himself to sleep

606
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:36,610
every night... because he misses his dad.

607
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:41,210
I cry myself to sleep
because my kid is crying.

608
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:45,500
There's just too much crying
in my life. I can't take it.

609
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:50,809
Oh, sweetie. Shh. I'm so sorry.

610
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:52,300
I had no idea.

611
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,659
I'm sorry to dump all this on you.

612
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:58,040
I have been emotional all day.

613
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:01,690
God...

614
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:04,280
It's Thanksgiving, and I...

615
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:06,800
I haven't even gotten to speak to Mike.

616
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,399
You wanna call him? You can use my phone.

617
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,110
Talk as long as you like.

618
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:16,630
Are you sure? It... it's expensive.

619
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:20,399
Well... it's either talking to your husband

620
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,960
or self-soothing,

621
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,280
and I know how much you love that.

622
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:35,370
Oh! Thank god you haven't left.

623
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,169
What are you doing here?

624
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:38,159
You don't have to leave.

625
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,009
Carlos and I hired our friend Bob.

626
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:42,069
He's a lawyer. He'll find a way to help you.

627
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:44,489
How? We're breaking the law.

628
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:47,089
Well, at least talk to him.
You can't just pack up and go.

629
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:50,820
We always knew this day might come.
This was the plan.

630
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,030
I'm sticking to it.

631
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,690
Carmen, we should talk about this.

632
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,720
Hi, Gaby.

633
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:04,740
Mama, am I supposed to pack
all my clothes and books?

634
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:08,570
Uh, just your favorite things,
mija, for a nice, long visit.

635
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:12,330
I'm going to meet my cousins.

636
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:14,230
I heard.

637
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:22,069
Look, Carmen, I know you're a proud woman,

638
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:24,039
but you have to let us help you.

639
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,889
We're family. I'm afraid if I let you go,

640
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:28,700
I'll never see Grace again.

641
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,280
And you might not see Juanita.

642
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:38,079
Stay with us until we can figure things out.

643
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,770
They'll never look for you there.

644
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:42,249
At the very least,

645
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:45,460
we can have a few more days with the girls.

646
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,250
Please.

647
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,050
I'm not ready to say good-bye yet.

648
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:09,910
- Top you off?
- Thanks. I'm good.

649
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,480
Where the heck did Lynette go?

650
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:27,680
She can't be that far.

651
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,039
So the house looks great.

652
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,060
Thanks.

653
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,520
You like living here?

654
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:41,090
Uh, yeah. Sure.

655
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:47,000
That didn't sound very convincing.

656
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,459
Well, it's nothing against Fairview.

657
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:53,380
It's just... I'm surrounded
by couples and married people.

658
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,530
And I'm alone.

659
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:58,490
Would you believe for the first time?

660
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:05,510
Well, if I know you, that's not gonna last.

661
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:06,900
I don't know.

662
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:09,769
You know, people used to say
I was a beautiful woman.

663
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:13,980
Now they say I'm a beautiful woman
for my age.

664
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,570
Please.

665
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:18,040
I just saw you in a towel.

666
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,720
Did you get your premium channels?

667
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:24,090
I did...

668
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:27,280
and high-speed internet.

669
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,910
There you go.

670
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:32,730
Mmm.

671
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,189
Oh, you know, there was a time

672
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:39,610
where I could have any man I wanted,

673
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:42,570
and... I did.

674
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:47,460
But I did not choose wisely.

675
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:50,450
I went for the rich guys, the famous guys,

676
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:53,210
the ones who bought me pretty things.

677
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:59,160
I should've been looking for
a man who was kind and gentle,

678
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:03,880
the kind of man you'd actually
wanna raise a family with.

679
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:11,700
I gotta hand it to Lynette.
She sure knows how to pick 'em.

680
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,720
Ohh.

681
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:23,590
Hmm. What are you guys talking about?

682
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:25,130
Well...

683
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,080
You, actually.

684
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,720
I hope it was complimentary.

685
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:33,070
Uh, very.

686
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,920
- Hey.
- Come on in.

687
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,969
My dad's here. He's in the other room.

688
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:46,740
Oh. How's he doing?

689
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:50,070
Weirdly okay.

690
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,920
And how about you?

691
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:55,360
Freaked out.

692
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,909
Guess it doesn't matter if you're 4 or 34

693
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:03,009
when your mom and dad
aren't together anymore.

694
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:05,240
It's horrible, I know.

695
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,190
You know what's ironic?

696
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,129
Thanksgiving, big family holiday.

697
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:10,199
That's the day I start thinking

698
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,010
there's no point in being married.

699
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:16,240
- You can't think like that.
- Why not?

700
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:18,829
They were married for 35 years.

701
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:21,239
If it could fall apart that quickly...

702
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,570
It didn't.

703
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:25,969
It's been a long time coming, Keith

704
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:28,069
you just haven't been around to see it.

705
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:29,990
Hmm. Like that would have made it easier.

706
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:35,679
Son, all I'm saying is try not
to be cynical about marriage.

707
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,340
Really? 'cause I see a lot of
divorced people in this room.

708
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,209
Sorry.

709
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:45,169
No. You're right. I'm divorced.

710
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:47,609
But I will never give up on marriage.

711
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:50,710
Because when it works, it's great.

712
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,060
And I still believe
it could happen again for me.

713
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:58,569
And I cannot believe I just said
that to my boyfriend

714
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,440
in front of his father.

715
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,560
You wanna take a walk?

716
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:09,759
Maybe I can salvage one
nice Thanksgiving memory

717
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,849
out of this day?

718
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:11,950
I'd love to.

719
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:13,830
All right. I'll get my coat.

720
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:23,460
I hope he's gonna be okay.

721
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,689
Well, it'll take some time,

722
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:27,600
but I promise I'll help him through it.

723
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:31,110
Keith's a lucky guy to have you.

724
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,650
Thank you.

725
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:37,980
I knew you were special
from the moment I met you.

726
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,020
You ready to go?

727
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,090
All set.

728
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,240
How's it going? What have you found out?

729
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,580
Nothing.

730
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,110
He still insists he didn't do it.

731
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:05,270
Clearly, it's too soon.

732
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:07,830
You haven't gained his trust yet.

733
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,540
You know what you should do?

734
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,809
Join some wine-of-the-month club.

735
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:17,979
Start getting him drunk on a regular basis.

736
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,330
Maybe he'll let something slip.

737
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:23,610
What's wrong?

738
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:26,950
Mama...

739
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:31,260
have you ever considered
the possibility that...

740
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,060
That what?

741
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,810
That Paul didn't kill aunt Martha.

742
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:38,830
No.

743
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,240
Have you?

744
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:44,670
Well...

745
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:47,570
no one actually saw him do it.

746
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:49,490
Oh, my god.

747
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:51,909
He swears he didn't kill her.

748
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:53,400
And you believe him.

749
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,769
I want you out of that house.

750
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:01,859
Mama. You will leave here, get your things,

751
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:04,729
and get out of that house today.

752
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:05,749
I can't.

753
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:06,850
Why not?

754
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,039
He's my husband.

755
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,050
What?

756
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:13,270
He's nice to me.

757
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,050
Who cares?!

758
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,179
He's a cold-blooded killer!

759
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,619
Mama, the guards.

760
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:22,589
I didn't raise you to be this stupid!

761
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:23,349
Sit down,

762
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:26,149
- or your visit's over.
- Don't touch me!

763
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:29,550
- Mama!
- I will not allow you

764
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:32,779
to fall in love with a monster!

765
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,780
Do you hear me?!

766
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:37,450
Beth!

767
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:43,279
Mom, we want breakfast.

768
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,960
Okay, I'll be there in a second.

769
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:48,859
Bob, there has got to be some way

770
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:50,279
we can get Hector his papers.

771
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,469
Isn't there somebody that
we can throw money at?

772
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:56,849
Guys, it's too late for Hector,
and as long as Carmen is here,

773
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:59,040
she runs the risk of being deported, too.

774
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,420
She either turns herself in, or...

775
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:03,520
I have to disappear.

776
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:08,969
You said Carmen's at risk. What about Grace?

777
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:11,770
She was born here.
She's an american citizen.

778
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:13,870
Oh.

779
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:17,620
Mom!

780
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:19,870
I should go.

781
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:28,560
Wow. This is great. Waffles are my favorite.

782
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,400
Good. You can have them anytime you want.

783
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:36,070
Really? Wow. I wish
I could live here all the time.

784
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,730
Well, you never know.

785
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,950
There might be a way
we can make that happen.

786
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:49,529
<i>Once a year,

787
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:53,200
<i>we remember to stop and count our blessings.

788
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:58,450
<i>We give thanks for
the friends who understand us...

789
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:03,510
<i>the lovers who make us happy...

790
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:09,570
<i>the children who do our bidding...

791
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:17,300
<i>Yes, we must always be thankful
for what we've been given...

792
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:22,390
<i>even if it's just an opportunity.
