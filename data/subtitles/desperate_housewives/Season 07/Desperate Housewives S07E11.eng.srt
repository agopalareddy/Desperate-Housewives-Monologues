1
00:00:00,505 --> 00:00:02,337
Previously on
Desperate Housewives...

2
00:00:02,338 --> 00:00:05,287
Will you do me the honor
of moving in with me?

3
00:00:05,493 --> 00:00:07,347
Proposals were made.

4
00:00:07,348 --> 00:00:10,331
I think starting an interior
design business is...

5
00:00:10,332 --> 00:00:11,388
It's genius.

6
00:00:11,389 --> 00:00:15,477
Juanita learned the truth.
You're not my mommy.

7
00:00:16,174 --> 00:00:19,038
She told me about this guy
that she had a fling with.

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,413
Susan revealed she knew a secret.

9
00:00:21,414 --> 00:00:23,164
His name was Tom Scavo.

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:24,833
That was none of
your damn business.

11
00:00:24,834 --> 00:00:26,906
I am Lynette's friend,
and I'm not gonna stand by

12
00:00:26,907 --> 00:00:28,664
and watch you screw
up her marriage.

13
00:00:29,092 --> 00:00:31,485
- Help! - And when a neighborhood
protest got violent...

14
00:00:31,486 --> 00:00:33,650
Juanita! Get off the car!

15
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:35,495
Juanita was saved...

16
00:00:36,862 --> 00:00:38,285
Susan was hurt...

17
00:00:39,633 --> 00:00:41,807
And later, someone...

18
00:00:42,294 --> 00:00:43,513
Got revenge.

19
00:00:53,394 --> 00:00:54,662
Something happened

20
00:00:54,663 --> 00:00:56,518
in the suburbs last night.

21
00:00:58,299 --> 00:01:01,225
A man was shot outside his home.

22
00:01:03,565 --> 00:01:06,578
Detectives were
called to investigate.

23
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:12,035
And they soon learned
this man had enemies.

24
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,376
Detectives, I'm an expert marksman.

25
00:01:15,377 --> 00:01:16,864
If I'd been aiming for Paul Young,

26
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:18,442
he'd be dead.

27
00:01:19,302 --> 00:01:20,887
I have no idea who shot Paul.

28
00:01:21,054 --> 00:01:22,332
All I know is I need a chiropractor

29
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:23,718
for all the cartwheels
I've been doing.

30
00:01:24,974 --> 00:01:26,577
If you find out who did it,
let me know.

31
00:01:26,874 --> 00:01:28,214
I want to send them flowers.

32
00:01:30,853 --> 00:01:34,013
Yes, the police had many suspects

33
00:01:34,014 --> 00:01:35,907
in the shooting of Paul Young.

34
00:01:38,154 --> 00:01:39,523
But his wife...

35
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,234
Had only one.

36
00:01:46,249 --> 00:01:47,631
I was surprised you
wanted to see me.

37
00:01:47,632 --> 00:01:50,213
Our last visit ended less than...
pleasantly.

38
00:01:51,543 --> 00:01:52,937
Are you here to apologize?

39
00:01:53,225 --> 00:01:55,116
You know exactly why I'm here.

40
00:01:55,328 --> 00:01:56,584
No, I don't.

41
00:01:57,289 --> 00:01:59,183
Obviously, you didn't
do it yourself.

42
00:01:59,325 --> 00:02:00,973
So who did you hire?

43
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,886
Beth, I don't know what
you're talking about.

44
00:02:03,887 --> 00:02:05,346
Paul's been shot.

45
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:06,712
What?

46
00:02:09,182 --> 00:02:10,583
Is he dead?
No.

47
00:02:11,002 --> 00:02:13,288
Sorry. He's in the hospital.

48
00:02:14,483 --> 00:02:15,700
When did this happen?

49
00:02:15,701 --> 00:02:16,757
Oh, stop it, mama.

50
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:20,041
Just stop it. I know you had
something to do with this.

51
00:02:20,414 --> 00:02:21,422
Beth, you have to believe me.

52
00:02:21,423 --> 00:02:23,778
I-I don't know anything about it.
You're a liar.

53
00:02:24,409 --> 00:02:28,293
Look, I'm not going to pretend
I don't hate the man. I do.

54
00:02:28,294 --> 00:02:29,448
But my goal all along
has been to prove

55
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:30,591
that he murdered my sister.

56
00:02:30,592 --> 00:02:32,567
Why would I have him killed
before I could do that?

57
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:35,831
Then who shot him?

58
00:02:37,286 --> 00:02:37,994
I don't know.

59
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,414
I don't know what
to believe anymore.

60
00:02:44,605 --> 00:02:45,858
I have to go to the hospital.

61
00:02:57,492 --> 00:03:00,019
Word on the yard is that you
can get me a clean cell phone.

62
00:03:00,427 --> 00:03:01,435
For a price.

63
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:02,749
Get it.

64
00:03:09,861 --> 00:03:11,922
Somebody's been a naughty boy.

65
00:03:13,795 --> 00:03:17,612
I guess you changed your mind
about that proposal I made.

66
00:03:19,417 --> 00:03:22,347
Oh, don't get me wrong.
I'm thrilled.

67
00:03:22,779 --> 00:03:24,960
I just wish you'd waited
till I gave you the signal.

68
00:03:26,085 --> 00:03:29,569
Yes, Paul Young had enemies.

69
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,222
I can't talk right n.

70
00:03:32,571 --> 00:03:34,621
More than he knew.

71
00:03:47,641 --> 00:03:50,072
It's something we
need to be reminded of

72
00:03:50,073 --> 00:03:53,529
whenever our world has
been turned upside down.

73
00:03:54,422 --> 00:03:57,192
Come the morning, life goes on.

74
00:03:58,891 --> 00:04:02,566
We pull ourselves together
and go on shopping sprees...

75
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,237
Or reignite a love affair...

76
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,937
Or go back to work.

77
00:04:14,015 --> 00:04:17,958
Yes, we must remember
life will get better...

78
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,039
Unless it doesn't.

79
00:04:21,206 --> 00:04:22,893
You took out my kidney?

80
00:04:23,547 --> 00:04:24,522
It had ruptured.

81
00:04:24,523 --> 00:04:27,484
You were bleeding internally.
We had no choice.

82
00:04:27,485 --> 00:04:28,428
Oh, my God.

83
00:04:30,373 --> 00:04:32,600
But you can get by
on one kidney, right?

84
00:04:32,749 --> 00:04:36,729
Usually. But in your case,
it's a little more complicated.

85
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,128
The other one is deformed.

86
00:04:39,264 --> 00:04:43,364
Well, fine. I won't enter it
in any kidney beauty contests.

87
00:04:44,614 --> 00:04:49,050
The point is, it's only
operating at about 5%.

88
00:04:49,445 --> 00:04:51,485
If that number drops any lower,

89
00:04:51,486 --> 00:04:53,765
you're at serious
risk of renal failure.

90
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,631
How do I not know this?

91
00:04:55,632 --> 00:04:58,340
I-I've never had any
serious health problems.

92
00:04:58,635 --> 00:05:01,312
That's because the other kidney
was doing such a great job

93
00:05:01,313 --> 00:05:02,586
of taking up the slack.

94
00:05:03,781 --> 00:05:05,618
You mean the one you took?

95
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:07,407
Yes.

96
00:05:10,525 --> 00:05:14,620
So what are you saying?
Do I need a transplant?

97
00:05:14,954 --> 00:05:19,931
Eventually. But we need
to get you on dialysis.

98
00:05:20,122 --> 00:05:22,286
That requires a minor
surgical procedure

99
00:05:22,287 --> 00:05:24,376
to install an A.V. shunt,

100
00:05:24,377 --> 00:05:26,927
going...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down.

101
00:05:27,164 --> 00:05:30,338
Y-you said if it goes any lower.

102
00:05:30,891 --> 00:05:33,424
Maybe it won't. Maybe it'll go up.

103
00:05:33,691 --> 00:05:34,971
Anything is possible.

104
00:05:36,284 --> 00:05:37,889
But you need to come to terms

105
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:40,082
with the reality of
what's happened to you.

106
00:05:40,938 --> 00:05:42,264
Your life has changed.

107
00:05:43,354 --> 00:05:47,221
I have some information
here on dialysis.

108
00:05:47,429 --> 00:05:48,879
I suggest you read it...

109
00:05:49,087 --> 00:05:49,758
Today.

110
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,917
Welcome to Miss Charlotte's
Doll Academy.

111
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:03,416
I'm Miss Charlotte.

112
00:06:03,724 --> 00:06:05,176
How can I serve you today?

113
00:06:05,177 --> 00:06:06,993
We are here to buy a doll.

114
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:10,551
Oh, I'm sorry.
We don't sell dolls here.

115
00:06:11,521 --> 00:06:12,276
Really?

116
00:06:14,591 --> 00:06:16,760
Wow. This place got creepy fast.

117
00:06:17,275 --> 00:06:21,930
But I do let good little girls
adopt some of my friends.

118
00:06:23,744 --> 00:06:25,506
Are you ready to be a mommy?

119
00:06:26,338 --> 00:06:27,752
I don't care.

120
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,700
Oh, she's kidding.

121
00:06:31,441 --> 00:06:33,016
She would love a doll,
and I want to do

122
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:35,324
something special for her birthday.

123
00:06:35,801 --> 00:06:38,053
So let's get this adoption going.

124
00:06:38,054 --> 00:06:41,905
Very good. I have someone
in our royalty cabinet

125
00:06:41,906 --> 00:06:43,523
I'd love for you to meet.

126
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:48,983
Look, I am sorry about
everything you've been through

127
00:06:48,984 --> 00:06:50,296
the past few days.

128
00:06:50,297 --> 00:06:52,844
But I'm trying to show
you how much I love you.

129
00:06:52,895 --> 00:06:54,350
Can't you meet me halfway?

130
00:06:56,099 --> 00:06:58,477
This is Lady Catherine.

131
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:00,873
She's the toast of
Buckingham Palace.

132
00:07:00,874 --> 00:07:04,196
The trim on her cloak
is real ermine.

133
00:07:04,434 --> 00:07:06,632
Ooh! Isn't she gorgeous?

134
00:07:07,121 --> 00:07:07,888
Wow.

135
00:07:10,295 --> 00:07:11,924
I'll go prepare her papers.

136
00:07:13,781 --> 00:07:15,858
Are you happy, sweetie?
Yeah!

137
00:07:16,718 --> 00:07:17,739
Oh. Let me get my phone out

138
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,038
so I can take a picture
of my two princesses.

139
00:07:27,537 --> 00:07:29,158
Why are you looking at Grace?

140
00:07:30,231 --> 00:07:33,605
O-oh, I wasn't. I was, uh...
I must have scrolled too far.

141
00:07:33,606 --> 00:07:35,126
Why do you even have that picture?

142
00:07:35,548 --> 00:07:37,493
And what name shall I
put under "mother"?

143
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,694
Put whatever you want.
I hate this stupid place.

144
00:07:43,898 --> 00:07:44,951
Oh...
Juanita!

145
00:07:45,596 --> 00:07:47,011
Juanita, wait!

146
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:56,143
Susan, hi.

147
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,736
I heard about your kidney.

148
00:08:00,737 --> 00:08:02,892
And I just want you
to know I have two.

149
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,732
So let's talk deal.

150
00:08:05,497 --> 00:08:07,837
Relax. I'm not telling Lynette.

151
00:08:08,376 --> 00:08:09,215
You're not?

152
00:08:10,909 --> 00:08:13,116
Thing about having something
like this happen to you...

153
00:08:14,274 --> 00:08:17,072
You start to think about what's
important and what's not.

154
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,711
And I realized it's not
up to me to tell Lynette

155
00:08:20,712 --> 00:08:22,865
about something that
happened 20 years ago.

156
00:08:23,078 --> 00:08:25,184
Oh. Thank God.

157
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,494
It's up to you.

158
00:08:33,521 --> 00:08:37,326
Hey. Y-you okay?

159
00:08:38,104 --> 00:08:40,759
You've been standing out here for,
like, 20 minutes.

160
00:08:41,831 --> 00:08:43,445
I saw Susan at the hospital.

161
00:08:44,582 --> 00:08:45,565
How's she doing?

162
00:08:46,803 --> 00:08:50,067
She's not gonna tell Lynette
about our 20-year-old mistake.

163
00:08:51,138 --> 00:08:53,664
Oh, thank God.

164
00:08:53,665 --> 00:08:54,741
What a relief!

165
00:08:56,928 --> 00:08:58,556
W-why aren't you relieved?

166
00:08:59,064 --> 00:09:02,153
There's one thing she said
I can't get out of my head.

167
00:09:04,482 --> 00:09:07,478
If I never tell
Lynette what happened,

168
00:09:07,773 --> 00:09:09,998
then my friendship
with her is not real.

169
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,439
Sure it's real. Ugh.

170
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,788
All my life, people I thought
were my friends have left me.

171
00:09:17,966 --> 00:09:20,629
People from college,
friends I had with Doug...

172
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:21,414
They're all gone.

173
00:09:23,611 --> 00:09:24,812
And Lynette stayed.

174
00:09:26,186 --> 00:09:27,827
I think I owe her the truth.

175
00:09:28,887 --> 00:09:30,679
No. No, no, no, no, no!

176
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,679
Sometimes being a friend
requires you to lie.

177
00:09:34,745 --> 00:09:35,569
I mean, come on.

178
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,592
We've all seen McCluskey
in those jogging shorts

179
00:09:37,593 --> 00:09:41,224
and yelled, "lookin' good!"
That's being a friend.

180
00:09:43,581 --> 00:09:44,368
Renee...

181
00:09:45,383 --> 00:09:46,959
You can't tell Lynette.

182
00:09:47,686 --> 00:09:49,027
She would be devastated.

183
00:09:50,347 --> 00:09:51,031
I know.

184
00:09:52,854 --> 00:09:54,677
I just have to live with
what that says about me.

185
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:58,215
Great. We got a plan.

186
00:10:03,226 --> 00:10:06,240
Thought you might want a cold
root beer to cool you down.

187
00:10:06,638 --> 00:10:08,259
I like the "cold" and "beer" part.

188
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,751
I know living with a
woman who doesn't drink...

189
00:10:10,752 --> 00:10:11,933
It must be torture.

190
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:16,345
How's the replanting coming?
It's taking a little while.

191
00:10:16,346 --> 00:10:18,227
Yard got pretty
messed up by the riot.

192
00:10:18,425 --> 00:10:20,480
I'll work on the sprinklers later.
There's no rush.

193
00:10:22,172 --> 00:10:23,952
Ah, look who's drinking
out of the bottle.

194
00:10:25,147 --> 00:10:26,157
See what you've done to me?

195
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:28,618
The next thing you know,
I'll be flossing only once a day.

196
00:10:30,548 --> 00:10:32,011
Hey. You started
unpacking my stuff?

197
00:10:32,397 --> 00:10:34,260
Yes. Your, uh,
books are on the shelf.

198
00:10:34,261 --> 00:10:36,075
Sports trophies are in the den.

199
00:10:36,076 --> 00:10:38,592
And on a sad note, your beanbag
chair accidentally ripped

200
00:10:38,593 --> 00:10:41,179
when I stuck a knife in it
and stuffed it in the trash.

201
00:10:41,409 --> 00:10:43,556
Hmm. My lava lamp?

202
00:10:43,767 --> 00:10:46,016
Accidentally broke when I
pushed it off the counter.

203
00:10:46,621 --> 00:10:48,183
Man, my stuff is clumsy.

204
00:10:48,457 --> 00:10:51,913
I may not love all your things,
but I love that you're here.

205
00:10:52,364 --> 00:10:54,958
Everything that happened
over the last few days

206
00:10:55,343 --> 00:10:57,442
made me realize how
important you are to me.

207
00:11:00,225 --> 00:11:02,461
Mm! Whew!

208
00:11:03,584 --> 00:11:05,675
Steer manure's not your
favorite aphrodisiac?

209
00:11:05,676 --> 00:11:07,693
It's only slightly worse
than your aftershave,

210
00:11:07,694 --> 00:11:09,600
which accidentally got
poured down the drain.

211
00:11:09,601 --> 00:11:11,388
Well, hold your breath.
I'm kissing you anyway.

212
00:11:12,855 --> 00:11:14,348
There is a God.

213
00:11:18,145 --> 00:11:19,114
Mm. Can I help you?

214
00:11:19,447 --> 00:11:20,610
Someone to see you.

215
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:25,743
Orson.

216
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:28,101
Judy kicked me out.

217
00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:30,113
Can I stay here with you?

218
00:11:37,954 --> 00:11:39,418
I never saw it coming.

219
00:11:40,059 --> 00:11:43,575
One minute, Judy and I were
enjoying a nice Pinot Noir,

220
00:11:43,576 --> 00:11:45,290
and the next, she was
wheeling me to the cab,

221
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:48,347
and telling me it was over.
That's terrible.

222
00:11:48,348 --> 00:11:51,071
Well, don't you worry.
You can stay here with us.

223
00:11:52,153 --> 00:11:53,059
Are you sure?

224
00:11:53,361 --> 00:11:56,058
I mean, I had no idea that Keith
had just moved in with you.

225
00:11:57,754 --> 00:11:58,975
I mean, you're a new couple.

226
00:11:58,976 --> 00:12:00,705
The last thing you need around here

227
00:12:00,706 --> 00:12:03,330
is a third and... fourth wheel.

228
00:12:03,331 --> 00:12:06,011
Nonsense. We insist.
Stay as long as you want.

229
00:12:06,012 --> 00:12:07,007
Isn't that right, Keith?

230
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,644
Oh, yeah. Sure.

231
00:12:09,898 --> 00:12:11,543
Any idea how long that might... be?

232
00:12:13,411 --> 00:12:17,618
I just want to know how long
we'll be enjoying his company.

233
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:20,254
I gather as soon as I can
find a new place to live

234
00:12:20,255 --> 00:12:24,239
and a caregiver.
Would you mind backing up a bit?

235
00:12:24,613 --> 00:12:26,820
Your cologne is
making my eyes water.

236
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:28,743
Actually, it's steer manure.

237
00:12:30,058 --> 00:12:31,364
To each his own.

238
00:12:31,563 --> 00:12:32,711
Uh, Keith, why don't you go shower?

239
00:12:32,712 --> 00:12:34,705
And I'll, uh, get Orson settled.

240
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,205
Would you like some tea?

241
00:12:42,206 --> 00:12:43,989
Mm, no. I'm fine.

242
00:12:44,228 --> 00:12:45,360
So...

243
00:12:46,055 --> 00:12:46,911
Keith.

244
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:49,297
Interesting choice.

245
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:52,823
Just... sort of happened.

246
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,916
Hmm.

247
00:12:55,172 --> 00:12:56,618
But moving in together?

248
00:12:56,619 --> 00:12:58,381
I mean, aren't you taking
this rebound relationship

249
00:12:58,382 --> 00:12:59,849
a little too seriously?

250
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,665
It's not a rebound relationship.

251
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:04,653
What Keith and I have
is very... special.

252
00:13:05,748 --> 00:13:08,004
And I know what you're thinking.
He is a bit young.

253
00:13:08,005 --> 00:13:11,541
Oh, no. Not at all. I notice he
has all of his big boy teeth.

254
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:13,974
But he and I have a lot in common.
Really?

255
00:13:15,157 --> 00:13:16,154
Hmm.

256
00:13:16,155 --> 00:13:17,897
I'm just... curious.

257
00:13:19,251 --> 00:13:21,814
Which Lil Wayne song
is your favorite?

258
00:13:21,815 --> 00:13:23,929
"Fo Sheezy" or "Ask Them Hoes"?

259
00:13:24,207 --> 00:13:26,625
Joke if you must, but I am
not the woman you once knew.

260
00:13:26,626 --> 00:13:29,634
I have changed,
and Keith is responsible.

261
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,058
What I'm wondering is
why would someone change

262
00:13:32,059 --> 00:13:33,842
something that was already perfect?

263
00:13:45,295 --> 00:13:47,897
God, I never thought we'd
have a kid in therapy.

264
00:13:48,907 --> 00:13:50,745
Well, I did. I just
thought it'd be Celia.

265
00:13:59,782 --> 00:14:01,181
I wish we weren't doing this.

266
00:14:01,182 --> 00:14:02,699
You know the shrink
always blames the mother.

267
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:04,934
The husband blames the mother, too.

268
00:14:05,773 --> 00:14:07,182
How many times do I
have to say I'm sorry?

269
00:14:07,183 --> 00:14:09,272
You know what?
It is not about us anymore.

270
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,664
Juanita's world is
collapsing around her,

271
00:14:11,665 --> 00:14:13,777
and the only thing that I care
about is healing the damage

272
00:14:13,778 --> 00:14:15,357
that's been done to
that poor little girl.

273
00:14:18,756 --> 00:14:19,974
I took her doll shopping.

274
00:14:21,747 --> 00:14:23,950
Juanita, if you'd like to
go through the magazines,

275
00:14:23,951 --> 00:14:26,153
I'll talk to your mom
and dad for a minute.

276
00:14:26,154 --> 00:14:28,827
Okay.
Okay? Please.

277
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:40,230
Obviously, this is a very...
Unusual situation.

278
00:14:40,231 --> 00:14:42,034
Juanita understands now

279
00:14:42,035 --> 00:14:45,367
that her birth parents
are Hector and Carmen.

280
00:14:45,368 --> 00:14:47,010
But she feels nothing for them.

281
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,496
And because of that,
she doesn't understand

282
00:14:49,497 --> 00:14:51,738
why you feel so much for Grace.

283
00:14:51,739 --> 00:14:52,973
Well, it's a different
kind of love.

284
00:14:52,974 --> 00:14:54,927
It doesn't mean we
love Juanita any less.

285
00:14:54,944 --> 00:14:55,996
What should we do?

286
00:14:57,432 --> 00:14:59,590
Remove Grace from your life.

287
00:15:01,028 --> 00:15:02,399
We told you. She's already gone.

288
00:15:03,513 --> 00:15:05,667
Juanita says there
are photos of her.

289
00:15:05,668 --> 00:15:08,126
Her artwork is on
your refrigerator.

290
00:15:09,251 --> 00:15:11,012
You're saying get rid of all that.

291
00:15:11,013 --> 00:15:14,756
Yes. Once Juanita
feels she is again

292
00:15:14,757 --> 00:15:17,035
the most important
thing in your life,

293
00:15:17,036 --> 00:15:18,269
she will start to heal.

294
00:15:19,574 --> 00:15:21,453
Well, obviously,
I want to help my daughter.

295
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:23,101
But all the photos?

296
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:26,058
We'll do whatever it takes.

297
00:15:27,186 --> 00:15:28,075
Good.

298
00:15:32,857 --> 00:15:34,437
So we canvassed your neighborhood

299
00:15:34,438 --> 00:15:37,049
to determine if
anyone had any motive.

300
00:15:37,702 --> 00:15:38,802
And, uh...

301
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,803
They all did.

302
00:15:42,491 --> 00:15:45,267
Yes. But so far,
all of them have an alibi.

303
00:15:47,109 --> 00:15:49,334
So... what's the next step?

304
00:15:49,736 --> 00:15:52,341
Well, we'd like to ask Mrs. Young
a few questions.

305
00:15:54,481 --> 00:15:55,751
What kind of questions?

306
00:15:55,835 --> 00:15:58,176
Well, for starters, we'd like
to know where exactly you were

307
00:15:58,177 --> 00:16:01,207
- when your husband was shot, and...
- I'm gonna stop you right there.

308
00:16:02,111 --> 00:16:05,033
My wife is not a suspect
in this investigation.

309
00:16:05,424 --> 00:16:08,142
She is the one person
in that whole corrupt,

310
00:16:08,143 --> 00:16:10,232
backstabbing street
that I can trust.

311
00:16:14,887 --> 00:16:15,975
Okay. Uh...

312
00:16:16,354 --> 00:16:18,833
Is there anyone else who might
harbor a grudge against you

313
00:16:18,834 --> 00:16:22,034
or wish you harm in any way?
Not that I can think of.

314
00:16:22,577 --> 00:16:23,971
What about you, Mrs. Young?

315
00:16:28,173 --> 00:16:28,912
No.

316
00:16:31,993 --> 00:16:33,389
No one I can think of.

317
00:16:38,604 --> 00:16:40,741
Well, then, uh,
if you can think of anyone,

318
00:16:40,742 --> 00:16:41,628
please let us know.

319
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:48,310
Did you catch the look
on the wife's face?

320
00:16:48,311 --> 00:16:48,887
Yeah.

321
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,470
Gaby!
What?

322
00:16:57,576 --> 00:16:59,330
What are these photos of
Grace still doing here?

323
00:17:00,511 --> 00:17:03,209
Oh. Right. Sorry.
You should have gotten rid of these

324
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,868
the second we got back
from the doctor's.

325
00:17:05,747 --> 00:17:07,450
I've been busy.
Here, give them to me.

326
00:17:08,776 --> 00:17:11,101
What are you gonna do with them?
Hide them in the closet.

327
00:17:11,695 --> 00:17:13,947
No. We have to throw these away.

328
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:14,959
Why?

329
00:17:15,705 --> 00:17:16,686
Juanita could find them.

330
00:17:16,687 --> 00:17:19,477
She and Celia play in
your closet all the time.

331
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:23,198
Fine. I'll put them in
our safety deposit box.

332
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,470
The girls don't play at the bank.

333
00:17:25,762 --> 00:17:27,561
Why are you not
taking this seriously?

334
00:17:27,763 --> 00:17:29,098
Dr. Lunt never said

335
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:30,683
we had to throw Grace's
photos in the trash.

336
00:17:30,684 --> 00:17:33,178
The doctor said we have to
remove Grace from our lives.

337
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:36,705
You understand what that means?
As far as we are concerned,

338
00:17:36,706 --> 00:17:40,325
Grace no longer exists.
Now give me your phone, please.

339
00:17:41,106 --> 00:17:41,730
Why?

340
00:17:41,731 --> 00:17:43,593
I'm going to delete
every photo of Grace.

341
00:17:43,594 --> 00:17:45,886
Oh, you can't be serious.
Juanita is in pain!

342
00:17:46,019 --> 00:17:47,371
Do you not get that?!

343
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,281
She is no longer a
happy little girl

344
00:17:50,282 --> 00:17:51,981
because you did not protect her!

345
00:17:56,964 --> 00:17:57,989
So what am I supposed to do?

346
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,764
Just pretend Grace doesn't exist?

347
00:17:59,765 --> 00:18:03,018
Yes! And that is the last time

348
00:18:03,019 --> 00:18:05,048
you will mention her
name in this house!

349
00:18:14,382 --> 00:18:16,533
Oh, please, no more meds.

350
00:18:16,837 --> 00:18:19,027
I'm good for what ails ya.

351
00:18:19,487 --> 00:18:21,106
Mike! Oh!

352
00:18:21,527 --> 00:18:22,361
Oh...

353
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,311
Oh! Oh!

354
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:28,978
Oh, I need to look at you.
No, I need to hug you.

355
00:18:29,762 --> 00:18:31,483
How's my girl? Hmm?

356
00:18:31,484 --> 00:18:33,729
Hear you're about a
half-pound lighter.

357
00:18:34,577 --> 00:18:35,895
They told you about the kidney?

358
00:18:35,896 --> 00:18:39,923
Yeah. But it's gonna be okay.
We're gonna get through this.

359
00:18:39,924 --> 00:18:42,362
Dialysis is not as
bad as it sounds.

360
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:44,602
I'm not doing dialysis.

361
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,804
What? It's like six hours a day,
four times a week.

362
00:18:48,805 --> 00:18:50,514
There's not enough
gossip rags in the world

363
00:18:50,515 --> 00:18:51,773
to fill up that kind of time.

364
00:18:51,774 --> 00:18:54,795
Plus, I have a job
and a kid to raise.

365
00:18:55,692 --> 00:18:56,629
But the doctor said...

366
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:58,088
Mike, you know what?

367
00:18:58,413 --> 00:19:00,151
The doctors...
They don't know everything.

368
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:04,952
Look at this. There's herbal
remedies and alternative diets.

369
00:19:05,453 --> 00:19:07,096
There's a lot of other
ways to handle this

370
00:19:07,097 --> 00:19:08,406
than being hooked up to a machine.

371
00:19:09,217 --> 00:19:11,040
Mike, I-I feel great.

372
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,538
And I just want to
handle this my own way.

373
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:16,740
Well, I'd feel a lot better

374
00:19:16,741 --> 00:19:17,978
if you'd listen to the doctors.

375
00:19:18,661 --> 00:19:21,090
And I'd feel a lot better
if I had your support.

376
00:19:23,551 --> 00:19:24,201
Okay.

377
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,985
God, I can't believe you're back.

378
00:19:36,061 --> 00:19:37,932
So the overall
approach is craftsman,

379
00:19:37,933 --> 00:19:40,713
but with Japanese accents,
including the lighting....

380
00:19:40,714 --> 00:19:43,270
The vases, the calligraphy.
The two styles...

381
00:19:43,271 --> 00:19:44,614
Work perfectly together.

382
00:19:44,615 --> 00:19:47,222
And for your hotel,
we think it would look...

383
00:19:47,223 --> 00:19:48,962
Just gorgeous.

384
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:54,125
Well, I usually run
everything past my board...

385
00:19:55,258 --> 00:19:56,370
But not this time.

386
00:19:56,934 --> 00:19:57,651
I love it.

387
00:19:58,457 --> 00:20:00,930
And I love the way you
two are so in sync.

388
00:20:01,109 --> 00:20:03,741
Well, we should be. We've been
best friends for 25 years.

389
00:20:04,171 --> 00:20:06,609
Well, actually, uh, 26. Oh.

390
00:20:06,965 --> 00:20:07,884
You can tell.

391
00:20:09,485 --> 00:20:12,127
So, let's see what you have
in mind for the lighting.

392
00:20:12,306 --> 00:20:14,437
You guys keep talking.
I'm gonna go get the water pitcher,

393
00:20:14,438 --> 00:20:16,389
'cause the waiter
won't refill my glass.

394
00:20:18,365 --> 00:20:20,111
So... the lighting.

395
00:20:21,033 --> 00:20:22,694
Uh, yeah, I have a company

396
00:20:22,695 --> 00:20:25,387
that does these
Japanese paper lanterns.

397
00:20:25,695 --> 00:20:26,969
Mm. They're beautiful.

398
00:20:27,369 --> 00:20:29,131
And you know we have other hotels.

399
00:20:29,132 --> 00:20:31,938
So we may need some
more conversations.

400
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:36,826
Hey. Look what I found next to
the water pitcher. Tee... ta-da!

401
00:20:38,324 --> 00:20:39,387
Oatmeal raisin.

402
00:20:39,388 --> 00:20:40,934
She's always been crazy about them.

403
00:20:40,935 --> 00:20:44,276
Remember freshman year, when you
broke up with that boyfriend?

404
00:20:44,277 --> 00:20:47,792
I kept her on a steady
diet of these and tequila

405
00:20:47,793 --> 00:20:48,908
for two weeks.

406
00:20:50,201 --> 00:20:53,069
The bar is one of
my favorite areas.

407
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,912
Those lanterns with these...

408
00:20:54,913 --> 00:20:55,820
Are you okay?

409
00:20:58,869 --> 00:21:00,108
It's just, uh...

410
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:03,924
Oatmeal raisin.

411
00:21:05,586 --> 00:21:06,229
Yeah?

412
00:21:07,176 --> 00:21:08,995
You've been such a
good friend to me.

413
00:21:08,996 --> 00:21:10,040
Hey...

414
00:21:10,258 --> 00:21:11,850
Hey, relax!

415
00:21:11,851 --> 00:21:14,022
There was, like,
a hundred of 'em on a tray.

416
00:21:19,754 --> 00:21:21,117
So, take the drawings home.

417
00:21:21,318 --> 00:21:24,400
Live with them.
And we will check in next week.

418
00:21:25,552 --> 00:21:27,025
Renee, are you...

419
00:21:27,026 --> 00:21:29,573
Yeah, no, she's fine. She's fine.

420
00:21:29,574 --> 00:21:31,554
And we'll call you next week.

421
00:21:31,555 --> 00:21:35,145
And thank you so much.
We are so excited.

422
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,490
What the hell?

423
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:45,240
I have to tell you something.

424
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:48,570
20 years ago...

425
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:51,730
I did something awful.

426
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,729
God, who cares?

427
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:57,390
Ten minutes ago,
you did something amazing.

428
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,590
I slept with Tom.

429
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,839
When?

430
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,580
It was that weekend you
went to visit your parents.

431
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,530
And it was just the one time,
and it meant nothing.

432
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,759
And I've been carrying this around

433
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,040
ever since I moved here.

434
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:25,570
And it's been eating me up.

435
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,999
That was after we were engaged.

436
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,280
Yeah, but you had... broken up...

437
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,580
For the week.

438
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:41,370
God, I'm so sorry.

439
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:44,980
I don't want to hear it.

440
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,650
In fact, I can't even
look at you right now.

441
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,420
I can't even...

442
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,840
Be in the same room
as you right now.

443
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,830
But you are my ride, so let's go.

444
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,249
Do you hate me?

445
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,390
Shut up.

446
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:25,969
Lynette, I just need to...

447
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,600
Shut up.

448
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:31,090
Yes.

449
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,930
I hate you...

450
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:34,850
A lot.

451
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:37,509
But I do foresee a
day far in the future

452
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:39,750
when I might only
hate you a little.

453
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:45,079
You know what the worst part is?
For the last 20 years,

454
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,980
you two have been walking
around knowing this, and...

455
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,730
I...

456
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,230
Didn't.

457
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,740
I'm such an idiot.

458
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:59,409
You're not, you're not.
And I am so sorry...

459
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:02,390
Oh, my God, you really
need to stop saying that.

460
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,610
But I do need you to do me a favor.

461
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,139
Anything.

462
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:11,590
Don't tell Tom we
talked about this.

463
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:12,880
Why?

464
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,269
You slept with my husband.

465
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:18,040
Can we just leave it at
"'cause I said so"?

466
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:26,129

467

471
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:45,979
Hi. We haven't met yet.
I'm Tina's mother.

472
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,940
Juanita came to our
house last week.

473
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,439
Oh, right. Thanks for coming.

474
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,420
Of course.

475
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:52,720
Mom.

476
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:55,889
I know. You want some cake.

477
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:57,550
Hold on. We'll get you some.

478
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,869
Sorry. That's my youngest, Celia.

479
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,950
Oh, she's adorable.

480
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,750
Do you have any other children?

481
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,420
No.

482
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:13,020
I don't have any other children.

483
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:20,470
I am finally home.

484
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:24,849
And just so you know,
I had the worst day ever.

485
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:25,669
Did you?

486
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:29,349
Yeah, I-I-I had to meet with
one surly client after another.

487
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:32,749
Our computers went down.
I spilled coffee on my shoe.

488
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,619
Sounds like you went through a lot.

489
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,059
But I'm much better now.

490
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,469
Oh, m...
Oh, oh, oh, God!

491
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,899
Uh, I forgot to ask...
How did the pitch go?

492
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,140
Good. We got the job.

493
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,059
That is fantastic!

494
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,849
Oh, my God. You guys are
just getting started,

495
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:51,529
and you're already kicking ass!
I am so proud of you!

496
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:53,189
Well, it was mostly Renee.

497
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:55,180
She did the lion's
share of the work.

498
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,140
She's an amazing woman.

499
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,180
Yeah.

500
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,830
Everything okay?

501
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:12,280
Yes, of course. I, um...

502
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:14,050
That sounds great.

503
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,849
Yeah? Might be a little cold.
Do you want me to heat it up?

504
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:18,130
No. It's okay.

505
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,620
Mm!

506
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:22,369
Aah!

507
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:25,599
It's... it's... it's boiling!
Is it?

508
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,390
I-I-I burned my tongue!

509
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,230
Oh, I'm sorry.

510
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:39,840
Here we are.

511
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,809
Oh, Bree, you didn't.
Coq au vin?

512
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,209
Well, I know it's your favorite,

513
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:46,319
and considering the rough
few days you've had...

514
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,790
You are amazing.

515
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,710
Hello.

516
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,979
Oh, good, you're here.

517
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,430
We can eat.

518
00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:01,079
What that? I thought, uh,
we were having sloppy joes.

519
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,929
Oh... uh, well...
Since we're having a guest,

520
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:06,109
I thought I'd serve
something more elegant.

521
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,069
You know what?

522
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:09,829
Tomorrow night, you and I
should make our bouillabaisse.

523
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:12,060
Of course.
Oh, Keith, you'll love it.

524
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:15,420
If it's French for "sloppy joes,"
then have at it.

525
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:18,479
Bree, this looks wonderful.

526
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,299
Mm.

527
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,400
If I may.

528
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,769
"Show me another
pleasure like dinner

529
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:25,760
which comes every day
and lasts an hour."

530
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,170
Talleyrand.

531
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,820
"Shut up and eat, varmints!"

532
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,490
Yosemite Sam.

533
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:40,279
Well, this is quite a thrill.

534
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,550
I didn't know Stanley Kowalski
was joining us for dinner.

535
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:47,640
Is he a friend of you guys?

536
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,389
Um, actually, um...

537
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:55,300
It's a character in
"A Streetcar Named Desire."

538
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,490
He wore a lot of t-shirts and...

539
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:04,690
Because Will Ferrell
hasn't done a remake.

540
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,740
Um...

541
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:12,149
Sweetheart, why don't you
go up and put a shirt on?

542
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:14,450
After all, it is dinner,
and we do have company.

543
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,419
If it's all the same to everyone,
I'm comfortable,

544
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,909
so I'd like to stay in this.

545
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:19,299
Why don't I just go
up and grab you one?

546
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,390
It will only take a sec.
Bree, sit.

547
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:25,520
Please. I'm sure our company can
endure one night of bare arms.

548
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,149
Quite right. Though I don't
know what the fuss is.

549
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:32,439
Seems like such a
reasonable request.

550
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,499
Guess I just like dressing
the way I want to dress

551
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,469
in my own home.
Here's an idea.

552
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:37,449
Why don't you take off your jacket,

553
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:38,949
see how much more comfortable it is?

554
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:41,380
Well, if it's all the same to you,
I'd prefer not to.

555
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,959
Aren't you afraid of
getting food on it?

556
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,990
Not really.

557
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,760
I'm planning on eating with
utensils, not my hands.

558
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:52,680
Keith.

559
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,430
Whoops.

560
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:57,120
Accidents happen.

561
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:02,349
Well, I suppose I should be happy

562
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:04,610
it wasn't his own feces.

563
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:07,549
Orson, I'm so sorry.
Keith, what were you thinking?

564
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:09,579
Let's just put this
behind us, shall we?

565
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,969
And enjoy the lovely meal
that you've prepared.

566
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:13,860
Oh, and please pass the peas.

567
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:30,279
Stop it this instant!
You're acting like children,

568
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,890
and I will not stand for it!
Do you hear me?!

569
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,770
Ahh!

570
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:43,830
Ohh!

571
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:49,930
Bree.

572
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:53,809
Hi, Judy. I'm sorry to just
come over here without calling,

573
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:55,700
but I need to speak with you.

574
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:57,770
Come in.

575
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,750
How's Orson?

576
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:07,190
You know he's, um, staying with me?

577
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,310
Figured as much.

578
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,880
Well, I need a favor.

579
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,379
It's, uh, just too difficult

580
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,629
for Orson to live with
me and my new boyfriend,

581
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:20,569
and I know you broke
up with him, but...

582
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:24,070
Is there any way he could stay
here until he finds a new place?

583
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:26,719
Look, I don't know what
he's been telling you,

584
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,870
but Orson left me.

585
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:32,450
What? Why?

586
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:35,890
Because he's still
in love with you.

587
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,650
Beautiful, isn't she?

588
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,600
Oh.

589
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:52,510
She's just perfect.

590
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,140
I'll take her.

591
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,420
I must say, your daughter's
a lucky little girl.

592
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:58,740
My daughter?

593
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,779
I assumed you were
buying her a present.

594
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,250
Oh, no.

595
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,930
This is for me.

596
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,640
Hey.

597
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:21,220
I'm really sorry about last night.

598
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,689
But there is something
about your ex...

599
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:28,179
Keith... I get it.
You had a relationship,

600
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,869
it's over, it's totally platonic,

601
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:31,330
and I'm cool with it.

602
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,349
Actually, I just spoke
with his ex-girlfriend.

603
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:37,499
Orson is still in love with me.

604
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,339
I knew it. I knew it.

605
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,639
Let's wheel his ass
to the curb right now.

606
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,649
Keith, Keith, calm down.
Before we wheel his...

607
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:46,819
Anywhere, I need to talk to him.

608
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,719
I'm sure I can get him to
make other arrangements.

609
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,909
Well, get him to make 'em now.

610
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:51,809
I don't want that guy in
our home another night.

611
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:53,950
Fine. Just give me 15 minutes.

612
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,810
I spoke with Judy.

613
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:08,820
She told me that you
were the one who left...

614
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:10,999
Because you still
have feelings for me.

615
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,110
Is that true? Is that...
Why you're here?

616
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:18,639
Leaving you was the biggest
mistake I could have made.

617
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,030
I know that now.

618
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:21,940
Orson...

619
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,120
Tell me you don't
feel the same way.

620
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,240
Just tell me you feel nothing,
and I will go away. I promise.

621
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:31,060
Do you know how easy it
would be for me to...

622
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,999
Become that woman again?

623
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,139
To slide back into the
role of your wife?

624
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,410
Then do it.

625
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:39,469
We have a connection,
Bree, and you know it.

626
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:40,610
We used to.

627
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:44,960
But I've made a new connection.

628
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,660
Please, with that
tattooed Neanderthal?

629
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,899
Yes, and I will always
have feelings for you,

630
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,470
but I've... changed.

631
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:55,470
How have you changed?

632
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:59,099
I... I can't articulate it to you

633
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,000
because I don't
understand it myself.

634
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:04,119
All I know is that being with Keith

635
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,010
has made me a different person.

636
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,720
I don't believe it.

637
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:14,820
Orson...

638
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:18,780
You will always have
a piece of my heart,

639
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,620
but you have to understand
that this is over.

640
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:27,620
I'm not giving up.

641
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:29,390
I'm not.

642
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,650
So?

643
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,199
Did you tell him?

644
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,900
Does he need help
packing his stuff?

645
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:46,770
Um... actually, Orson's gonna be
staying with us a little longer.

646
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:48,600
What?

647
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:51,639
Just, um, for a few more days

648
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,450
until he finds a place of his own.

649
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:57,080
Please? He's very
fragile right now.

650
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:58,770
I don't believe this.

651
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,969
Well, I can't just throw him out.

652
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:02,840
You know why?
Because you don't want to.

653
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:06,009
I don't blame you.

654
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:08,090
It's not your fault you're
still in love with him.

655
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,260
What?!

656
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:16,439
Wait! Please stop and talk to me!

657
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,490
Bree, there's nothing
to talk about!

658
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:21,119
Why would you wanna
be with sloppy Joe

659
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,290
when you can be with
coq au vin in there?

660
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:26,060
Let's just cut our losses.

661
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:35,990
You listen to me.

662
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:39,239
That's who I was, not who I am now.

663
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,800
I have never worked harder in
my life to keep a relationship,

664
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:44,729
and if I have to in a
pile of steer manure

665
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:46,990
to prove it to you,
then I'll do it!

666
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,120
Mmm.

667
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:05,159
Mike, just hang up.

668
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,460
I don't wanna deal
with any more doctors.

669
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:09,159
He's a top kidney specialist.

670
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,510
I really want you to talk to him.

671
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,039
I can't get any reception in here.

672
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,690
I'm gonna go downstairs. M.J.,
take care of your mom.

673
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,859
Mom, this pudding's gross.

674
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,580
I wish they had ice cream.

675
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:26,449
Well, I think they do in
the cafeteria downstairs.

676
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:28,869
When your dad comes back,
maybe he can take you.

677
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:31,470
How much longer are you
gonna be in the hospital?

678
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:36,000
I don't know. A little longer.

679
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:40,060
Is a kidney like a heart?
Do you need it to live?

680
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:47,100
Uh, well... yes.

681
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:51,270
So... you could die?

682
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:56,140
You know what?

683
00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:01,219
Why don't you and I go down
to the cafeteria

684
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:04,199
right now and get
you some ice cream?

685
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,569
Mrs. Delfino,
you're in no condition

686
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:06,919
to be getting out of bed.

687
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,279
Just taking him for ice cream.

688
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,559
Let me at least call you an orderly

689
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,890
and get you a wheelchair.
I don't need a wheelchair.

690
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:17,220
Look, I need to do this.
He's scared.

691
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:25,429
So how long till you're able
to play basketball with me?

692
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:28,939
Oh, not too long.
Trust me, sweetie.

693
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:32,950
I can't wait to kick your butt
in a little game of one-on-one.

694
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:34,630
Oh!

695
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,300
Are you okay?
Sure.

696
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:42,839
So, what... what kind of ice
cream do you want, sweetie?

697
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,519
Can I have an ice cream sandwich?

698
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,530
Oh. You bet.

699
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:48,300
You know what's cool?

700
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,179
When I was at my friend
Jerry's birthday party,

701
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:55,320
we made our own ice cream and
put graham crackers in it.

702
00:36:57,370 --> 00:36:59,420
That sounds... great.

703
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:04,079
Oh. You know what else was cool?
On St. Patrick's Day at school,

704
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,930
they gave us green ice cream.

705
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:10,589
There were green M&M's in it, too.

706
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:12,620
Everyone else thought it was gross.

707
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,360
Mommy!

708
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,729
So you're having surgery
to put in a shunt.

709
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:25,259
It's for the dialysis.

710
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,580
And how long will you
need to have this?

711
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,370
Till they find me a donor.

712
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,100
Well, that won't take
very long, will it?

713
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,080
Three to five years.

714
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:40,590
It's weird.

715
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,260
I'm going through this whole
thing like it was a movie.

716
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,140
It was happening to someone else.

717
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:50,850
But now...

718
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:54,300
It's real.

719
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:59,629
So I need to ask
you guys something.

720
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:01,270
Of course.
What is it?

721
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,440
If something happens to me...

722
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:09,169
I need to know if you'll be there

723
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:12,570
to help... Mike with M.J.

724
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:21,149
Honey, you'll come through
this with flying colors.

725
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:23,280
Yeah, nothing's
gonna happen to you.

726
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:35,350
Absolutely.
Yes. We'll be there.

727
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,960
My hero.

728
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:46,130
Save it. I had nothing
to do with what happened.

729
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:48,780
Could you do me a favor next time?

730
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,469
A little down... and to the right.

731
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:53,119
There's not gonna be a next time.

732
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,670
There wasn't a this time.

733
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:57,619
I thought you said
you'd think about it.

734
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:00,400
That's what you said,
and I told you "no."

735
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,970
I didn't do it.

736
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:07,760
Then who did?

737
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:18,790
Something happened in
the suburbs last week.

738
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:23,720
A man was shot outside his home.

739
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:28,110
Detectives were called
to investigate...

740
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,620
And they soon learned
this man had enemies...

741
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:38,680
Some he was not even aware of.

742
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:41,130
We're sorry to disturb
you again, sir.

743
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,679
Not at all. Any luck
with the investigation?

744
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,099
Is your wife here?

745
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,510
She's in the cafeteria.

746
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,390
Do you mind? It's a bit
of a delicate matter.

747
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:54,539
What's going on?
Sir, when we questioned you

748
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,869
about any enemies you might have,

749
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:58,059
you didn't mention
your mother-in-law.

750
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:00,769
My mother-in-law?
What are you talking about?

751
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:04,030
Uh, we did a little checking
into your wife's background.

752
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,079
Why didn't you tell us

753
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,260
her mother framed you
for her own murder?

754
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:14,869
I mean, come on.
We know she's in jail,

755
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:17,309
but Felicia Tillman has gone
to some extraordinary lengths

756
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:18,670
to cause you harm.

757
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,389
Are you sure there
isn't a possibility

758
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:22,300
that she somehow was
involved in this?

759
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:33,830
Not at all. That's
water under the bridge.

760
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,100
With love and prayer,

761
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,780
Felicia and I have resolved
the issues between us.

762
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:46,590
Okay. If anything else turns up,
we'll let you know.

763
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:47,840
I appreciate it.

764
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:50,190
Oh, and, officers?

765
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,270
Thank you for not bringing
this up in front of my wife.

766
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:58,710
Her mother is something that
we never really discuss.

767
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:09,110
