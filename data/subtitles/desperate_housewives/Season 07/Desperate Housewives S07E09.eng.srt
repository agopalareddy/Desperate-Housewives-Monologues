1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,400
<i>Renee and Tom discussed their past.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,413
I seem to remember you caught
me in a towel then, too.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,134
<i>Bree's Thanksgiving dinner...

4
00:00:10,168 --> 00:00:13,060
- I want a divorce!
- I'm happy to oblige!

5
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,612
Dad! Mom!

6
00:00:14,629 --> 00:00:16,188
<i>Went up in flames.

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,240
Look who's here!

8
00:00:17,302 --> 00:00:20,552
<i>Gaby's dinner ended
when Hector got arrested...

9
00:00:20,552 --> 00:00:23,944
- I think they're illegals.
- I have to move out of our house!

10
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:27,886
<i>And she was afraid of losing
her biological daughter Grace.

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,355
Stay with us until
we can figure things out.

12
00:00:30,389 --> 00:00:33,425
- <i>And Paul's plan...</i>
- You are the proud new owner
of your old house.
</i></i>

13
00:00:33,459 --> 00:00:36,094
<i>Was set in motion.

14
00:00:42,867 --> 00:00:45,429
So Paige and I will be
at the park for about 30 minutes.

15
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:48,332
Great. I should have all
the clothes packed up by then.

16
00:00:48,366 --> 00:00:50,131
Oh, shoot. I forgot the pacifier.

17
00:00:50,135 --> 00:00:53,738
I didn't. It's in the diaper bag.
Have a good time.

18
00:00:53,772 --> 00:00:55,673
<i>There are certain things

19
00:00:55,707 --> 00:00:58,175
<i>every parent must remember...

20
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:01,746
<i>Which toys can't be thrown away...

21
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:05,616
<i>which vegetables must not be served...

22
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:09,320
<i>which clothes should never be mended...

23
00:01:09,354 --> 00:01:14,525
<i>but the one thing every parent can forget...

24
00:01:14,559 --> 00:01:20,185
<i>is how quickly their children grow up.

25
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,335
What's going on in here?

26
00:01:24,369 --> 00:01:26,953
Uh, Lisa Ellison is pregnant,

27
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:29,289
so I'm gonna give her some baby clothes.

28
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:31,658
Paige has grown out of all her onesies.

29
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:33,093
Wow, that was fast.

30
00:01:33,127 --> 00:01:36,363
So fast. Isn't there a way
we could keep her small?

31
00:01:36,397 --> 00:01:38,265
Well, we could stop feeding her.

32
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:40,634
Then we could save money
on food and clothes.

33
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:44,336
Hey, are you okay?

34
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:47,173
Yeah, it just hit me that
this is my last onesie.

35
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:49,542
After Paige, no more babies.

36
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,477
- Isn't that what you wanted?
- Mm.

37
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:53,879
I mean, weren't you
the one who threw confetti...

38
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:55,815
after the doctor tied your tubes?

39
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:58,684
Yes, but now I'm thinking that
it's just going by too quick...

40
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,554
- Ohh.
- And before you know it,
they'll be grown, and...

41
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,201
just be you and me.

42
00:02:04,235 --> 00:02:07,037
- Yeah. You know what
the best part of that is?
- No.

43
00:02:07,071 --> 00:02:08,906
It'll just be you... and me.

44
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:12,810
What are you doing?

45
00:02:12,844 --> 00:02:14,278
Giving you...

46
00:02:14,312 --> 00:02:19,077
a preview of what
our retirement's gonna be like.

47
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,468
What about... what about the kids?

48
00:02:23,502 --> 00:02:26,871
They all left for school. I saw 'em.

49
00:02:28,841 --> 00:02:30,742
But... in the nursery?

50
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:32,811
In front of Peter Pan?

51
00:02:32,845 --> 00:02:35,046
It's about time he grew up.

52
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:45,924
<i>Yes, there are certain things
every parent must remember.

53
00:02:47,927 --> 00:02:51,989
Ohh! I... forgot Paige's doll.

54
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:55,091
I'll-I'll... I'll tell her it's dead.

55
00:02:55,525 --> 00:02:57,493
<i>Locking the door...

56
00:02:57,497 --> 00:03:00,466
<i>is one of them.

57
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:16,912
<i>It's a question we all ask ourselves.

58
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:22,851
<i>Do I trust the folks who live next door?

59
00:03:24,921 --> 00:03:28,991
<i>Can I count on the woman
who lives down the block?

60
00:03:29,025 --> 00:03:31,994
<i>Will that couple across the street

61
00:03:32,028 --> 00:03:35,297
<i>be there when I need them?

62
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:43,038
<i>Yes, good neighbors are
people we can rely on.

63
00:03:43,073 --> 00:03:44,873
<i>Great neighbors

64
00:03:44,908 --> 00:03:48,844
<i>are the ones who do exactly
what they are told.

65
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:51,847
So this is what you want me to sign?

66
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:55,084
Yes. Down at the bottom.

67
00:03:56,818 --> 00:03:58,697
Is there a problem?

68
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,832
I-I'm just a little sad, that's all.

69
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:03,020
Now, what do you have to be sad about?

70
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,134
I'm paying you well over market value.

71
00:04:05,134 --> 00:04:07,869
I know. It's just... I love the Lane.

72
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,123
Everybody's always been so kind to me.

73
00:04:10,123 --> 00:04:13,625
To just up and move at my age...

74
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,627
The neighborhood is about to change.

75
00:04:15,662 --> 00:04:18,130
In a few months,
you won't recognize this street.

76
00:04:18,164 --> 00:04:21,467
It's better to go now,
with your memories intact.

77
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,804
What do you mean, it's gonna change?

78
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:28,307
You don't have to worry about that.

79
00:04:28,341 --> 00:04:31,477
All you need to know is
that I'm helping you.

80
00:04:37,883 --> 00:04:40,202
I am so sorry. I got hung up.

81
00:04:40,202 --> 00:04:42,169
Don't worry. It's done.

82
00:04:42,204 --> 00:04:45,000
Mr. Scully sold? But...
I had a lot of details to work out.

83
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,905
I mean, length of escrow,

84
00:04:45,906 --> 00:04:47,969
- disclosure agreements...
- You'll still get your commission.

85
00:04:48,003 --> 00:04:50,605
- Okay. So... what happens now?
- Now?

86
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,610
Now I let the neighborhood in on my plan.

87
00:04:55,644 --> 00:04:57,111
Plan?

88
00:04:57,146 --> 00:05:00,014
You have a plan?

89
00:05:16,598 --> 00:05:18,565
Hi!

90
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,701
Oh, so now she knocks.

91
00:05:20,735 --> 00:05:23,871
It's Susan. I'm entering the house.

92
00:05:23,905 --> 00:05:26,573
It's okay, Susan. We are totally clothed.

93
00:05:29,677 --> 00:05:31,645
Sweetie...

94
00:05:31,679 --> 00:05:34,391
you avoided making eye contact
with us all day yesterday.

95
00:05:34,391 --> 00:05:35,720
Can we move past this?

96
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,063
Yeah, I think the only fair thing now
is for us to see you and Mike naked.

97
00:05:40,321 --> 00:05:43,924
Okay, you were right. It's not funny.

98
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,130
Yeah?

99
00:05:50,165 --> 00:05:52,166
I just want to say "congratulations."

100
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,567
For what?

101
00:05:53,601 --> 00:05:56,069
Well, I don't mean to be crass,

102
00:05:56,104 --> 00:05:58,572
but when I walked in on you guys,

103
00:05:58,606 --> 00:06:01,074
I couldn't help but notice
that Tom is quite...

104
00:06:01,109 --> 00:06:03,510
gifted.

105
00:06:03,545 --> 00:06:06,013
- Oh, that.
- "Oh, that"?

106
00:06:06,047 --> 00:06:08,682
When I opened the door,
I thought you two had company.

107
00:06:08,716 --> 00:06:11,685
I mean, I'm not sure if it
was all the tiny furniture

108
00:06:11,719 --> 00:06:14,065
in the nursery, but he looked...

109
00:06:14,065 --> 00:06:16,115
I get it, I get it.
I'm a very lucky woman.

110
00:06:16,115 --> 00:06:19,960
So why haven't you ever mentioned it
to me and the girls?

111
00:06:19,994 --> 00:06:22,529
- Mention it?
- When we went for margaritas that night

112
00:06:22,564 --> 00:06:24,531
and we all kind of told each other

113
00:06:24,566 --> 00:06:27,034
about our husbands'... accomplishments,

114
00:06:27,068 --> 00:06:30,103
how come you never told us you
were sleeping with Tommy tripod?

115
00:06:30,138 --> 00:06:34,007
Tommy tripod? How many
more of these do you have?

116
00:06:34,042 --> 00:06:36,009
Six.

117
00:06:36,044 --> 00:06:37,511
I'm serious.

118
00:06:37,545 --> 00:06:40,013
You were so tight-lipped,
that we just assumed

119
00:06:40,048 --> 00:06:42,516
that Tom was one of those, you know,

120
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,818
button-on-a-fur-coat kind of guys.

121
00:06:44,853 --> 00:06:47,321
It's just something
I don't care to advertise.

122
00:06:47,355 --> 00:06:50,858
What do I care if people
think he's got a dinky one?

123
00:06:56,397 --> 00:06:57,865
Hey, Carmen.

124
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:00,067
What's with the map?

125
00:07:00,101 --> 00:07:01,702
I just spoke to Hector.

126
00:07:01,736 --> 00:07:04,571
Oh, my God. How is he? Where is he?

127
00:07:04,606 --> 00:07:08,876
Staying with his cousins
in Sabinas... Mexico.

128
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:12,045
Grace and I will be leaving
for Texas in two days.

129
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,047
What? So soon?

130
00:07:14,082 --> 00:07:17,851
Gaby, we discussed this.
We're staying with people we know

131
00:07:17,886 --> 00:07:21,421
for a few weeks until
Hector crosses the border and joins us.

132
00:07:21,456 --> 00:07:23,390
And then what?

133
00:07:23,424 --> 00:07:26,860
I guess we'll try to get jobs,
find a place to live.

134
00:07:26,895 --> 00:07:28,362
Where? What jobs?

135
00:07:28,396 --> 00:07:30,864
You have a daughter
you're dragging into all this.

136
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:32,666
Grace is a strong girl.

137
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,670
Yes, I know, but is this
what's best for her?

138
00:07:36,704 --> 00:07:39,573
Okay, look, I'm just...
putting it out there.

139
00:07:39,607 --> 00:07:42,442
Let Grace stay here with us.

140
00:07:42,477 --> 00:07:45,746
Just until you and Hector get settled.

141
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,214
That could take months.

142
00:07:47,248 --> 00:07:50,276
I don't mind. That way
she can at least stay in school.

143
00:07:50,276 --> 00:07:52,819
She'll be safe, be with family.

144
00:07:52,854 --> 00:07:56,246
Hector and I are all the family she needs.

145
00:07:56,246 --> 00:07:58,114
She comes with me.

146
00:07:58,915 --> 00:08:01,817
Carmen, I don't mean
to make you mad. It's just I...

147
00:08:01,852 --> 00:08:04,818
I have a say in this, too.
I'm her birth mother!

148
00:08:05,023 --> 00:08:08,125
And I'm Juanita's!
Does that mean I should take her with me?

149
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:10,527
Take her where? To run? To hide?

150
00:08:10,561 --> 00:08:12,290
That's the life you're making Grace live!

151
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,919
But here, she can have anything
she wants, just like Juanita!

152
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,687
Oh, so she can become a spoiled
girl who never thinks of others,

153
00:08:18,722 --> 00:08:19,922
just like Juanita.

154
00:08:19,956 --> 00:08:22,291
Hey, there is nothing wrong with my kid.

155
00:08:22,325 --> 00:08:24,360
No, you're right.

156
00:08:24,394 --> 00:08:27,499
It's not her fault
she's being raised by a bad mother.

157
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,069
And if a life of running and hiding

158
00:08:30,103 --> 00:08:34,540
keeps that from happening to Grace,
then that's what I'll do.

159
00:08:38,144 --> 00:08:40,980
So we'll just tell people that
you slipped in the bathroom

160
00:08:41,014 --> 00:08:43,482
and bumped your head.
We're old. People expect that.

161
00:08:43,516 --> 00:08:45,918
What were you thinking with that book?

162
00:08:45,952 --> 00:08:47,639
I thought it would add a little spice.

163
00:08:47,721 --> 00:08:50,123
"Kama sutra." Kama sutures.

164
00:08:50,857 --> 00:08:52,725
Where'd that come from?

165
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:55,628
Wasn't there yesterday.

166
00:08:55,662 --> 00:08:58,873
Take these. Take these home.

167
00:08:58,873 --> 00:09:00,499
I gotta make sure people know about this.

168
00:09:00,533 --> 00:09:02,501
Go! Go, go, go, go.

169
00:09:12,944 --> 00:09:15,869
"Correctional center"? What is that, a jail?

170
00:09:15,869 --> 00:09:18,685
I called the city.
They say it's "transitional housing"

171
00:09:18,685 --> 00:09:20,660
for felons under house arrest.

172
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,994
- A halfway house for convicts,
on our street?
- Exactly.

173
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,830
I don't understand.
The city bought this house?

174
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:27,766
No. I did.

175
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,035
You're responsible for this?

176
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,536
Sure am.

177
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,505
What could you possibly be thinking?

178
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,637
The day I was released from prison,
I felt so blessed.

179
00:09:40,672 --> 00:09:42,873
I knew that I was coming home

180
00:09:42,907 --> 00:09:45,242
to the loving embrace of
this beautiful neighborhood.

181
00:09:45,276 --> 00:09:47,144
And most inmates, when they're released,

182
00:09:47,178 --> 00:09:50,896
don't have that kind of support.
Most of them are isolated,

183
00:09:50,896 --> 00:09:53,239
which leads them to commit more crimes.

184
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,575
Bringing them to a place like this,

185
00:09:55,609 --> 00:09:58,825
where they can interact with folks like you,

186
00:09:58,825 --> 00:10:00,726
might just keep a few of them

187
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,630
from making that unfortunate choice.

188
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,935
Come on, Paul. We've got children here.

189
00:10:05,969 --> 00:10:07,937
And I'm not spending my golden years

190
00:10:07,971 --> 00:10:10,871
borrowing a cup of sugar from
drug dealers and rapists.

191
00:10:10,872 --> 00:10:11,581
I'm all for charity,

192
00:10:11,581 --> 00:10:14,877
but our neighborhood
can't handle something like this.

193
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:17,747
Apparently, I have more faith
in you people than you do.

194
00:10:17,781 --> 00:10:20,349
Oh, my God.

195
00:10:20,384 --> 00:10:23,719
In a way, this halfway house
will be a testament

196
00:10:23,754 --> 00:10:28,724
to how I feel about each
and every one of you.

197
00:10:45,874 --> 00:10:48,809
Renee?

198
00:11:00,739 --> 00:11:03,241
Oh, I've really got to start knocking.

199
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:27,476
What?

200
00:11:27,476 --> 00:11:29,844
Lynette asked me to bring over
this birthday card

201
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:31,867
that got delivered to her house by mistake.

202
00:11:31,867 --> 00:11:33,902
Thanks so much. You can toss it.

203
00:11:33,936 --> 00:11:36,338
You're not gonna read it? Come on.

204
00:11:36,372 --> 00:11:39,908
Someone who loves you took
the time to send a card.

205
00:11:39,942 --> 00:11:41,810
"Happy Birthday from..."

206
00:11:41,844 --> 00:11:45,124
"Dr. Frank at Midtown Dental."

207
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:47,927
Oh, look! You're due for a cleaning.

208
00:11:47,961 --> 00:11:49,929
- Good-bye, Susan.
- No, wait.

209
00:11:49,963 --> 00:11:51,898
So it's your birthday, huh?

210
00:11:51,932 --> 00:11:54,200
Do you have something special planned?

211
00:11:54,234 --> 00:11:58,338
I haven't celebrated my birthday
since the third time I turned 28.

212
00:11:58,372 --> 00:12:00,773
Hey! What do you say you and I go out?

213
00:12:00,808 --> 00:12:02,709
No candles, no cake, no singing.

214
00:12:02,743 --> 00:12:05,445
Just enough booze to wash away the pain.

215
00:12:05,479 --> 00:12:08,414
Why do you assume I'm in pain?

216
00:12:11,385 --> 00:12:14,053
I was talking about my pain.

217
00:12:14,088 --> 00:12:17,423
I've really been missing Mike
since he's been in Alaska, and...

218
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:20,869
- ugh, I have a bunion that's bothering me...
- Fine, fine.

219
00:12:20,869 --> 00:12:24,242
We'll have dinner. Let's just make it early.

220
00:12:24,242 --> 00:12:25,874
I want to have a backup dinner lined up

221
00:12:25,874 --> 00:12:28,142
just in case this one gets too depressing.

222
00:12:28,176 --> 00:12:32,179
Oh, I promise you're gonna
have a great... time.

223
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,415
Hey, there's my favorite lawyer.

224
00:12:35,415 --> 00:12:37,850
As it happens,
I need some good legal advice.

225
00:12:37,884 --> 00:12:39,251
You mean free legal advice.

226
00:12:39,253 --> 00:12:42,221
Well, yeah. Free is good.

227
00:12:42,256 --> 00:12:45,024
So let's say hypothetically

228
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:47,293
I know a woman who's
in this country illegally.

229
00:12:47,327 --> 00:12:49,062
You mean Carmen.

230
00:12:49,096 --> 00:12:51,030
She's not the only illegal I know.

231
00:12:51,065 --> 00:12:53,433
Half of Carlos' family
scaled a fence at some point.

232
00:12:53,467 --> 00:12:57,503
Now, let's say this woman's daughter
is an American citizen.

233
00:12:57,538 --> 00:12:58,971
You mean Grace?

234
00:12:59,006 --> 00:13:00,907
Hello! Still hypothetically.

235
00:13:00,941 --> 00:13:04,850
Now, could the daughter stay
here with another family

236
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,529
if, say, somebody

237
00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:09,415
anonymously reported
the mother to immigration?

238
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,901
Yeah, as long as it's not the somebody

239
00:13:12,936 --> 00:13:15,871
who called immigration,
because hypothetically,

240
00:13:15,905 --> 00:13:17,940
she'd be burning in hell.

241
00:13:17,974 --> 00:13:19,375
Oh, come on.

242
00:13:19,409 --> 00:13:22,416
Carmen wants to drag Grace
all over Guadala-somewhere

243
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:24,880
while Hector figures out a way
to sneak back into the country.

244
00:13:24,914 --> 00:13:27,105
Gaby, you can't do this. They're a family.

245
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:29,818
Just tell me... is it legal
or not for me to keep her?

246
00:13:29,886 --> 00:13:31,253
Yes, technically, it's legal.

247
00:13:31,288 --> 00:13:33,922
But just because something's
legal doesn't make it right.

248
00:13:33,957 --> 00:13:37,226
Okay, jeez! You don't have
to jump down my throat.

249
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:40,696
Like I said, it was just... hypothetical.

250
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,436
Yeah, hi. Can I get the number

251
00:13:53,436 --> 00:13:54,969
for the immigration department, please?

252
00:13:57,205 --> 00:14:01,084
What do you want for dinner?
Pasta? Meatloaf?

253
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:03,448
I don't care. Meatloaf's good.

254
00:14:03,448 --> 00:14:07,580
Why don't you talk about my penis?

255
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,675
Excuse me?

256
00:14:09,675 --> 00:14:12,719
I overheard you and Susan talking.

257
00:14:12,753 --> 00:14:15,488
I was surprised to find you'd never...

258
00:14:15,523 --> 00:14:17,524
bragged about me.

259
00:14:17,558 --> 00:14:19,380
There's a reason
they call them private parts.

260
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,001
And why would you care anyway?

261
00:14:21,329 --> 00:14:25,144
I know what you gals talk
about when you get together.

262
00:14:25,144 --> 00:14:28,549
Gaby lets everyone know
how much money Carlos has.

263
00:14:28,549 --> 00:14:31,444
Susan talks about what a badass Mike is...

264
00:14:31,444 --> 00:14:32,209
So...

265
00:14:32,273 --> 00:14:35,149
So do I always have to be the joke?

266
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:38,068
The-the one who paid too much for the car,

267
00:14:38,068 --> 00:14:40,232
the one who cried when
the cop pulled him over...

268
00:14:40,232 --> 00:14:43,034
you don't have a problem
sharing my screwups,

269
00:14:43,068 --> 00:14:46,003
but God forbid you give me
this one little victory.

270
00:14:46,038 --> 00:14:48,472
Are we really having this conversation?

271
00:14:48,507 --> 00:14:49,941
I am just saying,

272
00:14:49,975 --> 00:14:53,578
for once it would be nice
if you gave me a little good press.

273
00:14:53,612 --> 00:14:55,146
You know,

274
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,614
tell your friends...

275
00:14:56,648 --> 00:14:58,549
what I bring to the table.

276
00:14:58,584 --> 00:15:02,053
Please don't put it on the table.

277
00:15:04,756 --> 00:15:08,113
I'm sorry. I was looking for
my contractor boyfriend,

278
00:15:08,113 --> 00:15:10,733
not a... suave international spy.

279
00:15:10,733 --> 00:15:12,634
Well, the restaurant is pretty, uh...

280
00:15:12,668 --> 00:15:15,704
How do the kids say it? Snazzy?

281
00:15:15,738 --> 00:15:18,807
You look wonderful. Hmm.

282
00:15:18,841 --> 00:15:20,308
Shall we?

283
00:15:20,343 --> 00:15:23,244
Hang on. Yeah, I just gotta
grab one thing out of my room.

284
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,880
Okay.

285
00:15:28,417 --> 00:15:32,540
Oh, hey, Bree. I heard the door.
I thought you were pizza.

286
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:36,206
Hello, Richard.
Are we going to bed or getting up?

287
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:38,109
I don't know. Let's see.

288
00:15:38,143 --> 00:15:42,980
Ahh. "Wheel of fortune." Getting up.

289
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:47,768
So how are you doing?

290
00:15:48,085 --> 00:15:50,487
Not so hot. Mary's lawyer called today.

291
00:15:50,521 --> 00:15:52,422
We're starting our divorce proceedings.

292
00:15:52,456 --> 00:15:53,890
I'm so sorry.

293
00:15:53,925 --> 00:15:55,686
Oh, the marriage has been
over for a long time,

294
00:15:55,686 --> 00:15:58,435
but I had no idea what a kick
in the gut this was gonna be.

295
00:15:58,435 --> 00:16:00,369
I guess it's just hitting me

296
00:16:00,404 --> 00:16:03,272
that I could be alone
for the rest of my life.

297
00:16:03,307 --> 00:16:05,675
Richard, that's ridiculous.
Take a look in the mirror.

298
00:16:05,709 --> 00:16:08,878
I mean, after you shower.

299
00:16:08,912 --> 00:16:15,994
You are a catch. You're smart,
adventurous, very handsome...

300
00:16:15,994 --> 00:16:17,778
For a tired old guy in his 50s...

301
00:16:17,778 --> 00:16:21,410
Stop wallowing in self-pity!
You were a major in the army.

302
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:23,515
Be strong.

303
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:25,484
The army is easy. There's structure.

304
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:27,614
They tell you what to do,
you do it. But this...

305
00:16:27,614 --> 00:16:30,650
Fine! Then I'll tell you what to do.
Turn off the tv,

306
00:16:30,684 --> 00:16:33,019
get dressed, and get out of this apartment.

307
00:16:33,053 --> 00:16:35,855
And do what?

308
00:16:52,406 --> 00:16:54,373
Ready to go?

309
00:16:54,408 --> 00:16:59,523
Change of plans.
I've invited your father to join us.

310
00:16:59,523 --> 00:17:01,490
I hope you don't mind.

311
00:17:01,525 --> 00:17:03,993
Bree could see that I'm a little down.

312
00:17:04,027 --> 00:17:06,996
No. No, it's fine.

313
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:11,200
It's not like I had
anything special planned.

314
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,568
Okay, I checked the bylaws.
We can all relax.

315
00:17:19,603 --> 00:17:22,037
Paul can't open a halfway house
on this street

316
00:17:22,072 --> 00:17:24,373
without approval from
the homeowners' association.

317
00:17:24,408 --> 00:17:26,455
And since he only has one house...

318
00:17:26,455 --> 00:17:28,700
He only gets one vote.
No way he gets a majority.

319
00:17:28,701 --> 00:17:32,222
Thank God. Let's call
a meeting of the association

320
00:17:32,222 --> 00:17:34,373
and take a vote so
we can get this over with.

321
00:17:34,373 --> 00:17:35,335
Does this seem too easy?

322
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:38,272
I mean, Paul's a smart guy.
He wouldn't pull a stunt like this

323
00:17:38,306 --> 00:17:40,007
unless he thought he could get away with it.

324
00:17:40,007 --> 00:17:42,072
I wish Mike were here.
He'd just go over there

325
00:17:42,072 --> 00:17:43,716
and scare some sense into him.

326
00:17:43,716 --> 00:17:48,615
Do we know any other macho guys
who could do the job?

327
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,183
What about Carlos?

328
00:17:50,218 --> 00:17:51,652
Oh, forget Carlos.

329
00:17:51,686 --> 00:17:54,955
We've got a guy right here
that can do the job.

330
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,034
Roy.

331
00:17:57,068 --> 00:17:59,003
Not me.

332
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:00,938
Hey, what about the gay?

333
00:18:00,972 --> 00:18:04,175
He looks like he could do some damage.

334
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:07,115
Okay. How about
I just refresh everyone's coffee?

335
00:18:07,115 --> 00:18:08,630
'Cause it looks like
that's all I'm good for.

336
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:11,768
Oh, can you be a love and
bring back more of these cookies?

337
00:18:18,589 --> 00:18:20,282
You okay?

338
00:18:20,282 --> 00:18:22,275
Bob? Roy?

339
00:18:22,275 --> 00:18:25,692
Your friends think everybody on
the street is tougher than me.

340
00:18:25,692 --> 00:18:27,372
That's ridiculous!

341
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:29,923
Hey, how about we send Lynette over there?

342
00:18:29,923 --> 00:18:32,490
- She got a set of cojones on her.
- You see?

343
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:36,033
- You see? This is all your fault!
- Wh... h-how is it my fault?

344
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:38,485
'Cause you never say anything
positive about me. God forbid

345
00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:41,644
- you talk me up, make these people
think I'm a real man.
- A real man?

346
00:18:41,644 --> 00:18:45,246
Are you suggesting we make this
meeting a forum for your talent?

347
00:18:45,246 --> 00:18:47,088
Why is it so hard for you
to say nice things about me?

348
00:18:47,088 --> 00:18:48,728
I do, all the time.

349
00:18:48,741 --> 00:18:50,140
Oh, but you prefer to emasculate me.

350
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,021
Emasculate you? No, I don't!

351
00:18:52,021 --> 00:18:54,405
- Yes, you do. Yes, you do.
- Oh, you want me to talk you up?

352
00:18:54,405 --> 00:18:56,219
- Yeah, that would be great!
- Fine! I'll talk you up.

353
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:58,278
Listen, everybody. I've got an idea.
If we need someone

354
00:18:58,278 --> 00:19:01,574
to intimidate Paul,
Tom can do it in the men's room.

355
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,359
What?

356
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:07,503
Oh, you didn't hear? Tom's packin'!

357
00:19:07,503 --> 00:19:11,820
We're talkin' big, circus big. So big,

358
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,092
he can drive in
the car pool lane when he's alone.

359
00:19:14,092 --> 00:19:14,726
L-L-Lynette...

360
00:19:14,726 --> 00:19:17,902
If it falls in the forest,
believe me... it makes a sound.

361
00:19:17,902 --> 00:19:18,568
Th-that's enough. That...

362
00:19:18,568 --> 00:19:20,633
The Washington monument
looks at it and says,

363
00:19:20,633 --> 00:19:22,209
"I want to be you when I grow up."

364
00:19:28,392 --> 00:19:30,493
Jeez, you'd think she'd smile more.

365
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,371
Grace, you want to go
to the kitchen for a little bit?

366
00:19:52,371 --> 00:19:53,426
Why?

367
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:54,803
Maybe make yourself a snack.

368
00:19:57,277 --> 00:19:59,632
You are such a brave little girl.

369
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:00,944
If anything bad ever happens,

370
00:20:00,944 --> 00:20:02,984
you are surrounded by people who love you.

371
00:20:02,984 --> 00:20:04,126
What are you talking about?

372
00:20:04,126 --> 00:20:08,110
Gaby, immigration's here.
The men who took daddy?

373
00:20:09,031 --> 00:20:11,630
Oh, don't worry, Grace.
Everything's gonna be okay.

374
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:12,710
Mama!

375
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:16,620
Grace, listen to me.
Go upstairs to Juanita's room

376
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,357
and do not move until I tell you.

377
00:20:18,357 --> 00:20:20,188
No, mama! I want to stay with you!

378
00:20:20,188 --> 00:20:21,236
I'll be fine.

379
00:20:22,692 --> 00:20:24,182
I love you.

380
00:20:25,237 --> 00:20:26,630
I love you.

381
00:20:27,557 --> 00:20:29,158
Go, go.

382
00:20:32,484 --> 00:20:34,613
These people are going to take me.

383
00:20:34,613 --> 00:20:36,236
I need you to look after my baby.

384
00:20:40,053 --> 00:20:41,559
You're not going anywhere.

385
00:20:48,598 --> 00:20:51,427
Can I help you?

386
00:20:52,046 --> 00:20:53,876
I'm Agent Jackson from I.C.E.

387
00:20:53,876 --> 00:20:56,220
We're looking for
Carmen Sanchez. Is that you?

388
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,784
Okay, Mrs. Solis,

389
00:20:57,784 --> 00:20:59,953
I'm going to the store now for oven cleaner.

390
00:20:59,953 --> 00:21:01,048
Are you Carmen Sanchez?

391
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:05,720
Ma'am, we're from U.S.
immigration and customs enforcement.

392
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,671
Ay, dios mio!

393
00:21:08,671 --> 00:21:11,318
I might be late tomorrow.

394
00:21:13,951 --> 00:21:16,207
This is lovely, Keith.

395
00:21:16,528 --> 00:21:18,241
Yeah, but it feels like something's missing.

396
00:21:18,336 --> 00:21:21,745
What is it? Oh, I know. My father.

397
00:21:21,858 --> 00:21:24,034
Oh, I'm sorry.
I know we've been having a lot of dinners

398
00:21:24,129 --> 00:21:25,504
- with him lately.
- Oh, it's okay.

399
00:21:25,569 --> 00:21:27,504
It's really sweet the way
you've been looking after him.

400
00:21:27,585 --> 00:21:30,450
- But I'm really glad it's just us tonight.
- Me, too. Mm.

401
00:21:30,593 --> 00:21:33,406
I'll check on our table.
Wanna grab me a drink?

402
00:21:33,406 --> 00:21:35,298
Yeah, whiskey up, ice water back.

403
00:21:41,372 --> 00:21:42,410
Can I help you?

404
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:45,449
Watson, party of two.
I'm the one who called earlier.

405
00:21:45,449 --> 00:21:48,616
Oh, yes, of course.
Would you like the ring delivered

406
00:21:48,616 --> 00:21:49,727
in our chocolate souffle?

407
00:21:49,727 --> 00:21:52,461
Oh, no. I'm too nervous to wait for dessert.

408
00:21:52,461 --> 00:21:53,651
How about an appetizer?

409
00:21:53,651 --> 00:21:56,107
We have the jumbo shrimp cocktail.

410
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:57,587
Not jumbo.

411
00:21:57,587 --> 00:21:59,772
I-I don't want the shrimp
to make the ring look small.

412
00:22:01,498 --> 00:22:02,312
Thank you.

413
00:22:02,312 --> 00:22:03,145
Bree?

414
00:22:03,145 --> 00:22:06,232
It's me, Tracy! Tracy Miller!

415
00:22:06,232 --> 00:22:09,816
Of course! Oh, it's been years!

416
00:22:09,816 --> 00:22:11,063
You look...

417
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:12,568
Incredible. Look at me!

418
00:22:12,568 --> 00:22:14,912
I'm a stick. I've lost a ton.

419
00:22:14,912 --> 00:22:16,103
Good for you.

420
00:22:16,103 --> 00:22:18,575
What's, uh, Adam doing these days?

421
00:22:18,575 --> 00:22:20,343
Sitting in his studio apartment

422
00:22:20,343 --> 00:22:23,950
and cursing my divorce lawyer
for taking all of his money.

423
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:26,031
I'm so sorry.

424
00:22:26,031 --> 00:22:28,064
Oh, don't be. I'm doing great.

425
00:22:28,064 --> 00:22:29,705
They're ready for us.

426
00:22:30,074 --> 00:22:32,089
Oh, my God. Is this Andrew?

427
00:22:32,168 --> 00:22:34,425
I can't believe how grown up he is.

428
00:22:34,537 --> 00:22:37,897
No, this is my boyfriend Keith.

429
00:22:37,993 --> 00:22:42,057
Wow. I guess we're both doin' great.

430
00:22:44,569 --> 00:22:47,721
After the mudslides,
there was an outbreak of cholera.

431
00:22:47,785 --> 00:22:50,234
Half my village died.

432
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:53,513
That's when we paid the coyote
to bring us over the border.

433
00:22:54,727 --> 00:22:58,072
Jeez, cholera? Getting shot at?

434
00:22:58,135 --> 00:23:00,414
Doesn't anyone have a happy story

435
00:23:00,464 --> 00:23:01,726
about coming to this country?

436
00:23:02,782 --> 00:23:06,174
Gabrielle Solis? Your husband is here.

437
00:23:06,222 --> 00:23:07,390
Oh.

438
00:23:07,485 --> 00:23:12,927
Uh, good luck. I'm sure
I'll see you all again.

439
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:14,639
You seem like a very persistent lot.

440
00:23:20,812 --> 00:23:21,666
You okay?

441
00:23:21,699 --> 00:23:23,717
As long as you're not mad at me.

442
00:23:23,762 --> 00:23:24,947
Are you kidding?

443
00:23:24,978 --> 00:23:27,761
It's a very brave thing
that you did for Carmen.

444
00:23:27,793 --> 00:23:31,251
Yeah, well, you know me,
always thinking about others.

445
00:23:32,689 --> 00:23:35,666
So where are Carmen and Grace?

446
00:23:35,698 --> 00:23:37,656
Carmen was too scared to stay at the house,

447
00:23:37,714 --> 00:23:38,898
so I put them up at a motel.

448
00:23:38,978 --> 00:23:40,868
Oh. Well, you can tell
them everything's fine.

449
00:23:40,899 --> 00:23:42,722
- They can come home now.
- Gaby...

450
00:23:42,785 --> 00:23:46,267
you just made fools out of
a U.S. government agency.

451
00:23:46,331 --> 00:23:47,883
Our house isn't safe anymore.

452
00:23:47,948 --> 00:23:50,971
Carmen and Grace are leaving
for Texas in the morning.

453
00:23:56,139 --> 00:23:57,277
Isn't this romantic?

454
00:23:57,358 --> 00:23:58,932
Like I said, I wanted this

455
00:23:58,995 --> 00:24:00,916
to be a special night for the two of us. Mm.

456
00:24:04,627 --> 00:24:06,020
Son of a bitch.

457
00:24:06,916 --> 00:24:08,834
Well, hey, you two.

458
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:11,347
Richard, hi! What are you doing here?

459
00:24:11,429 --> 00:24:13,768
I thought if Keith were bringing
a great cook like you here,

460
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,375
it's gotta be good.
So I thought I'd order some takeout.

461
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,816
Takeout. Good idea.

462
00:24:20,905 --> 00:24:21,524
Yeah.

463
00:24:21,557 --> 00:24:23,477
I thought maybe I'd, uh...

464
00:24:23,572 --> 00:24:26,358
take the food home and
eat in front of the tv.

465
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,605
Of course, it is Friday.
There's probably nothing on.

466
00:24:32,373 --> 00:24:35,500
So I... guess I'll just eat over the sink.

467
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:41,082
Well, uh, Richard, if you don't have plans,

468
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:42,493
would you like to join us?

469
00:24:42,557 --> 00:24:44,973
Of course he has plans.
Didn't you hear about the sink?

470
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:48,108
I would love to. Let me get another chair.

471
00:24:50,309 --> 00:24:52,132
What are you doing?

472
00:24:52,213 --> 00:24:53,860
The man is clearly in pain.

473
00:24:53,923 --> 00:24:56,467
It's not your responsibility
to cheer him up.

474
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,932
When he is tired of being alone,
he will meet somebody.

475
00:25:04,052 --> 00:25:07,252
Maybe sooner than you think.

476
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:11,363
Tracy, I cannot get over how great you look.

477
00:25:11,396 --> 00:25:14,340
- What is your secret?
- Revenge.

478
00:25:14,404 --> 00:25:16,997
After I lost the weight,
I took a picture of myself naked

479
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:19,957
and sent it to my ex to rub his face in it...

480
00:25:20,005 --> 00:25:22,516
or to show him what he can't rub his face in.

481
00:25:25,797 --> 00:25:27,461
Am I right?

482
00:25:28,324 --> 00:25:30,027
You know, Richard, speaking of...

483
00:25:32,228 --> 00:25:35,877
Tracy here has an incredible singing voice.

484
00:25:35,925 --> 00:25:38,373
- Oh, really?
- Yes, we met in church choir.

485
00:25:38,421 --> 00:25:40,789
Didn't you say you sang
in your church choir?

486
00:25:40,837 --> 00:25:42,165
Still do. I love it.

487
00:25:42,228 --> 00:25:44,692
Yeah, I don't sing anymore...
Or believe in God.

488
00:25:45,397 --> 00:25:47,620
- Really?
- Yeah, it's kind of hard

489
00:25:47,668 --> 00:25:50,533
to believe in a higher power
when you're on your knees

490
00:25:50,581 --> 00:25:52,320
begging for help for
your nightmare of a life,

491
00:25:52,352 --> 00:25:53,536
and you get squat!

492
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,854
So, yes, that's how we met... the choir.

493
00:26:00,854 --> 00:26:04,250
Well, Tracy, not that God needs defending,

494
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:06,149
but as someone who's been in combat,

495
00:26:06,212 --> 00:26:09,957
I have found my faith to be
a comfort in difficult times.

496
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,918
Isn't that refreshing?
A man with old-fashioned values.

497
00:26:12,998 --> 00:26:15,430
I think we should cut all
funding to the military

498
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,837
and pour it into the schools.

499
00:26:16,901 --> 00:26:19,222
I hope they'll teach
arabic in those schools.

500
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:22,492
So shall we order?

501
00:26:22,573 --> 00:26:25,580
Bree, can I talk to you for a sec?

502
00:26:30,336 --> 00:26:32,624
"Shall we order?"
Are you not sitting at that table?

503
00:26:32,689 --> 00:26:34,032
This plan of yours isn't working.

504
00:26:34,096 --> 00:26:36,006
I admit, she was much nicer
when she was fat.

505
00:26:37,041 --> 00:26:38,421
Look, you need to get them out of here.

506
00:26:38,485 --> 00:26:40,821
I have to talk to you
about something really important.

507
00:26:40,884 --> 00:26:41,479
What is it?

508
00:26:41,527 --> 00:26:44,214
I can't just blurt it out.
It needs to be done just right.

509
00:26:44,264 --> 00:26:46,634
Hey! Did anyone order a shrimp cocktail

510
00:26:46,698 --> 00:26:49,049
with a puny engagement ring on the side?

511
00:26:49,098 --> 00:26:52,089
- Oh, crap!
- Keith, what is that?

512
00:26:52,138 --> 00:26:54,042
- No, no, no. Forget you ever saw this.
- But, Keith...

513
00:26:54,106 --> 00:26:55,444
I don't wanna hear your answer, Bree.

514
00:26:55,492 --> 00:26:56,995
This is not how this is happening.

515
00:26:57,027 --> 00:27:00,083
You never should have
invited him to stay here.

516
00:27:00,131 --> 00:27:01,492
You ruined this entire thing.

517
00:27:01,523 --> 00:27:04,611
And-and so did you, and so did you!

518
00:27:11,247 --> 00:27:13,264
Well, he certainly killed the evening.

519
00:27:20,012 --> 00:27:22,230
So on Sunday, I make a big roast chicken,

520
00:27:22,231 --> 00:27:24,377
then on Monday,
I turn that into chicken salad,

521
00:27:24,378 --> 00:27:25,901
and on Tuesday, chicken soup.

522
00:27:25,902 --> 00:27:29,368
It's amazing how you can
stretch a simple chicken.

523
00:27:29,369 --> 00:27:32,110
Into a 45-minute story.

524
00:27:32,865 --> 00:27:35,284
When you said you were
the fun one on the Lane,

525
00:27:35,285 --> 00:27:37,717
who was your competition... the mailbox?

526
00:27:38,674 --> 00:27:40,274
I was just trying to cheer you up.

527
00:27:40,275 --> 00:27:41,912
Well, who said I need cheering up?

528
00:27:42,486 --> 00:27:43,510
Well...

529
00:27:46,172 --> 00:27:48,517
I saw you crying yesterday.

530
00:27:51,329 --> 00:27:54,234
For God sake. This is a pity dinner?

531
00:27:54,235 --> 00:27:56,833
No. I just... I know what
you're going through.

532
00:27:56,834 --> 00:28:00,680
Birthdays are hard,
especially when you're single.

533
00:28:01,084 --> 00:28:04,453
But I guarantee you
you're going to meet someone.

534
00:28:04,454 --> 00:28:06,658
You're a very attractive woman.

535
00:28:07,024 --> 00:28:09,071
You think that's what I was crying about?

536
00:28:11,511 --> 00:28:14,709
Hey. You find me attractive?

537
00:28:16,589 --> 00:28:17,627
Yes.

538
00:28:17,628 --> 00:28:19,117
Would you wanna go out with me?

539
00:28:20,303 --> 00:28:23,131
Yeah. But we have to be very discreet,

540
00:28:23,132 --> 00:28:24,092
because my girlfriend...

541
00:28:24,093 --> 00:28:25,931
See? I have no problem getting a guy.

542
00:28:26,595 --> 00:28:30,220
Ugh. So why the sob-fest?

543
00:28:30,221 --> 00:28:32,231
Do we really have to talk about this?

544
00:28:32,719 --> 00:28:36,057
No. On Wednesday, I made chicken potpie...

545
00:28:36,058 --> 00:28:37,646
Okay, okay.

546
00:28:37,668 --> 00:28:39,125
Here's why I was crying...

547
00:28:41,196 --> 00:28:42,937
I was thinking about this...

548
00:28:43,267 --> 00:28:45,107
great guy from my past.

549
00:28:47,073 --> 00:28:48,115
Oh.

550
00:28:49,568 --> 00:28:51,362
It was over 20 years ago.

551
00:28:51,977 --> 00:28:55,915
We only had one... weekend together, but...

552
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:58,457
the way he made me feel...

553
00:28:58,984 --> 00:29:02,260
and the older I get, I keep thinking that...

554
00:29:03,392 --> 00:29:04,823
he was the one...

555
00:29:08,018 --> 00:29:10,058
and I let him slip away.

556
00:29:11,703 --> 00:29:14,732
Well, that... that doesn't sound like you.

557
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,583
There was someone else in the picture.

558
00:29:21,592 --> 00:29:22,794
Listen...

559
00:29:24,189 --> 00:29:26,506
we never know what's going to happen.

560
00:29:27,051 --> 00:29:30,390
I mean, Mike and I had
our share of setbacks.

561
00:29:30,964 --> 00:29:32,505
But I never gave up.

562
00:29:32,893 --> 00:29:35,826
I never stopped dreaming
that maybe one day...

563
00:29:35,827 --> 00:29:37,147
it would work out.

564
00:29:37,785 --> 00:29:39,268
And neither should you.

565
00:29:43,382 --> 00:29:46,741
You know what, Susan?
I just figured out your thing.

566
00:29:47,401 --> 00:29:48,788
You aren't the fun one.

567
00:29:50,953 --> 00:29:52,139
You're the smart one.

568
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,167
Oh.

569
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:07,968
Oh, you're good. I'll give you that.

570
00:30:07,969 --> 00:30:08,920
It speaks.

571
00:30:08,921 --> 00:30:11,661
Just when I think you can't find
new ways to embarrass me,

572
00:30:11,662 --> 00:30:14,797
you top yourself. Well done, nutcracker!

573
00:30:17,303 --> 00:30:19,518
Wait a minute. Wait. Wait a minute.

574
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:20,466
We were having a discussion

575
00:30:20,467 --> 00:30:23,697
about the future of our community,
and you attacked me

576
00:30:23,698 --> 00:30:26,000
and turned it into
a referendum about your manhood.

577
00:30:26,001 --> 00:30:27,539
You know, I wish I didn't have to do that,

578
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,896
but I'm tired of all of our friends

579
00:30:28,897 --> 00:30:30,845
thinkin' that I'm just a buffoon!

580
00:30:30,846 --> 00:30:33,711
Buffoon?! Are you insane?

581
00:30:33,712 --> 00:30:36,419
Every woman on
this street constantly tells me

582
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,517
that I have the perfect husband.

583
00:30:38,631 --> 00:30:41,926
- They do not.
- They do! Gaby says that she wishes Carlos

584
00:30:41,927 --> 00:30:43,452
was thoughtful like you.

585
00:30:43,453 --> 00:30:45,847
Susan wishes Mike had your sense of humor.

586
00:30:45,848 --> 00:30:48,371
Bree says she's never seen a better dad.

587
00:30:48,372 --> 00:30:50,494
Then why do you sound annoyed by that?

588
00:30:50,495 --> 00:30:51,657
How many people go up to you

589
00:30:51,658 --> 00:30:54,126
and tell you you have the perfect wife?

590
00:30:56,483 --> 00:30:57,647
Take your time.

591
00:30:58,438 --> 00:30:59,474
Well...

592
00:30:59,907 --> 00:31:00,988
Uh, lots.

593
00:31:00,989 --> 00:31:04,195
Oh, wrong. I know how our friends see us...

594
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:07,647
you're the hardworking,
nice guy, and I am the bitch.

595
00:31:07,648 --> 00:31:10,516
I am the one who's constantly
emasculating her husband.

596
00:31:10,517 --> 00:31:12,609
I'm the one who can't wait
to get away from her kids

597
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:15,213
- and go back to work.
- No. People don't say that.

598
00:31:15,214 --> 00:31:19,189
See? You are so nice,
you can't even tell me the truth.

599
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:20,764
For almost 20 years,

600
00:31:20,765 --> 00:31:24,465
all I've heard is how incredibly lucky I am

601
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:25,894
to have a guy like you.

602
00:31:25,895 --> 00:31:30,162
So if I don't constantly
brag about how great you are,

603
00:31:30,163 --> 00:31:33,181
it's only because I don't wanna be reminded

604
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:35,391
of how much I don't deserve you.

605
00:31:43,504 --> 00:31:45,986
You know, I'm the one

606
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:48,770
who should be bragging to all the neighbors,

607
00:31:49,542 --> 00:31:53,213
telling them how lucky
I am to be married to a woman

608
00:31:53,214 --> 00:31:57,306
who's still... sexy as all get out...

609
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,263
who makes me laugh...

610
00:32:02,949 --> 00:32:04,721
and whose heart is so big,

611
00:32:04,944 --> 00:32:08,332
that even after raising five children...

612
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:12,841
she still cries when she has
to pack away the last onesie.

613
00:32:14,261 --> 00:32:15,654
I didn't cry.

614
00:32:17,575 --> 00:32:19,356
Okay, I teared up a bit.

615
00:32:27,132 --> 00:32:28,957
You know what I'm in the mood to do?

616
00:32:30,483 --> 00:32:32,733
I have an idea. Hmm.

617
00:32:32,739 --> 00:32:35,320
It did everything but
tap me on the shoulder.

618
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:47,728
And that's how you get out
of payin' for a taxi.

619
00:32:47,773 --> 00:32:50,344
Well, we weren't in a taxi.
We were in my car.

620
00:32:50,489 --> 00:32:52,706
But now I know why you showed me your boobs.

621
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,358
Okay, that's a lot of stairs.

622
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:57,385
How does sleeping on the couch sound?

623
00:32:57,386 --> 00:32:58,774
You know something?

624
00:32:59,169 --> 00:33:03,136
I told Lynette you were
this mousy little loser.

625
00:33:03,137 --> 00:33:05,562
Actually, you told that to me.

626
00:33:05,563 --> 00:33:07,462
Oh, I'm sorry.

627
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:10,379
'Cause I really like you now. You're nice...

628
00:33:10,664 --> 00:33:12,596
much nicer than that Susan.

629
00:33:15,154 --> 00:33:16,317
Okay.

630
00:33:17,584 --> 00:33:18,901
Nighty-night.

631
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:23,557
You gonna be okay?

632
00:33:23,575 --> 00:33:25,924
Mm, I thought I was.

633
00:33:26,969 --> 00:33:28,842
I thought I could live down
the street from him,

634
00:33:28,843 --> 00:33:30,910
but it's so hard.

635
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:35,506
Wait. The guy you're in love with...

636
00:33:35,808 --> 00:33:37,163
He lives here?

637
00:33:37,698 --> 00:33:38,700
Yeah.

638
00:33:39,848 --> 00:33:41,068
Tom.

639
00:33:43,003 --> 00:33:44,077
Tom?

640
00:33:45,548 --> 00:33:47,130
Tom Scavo?

641
00:33:47,903 --> 00:33:49,035
Yeah.

642
00:33:50,105 --> 00:33:52,231
Oh, the love of my life.

643
00:34:04,862 --> 00:34:07,162
Hey, Richard. I was looking
for Keith. Is he here?

644
00:34:07,729 --> 00:34:09,373
No, he went for a walk.

645
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:12,158
You wanna wait for him?

646
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,482
If you don't mind.

647
00:34:16,264 --> 00:34:19,718
I am so sorry that I ruined your evening.

648
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:22,203
Well, to be fair, you had some help.

649
00:34:22,988 --> 00:34:25,357
Still, if I had any idea
he was gonna propose...

650
00:34:25,782 --> 00:34:27,977
No one was more surprised than me.

651
00:34:29,314 --> 00:34:32,498
This is none of my business,
but if he'd pulled it off,

652
00:34:32,515 --> 00:34:33,821
what would you have said?

653
00:34:36,321 --> 00:34:39,887
Speaking as your prospective
father-in-law, of course.

654
00:34:40,848 --> 00:34:43,320
Um... I don't know.

655
00:34:43,321 --> 00:34:45,304
It's all a little... sudden.

656
00:34:45,305 --> 00:34:48,545
Yeah, that's Keith.
He's always been an impulsive kid.

657
00:34:48,546 --> 00:34:50,308
Never really thinks things through.

658
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:52,098
Well, actually, his spontaneity

659
00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:53,885
is one of the things I love about him.

660
00:34:57,104 --> 00:34:58,376
Can I be honest with you?

661
00:34:59,651 --> 00:35:05,840
I... would never...
put you and Keith together.

662
00:35:05,959 --> 00:35:06,848
Oh?

663
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,511
Yeah, I see you with someone...

664
00:35:09,512 --> 00:35:11,268
steady. More...

665
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:13,847
reliable.

666
00:35:13,905 --> 00:35:18,289
Someone who shares your faith,
your old-fashioned values.

667
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,473
Someone more your own age?

668
00:35:28,999 --> 00:35:32,242
Well, that being said,
I really do love your son.

669
00:35:33,791 --> 00:35:37,336
Oh, hey, I-I love him, too.
Like I said, he's a great kid.

670
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:45,504
I should go.

671
00:35:48,267 --> 00:35:49,346
Really?

672
00:35:51,134 --> 00:35:52,950
Please tell him that I stopped by.

673
00:36:03,664 --> 00:36:06,014
It's been so wonderful getting to know you.

674
00:36:06,349 --> 00:36:08,126
You, too, Mrs. Solis.

675
00:36:11,948 --> 00:36:13,131
What are you doing?

676
00:36:14,106 --> 00:36:15,920
Memorizing your face.

677
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:18,638
Texas is far away,

678
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:20,367
and I don't know when
I'm gonna see you again.

679
00:36:21,156 --> 00:36:22,423
Maybe someday.

680
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,457
Yeah, maybe someday.

681
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:28,472
Can I tell you something, Grace?

682
00:36:30,082 --> 00:36:31,691
I grew up just like you.

683
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:34,797
I didn't have a lot of pretty things.

684
00:36:36,355 --> 00:36:38,244
But I never let that stop me

685
00:36:38,486 --> 00:36:40,917
from going after any dream I wanted.

686
00:36:42,738 --> 00:36:44,311
So you remember that, okay?

687
00:36:45,003 --> 00:36:46,858
- Okay.
- Gaby...

688
00:36:48,469 --> 00:36:49,695
They need to go.

689
00:36:53,539 --> 00:36:55,508
Oh, I wish you could stay with us.

690
00:36:59,695 --> 00:37:00,848
Gaby...

691
00:37:01,684 --> 00:37:04,156
Oh. Okay.

692
00:37:17,017 --> 00:37:20,298
I'm sorry about what I said
about Juanita the other day.

693
00:37:21,009 --> 00:37:22,416
Don't worry about it.

694
00:37:25,188 --> 00:37:26,542
We should go.

695
00:37:26,618 --> 00:37:27,754
Carmen...

696
00:37:29,548 --> 00:37:30,692
Thank you.

697
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,912
Thank you for taking care of my baby.

698
00:37:38,972 --> 00:37:41,948
Thank you for taking care of mine.

699
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:08,357
Oh, God.

700
00:38:14,921 --> 00:38:17,272
Hey, everybody quiet down.
This shouldn't take too long.

701
00:38:17,273 --> 00:38:20,064
We only have one order of
business on the agenda tonight,

702
00:38:20,065 --> 00:38:22,305
and that is the new halfway house...

703
00:38:23,464 --> 00:38:25,356
that is scheduled to open in the property

704
00:38:25,357 --> 00:38:27,041
owned by Paul Young...

705
00:38:27,042 --> 00:38:29,742
So let's jump right to the vote.

706
00:38:29,743 --> 00:38:32,142
All those opposed to the halfway house?

707
00:38:33,113 --> 00:38:35,411
Madame chairwoman? Point of order.

708
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:37,158
According to our bylaws,

709
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:39,508
we have to have a 48-hour
notice before a vote.

710
00:38:39,509 --> 00:38:41,160
We'll still vote the same way in two days,

711
00:38:41,161 --> 00:38:43,523
- and you'll still lose.
- Yeah, that'll be 14 to 1.

712
00:38:43,524 --> 00:38:44,694
Then we'll take another vote to

713
00:38:44,695 --> 00:38:47,767
- kick you off the street.
- That'll be 14 to 1, too.

714
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:53,051
You might wanna check your math.
I have at least seven votes.

715
00:38:54,988 --> 00:38:56,558
How do you figure that?

716
00:38:57,054 --> 00:38:59,262
With the acquisition of Mr. Scully's place,

717
00:38:59,263 --> 00:39:01,746
I now own seven houses on Wisteria Lane.

718
00:39:05,112 --> 00:39:06,178
What?

719
00:39:07,174 --> 00:39:09,768
I used the settlement I got
from my wrongful incarceration

720
00:39:09,769 --> 00:39:12,331
to acquire the extra property.
Didn't I, Lee?

721
00:39:15,756 --> 00:39:17,218
You knew about this?

722
00:39:17,771 --> 00:39:20,417
He was my realtor.
Couldn't have done it without him.

723
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:22,940
He just hired me. I didn't know he was evil.

724
00:39:23,221 --> 00:39:25,737
How much money did you make
from these deals, anyway?

725
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:26,909
Not that much.

726
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:32,730
So that's why you tried to buy my house.

727
00:39:34,418 --> 00:39:36,017
You never told us about that.

728
00:39:36,018 --> 00:39:39,575
Well, I made it pretty clear
how I felt about his offer.

729
00:39:39,701 --> 00:39:41,212
Well, none of this matters.

730
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:43,691
Seven houses isn't enough to win the vote.

731
00:39:44,184 --> 00:39:45,786
That's an excellent point, Gaby.

732
00:39:45,978 --> 00:39:47,366
I need one more.

733
00:39:47,704 --> 00:39:49,862
And since this halfway house
means a lot to me,

734
00:39:50,387 --> 00:39:51,798
I intend to get it.

735
00:39:53,228 --> 00:39:55,096
Well, we're not gonna sell to you.

736
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:58,358
I don't need all of you to sell, just one.

737
00:39:58,904 --> 00:40:00,703
So if you're sure it won't happen,

738
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:02,189
there won't be a problem.

739
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:03,977
But if someone should sell...

740
00:40:04,305 --> 00:40:06,483
you'll have hardened
criminals on this street.

741
00:40:07,129 --> 00:40:09,532
And what do you think that
will do to your property values?

742
00:40:11,167 --> 00:40:12,361
Oh, my God.

743
00:40:12,362 --> 00:40:15,196
- You can't scare us.
- Well, maybe not you, Carlos. You're rich.

744
00:40:15,197 --> 00:40:17,776
But what about, uh, Mitzi Kinsky?

745
00:40:18,663 --> 00:40:19,957
What about me?

746
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,990
We all know you've been laid off.

747
00:40:22,244 --> 00:40:25,149
I can offer you well above market value.

748
00:40:28,522 --> 00:40:29,995
Or you, Mrs. McCluskey?

749
00:40:29,996 --> 00:40:33,144
I bet your entire life savings
is tied up in your home.

750
00:40:33,935 --> 00:40:36,465
And, Susan, my offer still stands.

751
00:40:36,466 --> 00:40:37,999
We all know Mike had to go to Alaska

752
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,871
because of your financial problems.

753
00:40:40,013 --> 00:40:41,829
But if you lose half
the equity in your house,

754
00:40:42,272 --> 00:40:44,023
will he ever be able to come back?

755
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,996
How much above market value?

756
00:40:52,997 --> 00:40:53,982
Mitzi!

757
00:40:53,983 --> 00:40:55,426
Look, I don't wanna sell,

758
00:40:55,427 --> 00:40:57,037
but if somebody else does, I'm screwed!

759
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:58,909
No one else is gonna sell.

760
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:01,777
- We have to stick together.
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

761
00:41:01,778 --> 00:41:04,988
- What's with all the whispering?
- This is private. Do you mind?

762
00:41:04,989 --> 00:41:08,100
Yes, I do. We're all waiting for
you to tell Paul to shove it.

763
00:41:08,101 --> 00:41:10,505
We're just trying to figure
out how to handle this.

764
00:41:10,506 --> 00:41:12,365
There is nothing to figure out.

765
00:41:12,366 --> 00:41:14,689
Hey, moneybags, don't yell at her!

766
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:15,958
This is exactly what he's trying to do!

767
00:41:15,959 --> 00:41:17,290
I am not yelling.
I am simply trying to explain...

768
00:41:17,291 --> 00:41:18,262
He's trying to turn
the whole Lane against...

769
00:41:18,263 --> 00:41:19,170
What the hell were you thinking?

770
00:41:19,171 --> 00:41:20,225
Well, I didn't know what he was up to.

771
00:41:20,226 --> 00:41:22,031
You sold him seven houses.

772
00:41:22,032 --> 00:41:23,524
You didn't think that was a little strange?

773
00:41:23,525 --> 00:41:25,395
This is not his fault,
so just back the hell off.

774
00:41:25,396 --> 00:41:28,340
Okay, guys. Come on, everybody. Calm down.

775
00:41:32,195 --> 00:41:34,727
We're not gonna let you destroy this street.

776
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:36,248
I don't have to.

777
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:38,386
You're going to do it yourselves.

778
00:41:40,925 --> 00:41:44,507
<i>It's a question we all ask ourselves...

779
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:50,217
<i>do I trust the people who live next door?

780
00:41:53,296 --> 00:41:55,815
<i>Will that couple across the street

781
00:41:55,836 --> 00:41:58,270
<i>be there when I need them?

782
00:42:00,462 --> 00:42:04,386
<i>Can I count on the woman
who lives down the block?

783
00:42:06,152 --> 00:42:10,916
<i>Yes, good neighbors are
people we can rely on.

784
00:42:12,317 --> 00:42:16,450
<i>But if we discover
our neighbors can't be trusted,

785
00:42:17,298 --> 00:42:18,988
<i>then it may be...

786
00:42:20,285 --> 00:42:21,953
<i>time to move.
</i>
