1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:03,649
Previously on...

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:06,820
Susan showed a certain
flair for her new job.

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:10,389
There you go. You know,
you're getting good at this.

4
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:12,249
Renee rented a house.

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,210
- Wow, that is so...
- Wonderful?

6
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:16,629
Close.

7
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,020
There's something I have to tell you.

8
00:00:18,021 --> 00:00:19,250
Gaby learned the truth

9
00:00:19,251 --> 00:00:22,120
about her daughter
being switched at birth.

10
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:23,169
Beth!

11
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:26,269
Paul Young continued to surprise everyone.

12
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:28,690
Well, I see you've all met my wife.

13
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,370
And Tom came home
with a mysterious affliction.

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,219
I'm not feeling well.

15
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,099
Again?

16
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,070
I'm just gonna lie on
the couch and watch some TV.

17
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,830
Tom Scavo was depressed,

18
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,189
and his wife had done everything she could

19
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:53,710
to cheer him up.

20
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:58,340
She had made his favorite meals.

21
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,910
She had told her funniest jokes.

22
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:09,600
She'd even worn her sexiest lingerie.

23
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,840
But nothing worked.

24
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:20,930
Finally, Lynette insisted
her husband to go to the doctor.

25
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,920
Unfortunately, what he came home with

26
00:01:25,921 --> 00:01:29,210
was a prescription... for trouble.

27
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:30,939
Antianxiety medication?

28
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,749
This is what he gave you?

29
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:36,789
- Dr. Weiler says it will help.
- He spent 20 minutes with you.

30
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,540
- Lynette...
- And let me guess. Did he write this

31
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:39,870
with a pen that has the drug

32
00:01:39,871 --> 00:01:43,129
- company's name on it?
- I need this medicine.

33
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:45,979
Then take it, but I gotta tell ya,

34
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,810
those drugs scare the crap out of me.

35
00:01:47,811 --> 00:01:51,339
I gotta do something.
I am so tired of feeling this way.

36
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,399
But you've gone
through rough patches before.

37
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,550
You could come out of it.

38
00:01:54,551 --> 00:01:58,599
So wait around to get better?
That's your answer?

39
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,939
You don't know
what it's like inside my head!

40
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:03,320
Okay, you're right. I'm sorry. Hey! Hey!

41
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:08,589
Remember when Susan kept having
all those headaches?

42
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,549
Who was that guy that she went to?

43
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,439
Doctor... Dr. Ross.

44
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,219
- How is he gonna be any different?
- He's holistic.

45
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,449
He tries to stay away from heavy meds.
Susan loved him.

46
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,689
And if he says I should be on this?

47
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:22,960
Then you have a second opinion.

48
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,600
Whatever he says, I'll go with it.

49
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,840
Shh. Shh. Shh.

50
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,650
Well...

51
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,449
I saw Dr. Ross.

52
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,250
Oh! I'm so glad.

53
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,460
Did you like him?

54
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,290
Loved him.

55
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,719
And you were right.

56
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,590
He... he doesn't believe
in pharmaceuticals.

57
00:02:49,591 --> 00:02:53,119
He only prescribes stuff
that's totally herbal and natural.

58
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,199
That is fantastic.

59
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,910
So what did he suggest?

60
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,470
Medical marijuana.

61
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:03,280
Yes,

62
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:07,150
Tom Scavo had been battling depression,

63
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,630
but he was now facing a much bigger battle

64
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,690
with his wife.

65
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,570
Happiness...

66
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,380
it's something we all want,

67
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,830
and so we search for it.

68
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,820
Little girls find it
in the taste of chocolate.

69
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:46,600
Well-dressed men discover it
at their local mall.

70
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,159
Teenage boys experience it

71
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,740
when talking to a pretty girl.

72
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,379
And then there are housewives,

73
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,309
who simply can't be happy

74
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,910
until they've learned everything they can

75
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,730
about the newest neighbor on the block.

76
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,810
Hello!

77
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:15,569
Hi. So sorry to interrupt.
This will just take a second.

78
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:18,759
We wanted to officially welcome
you to the neighborhood.

79
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,389
- Oh!
- This is my friend Lynette and Susan,

80
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,669
and I was telling them
about you, and we...

81
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,980
- Just had to meet you.
- Immediately.

82
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,679
That's so sweet.

83
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,229
Oh, you... you're my landlady, right?

84
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:33,240
Yes, but I really want you
to think of me as a friend.

85
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,000
Are those pictures hung on
the wall with nails or...

86
00:04:36,001 --> 00:04:38,679
Um, we wanted to invite you
to our weekly poker game.

87
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,289
Shoot. I don't know how to play poker.

88
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,910
Oh, don't worry. We'll teach you.

89
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,670
Does that ficus tree
have a saucer underneath?

90
00:04:45,671 --> 00:04:46,940
Because those are hardwood floors.

91
00:04:46,941 --> 00:04:48,970
And while you're learning
all about Texas Hold'em,

92
00:04:48,971 --> 00:04:50,450
we'll learn all about you.

93
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,130
Aw! That sounds fun.

94
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,839
Okay, well, uh, we should be going.
We'll see you later.

95
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,610
Okay.

96
00:05:02,611 --> 00:05:04,240
- Bye.
- Bye.

97
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,080
What did those women want?

98
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,750
They invited me to play cards with them.

99
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,789
But they were just being friendly.

100
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,020
On this street,

101
00:05:17,021 --> 00:05:20,330
never confuse being nosy
with being friendly.

102
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,480
They were digging for dirt.

103
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,630
So...

104
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:26,979
do you not want me to go?

105
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,770
No, no. You will go.

106
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:32,180
Give them all sorts
of meaningless information.

107
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,629
And hopefully, they'll start
to think of you as a friend.

108
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:38,370
But... if you don't like them,

109
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:41,190
why do you want me
to be friends with them?

110
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:44,460
In time, it will be useful.

111
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,419
- Where's the pen?
- Don't you wanna read it first?

112
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,740
Why? Did a nurse get drunk

113
00:05:58,741 --> 00:06:00,640
and swap it with a different document?

114
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,259
By signing this,
Mr. Solis, you are agreeing

115
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:06,059
not to bring any legal action
against this hospital.

116
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,140
Do you understand?

117
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,909
And in return, you'll stop searching
for the other family.

118
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,870
Do you understand?

119
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,730
Done. Gaby.

120
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,640
Babe, we talked about this.

121
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:28,499
We don't know
how this other family will react,

122
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,650
and we need to protect Juanita.

123
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:32,880
I am sorry, Gabrielle.

124
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,480
I can only imagine how you must feel.

125
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,100
You can't begin to imagine how I feel.

126
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:45,400
The only person who could is
the woman who has my daughter.

127
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,439
If signing can spare her this pain...

128
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,030
then I will do it.

129
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,510
I love it!

130
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,349
Somehow I get the feeling
you don't love it.

131
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:08,969
Okay, I-I don't love it. It's just so...

132
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:09,889
yellow.

133
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:12,620
Trust me. This will be great.

134
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:14,629
Besides, when you're in the room,

135
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:17,420
nobody's looking at the walls anyway.

136
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,740
Well, you certainly know
how to sell yellow.

137
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:23,830
Excuse me.

138
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:29,200
I hear you're gettin' divorced.

139
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,870
And good morning to you.

140
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,159
I'm getting divorced, too,
so we both need guys.

141
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,630
I'm thinking we should hang.

142
00:07:38,631 --> 00:07:40,970
Uh, I don't know
how much Lynette has told you about me,

143
00:07:40,971 --> 00:07:43,139
but I'm really not one for... hanging.

144
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,649
Look, one woman at a bar is just sad.

145
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,729
But two, and it's girls' night out.

146
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:49,029
So what do you say?

147
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:51,120
You up for a little stud hunting?

148
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:54,369
That's a lovely offer,
but I think I'm gonna pass.

149
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:55,689
Oh, come on.

150
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,439
We gotta get back in the game,

151
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,160
cut loose, let our hair down.

152
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,670
That hair does come down, doesn't it?

153
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:07,079
Really, Renee, that is just not
how I like to meet men.

154
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,050
Well, how else you gonna meet 'em,
sittin' around your house?

155
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,720
You'd be surprised.

156
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,489
You've met someone already?

157
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:19,480
Maybe.

158
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,800
Wow.

159
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,039
A beautiful, classy woman

160
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,670
who can get a man
without leaving the house.

161
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,360
I don't see us being friends.

162
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,259
I don't know

163
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:39,960
how everything gets so dirty in here.

164
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,119
Uh-oh!

165
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,800
Is that a piece of lint?

166
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,199
Oh, no!

167
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,220
It got my apron!

168
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:57,179
I'd better sign off
before I'm completely naked.

169
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,530
See you tomorrow, boys.

170
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,190
I'm busy!

171
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,619
Honey, it's Maxine!

172
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,710
Oh!

173
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:13,400
A star is born!

174
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,019
Did you watch?

175
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,789
Oh, not only did I watch, I kvelled.

176
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,220
Oh! I have to admit,
I am sort of getting into it.

177
00:09:20,221 --> 00:09:22,180
That whole thing
with the vacuum just came to me.

178
00:09:22,181 --> 00:09:25,890
Well, that's how it happens
with the great ones. Oops.

179
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,400
Here's a bonus for you.

180
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,049
Whoa!

181
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,190
What's this for?

182
00:09:31,191 --> 00:09:32,480
Well, it's a little something I do

183
00:09:32,481 --> 00:09:35,559
for the girl who gets
the most hits in a month.

184
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,929
You just unseated Stacy Strauss,

185
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:40,899
and with the caboose on her,
that's not easy.

186
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,590
- Oh, Maxine. You're so good to me.
- Oh, honey.

187
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:44,910
- Mmm.
- You know what?

188
00:09:44,911 --> 00:09:47,599
Mike and I are finally starting
to save some money.

189
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,029
Well, don't save it all.
Buy yourself something nice.

190
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:53,569
You deserve it. Oh, by the way,

191
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:56,710
have you decided what
you're gonna do for tomorrow's show?

192
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:58,999
I'm gonna damp mop in bikini briefs.

193
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,250
Ooh! Are you trying to make me cry?

194
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,150
Bye, doll.

195
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,880
This is a great sandwich.

196
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,200
What's in it?

197
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,989
Oh, it's nothing.

198
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:15,419
Just a little Parma ham
cured by Italian monks

199
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,389
and some cave-aged gruyère,

200
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,340
and of course I make my own fig mustard.

201
00:10:19,341 --> 00:10:21,319
Cooking is a passion of mine.

202
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,919
Of course, it's not much fun
cooking for one,

203
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,019
so, um, if you're free this weekend...

204
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:30,399
Babe, you gotta try
this sandwich. It rocks.

205
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,319
This is my boss, Mrs. Van De Kamp.

206
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,080
This is Stephanie, my girlfriend.

207
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,330
You have a girlfriend?

208
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,460
Of course you have a...

209
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,769
a girlfriend who's young and pretty.

210
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:44,100
Nice to meet you.

211
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:47,319
I'm sorry, Bree.
What were you about to ask me?

212
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,860
Oh, it's, uh, wasn't important.

213
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:53,160
You enjoy your sandwich.

214
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,620
Inside, over there.

215
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:03,220
Let the stud hunt begin.

216
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,590
Come on. Come on. We're gonna get started.

217
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,060
You okay?

218
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,010
Oh. Yeah.

219
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:22,910
Yeah.

220
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:24,789
Let's play cards.

221
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:28,349
When I was 8, daddy left mama,
and we were pretty much alone.

222
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:31,219
Most of my friends were
either stuffed or plastic.

223
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,569
Of course, there were
always mama's boyfriends,

224
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:35,140
but as soon as I'd learn their names,

225
00:11:35,141 --> 00:11:36,050
mama would kick them out,

226
00:11:36,051 --> 00:11:37,980
and there'd be
a new toothbrush in the bathroom.

227
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,989
Uh, l-let me know if I'm sharing too much.

228
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:44,130
No. Not at all.

229
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,400
Keep pouring the chardonnay.

230
00:11:46,401 --> 00:11:47,780
She's cracking like an egg.

231
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,940
Okay, quarter ante.

232
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:53,369
So, Beth, how did you
and Paul meet anyway?

233
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:55,299
Oh, I don't wanna bore you.

234
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,039
We won't be bored. More chardonnay?

235
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:58,910
Mm.

236
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:03,849
Well... I saw his picture
in the paper during his trial,

237
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,869
and there was just
something about those eyes

238
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,290
that spoke to me.

239
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,689
What about the headline?

240
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:12,219
"Arrested for murder"...
that didn't speak to you?

241
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,269
I'll admit that gave me pause.

242
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:16,539
But then we started corresponding,

243
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,590
and I discovered

244
00:12:17,591 --> 00:12:20,759
what a wonderful man Paul really is.

245
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,289
Bree, let's forget about hittin'
the clubs tomorrow night.

246
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,839
Clearly, all the best guys
are on death row.

247
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,380
But, hey, you can't help
who you fall in love with, right?

248
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,460
And Paul's a real lady-killer.

249
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,620
We... we always fogged up
the plexiglas with that one.

250
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,510
Well, it's good
that you can laugh about it.

251
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,860
The thing is,

252
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,390
in my heart, I always knew
he was innocent,

253
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,150
and I was right.

254
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,150
Well, he is.

255
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,870
Yeah, so let's play cards.

256
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,510
What are you doing?

257
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,760
Preparing to take my medicine.

258
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,140
I've heard that an increase in appetite's

259
00:13:18,141 --> 00:13:19,270
a possible side effect,

260
00:13:19,271 --> 00:13:21,270
so I'm taking the necessary precautions.

261
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:24,010
Necessary precautions being
your own weight in cheese doodles?

262
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,670
I never smoked pot before,
so I wanna be prepared.

263
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:30,780
Headphones?

264
00:13:30,781 --> 00:13:31,600
Pink Floyd.

265
00:13:31,601 --> 00:13:34,090
Apparently, it complements
the medicinal properties

266
00:13:34,091 --> 00:13:35,030
of, uh...

267
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,890
blueberry bliss.

268
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,909
Listen to you.

269
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:41,059
You are loving this.

270
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,639
Tom the college nerd

271
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,989
gets to finally smoke pot and be cool.

272
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,719
Hey, I was plenty cool in college.

273
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,500
The only reason I didn't smoke back then

274
00:13:49,501 --> 00:13:51,390
was because I signed the abstinence pledge

275
00:13:51,391 --> 00:13:53,100
with my Dungeons & Dragons club.

276
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,250
So... what do you say?

277
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,229
Care to join me out back behind the garage

278
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,940
for a little doobage?

279
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,280
"Doobage"?

280
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,749
That's what you're calling
your medicine now?

281
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,379
Come on. You need to take this seriously.

282
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,360
I-I am.

283
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,179
Really? 'Cause I'm pretty sure
I've never asked you

284
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:17,100
to join me behind
the garage to split a midol.

285
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,629
Lynette, you said you would go with this.

286
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:22,499
I know, but how is it gonna look
to the kids?

287
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,929
I don't want them seeing their dad stoned.

288
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:28,630
Oh, you... you don't have to worry
about them seeing me stoned.

289
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,900
They'll never know.

290
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,200
Hey, the...

291
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:58,980
Okay.

292
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,060
So what do you wanna do saturday night?

293
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,310
Well, I was thinking

294
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,960
that we could go to Chez Naomi.

295
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,650
Isn't our price range
more Chez chicken hut?

296
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,340
Mike, it's our anniversary.

297
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,960
Besides, we've been working
really hard. We deserve it.

298
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,799
Okay, but bring your big purse

299
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,200
'cause we're taking the dinner rolls home.

300
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:26,830
So...

301
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,510
Chez Naomi, huh?

302
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,040
Expensive place.

303
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,660
Yeah. Yeah, I guess it is.

304
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,320
Must be nice.

305
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,420
Um, have we met?

306
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,890
I'm in 1b. Susan Delfino.

307
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,530
Oh, I know who you are.

308
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,280
I'm 1f.

309
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:46,580
Stacy Strauss.

310
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,819
Uh, y-you're one of Maxine's...

311
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,590
Yeah.

312
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,870
Oh, well, it's nice to meet you.

313
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:55,370
Guess we...

314
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,590
kind of do the same thing.

315
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,700
Oh, sometimes we do
exactly the same thing.

316
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:02,710
What does that mean?

317
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,110
I keep an eye on the competition.

318
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,940
You lifted one of my moves.

319
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,980
- No, I didn't.
- You expect me to believe
you just woke up one day

320
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:13,390
- and decided to put
a feather duster in your mouth?
- You do that?

321
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,730
It's my signature bit, and you stole it.

322
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:19,710
I swear. I...

323
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:22,410
I-I don't watch the other girls perform.

324
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,170
Okay, so I guess it's just a coincidence.

325
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,420
Well, here's another coincidence...

326
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,540
you're getting the big bonus check,
and I'm not.

327
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,349
That's not... really
what you'd call a coincidence.

328
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,100
- That's really more...
- All right, college.

329
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,890
Just keep the duster out of your mouth.

330
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,520
And watch your back.

331
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:52,490
Everything okay?

332
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:54,640
Oh, yeah.

333
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:58,880
I am wasted.

334
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,610
Really?

335
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:07,180
I am Lucy in the sky high.

336
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:11,870
So...

337
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,040
this must be pretty intense for you.

338
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,170
And don't forget

339
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:22,280
tomorrow we have to
trombone 3-d banana patch.

340
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,300
Remember?

341
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,000
Man, this is, uh, really strong stuff.

342
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,980
Snow shovel.

343
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:32,390
Exactly.

344
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:38,430
You know, I was just upstairs
watching Paige sleep,

345
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:41,850
with her little fingers
and her little toes.

346
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:45,280
I-I must've watched her for,
like, an hour.

347
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,080
She's just so perfect.

348
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,980
And I am so lucky.

349
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:54,110
I couldn't feel happier
than I do right now.

350
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,260
I mean just so happy it's working.

351
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:59,150
Yeah.

352
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,109
What do you think? Does this say

353
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,210
"happy anniversary, Mike.
I'll love you forever"?

354
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:09,889
No. I think it says
"credit card declined."

355
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,010
Aren't you and Mike on a budget?

356
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:15,430
Yeah, but things are starting
to turn around lately.

357
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,640
I've been selling a lot of my jewelry.

358
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:18,740
Get out!

359
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,540
Out there and keep selling.

360
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,730
Oh, hello, silk!

361
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,530
Oh, how I've missed your soft touch.

362
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,530
I'm going to the dressing room.

363
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,000
Mm, you two have fun.

364
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:35,830
Mommy?

365
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,940
Oh. You're not my mommy.

366
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:40,820
Are you lost, sweetie? What's your name?

367
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:44,590
Kiki! You scared me! I couldn't find you.

368
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,070
I have a little girl, too.

369
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,400
Sometimes they get distracted
and wander off.

370
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:50,380
Let's go.

371
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:54,130
Wait!

372
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,910
- How old is she?
- 8.

373
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,070
My daughter's 8.

374
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,630
When's your birthday?

375
00:19:03,631 --> 00:19:04,870
Uh, we've really gotta go.

376
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,740
Uh, okay, but, uh,
what hospital was she born in?

377
00:19:07,741 --> 00:19:08,910
Was it Fairview Memorial?

378
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:26,650
Standing there in the mall,
it just hit me.

379
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:29,169
I can't spend the rest of my life

380
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:31,810
wondering if every little girl
I see is my daughter.

381
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:33,670
Not knowing where she is,

382
00:19:33,671 --> 00:19:36,130
it... it's like my heart
living outside of my body.

383
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,720
I have to find her.

384
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,399
Well, there's a private detective
I work with.

385
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,950
But Sanchez is a pretty common name.

386
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,860
It's not surprising
the hospital couldn't find 'em.

387
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,070
But I know something the hospital doesn't.

388
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,590
When I was in labor,

389
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:54,139
the other woman's mother
came into my room by mistake,

390
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,210
and we got to talking.

391
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:59,069
She lived in El Paso,
and she was so excited to have

392
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:01,700
her granddaughter baptized
at Santa Maria's church.

393
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,280
That's gonna help.

394
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:07,610
So you think you can find her?

395
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:08,970
We'll do our best.

396
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,980
Carlos is on board with this, right?

397
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,000
Absolutely.

398
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,690
Okay, then give me ten porterhouse.

399
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:27,189
Hey. I just came by to pick up
my envelope for the week.

400
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,020
Okay. Inside.

401
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:30,969
And don't listen to this conversation.

402
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,370
It's about your Christmas gift.

403
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:36,350
I'm buying all my girls steaks.
You got a preference?

404
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:39,470
Whatever meat you put
in my stocking will be fine.

405
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,640
Ooh, that sounds dirty. Use that.

406
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:45,470
I'm back.

407
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,390
What else have you got for me?

408
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:50,240
Rib eye? I like it.

409
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,060
Is that a piece of lint?

410
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,189
That's my bit.

411
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,230
Max... Maxine!

412
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:08,669
What?! I'm on with the meat guy.

413
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:12,180
Yeah, but Stacy Strauss
is stealing my vacuum bit!

414
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,980
Oh, my God. Well, if she's gonna do that,

415
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,090
at least teach her how to use the nozzle.

416
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:41,320
Hey there. I'm ready to party.

417
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,619
Are you? 'Cause you look like

418
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,490
you're ready to tour the Reagan library.

419
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,549
This is a cocktail cardigan.

420
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:49,350
Look closely. The buttons are shiny.

421
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,240
Where's your closet?

422
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:56,150
I have never seen so many sweater sets.

423
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:59,619
Are you sure this is a closet
and not a portal to the 1950s?

424
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,650
There is nothing wrong with my clothing.

425
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,829
Bree, you're going to a hot young club

426
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:07,820
full of hot young people.
You need to dress the part.

427
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,600
Well, I happen to find it distasteful

428
00:22:09,601 --> 00:22:11,240
when mutton is dressed as lamb.

429
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,559
Look, when women go out clubbing,

430
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,770
there's two ways they can pair up...

431
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,620
pretty girl/pretty girl
or pretty girl/grenade.

432
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,840
Which do you wanna be?

433
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,670
Fine.

434
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:27,250
Now we're getting somewhere.

435
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:28,910
Love the plunging neckline.

436
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,330
That's the back.

437
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,940
Ugh. This place is dead.

438
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,620
Really?

439
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:43,540
I forgot we were in the sticks.

440
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,869
Clearly, everyone hooked up early

441
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,830
so they could be home
in time for "nightline."

442
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,509
Actually, tonight's "nightline"
sounds very interesting.

443
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:52,460
- It's about the genocide in r...
- Hold on.

444
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,790
Fresh talent at the end of the bar.

445
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:00,900
Oh, that's my contractor.

446
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:04,090
Well, call me a fixer-upper.

447
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:07,350
Oh, don't... don't bother.
He's, uh, got a girlfriend.

448
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:10,350
If I don't see her, she doesn't exist.

449
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,570
What's so funny?

450
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:23,960
My girlfriend's about to
make a fool of herself.

451
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:26,239
She's hitting on that guy,
and I happen to know

452
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,210
he has a very beautiful,
very young girlfriend.

453
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,700
- You talking about Keith?
- You know him?

454
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,280
Yeah, and Stephanie
dumped him this afternoon,

455
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,960
which is why he's here,
drowning his sorrows.

456
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,950
Bree. Wow.

457
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,010
I didn't recognize you.

458
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:07,150
Keith, what a lovely surprise.
I didn't know you were here.

459
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,240
Yeah.

460
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,759
But I'm bagging.

461
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,820
I gotta work tomorrow.

462
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,270
Boss is pretty strict.

463
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:18,230
Good. I mean, yes, I'm very strict.

464
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,810
See you in the morning.

465
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:28,740
There ya go. That's how you bait the hook.

466
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,450
Oh, I won't need a ride.
I'm going home with Keith.

467
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:33,600
Oh, I don't think so. He just left.

468
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:35,000
Oh, he's pulling the car around.

469
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,400
Now you think I should play

470
00:24:36,401 --> 00:24:39,130
the "I hate going
into a dark house alone" card,

471
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:41,750
or the more blatant
"I'm not wearing underwear"?

472
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,040
'Cause I'm not.

473
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:44,970
Okay, before you do anything hasty,

474
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,100
he just broke up with his girlfriend.
He's very fragile.

475
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,900
Oh. I'll be careful when I unwrap him.

476
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,900
Renee, wait.
Please don't go home with Keith.

477
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,270
Why?

478
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,900
Oh, he's the one you like, isn't he?

479
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,540
I am... I am thinking about you.

480
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,890
You don't want to come off like a slut.

481
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:08,950
Aw, gee, then chip won't ask me
to the prom.

482
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:11,810
Renee, wait! What about me?

483
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,430
Oh, it's getting late.

484
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,770
Stay in the dim light and
don't play hard to get.

485
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,589
Keith, hi. It's Bree.

486
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:41,070
I-I don't know if you're in bed yet,

487
00:25:41,071 --> 00:25:43,400
but I'm having a bit of an emergency.

488
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:47,090
Oh, thank you. That's lovely.

489
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,650
Why would somebody do something like this?

490
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:12,970
Far be it from me to understand
the minds of hooligans.

491
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:17,870
I'm so sorry to call you
over here at this hour.

492
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,240
Oh, it's okay.

493
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,450
I wasn't doing anything special.

494
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,520
Good.

495
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,719
I would love to show my appreciation.

496
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,590
I was wondering if perhaps
one night this week,

497
00:26:29,591 --> 00:26:30,530
I could make you dinner.

498
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,840
Oh. You mean...

499
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,870
like a date?

500
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:38,549
Well, we don't have to put a label on it.

501
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:42,610
Just two adults eating... food together.

502
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,780
Calling it a date is quicker.

503
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,830
Well, I see no reason to argue.

504
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,140
Shall we say...

505
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,930
8:00 P.M. on Thursday?

506
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:35,110
M-Mrs. McCluskey, right?

507
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,130
Yeah.

508
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:40,230
I was hoping I might see you
at the girls' poker game.

509
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:41,970
Not anymore.

510
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:44,740
You get caught with
a couple of aces in your bra,

511
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:47,969
- and you're banned for life.
- I-I couldn't help but notice

512
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:51,130
they don't seem to like
my husband very much.

513
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:53,130
Do you know why that is?

514
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:55,630
Nope. Nobody tells me anything.

515
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,440
Mrs. McCluskey, I really need to know.

516
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:03,540
Okay, fine. They think he's a murderer.

517
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,160
But he was exonerated.

518
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,760
Felicia Tillman framed him.

519
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,210
Yeah, for that crime.

520
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:11,550
What do you mean?

521
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,910
Before Felicia showed up around here,

522
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:17,169
her sister Martha was murdered.
And, all due respect,

523
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:18,980
you're shacking up
with suspect number one.

524
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,530
Does everybody think that?

525
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,699
Felicia may be a few fingers short
of a high five,

526
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,250
but if she's crazy, we all are.

527
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:41,390
Well, that's enough dusting
for today, boys.

528
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:44,470
I guess all that's left
is a little vacuuming.

529
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,680
Ooh! Yay! Get the vacuum.

530
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:52,580
I think I got some schmutz on my apron.

531
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,410
Ooh, get that off.

532
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:04,080
Oh, I love this show. Mm.

533
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:12,580
Hello, boys.

534
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:14,220
For those of you

535
00:29:14,221 --> 00:29:17,230
who might be switching over
from other channels,

536
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:18,710
welcome.

537
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:22,460
I have a very dirty apartment.

538
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,290
Open up!

539
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:29,950
Uh, little busy!

540
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,360
I know you did it.

541
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,929
Did what? I don't know
what you're talking about.

542
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:42,910
Oh, so you're not just a thief.
You're a liar.

543
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,949
Be careful how you talk to me,

544
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:48,689
you gigantic freak.

545
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:52,039
Oh, I am about to slap
that cheap blush right off your face.

546
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,220
Is that supposed to scare me, man hands?

547
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:56,770
I'm gonna show you

548
00:29:56,771 --> 00:29:59,149
a whole new place to stick
that feather duster.

549
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,839
Well, I'm sure wherever it is,

550
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,600
you copied the idea from watching me.

551
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,589
- I need those bonus checks!
- So do I!

552
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:18,550
You don't get it. I am trying
to get out of this business!

553
00:30:18,551 --> 00:30:20,620
Oh, and you think I wanna spend
the rest of my life

554
00:30:20,621 --> 00:30:22,790
- dusting in my underwear?!
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

555
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,430
You're off camera!

556
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,030
Roll left.

557
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:32,170
Oh, Maxine. I'm so glad you're here.

558
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,740
What are you doing?

559
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:36,970
- She attacked me.
- That's because she broke into
my apartment and...

560
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:39,680
Hang on. This isn't a bit?

561
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:42,080
No! I was in the middle of doing my show,

562
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:44,710
and she burst in here
and started hitting me.

563
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,150
Did you do that?

564
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,250
Yeah, but...

565
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,120
You know the rules, Strauss!

566
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:52,560
You never, ever interrupt a show!
Now go to your room.

567
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:55,090
- But I...
- I said go.

568
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,060
You all right, honey?

569
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,600
Yeah.

570
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,570
All right. Good.

571
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,530
I-I gotta call tech support.

572
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:07,370
You girls had so many hits,
it fried my router.

573
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:15,680
So...

574
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:19,680
a roving gang of hooligans
destroyed your sprinklers?

575
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,480
- Shameful, isn't it?
- You know what I think?

576
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:26,890
I think this is the handywork
of a lonely, desperate woman.

577
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,890
You left out "resourceful."

578
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:33,290
Nobody steals a man out of my bed.

579
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:36,260
But you know what?
I've been looking for a new hobby,

580
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:40,100
and taking you down is as good as any.

581
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:43,100
I think you'd be wise
to stick to your original hobby

582
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,310
of forgoing undergarments.

583
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:48,410
Be seeing you, Bree.

584
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,110
Looking forward to it.

585
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,009
Maxine says I can't go back online

586
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:11,600
until I apologize to you,
so... I apologize.

587
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:16,610
Wow. And I thought
your acting was bad on the web site.

588
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,510
Fine. I am sorry, okay?

589
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,680
I shouldn't have stolen your bit.

590
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:23,750
What was going through your mind?

591
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:27,020
I freaked out
when I didn't get that bonus check.

592
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:28,990
See, my family's in Virginia,

593
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,750
and I'm saving up to move back home.

594
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,890
Yeah, well, I know what that's like.

595
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:37,860
And even with that extra money,

596
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:40,300
I always feel like
I'm living week to week.

597
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:43,700
Really? 'Cause when I broke
in your apartment,

598
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:46,100
I noticed that you had
some awfully nice stuff.

599
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:50,310
Flat screen TV,
closet full of new clothes.

600
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:54,140
I know. Probably shouldn't
have bought all that.

601
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,040
But you know how it is.

602
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,010
Every once in a while,
you want a little splurge.

603
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:02,020
Yeah, I get that.

604
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:05,890
But... definitely by the end of the year,

605
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,820
I'm going to be outta here.

606
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,330
Me, too.

607
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,800
How long have you been doing this?

608
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:19,470
Um... gosh. I guess
I'm going on six years.

609
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,670
Hey, um... would you mind
if we just stayed home

610
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:39,170
and ordered Chinese for our anniversary?

611
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,100
Wait. No suit?

612
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,130
No tie?

613
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,600
No pretentious euro waiter
listing specials

614
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:48,100
that I can't understand?

615
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:50,000
Dang it, Susan! Why?

616
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,560
Seriously, why'd you change your mind?

617
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,500
I thought you wanted a little treat.

618
00:33:56,530 --> 00:34:00,770
Oh. I think we should save that money

619
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,540
and stay focused on
what we're trying to do.

620
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:06,539
And we can have a fancy
dinner and celebrate

621
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:09,080
when we move back home.

622
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,400
I had a lovely time
at the poker game the other day.

623
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:27,440
Really? What's the neighborhood
saying about me?

624
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:30,140
Well...

625
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:31,540
For starters,

626
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,970
a lot of people seem
to think you killed...

627
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:37,810
What's her name? Martha something.

628
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:39,880
Huber.

629
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,750
I guess Felicia Tillman spread
her poison pretty wide.

630
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,690
I guess she did.

631
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,420
I'm not a murderer, you know.

632
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,890
I know.

633
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,990
But I fell in love 
with you before I knew that,

634
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:56,960
so even if you were...

635
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,040
I'm always gonna be on your side.

636
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,530
Remember that.

637
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:18,100
Everything okay? You...
You look a little...

638
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:20,130
It's been an intense couple weeks.

639
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:21,930
I'm sorry, buddy.

640
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:28,440
What if I told you

641
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,880
I could ease some of that stress?

642
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,860
You're not gonna offer me
a back rub, are you?

643
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,770
Nope.

644
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,110
A mind rub.

645
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:48,210
So you got this from a doctor?

646
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,910
Really cool doctor.

647
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:55,320
Now I gotta warn you,
this stuff is chronic.

648
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:57,890
I got totally baked off
of it this morning.

649
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,490
I did not have you pegged as a stoner.

650
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,990
Dude...

651
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:04,630
There's a lot
that you don't know about me.

652
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,190
Tom?

653
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,970
I hate to break this to you, but...

654
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,430
this isn't pot.

655
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:15,689
Tell me that in five minutes

656
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:18,079
when we are soaring past
the rings of Saturn.

657
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,590
Trust me, cheech. This is oregano.

658
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:24,560
No way. I bo... I bo...
I bought it at a legit dispensary.

659
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:26,410
Then somebody must have 
switched it on you,

660
00:36:26,411 --> 00:36:28,840
'cause the only thing getting baked
with that herb is lasagna.

661
00:36:28,841 --> 00:36:31,100
Who would do that?

662
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:37,070
- You!
- Oh, jeez. You scared me.

663
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,200
I know what you did.

664
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:42,270
Whatever do you mean?

665
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:47,080
Oh, yeah. That was me.

666
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,379
Th-this isn't funny, Lynette!

667
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,720
Tom, you thought you were getting stoned

668
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:55,190
on a pizza topping. It's a little funny.

669
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:58,090
My sense of betrayal
is huge at this moment.

670
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,860
Well, why don't you snort
some baking powder?

671
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:03,290
- You'll feel better.
- I'm glad you're enjoying this.

672
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:05,800
Glad you enjoy making a fool of me.

673
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:09,500
That was not my intention.

674
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:14,540
I only threw out the pot because
I didn't think you needed it,

675
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:17,880
and you know, I was right.
You got happy all on your own.

676
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:19,880
Don't try to justify what you did

677
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:23,210
by making it seem like
some sort of "master plan."

678
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,849
It wasn't a master plan.

679
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:26,670
I lucked out because for some reason,

680
00:37:26,671 --> 00:37:29,659
while you were... high on oregano,

681
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:32,620
you made a decision to live in the moment.

682
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,660
You stood over our daughter's crib

683
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:37,630
and you let go of the stress and the fear,

684
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:41,180
and you focused on the good in your life.

685
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:49,010
But I am sorry I tricked you.

686
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,150
You're evil. I should have expected it.

687
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:59,020
Where are you going?

688
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:01,450
To look at our beautiful daughter.

689
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:07,030
Then I gotta turn that bong
I made back into a lamp.

690
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,300
Anything?

691
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,000
We found them.

692
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,770
Oh, my God. What'd they say?

693
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,669
I haven't called them yet.
Are you sure you still wanna do this?

694
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,990
What? Yes, of course.

695
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,360
Gaby, you need to realize,
once we call these people,

696
00:38:30,361 --> 00:38:31,670
and they know what's happened,

697
00:38:31,671 --> 00:38:35,030
it'll change your family forever.

698
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:40,070
Call them.

699
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,820
Juanita, come in here.

700
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:54,320
I didn't do it.

701
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:55,850
I know.

702
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:59,790
I was putting on some makeup.
I thought you might like some.

703
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:02,760
Can you put the big fake eyelashes on me?

704
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,070
Of course, and... big rosy cheeks.

705
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:12,640
Look how grown-up you are.

706
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,510
Before you know it,
you're gonna be going to college,

707
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:20,150
have boyfriends, get married.

708
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:22,580
I'm not getting married.

709
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,900
I don't wanna leave you and daddy... ever.

710
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:30,170
Juanita...

711
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,100
Do you know how much I love you?

712
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,670
To the moon and back.

713
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:38,010
That's right.

714
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:44,430
No matter what happens,

715
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:47,360
I will always love you
to the moon and back.

716
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,200
Hey, Carlos, I need to sit down
with you and Gaby.

717
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:58,030
Why?

718
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:01,600
I just called the family.
It got pretty intense.

719
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,170
What are you talking about?

720
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:10,240
And now in a selection
from Dior's fall line,

721
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:14,210
the world's newest supermodel... Juanita!

722
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,920
Hold the world in contempt.

723
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,190
That's it.

724
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,060
Now you look like a model.

725
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:23,560
Oh, hi, daddy.

726
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:28,330
Hey, Carlos. What's wrong?

727
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,830
I just spoke to Bob.

728
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,170
Sweetie, why don't you go to your room?

729
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,200
And I'll be there in a sec.

730
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,809
- How could you have done this?
- Carlos...

731
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:44,470
We talked about this! We agreed.

732
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:47,380
No, you agreed. You rushed me
into signing that piece of paper

733
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:49,999
without giving me a chance
to think about what I was doing.

734
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,960
Don't you understand what could happen?

735
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,369
She is our flesh and blood,
and she's out there!

736
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:56,790
I need to know how she's doing.
I need to know she's okay!

737
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,650
And what if they want Juanita back?!

738
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:02,550
They can take her from us.
They can do that now!

739
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:07,520
They're not gonna wanna give up
their own daughter.

740
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:09,120
We don't know that!

741
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,020
We don't know anything about them!

742
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:14,060
And you have no idea
what you've started here!

743
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,930
Mommy!

744
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,600
Coming, sweetie!

745
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:19,030
If this ends badly,

746
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:20,970
I will never forgive you.

747
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,240
I mean it, Gabrielle.

748
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:24,770
We're done.

749
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,160
Happiness...

750
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,800
it's something everyone searches for.

751
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:48,410
Some are sure they'll find it
once they've moved back home.

752
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:54,680
Some think they'll find it
by making a new friend.

753
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:57,750
Some hope to find it

754
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:01,290
once they've defeated the competition.

755
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:06,590
Then there are those
who stop searching for happiness

756
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:10,230
because they look up
one day to discover...

757
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:13,400
It was right there in front of them

758
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:15,500
all the time.

759
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:19,900
