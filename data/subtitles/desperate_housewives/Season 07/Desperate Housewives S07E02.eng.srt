Previously on...

2
00:00:02,752 --> 00:00:04,920
That maniac was serving a life sentence.

3
00:00:04,954 --> 00:00:06,091
Hello, ladies.

4
00:00:06,204 --> 00:00:08,344
Paul Young came back.

5
00:00:08,502 --> 00:00:11,671
- Doug is leaving me.
Lynette's friend had nowhere to go.

6
00:00:11,738 --> 00:00:14,507
I've spent eight years loving
someone else's daughter.

7
00:00:15,074 --> 00:00:19,045
A baby was switched long ago,
and Carlos made a decision.

8
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:22,294
- We're not telling Gaby.
Susan got a job offer.

9
00:00:22,295 --> 00:00:24,050
Women doing housework in lingerie.

10
00:00:24,084 --> 00:00:26,100
While Bree's contractor...

11
00:00:26,101 --> 00:00:28,982
With your red hair,
you will look so hot in this room.

12
00:00:28,983 --> 00:00:31,565
Brought possibilities to light.

13
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,127
All set.

14
00:00:38,853 --> 00:00:39,683
Now that you're a biker chick,

15
00:00:39,684 --> 00:00:42,322
there's one other thing
you gotta know how to do.

16
00:00:45,903 --> 00:00:46,898
Thanks, mister.

17
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:54,016
It had been a long time

18
00:00:54,017 --> 00:00:57,206
since Bree Van De Kamp was a little girl,

19
00:00:59,174 --> 00:01:01,054
but she could still remember

20
00:01:01,055 --> 00:01:04,881
everything she'd ever been told about sex.

21
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,657
Her grandmother informed her
it was a woman's burden.

22
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,816
Her minister warned her it was a sin.

23
00:01:16,585 --> 00:01:19,450
Her teacher taught her it was unhealthy.

24
00:01:20,485 --> 00:01:22,912
Yes, everyone had told Bree

25
00:01:22,913 --> 00:01:26,142
her sexual urges were dangerous.

26
00:01:27,539 --> 00:01:29,540
But no one had ever told her...

27
00:01:30,855 --> 00:01:32,398
how to get rid of them.

28
00:01:33,571 --> 00:01:34,696
Hey. There you are.

29
00:01:36,074 --> 00:01:37,605
I'm off to the bank.

30
00:01:37,813 --> 00:01:39,225
Before you go, I wanna show you something.

31
00:01:39,226 --> 00:01:42,210
Come here. Whole new idea.

32
00:01:42,414 --> 00:01:45,145
I wanna panel the study in this.

33
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:47,904
Oh. Well, that's, uh, unusual.

34
00:01:47,905 --> 00:01:49,812
Historical birch from
a Wyoming snow fence.

35
00:01:49,813 --> 00:01:51,712
Over 200 years old. Feel it.

36
00:01:53,232 --> 00:01:54,091
No. Really.

37
00:01:54,278 --> 00:01:55,163
Feel it.

38
00:01:57,113 --> 00:01:58,411
You know what they call this?

39
00:01:59,642 --> 00:02:02,631
Witness wood,
'cause it's seen so much history,

40
00:02:03,339 --> 00:02:03,934
unlike me, who slept through history

41
00:02:03,968 --> 00:02:05,620
and had to go to summer school.

42
00:02:07,572 --> 00:02:09,057
I have to go. It's late.

43
00:02:18,311 --> 00:02:21,020
Yes, when Bree was a little girl,

44
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:22,929
she'd been taught

45
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:26,160
her sexual urges were dangerous.

46
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:30,284
Unfortunately, she was about to learn...

47
00:02:33,065 --> 00:02:35,069
those urges were dangerous...

48
00:02:35,525 --> 00:02:36,283
for everyone.

49
00:02:36,284 --> 00:02:39,562
Juanita. Oh, hey. Oh.

00:02:53,667 --> 00:02:56,433
The doctors and nurses
at Fairview Hospital

52
00:02:56,434 --> 00:02:58,535
are experts at healing.

53
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,601
They can set bones...

54
00:03:02,374 --> 00:03:03,635
bandage wounds...

55
00:03:04,678 --> 00:03:06,909
and treat diseases.

56
00:03:08,415 --> 00:03:12,183
Sadly, one thing
they don't know how to heal

57
00:03:12,934 --> 00:03:14,742
is a guilty conscience.

58
00:03:14,743 --> 00:03:17,790
I don't know what happened.
She just came out of nowhere.

59
00:03:17,825 --> 00:03:19,926
Oh, honey, this could've been any of us.

60
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,351
Kids on that street are always playing
where they shouldn't be.

61
00:03:22,352 --> 00:03:23,986
Still, I would just feel better
if they would come out

62
00:03:23,987 --> 00:03:25,270
and tell us something.

63
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:27,667
Juanita was talking
when they put her in the ambulance,

64
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:29,669
so I'm sure everything's gonna be fine.

65
00:03:29,703 --> 00:03:31,072
And I just spoke to one of the nurses.

66
00:03:31,073 --> 00:03:34,077
- She seemed pretty positive.
- Well, that's a relief.

67
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:36,822
Paul?

68
00:03:37,177 --> 00:03:38,471
W-what are you doing here?

69
00:03:38,472 --> 00:03:41,027
I heard about the accident,
so I-I rushed right over.

70
00:03:41,913 --> 00:03:43,531
That's what neighbors do, right?

71
00:03:44,251 --> 00:03:46,461
Well, that's very thoughtful.

72
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:49,219
We'll tell Gaby you stopped by.

73
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,254
Yeah, don't feel like
you have to hang around.

74
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:53,079
There's nothing we can do.

75
00:03:54,176 --> 00:03:55,355
We can pray.

76
00:04:08,825 --> 00:04:11,010
Dear lord, we ask
that you be with this young child

77
00:04:11,045 --> 00:04:13,228
and with the doctors caring for her...

78
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:14,986
and that she may be
returned in full health

79
00:04:14,987 --> 00:04:17,843
to her loving family. Amen.

80
00:04:19,273 --> 00:04:20,194
Amen.

81
00:04:21,247 --> 00:04:23,727
Well, I have to get home.
I'm expecting someone.

82
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,767
Please extend my good wishes to Gaby.

83
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:33,800
Dear lord, please don't let
that creep ever touch me again.

84
00:04:33,801 --> 00:04:34,803
Amen.

85
00:04:37,071 --> 00:04:38,593
Oh, Gaby, thank God.

86
00:04:38,594 --> 00:04:39,711
How is Juanita?

87
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,625
She's gonna be fine.

88
00:04:41,685 --> 00:04:44,278
- They're keeping her a couple days
for observation.
- Oh.

89
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:46,535
So I told Carlos
he doesn't even have to fly back

90
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:49,432
- from his business trip.
- That's great news.

91
00:04:49,433 --> 00:04:50,624
Yeah, it is.

92
00:04:51,567 --> 00:04:54,178
Uh, Bree, Andrew,
can I talk to you for a second?

93
00:04:58,187 --> 00:04:59,223
Thanks for coming.

94
00:04:59,224 --> 00:05:02,225
I feel so blessed to have such wonderful...

95
00:05:02,226 --> 00:05:04,039
What the hell is wrong with you people?!

96
00:05:04,074 --> 00:05:05,779
First you take out my mother-in-law,

97
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,917
then you go after my daughter.

98
00:05:06,918 --> 00:05:09,556
Are you trying to kill off
every Juanita Solis on the planet?!

99
00:05:09,557 --> 00:05:11,760
I admit it was a terrible coincidence.

100
00:05:11,761 --> 00:05:12,583
You're gettin' sloppy, you know.

101
00:05:12,584 --> 00:05:14,500
- This one was in broad daylight.
- I'm sorry.

102
00:05:14,501 --> 00:05:16,088
She just came out of nowhere.

103
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:19,477
Have you seen my daughter?
She never comes out of nowhere.

104
00:05:20,052 --> 00:05:22,868
Uh, on a related note,
I just wanna say how much I appreciate

105
00:05:22,869 --> 00:05:25,784
you not telling Carlos
about me running over his mom.

106
00:05:25,785 --> 00:05:27,647
I'm gonna give you that one
'cause I wasn't fond of her.

107
00:05:27,648 --> 00:05:30,829
But as for the rest of my family,
learn to swerve!

108
00:05:33,619 --> 00:05:35,382
Why does this keep happening?

109
00:05:35,383 --> 00:05:38,818
I don't know. I mean,
maybe God's punishing us.

110
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,811
Or God is punishing the Solises,

111
00:05:41,845 --> 00:05:43,903
and we're just doing God's work.

112
00:05:45,076 --> 00:05:46,517
I feel awful.

113
00:05:46,656 --> 00:05:48,902
I should never have been fiddling
with that radio.

114
00:05:48,903 --> 00:05:51,790
Radio? Mom, I saw you
from across the street.

115
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,590
You were checking out Keith's ass.

116
00:05:53,591 --> 00:05:54,905
That's preposterous.

117
00:05:54,906 --> 00:05:56,419
You were looking at that contractor's butt

118
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,480
like you were waiting
for a side of steak sauce.

119
00:05:58,481 --> 00:06:01,265
Watch your mouth. This isn't
one of your homosexual dance clubs.

120
00:06:01,266 --> 00:06:03,734
I'm telling you, it was the radio.

121
00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:07,299
Okay. Fine.
But while we're talking about the radio,

122
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,620
uh, you do know that
that particular model is, like,

123
00:06:10,097 --> 00:06:11,560
15 years too young for you, right?

124
00:06:32,157 --> 00:06:33,045
Who is it?

125
00:06:33,582 --> 00:06:34,528
Maxine.

126
00:06:34,887 --> 00:06:35,638
Oh!

127
00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:38,686
Oh, uh, hang on a second.

128
00:06:40,278 --> 00:06:42,472
Ah, I was just wrapping up
my first session.

129
00:06:42,473 --> 00:06:46,028
I know. I was watching.

130
00:06:46,284 --> 00:06:47,454
And?

131
00:06:48,758 --> 00:06:49,713
What'd you think?

132
00:06:49,714 --> 00:06:51,801
It was like watching a dream.

133
00:06:51,802 --> 00:06:54,530
And you know why? 'Cause I was asleep.

134
00:06:55,271 --> 00:06:56,316
Sit down, honey.

135
00:06:56,868 --> 00:06:59,105
It's time I gave you a few pointers.

136
00:07:03,863 --> 00:07:06,673
Now... you see what I'm doing here?

137
00:07:09,087 --> 00:07:10,164
Ohh.

138
00:07:11,704 --> 00:07:15,146
And let's not forget the duster.

139
00:07:20,455 --> 00:07:22,582
Okay. Okay, I-I get it.

140
00:07:23,797 --> 00:07:27,652
And what have we here? Smudges.

141
00:07:30,832 --> 00:07:32,836
Uh, we eat off that table.

142
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,775
Am I making my point?

143
00:07:34,776 --> 00:07:37,593
We are selling a fantasy here.

144
00:07:37,594 --> 00:07:40,448
You gotta, you know, loosen up.

145
00:07:40,717 --> 00:07:42,408
I want to. I just...

146
00:07:43,809 --> 00:07:48,697
I can't stop thinking about
all those men out there watching me.

147
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:50,537
Yes, they're watching you.

148
00:07:50,739 --> 00:07:52,853
They are spending
their hard-earned dollars

149
00:07:52,854 --> 00:07:54,827
to see the perfect woman.

150
00:07:56,303 --> 00:07:58,543
You, my darling,

151
00:07:58,963 --> 00:08:01,367
have all the power here.

152
00:08:04,146 --> 00:08:04,764
Now...

153
00:08:05,548 --> 00:08:08,865
Is that a crumb I see on that rug?

154
00:08:19,914 --> 00:08:21,481
- Mm.
- Oh.

155
00:08:21,516 --> 00:08:23,550
Oh.

156
00:08:23,585 --> 00:08:25,152
That's it.

157
00:08:25,186 --> 00:08:25,971
Ah!

158
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:28,134
- That's my girl.
- Ooh!

159
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:31,425
Doug, if your lawyers don't sweeten
the settlement offer,

160
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:33,932
I will sue you for half of everything,

161
00:08:34,145 --> 00:08:36,823
and that includes your
girlfriend's new implants.

162
00:08:36,824 --> 00:08:38,169
You paid for 'em out of our joint account,

163
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:40,347
so technically,
one of those puppies is mine.

164
00:08:41,061 --> 00:08:42,481
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe throw it in the pool

165
00:08:42,482 --> 00:08:44,055
and use it as a floatie.

166
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,022
Uh, Renee.

167
00:08:46,876 --> 00:08:49,025
Oh, she's gonna be dating soon enough.

168
00:08:49,026 --> 00:08:51,496
It's time she learned
what men are all about.

169
00:08:51,836 --> 00:08:52,312
Now, sweetie,

170
00:08:52,347 --> 00:08:55,320
what did auntie Renee
teach you about marriage?

171
00:08:55,995 --> 00:08:57,308
Never sign a prenup.

172
00:08:57,309 --> 00:08:58,977
Oh! Jeez!

173
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:01,744
Hey!

174
00:09:02,418 --> 00:09:05,687
- What are you doing home from work?
- I'm not feeling well.

175
00:09:05,721 --> 00:09:07,289
- Again?
- Yeah.

176
00:09:07,323 --> 00:09:10,892
That's the third time this week.
You need to go to the doctor.

177
00:09:10,927 --> 00:09:12,327
No, I'm fine.

178
00:09:12,361 --> 00:09:14,556
I'm just gonna lie on
the couch and watch some TV.

179
00:09:14,825 --> 00:09:15,877
Okay.

180
00:09:17,211 --> 00:09:18,050
Oh!

181
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:19,848
Before you fire up the golf channel,

182
00:09:19,849 --> 00:09:21,418
you think maybe you could make a quick run

183
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:24,404
- to the grocery store?
- I'm tired. Can't you do it?

184
00:09:25,173 --> 00:09:26,233
I'm a little busy right now.

185
00:09:26,234 --> 00:09:28,943
I've got five kids
and a useless houseguest.

186
00:09:29,341 --> 00:09:29,923
Hi there.

187
00:09:31,392 --> 00:09:33,293
I need you functional.

188
00:09:33,327 --> 00:09:35,997
Either go to the doctor and get some help

189
00:09:35,998 --> 00:09:38,031
or quit complaining and give me some help.

190
00:09:38,032 --> 00:09:39,760
Fine. I'll go tomorrow.

191
00:09:39,761 --> 00:09:42,721
Man, the sympathy in here
is just overwhelming.

192
00:09:46,476 --> 00:09:47,300
What?

193
00:09:48,011 --> 00:09:49,853
Nothing. It's none of my business.

194
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,585
But...

195
00:09:52,816 --> 00:09:54,503
You may wanna be careful.

196
00:09:54,504 --> 00:09:56,838
You two are starting to sound
a lot like me and Doug.

197
00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:00,229
I appreciate the concern,
but Tom and I always do that.

198
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,473
Doug and I always did that, too.

199
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,050
Look at us now.

200
00:10:04,266 --> 00:10:05,897
I'm telling you, we're fine.

201
00:10:08,765 --> 00:10:10,149
If you say so.

202
00:10:11,101 --> 00:10:12,301
Good.

203
00:10:14,428 --> 00:10:15,805
The doctors say she's gonna be fine.

204
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,874
They're only keeping her
in the hospital as a precaution.

205
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:20,531
- She'll be home in a few days.
- Oh, thank God.

206
00:10:22,245 --> 00:10:25,472
Can we please not have another ugly scene?

207
00:10:25,473 --> 00:10:28,194
- I only came to check on Juanita.
- She's fine.

208
00:10:28,195 --> 00:10:29,294
Fantastic.

209
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,357
So I see you let
our tomato plants whither...

210
00:10:31,869 --> 00:10:33,553
Just like you did our relationship.

211
00:10:33,554 --> 00:10:36,612
Well, that's what happens
when you grow needy, whiny tomatoes.

212
00:10:36,613 --> 00:10:38,419
Boys, boys, it's been a month.

213
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:42,033
Can't you just kiss
each other's bottoms and make up?

214
00:10:43,212 --> 00:10:44,382
Isn't that what they do?

215
00:10:47,353 --> 00:10:49,087
Who is that?

216
00:10:51,224 --> 00:10:52,492
She looks lost.

217
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:56,082
Should we help her?

218
00:10:56,413 --> 00:10:58,924
Aah! Son of a bitch!

219
00:10:59,155 --> 00:11:01,244
- We should help her.
- Son of a...

220
00:11:01,524 --> 00:11:02,945
Oh! Oh!

221
00:11:06,086 --> 00:11:07,928
Miss, is everything okay?

222
00:11:07,929 --> 00:11:09,155
No.

223
00:11:09,773 --> 00:11:13,065
I am so lost.

224
00:11:13,462 --> 00:11:16,078
I gave the cab driver the address,

225
00:11:16,373 --> 00:11:18,341
but I only had a $20, and it turns out

226
00:11:18,342 --> 00:11:20,057
that only gets you
as far as hibiscus circle,

227
00:11:20,058 --> 00:11:20,736
so he dumped me,

228
00:11:20,737 --> 00:11:22,781
and I had to walk in these shoes,
which broke,

229
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:24,598
and that is the last time
I am buying footwear

230
00:11:24,599 --> 00:11:28,177
- over the Internet.
- Uh, were you looking for Wisteria Lane?

231
00:11:28,178 --> 00:11:30,007
Yeah, that sounds right.

232
00:11:30,008 --> 00:11:32,004
Is my fish moving?

233
00:11:32,005 --> 00:11:34,562
If he goes belly-up,
this is going to be the worst day ever.

234
00:11:35,042 --> 00:11:36,381
Who is it you're here to see?

235
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,545
Uh, Paul Young.

236
00:11:39,472 --> 00:11:41,739
Really? A-are you a friend of his?

237
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:43,595
W-well...

238
00:11:43,596 --> 00:11:44,302
Beth!

239
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:48,710
Oh! I thought you were gonna
be here hours ago.

240
00:11:50,075 --> 00:11:52,894
Well... I see you've all met my wife.

241
00:12:07,544 --> 00:12:09,979
Sorry, it got... really hot in here,

242
00:12:10,014 --> 00:12:11,784
and I thought you'd be gone for a while.

243
00:12:12,156 --> 00:12:15,019
So how is Juanita? Is she okay?

244
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:17,902
Um, she's doing much better.

245
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:19,076
Thank you for asking.

246
00:12:19,462 --> 00:12:21,925
Thank God. How are you doing?

247
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:24,877
Um, me? I'm okay.

248
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:26,814
How's the work coming?

249
00:12:27,182 --> 00:12:28,081
Pretty good.

250
00:12:28,082 --> 00:12:30,767
Just getting ready to put, uh...

251
00:12:30,801 --> 00:12:32,802
Shoot. It's on backwards.

252
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:37,780
Bree?

253
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:41,990
You sure you're okay?

254
00:12:41,991 --> 00:12:43,063
I'm fine. Fine.

255
00:12:43,064 --> 00:12:45,789
It's just been a very... stressful day.

256
00:12:48,688 --> 00:12:50,621
I think I know what you need.

257
00:12:55,265 --> 00:12:56,132
It's okay.

258
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,327
Hitting that little girl was an accident.

259
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,857
It could've happened to anyone.

260
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,150
I have to let you go!

261
00:13:04,323 --> 00:13:05,052
Huh?

262
00:13:05,053 --> 00:13:08,011
After you let me go.
Everyone should just let go!

263
00:13:12,248 --> 00:13:13,431
Are you firing me?

264
00:13:13,781 --> 00:13:14,421
Why?

265
00:13:14,908 --> 00:13:16,423
You're too messy.

266
00:13:16,424 --> 00:13:18,489
Your tools...
they're scattered everywhere.

267
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,496
Well, this is a construction site.

268
00:13:20,497 --> 00:13:22,799
And you're getting paint
all over the place.

269
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,188
And that cologne of yours...
it's overpowering.

270
00:13:25,189 --> 00:13:26,302
I don't wear cologne.

271
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,006
That's just you?

272
00:13:28,698 --> 00:13:29,864
Oh, dear.

273
00:13:30,982 --> 00:13:32,375
Anyway, obviously...

274
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,209
I will pay you for the time you've put in,

275
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:38,813
- but I think you should go.
- You can... send me a check.

276
00:13:46,501 --> 00:13:47,814
Bye, guys.

277
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:49,751
Have a great day.

278
00:13:51,536 --> 00:13:53,471
Hey, aren't you going to work?

279
00:13:53,505 --> 00:13:54,806
Oh, my first class isn't till 11:00.

280
00:13:54,807 --> 00:13:57,366
I thought I'd spend
the morning making more jewelry.

281
00:13:57,367 --> 00:13:59,592
Wow, you really are determined
to bring in some extra money.

282
00:14:01,027 --> 00:14:02,086
You have no idea.

283
00:14:25,822 --> 00:14:27,741
And you don't let me put
my feet on that table.

284
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:31,048
Mike! Uh, what are you...
What are you doing home so quick?

285
00:14:31,049 --> 00:14:33,119
I forgot my thermos. What are you wearing?

286
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,821
Uh...

287
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:37,475
Uh, I was, uh, just...
just doing housework...

288
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,005
O-obviously,

289
00:14:39,006 --> 00:14:41,619
and, uh, the air conditioning
isn't working,

290
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:44,003
so it got really hot in here.

291
00:14:46,091 --> 00:14:47,097
I'll say.

292
00:14:47,463 --> 00:14:48,738
Mind if I join you?

293
00:14:49,018 --> 00:14:50,216
No! No! Uh...

294
00:14:50,217 --> 00:14:51,344
Oh!

295
00:14:51,753 --> 00:14:53,582
Uh... you know what?

296
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:55,396
Why don't we take this in the bedroom?

297
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:56,582
What's wrong with right here?

298
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,540
I am one lucky guy...

299
00:15:00,212 --> 00:15:03,925
to come home to a hot fantasy like this.

300
00:15:03,926 --> 00:15:08,020
Yep. And I am one lucky girl

301
00:15:08,713 --> 00:15:11,895
to have a... have a husband like...

302
00:15:14,307 --> 00:15:16,368
you. Ohh.

303
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,696
Any luck finding an apartment?

304
00:15:23,742 --> 00:15:26,416
Not with my settlement.
With New York prices,

305
00:15:26,417 --> 00:15:29,086
I'll be forced to live
in a place smaller than this.

306
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:32,205
Oh, my God. How will you keep
from bumping into yourself?

307
00:15:33,661 --> 00:15:34,936
You know what I was thinking?

308
00:15:34,937 --> 00:15:37,830
Why don't I just find
a place here in Fairview?

309
00:15:40,358 --> 00:15:41,300
Fairview?

310
00:15:41,617 --> 00:15:43,484
Uh... no.

311
00:15:43,671 --> 00:15:44,786
No, no!

312
00:15:44,787 --> 00:15:48,888
You're a new yorker.
You love the theater, museums.

313
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:49,437
You said yourself,

314
00:15:49,438 --> 00:15:51,820
you can't even get a decent
cup of coffee around here.

315
00:15:51,953 --> 00:15:53,854
Uh, no, I meant here, Lynette.

316
00:15:53,889 --> 00:15:56,090
Really, how hard is it to clean the pot?

317
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,535
Hey! How'd it go with the doctor?

318
00:16:03,682 --> 00:16:06,113
Yeah, can, uh, we, um...

319
00:16:06,495 --> 00:16:07,674
talk about that?

320
00:16:09,413 --> 00:16:11,210
So what did the doctor say?

321
00:16:11,947 --> 00:16:13,447
You're gonna wanna sit down.

322
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,845
Tom, you are scaring me. What is it?

323
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:23,248
I have postpartum depression.

324
00:16:25,065 --> 00:16:26,114
Come again?

325
00:16:26,115 --> 00:16:28,917
I know it sounds weird,
b-but it's... it's...

326
00:16:28,951 --> 00:16:31,819
it's a recognized problem
for fathers my age.

327
00:16:31,854 --> 00:16:34,145
I've got all the classic symptoms...

328
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:36,324
headaches, mood swings,

329
00:16:36,358 --> 00:16:37,400
fatigue.

330
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:39,252
Wow.

331
00:16:39,495 --> 00:16:42,397
Tell me, did he check you
for a yeast infection

332
00:16:42,431 --> 00:16:44,689
while he was down there, too?

333
00:16:46,187 --> 00:16:49,735
Why don't you learn the facts
before you make fun of it?

334
00:16:50,025 --> 00:16:52,229
"Men and postpartum:"

335
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,085
"The bitter seed."

336
00:16:54,086 --> 00:16:57,352
Yeah, I'm... not buying it.

337
00:16:57,353 --> 00:17:00,400
Show me one stretch mark,
one chapped nipple,

338
00:17:00,435 --> 00:17:01,312
and we'll talk about your postpartum.

339
00:17:01,313 --> 00:17:03,611
It's a legitimate medical condition.

340
00:17:03,612 --> 00:17:05,916
And you're the one
who told me to go to the doctor.

341
00:17:05,917 --> 00:17:08,373
So you could be of some use around here,

342
00:17:08,374 --> 00:17:09,921
not so you could, uh...

343
00:17:09,922 --> 00:17:13,008
oh, "take long baths or
get in some extra naps"?

344
00:17:13,009 --> 00:17:15,666
Do me a favor. Read the whole pamphlet.

345
00:17:16,851 --> 00:17:18,522
Gosh, I wish I could, Tom.

346
00:17:18,523 --> 00:17:21,185
Unfortunately, I have to go take care
of my other baby.

347
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:51,621
I love the house.

348
00:17:52,368 --> 00:17:55,089
Oh. Well, I did the best I could.

349
00:17:55,662 --> 00:17:57,221
I think it needs a woman's touch.

350
00:17:57,486 --> 00:17:58,283
Oh.

351
00:17:58,758 --> 00:18:01,563
I-I don't have
much experience with decorating.

352
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,044
If I so much as moved a chair,
mama would throw a fit.

353
00:18:05,955 --> 00:18:08,358
Mm, then you must be happy
to finally have your own home.

354
00:18:09,773 --> 00:18:10,683
I guess.

355
00:18:15,185 --> 00:18:16,248
Look at this...

356
00:18:16,832 --> 00:18:18,054
No plexiglas.

357
00:18:18,367 --> 00:18:19,467
I never dreamed the day would come

358
00:18:19,468 --> 00:18:21,548
when I could reach out and touch you.

359
00:18:25,181 --> 00:18:26,451
I didn't either.

360
00:18:31,048 --> 00:18:33,293
There is one thing
I'll miss about prison...

361
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,835
your letters.

362
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,886
Some days, they were
the only things keeping me going.

363
00:18:38,664 --> 00:18:40,478
I'm glad you liked them.

364
00:18:41,192 --> 00:18:44,333
Uh, thank you again
for going to so much trouble.

365
00:18:44,367 --> 00:18:46,043
Dinner is wonderful.

366
00:18:46,044 --> 00:18:47,703
I wanted tonight to be special.

367
00:18:48,271 --> 00:18:50,139
Since the prison
didn't allow conjugal visits,

368
00:18:50,173 --> 00:18:52,174
this is... kind of our wedding night.

369
00:18:54,889 --> 00:18:56,244
About that...

370
00:18:56,279 --> 00:19:00,058
I can't wait to start cooking for you

371
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:02,100
and making things nice around here,

372
00:19:02,101 --> 00:19:03,632
but there are certain other...

373
00:19:05,537 --> 00:19:09,105
wifely duties that
I don't want to rush into.

374
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:11,655
Oh?

375
00:19:13,184 --> 00:19:14,876
We're still getting to know each other.

376
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,700
Mama said you'd understand.

377
00:19:19,313 --> 00:19:21,073
Oh, I suppose I do.

378
00:19:21,605 --> 00:19:23,007
You're not upset?

379
00:19:23,133 --> 00:19:24,216
Of course not.

380
00:19:25,902 --> 00:19:27,862
There's more to marriage than sex.

381
00:19:34,164 --> 00:19:36,058
Oh, Mrs. Solis, can I talk to you?

382
00:19:37,903 --> 00:19:40,380
If this is about Juanita
and the dessert cart,

383
00:19:40,783 --> 00:19:42,404
I told you not to leave it unattended.

384
00:19:42,405 --> 00:19:44,287
No, I was reviewing her chart,

385
00:19:44,321 --> 00:19:46,750
and I realized we still had
a couple of questions.

386
00:19:46,751 --> 00:19:49,774
- Is she allergic to any medications?
- Uh, not that I'm aware of.

387
00:19:49,775 --> 00:19:52,667
- Okay. All her vaccinations up-to-date?
- Yes.

388
00:19:52,668 --> 00:19:55,442
And how old was she when you adopted her?

389
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,024
I know it's hard to believe

390
00:20:00,025 --> 00:20:03,329
that the little acorn
gave birth to the mighty oak,

391
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:04,704
but believe me, I did.

392
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:06,528
Okay.

393
00:20:06,945 --> 00:20:09,375
Maybe I'm confused, but the other day

394
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:11,427
when we talked about
possible blood transfusions,

395
00:20:11,428 --> 00:20:14,107
you told me you
and your husband were type-O.

396
00:20:14,816 --> 00:20:15,958
Yeah, we are.

397
00:20:16,183 --> 00:20:16,824
So?

398
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:21,669
W-well, your daughter is type-A.
Two 0's can't have an "A."

399
00:20:24,302 --> 00:20:25,077
Oh.

400
00:20:26,843 --> 00:20:28,021
Never mind.

401
00:20:30,337 --> 00:20:32,371
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What... what was that?

402
00:20:32,372 --> 00:20:34,565
What was that "oh. Never mind"?

403
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,466
It's none of my business.

404
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:39,572
No, no, tell me. What are you implying?

405
00:20:39,826 --> 00:20:40,734
Nothing.

406
00:20:41,063 --> 00:20:43,942
I'm simply stating that
the odds of Mr. Solis being

407
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:45,858
the biological father of a type-A baby

408
00:20:45,859 --> 00:20:48,291
are roughly... nil.

409
00:20:49,015 --> 00:20:51,252
Are you suggesting I cheated on him?

410
00:20:51,253 --> 00:20:53,288
I'm simply stating that the
odds of Mr. Solis being

411
00:20:53,289 --> 00:20:55,492
- the biological father are...
- Listen, nursie.

412
00:20:55,493 --> 00:20:57,674
I know you spend
your days emptying bedpans

413
00:20:57,675 --> 00:20:59,739
and shaving the groins of senior citizens,

414
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,024
but there's no drama here.

415
00:21:01,025 --> 00:21:02,901
I've been faithful to my husband.

416
00:21:02,902 --> 00:21:04,994
I have nothing to hide.

417
00:21:12,993 --> 00:21:13,922
Give me that.

418
00:21:18,719 --> 00:21:20,124
Ah.

419
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:21,392
Good morning.

420
00:21:22,701 --> 00:21:23,530
Good morning.

421
00:21:23,974 --> 00:21:25,208
Did you have trouble sleeping?

422
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,016
Ah, I was up kinda late.

423
00:21:28,505 --> 00:21:30,796
Boy, that Tom sure can talk.

424
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,164
You were up with Tom?

425
00:21:36,269 --> 00:21:39,889
Huh? Oh. Yeah. I guess
he had a lot on his mind.

426
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:43,860
No surprise after the way things
went between you two yesterday.

427
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:46,340
He was complaining about that?

428
00:21:47,191 --> 00:21:48,649
Oh, I don't want to get in the middle.

429
00:21:49,386 --> 00:21:51,633
Honey, you had a pajama party
with my husband

430
00:21:51,634 --> 00:21:53,281
at 3:00 in the morning.

431
00:21:53,282 --> 00:21:54,398
You're in the middle.

432
00:21:54,921 --> 00:21:55,782
Well...

433
00:21:56,984 --> 00:22:00,364
Tom feels that you don't listen to him.

434
00:22:00,881 --> 00:22:03,214
Okay. G... Sure I do.

435
00:22:03,215 --> 00:22:05,732
I heard that whole spiel
about male postpartum,

436
00:22:05,733 --> 00:22:08,117
otherwise known by its initials... B.S.

437
00:22:08,186 --> 00:22:09,325
See, that's just the thing.

438
00:22:09,326 --> 00:22:11,971
He thinks you hear, but you don't listen.

439
00:22:11,972 --> 00:22:12,924
Okay.

440
00:22:13,238 --> 00:22:15,688
Okay, you stop.

441
00:22:16,424 --> 00:22:18,095
I don't need you
troubleshooting my marriage.

442
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:19,772
And I don't want you having any more

443
00:22:19,773 --> 00:22:21,932
of these little conversations
with my husband.

444
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:23,291
Okay. Fine.

445
00:22:26,504 --> 00:22:27,842
And I mean it.

446
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:40,584
There you are! I called you an hour ago!

447
00:22:40,618 --> 00:22:42,186
I was at school.

448
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:45,589
Hi, sweetie! The kids
in your class made you a poster.

449
00:22:46,443 --> 00:22:49,695
- Look what Brittany said.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. She loves it. Come on!

450
00:22:49,696 --> 00:22:50,669
Come on!

451
00:22:55,306 --> 00:22:57,475
Oh! What is going on?!

452
00:22:57,476 --> 00:22:58,110
Okay.

453
00:22:58,575 --> 00:23:00,266
Do you remember eight years ago

454
00:23:00,267 --> 00:23:02,050
when we went on that ski weekend?

455
00:23:02,517 --> 00:23:04,165
Uh... vaguely.

456
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:05,949
No, no, no, no, no! It can't be "vaguely."

457
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:09,228
- I need you to focus.
- Oh! Oh! Okay.

458
00:23:09,229 --> 00:23:10,186
Okay.

459
00:23:10,595 --> 00:23:13,757
Remember how you and I had
dinner with that French guy?

460
00:23:13,758 --> 00:23:16,404
The one you referred to as le package?

461
00:23:16,405 --> 00:23:17,296
Exactly.

462
00:23:17,501 --> 00:23:20,650
Okay. Tell me everything you remember.

463
00:23:21,963 --> 00:23:26,428
Ooh! I remember I had the fondue
and I lost my strawberry,

464
00:23:26,429 --> 00:23:27,848
and the waiter
almost caught me when I put my...

465
00:23:27,849 --> 00:23:30,615
I'm talking about me and the package!

466
00:23:30,616 --> 00:23:34,417
- Why are you yelling at me?
- 'Cause I'm mad! You went off to bed

467
00:23:34,418 --> 00:23:36,587
and left me and frenchie
drinking at the hotel bar,

468
00:23:36,588 --> 00:23:38,057
and friends don't let friends flirt drunk!

469
00:23:38,092 --> 00:23:39,681
Now for the love of God,

470
00:23:39,682 --> 00:23:42,207
do you at least remember
when I came back to the room?

471
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,560
I remember the sun was coming up.

472
00:23:47,561 --> 00:23:48,750
Oh, God.

473
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:51,284
Gaby, you're not saying...

474
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:52,537
Yeah.

475
00:23:53,671 --> 00:23:55,869
I think Juanita might be French.

476
00:24:00,684 --> 00:24:03,519
When Carlos returned
from his business trip.

477
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,572
He stopped at the hospital
to visit his daughter,

478
00:24:06,573 --> 00:24:08,807
who had been sleeping peacefully.

479
00:24:10,212 --> 00:24:12,846
Then he came home to see his wife,

480
00:24:12,847 --> 00:24:15,784
who had been plotting frantically.

481
00:24:39,327 --> 00:24:40,341
Oh, you're awake.

482
00:24:47,623 --> 00:24:50,204
Mmm. You're really awake.

483
00:24:57,177 --> 00:24:57,899
What...

484
00:24:58,769 --> 00:25:00,172
Carlos, what are you doing?!

485
00:25:00,173 --> 00:25:03,459
Me? I just got into bed!
You climbed on top of me.

486
00:25:03,948 --> 00:25:05,031
- I did?
- Yeah.

487
00:25:05,032 --> 00:25:07,760
You were kinda making out with me.
Not that I'm complaining.

488
00:25:08,505 --> 00:25:11,327
Oh, no. It's happening again!

489
00:25:12,132 --> 00:25:13,412
What are you talking about?

490
00:25:14,485 --> 00:25:16,119
My sexsomnia.

491
00:25:17,434 --> 00:25:18,493
Your what?

492
00:25:19,282 --> 00:25:21,744
Yeah, it's like sleepwalking, except...

493
00:25:22,115 --> 00:25:25,705
instead of using your legs,
you use your... you know.

494
00:25:28,272 --> 00:25:29,667
Sexsomnia.

495
00:25:29,668 --> 00:25:31,032
It's real. Look it up.

496
00:25:31,246 --> 00:25:33,113
Since when have you had that?

497
00:25:34,484 --> 00:25:36,856
Well, definitely
before the girls were born.

498
00:25:37,665 --> 00:25:39,131
I've never seen you do it before.

499
00:25:39,132 --> 00:25:42,080
Well, it mostly only happens
when I'm really tired,

500
00:25:42,967 --> 00:25:44,598
like when I work out too much

501
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:45,903
or go skiing.

502
00:25:47,498 --> 00:25:48,287
Well, then first thing tomorrow,

503
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,704
I'm checking out airfare to Aspen.

504
00:25:49,705 --> 00:25:52,466
No! No, no, no. It's not a joke.
It's dangerous.

505
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:54,119
It doesn't matter who I'm next to.

506
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,925
I could have sex and not even know it.

507
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,411
Wow.

508
00:25:59,534 --> 00:26:00,546
Well, since you're up...

509
00:26:00,547 --> 00:26:01,676
No, I'm too tired...

510
00:26:03,199 --> 00:26:05,276
And ashamed. Good night.

511
00:26:09,583 --> 00:26:10,728
Hey, I thought I'd return this.

512
00:26:10,729 --> 00:26:13,705
- I borrowed it from Orson a while back.
- Oh. Thank you.

513
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:15,986
So where's that chippendale dancer

514
00:26:15,987 --> 00:26:17,733
you hired to fix your house?

515
00:26:17,734 --> 00:26:19,970
If you mean my contractor,
his name is Keith,

516
00:26:19,971 --> 00:26:21,452
and I had to let him go.

517
00:26:22,104 --> 00:26:26,461
Why? You catch him, uh,
grating cheese on his abs?

518
00:26:28,089 --> 00:26:29,734
It just wasn't working out.

519
00:26:30,972 --> 00:26:31,825
Must've been pretty bad for you

520
00:26:31,826 --> 00:26:34,722
to kick that shirtless wonder
out of your front yard.

521
00:26:35,272 --> 00:26:38,181
I was finally reaching
my target heart rate on my walk.

522
00:26:38,833 --> 00:26:41,160
You mean at your age,
you still have urges to...

523
00:26:41,161 --> 00:26:42,481
I'm not dead, Bree.

524
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:45,616
I may like my bed and my food soft,

525
00:26:45,617 --> 00:26:49,651
- but I like my men...
- Okay. Okay. Just curious.

526
00:26:51,729 --> 00:26:52,994
I guess I was hoping...

527
00:26:54,314 --> 00:26:55,065
Hoping what?

528
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:58,907
That one day I might outgrow all this.

529
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:01,758
Ah, that's why you fired Keith.

530
00:27:01,906 --> 00:27:05,110
I just can't have him around.
He's too distracting.

531
00:27:05,111 --> 00:27:07,340
And I refuse to make a fool of myself.

532
00:27:07,479 --> 00:27:09,066
And how would that happen?

533
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,994
Well, let me run the numbers for you.

534
00:27:11,995 --> 00:27:13,351
My marriage ended six days ago,

535
00:27:13,352 --> 00:27:15,464
Keith is 15 years too young for me,

536
00:27:15,465 --> 00:27:17,200
and my track record with lovers...

537
00:27:17,201 --> 00:27:19,104
two dead, one in a wheelchair.

538
00:27:19,105 --> 00:27:21,623
Bree, I can't tell you
how to live your life.

539
00:27:21,624 --> 00:27:25,344
All I know is that not living
your life isn't the answer.

540
00:27:25,345 --> 00:27:28,189
I've just... never been
very good at taking risks.

541
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,164
Well, then get good,
because take my word for it,

542
00:27:31,165 --> 00:27:34,462
once they turn into regrets,
it's too late.

543
00:27:42,348 --> 00:27:43,149
Okay.

544
00:27:44,422 --> 00:27:45,221
Hi.

545
00:27:47,464 --> 00:27:49,276
Don't feel like you have
to help or anything.

546
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:50,308
Cool.

547
00:27:50,739 --> 00:27:51,534
Oh.

548
00:27:51,923 --> 00:27:54,125
Where's your dad? His car's gone.

549
00:27:54,325 --> 00:27:56,172
Uh, he and Renee went out to dinner.

550
00:27:57,839 --> 00:27:58,934
He and Renee?

551
00:27:59,221 --> 00:28:01,492
Yeah. They went to
that French restaurant dad likes.

552
00:28:01,744 --> 00:28:03,488
They said you could join them if you want.

553
00:28:03,503 --> 00:28:06,039
Oh, I want.

554
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:09,185
Okay, you unload these groceries

555
00:28:09,592 --> 00:28:11,810
and look after your sister.

556
00:28:11,844 --> 00:28:13,177
Nah, I've got plans tonight.

557
00:28:13,178 --> 00:28:14,811
I don't want to get stuck babysitting.

558
00:28:15,729 --> 00:28:16,396
Cool.

559
00:28:38,058 --> 00:28:38,924
Hey.

560
00:28:39,813 --> 00:28:41,632
Hey. Good, you got the message.

561
00:28:41,633 --> 00:28:44,394
Loud and clear. So you guys sure look like

562
00:28:44,395 --> 00:28:46,583
you're discussing something heavy.

563
00:28:47,144 --> 00:28:48,390
Ahem. What's up?

564
00:28:51,095 --> 00:28:53,313
To be honest, I was talking about you...

565
00:28:55,793 --> 00:28:57,322
and your tendency to be critical,

566
00:28:58,415 --> 00:29:00,306
and how frustrating it is
to have my feelings invalidated

567
00:29:00,307 --> 00:29:02,353
whenever I bring up
something you don't like.

568
00:29:04,377 --> 00:29:05,432
Uh-huh.

569
00:29:06,549 --> 00:29:08,664
Renee, sidebar.

570
00:29:15,426 --> 00:29:17,568
Did I or did I not tell you

571
00:29:17,569 --> 00:29:19,622
to butt the hell out of my marriage?

572
00:29:19,623 --> 00:29:20,290
What did I do?

573
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:22,800
I was just finishing my dessert
and listening to the guy talk.

574
00:29:22,801 --> 00:29:26,946
"How frustrating it is
to have my feelings invalidated"?

575
00:29:26,947 --> 00:29:31,551
That's got your $500-an-hour shrink
written all over it.

576
00:29:31,907 --> 00:29:34,534
- I was just trying to help.
- That's a load of crap.

577
00:29:35,051 --> 00:29:37,568
You need a project,
and since you're currently without

578
00:29:37,569 --> 00:29:39,042
a house to remodel, you've decided

579
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:41,760
to put the wrecking ball to my marriage.

580
00:29:41,938 --> 00:29:44,133
- Oh, please.
- This is what you do.

581
00:29:44,134 --> 00:29:47,357
You take other people's lives apart
for your own amusement,

582
00:29:47,358 --> 00:29:49,843
and then you get
the fun of putting them back together.

583
00:29:49,844 --> 00:29:51,965
Well, I'm not letting you do it this time.

584
00:29:52,879 --> 00:29:57,377
My marriage is not some guest bathroom

585
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:59,198
in your summer house.

586
00:30:00,343 --> 00:30:01,618
Fine. Let's just say that you're right,

587
00:30:01,619 --> 00:30:02,943
and I'm a terrible person.

588
00:30:03,686 --> 00:30:05,238
But there's still a man
in there who is in pain,

589
00:30:05,239 --> 00:30:09,288
and his wife won't listen to him.
That's not my doing.

590
00:30:10,985 --> 00:30:12,762
I think this sidebar is over.

591
00:30:29,308 --> 00:30:30,435
Hey, Susan?

592
00:30:30,436 --> 00:30:32,436
Hey.

593
00:30:32,437 --> 00:30:35,678
Oh, those are beautiful.
What's the occasion?

594
00:30:36,186 --> 00:30:37,485
I called the bank

595
00:30:37,486 --> 00:30:40,391
to see if they would give us
an extension on our car payment,

596
00:30:40,392 --> 00:30:43,072
and the guy told me you already paid it.

597
00:30:43,073 --> 00:30:45,603
Had a good week with my jewelry.

598
00:30:46,294 --> 00:30:47,725
You're amazing.

599
00:30:47,726 --> 00:30:48,640
You teach,

600
00:30:48,641 --> 00:30:51,524
you bust your ass
with this jewelry business,

601
00:30:51,525 --> 00:30:52,450
and I come home yesterday,

602
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:55,080
and here you are, as happy as can be,

603
00:30:55,081 --> 00:30:57,682
working to make this place a home.

604
00:30:58,677 --> 00:31:01,552
I'm so lucky to have a wife like you.

605
00:31:03,564 --> 00:31:04,315
Mmm.

606
00:31:15,406 --> 00:31:16,431
Wow.

607
00:31:16,432 --> 00:31:18,189
There ya go.

608
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,926
That's quite a haul.

609
00:31:19,927 --> 00:31:21,138
You know, you're gettin' good as this.

610
00:31:21,139 --> 00:31:23,383
I didn't think that was gonna happen.

611
00:31:23,901 --> 00:31:26,908
I'm also getting good
at lying to my husband.

612
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:30,941
I didn't think
that was gonna happen either.

613
00:31:48,426 --> 00:31:51,047
Hello, Keith.

614
00:31:52,957 --> 00:31:54,439
How'd you find me?

615
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,984
You follow the scent of
my nonexistent cologne?

616
00:31:57,985 --> 00:32:00,982
No. Your answering service said
I might find you here.

617
00:32:04,741 --> 00:32:07,330
I was a little out of sorts the other day,

618
00:32:07,331 --> 00:32:10,084
and... uh, well, long story short,

619
00:32:10,085 --> 00:32:13,478
I was hoping you'd consider coming back.

620
00:32:19,965 --> 00:32:22,474
I've got a buddy, loves sports cars.

621
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,432
I told him to buy an old Pontiac G.T.O.

622
00:32:25,433 --> 00:32:27,677
They run great, they're easy to work on.

623
00:32:27,953 --> 00:32:29,812
But he bought a Maserati.

624
00:32:30,495 --> 00:32:31,928
The thing is always in the shop,

625
00:32:32,529 --> 00:32:33,552
very temperamental,

626
00:32:33,741 --> 00:32:35,551
real pain in the ass.

627
00:32:38,114 --> 00:32:41,844
You seem like kind of a Maserati to me.

628
00:32:45,409 --> 00:32:47,108
I'm no Maserati, Keith.

629
00:32:47,223 --> 00:32:50,301
I'm a family sedan with a beige interior

630
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:53,615
who's going through a divorce.

631
00:32:54,421 --> 00:32:56,133
Well, I'm sorry about that,

632
00:32:56,829 --> 00:32:58,317
but I'm still gonna pass.

633
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:11,788
I-I need you.

634
00:33:13,342 --> 00:33:15,029
You've seen my house. It's kind of a mess.

635
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:19,152
And the truth is,
my life's kind of a mess, too.

636
00:33:19,153 --> 00:33:20,930
And when you came in

637
00:33:20,931 --> 00:33:23,663
with all your energy
and your wonderful ideas,

638
00:33:23,664 --> 00:33:25,044
I started feeling like

639
00:33:25,045 --> 00:33:28,906
maybe you were gonna help me
put it all back together...

640
00:33:30,815 --> 00:33:32,775
My house, not my life.

641
00:33:32,776 --> 00:33:35,610
I just want you to work on the house.

642
00:33:39,615 --> 00:33:40,976
Wow.

643
00:33:42,221 --> 00:33:44,541
I really do sound like a Maserati.

644
00:33:44,542 --> 00:33:45,866
Um...

645
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:50,712
Thanks for listening.

646
00:34:03,879 --> 00:34:04,916
Hey!

647
00:34:07,718 --> 00:34:08,855
Oh, my God.

648
00:34:08,856 --> 00:34:11,679
Oh, my God! Are you all right?

649
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:14,970
- I didn't see you there.
- You've got great legs.

650
00:34:14,971 --> 00:34:18,028
You ever consider
just jogging from place to place?

651
00:34:18,029 --> 00:34:20,019
What were you doing behind my car?

652
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:22,154
I thought about what you said.

653
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:27,355
It'd be a shame
if we didn't finish what we started.

654
00:34:28,391 --> 00:34:32,241
Are you sure? It's a big job,
and the boss is kinda nutty.

655
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:34,994
I love a challenge.

656
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:39,296
Now can I get your insurance information?

657
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,130
So...

658
00:34:50,131 --> 00:34:51,970
How are you doing?

659
00:34:52,731 --> 00:34:54,451
What's this? Genuine concern?

660
00:34:55,467 --> 00:34:57,479
No asking if my breasts feel swollen

661
00:34:57,621 --> 00:34:59,242
or if it's a heavy flow day?

662
00:34:59,515 --> 00:35:02,151
I know I was dismissive before,

663
00:35:02,152 --> 00:35:04,324
and I want to apologize.

664
00:35:05,338 --> 00:35:08,843
I read the pamphlet,
and it actually made sense.

665
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:12,388
Becoming a new dad
at your age can be pretty scary.

666
00:35:12,389 --> 00:35:15,374
I mean, just looking at that little girl

667
00:35:15,375 --> 00:35:18,229
and knowing you might not be
around for her wedding...

668
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:20,301
Is this supposed to be helping me?

669
00:35:20,302 --> 00:35:24,192
I'm saying it's real, and I get it.

670
00:35:24,193 --> 00:35:26,427
And now in order to demonstrate that

671
00:35:26,428 --> 00:35:29,302
I am a loving and caring wife,
I have two options.

672
00:35:29,303 --> 00:35:32,095
One, we can have a long,
sensitive conversation

673
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:35,093
about your feelings, or option two...

674
00:35:39,766 --> 00:35:40,963
Mmm.

675
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:48,756
As much I like option two,

676
00:35:48,757 --> 00:35:50,828
I think tonight...

677
00:35:50,829 --> 00:35:53,205
I wanna talk.

678
00:35:53,206 --> 00:35:55,186
Oh.

679
00:35:55,187 --> 00:35:57,361
You got it.

680
00:36:03,883 --> 00:36:05,426
What... what's that?

681
00:36:05,427 --> 00:36:06,809
I got you a little something.

682
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:08,404
Oh.

683
00:36:15,515 --> 00:36:17,699
Try it on.

684
00:36:20,015 --> 00:36:21,559
Paul...

685
00:36:22,078 --> 00:36:24,339
This isn't... really my style.

686
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:26,402
Let me be the judge of that.

687
00:36:26,403 --> 00:36:30,059
We talked about this.
You said we could take it slow.

688
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:32,609
It's been almost a week.
Isn't that slow enough?

689
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:34,570
Try it. Maybe it'll put you in the mood.

690
00:36:34,571 --> 00:36:36,205
- It won't.
- Come on.

691
00:36:36,206 --> 00:36:37,972
Paul, no.

692
00:36:37,973 --> 00:36:41,427
How could you possibly think
I would wear something like this?

693
00:36:51,718 --> 00:36:52,815
What are those?

694
00:36:52,816 --> 00:36:54,694
The letters you sent me in prison.

695
00:36:54,695 --> 00:36:55,761
Oh.

696
00:36:57,458 --> 00:36:59,042
Read this.

697
00:36:59,043 --> 00:37:01,074
- Paul, please don't get upset...
- Out loud.

698
00:37:04,396 --> 00:37:06,234
"I long for you to kiss my neck,"

699
00:37:06,235 --> 00:37:09,993
"to whisper in my ear while
you unbutton my blouse."

700
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:11,385
Go on.

701
00:37:14,921 --> 00:37:16,890
"And then... make love to me..."

702
00:37:16,891 --> 00:37:18,425
"all night long."

703
00:37:19,015 --> 00:37:20,405
Did you write these?

704
00:37:20,406 --> 00:37:21,544
It was a fantasy.

705
00:37:21,545 --> 00:37:24,002
- I never thought it would be real.
- It is real.

706
00:37:24,003 --> 00:37:26,207
- Paul, please...
- We're married now. What did you expect?

707
00:37:26,208 --> 00:37:29,163
I thought you would stay in prison.

708
00:37:31,593 --> 00:37:33,097
I didn't mean that.

709
00:37:34,021 --> 00:37:35,301
I'm sorry.

710
00:37:44,363 --> 00:37:47,531
It's not a surprise to me
that you have some issues.

711
00:37:47,532 --> 00:37:51,209
I mean, you married a man
in prison for murder.

712
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:54,613
Clearly, you are a disturbed young woman.

713
00:37:55,405 --> 00:37:56,908
The good news is,

714
00:37:56,909 --> 00:37:59,143
I'm willing to help you.

715
00:37:59,144 --> 00:38:02,891
All I ask in return is
for a little affection.

716
00:38:02,892 --> 00:38:05,137
Do you think you can offer me that?

717
00:38:07,281 --> 00:38:08,784
I'll try.

718
00:38:09,831 --> 00:38:12,330
Good.

719
00:38:18,252 --> 00:38:20,628
I'm a patient man, Beth.

720
00:38:20,629 --> 00:38:23,016
But just so we're clear,

721
00:38:23,017 --> 00:38:25,566
I won't be patient forever.

722
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:43,291
Don't worry. I cleaned the pot.

723
00:38:44,927 --> 00:38:46,440
The way things have been going lately,

724
00:38:46,441 --> 00:38:49,355
I'm not as worried about
taste as I am poison.

725
00:38:49,356 --> 00:38:52,138
Look, what you did was borderline evil.

726
00:38:52,139 --> 00:38:54,576
But you were right to make me talk to Tom,

727
00:38:54,577 --> 00:38:57,116
so I thank you for being a good friend,

728
00:38:57,117 --> 00:39:00,298
and don't ever do it again.

729
00:39:00,299 --> 00:39:02,716
You're welcome.

730
00:39:03,377 --> 00:39:05,114
You know,
when I don't feel like killing you,

731
00:39:05,115 --> 00:39:08,618
I think I like having you around.

732
00:39:08,619 --> 00:39:11,929
Good to know since I just rented
the most charming bungalow

733
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:14,856
right here on Wisteria Lane.

734
00:39:15,933 --> 00:39:17,862
You're kidding.

735
00:39:17,863 --> 00:39:19,528
Edie's old house?

736
00:39:19,529 --> 00:39:21,815
Wow, that is so...

737
00:39:23,085 --> 00:39:24,435
Wonderful?

738
00:39:24,436 --> 00:39:26,529
Close.

739
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:31,678
Um, I-I'm trying to calm the baby,

740
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:34,228
but apparently I don't have
the right equipment.

741
00:39:34,229 --> 00:39:35,560
Did you hear the big news?

742
00:39:35,561 --> 00:39:39,714
Renee is moving in just
a stone's throw away from us.

743
00:39:39,715 --> 00:39:42,690
You do know that's
just an expression, right?

744
00:39:42,691 --> 00:39:44,438
We'll see.

745
00:39:48,146 --> 00:39:49,522
Do you really think it's a good idea

746
00:39:49,523 --> 00:39:51,278
for you to move here?

747
00:39:51,279 --> 00:39:53,503
Of course. It'll be a nice, fresh start.

748
00:39:53,504 --> 00:39:55,922
Plus I can be close to my dear friend.

749
00:39:56,724 --> 00:39:58,746
It's just, um...

750
00:40:01,154 --> 00:40:04,454
- I wanna be sure...
- Tom, that was a million years ago.

751
00:40:04,455 --> 00:40:08,773
It doesn't matter. She can never
know what happened between us.

752
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:18,108
Have you seen my wife?

753
00:40:18,109 --> 00:40:20,932
Yeah, she's in the cafeteria.
Oh, while I've got you,

754
00:40:20,933 --> 00:40:24,507
could I have you sign these release forms?

755
00:40:24,508 --> 00:40:26,590
Then you'll be able to take Juanita home.

756
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:29,983
What's this torn page on her chart?

757
00:40:29,984 --> 00:40:32,646
Let's just say your wife has
a bit of a temper.

758
00:40:33,986 --> 00:40:35,459
What happened?

759
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,643
Well, it's not really my place,

760
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:40,233
but she did have a strong reaction

761
00:40:40,234 --> 00:40:43,444
when I told her
your daughter's blood type.

762
00:40:46,136 --> 00:40:48,260
Gaby did this?

763
00:40:48,899 --> 00:40:52,799
I need you to tell me
exactly what happened.

764
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,588
Oh, crap.

765
00:40:55,726 --> 00:40:57,361
Gaby, come back here!

766
00:40:57,362 --> 00:40:58,896
It's not my fault! I have a disorder!

767
00:40:58,897 --> 00:41:00,643
- Gaby, we have to talk!
- Damn it! Aah!

768
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:02,999
Gaby!

769
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,580
See you in about two seconds.
Okay, here's what happened.

770
00:41:07,581 --> 00:41:09,146
It was on that ski weekend
eight years ago.

771
00:41:09,147 --> 00:41:10,385
I don't normally go for French guys,

772
00:41:10,386 --> 00:41:13,087
- but you know how I get
when I drink too much champagne.
- What?

773
00:41:13,961 --> 00:41:15,800
Well, I didn't think I slept with him,
but I must have,

774
00:41:15,801 --> 00:41:17,821
because why else would
our daughter have type-A blood?

775
00:41:21,867 --> 00:41:24,752
You're not killing me.
Why aren't you killing me?

776
00:41:26,582 --> 00:41:28,908
Baby, come with me.

777
00:41:28,909 --> 00:41:30,697
There's something I have to tell you.

778
00:41:40,614 --> 00:41:42,705
There are certain kinds of pain

779
00:41:43,061 --> 00:41:45,478
that can't be treated in a hospital,

780
00:41:46,143 --> 00:41:49,087
so those who are suffering
do what they can

781
00:41:49,349 --> 00:41:51,068
to heal themselves.

782
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:56,106
Some cure the ache of loneliness

783
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:58,308
by making new friends.

784
00:42:00,158 --> 00:42:03,192
Some soothe their excruciating guilt

785
00:42:03,665 --> 00:42:06,298
with an infusion of cash.

786
00:42:07,952 --> 00:42:10,412
Some alleviate their burning desire

787
00:42:10,826 --> 00:42:14,228
with small acts of kindness.

788
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:17,318
But sadly,

789
00:42:17,319 --> 00:42:20,877
there will always be those
who can't begin to heal...

790
00:42:23,008 --> 00:42:25,996
because they realize there is more pain

791
00:42:26,223 --> 00:42:27,818
yet to come.

792
