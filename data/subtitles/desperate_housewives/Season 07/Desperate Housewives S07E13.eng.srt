1
00:00:00,034 --> 00:00:02,457
<i>Previously on...

2
00:00:02,503 --> 00:00:04,770
Keith moved in with Bree.

3
00:00:04,805 --> 00:00:07,273
Susan came to grips with her future.

4
00:00:07,307 --> 00:00:09,809
Dialysis until they find me a donor.

5
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:12,345
- Well, that won't take very long, will it?
- Three to five years.

6
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:15,781
In grief over losing
her biological daughter...

7
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:18,251
Grace no longer exists,
and that is the last time

8
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:20,820
you will mention her name in this house!

9
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:23,623
Gaby sought comfort from an unusual source.

10
00:00:23,657 --> 00:00:27,955
- And there were some surprises...
- Somebody lose a gun?

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,103
Including a long lost son...

12
00:00:31,137 --> 00:00:33,038
- You didn't mention your mother-in-law.
- My mother-in-law?

13
00:00:33,072 --> 00:00:35,307
And a shocking revelation for Paul.

14
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:37,676
Felicia Tillman has gone
to some extraordinary lengths

15
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,144
to cause you harm.

16
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:46,518
Paul Young had made a discovery...

17
00:00:46,552 --> 00:00:49,821
his wife was a liar.

18
00:00:50,555 --> 00:00:54,258
She had lied with every smile,

19
00:00:54,292 --> 00:00:57,394
with every caress,

20
00:00:57,429 --> 00:01:01,031
and with every kiss.

21
00:01:01,066 --> 00:01:06,678
Yes, Paul now knew
their entire marriage was a fraud.

22
00:01:06,937 --> 00:01:10,507
The only thing he didn't know...

23
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:12,842
Hey there.

24
00:01:12,877 --> 00:01:15,979
Was how he would punish her.

25
00:01:16,013 --> 00:01:17,313
You're packing?

26
00:01:17,348 --> 00:01:19,292
I thought you weren't
coming home until tomorrow.

27
00:01:19,292 --> 00:01:21,182
I talked the doctor
into letting me out early.

28
00:01:21,695 --> 00:01:24,531
I'm glad. I really need you right now.

29
00:01:24,565 --> 00:01:27,767
Things on the street
have been getting very strange.

30
00:01:27,802 --> 00:01:31,378
Beth, things on that street
have always been very strange.

31
00:01:31,378 --> 00:01:33,323
Well, yes, but...

32
00:01:35,266 --> 00:01:38,081
Remember I told you
how Bree was inviting me over

33
00:01:38,081 --> 00:01:40,511
- for drinks with the other women?
- And I told you not to go.

34
00:01:40,511 --> 00:01:42,832
Well, I should've listened.

35
00:01:42,832 --> 00:01:45,253
Turns out they're trying to frame me.

36
00:01:45,315 --> 00:01:47,016
Frame you?

37
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,484
While I was there,

38
00:01:48,518 --> 00:01:51,820
I found a gun under my sofa cushion.

39
00:01:51,855 --> 00:01:53,822
It was a 38...

40
00:01:53,857 --> 00:01:56,292
The same caliber the police
said you were shot with.

41
00:01:56,326 --> 00:01:58,194
They must've planted it there.

42
00:01:58,228 --> 00:02:00,963
- And the gun just magically appeared?
- Yes.

43
00:02:00,997 --> 00:02:03,799
I'm sure Bree's going to
turn it over to the police,

44
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:06,468
and they're going to think I shot you.

45
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,406
Beth...

46
00:02:11,441 --> 00:02:14,643
you don't have to worry about
what anyone else thinks.

47
00:02:14,977 --> 00:02:16,654
I know the truth.

48
00:02:18,748 --> 00:02:21,592
Hey, here's an idea.

49
00:02:21,686 --> 00:02:23,531
Why don't we take a trip?

50
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:24,934
A trip?

51
00:02:25,021 --> 00:02:27,206
We need to get away.

52
00:02:27,275 --> 00:02:30,408
We'll go somewhere... secluded.

53
00:02:30,485 --> 00:02:32,288
Ohh.

54
00:02:32,362 --> 00:02:34,448
That sounds like heaven.

55
00:02:36,194 --> 00:02:37,426
Yes...

56
00:02:37,486 --> 00:02:40,604
Paul had no choice but to punish his wife...

57
00:02:40,673 --> 00:02:42,699
I love you.

58
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:45,061
Because some lies...

59
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,693
are unforgiveable.

60
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,970
We are reminded every spring...

61
00:03:03,004 --> 00:03:06,440
with every rose that blooms,

62
00:03:06,474 --> 00:03:10,677
with every sunflower that blossoms,

63
00:03:10,712 --> 00:03:15,082
with every lily that buds.

64
00:03:15,116 --> 00:03:20,154
The world is a beautiful place.

65
00:03:20,188 --> 00:03:25,492
Sadly, it is filled
with people who do ugly things...

66
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,998
Constantly.

67
00:03:35,336 --> 00:03:37,571
That woman who just drove away...
who was she?

68
00:03:37,605 --> 00:03:39,306
Uh... a friend.

69
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,742
You're friends with Barbara Fairchild,

70
00:03:41,776 --> 00:03:43,977
the interior designer?

71
00:03:44,012 --> 00:03:45,145
Bob?

72
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,815
Or should I say, the inferior designer?

73
00:03:49,717 --> 00:03:50,616
Hey, Renee.

74
00:03:50,616 --> 00:03:52,525
How could you hire Barbara Fairchild

75
00:03:52,525 --> 00:03:55,161
when you know I just started
my own interior design firm?

76
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,702
Uh... we're not hiring her.

77
00:03:57,736 --> 00:03:59,804
Oh? Why you holding swatches?

78
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,528
And people think you're the smart one.

79
00:04:05,528 --> 00:04:07,851
Look, you know
we just adopted a little girl.

80
00:04:07,851 --> 00:04:10,285
Well, we hired Barbara to decorate her room.

81
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,688
- Well, why not hire me?
- You're not exactly maternal.

82
00:04:12,722 --> 00:04:15,357
We-we wanted this room
to be pink and nurturing,

83
00:04:15,392 --> 00:04:18,594
and your style seems more
like chrome and glass and...

84
00:04:18,628 --> 00:04:20,763
teeth.

85
00:04:20,797 --> 00:04:23,098
Look who's back to being the smart one.

86
00:04:23,133 --> 00:04:25,501
Look, Fairchild is a hack.
Whatever she quoted you,

87
00:04:25,535 --> 00:04:28,103
I'll come in 2 days earlier
and 20% cheaper.

88
00:04:30,073 --> 00:04:32,074
- Barbara is kind of expensive.
- Done.

89
00:04:32,108 --> 00:04:34,943
I'll get started right away.

90
00:04:34,978 --> 00:04:37,279
Just so you know,
our daughter gets here in a week.

91
00:04:37,313 --> 00:04:41,383
And just so you know,
I'm as maternal as the next woman.

92
00:04:44,019 --> 00:04:45,920
Gaby?

93
00:04:45,954 --> 00:04:47,260
Hi, honey. You want some lunch?

94
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,922
No, I want an explanation.
I just got our credit card bill.

95
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,602
$840 at Miss Charlotte's doll academy?

96
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,936
Did I say lunch?

97
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,415
I meant sex. Do you want some sex?

98
00:04:59,485 --> 00:05:01,757
Why are you buying our kids fancy toys?

99
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:04,353
Last week, Juanita used her doll's leg

100
00:05:04,393 --> 00:05:06,089
to scrape peanut butter out of the jar.

101
00:05:06,144 --> 00:05:08,466
Okay, the doll wasn't for Juanita.

102
00:05:08,515 --> 00:05:10,266
It's for...

103
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,873
Bob and Lee, for the little girl
they're adopting.

104
00:05:13,927 --> 00:05:15,826
You spent $800 on a gift?

105
00:05:15,902 --> 00:05:19,096
It made me feel good, okay?
For the first time in weeks,

106
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:21,059
I'm not staying in bed
till 2:00 in the afternoon

107
00:05:21,108 --> 00:05:22,499
or staying up all night sobbing.

108
00:05:22,532 --> 00:05:24,644
So I went a little crazy on the credit card.

109
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,364
- Just let me be happy.
- But $800?!

110
00:05:27,436 --> 00:05:30,083
Carlos, if you get this worked up now,

111
00:05:30,143 --> 00:05:31,336
you'll have no place to go

112
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,036
when the bill for
the platinum card comes in.

113
00:05:37,751 --> 00:05:40,865
Uh, excuse me? Hi.

114
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:43,430
I'm looking for Keith Watson.

115
00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:45,359
His roommate told me he moved here.

116
00:05:45,398 --> 00:05:48,708
Uh, yes, but he's not
available at the moment.

117
00:05:48,752 --> 00:05:50,355
Can I give him a message, miss...

118
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:52,765
Sorry. I'm Amber James.

119
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,833
I just need to talk to him about something.

120
00:05:54,905 --> 00:05:56,112
It's kind of important.

121
00:05:56,176 --> 00:05:59,362
Well, I would be happy
to tell him what it's regarding

122
00:05:59,405 --> 00:06:02,536
if you... tell me... what it's regarding.

123
00:06:02,604 --> 00:06:05,351
We're just... old friends.

124
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:09,072
I'm at the Fairview motor inn.
Could you ask him to come by?

125
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:11,478
Why exactly would he be doing that?

126
00:06:14,678 --> 00:06:18,015
You're... kind of
a nosy landlady, aren't you?

127
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,612
I'm not his landlady. I'm his girlfriend.

128
00:06:23,981 --> 00:06:25,600
So he...

129
00:06:25,673 --> 00:06:28,538
lives here with you?

130
00:06:28,635 --> 00:06:30,258
Yes.

131
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:33,344
Yeah, of... of course he does.

132
00:06:33,412 --> 00:06:35,495
Of course he does.

133
00:06:35,574 --> 00:06:37,144
Are you all right?

134
00:06:37,234 --> 00:06:38,878
Um, yeah, I'm fine.

135
00:06:38,937 --> 00:06:41,949
You know what? Don't even, uh,
don't even tell him I came by.

136
00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:43,804
There's no message. Sorry to disturb you.

137
00:06:45,981 --> 00:06:48,062
Okay, you're all set.

138
00:06:48,136 --> 00:06:50,036
The dialysis will take six hours.

139
00:06:50,132 --> 00:06:52,507
- If you need anything,
just hit the call button.
- Will do.

140
00:07:04,075 --> 00:07:04,829
Hi.

141
00:07:05,686 --> 00:07:07,454
Hi.

142
00:07:08,192 --> 00:07:09,873
I'm Susan.

143
00:07:09,936 --> 00:07:13,082
It's my first time in here.

144
00:07:13,788 --> 00:07:15,765
Dick.

145
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,178
Sounds like you've been
coming here for a while.

146
00:07:20,256 --> 00:07:22,224
Four years.

147
00:07:25,206 --> 00:07:27,650
Any tips for a newbie?

148
00:07:28,575 --> 00:07:30,805
Like, which nurse has the shakes

149
00:07:30,844 --> 00:07:33,091
or where do they hide the good painkillers?

150
00:07:33,112 --> 00:07:34,031
Look, nothing personal,

151
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,206
but I don't want to be your dialysis buddy.

152
00:07:36,241 --> 00:07:38,387
I wanna sit here and
play scrabble on my phone

153
00:07:38,418 --> 00:07:41,790
while this... while
this machine washes my blood.

154
00:07:41,803 --> 00:07:47,126
So you don't want to talk or be friendly

155
00:07:47,179 --> 00:07:48,962
or keep each other company?

156
00:07:49,012 --> 00:07:51,505
Sad, isn't it?

157
00:07:53,805 --> 00:07:56,715
You know, Dick...

158
00:07:58,374 --> 00:08:00,843
sometimes when I meet people, they say,

159
00:08:00,912 --> 00:08:03,446
"you don't seem like a Susan."

160
00:08:03,514 --> 00:08:06,206
But you...

161
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,537
Why are you putting out
those ugly candlesticks?

162
00:08:16,602 --> 00:08:19,250
Oh. Who gave them to me?

163
00:08:19,313 --> 00:08:22,082
Yay! Grandma's coming.

164
00:08:22,106 --> 00:08:24,670
Yep, and your brother
just pulled up with her.

165
00:08:24,734 --> 00:08:27,095
This could be your last chance
to run screaming from the room.

166
00:08:27,149 --> 00:08:28,710
Why? I love grandma.

167
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,449
I do, too, sweetie. It's just...

168
00:08:31,493 --> 00:08:33,645
I can only take her in small doses,

169
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,256
and unfortunately, your grandma
doesn't come in small doses.

170
00:08:38,817 --> 00:08:39,481
Hey!

171
00:08:39,554 --> 00:08:42,426
Easy over the threshold!
You're not transporting meat.

172
00:08:42,506 --> 00:08:46,214
Okay, grandma, enjoy your visit.

173
00:08:46,263 --> 00:08:48,913
She's going back in a cab.

174
00:08:48,967 --> 00:08:51,253
Mom! Hi!

175
00:08:53,049 --> 00:08:55,657
Oh, my gosh! What happened to your foot?

176
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:59,939
Oh, I-I broke it a month ago.
Uh, thanks for checking in.

177
00:09:01,247 --> 00:09:04,830
Oh, I'm sorry.
We've just been so busy, and...

178
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:07,293
Penny, look, your grandma's here.

179
00:09:07,342 --> 00:09:08,473
Give her a kiss.

180
00:09:09,834 --> 00:09:13,557
Hey, look at you. You're getting buds!

181
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:18,616
Be thankful she didn't yell it to you

182
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,211
as you were getting on the bus.

183
00:09:20,898 --> 00:09:22,758
So... uh, what's new?

184
00:09:22,831 --> 00:09:27,382
Well... actually, um,
I started an interior design business.

185
00:09:27,437 --> 00:09:28,922
Do you remember my friend Renee?

186
00:09:28,981 --> 00:09:30,217
I'm getting married.

187
00:09:30,275 --> 00:09:33,181
What? Married?

188
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,781
To who?

189
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,462
Frank Kaminski.

190
00:09:37,525 --> 00:09:40,689
We met in water aerobics
at the retirement community.

191
00:09:40,767 --> 00:09:43,421
Only man in the pool.
I was lucky to get him.

192
00:09:43,481 --> 00:09:45,053
This is kind of a shock.

193
00:09:45,157 --> 00:09:46,565
I didn't even know you were dating.

194
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:49,060
So... when's the wedding?

195
00:09:49,114 --> 00:09:50,522
Saturday.

196
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,173
This saturday?

197
00:09:53,229 --> 00:09:55,716
Uh, and you're just telling me now?

198
00:09:55,765 --> 00:09:58,411
Well, maybe if you visited

199
00:09:58,446 --> 00:10:00,707
- more often...
- More often. I know.

200
00:10:00,761 --> 00:10:03,081
I know. So...

201
00:10:03,124 --> 00:10:04,771
do I get to meet him?

202
00:10:04,803 --> 00:10:07,754
I mean, if you're going
to make this kind of commitment...

203
00:10:07,778 --> 00:10:11,462
What? You wanna make sure
his intentions are honorable?

204
00:10:11,516 --> 00:10:14,021
Lynette, I hate to break this to you.

205
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:16,082
I am not a virgin.

206
00:10:16,135 --> 00:10:18,878
Mom... I want to meet him.

207
00:10:18,922 --> 00:10:21,785
All right, come by tomorrow,
and we'll squeeze you in

208
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:24,851
between "Nothing to do"
and "Waiting for death."

209
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,568
- Are you all right?
- What?

210
00:10:46,602 --> 00:10:48,637
You were yelling in your sleep.

211
00:10:48,671 --> 00:10:50,038
Really?

212
00:10:50,072 --> 00:10:53,241
Yes, you were shouting out, "Amber! Amber!"

213
00:10:53,276 --> 00:10:55,377
what could that mean?

214
00:10:55,811 --> 00:10:59,380
I'm... I'm doing a painting job.

215
00:10:59,415 --> 00:11:01,749
I'm thinking about, uh...

216
00:11:01,784 --> 00:11:04,519
Shades of yellow that go in the kitchen.

217
00:11:04,553 --> 00:11:08,022
Nope. Definitely not a color.
Sounded like a name... Amber.

218
00:11:08,057 --> 00:11:09,957
Know anyone by that name?

219
00:11:09,992 --> 00:11:13,528
I once had a girlfriend named Amber.

220
00:11:13,562 --> 00:11:15,563
Did you?

221
00:11:15,597 --> 00:11:17,965
And at this time I'd like to point out

222
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,867
that dreaming of an old girlfriend

223
00:11:19,902 --> 00:11:22,154
is not cheating.

224
00:11:22,154 --> 00:11:25,934
Well... when was this?

225
00:11:26,008 --> 00:11:27,277
You never told me about her.

226
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:32,451
I-I don't know. Seven years ago?

227
00:11:32,505 --> 00:11:34,267
Seven years?

228
00:11:34,356 --> 00:11:37,487
Was it serious?

229
00:11:39,891 --> 00:11:41,677
We lived together...

230
00:11:41,747 --> 00:11:44,474
for, uh, three years.

231
00:11:44,542 --> 00:11:46,301
So you were in love with her.

232
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,916
Well... yeah,

233
00:11:48,988 --> 00:11:51,716
until she left me.

234
00:11:55,835 --> 00:11:57,433
So she left you.

235
00:11:59,626 --> 00:12:02,342
You miss her?

236
00:12:02,427 --> 00:12:07,467
I tend to not dwell on people
who stomped on my heart.

237
00:12:07,522 --> 00:12:09,127
Now if you don't mind,
I'm gonna go back to sleep

238
00:12:09,171 --> 00:12:11,175
so I can dream about you.

239
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:21,245
It's so great visiting
a retirement village...

240
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,967
2 regular parking spaces, 48 handicapped.

241
00:12:24,012 --> 00:12:25,545
Hey, mom. Mwah.

242
00:12:25,569 --> 00:12:27,140
Lynette...

243
00:12:27,189 --> 00:12:29,307
This is Frank.

244
00:12:29,371 --> 00:12:31,601
It is so nice to meet you, Frank.

245
00:12:31,655 --> 00:12:33,316
Call me "dad."

246
00:12:33,365 --> 00:12:37,402
Wouldn't it be awful if I was that guy?

247
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:46,558
So... Frank, um,
I've just been dying to meet you, and...

248
00:12:46,612 --> 00:12:48,393
Just a sec. Hey, muchacho.

249
00:12:48,432 --> 00:12:51,579
We've been waiting ten minutes for our menu.

250
00:12:51,633 --> 00:12:54,895
What do I got to do to get you
to hurry it over, build a fence?

251
00:12:56,368 --> 00:12:59,829
Hey, it's a menu, not a high school diploma.

252
00:12:59,873 --> 00:13:01,755
I'm sure you can find one somewhere.

253
00:13:01,804 --> 00:13:05,485
Oh, yeah. You were saying something?

254
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:10,269
Lynette's been dying to meet you.

255
00:13:10,334 --> 00:13:11,900
She has so many questions.

256
00:13:11,949 --> 00:13:15,302
Oh, go ahead. I got time
to kill while I'm waiting

257
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,232
for Pancho Villa to get my menu.

258
00:13:18,036 --> 00:13:24,451
Okay. Uh... I was just wondering,

259
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:28,289
what made you decide
to propose to my mother?

260
00:13:28,353 --> 00:13:30,776
I love her. What do you think?

261
00:13:32,026 --> 00:13:36,188
Aw. What a short... angry story.

262
00:13:36,259 --> 00:13:40,040
Frank... is very to the point.

263
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,846
That's what first attracted me to him.

264
00:13:42,903 --> 00:13:46,088
- Oh.
- What else you need to know?

265
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:49,484
Um, have you ever been married before?

266
00:13:49,524 --> 00:13:52,860
Three times... two dead and two left me.

267
00:13:52,939 --> 00:13:56,662
Oh, wait a minute. That's four.
Yeah, then make it four.

268
00:13:58,298 --> 00:14:00,784
Now... you done grilling me?

269
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:06,336
Yes. I think I've learned
everything I need to know.

270
00:14:11,255 --> 00:14:13,241
- Hi, Gaby.
- Hey, Karen.

271
00:14:13,289 --> 00:14:15,278
I wanted to get the name
of that chinese place

272
00:14:15,307 --> 00:14:16,907
you and Roy are always raving about.

273
00:14:16,967 --> 00:14:19,164
Come on in. I'll get you the address.

274
00:14:20,685 --> 00:14:22,179
Carlos is a little grumpy

275
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,124
- since the credit card bills came in.
- Hmm.

276
00:14:24,178 --> 00:14:26,387
I figured a little M.S.G.
should calm him down.

277
00:14:26,436 --> 00:14:28,844
I've got a menu here somewhere.

278
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:33,373
I never noticed that before.

279
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:34,034
What?

280
00:14:34,093 --> 00:14:35,423
That doll.

281
00:14:35,476 --> 00:14:38,685
Oh, Adelaide. Heck,
I've had her since forever.

282
00:14:38,739 --> 00:14:40,749
She was my best friend growing up.

283
00:14:40,778 --> 00:14:44,071
I couldn't bear to toss her,
so there she is.

284
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,524
I didn't know you were into dolls.

285
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:50,714
I'm not really into them.
Oh! Here's the menu.

286
00:14:54,663 --> 00:14:57,566
Where did, uh, that come from?

287
00:14:57,616 --> 00:14:59,311
I carry her around with me.

288
00:15:00,223 --> 00:15:01,994
You do?

289
00:15:02,052 --> 00:15:04,747
Mm-hmm. Her name's princess Valerie.

290
00:15:04,816 --> 00:15:06,963
Oh! Look! They could be sisters.

291
00:15:07,579 --> 00:15:08,961
Okay.

292
00:15:09,019 --> 00:15:11,966
Oh, I have an idea.

293
00:15:12,015 --> 00:15:14,437
Miss Charlotte's doll academy,
where I got Valerie,

294
00:15:14,476 --> 00:15:15,277
has this tearoom.

295
00:15:15,312 --> 00:15:17,883
It is beautiful.
All of us should go sometime.

296
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:21,910
By all of us, you mean the dolls?

297
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:24,688
Of course. Should I make a reservation?

298
00:15:24,718 --> 00:15:28,021
Well... maybe.

299
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,450
I'm kinda curious to see
where this all goes.

300
00:15:30,509 --> 00:15:32,881
- Here.
- Thanks.

301
00:15:36,983 --> 00:15:38,777
Oh, no!

302
00:15:38,827 --> 00:15:40,099
What's wrong?

303
00:15:40,168 --> 00:15:43,191
I said "No mayo," Like, 15 times.

304
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:45,581
I'll trade with you. Do you want my salad?

305
00:15:45,636 --> 00:15:49,341
Uh, let me check. Nope, still got a penis.

306
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:52,502
I want my hamburger the way I ordered it.

307
00:15:52,546 --> 00:15:55,834
- I'll get you a new one.
- I got tee time in ten minutes.

308
00:15:55,908 --> 00:15:56,909
So go!

309
00:15:56,952 --> 00:16:00,479
It'll be waiting for you at the condo,
wrapped in foil,

310
00:16:00,508 --> 00:16:03,012
with an ice cold beer when you get there.

311
00:16:04,117 --> 00:16:06,354
You're... you're so good to me.

312
00:16:06,427 --> 00:16:09,497
See you at the wedding, Lorraine.

313
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:13,208
So what do you think?

314
00:16:13,257 --> 00:16:15,954
Well, he's quite a...

315
00:16:15,999 --> 00:16:19,550
I wouldn't even know where to...
Okay, he's gone.

316
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,640
- How can you marry that jerk?
- Lynette!

317
00:16:22,675 --> 00:16:26,130
I mean it. He's abrasive,
obnoxious, borderline racist...

318
00:16:26,178 --> 00:16:28,068
No, he crossed the border of racist.

319
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:31,660
He lives in racist.
You cannot seriously love him.

320
00:16:32,477 --> 00:16:33,525
I don't.

321
00:16:33,574 --> 00:16:36,030
You... you don't?

322
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,895
Then why are you marrying him?

323
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,739
Because he's loaded,

324
00:16:39,797 --> 00:16:43,107
and he hates his kids,
and he's got a bad ticker.

325
00:16:43,156 --> 00:16:46,833
And when he kicks the bucket,
I get everything.

326
00:16:47,981 --> 00:16:50,729
You're marrying him for his money?

327
00:16:50,789 --> 00:16:53,728
Please. I married for love three times

328
00:16:53,798 --> 00:16:57,562
and ended up brokenhearted and piss-poor.

329
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,775
And by the way,

330
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,146
he's getting something out of this, too.

331
00:17:02,171 --> 00:17:06,523
You wanna know how I really broke my foot?

332
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,217
Paul?

333
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:29,989
What are you doing up?
Is everything all right?

334
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:34,327
Couldn't sleep.

335
00:17:34,361 --> 00:17:41,028
I've just been... sitting here, thinking.

336
00:17:43,269 --> 00:17:45,226
About what?

337
00:17:47,963 --> 00:17:51,692
I have so much hatred inside me...

338
00:17:51,749 --> 00:17:55,567
from my neighbors who betrayed me...

339
00:17:55,629 --> 00:17:59,742
for my son who disowned me.

340
00:17:59,808 --> 00:18:04,293
For whoever tried to kill me.

341
00:18:07,093 --> 00:18:11,179
I'm tired of hating people,

342
00:18:11,253 --> 00:18:13,264
but I don't know how to stop.

343
00:18:13,308 --> 00:18:17,400
What a thing to say.

344
00:18:17,454 --> 00:18:21,011
Stop being so hard on yourself.

345
00:18:21,075 --> 00:18:22,924
You're a decent man.

346
00:18:22,956 --> 00:18:25,894
You just need to focus on
what's good in your life.

347
00:18:27,322 --> 00:18:30,495
What is that again?

348
00:18:31,367 --> 00:18:34,481
Well, for starters, me.

349
00:18:35,536 --> 00:18:40,933
I do think about you... all the time.

350
00:18:41,747 --> 00:18:43,706
From the first moment I met you,

351
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:47,237
all I wanted was for you to love me.

352
00:18:48,257 --> 00:18:52,201
And... here we are.

353
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:56,204
Here we are.

354
00:18:57,231 --> 00:18:59,129
You're just tired.

355
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:01,129
Come back to bed.

356
00:19:01,222 --> 00:19:04,127
All right.

357
00:19:04,982 --> 00:19:08,823
Tomorrow we can talk about our trip.

358
00:19:08,886 --> 00:19:10,654
We need to decide where we're going.

359
00:19:10,713 --> 00:19:12,512
Yes, about that...

360
00:19:12,581 --> 00:19:15,293
I booked us a cabin in the woods.

361
00:19:15,357 --> 00:19:18,986
Cabin? Oh, that sounds... rustic.

362
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:21,876
I need to go somewhere far away

363
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:23,906
where nobody can find us.

364
00:19:26,862 --> 00:19:27,994
Okay.

365
00:19:34,935 --> 00:19:36,896
You can be happy, Paul.

366
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,156
You just need to identify
what's negative in your life...

367
00:19:41,225 --> 00:19:43,682
and then get rid of it.

368
00:19:46,897 --> 00:19:49,129
That sounds like a plan.

369
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,619
Hey, Karen. Gaby's in the kitchen.

370
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:59,160
Actually, I wanna talk to you about Gaby.

371
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,040
How's she doing lately?

372
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,179
Well, you know, we went
through kind of a rough patch,

373
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,510
but I think she's coming around now.

374
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,930
Yeah? Well, think again.

375
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:17,610
Girls, dinner's ready!
I made your favorite...

376
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:25,840
What are you doing here?

377
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:26,509
Gaby.

378
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,269
Aah!

379
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,770
Jeez! You scared me.

380
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,940
This wasn't a gift for Bob and Lee, was it?

381
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:39,510
Why'd you lie to me?

382
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:43,129
Because I knew you wouldn't understand.

383
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:47,100
You spent $800 on a doll for yourself.

384
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:49,579
Y-you're right. I-I don't understand.

385
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,579
Oh, please.

386
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:54,169
Like this is any crazier
than your collections.

387
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,639
A steroid freak hits
a baseball over a fence,

388
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,389
and you paid thousands of dollars for it.

389
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,229
Yeah, well, I don't carry it around with me

390
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:03,579
- or take it to tea.
- Okay, first of all,

391
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,129
Mrs. McCluskey has a big mouth.

392
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,369
Second, the doll makes me happy.
What do you care?

393
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:10,350
Gaby, I want you to be happy,

394
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:12,880
but this is not about a doll.

395
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,590
You know what? I don't want
to talk about this anymore.

396
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,269
This is clearly about Grace.

397
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:21,610
No! No! No!

398
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:23,169
We're not supposed to talk about her!

399
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:24,770
That was your rule!

400
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,830
I'm going to get ready for dinner.

401
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:37,610
Hey, Susan.

402
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:39,439
I kept her warm for ya.

403
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,280
Thanks, Ethan. Hey,
how was your history final?

404
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,569
Aced it. Thank you for studying with me.

405
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:46,770
- No problem. I'll see you thursday.
- Yeah.

406
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,250
Ahem.

407
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,180
Scrabble.

408
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,259
Look, I know you don't wanna talk,

409
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,839
but I thought it would be
more fun to play with me

410
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,240
than with your phone.

411
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:09,030
Thanks, but I'll take the phone.

412
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,999
You know, this whole experience

413
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,599
is miserable and isolating enough.

414
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,479
I don't understand
why you wanna make it worse

415
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,020
by ignoring someone
who's going through the same ordeal.

416
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:23,259
Susan, did you ever see the old war movie

417
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:26,239
where the fresh young kid
comes in all bright-eyed,

418
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,090
and the old vet
won't give him the time of day?

419
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:31,719
I hate war movies.

420
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,710
Okay.

421
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:33,999
What about the one

422
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,739
where the girl moves to a different town,

423
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:39,160
and the mean cheerleader at her new school

424
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:40,880
doesn't wanna hang out with her?

425
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:41,890
Go on.

426
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:45,610
I'm the mean cheerleader. Okay?

427
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:49,310
And I'm letting you know
we're not going to be friends.

428
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:02,600
You know, I can see why you're frustrated.

429
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:07,449
Waiting for a transplant is brutal.

430
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:08,500
I-I get that.

431
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:12,809
But that doesn't mean that
you can't try to stay positive

432
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:15,070
while you wait for the good news.

433
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,080
The good news?

434
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:22,090
When this beeper goes off,
that means someone died.

435
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,529
That's what we're waiting for...
for some poor son of a bitch

436
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,770
who didn't use a helmet
or a seat belt to die.

437
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,409
We're waiting for a doctor to ask a family

438
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,769
who, moments earlier,
lost someone they loved

439
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:36,990
to let them harvest their organs.

440
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:40,050
And then we're waiting to see who gets them.

441
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:43,859
That's what we do. We wait for tragedy

442
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,519
and then cross our fingers that it's us

443
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,619
they wake up at 2:00 in the morning

444
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,220
with the good news.

445
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:51,760
Susan...

446
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:56,039
I know your intentions are good,

447
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,639
but you don't have to distract me

448
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,060
or entertain me or comfort me.

449
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:06,500
I wasn't trying to comfort... you.

450
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:19,849
- Hi, Amber.
- What are you doing here?

451
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,979
Well, you seemed so upset
when you came over,

452
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,959
and obviously it involves Keith,

453
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,559
or you wouldn't have come looking for him,

454
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,970
and so naturally I'm concerned.

455
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:30,660
Everything's fine. It's not a big deal.

456
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,510
Anyway, I'm...

457
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:35,490
sort of in the middle of packing, so...

458
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,009
Mommy, I can't find my ball.

459
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,140
Charlie, I'll be with you in a second, okay?

460
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,080
How old is Charlie?

461
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:50,460
6.

462
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,879
Keith and I would be great for a while

463
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,610
and then not so great.

464
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:07,260
I had actually moved out before
I realized I was pregnant.

465
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:09,100
So why didn't you tell Keith?

466
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:15,439
I had actually decided to give up the baby,

467
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,090
and I knew he would try
and talk me out of it.

468
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:23,660
Then I changed my mind
the moment I saw Charlie.

469
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,729
After that, it just never
felt right to come back

470
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,440
and ambush him with a kid.

471
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:32,370
And yet... here you are, ambushing.

472
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,739
It's just... Charlie is at that age

473
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,549
where he's starting
to ask a lot of questions,

474
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:39,619
and I'm running out of ways to be vague.

475
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:42,350
So Charlie is the only reason you came?

476
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,540
Okay.

477
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,939
Maybe I... was kind of wondering

478
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:50,180
if Keith would still be...

479
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,870
But I'm glad he's happy.

480
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:55,990
You seem really great.

481
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,859
I know I owe it to Charlie to tell Keith.

482
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:04,790
It's just... I don't think I can do it.

483
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:10,610
Would you like me to?

484
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,880
You would do that?

485
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:17,730
I think I have to.

486
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:21,979
Now, it's not exactly finished yet.

487
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,909
I'm still waiting on a few pieces,

488
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:26,299
and the curtains are on back order.

489
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,020
Don't worry. I'm sure it's amazing.

490
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:30,840
But you did keep the receipts, right?

491
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:47,540
Oh, my god.

492
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:51,800
It's exactly the room
I wanted when I was growing up.

493
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,579
I mean, the only thing that's missing is...

494
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,110
baby unicorns!

495
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,080
So... you like it?

496
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,989
Oh, we love it. Thank you, Renee.

497
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:03,499
It's everything we'd hoped for.

498
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,259
How did you put this together so quickly?

499
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,300
Oh, it was easy.

500
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:11,430
I've been thinking about
this room for 20 years.

501
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,229
Really?

502
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:16,460
There was a time when
I thought I might have kids.

503
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:19,239
I used to imagine the kind of room

504
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,580
I'd want my daughter to have. Mm.

505
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:25,690
Right down to the last detail.

506
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:29,910
I never knew you thought about kids.

507
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,000
Well, that was a long time ago.

508
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:37,440
It's never too late.
Heck, if we can adopt...

509
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:42,339
Excuse me. I've gotta find that painter.

510
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:45,590
This is not the color
we agreed on for the trim.

511
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:56,669
I can't do it. I can't be a party to this.

512
00:27:56,670 --> 00:28:00,189
I can't wheel her down
the aisle to marry some jackass

513
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,479
she doesn't even love.

514
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,360
Lynette, you have to do this.

515
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:07,620
Besides, you know,
think of what's at stake now.

516
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,490
What are you talking about?

517
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:12,039
Well, you know,
how can I put this delicately?

518
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,919
I mean, today your mother has money.

519
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,909
Someday soon she will die.

520
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:21,360
The day after that,
Tom and Lynette have money.

521
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,780
That's a horrible thing to say.

522
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,399
Well, just saying,
you've always wanted to put Paige

523
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,819
in private school,
and I've always wanted to know

524
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,440
what it's like to sleep on a yacht.

525
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:33,160
You're lucky you're holding the baby.

526
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:38,869
Lynette, in all seriousness,
it's your mother's wedding day.

527
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:40,480
If you don't support her,

528
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:43,040
you're gonna ruin your relationship.

529
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:46,900
Lynette!

530
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:49,270
Yeah?

531
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,079
They're playing my song.

532
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,690
Are you ready to wheel me down?

533
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,860
Lynette! Lynette!

534
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:31,549
Lynette!

535
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:32,739
What are you doing?

536
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:35,570
Okay, here's the thing.
I can't let you do this.

537
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,980
Who asked you?

538
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:39,919
You can't marry an obnoxious jerk like that.

539
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,649
Mom, you want me to visit more often?

540
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:45,119
That is never gonna happen
if you're with him.

541
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,269
And think about the example

542
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,889
you are setting your grandchildren...

543
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:49,609
marrying a guy for his money.

544
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:52,029
Now, look, Tom and I have a little savings...

545
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:57,580
Lynette, I know Frank's
a bit of an acquired taste.

546
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,080
But...

547
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,760
he needs me.

548
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,620
Nobody needs me anymore.

549
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:08,169
Your sisters are always busy.

550
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:10,160
I never see you.

551
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:14,029
I try to see you as much as I can, but...

552
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,070
I know.

553
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,180
Your family needs you.

554
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,380
And Frank... needs me.

555
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,809
Why didn't you tell me this?

556
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:30,729
Why did you let me think
it was all about the money?

557
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:32,999
I guess it was easier to say that

558
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,850
than to admit how... useless and...

559
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,140
lonely I feel.

560
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,990
Okay.

561
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:54,229
Hello? We're trying
to have a wedding out here.

562
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:58,649
Oh, sorry! My daughter doesn't think
you're good enough for me.

563
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:00,720
She's right. Now hurry it up.

564
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:03,449
This church is in one of
those ethnic neighborhoods,

565
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:05,170
and I'm worried about the car.

566
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,249
Renee, there is someone
we'd like you to meet.

567
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,520
This is our daughter.

568
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:27,279
- Hello.
- We just picked her up from the airport,

569
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,029
and we wanted you to be

570
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:29,759
the first person on the lane to meet her.

571
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,680
Oh, you didn't have to do that.

572
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:32,800
We know.

573
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,659
I think I'm gonna start
getting her settled in.

574
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:37,040
- Say good-bye to Mrs. Perry.
- Bye.

575
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:38,960
Come on.

576
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:42,219
She's absolutely precious.

577
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,130
Yeah. We're very lucky.

578
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:47,639
Listen, can I ask you for a favor?

579
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:51,100
Lee, you know I don't like
sentences that start that way.

580
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,699
Bob and I have been thinking,
and even though I know

581
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,989
we are gonna be great fathers,
there may be times

582
00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:00,669
that Jenny needs to talk
to a woman about... stuff.

583
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:03,339
And on those rare occasions,
I was wondering if we

584
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:05,010
could bring her over here.

585
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:07,960
Well...

586
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,390
sure.

587
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:13,749
Great. I will go tell our daughter

588
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:14,699
that if she needs anything,

589
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,729
she can count on her old auntie Renee.

590
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:20,840
And if she ever calls me "Old auntie,"
I will kick her.

591
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,930
Got it. Sorry.

592
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,879
Those are beautiful, Susan.

593
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,270
Thank you, Ethan.

594
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,589
Don't worry. They're not for you.

595
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:36,559
They're for people
who still possess an ounce of humanity.

596
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:40,099
Whatever you say, Pollyanna.
But if I see any mylar balloons

597
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,810
with-with dogs wearing stethoscopes,

598
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:44,860
I'm filing a complaint.

599
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:49,229
Why are you always so miserable?

600
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,940
It's called anger, Susan.

601
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:53,500
I'm sure you have it, too,

602
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:56,479
right underneath that
"Hang in there, kitty" smile.

603
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,450
- Hey, Dick, take it easy.
- It's okay, Ethan.

604
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:03,369
Fine. You're angry. The rest of us aren't.

605
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:07,010
So stop dragging us
into your circle of self-pity.

606
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:14,900
Ugh. Come on.

607
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,470
It's me.

608
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:29,790
I'm so happy for you.

609
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:31,980
Thank you.

610
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:34,520
I gotta go call my mom.

611
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,760
Yeah.

612
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:50,500
Ready, Susan?

613
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,470
Yes.

614
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:04,060
Actually, um, i-if it's okay, I'm gonna...

615
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:05,870
sit over here today.

616
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,530
Sure.

617
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:32,060
What are you doing?

618
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:34,449
Leaving a note for the gardener.

619
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:36,329
If he has any more problems
with those sprinklers,

620
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:39,060
I want him to know that
we'll be at the cabin.

621
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:41,690
Oh. Good idea.

622
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:56,059
Beth, I think we should bring
some extra blankets.

623
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,549
It might get cold.
Would you mind grabbing a couple?

624
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,670
Not at all.

625
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:10,730
Detectives. Everything okay?

626
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:14,369
I'm sure your wife told you
a gun was recently discovered

627
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:16,099
at Bree van de Kamp's house.

628
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,859
Yes, apparently it was the same caliber

629
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,179
that I was shot with.

630
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:21,569
Bree seems to think
your wife planted it there,

631
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:24,730
hoping to implicate some of
her friends in your shooting.

632
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:27,230
What an imagination she has.

633
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:31,770
So you've never seen this before?

634
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,010
Mr. Young?

635
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:42,920
Yes.

636
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,130
You seemed to have quite a reaction there.

637
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:49,690
I'm not comfortable
around firearms, that's all.

638
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,150
Well, just to be clear,

639
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:54,530
you do not believe
this belongs to your wife.

640
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:57,920
Detectives, I know for
a fact this is not Beth's gun.

641
00:35:58,670 --> 00:35:59,770
Good day.

642
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:11,819
Should we take two blankets or three?

643
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,900
Forget the blankets. The trip's off.

644
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,340
What? Why?

645
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:19,200
I got a call. There's a problem
with the cabin.

646
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:21,640
Oh, shoot.

647
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:24,400
And I was so looking forward to it.

648
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:25,990
Trust me, Beth.

649
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:28,400
I think you dodged a bullet here.

650
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:40,859
Mmm. I don't know what
you do to this chicken,

651
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:43,390
but it's the best thing
that I've ever had. Mmm.

652
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:49,710
So I, um, stopped by Bob and Lee's house.

653
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:52,960
They're so excited about
finally becoming fathers.

654
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:58,890
Which got me to thinking,

655
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,649
I know you had said

656
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:03,319
that you were okay with
not being able to have a child.

657
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,820
Is that... still the case?

658
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:08,520
Uh, yeah.

659
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:12,809
That didn't sound very convincing.

660
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:14,090
It's kind of a weird question.

661
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,890
Okay, well, let me rephrase it.

662
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:20,420
If you had the chance to be a father,
would you take it?

663
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,860
Bree, where is this coming from?
I thought we dealt with this.

664
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:29,669
Well, I just wanna make sure.
I don't want you to see

665
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:31,859
Bob and Lee with their child
and start to have regrets.

666
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,300
What do you want me to say?

667
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,999
All right, there was a time
in my life when I thought,

668
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,420
yeah. Yeah. I'd love to be a dad,
but then I met you.

669
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:47,349
I'm just saying... if you had the choice...

670
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:48,520
I don't.

671
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:57,270
This is really good chicken.

672
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:09,430
So?

673
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,030
I'm sorry.

674
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,910
He doesn't even wanna meet Charlie?

675
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:25,289
Well, you have to understand
that after six years,

676
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:28,630
Keith feels that it would be
too difficult for everyone.

677
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:31,550
Why did I wait so long?

678
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,270
Again, I am so sorry.

679
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:39,619
Oh, no. You don't have to do that.

680
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:42,559
Please. Keith and I feel that
we really need to do something.

681
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,420
So please... take it.

682
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:06,960
Sorry. I had to show
the sitter how to work the TV.

683
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:13,280
Now where is this chinese pl... aah!

684
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,800
You put her in a car seat?

685
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:22,510
Oh. Well, she's expensive,
and the way you drive...

686
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:25,560
Honey, I've been thinking.

687
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:29,460
Maybe we should go see a therapist together.

688
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,639
I don't need a therapist.

689
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:35,720
I think you do.
Maybe I haven't been fair to you.

690
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,870
But you do really need
to talk to someone about this.

691
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,970
Carlos, I'm not crazy.

692
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:44,740
Well, then should I change
the reservation to three?

693
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,849
Don't be ridiculous.
She's not gonna sit with us.

694
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:49,490
She fits right in my bag.

695
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,399
This doesn't look like
a place you'd put a restaurant.

696
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,419
No, it looks like a place you'd bury a body.

697
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:03,659
Will you please just put the address

698
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:07,529
- into the navigation system?
- For the tenth time, I don't need it.

699
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:10,499
- I know where Oak Park is.
- Carlos, I'm starving!

700
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,279
I will not think you're weak
if you use a navigation system!

701
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,490
Fine. I'll use it.

702
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:19,330
I'd much rather listen to that
annoying voice than that one.

703
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:26,380
What's the address?

704
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:29,859
- Okay. It's 1-1-9...
- Get out of the car!

705
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,999
Oh, god! Okay, okay, take it easy, man.

706
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,320
Now! Get out. We're doing it. Be cool.

707
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,920
Uh, can you hold on?

708
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:41,830
- What do you mean, hold on?!
Get the hell out of the car!
- Gaby!

709
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,710
I gotta get my baby!

710
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,980
Oh, crap. Just...

711
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:51,809
- It's a doll! What are you
trying to pull, bitch?!
- Oh, god.

712
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:54,119
- Get out before I put a bullet in you!
- No!

713
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,179
Gaby! Get out!

714
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,779
- I can't get the buckle!
- Gaby, come on!

715
00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:00,809
I can't get the buckle!
I can't get the buckle! Get... uhh!

716
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:04,890
No! Ohh! My baby! My baby! My baby!

717
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,330
My baby! Gaby!

718
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:08,810
It's not Grace!

719
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:33,440
Whoa. What are you doing to your roses?

720
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,060
Pruning them.

721
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,560
Looks like you're killing them.

722
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,459
I know it looks bad,

723
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,349
but sometimes you have to be ruthless

724
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:46,830
if you want something beautiful
to keep growing.

725
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:55,320
The world is filled
with people who do ugly things.

726
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:58,350
Why do they act this way?

727
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:05,030
Some lie to keep from losing what they love.

728
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:11,340
Some lash out because they fear the future.

729
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:18,130
Some put up walls because they have regrets.

730
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:25,070
Yes, everyone has a reason
for the ugly things they do...

731
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:28,540
and once we find out why...

732
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:32,580
then we can try to stop them.

733
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:35,639
