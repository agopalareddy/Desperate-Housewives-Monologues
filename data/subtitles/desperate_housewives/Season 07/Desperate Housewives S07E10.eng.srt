1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,570
<i>Previously on...

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:05,160
I was thinking about
this great guy from my past.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,165
<i>An evening of drinking led to a confession.

4
00:00:08,165 --> 00:00:10,168
- Tom.
- Tom Scavo?

5
00:00:10,632 --> 00:00:12,088
<i>Love of my life.

6
00:00:12,088 --> 00:00:14,146
I have to talk to you about
something really important.

7
00:00:14,146 --> 00:00:15,996
Did anyone order a shrimp cocktail

8
00:00:15,996 --> 00:00:18,417
with a puny engagement ring on the side?

9
00:00:18,594 --> 00:00:21,266
<i>Keith's plan to propose was thwarted.

10
00:00:21,266 --> 00:00:23,218
I really do love your son.

11
00:00:23,218 --> 00:00:26,467
Yeah, I see you with someone...
more your own age.

12
00:00:27,641 --> 00:00:30,442
- What are you doing?
- Memorizing your face.

13
00:00:30,442 --> 00:00:34,462
<i>Gaby said good-bye to
her biological daughter Grace.

14
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,291
A halfway house for convicts on our street?

15
00:00:37,431 --> 00:00:39,744
I now own seven houses on Wisteria Lane.

16
00:00:39,744 --> 00:00:42,124
<i>And Paul needed one more house...

17
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,669
I can offer you well above market value.

18
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:48,159
- How much above market value?
- We have to stick together.

19
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:50,430
<i>To achieve his goal.

20
00:00:57,293 --> 00:00:59,853
<i>We know what they look like.

21
00:01:02,431 --> 00:01:04,724
<i>We know how they dress...

22
00:01:07,441 --> 00:01:10,226
<i>and we know how they behave.

23
00:01:12,677 --> 00:01:17,434
<i>Yes, we can all recognize
the wrong kind of people.

24
00:01:18,236 --> 00:01:20,428
<i>And when we see them coming,

25
00:01:20,428 --> 00:01:23,790
<i>we do what we have to to protect ourselves.

26
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:24,607
Lynette!

27
00:01:24,865 --> 00:01:26,531
How are you this fine day?

28
00:01:26,531 --> 00:01:27,737
Who are these people?

29
00:01:27,737 --> 00:01:30,461
- Old friends.
- Ex-con friends?

30
00:01:30,461 --> 00:01:32,616
- Mm.
- Uh... aren't you jumping the gun?

31
00:01:32,616 --> 00:01:34,436
Until the homeowners association votes,

32
00:01:34,436 --> 00:01:36,470
you don't have approval for your project.

33
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:39,371
These men have volunteered
to get my halfway house ready.

34
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,715
Most of them live in
a dreadful facility on skid row.

35
00:01:42,715 --> 00:01:45,240
I told them that
if they participated in the remodel,

36
00:01:45,444 --> 00:01:47,050
I could get them transferred here.

37
00:01:47,473 --> 00:01:48,686
You're wasting their time,

38
00:01:48,686 --> 00:01:51,364
because this place is never going to open.

39
00:01:52,528 --> 00:01:55,110
Oh, I think it will.

40
00:01:55,388 --> 00:01:58,155
And won't it be nice
for these men to live on a street

41
00:01:58,155 --> 00:02:00,137
where children play in their front yards

44
00:02:10,035 --> 00:02:11,999
He doesn't have the votes.

45
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:15,437
He's got something up his sleeve.
What it is I don't know.

46
00:02:15,774 --> 00:02:17,174
Are we positive no one's planning on

47
00:02:17,174 --> 00:02:18,683
selling him their home?

48
00:02:19,362 --> 00:02:20,754
We can't take anyone for granted.

49
00:02:20,754 --> 00:02:22,784
We need to talk to everyone on the street.

50
00:02:23,245 --> 00:02:24,930
Good idea. We'll shore up support.

51
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,988
- And if we sense anyone starting to waver...
- How could they?

52
00:02:27,988 --> 00:02:30,184
Everyone knows what's at stake here.

53
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:31,505
I pray they do.

54
00:02:31,505 --> 00:02:34,521
I love this neighborhood,
and I don't want it to change.

55
00:02:34,751 --> 00:02:35,458
Let's go.

56
00:02:37,902 --> 00:02:39,235
<i>And with that,

57
00:02:39,235 --> 00:02:43,337
<i>my friends went to work
trying to stop Paul Young.

58
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:47,287
<i>He knew what they were up to.

59
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:50,663
<i>But he didn't care.

60
00:02:52,876 --> 00:02:54,508
<i>He should have.

61
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:57,361
<i>Paul had forgotten
what ordinary men and women

62
00:02:57,361 --> 00:03:00,446
<i>will do to protect themselves...

63
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:03,486
<i>from the wrong kind of people.

64
00:03:16,934 --> 00:03:21,579
<i>It was just before sunrise
on Wisteria Lane...

65
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:24,063
<i>when a cab arrived...

66
00:03:26,661 --> 00:03:28,592
<i>and a woman departed.

67
00:03:30,512 --> 00:03:33,201
<i>She left the street quietly.

68
00:03:33,853 --> 00:03:37,369
<i>But news of her disappearance
would soon spread.

69
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,165
<i>And the sound would be deafening.

70
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,195
<i>But first...

71
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:53,143
<i>a young man in love

72
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:58,209
<i>had plans to make some noise of his own.

73
00:04:07,136 --> 00:04:10,570
Bree, I love you, and I want this to be

74
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:13,260
the last morning you wake up
without me next to you.

75
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,554
It's 6:00! How long have you been
kneeling there?

76
00:04:17,226 --> 00:04:18,202
I don't know,

77
00:04:18,964 --> 00:04:20,533
but after you answer this question,

78
00:04:20,931 --> 00:04:22,611
you're gonna need to help me up.

79
00:04:23,971 --> 00:04:25,061
Bree...

80
00:04:25,647 --> 00:04:27,204
will you do me the honor...

81
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,507
May I say something first?

82
00:04:31,288 --> 00:04:32,927
After that embarrassing
night in the restaurant,

83
00:04:32,927 --> 00:04:36,860
I really appreciate you taking
another stab at this, but...

84
00:04:39,132 --> 00:04:41,046
That's a long "but." I'm getting up.

85
00:04:41,046 --> 00:04:44,045
Hold on. I'm not saying no...

86
00:04:44,045 --> 00:04:45,099
exactly.

87
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:49,086
It's just so soon to be
talking about marriage.

88
00:04:50,672 --> 00:04:53,440
Maybe I can use this as a tiny napkin ring.

89
00:04:54,365 --> 00:04:55,119
Wait!

90
00:04:59,676 --> 00:05:01,720
I have a proposal for you.

91
00:05:03,574 --> 00:05:05,542
I love you, too,

92
00:05:05,542 --> 00:05:06,946
Keith Watson,

93
00:05:07,854 --> 00:05:11,310
and I also want this to be
the last morning I wake up

94
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,987
without you next to me.

95
00:05:14,874 --> 00:05:16,401
So I'm asking you,

96
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,774
will you do me the honor of...

97
00:05:22,944 --> 00:05:24,606
moving in with me?

98
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:29,782
For the third time, no.

99
00:05:29,782 --> 00:05:31,599
I'm not gonna sell my house to Paul Young.

100
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:34,421
I'm sorry. I just had to make sure.
The vote is today.

101
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:36,712
Do you really think that
I would let dangerous ex-cons

102
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:38,274
move in next to my own mother?

103
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:41,678
I don't know. As a teenager,
you were pretty nasty.

104
00:05:43,512 --> 00:05:46,455
But you're all grown up
now and so very nice.

105
00:05:46,455 --> 00:05:47,997
Thank you for your support.

106
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:51,344
Excuse me.

107
00:05:52,312 --> 00:05:53,364
Lynette Scavo?

108
00:05:54,106 --> 00:05:54,652
Yeah?

109
00:05:54,652 --> 00:05:55,788
Brent Ferguson, president

110
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:58,099
of the hydrangea circle
homeowners association.

111
00:05:58,249 --> 00:05:59,190
Ohh.

112
00:05:59,405 --> 00:06:01,621
We've all heard about your situation.

113
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:03,115
We'd love to help.

114
00:06:03,533 --> 00:06:07,186
- Really?
- Sure. Last year we had
a similar scare on our street.

115
00:06:07,186 --> 00:06:09,610
Some old hippie wanted to
open up a drug rehab center

116
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:12,112
- on our block.
- I remember.

117
00:06:12,112 --> 00:06:14,448
Didn't that old hippie get
beat up by a neighbor?

118
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:17,398
He made the mistake of mouthing off

119
00:06:17,398 --> 00:06:19,526
to one of my neighbors
who's an ex-green beret.

120
00:06:19,526 --> 00:06:21,778
Newspaper made it sound
way worse than it was.

121
00:06:22,836 --> 00:06:24,011
Well, nice to meet you.

122
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:25,394
You say the word,

123
00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:27,776
and I will have the homeowners association

124
00:06:27,776 --> 00:06:30,388
of ten different streets
here to back you folks up.

125
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:33,379
Whoever's trying to open up
this halfway house,

126
00:06:33,379 --> 00:06:35,681
we could really scare the hell out of 'em.

127
00:06:35,681 --> 00:06:37,763
Well, I appreciate your offer,

128
00:06:37,763 --> 00:06:40,336
but I think we'd prefer
to handle our situation

129
00:06:40,336 --> 00:06:41,823
in a more...

130
00:06:42,295 --> 00:06:43,585
civilized manner.

131
00:06:45,161 --> 00:06:46,370
Okay. Well,

132
00:06:46,731 --> 00:06:49,108
you change your mind,
you know where to find me.

133
00:06:49,262 --> 00:06:51,119
"Hydrangea circle," got it.

134
00:06:54,556 --> 00:06:57,361
So we're at dinner, and Renee
is going on and on about this guy

135
00:06:57,361 --> 00:06:59,808
she once had a fling with and
she still has feelings for,

136
00:06:59,808 --> 00:07:04,504
and she gets so drunk that
she tells me it was Tom Scavo.

137
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,989
What am I supposed to do with that?

138
00:07:07,804 --> 00:07:09,796
You look so hot right now.

139
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:14,230
Mike, focus. I know
you've been in Alaska for a month.

140
00:07:14,533 --> 00:07:17,583
A month, 19 days, and 7 hours.

141
00:07:17,853 --> 00:07:19,931
Yesterday I put boobs on a snowman.

142
00:07:20,181 --> 00:07:21,453
I need to come home.

143
00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:23,205
I miss you, too.

144
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,527
So am I making too much out of this?

145
00:07:26,527 --> 00:07:28,489
I mean, it happened 20 years ago,

146
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,181
and Tom's a good guy, right?

147
00:07:30,181 --> 00:07:31,865
Yeah, he is, but...

148
00:07:31,865 --> 00:07:35,011
even good guys make mistakes
if the circumstances are right.

149
00:07:36,003 --> 00:07:38,457
Interesting point. Wish you hadn't made it

150
00:07:38,457 --> 00:07:41,293
while you were 2,000 miles away
and clearly horny.

151
00:07:42,198 --> 00:07:45,440
Susan, I am in the middle of nowhere.

152
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,695
The only female I've seen has antlers.

153
00:07:50,523 --> 00:07:52,003
So should I tell Lynette?

154
00:07:52,003 --> 00:07:53,389
Well, not just yet.

155
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:55,825
Maybe just keep an eye on the situation.

156
00:07:56,332 --> 00:07:57,733
Thanks for the advice.

157
00:07:58,549 --> 00:07:59,980
Just so you know, when you come home,

158
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,677
I'm gonna make you forget all
about that snowman.

159
00:08:04,482 --> 00:08:05,872
Her name is Carol.

160
00:08:07,276 --> 00:08:09,243
Okay, you really need to come home.

161
00:08:18,962 --> 00:08:20,013
Mommy?

162
00:08:21,491 --> 00:08:22,644
Why are you crying?

163
00:08:25,118 --> 00:08:27,111
Oh... just...

164
00:08:27,111 --> 00:08:28,486
having a sad day.

165
00:08:30,103 --> 00:08:33,951
You've been having a lot of sad days.
Is it because Grace left?

166
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:35,566
Why would you say that?

167
00:08:37,515 --> 00:08:40,974
That was when you started being sad...
the day she went away.

168
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:45,478
No, it's just, you know...

169
00:08:46,311 --> 00:08:48,449
I got really close to
that whole family, and...

170
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:51,678
I knew I was gonna miss Carmen and Hector.

171
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,423
And Grace?

172
00:08:57,978 --> 00:08:59,715
Why are you wearing my necklace?

173
00:09:00,502 --> 00:09:02,046
I'm playing dress-up.

174
00:09:02,046 --> 00:09:04,361
Not with real diamonds. Hand it over!

175
00:09:05,405 --> 00:09:07,738
Fine. Here.

176
00:09:09,113 --> 00:09:10,682
Take it. Jeesh.

177
00:09:11,239 --> 00:09:14,152
And I don't want you playing in
my room anymore. You understand?

178
00:09:15,415 --> 00:09:17,954
I liked you better when you were crying.

179
00:09:24,065 --> 00:09:25,135
Mitzi!

180
00:09:25,312 --> 00:09:26,854
It's Lynette Scavo!

181
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:28,750
If you're in there,

182
00:09:29,254 --> 00:09:30,875
please open up!

183
00:09:40,661 --> 00:09:41,761
- Hey, Lee.
- Hey.

184
00:09:41,761 --> 00:09:43,254
You wouldn't happen
to know where Mitzi Kinsky is,

185
00:09:43,254 --> 00:09:45,554
- would you?
- No. Why would I?

186
00:09:45,863 --> 00:09:48,077
I thought maybe you and Paul
convinced her to sell her house

187
00:09:48,077 --> 00:09:50,434
and then stashed her away
someplace for safekeeping.

188
00:09:50,434 --> 00:09:52,201
Lynette, I have to say, I'm offended.

189
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:54,446
I have to say, I couldn't care less.

190
00:09:55,242 --> 00:09:55,812
You know...

191
00:09:56,112 --> 00:09:59,836
For the millionth time,
I had no idea what he was up to!

192
00:09:59,836 --> 00:10:03,205
You were his real estate agent!
You didn't think it odd...

193
00:10:03,205 --> 00:10:05,906
him buying all these houses on one street?

194
00:10:05,906 --> 00:10:08,219
He was paying me commissions.
What-what am I supposed to do?

195
00:10:08,219 --> 00:10:10,374
- Complain?
- Maybe you didn't know,

196
00:10:10,374 --> 00:10:13,086
and if Paul is voted down at
tonight's meeting, I'm sure

197
00:10:13,086 --> 00:10:16,117
in time people will forget
you had anything to do with this...

198
00:10:16,117 --> 00:10:19,645
- I...
- But, Lee, if he finds
a way to open that house,

199
00:10:19,645 --> 00:10:22,538
I don't think anyone on
this street will ever forgive you.

200
00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:36,060
Hello?

201
00:10:36,206 --> 00:10:37,463
Look out your window.

202
00:10:41,581 --> 00:10:43,538
Oh, it's you. I'm hanging up now.

203
00:10:43,939 --> 00:10:46,608
Look, I understand you're annoyed with me.

204
00:10:46,608 --> 00:10:48,899
- I feel awful.
- Well, you should.

205
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:51,389
Because of you, everyone on
this street hates me now.

206
00:10:51,389 --> 00:10:52,950
That's why I'm calling.

207
00:10:53,135 --> 00:10:56,212
I put you in an awful position.
I'd like to make it up to you.

208
00:10:56,212 --> 00:10:57,729
And how are you gonna do that?

209
00:10:58,004 --> 00:11:00,690
Well, first, you should
know that Mitzi Kinsky

210
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:02,748
agreed to sell me her house yesterday.

211
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:03,935
What?

212
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,291
I suggested she leave the lane for a while.

213
00:11:08,092 --> 00:11:09,721
The taxi picked her up this morning.

214
00:11:10,973 --> 00:11:13,285
Oh, my god. So why...
why are you telling me this?

215
00:11:13,643 --> 00:11:15,587
Because I have a little proposition for you.

216
00:11:16,521 --> 00:11:18,767
And given how the neighbors
feel about you these days,

217
00:11:19,242 --> 00:11:20,547
I suggest you listen.

218
00:11:29,748 --> 00:11:33,503
Hey, Mitzi, it's Lynette.
Um, still haven't heard from you.

219
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,269
I need to make sure we're
all on the same page

220
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:36,992
for tonight's meeting. Call me back.

221
00:11:36,992 --> 00:11:38,738
- Ay.
- Hey.

222
00:11:38,953 --> 00:11:42,696
I know you're probably busy.
I really need to talk to somebody.

223
00:11:42,696 --> 00:11:44,841
I would love to, but the meeting's tonight.

224
00:11:44,841 --> 00:11:46,013
I got a bunch of phone calls to make.

225
00:11:46,013 --> 00:11:49,501
- Can't you talk to Susan or Bree?
- No. It's gotta be you.

226
00:11:50,072 --> 00:11:50,800
Why?

227
00:11:51,926 --> 00:11:54,069
You're the only woman
I know who's lost a child.

228
00:11:59,574 --> 00:12:01,844
And ever since Grace left,
I can't stop crying.

229
00:12:02,582 --> 00:12:05,242
I break down at the mall, at the market.

230
00:12:05,242 --> 00:12:06,798
I'm starting to freak myself out.

231
00:12:06,973 --> 00:12:09,417
I was the same way after I lost the baby.

232
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:11,905
I finally went to a therapist.

233
00:12:12,352 --> 00:12:13,831
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah.

234
00:12:14,271 --> 00:12:16,508
- Did it help?
- It did.

235
00:12:18,077 --> 00:12:21,327
In fact, she had me do something
you might want to try.

236
00:12:22,562 --> 00:12:24,208
Write Grace a letter.

237
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,737
A letter?

238
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:27,576
You don't send it.

239
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:30,144
You just pour out your feelings.

240
00:12:30,643 --> 00:12:33,256
Tell Grace how happy
you are to have found her

241
00:12:33,256 --> 00:12:35,029
and how much you love her.

242
00:12:35,975 --> 00:12:39,012
Trust me. After you've written it,
you'll feel so much better.

243
00:12:45,815 --> 00:12:47,987
Gaby! Where are my keys?

244
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,063
Uh, I have them!

245
00:12:50,063 --> 00:12:51,553
Wait. I'll be right down!

246
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,422
You're moving in together?

247
00:13:29,748 --> 00:13:31,659
No one's more surprised than I am.

248
00:13:32,752 --> 00:13:34,394
So you did propose to her?

249
00:13:34,394 --> 00:13:37,264
I tried. Bree said
she's not ready for that yet.

250
00:13:37,264 --> 00:13:38,625
This was the compromise.

251
00:13:39,022 --> 00:13:40,872
I figure we'll do this for a while,
then in a couple months

252
00:13:40,872 --> 00:13:42,552
we'll start talking about a wedding.

253
00:13:44,119 --> 00:13:46,422
Yeah, I-I guess that could happen.

254
00:13:47,344 --> 00:13:48,442
You "guess"?

255
00:13:49,425 --> 00:13:50,505
It's just...

256
00:13:52,295 --> 00:13:56,099
if Bree was in love with you,
seems she'd want to...

257
00:13:56,278 --> 00:13:57,611
lock it down. That's all.

258
00:13:57,611 --> 00:13:59,387
Dad, I get where she's coming from.

259
00:13:59,387 --> 00:14:00,929
She just divorced a guy.

260
00:14:01,622 --> 00:14:02,925
That's my point.

261
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,752
She's ready for some fun,
not something serious.

262
00:14:06,155 --> 00:14:08,812
She may be looking at you as a diversion.

263
00:14:08,812 --> 00:14:12,139
No, Bree loves me. This is going somewhere.

264
00:14:12,754 --> 00:14:14,029
Just make sure.

265
00:14:15,153 --> 00:14:17,055
If Bree's not willing to make
some sort of a commitment,

266
00:14:17,055 --> 00:14:19,916
- then maybe...
- Dad, you're starting to piss me off.

267
00:14:20,155 --> 00:14:21,759
I hope I'm wrong. I really do.

268
00:14:23,058 --> 00:14:24,323
And if I am...

269
00:14:25,275 --> 00:14:27,486
You let me know when to rent
the tux for the wedding.

270
00:14:40,444 --> 00:14:41,500
Okay.

271
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:44,907
- Any sign of Mitzi?
- Oh, not yet.

272
00:14:44,907 --> 00:14:46,263
God, where could she be?

273
00:14:46,263 --> 00:14:48,843
If she sold her house to Paul,
she better be on the run.

274
00:14:48,843 --> 00:14:49,664
Not that it'll do any good.

275
00:14:49,664 --> 00:14:51,957
- I'll still hunt her down and kill her.
- Uh-huh.

276
00:14:54,189 --> 00:14:56,500
Lynette? We've been here for 20 minutes.

277
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,230
- Don't you think it's time you started?
- Relax,

278
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,368
Paul. We're not taking
the vote until everyone's here.

279
00:15:01,908 --> 00:15:04,269
Well, while we're waiting,
may I make an announcement?

280
00:15:05,884 --> 00:15:06,972
I suppose.

281
00:15:08,432 --> 00:15:10,244
May I have your attention, please?

282
00:15:14,107 --> 00:15:15,232
I wanted you all to know

283
00:15:15,232 --> 00:15:17,952
That the mayor of Fairview
will be here friday

284
00:15:18,222 --> 00:15:21,512
to present me with an award
for outstanding public service.

285
00:15:21,512 --> 00:15:22,561
- What?
- What?

286
00:15:23,371 --> 00:15:25,452
Yes, it's-it's-it's sort of a big deal,

287
00:15:25,652 --> 00:15:29,263
and I would love it
if all of my friends would attend.

288
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:31,778
If you'd invite your enemies,
you'd get a bigger crowd.

289
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:36,089
Ah, I love your sense of humor,
Mrs. McCluskey.

290
00:15:36,089 --> 00:15:38,513
- How we'll all miss it after you're gone.
- Hmm.

291
00:15:39,444 --> 00:15:43,026
Hold it. Now, what kind of
public service did you do?

292
00:15:43,467 --> 00:15:44,842
The halfway house, of course.

293
00:15:45,298 --> 00:15:47,684
Oh, shoot. Did-did I bury the lead?

294
00:15:48,137 --> 00:15:51,101
I now have all the votes I need to open it.

295
00:15:54,082 --> 00:15:55,180
How do you have the votes?

296
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:58,318
Someone sold you their house?

297
00:15:59,241 --> 00:16:00,318
Oh, yes.

298
00:16:02,144 --> 00:16:03,544
We shouldn't have sold.

299
00:16:03,544 --> 00:16:04,388
We should have just gone under

300
00:16:04,388 --> 00:16:05,948
with the rest of the neighborhood.

301
00:16:06,939 --> 00:16:09,715
Which would have been
very noble and very stupid.

302
00:16:09,988 --> 00:16:11,135
Mitzi sold. She's not gonna be around

303
00:16:11,135 --> 00:16:13,014
for everybody on this street to pummel,

304
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:15,791
which means they would have taken
their anger out on you.

305
00:16:15,964 --> 00:16:17,185
Didn't have a choice.

306
00:16:20,675 --> 00:16:21,717
What the hell?

307
00:16:24,514 --> 00:16:26,712
Mitzi, what are you doing here?

308
00:16:26,712 --> 00:16:29,271
I live here.
Oh, I guess you would have noticed,

309
00:16:29,271 --> 00:16:31,282
if I was a hot guy with abs.

310
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,715
But we thought you left.

311
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:36,401
Weirdest thing. Get this call?

312
00:16:36,571 --> 00:16:38,934
This guy says he has
a job for me in the city.

313
00:16:38,934 --> 00:16:41,712
Puts me up in a nice hotel,
and then he never showed.

314
00:16:42,077 --> 00:16:44,126
Huh, and I got stuck
with the minibar charges.

315
00:16:44,931 --> 00:16:47,759
So, wait. You didn't sell
your house to Paul Young?

316
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:48,534
What?

317
00:16:49,692 --> 00:16:53,021
Please. I'm not gonna
screw over my neighbors.

318
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:00,291
Lee?

319
00:17:01,912 --> 00:17:04,025
What the hell have you done to us?

320
00:17:10,354 --> 00:17:12,427
No, I'm sorry. Lynette is not here.

321
00:17:12,427 --> 00:17:15,463
She's trying to deal with
this whole Paul Young mess.

322
00:17:16,151 --> 00:17:18,352
Yes, I will have her get back to you.

323
00:17:18,845 --> 00:17:19,826
Ok-okay.

324
00:17:22,032 --> 00:17:24,370
What is happening to this neighborhood?

325
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:25,678
Some van just pulled up,

326
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:28,374
and these creepy characters are getting out.

327
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:31,890
That is a school bus, Renee.
Those are children.

328
00:17:32,744 --> 00:17:34,551
Well, I don't like the way
they're looking at me.

329
00:17:35,093 --> 00:17:37,877
Can you come over and install
a dead bolt on my door?

330
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,921
Sure. I will be right over,

331
00:17:39,921 --> 00:17:41,774
as soon as I find
where Lynette keeps the toolbox.

332
00:17:42,051 --> 00:17:44,391
Great. I have to jump in the shower.

333
00:17:44,391 --> 00:17:46,190
I will leave the key under the mat.

334
00:17:52,617 --> 00:17:55,808
You know, I had to use
that key the other night.

335
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:56,507
Yeah?

336
00:17:56,507 --> 00:18:01,192
Yeah. We went out, and Renee got hammered,

337
00:18:01,192 --> 00:18:04,281
so I had to take her in and put her to bed.

338
00:18:04,281 --> 00:18:06,247
Well, that was nice of you.

339
00:18:06,247 --> 00:18:07,166
Yeah...

340
00:18:07,827 --> 00:18:09,952
and she told me this fascinating story

341
00:18:09,952 --> 00:18:13,522
about this guy that she had
a fling with 20 years ago.

342
00:18:15,046 --> 00:18:17,186
W-w-why-why-why was that fascinating?

343
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:22,055
Well, apparently the one weekend
they spent together

344
00:18:22,055 --> 00:18:23,930
made quite an impact on her.

345
00:18:25,244 --> 00:18:27,135
W... did she say any... thing...

346
00:18:29,057 --> 00:18:30,626
else a-about that guy?

347
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,807
No, not really.

348
00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:34,644
Hmm.

349
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:38,047
Only that his name was Tom Scavo.

350
00:18:42,568 --> 00:18:43,660
Okay, look...

351
00:18:43,941 --> 00:18:47,606
this happened before
Lynette and I were married.

352
00:18:47,606 --> 00:18:49,142
It meant nothing.

353
00:18:49,787 --> 00:18:51,795
Well, it meant something to Renee.

354
00:18:52,336 --> 00:18:54,217
She's still in love with you.

355
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:57,331
- She said that?
- She slurred it.

356
00:18:59,841 --> 00:19:01,759
Look, this is not something
I wanted to know,

357
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:04,031
but now that I do,
I am in a horrible position.

358
00:19:04,031 --> 00:19:06,420
No, no, no, no, no. You can't tell Lynette!

359
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,931
Sh-she would freak out!

360
00:19:07,931 --> 00:19:09,912
I don't want to tell her,
but she's my best friend,

361
00:19:09,912 --> 00:19:12,777
and I'm freaking out knowing
that you're at Renee's

362
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:14,648
fixing her dead bolt while
she's in the shower.

363
00:19:14,648 --> 00:19:17,391
Look, this was forever ago,

364
00:19:17,391 --> 00:19:19,320
and I don't feel anything for her.

365
00:19:19,524 --> 00:19:22,230
A beautiful woman who still wants you

366
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,280
is living 100 yards away,

367
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,467
and her breasts are 95 yards away.

368
00:19:26,467 --> 00:19:28,429
Why do you want that temptation?

369
00:19:28,429 --> 00:19:30,726
Hey, I didn't ask her to move here.

370
00:19:30,726 --> 00:19:31,506
Well...

371
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:36,066
maybe it's time you ask her to leave.

372
00:19:43,195 --> 00:19:45,662
So the whole right side
of the closet is yours,

373
00:19:45,662 --> 00:19:48,479
and I emptied out
the top drawers of the bureau

374
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:53,142
for your socks and those cute
little boxer briefs you wear.

375
00:19:53,388 --> 00:19:54,154
Thank you.

376
00:19:54,946 --> 00:19:56,306
And after we've gotten you settled,

377
00:19:56,306 --> 00:19:58,132
I want us to go over and tell the girls.

378
00:19:58,132 --> 00:20:02,579
They're going to die.
Bree Van de Kamp living in sin.

379
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:04,251
Come here.

380
00:20:06,357 --> 00:20:07,161
What is it?

381
00:20:07,588 --> 00:20:09,910
- We love each other, right?
- Mm-hmm.

382
00:20:11,186 --> 00:20:12,754
Why don't you just go ahead and wear this?

383
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,593
- Keith.
- No, if-if... if marriage is
where we're headed,

384
00:20:17,593 --> 00:20:19,678
I just keep thinking, what's the harm?

385
00:20:20,483 --> 00:20:22,479
Because we're not there yet.

386
00:20:26,146 --> 00:20:27,988
Look, I'm not trying to rush you,

387
00:20:27,988 --> 00:20:29,260
but I need a bigger commitment

388
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:33,663
than just the top couple
drawers in your bureau.

389
00:20:34,895 --> 00:20:36,299
We talked about this.

390
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:39,633
I'm not ready to make that kind of promise.

391
00:20:44,715 --> 00:20:45,885
That's a problem.

392
00:20:48,352 --> 00:20:49,609
Because I don't wanna wake up one day

393
00:20:49,609 --> 00:20:51,716
and find out that I was just some diversion

394
00:20:52,078 --> 00:20:54,818
that, uh, you needed to amuse yourself

395
00:20:54,818 --> 00:20:56,399
while getting through your divorce.

396
00:20:57,594 --> 00:20:59,413
If you really think I feel that way,

397
00:20:59,413 --> 00:21:00,964
then why are you even here?

398
00:21:02,047 --> 00:21:05,936
I'm-I'm starting to wonder that myself.

399
00:21:10,396 --> 00:21:12,901
Do you think us living
together is a mistake?

400
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:18,334
No. No, I think us is a mistake.

401
00:21:26,141 --> 00:21:28,124
I wish we had been nicer to Paul.

402
00:21:28,124 --> 00:21:30,955
I wish we had stood by him
when he was on trial.

403
00:21:30,955 --> 00:21:33,146
I think about what
he must have gone through in prison,

404
00:21:33,146 --> 00:21:36,973
and I understand his rage. I do.

405
00:21:38,373 --> 00:21:41,312
But I won't allow him
to destroy this street.

406
00:21:41,652 --> 00:21:43,498
It's not right.

407
00:21:45,261 --> 00:21:46,599
Don't worry.

408
00:21:46,943 --> 00:21:49,070
We will stop this son of a bitch.

409
00:21:51,993 --> 00:21:53,032
That's a promise.

410
00:22:03,116 --> 00:22:05,537
Hey. M.J.'s spending
the night at a friend's house,

411
00:22:05,537 --> 00:22:07,133
so I don't care
if this protest goes all night.

412
00:22:07,133 --> 00:22:08,513
I'm here to the bitter end.

413
00:22:08,641 --> 00:22:11,261
- How can I help?
- We need more signs painted.

414
00:22:11,261 --> 00:22:12,479
- Okay.
- Hey, Susan.

415
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,269
Look on that paper. We came up
with a whole list of slogans.

416
00:22:17,396 --> 00:22:20,171
Just so you know, we got plenty of
"think about the children,"

417
00:22:20,171 --> 00:22:23,121
and we need a lot more
"who let the cons out?"

418
00:22:24,962 --> 00:22:28,775
so, what exactly are we hoping
to accomplish with all this?

419
00:22:28,775 --> 00:22:31,039
The mayor is in a close
race for re-election.

420
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,684
He needs every vote he can get.
If we can make

421
00:22:33,684 --> 00:22:35,477
a big enough stink
in front of the news cameras,

422
00:22:35,477 --> 00:22:38,318
maybe we can embarrass him
into shutting that place down.

423
00:22:40,352 --> 00:22:44,485
So if this protest works,
and the place doesn't open,

424
00:22:44,485 --> 00:22:46,417
what happens to all those ex-cons?

425
00:22:47,826 --> 00:22:49,013
What happens to them?

426
00:22:49,163 --> 00:22:52,027
I mean, I... if they don't get
to stay here, where will they go?

427
00:22:52,781 --> 00:22:54,436
They'll just go back to
where they came from,

428
00:22:54,436 --> 00:22:56,436
or some house in another neighborhood.

429
00:22:56,436 --> 00:22:59,721
- But what if that neighborhood
doesn't want them either?
- Well...

430
00:22:59,721 --> 00:23:00,914
I mean, if they've done their time,

431
00:23:00,914 --> 00:23:02,885
and they need a second chance,
wouldn't it be better for them

432
00:23:02,885 --> 00:23:04,160
to be in a nice neighborhood?

433
00:23:05,901 --> 00:23:08,744
In theory, yes, but that's
not the way the world works.

434
00:23:08,744 --> 00:23:12,317
We have to think about
our neighborhood, our children.

435
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:13,824
Ourselves?

436
00:23:14,913 --> 00:23:18,445
Don't be cute. Some of these men
may have good intentions,

437
00:23:18,445 --> 00:23:21,404
but some of them could
still be really bad guys.

438
00:23:22,204 --> 00:23:23,774
But if we don't even try to help them,

439
00:23:23,774 --> 00:23:25,415
are we so sure we're the good guys?

440
00:23:44,518 --> 00:23:45,525
Richard.

441
00:23:45,994 --> 00:23:48,349
Keith told me what happened. I'm so sorry.

442
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:50,255
Thank you.

443
00:23:52,513 --> 00:23:54,473
So, uh, why are you here?

444
00:23:56,717 --> 00:23:58,167
He also mentioned all
that work that needs to be done

445
00:23:58,167 --> 00:24:01,935
in your backyard. Luckily,
I taught him everything he knows.

446
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:05,386
Uh, wait. Uh, you don't need to do that.

447
00:24:05,386 --> 00:24:09,237
It's not a problem. I'll have
it done by the end of the week.

448
00:24:09,237 --> 00:24:10,453
But if you wanna thank me,

449
00:24:11,914 --> 00:24:13,662
think you could find me
something cold to drink?

450
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:26,145
Mayor Franklin. What an honor. Paul Young.

451
00:24:26,145 --> 00:24:27,011
You must be the good samaritan

452
00:24:27,011 --> 00:24:29,576
- I've heard so much about.
- This is my wife Beth.

453
00:24:29,576 --> 00:24:33,495
- I've never met a celebrity before.
- Well, now you have.

454
00:24:33,495 --> 00:24:35,153
The media will be arriving shortly,

455
00:24:35,153 --> 00:24:36,863
as well as some of the mayor's supporters.

456
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:38,330
Uh, with the election just a few days away,

457
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:41,344
- we thought this could be
a terrific photo op.
- No problem.

458
00:24:41,344 --> 00:24:43,281
While you're waiting,
would you like a tour of the facility?

459
00:24:43,595 --> 00:24:46,023
Absolutely. I must say,
I don't know how you got your neighbors

460
00:24:46,023 --> 00:24:47,776
to agree to a halfway house on their street,

461
00:24:47,776 --> 00:24:49,509
but they must think a lot of you.

462
00:24:49,781 --> 00:24:53,345
Honestly, this is all happening
because of what I think of them.

463
00:24:59,429 --> 00:25:01,435
Richard? Is that you?

464
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:04,609
The lemonade's not quite ready yet.

465
00:25:07,571 --> 00:25:10,223
Richard, would you like
a sandwich with that...

466
00:25:15,685 --> 00:25:16,829
Who are you?

467
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,918
This the halfway house?

468
00:25:21,316 --> 00:25:24,099
Uh, no. That's next door.

469
00:25:24,103 --> 00:25:25,218
Ah.

470
00:25:26,707 --> 00:25:28,936
So I guess we're gonna be neighbors.

471
00:25:31,681 --> 00:25:32,934
Well, I'm sure you're in a hurry

472
00:25:32,935 --> 00:25:35,946
to get settled in over there, so...

473
00:25:39,547 --> 00:25:41,220
I'm in no hurry.

474
00:25:48,158 --> 00:25:49,762
What's going on in here?

475
00:25:49,773 --> 00:25:54,269
Uh, this, um, gentleman just,
uh, wandered into my home.

476
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:02,373
I made a mistake.

477
00:26:04,687 --> 00:26:06,330
Won't happen again.

478
00:26:06,643 --> 00:26:08,046
It better not.

479
00:26:16,651 --> 00:26:17,791
You okay?

480
00:26:17,792 --> 00:26:21,021
Yeah, I'm fine, I was just,
uh, taken by surprise.

481
00:26:22,752 --> 00:26:24,349
You're shaking. Come on. Come on. Come on.

482
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:26,492
No, really... really, I'm fine, just, um...

483
00:26:26,894 --> 00:26:28,745
Thank you for taking care of that.

484
00:26:34,543 --> 00:26:35,790
What are you doing?

485
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:39,590
Something I've wanted to do for a long time.

486
00:26:45,878 --> 00:26:47,487
You're gonna have to leave.

487
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:53,125
Okay. Maybe I misread some signals.

488
00:26:53,126 --> 00:26:56,416
There have been no signals.
I was dating your son.

489
00:26:58,106 --> 00:26:59,856
Okay. If that's the way you feel,

490
00:26:59,857 --> 00:27:02,098
then I'll finish up out back and go.

491
00:27:02,099 --> 00:27:03,578
I want you to leave now.

492
00:27:03,579 --> 00:27:06,410
Look, I made an error in judgment.
I'm-I'm sorry.

493
00:27:06,553 --> 00:27:09,997
- Please let me finish the work.
- I said now.

494
00:27:10,956 --> 00:27:14,017
I will leave when I'm finished.

495
00:27:21,867 --> 00:27:24,025
Okay. Yeah, yeah, here we are.

496
00:27:30,922 --> 00:27:32,317
Well, here's trouble.

497
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:34,758
Bunch of geeks with "vote Franklin" signs

498
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:36,208
just showed up.

499
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,444
Looks like we're outnumbered now.

500
00:27:42,891 --> 00:27:45,587
Oh, I'm not worried.

501
00:27:50,778 --> 00:27:52,116
Who the hell are they?

502
00:27:52,236 --> 00:27:53,606
The cavalry.

503
00:28:05,553 --> 00:28:07,295
Hey, guys. Guys!

504
00:28:07,885 --> 00:28:09,677
- I'm not too late, am I?
- Nope.

505
00:28:10,123 --> 00:28:11,551
You're just in time.

506
00:28:15,622 --> 00:28:16,735
Oh, yeah.

507
00:28:25,049 --> 00:28:27,362
Okay! Here's the plan.

508
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,699
Once the mayor begins his speech,

509
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,756
I'll give the signal.

510
00:28:31,757 --> 00:28:34,637
That's when we all begin chanting,
okay? You got it?

511
00:28:34,638 --> 00:28:36,229
All right! Let's go!

512
00:28:50,728 --> 00:28:52,727
We need to talk now.

513
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,455
Quite a turnout.

514
00:28:58,993 --> 00:29:00,604
Look at those news cameras.

515
00:29:01,097 --> 00:29:04,616
Uh, do I need a little base?
Hi-def is killing me.

516
00:29:07,911 --> 00:29:08,906
Hey, Franklin!

517
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:19,895
Where did all these people come from?

518
00:29:20,229 --> 00:29:21,468
I don't know.

519
00:29:21,515 --> 00:29:24,795
But it looks like things are
about to get very interesting.

520
00:29:31,638 --> 00:29:33,941
No, no, no! How did she find out?

521
00:29:33,942 --> 00:29:36,063
You told her the other night!

522
00:29:37,368 --> 00:29:39,582
Oh, while we were drinking.

523
00:29:39,583 --> 00:29:42,152
You were drinking. She was listening!

524
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,948
- Oh, my god.
- Yeah, this is bad.

525
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:46,649
What else did you say to her?

526
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:49,296
I mean, she thinks that
you still have feelings for me.

527
00:29:50,786 --> 00:29:53,984
Oh, well, that's just... ridiculous.

528
00:29:55,083 --> 00:29:57,441
She's not gonna say
anything to Lynette, is she?

529
00:29:58,015 --> 00:29:59,130
No.

530
00:29:59,512 --> 00:30:01,563
Does she want you to tell Lynette?

531
00:30:01,923 --> 00:30:03,997
No, she had a different suggestion.

532
00:30:05,934 --> 00:30:07,475
And I think it's a good one.

533
00:30:10,026 --> 00:30:11,734
I'm going outside to watch the protest.

534
00:30:11,735 --> 00:30:13,788
Stay in your room and
look after your sister.

535
00:30:14,196 --> 00:30:16,902
Oh! Don't get into those cookies I made.

536
00:30:16,903 --> 00:30:20,146
Those are for after supper,
and yes, I counted them.

537
00:30:22,552 --> 00:30:24,161
Juanita, what's wrong?

538
00:30:25,419 --> 00:30:26,726
What is that?

539
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:31,557
The letter you wrote to Grace.

540
00:30:34,386 --> 00:30:35,660
Okay.

541
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:37,614
Okay.

542
00:30:41,515 --> 00:30:44,590
Honey, you really shouldn't
have read this...

543
00:30:46,589 --> 00:30:48,406
'cause it doesn't mean anything.

544
00:30:48,944 --> 00:30:51,012
Grace is your daughter, isn't she?

545
00:30:51,483 --> 00:30:53,874
That's why you've been crying
since she left.

546
00:30:54,282 --> 00:30:56,037
You love her more than me.

547
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:58,469
No. No, no, no!

548
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:00,127
That is not true.

549
00:31:00,589 --> 00:31:03,876
You are the most important thing
in this world to me.

550
00:31:05,685 --> 00:31:07,703
You believe mommy, don't you?

551
00:31:08,174 --> 00:31:09,456
Oh...

552
00:31:11,414 --> 00:31:13,038
You're not my mommy.

553
00:31:14,544 --> 00:31:15,892
Juanita!

554
00:31:15,928 --> 00:31:17,368
Come back here!

555
00:31:17,862 --> 00:31:19,052
Juanita!

556
00:31:19,681 --> 00:31:20,916
Juanita!

557
00:31:28,084 --> 00:31:29,479
Juanita!

558
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,578
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you

559
00:31:32,579 --> 00:31:35,576
mayor Harold Franklin!

560
00:31:42,884 --> 00:31:44,542
Save our street!

561
00:31:44,543 --> 00:31:47,596
Save our street! Save our street!

562
00:31:47,619 --> 00:31:50,878
Save our street! Save our street!

563
00:31:50,899 --> 00:31:54,078
Save our street! Save our street!

564
00:31:54,195 --> 00:31:55,837
Save our street!

565
00:31:56,156 --> 00:31:57,908
Good afternoon, everybody.

566
00:31:57,991 --> 00:32:00,317
It's a pleasure and an honor to be here...

567
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:02,678
I thought you said
the neighborhood was behind this.

568
00:32:03,047 --> 00:32:06,496
Did I? I appear to have been wrong.

569
00:32:06,497 --> 00:32:08,720
With a troubled past that's
is in their neighborhood.

570
00:32:08,721 --> 00:32:11,392
Save our street! Save our street!

571
00:32:11,393 --> 00:32:14,413
The Fairview street is an inventory
of compassionate, understanding people!

572
00:32:15,013 --> 00:32:17,975
If I ever get my hands on Paul Young,
I will kill him.

573
00:32:18,273 --> 00:32:19,936
Can we talk about this in the hotel?

574
00:32:19,937 --> 00:32:21,862
There's a lot of angry people out there.

575
00:32:21,863 --> 00:32:22,842
I know.

576
00:32:23,405 --> 00:32:28,036
Save our street! Save our street!
Save our street!

577
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,407
Your actions are a blueprint

578
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:33,978
for others to emulate.

579
00:32:34,047 --> 00:32:36,968
And that certainly describes
the people who live here...

580
00:32:36,969 --> 00:32:39,959
- on Wisteria Lane.
- Hey! I talked to Tom.

581
00:32:40,455 --> 00:32:42,495
This is not the right time to discuss this.

582
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:45,102
- Save our street!
- Hey, we are discussing it.

583
00:32:45,267 --> 00:32:47,619
Tom told me about your little,
uh, suggestion

584
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,455
that I need to move off the lane.

585
00:32:50,015 --> 00:32:52,078
And I want you to know,
that ain't gonna happen.

586
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:53,863
You know, if you were
really Lynette's friend,

587
00:32:53,864 --> 00:32:55,952
you would know that
you cannot live two doors down

588
00:32:55,953 --> 00:32:58,701
from her husband... a man you still love.

589
00:32:58,792 --> 00:33:01,011
- That is none of your damn business.
- Really?

590
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:03,439
'Cause I am Lynette's friend,
and I'm not gonna stand by

591
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,580
and watch you screw up her marriage.

592
00:33:06,637 --> 00:33:09,536
- So help me, Susan...
- Hey, get your hands off me.

593
00:33:09,845 --> 00:33:12,612
Save our street! Save our street!

594
00:33:12,617 --> 00:33:15,443
Save our street! Save our street!

595
00:33:15,444 --> 00:33:19,787
Save our street! Save our street!
Save our street!

596
00:33:21,727 --> 00:33:24,228
I'm parked three blocks away.
It's crazy out here.

597
00:33:24,755 --> 00:33:26,236
Did you finish up everything?

598
00:33:26,426 --> 00:33:29,576
Oh, yeah. I'm done.

599
00:33:29,583 --> 00:33:31,752
Blueprint for others to emulate.

600
00:33:31,753 --> 00:33:33,814
Because the only way we're gonna have...

601
00:33:36,266 --> 00:33:38,513
Hey. I got your message.

602
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:40,686
What's wrong?

603
00:33:40,796 --> 00:33:41,658
I think you should know

604
00:33:41,659 --> 00:33:44,115
there's been an incident with your father.

605
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,798
Save our street! Save our street!

606
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:52,392
In particular, there is one man,
Paul Young...

607
00:33:57,956 --> 00:34:01,230
Th-though he was unfairly incarcerated,

608
00:34:01,231 --> 00:34:02,680
he has chosen...

609
00:34:03,977 --> 00:34:06,694
Carlos! I can't find Juanita.

610
00:34:07,234 --> 00:34:08,936
You let her outside with all this going on?

611
00:34:08,937 --> 00:34:12,565
- No, she ran away!
She found out about Grace!
- How?

612
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:17,055
Look, I'll tell you later.
Just help me find her!

613
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,628
Juanita!

614
00:34:20,366 --> 00:34:21,863
Juanita, where are you?

615
00:34:22,806 --> 00:34:24,129
Juanita!

616
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:25,401
Juanita!

617
00:34:25,402 --> 00:34:27,747
- Can't I go back and get it?
- It's not that important, Lee.

618
00:34:27,748 --> 00:34:30,759
She signed that program after
her concert at Carnegie Hall.

619
00:34:30,895 --> 00:34:33,436
She was a drug addict. Let it go.

620
00:34:44,226 --> 00:34:45,724
Can you move, please?!

621
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:50,537
Come on!

622
00:34:50,538 --> 00:34:51,951
You son of a bitch.

623
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:53,152
Come here.

624
00:34:55,845 --> 00:34:56,496
Hey.

625
00:34:56,497 --> 00:34:58,591
- What's wrong with you?
- Look, I made a mistake, okay?

626
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,347
Hey, don't push me. Oh!

627
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,600
Hey, one of those cons is beating up a guy.

628
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,370
Get him!

629
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,220
- Keith! What are you doing?
- Come on!

630
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:12,290
Get him!

631
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,310
- Oh!
- Save our street!

632
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:17,630
Through his generosity.

633
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:20,980
He has chosen not to be angry or bitter...

634
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,460
Get off of him!

635
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:35,450
And I'm honored to present this medallion

636
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,240
to a man...

637
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:45,300
And in conclusion, love thy neighbor!

638
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:46,520
Susan!

639
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:49,790
Listen to me!
If you don't care about my life,

640
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,531
think about what you're doing to Lynette!

641
00:35:51,532 --> 00:35:52,660
I am thinking about Lynette!

642
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,360
This would destroy her!

643
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,220
Get off of him!

644
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,500
Juanita!

645
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:36,270
You're pushing!

646
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:39,110
Susan.

647
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:42,880
Stop pushing!

648
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,500
Susan!

649
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:47,360
Susan!

650
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,350
Go around them! Go around!

651
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:09,210
I can't! There's people everywhere!

652
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,110
Maybe we should go back in the house.

653
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,650
Please don't leave me.

654
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,280
Hey! Frank, wait! Wait!
What the hell are you doing?!

655
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:36,470
- I'm gonna make sure
this halfway house never opens.
- Oh, my god!

656
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:37,650
This is what you want, isn't it?

657
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,900
No, no! Not like this!
Give me the bat! Please!

658
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,780
You know what? Go hang out
with the rest of the kiddies.

659
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:44,340
Frank! Frank, wait!

660
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,990
- Lynette! Lynette!
- Oh!

661
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,950
- Help me, please.
- Oh! Mrs. McCluskey! Oh,
my god! I've got you!

662
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:53,000
I got you.

663
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,860
Just drive. They'll move.

664
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:06,880
Hey! It's them! The ones that sold!

665
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:09,260
Oh, crap!

666
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:22,370
Renee! Renee, get off of there!

667
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,950
I'm looking for Susan!

668
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:25,590
It's not safe! Get down!

669
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:27,820
I saw her fall! I think she's hurt!

670
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,980
Get out of the car! Now!

671
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:39,140
It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.

672
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:43,410
It's gonna be okay.

673
00:38:58,590 --> 00:38:59,310
Help. Help!

674
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,520
Juanita!

675
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:06,030
Mommy!

676
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,390
Get off! Get off!

677
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:12,250
Give her to me! Give her to me!

678
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,000
- Mommy!
- Come here. Come here.

679
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:27,140
Paul! Paul!

680
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:29,870
Go inside, darling.

681
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,360
This is all on you! I hope you know that!

682
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,560
Me? Those are your friends
out there, Lynette...

683
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:37,870
the solid citizens of Fairview.

684
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,600
Tell me again

685
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:42,260
Why you think they're better
than a bunch of ex-cons?

686
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,800
Stop!

687
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:16,620
Stop it! Leave him alone!
Leave him alone! Stop!

688
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,790
He's my neighbor!

689
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:23,750
Stop it!

690
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,940
Take him over! Get him over here!

691
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:26,000
Come on!

692
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,360
Somebody help!

693
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,170
Thank you.

694
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:27,130
<i>It was just before sunrise

695
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:28,550
<i>on Wisteria Lane.

696
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:34,090
<i>You could no longer hear

697
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:37,460
<i>the screams of frightened bystanders...

698
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:41,280
<i>or the angry chanting of protestors...

699
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:45,530
<i>or the cries for help from the injured.

700
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:49,760
<i>There were just the footsteps of a man

701
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:54,150
<i>who had finally punished
