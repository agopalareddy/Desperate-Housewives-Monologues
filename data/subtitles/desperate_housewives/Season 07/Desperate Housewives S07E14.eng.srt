1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,010
Previously on Desperate Housewives,

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:04,930
You're marrying him for his money?

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:08,110
Lynette had reservations about her mother's marriage.

4
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:10,510
You can't marry an obnoxious jerk like that.

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,420
Susan began her wait for a kidney donor.

6
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,460
- I'm going on the wait list.  - That could take years.

7
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,000
Bree found out that Keith had a son

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,140
but decided not to tell him...

9
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,890
Keith feels that it would be too difficult for everyone.

10
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,180
Easing her guilt with a check.

11
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:26,950
- Get out of the car!  - Oh, god!

12
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:28,790
Gaby's obsession with her doll...

13
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,820
- I gotta get my baby!  - Get out!

14
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:31,820
Nearly cost her life.

15
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:32,680
My baby!

16
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,520
Gaby! It's not Grace!

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,592
And Paul recognized the gun that was used to shoot him.

18
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,920
Paul Young had a son.

19
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,310
But he had not seen Zach in years.

20
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:58,940
He had lost him to a world of fast women...

21
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,630
Easy money...

22
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:05,500
And hard drugs.

23
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,520
Yes, Paul had lost his son...

24
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:15,270
But he was determined to find him.

25
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,590
And he would do anything...

26
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:22,480
Even if that meant asking for help...

27
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,140
from a man who despised him.

28
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:31,580
What the hell are you doing here?

29
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,160
I need a favor.

30
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,020
- From me?  - I know. You hate me, and I hate you.

31
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,840
Now that we're done with our traditional greeting,

32
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,250
can I tell you what I want?

33
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:41,620
Yeah, go ahead.

34
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,820
I need to find Zach.

35
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,610
I went to that mansion his grandfather left him.

36
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,120
- It's in foreclosure.  - Yeah, I heard about that.

37
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,560
Do you know where he went?

38
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,110
Yeah, I don't know where he is.

39
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,890
And even if I did, why would I do you any favors?

40
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,940
Zach's the one who shot me.

41
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:07,410
What?

42
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,840
The police showed me the gun.

43
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,850
It was the same one Mary Alice used to kill herself.

44
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,530
And Zach kept it?

45
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,430
He's always been a strange boy.

46
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,610
If you really think he tried to kill you,

47
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:23,760
why didn't you tell the police?

48
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,130
I'd like to keep this in the family.

49
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,550
So again, where is he?

50
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,390
Last I heard, Idaho.

51
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:37,900
Well...

52
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:39,890
If you hear from him,

53
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,840
tell him I know what he did...

54
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,280
and I'm very disappointed.

55
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,060
Though he didn't admit it,

56
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:55,330
Mike knew exactly where Zach was.

57
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,640
But the son Paul Young had lost...

58
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,990
had no interest in being found.

59
00:03:12,991 --> 00:03:15,991
www.Mujeres-Desesperadas.com

60
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,740
It doesn't matter where we're going.

61
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:34,010
It doesn't matter how quickly we try to get there.

62
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:39,150
It doesn't matter that we never look back.

63
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:44,680
The past we left behind will still find a way

64
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,100
to catch up to us.

65
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,570
I'm making grilled salmon. Why did you get a pizza?

66
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,320
Because you're making grilled salmon.

67
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,750
I wish you wouldn't put that terrible food in your body.

68
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,760
- It's not good for you.  - Come on.

69
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,110
You know you want a bite.

70
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:07,260
Ah. Eat it. Eat it.

71
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,300
Seriously, I have better-tasting food under my refrigerator.

72
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:14,990
Hello?

73
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,740
Hi, Bree. It's Amber.

74
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:19,850
- I'm sorry to bother you.  - Oh, no, no bother.

75
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:22,130
Look, I'm outside. I need to talk to you.

76
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:25,650
No, uh, don't come over. I'll, um, come to you.

77
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:26,860
See you soon.

78
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,050
I need to run to Lynette's for a minute.

79
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,020
Do you mind waiting for dinner?

80
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,740
Hurry up. I'm starved.

81
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,610
Hi.

82
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,230
So the bank says your check is gonna take 5 days to clear.

83
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,140
Is there any way you can get me a cashier's check?

84
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,570
- I really need to pay some bills.  - Absolutely.

85
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:53,690
Um, there's a restaurant across from the bank.

86
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,400
I can meet you there tomorrow at 2:00.

87
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,990
That'll be great. Thank you again, Bree.

88
00:04:58,770 --> 00:04:59,670
Bree, wait.

89
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,230
I know Keith doesn't wanna meet Charlie.

90
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,440
But he should at least know what his son looks like.

91
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,460
I'm sure he'll appreciate that.

92
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,560
So according to the donor database,

93
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,860
I will be waiting three to four years.

94
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,650
Where does that put me on the list?

95
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,750
-  I-I mean, is there a number?  - There is no number.

96
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,260
It all boils down to your D.N.A.

97
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,930
And how long you've been waiting.

98
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:41,880
So, you have your beeper.

99
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:43,050
Yep.

100
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,270
Four years is a long time.

101
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,790
Susan Bremer?

102
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:00,780
Yeah?

103
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:05,040
Monroe Carter. From Fairview high.

104
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,880
I sat behind you in chem lab.

105
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,550
I was yearbook photographer?

106
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,480
Now I sell pharmaceutical supplies.

107
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,540
You know, I friended you on facebook,

108
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,970
like, 12 times.

109
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,750
I guess I didn't get them.

110
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,480
No worries. Tell me, what's new? How are you?

111
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,360
I need a kidney transplant.

112
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,100
I'm gonna be spending the next three to four years

113
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,320
on dialysis three times a week, five hours a day.

114
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:38,700
Wow. I-I didn't know.

115
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,610
Then again, if you'd friended me...

116
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,300
I'll see you at the reunion...

117
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,590
If I'm still alive.

118
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:55,200
You like? Frank gave them to me.

119
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:00,090
- They belonged to my first wife.  - She's dead.

120
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:02,470
Isn't that a little... weird?

121
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:05,560
Hell, no. This necklace belonged to his second wife,

122
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,120
and she's sitting right over there.

123
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,580
That's weird.

124
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:14,070
Well, I have to admit, you two seem very happy together.

125
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:15,960
Tell her about Saturday.

126
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,000
What about Saturday?

127
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,470
Frank wants you to bring Tom and the kids back up here.

128
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,560
I wanna take a family portrait.

129
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,120
Family is very important to Frank.

130
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,540
And since my first three families aren't speaking to me,

131
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,930
I wanna get this one right,

132
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,560
So I can rub it in their miserable faces.

133
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,960
Oh, that's a sweet thought,

134
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,180
But Saturdays are kind of crazy for us.

135
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,690
Penny's got ballet, Paker's studying for the S.A.T.S--

136
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,630
Well, how about I make it worth your while?

137
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,410
You're bribing me?

138
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,390
Call it gas money if it'll make you feel any better.

139
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:49,990
- Will $500 do it? - I'm not taking his money.

140
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:54,140
Frank, I-isn't it time for your heart medicine?

141
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,890
Look how she takes care of me.

142
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,280
Do what you have to do to make this work.

143
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,620
But I'm not going over a grand.

144
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,470
What are you doing?

145
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,090
I just married the man.

146
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,090
He's in the process of redoing his will,

147
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,600
so we've gotta play ball.

148
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,820
No. I am not gonna bend over backwards

149
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:15,820
just to please that jerk.

150
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,830
You're the one who married him, not me.

151
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:22,030
I can't tell Frank no.

152
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,940
But I can tell you no.

153
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,390
So if you want the picture, you can come to our house.

154
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,910
Fine. I'll talk to him.

155
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,750
And will you stop staring at this necklace, phyllis?

156
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,170
You are not getting it back!

157
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,560
So the fashion show ends, and Yves Saint Laurent--

158
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,920
who doesn't swim, by the way--

159
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,200
rents a yacht for the after-party.

160
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,000
And that's where I met Mick Jagger.

161
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,910
Do you have any wine?

162
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,580
We don't really do wine in therapy.

163
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,030
Ah. Well, you should.

164
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,940
A few glasses, and you'd have your patients whining

165
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,210
about how daddy didn't love 'em in half the time.

166
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:02,030
Did your father not love you?

167
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,560
I was joking.

168
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,770
My dad was great.

169
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,020
He died when I was a kid.

170
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,580
Well, that must have been hard....

171
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,250
Growing up without a male presence?

172
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,670
No. She remarried.

173
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:19,150
Oh, my god.

174
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,780
I forgot to tell you the best part of the Jagger story.

175
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,630
He read my palm.

176
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,530
And he told me I would be going below deck

177
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:26,700
to have sex with him.

178
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,800
Not only is he a great singer,

179
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,390
he's an amazing psychic.

180
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,870
Gaby, why don't you like talking about your childhood?

181
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,740
What's the point? The past is the past.

182
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,960
Well, sometimes what happens to us in the past

183
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,970
affects who we are today.

184
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,540
Oh, by the way, Jagger-- big cuddler.

185
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:51,110
Gaby, come on. We're gonna have to go deeper here.

186
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:54,440
Well, that's the thing about me--there is no deeper.

187
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,210
Ask any of my friends.

188
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:58,080
I'm the shallowest person they know.

189
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,790
I'm just skin, a little blood,

190
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,780
And stories about Keith Richards drinking out of my shoes.

191
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,650
You don't have to be afraid.

192
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,150
Let's talk about your childhood.

193
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,000
I love therapy.

194
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:23,400
- Really? - Yeah. It's like a talk show,

195
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,550
where I'm the guest and the only topic is me.

196
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,620
So it's helping?

197
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,490
- You talked to her about the doll? - Ya-bup-bup-bup-bup!

198
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:32,340
That is confidential. First rule of therapy.

199
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,920
Actually, first rule of therapy is no wine,

200
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,110
But I'm gonna change that.

201
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,620
I'm so glad this is working. I've been worried about you.

202
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,890
It's exactly what I needed.

203
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:44,240
In fact, I'm gonna be going three times a week--

204
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,290
Mondays, thursdays, and fridays.

205
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:48,930
- Wow, that's a lot. - Well, it was your idea.

206
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,600
Oh, by the way, uh,

207
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,130
You're gonna have to take over my carpools on Mondays.

208
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:55,370
That's okay, right?

209
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,020
Sure. I guess I could move some things around.

210
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:02,210
Oh! And no golf on Thursdays,

211
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,320
Because you'll have to take Juanita to ballet.

212
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,090
Gaby, I do business on the links.

213
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:09,210
Do you want me to get better or not?

214
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,240
Okay.

215
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,620
Okay. I will cancel golf.

216
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,880
Oh, and on Friday, I have a gynecologist appointment.

217
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,650
Gaby!

218
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,550
That I need you to cancel.

219
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,920
Wouldn't that be great, though?

220
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,040
- Hi. - Hi.

221
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,750
I see you brought Charlie.

222
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,780
Well, you know, I don't have anyone to watch him.

223
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:43,990
- I have your cashier's check. - Thank you again, Bree.

224
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,010
Honey, let's go.

225
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:48,130
No. I haven't finished my pizza.

226
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:50,290
- Let's go. - No!

227
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,260
Listen, Bree, do you mind keeping an eye on him?

228
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,560
The bank is right across the way.

229
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,210
- I'll only be ten minutes. - I don't know. I-I--

230
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:58,600
Just order some pizza. It'll be on me.

231
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,540
So, Charlie...

232
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,420
I'm gonna play games.

233
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,480
Right.

234
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,370
Much better than conversation.

235
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:19,050
- Oh. Mr. Lynwood. - Susan.

236
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,670
My beeper went off. Does that mean--

237
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,460
yes, we found you a donor.

238
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,040
Oh, but how? You said it would probably take years.

239
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,830
The rules change if someone wants to donate a kidney

240
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,700
to a specific individual.

241
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:34,760
Wait. Uh... this is someone I know?

242
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,830
Apparently.

243
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,400
He's in my office right now signing the paperwork.

244
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,630
It's a he?

245
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,730
I'm getting a man kidney?

246
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,480
Not that I'm complaining.

247
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,950
Oh, my god.

248
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,830
Hey, susan.

249
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:58,260
Monroe. You're my donor?

250
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:01,970
Yeah. Turns out I'm a match. What are the odds?

251
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,660
I don't know what to say.

252
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,910
Well, I'm giving you a vital organ.

253
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,510
How about "Thank you"?

254
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,390
Why would you do this?

255
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,980
We haven't seen each other in years, and...

256
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,410
I barely remembered you.

257
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:17,890
I remembered you.

258
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,310
You were really wonderful to me in high school.

259
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:22,980
And you're in trouble,

260
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,600
and I wanna help.

261
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,320
Well... thank you.

262
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,160
So what's a guy gotta do to get a hug?

263
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,340
Give you a lung?

264
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,700
Oh, come here, you!

265
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,350
Oh, please know you've made me very happy.

266
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,820
I'm so glad.

267
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,810
Busted.

268
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,630
I'm on my way to Mrs. Goodman's place to finish that job,

269
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,770
and what do I see?

270
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:02,120
Your car, parked in front of a pizza joint.

271
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,360
Yeah, about that--

272
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,060
Admit it. You're hooked.

273
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:09,140
What are you, a deep-dish girl? Thin crust?

274
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:13,680
Yep. You got me. I am a closet pizza lover.

275
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,680
Mystery solved. You can go to your job now.

276
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,070
I need more quarters.

277
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:23,740
Who's this? What do you got, some secret boyfriend?

278
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,100
This is, um, Charlie.

279
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,880
I'm, uh, watching, uh, him for a friend of mine.

280
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,760
I'm sorry, Charlie. I don't have any more change.

281
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,790
- Now, could you excuse us? - You got quarters?

282
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,240
I got some.

283
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:39,470
Come on.

284
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,270
What about Mrs. Goodman?

285
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:44,300
She's lived without a screen door for 30 years.

286
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,960
She can wait another half hour.

287
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,130
All right. Let's see what you got.

288
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,510
I'm gonna show you something. This is a secret, all right?

289
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:55,800
But this is just between you and me. Hand...

290
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,090
In the cookie jar. Bang. Let's see it.

291
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:01,620
Hey! High five.

292
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,900
That was a good one. Let's see it again. One more.

293
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,900
Uh-huh. Step-back jumper fadeaway.

294
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,840
Nice one.

295
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,430
Are you kiddin' me? One more,

296
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:18,210
I'm calling the NBA.

297
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,850
That was awesome.

298
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,550
Did you see that? Three in a row.

299
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:27,170
I certainly did. It was wonderful.

300
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,680
Charlie, I gotta take off. Nice meeting you.

301
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,120
See you later.

302
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,690
Bye!

303
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:37,250
Bye. Remember me when you're on the Lakers.

304
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,350
They're here!

305
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:54,330
Whoa. Frank drives a Bentley.

306
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,140
Of course he does.

307
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,480
Why are we taking this stupid picture?

308
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,920
I mean, we barely even know the guy.

309
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,700
We're doing it for your grandma.

310
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,390
And the lovely man she just married.

311
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,760
Hello! Welcome!

312
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,400
- Hello, everybody! - Hey, grandma.

313
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,390
So, this really is where they live.

314
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,840
I thought you were kiddin'.

315
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,850
How was the drive over, Frank?

316
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,880
It took forever.

317
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:26,270
We got behind this Asian woman driver--

318
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:29,230
Slow as soy sauce going uphill in winter.

319
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:34,460
Okay. Small talk's over. Let's take the picture.

320
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,080
We were all thinking we'd sit over here.

321
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,760
No, I don't wanna see your crappy kitchen in the background there.

322
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,990
Let's move this sofa over there. I want it to be real homey.

323
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,120
Cagney and Lacey, grab this end of the couch.

324
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,510
What are you doing?

325
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,960
You can't just walk into people's houses

326
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,400
and move furniture around.

327
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,260
When it looks like this, you can.

328
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,790
Uh--no, no, no. Put it back.

329
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:01,070
It's bad enough you make me drive all the way out here

330
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,900
to east podunk. Well, bull!

331
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:05,200
I want my picture, my way!

332
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,240
Hey!

333
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:16,560
Whatever you say.

334
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,770
Frank, that's too heavy. You're all red.

335
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,790
Well, that's 'cause the girls here were not much help.

336
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:27,600
Okay, everyone. Come and take your place around...

337
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,360
Grandpa Frank.

338
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,520
Okay.

339
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:35,480
Here we go.

340
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:40,970
Everybody smile and say "Bentley."

341
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:43,080
Bentley.

342
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,490
Okay. Nobody move. I wanna check that it's good.

343
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:50,590
Ooh. Hang on.

344
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,160
We have to do it again. Frank, your eyes are closed.

345
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:56,170
Frank?

346
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:58,350
Frank?

347
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,820
Oh, no.

348
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,070
What's wrong?

349
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:04,860
He's dead.

350
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,530
Of course he is.

351
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,460
There's no pulse.

352
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,660
No pulse. He's definitely dead.

353
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,110
Is his ghost gonna be trapped in our house?

354
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:22,920
Is he gonna haunt us?

355
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,140
No, honey. Of course not.

356
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,410
Gross. A dead guy's on our couch.

357
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,400
And I'm having friends over.

358
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:32,950
How long till he starts to smell?

359
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,950
Kids, go upstairs. There's nothing to see here.

360
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,150
Whoa. What are you talking about? There's a dead body.

361
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,910
That's totally something to see.

362
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,470
Okay, kids. Come on. Let's go. Upstairs.

363
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,830
Come on.

364
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,510
Mom, I'm so sorry.

365
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:58,810
I can't believe he's gone. Just like that.

366
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,730
I know. I know.

367
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,860
What are you doing?

368
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,680
Uh, I'm calling the police

369
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,730
so they can get a coroner over here.

370
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,470
Uh, hang on. Y-you can't call them yet.

371
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,310
Why not?

372
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,200
That new will I told you about--

373
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,230
The one leaving everything to me?

374
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,510
It doesn't go into effect until tomorrow.

375
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,040
Oh, no.

376
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,170
No, no.

377
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,730
You want me to keep him here?

378
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,780
Like that? All night?

379
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,430
If we call the coroner now,

380
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,510
I get nothing.

381
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:40,310
If we call in the morning... millions.

382
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:43,960
I didn't want Frank in my house when he was alive.

383
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:46,030
Now you want me to hang out with his corpse?

384
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,070
Well, then throw a sheet over him

385
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:49,820
and spray a little air freshener.

386
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,120
You won't even notice.

387
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,830
Frank wanted me to have that money.

388
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,940
No! I-it's too weird!

389
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,870
Y-you wouldn't have to take care of me anymore.

390
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:03,610
In fact, I could even take care of you.

391
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:07,720
College tuition? Braces?

392
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:11,570
It would make me feel so good

393
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,180
to be able to help you for a change.

394
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:24,440
It's been a long time, son.

395
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,660
Yeah, I guess.

396
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,600
How's it going?

397
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:30,580
I couldn't be better.

398
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:33,910
What, uh, can I do for ya? Wait, wait, wait.

399
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:37,140
Let me guess. You want money.

400
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:41,560
I nailed it, didn't I? Uh, but you can see,

401
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:44,630
a lot of other people-- they... they got here first.

402
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,070
Well, sorry to hear that.

403
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:52,240
Who cares? It's time to downsize, minimize my carbon footprint.

404
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:55,240
You feeling okay, buddy?

405
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,830
I feel great.

406
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,920
Sounds like you're the one having problems.

407
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:03,440
Well, Susan and I are going through a rough time,

408
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,120
like a lot of people.

409
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:07,470
So how screwed are you?

410
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,640
We had to rent out our house...

411
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,570
to your father, in fact.

412
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:17,240
My father's in prison.

413
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,930
He's out.

414
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:21,010
You didn't know?

415
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,460
No.

416
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,630
- You sure you're okay? - I just can't believe

417
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:35,770
that bastard gets to walk free after everything that he did!

418
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,710
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you.

419
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:38,760
It's--it's okay. Just...

420
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:43,020
Could you leave? I-I-I-I need to be alone. Just...

421
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,750
Tom...

422
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:05,400
You never sneak up behind someone

423
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:07,110
when they're staring at a dead person!

424
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:13,310
I'm sorry. It's just... your scream...

425
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:16,630
it was like all the testosterone left your body at once.

426
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,920
This whole thing creeps me out.

427
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,760
It's just...

428
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:24,490
a body.

429
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,630
How do you become this guy?

430
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:30,040
9 kids, 14 grandchildren,

431
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:31,750
and you never talk to any of them.

432
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,070
That's the tricky thing about money.

433
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:37,320
Changes people.

434
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:40,920
Changes relationships.

435
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,540
It sure does.

436
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:45,960
And after you're dead, what's it all mean?

437
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:55,900
Not funny.

438
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:01,630
Hello.

439
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:04,180
Hi. This is Maria. I'm just calling to confirm

440
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:06,740
Gabrielle Solis for her 1:00 appointment.

441
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:08,530
Yep. She's on her way.

442
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,790
Terrific. You wouldn't happen to know

443
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,770
what kind of treatment she wants today, do you?

444
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,280
Uh, I don't know.

445
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,510
Whatever you've been doing seems to be working.

446
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,900
Well, on Monday she got the seaweed wrap,

447
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,890
wednesday the hot stone massage. We just want to make sure

448
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:24,740
she takes full advantage of our entire spa menu.

449
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:29,220
Oh, she is taking full advantage, all right.

450
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,760
Oh, good, Sandro. There you are.

451
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:38,820
I think we should start on my shoulders today.

452
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,890
Mm. That's good.

453
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,130
Maybe a little lighter on the pressure.

454
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:50,290
No, no. Lighter.

455
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:53,350
Okay, maybe let's not do the shoulders.

456
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,240
Okay. How about the glutes?

457
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:00,880
Carlos? What are you doing here?

458
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,170
What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in therapy.

459
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,670
This is therapy! Didn't you see the sign?

460
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,730
"Massage therapy," "Aromatherapy."

461
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,450
I talked to Dr. Wyner. She said that

462
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,190
you haven't been back since the first session. Why not?

463
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:15,180
Well... I just don't think I really need it.

464
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,720
I mean, this is really helping.

465
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:20,380
No. This is ignoring the problem.

466
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,100
You know, the way you say "Problem,"

467
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:25,830
you make it seem a whole lot worse than it actually is.

468
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,990
Gaby, you almost got us killed pulling a doll out of the car.

469
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:34,790
Fine. If it'll get you off my ass,

470
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:36,650
I'll make an appointment for next week.

471
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,870
Now get your clothes on. We're leaving.

472
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,800
God, now I'm so tense.

473
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:45,150
I'll give you 100 bucks

474
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,230
if you work on my shoulders for ten minutes. Aah!

475
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:50,670
That's for free. Let's go.

476
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:57,720
He--he came downstairs just after midnight to watch some tv,

477
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:00,090
and we didn't find him until this morning.

478
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,470
Well, in that case,

479
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,680
I'll just put down time of death around 3:00 A.M.

480
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,800
Would you like us

481
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,210
to bring the body directly to the funeral home?

482
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,320
Yes, thank you.

483
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:10,160
Again, ma'am, I'm sorry for your loss.

484
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,680
Oh, my god. I'm rich!

485
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,800
Again, ma'am, I'm sorry for your loss.

486
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:22,470
Oh, I know.

487
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,050
I spent some of the best weeks of my life with Frank.

488
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:27,720
But he's gone, there's nothing we can do about it,

489
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:31,140
and I am a millionaire.

490
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:33,290
Good. You can buy me a new couch.

491
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,730
- I'll buy you whatever you want. - Oh, I was kidding.

492
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,570
Well, I wasn't. What do you need? Anyone.

493
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:39,860
I need a laptop for school.

494
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,730
- Done. - Can I have a motorcycle?

495
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:45,270
- For school? - Kids, knock it off.

496
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:47,210
Frank's body's not even in the van yet.

497
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:49,910
Actually, it is.

498
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:53,270
I don't care. We're not talking about money right now.

499
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,700
A man died-- not a bank account--a man.

500
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,440
Let's show a little respect.

501
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:05,720
We should probably figure out what to do about that Bentley.

502
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:18,350
Zach?

503
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,720
Anybody here?

504
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:24,220
Whoa, Zach. Zach, it's me!

505
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:28,940
Sorry. It's, uh...

506
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,860
It's a rough neighborhood.

507
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,430
You know how it is.

508
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,990
So... two visits in one year.

509
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:37,340
What's up?

510
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,870
Hey, would you mind, uh, sitting down? We need to talk.

511
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,330
Do we?

512
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,160
Sure... just... a minute.

513
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,180
Who you looking for, Zach? Your father?

514
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,900
Paul came to see me.

515
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,710
He thinks you shot him. That true?

516
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,930
Okay. I shot him.

517
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,830
He ruined my life, but he gets to start his over.

518
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,490
It didn't seem right.

519
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:11,800
Oh, god.

520
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:13,700
It was easy. I practiced it

521
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:18,380
in my head over and over again, and then... bam! Showtime.

522
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:20,580
But then I got all paranoid

523
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:22,160
and I dumped the stupid gun at Bree's.

524
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:22,880
I mean, I don't--I don't

525
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:24,650
know what I was thinking with that one.

526
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:25,570
I wasn't thinking.

527
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:29,540
Yeah. That's the problem with being high.

528
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,940
You do things without thinking.

529
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:33,420
What? I'm not using drugs.

530
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:39,770
Zach. I've been there.

531
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:44,760
You need help. Now we got to get you into rehab.

532
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:46,280
You want to send me to rehab?

533
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,900
So what, so my father can come

534
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:49,830
and find me and take me to prison?

535
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,830
-No way. -I just want to get you some help.

536
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,780
It's too late for you to pretend to be my father.

537
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,820
You're right. But I still care.

538
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,170
Then why did you let me go in the first place?

539
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,280
You're the one who let me get raised by that monster.

540
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,420
No, that's not how things happened.

541
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,750
-I don't care. I don't care. -Let me help you--

542
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:05,690
Just get out my house, all right?

543
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:07,690
Just get out of my house!

544
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:25,340
It's really nice of you to have me over.

545
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:27,750
Are you kidding? I am gonna be spending the rest

546
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:30,870
of my life thinking of ways to thank you. But as a start...

547
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,940
Oh. Really?

548
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:35,110
Oh, come on. All right, let's...

549
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:41,120
That is so sweet.

550
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:42,170
A crystal heart.

551
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,350
I looked for a crystal kidney-- surprisingly hard to find.

552
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,700
You know, in high school

553
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,170
I always dreamt you'd give me your heart.

554
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,910
You know, speaking of high school,

555
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,900
I, uh, have a present for you, too.

556
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,750
In addition to the one that's being ripped out of your body?

557
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,340
I'm sorry. That-- that was a little too vivid.

558
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,400
No, that's all right.

559
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:08,810
Here, uh... here you go.

560
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:11,150
Oh... what is this?

561
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:14,700
It's just some memorabilia that I'd thought you'd enjoy.

562
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,120
Some photos I took that

563
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,720
I didn't make the cut for the yearbook.

564
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,690
Oh, my god.

565
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,680
There I am on the field hockey team...

566
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:27,020
and in "Pippin."

567
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,800
These are great. Who else do you have in here?

568
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,440
Oh, there's me on the debate club...

569
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:35,470
and me at the spring formal...

570
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,460
me in a bathing suit...

571
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:41,050
taken through a fence.

572
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,310
Not easy to get.

573
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:45,230
Those bushes around your yard were really thick.

574
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:53,310
Is this one of my old English papers?

575
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:57,150
Yeah. You threw it away, and I fished it out of the garbage.

576
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:00,490
That's also where I found this. Uh....

577
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,070
Here.

578
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,050
My retainer?

579
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,880
I would have returned it, but I was too scared to talk to you.

580
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:12,040
Isn't it funny how we're talking now?

581
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,740
Yeah, really funny.

582
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:17,080
And now...

583
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,310
we're gonna be bonded...

584
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:21,520
you know... forever.

585
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:25,580
You know, if you told me back in high school that one day

586
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:28,220
my kidney would be cleansing Susan Bremer's blood,

587
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:30,970
I would have been the happiest guy on earth.

588
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:35,950
Well, I'm glad I could make that happen for you.

589
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:47,040
- Oh, my.  - Here

590
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,410
Why don't you go see what's shaking at the malt shop?

591
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:51,730
Wow. Thanks, grandma.

592
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:54,440
Hey. What's all this?

593
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:57,960
A little thank you for all the help you've been

594
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,780
the last few days. Open it, open it.

595
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:05,780
Wow, it's beautiful.

596
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:08,910
Mm-hmm. 2200 bucks. Didn't bat an eye.

597
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,200
That's a lot of money.

598
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,340
Oh, there's more where that came from.

599
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,800
Hey, why don't you and the whole fam-damily

600
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,910
come to my house for dinner sunday night?

601
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,740
I thought you were coming here sunday night.

602
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,750
I was gonna send one of the kids to pick you up.

603
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,610
Nah. I think it's better you come to me.

604
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:28,320
Oh, but sunday's a school night, and Tom's got

605
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,990
an early meeting monday morning. How about saturday?

606
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:34,090
Nah. Sunday.

607
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,890
Oh, heads up--

608
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,760
Dinners at the center are fancy. You'll have to squeeze

609
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,550
those boys of yours into some jackets and ties.

610
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:44,410
But, mom... mom... mom!

611
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:48,140
Are you not listening? It's not gonna work for us.

612
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,340
I would think you would want to make it work, Lynette...

613
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,770
given everything I'm gonna be doing for the family.

614
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,290
Are you blackmailing me?

615
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:01,980
No! I'm inviting you to dinner.

616
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:06,530
If you can't make it, I can ask one of your sisters.

617
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:16,960
No, no, no, no, no. No, cover your man. Come on.

618
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:25,680
Hey, babe. Game's almost over.

619
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,140
Are you kidding me?

620
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:40,710
You okay?

621
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:46,490
I'm sorry. I should have given this to you before.

622
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,440
Why are you giving me a picture

623
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,820
of the kid from the pizza place?

624
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,590
He's your son.

625
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:06,390
I still can't get over this.

626
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:08,820
You run into some random classmate from high school,

627
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,490
and he's gonna end up saving your life?

628
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:11,730
Here's the part I can't get over.

629
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:13,540
You never put out for this guy?

630
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:17,720
No. No, I barely remember him. Monroe is just doing

631
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:21,820
this incredibly selfless act of charity. It's inspiring.

632
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,560
What's this?

633
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,050
Uh... n-nothing. Just put that away.

634
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:28,730
It's got your name on the cover in glitter.

635
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:32,110
No, it's just a gift from Monroe. Can I please have that?

636
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,760
Oh, my god.

637
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:40,760
Yeah. You used to be cute. What happened?

638
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,870
No, there's, like, a million pictures of you in here.

639
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:46,230
I guess he had a little crush on me.

640
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:49,940
Crush? No, Susan. This Monroe guy's obsessed with you.

641
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,120
This is a shrine.

642
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,200
-It is not. -It is. I know.

643
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,700
I've made them. That's why I'm not allowed

644
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,310
to mail things to Ryan Seacrest anymore.

645
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:58,310
It's creepy. It's like the part of the movie

646
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:00,520
when they go to the guy's basement and find the candles

647
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,570
in front of the picture of the woman he's gonna kill.

648
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:06,170
You know... those guys are often misunderstood.

649
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:07,970
And you're gonna take a kidney from this man?

650
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:09,080
Okay, I admit,

651
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:14,510
I-I'm a little concerned, and, yes, he may be 5% stalker.

652
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:16,470
Is this a lock of your hair?

653
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:18,760
10% stalker.

654
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:24,660
But if I don't take his kidney, I could wait another six years.

655
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:25,970
Why shouldn't I do it?

656
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:28,220
Because you'll be forever connected to him.

657
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:29,860
You'll never get rid of him.

658
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:30,840
And I have a feeling

659
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:34,790
That's not the only organ he wants to... share with you.

660
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:40,560
- Carlos, can you feel my forehead? - No.

661
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,290
- I think I have a fever. - You're fine.

662
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:45,250
- You didn't even feel! - 'cause I don't need to. Liar.

663
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,810
No, I'm really sick. Let's reschedule.

664
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:49,490
I shouldn't see the therapist today.

665
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:50,470
We're going in.

666
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:53,060
- What if I need to throw up? - It's a therapist's office.

667
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:55,010
- You're supposed to get it all out. - Carlos--

668
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:58,510
You are going to therapy, and that's all there is to it.

669
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,390
Fine. Can I at least go to the bathroom first?

670
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:04,570
You know I have a bladder the size of a dime.

671
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,310
- How many years have we been married? - Too many, if you ask me!

672
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,970
- Where do you think you're going? - I'm going home.

673
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:50,340
No. Gaby, you are sick. You need help.

674
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,620
Look, you want me take pills, I will take them.

675
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,740
You want me to see a hypnotist? Bring him to the house.

676
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:57,160
Hell, I'll even let you hire a priest to do an exorcism.

677
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,840
But what I am not going to do is talk to that woman in there.

678
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,670
Why not?

679
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:03,010
Because she wants to talk about my childhood!

680
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:12,110
Can I say one thing?

681
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:18,640
You did find a way to talk about it before... with me.

682
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,330
Just that once. We had gotten married.

683
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:22,170
I thought you had a right to know.

684
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:24,220
And you said that you never wanted to talk about it again,

685
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:26,350
And I have respected that.

686
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,580
But over the years, I have seen what it costs you.

687
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:32,100
The nights I hear you crying in the bathroom...

688
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,990
Sad look on your face when people ask about your past...

689
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:38,240
You think that you've left it behind, but you haven't, Gaby.

690
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,050
You carry that burden around with you.

691
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:44,920
I just want you to consider the idea that

692
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:49,770
This therapist might be able to help you let all that go.

693
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,940
Can you come with me?

694
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:03,410
So when I lost Grace,

695
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:06,750
It tapped into this need I have to protect children.

696
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:11,040
Where do you think this need came from?

697
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:22,540
'cause no one protected me.

698
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:29,450
When I was a child, my stepfather molested me.

699
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,520
Get in.

700
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:46,300
Why would I do that?

701
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,730
I know where Zach is.

702
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:55,660
Are we driving to Idaho?

703
00:37:57,510 --> 00:38:00,150
Look, the reason I didn't tell you where he was before

704
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,460
Is I didn't know what you wanted to do to him.

705
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,510
But whatever it is,

706
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:07,010
It can't be worse than what he's doing to himself.

707
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,970
And why should I care about that after he tried to kill me?

708
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,480
He's your son.

709
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,070
He's my son.

710
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:19,340
He needs our help.

711
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:35,210
Hey, neighbor.

712
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:38,880
Monroe. Uh...

713
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:42,540
What do you mean, "Neighbor"?

714
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:45,630
Well, uh, your landlady's showing me an apartment.

715
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:47,810
I figured now that we're back in each other's lives,

716
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:50,100
It would be better if I lived close.

717
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,730
Yeah, uh...

718
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:55,000
Here's the thing about that.

719
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,670
There's close...

720
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:59,130
And then there's Glenn Close.

721
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:03,580
This feels a little...

722
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,180
Stalky.

723
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,190
Stalky?

724
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,470
I-I'm giving you a kidney.

725
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,570
Monroe, come with me.

726
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:19,710
The other day, when you were over here,

727
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:23,740
I did not give you the full story.

728
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,920
This is mike.

729
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,260
He is my husband.

730
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,080
And this is our son M.J.

731
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:36,760
Okay. Why are you showing me this?

732
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,940
Because I want you to see that

733
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:42,780
There isn't room for anyone else in that picture.

734
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:45,690
Don't get me wrong.

735
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:49,740
I am so grateful that you want to give me a kidney.

736
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:54,510
But once the operation is over, that has to be it.

737
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:56,460
Why?

738
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,630
Because...

739
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:01,630
You want to be more than friends, and I'm married.

740
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,090
The tricky part is that...

741
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:09,690
I still need a kidney...

742
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:13,450
'cause I want to stay healthy for...

743
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:17,050
The two special guys in that picture.

744
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,710
So if you...

745
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:22,330
Still want to give me one...

746
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:25,180
No strings attached,

747
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:27,590
I will be honored to take it...

748
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:32,060
And you will have my eternal gratitude.

749
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:36,000
Yeah, but that's all I'll have.

750
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,260
What do you say?

751
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:47,250
I can't.

752
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,520
I, uh...

753
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,050
I thought if I did this, then...

754
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:57,300
You would finally...

755
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,370
I-I know.

756
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:01,600
I know.

757
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:05,470
I-I'm so sorry.

758
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,310
Don't be.

759
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,720
I'll be fine.

760
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:14,570
All right. I guess... i'll--I'll see you around.

761
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,780
Actually, I guess I won't.

762
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:33,590
We may think we've left the past behind,

763
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:35,950
But it has a way...

764
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:38,570
Of catching up to us.

765
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:46,620
Though we want to run away,

766
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:49,800
We are forced to confront our past...

767
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:56,340
And the secrets that it buried...

768
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:59,060
Must come into the light.

769
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:04,640
And then, if we are strong,

770
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,450
We are able to move on.

771
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,600
Yes, we all need to leave the past behind

772
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,160
And move on toward the future.

773
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:22,520
And if we're lucky,

774
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:25,940
We will have help getting there.
