00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:02,750
Previously on...

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:06,150
Ten years ago, Carlos' mother
died after being hit by a car

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,720
that Andrew was driving.

4
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,120
Orson packed his bags...

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,390
You are not the woman I thought you were.

6
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,990
He's my son. I had no choice.

7
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,290
And I no longer choose to be your husband.

8
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:18,330
And Bree decided to come clean.

9
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,000
There's something I need to tell you...

10
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,330
It's the kind of thing
that could end our friendship.

11
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,540
A dying nurse made a confession...

12
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,570
The people who run this hospital
need to know what I did.

13
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:31,340
How do you tell parents
the child they've been raising

14
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,180
isn't really theirs?

15
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,710
Financial worries drove
Susan to a big decision...

16
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,320
- You can't sell your house.
- We're not selling. We're renting.

17
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,040
Which led to the return
of a long-lost neighbor.

18
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,160
The truth is, I used to live here.

19
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,560
Oh, then I guess everyone will
be surprised to see you again.

20
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,090
They absolutely will.

21
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:56,770
There was a time when my husband and I

22
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,400
were very happy.

23
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,670
I remember warm summer afternoons

24
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:05,010
and backyard barbecues

25
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,810
and laughter with friends.

26
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:12,400
Our life was like some
kind of suburban dream.

27
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:16,890
But the day comes when
we all must wake up.

28
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:27,300
For me, that day came
when a letter arrived.

29
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,230
As threats go,

30
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,370
it was concise and to the point.

31
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:39,540
I did what I had to to protect my family.

32
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:44,980
My husband found out who wrote the letter.

33
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:50,250
He let her know how much this upset him.

34
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:55,960
Her sister figured out
what my husband had done.

35
00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:01,830
So she decided to frame him for murder...

36
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:06,970
Her murder, to be more specific.

37
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:11,040
And that's when the dream
that was Paul Young's life

38
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,880
became a nightmare.

39
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,830
Years later,

40
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,340
a woman was pulled over for speeding.

41
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:28,460
This woman had no identification,

42
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:29,930
so she was arrested.

43
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,530
And that is how people
learned that Felicia Tillman

44
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:38,150
was very much alive.

45
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:43,570
I see you got the suit
I sent over. You like it?

46
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,810
I like anything that's not orange.

47
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,650
Well, get ready to do
all sorts of shopping.

48
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,610
Your settlement check came in.

49
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,820
So where are you going first?

50
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,520
After all these years in prison,
I bet you're ready to party.

51
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,890
All I want is to go home.

52
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,170
What, to your old neighborhood?

53
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:02,090
You sound surprised.

54
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,960
Well, none of your neighbors
supported you during the trial.

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,230
They didn't visit while you were here.

56
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,300
No one would blame you if
you hated them a little.

57
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,670
Oh, I don't hate them...

58
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,340
a little.

59
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,550
And so my husband
returned to Wisteria Lane.

60
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,450
The neighbors were surprised to see him.

61
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:32,890
They hadn't thought about
Paul Young in years.

62
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,040
But he had thought about them.

63
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,100
And he was going to make sure

64
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:44,140
they'd never forget him... again.

66
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:59,350
The phone call that comes in
the middle of the night...

67
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:03,740
The letter that arrives
by special courier...

68
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:08,080
The e-mail marked "urgent!"...

69
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:11,830
Yes, there are all sorts of ways

70
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,670
bad news can be delivered.

71
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,370
But some news is so bad...

72
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,870
it must be delivered in person.

73
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,870
Why do I have to tell them?

74
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:26,040
You said this couple lives
in your neighborhood.

75
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,550
Trustees of the hospital

76
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,780
feel that makes you uniquely qualified.

77
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,780
And just what am I supposed to say?

78
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,320
"Great block party."

79
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,320
"By the way, one of our nurses"

80
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,960
"may have switched your baby
at birth. Try the dip."

81
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,460
Every minute we wait,

82
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,460
this hospital takes on more liability.

83
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,690
Now get on over to... Wisteria Lane

84
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,960
and tell those people what's going on.

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,150
I don't know how I'm gonna do this.

86
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,900
There's only one way to
deliver news like this...

87
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,620
remain as calm as possible.

88
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:58,130
Bree! Get out here!

89
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,580
Damn it! Why is nobody home?

90
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,830
Lorna, Gwen... Oh, thank God.

91
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,120
Well, hi, Karen. What's wrong?

92
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:08,450
Paul Young... he's back.

93
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,250
What?

94
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,510
You heard me. Now don't just stand there.

95
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,510
- We gotta warn people.
- Come on.

96
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,830
Bree, I've never seen you like this.

97
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,330
Are you all right?

98
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,330
I have something horrible to tell you,

99
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,370
and I don't know how to say it.

100
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,370
Well, you better think of somethin'.

101
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,710
You're starting to freak me out.

102
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,710
Remember that night when Carlos' mother

103
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,140
was run over by a car?

104
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,450
Well, I know who did it.

105
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,880
You what?

106
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,650
It was Andrew.

107
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,720
Oh, God!

108
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:49,010
He was only 16. I was afraid
he was gonna go to jail...

109
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,030
- Ohh!
- So Rex and I decided to cover it up.

110
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:56,630
Oh, this is... this is bad.
This is really bad.

111
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,300
I need to go throw up a little.

112
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,670
Oh, I am so sorry. And I realize
I should have told you sooner.

113
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:05,860
No! No, no, no, 
you shouldn't have told me at all!

114
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:09,400
- What?
- Now I have to tell Carlos,
and he's going to kill Andrew,

115
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,870
and then he's going to
have to go to prison,

116
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,520
so thank you for sending
my husband to prison, Bree.

117
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,520
- Nice work!
- I just couldn't live
with the secret any longer,

118
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,420
and when Orson found out,

119
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,430
- he told me I was a horrible person.
- That's why you told me?

120
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,430
Oh, please, we're all horrible people!

121
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,960
You see this? It's yours.

122
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,330
They delivered it here.
I kept it. Horrible!

123
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,500
Just so you know, Orson was so disgusted,

124
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,000
he's divorcing me.

125
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,000
Normally, I'd give you a hug,

126
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,010
- but right now I sorta don't give a crap!
- Again, very sorry.

127
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,180
God! How am I gonna tell Carlos?

128
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:42,510
He is gonna be so angry!

129
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:46,850
And he'll probably find a way to blame me!

130
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,990
You'll never guess who's back!

131
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,230
Mom, we don't have any clean plates.

132
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,250
Didn't you run the dishwasher?

133
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,170
We're also out of milk.
You gotta go to the store.

134
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,670
And the dry cleaners while you're at it.

135
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,470
Okay, everybody. Look at your hands.

136
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,710
Come on. Mm-hmm.

137
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,210
Anyone not holding a baby,
you're on your own.

138
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,550
You can wash and shop and
clean for yourselves.

139
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,550
My days of being the perfect mom are over.

140
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,750
When were those days, exactly?

141
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:22,250
It's my uterus that's worn out,
not my hearing.

142
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,270
So you're not gonna help with anything?

143
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:27,940
- 'Cause this place is really starting
to go to hell.
- Baby number five.

144
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,430
An entire basketball team
has come out of me,

145
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,930
so I'm officially too exhausted to care.

146
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:39,200
You know, the good moms enjoy
doing stuff for their families.

147
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,540
Hello?

148
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:43,070
That's your brother Preston.
He's about to be beaten.

149
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:45,080
Yes, he is. Yes, he is.

150
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,540
Mom, it's Renee Perry.

151
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,950
Hey, Renee!

152
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,920
- Who's Renee Perry?
- Oh, she's your mom's friend from college.

153
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:56,120
She's married to Doug Perry,
who plays for the Yankees.

154
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,590
- And she's really rich.
- How rich?

155
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,970
Every few years,
Renee flies mom to New York

156
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:05,360
- for a big, fancy weekend.
- And mom always comes back in a great mood.

157
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,480
So this might be perfect timing.

158
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,800
Damn it to hell. She's coming here.

159
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:10,800
Wh-when?

160
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,870
Tomorrow.

161
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,870
Why?

162
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,370
I don't know,

163
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,370
but that is something we can talk about

164
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,710
while we turn this dump
into an actual home.

165
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:21,160
Okay, people, move, move, move. Let's go!

166
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,980
Come on. Hey, you, too, Tom.

167
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,480
I'm holding the baby.

168
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,530
Well, spray her with some glass cleaner

169
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,490
and rub her on the windows.

170
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,990
I don't want Renee to
know I live like this.

171
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,990
But, mom, if she's your friend,

172
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:38,130
- won't she like you no matter how you live?
- She's not that kind of friend.

173
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,670
You're never gonna believe who's back.

174
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,520
Here we are.

175
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:47,400
Home sweet...

176
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,910
Home.

177
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,190
So... what do you think, buddy?

178
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:56,680
This is where we're gonna live?

179
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,620
Yeah.

180
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,350
So are we poor?

181
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,360
If you field this one,

182
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,460
I'll tell him where babies come from.

183
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:13,250
No, honey, we're not poor.

184
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,550
We're just...

185
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,170
lower middle class.

186
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,670
Poor people wish
they could live like this.

187
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,010
They shouldn't.

188
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,510
Oh, sweetie.

189
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,840
I know this isn't what we're used to.

190
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,850
Buddy, we're not gonna lie to you.

191
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,780
Money is a little tighter than before,

192
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,750
but that's why we're here...

193
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,120
So we can save up and
get back to our house.

194
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:36,020
And it's not gonna take that long.

195
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:37,750
Your daddy's taking on extra jobs,

196
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,160
and I'm still teaching,
and I'm gonna start selling

197
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:42,830
that really cool jewelry I've been making.

198
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,560
Oh, god.

199
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,900
Sweetie, it's gonna be okay.

200
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:53,200
And as long as we're together,
we can survive this.

201
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,740
- Hello?
- Susan!

202
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:59,130
Hi, Mrs. McCluskey. What's up?

203
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,550
- You'll never believe this.
Paul Young is back.
- What?!

204
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,110
Where is he?

205
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:10,370
Where do you think?
He's in the house you rented to him.

206
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:13,210
I didn't know.
Lee just told me it was a guy.

207
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,009
You didn't even ask for his name?

208
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:17,620
He paid in advance,
and he didn't have pets. I didn't care.

209
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,720
How is Paul even out of jail?

210
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,080
That maniac was serving a life sentence.

211
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:23,330
Hello, ladies.

212
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,060
If you'd like to come in for a while,

213
00:10:27,061 --> 00:10:28,230
I'll tell you the story.

214
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:31,910
Come on now.

215
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,680
It's a good one.

216
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,840
Felicia Tillman's alive?

217
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,290
Why are you so surprised?

218
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,700
I said that over and
over again in my trial.

219
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,240
Oh, wait. That's right.

220
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,370
None of you could make it
to the courthouse.

221
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,809
Look, Paul...

222
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:52,640
It's okay. You were busy. I get it.

223
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:55,359
I told myself I'd explain how I was framed

224
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,060
when you came to visit me in prison.
Oh, wait...

225
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,070
We're so sorry.

226
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:05,590
In our defense, we thought
you were a cold-blooded killer.

227
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:12,739
What you endured over
the last ten years...

228
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,050
I can't even imagine it.

229
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,670
No, you can't.

230
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,570
But the good news is, I'm back.

231
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,390
Yeah, about that, um,
why did you wanna come back here?

232
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,020
Well, why do you think?

233
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,030
I missed my friends.

234
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,510
Innocent or not, that guy
still gives me the creeps.

235
00:11:35,511 --> 00:11:37,960
I can't believe Paul Young
is back on Wisteria Lane.

236
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,000
And he's using my shower.

237
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:57,760
Jack!

238
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:02,419
You here for your 9 iron?
Damn, I thought if I shaved,

239
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,960
you'd wouldn't recognize
me and I could keep it.

240
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:09,220
Actually, I need to talk
to you and your wife.

241
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:10,910
Hey, Gaby!

242
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,640
In a minute!

243
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:16,430
You look a little pale, buddy.
Something wrong?

244
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,680
I think we should wait for Gaby.

245
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,440
Jack, what's going on here, man?

246
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,140
You're making me nervous.

247
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,160
Let's just go inside, hmm?

248
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,000
No! This is impossible.

249
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:31,230
We still have the bracelet
they put around Juanita's ankle

250
00:12:31,231 --> 00:12:32,120
in the hospital.

251
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:35,859
Theresa Pruitt was the nurse
in charge of those bracelets,

252
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,410
and although the hospital
did not know this at the time,

253
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,530
she had a drinking problem.

254
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,619
And eight years later,
you're telling me this.

255
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:45,530
I've spent eight years loving
someone else's daughter!

256
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:49,309
Again, I wanna stress that the hospital

257
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,719
only belatedly became...

258
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,809
Jack, I swear to God,
if you go lawyer on me,

259
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:54,450
I will put your head through a wall!

260
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:02,680
So where is our...

261
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:08,380
Biologi... God, I don't
even know what to call her.

262
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,020
We haven't been able to
track the family down yet.

263
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,660
Then we're not telling Gaby,

264
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,970
not till you find this other girl.

265
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,269
Carlos, I have a legal
responsibility here.

266
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,629
She has to be told.

267
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,310
Fine! I'll do it.

268
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,340
But I don't know how.

269
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,830
This is going to destroy her.

270
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,820
Nope. I was wrong.
Preston, switch back with Parker.

271
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,089
- Why are we doing this?
- When Renee pulls up to this house,

272
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:48,899
she is gonna see the one thing
I can show off...

273
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,120
My beautiful, beautiful family.

274
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,790
What is that, a pimple? Get in the back!

275
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:59,380
Honey, don't you think you're
getting a little carried away?

276
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:02,040
Tom, that woman lives in a penthouse.

277
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,460
We had to give up meat
so we could buy a laptop.

278
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,830
- Let me have this.
- Is that her?

279
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,830
Of course it is.

280
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,599
Okay, everybody, smile for mom

281
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,980
and her strange and twisted friendship.

282
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:27,570
Oh! Hi!

283
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,620
I'm back, Rudolfo.

284
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,319
Please tell signor Cipriani
I always stay in that suite

285
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,679
when I visit Venice,
and if it's not available,

286
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,190
I'll be very unhappy.

287
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:39,289
Now if you'll excuse me,
there's someone more important

288
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:40,360
I need to speak with.

289
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,800
Hi!

290
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,260
Hey, Jose.

291
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,610
Thanks for holding.
Look, I can't do Thursday.

292
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,690
So...

293
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,100
Jose, she'll call you back.

294
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,899
Lynette, you haven't changed.

295
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,770
Neither have you.

296
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,090
Hi, sweetie.

297
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,939
Oh, no, please tell me

298
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:02,310
you didn't dump Tom for this handsome,
young trophy husband.

299
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,420
It's me, Renee.

300
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,559
I mean, I do work out,
like, three times a week,

301
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,700
so maybe that's what you're...

302
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,390
Oh, okay.

303
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,790
- Are these your kids?
- Yeah.

304
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,649
Yes, and here

305
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:19,420
is our latest addition.

306
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,230
Oh, she's precious.

307
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:27,340
Look at you all...
What a perfect little suburban picture.

308
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:29,820
Well, you know, I've been blessed.

309
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:32,840
Very blessed.

310
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,180
I'm sorry I gotta run, Renee,
but I'm late for work.

311
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,190
Work? And I thought you wore
that sexy tie just for me.

312
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,290
You like it?

313
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,410
They... they say 
that bolder colors are coming back,

314
00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:46,360
so I thought I'd... Okay.

315
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:48,960
Bye.

316
00:15:48,961 --> 00:15:49,520
Bye.

317
00:15:49,521 --> 00:15:50,260
Love you.

318
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:52,859
Oh, I gotta say, Lynette,

319
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,760
this place is adorable.

320
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:58,910
It's so... cozy and intimate and...

321
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:00,419
Pay attention, kids.

322
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,870
You're learning a lot of
new words for "small."

323
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,640
Oh, that's not what I meant.

324
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,320
I hate banging around
my lonely old barn of a house.

325
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,310
Sometimes weeks go by without
me running into a servant.

326
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,080
I'm sure you see them on whipping day.

327
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,800
Lynette, why so mean?

328
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,720
I worked on these compliments
all the way from the airport.

329
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,699
Drive slower next time.

330
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,320
Mom.

331
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,740
It's all right. We're just
old friends reconnecting.

332
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:29,160
And I'm being sincere.
This is the way to go...

333
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,240
Stripped down to the bare essentials.

334
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,560
You know, more people
should live like this.

335
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:36,330
Most people do live like this.

336
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,779
When you're flying in your private jet,

337
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:42,320
and you look down and go,
"wow, they look like ants down there,"

338
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,530
we're the ants.

339
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,860
So you have a private jet?

340
00:16:45,861 --> 00:16:48,760
Well, it's not just ours.
We share it with the team.

341
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,750
Wait. So you get to hang out
with the Yankees?

342
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,630
- That's awesome.
- How is Doug, by the way?

343
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,439
Oh, he's fine, but all that stuff...

344
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,779
The team, the jet, the money...
It's like a fantasy world.

345
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:03,360
This is what I yearn for. This is real.

346
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:06,900
This is... sticky.

347
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,880
So you're staying in a really fancy hotel?

348
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,379
Well, I came straight from the airport,

349
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,430
so I haven't booked a hotel yet.

350
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,150
Oh, why don't you stay with us?

351
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,570
Oh, I'm sure Renee wouldn't want...

352
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:20,030
I would love to.

353
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:22,579
Are you sure?

354
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:25,640
'Cause, you know, five kids...
It gets stickier.

355
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:26,840
Oh, I don't mind.

356
00:17:26,841 --> 00:17:27,630
It'd be fun.

357
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,750
I've got a lot of catching up
to do with my old, old friend.

358
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:36,049
By the way, I have a
doctor who can get rid

359
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:37,210
of one of those "olds."

360
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:40,549
All right. Well, I guess I can set you up

361
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:41,630
on the sleeper sofa.

362
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:45,070
Sleeper sofa? Ooh. Look at me.

363
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:46,700
I'm one of the ants.

364
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,370
Hi. You own the building, right?

365
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,580
I'm Susan Delfino.
My husband Mike and I are in 1b.

366
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,920
Jiggle the handle. The toilet's fine.

367
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:58,790
Oh, no, no, no.

368
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,220
I'm just dropping off
the security deposit.

369
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,300
Sorry it's late. We've been
having some money problems.

370
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:05,950
Have you?

371
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:10,590
Well, I'm Maxine.

372
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,620
Come on in. I'll make you some tea.

373
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,140
- Thanks.
- Come on.

374
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,460
That is such a shame
about Mike's business.

375
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:21,820
And here you are, with no skills,

376
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,910
- trying to make ends meet.
- Mm. Oh, I have skills.

377
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,550
I make my own jewelry. I made this.

378
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,790
Can you believe it?

379
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,700
I really can.

380
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:36,119
You know, I remember when my
husband Sidney passed away.

381
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,670
His illness took every dime we had.

382
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,380
And I didn't know what I was gonna do.

383
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,599
Well, it looks like you did okay.

384
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,549
I mean, you own the building.

385
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,990
Yeah, well, that's because
I stopped pouting.

386
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:51,199
I got off my tuchis,
and I started my own business.

387
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,120
And now I'm able to help
other struggling women.

388
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,319
You know, they set their own hours.

389
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,070
They work from their own homes.

390
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:01,550
And oh, yoy, yoy, the money.

391
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:04,460
That sounds like a dream job.

392
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:07,570
I'll bet you'd be real good at it.

393
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,850
Let me show you.

394
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,390
Are there phones involved?

395
00:19:10,391 --> 00:19:12,440
I've been told I have an
excellent phone voice.

396
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,820
Uh, "hello. Can I interest you in a..."

397
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:20,010
Oh, my God.

398
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,590
It's my web site!

399
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:29,380
Va-va-va-broom.com.

400
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,469
I got a 10-unit Mac pro server farm

401
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:35,330
and a 1.5-Meg t1 line.

402
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,070
You run a porn site?

403
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,020
You're trying to lure me into pornography?

404
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,620
Oh, my God! Did you slip
something into my tea?

405
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:47,090
Honey, relax. This is strictly P.G....

406
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:49,759
Women doing housework in lingerie,

407
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,470
no nudity, no sex.

408
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,030
So?

409
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,350
What do you say?

410
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,960
What do I say?

411
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,120
I say... shame!

412
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,690
Shame on you!

413
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:02,970
These are nice, respectable girls

414
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:04,550
just like you.

415
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,010
Deirdre's going to night school
to become a nurse,

416
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,540
and Martha's trying
to start over after a divorce.

417
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,050
Don't they worry about
people they know seeing them?

418
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,800
Most of our clients are overseas...

419
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:19,550
You know, Europe, Asia.

420
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,640
So if you go to Kuala Lumpur, wear a hat.

421
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,920
Come on.

422
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:27,340
You said you had money problems.

423
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,070
Here's what Martha makes in a week.

424
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,640
Unto Martha for selling her dignity

425
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:43,840
to the highest bidder.

426
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:46,440
I promise, you won't do anything

427
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,870
I wouldn't let my own daughter do!

428
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,190
Look for yourself! She's on camera three!

429
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,460
What are you looking at?

430
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,320
Just some family photos.

431
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,060
That's you the day you were born.

432
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,160
Daddy? Who's that?

433
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:15,570
That's your grandma.

434
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,780
I wish I had met her.

435
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:21,040
You would've loved her.

436
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,240
Do you think about her a lot?

437
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:26,720
Every day.

438
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,640
She was the light of my life,

439
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:32,260
and that's why we named you after her,

440
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,710
because I could not imagine a world

441
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,930
without a Juanita Solis in it.

442
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,490
Do you want me to tuck her in?

443
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,530
No, I'll do it. Come on.

444
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,720
Amy and I want to go to the mall tomorrow.

445
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,790
Oh, sorry, honey. I have plans.

446
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,560
I could ride my bike.

447
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,290
By yourself? I don't think so.

448
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,800
Why not?

449
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,560
You're too young. That's why not.

450
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,660
You're mean.

451
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,650
Well, sometimes I have to be mean

452
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,990
'cause it's my job to protect you.

453
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:14,800
What if you got hit by a bus?

454
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:16,440
That's not gonna happen.

455
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,180
Well, I can't take that chance.

456
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,550
You are my whole world.

457
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:24,590
If something happened to you,
it would ruined my life.

458
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:27,720
You understand that?

459
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,830
Well, that's the last of it.

460
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:49,760
I'll put these books in the car.
Pleasure meeting you, Bree.

461
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:53,730
Nice of your physical therapist
to help with the move.

462
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:58,370
So are you gonna be okay?

463
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,570
Let's see. Uh, I'm getting a divorce.

464
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,670
I lost my business, and I'm sitting here

465
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:08,340
trying to remember why I quit drinking.

466
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,720
I've had better Mondays.

467
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,980
I'm sorry.

468
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,380
Don't be.

469
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,300
It's for the best.

470
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,730
We haven't been happy for a long time.

471
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:27,070
You know what you need?

472
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,780
A project.

473
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,810
No. That's what I always do...

474
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:35,400
Distract myself with meaningless busywork

475
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:38,630
as a way of avoiding my... emotions.

476
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:45,690
I think I need to sit quietly

477
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,030
and think about what I'm
gonna do with my life.

478
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:52,250
Well, whatever you do...

479
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,340
I know it'll be spectacular.

480
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:08,720
Good-bye, Bree.

481
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:45,520
Hi, Bree.

482
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:48,610
I've been thinking about
our conversation last night.

483
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,390
I just wanted to see how you were doing.

484
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,330
I'm fine.

485
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,250
In fact, I took your advice.

486
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:57,720
I found myself a project.

487
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,280
I'm surprised you agreed to see me.

488
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:08,040
I wanted to spit in your face.

489
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:10,090
I didn't realize there'd be glass.

490
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,420
That's right. You're not used to prison.
Give yourself time.

491
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,450
What is it now... two to five years?

492
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:17,740
18 months with good behavior.

493
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,220
You're giving me a lot of reasons

494
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,440
to be extremely well behaved.

495
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:24,070
Maybe I can give you a few
pointers on prison life.

496
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,440
I've become a bit of an expert
thanks to you. Hey, here's one.

497
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:30,350
It never hurts to tip
the guard does your cavity search.

498
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,290
Listen to me, you son of a bitch.

499
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,760
I don't care what I have to do.

500
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:41,320
I will see you behind
bars again, or dead...

501
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,200
Whichever is easier.

502
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:47,550
Here's another pointer.

503
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:49,500
They always record the conversations,

504
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:52,060
so be careful about threatening
the man you framed.

505
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,330
You murdered my sister.

506
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:58,290
That's a crazy, groundless accusation.

507
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,340
I have to go now.

508
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:02,420
I have things to do like shopping

509
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,780
and walking around in the open air

510
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,470
without a care in the world.

511
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,200
You know you did it.

512
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,160
I did.

513
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:20,580
Wow, they're all so... big.

514
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:22,380
Exactly. Thank you.

515
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:25,100
- You're welcome?
- Oh, I knew you guys would get it,

516
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,700
unlike those idiots that walked
by my card table in the park.

517
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:30,510
It's not jewelry. It's wearable art.

518
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,930
So... who wants to try these earrings?

519
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:37,090
Oh, uh, I'm not sure that my delicate ears

520
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:38,880
can support something so large.

521
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,330
How about Gaby?

522
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:44,550
She has big, strong, latino ears.

523
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:50,880
Lynette, where is this friend of yours?

524
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,350
We're all dying to meet her.

525
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,480
Come on.

526
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,400
I need a volunteer. Lynette?

527
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:59,360
Yes! Yes!

528
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,610
How's it feel?

529
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,740
About as good as it looks,
I'm guessing. I'll take 'em.

530
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:06,620
Yes!

531
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,060
What are you guys getting?

532
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,340
I'm gonna buy this... for Bree

533
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:15,470
and her strong, protestant neck.

534
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,660
Oh, you guys are the best.

535
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,970
Oh, hey, here she is.

536
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:25,150
Okay, Susan, Bree, Gaby,

537
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:27,360
this is my old college roommate, Renee.

538
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,180
Hi. It is so nice to finally meet you.

539
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,780
Lynette has talked so much
about her friend from college.

540
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,220
Oh, yes, you know how in school

541
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,350
the pretty girls always hang out together?

542
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,790
Well, I refused to go along with that.

543
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:42,930
Renee comes off a little stuck up

544
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:45,500
when you first meet her,
which is a real time-saver.

545
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:46,580
Sit down!

546
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:50,560
So, Renee, you have to tell us.

547
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:52,410
What was Lynette like in college?

548
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,090
Uh, absolutely fearless.

549
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,860
She just kept wearing
those parachute pants,

550
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,610
lesbian rumors be damned.

551
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:02,610
Yes, Renee was always the one
with the fashion sense.

552
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:05,650
Before I met her, I'd never
even heard of Gucci or Prada...

553
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:06,760
or chlamydia.

554
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:09,480
Wow, you guys play rough.

555
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:13,610
No, it's just what we do. It's fun.

556
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:16,960
I tease her about being all
botulism from the nose up...

557
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:19,510
And I tease her about
being all cottage cheese

558
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,970
from the waist down.

559
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:25,840
So, Renee, we hear
that you're married to Doug Perry?

560
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:27,560
The baseball player?

561
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:28,990
No surprise there.

562
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:32,490
In our sorority, Renee was voted
most likely to marry well.

563
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:35,310
And Lynette was voted
most likely to succeed.

564
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:41,130
So, Bree, I hear you're an amazing cook.

565
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:43,780
Hang on a second. What was that?

566
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,070
What?

567
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,950
That... "Aw."

568
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,700
Oh, nothing.

569
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,890
I just didn't wanna... make you feel bad.

570
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,840
About what?

571
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,540
Well, it... it's just that, uh,

572
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,910
I think our college
friends would be surprised

573
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,970
to see how you ended up.

574
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,360
Oh, I thought they were still playing.

575
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:10,450
You know, Renee, I have had a
career and raised a family.

576
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,710
And that's great.

577
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:14,720
It's just that we had
such high hopes for you.

578
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:17,811
Instead in spend the last fifteen years
sponging off a rich guy. 

579
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:20,560
Hey, let's stop before somebody gets hurt.

580
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:22,490
Whatever I got, I got on my own.

581
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:23,820
And what have you got?

582
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:25,870
A blouse from the "I've
stopped trying" collection

583
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,290
and a pair of earrings
your kid made at camp?

584
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:31,050
And... somebody got hurt.

585
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:34,190
That's great. Easy shots.
You got more money than me.

586
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,280
Oh, it's not about the money.

587
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,860
The Lynette I knew never
would have settled for this.

588
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,790
You were adventurous.

589
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:42,810
You backpacked through Croatia.

590
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:45,980
You jumped onstage
at a Springsteen concert.

591
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,470
It's just hard for me to reconcile

592
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:50,380
this suburban housewife with the girl...

593
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:53,980
who had a threesome with two of
the guys from the rugby team.

594
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:04,710
Why would she do this?

595
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,050
Why would she jump in a private jet

596
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,700
and fly all the way across the country

597
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,060
just to dump on my life?

598
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,710
- Two guys, huh?
- We're not talking about that anymore.

599
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:15,670
I mean, isn't her life perfect enough?

600
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,100
Does she really need to score bonus points

601
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:19,840
by taking me down?

602
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,190
So was it one rugby guy
and then the other,

603
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,090
or just sort of a-a scrum?

604
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,620
Oh, drop it, Tom.

605
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,860
You know, I have shielded you

606
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,820
from some of the wilder
things that I've done,

607
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:31,040
like that time at the amusement park...

608
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:34,670
Little story I like to call
"'d' cups on the teacups."

609
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,250
Okay, I'm dropping it now.

610
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,190
Thank you.

611
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,290
Why are you getting so upset?

612
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:45,040
I mean, I thought you and Renee
loved to zing each other.

613
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,300
Those weren't zings.

614
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:49,910
When she made that... "aw,"

615
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,270
she meant it. I mean,
what the hell was that?

616
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,160
She doesn't get to be
disappointed in my life.

617
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:57,280
Well, maybe you should
tell her how you feel.

618
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:59,830
Yeah. You're right. You're right.

619
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:03,340
In fact, I am going to tell
her a lot more than that.

620
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:05,960
Good for you. But when you get back,

621
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:08,360
I'd like to revisit a
certain request I made

622
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:11,520
on my 40th birthday, which,
in light of recent revelations,

623
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,240
seems a lot more...

624
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:15,790
Okay.

625
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:23,410
What's this?

626
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:24,670
Yellow pages.

627
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,360
Hotel is under "h."

628
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:31,390
Yeah, I had a feeling I hit
a nerve this afternoon.

629
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:34,000
If you find my life that pathetic,

630
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:36,760
I'm going to spare you the
agony of observing it.

631
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,530
And by the way, taxi is under "t."

632
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:43,690
Lynette, I don't think
your life is pathetic.

633
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,350
Maybe not, but you clearly think

634
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:50,440
yours is a whole lot better.

635
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:54,840
So if you need me to say it,
I'll say it. You win.

636
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:57,890
You got the fabulous clothes,
the penthouse apartment,

637
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,390
and the rich husband.

638
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,650
Congratulations.

639
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,050
Doug is leaving me.

640
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:09,080
I found out he was cheating...

641
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:12,590
with his agent's assistant.

642
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:16,410
I confronted him,
told him it was her or me,

643
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,840
and he chose her.

644
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,720
I threw some things in a bag and took off.

645
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,990
I didn't have a plan.
I just needed to get out of there,

646
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:28,180
and I couldn't think
of anywhere else to go.

647
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:34,540
Why didn't you tell me this?

648
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,710
Lynette, my life is about to fall apart.

649
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:41,140
I haven't even admitted it to myself yet.

650
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:43,770
How could I tell you?

651
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:49,030
Well, of course you can stay
here as long as you want.

652
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,670
Thanks.

653
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,200
And to show my appreciation,

654
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,540
I would like to pay for
your first face-lift.

655
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:01,310
That is so generous.

656
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:03,590
Although now you've had nine,

657
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:05,410
you probably get the next one free.

658
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:13,030
Hey, Carlos. What can I...

659
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,980
I'll make this quick.
I'm gonna give you two options.

660
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,720
Option one... I sue this hospital for...

661
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:21,060
I don't know... $10 million, $20 million,

662
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:23,720
- and I think I'll get it.
- That would bankrupt us.

663
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:27,440
- Then you're probably gonna wanna
go for option two.
- Which is?

664
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:29,330
You make this whole thing go away...

665
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:31,440
Shred the documents, call off
the search for the other family,

666
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:34,800
and never, ever let Gaby
find out about this.

667
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:38,980
Carlos, we've sent out letters,
hired investigators.

668
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:42,210
I don't know if this
process can be stopped.

669
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:44,650
- Try!
- And even if it could,

670
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:46,540
this is a hell of a thing
you're taking about,

671
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,560
keeping this secret by yourself.

672
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,640
What's my choice?

673
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:56,900
If Gaby knew the truth, it will kill her.

674
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,330
No. I can't tell her.

675
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,760
- I can't tell him.
- Are you sure?

676
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:07,310
Doesn't he deserve to know
what Andrew did to his mother?

677
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,960
You have to understand...

678
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:12,360
Carlos is so happy right now.

679
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,870
Our marriage is the best it's ever been.

680
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,280
He loves his job.

681
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:19,710
The girls are turning out so beautifully.

682
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:25,930
Except for this one
easily ignorable blip...

683
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:29,320
Our life is perfect.

684
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:34,550
And I won't let anything change that.

685
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:40,020
Pork chops for dinner.

686
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,750
I know it was a bit of a splurge,

687
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:43,990
but I made up for it...
1-ply toilet paper.

688
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:48,260
Something wrong?

689
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:50,620
The bank turned down my loan application.

690
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,960
Without that money, I can't hire any help.

691
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:54,370
And without help,

692
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:57,160
it's just gonna be one
dinky job after another.

693
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,300
We'll never get outta here like that.

694
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:07,260
Okay. Well, we'll scrimp and save.

695
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,750
I won't buy pork chops anymore.
I'm gonna return these.

696
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:14,680
I'm thinking about taking a job in Alaska.

697
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,460
What?

698
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,090
A buddy told me about it...
six months on an oil rig.

699
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,810
One year at the most.

700
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,780
I could make triple what I can earn here.

701
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,890
You can probably move back in
the house before I'm even done.

702
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:29,020
Mike, that is really dangerous work.

703
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,430
M.J. needs you here. I need you here.

704
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,380
No, there's gotta be another way.

705
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,980
You think I wanna go?

706
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:38,720
We don't have any good options here.

707
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,110
Give me a month before
you make a decision.

708
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:47,830
I've just got a feeling that
this jewelry thing of mine

709
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:50,410
could start pulling in some serious money.

710
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:53,510
Sweetheart, you're talented,
but "serious money"?

711
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:55,860
You'd be surprised

712
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:58,410
what some people are willing to pay for.

713
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:06,960
No nudity, no sex,
and no one can ever know.

714
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,980
I am so glad I can help.

715
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:18,850
So what did you remove
this with... a puma?

716
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:20,760
I was anxious to get rid of it.

717
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:24,860
My soon-to-be ex-husband
picked out most of the decor,

718
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,050
and I realized I needed a fresh start.

719
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:29,970
You know, wallpaper's nice,
but it's a little...

720
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:32,820
Well, it's your house, not mine.

721
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:35,760
No, Keith, please. I hired you.
I wanna hear your ideas.

722
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,750
I would suggest that you paint this room

723
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,030
something, you know, bold.

724
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:43,710
Oh, I like the sound of that.

725
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,520
Perhaps a nice, deep beige.

726
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,110
Or... bolder.

727
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,890
I mean, with the size of
this room and the light,

728
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:52,230
you could go...

729
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,070
scarlet red.

730
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,140
Please don't take this the wrong way,

731
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:59,580
but I'm going to be serving
dinner in this room,

732
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:00,960
not sailors.

733
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,980
Could you excuse me for a moment?
I'll be right back.

734
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:15,460
Here you go...

735
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,700
The final division of assets.

736
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:21,020
Just need a Jill Hancock from you,
and we're all set.

737
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,150
Uh, before I forget,

738
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,990
Andrew's having a dinner
party on the 10th,

739
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,740
and he'd love for you to come.

740
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,250
Even though we're separating,

741
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:33,930
we both want you to feel that
you're still part of the family.

742
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:36,410
I'm touched. Thank you, Bree.

743
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,430
Orson, don't we have plans?

744
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,860
The wine tasting?

745
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:48,510
Why don't you wait for me in the van?

746
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,870
As you may have gleaned,

747
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:59,870
my relationship with Judy has... evolved.

748
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,150
Was it evolving while you
and I were still together?

749
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,900
No, no, of course not.

750
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,450
Apparently, she had feelings for me,

751
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:09,610
but she waited a
respectable amount of time

752
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:12,310
- before expressing them.
- It's been a week.

753
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,700
You know the expression
"the ink's not even dry"?

754
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,290
It's not dry!

755
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:22,080
We have separated, Bree.

756
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:25,560
And the two of us spent so
many years being miserable.

757
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:27,510
I just think at our age,

758
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:30,990
we can't let an opportunity
for happiness pass us by.

759
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:41,800
Forget the red.

760
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:44,020
I've got something here
called moonstruck yellow

761
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,850
that will kick your dining room's ass.

762
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,960
Come on. I promise. You'll love this.

763
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,300
With your red hair,
you will look so hot in this room.

764
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:57,130
But, you know, whatever you want.

765
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,950
Clearly you have other options.

766
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:04,330
Maybe I do.

767
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:13,830
There's my favorite realtor.
Thanks for coming over.

768
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:15,650
How are ya?

769
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:17,610
Bit of a pariah, thanks to you.

770
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,590
Don't tell me the neighbors
are blaming you for my return.

771
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:21,990
Of course they are.

772
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:24,370
You know, when you told me
that you didn't have any pets,

773
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:25,360
you could have mentioned

774
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:28,500
- it's because they don't allow
them in prison.
- Now, now, be nice.

775
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,710
- I'm about to throw more
business your way.
- Oh?

776
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:34,150
I hear that my old house
is back on the market.

777
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,570
I'd like to buy it.

778
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:39,160
Because of all the wonderful memories?

779
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:40,460
Just find out what they're asking.

780
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:42,330
Okay, but you just signed a
one-year lease on this place,

781
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:44,160
and you're buying
a house across the street.

782
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,010
Doesn't sound like a very good plan.

783
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:49,550
Oh, believe me. I've had
ten years to work on this plan.

784
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:51,470
It's a good one.

785
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,990
Bad news travels quickly,

786
00:40:56,150 --> 00:41:00,950
and when it arrives, we have
to find a way to deal with it.

787
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:06,750
If our husbands tell us
they've moved on...

788
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:11,150
we look for projects to distract us.

789
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:16,650
If the bills start to stack up...

790
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:20,220
we find ways to earn extra cash.

791
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:26,670
If we're told a secret
too terrible to share...

792
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,460
we learn to keep it to ourselves.

793
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:35,900
But we must remember the
bad news that's delivered

794
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:39,720
can sometimes be good news...

795
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,430
in disguise.

796
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,060
That the guy you were talkin' about?

797
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,530
The one that killed your sister?

798
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,210
It certainly is.

799
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:53,920
He looks like a killer.
It's a shame they let him out.

800
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:57,130
As it turns out, it's all for the best.

801
00:41:57,530 --> 00:42:01,040
Paul can now receive the
punishment he's entitled to.

802
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,140
What do you mean?

803
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,970
Just between us girls,

804
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:09,460
Paul Young will be dead within six months.

805
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:11,670
How you gonna make that happen?

806
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:14,100
You're in here at least two years.

807
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:18,090
True, but you see,

808
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:21,880
Paul Young doesn't have
friends on that street.

809
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:26,610
I do.

810
