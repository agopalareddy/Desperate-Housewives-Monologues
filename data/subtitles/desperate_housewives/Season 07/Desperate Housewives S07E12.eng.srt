<i>Previously on <b>"Desperate Housewives"...

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,880
The riot left victims in its wake.

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,239
- Do I need a transplant?
- You need to come to terms

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,669
with the reality of what's happened to you.

5
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,489
We'd like to know where exactly you were

6
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:13,579
when your husband was shot.

7
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,929
My wife is the one person
on that backstabbing street

8
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,909
- that I can trust.
- So what am I supposed to do,

9
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,379
- just pretend Grace doesn't exist?
- Yes!

10
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,419
Gaby's biological daughter was erased,

11
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,120
and she struggled to cope.

12
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:27,140
I slept with Tom.

13
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,670
And Lynette learned the truth.

14
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,080
Tom Scavo had a 20-year-old secret.

15
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,860
He had once slept with
his wife's best friend.

16
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,480
Tom felt it no longer mattered.

17
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,250
But his wife, who had just
learned this secret...

18
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,130
felt differently.

19
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,510
That's why she had decided to punish him...

20
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,960
and torture him...

21
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,630
and humiliate him.

22
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,320
Lynette planned to tell
her husband she knew.

23
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,220
But first, she was determined...

24
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,079
to have her revenge.

25
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,980
What are my keys doing on the floor?

26
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,359
Did my pants just... rip?

27
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,820
- Yeah. You might wanna go up and change.
- Wow.

28
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,970
Thank God I wasn't going commando.

29
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:42,550
I'm sorry you had to see that.

30
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:47,350
Is that a seam ripper?

31
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,770
Could be. I don't really sew.

32
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,140
Did you do something to Tom's pants?

33
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,320
Lynette.

34
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,719
It's just a thing I do

35
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,029
whenever I find out he slept
with one of my friends.

36
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,129
- Ugh! I knew
I shouldn't have told you about us.
- But you did.

37
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:09,299
So this is how you're getting back at him?

38
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,560
Isn't it a little immature?

39
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:15,039
My rage needs an outlet.
And you got to admit,

40
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,289
it beats smashing his head in with a 9-iron.

41
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:18,979
Well, there is another option.

42
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,870
- You could tell him you know
and deal with it.
- No.

43
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,020
- Well, why not?
- Because then he'll tell me he's sorry,

44
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:30,770
and I'll cry, and he'll cry,
and then I'll get over it.

45
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,750
And I'm not ready to get over it.

46
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,049
I have a lot of anger to work through

47
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,219
before we sweep this
under the carpet and move on,

48
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,350
so please don't tell him what I'm doing.

49
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,850
- But, Lynette, it...
- Come on.
It's not like anybody's getting hurt.

50
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:47,020
Ooh!

51
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,419
Tom! Are you okay?

52
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,520
Yeah. I slipped on something.

53
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,170
Peanut butter? How... What...

54
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,880
Those damn kids.

55
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,450
Yes, Lynette Scavo had developed
a taste for revenge.

56
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:09,310
And she was finding it delicious.

57
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:25,050
We pass by these people every day.

58
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:30,190
We sense their isolation...

59
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,940
but we just keep walking...

60
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:40,670
telling ourselves there's nothing
we can do to help...

61
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,429
which we know is a lie.

62
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:47,219
Hello, reverend. Wonderful sermon today.

63
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,959
Thank you, Bree. Do you have a moment?

64
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,989
- I need to talk to you about something.
- Sure.

65
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,969
One of our parishioners is going
through a personal crisis.

66
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:56,839
She's in desperate need of a friend...
someone to talk to.

67
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,059
And you thought of me? I'm flattered.

68
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,759
So you wouldn't mind reaching out
to this lost lamb?

69
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,109
Oh, you are the very milk of human kindness.

70
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,290
Now, stop. I'm happy to help.

71
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,459
Unless you're talking about
Beth Young, in which case

72
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,769
- I'd rather shave my head
and join the hare Krishnas.
- Bree!

73
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:20,589
I'm sorry, but she is married to
the biggest lunatic in Fairview.

74
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:22,259
He tried to destroy our neighborhood,

75
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,379
and she did nothing to stop him.

76
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,119
Still, the Christian thing
is to offer her solace.

77
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,169
After all,

78
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:31,279
"Let him who is without sin
cast the first stone."

79
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,300
John, chapter 8, verse 7.

80
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,249
What about,

81
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,949
"the righteous will be glad
when they are avenged,"

82
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:39,519
"when they bathe their feet
in the blood of the wicked"?

83
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,910
Psalm 56, verse 10.

84
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,979
"If you do not forgive others their sins,"

85
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,609
"your father will not forgive yours."

86
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,990
Matthew, chapter 6, verse 15.

87
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,269
"Whoever does not obey the laws of God"

88
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,739
"must surely be punished
by death or banishment."

89
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,430
Ezra, chapter 7, verse 26.

90
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:00,049
"Bree Van De Kamp is shacking up
with her boyfriend."

91
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:03,050
Cynthia Thomas, pew 5, seat 7.

92
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,079
Fine. I'll talk to her.

93
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,310
But this is spiritual blackmail!

94
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,020
I'm a man of God, Bree.

95
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,750
I do what it takes to get the job done.

96
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,430
Everything's delicious, Gaby.

97
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,069
Thank you. I'm glad you guys could come.

98
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,240
You know us. We never turn down
a champagne brunch.

99
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,679
- Who said anything about champagne?
- I did.

100
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,050
Come on, people! We need some bubbly!
We gotta celebrate!

101
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,440
Celebrate what?

102
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,580
- You...
- Okay, it's kind of a long story.

103
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,889
It all started last year.

104
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:42,589
We're adopting a child.
You were killing the moment.

105
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:45,640
Meet Liza Hunter-McDermott.

106
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,980
Liza?

107
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,180
Guess who lost that coin toss.

108
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,489
She's beautiful.

109
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,069
There was a 2-year wait for a baby.

110
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,399
But we found this orphanage
that had lots of older kids.

111
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,269
So we figured, why not? She's 10 years old.

112
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,330
And if all goes well, she's ours next month.

113
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,899
Well, we're really happy for you guys.

114
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,260
Aren't we, Gaby?

115
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,700
Gaby, what's wrong?

116
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:17,800
Uh, nothing. I'm thrilled for you. Really.

117
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,569
Oh, honey. We didn't even think...

118
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:21,970
- With everything you've been going through...
- She's fine.

119
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,360
It's just...

120
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:25,549
I don't even know where Grace is, or...

121
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:29,120
- how she is,
or when I'm gonna see her again.
- Gaby.

122
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,329
We didn't mean to upset you guys.

123
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:38,520
It's fine. She's gone,
and now Gaby and I are moving on.

124
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,459
And we've agreed not to talk about it

125
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,060
because it is so painful.

126
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,490
I'm sure you understand.

127
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:48,810
Of course.

128
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,119
So, please, tell us more
about your little girl.

129
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,359
- What is she like?
- Uh, you're gonna love her.

130
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,949
- I mean, she's so smart and so funny.
- The first time

131
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,639
we walked in that room,
there was this instant connection.

132
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,349
- We just knew she was ours.
- You know what?

133
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,710
We should make a toast to little Liza.

134
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,290
I'm gonna get that champagne.

135
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,270
Look who I found.

136
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,060
Julie!

137
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:47,289
What are you doing here?
I told you not to fly home.

138
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:50,030
Oh, mom. Haven't you learned
I don't listen to a word you say?

139
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:53,270
Besides, they won't let you
mail a major organ.

140
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,989
Oh, no. No, don't even think about it.

141
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:59,979
- You are not gonna be my donor.
- I did tons of research.

142
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,539
They have these new surgical techniques.

143
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,410
It's no worse than a belly piercing...

144
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:08,419
- Which I did not do.
- You know, the doctor did say

145
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,749
that blood relatives are
your best chance for a match.

146
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,069
Honey, you are not going
through the rest of your life

147
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,669
- with only one kidney.
- But, mom...

148
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:18,370
- No. I'm going on the wait list.
- That could take years.

149
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,410
You know, there is another option.

150
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,320
Somebody who's close to you
that loves you very much.

151
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:28,619
We've been through this.
You're not the right blood type.

152
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,380
I meant your mother.

153
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,960
My mother?

154
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,749
Mike, I already lost my kidney.
Now you want me to lose my mind?

155
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,919
No, no, no, no.

156
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,569
We are not asking her for a kidney.

157
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:43,620
No. In fact, we're not even
telling her about this.

158
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:45,389
We're not?

159
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:49,239
Of course not. Uh... if she heard
one word about this...

160
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,609
- Oh, my God. Julie, what did you do?
- I'm sorry. I...

161
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:55,420
You're hurt. I thought you'd want her
to know. And, uh...

162
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,269
- She'll be here tomorrow.
- Oh, my God!

163
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:01,339
I-I've gotta get out of here. Unhook me.

164
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,029
- Unhook me!
- No, no. Susan, this is good.

165
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,579
You need a kidney, she's got a kidney...

166
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:07,259
That I will be paying
for the rest of my life!

167
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,749
"How come you haven't visited?
I gave you my kidney."

168
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,729
"Why won't you friend me on Facebook?
I gave you my kidney."

169
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:16,580
No. This is a nightmare.
You owe me, Julie... big.

170
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,150
You're right.

171
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,200
How about I give you a kidney?

172
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,090
Bigger than that.

173
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,959
Don't react.

174
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,929
- Aah!
- Good not reacting.

175
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:42,009
What the hell are you doing back there?

176
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,679
I can't let her see me talking to you.

177
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,619
- Who?
- Lynette. She knows.

178
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,750
Knows what? A-about us?

179
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,539
- How?
- Who cares how?
The point is, she found out.

180
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:56,549
- Why hasn't she said anything to me?
- Oh, she's saying it...

181
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,929
Your pants splitting open,
falling down the stairs...

182
00:09:58,930 --> 00:09:59,879
Haven't you noticed you've

183
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,189
- been a little accident-prone lately?
- That was her?

184
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:05,829
- Mm.
- So she's responsible for my flat tire?

185
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:06,760
Mm-hmm.

186
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:09,390
- The sardines in my gym bag?
- Yep.

187
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:13,509
- The gay porn in my powerpoint presentation?
- Her proudest moment.

188
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,229
So she's just gonna keep
on screwing with me?

189
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,739
I mean, what else has she got planned?

190
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,049
I don't know, but she is one angry woman.

191
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,610
Be careful. God knows what she'll do next.

192
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,849
Ow! What the hell are you doing?

193
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:28,810
Testing the brakes before
I get on the highway.

194
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,759
Hi! I-I haven't seen you out in a while,

195
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,350
so I thought I'd stop by
and see how you were doing.

196
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,030
What do you really want?

197
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,170
Um...

198
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,339
Well, I talked to reverend Sykes yesterday,

199
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,289
and he tells me that
you've been going through

200
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:49,880
kind of a rough patch.

201
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:53,960
Come on in.

202
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:01,350
You know, growing up,
I didn't really have a lot of friends.

203
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:04,480
We weren't a very... social family.

204
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,780
But I was never hated.

205
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,650
Nobody hates you.

206
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:12,210
But they hate my husband... don't they?

207
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,049
I just wish people could understand him.

208
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:21,850
He is not a bad man. It's just,
his life has been so difficult.

209
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:24,579
He went to prison for
a murder he didn't commit.

210
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,760
His wife killed herself.

211
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,840
His son hates him.

212
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,420
He's been through a lot.

213
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,549
Well, I may not be able to
convince people to like Paul,

214
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:41,430
but there's no reason
you should suffer for what he's done.

215
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:43,609
I am having the girls over this week,

216
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:46,430
and I think it would be wonderful
if you'd join us.

217
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:47,850
Oh.

218
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,410
That's very sweet.

219
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:52,959
But I think we both know

220
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,800
those women aren't gonna want me there.

221
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:57,329
Those women are my dear friends.

222
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:59,120
Trust me. They'll be fine with it.

223
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,680
And if they're not?

224
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,420
Well, then I'll just have to
twist some very dear arms.

225
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:12,250
Okay, Mrs. Delfino. You're all hooked up.

226
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,089
Where's my daughter?

227
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:17,669
- They said she was down here.
Do you see her?
- Oh, God.

228
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,630
- Are you in pain?
- No, but I will be.

229
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,950
Oh! Susan.

230
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,630
Mom.

231
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,929
Oh, my poor, sick baby.

232
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:31,340
Hello, Mike. Oh, honey.

233
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,050
I have a surprise for you.

234
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,909
One of your favorite things from home.

235
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,270
Get in here!

236
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,600
Aunt Claire.

237
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,720
She figured I was cheaper than flowers.

238
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,799
Uh, Mike, you haven't met my aunt.

239
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,929
Uh, she taught me how to make
a Manhattan when I was 8.

240
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,839
I had her up to old fashioneds
by the time she was 12...

241
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,580
and that's a difficult drink.

242
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,950
She's like the bartender I never had.

243
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,919
Aw. So, sweetheart,

244
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,180
your mother tells me
you have a deformed kidney.

245
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,130
I told her not to sleep on her side.

246
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,330
Well, we're hoping to
find a donor very soon.

247
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,450
Oh. Wouldn't that be nice?

248
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,790
I wonder who it'll be.

249
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:24,059
You read all these stories...
strangers brought together

250
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,979
through life-threatening circumstances.

251
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:30,020
Our best bet is a match within the family.

252
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,600
Oh!

253
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,760
Like Julie!

254
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,520
No.

255
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,860
M. J.

256
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,629
He's 9, mom.

257
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,830
You don't take a kidney out of a 9-year-old.

258
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,369
Well, it'd take care of
that bed-wetting problem,

259
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:44,459
though, wouldn't it?

260
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,149
You know, we were actually thinking

261
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:50,540
that... you might be
a possible donor, Sophie.

262
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,210
Oh.

263
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,550
O-oh.

264
00:13:58,950 --> 00:13:59,950
"Oh"?

265
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,690
What do you mean, "oh"?

266
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,249
Well, it... it's... it's just...

267
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,580
it... it's...

268
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,260
I can't believe this.

269
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,339
She's not gonna do it.

270
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,210
Of course, she wants to.

271
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,539
It's... it's just the timing of things.

272
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:21,040
Morty and I are about to take a cruise...

273
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,770
for three months.

274
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,549
A cruise?

275
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:26,030
Nonrefundable.

276
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,340
And you won't even get tested.

277
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,049
You know, we haven't even
checked in at the hotel yet.

278
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:39,089
- Uh, why don't we do that?
- Yes, okay.

279
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:42,449
We'll be back in an hour or two.
And if you're better,

280
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:44,760
if you feel like it,
maybe we'll take you shopping.

281
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:48,249
Actually, I'm having my blood washed
for the next six hours.

282
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,780
But go! You two have fun.

283
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:03,069
♪ I've been workin' on the railroad ♪

284
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:06,690
♪ All the livelong day ♪

285
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:10,799
♪ I've been workin on the railroad ♪

286
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,030
♪ Just to pass the time away ♪

287
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:24,109
Hey there.

288
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:26,969
Oh! Perfect timing.

289
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:30,450
I made your favorite...
double fudge brownies.

290
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,209
Well, I had a big lunch,

291
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:36,529
and I don't want any more pants ripping,

292
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,789
so... no, thanks.

293
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:41,210
What are you talking about? You look great.

294
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,410
Have one. It won't kill ya.

295
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,880
Yeah. Maybe later.

296
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:59,240
Are you sure? They're tasty.

297
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:03,299
Ooh. Brownies. Can I have one?

298
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,820
Uh... no.

299
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,819
Yeah. Sure, Penny, have one.

300
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,839
No!

301
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,529
I mean... I don't want her
to spoil her dinner.

302
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:14,729
Besides, I made these for your dad.

303
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:16,140
Oh, I can share.

304
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,610
Here, Penny. Take it.

305
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,740
Eat it.

306
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:27,729
No!

307
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:28,720
Aha!

308
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,009
You guys are weird.

309
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:35,289
What'd you put in there...
cayenne pepper? Drain cleaner?

310
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:36,879
So Renee told you.

311
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,179
I am gonna kill her.

312
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,469
Let's get back to how
you're trying to kill me!

313
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:43,539
Don't you dare act like
the injured party here.

314
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,669
You betrayed me! You had an affair!

315
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:49,609
It wasn't an affair!
It was completely meaningless!

316
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:52,440
It was after we were engaged!

317
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,949
No, we had broken up, remember?

318
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:57,809
No, no, we were taking a break, remember?

319
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:59,649
Yes, we were fighting constantly,

320
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,889
so we decided to spend some time apart

321
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:04,759
to decide whether we were gonna
get married or split up.

322
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,059
- Right!
- So I went to my mom's house

323
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,659
to think about it,
and I will never forget this.

324
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:13,069
I was sitting in the kitchen.
My mom was making a frittata.

325
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:16,489
And I thought,
"oh, I should make that for Tom,"

326
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:20,270
and then it hit me. There might be no Tom.

327
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:24,910
I might never see you again.
And I had an epiphany.

328
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:28,390
I didn't want a life without you in it.

329
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,549
Yeah. I was at a crossroads,

330
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,429
and I chose the path that included you,

331
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,750
and you know what kills me?

332
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:39,059
While I was making that decision,

333
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:42,600
you were off...
sleeping with my best friend.

334
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,389
Ohh! That was fun. Mm-hmm.

335
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:51,960
I've been kind of down lately, and, well...

336
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:54,199
nothing like a little retail therapy.

337
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,849
Yes, I'd say you had a real breakthrough

338
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,470
around the fourth shoe store.

339
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,569
Please tell me Carlos isn't having an affair

340
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:03,300
with a tiny naked person.

341
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:09,610
Celia! Juanita!

342
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:14,800
Oh, my God! What the hell are you doing?!

343
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:17,740
Playing with my new doll.
Look, she can leap off cliffs.

344
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,679
No, no! This is not your doll!

345
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,689
Then whose is it? I found it in your closet.

346
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:26,240
Oh, my God. Where's her arm?
Where's her arm?!

347
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,280
Ohh. For God sakes.

348
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:33,540
Celia, this is not a toy!

349
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:34,679
Yeah, it is.

350
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,069
No! It's not! It's something
special that belongs to me!

351
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:40,990
It is mine, and no one
can take it away from me!

352
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:43,099
I'm sorry. I couldn't help overhearing.

353
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,830
Is everything okay in here?

354
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:48,119
Mommy's mad because we played with her doll.

355
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,040
Go to your room. Go! Both!

356
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,550
Your doll?

357
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,659
Of course it's not mine.

358
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:01,900
It's... a gift for Bob and Lee.

359
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:04,090
They're adopting a little girl.

360
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:11,369
Let me get your discharge papers,

361
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:13,560
- and I'll be back to wheel you out.
- Thank you.

362
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:17,619
Hey, uh, Mike's bringing
the car around front.

363
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,119
I will, uh, get your bag.

364
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,430
Hey, what is that on your arm?
Did you get a blood test?

365
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:27,199
- I just... wanted to see...
- I am not taking your kidney.

366
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,490
Relax. I wasn't a match.

367
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,040
But if I was and I didn't check,

368
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,670
I never would've forgiven myself.

369
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:36,770
Come here.

370
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,380
You know...

371
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,490
When you were growing up,

372
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:49,910
sometimes I felt like I was just winging it.

373
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,720
And then I see

374
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,609
the incredible woman you've become,

375
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:58,120
and I know I did something right.

376
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,489
Wh-where's my daughter? Did they move her?

377
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:05,040
I'm telling you,
it's the other end of the hall.

378
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:09,860
I'm here!

379
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:13,130
Ohh! Hello, sweetie.

380
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,399
What are you doing?

381
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,189
Well, you're getting discharged today,
and I came to help.

382
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,189
Let me take that bag.

383
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:21,429
No. I wouldn't want you to pull something

384
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:24,830
and not be able to play
shuffleboard on your cruise.

385
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:29,179
Well... how about I take us all out

386
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,379
for a nice lunch?

387
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,589
I can't. I'm on a restricted diet,

388
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,810
and M. J. is waiting for me at home.

389
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:37,010
I'd like to be there for my child.

390
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,690
Come on. Let's go.

391
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:43,679
Let me at least push your chair.

392
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,640
I'm good.

393
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:47,199
Susie, I want to help.

394
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,389
You do not get to "help"
by pushing my wheelchair.

395
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:50,809
You had your chance to help.

396
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:51,919
Susan, be fair.

397
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,880
No!

398
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:59,619
How could you refuse to even be tested?

399
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,330
My own mother!

400
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:03,909
Julie couldn't wait to hand
over one of her kidneys.

401
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:06,700
Well, there you go. Problem solved.

402
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:08,110
I wasn't a match.

403
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,920
That is not the point.

404
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:12,609
You only had a 15% chance of being a match.

405
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:14,729
That meant there was an 85% chance

406
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:17,289
that I'd never know
how little you cared about me.

407
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:19,239
I could've gone the rest of my life

408
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,939
thinking you were a wonderful mother

409
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,780
- who had the wrong kind of kidney.
- Now wait a second here...

410
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,870
No, no, no, no, Claire. It's okay.

411
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:33,510
I am... sorry I disappointed you, honey.

412
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,100
Hey.

413
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,339
Can we talk for a minute?

414
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,160
That depends. Are you alone?

415
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,019
- Yes.
- Then we can talk. You wanna come in?

416
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,429
- That depends. Do you have beer?
- Yes.

417
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,860
Then I'll come in.

418
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:09,700
I, uh, I need a favor.

419
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,860
I want you to let your mom off the hook.

420
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:18,600
No way. I'm... I'm done with her.

421
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:22,960
Susan, there are some...
things you don't know.

422
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:25,099
Like what?

423
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:28,219
What could you possibly tell me

424
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,239
that would excuse her behavior?

425
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,569
I'm her daughter. This is my hour of need,

426
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:36,049
and she's not even trying to help.

427
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:39,100
No. I'm not gonna forgive her
for this, ever.

428
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:42,610
She has cancer.

429
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:45,769
What?

430
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:47,020
Breast cancer.

431
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:51,590
They caught it early,
and... we'll see how it goes.

432
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,030
She's starting chemo next week.

433
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:58,139
Well, what about the cruise?

434
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,190
That is the cruise.

435
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,719
That's the story we're telling

436
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,760
because she didn't want you to know.

437
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,480
And that's why...

438
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,450
she can't give you a kidney.

439
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,529
Why wouldn't she tell me?
This doesn't make sense.

440
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:14,969
You know mom. I mean, since when

441
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:17,200
has she passed up a chance for attention?

442
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:21,249
Exactly. When she heard about
what you've been going through,

443
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:24,360
she... she decided no, not this time.

444
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,360
She wasn't gonna burden you.

445
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,480
And I jumped all over her.

446
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,349
I gotta go talk to her...

447
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:35,980
No, no. Don't tell her you know.

448
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,259
Why not?

449
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,640
Susan, please.

450
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,920
Respect what she's trying to do here.

451
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,490
She's trying to make up for
a lifetime of "me, me, me."

452
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:47,690
Let her.

453
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,659
Oh, dear. This is why people

454
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,869
should never let children play with dolls.

455
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,009
But don't worry.

456
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:01,089
I'll have Princess Valerie
all sewn up and good as new

457
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:04,700
- by the end of the day.
- Thank you so much.

458
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,610
Can I ask you something?

459
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:15,150
Of course.

460
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,140
Am I... weird for being
so attached to a doll?

461
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:22,199
I only bought her because
I thought she was beautiful,

462
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,120
and she reminded me of someone,

463
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:30,480
but lately... I'm starting
to feel like I need her.

464
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:34,599
She... calms me down when I get upset,

465
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,520
and I enjoy spending time with her.

466
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,489
The thought of leaving here without her

467
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:40,630
is really upsetting.

468
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,470
That's crazy, right?

469
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,160
Come with me.

470
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:53,410
You know, what you've been
feeling is absolutely normal.

471
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,160
Well, tell that to my friend Bree.

472
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:59,480
I was holding that doll,
and she looked at me like I was insane.

473
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:01,980
Most people will never understand,

474
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,490
but I do.

475
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,750
Let me introduce you to someone.

476
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:11,830
This is Mrs. Humphries.

477
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:15,479
I saw her in a window in a tiny shop in Ohio

478
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,879
and fell in love,

479
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,060
and the more time we spent together,

480
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,590
the more I got to know her story.

481
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:24,010
Her story?

482
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:27,359
Of course. Every doll has a story,

483
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,519
and it turns out Mrs. Humphries
started her own business,

484
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,890
just like I did.

485
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:36,360
She has a music shop, and she teaches piano.

486
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:40,240
And she... told you that?

487
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:43,510
Gaby, dolls don't talk.

488
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,490
But even so,

489
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:49,090
Mrs. Humphries is always there for me.

490
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,510
You see, her sister passed away
around the same time mine did.

491
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,380
Ever since...

492
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:02,690
she's brought me such happiness.

493
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:08,610
Isn't it... funny how a doll can do that?

494
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,440
And the best thing is,

495
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,460
they'll never leave you.

496
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:15,990
So...

497
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,980
what's your doll's story?

498
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:23,590
I don't know.

499
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,710
Oh, of course you do.

500
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:30,300
Tell me.

501
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:33,940
Uh...

502
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,930
Uh... her... name is Princess Valerie.

503
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:44,020
She's a princess.

504
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,570
But she wasn't always one.

505
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:48,850
Really?

506
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,689
When she was born, there was a mix-up,

507
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:54,900
and she was given to the wrong family.

508
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,980
Nobody knew for a long time.

509
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:04,960
But then one day,
she finally found her way home.

510
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,880
From that day on,

511
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:11,130
Princess Valerie never left the palace.

512
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:16,160
Her real mother kept her hidden away

513
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,780
so no one would take her.

514
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:23,790
And they were never separated...

515
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:25,400
ever again.

516
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:33,290
I know I'm not sleeping in here tonight.

517
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,050
Tonight?

518
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:37,320
Look...

519
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:42,980
I am unbelievably sorry about this.

520
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:47,760
I-I wanted to tell you so many times, but...

521
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:52,250
I-I could never find the right moment. It...

522
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,390
Really?

523
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,439
In 20 years of marriage,

524
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,669
there was never a lull in the conversation

525
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:02,010
for you to say,
"Hey, guess who I slept with"?

526
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:05,680
When would have been a good time?

527
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,619
The day I found out you were pregnant

528
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,380
with Porter and Preston?

529
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,969
Parker's 1st birthday party?

530
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:16,700
The morning that Penny took her first steps?

531
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:21,090
We have had...

532
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,339
such beautiful moments together.

533
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:27,130
I-I didn't wanna ruin a single one of them.

534
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,100
I hope you can forgive me for this.

535
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:45,290
It would be a shame...

536
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:51,109
a shame if some meaningless
encounter 20 years ago

537
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:55,810
ruined this wonderful life
that we have built together.

538
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,680
Susan.

539
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,200
I'm sorry I didn't call first.
You're not busy, are you?

540
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:27,580
I'm just packing.
Uh, my cab's gonna be here soon.

541
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,450
So... y-you have time to talk?

542
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:33,080
Sure.

543
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:38,800
I, um...

544
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,700
Well, I just...

545
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,910
wanted to apologize for yesterday.

546
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:47,230
Oh. No need.

547
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:51,079
This is... a horrible time for you,

548
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,359
and you've got so much on your mind.

549
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,909
It's... it's not that horrible,

550
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:57,880
and the doctors are very optimistic

551
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,880
that we're going to find a donor.

552
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,310
I'm not worried.

553
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:05,350
Oh. I'm so relieved.

554
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,459
You know what the one good thing

555
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:17,440
about having a health scare is?

556
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:20,430
No. What?

557
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:25,500
Makes you think about
what the important things are.

558
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,120
That's very true.

559
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,469
We all think that we're...
gonna be here forever,

560
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:40,219
that we have... all the time in the world

561
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:43,100
to say the important things, but we don't.

562
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,640
Why don't you and I ever tell
each other how we feel?

563
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:53,640
We don't need to.

564
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,820
We know how we feel.

565
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:58,430
Do we?

566
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,780
You're right.

567
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:11,600
You already know how much I love you.

568
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:14,390
And you already know

569
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,959
that anytime I accomplish anything,

570
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,989
you're the first person I wanna call,

571
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:22,090
'cause I love making you proud.

572
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:23,940
And you know that...

573
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,990
no matter how much you make me crazy...

574
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:34,159
part of me enjoys it because it reminds me

575
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,790
that nobody else has a mom like you.

576
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,090
Yeah.

577
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:43,070
I don't have to tell you that.

578
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:49,659
Just like I don't need to tell you

579
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:53,710
that my life began the day you were born.

580
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,530
And it's been such a happy one.

581
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:08,430
Aren't we lucky we already
know those things?

582
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:16,670
Yes?

583
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,280
Yes. I'll be right down.

584
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,690
It's my cab.

585
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,730
You go, and I, uh...

586
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:29,130
I'll call you later.

587
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:31,850
Okay.

588
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:38,490
You know, one of these days, I would...

589
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:41,390
I would like for us to take a little trip,

590
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,930
just the two of us.

591
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,729
Oh, I'd like that.

592
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,369
You know, we'll go someplace hot

593
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:51,359
and just lay out and drink some daiquiris.

594
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,280
Oh, we'll... absolutely do that.

595
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:59,830
Just as soon as I'm done with my cruise.

596
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,870
Yeah.

597
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,569
No offense, Penny, but soccer's boring.

598
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:15,200
Yeah, it's as boring as...

599
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,929
actually, there's nothing more boring.

600
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:18,340
You can tell us about it later.

601
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:21,119
But you have to go. It's a playoff game.

602
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,949
They're the best team in the league.
I need your support.

603
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:27,189
- Oh, who cares? You guys suck anyway.
- Yeah, they may suck,

604
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:30,129
- but they still would've beaten
Parker's team.
- Hey, Preston, uh,

605
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:31,729
how did the baseball team do senior year?

606
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:33,719
Shut up. At least I played.

607
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,229
Oh. That's true.

608
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:37,479
Remember that time he struck out five times?

609
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,749
By the third time,
the crowd started laughing.

610
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,389
Yeah, that was hilarious.

611
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:44,999
Your last at-bat,
the other team sat on their mitts.

612
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,600
- Oh, so embarrassing.
- Shameful.

613
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:51,560
Come on, you guys. Please?

614
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:54,019
I got stuff to do. Like what?

615
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:56,690
Stare in the mirror and wait
for the first mustache hair?

616
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:01,099
Relax, Penny. At least you won't

617
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,240
have to share your snacks
with us after the game.

618
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,950
Okay, fine. Don't go.

619
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:09,300
We're just messing with you.

620
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:11,090
We're going.

621
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,210
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

622
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:18,179
I'm even gonna drive you,
but I'm gonna warn you,

623
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:20,509
if you lose, you're walking home.

624
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,299
Oh, please.

625
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,260
Yeah. I'm not driving losers in my car.

626
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,480
Does that mean you're not taking Preston?

627
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,380
- Here you go, ladies.
- Wow.

628
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:36,289
Oh, Bree, that looks amazing.
Thank you so much

629
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:39,319
for putting this together.
It really feels like old times.

630
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,059
Well, you have been through so much,

631
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,639
and I wanted you to feel loved and embraced

632
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,690
by all the people in this room.

633
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:47,999
And while I'm on the topic
of embracing people,

634
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,740
I have invited our neighbor Beth to join us.
Cheese puff, anyone?

635
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,919
Beth Young?

636
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:58,059
- Married to Paul Young?
- The lady with the bad hair?

637
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:00,289
Oh, forget the hair!
Her husband caused the riot.

638
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:02,300
Which caused Susan a kidney.

639
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:05,280
Why would you do this, Bree?

640
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,249
I just felt sorry for her.
The poor woman has been shunned

641
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:09,689
by everyone in this neighborhood.

642
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,829
Because she's married to a monster.

643
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:13,229
So? Why should she have to suffer

644
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:15,060
for the sins of her husband?

645
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,990
Oh, crap. She's been talking to a priest.

646
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:22,080
Renee, help us out. Tell her she's crazy.

647
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,430
Uh, actually, I'm with Bree.

648
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:28,119
Please, you've never given Beth a chance,

649
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,549
and speaking as
the other new kid on the block,

650
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:33,039
you guys are like the mean, pretty girls

651
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,270
who won't let anyone sit
at your lunch table.

652
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:39,350
That is so unfair. Who invited her?

653
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:42,199
Okay, that's Beth.

654
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,600
Now, please, ladies, make an effort for me.

655
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,959
I'm actually excited.

656
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,180
I always wanted to be one
of the mean, pretty girls.

657
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,969
Yeah, I got a delivery for Van De Kamp.

658
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:58,360
Ooh, how lovely.

659
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,360
I don't see a card. Who are they from?

660
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,340
Uh, beats me.

661
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:05,239
Must be my boyfriend.

662
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,110
Would you mind setting them over there?
I'll go get a tip.

663
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:12,309
Is it her, or can I wipe
this fake smile off my face?

664
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:15,480
It's a deliveryman. Someone sent me flowers.

665
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,060
Was it the pope?

666
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,640
Here you go. Thank you.

667
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:26,450
Oh, good! You made it.

668
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:27,870
Hello.

669
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:30,290
Ladies, Beth's here!

670
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:34,469
You're sure this is okay?
It isn't gonna be awkward?

671
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:37,260
Of course not! The girls
are delighted you're here.

672
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:39,820
We are going to have a wonderful time.

673
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:51,649
That is a really good deal on potting soil.

674
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:52,610
Yes.

675
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:58,140
Well, again, I had a coupon.

676
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,770
That is fortunate.

677
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:16,379
- Maybe I should go...
- No, no, the evening
has just gotten started.

678
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,849
I'm gonna need some help in the kitchen...

679
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:20,430
you, you, you, and you. Now.

680
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:26,409
By the way,

681
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:29,359
I know somebody who can really
help you with that hair.

682
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,280
Renee!

683
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:36,309
What is wrong with you people?

684
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:39,009
You said you'd make an effort.
I am making an effort...

685
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:41,099
an effort not to tear out my deformed kidney

686
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,859
- and cram it down her throat.
- Yeah,

687
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,739
so Beth's feeling
a little lonely these days.

688
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:47,249
Why is it our responsibility
to make her feel loved?

689
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:48,939
Okay, look, I didn't wanna bring this up,

690
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,339
but let's talk about the last woman

691
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,699
who was married to Paul Young...

692
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:54,469
a woman who was in pain, and we ignored it.

693
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:58,030
Do we really want Beth
to end up like Mary Alice?

694
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:03,940
We're back.

695
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,019
We've decided to kick this party up a notch.

696
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,360
Oh. Lovely.

697
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,659
Yeah. Sit here. We'll pour you some vino.

698
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:13,649
Thank you.

699
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:15,799
Is red okay? Because we have white, too.

700
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:20,070
Uh, no, red is fine. What in the world?

701
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,920
Somebody lose a gun?

702
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:37,259
Oh, my God. What is that doing there?

703
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,220
Bree?

704
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:42,250
No, I keep all my weapons in a locker.
Let me see that.

705
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,840
It's a 38 caliber.

706
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:51,480
The police said... Paul was shot with a 38.

707
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:00,950
I think I finally understand
why you invited me over.

708
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,130
Meaning?

709
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:06,820
I'm just thinking how convenient it is...

710
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:09,489
a gun that may have been used to shoot Paul

711
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:10,479
was under my pillow?

712
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,290
A-and now has my fingerprints on it?

713
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:16,949
Hey, I was sitting there before you were,

714
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:18,459
and I didn't feel any gun.

715
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:20,639
Yeah, speaking of convenient...

716
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,329
You're alone in the room, we came back,

717
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:24,359
and suddenly there's
a gun under the cushion?

718
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,710
Where would I get a gun?

719
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,399
Oh, I don't know.

720
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,409
How about the one you pointed

721
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:31,609
- at me on Halloween night?
- You never told us that.

722
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:32,979
You mean the night you broke into my house

723
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:35,029
and tried to kill my husband with a club?

724
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:36,730
You never told us that, either.

725
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,780
I'm allowed to have a private life.

726
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:43,319
The point is, she owns
a gun just like the one

727
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:46,770
that magically appeared when
she was alone in the room.

728
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:55,020
You're all in on this.

729
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,610
You wanted to set me up.

730
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:00,719
I can't believe you would say to that to me

731
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,760
after I reached out to you.

732
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:05,900
Well, I think it's time
I did some reaching out of my own.

733
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:11,040
I'm calling the police.

734
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:26,010
We don't have to get up early tomorrow.

735
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:30,199
So I was thinking... maybe we could...

736
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,610
I still cannot believe
that I fell for Beth's act.

737
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,369
Or we could talk about this some more.

738
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:40,579
Well, she is just as twisted
as that husband of hers,

739
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:42,250
and I am a fool.

740
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,290
You're not a fool.

741
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,729
You're a kind and generous person.

742
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:48,160
That's what I love about you.

743
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:53,030
That and the fact that you can go from...

744
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:57,280
mad to passionate in a heartbeat.

745
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:03,360
I suppose you do deserve some loving...

746
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:05,569
Mmm. Mmm.

747
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:08,130
After those beautiful flowers you sent me.

748
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:14,830
At the risk of... going to bed frustrated...

749
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:18,680
I didn't send you any flowers.

750
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:22,860
You didn't? Then where did they come from?

751
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:32,500
We pass by these people every day,

752
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,770
but we never look at them.

753
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:40,990
We don't wanna see the sadness
in their expressions...

754
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:47,210
the longing in their hearts...

755
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:54,250
the loneliness in their eyes...

756
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,089
But there are times

757
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:02,870
we should stop and look
at these isolated people.

758
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,010
Why?

759
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:10,960
Well, if we look close enough...

760
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:14,750
we might just recognize them.
