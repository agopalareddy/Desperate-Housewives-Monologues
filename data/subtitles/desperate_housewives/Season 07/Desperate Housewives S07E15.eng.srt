1
00:00:01,631 --> 00:00:02,965
Previously on
Desperate Housewives...

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,733
Beth had no idea

3
00:00:04,768 --> 00:00:07,202
Paul was told the truth
about her mother.

4
00:00:07,237 --> 00:00:08,837
Felicia Tillman has gone

5
00:00:08,872 --> 00:00:10,673
to some extraordinary lengths
to cause you harm.

6
00:00:10,707 --> 00:00:13,776
In therapy,
Gaby confronted her past.

7
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:16,745
When I was a child,
my stepfather molested me.

8
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,815
Bree made a stunning revelation.

9
00:00:19,849 --> 00:00:22,351
He's your son.

10
00:00:22,385 --> 00:00:25,321
- And two fathers...
- He needs our help.

11
00:00:25,655 --> 00:00:28,789
Reached out to a son in trouble.

12
00:00:33,295 --> 00:00:37,512
Lynette Scavo had lost
a lot of sleep over the years.

13
00:00:37,832 --> 00:00:41,969
There had been
3:00 a.m. feedings...

14
00:00:42,003 --> 00:00:45,973
temperatures of 102...

15
00:00:46,007 --> 00:00:50,277
and late-night pillow fights.

16
00:00:50,312 --> 00:00:53,681
But Lynette had never complained

17
00:00:53,715 --> 00:00:56,317
- Because a mother...
- Mom?

18
00:00:56,351 --> 00:00:58,552
is always on call.

19
00:00:58,586 --> 00:01:00,821
Do we have any eggs?

20
00:01:00,855 --> 00:01:04,858
Yes. We have eggs.

21
00:01:04,893 --> 00:01:07,561
Where do we keep them?

22
00:01:09,931 --> 00:01:13,356
In the refrigerator.

23
00:01:13,434 --> 00:01:15,201
Cool. Thanks.

24
00:01:18,205 --> 00:01:20,006
How do you make an omelet?

25
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:23,910
You don't have to come down.

26
00:01:23,944 --> 00:01:25,356
Just, uh, tell us
where the stuff is.

27
00:01:25,357 --> 00:01:26,846
No, it's just easier
if I do it myself.

28
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,314
Two omelets, coming up.

29
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:32,500
Actually, um, could you make mine
an egg white scramble?

30
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,134
Girls. Hello.

31
00:01:34,168 --> 00:01:36,470
Mom, this is
Tiffany and Kimberly.

32
00:01:36,504 --> 00:01:39,180
We met them at a keg party,
wandering around looking for food.

33
00:01:39,277 --> 00:01:41,454
Somebody scarfed
all the chips and stuff.

34
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:45,053
And we were like,
wouldn't it be awesome

35
00:01:45,101 --> 00:01:47,053
to have Denver omelets right now?

36
00:01:47,085 --> 00:01:48,326
'Cause I'm from Denver.

37
00:01:48,348 --> 00:01:49,356
Really?

38
00:01:49,377 --> 00:01:52,652
I'm getting more
of a Vegas vibe. Sidebar.

39
00:01:55,437 --> 00:01:57,630
You woke me up to cater
your booty call?

40
00:01:57,678 --> 00:02:00,317
- Mom, this isn't a booty call.
- I think you mean a "hook-up."

41
00:02:00,349 --> 00:02:02,973
A booty call is, like,
when you're feeling horny,

42
00:02:03,005 --> 00:02:05,405
- and you pick up the phone and call...
- Okay. Got it. Look...

43
00:02:05,453 --> 00:02:07,821
This isn't a frat house.
This is our family home,

44
00:02:07,854 --> 00:02:11,083
and you can't bring your...
whatevers... here to seal the deal.

45
00:02:11,084 --> 00:02:12,652
Why not?
We've been doing it for months.

46
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:15,532
Mom, we're not kids anymore.

47
00:02:15,561 --> 00:02:17,997
Yeah, we're grown men,
old enough to vote.

48
00:02:18,029 --> 00:02:20,846
- Old enough to die for our country.
- Now where do we keep the eggs?

49
00:02:22,268 --> 00:02:24,700
Under the sink,
next to the fresh fruit.

50
00:02:24,721 --> 00:02:25,709
Thanks.

51
00:02:30,205 --> 00:02:35,357
Yes, Lynette Scavo had lost
a lot of sleep over the years.

52
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:39,021
And she was getting tired of it.

53
00:02:39,821 --> 00:02:48,121
Sync by YYeTs.net
www.addic7ed.com

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,202
There are all sorts
of ways to leave.

55
00:02:53,237 --> 00:02:55,771
Some people shake hands...

56
00:02:55,806 --> 00:02:59,642
others offer a gentle wave.

57
00:02:59,676 --> 00:03:04,580
A few like to give big hugs.

58
00:03:04,615 --> 00:03:07,483
Then there are those
who refuse to leave

59
00:03:07,518 --> 00:03:10,286
until someone else says...

60
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,787
"get out."

61
00:03:11,822 --> 00:03:13,089
Morning, boys.

62
00:03:15,592 --> 00:03:17,026
Why are you handing me
classified ads?

63
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,729
You have seven days
to find another place to live.

64
00:03:21,763 --> 00:03:24,118
Whoa, whoa.
You're kicking us out?

65
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,909
You said I could stay here
until I finished college.

66
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:28,052
Yeah, we're starting to think
that's not gonna happen.

67
00:03:28,085 --> 00:03:31,845
- Guys, please don't do this.
We like it here. - Of course you do.

68
00:03:31,865 --> 00:03:34,278
You think doing laundry
is throwing dirty clothes

69
00:03:34,325 --> 00:03:36,279
in the hamper and getting
clean ones out of the drawer.

70
00:03:36,311 --> 00:03:37,862
That's how dad does it.

71
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:39,974
O... okay, let's stay on topic.

72
00:03:39,994 --> 00:03:42,485
 Guys,you need to grow up,
learn to be independent,

73
00:03:42,549 --> 00:03:45,176
And that's gonna start
with you getting your own place.

74
00:03:45,241 --> 00:03:47,097
And how are we gonna pay for it?

75
00:03:47,161 --> 00:03:50,441
If you turn that paper over,
you'll find a whole section

76
00:03:50,473 --> 00:03:54,378
Of people willing to exchange money
for something called work!

77
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:56,834
- We have to get jobs?
- This is crazy.

78
00:03:56,896 --> 00:03:59,197
You guys are acting
like we stabbed you last night.

79
00:03:59,261 --> 00:04:00,590
Oh, obviously you didn't do that.

80
00:04:00,622 --> 00:04:02,012
You don't know
where the knives are.

81
00:04:02,924 --> 00:04:04,514
Now start making some calls.

82
00:04:12,548 --> 00:04:15,059
You really think
that they're ready?

83
00:04:15,091 --> 00:04:18,412
No. And that's why
we have to do this.

84
00:04:18,461 --> 00:04:20,349
Those boys are drifting
through life, tom.

85
00:04:20,381 --> 00:04:22,094
If we don't do something soon,

86
00:04:22,141 --> 00:04:25,293
we'll have twin 50-year-olds
living in the basement,

87
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,892
screaming upstairs for juice.

88
00:04:26,913 --> 00:04:30,286
You're right.
Unless we push 'em out of the nest,

89
00:04:30,317 --> 00:04:32,510
- They'll never learn to fly.
- Mm-hmm.

90
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,933
Do you have to dial a "1"
before the area code?

91
00:04:36,718 --> 00:04:39,230
And the first chick
lands with a thud.

92
00:04:43,901 --> 00:04:46,965
Yes. I've been on hold for,
like, 4 miles.

93
00:04:46,998 --> 00:04:49,525
I just got a notice
that my insurance

94
00:04:49,573 --> 00:04:51,701
is only covering partial payment
of my dialysis.

95
00:04:53,013 --> 00:04:55,414
No, that can't be right.

96
00:04:55,436 --> 00:04:58,372
I can't afford that, and I need
treatments three times a week.

97
00:04:58,392 --> 00:05:01,781
Ooh! Oh! Aah! Damn it!

98
00:05:01,813 --> 00:05:04,021
Oh, uh, not you.

99
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:06,581
I just ruined my shirt

100
00:05:06,603 --> 00:05:08,852
And saved a chipmunk's life
in the same move.

101
00:05:08,873 --> 00:05:10,757
This is not a good day.

102
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,133
Oh, crap!

103
00:05:22,202 --> 00:05:23,116
Morning, ma'am.

104
00:05:23,868 --> 00:05:25,886
Do you know why I pulled you over?

105
00:05:25,934 --> 00:05:28,236
To commend me for saving
that chipmunk's life?

106
00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:33,566
No. You didn't come to a complete stop
at that stop sign at Ferndale.

107
00:05:33,587 --> 00:05:35,517
License and registration, please?

108
00:05:36,429 --> 00:05:39,977
I'm sorry. I guess I was
just really distracted.

109
00:05:40,025 --> 00:05:42,346
I was trying to talk
to the insurance company,

110
00:05:42,364 --> 00:05:44,153
And then the coffee spilled,
and now...

111
00:05:44,174 --> 00:05:47,158
I'm gonna be late
for my dialysis appointment,

112
00:05:47,179 --> 00:05:48,742
which means that
all the good chairs will be taken

113
00:05:48,774 --> 00:05:50,822
and I will end up
in the chair by the bathroom,

114
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,684
and I will spend the next six hours
listening to people flush.

115
00:05:54,837 --> 00:05:57,636
Dialysis?
Man, that must be rough.

116
00:05:57,685 --> 00:06:02,228
Yeah, and it explains why I look a lot
more bloated than I do on my license.

117
00:06:04,837 --> 00:06:06,917
Look, I don't want you
to be late for your appointment.

118
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:10,053
- I'll let you off with a warning.
- Oh. Really?

119
00:06:10,074 --> 00:06:12,164
- Good luck, ma'am.
- Thank you.

120
00:06:14,588 --> 00:06:18,165
And thank you, dialysis.

121
00:06:19,829 --> 00:06:21,573
I don't wanna go
on this stupid trip.

122
00:06:21,588 --> 00:06:22,910
It's only 24 hours.

123
00:06:22,935 --> 00:06:26,044
Trust me. 24 hours in my hometown
feels like 2 years.

124
00:06:26,077 --> 00:06:28,557
Those people are...
are small-minded,

125
00:06:28,578 --> 00:06:30,332
They're bigoted, and their teeth...

126
00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:32,237
it's the land orthodontia forgot.

127
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:35,500
Well, it produced you,
so it can't be all bad.

128
00:06:35,508 --> 00:06:38,332
Ugh! Please. You know what
that town is famous for?

129
00:06:38,355 --> 00:06:41,293
The second-longest-burning
tire fire in america.

130
00:06:42,429 --> 00:06:44,509
Gaby, I think we both know
why you don't wanna go.

131
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:46,429
And it's not about the town.

132
00:06:51,646 --> 00:06:53,405
Okay, you're right.

133
00:06:53,425 --> 00:06:55,052
But I don't care
what my therapist says.

134
00:06:55,061 --> 00:06:57,820
I don't wanna fly to Texas
to stand on some dead guy's grave

135
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:58,877
and read him a letter.

136
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,925
That dead guy
was your stepfather,

137
00:07:00,933 --> 00:07:02,622
and he abused you.

138
00:07:04,062 --> 00:07:06,886
When Dr. Wyner told you
to write down how you felt,

139
00:07:06,906 --> 00:07:08,199
that helped, didn't it?

140
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,338
- I guess.- Well, then I really think
you should listen to her

141
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:14,233
when she says that reading it
at his grave will help.

142
00:07:14,266 --> 00:07:16,650
Confronting him
will give you closure.

143
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:20,557
He's dead. Can't I just confront him
from the comfort of my own home,

144
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,525
with a glass of wine
and a ouija board?

145
00:07:23,678 --> 00:07:25,280
If you absolutely
don't want to do this,

146
00:07:25,301 --> 00:07:26,545
you don't have to.

147
00:07:27,872 --> 00:07:30,801
But I really wish you would.

148
00:07:31,554 --> 00:07:36,385
Fine. 24 hours, one graveside rant,
and then we come home.

149
00:07:37,851 --> 00:07:39,722
Why are you bringing evening wear?

150
00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:42,810
It's the anniversary
of the tire fire.

151
00:07:42,841 --> 00:07:44,027
There's gonna be a party.

152
00:07:47,882 --> 00:07:49,088
We're almost there, Zach.

153
00:07:49,121 --> 00:07:50,673
These people are gonna
be able to help you.

154
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:53,956
I don't need to go to rehab.

155
00:07:54,004 --> 00:07:56,566
Tell that to the puke
on my shoes.

156
00:07:56,586 --> 00:08:01,477
- Thank god your mother never
saw you like this. - Easy, Paul.

157
00:08:01,497 --> 00:08:04,500
- You can't make me go.
- Zach, face it. You're going.

158
00:08:05,492 --> 00:08:07,349
Okay. I will.

159
00:08:07,372 --> 00:08:10,789
I promise. Tomorrow.
Just let me out now.

160
00:08:10,821 --> 00:08:13,235
- Let me out. Let go of me!
- I'm trying to help you.

161
00:08:13,267 --> 00:08:14,851
You? You?

162
00:08:14,882 --> 00:08:17,810
You did this to me.
You're the reason I'm like this.

163
00:08:17,832 --> 00:08:19,457
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

164
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,058
Paul, ignore him. He's sick.

165
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:22,033
I'm not sick!

166
00:08:22,051 --> 00:08:24,753
He's sick! I'm fine!

167
00:08:25,616 --> 00:08:27,185
- You're fine?!
- Ow.

168
00:08:27,205 --> 00:08:29,201
You shot me!
You shot your own father!

169
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,265
- Does that sound fine to you?!
- Paul!

170
00:08:31,272 --> 00:08:33,633
- Paul, let him go.
- You're going to rehab.

171
00:08:33,641 --> 00:08:36,753
You're gonna take these drugs
and flush 'em out of you,

172
00:08:36,762 --> 00:08:38,162
And then we're gonna talk,
or I swear

173
00:08:38,182 --> 00:08:40,373
I will drive your sorry ass
to prison myself!

174
00:08:40,403 --> 00:08:42,931
So you can either dry out in rehab

175
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,610
or take your chances in jail.

176
00:08:44,643 --> 00:08:46,771
I'm good either way!

177
00:08:58,339 --> 00:08:59,217
Let's go.

178
00:09:05,393 --> 00:09:09,109
Now with just the top...
tip of your fingers,

179
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:11,221
right there on the seam.
Right... yeah. There.

180
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:13,359
Then, when you throw the ball,
you whip your hand down, right?

181
00:09:13,392 --> 00:09:15,487
Gets the...
gets it spinning faster.

182
00:09:17,486 --> 00:09:19,646
Let's give it a shot.
Really whip those fingers.

183
00:09:22,591 --> 00:09:24,430
Take it easy!

184
00:09:26,158 --> 00:09:28,672
Charlie, it's time to go.

185
00:09:28,703 --> 00:09:31,646
No, mom, please.
Five more minutes!

186
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:34,594
Sorry, sweetie, we have to get back
to the hotel and start packing.

187
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:35,794
Hey, you heard your mom.

188
00:09:35,813 --> 00:09:37,569
I'll see you in the morning, okay?

189
00:09:37,616 --> 00:09:39,697
I just need to ice down this hand.

190
00:09:56,001 --> 00:09:58,497
I can't believe they're flying
back to Florida tomorrow.

191
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:02,568
I know. I wish you'd had a chance
to spend more time with him.

192
00:10:02,648 --> 00:10:04,423
Yeah, I wish that, too.

193
00:10:05,576 --> 00:10:08,199
Unfortunately, we lost a week
while you decided

194
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,104
whether or not to tell me
they were here.

195
00:10:10,128 --> 00:10:12,935
Yes. And again, I am so sorry.

196
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,376
That is my son.

197
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,570
How could you keep him from me?
What were you thinking?

198
00:10:19,618 --> 00:10:22,704
I'm not proud of what I did,
but I didn't want to lose you.

199
00:10:22,752 --> 00:10:24,289
Don't make it sound romantic.

200
00:10:24,308 --> 00:10:26,417
What you did was
unbelievably selfish.

201
00:10:27,826 --> 00:10:29,377
I know.

202
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:33,441
If this relationship is gonna
have any future at all,

203
00:10:33,463 --> 00:10:35,744
we have to at least
be honest with each other.

204
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:40,301
I feel terrible.
Just please don't be angry.

205
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:41,933
I am angry.

206
00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:47,050
But mostly at this...
at this crappy situation.

207
00:10:47,082 --> 00:10:51,050
I... you and me,
I'm sure that we'll get past this.

208
00:11:01,281 --> 00:11:03,382
Mom, this is taking forever.

209
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:05,927
"Tom and Jerry"
is on in ten minutes.

210
00:11:05,927 --> 00:11:07,319
I know, honey.

211
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:09,159
You promised we'd be home.

212
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:11,062
M.J., what do you want me to do?

213
00:11:11,081 --> 00:11:14,038
- I... I can't make these people disappear.
- You promised.

214
00:11:18,725 --> 00:11:23,301
Um, I forgot foil.
Will you go get me a roll?

215
00:11:24,053 --> 00:11:26,615
Excuse me.

216
00:11:26,634 --> 00:11:29,302
Uh, I know you're
all probably in a hurry,

217
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:31,653
but would you mind
if I went in front of you?

218
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:35,205
You see, I have
my dialysis appointment,

219
00:11:35,213 --> 00:11:37,670
and if I'm late,
I start to get a little weak.

220
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,158
You poor thing.

221
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:41,526
Bless you.

222
00:11:41,558 --> 00:11:44,245
My aunt is on dialysis.

223
00:11:44,267 --> 00:11:48,229
Well, my defective little kidney
and I thank you both.

224
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:56,262
All right! We're gonna get
to see "Tom and Jerry"!

225
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:00,758
Uh, Tom is my doctor.

226
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,358
Jerry is his nurse.

227
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:05,205
Then when I'm late, boy,
they really go at each other.

228
00:12:19,398 --> 00:12:21,265
So this is it.

229
00:12:22,321 --> 00:12:25,409
Yep. I was wrong.
It can be worse than I remembered.

230
00:12:25,441 --> 00:12:26,977
It's not that bad.

231
00:12:27,024 --> 00:12:29,730
Really? Because when
we asked the cabbie to turn left

232
00:12:29,751 --> 00:12:31,057
at the burned-out car, he said,

233
00:12:31,081 --> 00:12:32,513
"you're gonna have
to be a little more specific."

234
00:12:33,729 --> 00:12:37,169
Uh-oh. Get out a couple singles.

235
00:12:38,385 --> 00:12:40,737
You look lost.

236
00:12:40,769 --> 00:12:42,417
I take it you folks
aren't from around here.

237
00:12:42,444 --> 00:12:44,129
Yes and no. Mostly no.

238
00:12:44,148 --> 00:12:47,985
Wait a minute. You're not
Gabrielle Marquez, are you?

239
00:12:48,819 --> 00:12:50,129
Yes. Do I know you?

240
00:12:50,138 --> 00:12:53,072
No, but I know you.
From all those magazines.

241
00:12:53,092 --> 00:12:54,992
You're a supermodel!

242
00:12:55,001 --> 00:12:56,850
- Welcome back.
- Uh...

243
00:12:56,882 --> 00:12:58,833
well, thank you.

244
00:13:00,192 --> 00:13:02,673
Looks like the old place
hasn't changed a bit.

245
00:13:02,695 --> 00:13:05,985
Sound like someone hasn't seen
the new stoplight yet.

246
00:13:06,017 --> 00:13:09,281
Ahh. So, what brings you
back to town?

247
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,961
We should check in to the hotel.
Nice meeting you, lady.

248
00:13:18,993 --> 00:13:21,609
Hotel? I thought we were going
to the cemetery first.

249
00:13:21,629 --> 00:13:23,049
Well, it's been a long trip, Carlos.

250
00:13:23,057 --> 00:13:24,473
I just wanna lie down
for a few minutes.

251
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,857
So was the flight on time?

252
00:13:40,876 --> 00:13:44,409
Yeah. The one time I'm begging
for an 8-hour delay,

253
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,537
and they leave the gate
three minutes early.

254
00:13:46,544 --> 00:13:48,264
Oh, Keith.

255
00:13:54,985 --> 00:13:56,879
Three days ago, I didn't even
know that this kid existed,

256
00:13:56,898 --> 00:13:58,959
And now I don't know
how I'm gonna live without him.

257
00:13:58,991 --> 00:14:00,879
He's a wonderful little boy.

258
00:14:03,566 --> 00:14:05,406
Yeah. Yeah, he is.

259
00:14:06,366 --> 00:14:09,998
My whole childhood,
my dad was in the army.

260
00:14:10,007 --> 00:14:13,647
He'd be gone for six,
seven months at a clip,

261
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:15,807
And then back for two weeks
and gone again.

262
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,927
I always swore that I would
never do that to my kid.

263
00:14:20,947 --> 00:14:23,103
And guess what? Here I am.

264
00:14:23,122 --> 00:14:26,526
Keith, you are not your father.

265
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:28,990
I actually said to Charlie,

266
00:14:28,998 --> 00:14:30,895
"I'll see you before you know it."

267
00:14:30,902 --> 00:14:35,503
That's exactly what my old man
used to say to me.

268
00:14:35,511 --> 00:14:36,846
And you know what
it really meant?

269
00:14:36,854 --> 00:14:39,774
"I have no idea
when I'll see you."

270
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:47,104
I wish there was
something I could do.

271
00:14:47,123 --> 00:14:49,679
There's nothing anybody can do.

272
00:14:49,687 --> 00:14:50,848
It is what it is.

273
00:14:57,822 --> 00:15:00,054
Well, I think that's everything.

274
00:15:00,102 --> 00:15:01,863
We're really proud of you guys.

275
00:15:01,871 --> 00:15:04,209
Found your own apartment.
Did it all on your own.

276
00:15:04,241 --> 00:15:07,152
- You really stepped up.
- When can we see the new place?

277
00:15:07,217 --> 00:15:09,381
Well, give us a few days.
Let us get it all fixed up.

278
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,346
We should get going.

279
00:15:10,378 --> 00:15:12,426
Oh! Hold on, hold on.
This is a big moment.

280
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:14,250
- Our boys have grown up.
- I... uh...

281
00:15:14,269 --> 00:15:15,882
Let me just get one shot.

282
00:15:15,901 --> 00:15:19,402
Aw. I will treasure
this memory always.

283
00:15:19,423 --> 00:15:22,058
I love you. Drive safe. Oh!

284
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:27,594
- Okay. Call us when you get there.
- Yep. Bye. Bye.

285
00:15:30,506 --> 00:15:32,137
I know this is good for them,

286
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:35,795
- but I have to tell you,
I miss them already.- Oh!

287
00:15:40,723 --> 00:15:42,578
What the hell?

288
00:15:46,771 --> 00:15:50,019
Roy, come on out.
Our new tenants are here.

289
00:15:55,026 --> 00:15:56,034
What are you doing?

290
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:57,522
Deleting a memory.

291
00:16:03,085 --> 00:16:05,726
Yes. Well, I really want to.

292
00:16:05,758 --> 00:16:08,926
I just don't see how I can
with my dialysis schedule.

293
00:16:08,957 --> 00:16:10,973
Yes, dialysis.

294
00:16:11,869 --> 00:16:14,398
Really?

295
00:16:15,165 --> 00:16:18,429
Well, thank you so much.

296
00:16:19,677 --> 00:16:23,181
Jury duty... excused.
And that was over the phone.

297
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,821
I mean, they didn't even
get to see my sad head tilt

298
00:16:25,829 --> 00:16:27,181
with the trembling lower lip.

299
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:33,438
Susan... using your disease
to manipulate and deceive people?

300
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:36,126
I've never felt closer to you.

301
00:16:36,144 --> 00:16:39,565
Oh, you know what?
I deserve it.

302
00:16:39,585 --> 00:16:42,702
I mean, it's the only perk
to come out of this whole thing.

303
00:16:42,724 --> 00:16:46,158
This stupid disease
has totally changed my life.

304
00:16:46,188 --> 00:16:48,541
I spend six hours a day,
three times a week

305
00:16:48,573 --> 00:16:49,789
hooked up to a machine.

306
00:16:49,798 --> 00:16:52,846
So, you know, if I get to cut in a few lines,

307
00:16:52,866 --> 00:16:55,294
and get out of a ticket,
I'm doing it.

308
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:59,533
Ooh. Do you really wanna
use your powers for evil?

309
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:01,814
I'm listening.

310
00:17:01,861 --> 00:17:04,601
Let's go to lunch at Girard's.

311
00:17:04,632 --> 00:17:06,699
I've been dying
to try that place out,

312
00:17:06,719 --> 00:17:08,123
but they don't take reservations.

313
00:17:08,142 --> 00:17:10,144
And you have to wait
hours for a table.

314
00:17:10,768 --> 00:17:13,312
Well, not with me, you don't.

315
00:17:13,331 --> 00:17:16,128
I hope you don't take
this the wrong way, but...

316
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,535
bad kidney Susan...

317
00:17:17,555 --> 00:17:19,728
Way more fun
than 2-kidney Susan.

318
00:17:25,348 --> 00:17:26,766
You sure you wanna eat here?

319
00:17:26,797 --> 00:17:29,029
I think I just saw
two cockroaches throwing up.

320
00:17:29,077 --> 00:17:32,149
It's fine. Everyone in my family
used to come here.

321
00:17:32,168 --> 00:17:34,584
Didn't they all die young
of heart disease?

322
00:17:34,607 --> 00:17:35,849
Honey, you've seen this town.

323
00:17:35,867 --> 00:17:37,464
Would you really
wanna grow old here?

324
00:17:47,689 --> 00:17:50,697
Oh, my god.
It's Gabrielle Marquez.

325
00:17:50,729 --> 00:17:53,368
Finally! We were wondering

326
00:17:53,389 --> 00:17:55,417
if you were ever gonna
make it back home again.

327
00:17:56,841 --> 00:17:58,665
I am such a huge fan.

328
00:17:58,684 --> 00:18:02,217
I even have one of your swimsuit
covers on my bathroom wall.

329
00:18:02,236 --> 00:18:04,425
It's my thin-spiration.

330
00:18:05,945 --> 00:18:08,477
Uh, could you have your,
uh, chauffeur over here

331
00:18:08,495 --> 00:18:10,236
Take a picture of us?
Would you mind?

332
00:18:10,264 --> 00:18:12,413
Oh... be happy to, sir.

333
00:18:12,444 --> 00:18:13,900
Uh, okay.

334
00:18:15,213 --> 00:18:16,572
Can I get your autograph?

335
00:18:16,604 --> 00:18:17,981
My autograph?

336
00:18:18,045 --> 00:18:21,421
You know, we even have
a nacho platter named after you.

337
00:18:21,443 --> 00:18:23,468
It would be my honor
to bring you one.

338
00:18:23,493 --> 00:18:27,110
Sounds great, only make it
a scoop of cottage cheese

339
00:18:27,129 --> 00:18:28,246
with sliced tomatoes.

340
00:18:28,264 --> 00:18:31,349
Ms. Marquez? Principal Gomez.

341
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:33,124
I run the school
you used to attend.

342
00:18:33,143 --> 00:18:34,484
Welcome back to Las Colinas.

343
00:18:34,504 --> 00:18:37,125
You have no idea
how proud we are of you.

344
00:18:37,144 --> 00:18:40,576
- Seriously? - Yes, our young people
don't have any role models.

345
00:18:40,596 --> 00:18:42,465
No one else from here
has ever been famous...

346
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:45,105
I mean, for anything besides
getting stuck down a well.

347
00:18:45,136 --> 00:18:49,904
Ahh. I can't believe
all you people remembered me.

348
00:18:49,936 --> 00:18:53,297
- I had no idea. - You know,
it would do so much for school morale

349
00:18:53,315 --> 00:18:56,032
if you would come by tomorrow
and speak to the girls.

350
00:18:56,059 --> 00:18:58,288
Actually, we're kind of busy.

351
00:18:58,306 --> 00:19:00,208
I could call the press.

352
00:19:00,224 --> 00:19:03,616
But we're never too busy
to help girls in need.

353
00:19:03,639 --> 00:19:06,513
- How's noon?
- Gaby, our flight leaves at 10:00.

354
00:19:06,537 --> 00:19:07,792
Flights can be changed.

355
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,624
I'm sorry. My chauffeur
has no sense of community.

356
00:19:11,823 --> 00:19:14,640
Now... who else wants
to take a picture with me?

357
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:34,241
How did it go with Zach?

358
00:19:34,262 --> 00:19:36,558
- Did you get him checked in?
- It's done.

359
00:19:36,589 --> 00:19:39,144
Oh, you must be so relieved.

360
00:19:40,184 --> 00:19:41,436
I know I am.

361
00:19:41,483 --> 00:19:43,037
After the riot,

362
00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:45,372
when you talked about
us getting away...

363
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:47,868
I felt so hopeful.

364
00:19:47,889 --> 00:19:50,444
But then, I... it seemed like you...

365
00:19:50,466 --> 00:19:53,036
I don't know...

366
00:19:55,259 --> 00:19:56,509
pulled away?

367
00:19:58,846 --> 00:20:01,304
You've been so cold and distant.

368
00:20:01,324 --> 00:20:03,256
Not that I blame you.

369
00:20:03,275 --> 00:20:05,496
I can't imagine what
you've been through.

370
00:20:05,528 --> 00:20:07,319
No. You can't.

371
00:20:09,177 --> 00:20:11,495
But now we can put it behind us,

372
00:20:11,517 --> 00:20:14,360
get back to how we were.

373
00:20:14,387 --> 00:20:16,808
Start to build
our life together.

374
00:20:17,704 --> 00:20:23,865
I miss you. I miss...
being close to you.

375
00:20:28,695 --> 00:20:30,425
What is that?

376
00:20:32,328 --> 00:20:34,681
Your gun.

377
00:20:34,729 --> 00:20:36,664
I borrowed it.

378
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,448
But why did you feel
you needed a gun?

379
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,505
For protection.
My son tried to kill me.

380
00:20:44,536 --> 00:20:46,056
Fool me once.

381
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,092
What about you, Beth?

382
00:20:53,124 --> 00:20:54,388
Wh... what do you mean?

383
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:59,077
I was just wondering why my bride
needed to bring a gun into our home.

384
00:21:00,403 --> 00:21:03,978
You have to admit,
it's not very romantic.

385
00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:08,393
If the gun bothers you...

386
00:21:08,413 --> 00:21:11,674
we can get rid of it.

387
00:21:11,701 --> 00:21:15,385
I don't understand.
Are you upset with me?

388
00:21:15,417 --> 00:21:18,186
I... is that why
you've been acting this way?

389
00:21:18,192 --> 00:21:22,489
Paul, please talk to me.

390
00:21:22,521 --> 00:21:24,788
I have a lot on my mind.

391
00:21:25,637 --> 00:21:27,478
Of course you do.

392
00:21:27,509 --> 00:21:30,261
This whole thing
has been a nightmare.

393
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:33,476
But we've come through it.

394
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:36,837
And with Zach getting help...

395
00:21:38,565 --> 00:21:41,270
maybe things will be good now.

396
00:21:42,789 --> 00:21:43,814
Really?

397
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,092
When someone
so close betrays you,

398
00:21:47,124 --> 00:21:49,381
can things ever be good again?

399
00:22:02,388 --> 00:22:04,424
I thought of something
you could do for me.

400
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:08,027
Again? But we just...

401
00:22:08,028 --> 00:22:09,178
No, not that.

402
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:10,192
Oh.

403
00:22:11,859 --> 00:22:13,364
Remember yesterday,
when you said you wished

404
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:15,781
There was something
you could do

405
00:22:15,782 --> 00:22:17,872
About the whole
Charlie situation?

406
00:22:19,894 --> 00:22:20,989
Well, there is.

407
00:22:23,805 --> 00:22:25,617
Let's move to Florida.

408
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:30,754
What?

409
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,768
I've been thinking
about this for hours.

410
00:22:34,977 --> 00:22:37,912
With my job I can work anywhere.
You sold your business,

411
00:22:37,913 --> 00:22:40,182
your kids are grown.
What's keeping you here?

412
00:22:40,518 --> 00:22:43,037
Uh, my friends...

413
00:22:43,265 --> 00:22:46,805
I will build a guesthouse,

414
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:49,361
and they can stay all winter.

415
00:22:50,273 --> 00:22:53,108
Ah, well, it would be
an adventure.

416
00:22:53,109 --> 00:22:54,286
Totally.

417
00:22:54,744 --> 00:22:56,842
Come on. We'll pick oranges
and swim with dolphins

418
00:22:56,843 --> 00:23:00,479
And do all the other stuff
you do in Florida.

419
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,415
What do you say?

420
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,687
I think I can't.

421
00:23:12,813 --> 00:23:13,742
Why?

422
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,961
Because this is my home.

423
00:23:20,204 --> 00:23:21,151
I know.

424
00:23:26,763 --> 00:23:27,743
There's just...

425
00:23:29,094 --> 00:23:31,225
there's no other way for me
to be close to Charlie.

426
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:33,707
Unless...

427
00:23:34,017 --> 00:23:35,043
never mind.

428
00:23:35,478 --> 00:23:36,653
Unless what?

429
00:23:37,117 --> 00:23:38,183
Unless...

430
00:23:39,032 --> 00:23:41,418
I move there without you,
and I can't do that,

431
00:23:41,527 --> 00:23:45,507
because long-distance
relationships don't ever work,

432
00:23:45,709 --> 00:23:48,129
and I don't want to jeopardize
what you and I have.

433
00:23:51,157 --> 00:23:53,036
Well, maybe we should
talk about that.

434
00:23:53,037 --> 00:23:55,768
No, no, forget it.
Forget the whole thing.

435
00:23:58,647 --> 00:23:59,784
All right, I...

436
00:24:01,788 --> 00:24:03,437
I just keep waiting
for an answer to appear,

437
00:24:03,438 --> 00:24:05,052
and there just isn't one.

438
00:24:08,523 --> 00:24:09,775
Let's go back to sleep.

439
00:24:27,547 --> 00:24:29,701
Shh, shh, shh!
Local newspaper.

440
00:24:30,428 --> 00:24:32,389
So since I've left Las Colinas,

441
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:35,946
I've been everywhere...
Paris, Rome, New York...

442
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:38,637
But the place
I feel most at home?

443
00:24:39,933 --> 00:24:41,065
Probably New York.

444
00:24:42,094 --> 00:24:43,250
No, thank you.

445
00:24:44,236 --> 00:24:46,084
They're doing
a cover story on me...

446
00:24:46,398 --> 00:24:49,354
"Solis... so lovely."
Isn't that great?

447
00:24:49,806 --> 00:24:51,404
Uh, it is. It's just that

448
00:24:51,405 --> 00:24:53,913
I think you're starting to lose track
of why we came here.

449
00:24:54,245 --> 00:24:56,099
You still have some serious work to do.

450
00:24:56,172 --> 00:24:59,441
- When are we going to that cemetery?
- I don't think I need to.

451
00:25:00,548 --> 00:25:02,730
Then how are you
planning to get closure?

452
00:25:03,709 --> 00:25:06,514
It's already happening.
This trip has been amazing.

453
00:25:07,459 --> 00:25:08,526
Look, you have to understand,

454
00:25:08,527 --> 00:25:12,371
when I lived in this town before,
I felt like nothing.

455
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:16,034
So to come back and get
all this love from all these people...

456
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,756
that's healing for me.

457
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,820
I feel so much better.

458
00:25:21,439 --> 00:25:23,036
And I'm happy for you, Gaby.

459
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:25,003
I just don't know if it's enough.

460
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:28,820
It's enough for me, Carlos.

461
00:25:31,525 --> 00:25:33,602
Do you mind?
That's the radio station.

462
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:35,546
Hello?

463
00:25:36,109 --> 00:25:37,969
Yes, this is she.

464
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:39,979
Absolutely. I'm all set.

465
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:45,018
"Hi. This is Gabrielle Marquez Solis,

466
00:25:45,019 --> 00:25:49,967
And when I'm in Las Colinas,
I get my farm report from KYAP."

467
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:58,813
This is not leaving the nest.
This is more like nest-adjacent.

468
00:25:58,814 --> 00:26:02,389
I know, but Mrs. McCluskey
is a tough old broad.

469
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,933
If anyone can whip them
into shape, she can.

470
00:26:05,286 --> 00:26:06,717
Oh. I'll get it.

471
00:26:10,077 --> 00:26:12,950
- Hello.
- How do you make a Denver omelet?

472
00:26:12,951 --> 00:26:14,110
Why do you want to know?

473
00:26:14,111 --> 00:26:15,470
Because I made some
for the boys,

474
00:26:15,471 --> 00:26:18,482
And they didn't like them.
They said yours are better.

475
00:26:19,846 --> 00:26:22,682
You know what?
I'll be right over.

476
00:26:24,926 --> 00:26:26,230
And I'm like, "you shut up,"

477
00:26:26,231 --> 00:26:28,213
And he's like, "No, you shut up."

478
00:26:29,293 --> 00:26:31,290
So tell me, who shut up?

479
00:26:31,976 --> 00:26:33,326
- Hi.
- Hi.

480
00:26:33,327 --> 00:26:35,579
- Hi, mom.
- Hi, Preston's mom.

481
00:26:35,745 --> 00:26:38,423
- Hi.
- So what brings you here?

482
00:26:38,424 --> 00:26:40,889
Your mom came by to share
a few recipes with me.

483
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:41,995
Oh, good idea.

484
00:26:41,996 --> 00:26:44,544
We don't want a repeat
of last night's pork fiasco.

485
00:26:46,436 --> 00:26:47,535
Dryer's done.

486
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:50,817
- I'll leave your clothes at the foot
of your beds. - Whoa, whoa.

487
00:26:51,228 --> 00:26:53,697
What? Please don't tell me
you're doing their laundry.

488
00:26:53,698 --> 00:26:55,350
Oh, it's no bother.

489
00:26:55,521 --> 00:26:57,375
We love having the boys here,
don't we, Roy?

490
00:26:57,376 --> 00:27:00,745
Yeah. Aside from them
yelling out the answers

491
00:27:00,746 --> 00:27:03,625
To "Wheel of Fortune,"
it's been a real treat.

492
00:27:03,626 --> 00:27:05,988
But seriously, that's got to stop.

493
00:27:06,248 --> 00:27:08,864
The whole point of this
was to get them to grow up

494
00:27:08,865 --> 00:27:10,482
and take care of themselves.

495
00:27:10,483 --> 00:27:13,878
They just moved
from my boob to yours.

496
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:18,191
Nice breakfast talk, Lynette.

497
00:27:20,859 --> 00:27:23,357
They need to learn
to be responsible.

498
00:27:23,358 --> 00:27:25,278
This isn't good for them.

499
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,513
They're fine.

500
00:27:26,972 --> 00:27:29,885
Your sons are nice,
upstanding young men.

501
00:27:29,886 --> 00:27:32,372
Sure, for one night.
Give them time.

502
00:27:32,926 --> 00:27:34,408
Look, if they pull
any shenanigans,

503
00:27:34,409 --> 00:27:35,484
I'll give 'em the boot,

504
00:27:35,506 --> 00:27:39,022
but so far, they've been
the perfect tenants.

505
00:27:39,104 --> 00:27:39,895
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

506
00:27:39,896 --> 00:27:41,168
They had girls spend the night.

507
00:27:41,169 --> 00:27:43,752
You're okay with those two
walking around your house?

508
00:27:43,813 --> 00:27:46,552
Look, I don't care
what gets Roy's fire going

509
00:27:46,553 --> 00:27:49,094
as long as I'm the one
who puts it out.

510
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:57,361
Now, girls, if it were up to me,
I'd say avoid math and science.

511
00:27:57,362 --> 00:27:59,565
They cause serious frown lines.

512
00:27:59,618 --> 00:28:01,887
Gaby, please tell
the nice girls you're joking.

513
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:03,852
No. Young girls today

514
00:28:03,853 --> 00:28:06,463
need to know the dangers
of long division.

515
00:28:07,123 --> 00:28:10,534
Excuse me, girls.
Gaby, I have someone

516
00:28:10,535 --> 00:28:12,432
who I'm sure you'll want
to say hello to.

517
00:28:13,289 --> 00:28:14,644
Hello, Gabrielle.

518
00:28:15,064 --> 00:28:16,977
You must remember Sister Marta.

519
00:28:16,978 --> 00:28:19,118
She's been with us almost 30 years.

520
00:28:19,609 --> 00:28:20,786
A real treasure.

521
00:28:21,595 --> 00:28:22,654
Of course.

522
00:28:23,675 --> 00:28:25,301
Well, I'll let you two catch up.

523
00:28:26,617 --> 00:28:28,637
So, Gabrielle,

524
00:28:29,268 --> 00:28:30,652
What brings you back?

525
00:28:31,313 --> 00:28:34,180
I have some...
personal business.

526
00:28:35,801 --> 00:28:39,487
Well, it looks like you're...
enjoying yourself.

527
00:28:40,041 --> 00:28:41,668
I'm not surprised.

528
00:28:41,865 --> 00:28:45,286
You always did love
being the center of attention.

529
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:51,249
You didn't seem
too thrilled to see her.

530
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:53,445
Who is she?

531
00:28:57,117 --> 00:28:58,109
Gaby?

532
00:28:59,635 --> 00:29:00,935
I'll be right back.

533
00:29:04,394 --> 00:29:05,630
We need to talk.

534
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:08,413
All right.

535
00:29:09,642 --> 00:29:12,565
Do you remember a discussion
we had here 20 years ago?

536
00:29:13,916 --> 00:29:15,993
I've had a lot of students
over the years, Gabrielle.

537
00:29:15,994 --> 00:29:17,200
I can't remember everything.

538
00:29:17,201 --> 00:29:19,427
I think you remember
this conversation.

539
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:23,173
I told you what was
happening with my stepfather.

540
00:29:25,073 --> 00:29:26,094
Yes.

541
00:29:26,537 --> 00:29:30,433
You had a big imagination,
most likely from all of those

542
00:29:30,434 --> 00:29:34,461
trashy books and magazines
you used to sneak into class.

543
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,516
Oh, my god.
You still don't believe me.

544
00:29:40,055 --> 00:29:43,484
I came to you with a secret,
a horrible secret.

545
00:29:43,842 --> 00:29:46,646
I couldn't tell my mother
or anyone in my family.

546
00:29:48,456 --> 00:29:49,456
But I thought I could trust you,

547
00:29:49,457 --> 00:29:51,886
because you were
my teacher and a nun.

548
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:54,134
So I told you.

549
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:56,779
Do you remember
what you said to me?

550
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,449
I'm not going to stand here
and listen to this.

551
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:00,077
Yes, you are.

552
00:30:02,969 --> 00:30:04,981
You told me I was a liar

553
00:30:06,421 --> 00:30:08,266
and that I should be
ashamed of myself,

554
00:30:08,267 --> 00:30:10,612
and I have been
ashamed ever since!

555
00:30:10,817 --> 00:30:13,569
Is that why you came back here...
to blame me?

556
00:30:13,724 --> 00:30:18,559
No. I came back here because
my therapist had a crazy idea.

557
00:30:19,332 --> 00:30:21,687
She thought it would help
if I stood on the grave

558
00:30:21,688 --> 00:30:24,720
of the man who abused me
and told him how I felt.

559
00:30:26,651 --> 00:30:27,728
But you know what?

560
00:30:28,691 --> 00:30:30,719
I think I need to tell you.

561
00:30:32,648 --> 00:30:36,120
I did not deserve
what happened to me.

562
00:30:36,121 --> 00:30:37,486
I was a child.

563
00:30:39,968 --> 00:30:41,156
But you...

564
00:30:42,145 --> 00:30:44,693
you were a grown-up,
and you did nothing.

565
00:30:46,097 --> 00:30:48,580
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

566
00:30:58,441 --> 00:30:59,500
Everything okay?

567
00:31:00,601 --> 00:31:01,582
Yes.

568
00:31:02,921 --> 00:31:04,060
We can go home now.

569
00:31:12,761 --> 00:31:15,638
Hi. I brought you a little
housewarming present.

570
00:31:16,197 --> 00:31:17,202
Is it ticking?

571
00:31:17,203 --> 00:31:19,471
Look, I know I have been
hard on you guys,

572
00:31:19,472 --> 00:31:21,756
but you landed on your feet,
and this is just my way

573
00:31:21,757 --> 00:31:25,432
of saying, "have a blast."
You deserve it.

574
00:31:25,433 --> 00:31:26,203
You're kidding.

575
00:31:26,204 --> 00:31:29,984
Wow, a whole keg?
We can't drink that by ourselves.

576
00:31:30,428 --> 00:31:32,240
Well, maybe you should
have a party.

577
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:36,632
Yeah. It's a chance to show
everyone your new digs.

578
00:31:37,501 --> 00:31:38,615
Everyone.

579
00:31:41,292 --> 00:31:42,998
I can wait all day.

580
00:31:47,066 --> 00:31:51,222
Look, I already told you
I'm not going to the police.

581
00:31:51,433 --> 00:31:54,013
I just want to know.
Why did you shoot me?

582
00:31:58,029 --> 00:31:59,461
Because I wanted you to die.

583
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:03,022
Too vague?

584
00:32:03,938 --> 00:32:08,430
Okay. I'm gonna...
try to be more specific.

585
00:32:10,354 --> 00:32:12,133
All my life, I hated you.

586
00:32:12,277 --> 00:32:13,633
That is not true.

587
00:32:13,634 --> 00:32:17,151
It is true. That hate
was always a part of me,

588
00:32:17,523 --> 00:32:21,111
but it... it started
getting bigger, and then...

589
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:25,319
one day, I... I realized it was
the only thing that I was.

590
00:32:25,562 --> 00:32:27,801
That was the drugs
making you think that way.

591
00:32:27,802 --> 00:32:31,239
I know that you want
to believe that. No.

592
00:32:32,136 --> 00:32:34,230
That was you.
You did this to me.

593
00:32:34,379 --> 00:32:35,949
You do this to everyone.

594
00:32:37,609 --> 00:32:38,255
You're evil.

595
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:40,526
You have no idea what I am...

596
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:43,149
how I feel, what
I've been through.

597
00:32:44,081 --> 00:32:46,262
When your mother,
that horrible day...

598
00:32:46,263 --> 00:32:49,844
No, no, no. You don't get to use
that to explain who you are.

599
00:32:51,399 --> 00:32:53,726
You are the reason
mom killed herself.

600
00:32:53,727 --> 00:32:54,851
Don't say that!

601
00:32:56,227 --> 00:32:57,355
It isn't true.

602
00:32:59,855 --> 00:33:03,091
Wow. Dad, that
really hurt, didn't it?

603
00:33:05,307 --> 00:33:06,937
Maybe trying
to kill you was stupid,

604
00:33:07,091 --> 00:33:10,474
'cause you being alive, knowing
the truth... that's way better.

605
00:33:12,052 --> 00:33:13,511
Your mother loved me.

606
00:33:15,883 --> 00:33:18,129
No one could ever love you.

607
00:33:28,684 --> 00:33:31,881
Ow, ow, ow, ow,
ow, ow, ow, ow.

608
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,762
I'm returning these.
They're defective.

609
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:36,502
I saw what happened
to the front of your house.

610
00:33:36,503 --> 00:33:38,748
Boys, how could you?

611
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:41,445
Oh, that's nothing.
You should see the inside.

612
00:33:41,951 --> 00:33:44,263
They broke three
of my collectible shot glasses.

613
00:33:44,264 --> 00:33:47,260
I was this close
to having one from every state.

614
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:49,432
You think I want
to go back to Wyoming?

615
00:33:49,433 --> 00:33:52,420
What do you have to say
to Mrs. McCluskey?

616
00:33:54,455 --> 00:33:56,484
Can we get our
security deposit back?

617
00:33:56,671 --> 00:33:58,580
Ugh. Monsters.

618
00:34:03,223 --> 00:34:04,555
So what's for breakfast?

619
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:05,996
Nothing.

620
00:34:06,391 --> 00:34:08,588
- Fine. I'm going upstairs to crash.
- No.

621
00:34:08,589 --> 00:34:12,281
No. Once you are done cleaning up
over at Mrs. McCluskey's,

622
00:34:12,282 --> 00:34:14,400
you guys are hitting
the rental ads again.

623
00:34:14,401 --> 00:34:18,214
What? We just got evicted,
and we're really hung over.

624
00:34:18,537 --> 00:34:19,936
This is not a good time.

625
00:34:19,937 --> 00:34:22,344
I don't believe you guys.
You are fully grown men,

626
00:34:22,345 --> 00:34:24,212
and you can't do
anything for yourselves.

627
00:34:24,213 --> 00:34:26,515
You are just so helpless.

628
00:34:26,915 --> 00:34:29,032
Gee, I wonder
how we got that way?

629
00:34:30,774 --> 00:34:32,040
What's that supposed to mean?

630
00:34:32,041 --> 00:34:33,823
Every time we try
and do something,

631
00:34:33,824 --> 00:34:35,517
You say,
"it's easier if I do it myself."

632
00:34:35,518 --> 00:34:38,339
Yeah. We'd be happy to do stuff,
but you always take over.

633
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:41,128
It's like you don't want us
to do anything for ourselves.

634
00:34:47,475 --> 00:34:48,950
You know what?
You're right.

635
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,487
We are?

636
00:34:52,876 --> 00:34:54,315
I guess I just wanted you

637
00:34:54,316 --> 00:34:56,695
to stay kids
for as long as possible.

638
00:35:00,467 --> 00:35:02,458
Because I grew up with a crazy mom

639
00:35:02,459 --> 00:35:04,843
and two sisters to take care of,

640
00:35:04,844 --> 00:35:07,331
I was doing dishes and laundry
when I should have been out

641
00:35:07,332 --> 00:35:09,145
riding bikes and
throwing water balloons.

642
00:35:09,146 --> 00:35:10,506
I wanted...

643
00:35:11,972 --> 00:35:13,439
you to have a childhood...

644
00:35:14,844 --> 00:35:16,455
But I let it go on too long.

645
00:35:17,973 --> 00:35:19,163
So I'm sorry.

646
00:35:21,424 --> 00:35:22,713
This is my fault.

647
00:35:24,876 --> 00:35:25,959
But...

648
00:35:26,388 --> 00:35:30,840
it is time for you to go out
and start your own lives.

649
00:35:33,971 --> 00:35:34,970
Okay.

650
00:35:36,796 --> 00:35:37,777
Okay.

651
00:35:39,367 --> 00:35:41,852
But before we go,
can you make us an omelet?

652
00:35:45,708 --> 00:35:46,755
Yes.

653
00:35:48,209 --> 00:35:49,390
Actually, no.

654
00:35:51,481 --> 00:35:53,260
But I'll teach you to make one.

655
00:36:05,549 --> 00:36:06,722
Pretty impressive.

656
00:36:08,752 --> 00:36:10,829
You're thinking about
Charlie, aren't you?

657
00:36:12,584 --> 00:36:15,016
Maybe I need something
to get my mind off of him.

658
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:17,626
How about a movie?

659
00:36:17,627 --> 00:36:20,462
You shouldn't have
to get your mind off of him.

660
00:36:20,463 --> 00:36:21,707
He's your son.

661
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:28,635
That's why you need
to move to Florida.

662
00:36:29,046 --> 00:36:31,381
No. That was a bad idea.

663
00:36:31,382 --> 00:36:33,990
I already told you
I'm not going there without you.

664
00:36:34,071 --> 00:36:36,057
Long-distance relationships
don't ever work.

665
00:36:36,058 --> 00:36:37,195
That's true.

666
00:36:37,288 --> 00:36:41,222
Unfortunately, you're in one
right now with Charlie.

667
00:36:41,623 --> 00:36:44,034
Face it.
One of these relationships

668
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,977
Isn't going to make it,
and it has to be ours.

669
00:36:48,131 --> 00:36:50,035
Well, here's the only
problem with that.

670
00:36:51,485 --> 00:36:52,583
I love you.

671
00:36:53,129 --> 00:36:54,511
I love you, too.

672
00:36:55,299 --> 00:36:56,247
Good.

673
00:36:56,832 --> 00:36:58,895
Then you know
why I won't leave.

674
00:36:59,275 --> 00:37:00,607
Here's what I know.

675
00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:03,763
From the first day we met,
I have been pretending

676
00:37:03,764 --> 00:37:06,021
that our age difference
doesn't mean anything.

677
00:37:06,022 --> 00:37:08,271
- Because it doesn't.
- It does.

678
00:37:08,272 --> 00:37:10,343
It means I have lived through
more of life than you,

679
00:37:10,344 --> 00:37:12,559
including having children,
which is something

680
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,851
- you desperately wanted and
now you have. - Bree, come on.

681
00:37:16,852 --> 00:37:18,755
And while I have
fallen in and out of love

682
00:37:18,756 --> 00:37:20,682
with several men in my life,

683
00:37:21,691 --> 00:37:24,527
I have never fallen out
of love with my children.

684
00:37:26,748 --> 00:37:30,214
And you may think that you will
never love another woman

685
00:37:30,571 --> 00:37:31,942
like you love me,

686
00:37:34,369 --> 00:37:35,885
but I know that you will.

687
00:37:43,485 --> 00:37:45,419
I don't see how that's possible.

688
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,539
That's because you're young.

689
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,534
You have given me
so much, Keith.

690
00:37:56,009 --> 00:37:57,014
Please...

691
00:37:58,458 --> 00:37:59,920
let me give this to you.

692
00:38:09,517 --> 00:38:11,574
Hi there.
We'd like a table, please.

693
00:38:11,575 --> 00:38:13,972
I'm sorry. You're looking
at a 2-hour wait.

694
00:38:14,487 --> 00:38:15,493
Susan?

695
00:38:16,993 --> 00:38:19,945
Um, do you think that
you could squeeze us in?

696
00:38:19,946 --> 00:38:23,999
Because I have a dialysis
appointment in an hour.

697
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,374
Oh. Um, it's just...
we're so slammed.

698
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:30,353
Just like my kidney.

699
00:38:31,944 --> 00:38:33,301
Let me see what I can do.

700
00:38:33,427 --> 00:38:35,856
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on there.

701
00:38:36,508 --> 00:38:38,285
Why is she getting
a table before us?

702
00:38:38,286 --> 00:38:39,886
We've been waiting 45 minutes.

703
00:38:39,887 --> 00:38:42,522
Sir, she's lost
both of her kidneys.

704
00:38:42,751 --> 00:38:43,857
A booth would be great.

705
00:38:43,858 --> 00:38:47,149
Well, I'm a diabetic, and
my wife has rheumatoid arthritis.

706
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:49,150
You don't see us trying
to get any special treatment.

707
00:38:49,151 --> 00:38:52,373
You don't understand.
I'm on dialysis.

708
00:38:52,648 --> 00:38:56,332
Arthritis... diabetes...
dialysis, so...

709
00:38:56,753 --> 00:38:59,220
Unless somebody here has ebola,

710
00:38:59,419 --> 00:39:01,213
I think we should get
the next table.

711
00:39:01,521 --> 00:39:03,365
You think there isn't
anybody in this place

712
00:39:03,366 --> 00:39:07,483
who doesn't have something?
We all have something.

713
00:39:07,833 --> 00:39:10,222
I have restless leg syndrome.

714
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:11,412
Shut up.

715
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,768
The only thing special about you

716
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:18,026
Is you think you're more special
than the rest of us. You're not.

717
00:39:18,338 --> 00:39:21,347
Now get to the back of the line.

718
00:39:23,102 --> 00:39:24,329
You, too, sister.

719
00:39:26,222 --> 00:39:28,342
She used to be married
to a Yankee.

720
00:39:30,613 --> 00:39:31,675
Nothing?

721
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:33,724
Okay.

722
00:39:36,334 --> 00:39:38,402
I hope you know
this means you're paying.

723
00:39:39,516 --> 00:39:41,569
I got to sit down.
I... I don't feel well.

724
00:39:43,733 --> 00:39:45,793
Nice try.
We're not getting a table.

725
00:39:46,548 --> 00:39:47,479
Really.

726
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,600
I... I don't feel well.

727
00:39:53,165 --> 00:39:55,872
Oh, Susan, get up.
No one's even looking.

728
00:39:58,861 --> 00:39:59,864
Susan?

729
00:40:02,077 --> 00:40:03,202
Susan!

730
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,384
Oh, my god.

731
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:08,531
Someone call 9-1-1!

732
00:40:30,299 --> 00:40:31,537
Are you going away?

733
00:40:31,997 --> 00:40:32,929
No.

734
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,818
You are.

735
00:40:39,518 --> 00:40:40,325
Paul! Come on!

736
00:40:40,326 --> 00:40:41,996
Stop! What are you doing?

737
00:40:41,997 --> 00:40:45,090
- I want you out. You hear me?
- Why? What have I done?

738
00:40:45,502 --> 00:40:46,657
I know.

739
00:40:47,973 --> 00:40:48,968
What?

740
00:40:49,895 --> 00:40:51,652
I know who you are.

741
00:40:55,806 --> 00:40:58,068
Paul, please, listen to me...

742
00:40:58,069 --> 00:41:02,526
At least Felicia had the guts
to hate me to my face. You hid it.

743
00:41:02,527 --> 00:41:04,946
I don't hate you. I don't.

744
00:41:05,528 --> 00:41:09,681
- Get out, you lying bitch.
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Okay. Yes.

745
00:41:10,017 --> 00:41:11,704
I did lie at first,

746
00:41:11,705 --> 00:41:14,031
and, yes, I hated you,
because she told me to.

747
00:41:14,032 --> 00:41:14,972
Get out!

748
00:41:15,104 --> 00:41:16,752
But that changed.
You changed me.

749
00:41:16,753 --> 00:41:18,305
I don't care what
she says anymore.

750
00:41:18,306 --> 00:41:21,406
Please, Paul. Forgive me, please.

751
00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:24,562
I love you.
I swear to god, I love you!

752
00:41:27,003 --> 00:41:30,401
No, you don't.
No one could ever love me.

753
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:35,392
Don't forget your gun.

754
00:41:47,697 --> 00:41:50,101
Leaving is never easy,

755
00:41:50,632 --> 00:41:53,874
but the time comes
when we must move on...

756
00:41:56,577 --> 00:41:59,646
so we can leave
our childhood behind...

757
00:42:02,841 --> 00:42:05,565
so we can let go of the past...

758
00:42:09,025 --> 00:42:12,093
so we can be a good parent.

759
00:42:15,729 --> 00:42:19,358
Yes, leaving is never easy,

760
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:25,816
especially for those
who have nowhere else to go.

761
