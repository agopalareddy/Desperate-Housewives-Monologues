1
00:00:00,686 --> 00:00:02,645
<i>Previously on...</i>

2
00:00:02,646 --> 00:00:05,551
We are going to do everything
we can to get you a kidney.

3
00:00:05,552 --> 00:00:07,538
In the meantime, live your life.
If there's things

4
00:00:07,539 --> 00:00:10,401
you're thinking about doing, do them now.

5
00:00:10,757 --> 00:00:13,105
<i>Susan's condition got worse.</i>

6
00:00:13,106 --> 00:00:16,257
You're dying, and there's not a
damn thing I can do about it.

7
00:00:17,133 --> 00:00:19,638
<i>Beth was rejected by her husband...</i>

8
00:00:19,639 --> 00:00:21,497
I kicked you out of this house.

9
00:00:21,498 --> 00:00:22,889
That was the end!

10
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,704
<i>And abandoned by her mother.</i>

11
00:00:24,705 --> 00:00:28,658
I have no more use for you. Good-bye.

12
00:00:30,066 --> 00:00:32,257
<i>But Bree brought hope.</i>

13
00:00:32,455 --> 00:00:34,744
Has the transplant office reached you?

14
00:00:34,745 --> 00:00:35,849
Am I a match?

15
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,561
- Uh, yes.
- I'm here to donate a kidney.

16
00:00:38,562 --> 00:00:40,922
It's the most important
thing I've ever done.

17
00:00:40,923 --> 00:00:44,362
<i>And Beth made the ultimate sacrifice.</i>

18
00:00:45,622 --> 00:00:47,111
We need some help over here!

19
00:00:55,782 --> 00:00:57,345
<i>We can never know</i>

20
00:00:57,346 --> 00:01:01,282
<i>the moment our lives are
about to change forever.</i>

21
00:01:03,046 --> 00:01:05,270
<i>We might be preparing dinner...</i>

22
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:09,973
<i>coming home after a long day...</i>

23
00:01:11,681 --> 00:01:14,130
<i>enjoying a glass of wine...</i>

24
00:01:16,251 --> 00:01:18,825
<i>tending to our aches and pains.</i>

25
00:01:20,178 --> 00:01:21,602
<i>And then...</i>

26
00:01:22,054 --> 00:01:24,357
<i>when we least expect it...</i>

27
00:01:25,363 --> 00:01:27,170
<i>the moment comes.</i>

28
00:01:32,282 --> 00:01:33,222
Hello?

29
00:01:33,223 --> 00:01:33,949
Susan?

30
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,270
This is Craig Lynwood
from Fairview Memorial.

31
00:01:36,522 --> 00:01:38,096
- Hello?
- Mr. Young,

32
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:40,338
this is Dr. Jenkins from Fairview Memorial.

33
00:01:40,828 --> 00:01:42,318
We have a kidney for you.

34
00:01:43,295 --> 00:01:44,353
What?

35
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:47,090
I'm sorry to tell you there's
been a terrible accident.

36
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:48,917
What kind of accident?

37
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,640
Your wife... shot herself.

38
00:01:51,641 --> 00:01:56,057
Oh, my god. Oh, my god!
Mike! We have a kidney!

39
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:57,778
Is she dead?

40
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,145
We're keeping her on life support,

41
00:01:59,146 --> 00:02:01,601
but I'm afraid there's no brain activity.

42
00:02:01,602 --> 00:02:04,606
So... how soon can we do this?

43
00:02:04,607 --> 00:02:06,253
How soon can you get here?

44
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:07,721
I don't understand.

45
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:11,011
If there's no brain function,
why is she on life support?

46
00:02:11,029 --> 00:02:13,617
Your wife is an organ donor,
and we need to...

47
00:02:13,618 --> 00:02:14,834
Stop.

48
00:02:16,366 --> 00:02:18,324
You are not to touch her until I get there.

49
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:24,591
<i>Yes, there are moments that
change our lives forever...</i>

50
00:02:26,037 --> 00:02:28,102
<i>but not always in the way...</i>

51
00:02:29,044 --> 00:02:30,853
<i>we might expect.</i>

52
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:47,810
<i>The women of Wisteria Lane</i>

53
00:02:47,811 --> 00:02:50,706
<i>look for any excuse to celebrate...</i>

54
00:02:51,674 --> 00:02:53,481
<i>A bottle of champagne</i>

55
00:02:53,653 --> 00:02:55,623
<i>when you're not expecting...</i>

56
00:02:57,822 --> 00:03:00,895
<i>A new dress, for turning 39...</i>

57
00:03:01,171 --> 00:03:02,387
<i>again...</i>

58
00:03:03,422 --> 00:03:07,742
<i>A triple fudge cake
to reward a personal best.</i>

59
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:12,238
<i>So when my friends heard
about Susan's good fortune,</i>

60
00:03:13,137 --> 00:03:15,155
<i>they just couldn't resist.</i>

61
00:03:15,343 --> 00:03:16,910
Surprise!

62
00:03:18,837 --> 00:03:21,413
What? What are you supposed
to say when someone gets an organ?

63
00:03:22,721 --> 00:03:24,161
Kidney!

64
00:03:24,774 --> 00:03:26,505
How about "Congratulations"?

65
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:29,481
We are so thrilled for you.
When is this happening?

66
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,970
I guess tonight.

67
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,153
So will you still be at my party saturday?

68
00:03:34,154 --> 00:03:37,313
- Because you did R.S.V.P.
- Well, it depends.

69
00:03:37,314 --> 00:03:39,474
Can you move the party into
the intensive care unit?

70
00:03:40,195 --> 00:03:43,602
So that's a no.
Gaby's in charge of the guest list,

71
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:46,746
in case anybody else decides
to flake at the last minute.

72
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,370
Hello, Susan.

73
00:03:48,681 --> 00:03:50,855
Well, I didn't know you'd
be bringing an entourage.

74
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:52,776
Well, it's a happy day on our street.

75
00:03:52,869 --> 00:03:55,081
I would imagine, a bit of a sad one, too.

76
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,569
No, I can just call the caterers,

77
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,937
say there's one less person. No big deal.

78
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,913
Isn't that a little harsh?
I mean, she was a neighbor.

79
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:06,114
- Who are you talking about?
- Your donor, Beth Young.

80
00:04:08,842 --> 00:04:10,393
Beth is her donor?

81
00:04:11,005 --> 00:04:14,462
Wait, you... you don't know any of this?

82
00:04:16,682 --> 00:04:19,604
Beth came to the E.R.
with the transplant papers,

83
00:04:19,605 --> 00:04:22,550
and then... she shot herself.

84
00:04:27,325 --> 00:04:28,718
Is she dead?

85
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:31,978
She's on life support,
but she's not gonna make it.

86
00:04:32,065 --> 00:04:35,650
- Oh, my god.
- I'm so sorry. I-I thought you knew.

87
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:37,625
Her husband is with her now.

88
00:04:37,626 --> 00:04:39,537
We want to give him some more time with her,

89
00:04:39,538 --> 00:04:42,579
so we're anticipating a bit of a delay.

90
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,166
Oh, poor Beth.

91
00:04:50,014 --> 00:04:51,998
I just saw her yesterday.

92
00:04:52,405 --> 00:04:53,472
I mean, she seemed off,

93
00:04:53,473 --> 00:04:56,386
but she always seemed
a little off, so I left.

94
00:04:56,962 --> 00:04:59,841
How could I not have realized
she was in so much pain?

95
00:05:01,162 --> 00:05:03,994
Oh, Bree, you couldn't have
known this would happen.

96
00:05:06,749 --> 00:05:08,110
Are you okay?

97
00:05:09,954 --> 00:05:11,074
I don't know.

98
00:05:13,578 --> 00:05:16,937
It sounds like nothing's
gonna happen tonight.

99
00:05:17,206 --> 00:05:20,421
Why don't you just all go
home and get some sleep?

100
00:05:29,877 --> 00:05:30,782
Hello?

101
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,748
It's Karen.

102
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:34,522
Get your ass over here.
I got something that belongs to you.

103
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:36,518
Little hint...

104
00:05:36,546 --> 00:05:39,041
it reeks of mai tais and
you gave birth to it!

105
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:46,201
I come downstairs to make breakfast,
and there he is,

106
00:05:46,202 --> 00:05:48,021
passed out, stewed to the gills.

107
00:05:48,022 --> 00:05:50,063
Again, Karen, we are so sorry.

108
00:05:50,182 --> 00:05:52,545
If I wanted a drunk homo on my couch,

109
00:05:52,546 --> 00:05:54,706
I would have married my college boyfriend.

110
00:05:57,143 --> 00:05:59,847
You can let me go, all right? I'm okay.

111
00:06:00,542 --> 00:06:03,235
Okay? You broke into a neighbor's house

112
00:06:03,236 --> 00:06:04,757
and passed out.

113
00:06:04,783 --> 00:06:06,878
I didn't break in. I...

114
00:06:07,566 --> 00:06:10,046
I got a little confused, and...

115
00:06:10,709 --> 00:06:12,199
went in the wrong house.

116
00:06:13,505 --> 00:06:16,642
You got to admit, all these
places kind of look the same.

117
00:06:16,726 --> 00:06:19,958
When you're drunk! Andrew, this is not good.

118
00:06:20,414 --> 00:06:22,119
Calm down, all right?

119
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,561
I just... I just had a little
too much fun last night.

120
00:06:26,491 --> 00:06:28,393
You need to be very careful.

121
00:06:28,394 --> 00:06:31,661
Thanks to me, you have a genetic
predisposition to alcoholism.

122
00:06:31,662 --> 00:06:33,469
What? Just 'cause you're one,

123
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,931
you want everyone in your little club?

124
00:06:36,475 --> 00:06:39,210
I'm not an alcoholic, okay?

125
00:06:39,746 --> 00:06:41,826
I got everything under control.

126
00:06:48,433 --> 00:06:49,922
How bad is it?

127
00:06:50,134 --> 00:06:51,366
It's really bad.

128
00:06:51,807 --> 00:06:53,290
When did it start?

129
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:57,294
A while ago. First it was
just on the weekends,

130
00:06:57,361 --> 00:06:59,890
then sometimes during the week,
and now it's every night.

131
00:06:59,998 --> 00:07:01,550
I wish you had told me.

132
00:07:02,866 --> 00:07:04,385
You know what I've started to do?

133
00:07:05,143 --> 00:07:06,833
I pretend I have to work late,

134
00:07:06,834 --> 00:07:08,850
so I don't have to come
home and deal with him.

135
00:07:09,106 --> 00:07:11,357
- Well, you need to talk to him.
- I have,

136
00:07:11,358 --> 00:07:14,318
and he promises it'll get better,
but it only gets worse.

137
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:20,480
I love him, but I can't take it anymore.

138
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,185
I know. It's very difficult.

139
00:07:22,186 --> 00:07:24,298
No, Bree. I'm thinking of leaving him.

140
00:07:25,483 --> 00:07:27,377
Please don't. Not yet.

141
00:07:27,378 --> 00:07:30,113
Let me try to get him some help.
I'll talk to him.

142
00:07:30,114 --> 00:07:32,801
No offense, but I don't think
you're gonna get through to him.

143
00:07:33,974 --> 00:07:34,925
Don't be so sure.

144
00:07:34,926 --> 00:07:36,602
I once smuggled vodka into church

145
00:07:36,603 --> 00:07:38,620
in a "Jesus saves" sports bottle.

146
00:07:38,621 --> 00:07:40,301
I can be pretty resourceful.

147
00:07:44,261 --> 00:07:46,290
Tables and chairs go out back,

148
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,457
chafing dishes and flatware in the kitchen,

149
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:51,913
and eyes off the boobs,
but thanks for noticing.

150
00:07:52,521 --> 00:07:55,245
Hey. I saw the party rental truck.
What's going on?

151
00:07:55,246 --> 00:07:57,642
What do you think?
It's for our party tomorrow night.

152
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:02,112
Wh... our spring fling?
We're... still flinging?

153
00:08:02,222 --> 00:08:03,518
Oh, why wouldn't we be?

154
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:05,265
Oh, I don't know. Unless the theme is

155
00:08:05,266 --> 00:08:07,181
"Neighbors who blow their brains out,"
I kind of thought

156
00:08:07,182 --> 00:08:09,874
the Beth Young thing might put
a damper on the festivities.

157
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:11,875
Why? She wasn't even invited.

158
00:08:12,578 --> 00:08:14,278
Well, we can't ignore the fact

159
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:15,958
that one of our neighbors is dead.

160
00:08:16,091 --> 00:08:18,202
Brain-dead. Big difference.

161
00:08:18,242 --> 00:08:20,169
Besides, she seems like a clinger.

162
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:21,993
Bet she'll stick around for months.

163
00:08:22,676 --> 00:08:24,665
So you think it's okay that
we still throw this party?

164
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:27,216
Gaby, it's not a party. It's an event.

165
00:08:27,368 --> 00:08:31,080
Would you cancel the Oscars? Christmas? No!

166
00:08:31,245 --> 00:08:34,228
The invitations have been sent,
the caterer's been hired.

167
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:36,882
Life is for the living, so let's live.

168
00:08:38,426 --> 00:08:40,841
Well, the living did buy a new dress...

169
00:08:41,142 --> 00:08:42,342
Versace.

170
00:08:43,102 --> 00:08:44,192
And I'm sure Beth would have loved

171
00:08:44,193 --> 00:08:46,530
to have seen you in that Versace.

172
00:08:46,746 --> 00:08:48,506
She would have, wouldn't she?

173
00:08:48,582 --> 00:08:51,579
In a-in a way,
it could be a tribute to her.

174
00:08:52,634 --> 00:08:56,104
And I did see the perfect
tribute shoes at the mall.

175
00:08:56,175 --> 00:08:58,333
Now that is the spirit.

176
00:08:58,351 --> 00:09:00,281
Now make sure the guests
know the party is still on,

177
00:09:00,282 --> 00:09:02,330
and I will take care of
the arrangements here.

178
00:09:03,597 --> 00:09:05,604
Oh, and, uh, maybe we could
have a moment of silence

179
00:09:05,605 --> 00:09:07,798
and then a champagne toast in Beth's honor.

180
00:09:07,819 --> 00:09:11,069
Oh, fabulous idea,
except instead of champagne,

181
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:14,846
let's do mojitos, and instead of Beth,
let's toast to us.

182
00:09:15,526 --> 00:09:17,077
And the moment of silence?

183
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:19,269
Would sound great with music.

184
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:26,337
Oh. Sorry.

185
00:09:26,446 --> 00:09:28,134
Please pick up 2-2-8-7.

186
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:32,197
Satellite pharmacy, please pick up 2-2-8-7.

187
00:09:38,969 --> 00:09:41,242
Paul, I want you to know how sorry I am.

188
00:09:43,762 --> 00:09:45,907
Can't imagine what you're
going through right now.

189
00:09:56,883 --> 00:09:59,618
I want you to know how grateful I am

190
00:09:59,852 --> 00:10:02,405
for this gift that Beth is giving me.

191
00:10:02,734 --> 00:10:05,151
Obviously, it doesn't bring her back.

192
00:10:05,443 --> 00:10:09,602
But I hope it will be a small comfort to you

193
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,231
knowing that in some way she'll live on.

194
00:10:15,803 --> 00:10:17,610
Why would that give me comfort?

195
00:10:18,911 --> 00:10:19,810
Are you trying to tell me

196
00:10:19,811 --> 00:10:22,962
that my wife is dead and 
that you're the consolation prize?

197
00:10:24,218 --> 00:10:25,717
No, that's not what I'm saying...

198
00:10:25,718 --> 00:10:28,590
I hate to disappoint you,
Susan, but my wife's not dead.

199
00:10:28,591 --> 00:10:30,157
She's very much alive.

200
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,026
They told me there was no chance...

201
00:10:33,027 --> 00:10:34,578
I don't care what they told you.

202
00:10:34,914 --> 00:10:36,881
Beth is alive, and 
I intend to keep her that way

203
00:10:36,882 --> 00:10:39,496
as long as possible.
I'm not going to allow you

204
00:10:39,497 --> 00:10:42,378
to strip her for parts
like some abandoned car.

205
00:10:43,402 --> 00:10:46,966
That's not what's happening here.
This was Beth's idea.

206
00:10:46,967 --> 00:10:49,580
Beth was not in her right mind
when she signed those forms.

207
00:10:49,581 --> 00:10:51,646
As far as I'm concerned, they mean nothing.

208
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:54,462
And what makes you think
you deserve her kidney?

209
00:10:54,898 --> 00:10:57,139
Was it those meals you shared with her?

210
00:10:57,617 --> 00:10:59,837
All the girls' nights you included her in?

211
00:10:59,838 --> 00:11:01,549
The little gestures of kindness you offered

212
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,354
to make her feel less alone?

213
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:06,138
Right.

214
00:11:06,706 --> 00:11:09,280
You gave her nothing in life,

215
00:11:09,542 --> 00:11:12,422
and that's exactly what
you're going to get in death.

216
00:11:23,813 --> 00:11:26,840
I don't get this.
Beth signed the donation forms

217
00:11:26,841 --> 00:11:29,242
and a living will.
Those are legal documents.

218
00:11:29,311 --> 00:11:32,430
- Aren't they binding?
- Yes and no.

219
00:11:32,843 --> 00:11:35,193
You're gonna have to do
a little better than "Yes and no."

220
00:11:35,271 --> 00:11:38,453
Yes, they'll stand up in court,
but this hospital's not inclined

221
00:11:38,454 --> 00:11:41,638
to wage a legal battle
against a grieving husband.

222
00:11:41,738 --> 00:11:43,228
It's too delicate.

223
00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:46,293
He's not a grieving husband.
Paul Young has a vendetta

224
00:11:46,294 --> 00:11:47,204
against my family.

225
00:11:47,205 --> 00:11:49,811
He's only doing this to make us suffer.

226
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:54,757
Look, we can't publicly support you,

227
00:11:54,758 --> 00:11:56,177
but if you decide to take this on,

228
00:11:56,178 --> 00:11:57,825
we won't stand in your way.

229
00:11:58,898 --> 00:12:00,882
You're damn right we're gonna take this on.

230
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:03,338
No, we're not.

231
00:12:03,945 --> 00:12:05,625
- Susan...
- We're not fighting Paul.

232
00:12:05,729 --> 00:12:07,785
This is your life we're talking about here.

233
00:12:07,786 --> 00:12:12,378
- We can't let him win.
- Win? His wife shot herself.

234
00:12:12,686 --> 00:12:14,166
And you want to, what,

235
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:16,649
hire lawyers? Drag him to court?

236
00:12:16,954 --> 00:12:19,482
I know that you're only thinking of me,

237
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,759
but this is Paul's decision to make.

238
00:12:23,582 --> 00:12:25,198
It's not ours.

239
00:12:27,962 --> 00:12:29,578
I just want to go home.

240
00:12:41,409 --> 00:12:43,377
Thanks for helping me drop these off.

241
00:12:43,455 --> 00:12:46,013
Yeah, no problem.
It's nice to be out of the house.

242
00:12:46,543 --> 00:12:48,051
When did you start catering again?

243
00:12:48,052 --> 00:12:50,866
Oh, it's nothing official,
just when I'm needed.

244
00:12:50,946 --> 00:12:52,200
And who's the client?

245
00:12:52,201 --> 00:12:55,882
Um... they prefer to remain anonymous.

246
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,806
Coffee? Doughnuts?

247
00:13:04,807 --> 00:13:06,950
The old drunk guy from
outside the supermarket?

248
00:13:07,525 --> 00:13:09,174
This is an A.A. meeting.

249
00:13:09,312 --> 00:13:11,057
It's a wonderful program.

250
00:13:11,193 --> 00:13:13,644
Lying to your son... which step is that?

251
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:14,734
I'm sorry.

252
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:17,504
But now that you're here,
why don't you give it a try?

253
00:13:17,658 --> 00:13:20,024
Just listen to people's
shares and see if you relate.

254
00:13:20,025 --> 00:13:22,416
And what am I supposed to say
when I get up there and talk?

255
00:13:22,417 --> 00:13:24,629
"Hello, my name is Andrew.
My mommy brought me"?

256
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:27,157
No one has to know we're related.
Andrew, please.

257
00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:30,649
Just one meeting. It could save your life.

258
00:13:30,937 --> 00:13:34,545
Hey. I see you've met Bree.
My name's Tommy. Welcome.

259
00:13:35,138 --> 00:13:35,986
First time?

260
00:13:35,987 --> 00:13:39,842
Yes, first time. Uh, my name is... Elvis.

261
00:13:41,214 --> 00:13:44,574
Elvis. Really? That's your name?

262
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,526
Yes, it's Elvis.

263
00:13:46,849 --> 00:13:49,362
Yet another reason for me
to be mad at my mother.

264
00:13:56,122 --> 00:13:57,896
Hey. How'd it go?

265
00:13:57,897 --> 00:14:00,017
Ah, we would have played
better if there was a windmill.

266
00:14:00,018 --> 00:14:03,010
Lynette, this is Glenn Morris,
C.E.O. of Morris Technologies...

267
00:14:03,011 --> 00:14:04,792
- Oh.
- And a man who can throw a 6-iron

268
00:14:04,793 --> 00:14:07,377
- farther than he can hit with one.
- Nice to meet you.

269
00:14:07,378 --> 00:14:09,653
- Nice to meet you.
- So you guys want to come over for a beer?

270
00:14:09,653 --> 00:14:12,733
- Uh, you know what? I should go. Next time.
- Bye.

271
00:14:12,734 --> 00:14:14,441
- See ya.
- Well, nice to meet ya.

272
00:14:14,442 --> 00:14:16,164
Hey, do you mind if I use the facilities

273
00:14:16,165 --> 00:14:18,533
- before I hit the road?
- No. Come on in.

274
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:22,382
The bathroom's down there.

275
00:14:22,383 --> 00:14:24,814
We have five kids. You might want to squint.

276
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:28,621
Actually, I don't need a bathroom.
I need a C.F.O.

277
00:14:29,347 --> 00:14:30,289
What?

278
00:14:30,378 --> 00:14:32,750
My chief financial officer
took a job in London,

279
00:14:32,751 --> 00:14:36,921
and there's one name on my list
for his replacement... Tom Scavo.

280
00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:40,634
Tom Scavo... I know that guy.

281
00:14:41,562 --> 00:14:43,469
Glenn, where'd this come from?

282
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:45,038
Well, Carlos is always bragging about you,

283
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:49,665
so I started asking around.
Come to find out everybody loves you.

284
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:52,025
What's not to love about Tom Scavo?

285
00:14:52,026 --> 00:14:54,681
I'm prepared to give you
a very generous salary,

286
00:14:54,682 --> 00:14:57,434
stock options, access to the company jet.

287
00:14:57,435 --> 00:15:00,070
Wow, this is amazing.

288
00:15:00,994 --> 00:15:02,027
But no.

289
00:15:02,747 --> 00:15:05,836
Well, we just found something
not to love about Tom Scavo.

290
00:15:05,837 --> 00:15:06,768
What?

291
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,706
Carlos is a close friend,
and we're just starting

292
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:10,673
our busy season.
I can't leave him in the lurch.

293
00:15:10,674 --> 00:15:12,977
Look, Tom, I don't want to buy
a man out of his loyalty...

294
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:15,054
You could try. It never
hurts to put in an offer.

295
00:15:15,055 --> 00:15:20,385
Lynette... Glenn, you have made my day,
but I gotta pass.

296
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:23,394
This conversation isn't over.
I hope you're gonna

297
00:15:23,395 --> 00:15:25,307
talk some sense into this husband of yours.

298
00:15:25,308 --> 00:15:28,045
Talk, beat, whatever gets the job done.

299
00:15:31,217 --> 00:15:33,905
Okay. Now is when you wink,
rub your hands together,

300
00:15:33,906 --> 00:15:36,281
and tell me you were playing
that man like a fiddle,

301
00:15:36,282 --> 00:15:38,719
'cause this blank stare...

302
00:15:40,528 --> 00:15:43,078
That's not fading is
scaring the hell out of me.

303
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:45,472
I'm not gonna screw over Carlos.

304
00:15:45,473 --> 00:15:48,195
What's the matter with you?
Whatever happened to integrity?

305
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:48,933
Nothing.

306
00:15:48,934 --> 00:15:52,804
It got a better offer from Glenn
and turned into prosperity.

307
00:15:53,273 --> 00:15:55,784
Lynette, as much as I appreciate
you trying to run my life,

308
00:15:55,785 --> 00:15:58,176
this is my decision, and I'm saying no.

309
00:16:04,134 --> 00:16:07,155
Okay. Um... it looks like
we have a little time left.

310
00:16:07,156 --> 00:16:08,764
Anyone else want to share?

311
00:16:10,111 --> 00:16:11,144
Elvis?

312
00:16:12,313 --> 00:16:14,905
It's not mandatory,
but we'd love to hear from you.

313
00:16:15,926 --> 00:16:16,936
Elvis?

314
00:16:17,837 --> 00:16:18,726
Oh.

315
00:16:18,972 --> 00:16:21,010
Uh, no, thanks. I-I pass.

316
00:16:21,011 --> 00:16:24,976
This is a safe place.
No one here is going to judge you.

317
00:16:27,997 --> 00:16:31,140
Okay. You know...

318
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:32,124
when I hear you guys talk

319
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:35,014
about how other people try
to control your lives,

320
00:16:35,015 --> 00:16:37,707
like, uh, Ed here with his boss

321
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:41,893
or... oh, Mary Ann with her... cat,

322
00:16:42,466 --> 00:16:44,040
you know, I can relate.

323
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:47,758
You know, I have the same kind
of problem with... my mother.

324
00:16:49,774 --> 00:16:52,001
You know, I-I think her
greatest regret in life

325
00:16:52,002 --> 00:16:55,708
is the fact that she gave birth
to a son and not a puppet.

326
00:16:57,233 --> 00:16:59,097
She's such a control freak

327
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:01,963
that my sister and I used
to call her "Attila the mom."

328
00:17:03,142 --> 00:17:04,913
Could we not laugh?

329
00:17:06,686 --> 00:17:07,713
I mean...

330
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:10,804
We're trying to heal here.

331
00:17:10,805 --> 00:17:12,970
Nothing I ever did was good enough for her.

332
00:17:13,105 --> 00:17:14,153
Like in the tenth grade,

333
00:17:14,154 --> 00:17:17,191
I-I wanted to run for... for class president,

334
00:17:17,192 --> 00:17:20,320
and the night before I was
gonna announce, she said,

335
00:17:20,421 --> 00:17:21,829
"Are you sure about this?"

336
00:17:22,446 --> 00:17:24,598
"You're not exactly a born leader."

337
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,152
Ouch. She sounds awful.

338
00:17:27,263 --> 00:17:28,856
Or does she sound like a loving mother

339
00:17:28,857 --> 00:17:32,480
- trying to protect her son
from disappointment?
- I don't think so,

340
00:17:32,481 --> 00:17:34,273
'cause she wouldn't even
listen to my speech.

341
00:17:34,274 --> 00:17:35,214
Well, maybe she was busy

342
00:17:35,215 --> 00:17:39,454
preparing dinner for a family of
four with no help from her son.

343
00:17:39,455 --> 00:17:41,770
Yeah, it is hard work making dinner

344
00:17:41,771 --> 00:17:43,481
while maintaining an atmosphere

345
00:17:43,482 --> 00:17:46,148
- of emotional repression.
- Well, if you ask me,

346
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:47,782
some emotions could stand to be repressed.

347
00:17:47,783 --> 00:17:48,519
Uh, Bree?

348
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,059
I'm sorry, but we're here to
stop drinking, not criticize

349
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:54,605
- the women who gave us life.
- He's just trying to share.

350
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:57,762
Well, there is a difference
between sharing and whining.

351
00:17:59,906 --> 00:18:03,695
Okay. Uh, we are definitely out of time.
Thank you, everybody.

352
00:18:03,696 --> 00:18:07,190
Now let's just join hands and
recite the serenity prayer.

353
00:18:09,987 --> 00:18:10,962
God...

354
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:12,780
Grant me the serenity

355
00:18:12,802 --> 00:18:15,534
to accept the things I cannot change,

356
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:18,833
the courage to change the things that I can,

357
00:18:18,914 --> 00:18:21,612
and the wisdom to know the difference.

358
00:18:27,175 --> 00:18:28,300
So I just wanted to remind you

359
00:18:28,301 --> 00:18:30,800
about the party Renee and I
are throwing tomorrow night.

360
00:18:31,101 --> 00:18:32,559
You're still having that thing?

361
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,099
- A woman's on life support.
- Exactly.

362
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,088
She's not dead. It's like you're
making my argument for me.

363
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:41,389
Put Roy and me down for a "No," But please,

364
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:44,260
call us when you have your
hurricane Katrina pool party.

365
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:50,827
So... Renee and I are
still having our party...

366
00:18:50,828 --> 00:18:53,196
Are you nuts? In case you
haven't heard, our friend

367
00:18:53,197 --> 00:18:56,104
across the street, Betty Young,
just blew her brains out.

368
00:18:56,105 --> 00:18:57,417
Beth Young.

369
00:18:57,418 --> 00:19:00,549
Oh. I got her name wrong. How disrespectful.

370
00:19:00,611 --> 00:19:03,808
Oh, I hope you don't tell that
story tomorrow at your party.

371
00:19:07,575 --> 00:19:09,151
It's just a little neighborhood gathering...

372
00:19:09,152 --> 00:19:11,199
Gabrielle, what is wrong with you?

373
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,118
Oh, boy.

374
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:14,098
I know we didn't know Beth very well,
but we did know

375
00:19:14,099 --> 00:19:16,950
Mary Alice, and this tragic
event has brought up a lot of

376
00:19:16,951 --> 00:19:20,882
painful memories for all of us.
How could you not realize that?

377
00:19:21,899 --> 00:19:23,588
Well, they can all go to hell.

378
00:19:23,589 --> 00:19:26,373
- We're still having the party.
- Are you listening to me?

379
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:28,059
I got four "Are you out of your minds,"

380
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,388
three "You make me want to puke,"

381
00:19:29,389 --> 00:19:33,033
and one "Maybe," from Lee.
The message is pretty clear.

382
00:19:33,597 --> 00:19:35,843
Yeah. "Order less shrimp."

383
00:19:35,844 --> 00:19:38,229
No. Renee, we can't have this party.

384
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:40,250
We should have canceled
the moment we heard about Beth.

385
00:19:40,251 --> 00:19:42,631
- Ah, nobody even liked her.
- It doesn't matter.

386
00:19:42,632 --> 00:19:45,261
It's in horrible taste.
Why can't we just change the date?

387
00:19:45,262 --> 00:19:47,449
No! For ten years

388
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,928
I've had my spring fling
the first sunday of april,

389
00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:52,425
not the second sunday, not the third,

390
00:19:52,426 --> 00:19:53,938
and not when a bunch of wimps decide

391
00:19:53,939 --> 00:19:57,506
they're ready to stop moping.
I'm not canceling the party.

392
00:19:57,953 --> 00:19:59,199
But nobody's gonna be here.

393
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,088
Oh, well, we'll see about that.

394
00:20:02,247 --> 00:20:04,507
My social life is not gonna
come to a stop just because

395
00:20:04,508 --> 00:20:07,871
some cuckoo bird decides to
clean her ears with a handgun.

396
00:20:09,957 --> 00:20:12,429
Wow. Thank you.

397
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:13,873
For what?

398
00:20:14,076 --> 00:20:16,024
Making me the compassionate one.

399
00:20:24,297 --> 00:20:26,606
Wow. Is he asleep already?

400
00:20:26,788 --> 00:20:28,508
Yeah, he was exhausted.

401
00:20:28,517 --> 00:20:30,919
Not even Harry Potter
could keep him awake tonight.

402
00:20:32,219 --> 00:20:36,273
Look, I'm not trying to upset you,
and I'm not mad,

403
00:20:37,191 --> 00:20:39,916
but I need to know why you won't
let me fight to get you the kidney.

404
00:20:43,522 --> 00:20:46,252
I don't know. It's just, uh...

405
00:20:47,126 --> 00:20:48,438
it just feels wrong.

406
00:20:48,439 --> 00:20:51,446
Well, it shouldn't.
Beth wanted you to have it.

407
00:20:51,447 --> 00:20:56,575
Exactly. She killed herself so
I could have her kidney. Why?

408
00:20:57,108 --> 00:20:58,648
Paul's right. I never had

409
00:20:58,649 --> 00:21:01,222
so much as a pleasant
exchange with the woman.

410
00:21:01,223 --> 00:21:03,084
I don't know that the reason matters.

411
00:21:03,085 --> 00:21:05,291
What matters is, it was her final wish.

412
00:21:05,292 --> 00:21:07,764
But it doesn't make any sense.

413
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,824
I can't take her kidney, knowing that maybe

414
00:21:15,825 --> 00:21:18,761
I'm the reason she's lying in that hospital.

415
00:21:29,089 --> 00:21:30,760
Hey. Hey, I'm-I'm reading.

416
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:34,959
Oh, good evening, sir. Welcome aboard.

417
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:37,615
Can I get you anything before we...

418
00:21:38,499 --> 00:21:39,794
take off?

419
00:21:43,522 --> 00:21:45,933
Ooh. You could help me put
my bag under the seat.

420
00:21:46,636 --> 00:21:47,943
Okay, you're not good at this,

421
00:21:47,944 --> 00:21:49,737
so let me do the talking.

422
00:21:50,368 --> 00:21:53,714
May I help you with your seat belt?

423
00:21:54,512 --> 00:21:55,623
Oh, look...

424
00:21:55,624 --> 00:21:58,403
You're already in
the upright and locked position.

425
00:22:00,814 --> 00:22:02,566
What's the name of this airline?

426
00:22:02,831 --> 00:22:04,332
I want to become a frequent flyer.

427
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:07,164
Oh, this isn't a commercial airline, sir.

428
00:22:07,165 --> 00:22:12,011
Hotshot executives like you
only fly on the corporate jet.

429
00:22:12,741 --> 00:22:13,654
- Mmm.
- Hey, L-Lynette?

430
00:22:13,655 --> 00:22:16,795
- Mm-hmm?
- I'm-I'm not taking that job.

431
00:22:18,246 --> 00:22:19,150
Ugh.

432
00:22:19,151 --> 00:22:21,367
Well, then you'll be handling
your own bags from now on.

433
00:22:21,368 --> 00:22:23,485
Lynette, we talked about this.

434
00:22:23,486 --> 00:22:26,249
I-I won't leave Carlos in the lurch.

435
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:30,563
Okay, great. You're loyal. I love that.

436
00:22:30,564 --> 00:22:32,361
But your stock went way up today.

437
00:22:32,362 --> 00:22:34,275
If you're gonna stay put,
at least could you try

438
00:22:34,276 --> 00:22:36,099
to get something out of this?

439
00:22:36,297 --> 00:22:39,966
Well, I could tell Carlos about the offer,

440
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:41,800
see if he'll match the number.

441
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,136
Match the number?

442
00:22:45,005 --> 00:22:46,205
Oh, look...

443
00:22:47,531 --> 00:22:49,378
A seat just opened up.

444
00:23:01,288 --> 00:23:03,074
I wondered if you would come.

445
00:23:03,182 --> 00:23:05,021
They told me at the hospital
that you're trying to have Beth

446
00:23:05,022 --> 00:23:08,079
declared dead and
her life support turned off.

447
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:10,101
Yes.

448
00:23:10,672 --> 00:23:13,437
Well, that's not going to happen.

449
00:23:13,438 --> 00:23:14,485
It has to.

450
00:23:14,486 --> 00:23:16,536
- Why?
- Because she's dead.

451
00:23:16,742 --> 00:23:18,590
No, she's not.

452
00:23:20,827 --> 00:23:22,553
My daughter's dead.

453
00:23:23,091 --> 00:23:25,757
Your wife is dead.

454
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:28,141
And we both know what killed her.

455
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:30,059
If you're trying to blame me for this...

456
00:23:30,498 --> 00:23:32,400
if this is your last attempt
to use her to hurt me...

457
00:23:32,401 --> 00:23:37,017
No. We don't get to use her anymore, Paul.

458
00:23:37,018 --> 00:23:41,703
This... sick game you and I play,

459
00:23:41,704 --> 00:23:46,022
this hate we hurl at each other
has finally found a victim...

460
00:23:46,793 --> 00:23:49,050
the only innocent person in the game.

461
00:23:49,251 --> 00:23:50,453
I did nothing.

462
00:23:50,454 --> 00:23:53,101
You refused to believe she loved you.

463
00:23:54,623 --> 00:23:58,241
I turned her away because she did.

464
00:24:00,362 --> 00:24:01,909
And now she's gone.

465
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:05,966
She...

466
00:24:07,631 --> 00:24:09,101
Maybe she can recover.

467
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:12,214
I believe she can. You must believe it, too,

468
00:24:12,215 --> 00:24:14,516
or you wouldn't be in here praying for her.

469
00:24:14,517 --> 00:24:16,353
I'm not praying for her.

470
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:20,189
I'm praying for forgiveness.

471
00:24:21,247 --> 00:24:23,376
We did this to her, Paul.

472
00:24:24,012 --> 00:24:25,713
Now we have to stop.

473
00:24:29,065 --> 00:24:31,625
And we have to let her rest.

474
00:24:44,419 --> 00:24:47,328
Hi. Can I come in?

475
00:24:48,262 --> 00:24:49,206
Sure.

476
00:24:53,379 --> 00:24:54,692
I'm on my way to a meeting

477
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:56,889
and I was hoping you might join me.

478
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,918
Look, the deal was one meeting, mom.
I went and I'm done.

479
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,977
You won't go back? Even for me?

480
00:25:05,046 --> 00:25:08,110
Nope. Elvis has left the building.

481
00:25:10,274 --> 00:25:13,805
Look, I don't need to go,
all right? I'm fine.

482
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,395
I hope you know that
"I don't have a problem"

483
00:25:18,396 --> 00:25:20,792
is one of the biggest
clichés in our playbook.

484
00:25:20,793 --> 00:25:23,861
Don't get me wrong.
I have plenty of problems.

485
00:25:24,413 --> 00:25:26,341
I-I have no job.

486
00:25:26,415 --> 00:25:29,776
Alex works these crazy 18-hour
shifts at the hospital.

487
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:31,932
What's my day?

488
00:25:32,658 --> 00:25:36,216
Long, endless stretches of nothing.

489
00:25:36,217 --> 00:25:39,728
I work out. I do laundry.

490
00:25:40,881 --> 00:25:45,951
I-I dusted the other day...
actually dusted and felt proud.

491
00:25:46,786 --> 00:25:48,351
How pathetic is that?

492
00:25:48,352 --> 00:25:49,855
I don't find that pathetic.

493
00:25:49,856 --> 00:25:51,263
I know you don't.

494
00:25:52,794 --> 00:25:55,873
Look, the one thing that gets me through

495
00:25:55,874 --> 00:26:00,124
is-is knowing that when
the night rolls around,

496
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:02,984
I can just have a few drinks and kick back.

497
00:26:03,707 --> 00:26:06,960
And as long as I don't hurt anyone,
I think I'm allowed.

498
00:26:08,367 --> 00:26:09,843
Mom, trust me.

499
00:26:10,763 --> 00:26:11,883
I'll be okay.

500
00:26:15,897 --> 00:26:17,092
If you say so.

501
00:26:37,082 --> 00:26:38,931
- What?
- You listen to me.

502
00:26:39,334 --> 00:26:41,987
There's been a terrible
tragedy in our neighborhood.

503
00:26:41,988 --> 00:26:44,455
A woman felt desperate and
alone and killed herself

504
00:26:44,456 --> 00:26:46,718
because nobody cared enough to help her.

505
00:26:46,719 --> 00:26:49,171
And the thing is, I was there.

506
00:26:49,353 --> 00:26:51,121
I saw that something was wrong...

507
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,818
and I walked away.

508
00:26:54,357 --> 00:26:57,322
And I am never gonna let
myself do that again,

509
00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:00,201
and certainly not with you.

510
00:27:05,066 --> 00:27:06,456
Alex left me.

511
00:27:08,152 --> 00:27:09,356
Oh, my...

512
00:27:09,702 --> 00:27:12,571
I guess he just got sick
of living with a drunk.

513
00:27:14,193 --> 00:27:15,340
Oh, sweetie.

514
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:19,066
What did I-I do?

515
00:27:19,067 --> 00:27:22,674
I-I wrecked my marriage.

516
00:27:22,675 --> 00:27:23,957
Look, it's gonna get better.

517
00:27:23,958 --> 00:27:26,477
I promise you it's gonna get better.

518
00:27:27,905 --> 00:27:29,381
But for that to start,

519
00:27:31,136 --> 00:27:33,018
you need to go to a meeting.

520
00:27:33,347 --> 00:27:35,612
I can't get up in front
of a bunch of strangers

521
00:27:35,613 --> 00:27:37,630
and talk about this.

522
00:27:38,754 --> 00:27:42,814
Then... we can have a meeting right here...

523
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:45,349
just the two of us.

524
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:46,529
What do you say?

525
00:28:00,727 --> 00:28:03,757
Wow. Well, that's Glenn for you.
He's nothing if not aggressive.

526
00:28:03,758 --> 00:28:07,038
Carlos, I swear I didn't seek this out.

527
00:28:07,284 --> 00:28:10,537
I know you didn't. And you're
a stand-up guy for telling me.

528
00:28:10,538 --> 00:28:12,608
But it is a very generous offer,

529
00:28:12,609 --> 00:28:14,956
and I figured if that's
my value in the marketplace,

530
00:28:14,957 --> 00:28:16,895
that maybe I should be...

531
00:28:18,128 --> 00:28:20,151
Doing a little better here.

532
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:22,440
Look, our friendship aside,

533
00:28:22,441 --> 00:28:24,757
you are a valuable part of this company.

534
00:28:25,211 --> 00:28:26,601
And if I had the cash...

535
00:28:27,522 --> 00:28:28,969
you know I'd step up.

536
00:28:29,005 --> 00:28:31,543
- But...
- You know how rough things have been.

537
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:32,675
You've seen the empty desks.

538
00:28:32,676 --> 00:28:35,218
We just can't offer you that kind of money.

539
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:38,251
But I don't want to lose you,
so here's what I can offer...

540
00:28:39,302 --> 00:28:40,865
title bump to chief marketing officer,

541
00:28:40,866 --> 00:28:42,822
car allowance, and...

542
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,477
profit participation.

543
00:28:46,455 --> 00:28:47,321
How's that sound?

544
00:28:47,322 --> 00:28:49,024
It sounds like a bunch of crap.

545
00:28:49,138 --> 00:28:50,586
Ugh. Lynette.

546
00:28:50,587 --> 00:28:52,412
Of course he pleaded poverty.

547
00:28:52,413 --> 00:28:54,149
Did you play hardball? Did you grind him?

548
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:57,669
Yes! That's how I got profit participation.

549
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:00,108
Tom, I worked at that company, remember?

550
00:29:00,109 --> 00:29:02,422
At the end of the year,
Carlos takes the excess cash

551
00:29:02,423 --> 00:29:05,490
as a bonus, so there is no
profit to participate in.

552
00:29:05,491 --> 00:29:07,817
What else did he offer you?
A bogus new title?

553
00:29:07,818 --> 00:29:12,239
Not-not bogus!
Chief marketing officer. C.M.O.

554
00:29:14,193 --> 00:29:15,847
A-and a car allowance.

555
00:29:15,848 --> 00:29:17,597
Oh, that's great.

556
00:29:17,598 --> 00:29:20,815
"Here's your allowance, Tommy.
Good luck on your paper route."

557
00:29:20,816 --> 00:29:23,086
You are over the line, Lynette.

558
00:29:23,087 --> 00:29:26,376
And you are walking away from
real money and real power

559
00:29:26,377 --> 00:29:28,987
for pretend profits and a made-up title.

560
00:29:28,988 --> 00:29:32,229
Carlos might as well call you
"King of all important things"

561
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:34,071
and give you a pile of Monopoly money.

562
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:36,291
Why do you keep pushing like this?

563
00:29:36,292 --> 00:29:38,533
'Cause if I don't, you go nowhere.

564
00:29:43,726 --> 00:29:44,798
Wow.

565
00:29:46,156 --> 00:29:47,736
So that's where you think I am?

566
00:29:48,699 --> 00:29:49,935
Nowhere?

567
00:29:53,365 --> 00:29:56,180
Oh, my god. You're not gonna take that back?

568
00:29:56,181 --> 00:30:00,491
I think you are an amazing
husband and father.

569
00:30:00,699 --> 00:30:02,393
But as a businessman...

570
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:04,818
You're 46 years old

571
00:30:04,819 --> 00:30:07,080
and you're still trying
to establish yourself.

572
00:30:07,081 --> 00:30:10,351
Opportunities like this don't
keep falling from the sky.

573
00:30:10,352 --> 00:30:13,220
- You gotta grab 'em.
- By stabbing my friend in the back?

574
00:30:13,221 --> 00:30:16,160
Do you think Carlos
would hesitate for a second...

575
00:30:16,161 --> 00:30:17,997
if the roles were reversed? Not a chance.

576
00:30:17,998 --> 00:30:19,466
That's how he got where he is.

577
00:30:19,467 --> 00:30:21,588
- He's ruthless.
- You wanna see me get ruthless?

578
00:30:21,589 --> 00:30:23,636
Watch what happens if you don't drop this.

579
00:31:00,155 --> 00:31:02,465
Wow. This is some crowd.

580
00:31:02,589 --> 00:31:05,303
Told ya. Well, I'm pretty close to capacity,

581
00:31:05,304 --> 00:31:06,964
- so you're gonna have to scoot along now...
- Well,

582
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:09,470
I'm just stunned so many people came.

583
00:31:09,471 --> 00:31:11,221
Well, just shows you how little you know

584
00:31:11,222 --> 00:31:13,603
- about the party circuit elite.
- Oh.

585
00:31:14,275 --> 00:31:16,131
Wait. Is that the guy from animal control

586
00:31:16,132 --> 00:31:17,729
who picks up dead birds?

587
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:19,328
What? No.

588
00:31:19,658 --> 00:31:22,531
Uh, these are mostly people
I've met through the years

589
00:31:22,532 --> 00:31:23,362
in the Caribbean.

590
00:31:23,363 --> 00:31:26,039
Mrs. Solis? I was going to call you.

591
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,293
Is it okay if I clean your pool

592
00:31:27,294 --> 00:31:29,362
on thursday instead of wednesday?

593
00:31:30,338 --> 00:31:32,957
Of course. I mean,
if you think you'll make it back

594
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:34,451
from St. Barts by then.

595
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:40,833
Ugh! Don't give me that look.

596
00:31:40,834 --> 00:31:42,752
A good hostess knows the best parties

597
00:31:42,753 --> 00:31:44,310
have a mix of people.

598
00:31:44,446 --> 00:31:46,053
Honey, the only mix I see

599
00:31:46,054 --> 00:31:49,008
is the cotton/poly blend
on every dress in this room.

600
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:51,422
Excuse me.

601
00:31:53,956 --> 00:31:55,049
Renee!

602
00:31:56,527 --> 00:31:57,921
Renee, look, I...

603
00:31:58,212 --> 00:31:59,708
Hey, you two!

604
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:00,662
Beat it!

605
00:32:00,927 --> 00:32:02,554
You have a cool house.

606
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:07,831
I don't get it. Why have a party

607
00:32:07,832 --> 00:32:10,368
when the people you really
want are too sad to come?

608
00:32:10,369 --> 00:32:13,437
Well, I'm not sad,
and I'm not gonna pretend to be.

609
00:32:13,438 --> 00:32:16,676
Renee! I know you didn't like Beth,
but come on. She's dying.

610
00:32:16,677 --> 00:32:18,497
And whose fault is that?

611
00:32:18,685 --> 00:32:21,458
Everyone keeps acting like this
horrible thing happened to her.

612
00:32:21,459 --> 00:32:24,699
It didn't just happen.
She did it to herself.

613
00:32:25,137 --> 00:32:27,478
But think about how much
pain she must have been in.

614
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:28,928
Everyone has pain.

615
00:32:29,087 --> 00:32:31,513
But only a selfish bitch checks out

616
00:32:31,514 --> 00:32:33,607
and passes it on to everyone else.

617
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,370
Beth didn't care who she hurt...

618
00:32:35,371 --> 00:32:38,025
her mother, her husband, her daughter!

619
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,355
She didn't have a daughter.

620
00:32:43,716 --> 00:32:45,476
Well, amen for that, at least.

621
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:56,088
Honey, you told me your mom died
when you were young.

622
00:32:57,272 --> 00:32:58,638
You never said how.

623
00:32:59,312 --> 00:33:00,330
Uh-huh.

624
00:33:02,338 --> 00:33:03,840
Did she take her own life?

625
00:33:07,379 --> 00:33:08,561
What do you think?

626
00:33:12,166 --> 00:33:13,235
Damn it.

627
00:33:13,367 --> 00:33:15,601
How hard is it to fill an ice bucket?

628
00:33:16,978 --> 00:33:20,901
You know, I lost a parent
when I was a kid, too... my dad.

629
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:23,859
I'm not making comparisons here,

630
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:26,641
and I understand if you
don't wanna talk about it.

631
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,815
Good, 'cause I don't.

632
00:33:28,931 --> 00:33:30,598
But I think that if you do...

633
00:33:31,816 --> 00:33:32,849
Do what?

634
00:33:32,959 --> 00:33:35,487
I'll feel so much better
if I let it all out?

635
00:33:35,945 --> 00:33:37,160
Well, that doesn't work for me.

636
00:33:37,161 --> 00:33:39,419
I'm not a hug-and-learn kind of gal.

637
00:33:40,553 --> 00:33:41,512
No, I guess you're

638
00:33:41,513 --> 00:33:44,078
a throw-party-and-forget kind of gal.

639
00:33:44,634 --> 00:33:47,928
Look, I will never forget
what my mother did.

640
00:33:48,816 --> 00:33:50,415
I think about it every day.

641
00:33:51,984 --> 00:33:54,756
But I refuse to let it be what defines me.

642
00:33:55,970 --> 00:34:01,499
This spring fling might seem
shallow and insensitive to you,

643
00:34:02,337 --> 00:34:05,122
but it's my way of saying I choose life...

644
00:34:05,316 --> 00:34:06,411
over death.

645
00:34:07,817 --> 00:34:08,912
Now if you'll excuse me,

646
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:11,232
I've gotta get back to my lame-ass party.

647
00:34:13,027 --> 00:34:14,024
Wait.

648
00:34:16,253 --> 00:34:18,098
It's not a lame-ass party anymore...

649
00:34:18,916 --> 00:34:20,104
because I'm here now.

650
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:31,462
0 to 60 in under 5 seconds,

651
00:34:31,463 --> 00:34:34,552
top speed of 160, and no cup holder...

652
00:34:34,553 --> 00:34:36,543
'cause you'll want both hands on the wheel.

653
00:34:38,001 --> 00:34:38,956
Sweet.

654
00:34:38,957 --> 00:34:40,209
Can I take it for a test drive?

655
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:42,975
- Oh, it would be our pleasure.
- Oh!

656
00:34:43,012 --> 00:34:45,474
So is the car for you? Your husband?

657
00:34:45,475 --> 00:34:46,797
Actually, no.

658
00:34:47,466 --> 00:34:48,864
It's for our neighbor.

659
00:34:56,712 --> 00:34:58,180
Hey, sweetie.

660
00:35:01,203 --> 00:35:02,345
Is something wrong?

661
00:35:02,673 --> 00:35:05,031
Guess who's got a brand-new slap in the face

662
00:35:05,032 --> 00:35:08,046
- parked in front of his house?
- What are you talking about?

663
00:35:08,047 --> 00:35:11,747
Carlos. The day after he cries poor to me,

664
00:35:11,748 --> 00:35:15,213
he goes out and buys himself
a $70,000 Lotus?

665
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:18,757
I think the Evora runs around
$76,000, but what do I know?

666
00:35:18,758 --> 00:35:22,143
You were right, Lynette. I'm a pushover.

667
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:24,543
I'm being loyal to a guy who does nothing

668
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:26,682
but look out for himself.

669
00:35:26,683 --> 00:35:28,968
Wow. You must feel really betrayed.

670
00:35:28,969 --> 00:35:31,162
I got half a mind to call Glenn right now

671
00:35:31,163 --> 00:35:32,283
and take that offer.

672
00:35:32,284 --> 00:35:36,684
I say... use your whole mind and do it.

673
00:35:42,789 --> 00:35:43,730
Glenn?

674
00:35:44,644 --> 00:35:45,766
Tom Scavo.

675
00:35:47,539 --> 00:35:49,385
I am in.

676
00:35:49,463 --> 00:35:50,461
Yes!

677
00:35:50,462 --> 00:35:52,994
Yeah, yes! I am excited, too.

678
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,187
Well, you wanna have lunch tomorrow

679
00:35:54,188 --> 00:35:57,604
and hash out the details?
I will see you then.

680
00:35:59,102 --> 00:36:00,283
Feels good, huh?

681
00:36:00,548 --> 00:36:02,391
Feels real good.

682
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:04,432
You know what's gonna feel even better?

683
00:36:04,433 --> 00:36:06,732
Telling Carlos to go screw himself.

684
00:36:08,005 --> 00:36:09,669
No! Wait! Wait!

685
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,775
Don't try and stop me!
I'm gonna tell that guy

686
00:36:11,776 --> 00:36:13,481
just where he can stick his Evora.

687
00:36:13,482 --> 00:36:16,277
Okay, but before you do, it's not Carlos'.

688
00:36:17,945 --> 00:36:19,191
Ahem. I borrowed it from the dealer

689
00:36:19,192 --> 00:36:20,666
and I parked it there.

690
00:36:21,272 --> 00:36:22,995
- What?
- I know. I'm sorry.

691
00:36:22,996 --> 00:36:26,389
It sounds very bad,
but I did it for a very good reason.

692
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:27,925
That you can manipulate me into

693
00:36:27,926 --> 00:36:30,476
- doing whatever you want?
- Carlos didn't buy that car,

694
00:36:30,477 --> 00:36:33,604
but he could have without
even feeling it because...

695
00:36:33,605 --> 00:36:34,353
he's the kind of guy

696
00:36:34,354 --> 00:36:36,226
who doesn't let a good
opportunity get by him.

697
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:38,729
Meanwhile, you're his dutiful number two,

698
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:42,098
staring down the street
at a car you wish you had.

699
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:46,080
Get in. We're taking it back,
then I'm calling Glenn.

700
00:36:46,081 --> 00:36:48,853
- Just one...
- Get in.

701
00:37:02,786 --> 00:37:07,752
Tom, this could be you... driving this car,

702
00:37:07,753 --> 00:37:09,696
living this life,

703
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:11,790
being that guy.

704
00:37:13,529 --> 00:37:16,249
I understand if you wanna
say no to all that,

705
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:18,271
but I don't even think
you've asked yourself,

706
00:37:18,272 --> 00:37:19,824
do I want it?

707
00:37:20,358 --> 00:37:23,342
It would be better
if you didn't talk right now.

708
00:37:28,203 --> 00:37:29,235
Whoa.

709
00:37:38,091 --> 00:37:40,169
I can't tell if we are gonna drive...

710
00:37:41,045 --> 00:37:42,461
or fly.

711
00:38:11,083 --> 00:38:13,241
What time does this have to be back?

712
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:17,221
He said 4:00, but
they don't close till 6:00.

713
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:19,892
I'm guessing we could be a little late.

714
00:38:20,552 --> 00:38:23,532
Yeah. Let's be a little late.

715
00:38:35,731 --> 00:38:36,844
Hello, Susan.

716
00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:40,453
Would it be okay if I came in for a moment?

717
00:38:40,454 --> 00:38:41,947
Uh, actually, I was...

718
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:47,627
Sure.

719
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,565
I've never been to your apartment.

720
00:38:53,027 --> 00:38:55,990
Yeah, well, it's not much.

721
00:38:56,202 --> 00:38:58,163
No, it's-it's quite nice.

722
00:39:00,169 --> 00:39:02,541
I'm on my way to the hospital to see Beth...

723
00:39:02,708 --> 00:39:03,884
to say good-bye.

724
00:39:04,522 --> 00:39:05,797
I've alerted the transplant office

725
00:39:05,798 --> 00:39:08,318
that we'll be moving
forward with her request.

726
00:39:08,964 --> 00:39:10,280
I'm sure as soon as I sign the papers,

727
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:11,915
they'll be contacting you.

728
00:39:14,189 --> 00:39:15,769
I don't understand.

729
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:17,787
You're getting your kidney.

730
00:39:19,551 --> 00:39:20,440
I thought you said...

731
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:21,369
Susan...

732
00:39:23,969 --> 00:39:26,405
I would be very grateful
to you if you could...

733
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:28,803
forget a lot of the things that I said.

734
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,566
You were right, Paul.

735
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:35,614
I was terrible to Beth. I was.

736
00:39:35,968 --> 00:39:37,935
I never gave her a chance.

737
00:39:38,597 --> 00:39:40,724
I never tried to get to know her.

738
00:39:41,787 --> 00:39:46,395
Why would she do this for me

739
00:39:46,436 --> 00:39:48,868
when I did nothing to deserve it?

740
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,052
Beth didn't love people
because they deserved it.

741
00:39:53,686 --> 00:39:56,064
Believe me. I know that.

742
00:39:56,979 --> 00:39:58,836
I'm so confused. I...

743
00:40:00,276 --> 00:40:02,027
I don't know if I can accept.

744
00:40:02,028 --> 00:40:04,268
Please... honor Beth's life

745
00:40:04,269 --> 00:40:06,165
by allowing her to make you well,

746
00:40:07,258 --> 00:40:08,445
for your son...

747
00:40:08,803 --> 00:40:09,943
for your family...

748
00:40:11,654 --> 00:40:12,873
for your friends.

749
00:40:18,857 --> 00:40:19,895
Okay.

750
00:40:22,076 --> 00:40:23,092
Thank you.

751
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,176
Paul...

752
00:40:26,177 --> 00:40:27,101
Yes?

753
00:40:31,623 --> 00:40:33,079
I am so...

754
00:40:35,233 --> 00:40:38,675
very, very sorry about your wife.

755
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:41,933
Yes.

756
00:40:44,077 --> 00:40:45,322
I am, too.

757
00:40:57,917 --> 00:41:02,174
<i>There comes a moment
when our lives change forever...</i>

758
00:41:04,526 --> 00:41:07,446
<i>the moment we admit our weaknesses...</i>

759
00:41:10,287 --> 00:41:13,384
<i>the moment we rise to a challenge...</i>

760
00:41:16,594 --> 00:41:19,479
<i>the moment we accept a sacrifice...</i>

761
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:26,845
<i>or let a loved one go.</i>

762
00:41:30,581 --> 00:41:32,306
<i>And sometimes...</i>

763
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:35,900
<i>the change in our lives...</i>

764
00:41:36,835 --> 00:41:39,994
<i>is an answer to our prayers.</i>

765
00:41:39,995 --> 00:41:41,120
Ms. Tillman?

766
00:41:41,953 --> 00:41:45,459
Thought I'd find you here.
So sorry for your loss.

767
00:41:46,184 --> 00:41:47,712
Thank you, Warden.

768
00:41:47,898 --> 00:41:50,507
I'm sure this is small consolation,

769
00:41:50,688 --> 00:41:52,801
but I've just heard from the parole board.

770
00:41:52,822 --> 00:41:54,297
They've decided to grant your request

771
00:41:54,298 --> 00:41:56,114
for humanitarian release.

772
00:41:58,181 --> 00:41:59,651
Ironic, isn't it?

773
00:42:00,254 --> 00:42:03,120
My daughter had to die so I could go free.

774
00:42:03,742 --> 00:42:05,715
Again, my condolences.

775
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:21,900
