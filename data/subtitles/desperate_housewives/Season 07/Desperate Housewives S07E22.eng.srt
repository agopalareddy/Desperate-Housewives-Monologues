1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,570
Previously on Desperate Housewives.

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:06,540
Bree's new romance got off to a lively start...

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,170
- So you're courting me. - I'm trying to.

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:10,840
When will you stop playing hard to get?

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,790
Maybe when you stop playing hard to want.

6
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:15,380
While Lynette's marriage hit the rocks.

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,620
I think we're the ones who need a vacation--

8
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:22,280
Just a weekend, get a chance to work through all of this.



9
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:23,720
Susan's warning...

10
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,110
About those cookies I made--

11
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,880
Don't eat them. They're poisoned.

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,370
That's her, officers.

13
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,770
Became an admission of guilt.

14
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,780
And Gaby was unaware...

15
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,830
That a dark presence

16
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,740
Had arrived on the lane.

17
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:52,230
Susan Delfino had always played by the rules.

18
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,210
She obeyed every label...

19
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,720
She performed her civic duty...

20
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:06,730
She respected all legal boundaries...

21
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,890
So when she was questioned

22
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,220
About the poisoning of Paul Young...

23
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,160
Please state your name and age.

24
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,160
Susan was more than a little upset.

25
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:21,660
My age? What does my age have to do with it?

26
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,480
Mrs. Delfino...

27
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,960
I'm 38.

28
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,060
Am I under oath?

29
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,680
- No. - 38.

30
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,270
I don't think you appreciate

31
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,460
The seriousness of the position you're in.

32
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,450
You could have killed someone at that school.

33
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:40,180
But I didn't poison the cookies.

34
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,860
Yet you knew they were poisoned.

35
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:45,710
Yes, by Felicia Tillman. I mean...

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,370
Okay, I baked them, but she added the poison.

37
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,640
That was your arrangement?

38
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,710
No! No, we didn't have an arrangement.

39
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:56,510
She was trying to murder Paul Young.

40
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,560
So all you did was deliver the poisoned food?

41
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,160
Exactly.

42
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:03,640
No, wait, uh...

43
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,530
No, I had no idea that anything was poisoned, ever.

44
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,460
Except the cookies.

45
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,670
Except the cookies.

46
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,360
Look, talk to Felicia. She hated Paul.

47
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,720
Yes, but you had your reasons for hating Mr. Young, too.

48
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,220
No, I like Paul. His wife gave me her kidney.

49
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,630
After you lost your kidney

50
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,670
in a riot which Mr. Young was responsible for.

51
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,770
Who told you that?

52
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,120
Mr. Young.

53
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,280
He also said he blew the whistle on your internet porn career,

54
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,850
Causing you to lose your job at the Oakridge school,

55
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:44,880
The same school you brought those poisoned cookies to.

56
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,880
Now how about you start telling me the truth?

57
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,710
I'm not 38.

58
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,200
Find anything?

59
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,430
Okay, thanks.

60
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,930
We found a glass vial and some syringes

61
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:16,000
in the dumpster behind your apartment.

62
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,510
They all had traces of antifreeze.

63
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,890
Oh, god.

64
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:25,590
Yes, Susan Delfino had always played by the rules...

65
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,550
But she was about to find out...

66
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,790
This wasn't a game.

67
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,730
Sometimes

68
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,960
It's the little things that make us feel secure,

69
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,050
Like an old friend at bedtime...

70
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,050
Money saved for a rainy day...

71
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,660
Or matching coffee mugs.

72
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:08,400
But there are times when these small comforts

73
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:11,300
are up against big challenges.

74
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,710
I'm glad we're doing this.

75
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,880
Me, too.

76
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,680
Should have done it a long time ago.

77
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,340
Ha. Completely agree.

78
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:22,260
We just needed to get away from everything, just the two of us--

79
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,870
No kids, no work, no TV...

80
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,190
What? No TV?

81
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:31,210
Aw, come on. It's a b&b-- bed-and-baseball.

82
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,280
You gonna take this seriously?

83
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,990
Yes.

84
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,330
I'm taking this very seriously.

85
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,420
Okay.

86
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,300
So what do you feel like doing? You want to go to bed, or...

87
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:55,200
Bed sounds good. I'm exhausted. Ooh...

88
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,760
U-u-unless you want to--

89
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,700
No. No.

90
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,380
I'm tired, too.

91
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:01,880
Let's get a good night's sleep.

92
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,780
We have the whole weekend ahead of us.

93
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,030
It's gonna be great.

94
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,550
It's gonna be great.

95
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:28,120
Thanks for dinner. That was amazing.

96
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:29,960
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

97
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,070
You kidding? I got to chase

98
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,770
Twice as many bad guys tomorrow to burn it off.

99
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,420
Good night, Chuck.

100
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,700
Good night, Bree.

101
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:50,900
That is the one part of dating that I haven't missed.

102
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,320
I know, the whole question of intimacy.

103
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,460
Will he kiss me? Will he not?

104
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,430
Will she be mad if I try?

105
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,910
Will she be mad if I don't?

106
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,300
Then why don't we skip all that

107
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,430
and lay our cards on the table?

108
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,320
Sounds like something that two reasonable adults might do.

109
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,600
I find you very... attractive.

110
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,230
And I think you're a knockout.

111
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:14,660
Really?

112
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,530
Yeah, that's why...

113
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,880
It's so hard...

114
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,410
Wow, we really are putting our cards on the table.

115
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:23,860
To wait.

116
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:26,350
Wait?

117
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:31,180
Um, just till my divorce goes through, 'cause till then,

118
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:35,100
I'm technically married, so anything we do is adultery.

119
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,730
You know what? I think that's very admirable.

120
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,880
Yeah?

121
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,390
Definitely. It's refreshing to find

122
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:45,300
a man whose morality isn't compromised by his libido.

123
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:49,160
Besides, sometimes waiting can be half the fun.

124
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,990
And just so you know what it is you're waiting for...

125
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:05,220
Now that's the part of dating I have missed.

126
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:18,940
See you tomorrow night.

127
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,570
How can they arrest me? I didn't do anything.

128
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:38,040
They found syringes and antifreeze at your house.

129
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,480
Unless you're a suicidal diabetic,

130
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,680
that's pretty suspicious.

131
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,760
But Felicia was at my house when I was making Paul's food.

132
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,900
Clearly, she's trying to frame me.

133
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:46,620
Any way to prove it?

134
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,950
The woman hacked off two of her fingers

135
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,510
to frame someone else.

136
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,180
She's a framer.

137
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,270
To implicate Felicia, we'd need some evidence

138
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,500
that she was actively trying to kill Paul.

139
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,640
I might be able to help you with that.

140
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,870
A few months ago, Felicia called me from prison,

141
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,390
said she needed to see me.

142
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,550
You never told me this.

143
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,440
I didn't know what it was about, so I went.

144
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,020
she offered me $10,000 to kill Paul.

145
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,380
What?

146
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,530
This was in the visitor's room? On the phone?

147
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,260
I'll see if they have any recordings.

148
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,760
Might take a day or two.

149
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,680
This is good.

150
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,250
How could you keep that from me?

151
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:37,040
I don't know. I... guess I was ashamed.

152
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,850
Why? Y-you said no.

153
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:42,070
Yeah, after I thought about it for a week.

154
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,320
You actually considered--

155
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,000
Come on, Susan. With the financial problems

156
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,130
we were having? And you got to remember,

157
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:50,840
there was a time I would have killed Paul for free.

158
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,650
2-minute warning till bath time.

159
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,090
Hello?

160
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,560
Hi, honey. How was your flight?

161
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,380
Yeah, hold on.

162
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,190
Sweetie? It's your dad calling from his business trip.

163
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:14,090
The sound you're hearing is your daughter in a cartoon coma.

164
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,240
Juanita!

165
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,700
Hi, daddy.

166
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,900
Okay, daddy, I love you, too.

167
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,000
Bring me something.

168
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,150
Unh-unh. Upstairs.

169
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,010
Okay, honey. Love you, too.

170
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:39,920
Bring me something.

171
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,890
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.

172
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:01,020
Gaby, what are you doing here?

173
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,430
Carlos doesn't want us seeing each other,

174
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:03,730
and I really don't think we should--

175
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:04,320
I need a gun.

176
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,860
Well, I guess I could spare a moment.

177
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,230
Why on earth do you need a gun?

178
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,650
Juanita swears she's been seeing

179
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:16,360
this mystery man skulking around our lawn at night,

180
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,050
and last night, I think I saw him, too.

181
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,100
Did you call the police?

182
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:19,850
And say what?

183
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:21,260
There's a guy on the lawn?

184
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,650
Look, Carlos is out of town, and I'll sleep better

185
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:24,880
if I have a gun in the nightstand.

186
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,770
Gaby, I'm not giving you a gun.

187
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:28,860
Why not? I let you borrow things all the time.

188
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,000
Not things that put holes in people.

189
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,910
Come on. Just a little one--

190
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,320
The kind Nancy Reagan would shoot people with.

191
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:35,590
No.

192
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,740
Please. I'll be really careful.

193
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,390
This guy's kind of freaking me out.

194
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,610
Gaby, if you're really serious,

195
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,460
I will set you up with a class at my gun range,

196
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,070
they'll teach you about gun safety,

197
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:46,770
you will get a permit,

198
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:49,110
and then we'll see about getting you a gun.

199
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,700
Great. So in the meantime,

200
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,590
if skulking guy breaks into my house,

201
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,580
I'm just gonna yell,

202
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,560
"Freeze! I'm taking a class!"

203
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:06,660
Hello?

204
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,720
Ms. Tillman?

205
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,330
This is detective Hank Powell of the Fairview Police Department.

206
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,440
Hello, officer. Is there something I can help you with?

207
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,220
We'd like you to come down to the station.

208
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,060
We need to ask you a few questions.

209
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,950
May I ask what this is about?

210
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,470
We'll explain it all when you get here.

211
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:29,600
Or if that's a problem,

212
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,280
we could have somebody come get you.

213
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,870
No. Thank you.

214
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:38,450
I'll handle my own transportation.

215
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,190
So there's a place in town where you can make your own candles.

216
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,890
Candle making?

217
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:51,710
Hopefully,

218
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,430
It's next to a place where we can make our own bullets.

219
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,080
Yeah. Does sound pretty lame.

220
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,620
Besides, we didn't come here to do arts and crafts.

221
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:03,120
Right. We came here to work on stuff...

222
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,540
talk.

223
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:09,840
So... maybe we should go back to our room and...

224
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,320
talk.

225
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:15,940
Hey there. Good morning.

226
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,740
Morning.

227
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,180
Good morning.

228
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,500
Hi. I'm Lisa.

229
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,930
This is my husband Andy.

230
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:23,960
Oh, hi. I'm Lynette. Nice to meet you.

231
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,500
You, too.

232
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,070
- Tom. - Nice to meet you.

233
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:29,160
- So is this your first time here? - Oh. Thank you, sweetie.

234
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,830
Yep, first time.

235
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:34,080
Ohh. It's our third time. We love it here.

236
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,440
And it's so quiet and intimate.

237
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,750
What could be better, right?

238
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,910
- Right. - You said it.

239
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,140
- So what are you guys up to today? - I don't know.

240
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,890
We'll probably just hang out. What about you guys?

241
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,100
We are going candle dipping.

242
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:50,670
Any chance you want to come with?

243
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:53,150
Oh, Andy, I'm sure they came up here to be alone.

244
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,680
I don't-- I don't know...

245
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,000
Sounds like it... could be fun.

246
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,320
Yeah. We can be alone later.

247
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,850
Let's go dip some candles.

248
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,310
You know I can't talk to you.

249
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,540
Think about it. Of all the people that want you dead,

250
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,340
you think Susan's the one to do it?

251
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,090
She's the only person in this neighborhood who's stuck by you.

252
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,200
You heard the evidence.

253
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,880
All the food came from your kitchen.

254
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,260
And you know who was helping Susan cook it?

255
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:25,960
Felicia Tillman.

256
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,070
What?

257
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:30,980
The same woman who offered me $10,000 to kill you.

258
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:35,040
She offered you $10,000 to kill me?

259
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,120
What did you say?

260
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,850
You're still standing here.

261
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,160
Believe me now?

262
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,210
So tell me, how do you know

263
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:08,120
that guy I saw leaving here last night?

264
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,300
His name is Chuck, he's a detective,

265
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,240
and he and I have been seeing each other.

266
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:17,740
Seeing? As in dating?

267
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,790
You sound surprised.

268
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:21,410
Well, I don't like spreading vicious gossip...

269
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,800
Oh, who am I kidding? I love it. Bree...

270
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,720
that guy is gay.

271
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,930
You say that about everyone. You said that about Tom Scavo.

272
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,950
I didn't say he was gay. I said if I had magic powers,

273
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,030
I would make him gay.

274
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,640
But as far as detective hottie goes,

275
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,640
I've seen him at my favorite gay bar.

276
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,640
No. I am sure it wasn't him.

277
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,370
I'm sure it was. I never forget a gay face.

278
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,660
I have what scientists call

279
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,510
a homo-graphic memory.

280
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:48,260
Chuck was married for 18 years.

281
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,980
"Was"? Interesting.

282
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,400
Failed marriage. Let's connect those dots.

283
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:54,740
Okay, then explain why he's the one chasing me.

284
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,610
He's a cop. It's a very masculine culture,

285
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,670
and now that he can't hide behind his wife anymore,

286
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,250
he needs a girlfriend,

287
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,800
so he's still "One of the guys."

288
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,910
- Let's drop it. - Okay, tell me I'm wrong.

289
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:07,320
Tell me you've had the best sex you've ever had.

290
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,120
You have had sex?

291
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,380
He said he wanted to wait.

292
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,000
Okay, I'm calling it.

293
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,710
Time of gay--11:21.

294
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,940
- There's just something about Italian food. - Yeah.

295
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:29,160
But I cannot believe how much I ate. It was so good.

296
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,600
It was awesome, and thank you both.

297
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,600
Yeah, you didn't have to pay for dinner...

298
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:34,670
Or lunch...

299
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,350
Or our candle making lessons.

300
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,840
It was my pleasure. What's the point

301
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,300
of making the big bucks if you can't spread it around?

302
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,600
Please, stop saying "Big bucks."

303
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,420
I haven't said it that much.

304
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,630
If I had a nickel for every time you've said "Big bucks,"

305
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,250
I'd have big bucks.

306
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:57,190
- It's getting late. - Yeah, we should really let you guys go.

307
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,300
Late? It's only 10:00.

308
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,900
Hey, who's up for a game of spades?

309
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,960
Come on, Lisa. Boys against girls.

310
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,410
Let's kick some butt.

311
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:12,180
- Okay. Great. - Okay. Yeah.

312
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:17,050
So it is 3:00 A.M. I am creeping down the stairs in my underwear,

313
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:19,350
holding the golf club like a machete.

314
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:22,360
I hear the noise again, coming from the kitchen.

315
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,690
Turns out, it's our daughter Penny,

316
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:26,270
who's waiting to get the Easter bunny's autograph.

317
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,260
That's cute.

318
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:29,680
What?

319
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,320
You always do that. I'm--I'm--I'm telling a story,

320
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,420
and you jump in and steal the punch line.

321
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,480
'cause you go on forever.

322
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,800
You heard a noise, you checked it out, turns out it's Penny.

323
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,880
Laugh, laugh, laugh.

324
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,370
Everybody's the same age as when the story started.

325
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:45,260
Well, my apologies, everybody.

326
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:48,950
I am sorry I am not a gifted raconteur like my wife.

327
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,560
What can I say, Tom?

328
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,630
I actually do know how to tell a story.

329
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,180
Yeah, like that spellbinder you told the guy

330
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,250
at the candle shop today

331
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,330
about growing winter squash? One more second,

332
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:00,050
he was ready to pour molten wax directly into his ears.

333
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:01,300
Oh, you heard that story?

334
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,330
I figured you were busy counting your big bucks.

335
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:09,960
Sheesh, it's midnight already.

336
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,370
Yeah, we better get some sleep.

337
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:12,380
We got a big day tomorrow.

338
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,170
Oh, yeah? What are you guys doing?

339
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:17,510
Nothing.

340
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,500
- Good night, you guys. - Good night.

341
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,210
- Good night. - Good night.

342
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,900
Well, I think I'm gonna turn in, too.

343
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,520
You coming?

344
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:38,470
Nah, I'm gonna check out some scores on the TV.

345
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,080
Okay.

346
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,280
Hello. Are you ready for our lunch date?

347
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,850
I tried to call you.

348
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:03,890
I got to interview a robbery witness.

349
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,690
- I'm really sorry. - It's not your fault,

350
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:08,140
And as luck would have it, I'm free for dinner, too.

351
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:12,480
Great. Hey. Hey, guys, say hi to Bree.

352
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:13,980
- Hi. - Hey, Bree.

353
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,390
See? I wasn't making her up. I'll see you tonight.

354
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:22,800
He's processing now.

355
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,680
He's in the holding cell. Be up in about 40, 45 minutes.

356
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:27,560
Great picture of Chuck, huh?

357
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,290
Yeah. Yeah. Who's, uh, that with him?

358
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,300
Well, that was his partner, Pete Crowley.

359
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,870
Oh. Are Chuck and Pete still partners?

360
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:38,390
No. Pete's not here anymore.

361
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:42,420
I hope it wasn't, uh, something tragic.

362
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:44,730
No, not tragic. Just...

363
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:47,480
weird.

364
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,050
Excuse me.

365
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,170
They were best friends and partners for nine years,

366
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:01,480
and then last year they went on a camping trip together.

367
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,560
When they got back, they weren't speaking,

368
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,910
Pete put in for a transfer,

369
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,270
and no one on the force knows what happened.

370
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,520
It's beyond obvious.

371
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,430
Chuck must have had a huge crush on this guy.

372
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:13,310
You think he was in love with his partner?

373
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:13,910
Please.

374
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:16,430
I'm in love with him, and I've only seen his picture.

375
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,860
He picks a total hottie for a partner,

376
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,260
then sits on his feelings for nine years, until...

377
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,950
the camping trip.

378
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,690
They're in the woods,

379
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:30,730
in a tent, alone.

380
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:33,850
Couple of beers, then bam, Chuck pounces,

381
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:35,740
and his partner's all like, "Stop.

382
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,450
"What are you doing? Get off me."

383
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:43,130
Oh, god. It's me and Todd Mankiewicz

384
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:43,650
all over again.

385
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,570
This is ridiculous. Chuck is not gay,

386
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:47,610
and I am gonna prove it.

387
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,520
- How? - He's taking me to dinner tonight,

388
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,540
and I may just have to offer myself up as dessert.

389
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,700
Do whatever you want. Just forward me this picture.

390
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,430
I've got some photoshopping to do.

391
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:04,340
Our policy here is ask questions first,

392
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,530
shoot later.

393
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:08,520
You will know everything there is to know about a firearm

394
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,380
before ever actually holding one.

395
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,110
What's there to know? You point, you shoot,

396
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,790
somebody bad falls down.

397
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,130
Ms. Solis,

398
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:18,920
mind if I ask why it is you're taking this class?

399
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,860
To protect myself.

400
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,010
Protection. Why a gun?

401
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:24,500
Why not just get a dog?

402
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:26,830
Well, for one, if you leave a gun in the house,

403
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,470
it doesn't rip apart your throw pillows

404
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,520
then leave a gift on your hall carpet.

405
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,340
Could you shoot me?

406
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:36,930
What?

407
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:39,810
I'm an intruder that just broke into your home.

408
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,020
Could you shoot me?

409
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,670
Uh, sure. Why not?

410
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:47,050
Really? Where? The head? Chest?

411
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,500
I don't know. Why are you getting so close?

412
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,970
I'm an intruder. I'm here to hurt you.

413
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:52,090
Could you point the gun,

414
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:53,450
fire it, and kill me--

415
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,930
and then live with that the rest of your life?

416
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,760
No.

417
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,600
If any of you feel the same way, leave now.

418
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,340
A gun in the hands of someone who is afraid to use it

419
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:10,150
is the most dangerous weapon in the world--

420
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:11,980
Not for your intended victim...

421
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:14,740
for you.

422
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,300
Susan.

423
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,580
I wanted to thank you.

424
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,700
I heard that you spoke to the police and helped clear me.

425
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,200
I'm sorry I doubted you.

426
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,730
I guess I'm not used to people being kind to me.

427
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:40,470
What's goin' on?

428
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,650
I can't stay here.

429
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,930
But Felicia's gone. You're safe now.

430
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,960
This has nothing to do with Felicia.

431
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,870
It's just time for me to go.

432
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,410
Paul, y-you can't leave the lane.

433
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,000
You belong here.

434
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,430
No, I don't. I never have.

435
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:02,110
Well, that's not true. When I first moved here,

436
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:04,080
you and Mary Alice were so nice to me.

437
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,200
You were the reason I wanted to live here.

438
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,820
We had to be nice. We came here running away

439
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,540
from something terrible we'd done.

440
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,240
We spent every day

441
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,330
waiting for the past to catch up with us.

442
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,180
And it did.

443
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,590
Sooner or later, the past always catches up.

444
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,600
That was a long time ago.

445
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,910
You have a chance to start over now.

446
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:27,180
And you... were the only one around here

447
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,730
who ever thought I could start over.

448
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:30,880
I still do.

449
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:33,140
You're a good person, Paul.

450
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,850
I truly believe that.

451
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:35,830
I know...

452
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:38,620
And I'd just as soon leave while you still do.

453
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,850
Here, take these.

454
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,290
Move back in with your family.

455
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:48,300
As far as the rest of the rent...

456
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,550
it's my gift to you.

457
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,000
I don't know how to thank you.

458
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,700
Just be happy here.

459
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,500
We will.

460
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,650
You know, it's not even 10:00 yet.

461
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:12,470
Are you up for a nightcap?

462
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:15,680
Sure. I know this fabulous little spot.

463
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,930
Fabulous.

464
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,590
Actually, I was hoping we could go back

465
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:24,240
to your place.

466
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,790
Um, I don't--I don't think that's a good idea.

467
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,030
Really?

468
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,140
What are you afraid of?

469
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,720
I'm not sure I could trust myself.

470
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:37,430
Remember our agreement?

471
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,660
Oh, are we really sticking to that?

472
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:44,390
Look, I... I have to.

473
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,660
Okay.

474
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,380
But I still want that nightcap.

475
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:53,770
Where to?

476
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:56,600
I know just the place.

477
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:00,320
Bree, are you--are you sure you want to come in here?

478
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,120
'cause I think this is a gay bar.

479
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,940
Really? And how would you know that?

480
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,390
Okay, um...

481
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,550
There's something I need to tell you.

482
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:10,410
Hey, girlfriend! Where you been hiding yourself?

483
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:11,530
Hey, Terrence.

484
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:13,150
Wait until you hear the dish...

485
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,400
Steve and fat Steve broke up.

486
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,560
And fat Steve is now pissed Steve.

487
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,410
I'm--I'm--I'm sorry to hear that.

488
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:24,360
Okay, so this is what I wanted to talk to you about.

489
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,400
Chuck...

490
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,490
I already know.

491
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:30,630
My neighbor saw you here.

492
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:31,760
Oh, god.

493
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,360
It's okay. My son is gay.

494
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,610
I have lots of gay friends.

495
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:35,990
I love the gays!

496
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:37,490
I just don't date them.

497
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,780
Bree, I'm not gay.

498
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:41,580
Hey, Studly.

499
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,340
Haven't seen you in a while.

500
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,760
Well, here's your usual.

501
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,440
I'm sorry. I'm out of umbrellas.

502
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:52,530
They know me because I worked here undercover.

503
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,950
- Really?  - Yes. Some guys here were dealing drugs,

504
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:58,220
so to blend in, I pretended to be gay.

505
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,080
And I was good at it.

506
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,010
Chuck, you don't need to lie.

507
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:07,420
I can imagine how hard it must be to be a gay cop.

508
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:09,860
Especially after what happened with your partner.

509
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,670
My--my partner? You mean Peter?

510
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,150
What do you know about that?

511
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,630
Well, I know you two split up

512
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:21,470
after you went on vacation together.

513
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,540
Were you in love with him?

514
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,670
I can't talk about this here.

515
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:30,880
Come on.

516
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,830
I did love Pete Crowley like a brother.

517
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,480
And I loved my wife, too.

518
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:42,670
At least I did...

519
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:45,000
until the camping trip when Pete told me

520
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,200
they'd been sleeping together six months.

521
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,990
Your partner and your wife?

522
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:52,000
Why didn't you tell me?

523
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,930
I'm a detective. I'm supposed to notice things.

524
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,500
But if your wife is the one who cheated,

525
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,490
why is she holding up the divorce?

526
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,340
Part of me thinks she's dragging it out

527
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:02,580
so I'll screw around before it's over--

528
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,140
so she can say I'm no better than her.

529
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,250
But I am better than her.

530
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:11,660
And that's why I wanna get things right this time.

531
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,160
So you're really not gay?

532
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,360
What do you think?

533
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:34,530
Fabulous.

534
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,820
Brandon to the service deli, please.

535
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,530
Brandon to the service deli.

536
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,580
Oh, my god!

537
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,480
This is why kids shouldn't play with cans.

538
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,640
Checkstand 1 is now open.

539
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,730
Checkstand 1 is now open, taking all customers.

540
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,350
Excuse me.

541
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:45,220
Do you have a security camera?

542
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,940
I'm confused--you say someone took your pocketbook,

543
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,480
But isn't that your pocketbook?

544
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:55,220
This is my purse.

545
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,410
- Men. - Sorry.

546
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:58,810
I do the same thing to my wife.

547
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,050
I say "Nice shirt."

548
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:00,870
She says "It's a blouse."

549
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:02,250
I say "I like your trousers." She says--

550
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,060
Stop!

551
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:06,010
Can you go closer?

552
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:09,100
Okay. But he's not holding a pocketbook.

553
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,170
Oh, my god.

554
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,940
Are you all right?

555
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:18,190
That's my stepfather.

556
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,480
You sound surprised to see him.

557
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:24,540
He's supposed to be dead.

558
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,760
Pretty damn good.

559
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:34,410
Got to admit, I'm surprised to see you back here.

560
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:36,330
I thought you said you couldn't kill anybody.

561
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:37,330
Got over it.

562
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,450
No, Tom,

563
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:49,400
Texting the office is the same as calling the office.

564
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,980
Come on. You know that.

565
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,580
Oh, god, it's them.

566
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,710
- But my coffee--honey-- - Leave it.

567
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:59,290
- Hey there! Top of the morning! - Oh! Hi. Yeah, good morning.

568
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:01,040
- How's it going? - Hi. Good morning.

569
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:04,240
Mwah. I hope you guys like apples,

570
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:06,750
Because we found a pick-your-own apple orchard.

571
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:07,890
Oh, you know, actually,

572
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:09,870
We're heading into town to do some antiquing.

573
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:12,990
Ooh! Sounds great. We love antiquing.

574
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:15,960
Yeah... I think we're gonna go by ourselves.

575
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:19,950
Ouch.

576
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:21,460
Are you guys blowing us off?

577
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,700
No.

578
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,800
No, it's just that we wanted to, um,

579
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,100
buy one of those old folding screens,

580
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:29,950
and our backseat is so small, and you--

581
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:31,240
Lisa.

582
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,810
Yeah, we're blowing you off.

583
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:35,760
Why?

584
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,480
Look, we get it. You guys can't stand to be alone.

585
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,140
But that's the whole reason we came here, so...

586
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:44,680
nice hanging out with you, but... see ya.

587
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,560
And good luck.

588
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,310
Wh-wh-what do you mean, "Good luck"?

589
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,780
You know, with...

590
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,090
whatever it is you're workin' through.

591
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:34,660
Man, this rain is just not gonna stop, huh?

592
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,850
They said it might go into tonight.

593
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:42,250
Oh, yeah?

594
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,540
Yeah.

595
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,000
That's what they said on the radio.

596
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,700
So total strangers think we're in trouble.

597
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:58,850
Do you think we're in trouble?

598
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,110
What do you think?

599
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:05,300
All I know is, 20 years ago, if you'd put us

600
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:08,410
in a beautiful room with a fireplace and a big bed

601
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:11,230
and it rained all day...

602
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,590
we wouldn't be talking about the weather.

603
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,810
I go--I gotta get out of this room.

604
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:34,970
I'm just--I'm starting to lose my mind.

605
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:36,460
- You wanna take a walk? - What?

606
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,970
Do you wanna take a walk?

607
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:39,680
It's a mess out there. It's pouring.

608
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,260
Well, don't snap at me, Tom. Snap at the rain.

609
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:46,260
God. It's like you're not even trying.

610
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,020
Me? I'm not trying?

611
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,960
From where I sit, you're not.

612
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:54,520
What do you call this?

613
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,490
What is this?

614
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:59,390
It's your engagement ring--

615
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:02,790
The crappy one I gave you a million years ago.

616
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,870
You changed the diamond.

617
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,260
I told you I'd give you a decent ring someday.

618
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:18,740
There it is.

619
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,140
What's the matter?

620
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:32,140
I appreciate this. I really do.

621
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:33,880
But...

622
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,670
I loved the ring the way it was.

623
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,150
Really?

624
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,860
'cause I seem to remember you making a joke about it

625
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:43,300
every single time you showed it to somebody.

626
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,280
I did?

627
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:52,150
I-I did.

628
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:57,370
But that doesn't mean I didn't love it.

629
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:00,830
Lynette, I did this to make you happy,

630
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:02,810
but I'm running out of ideas!

631
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:10,550
I can't do this anymore.

632
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:21,130
We have survived five kids,

633
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:23,860
a failed business, cancer.

634
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:28,830
Why can't we pull out of this one?

635
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:32,500
I don't know what you want.

636
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,700
I don't know what I want.

637
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:45,880
I just know it isn't this.

638
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,840
There you go.

639
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,050
Wakey-wakey.

640
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,920
Now I'm gonna take this off,

641
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,850
but if you start screaming for help,

642
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:14,750
I will have no choice but to plunge this

643
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:17,370
directly into your heart,

644
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,180
killing you instantly.

645
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:25,730
Oh, that'll kill you, too, but a lot more slowly,

646
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,520
giving the three of us a chance to chat.

647
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,490
What do you mean, "The three of us"?

648
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:36,250
Who's here?

649
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,630
Why, Beth, of course.

650
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,930
I knew she wouldn't want to miss this.

651
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:48,130
Fine. Kill me. You won't get away with it.

652
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:50,050
The police know you've been poisoning me.

653
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:54,350
But thanks to you, they think I'm miles away.

654
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,310
But I'm not.

655
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,480
I'm right here.

656
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:07,200
You know, I'm kinda gonna miss this place.

657
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,340
Yeah. The sound of german techno music from 3B.

658
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:13,170
Smell of corned beef and cabbage from 2C.

659
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:15,950
The fat guy-- or is it a woman?--in 5D.

660
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,380
Actually, I'm not gonna miss this place.

661
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:21,180
- Hey, Where's this go? - Oh, M.J.'s toys are here.

662
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:24,150
Hey, you know what would be a great idea?

663
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:26,160
If when he walks in to his old room tomorrow,

664
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,840
all of his favorite things are already there?

665
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,070
Yeah, he'd love that. I'll run 'em over right now.

666
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:32,240
No, no, no. You keep packing. I'll go.

667
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:38,900
You disappoint me, Paul.

668
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,950
Is this really how you wanna spend your last moments?

669
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:43,580
Sitting here shooting me dirty looks

670
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:47,510
as if I didn't already know you dislike me.

671
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,970
What would you prefer?

672
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,050
Some remorse. A little repentance.

673
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:55,830
Emotions appropriate to a man who killed an innocent woman.

674
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:59,150
Innocent? Your sister blackmailed my wife--

675
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:01,010
Drove her to suicide.

676
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:05,040
It isn't Martha's fault that Mary Alice shot herself,

677
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,510
Like all your wives seem to.

678
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,230
If you're gonna keep talking, Felicia,

679
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:11,310
would you mind upping my dose?

680
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:16,510
Just tell me you're sorry! Is it really so hard to say?

681
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:18,830
I'm not sorry.

682
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:21,300
I wasn't then, and I'm not now.

683
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:24,670
When I saw the life drain out of Martha's mean little eyes,

684
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:28,040
I knew she was getting exactly what she deserved.

685
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:31,490
So there it is.

686
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:42,110
When I watched the life drain

687
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:44,480
out of Martha's mean little eyes,

688
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:47,730
I knew she was getting exactly what she deserved.

689
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:51,990
So you have a confession.

690
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,940
What are they gonna do, arrest my corpse?

691
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,150
No.

692
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,860
But when the police find your body,

693
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:02,400
they'll find this.

694
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:06,960
And the world will stop thinking I was crazy all these years.

695
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,580
Felicia...

696
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:12,500
There's one thing I'll go to my grave sure of--

697
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:15,820
The world will never stop thinking you're crazy.

698
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:50,520
Getting scared, Paul?

699
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,040
This poison--

700
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:54,580
How much longer before it kills me?

701
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,890
Not long.

702
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:57,610
30 minutes or so.

703
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,410
9-1-1. State your emergency.

704
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:13,630
There's a killer loose in my house.

705
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:16,320
4353 Wisteria Lane. Send police...

706
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,570
And an ambulance. Hurry!

707
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:33,100
Ooh. Getting weaker.

708
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:35,670
Tell Martha...

709
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:37,190
I said hello.

710
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:49,310
Susan! Susan!

711
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:58,960
Hurry. Hurry!

712
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,570
Come on, come on.

713
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:34,470
Oh, Susan...

714
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,620
If your casseroles had been any better,

715
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:38,260
he would have had seconds.

716
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:40,400
And none of this would be happening!

717
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:43,390
No!

718
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:58,260
This has gone on long enough!

719
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,690
Paul!

720
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,260
Paul, stop.

721
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:06,830
Don't do this. Paul, let her go!

722
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:09,360
You are not like her. You are not a killer!

723
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,290
Thank you.

724
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:31,300
Thank you, Susan.

725
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:38,570
I knew you wouldn't hurt her. You're a good person.

726
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:40,330
Stop saying that.

727
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:45,170
Felicia's right.

728
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:49,020
I killed Martha.

729
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,940
The man you think I am...

730
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:57,920
I haven't been him for a long time.

731
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,260
But I want to be that man again.

732
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:09,300
Officers, can you take my statement?

733
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:16,530
I have a confession to make.

734
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,570
A sense of security--

735
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:28,410
It's something we all search for...

736
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,250
whether it's knowing we're desired...

737
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,770
taking control of our fears...

738
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:46,110
or finding the strength to do the right thing.

739
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:56,490
But the danger of a sense of security is

740
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:57,250
that it may prove...

741
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,970
to be false.

742
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:23,030
One clear, moonlit evening,

743
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:26,370
There was a dinner party on Wisteria Lane,

744
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:31,390
And everyone would agree that it was a night to remember.

745
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:36,270
They would remember the crisp Chardonnay...

746
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:39,760
The tangy salad...

747
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,720
And the savory chicken.

748
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:49,710
But the most memorable part of the evening...

749
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,810
wasn't the food.

750
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:11,490
In the year since she had left the lane,

751
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:15,230
Susan Delfino had missed many things...

752
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,690
The laughter of happy children...

753
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:23,380
The smile of the cheerful mailman...

754
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:28,900
The smell of wisteria in bloom.

755
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:34,540
But what Susan missed the most...

756
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:38,300
were her friends.

757
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,600
Dishes are done. Can I go now?

758
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:41,620
We just started unpacking.

759
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:44,160
Oh, come on. It's been a whole year

760
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:46,490
since I could walk outside, knock on a door,

761
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:50,110
- And hang with the girls. - Can we at least finish the kitchen?

762
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:52,710
Fine.

763
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:05,640
Susan.

764
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:09,450
Go play with your friends.

765
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:13,110
Just... be home by dinner.

766
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,300
Wow. I win. Ha!

767
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:22,010
You... are in great shape.

768
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:27,150
Did it ever occur to you that a mere woman could outrace you?

769
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:29,020
Did it ever occur to you that I'd rather run behind you

770
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:30,340
than in front of you?

771
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:35,060
That... is so... sweet.

772
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:48,940
Ohh. I have to take a shower.

773
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:51,350
What a coincidence. Me, too.

774
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:53,960
Really?

775
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:55,340
We're doing this?

776
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:56,080
I thought we couldn't have

777
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:58,140
- sex until your divorce was final. - Yeah, I know,

778
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:00,210
But I thought about it a lot these last 40 seconds,

779
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:01,840
And I think I'm done waiting.

780
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:08,050
Hey! Can you spare a cup of coffee for a new neighbor?

781
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:11,610
Susan! I just finished a run, but tomorrow, for sure.

782
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:16,180
I'll race you to the shower. Whoo!

783
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:17,550
Wait.

784
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,340
Wait? What?

785
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,960
I think there's a reason why god sent someone to the door

786
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,330
That exact moment.

787
00:45:25,330 --> 00:45:27,320
I don't, and I know him a lot better than you do.

788
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,770
Hey, I don't wanna wait either.

789
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:33,310
- I'm just so close to getting out of my marriage. - How close?

790
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:35,890
Doreen and I meet with the lawyers tomorrow.

791
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,530
Now as long as she shows up in a good mood,

792
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:40,530
We could wrap it up in no time.

793
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,620
So our sex life is dependent on your wife's mood?

794
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:46,560
Her little boutique isn't doing so great,

795
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:48,740
And the worse business is, the crankier she gets.

796
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:51,890
Crankier she gets, the more she drags this out.

797
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:55,140
All right, then I guess we'll be showering separately.

798
00:45:55,770 --> 00:45:58,530
You go first. Just don't use all the hot water.

799
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:02,100
Don't worry. I won't be using any.

800
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:11,580
So... the kids are gonna want dinner.

801
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:13,570
Should we just order pizza?

802
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:14,680
Fine.

803
00:46:20,590 --> 00:46:22,150
You want me to unpack for you?

804
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:26,140
No, that's okay. Just... leave it.

805
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:28,790
What are you doing?

806
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,700
Never mind.

807
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:38,050
What do you mean, "Never mind"?

808
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:40,170
Why are you keeping your suitcase packed?

809
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:43,160
The--the company has an apartment near the office.

810
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:47,590
I think I should move in there for a while.

811
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:49,770
No. No. Tom--

812
00:46:49,770 --> 00:46:52,810
You don't think some time apart would do us good?

813
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:56,400
Time apart? Come on. We both know what that means. It means

814
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,600
If you walk out that door,

815
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,590
- you'll never come back in. - You don't know that.

816
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:02,920
We just had a 3-hour car ride and didn't say a single word.

817
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:04,480
I do know that.

818
00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:11,940
Guess who just moved back on the lane!

819
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:14,980
Oh! Oh, my gosh! That's so great!

820
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:16,810
I'm so happy for you!

821
00:47:16,810 --> 00:47:18,800
I'm just right in the middle of somethin', but I--

822
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,360
I'm gonna call you, all right? Yay!

823
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:28,960
So what are you saying?

824
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,630
You're done trying to work things out.

825
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:33,710
We've been trying.

826
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,940
We can't give up.

827
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:38,160
We have to keep fighting for this--

828
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,160
Fighting to save our family.

829
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,960
Are we fighting to save it, or are we just fighting?

830
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:43,880
It happens. That just ha--

831
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:44,980
Lynette.

832
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:48,900
Leave the suitcase where it is.

833
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:18,270
Hey! Gaby!

834
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:24,870
Hi, neighbor. Invite me in for wine

835
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:26,460
So I can get out of unpacking.

836
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:29,790
Susan, hi. I was just about to go out. Rain check?

837
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:46,960
Hey. What are you doin'?

838
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:49,340
Thought you missed your friends.

839
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:53,150
Yeah. Still do.

840
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:04,770
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just back from a run and on my way out

841
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:06,270
And kinda busy right now.

842
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,170
Would you believe that? I told you she was mad. She's mad.

843
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:14,080
Susan, we are so sorry.

844
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:15,450
We didn't mean to hurt your feelings.

845
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:16,360
We should have made time,

846
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:18,190
Especially after everything you've been through.

847
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:22,920
It's just... to be away so long and be totally ignored...

848
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:26,220
I was home all day. My bell never rang.

849
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:30,810
Who wants coffee?

850
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:36,950
So there's Paul, and he is struggling to get loose,

851
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:39,980
And Felicia is right on top of me,

852
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:42,630
Holding the needle just inches from my...

853
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:51,100
It's Doug, my ex. Third time this week.

854
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:53,810
I bet you anything that bimbo of his walked out,

855
00:49:53,810 --> 00:49:56,150
And now he wants to hook up with me.

856
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:59,350
Will I say yes? Well.... depends.

857
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,540
If he really asked me nicely--

858
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:03,520
Renee, this is Susan's moment.

859
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:07,250
Well, she could have told me her story yesterday. I was home.

860
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:09,950
I'm just saying.

861
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,970
Susan, we wanna give you and Mike a proper welcome home,

862
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:15,560
so we are having a dinner party in your honor.

863
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:20,160
Aw. You guys don't have to go to all that trouble. Whose house?

864
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:21,430
All of ours.

865
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:23,360
It's an old-fashioned progressive dinner.

866
00:50:23,370 --> 00:50:25,830
We're doing drinks and appetizers at my place...

867
00:50:25,830 --> 00:50:26,880
uh, salad at mine.

868
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,250
And for the entry, I am making my famous roast poussins.

869
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:34,330
It's French for "baby chickens."

870
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:37,140
I'm serving cheesecake. It's American for "dessert."

871
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:39,350
Well, you guys are so sweet to do this.

872
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:40,390
I don't want to get emotional,

873
00:50:40,390 --> 00:50:45,220
but just being here in my own kitchen with my best friends...

874
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:46,110
I'm just saying...

875
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:47,680
Aw. Honey.

876
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:53,190
Keep going. I'm not gonna answer it.

877
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:02,890
Uh, Renee, I was going to do a little clothes shopping later,

878
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:05,190
and I was hoping you might join me.

879
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:07,610
Oh, thank god. Are we burning your clothes

880
00:51:07,610 --> 00:51:09,440
before or after we go?

881
00:51:10,450 --> 00:51:13,190
I was hoping we'd try that little boutique on Lake Street,

882
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:14,990
the one Chuck's wife owns.

883
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:17,870
What? You wanna go talk to the wife?

884
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:21,740
Oh, bad idea, Bree. Very bad idea.

885
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:23,850
No, Chuck's meeting with her to work out a settlement,

886
00:51:23,850 --> 00:51:25,630
and he's hoping she'll be in a good mood,

887
00:51:25,630 --> 00:51:28,230
which she will be if we go to her store

888
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,020
and spend a bundle on clothes.

889
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:32,570
I'm buying, so it's a win-win.

890
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:34,710
You'll be helping a friend and getting a free new dress

891
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:36,120
for the dinner party.

892
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,730
I'm not sure these clothes are quite the thing...

893
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:42,010
for a dinner party.

894
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:44,760
Dinner? I wouldn't wear 'em to a drive-by shooting.

895
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,830
Just smile, okay? Doreen's watching,

896
00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:50,590
and we're here to... lift up her spirits.

897
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:54,090
Oh. In that case... excuse me.

898
00:51:54,090 --> 00:51:57,320
Miss? We just love your clothes.

899
00:51:57,330 --> 00:52:00,490
Yes, they are... so expressive.

900
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:03,280
Oh, I'm so glad to hear you say so.

901
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,630
From the way they've been selling,

902
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:08,320
I was starting to think they were... too edgy for fairview.

903
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,750
Not for us. I'm gonna take these tops, and... ooh.

904
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:16,030
These beautifully ventilated jeans and...

905
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:20,830
Oh! Look at this lovely skull purse!

906
00:52:20,830 --> 00:52:23,420
Hey, don't you wanna try 'em on first?

907
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,660
Yeah, Bree, you really should.

908
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:32,260
You two just made my day.

909
00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:34,390
And you made ours!

910
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:37,780
I just love this look on me.

911
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:41,330
Thank you so much...

912
00:52:41,650 --> 00:52:42,560
Uh, Bree.

913
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,090
You're welcome, Doreen.

914
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:48,480
How'd you know my name?

915
00:52:48,850 --> 00:52:49,760
I don't.

916
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,120
You just said it. You called me Doreen.

917
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:54,700
Oh. Well, it was on your name tag...

918
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,280
or would be if you had one.

919
00:52:58,690 --> 00:53:00,710
That's why we don't check out the wife.

920
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:02,120
Uh, what?

921
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:04,520
Ohh. Oh, I get it.

922
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,060
You and Chuck are an item, huh?

923
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:08,190
So you came to get a good look

924
00:53:08,190 --> 00:53:09,910
at the woman whose husband you're screwing?

925
00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:12,920
Hey, Bree here is a class act...

926
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:15,070
Not that you can tell at the moment.

927
00:53:15,070 --> 00:53:17,390
For your information, Chuck has not slept with me,

928
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:21,140
- and he won't while he's still married. - Seriously?

929
00:53:21,370 --> 00:53:22,110
Seriously?

930
00:53:22,110 --> 00:53:23,350
Seriously.

931
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:26,650
He has high ethical standards, and so do I.

932
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:30,080
Sorry.

933
00:53:31,370 --> 00:53:33,200
I guess I misjudged you.

934
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,850
Apology accepted, and I hope for your sake

935
00:53:35,850 --> 00:53:37,720
as well as for mine that you and Chuck

936
00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:39,460
come to an agreement soon.

937
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:42,470
You know what? I think we just might.

938
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:45,390
Wonderful.

939
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:55,720
Arthur?

940
00:53:55,960 --> 00:54:00,010
Doreen. You know that agreement I said I'd sign?

941
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:03,310
Tear it up. We can do better.

942
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:29,480
I thought you were dead.

943
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:35,940
That's the good thing about a small town.

944
00:55:36,230 --> 00:55:38,430
You start a rumor a hundred miles away,

945
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,240
nobody checks.

946
00:55:41,470 --> 00:55:42,950
Okay, so you're a liar.

947
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:45,470
Then why are you here? What do you want?

948
00:55:46,270 --> 00:55:50,040
You were in Las Colinas stirring things up again.

949
00:55:50,050 --> 00:55:53,590
Took me a long time to start my life over someplace else,

950
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:56,400
and I don't need another witch hunt.

951
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,280
Don't come near me!

952
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:02,380
Gabrielle, please. Who are you kidding?

953
00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:06,450
I'm not the little girl

954
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:08,710
who doesn't know how to defend herself anymore.

955
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,290
What's going on here?

956
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:12,420
Trying to think of a reason not to kill you.

957
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:14,960
I know we had our problems--

958
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:17,660
I don't remember you having problems.

959
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:19,740
I remember you getting drunk on tequila

960
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:21,840
and coming into my room and putting your hand

961
00:56:21,850 --> 00:56:25,960
over my mouth and raping me! I was 15.

962
00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:27,770
I was a... virgin.

963
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:32,330
What do you want, Gaby?

964
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:33,700
Get on your knees.

965
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:36,080
Unh-unh.

966
00:56:36,090 --> 00:56:37,280
Get down!

967
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:45,320
Gaby, don't do this.

968
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:46,860
Don't do it?

969
00:56:47,690 --> 00:56:49,460
I remember saying that,

970
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,890
And it doesn't work.

971
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:55,200
Think of something else.

972
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:05,350
I'm... I'm sorry.

973
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:06,840
For what?

974
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:09,600
For what?!

975
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:18,620
Raping you.

976
00:57:31,950 --> 00:57:33,200
Get up!

977
00:57:37,350 --> 00:57:38,820
Start walking.

978
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:49,270
Never come near me again. Do you understand?

979
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:53,170
Go back to being dead.

980
00:58:10,770 --> 00:58:12,410
So no because you don't wanna go,

981
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:14,790
Or no because you don't know what a progressive dinner is?

982
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:17,000
Both. I've been on the road for a week,

983
00:58:17,010 --> 00:58:19,340
And I don't feel like a party, especially if that woman's

984
00:58:19,350 --> 00:58:19,990
gonna be there.

985
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:21,920
Oh, "That woman." You mean Bree?

986
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:23,570
How long's this gonna go on?

987
00:58:23,570 --> 00:58:25,220
As long as my mother's dead.

988
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:27,060
Well, that could be forever.

989
00:58:28,310 --> 00:58:30,720
You go. I should probably get to the office

990
00:58:30,730 --> 00:58:31,910
And catch up some work.

991
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,710
Oh, forget Bree. You don't even have to talk to her.

992
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:37,210
This is about doing something nice for Susan.

993
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:38,990
Gaby...

994
00:58:41,990 --> 00:58:43,740
Why the hell do you have a gun?

995
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:49,340
Alejandro found me.

996
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:52,950
What? I thought he was dead.

997
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:54,660
No, he's alive.

998
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:58,050
What did that bastard want? Did he lay a hand on you?

999
00:58:58,060 --> 00:58:59,260
Why didn't you call me?

1000
00:58:59,270 --> 00:59:01,390
He's gone. I took care of it.

1001
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:05,660
Gaby... Did you--

1002
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:06,920
I came close.

1003
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:12,710
My finger was on the trigger, but I didn't do it.

1004
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:19,110
I guess it was enough just to know that I could.

1005
00:59:25,530 --> 00:59:27,250
Wouldn't have been enough for me.

1006
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:30,540
After what he did to you,

1007
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:33,920
I would have shot him like a dog.

1008
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:49,340
Uh... Excuse me.

1009
00:59:49,350 --> 00:59:51,160
Aren't you supposed to be behind the bar?

1010
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:54,010
I-is this a photo of you and Doug Perry from the yankees?

1011
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:56,130
Yeah. He's my ex-husband.

1012
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:58,090
That is so cool!

1013
00:59:58,100 --> 00:59:59,680
What--what's he like?

1014
00:59:59,690 --> 01:00:02,720
Okay, I usually don't talk to the help,

1015
01:00:02,730 --> 01:00:05,330
But in your case, I'll make an exception.

1016
01:00:05,650 --> 01:00:06,850
Shut up.

1017
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:11,510
Oh, good. The gays are here. Let the fawning begin.

1018
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:14,300
Heavens to cher! You look amazing.

1019
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:19,370
It's good to see you holding up so well.

1020
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:21,180
What are you talking about?

1021
01:00:21,210 --> 01:00:23,210
Oh, your ex-husband getting remarried.

1022
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:24,810
It's all over ESPN.

1023
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:30,350
Which you obviously do not watch.

1024
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:31,830
Oh, my god. I am so sorry.

1025
01:00:31,830 --> 01:00:33,310
We thought you knew.

1026
01:00:33,790 --> 01:00:36,660
This is what comes from watching sports.

1027
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:39,980
That's why he was calling me. He's getting married.

1028
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:43,840
Will you excuse me?

1029
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:49,060
Uh, red or white?

1030
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:50,380
Brown.

1031
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:03,820
You look really pretty.

1032
01:01:03,830 --> 01:01:06,320
Aw. Thanks, sweetie. Is your dad dressed?

1033
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:07,830
He's not back yet.

1034
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:09,670
- From where? - I don't know.

1035
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:11,370
He left while you were in the shower.

1036
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:24,790
Hey, Penny, there was a suitcase there. Have you seen it?

1037
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:25,860
Nope.

1038
01:01:29,030 --> 01:01:30,670
Can I try your lip gloss?

1039
01:01:31,810 --> 01:01:33,100
Uh, sure.

1040
01:01:37,930 --> 01:01:39,460
Hey, guys. How's the party?

1041
01:01:39,470 --> 01:01:40,600
Hi. Okay.

1042
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:42,900
You might wanna stay out of the living room, though.

1043
01:01:42,910 --> 01:01:46,770
-It's pretty brutal. - Yeah, Judy's a little over the rainbow.

1044
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:50,250
...change a hair for me

1045
01:01:51,070 --> 01:01:54,830
Not if you care for me

1046
01:01:55,290 --> 01:01:59,440
Stay, little valentine

1047
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:01,750
Stay

1048
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:08,320
Each day is

1049
01:02:08,610 --> 01:02:11,160
Valentine's

1050
01:02:11,330 --> 01:02:13,160
Day

1051
01:02:14,510 --> 01:02:15,980
Once more from the top.

1052
01:02:15,990 --> 01:02:18,500
No! No, no, no, no. "My funny valentine"

1053
01:02:18,510 --> 01:02:20,340
Not so funny the fourth time around.

1054
01:02:20,430 --> 01:02:21,550
Here we go.

1055
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,060
Okay.

1056
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:26,040
Look, Doug is a dog.

1057
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:27,370
He's not even worth thinking about.

1058
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:29,530
Trust me, you will meet someone else.

1059
01:02:29,540 --> 01:02:32,000
Yeah? When? Where?

1060
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:36,320
All the good ones are either married or... gay.

1061
01:02:36,330 --> 01:02:37,560
Aren't you sweet.

1062
01:02:37,570 --> 01:02:39,520
- I was talking about Bob. - Okay.

1063
01:02:45,030 --> 01:02:47,700
Oh. There you are.

1064
01:02:47,710 --> 01:02:49,360
Everyone's dying to meet you.

1065
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,190
You mind if I have a drink first?

1066
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,750
I just finished talking to Doreen and her lawyer.

1067
01:02:53,810 --> 01:02:55,680
- How'd it go? - Horribly.

1068
01:02:55,870 --> 01:02:57,810
We were this close to settling,

1069
01:02:57,820 --> 01:03:00,070
And suddenly she asked for the lake house.

1070
01:03:00,870 --> 01:03:03,650
- Oh? - Even her lawyer says it's too much.

1071
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:07,220
But it's like somehow she knows I'm desperate to end this,

1072
01:03:07,230 --> 01:03:09,040
So she can ask for anything.

1073
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:11,040
That's awful.

1074
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:12,860
Mini cheeseburger?

1075
01:03:31,870 --> 01:03:33,870
Hey! Where's Tom?

1076
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,140
Um, I don't think he can make it.

1077
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:38,900
- He's got some work he has to do. - Same with Carlos.

1078
01:03:38,910 --> 01:03:41,490
That's the bad thing about being married to rich guys.

1079
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:43,360
The good thing? We're rich.

1080
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,030
Sorry.

1081
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:50,640
You might wanna talk to Penny.

1082
01:03:50,650 --> 01:03:53,680
She was over watching M.J. today and she seemed a little upset.

1083
01:03:53,850 --> 01:03:54,750
Oh, about what?

1084
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:56,700
Well, I don't know if you and Tom had a fight,

1085
01:03:56,710 --> 01:04:00,930
But she has it in her head that you guys are splitting up.

1086
01:04:01,570 --> 01:04:02,190
Oh, my god.

1087
01:04:02,190 --> 01:04:04,150
No, no. No "Oh, my god."

1088
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:05,040
I told her not to worry.

1089
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:07,710
I told her nothing was ever gonna happen to you two.

1090
01:04:12,030 --> 01:04:13,730
Oh, my god.

1091
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:18,100
Tom left me.

1092
01:04:25,510 --> 01:04:27,380
It's not like I didn't see it coming.

1093
01:04:27,390 --> 01:04:29,850
I just didn't see it coming tonight.

1094
01:04:29,860 --> 01:04:32,260
Oh, sweetie. I am so sorry.

1095
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,810
How are you even keeping it together?

1096
01:04:35,370 --> 01:04:39,580
Right now I'm just... thinking about making salad for 15.

1097
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:42,350
I know how hard this is.

1098
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:44,840
You know, but trust me, however it turns out,

1099
01:04:44,850 --> 01:04:48,940
You're gonna get through this because you've got your friends.

1100
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:52,930
And Tom.

1101
01:04:53,230 --> 01:04:54,580
Look, Lynette.

1102
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:56,190
It's... Tom.

1103
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:01,900
Well, obviously, you don't need three people to make a salad,

1104
01:05:01,910 --> 01:05:04,070
so I'll head back to Renee's.

1105
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:05,640
And I'll see you in a bit?

1106
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:13,350
You wanna set out the forks?

1107
01:05:14,540 --> 01:05:15,870
Forks?

1108
01:05:16,170 --> 01:05:17,630
Where the hell have you been?

1109
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:19,280
The recipe called for mandarin oranges.

1110
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:21,000
You told me to get mandarin oranges.

1111
01:05:21,010 --> 01:05:23,960
Yesterday, and I went and got them myself.

1112
01:05:23,970 --> 01:05:26,880
Well, I didn't know that, so I guess we have extra now.

1113
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:32,800
But...

1114
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:37,210
I didn't see your suitcase.

1115
01:05:37,830 --> 01:05:39,330
It's in the closet.

1116
01:05:45,260 --> 01:05:47,000
People will be coming soon.

1117
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:48,300
I'll get the forks.

1118
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:53,680
I don't know if I've told you this,

1119
01:05:53,690 --> 01:05:56,130
but it's nice having you back on the lane, kid.

1120
01:05:56,140 --> 01:05:57,910
Aw, thanks, Karen.

1121
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,980
You know, in the year I was gone--

1122
01:05:59,990 --> 01:06:01,720
Okay, okay. You're holding up the line.

1123
01:06:01,730 --> 01:06:03,330
Talk and serve, huh?

1124
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:06,240
Where's Renee?

1125
01:06:06,250 --> 01:06:07,950
I don't think she's coming.

1126
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:10,860
She just found out that her ex is getting married.

1127
01:06:11,090 --> 01:06:12,280
Doug?

1128
01:06:12,310 --> 01:06:13,970
Yeah, she's pretty devastated.

1129
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:16,180
I don't think you'll be seeing her tonight.

1130
01:06:16,710 --> 01:06:19,090
Hello, everybody!

1131
01:06:19,660 --> 01:06:22,570
This is my date Edgar.

1132
01:06:23,450 --> 01:06:25,670
- The bartender? - Not just a bartender.

1133
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:28,440
- Bartender/model. - Uh, print ads, mostly.

1134
01:06:28,450 --> 01:06:30,630
Maybe you saw me in last Sunday's "Fairview herald"?

1135
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:32,240
I was "Guy checking watch."

1136
01:06:32,370 --> 01:06:33,860
Oh, show 'em!

1137
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:35,400
All right.

1138
01:06:39,070 --> 01:06:40,540
Isn't he good?

1139
01:06:40,550 --> 01:06:43,990
It's like, he really needs to know what time it is.

1140
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:53,550
Drunk off her ass and not afraid to show it.

1141
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:55,330
My kind of gal.

1142
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:02,510
Chuck?

1143
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,950
About, um, those new demands your wife made...

1144
01:07:07,010 --> 01:07:08,510
there's something you should--

1145
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:11,670
Hey, hey. You know what, Doreen? I don't care.

1146
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:13,640
Take the money and the lake house.

1147
01:07:13,650 --> 01:07:14,560
It's worth all that and more

1148
01:07:14,570 --> 01:07:17,090
to finally be free of you. Good-bye!

1149
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:20,220
You didn't have to do that.

1150
01:07:20,230 --> 01:07:22,900
I did. I couldn't let that drag on one more day.

1151
01:07:22,910 --> 01:07:25,840
But to give up your vacation home just so we can have sex?

1152
01:07:25,850 --> 01:07:26,980
That's not why I did it.

1153
01:07:26,990 --> 01:07:29,230
That place is full of memories of her.

1154
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:31,500
Now why would I want to hold on to those when I could be making

1155
01:07:31,510 --> 01:07:35,560
- new memories with you? - Oh, Chuck.

1156
01:07:36,070 --> 01:07:37,890
Also I wanna have sex with you.

1157
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:40,410
Mmm. And we will...

1158
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:43,370
as soon as this dinner party is over.

1159
01:07:48,490 --> 01:07:50,460
How many more courses?

1160
01:07:51,830 --> 01:07:54,320
I guess we could skip the salad.

1161
01:07:59,830 --> 01:08:00,800
Good evening.

1162
01:08:00,810 --> 01:08:01,880
Evenin'.

1163
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:12,100
It's a really funny story, how we met.

1164
01:08:12,350 --> 01:08:13,390
You tell it.

1165
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:15,390
No. You tell it so much better.

1166
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:18,000
You don't have to tell it.

1167
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:20,210
We were there when you met an hour ago.

1168
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:22,240
Excuse me.

1169
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:24,980
Can I talk to you for a minute?

1170
01:08:26,340 --> 01:08:28,000
What are you doing with this guy?

1171
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:29,170
"This guy"?

1172
01:08:29,340 --> 01:08:31,740
This guy is the best thing that ever happened to me.

1173
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:32,690
And you better be careful,

1174
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:35,970
or you might not be invited to the wedding. That's right.

1175
01:08:35,980 --> 01:08:39,040
I could easily see myself being the next Mrs. Renee...

1176
01:08:45,770 --> 01:08:47,210
I'll be right back.

1177
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:11,280
You want one?

1178
01:09:11,290 --> 01:09:13,360
Want one? Uh, no.

1179
01:09:14,510 --> 01:09:15,750
Need one?

1180
01:09:22,730 --> 01:09:23,600
So you wanna tell me

1181
01:09:23,610 --> 01:09:26,990
why it took you two hours to find mandarin oranges?

1182
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:30,210
What were you doing?

1183
01:09:32,650 --> 01:09:33,970
Leaving.

1184
01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:37,280
What made you come back?

1185
01:09:37,850 --> 01:09:39,500
I couldn't do it that way.

1186
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:41,450
I kept thinking about you at the party,

1187
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:44,540
people asking you where I was, and you having to make stuff up.

1188
01:09:45,930 --> 01:09:47,340
It wasn't right.

1189
01:09:56,370 --> 01:09:58,380
My biggest fear about marriage

1190
01:09:58,390 --> 01:10:00,770
was that someday you'd leave me.

1191
01:10:03,610 --> 01:10:04,710
I...

1192
01:10:06,370 --> 01:10:09,260
I grew up in a home where people left,

1193
01:10:09,270 --> 01:10:11,370
and I had to clean up after,

1194
01:10:11,380 --> 01:10:14,210
and I just couldn't go through that again.

1195
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:18,170
And so... when I didn't see your suitcase,

1196
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:20,450
I thought, well, here it is.

1197
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:23,310
My worst fear--he's gone.

1198
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:26,850
And then I thought, oh!

1199
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:28,600
Damn!

1200
01:10:30,610 --> 01:10:32,940
Paige's car seat is in Tom's car,

1201
01:10:32,950 --> 01:10:34,590
and I'll have to get a new one.

1202
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:39,800
You had just left me, and I was thinking about a car seat.

1203
01:10:40,150 --> 01:10:42,740
It was so weird. I kept waiting to feel...

1204
01:10:42,890 --> 01:10:45,660
devastated, but instead, I-I felt...

1205
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:48,700
I didn't know. I...

1206
01:10:50,470 --> 01:10:53,040
Ugh. I couldn't put a name to it.

1207
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:55,200
Then, when...

1208
01:10:57,010 --> 01:11:00,820
I walked in, and you were back...

1209
01:11:03,850 --> 01:11:06,290
I suddenly realized what I had been feeling

1210
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:08,200
the whole time you were gone.

1211
01:11:18,510 --> 01:11:20,080
It was relief.

1212
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:32,980
I... was relieved.

1213
01:11:36,890 --> 01:11:38,260
Hey, if you guys don't put out more croutons,

1214
01:11:38,270 --> 01:11:40,950
- You're gonna have a riot on your hands. - We'll be right there.

1215
01:11:44,850 --> 01:11:46,510
What are we gonna say to people?

1216
01:11:47,470 --> 01:11:48,770
Nothing.

1217
01:11:49,470 --> 01:11:51,100
It's Susan's night.

1218
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:55,590
Yeah, and we shouldn't tell anyone until we tell the kids.

1219
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:01,310
Oh, god. The kids.

1220
01:12:18,820 --> 01:12:22,220
Oh! I'm sure a year of celibacy was tough on you,

1221
01:12:23,140 --> 01:12:25,850
but as the person who benefited from it,

1222
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:27,950
all I can say is...

1223
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:31,270
- Oh, my god. - Thank you.

1224
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:32,710
No, no, no. The chickens.

1225
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:34,930
I should've taken them out of the oven 20 minutes ago.

1226
01:12:34,940 --> 01:12:36,230
I hope they're not...

1227
01:12:37,210 --> 01:12:39,510
Oh, no! The smoke alarm!

1228
01:12:41,310 --> 01:12:42,670
We're moving again?

1229
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:44,230
Now we go to Bree's for the main course.

1230
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:46,530
I don't get it. Is this supposed to be fun?

1231
01:12:46,540 --> 01:12:48,380
Not fun, Roy. Just free.

1232
01:12:48,450 --> 01:12:50,340
So shall we go?

1233
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:53,190
Yeah, I guess it's that... time.

1234
01:12:53,370 --> 01:12:55,000
Again with the watch bit?

1235
01:12:55,010 --> 01:12:56,470
I don't get it. You used to love that.

1236
01:12:56,470 --> 01:12:57,910
Oh, people change.

1237
01:13:00,430 --> 01:13:01,540
Stop it.

1238
01:13:05,330 --> 01:13:06,660
Open a window!

1239
01:13:09,490 --> 01:13:12,840
Oh, no! They're ruined!

1240
01:13:12,850 --> 01:13:15,080
Ah, god. Can't we just scrape off the burnt parts?

1241
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:17,130
There's nothing but burnt parts!

1242
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:19,240
- Oh! Help me clear the smoke. - Sure.

1243
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:21,590
Hello?

1244
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:23,170
- They're here! - Anybody home?

1245
01:13:23,180 --> 01:13:24,970
Look at us! Button--button your shirt!

1246
01:13:24,980 --> 01:13:26,710
- I don't have any buttons. - What?

1247
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:28,990
- You're the one who ripped them off. - Oh, no!

1248
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:31,490
...the salad to get ready.

1249
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:32,800
What the hell would've happened?

1250
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:39,340
Hello, everyone.

1251
01:13:39,740 --> 01:13:42,500
I'm embarrassed to admit it, but, um...

1252
01:13:43,630 --> 01:13:45,950
my oven malfunctioned.

1253
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:49,060
It's been very erratic lately, and I thought I'd fixed it.

1254
01:13:49,070 --> 01:13:51,150
But, uh, Chuck and I

1255
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:53,760
- went to the cellar to... choose a wine... - Yeah.

1256
01:13:53,770 --> 01:13:54,640
And when we were done,

1257
01:13:54,650 --> 01:13:58,110
my... entry was smoking.

1258
01:13:58,270 --> 01:13:59,750
I'll bet it was.

1259
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:03,240
Hey, Chuck, what happened to your shirt?

1260
01:14:03,540 --> 01:14:05,420
Well, as Bree's already pointed out,

1261
01:14:05,430 --> 01:14:06,770
it was very smoky in the kitchen.

1262
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:09,260
And I couldn't find a towel to wave it away.

1263
01:14:09,270 --> 01:14:13,570
So I, um, I used my shirt, and...

1264
01:14:13,790 --> 01:14:16,070
and I waved it so...

1265
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:18,050
vigorously that, um,

1266
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:20,550
all--all the--all the buttons came off.

1267
01:14:23,590 --> 01:14:25,330
Should I offer to loan him a shirt?

1268
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:26,610
Don't you dare.

1269
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:28,110
Anyway, um...

1270
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:33,950
We are going to go pick up some roast chickens.

1271
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:34,520
Chickens.

1272
01:14:34,530 --> 01:14:37,060
So, uh, enjoy the wine and...

1273
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:38,470
Get my shoes.

1274
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:42,680
Uh, and we will be back as soon possible.

1275
01:14:43,330 --> 01:14:43,950
Let's go.

1276
01:14:43,950 --> 01:14:44,650
See ya.

1277
01:14:56,650 --> 01:14:57,700
What?

1278
01:14:57,700 --> 01:14:59,580
You really think you need another one?

1279
01:15:00,230 --> 01:15:01,930
Are you counting my drinks now?

1280
01:15:01,940 --> 01:15:03,660
I don't think I can count that high.

1281
01:15:03,870 --> 01:15:05,490
You knew I drank when we met.

1282
01:15:05,490 --> 01:15:07,670
You were the bartender!

1283
01:15:09,370 --> 01:15:12,200
Oh, baby. What's--what's happened to us?

1284
01:15:12,210 --> 01:15:13,660
We never used to fight.

1285
01:15:14,090 --> 01:15:15,160
Listen,

1286
01:15:15,170 --> 01:15:18,870
I think this has been over for a long time.

1287
01:15:19,340 --> 01:15:20,720
You're dumping me?

1288
01:15:21,170 --> 01:15:22,860
It's not you. It's...

1289
01:15:23,030 --> 01:15:24,230
It's me.

1290
01:15:25,850 --> 01:15:27,690
But it's mostly you.

1291
01:15:33,260 --> 01:15:34,340
Well...

1292
01:15:34,850 --> 01:15:37,050
Edgar and I are over.

1293
01:15:37,780 --> 01:15:39,080
I'm sorry.

1294
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:41,810
But you'll always have the salad course.

1295
01:15:42,350 --> 01:15:44,690
Ugh. Who am I kidding?

1296
01:15:45,220 --> 01:15:46,830
This was all about Doug.

1297
01:15:47,110 --> 01:15:49,550
When he cheated on me with Tina,

1298
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:51,490
I-I thought he was just sick of being married

1299
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:53,160
and just wanted to screw around.

1300
01:15:53,970 --> 01:15:55,500
But now he's marrying her,

1301
01:15:55,510 --> 01:15:59,790
which means what he was sick of was me.

1302
01:16:03,070 --> 01:16:04,810
Okay, um,

1303
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:09,490
either you are the most sympathetic friend of all time,

1304
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:13,100
or something else is going on here.

1305
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:15,910
Tell me.

1306
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:22,760
Tom and I are separating.

1307
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:24,910
No.

1308
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:29,140
No. No, no, not you guys.

1309
01:16:29,940 --> 01:16:31,220
It's all right.

1310
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:34,350
I think it's for the best.

1311
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:50,570
Oh, absolutely.

1312
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,230
Wait a minute. This should be about...

1313
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:55,940
- More chicken? - Mnh-mnh. No.

1314
01:16:56,270 --> 01:16:57,970
I should run and get dessert ready.

1315
01:16:57,980 --> 01:17:00,950
Oh, wait, wait, wait. Yeah, I have something I wanna say.

1316
01:17:01,710 --> 01:17:03,750
Mike and I just wanna thank you guys

1317
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:06,430
for planning this wonderful dinner for us.

1318
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:09,120
Renee, uh, we really enjoyed the drinks,

1319
01:17:09,370 --> 01:17:12,310
and you seemed to enjoy the bartender.

1320
01:17:14,010 --> 01:17:17,230
And, Lynette, you and Tom make a great salad,

1321
01:17:17,330 --> 01:17:18,940
and an even better team.

1322
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:21,220
And, Bree,

1323
01:17:21,340 --> 01:17:22,950
for the first time ever,

1324
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:25,660
you burned the main course...

1325
01:17:26,780 --> 01:17:30,180
which was the perfect tribute to me.

1326
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:35,350
You know, um, living away from you guys

1327
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:37,020
has been hard for me,

1328
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,420
Because when friends live apart,

1329
01:17:39,430 --> 01:17:42,150
they sometimes grow apart, too.

1330
01:17:43,940 --> 01:17:47,840
But no matter how crazy or busy our lives are,

1331
01:17:48,150 --> 01:17:51,430
something always seems to happen to bring us back together,

1332
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:56,610
and that started tonight... with this dinner.

1333
01:17:58,370 --> 01:18:00,980
May we have... many, many more.

1334
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:06,910
Aw, damn. Almost made it.

1335
01:18:06,990 --> 01:18:08,220
- Cheers. - Cheers.

1336
01:18:08,230 --> 01:18:09,230
Cheers.

1337
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:12,090
Okay, now I am leaving before I lose it.

1338
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:14,850
I will call you guys when it's ready.

1339
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:20,830
Okay.

1340
01:18:25,930 --> 01:18:26,830
Hola, Gabrielle.

1341
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:27,990
Oh, god!

1342
01:18:30,380 --> 01:18:31,690
What are you doing here?

1343
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:33,600
I know you told me not to come back,

1344
01:18:34,230 --> 01:18:36,710
but I'm bettin' you won't be so tough

1345
01:18:36,870 --> 01:18:38,350
without your gun.

1346
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:50,710
I told you to leave.

1347
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:54,710
And I did. I go 50 miles out of town,

1348
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:57,560
but I just couldn't stop thinkin' about all those things you said.

1349
01:18:57,570 --> 01:18:59,720
You made me sound like a monster.

1350
01:19:00,010 --> 01:19:02,570
- I only said what was true. - You sure?

1351
01:19:02,890 --> 01:19:05,360
'cause when you said that thing about being a virgin,

1352
01:19:06,290 --> 01:19:08,390
I almost had to laugh.

1353
01:19:09,330 --> 01:19:10,420
What?

1354
01:19:10,420 --> 01:19:12,040
Come on, Gaby.

1355
01:19:12,510 --> 01:19:14,520
Those short skirts you wore...

1356
01:19:15,780 --> 01:19:17,550
Those halter tops...

1357
01:19:17,830 --> 01:19:19,550
You were a little slut.

1358
01:19:19,930 --> 01:19:21,430
You sick bastard.

1359
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:26,000
No, no, no, no, no, no. You did all the talkin' before.

1360
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:30,440
Now it's my turn. Sit down.

1361
01:19:43,230 --> 01:19:44,600
Stay away from me.

1362
01:19:44,610 --> 01:19:47,250
I remember those nights in your room, baby.

1363
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:49,750
Alejandro, stop.

1364
01:19:49,890 --> 01:19:52,920
And as far as me putting my hand over your mouth,

1365
01:19:52,930 --> 01:19:54,950
that was so your mother wouldn't hear

1366
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:57,750
how much you were enjoying it.

1367
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:09,060
He came in. He came in, and he was standing there,

1368
01:20:09,130 --> 01:20:11,750
And I was so scared, and I couldn't do anything.

1369
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:13,200
- I couldn't. - It's okay.

1370
01:20:13,470 --> 01:20:16,000
I couldn't do anything. I couldn't do anything!

1371
01:20:16,010 --> 01:20:17,270
Okay, okay, hey, hey, hey!

1372
01:20:23,090 --> 01:20:25,240
Let's call the police before he wakes up.

1373
01:20:28,570 --> 01:20:29,720
Oh, god.

1374
01:20:30,750 --> 01:20:31,820
What?

1375
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:33,950
There's no pulse.

1376
01:20:36,620 --> 01:20:38,090
He's dead. I killed him.

1377
01:20:38,570 --> 01:20:41,420
But it was self-defense. I mean, he had my gun.

1378
01:20:42,710 --> 01:20:44,550
Your gun? I put that in the safe.

1379
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:46,630
No.

1380
01:20:47,470 --> 01:20:48,770
He had it.

1381
01:20:50,050 --> 01:20:52,630
He had it right here. It was...

1382
01:20:52,930 --> 01:20:54,350
It was here.

1383
01:20:59,100 --> 01:21:00,870
I just killed an unarmed man.

1384
01:21:02,650 --> 01:21:05,560
Gaby, I thought you were gonna call.

1385
01:21:05,570 --> 01:21:06,960
Yeah, it's been 15--

1386
01:21:08,830 --> 01:21:10,870
What... happened?

1387
01:21:13,900 --> 01:21:15,200
Who is that?

1388
01:21:16,030 --> 01:21:17,360
My stepfather.

1389
01:21:17,770 --> 01:21:19,360
The one who...

1390
01:21:21,510 --> 01:21:23,010
Is he dead?

1391
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:26,520
Yeah. I killed him.

1392
01:21:30,230 --> 01:21:33,440
This is--this is bad. This is really bad.

1393
01:21:34,170 --> 01:21:35,500
The man was in your house,

1394
01:21:35,510 --> 01:21:37,260
And you had every reason to be scared

1395
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:38,580
after what he did to you.

1396
01:21:40,820 --> 01:21:43,680
I never reported him. No one knows.

1397
01:21:43,730 --> 01:21:45,600
They're only gonna know that he was here,

1398
01:21:45,610 --> 01:21:49,840
and he was unarmed, and-- and Carlos killed him.

1399
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,860
And now he's gonna go to jail because he was trying to protect me!

1400
01:21:52,860 --> 01:21:54,710
Calm down. We just need time to think.

1401
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:57,950
We don't have time.

1402
01:21:59,530 --> 01:22:01,070
Everybody's coming.

1403
01:22:02,170 --> 01:22:04,340
Including your boyfriend, the detective.

1404
01:22:06,020 --> 01:22:07,740
I killed the son of a bitch who hurt my wife.

1405
01:22:07,750 --> 01:22:09,370
If I have to go to prison, I will.

1406
01:22:14,170 --> 01:22:15,720
That's not gonna happen.

1407
01:22:39,390 --> 01:22:41,120
Sorry, if these glasses were bigger,

1408
01:22:41,130 --> 01:22:42,630
I wouldn't have to keep asking.

1409
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:44,970
Maybe you're not supposed to drink a lot of blue.

1410
01:22:45,610 --> 01:22:47,540
Oh, excuse me. Pardon me.

1411
01:22:49,260 --> 01:22:51,230
Hey. This was fun.

1412
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:52,210
I like your friends.

1413
01:22:52,220 --> 01:22:53,370
Oh, I'm glad.

1414
01:23:05,630 --> 01:23:08,190
This strawberry sauce gets everywhere.

1415
01:23:15,130 --> 01:23:18,870
There are many things that bind friends together...

1416
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:24,130
Sharing a laugh over an embarrassing incident...

1417
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:30,750
Comforting each other in times of need...

1418
01:23:33,230 --> 01:23:36,730
Finding it in our hearts to forgive.

1419
01:23:41,130 --> 01:23:44,710
But the thing that binds friends together the most...

1420
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:49,110
is a secret...

1421
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:51,370
that changes...

1422
01:23:51,590 --> 01:23:52,880
everything.
