1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,534
Previously on...

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:04,365
Bree's romance warmed up.

3
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:05,787
Oh, my.

4
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:08,472
You have no right to give
Grace expensive gifts.

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,011
Gaby grew closer to her
biological daughter.

6
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,282
I want you to have it.
You deserve beautiful things.

7
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,044
Lynette finally got a nanny.

8
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:17,355
Tommy!

9
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:18,601
Mom!

10
00:00:18,702 --> 00:00:19,582
But there was a catch.

11
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:23,682
Susan added to her
teaching income...

12
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,649
a secret job that
made her vulnerable...

13
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:28,573
Oh! Oh! It would be unfortunate

14
00:00:28,681 --> 00:00:31,032
if anyone were to find
out what I already know.

15
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:31,975
To blackmail.

16
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,210
Imagine what your
husband would think.

17
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,704
Paul Young was a frustrated man.

18
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,994
He'd been living with his
wife for over two months,

19
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:51,037
but she still refused
to sleep with him.

20
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,260
He tried everything
he could think of

21
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,603
to put her in the mood...

22
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,746
expensive jewelry...

23
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:04,977
Second glasses of wine...

24
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,509
Instructional videos.

25
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:11,516
But sadly,

26
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,569
his wife's response was

27
00:01:13,874 --> 00:01:15,570
never what he'd hoped for.

28
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,659
So Paul decided to get help

29
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,073
from someone sure to sympathize

30
00:01:23,181 --> 00:01:24,388
with his situation...

31
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:27,750
Hi. I'm Dr. Gable.

32
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:28,972
Another man.

33
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,820
Should we get this
session started?

34
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,194
So... when you married Paul,

35
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,220
it didn't occur to you he might
be released from prison someday?

36
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,359
Not really.

37
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,543
So you were content to marry a man

38
00:01:43,651 --> 00:01:45,390
you could never truly be with?

39
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:48,390
I just wanted someone
to care about me.

40
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,742
I-I wasn't really interested

41
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:53,607
in all that other s-stuff.

42
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:54,912
"Stuff"?

43
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,562
Meaning sex?

44
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,110
Do you not like sex?

45
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,852
I'm not... sure exactly.

46
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,551
I'm a virgin.

47
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,630
Oh, come on!

48
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,692
It's true.
You're 30 years old!

49
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,312
I was saving myself for marriage.

50
00:02:17,513 --> 00:02:18,269
Good news.

51
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:19,124
You are married.

52
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,072
Time to take the lid
off the cookie jar.

53
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,132
Stop calling it that.
Give me a cookie, and I will!

54
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,500
Okay, okay, let's
take a step back here.

55
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,552
This is clearly an
unusual situation.

56
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,911
The two of you...
Never got to know each other

57
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,440
in any traditional sense.

58
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:35,998
My suggestion?

59
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:37,945
Start dating.

60
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,180
You want me to date my wife?

61
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:44,628
Yes. Court her. Take Beth out
to some nice restaurants.

62
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,473
Give her a chance to know you

63
00:02:46,581 --> 00:02:48,942
so she can develop
normal romantic feelings.

64
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,703
In time, I'm sure
she'll want nothing more

65
00:02:50,811 --> 00:02:51,960
than to share your bed.

66
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,700
I wouldn't mind going to
some nice restaurants.

67
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:00,385
Fine.

68
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,083
Yes, Paul Young was frustrated.

69
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,950
But even frustrated men...

70
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,490
F.Y.I., until I get some action,

71
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,823
it'll be Dutch treat.

72
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,995
Have their pride.

73
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:29,458
It was that time of year
when people find out

74
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,229
what they're afraid of.

75
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,728
For some, it's the
monster in the bushes.

76
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,551
For others, it's the
spider in their hair.

77
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,595
For a few, it's the
vampire in the driveway.

78
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,801
Yes, Halloween had once

79
00:03:53,281 --> 00:03:54,935
again come to Wisteria Lane.

80
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,949
And the only thing that
frightened one woman

81
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,713
was that she might not be
the center of attention.

82
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:07,120
I'm having a party,
and you all have to come.

83
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,596
Did you knock?

84
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,260
Doug and I had Halloween

85
00:04:11,561 --> 00:04:12,989
parties every year in New York,

86
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,022
and I figured just because
I'm in Fairview now,

87
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,970
doesn't mean I can't
carry on the tradition...

88
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,802
Even though the food's not as good

89
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:22,308
and the company is...
Far less interesting.

90
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,990
Well, who would turn down
an invitation like that?

91
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,623
Well, Grace is sleeping
over that night,

92
00:04:28,731 --> 00:04:30,193
but we can swing by after
we're done trick-or-treating

93
00:04:30,301 --> 00:04:31,520
and show you their costumes.

94
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,355
Juanita's going as
a puppy this year.

95
00:04:33,556 --> 00:04:34,760
She's gonna look so cute.

96
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,299
Yeah, see this?

97
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,491
The tricycle with
a line through it?

98
00:04:39,592 --> 00:04:40,542
What does that mean?

99
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,320
No kids.

100
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:44,282
They always get underfoot,
they eat all the candy,

101
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:47,020
and, uh, you can't swear in
front of the little bastards.

102
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,696
Well, I'll come if
I can bring Keith.

103
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,359
I guess one child will be okay.

104
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,364
I'm sorry to interrupt. Lynette?

105
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:57,523
Yeah?

106
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,682
Did you buy me my China
pearl hand cream?

107
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,582
I don't remember you asking me to.

108
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,383
But I guess I could go
after we're done eating.

109
00:05:03,491 --> 00:05:05,992
Oh, all right. It's just
that my hands are so dry.

110
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,880
They're starting
to crack and bleed.

111
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:14,010
Uh... okay. I'll go now.
I'll see you guys later.

112
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:17,079
Just make sure that you
wake up Paige at 3:00,

113
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,572
'cause if she sleeps any longer,
she'll be up all night.

114
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,028
All right, dear. Okay.

115
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:23,185
Oh!

116
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,630
A party!

117
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:25,935
No.

118
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,318
As web sites go,
it's not that popular...

119
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,785
Just in Asia and parts of Europe.

120
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,230
And you can see that
there's no nudity.

121
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,606
I was just cleaning...
In my underwear.

122
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:50,482
Oh, look, Mike.
I know that you must be angry.

123
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:53,260
I-if you wanna yell, yell.
Let me have it.

124
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:55,650
Say something, please?

125
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:59,390
I should've taken
that job in Alaska.

126
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:00,945
What?

127
00:06:01,201 --> 00:06:03,203
If I did a better job
taking care of this family,

128
00:06:03,311 --> 00:06:04,973
you wouldn't have had
to resort to this.

129
00:06:05,081 --> 00:06:08,481
No, no! This is not your fault!
It was my stupid mistake.

130
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:11,430
I thought I could make some easy
money and no one would know.

131
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,550
I'm so sorry.

132
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,801
Why'd you decide to tell me?
Did somebody see you?

133
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:19,400
Paul Young.

134
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:20,940
Oh, God.

135
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,977
And he's... sort
of blackmailing me.

136
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,243
He said that if we don't
sell him our house,

137
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,420
he was gonna tell you.

138
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,940
But I told you,
so it doesn't matter.

139
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,520
And w-what are you doing?

140
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,622
What do you think?

141
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,419
No, no, no! Don't be angry.
This was good.

142
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,332
I'm not lying to you now.

143
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,940
When you think about it,
Paul did us a favor.

144
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,213
Look! No! No!

145
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,740
Look, look, look!
We're closer than ever.

146
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,572
Susan, get off me.
Violence isn't the answer.

147
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,833
We can't let him
get away with this.

148
00:06:52,941 --> 00:06:54,597
We won't. I have an idea

149
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:56,542
how to get him to back off.

150
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,376
I'm listening.

151
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,650
I can't wait to go
trick-or-treating with you.

152
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,810
This is what I'm gonna
use to hold all my candy.

153
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,432
Uh, that's not going to
cut it in my neighborhood.

154
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,450
Last year, I filled
up two pillowcases.

155
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:14,315
Wow.

156
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,283
Where'd you get this?

157
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:22,885
Why?

158
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,753
This is my mom's.

159
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:25,662
No, it's not.

160
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:27,772
This was a gift... from my aunt.

161
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,485
Oh.

162
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:32,965
Okay.

163
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,564
Girls, come on.
Mrs. Solis is here.

164
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,362
Hi, sweetie.

165
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,042
You and Grace have a good time?

166
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,060
It was okay.

167
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,070
What are you smiling about?

168
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,070
I found out something
about Grace today.

169
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,434
She's a thief.

170
00:07:59,150 --> 00:07:59,685
What...

171
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:01,810
What are you doing with that?

172
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:04,372
She stole your necklace,
so I stole it back.

173
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,357
No! No! No!

174
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,215
I...

175
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,882
I mean... that's
very sweet of you,

176
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,462
but Grace didn't steal this.
I gave it to her as a present.

177
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:15,105
Why?

178
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,194
Because... I felt sorry for her.

179
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,061
You know, her family is poor,
and we have so much.

180
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,542
Aunt Rosie's poor, and you
always hide your jewelry box

181
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:27,830
when she comes over.

182
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:31,350
Yeah, well, Grace isn't a
klepto with a meth habit.

183
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,220
So do you want me to give it back?

184
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,191
No. I'll take care of it.

185
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:42,902
But now that I know you're
good at getting things back,

186
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:45,850
next time we're at aunt Rosie's,
I'm missing gold earrings.

187
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,422
Ah! Here you go.

188
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,102
Your China pearl hand cream.

189
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,758
Thank you, dear.
I just used my last jar.

190
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,519
You're welcome.

191
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,520
So how did it go with the baby?

192
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,440
And on a related note,
where is the baby?

193
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:05,960
Upstairs in the crib.

194
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:07,806
Oh. What?!

195
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,092
She's still asleep?

196
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,515
Yes, bless her heart.

197
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,684
I had time to mend all

198
00:09:13,101 --> 00:09:14,656
of Rodney's old sweaters.

199
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,359
Tom's sweaters,

200
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:19,772
and I asked you, and you said
you would wake her at 3:00.

201
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,813
Oh, that's ridiculous.

202
00:09:20,921 --> 00:09:23,362
I would never agree to
wake a sleeping baby.

203
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:26,051
Oh, she's been down
for almost four hours.

204
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,862
Damn it. She's gonna
be up all night.

205
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,260
You stop yelling at me!

206
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,763
I'm not yelling at you. I'm...
Yes, you are!

207
00:09:32,871 --> 00:09:35,132
You're angry and you're saying
it's my fault, and it isn't!

208
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,270
You're a liar!

209
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:43,595
Susan.

210
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,165
Hello. Um... What's this?

211
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,160
A peace offering.

212
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:49,513
A what?

213
00:09:49,621 --> 00:09:51,995
Paul, we need to move past...
The past.

214
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,124
And you have been a
really good tenant,

215
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,248
and I appreciate that.

216
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:01,482
You never complain. You're
never late with the rent check.

217
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:04,170
In fact, you're usually early.
And who does that?

218
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,692
I'm just so lucky that...
Oh, dear.

219
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:07,855
What?

220
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,221
Is... is that a
thumbtack on the wall?

221
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,772
Well, I tried willing
the calendar to stay up,

222
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,952
but it just wouldn't cooperate.

223
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,036
Oh, but, Paul,

224
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,970
that's a clear violation
of your lease agreement,

225
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,895
which I happen to have...

226
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,010
Right here. Oh.

227
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,670
See? Page 2.

228
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,336
Strictly no alterations.

229
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,575
So...

230
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:39,749
It appears that you have 60
days to vacate the premises.

231
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,532
But good news.

232
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,770
I think you'll be getting
most of your deposit back.

233
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,710
I'll just need to deduct

234
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,120
the cost of repairing
the thumbtack hole.

235
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:51,216
Very clever, Susan,
but do you really think

236
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,170
you're in a position to
be making such demands?

237
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,393
Why don't we just agree

238
00:10:54,501 --> 00:10:56,572
to overlook this
slight lease infraction

239
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,752
before I call your
husband and let him know

240
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,860
about his wife's
little cleaning fetish?

241
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:02,459
He knows, Paul.

242
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,708
I told him everything,

243
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:08,028
including the part where
you tried to blackmail me.

244
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,180
He wasn't happy.

245
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:12,893
See this?

246
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,484
This is what I had to
pry out of his hand

247
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,330
so you wouldn't need a paramedic
to pry it out of your skull.

248
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,684
Allow me to demonstrate.

249
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:25,365
This...

250
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:26,907
Is you.

251
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,677
This is you if you tell

252
00:11:31,921 --> 00:11:33,509
anyone and Mike finds out.

253
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:36,985
I understand.

254
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,576
Don't forget. 60 days.

255
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,206
Oh! And enjoy those
raisin muffins.

256
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:50,120
At least, I hope
they're all raisins.

257
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,720
My apartment has rats.

258
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,032
I can't believe you're finally
gonna see my apartment.

259
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,902
Me neither, but as you said,

260
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,898
we need to get to know
each other better.

261
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:05,585
So...

262
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:08,446
Here goes.

263
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,677
Oh, my God.

264
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:16,032
What's wrong?
Well, you have to understand.

265
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,307
I had this whole
frozen smile ready.

266
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,507
I was expecting a bachelor pad...

267
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,098
you know, pizza boxes,
dirty underwear,

268
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,740
neon beer clock.
But look at this place.

269
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,307
It's tastefully decorated

270
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,715
and smells...

271
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,478
Oh, my. Is that potpourri?

272
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,033
I just switched to the...

273
00:12:36,141 --> 00:12:36,976
Autumn blend.

274
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:41,090
Take me... right now...
On the table.

275
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,232
Should I use a place mat?

276
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,043
Mmm. Mmm.

277
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,325
Hello.

278
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,608
That is Mimi, my roommate.

279
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,187
See ya.

280
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:01,863
Well, it looks like

281
00:13:01,971 --> 00:13:03,890
that frozen smile came
in handy after all.

282
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:10,520
I have to say,
you do keep me on my toes.

283
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,147
This is an unexpected
spot for a first date.

284
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,933
Well, I know it sounds corny.

285
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:17,653
But you take a girl
to a haunted house,

286
00:13:17,761 --> 00:13:19,330
and she'll probably
wanna grab onto you.

287
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,540
Hey, that pumpkin bread
looks pretty good.

288
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,990
Why don't you get us
a couple of slices?

289
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:25,665
Sure.

290
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,957
So... are you an Oakridge parent?

291
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,342
Oh, yes. We love the school.

292
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,190
Are you thinking of
sending your child there?

293
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,740
I don't think so.

294
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,218
My family values are
quite traditional.

295
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,782
I happened to hear
some information about

296
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,493
the after-school activities
of one of the teachers.

297
00:13:51,601 --> 00:13:53,975
And let's just say...
It was troubling.

298
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:56,617
What kind of information?

299
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,233
Are you familiar with a,
um, Mrs. Delfino?

300
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:05,525
Ohh.

301
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,102
♪ Go to sleep, go to sleep ♪

302
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,061
♪ This is all grandma's fault ♪

303
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,302
♪ Go to sleep, go to sleep ♪

304
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,421
♪ Why can't she put
her things away? ♪

305
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,623
You okay?

306
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:41,633
What time is it?

307
00:14:41,741 --> 00:14:42,276
12.

308
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:45,282
I'm sorry to wake you up,
but I am worried about your mom.

309
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,434
I don't think she's all there.

310
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,387
You woke me up at 4:00 A.M.

311
00:14:50,495 --> 00:14:51,951
To bitch about my mom?

312
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:55,162
You couldn't do that
during business hours?

313
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,802
No. Listen. She sent me
out to buy hand cream

314
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,382
when she already had ten jars.

315
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:01,172
She forgot to wake up the baby.

316
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,480
She's older.
She forgets some things.

317
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,755
No! She also has these...

318
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,334
Intense mood swings.

319
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:12,962
I mean, today, she almost took
my head off for no reason.

320
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,153
Well, she's... and then...

321
00:15:14,261 --> 00:15:16,332
and then she looked like she
was gonna burst into tears.

322
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,762
She's away from home.
She isn't used to all this chaos.

323
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:20,987
Okay. I get it.

324
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,292
She's your mom, and you love her,

325
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,502
and you can look for an excuse
for every one of these things.

326
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:30,059
But I think there's
more going on here

327
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,496
than just her being
a little forgetful.

328
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:37,410
Your light's on.

329
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:52,813
Hey, mom.

330
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,720
How you doing?

331
00:15:58,780 --> 00:15:59,483
You okay?

332
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:00,715
Yes.

333
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:03,780
Why do you ask?
Is something wrong?

334
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,465
You just seem a little...

335
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,180
A little scattered lately.

336
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,742
H-have you noticed that?

337
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,204
There's my little worrywart.

338
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:21,222
Remember when you
were at Camp Kickapoo?

339
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:23,562
You were sure hurricane
Belle had killed us all

340
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,540
even though it was off
the coast of Georgia.

341
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,329
A-and that...

342
00:16:27,437 --> 00:16:28,578
that mean counselor

343
00:16:28,805 --> 00:16:30,708
Bob wouldn't let me call you.

344
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:32,140
His name was Andy.

345
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,760
My God, you're right.
And you did call.

346
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,590
You even made me put
the dog on the phone.

347
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,876
Which you did.

348
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,675
No. I just barked
a couple of times.

349
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,296
Ruff ruff!

350
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,858
Sparky was asleep.

351
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,492
Oh, I better go get dressed.

352
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,960
I told Penny I'd help
her with her costume.

353
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:54,925
Okay.

354
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,333
Did you see that?

355
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,919
She's remembering things
that I don't even remember.

356
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,939
Yeah, but it's 9:00
in the morning, and...

357
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,183
And what?

358
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:06,413
I've been doing a little research,

359
00:17:06,521 --> 00:17:08,592
and there is this thing
called sundowning.

360
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,252
A lot of people with dementia
don't show signs in the day.

361
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,292
It's only at night
that they get confused.

362
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,494
Did you not just hear her?
My mother is not senile.

363
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,230
Let's be honest.

364
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:19,993
You've been trying to get
her out of this house

365
00:17:20,101 --> 00:17:23,261
ever since she walked in.
You think this is a tactic?

366
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:27,172
The other day, she made tea then
left the stove on for an hour.

367
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,462
There has been a lot
of stuff like that,

368
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,182
and I'm starting to get worried.

369
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:33,520
Maybe we should take
her to the doctor.

370
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:34,725
No!

371
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,049
Tom...
No!

372
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,782
Until we know what's going on,

373
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,993
I don't feel comfortable
with her watching the baby.

374
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:42,640
There is nothing wrong
with my mother, okay?

375
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,590
So just drop it!

376
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:02,723
Morning. Do you want
something to eat or some tea?

377
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,760
Oh. Tea would be lovely.

378
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,170
How do you take it?

379
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,454
With an explanation.

380
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:12,332
I'm sorry. Keith didn't tell me
that he had a female roommate.

381
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,982
And, yes, he said that you
two never slept together...

382
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,902
Well, except for those two times.

383
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,532
What?! We never had sex!

384
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:21,153
That's really what he said.

385
00:18:21,261 --> 00:18:22,742
I just needed to see your reaction

386
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:25,191
to know that it was true.
Nicely done.

387
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:27,686
Thank you.

388
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,020
By the way, you don't need
to worry about other women.

389
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,480
The guy never stops
talking about you.

390
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:35,020
Oh, that's good to hear.

391
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:37,506
Well, I'm gonna grab a shower.

392
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,500
Here's your tea.
Water will be ready in a minute.

393
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,133
Oh, and, uh, when Keith wakes up,

394
00:18:42,241 --> 00:18:43,740
could you just give
him his mail? Sure.

395
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,580
I know you didn't come to
deliver your R.S.V.P. in person.

396
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:13,754
What's up?

397
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,592
Well, I need to ask you something.

398
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,413
In the time that you and
Keith spent together,

399
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:21,182
did you ever have the
sense that he might be...

400
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,911
into bony old white ladies?

401
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,241
Definitely.

402
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,232
No, what I was wondering is,

403
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:29,742
have you ever gotten a vibe that
he might be a little... crazy?

404
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:31,339
Oh. Well, let me think.

405
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:33,372
Our first date was cut short

406
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,042
when you sabotaged your
own sprinkler system.

407
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,531
Our second was derailed

408
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,449
when you terrorized me
with a little person.

409
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,504
No, I think the vibe I

410
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:44,415
picked up is you're crazy.

411
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,782
Renee, you're not
being very helpful.

412
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:49,504
Fine. You wanna tell
me what this is about?

413
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,060
I'm trying to find out
if he's dangerous.

414
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,197
I recently discovered that he

415
00:19:54,455 --> 00:19:56,109
is on probation for assault.

416
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,173
Oh. That?

417
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:59,812
You know about it?

418
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,532
Yeah. It happened at the
bar where I met him.

419
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,712
About a year ago,
he brought his girlfriend there.

420
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,622
Some guy started hitting on her,

421
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,111
so Keith flattened him.

422
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,792
Keith told you that?

423
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,052
No, the bartender did.

424
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,582
I always check out the guys
before I bring 'em home.

425
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:17,022
Don't wanna end up handcuffed
to my bed for three days...

426
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:17,665
Again.

427
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,024
So... Keith was defending
his girlfriend.

428
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,280
Well, it's nice to know
that chivalry isn't dead.

429
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:29,298
But there is another way to
find out if he's violent.

430
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,095
How?

431
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:33,520
Well, start a fight with him.
If he slugs you, he's violent.

432
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,472
Whoever left you handcuffed
to the bed for three days...

433
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,796
He has my respect.

434
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,902
Now, Grace, this is the first
time I've made a costume,

435
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,932
so if you hate it, just tell me.

436
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,884
I love it.

437
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,942
I've never had such a
pretty costume before.

438
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:56,424
Thank you! You're the
coolest mom ever!

439
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,994
Look, mommy! Woof! Woof!

440
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,922
You're adorable!

441
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:08,586
Oh, Grace.

442
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,641
You look beautiful.

443
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,455
Like a real princess.

444
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,030
I feel like one.

445
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:14,935
Ohh.

446
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:18,562
Well, you know what
every princess needs?

447
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:21,613
Look, I can also wag my tail.

448
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:23,452
Okay, hang on, sweetie.

449
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,632
Now once I put this on,

450
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,010
I'm gonna style your
hair around it. Okay.

451
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,626
Can you style my hair?

452
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:32,242
But, sweetie,
it doesn't even show.

453
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:34,920
But I am gonna go over
you with a lint roller.

454
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,016
I wanna be a princess.

455
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:42,142
What? All you've talked about
for the last four months

456
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,132
is how much you
wanted to go as a dog.

457
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,192
I changed my mind.

458
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,450
Well, I'm sorry.

459
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,242
You're either going as a dog
or a little Mexican girl.

460
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,202
And in this neighborhood,

461
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,232
we both know which one's
getting more candy.

462
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:54,690
Let's go to the mirror,
sweetie. Okay. Okay.

463
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,596
So your pumpkin can have a

464
00:21:59,788 --> 00:22:01,517
happy face or a scary face.

465
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,422
Ms. Delfino?

466
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,562
Principal Hobson would
like to see you.

467
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:08,423
He seems upset about something.

468
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,876
There you are.

469
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,982
Your son's been waiting
four million years

470
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:20,442
to go trick-or-treating.

471
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:21,799
Me want candy. Ugh!

472
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:23,731
Ohh. Okay, sweetie.

473
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,460
Why don't you go get your
tennis shoes on and we'll go?

474
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,510
What's with the box?

475
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,383
You okay?

476
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:34,820
I got fired.

477
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:36,365
What?

478
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:39,798
They found out about the web site.

479
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:42,345
Paul!

480
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,382
This time, I'm gonna kill him,
and you're not stopping me.

481
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,426
Mike, no. It... it wasn't him.

482
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:50,998
One of the moms called the school,

483
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,436
probably caught her husband
watching it or something.

484
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,950
So what are we gonna do?

485
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,332
We can't make it on
what I'm bringing in.

486
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,896
I'll find another job.

487
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:08,897
I'll...

488
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,610
You'll what?

489
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,592
What are you doing?

490
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,692
I'm calling Tommy Glenn in Alaska.

491
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,062
He said whenever I was ready...
No Alaska.

492
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:26,542
You'll be gone three months.
You can't do that to M.J.

493
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:28,511
Do what? Make an honest living?

494
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,902
How much thought did you give M.J.

495
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:33,450
When you were dancing
around in your underwear?

496
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:36,626
Please don't say that.

497
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,615
And now one of the moms
at the school knows,

498
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,350
so there's a pretty good chance
he's gonna hear about it.

499
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:46,072
No, Susan, you don't get
to make the decisions

500
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:49,067
about what's best for
this family anymore. I do.

501
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,503
Take M.J. trick-or-treating.

502
00:23:53,611 --> 00:23:55,580
I'm gonna make this phone call.

503
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:02,247
I had a lovely time

504
00:24:02,411 --> 00:24:03,519
at dinner tonight.

505
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,278
It was nice to hear all those
stories about your childhood.

506
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,459
It was nice telling them.
Those were happy days.

507
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,897
I liked remembering them.

508
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:16,945
Can I give you an odd compliment?

509
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,880
When you talk about the past,

510
00:24:19,988 --> 00:24:21,510
it changes how you look.

511
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,730
You're not so...

512
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,287
Intimidating.

513
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,844
Well, that is an odd compliment.

514
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,351
But I... appreciate it.

515
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,507
W-w-what are you doing?

516
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:40,142
I was responding to what I
thought was a signal from you.

517
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,222
I wasn't signaling for you

518
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:43,242
to try to jam your
tongue down my throat.

519
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:45,493
Beth, I'm not some kind of animal

520
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,182
trying to satisfy its urges.
If I was,

521
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:49,342
I could've gone to a bar or any

522
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:51,442
street corner weeks ago.
Then what do you want?

523
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:54,503
I wanna connect with you,
to have a real marriage.

524
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,556
And, yes, sex is part of that.

525
00:24:56,766 --> 00:24:57,949
But there's more.

526
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,572
With what I've been through,

527
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,548
I need a partner by my side,

528
00:25:03,656 --> 00:25:05,211
someone that I can trust.

529
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,869
I think you can be that person.

530
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:10,938
The question is...

531
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:12,587
Do you?

532
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,990
I want you gone by
the end of the week.

Trick or treat! Come on!

535
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,829
Trick or treat!

536
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,430
Oh, here you go!

537
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,054
Happy Halloween!

538
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,967
Welcome! Welcome!

539
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:02,551
Renee, I love your costume.

540
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:04,662

Clearly, he's come as
one of hell's idiots.

546
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,242
Oh, it looks like we're
gonna run out of candy.

547
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,992
I think I'd better
head to the store.

548
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,512
No, we are veterans at
the candy game, mom.

549
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:34,232
We got loads of backup
in the cupboard. Mmm.

550
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,532
Plus I always keep a
stash in my golf bag.

551
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,435
Oh, you and your sweet tooth.

552
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:40,531
Oh! Oh! More customers!

553
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:44,952
Don't forget to say "thank you."

554
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:47,730
And, Celia, stop mooing.
You're a cat, remember?

555
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,029

Oh! How precious!

You're Tom's mother, right?
I'm Gaby.

558
00:26:56,527 --> 00:26:57,862
We met the other day.

559
00:26:57,970 --> 00:26:59,699
Of course. Uh, this must be

560
00:26:59,902 --> 00:27:01,547
your beautiful little princess.

561
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,842
You're as pretty as your mommy,
aren't you?

562
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,748
No. No. My daughter's a dog.

563
00:27:06,856 --> 00:27:08,072
The dog. That dog.

564
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:10,705
Oh.

565
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:18,738
It's cheaper than therapy.

566
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,328
Oh, dear. We're
running out of candy.

567
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,430
I should take a little
walk to the store.

568
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,401
I think we have more somewhere.

569
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,660
Don't you worry.
Grandma's gonna take care of it.

Hey...

573
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,632
Thanks for cheering for me
at the big game today, huh?

574
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,055
My pleasure. Go team.

575
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:06,352
And, uh, since I scored
the winning touchdown,

576
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,302
don't I get a kiss or something?

577
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:09,282
Oh, I'm afraid not.

578
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:11,472
I'm already going to the
prom with someone else.

579
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,690
Oh. So? He doesn't have to know.

580
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,526
Come on. One kiss.

581
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,394
All right,
our little skit is over.

582
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,280
Hey, you're not getting
rid of me that easy.

583
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:22,938
Really. Keith!

584
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,150
Could you come here for a second?

585
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,750
Hey, you guys look great together.

586
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:33,542
Well, I was actually just
asking this gentleman

587
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:36,500
to leave me alone, but he
doesn't seem to be getting it.

588
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,437
That true? You bothering her?

589
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,569
No. It's the costume thing.

590
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:47,864
We were just fooling around.

591
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,852
Thank you. That was very gallant,

592
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,242
not to mention sexy.

593
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:57,005
Hmm.

594
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:01,296
You know, no one has ever
defended me like that before.

595
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:04,282
Orson once threw half
a diet soda at a man,

596
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:07,280
but we were in a moving vehicle,
so I don't...

597
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:08,985
Keith?

598
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,363
Oh, dear.

599
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:14,432
Look, like I said,
I was just having some fun.

600
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,789
By being a jackass?

601
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:18,562
You need to apologize
to my girlfriend.

602
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:19,472
Fine. Sorry.

603
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,642
Apology accepted. Let's go.

604
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,722
Hold on a second.

605
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,810
Try that again,
and this time, mean it.

606
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:26,954
Or you'll do what?

607
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,299
Keith, please, stop, stop.
Hey! Hey!

608
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:32,245
Keith!

609
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,515
Keith!

610
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,860
Keith! What happened in there?

611
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,732
An idiot pushed my buttons,
and I went off!

612
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,692
Wasn't it obvious?!

613
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,782
Well, why are you yelling at me?

614
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:48,372
Because it's who I am!

615
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,614
I've been arrested
for this before!

616
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:52,802
You know, I kept trying
to convince myself

617
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:54,902
that it wasn't a problem
until the second time

618
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:57,657
that I got arrested,
then I realized it was.

619
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:01,220
So feel free to break up with me

620
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,972
'cause you know you want to.

621
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,292
I don't want to break up with you.

622
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,542
Come on. You can't be
with a guy like me,

623
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:09,542
not the way that you are
with your controlled smile

624
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:12,222
and your perfect house
and your perfect lawn.

625
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:15,390
You wanna talk about
my perfect lawn?

626
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,223
Nine years ago, my son found

627
00:30:18,331 --> 00:30:19,853
me facedown drunk on it.

628
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,584
It's true!

629
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,455
He had turn the sprinklers
on to wake me up.

630
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:30,250
Did you not know you were dating
the biggest lush in Fairview?

631
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:32,781
No, I didn't.

632
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:35,692
We all have baggage,

633
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:37,622
and you and I have
reached that point

634
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:38,732
where we get to see
what the other's

635
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,152
been carrying around
all these years.

636
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,187
Anything else you've been hiding?

637
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,896
No. You've pretty much

638
00:30:45,431 --> 00:30:46,821
seen me at my worst.

639
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,602
Well, I don't think I've seen
anything that I can't handle.

640
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:54,686
How about you?

641
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:56,502
You think you can deal

642
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:57,892
with a control freak

643
00:30:58,167 --> 00:30:59,581
with a drinking problem?

644
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,408
Ooh! And there goes the thumb.

645
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,620
Yeah, so much for hitchhiking.

646
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:22,039
Oh. Hey, mom, you got that?

647
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:25,237
Grandma's not back yet.
Back from where?

648
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:28,032
She walked to the store
to get more candy.

649
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:28,675
What?

650
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,820
Hey, guys, will you, uh,
listen for the baby?

651
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:36,272
I will, uh,
be back as soon as I can.

652
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,422
Is grandma okay?

653
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:38,930
She's, uh...

654
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:42,122
Yeah, it's just a little late
for her to be out by herself.

655
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:44,130
I'll be... I'll be right back.

656
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:12,310
Wow! I can't believe
I got so much candy!

657
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:14,323
You deserve every piece, Grace.

658
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,092
You worked that sidewalk
like a Milan runway.

659
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,943
How did you get so much
of this in your fur?

660
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,743
This is why cats do not chew gum.

661
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,479
Here, you said you
liked peppermint.

662
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,268
Aw. That is so thoughtful.

663
00:32:30,886 --> 00:32:31,622
Thank you.

664
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,236
Ohh! Okay.

665
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:38,760
I've gotta give Celia a bath.
You two go easy on the candy.

666
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:45,070
Oh, gosh. I can't get
this out of my hair.

667
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:46,379
Mrs. Solis?

668
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:49,993
Oh, that's all right.
We don't need her.

669
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,431
I'll take care of it.

670
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:57,342
Okay, let's try
this one more time.

671
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:58,792
What does a cat say?

672
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:59,435
Oink?

673
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,428
Boy, I really hope you marry well.

674
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,488
She was having a problem.
I fixed it.

675
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,172
Really? You're not
just saying that?

676
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,912
No, Lee, you are a much
prettier Marilyn than she is.

677
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:22,064
J.F.K. would be all over that.

678
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:22,692
Hmm.

679
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,710
Oh, hang on.

680
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,809
Oh, hey, Carlos. What's up?

681
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,383
Oh, I... O-okay. I will be...

682
00:33:30,505 --> 00:33:31,961
I will be right there.

683
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:33,065
Shoot.

684
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:50,268
It's me.

685
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:51,372
Lynette?

686
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:52,575
Yeah.

687
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,856
Oh! Thank God.

688
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:57,012
Oh, it's all right.
It's gonna be all right.

689
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,924
I was walking.
I-I-I must

690
00:33:59,435 --> 00:34:00,816
have got turned around.

691
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:04,505
I made it up...
up to Claire Graham's place,

692
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,131
but... the lights were out.

693
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:12,690
There is no Claire
Graham on this street.

694
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,654
Oh, there most certainly is.

695
00:34:15,106 --> 00:34:16,007
She... lives...

696
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:20,953
Oh. Let's just...
Let's go home.

697
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:24,777
You let go of me!
You're doing this to me.

698
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:27,732
You're making me feel crazy.
Oh, Allison...

699
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,632
I said let go!

700
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:29,275
Ohh!

701
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:35,393
I'm so sorry, dear. Uh...

702
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,802
I don't know where my head is.

703
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,771
I've never done that... before.

704
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,042
Tell her, Tommy.

705
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:53,857
It's okay, mom.

706
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,251
I'm here.

707
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:01,639
Mama, that is what he said.

708
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,636
"I want you gone."

709
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:07,638
Those were his exact word.

710
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:10,909
I am. I-I am tring to

711
00:35:11,162 --> 00:35:12,618
make it work, I swear.

712
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,936
I do everything he asks of me.

713
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:20,825
Maybe I should come home.

714
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:24,362
But, yes, I know I
made a commitment,

715
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:25,860
but I am so unhappy.

716
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,590
Of course I want you
to be proud of me.

717
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,609
Okay. Uh...

718
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,219
I-I-I-I will.

719
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:44,971
I'll try.

720
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:48,766
Bye, mama.

721
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,489
Susan! Hang on.
I need to talk to you.

722
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:58,794
Ow, ow, ow. Stiletto heels,
why do you hate me?

723
00:35:59,240 --> 00:35:59,612
What's up?

724
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,222
Paul Young wanted me to ask
again if you had any interest

725
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:03,678
in selling your place.

726
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:05,066
No. He knows that.

727
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:08,012
In fact, he's vacating
our house in 60 days.

728
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,262
Well, he insisted I check again.

729
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:12,182
He said your circumstances
had recently changed, and...

730
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:13,473
Wait. When did he

731
00:36:14,466 --> 00:36:15,574
say that, exactly?

732
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:17,505
This morning.

733
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:25,332
Can you take M.J.

734
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,232
To Mrs. McCluskey's for me?
Sure.

735
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:29,780
Sweetie, mommy's gonna
hold that for you.

736
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:33,575
Susan.

737
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:34,882
You bastard!

738
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,472
Susan, what the
hell are you doing?

739
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:41,612
When you moved here,

740
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,508
I tried to give you the
benefit of the doubt!

741
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:45,920
But you're evil!

742
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,855
Well, guess what?

743
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,336
Benefit of the doubt is over!

744
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,269
Trick or treat!

745
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,204
He's out of candy!

746
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,096
You know what?

747
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,642
I'm glad I didn't
let Mike do this.

748
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,578
'Cause I'm really enjoying it!

749
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:06,746
Get away from him.

750
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,732
Beth, you don't
know what he's done.

751
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,891
I don't care.

752
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:16,160
He's my husband.

753
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:22,846
Now get out of this house.

754
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,483
Are you okay?

755
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:43,655
Yeah.

756
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:46,046
Thank you.

757
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,512
Well, I hope you're happy.
Mrs. Sanchez was furious

758
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,882
when she saw what you
did to Grace's hair.

759
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:07,192
Fortunately,
that sweet little girl

760
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:10,662
saw I was in a jam and said it
was her idea. Of course she did.

761
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:11,812
Well, thank God.

762
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:14,982
Otherwise, she wouldn't be able
to come here and play anymore.

763
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:15,826
Who cares?

764
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,114
Honey, Grace is your friend.

765
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:21,222
I didn't even know
her till a month ago.

766
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:23,102
But you love spending
time with her.

767
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:24,087
No, you do.

768
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:27,493
You're always talking to her,
kissing her,

769
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,969
staring at her.

770
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:31,192
You like her better than me.

771
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,498
Oh, that's ridiculous!

772
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,532
Then why did you give
her that necklace?

773
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,188
You don't even let me
touch your jewelry.

774
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,228
What's so special about Grace?

775
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:45,505
Whatever.

776
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:55,040
This is bad.

777
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:59,396
She knows something is up.
I think we should pull back,

778
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:01,372
stay away from Grace for a while.

779
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,077
No! No way. No, no, no.

780
00:39:03,673 --> 00:39:05,369
I'll just be more careful.

781
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:07,234
It'll be fine.

782
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,430
Gaby, we have to
protect our daughter.

783
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,601
They're both our daughters.

784
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,952
I really don't want you to go.

785
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,442
I don't wanna go either,

786
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:21,852
but this will make us enough money

787
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,830
to get Paul out of our house

788
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,879
and give us our lives back.

789
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,657
Plus if I stay,

790
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:30,980
I'm afraid I'll kill him.

791
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,569
Okay. Car's loaded.

792
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,418
It's time to go.

793
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:47,912
To the nursing home.

794
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:51,725
Mom, again,
it isn't a nursing home.

795
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,135
It's assisted living. It's...

796
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:57,235
It's a beautiful facility with...
with flower beds

797
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,172
and activities and lots
of other people. It's...

798
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,522
Just tell me this, Tommy.

799
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:04,112
After I go there,
when do I get to leave?

800
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,991
When do I get to go home?

801
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:09,402
We'll have to see
what the doctors say.

802
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:10,652
Never, that's when.

803
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,652
I've seen my friends
go into these places,

804
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,423
and they don't come back.

805
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:16,305
Mom...

806
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:22,098
I talked to Peter and Theresa,

807
00:40:22,339 --> 00:40:23,522
and we all agree.

808
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,854
You can't live by
yourself anymore.

809
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:31,944
If something bad were
to happen to you,

810
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,635
we would never...

811
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,260
Forgive ourselves.

812
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:38,402
The only thing bad happening here

813
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:40,347
is what you're doing to me.

814
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:48,147
Mom... I don't know

815
00:40:48,531 --> 00:40:49,681
what else to do.

816
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,889
When you called me at that camp

817
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,960
and you were scared,
you kept saying,

818
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,649
"I want to come home, mom."

819
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:03,949
And I said, "Tommy,

820
00:41:04,581 --> 00:41:05,797
"if you mean that,

821
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,237
I'll come get you."

822
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:14,247
That's what you do.

823
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:45,175
The time comes when
we all must find out

824
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:47,713
what we're afraid of.

825
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:52,666
Some of us fear...

826
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:55,171
"She may never forgive me."

827
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,541
Others worry...

828
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:01,564
"She might learn the truth."

829
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:05,669
A few wonder...

830
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:08,692
"Could he send me away?"

831
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:15,192
Yes. The world is a scary place.

832
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:20,714
It's even more terrifying...

833
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,130
If we have to face it...

834
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:27,265
Alone.
