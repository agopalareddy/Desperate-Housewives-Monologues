<i>Previously on Desperate Housewives</i>

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:05,820
I love this job.

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,510
<i>Tom's career took off.</i>

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,650
And you gave me
the confidence to jump at it.

5
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,940
I could kill you right now,
or I could do this.

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,740
<i>Felicia made peace with Paul...</i>

7
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,550
And don't you worry about Paul.

8
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:18,880
<i>Or so he thought.</i>

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,350
I'll make him pay for what he did to you.

10
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,920
Look, I'm your landlord.
I have a right to come in.

11
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,590
<i>But it was Susan who gave him hope.</i>

12
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:28,820
I remember a guy that used
to live on this street.

13
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,130
He had a laugh you could
hear three houses away.

14
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:32,690
I'm not that man anymore.

15
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,270
I think you can be.

16
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,020
Who do you want in your life...

17
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,570
me or Bree? Choose.

18
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:40,570
<i>And Gaby made a decision.</i>

19
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,280
- Can I stay with you for a while?
- Of course.

20
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,270
Girls, come on. Go on in.

21
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,850
<i>Bree Van De Kamp had
occasionally found her home</i>

22
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,190
<i>invaded by household pests.</i>

23
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,050
<i>And her manner of dealing
with them was ruthless.</i>

24
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,340
<i>She smashed them.</i>

25
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,610
<i>She poisoned them.</i>

26
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:13,060
<i>She executed them.</i>

27
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:18,160
<i>But when it came to the latest pests</i>

28
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,850
<i>who had invaded Bree's home...</i>

29
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,960
<i>extermination was not an option.</i>

30
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,970
Girls! There's mud on your shoes!

31
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:28,660
Mud on your shoes!

32
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,890
Girls! We are guests here!

33
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,640
What have I said about wiping your feet?

34
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:34,850
Sorry.

35
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:38,080
No, no, no, no, no! No, no, no!

36
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:40,910
Just... uh, uh, never mind.

37
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,300
It hasn't rained in three weeks.

38
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,700
Where did they find mud?

39
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,690
Honey, they don't find mud. Mud finds them.

40
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:51,360
So, um, speaking of
the fun we've been having,

41
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:55,310
how long do you think it'll be
before you and Carlos make up

42
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,730
and you can all... go back home?

43
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,000
Eh, a few days.

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,810
He'll be sitting alone in that house,

45
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,760
realizing how big it is, how quiet it is...

46
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,920
How clean it is.

47
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:07,660
Then he'll show up here with
that hangdog look on his face,

48
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,950
begging us to come back.

49
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,750
Mom! Celia hit me!

50
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,010
Then hit her back!

51
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,760
Gaby, don't tell her to do that.

52
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,610
I'd rather they settle it. Otherwise,

53
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,760
I have to go in there.

54
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,990
That's what a mother does. Come on.

55
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:22,990
Girls, if you stop fighting,

56
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,090
then I'll let you have some
fresh baked... cookies?!

57
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:31,030
There were two dozen cookies on that plate.

58
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,770
Yeah, you can't leave food out.

59
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,850
They're like bears.
You gotta tie it up in a tree.

60
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,490
Uh, Gaby, while you're here,
this might be a good time

61
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,580
to teach them a little... discipline.

62
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,740
Discipline? What are you talking about?

63
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,300
It's not like the plate's broken.

64
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,320
Oh, boy.

65
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,820
<i>Yes, Bree Van Ve Kamp had
finally met two pests</i>

66
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,670
<i>she couldn't smash, poison, or shoot.</i>

67
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,850
Okay, I'm gonna need a garbage bag.

68
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,570
Unless it was an antique. Then I need glue.

69
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:05,720
<i>That's not to say she wasn't sorely tempted.</i>

70
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:22,830
<i>Good deeds aren't always done
for the purest of reasons.</i>

71
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,660
<i>We may be trying to impress.</i>

72
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,430
<i>We may be acting out of guilt.</i>

73
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,600
<i>We may be expecting something in return.</i>

74
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,150
<i>But occasionally,</i>

75
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:46,290
<i>a good deed comes straight from the heart.</i>

76
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:47,930
Wow. What's this?

77
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,580
Your lunch. I got ham, ham and cheese,

78
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,820
and that one's ham and gravel. I dropped it.

79
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,960
Susan, you don't have to keep doing this.

80
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:58,000
I want to. You're my new project, mister.

81
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:58,990
Your project?

82
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,180
Yes. Paul Young,

83
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,800
phase two... where we figure out
what you are doing with your life,

84
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,440
set some new goals.

85
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,710
Now... you tried destroying
the neighborhood.

86
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,710
That didn't work out. What's next?

87
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,190
I don't know what I wanna do.

88
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,710
I've made such a mess of everything so far.

89
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:21,500
No, no. Phase two is about
the future, not the past.

90
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:24,910
So from now on, we are only looking forward.

91
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,430
Oh, my god! Look behind you!

92
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,580
Hello, Susan.

93
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,440
Oh. Hey, Felicia.

94
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,630
"Hey, Felicia"?!

95
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,990
You knew she was in your house?

96
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,660
I-I thought you were in prison.

97
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:41,250
Oh, I've been out for weeks.
What nice sandwiches.

98
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,030
Are you cooking for Paul now?

99
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,340
Yeah, for Paul...

100
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:50,340
The guy that you cut off
your fingers to frame.

101
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,860
It's all right, Susan.

102
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:55,030
Felicia and I have reached an understanding.

103
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,060
We can hardly keep squabbling,

104
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,220
now that we're going to be neighbors again.

105
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,950
Wait. You're living here?

106
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,880
Right across the street.

107
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:06,370
I just came by to pick
up some of Beth's things.

108
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,530
Although I think you should
keep that pretty oil painting

109
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:11,890
she made for you.

110
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,350
Hang on. You-you knew Beth?

111
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,640
You didn't tell her.

112
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:19,390
The topic doesn't exactly introduce itself.

113
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,110
Beth was Felicia's daughter.

114
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,330
What?

115
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:32,440
So you're Beth's...

116
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,720
And you knew...

117
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,060
And you're living...

118
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,410
I need to sit down.

119
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,140
We're gonna get a lot of this.

120
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:58,850
So Felicia Tillman was Beth's mother?

121
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,920
"Snip-snip" Tillman? You sure?

122
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:01,580
Yep.

123
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,730
And people say the suburbs are boring?

124
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,550
Great. Now we've got another
nut job living on the street.

125
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,490
Actually...

126
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,610
Paul is not so bad.

127
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:10,810
Yeah, what were you doing over there?

128
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,390
Bringing him food. Uh, checking up on him.

129
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,630
Making sure he's okay.

130
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:15,940
Why?

131
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:18,290
'Cause I feel bad for him.

132
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,240
The poor guy has had two
wives kill themselves.

133
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,850
And here I was concentrating
all my pity on the dead people.

134
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,430
Susan, be careful.

135
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,830
Yeah, we understand Beth gave you a kidney,

136
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,270
but you don't owe Paul anything.

137
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,710
I know I don't.

138
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,930
But that kidney gave me
a second chance in life,

139
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,040
and I'm sorry,

140
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,000
I feel that Paul deserves the same thing.

141
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,260
To us, our decorating firm,

142
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,590
and our latest triumph,

143
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:47,980
the Delaney bathroom.

144
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:50,500
Today, Subway Tile and a low-flow toilet.

145
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:52,960
Tomorrow, not walking in on Mr. Delaney

146
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,420
on the low-flow toilet.

147
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,790
You bought this at a drugstore, didn't you?

148
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,600
Come on. "Dan Perrignon." It's cute.

149
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,050
A little tip... when picking champagne,

150
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,330
wordplay usually isn't a selling point.

151
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,540
Hey. You're home early.

152
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,480
No, just forgot some files.

153
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:16,180
Head straight back to the office.

154
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,340
Ooh! Dan Perrignon!
What are you guys celebrating?

155
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,660
Renee and I finished a design job today.

156
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:25,890
Yeah. We actually cleared $293.

157
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,830
Well, $290 after this champagne.

158
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,440
Hey, we're a small company.

159
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:32,400
Why is the glass always half empty with you?

160
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,730
Hey, I don't know why
I didn't think of this sooner.

161
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,140
I just got my budget.

162
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:38,650
There's some money in there
to redecorate my office.

163
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,970
How about you guys do it?

164
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,150
Uh, well, we're a little busy.

165
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,330
It's 20 grand.

166
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,280
Busy thanking you.

167
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:50,590
You'd let us do that? You're amazing!

168
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,950
That would be huge for our company.

169
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:55,380
Look, I know this new job's
put a bit of a strain on us.

170
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:56,660
This might be a good way to sneak in

171
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:57,920
a little extra time together.

172
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,280
So you think you can do
something for 20 grand?

173
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,360
This may be the dog shampoo talking,

174
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,340
but for 20 grand,

175
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,890
we will decorate your office...

176
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:07,480
and whack an employee of your choosing.

177
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,420
Hey, roomie!

178
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,490
Hello... roomie.

179
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,790
Those are beautiful.

180
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,800
They're for you from the girls.

181
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,790
They felt terrible about
breaking your mirror.

182
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,730
Oh. You mean my serving dish.

183
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,810
Oh, you haven't been upstairs yet.

184
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,040
Gaby!

185
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,540
But look how beautiful.

186
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,700
I'm going to church.

187
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,890
Weren't you just there?

188
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:40,150
I need to do some more praying.
Apparently, it's not working.

189
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,260
If you're looking for the owner, that's me.

190
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:26,360
Are you aware that you're
blocking my driveway?

191
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,590
Yeah. Are you aware

192
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,490
that you illegally entered my vehicle?

193
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,190
Well, I needed to get your attention.

194
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,340
Doesn't make it legal.

195
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,760
Oh, don't try to make this my fault.

196
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,490
Blocking my driveway is illegal.

197
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,380
Yes, but breaking into my car is criminal.

198
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,080
Really? Let's call 9-1-1.

199
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,130
I'd love to get
a policeman's opinion on that.

200
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,040
You just did.

201
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,380
Oh, my. You are a policeman.

202
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:47,360
Detective Chuck Vance, Fairview P.D.

203
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:50,010
Your neighbor Mrs. Tillman's a parolee.

204
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,520
I was paying a routine call.
But now it appears

205
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,860
that she's not the only
dangerous woman on the street.

206
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:58,540
Look, I-I don't know what
laws I may have broken, but...

207
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:01,000
Unlawful trespass,
tampering with a police vehicle,

208
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,390
malicious mischief...

209
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:05,270
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.
I'm just so frazzled today.

210
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:07,120
A friend of mine is staying with me,

211
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,820
and her two girls are absolute monsters.

212
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,840
In fact, I don't suppose
I could borrow your gun?

213
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,030
To shoot the children?

214
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,650
I was joking.

215
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,470
So was I.

216
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:20,790
I'm sorry I blocked your car.

217
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,750
Uh, well, um...

218
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,640
I-I'm sorry that, um, I got into yours.

219
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,030
I'll tell that to the judge.

220
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,750
I'm sure you'll get off
with community service.

221
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,340
Wait.

222
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,210
What?

223
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,080
Still joking.

224
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:55,430
- I'm gonna get you! You come back here!
- No! No! No!

225
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,890
Gaby?

226
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:02,510
Oh. Right. Girls! No running!

227
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:04,670
Is that all you're gonna do?

228
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:07,150
Of course not. Next time
I'll trip one of them.

229
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:09,960
Or perhaps you could try
taking a firmer hand.

230
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:12,700
Oh, please. I've tried everything.

231
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,150
I even bought them a puppy

232
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,170
just so I could threaten to kill it.

233
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,730
They asked if they could watch.

234
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,590
Well, I can't take it anymore.

235
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,080
Would you mind if I talked to them?

236
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,750
Perhaps hearing it from somebody else

237
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,040
would make the difference.

238
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,000
What are you saying, Bree?

239
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,170
You think you're a better mother than me?

240
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,040
Well, not to cast aspersions on tripping

241
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,050
and killing puppies,

242
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,600
but there are other approaches.

243
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,670
Okay, mother superior.

244
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:39,700
You think you can get those girls to behave?

245
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,200
Be my guest.

246
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,150
Oh, and if the little one charges, move.

247
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,210
It's like someone dropping a sack of flour

248
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,530
off the Empire State Building.

249
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,770
Girls, I need to talk to you.

250
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,880
Not now. We're playing death match.

251
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,770
We do not fight in this house

252
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,680
with pillows made of hand-dyed silk.

253
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,960
Now I am gonna count to three. One...

254
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:04,200
Two...

255
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,380
Do you know what happens after three?

256
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:07,860
Four?

257
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,640
Put the pillows down.

258
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:15,070
Now, I am sure you've heard the expression,

259
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,510
"My house, my rules."

260
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,360
No.

261
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:20,070
Well, there is an expression...
"My house, my rules."

262
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,510
And as long as you are staying here with me,

263
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,380
you will behave properly.
You will mind your manners,

264
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:28,190
you will do your chores.
You will listen when spoken to.

265
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,200
And... where are they going?

266
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:35,290
Hmm? I wasn't paying attention.
What were you telling 'em?

267
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:37,410
Girls, get back here!

268
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:44,660
Don't smirk. The key to
discipline is consistency.

269
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,400
And I will not give up.

270
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49,870
Neither will they, Bree.

271
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,160
Neither will they.

272
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:01,190
Wow, if I knew Tom was working
with so many handsome rich men,

273
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,620
I would have worn a lower top.

274
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:05,070
Lower? I think you would call that a belt.

275
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:09,120
Will you look at this?
He's kept us waiting 45 minutes.

276
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:12,050
Good to see being married to
the boss gave us the leg up.

277
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,440
Ah. If he keeps us waiting any longer,

278
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,180
I know two legs that won't be going up.

279
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,830
Sorry about the wait.

280
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,560
I just got off the phone with London.

281
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:24,560
Closed a deal worth $10 million. Phyllis?

282
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,860
Okay, ladies, I have 15 minutes,

283
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,790
- and they are all yours.
- That is all we need.

284
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,830
The overall look we're going
for is very warm and inviting.

285
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:41,160
We're thinking soft wood,
an overstuffed linen sofa.

286
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:43,140
That sounds great,
but I already know what I want.

287
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,830
Ripped that out of a magazine.

288
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,500
This is Donald Trump's office.

289
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,000
Isn't it cool?

290
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:56,040
I-I love that desk...
black marble and chrome.

291
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:59,580
A-and look at that samurai
sword and those dragon lamps.

292
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,720
I'm sorry. Are you planning
to take over the world

293
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,960
with your death ray?

294
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,110
I think this is impressive.

295
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,980
But... it's not you.

296
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,150
You'd need a telephone book

297
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,610
to sit behind that desk.

298
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:15,260
Lynette, if this is what our client wants...

299
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,740
Thank you, Renee.

300
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:19,050
You know, when Doug played for the Yankees,

301
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:22,210
"The Donald" invited us
on his yacht all the time.

302
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,310
I'll just call his assistant and
find out where they got the desk.

303
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,660
"The Donald."

304
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:31,180
You're wondering if you can pull off
"The Tom," aren't you?

305
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,570
No.

306
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:36,310
Good, because the idea of
you in an office like this...

307
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,840
Is totally workable.

308
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,690
Why don't we get some pieces
in here over the weekend?

309
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,160
And you can take a look on monday.

310
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:45,200
Now that is the attitude I like... Can-do.

311
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:49,600
- I have a meeting. Great work, everyone.
- Mm.

312
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:52,120
See Phyllis on the way out.
She'll validate your parking.

313
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,290
Wow, that was easy. I know a place that has

314
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,630
- these fabulous chrome and steel pieces.
- We're not doing that.

315
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:01,610
- Why not?
- Because that's not Tom.

316
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,540
He's definitely a soft wood kind of guy.

317
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,770
Okay, lesson one... Tom is the client.

318
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,470
- If he wants a big shot office, he gets it.
- Ugh!

319
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:13,140
And lesson two...
no man wants to be referred to

320
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,630
as "Soft wood."

321
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:19,490
Felicia. What are you doing here?

322
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:21,380
I'm sorry to drop by without calling.

323
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,970
Is this a bad time?

324
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,820
Yeah, it is. Uh, I'm in the
middle of cooking dinner.

325
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,160
Of course.

326
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,640
I-I just...

327
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,500
I was missing Beth so much, and...

328
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:37,040
then I remembered that part of
her was still alive somewhere.

329
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,020
Could you spare a few minutes

330
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:42,700
for a woman who lost her only child?

331
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,930
Sure. Come in.

332
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:50,220
Smells good.

333
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:53,090
Oh, it's for Paul. Chicken pot pie.

334
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,700
Right. You said you were cooking for him.

335
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:59,080
That's so thoughtful.

336
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:01,130
Well, just trying to be a good friend.

337
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,170
I hope that we can be friends, too.

338
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,550
You do?

339
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:08,280
You and me? Friends?

340
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,780
I know what you're thinking.

341
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,820
What I did to Paul was horrible,

342
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:13,540
but thank God, he's forgiven me,

343
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,910
and now I just want things back to normal.

344
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:21,120
I even got this glove so people
wouldn't be put off by me.

345
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:24,200
What, you... you mean the finger thing?

346
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:27,700
Oh, people hardly notice it.
But the glove is good.

347
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,460
What's wrong?

348
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:35,950
I... get these migraines.

349
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,280
Could I trouble you for some aspirin?

350
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,220
Sure. Hang on.

351
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:50,390
This smells wonderful.

352
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:56,590
I wouldn't begin to know
how to make a pot pie.

353
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,210
Well, the crust is store-bought.

354
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:01,810
But don't tell Paul, okay?

355
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,250
Don't you worry.

356
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:06,370
I know how to keep a secret.

357
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:16,810
"With repeated small doses of the toxin,"

358
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:20,450
"death is both slow and agonizing."

359
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:25,120
What did I tell you, dear?
It's so much better than a bullet.

360
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:29,060
"Initial symptoms include
nausea and vomiting."

361
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:31,980
"These are followed by metabolic acidosis"

362
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:34,640
"and cardiovascular dysfunction."

363
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:37,260
He'll think it's his heart.

364
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,520
As if he had one.

365
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:44,270
"And finally, acute renal failure and..."

366
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:47,460
"death."

367
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:52,110
And you know the best part?

368
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:56,450
I couldn't get near Paul's
food if it weren't for you...

369
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:59,360
or at least that last little piece of you

370
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,290
that's still alive in Susan.

371
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:04,950
It just goes to show...

372
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,720
You may be gone...

373
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,090
But we're still one heck of a team.

374
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:01,430
Susan, how's he doing?

375
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,510
I don't get it. He just keeps
getting worse and worse.

376
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,980
I think I'm gonna have to start
bringing him breakfast, too.

377
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,970
You're a good friend.

378
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,570
Daddy! I missed you so much!

379
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:20,910
Oh, I missed you, too. Ho-ho-ho!

380
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,060
Why don't you guys go
wash up for dinner? Go on.

381
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,160
So tomorrow after school,
they come back to me, right?

382
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,110
Right.

383
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,910
Carlos, how did we get here?

384
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,010
We're talking like a divorced couple.

385
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,560
What do you want me to say?

386
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:47,730
Just tell me how long this is gonna go on.

387
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:51,090
How long are you gonna be friends with Bree?

388
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:51,990
Carlos...

389
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,320
'Cause that is how long it's gonna go on.

390
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:00,960
What are you doing?

391
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,650
Giving my plant a drink.

392
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,090
Why do you hate mommy so much?

393
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,890
I don't hate mommy. I just...

394
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:16,070
I'm mad at something Bree did.

395
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,560
What did she do?

396
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:21,140
Well... it's kind of a
grown-up thing, honey.

397
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:22,600
You guys say that about everything

398
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:24,180
you don't wanna talk about.

399
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,560
You're right.

400
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:31,140
Sit.

401
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,520
You know grandma died.

402
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:45,830
But you never heard
the story of how it happened.

403
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,160
Hey, have you seen our bank statement?

404
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:54,170
I'm in the middle of a quiz.

405
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,690
Well, I think you might like
this a lot better than...

406
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,040
"Are you having enough orgasms?"

407
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,770
Oh! I just had one.

408
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,830
We actually have money!

409
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:11,110
We paid all of our bills,
and we have money left over.

410
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,460
Well, the insurance is
covering your surgery 100%,

411
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:15,530
and add that to the money you
won playing poker... by the way,

412
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,480
don't do that again...
and we're finally out of the hole.

413
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:22,410
In fact, we can afford to
move back into our old house.

414
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,340
Oh, that would be great.

415
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,500
But we can't until Paul's ready to leave.

416
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,150
Well, he might be ready a little sooner

417
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,150
if his new best buddy asked him.

418
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:37,180
Mike... I'm not gonna do that to Paul.

419
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:40,370
Think of what he's been through.
He's a wreck.

420
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,000
Well, maybe moving out of a house

421
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:44,590
filled with memories of
Beth would be good for him.

422
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,700
Am I supposed to believe

423
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:51,740
that you are suddenly
interested in Paul's well-being?

424
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,950
Look, I don't like the guy. I never will.

425
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,680
But as long as you're
taking him under your wing,

426
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,570
why can't we get something out of it?

427
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,380
So...

428
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,650
now do you understand why I'm so upset?

429
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,480
I know it's a complicated story.
You have any questions?

430
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:13,700
No, daddy.

431
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:14,770
Okay.

432
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:19,880
I'm gonna go grab my wallet,
and we are gonna go get pizza.

433
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,640
Celia, come here.

434
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,620
You know what daddy just told me?

435
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,590
Bree killed grandma.

436
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,320
Hello, girls.

437
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:52,990
Did you have a nice time at
your father's last night?

438
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:56,780
Well, now that you're back at my house,

439
00:22:56,790 --> 00:23:00,250
I'd like to try once again
to discuss my rules.

440
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:00,830
That be okay?

441
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,010
Yes, Mrs. Van de Kamp.

442
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,520
Oh, hello, Gaby.

443
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,140
What is this?

444
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:23,640
Juanita's helping me make dinner. Good job.

445
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:25,510
Now after you're done washing
the brussels sprouts,

446
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,160
you can help me set the table.

447
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,200
Yes, Mrs. Van de Kamp.

448
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,880
Brussels sprouts?

449
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:39,170
You do know the girls
are eating here tonight?

450
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,410
Yes. Don't they like brussels sprouts?

451
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,220
Sure... as projectiles.

452
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:47,430
Well, they'll eat them tonight,
or no cupcakes.

453
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,840
You actually left those out in plain sight?

454
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:51,890
Have you learned nothing?

455
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,040
You could lose the sideboard.

456
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:56,140
Oh, they won't touch them,
not till I tell them they can.

457
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,360
Thank you for straightening up, Celia.

458
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:04,670
Now would you please help
your sister in the kitchen?

459
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,160
Okay. What the hell did you do to them?

460
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:12,510
Oh, I simply sat them down and explained

461
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,860
what I expected of them
while they're staying here.

462
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,930
Oh, cut the crap, Van de Kamp.

463
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,630
Did you give 'em drugs? Threaten 'em?

464
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,060
Children don't respond to threats.

465
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:23,070
They respond to structure
provided with a firm hand.

466
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,610
So you hit them.

467
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,830
If you stick to my system,

468
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,770
by the time you take these
girls back to Carlos,

469
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,970
they'll be perfectly behaved.
You're welcome.

470
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,930
Hey, sweetie.

471
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,000
You can relax. She went upstairs.

472
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:45,990
No, I have to get this done.

473
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,340
Do you want a cupcake?

474
00:24:56,470 --> 00:25:00,070
Mrs. Van de Kamp says those
are for after dinner.

475
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:03,380
Well, Mrs. Van de Kamp isn't here.

476
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:09,510
I'm not saying I love this
more than you and Celia,

477
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,230
but if the three of you fell in a pool,

478
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,870
and I could only save two,

479
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,540
one of you would finally get her own room.

480
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:21,240
Here. Sneak this upstairs. Eat it later.

481
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:23,890
No, thanks. I'll have an apple.

482
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:31,010
What did she do to you?!
How did she break you?!

483
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:42,060
Okay, those go right in front of the desk.

484
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:42,690
Yes, ma'am.

485
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,620
And watch the... yeah. Thank you.

486
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:48,630
Uh, what's going on? I told
the movers to be here at 11:00.

487
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,980
Yeah. I made a teensy change.

488
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:54,500
And this is not the furniture I ordered.

489
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:58,050
Again, teensy change.

490
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,570
Oh, my god.

491
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:12,340
I can't believe you did this behind my back.

492
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,580
We're supposed to be a team.

493
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,910
I almost bought you

494
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,830
a coffee this morning
without you even asking.

495
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,320
But you didn't.

496
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:20,240
Yeah, and I felt bad about it...

497
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,780
till now.

498
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:24,090
I've got two dragon lamps in my car.

499
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,020
what the hell am I
supposed to do with those?

500
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:27,760
I'm sorry, but trust me,

501
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,050
I'm saving us time.

502
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:31,370
How? Tom said what he wants.

503
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,680
Tom said what he thinks he wants.

504
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:36,040
I know what he really wants.

505
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:37,220
And you have to admit,

506
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:41,000
looks pretty good, doesn't it?
All comfy and cozy...

507
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:42,600
Yeah, Lynette, you did a great job

508
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:44,650
ignoring what he asked for.

509
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:46,940
All that's missing is an antique jar

510
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:49,470
for Tom to put his testicles in.

511
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:12,810
Juanita, what is it?

512
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,290
Get away! Get away!

513
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,040
You're just having a nightmare!

514
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,150
Honest, everything is okay!

515
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:26,960
They won't come out.

516
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:28,340
Not even for you?

517
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,130
Nope. That's how scared you got them.

518
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,230
I swear, I didn't do anything.

519
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,520
I went in to check on them,

520
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,100
and they got hysterical.

521
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:36,540
Carlos, it's me. Where are you?

522
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:40,090
The girls won't come out for
anyone except their daddy.

523
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,230
It's about time!

524
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:47,430
Okay, Carlos... who the hell are you?

525
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,180
Detective Vance, Fairview P.D.

526
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:52,500
We got a 9-1-1 call from 2 girls

527
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:55,580
who say that their mom's crazy
friend is trying to kill them.

528
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,840
What?

529
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,360
Hello again.

530
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,650
I guess you found someone
to loan you that gun.

531
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:11,950
Okay.

532
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:15,400
I spoke with the girls. They're pretty sure

533
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:18,470
that Mrs. Van de Kamp here
was trying to murder them.

534
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:21,390
Well, that's preposterous.

535
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,870
Why would they say such a thing?

536
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,580
Well, that's not all they said.

537
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,150
Gaby? What's with the panicked phone calls?

538
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,130
It's nothing.

539
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:33,120
The girls got all freaked
out and called the police.

540
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,430
Freaked out about what?

541
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,540
Are you the father?

542
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:36,760
Yeah. Carlos Solis.

543
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:37,720
Detective Vance.

544
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,440
Mr. Solis, did you tell your daughter that

545
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,230
Mrs. Van de Kamp killed your mother?

546
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,680
Did you tell her that, sir?

547
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,730
I think I know what this is.

548
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:01,980
Me and the girls were talking
about my mother's death,

549
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,390
and I said being apart from their mom

550
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:06,280
felt almost as bad,

551
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:09,490
and I said that I blamed Bree for that.

552
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:13,190
They must have gotten confused.

553
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:16,580
Yeah, well, don't be mad at them.

554
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,050
It's hard on kids when
their parents are apart.

555
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:22,810
It's actually kind of funny
if you think about it.

556
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:27,960
I mean, not "funny" funny, but sad... funny.

557
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:28,960
Daddy!

558
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:30,610
Hey, girls...

559
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:34,770
So sorry to have dragged you out
here in the middle of the night.

560
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:38,250
No problem. I hope everything...
you know, works out.

561
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,740
Let me walk you to your car.

562
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:42,180
Let's go pack your stuff.
I'm taking you home.

563
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:53,460
I'm glad you didn't kill someone.

564
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:54,520
I'd have felt pretty dumb

565
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:56,780
for not arresting you when I had the chance.

566
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:00,730
Uh, tell me something.
When someone calls 9-1-1,

567
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:03,400
don't they usually just send a patrolman?

568
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,820
I was at dispatch when
the call came through.

569
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:08,830
When I heard the address,
I said, "I'll take it."

570
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,110
I wanted to see you again.

571
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,560
Really?

572
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,500
About what?

573
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:20,540
Your neighbor, Mrs. Tillman. Here's my card.

574
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:23,390
If you see anything suspicious,
I want you to call me.

575
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:24,430
Okay.

576
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,720
Or even if you don't.

577
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,020
What is it about you?

578
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,080
I never have a clue what you're thinking.

579
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:37,100
I'm a detective. I find clues.
I don't give them.

580
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,100
Good night, citizen.

581
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:43,300
Good night, Detective.

582
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:53,760
They are almost done packing.

583
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,590
I can't believe you told them.

584
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,910
Juanita wanted to know why we were fighting.

585
00:30:57,910 --> 00:30:59,250
I told her the truth.

586
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:01,600
Great. So now they think
mommy walked out on daddy

587
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,090
to live with the lady

588
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:03,830
that killed grandma?

589
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:07,760
Well, that is kind of what you did.
And I never said

590
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:10,160
that Bree killed their grandma.
I said that she helped

591
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,990
the person who did kill
her get away with it.

592
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:14,550
Yes. She was protecting her child,

593
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:17,680
which is exactly what we'd do
if it was our kid in trouble.

594
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,190
Families stick together.

595
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:21,140
Then why are you living here?

596
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:24,790
Why did you pick Bree over me?

597
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:29,830
Carlos, thank you

598
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:32,800
for not saying anything in
front of that policeman.

599
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:34,990
You think I did this for you?

600
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:37,120
- Well, I just assumed...
- That was for Andrew.

601
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,920
He was a kid when all this happened.

602
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,440
You weren't.

603
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,430
Okay, lay off her, Carlos.
She's apologized again and again.

604
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,610
Well, I don't forgive her,

605
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,280
and as long as you're taking her side,
I don't forgive you, either.

606
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:51,390
We're ready, daddy.

607
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,530
Let's go home.

608
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:02,690
I'm sorry. I just keep waiting
for this to blow over.

609
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:04,570
We have to face it, Gaby.

610
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:06,480
This is never gonna blow over.

611
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,740
So what am I gonna do?

612
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:13,620
You're gonna go home to your husband.

613
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:16,110
I feel guilty enough about
Carlos losing his mother.

614
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:19,790
I will not be responsible
for him losing his wife.

615
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,570
That means you and me...

616
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:28,930
Yeah.

617
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,060
I know.

618
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:38,990
I'll call you, okay?

619
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,000
Please...

620
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,250
don't.

621
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:53,700
These look delicious. Nicely done.

622
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:55,190
Well, I had help.

623
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:57,320
I just stirred the batter.

624
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,900
A very important job,

625
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:02,250
so you get to try the first one.

626
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:04,240
No.

627
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,420
I don't want to spoil my dinner.

628
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,530
Please? I want to know

629
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:12,240
that they taste good,
and I'm allergic to nuts.

630
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:21,290
Well, I... I guess that
makes me the... guinea pig.

631
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:29,510
Best I've ever tasted.

632
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:36,050
But... not good enough to finish?

633
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,820
They're terrible, aren't they?

634
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,940
You know what? I'm gonna
toss these and start again.

635
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,580
No. You can't. I...

636
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:47,690
I just didn't want to break my diet...

637
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:51,270
but who can resist with these?

638
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:55,690
They're really good?

639
00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:01,210
Like nothing I have ever eaten.

640
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,860
I'm gonna get you some
milk to wash that down.

641
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,680
No, I can't stay.

642
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:07,460
I, uh...

643
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:10,890
Need to go buy a new handbag.

644
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,010
What's wrong with that one?

645
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:26,090
My keys...

646
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,700
You're not still mad at me, are you?

647
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:40,840
No. I'm good.

648
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:41,830
Because I think

649
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:45,240
we're gonna see a happy client
walk out of his new office.

650
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,650
Any second now.

651
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,190
You two...

652
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,710
I love it!

653
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:05,900
- You do?
- Love it!

654
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,950
You do! Hey...

655
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,930
Well, you live with someone for 25 years,

656
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:13,730
you might know a thing or
two about a thing or two.

657
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:14,830
Come on.

658
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:27,990
But... that's not...

659
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:30,370
Where we told them to put the desk.

660
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:32,580
You're right, Lynette.

661
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:36,020
What are you talking about?
It's perfect right here.

662
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:38,760
I mean, look at this! The only way

663
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:43,030
it could be more intimidating
is if flames shot out of it.

664
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,480
Is there any way that we could...

665
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,850
Nah! Forget it.

666
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:50,690
And what is it about leather that just says,

667
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,720
"I own your ass."

668
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,510
Oh, I'm out of order?
No, you're out of order.

669
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:57,750
Get out!

670
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,710
So you really like this?

671
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:03,440
I love it. You know,
I was a little worried about

672
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,100
how this was gonna work out,
but you came through.

673
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,900
I mean, you captured it. It's amazing.

674
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:10,520
I'll tell you what's amazing...

675
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,350
The rug that we haven't put down yet.
Let's get to that showroom,

676
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,720
Lynette, before some other hotshot takes it.

677
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,130
Thanks again.

678
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,550
How could you do that?

679
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:23,740
Do what? Make our customer happy?

680
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:24,980
Oh, he's kidding himself.

681
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:27,780
That testosterone trap is not Tom.

682
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,530
Maybe it's not the Tom
who's been pitching in

683
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:31,010
with carpool the past few years,

684
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:32,760
but the Tom who's running this company?

685
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,090
Yeah, it is, and you need to accept that.

686
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,610
You're not gonna accept that.

687
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:41,920
No.

688
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,550
You cannot be serious.

689
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:49,890
What are you talking about?

690
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:56,770
This. This whole master
of the universe playroom.

691
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:59,000
I-I thought you liked it.

692
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:02,040
I... hate it.

693
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:05,280
Then why did you do it this way?

694
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,290
I didn't! I had a whole
other office in here!

695
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:10,550
Then Renee came and changed it.

696
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:12,680
Then good for Renee.

697
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,270
At least one of you gets me.

698
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:15,620
Tom...

699
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:18,810
This office is not who you are.

700
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,090
You're a great, down-to-earth guy,

701
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:26,030
not some jerk that has to show
people how powerful he is.

702
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:28,350
I am powerful...

703
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:30,620
And I do need to show it.

704
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:34,540
I am surrounded by gunslinger
kids who'd steal this job

705
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:37,710
in a heartbeat if they weren't
a little scared of me.

706
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,720
I have a role to play,

707
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,420
and I play it damn well,

708
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:45,870
and I'm sorry if that threatens you.

709
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,410
It doesn't threaten me.

710
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:50,280
I just don't want to lose the guy I married.

711
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:52,430
Oh, you mean Tom the screwup?

712
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,730
The one who couldn't make a
"go" of the pizza parlor?

713
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:57,350
The one you could always put
your arm around at the end of the day,

714
00:37:57,350 --> 00:38:00,300
and say, "It's okay, honey.
I'll get us through"?

715
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:03,230
Don't make it sound like
I'm not glad you're succeeding,

716
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:04,700
'cause I am.

717
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,760
You say that. You say that all the time,

718
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:10,500
but I am waiting for a sign
to see that you actually mean it.

719
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,130
And I thought this office was that sign.

720
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:14,870
I mean, I walked in here and I thought,

721
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:18,820
"How great is this? She gets it."

722
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:22,140
"She's happy. She's proud of me."

723
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,750
My mistake.

724
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,060
Ed Nicks. You in?

725
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,160
Yes.

726
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:41,540
W-we can't end the conversation like this.

727
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,560
I have to take this call.

728
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,930
Hey, Eddie, how are ya?

729
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:54,490
What, are you kidding?

730
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,100
The chance to kick your ass
at golf and take your money?

731
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:00,340
You don't have to ask me twice.

732
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,090
Tuesday works.

733
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:04,870
Yeah, I'll let you hit
from the ladies' tees.

734
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,250
No good, huh?

735
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:21,740
No, I'm just not very hungry these days.

736
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:24,140
Are you okay?

737
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,110
A little dizzy.

738
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:28,300
Sit. I'll clean up.

739
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:36,490
Oh, um, you took down Beth's painting?

740
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,610
Yeah. Some days it's nice
to be reminded of her,

741
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:41,270
but others...

742
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:43,080
it's too many memories.

743
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:49,360
Hey, um... did you ever
think living in this house

744
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,730
might be one of the reasons you feel so bad?

745
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:55,260
Maybe you could use a change of scenery?

746
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:57,520
You mean leave Fairview?

747
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,040
No, no, no, just this house.

748
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:04,120
I couldn't do that to you.
Where you gonna find another tenant?

749
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:07,530
Well, that's the great part.
Mike and I have been saving up,

750
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:10,040
and now we're ready to move back in.

751
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:16,920
I'm an idiot.

752
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:18,690
What?

753
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:21,850
Very impressive, Susan.

754
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:24,780
I actually thought you gave a damn about me.

755
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:26,740
What are you talking about? Of course I do.

756
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:29,550
Bringing me food, checking in on me...

757
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:31,740
It was a masterful performance.

758
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,610
Must have been hard being patient, though...

759
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,600
not show your hand too soon.

760
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,910
You don't give a crap about me.

761
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:40,410
It's this house you wanted.

762
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:42,590
No, Paul, that's not true.

763
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:44,860
I swear, Mike suggested it, and...

764
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:47,250
Mike. Of course he's in on it.

765
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:50,500
I bet you had a hell of a time
planning out the whole thing.

766
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:53,300
I knew nobody on this street cared about me,

767
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,810
but for you to pretend you did
just to get something out of me,

768
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:57,460
that makes you the worst one of all!

769
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:00,390
Paul, please. Oh! Aah!

770
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:03,630
Leave me alone! And this time, I mean it.

771
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:15,770
<i>People do good deeds for many reasons,</i>

772
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:22,200
<i>but sometimes good deeds
have bad consequences.</i>

773
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:29,080
<i>Correcting a colleague's
mistake could breed resentment.</i>

774
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,670
<i>Opening one's home to a friend</i>

775
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:37,020
<i>can damage that friendship.</i>

776
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:42,970
<i>Trying to bring a spouse closer</i>

777
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:45,560
<i>might push her further away.</i>

778
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:48,990
<i>That's why</i>

779
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:52,280
<i>there's an old expression
about helping people...</i>

780
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,100
<i>No good deed...</i>

781
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,570
<i>goes unpunished.</i>
