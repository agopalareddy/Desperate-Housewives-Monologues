1
00:00:00,383 --> 00:00:02,845
Previously on Desperate Housewives...

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,602
Bree discovered she had a romantic rival.

3
00:00:05,636 --> 00:00:07,570
I've been looking for a new
hobby, and taking you down

4
00:00:07,605 --> 00:00:09,939
- is as good as any.
- Susan got a bonus.

5
00:00:09,974 --> 00:00:13,143
For the girl who gets
the most hits in a month.

6
00:00:13,177 --> 00:00:15,345
Since the prison didn't
allow conjugal visits,

7
00:00:15,379 --> 00:00:19,002
- this is our wedding night.
- Paul's bride said no.

8
00:00:19,003 --> 00:00:22,872
There are certain wifely duties
that I don't want to rush into.

9
00:00:22,907 --> 00:00:25,175
Once we call these people,
it'll change your family forever.

10
00:00:25,209 --> 00:00:27,544
And Gaby decided to
meet her real daughter.

11
00:00:27,578 --> 00:00:29,045
Call them.

12
00:00:33,684 --> 00:00:36,152
Carlos Solis loved his wife

13
00:00:36,187 --> 00:00:37,787
more than anything... 

14
00:00:37,822 --> 00:00:40,657
If there's a woman on this
planet with better skin,

15
00:00:40,691 --> 00:00:42,625
I'd like to meet her.

16
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,028
Even though she was vain...

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,669
Do we have to give money
to the church every Sunday?

18
00:00:48,703 --> 00:00:51,204
I mean, it's always the same show.

19
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:52,372
Selfish...

20
00:00:54,575 --> 00:00:56,473
I told you to buy me couture!

21
00:00:56,474 --> 00:00:58,979
I can't wear off-the-rack
with these shoes!

22
00:01:01,315 --> 00:01:03,483
And spoiled.

23
00:01:03,751 --> 00:01:08,889
But in those moments when his
wife was simply vulnerable...

24
00:01:08,923 --> 00:01:10,390
You okay?

25
00:01:10,424 --> 00:01:13,593
Carlos loved her just a little bit more.

26
00:01:13,628 --> 00:01:15,662
This is where we're meeting them?

27
00:01:15,696 --> 00:01:17,464
I think so.

28
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:21,201
I don't know what I'm supposed to say.

29
00:01:21,235 --> 00:01:22,769
Start with "hello."

30
00:01:22,803 --> 00:01:24,271
And then what?

31
00:01:24,305 --> 00:01:26,239
"Thanks for raising our daughter
for the last eight years.

32
00:01:26,274 --> 00:01:27,908
Hope we didn't ruin yours"?

33
00:01:27,942 --> 00:01:29,676
It's gonna be fine.

34
00:01:31,112 --> 00:01:34,224
Mrs. and Mrs. Solis? I'm Hector Sanchez.

35
00:01:34,225 --> 00:01:36,795
Nice to meet you. And please,
call us Carlos and Gabrielle.

36
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,201
Oh, thank you. Uh, where is...

37
00:01:39,236 --> 00:01:41,490
Juanita is at the swing
set with her sister.

38
00:01:41,491 --> 00:01:43,525
We thought we should talk a little first.

39
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,960
Oh. Sure.

40
00:01:44,994 --> 00:01:47,429
Uh, my wife is over here with our...

41
00:01:47,464 --> 00:01:49,031
She's with Grace.

42
00:01:49,065 --> 00:01:51,700
That's her name? Grace?

43
00:01:51,734 --> 00:01:54,102
Yes.

44
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,709
So how are you and your
wife handling all of this?

45
00:02:00,743 --> 00:02:02,711
We're still in shock.

46
00:02:02,745 --> 00:02:04,410
Since your lawyer called us,

47
00:02:04,411 --> 00:02:06,815
we haven't been able to sleep or eat.

48
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,515
This whole thing is so crazy.

49
00:02:09,516 --> 00:02:10,780
We feel the same way.

50
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,034
They couldn't have switched our babies.

51
00:02:13,068 --> 00:02:14,569
It's got to be a mistake.

52
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,901
Maybe we should take a blood test.

53
00:02:16,969 --> 00:02:18,403
Mom!

54
00:02:18,437 --> 00:02:20,642
I told you to bring the green jacket!

55
00:02:20,643 --> 00:02:23,397
I can't wear red with these shoes! Ugh!

56
00:02:23,398 --> 00:02:27,455
Yes, Carlos Solis loved his wife...

57
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:29,790
I don't think we'll be needing that test.

58
00:02:32,261 --> 00:02:34,996
And he knew her D.N.A.

59
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,099
when he saw it.

60
00:02:47,609 --> 00:02:50,144
It's called a purse,

61
00:02:50,178 --> 00:02:51,979
and as every woman knows,

62
00:02:52,014 --> 00:02:55,283
it can hold just about anything,

63
00:02:55,317 --> 00:02:59,287
from a personalized cell phone...

64
00:02:59,321 --> 00:03:03,291
to a romance novel...

65
00:03:03,325 --> 00:03:05,993
to much-needed medication.

66
00:03:07,529 --> 00:03:10,564
Whatever you find inside,

67
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:13,501
there's one thing you can be sure of...

68
00:03:13,535 --> 00:03:18,673
every purse says something
about the woman who owns it...

69
00:03:18,707 --> 00:03:20,841
whether she knows it...

70
00:03:20,876 --> 00:03:22,943
or not..

71
00:03:22,978 --> 00:03:25,613
Carlos and I feel like we
shouldn't tell the girls,

72
00:03:25,647 --> 00:03:27,615
you know, about what happened.

73
00:03:27,649 --> 00:03:29,650
What do you guys think?

74
00:03:29,685 --> 00:03:31,686
We should protect them.

75
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,689
Yes, but since we wanna get to
know our biological daughters,

76
00:03:34,723 --> 00:03:36,691
we were thinking maybe the families could

77
00:03:36,725 --> 00:03:39,360
- get together every now and then?
- Maybe once a month?

78
00:03:39,394 --> 00:03:41,228
Mm, that sounds reasonable.

79
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:43,297
Uh, w... what do you think, Carmen?

80
00:03:43,332 --> 00:03:45,266
Um, I guess.

81
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,034
Look at them.

82
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:51,138
Yes, I have a feeling that they
will become very good friends.

83
00:03:51,173 --> 00:03:53,641
Can you believe those are our daughters?

84
00:03:53,675 --> 00:03:56,277
Grace looks just like
me when I was her age.

85
00:03:56,311 --> 00:03:59,180
And Juanita looks so much like my mother.

86
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:02,883
Mommy, can I have money for ice cream?

87
00:04:02,918 --> 00:04:05,052
You just had lunch.

88
00:04:05,087 --> 00:04:07,054
But they have chocolate chip. Grace.

89
00:04:07,089 --> 00:04:10,191
Oh, let her have some. It's
hot. Come on. It'll be my treat.

90
00:04:10,225 --> 00:04:13,294
Your purse is beautiful.

91
00:04:13,328 --> 00:04:15,863
I know. Would you like to hold it?

92
00:04:15,897 --> 00:04:18,366
Uh-huh.

93
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,502
It's so soft. I bet it cost a lot, right?

94
00:04:21,536 --> 00:04:23,637
Grace, you don't ask about money.

95
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,674
I'm sorry.

96
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:28,709
Oh, that's okay, sweetie.

97
00:04:28,777 --> 00:04:31,345
And just so you know, it's Chanel.

98
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:35,549
You can have one of these
by working very hard...

99
00:04:35,584 --> 00:04:38,185
Or by marrying a man who works very hard.

100
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,254
Thank you!

101
00:04:40,288 --> 00:04:42,256
What a polite little girl.

102
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:45,259
You have obviously done a
wonderful job, Mrs. Sanchez.

103
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:47,061
I mean, we didn't know what to expect,

104
00:04:47,095 --> 00:04:50,398
but I can see Grace couldn't
have had a better mother.

105
00:04:50,432 --> 00:04:52,767
You know what I mean.

106
00:04:52,801 --> 00:04:55,002
Uh, y... you've done a
wonderful job with Juanita.

107
00:04:55,036 --> 00:04:57,071
Thank you. You know, when I got pregnant,

108
00:04:57,105 --> 00:04:59,440
I didn't know how I would handle
the whole motherhood thing...

109
00:04:59,474 --> 00:05:00,608
Mom.

110
00:05:00,642 --> 00:05:03,611
But I think I turned out
to be pretty good at it.

111
00:05:03,645 --> 00:05:05,179
- Mom!
- What?!

112
00:05:05,213 --> 00:05:07,448
I need money for ice cream.

113
00:05:07,482 --> 00:05:09,250
What is the magic word?

114
00:05:09,284 --> 00:05:10,751
I don't know. "Hurry"?

115
00:05:10,786 --> 00:05:12,787
Now come on. The truck's pulling away.

116
00:05:12,821 --> 00:05:14,889
"Please." The magic word is "please."

117
00:05:14,923 --> 00:05:18,392
Fine. Please.

118
00:05:20,061 --> 00:05:23,364
What, we can't afford more than one scoop?

119
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:30,938
I'm sorry. What was I saying?

120
00:05:30,972 --> 00:05:34,909
You were talking about
what a good mother you are.

121
00:05:40,415 --> 00:05:43,184
Say good-bye to your truck loan.

122
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,186
God, can you believe it?

123
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,189
Just two months ago, we
were up to our neck in debt.

124
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:50,191
Now we're only up to our ass.

125
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:52,193
If we keep this going,

126
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,695
we could reach flat broke
in time for Christmas.

127
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:57,998
Hello? It's Maxine.

128
00:05:58,033 --> 00:06:00,835
Um, uh, I'm in here with Mike!

129
00:06:00,869 --> 00:06:03,337
It's open!

130
00:06:03,371 --> 00:06:05,306
Hello, Michael!

131
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,509
Look at this punim.

132
00:06:08,543 --> 00:06:10,945
Oh, Mike, if I was 15 years younger,

133
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:14,081
I'd ride you like a hobo rides a boxcar.

134
00:06:16,117 --> 00:06:18,986
Thanks. But you still have
to fix the air conditioner.

135
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,821
Eh, it was worth a shot.

136
00:06:20,856 --> 00:06:22,957
I'm gonna take a shower.

137
00:06:22,991 --> 00:06:26,360
I need to talk some business with you.

138
00:06:26,394 --> 00:06:28,662
Me, too.

139
00:06:28,697 --> 00:06:31,065
I just bought a fur-trimmed
Teddy and some floor polish.

140
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,934
Tomorrow is gonna be a heck of a show.

141
00:06:33,969 --> 00:06:36,303
Fantastic.

142
00:06:36,338 --> 00:06:39,273
- I think you should quit.
- What?

143
00:06:39,307 --> 00:06:41,442
The web site's going through some changes.

144
00:06:41,476 --> 00:06:43,444
I've taken on some partners

145
00:06:43,478 --> 00:06:46,547
who are pumping a lot of
cash into the business,

146
00:06:46,581 --> 00:06:48,549
and they're running the show
now, and they want a huge

147
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,384
U.S. presence.

148
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,553
No. No, no, you promised me

149
00:06:52,587 --> 00:06:54,622
that no one here would ever see me.

150
00:06:54,656 --> 00:06:57,691
I did, and that's why
you need to get out now.

151
00:06:57,726 --> 00:06:59,727
But Mike and I are just
getting back on track.

152
00:06:59,761 --> 00:07:01,762
Yesterday, we got our first water bill

153
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:05,132
- that didn't come with a threat.
- Honey, I'm sorry.

154
00:07:06,334 --> 00:07:08,836
Well, how long do I have
till all this happens?

155
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:11,839
A couple of weeks, a month tops.

156
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:18,078
Okay. I'll work right
up until the last day.

157
00:07:18,113 --> 00:07:21,315
Give me double shifts, extra
shows. I'll do anything.

158
00:07:21,349 --> 00:07:23,484
You got it.

159
00:07:26,288 --> 00:07:28,255
I'm gonna miss you, honey.

160
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:32,826
No one will ever wear the rubber
gloves and the fishnets like you do.

161
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,202
Okay, we get it. You're unhappy.

162
00:07:41,236 --> 00:07:43,437
We got it in every aisle at the market,

163
00:07:43,472 --> 00:07:45,806
we got it four times during the night,

164
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:48,776
- and we get it now!
- Mom, I'll put the groceries away.

165
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,244
Oh. No.

166
00:07:50,278 --> 00:07:52,146
Stop. Freeze.

167
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,516
Do nothing. No sudden movements.

168
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,386
The eyes are closing.

169
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,630
But we bought ice cream.

170
00:08:01,631 --> 00:08:02,709
Let it melt.

171
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:10,231
Hello? Hello? Yes, this is she.

172
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,068
Oh. Of course I did.

173
00:08:14,103 --> 00:08:16,604
Thank you. Thank you. I... I will be back.

174
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,835
Everything okay?

175
00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:22,005
No, I left my license at the store,

176
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:23,940
so I have to drag Paige back there,

177
00:08:23,974 --> 00:08:27,477
which will lead to another
2-hour screaming fit.

178
00:08:27,511 --> 00:08:30,380
If I didn't look so good in
that photo, I'd get a new one.

179
00:08:30,414 --> 00:08:33,552
- Why don't you leave the baby with me?
- Oh, honey, I don't know.

180
00:08:33,553 --> 00:08:36,285
Mom, you leave her with the boys,

181
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,463
and they don't change her diaper

182
00:08:37,464 --> 00:08:39,989
until it weighs as much as she does.

183
00:08:40,024 --> 00:08:41,991
Good point.

184
00:08:45,928 --> 00:08:49,197
I'm back.

185
00:08:49,232 --> 00:08:51,333
I'm back! Everything okay?

186
00:08:51,367 --> 00:08:54,369
She woke up, so I went with plan "b."

187
00:08:54,404 --> 00:08:58,685
- You traded her in for a quieter baby?
- Nope. I changed her diaper.

188
00:08:58,686 --> 00:09:00,470
Now we're doing a little floor time.

189
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,868
You changed her diaper.

190
00:09:04,903 --> 00:09:07,404
Where'd you learn how to do that?

191
00:09:07,438 --> 00:09:09,740
I've seen you do it a hundred times.

192
00:09:09,774 --> 00:09:13,510
You're so good with her.

193
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,002
How would you feel about
me taking a quick shower

194
00:09:22,036 --> 00:09:24,904
to wash some of this
vomit out of my hair...

195
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,740
from yesterday?

196
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:30,461
Why don't you take a bath? Light
one of those scented candles.

197
00:09:31,912 --> 00:09:34,643
Whoever raised you did a brilliant job!

198
00:09:34,644 --> 00:09:36,950
Mwah!

199
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,300
Shoot.

200
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:45,968
I'm out of aspirin.

201
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:47,076
Do you have a headache?

202
00:09:47,077 --> 00:09:49,716
Uh, no. My back is a little sore.

203
00:09:49,774 --> 00:09:52,576
You do realize, darling, that
your back wouldn't hurt so much

204
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:54,978
if you weren't sleeping
on a couch every night.

205
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,397
Uh, n... no. Uh, the couch is fine.

206
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:00,078
Um, I just pulled a muscle.

207
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,850
Hey there.

208
00:10:02,851 --> 00:10:04,360
- Lee.
- Congratulations.

209
00:10:04,361 --> 00:10:06,921
You are the proud new
owner of your old house.

210
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,775
You bought your old house?

211
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,227
Actually, Lee, why don't we talk later?

212
00:10:13,228 --> 00:10:15,259
Okay. Well, here are your keys,

213
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,705
your complimentary
endangered species calendar,

214
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:20,159
and a kitchen magnet with my face on it.

215
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:21,775
Yes, I know I look cross-eyed,

216
00:10:21,776 --> 00:10:23,848
but they assure me they will
correct that in the next batch.

217
00:10:23,849 --> 00:10:26,647
Enjoy.

218
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,798
Why would you buy that house?

219
00:10:37,898 --> 00:10:39,770
Our lease won't be up for a year.

220
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,804
I thought it was a good investment.

221
00:10:41,872 --> 00:10:44,630
But why buy... that one?

222
00:10:44,631 --> 00:10:46,565
There are other homes
for sale around here.

223
00:10:46,599 --> 00:10:47,849
Escrow's closed, Beth.

224
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,584
I see no point in discussing this further.

225
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:52,305
You won't discuss it?

226
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,767
I'm your wife.

227
00:10:54,802 --> 00:10:57,604
Isn't it convenient how
during the day you're my wife,

228
00:10:57,638 --> 00:11:00,039
but at night, you turn
back into a house-guest?

229
00:11:09,349 --> 00:11:12,434
No, no, no. Don't look at
them yet. They're not done.

230
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,853
This isn't about the shutters.
It's about our... date Friday.

231
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:19,338
You still haven't told
me what we're doing.

232
00:11:19,372 --> 00:11:20,561
Well, I can't tell you yet,

233
00:11:20,562 --> 00:11:21,693
but I've been working on something

234
00:11:21,694 --> 00:11:24,383
that I'm pretty... stoked about.

235
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,299
Well, that sounds lovely.

236
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,570
I, too, am... stoked.

237
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,220
You got a little paint...

238
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,468
- What are you doing?
- Shh!

239
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,835
Are you spying on Bree again?

240
00:11:47,869 --> 00:11:50,704
Why would he want her
when he could have me?

241
00:11:50,739 --> 00:11:54,108
- She's way too old for him.
- You're the exact same age.

242
00:11:54,142 --> 00:11:57,078
- I am not. I'm only thirty...
- Are you gonna lie about your age?

243
00:11:57,112 --> 00:11:58,746
We were college roommates.

244
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,247
All right, damn it.

245
00:12:00,282 --> 00:12:02,183
Besides, Bree's always looked young.

246
00:12:02,217 --> 00:12:04,195
When she used to go out with her grandkid,

247
00:12:04,196 --> 00:12:06,687
people would think he was her son.

248
00:12:06,721 --> 00:12:09,523
Wait. Bree's a grandmother?

249
00:12:09,558 --> 00:12:12,159
How did I not know this?

250
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,062
Okay, sweetie, I am taking
the baby over to Gaby's.

251
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:23,439
The girls are meeting for
poker. I'll be back in a few.

252
00:12:23,474 --> 00:12:26,576
- You're not staying?
- No. I'm really just doing a drive-by.

253
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,978
Last week, Paige spit up on Gaby's couch,

254
00:12:29,012 --> 00:12:31,514
so now she's pretty much baby non grata.

255
00:12:31,548 --> 00:12:33,327
Why don't you just leave her with me?

256
00:12:33,328 --> 00:12:34,965
Then you can stay for your game.

257
00:12:34,966 --> 00:12:36,832
But we usually play for a couple of hours.

258
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:37,897
Give me a kiss.

259
00:12:37,898 --> 00:12:41,791
So? You'll be right
next door if I need you.

260
00:12:41,859 --> 00:12:44,150
Oh, don't toy with me.

261
00:12:44,151 --> 00:12:47,087
I'm operating on two hours
of sleep. I'm vulnerable.

262
00:12:47,121 --> 00:12:50,357
Go. We'll be fine.

263
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,501
I love watching my baby sister.

264
00:12:52,535 --> 00:12:53,969
- Oh!
- It's fun.

265
00:12:54,003 --> 00:12:56,405
Penny Lynn Scavo,

266
00:12:56,439 --> 00:12:59,942
you are officially my favorite. 

267
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,969
We are gonna leave
everything to you in our will.

268
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,234
Keep in mind we're poor,

269
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:09,904
so it's rely more of a symbolic gesture.

270
00:13:16,912 --> 00:13:18,512
Listen, guys,

271
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,214
uh, before we start...

272
00:13:20,248 --> 00:13:22,950
I've been keeping something from you,

273
00:13:23,018 --> 00:13:27,254
but I'm gonna tell you because
you're my dearest and oldest friends.

274
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,401
Well, I've only known you two weeks,

275
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,177
but I don't want to be
rude and tell you to leave.

276
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,037
See this picture? This
is my daughter Grace.

277
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,327
Oh, my God. Gaby.

278
00:13:43,328 --> 00:13:45,577
I can't imagine what you're going through.

279
00:13:45,578 --> 00:13:47,713
I'd be out of my mind.
How can you function?

280
00:13:47,747 --> 00:13:50,682
Well, we were knocked sideways at first,

281
00:13:50,717 --> 00:13:52,751
but since we met Grace,
it's been a blessing.

282
00:13:52,785 --> 00:13:54,753
Thank God the parents are lovely.

283
00:13:54,787 --> 00:13:57,556
I mean, this is the kind of
thing you see on the news.

284
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:00,453
- Who else knows about this?
- Very few people,

285
00:14:00,454 --> 00:14:02,183
and I need you guys to keep it that way.

286
00:14:02,184 --> 00:14:04,442
Well, of course we'll be discreet.

287
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:06,905
Definitely, for Juanita's sake.

288
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,282
Oh, don't worry about me.

289
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:14,486
Up until today, I
thought you were Juanita.

290
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:18,156
So... tell us what it was like.

291
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,858
Amazing.

292
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:22,516
I looked into her eyes and felt that pull.

293
00:14:22,517 --> 00:14:25,516
Well, you carried her for nine months.

294
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:29,467
There's this one thing she
did that was incredibly moving.

295
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:32,404
She came up to me...

296
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:35,224
and within two seconds of touching my bag,

297
00:14:35,225 --> 00:14:36,908
she knew it was expensive.

298
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,035
Now that is a hallmark moment.

299
00:14:40,069 --> 00:14:41,803
You don't understand.

300
00:14:41,838 --> 00:14:43,772
When I was a kid,

301
00:14:43,806 --> 00:14:46,675
I used to sneak "Vogues"
out of my aunt's hair salon

302
00:14:46,709 --> 00:14:49,244
and make my own high fashion paper dolls.

303
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:51,880
I know what it's like to be that kid,

304
00:14:51,914 --> 00:14:55,584
with her face pressed against
the department store window.

305
00:14:55,618 --> 00:14:57,759
Grace is me at her age.

306
00:14:59,822 --> 00:15:02,056
So I decided to do something for her.

307
00:15:05,094 --> 00:15:08,062
Her own little starter Chanel.

308
00:15:14,069 --> 00:15:16,771
You are the best mother ever.

309
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,267
Paul?

310
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,771
Paul?

311
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,201
- What are you doing?
- Please go home.

312
00:15:43,436 --> 00:15:47,606
I just wanna understand, that's all.

313
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,541
Are we going to move here?

314
00:15:49,575 --> 00:15:50,775
No.

315
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,969
Then why would you buy this house?

316
00:15:55,004 --> 00:15:59,174
It must be filled with so
many unpleasant memories.

317
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,635
I don't see any unpleasant memories.

318
00:16:05,271 --> 00:16:07,138
I see the couch

319
00:16:07,173 --> 00:16:10,608
where my wife and I would sit
and have our morning coffee

320
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:16,781
I see the Christmas tree in
the corner by the fireplace.

321
00:16:18,951 --> 00:16:21,119
I see the chair... 

322
00:16:21,153 --> 00:16:25,056
where I would sit and
read stories to my son.

323
00:16:27,726 --> 00:16:29,994
I was loved in this house.

324
00:16:30,028 --> 00:16:31,929
I had a real marriage here.

325
00:16:31,963 --> 00:16:34,532
Our marriage is real, Paul.

326
00:16:34,566 --> 00:16:35,833
It's just...

327
00:16:36,367 --> 00:16:38,135
this is hard for me,

328
00:16:38,169 --> 00:16:41,638
and... and you keeping things from me

329
00:16:41,673 --> 00:16:44,374
doesn't make it any easier.

330
00:16:54,352 --> 00:16:56,419
You're right.

331
00:16:56,454 --> 00:16:58,622
There should be no secrets between us.

332
00:17:04,261 --> 00:17:06,997
Secrets are why this
house is empty right now.

333
00:17:14,371 --> 00:17:17,006
Sorry I'm late, but I
think you'll be happy

334
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:19,642
when you hear why.

335
00:17:19,677 --> 00:17:22,085
Black Eyed Peas. Row 15, center.

336
00:17:22,086 --> 00:17:23,079
How cool is that?

337
00:17:23,113 --> 00:17:25,682
Wow, that's just...

338
00:17:25,716 --> 00:17:27,050
Wow.

339
00:17:27,084 --> 00:17:29,852
- You like them, right?
- Of course.

340
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,046
You sound a little... underwhelmed.

341
00:17:34,047 --> 00:17:35,771
No. Not at all.

342
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:37,406
I live to rock.

343
00:17:38,675 --> 00:17:41,477
You know, I'm not as
old as you might think.

344
00:17:43,947 --> 00:17:46,368
- Grandma!
- Surprise!

345
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,934
What are you doing here?

346
00:17:51,969 --> 00:17:54,036
Visiting. We're here all weekend.

347
00:17:54,071 --> 00:17:56,138
Um... hello.

348
00:17:56,173 --> 00:17:57,351
- Hi.
- Keith,

349
00:17:57,352 --> 00:17:59,742
this is my daughter
Danielle and this is my...

350
00:17:59,776 --> 00:18:02,278
her, uh, son Benjamin.

351
00:18:02,312 --> 00:18:05,448
Danielle, this is my, um... friend Keith.

352
00:18:05,482 --> 00:18:07,383
We were just... going out.

353
00:18:07,417 --> 00:18:09,952
Grandma! Grandma! Look what I bought you!

354
00:18:09,987 --> 00:18:11,520
It's slippers.

355
00:18:11,588 --> 00:18:14,615
My grandma has bad
circulation. Don't you, grandma?

356
00:18:14,616 --> 00:18:16,025
Please stop calling me that!

357
00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:18,457
You... precious child.

358
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,002
You know what? You guys came all this way.

359
00:18:22,037 --> 00:18:24,138
You should spend tonight together.

360
00:18:24,172 --> 00:18:27,301
No. No, no, no. If... if you
guys had plans, you should go.

361
00:18:27,302 --> 00:18:28,444
We'll be fine.

362
00:18:28,445 --> 00:18:31,254
Bree, there's... there's nothing
more important than family.

363
00:18:31,255 --> 00:18:33,189
We'll go out another time.

364
00:18:33,425 --> 00:18:35,192
You're very sweet.

365
00:18:37,095 --> 00:18:38,996
Nice meeting both of you.

366
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:41,331
Uh, thank you so much.

367
00:18:41,566 --> 00:18:44,234
Uh, I guess I heard wrong.

368
00:18:44,268 --> 00:18:47,004
You seem to be bouncing back just fine.

369
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:49,239
What are you talking about?

370
00:18:49,273 --> 00:18:50,741
When your friend called,

371
00:18:50,775 --> 00:18:53,910
she said you were having a
hard time since Orson left.

372
00:18:53,945 --> 00:18:56,947
Uh, by any chance,

373
00:18:56,981 --> 00:18:59,549
is this friend named Renee?

374
00:18:59,584 --> 00:19:03,120
She sent us first class tickets.
I wish I had a friend like that.

375
00:19:03,154 --> 00:19:06,790
Oh, trust me, you don't.

376
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,869
Oh, come on. Come on.

377
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,749
What the hell?

378
00:19:26,662 --> 00:19:28,299
Maxine, pick up.

379
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,593
They're already putting up a billboard.

380
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,935
You... you said they weren't
gonna start advertising

381
00:19:32,969 --> 00:19:34,903
for a couple of... oh, my God!

382
00:19:40,543 --> 00:19:43,011
- Wait! Wait! Stop!
- Huh?

383
00:19:43,046 --> 00:19:45,981
- You... you can't put that up there! That's me.
- So?

384
00:19:46,015 --> 00:19:47,916
So... so people will see!

385
00:19:47,951 --> 00:19:49,351
My friends will see!

386
00:19:49,385 --> 00:19:51,286
Lady, with a body like that,

387
00:19:51,321 --> 00:19:53,488
no one's even gonna
notice you have a head.

388
00:19:53,523 --> 00:19:56,892
No, no, no! No, no!
You can't! No, stop! Oh!

389
00:19:58,861 --> 00:20:02,497
- What the hell are you doin'?
- Protecting my dignity!

390
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,402
Hey there, Mrs. McCluskey.
Nice day, isn't it?

391
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,768
I've seen better. What do you want?

392
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:20,236
You're direct.

393
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:22,171
I love that about you.

394
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,301
Truth is, I was wondering

395
00:20:24,335 --> 00:20:26,736
if you had any interest
in selling your home.

396
00:20:26,771 --> 00:20:28,672
Well, get ready to love me again.

397
00:20:28,706 --> 00:20:29,873
No.

398
00:20:29,907 --> 00:20:32,142
Aren't you tired of
caring for this place...

399
00:20:32,176 --> 00:20:34,244
the big lawn and all these stairs?

400
00:20:34,278 --> 00:20:37,047
Yeah, your concern is touching.

401
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,134
What's your game here?

402
00:20:39,202 --> 00:20:41,574
I just love this neighborhood so much,

403
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:43,655
I'd hate to see this house
fall into the wrong hands

404
00:20:43,656 --> 00:20:44,807
after you're gone.

405
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,467
I'm not going anywhere.

406
00:20:46,501 --> 00:20:47,902
I hope you're right,

407
00:20:47,936 --> 00:20:50,004
but the years do he a way of flying by,

408
00:20:50,038 --> 00:20:51,846
and I thought you might
wanna unload this place

409
00:20:51,847 --> 00:20:54,208
while you still have the upper hand.

410
00:20:54,276 --> 00:20:55,710
Upper hand?

411
00:20:55,744 --> 00:20:57,411
Yes.

412
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,535
Right now you're sharp as a tack.

413
00:21:00,569 --> 00:21:02,537
But one day, your hip will break

414
00:21:02,571 --> 00:21:04,505
or you'll suffer a massive stroke,

415
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:07,675
and the doctors will say you
can longer live on your own.

416
00:21:07,743 --> 00:21:09,610
And when that day comes,

417
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:12,280
potential buyers who don't
care about you like I do

418
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:14,215
will know that you're desperate.

419
00:21:14,249 --> 00:21:16,150
They'll smell the blood in the water.

420
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,118
People will start smelling your blood

421
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:21,692
if you don't get off my porch.

422
00:21:21,693 --> 00:21:24,212
All right. Didn't mean to upset you.

423
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,601
My offer still stands.

424
00:21:27,636 --> 00:21:29,036
As I said,

425
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:32,006
it all comes from my great love
for this beautiful neighborhood.

426
00:21:33,608 --> 00:21:37,178
Be careful on those stairs now.

427
00:21:41,483 --> 00:21:44,351
Look who's missing her big sister.

428
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:45,786
Oh. Oh, oh, oh.

429
00:21:47,622 --> 00:21:49,523
There. You are really so good with her.

430
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,926
Listen, I'm gonna take a quick
jog. Be back in 20 minutes.

431
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,194
- Mom.
- Yeah?

432
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:56,143
I've got a test today. I
cannot be late for the bus.

433
00:21:56,144 --> 00:21:58,807
I hear ya loud and
clear. I'll be back in 15.

434
00:21:58,808 --> 00:21:59,800
You might wanna smell her diaper.

435
00:21:59,835 --> 00:22:01,735
I think she left you a little present.

436
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,935
Hey, Lynette?

437
00:22:08,969 --> 00:22:10,903
Um, I need to talk to you.

438
00:22:10,938 --> 00:22:11,904
Sure.

439
00:22:11,939 --> 00:22:14,207
Oh. You're jogging again.

440
00:22:14,241 --> 00:22:15,908
Where's, uh, the baby?

441
00:22:15,943 --> 00:22:20,213
Uh, Penny is watching her.
It is the most amazing thing.

442
00:22:20,247 --> 00:22:22,682
Only when you've spawned as much as I have

443
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:24,617
do you learn the glorious truth...

444
00:22:24,651 --> 00:22:27,320
the older ones can watch the younger ones.

445
00:22:27,354 --> 00:22:29,489
Babies having babies... bad.

446
00:22:29,523 --> 00:22:32,825
Babies raising babies... genius!

447
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,533
I'm happy for you.

448
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,068
You don't look happy.

449
00:22:37,102 --> 00:22:38,936
That's why we need to talk.

450
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:40,671
Okay.

451
00:22:42,674 --> 00:22:46,147
She flew them here first
class? That is vintage Renee.

452
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:48,851
Yes, a voracious libido
and unlimited funds...

453
00:22:48,886 --> 00:22:51,454
a deadly combination.

454
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:56,492
And now she's taking Keith
to dinner tomorrow night.

455
00:22:56,527 --> 00:22:58,122
How did you find that out?

456
00:22:58,123 --> 00:22:59,935
Well, he called to
make sure it was okay...

457
00:22:59,969 --> 00:23:02,371
which, course, it isn't.
But what could I say?

458
00:23:02,405 --> 00:23:03,806
Don't say anything.

459
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,293
Wait till she's crossing the
street and then run her over.

460
00:23:06,294 --> 00:23:08,105
No, I'm too fond of my car.

461
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,532
You have to fight back somehow.

462
00:23:10,533 --> 00:23:12,434
It's the only thing Renee understands.

463
00:23:12,468 --> 00:23:14,970
But how? I mean, you
know her better than I do.

464
00:23:15,004 --> 00:23:17,648
What could I do to humiliate her?

465
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,568
She once slept with a rodeo clown...

466
00:23:21,602 --> 00:23:24,604
But he's a senator now. Uh...

467
00:23:24,639 --> 00:23:28,137
Oh, she's got this
really weird belly button.

468
00:23:28,138 --> 00:23:32,748
But by the time he finds that
out, they're already getting it on.

469
00:23:32,749 --> 00:23:36,476
She used to freak out whenever
"The wizard of Oz" was on tv.

470
00:23:36,477 --> 00:23:37,493
Why?

471
00:23:37,494 --> 00:23:39,645
Mm, I think it was the munchkins.

472
00:23:39,653 --> 00:23:41,272
There's something about little people

473
00:23:41,273 --> 00:23:42,711
that gives her the heebie-jeebies.

474
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:45,525
Oh, crap! Penny's gonna
be late for school.

475
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,801
Sorry I couldn't help.

476
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:52,739
Oh, no. You helped.

477
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,544
Penny!

478
00:23:57,578 --> 00:24:00,080
I'm sorry! I forgot my phone!

479
00:24:00,114 --> 00:24:03,483
Uh, grab your stuff, and I'll drive you!

480
00:24:03,517 --> 00:24:04,684
Wha...

481
00:24:08,623 --> 00:24:10,857
where's my baby?

482
00:24:14,962 --> 00:24:18,198
Stop breathing on my sister!

483
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,185
Hi. I'm Lynette Scavo.

484
00:24:26,186 --> 00:24:27,593
I need to find my daughter Penny.

485
00:24:27,594 --> 00:24:30,266
Yeah. We've been expecting you.

486
00:24:30,267 --> 00:24:32,134
Principal's office is in the back.

487
00:24:32,169 --> 00:24:33,936
Oh. Thank you.

488
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,035
You're in so much trouble.

489
00:24:53,473 --> 00:24:55,007
So...

490
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:57,251
You left your 2-month-old baby

491
00:24:57,252 --> 00:24:59,693
in the care of your 11-year-old daughter.

492
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:02,337
What can I say?

493
00:25:02,469 --> 00:25:04,832
I'm not one of those helicopter parents.

494
00:25:08,808 --> 00:25:11,076
Come on.

495
00:25:11,111 --> 00:25:14,196
Give me a break. I am raising five kids.

496
00:25:14,197 --> 00:25:17,037
You have no idea how hard that is.

497
00:25:22,922 --> 00:25:25,156
Eight?

498
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:29,627
Well, clearly, you're very competitive.

499
00:25:29,662 --> 00:25:31,596
I talked to Penny.

500
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,498
I think you should know

501
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,900
she's helping you out
more than you realize.

502
00:25:35,935 --> 00:25:37,456
What do you mean?

503
00:25:37,457 --> 00:25:40,416
Do you know Penny takes the
baby monitor to bed with her

504
00:25:40,417 --> 00:25:43,274
so she can get up for the feedings?

505
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:45,076
She does?

506
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,568
As a result,

507
00:25:47,602 --> 00:25:49,937
the poor girl is exhausted.

508
00:25:49,971 --> 00:25:52,339
She fell asleep in
social studies yesterday.

509
00:25:52,373 --> 00:25:55,042
I had no idea.

510
00:25:55,076 --> 00:25:56,810
Oh, my gosh.

511
00:25:56,845 --> 00:26:00,646
Yes, I will talk to
Penny when she gets home,

512
00:26:00,647 --> 00:26:02,551
and I will fix this.

513
00:26:02,557 --> 00:26:05,125
Yes, that would be nice.

514
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:07,561
Okay.

515
00:26:07,595 --> 00:26:10,577
You know what? Enough
with the judgmental tone.

516
00:26:10,578 --> 00:26:13,582
Come on. Who among us is a perfect mother?

517
00:26:26,379 --> 00:26:28,113
Gaby.

518
00:26:28,148 --> 00:26:30,049
Is everything okay?

519
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:31,684
Yeah. Yeah, everything's fine.

520
00:26:31,718 --> 00:26:33,652
I was just hoping Grace would be home.

521
00:26:33,687 --> 00:26:35,621
I thought we were supposed to call first

522
00:26:35,655 --> 00:26:36,917
if we wanted to see the kids.

523
00:26:36,918 --> 00:26:40,526
I know, I know, but I
was in the neighborhood.

524
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,927
Uh, is she here?

525
00:26:41,962 --> 00:26:43,562
No.

526
00:26:43,597 --> 00:26:46,465
Okay. Well, could you
give this to her for me?

527
00:26:51,171 --> 00:26:54,449
Thank you, but Grace already has a purse.

528
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:56,494
Really? Is it Chanel?

529
00:26:56,495 --> 00:26:59,166
No. We bought it at a flea market for $2,

530
00:26:59,167 --> 00:27:01,079
and she's very happy with it.

531
00:27:01,113 --> 00:27:04,234
I know, but don't you think she'd
like this one a little better?

532
00:27:04,235 --> 00:27:07,685
Not if she never sees it.

533
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,755
Don't you think I would like
to give my children nice things?

534
00:27:10,789 --> 00:27:12,423
We're not like you.

535
00:27:12,458 --> 00:27:15,793
We can't afford luxuries. We can
barely afford the necessities.

536
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,067
Look, if you guys need help...

537
00:27:18,068 --> 00:27:22,169
What we need is for you
to let us be who we are,

538
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:24,297
not who you are.

539
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,055
Goodbye, Gaby.

540
00:27:26,056 --> 00:27:29,036
Please, call next time.

541
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,179
You said I had a month.

542
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,546
I said I thought it was a month.

543
00:27:38,547 --> 00:27:41,446
It's the Internet.
Everything moves very fast.

544
00:27:41,447 --> 00:27:43,054
How many billboards are there?

545
00:27:43,055 --> 00:27:47,177
They talked about a big ad
campaign, so I guess a lot.

546
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,234
You have got to call them.

547
00:27:49,268 --> 00:27:52,904
Get them to stop it, or at least
put some other girl up there.

548
00:27:52,905 --> 00:27:54,005
Something.

549
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,941
Honey, I tried to warn you.

550
00:27:55,975 --> 00:27:58,043
It's beyond my control now.

551
00:27:58,077 --> 00:27:59,744
Please help me.

552
00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:03,014
What if Mike sees me splayed
across that billboard?

553
00:28:03,082 --> 00:28:06,585
He's gonna recognize those panties!

554
00:28:06,619 --> 00:28:09,321
He gave them to me for our anniversary!

555
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:15,159
I'll make a call.

556
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:32,801
I'm sorry I took the baby to school.

557
00:28:32,802 --> 00:28:34,731
I had a math test, and
I didn't want to be late.

558
00:28:34,732 --> 00:28:37,514
Hey, sweetie. Hey. Hey.

559
00:28:39,351 --> 00:28:41,418
You didn't do anything wrong.

560
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:44,321
I did.

561
00:28:44,356 --> 00:28:46,523
Come here. Sit down.

562
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,368
I understand you've been
taking the baby monitor

563
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,437
into your room at night.

564
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:01,439
Just so you can sleep.

565
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:05,576
I appreciate that,

566
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:08,080
and I appreciate how often

567
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:10,687
you have been looking
after your little sister.

568
00:29:10,688 --> 00:29:13,489
Well, I know how you like
to go see your friends

569
00:29:13,524 --> 00:29:15,925
and go jogging and stuff.

570
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,393
Yeah, I do.

571
00:29:17,428 --> 00:29:20,630
And you're different when
you get to do those things.

572
00:29:20,664 --> 00:29:23,633
You laugh more. You're not as cranky.

573
00:29:23,667 --> 00:29:26,669
You stay up late and
play board games with us.

574
00:29:27,704 --> 00:29:30,572
I like that mommy better.

575
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,102
I like that mommy better, too.

576
00:29:36,137 --> 00:29:39,239
But it's not your job to take care of me.

577
00:29:39,273 --> 00:29:42,909
Your job is to...

578
00:29:42,943 --> 00:29:46,212
watch television and
eat way too much candy.

579
00:29:46,247 --> 00:29:50,116
And my job is to make sure
that's all your job is.

580
00:29:50,151 --> 00:29:52,152
Okay.

581
00:29:56,357 --> 00:29:59,292
Off you go.

582
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:05,660
That...

583
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,650
was really sweet.

584
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,699
I know.

585
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,770
Get me a nanny.

586
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,460
What?

587
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:14,360
I am drowning here.

588
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:17,249
You heard what Penny said.
I'm not myself anymore.

589
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:19,320
And when I'm not taking
it out on the kids,

590
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:22,860
I'm taking advantage
of them. So I need help.

591
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,520
How about if I pitch in more?

592
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,010
Oh, Tom.

593
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:32,300
What a lovely, hollow offer
that you'll never back up.

594
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:34,050
Get me a nanny.

595
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:41,300
You bought an 8-year-old
girl a $1,400 purse?

596
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,910
Oh, lighten up. It's not like
I got her the matching wallet.

597
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,000
So what did Carmen say?

598
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:48,090
She went all "Grapes of wrath" on me,

599
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,120
'cause God forbid that woman let
her daughter have nice things.

600
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,289
"That woman" is her mother,
and I'm with her on this.

601
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:56,310
You have no right to give
Grace expensive gifts.

602
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,810
- Yes, I do.
- Why?

603
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,429
Because she was supposed
to have all this stuff!

604
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,940
We were supposed to give it to her.

605
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:04,679
This is why I didn't
want us to look for her,

606
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,150
because we had no idea what
would happen once we found her.

607
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:08,750
But you looked, and we met her,

608
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,650
and now we're falling
in love with this girl.

609
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,749
And if you spook these people,

610
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:15,200
they can take her away from us forever.

611
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:25,329
Morning, Mrs. McCluskey.
How are you today?

612
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:27,070
I feel great. Sorry to disappoint you.

613
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:28,360
Oh. Oh... what?

614
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:31,299
Just had my annual physical.

615
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,210
Doc says I'm gonna be around for years.

616
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:36,560
So you can tell that
vulture husband of yours

617
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:39,180
he'll have to pick at
someone else's carcass.

618
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:41,100
What are you talking about?

619
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,650
Something smells good.

620
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:47,760
I'm making stew.

621
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:51,470
So... how was your day?

622
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,250
Fine.

623
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:55,730
Anything interesting happen?

624
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:58,710
No, not really.

625
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,530
You didn't...

626
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,310
talk to anyone?

627
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:08,090
Who would talk to me?

628
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,550
I'm gonna go wash up.

629
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:32,010
You are going to love the sea urchin.

630
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,750
Looks a little sketchy.

631
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,090
Most of the fish I eat
comes in a basket with fries.

632
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:44,590
You're funny.

633
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,720
And you eat out of a basket.

634
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:48,410
I like that.

635
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,740
Everything okay?

636
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:00,990
I just thought I saw...

637
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,360
never mind.

638
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:06,220
So... anyway,

639
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:09,680
I thought after dinner
we could go to a club.

640
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:11,559
What do you think of jazz?

641
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:15,200
I think it's the sea urchin of music.

642
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,240
Okay, um, did you see that?

643
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,150
See what?

644
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,100
It was probably nothing. Um...

645
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:29,980
I thought I saw...

646
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,260
Okay, you're...

647
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,000
you're just a kid.

648
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,560
What is the matter with you?

649
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:42,100
I'm so sorry.

650
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:45,969
I don't want you to think I'm odd.

651
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:48,789
Y... you see, when... I was a child,

652
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:51,830
there was this incident... at the circus.

653
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:53,659
And ever since then,

654
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:56,940
I have always been terrified of...

655
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,940
Hey! Don't I know you?

656
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,200
Get him away! Get him away! Get him away!

657
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,270
What's wrong?!

658
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:10,340
Is he there with his tiny hands?
I can't look at his tiny hands!

659
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,970
I am... I am so sorry.

660
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,860
I don't know what the hell she's doing.

661
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,730
It's okay.

662
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,570
Obviously, I made a mistake.

663
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:30,240
Oh, my God. Did he go? I can't look.

664
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,480
He's gone.

665
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,430
So come down.

666
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:37,330
Everyone is staring.

667
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:43,580
You should've seen the look on her face.

668
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:46,809
Well, I couldn't see her,
but I certainly heard her...

669
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:49,220
and it was magnificent.

670
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:53,140
Happy to help out. Bye,
Bree. See ya in church.

671
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,880
$9,000?

672
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:05,130
Hey, my partners spent a lot of
money printing those billboards.

673
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,020
And they'll agree not to put them up,

674
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:09,130
but they are not gonna eat the cost.

675
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:13,550
Honey, I did the best I could.

676
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:16,320
I talked them down from $12,000.

677
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,440
It's still a huge hit.

678
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,769
I mean, it puts us
right back where we were

679
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:22,830
before I started doing this stuff.

680
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,910
I know.

681
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:27,640
And what's Mike gonna say when
he notices the money is missing?

682
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:31,870
Oh, God. I hadn't even thought of that.

683
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:36,630
Maybe I should just let
them put up the billboards.

684
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:38,790
At least then when he
kills me, I'll be famous.

685
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:41,160
You know, there is another way.

686
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:43,110
What do you mean?

687
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:47,770
Well, you could earn that
money back, and fast, too.

688
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,000
But you'd have to...

689
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,379
Never mind. Forget I said anything.

690
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,880
No, no. What? What... what is it?

691
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,549
Well, there are other services
our web site provides...

692
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:03,150
things I've kept hidden from you
because of the boundaries you've set.

693
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:05,550
But if you're willing to go

694
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:08,280
beyond those boundaries...

695
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,090
Are you talking about prostitution?

696
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,050
God, no!

697
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,830
Nothing like that!

698
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:19,230
Just private on-screen interactions

699
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:22,470
of a... racier nature.

700
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,820
How racy?

701
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:28,240
How much money do you wanna make?

702
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:58,000
How dare you.

703
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:59,900
Good morning, Renee.

704
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:03,020
How dare you exploit a
traumatic childhood memory.

705
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:06,690
Yes, I heard you had some sort
of episode with a little person.

706
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:09,040
Oh, look. He followed you home.

707
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:18,349
Very funny. I wonder how Keith will react

708
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:20,310
when I tell him it was
you who ruined our date.

709
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:21,760
About the same as when he finds out

710
00:37:21,761 --> 00:37:24,450
you used my grandson to ruin ours.

711
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:30,530
Oh. Here's Keith now.

712
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,330
Why don't we ask him
who he wants to be with?

713
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:34,910
We can't...

714
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:37,259
put him on the spot like that.

715
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,769
Bree, you're getting all red.

716
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:41,890
Is that a hot flash or
you just losing your nerve?

717
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:47,210
I was gonna finish up with those sconces.

718
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,450
Everything okay here?

719
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,370
Not exactly.

720
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:57,040
Can we ask you something?

721
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,280
If you had to choose between...

722
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:02,950
forest green or brown

723
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:05,310
for the trim, which would you prefer?

724
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:11,339
Forest green... I guess.

725
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:14,269
Great. Then why don't you, uh,
run down to the hardware store

726
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:15,460
and have them mix you up a batch?

727
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,280
Scoot.

728
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,360
What's the matter,
Bree? Afraid you'll lose?

729
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,490
You know what?

730
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,230
I think I am.

731
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:32,700
He's all yours.

732
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,460
Well, that's not any fun.
I thought you liked him.

733
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,140
I do, but... I don't get his references.

734
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,820
I can't stay up late like he does.

735
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:43,060
I'm being silly.

736
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:46,129
I feel like one of those
clichés people make fun of...

737
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:48,520
the desperate, predatory divorcée.

738
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:50,880
You mean like me?

739
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,830
Well, yeah.

740
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:55,140
Do you know why people make fun of us?

741
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:57,440
They're jealous,

742
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:01,280
because we still have the
guts to go after what we want.

743
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:06,020
You think he can make you happy?

744
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:09,040
I think so.

745
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:19,510
Then go for it.

746
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:21,450
My gift to you.

747
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:25,360
Why are you being so nice to me?

748
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:28,909
Based on my dinner under
the rainbow last night,

749
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:31,600
I'd rather have you as
a friend than an enemy.

750
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,560
Now go.

751
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:40,190
Keith, hang on! I think I'll join you!

752
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,080
Uh, really nice of you to have us over.

753
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:54,870
- Maybe next time you
can come to our house.
- Absolutely.

754
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:56,770
You know, I think it's great

755
00:39:56,771 --> 00:39:58,580
that out of this unfortunate situation,

756
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,530
we could all end up being friends.

757
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,900
Yes. We're very lucky people.

758
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,220
- Bet you can't catch me!
- Bet you can't catch me!

759
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,280
So now we pinch off a small piece of masa,

760
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:16,140
and you roll it into a ball.

761
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:18,330
Is this big enough?

762
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,250
It's perfect. Ay.

763
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,340
I really love your house Mrs. Solis.

764
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,400
Oh, well, thank you, honey.

765
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,010
Would you like a tour?

766
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:33,620
Uh-huh. Come on.

767
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:40,590
Wow. It's so big.

768
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,660
You have a tv in your bedroom?

769
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:46,280
Lucky.

770
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:47,810
Yes, we are very lucky.

771
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:51,050
Is that a jewelry box?

772
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:56,050
You want to take a look?

773
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,160
Yeah.

774
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:01,300
It's all so pretty.

775
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:04,810
I can't wait till I grow up
so I can have beautiful things.

776
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,250
You like that?

777
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:16,290
It's a gift I bought myself
with my first big modeling check.

778
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:23,110
I want you to have it. You
deserve beautiful things.

779
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:27,200
I don't know. My mom might get mad.

780
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,660
Then we'll make it... our little secret.

781
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:34,080
Thank you.

782
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,530
I want a purse like that someday.

783
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,530
Well, then I'm gonna make sure you get it.

784
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:50,160
It's called a purse,

785
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:52,489
and as every woman knows,

786
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:55,180
it can hold just about anything...

787
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,240
from a bottle for a baby...

788
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:05,040
to a check for protection...

789
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:11,580
to a gift for a new friend.

790
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:16,210
Whatever you find inside,

791
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:19,250
there's one thing you can be sure of...

792
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:25,330
every purse says something
about the woman who owns it...

793
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:30,140
whether she knows it or not.
