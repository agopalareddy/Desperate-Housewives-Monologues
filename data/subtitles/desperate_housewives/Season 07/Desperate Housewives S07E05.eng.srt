1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:01,765
Previously on...

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,213
Bree's affair with her
contractor broke new ground.

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,592
Perhaps we could make
you dinner. Like a date?

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,351
I can't wait till I grow up so

5
00:00:10,352 --> 00:00:12,002
I can have beautiful things.

6
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:14,818
Gaby doted on her
biological daughter Grace.

7
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,872
Looking who's missing
her big sister.

8
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,171
Lynette had too much on her hands.

9
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:20,790
Get me a nanny.

10
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:24,492
Susan found that keeping
her new job a secret...

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,131
My partners are not
gonna eat the cost.

12
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,032
$9,000?

13
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,739
Was going to be expensive.

14
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:33,631
But her secret had
already been discovered.

15
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,443
Emma Graham was an ordinary woman.

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,960
And like most ordinary women,

17
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:49,017
she had an extraordinary dream.

18
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,280
She wanted her husband to know

19
00:00:52,281 --> 00:00:54,210
she was more than just a wife.

20
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:57,870
She wanted her daughter to know

21
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:00,207
she was more than just a mother.

22
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,202
She wanted her neighbors to know

23
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,020
she was more than just the

24
00:01:05,021 --> 00:01:06,720
woman who lived next door.

25
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:08,588
So Emma made a decision

26
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,612
to turn her dream into reality.

27
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,537
I wanna do a cabaret show.

28
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,442
I'll need a band, orchestrations,

29
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:17,621
and sound equipment,

30
00:01:17,622 --> 00:01:19,550
and you are gonna pay for all of it.

31
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,056
And that is how Emma Graham's

32
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,648
friends and neighbors

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,302
came to gather at the
smokehouse lounge

34
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:30,440
two weeks later.

35
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,342
They would soon learn

36
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:40,075
Emma Graham wasn't so
ordinary after all.

37
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:44,061
Yes, Emma's dream of
sharing her talent

38
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,683
had finally come true.

39
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,036
Unfortunately, the high note
that ended the evening...

40
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,698
Did not come from Emma.

41
00:02:57,847 --> 00:02:59,199
I'm gonna kill you!

42
00:02:59,307 --> 00:03:00,080
You whore!

43
00:03:01,885 --> 00:03:03,233
Okay, ladies, please!

44
00:03:06,255 --> 00:03:07,473
Uhh! Oh, my nose!

45
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,366
My nose, my nose. Aah!

46
00:03:30,005 --> 00:03:32,489
She knew what she
was doing was wrong.

47
00:03:33,475 --> 00:03:35,467
She knew it was very dangerous.

48
00:03:37,845 --> 00:03:40,376
She knew the risks
if people found out.

49
00:03:42,315 --> 00:03:44,296
But Susan Delfino was determined

50
00:03:45,685 --> 00:03:47,583
to get back to Wisteria Lane,

51
00:03:48,855 --> 00:03:51,831
and that is how her world
began to fall apart.

52
00:03:53,031 --> 00:03:54,108
Hi. I'm Tanya.

53
00:03:55,441 --> 00:03:58,112
Thank you for choosing
to spend time with me.

54
00:03:58,881 --> 00:04:01,036
I'm all yours for the next hour.

55
00:04:01,711 --> 00:04:02,976
How about we start

56
00:04:03,151 --> 00:04:06,043
by getting to know each
other a little better?

57
00:04:06,151 --> 00:04:07,416
Show me your jugs.

58
00:04:08,891 --> 00:04:10,081
Aren't you...

59
00:04:10,682 --> 00:04:11,476
A frisky little...

60
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:13,521
ooh!

61
00:04:13,521 --> 00:04:16,983
I see some dirt under
the coffee table.

62
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:18,942
Would you like me to vacuum?

63
00:04:20,831 --> 00:04:24,223
Sure, right after you take
out those tots and shake 'em.

64
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:25,104
Slow down.

65
00:04:26,501 --> 00:04:27,672
We've got, um...

66
00:04:29,412 --> 00:04:31,006
59 more minutes together.

67
00:04:32,442 --> 00:04:33,215
And, uh...

68
00:04:34,642 --> 00:04:37,137
Isn't it sexier to
warm each other up

69
00:04:38,082 --> 00:04:40,063
with some... naughty talk first?

70
00:04:42,852 --> 00:04:44,023
I have to listen

71
00:04:44,352 --> 00:04:47,254
to my old lady's
blah-blah-blah all day long.

72
00:04:47,362 --> 00:04:49,924
Lose the top so I can
see those money-makers.

73
00:04:50,032 --> 00:04:52,798
What, are you reading
from a boob thesaurus?

74
00:04:52,932 --> 00:04:53,611
Come on.

75
00:04:54,432 --> 00:04:56,518
Isn't there some romantic fantasy

76
00:04:56,932 --> 00:04:58,841
you'd like to share with me?

77
00:04:59,202 --> 00:04:59,735
Okay.

78
00:05:02,712 --> 00:05:03,919
Are you lactating?

79
00:05:04,212 --> 00:05:04,891
Oh, pig!

80
00:05:06,642 --> 00:05:07,907
You never do that.

81
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:10,404
You never pull the
plug on a session!

82
00:05:10,512 --> 00:05:12,175
The guy was a total perv

83
00:05:12,522 --> 00:05:14,414
who clearly had
serious mother issues.

84
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:16,326
You cost us a major client.

85
00:05:17,492 --> 00:05:18,886
And God forbid he starts

86
00:05:18,887 --> 00:05:20,454
talking about this at work.

87
00:05:20,562 --> 00:05:22,941
We could lose the
whole city council!

88
00:05:23,232 --> 00:05:24,063
I'm sorry.

89
00:05:26,402 --> 00:05:27,573
I lost my nerve.

90
00:05:27,902 --> 00:05:29,659
Susan, I can't keep giving

91
00:05:30,487 --> 00:05:31,940
you chances like this.

92
00:05:36,942 --> 00:05:38,066
Va-va-va-broom.

93
00:05:39,442 --> 00:05:42,104
Oh, you want a private
session with Tanya.

94
00:05:42,212 --> 00:05:44,555
I'm sorry.
That's not gonna happen.

95
00:05:44,682 --> 00:05:46,652
She doesn't work for me anymore.

96
00:05:50,292 --> 00:05:52,295
Oh, once again, I am so sorry.

97
00:05:53,462 --> 00:05:54,821
I forgot that French

98
00:05:55,339 --> 00:05:56,933
restaurant was so formal.

99
00:05:57,792 --> 00:05:59,455
Next time, I will pick a

100
00:05:59,888 --> 00:06:01,388
place with fewer forks.

101
00:06:02,002 --> 00:06:03,388
Yeah, thanks again for

102
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:04,964
helping me out with that.

103
00:06:05,072 --> 00:06:07,133
Well, I... I had a lot of fun.

104
00:06:08,942 --> 00:06:09,762
Good night.

105
00:06:13,082 --> 00:06:13,615
Keith?

106
00:06:14,282 --> 00:06:16,484
Did you really have a lot of fun?

107
00:06:17,052 --> 00:06:18,516
Yeah. Why do you ask?

108
00:06:19,422 --> 00:06:21,814
Well, because it's our third date,
and you just

109
00:06:21,922 --> 00:06:23,718
kissed me like you were saying

110
00:06:23,719 --> 00:06:25,154
good night to your aunt.

111
00:06:25,262 --> 00:06:27,684
I'm trying to treat
you like a lady.

112
00:06:27,792 --> 00:06:29,010
Oh, that's sweet.

113
00:06:30,762 --> 00:06:31,980
Now knock it off.

114
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:38,639
Three times?

115
00:06:39,742 --> 00:06:40,714
In one night.

116
00:06:41,149 --> 00:06:42,707
Oh, my God. Three times

117
00:06:42,831 --> 00:06:44,331
is my entire September.

118
00:06:44,619 --> 00:06:47,103
I just had the nicest
chat with Grace.

119
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:48,953
She said the cutest thing.

120
00:06:48,954 --> 00:06:51,021
Bree had sex three times last night.

121
00:06:51,129 --> 00:06:51,955
Oh, screw my story.

122
00:06:51,956 --> 00:06:52,781
--Tell me everything.

123
00:06:56,075 --> 00:06:57,434
The sex was amazing.

124
00:06:57,612 --> 00:06:58,854
It was like...
oh,

125
00:06:58,855 --> 00:07:00,096
how to describe it?

126
00:07:00,412 --> 00:07:01,138
An opera.

127
00:07:02,812 --> 00:07:04,511
You fell asleep during it?

128
00:07:04,922 --> 00:07:05,847
I'm telling you,

129
00:07:05,848 --> 00:07:07,814
making love to a man in his 30s...

130
00:07:07,922 --> 00:07:10,314
it's like... oh,
the... the sun shines brighter,

131
00:07:10,422 --> 00:07:13,130
the grass looks greener,
food tastes better.

132
00:07:13,422 --> 00:07:15,624
Okay, we get it.
You had sex three times.

133
00:07:15,732 --> 00:07:16,265
Three!

134
00:07:18,662 --> 00:07:21,392
Oh, hey, look.
Renee's back from New York.

135
00:07:21,772 --> 00:07:23,424
Oh, God, you invited her?

136
00:07:23,572 --> 00:07:25,564
What, now you don't like Renee?

137
00:07:25,672 --> 00:07:28,564
I know she's your friend,
but isn't she kind of

138
00:07:28,672 --> 00:07:30,664
a self-absorbed,
narcissistic diva?

139
00:07:30,772 --> 00:07:33,397
Good point. We already
have one of those.

140
00:07:36,032 --> 00:07:37,934
Drop the drugstore
champagne, ladies,

141
00:07:38,042 --> 00:07:39,934
and make way for the real stuff.

142
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,296
We are celebrating!

143
00:07:41,472 --> 00:07:42,831
What's the occasion?

144
00:07:43,742 --> 00:07:45,134
Oh, my divorce settlement.

145
00:07:45,242 --> 00:07:48,174
I just soaked my ex for... well,
a whole lot of these.

146
00:07:48,282 --> 00:07:50,180
I thought there was a prenup.

147
00:07:50,782 --> 00:07:53,144
Yep, there was,
but no prenup is a match

148
00:07:53,252 --> 00:07:54,375
for the legal team of grind 'em,

149
00:07:54,483 --> 00:07:56,144
screw 'em, and Rothenberg.
That was iced tea.

150
00:07:56,252 --> 00:07:57,962
Well, I just made it fun.

151
00:07:59,092 --> 00:08:01,924
Now I wanna have you all
over for dinner tonight.

152
00:08:02,032 --> 00:08:03,924
I've got two more
cases of champagne,

153
00:08:04,032 --> 00:08:06,494
a truckload of caviar,
and a pile of money

154
00:08:06,602 --> 00:08:09,285
to roll around naked in.
What do you say?

155
00:08:09,902 --> 00:08:12,694
If there's more of this,
I am definitely there.

156
00:08:12,802 --> 00:08:14,404
Great. How about you, Bree?

157
00:08:14,512 --> 00:08:17,674
Oh, I wish I could, but I have a date.
I need to carbo-load.

158
00:08:17,782 --> 00:08:20,674
I've gotta pass, too.
We still haven't found a nanny,

159
00:08:20,782 --> 00:08:23,144
and so Tom's working late,
so I have to go... yawn. Susan.

160
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,644
I would, but it's macaroni
and coupon clipping night

161
00:08:25,752 --> 00:08:26,677
at my house.

162
00:08:27,722 --> 00:08:30,955
Yawn and sad. Well,
I guess it's just you and me.

163
00:08:32,522 --> 00:08:33,494
Gabs and nee.

164
00:08:34,862 --> 00:08:35,881
That is great.

165
00:08:36,362 --> 00:08:39,494
We were just talking about how
much you two have in common.

166
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:40,820
Weren't we, gabs?

167
00:08:43,202 --> 00:08:45,034
Thanks so much.
Your baby's really cute.

168
00:08:45,142 --> 00:08:47,572
It was nice meeting you.
We'll let you know. Thanks.

169
00:08:48,912 --> 00:08:50,904
Well? Any luck finding a nanny?

170
00:08:51,842 --> 00:08:53,744
No. I've interviewed eight girls.

171
00:08:53,852 --> 00:08:55,704
They're all either
too inexperienced

172
00:08:55,812 --> 00:08:56,972
or too expensive.

173
00:08:57,482 --> 00:09:00,013
Hmm. What about the
one with the boobs?

174
00:09:00,452 --> 00:09:02,900
And that's why we're
not hiring her.

175
00:09:03,392 --> 00:09:05,055
Well, don't give up yet,

176
00:09:05,362 --> 00:09:07,788
because I found us
one more applicant.

177
00:09:08,062 --> 00:09:10,148
You did? You took the initiative?

178
00:09:11,362 --> 00:09:12,522
Why so surprised?

179
00:09:13,472 --> 00:09:16,102
Our Christmas lights are
still up from last year.

180
00:09:17,602 --> 00:09:20,332
And not only is she punctual,
she's early.

181
00:09:20,642 --> 00:09:23,242
Who is it? Um,
let me put it this way.

182
00:09:23,542 --> 00:09:25,136
Lynette, remember how you

183
00:09:26,078 --> 00:09:27,730
always used to hate yams?

184
00:09:29,512 --> 00:09:31,874
And they weren't so bad.
And over time,

185
00:09:31,982 --> 00:09:34,444
you realized, "I like yams.
Yams are great."

186
00:09:34,552 --> 00:09:36,088
Well, sometimes, Lynette,

187
00:09:36,804 --> 00:09:38,210
people are like yams.

188
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:40,239
What'd you do?

189
00:09:46,302 --> 00:09:47,065
Are you insane?

190
00:09:47,173 --> 00:09:49,064
I was talking to her last night.

191
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:50,803
I-I mentioned we might need help,

192
00:09:50,804 --> 00:09:52,105
and she volunteered.

193
00:09:52,542 --> 00:09:53,420
You get it.

194
00:09:58,712 --> 00:09:59,245
Tommy!

195
00:10:01,482 --> 00:10:02,015
Mom!

196
00:10:04,552 --> 00:10:06,754
Why couldn't she have been a yam?

197
00:10:09,862 --> 00:10:11,394
We need directions to go to...

198
00:10:11,502 --> 00:10:12,864
Okay, so this Tina...

199
00:10:12,972 --> 00:10:15,634
was that the first
time he cheated on you?

200
00:10:15,742 --> 00:10:18,085
Uh, I don't know.
You hear stories.

201
00:10:19,242 --> 00:10:21,574
There was this thing
during the all-star game...

202
00:10:21,682 --> 00:10:23,721
pictures of Doug in the tabloids

203
00:10:23,864 --> 00:10:25,458
with a cocktail waitress.

204
00:10:26,152 --> 00:10:28,414
But then he came back
with a Bulgarian bracelet,

205
00:10:28,522 --> 00:10:30,373
so we never talked about it.

206
00:10:31,022 --> 00:10:32,854
God, being married
to a pro athlete...

207
00:10:32,962 --> 00:10:34,520
it must be a nightmare.

208
00:10:35,192 --> 00:10:37,562
Well, sounds like you
are well rid of him.

209
00:10:39,702 --> 00:10:42,291
You know, I feel like
you get me, Gaby.

210
00:10:44,772 --> 00:10:46,565
And you know why? Because...

211
00:10:48,142 --> 00:10:50,076
We're both extremely beautiful.

212
00:10:50,342 --> 00:10:53,459
God bless you for having
the courage to say that.

213
00:10:54,952 --> 00:10:56,704
Only someone who looks like us

214
00:10:56,812 --> 00:10:59,343
can understand what
a burden it can be.

215
00:11:01,872 --> 00:11:02,992
Actually, it's pretty awesome.

216
00:11:05,482 --> 00:11:08,264
Oh, you know, sometimes
I drive fast on purpose

217
00:11:08,372 --> 00:11:10,562
just to see if I can flirt
my way out of a ticket.

218
00:11:10,822 --> 00:11:11,982
Amateur hour. Oh?

219
00:11:12,292 --> 00:11:15,124
I got a bank manager to shave
a point off our mortgage

220
00:11:15,232 --> 00:11:17,524
by bending over to
pick up a pencil.

221
00:11:17,632 --> 00:11:20,624
To this day, Carlos calls
it my million-dollar ass.

222
00:11:20,732 --> 00:11:22,196
Wait. I can top that.

223
00:11:22,702 --> 00:11:25,855
Yesterday these babies
earned me a cool $8 million.

224
00:11:26,612 --> 00:11:27,830
What do you mean?

225
00:11:28,712 --> 00:11:31,544
Well, I wore a slut dress
to my settlement hearing,

226
00:11:31,652 --> 00:11:34,570
and afterwards,
Doug's lawyer came to my hotel

227
00:11:35,082 --> 00:11:36,090
to renegotiate.

228
00:11:36,922 --> 00:11:39,066
You slept with him? You're awful.

229
00:11:41,182 --> 00:11:41,814
I know.

230
00:11:43,422 --> 00:11:45,232
I shouldn't have told you that.

231
00:11:46,762 --> 00:11:47,922
Keep it to yourself.

232
00:11:48,252 --> 00:11:50,184
Oh, honey, I won't tell anyone.

233
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,635
Um... I don't know
you well enough.

234
00:11:53,792 --> 00:11:56,192
You've gotta give
me some dirt on you.

235
00:11:58,362 --> 00:11:58,895
Hmm.

236
00:12:00,362 --> 00:12:00,895
Huh.

237
00:12:03,572 --> 00:12:05,329
I can't think of anything.

238
00:12:05,502 --> 00:12:06,557
Really? Nothing?

239
00:12:08,402 --> 00:12:10,184
Like, say... plastic surgery?

240
00:12:11,642 --> 00:12:12,175
What?

241
00:12:14,212 --> 00:12:17,025
Honey, a scalpel has
never touched this body.

242
00:12:17,912 --> 00:12:19,234
Maybe not the body...

243
00:12:19,342 --> 00:12:21,174
But that nose is a Dr. Brotski.

244
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,086
I'd know his work anywhere.

245
00:12:23,922 --> 00:12:25,773
How dare you. I am insulted.

246
00:12:29,092 --> 00:12:31,784
Okay, fine. I was 19.
It was just a little bump.

247
00:12:31,892 --> 00:12:33,602
That's what they all say.

248
00:12:33,862 --> 00:12:36,194
Did you have a
deviated septum, too?

249
00:12:36,492 --> 00:12:38,531
Don't tell anyone. Carlos knows,

250
00:12:39,102 --> 00:12:41,894
but if the girls find out,
I'd never hear the end of it.

251
00:12:42,002 --> 00:12:43,853
Of course. You can trust me.

252
00:12:44,202 --> 00:12:45,221
I'm beautiful.

253
00:12:47,722 --> 00:12:48,622
That's true.

254
00:12:50,942 --> 00:12:51,856
Good morning.

255
00:12:53,642 --> 00:12:55,518
Good morning, sweetheart. Mwah.

256
00:12:57,622 --> 00:12:59,321
Still not speaking to you.

257
00:13:02,722 --> 00:13:05,347
Your breakfast will
be ready in a minute.

258
00:13:06,492 --> 00:13:08,448
You want coffee. I'll get it.

259
00:13:10,562 --> 00:13:12,394
Your scrambled eggs are ready.

260
00:13:12,502 --> 00:13:15,326
Oh, mom, I was hoping
for your French toast.

261
00:13:15,632 --> 00:13:17,694
She made you eggs, Tom. Eat them.

262
00:13:17,802 --> 00:13:20,094
No, it's no problem.
You read your paper,

263
00:13:20,202 --> 00:13:22,404
and I'll fix it right up, Rodney.

264
00:13:22,672 --> 00:13:23,738
Uh, Tommy, mom.

265
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,081
Oh, didn't I say that?

266
00:13:26,482 --> 00:13:29,482
Oh, it's just that you look
so much like your father.

267
00:13:30,922 --> 00:13:32,234
Oh, gosh, what now?

268
00:13:32,652 --> 00:13:34,022
Oh, let me get her.

269
00:13:34,622 --> 00:13:36,296
It's what I'm here for.

270
00:13:37,562 --> 00:13:39,120
Would you look at that?

271
00:13:39,662 --> 00:13:41,477
My mother is on top of it,

272
00:13:41,632 --> 00:13:44,713
and you get to sit and
have coffee with the man

273
00:13:45,052 --> 00:13:47,792
that you kicked three times
"in your sleep" last night.

274
00:13:47,902 --> 00:13:50,726
Look, I can take your
mother in small doses,

275
00:13:50,912 --> 00:13:52,951
but her living here every day...

276
00:13:53,142 --> 00:13:55,084
you know, I never got
what this thing is

277
00:13:55,192 --> 00:13:57,824
you have with her.
I mean, you say you love her.

278
00:13:57,932 --> 00:13:59,735
She's great with the kids.
'S your beef?

279
00:13:59,843 --> 00:14:01,315
Okay, you really wanna
know what it is?

280
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:03,368
Yeah. Okay. I can't stand the

281
00:14:03,369 --> 00:14:05,068
person she turns you into.

282
00:14:05,422 --> 00:14:06,742
You become this Neanderthal...

283
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,834
Pfft. While she's tripping
over her apron strings

284
00:14:09,942 --> 00:14:12,114
to serve you.
So she likes to dote on me,

285
00:14:12,222 --> 00:14:14,332
and I don't mind the attention.
What's the big deal?

286
00:14:14,702 --> 00:14:16,987
False alarm. She's fine.
Thank you.

287
00:14:18,612 --> 00:14:19,802
Oh, and by the way...

288
00:14:20,712 --> 00:14:21,872
More coffee. Yes.

289
00:14:22,132 --> 00:14:22,952
Right away.

290
00:14:24,622 --> 00:14:25,665
Just know if you ever

291
00:14:25,773 --> 00:14:27,125
hold your coffee cup up to me,

292
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,052
you will be tapping
it with a stump.

293
00:14:36,312 --> 00:14:37,952
Mike. I was gonna call you.

294
00:14:37,953 --> 00:14:39,592
I was talking to Paul young.

295
00:14:39,842 --> 00:14:42,762
He and the new missus are
really enjoying the house.

296
00:14:43,512 --> 00:14:44,205
Are they?

297
00:14:44,313 --> 00:14:46,615
Yeah, and Paul was wondering
if you would be interested

298
00:14:46,723 --> 00:14:47,712
in selling the place.

299
00:14:47,882 --> 00:14:50,642
He's willing to make a
very generous offer.

300
00:14:51,792 --> 00:14:53,643
Lee, I never kicked your ass

301
00:14:53,972 --> 00:14:55,254
for renting our house to that guy

302
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:57,992
'cause you didn't know our history,
but now you do.

303
00:14:58,592 --> 00:15:00,202
So I gotta wonder,
are you an idiot?

304
00:15:01,182 --> 00:15:02,922
I'm sorry. Paul wanted me to ask.

305
00:15:04,562 --> 00:15:07,014
Susan and I are working
really hard to save money.

306
00:15:07,122 --> 00:15:08,572
You tell Paul that the
day his lease is up,

307
00:15:09,072 --> 00:15:10,002
we're moving home.

308
00:15:13,722 --> 00:15:14,255
Hello?

309
00:15:14,612 --> 00:15:16,812
Hey, it's me.
I just ran into Mike.

310
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:18,876
Did you ask him about the house?

311
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:20,252
Yeah. He wasn't interested.

312
00:15:20,692 --> 00:15:23,342
Did you tell him I'm willing
to pay above market value?

313
00:15:23,552 --> 00:15:25,472
I could have, but I didn't
want to get punched.

314
00:15:26,522 --> 00:15:27,872
You disappoint me, Lee.

315
00:15:28,392 --> 00:15:29,932
There are other houses, Paul.

316
00:15:30,072 --> 00:15:31,489
No. I need this one.

317
00:15:33,052 --> 00:15:35,212
Fortunately, I have another
way to handle this.

318
00:15:38,822 --> 00:15:40,850
Your deposit should clear Monday,

319
00:15:41,092 --> 00:15:42,632
and this will be your balance.

320
00:15:45,982 --> 00:15:47,540
Wait. This isn't right.

321
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:49,632
We should have a lot
more money in here.

322
00:15:53,092 --> 00:15:56,245
Yes. The silver bracelet
that you cleaned last year

323
00:15:56,662 --> 00:15:57,782
that belonged to my grandmother.

324
00:15:58,372 --> 00:16:00,328
What do you think it's worth?

325
00:16:05,162 --> 00:16:05,982
Okay. Um...

326
00:16:06,962 --> 00:16:08,492
Yeah, I'll come by tomorrow.

327
00:16:20,932 --> 00:16:22,602
Hi. Here's that gold
necklace you lent me.

328
00:16:22,912 --> 00:16:25,152
What do you need it for?
You guys going on a fancy date?

329
00:16:26,302 --> 00:16:27,520
No. I just, uh...

330
00:16:28,512 --> 00:16:29,822
Just needed it back.

331
00:16:30,682 --> 00:16:31,408
You okay?

332
00:16:33,712 --> 00:16:35,232
You want to talk about something?

333
00:16:36,752 --> 00:16:37,489
I can't.

334
00:16:41,392 --> 00:16:43,192
Um... I'm gonna...
I'm gonna find you a tissue.

335
00:16:50,912 --> 00:16:52,075
Susan, I was just at the bank.

336
00:16:52,183 --> 00:16:54,744
We're missing $9,000 from
our checking account.

337
00:16:54,852 --> 00:16:56,656
You went to the bank? Yeah.

338
00:16:56,872 --> 00:16:58,632
What the hell's going on?
Did you take that money out?

339
00:16:58,882 --> 00:16:59,415
Yes.

340
00:17:01,202 --> 00:17:01,735
Susan?

341
00:17:03,192 --> 00:17:04,562
Susan, what happened
to that money?

342
00:17:04,892 --> 00:17:06,122
She lent it to me.

343
00:17:07,562 --> 00:17:09,564
W-we had some bills
from Paige's birth

344
00:17:09,672 --> 00:17:11,112
that weren't covered by insurance,

345
00:17:11,282 --> 00:17:13,702
and Susan very kindly
offered to help us out.

346
00:17:16,332 --> 00:17:17,304
That's right.

347
00:17:17,862 --> 00:17:20,744
And she's gonna pay it
back by... by Friday.

348
00:17:21,482 --> 00:17:22,443
With interest.

349
00:17:24,222 --> 00:17:26,847
Or not... because,
I mean, we're friends,

350
00:17:27,582 --> 00:17:28,952
so... why would you
charge us interest?

351
00:17:33,472 --> 00:17:34,432
I gotta get back to work...

352
00:17:36,742 --> 00:17:38,972
In case any of our other
friends need money.

353
00:17:43,622 --> 00:17:44,625
Thank you so much.

354
00:17:44,733 --> 00:17:45,998
You're so welcome.

355
00:17:49,232 --> 00:17:50,978
Anything you wanna tell me?

356
00:17:51,342 --> 00:17:51,875
Yeah.

357
00:17:53,612 --> 00:17:55,112
But promise you won't yell?

358
00:17:56,282 --> 00:17:58,227
You did porn on the Internet?!

359
00:17:58,772 --> 00:18:01,151
No, it was just
cleaning in lingerie.

360
00:18:01,562 --> 00:18:04,584
I... there... I was never naked.
There was no sex.

361
00:18:04,692 --> 00:18:05,808
Well, unless the guys were

362
00:18:05,809 --> 00:18:06,925
watching for cleaning tips,

363
00:18:07,033 --> 00:18:08,251
it's porn. Susan!

364
00:18:08,674 --> 00:18:10,232
How could you do this?!

365
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,461
Look, I feel bad enough already.

366
00:18:13,042 --> 00:18:16,032
Well, you should! What if
Mike finds out? Or your kids?

367
00:18:16,622 --> 00:18:19,114
Hey, it is really easy
for you to come down here

368
00:18:19,222 --> 00:18:20,943
from your 5-bedroom house in

369
00:18:20,944 --> 00:18:22,664
the suburbs and criticize me.

370
00:18:22,772 --> 00:18:24,834
I am not on Wisteria Lane anymore.

371
00:18:24,942 --> 00:18:26,804
Look at what Mike and I are

372
00:18:26,889 --> 00:18:28,447
trying to climb out of!

373
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:31,444
We can't even afford hot
lunches for MJ At school,

374
00:18:31,552 --> 00:18:34,162
so just think about that
next time you wanna judge me.

375
00:18:41,192 --> 00:18:41,725
Okay.

376
00:18:43,202 --> 00:18:45,581
Done judging.
Back to being a friend.

377
00:18:48,842 --> 00:18:50,812
I'm sorry you had to do that.

378
00:18:53,752 --> 00:18:54,431
Me, too.

379
00:19:06,172 --> 00:19:07,392
Doug, what are you doing here?

380
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:08,932
I had to see you.

381
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:12,592
Well, I'd invite you in,
but it's late and I hate you.

382
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:16,530
Baby, I flew all this way.
At least hear me out.

383
00:19:20,722 --> 00:19:22,042
If it's about the settlement,

384
00:19:22,712 --> 00:19:23,882
you're wasting your breath.

385
00:19:25,052 --> 00:19:25,930
I miss you.

386
00:19:26,972 --> 00:19:28,654
Well, how does Tina
feel about that?

387
00:19:28,762 --> 00:19:30,822
That was a stupid mistake,
and it's over.

388
00:19:33,542 --> 00:19:34,792
I know I screwed up...

389
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:36,111
Big this time.

390
00:19:36,782 --> 00:19:38,092
Give me another chance.

391
00:19:41,212 --> 00:19:43,892
I'm soy, Doug,
but I'm actually happy here.

392
00:19:45,482 --> 00:19:48,142
I'm getting a fresh start,
making new friends.

393
00:19:48,352 --> 00:19:51,035
Come on. Can't be happy
here in Mayberry.

394
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:53,492
You were made for Manhattan.

395
00:19:54,432 --> 00:19:56,236
Oh, by the way. Cartier ed.

396
00:19:58,542 --> 00:19:59,652
They miss you, too.

397
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:02,312
Oh, Doug, don't do this to me.

398
00:20:02,432 --> 00:20:04,582
Think about everything
we had together.

399
00:20:05,512 --> 00:20:06,636
I want it back.

400
00:20:08,062 --> 00:20:08,893
Don't you?

401
00:20:14,052 --> 00:20:16,362
Oh, I can't stop
thinking about that play.

402
00:20:16,612 --> 00:20:18,405
What do you think the
angel represented

403
00:20:18,513 --> 00:20:21,442
when he flew down in the
middle of the night?

404
00:20:21,732 --> 00:20:24,312
I don't know. I was too
busy looking for the wires.

405
00:20:28,072 --> 00:20:31,048
So, are you, uh,
in the mood for some dessert?

406
00:20:31,632 --> 00:20:32,253
Totally.

407
00:20:35,332 --> 00:20:37,418
I think the angel symbolized hope

408
00:20:38,492 --> 00:20:41,258
or a-a second chance
at redemption, perhaps.

409
00:20:43,652 --> 00:20:46,197
'Course, another
interpretation, I suppose,

410
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:47,482
could be...

411
00:20:51,582 --> 00:20:52,214
oh, my.

412
00:20:54,442 --> 00:20:56,652
When you said "dessert,
" I just assumed...

413
00:20:58,592 --> 00:21:01,382
Well, there's no two
ways to interpret that.

414
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:08,394
Ohh! That was incredible.

415
00:21:08,502 --> 00:21:10,325
Where did you learn to do that,
and why the hell am I asking?

416
00:21:10,433 --> 00:21:11,742
Don't tell me. Mmm.

417
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:15,582
Oh, let's just say you inspire me.

418
00:21:20,532 --> 00:21:21,744
Well, that'll teach me

419
00:21:21,852 --> 00:21:23,512
to let you walk behind
me up the stairs.

420
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,164
What is that?

421
00:21:30,892 --> 00:21:32,920
I guess inspiration struck again.

422
00:21:40,392 --> 00:21:42,042
Please tell me you're
here to stab me.

423
00:21:43,592 --> 00:21:44,125
What?

424
00:21:45,132 --> 00:21:46,491
Nothing. Come on in.

425
00:21:58,242 --> 00:21:59,082
What's that?

426
00:22:01,512 --> 00:22:03,404
Aren't they supposed to
be sliced and peeled?

427
00:22:03,512 --> 00:22:04,589
I'm too tired.

428
00:22:05,542 --> 00:22:06,822
Please get that away from me.

429
00:22:08,392 --> 00:22:10,922
I guess someone was
with Keith last night.

430
00:22:11,312 --> 00:22:14,183
Were you once, twice,
three times not a lady?

431
00:22:14,782 --> 00:22:17,277
It's not funny.
Six hours we had sex.

432
00:22:18,782 --> 00:22:20,352
I feel like the Holland tunnel.

433
00:22:20,512 --> 00:22:22,004
Honey, why don't you just tell him

434
00:22:22,112 --> 00:22:24,425
you need a little break?
Because he's young. If I turn down

435
00:22:24,533 --> 00:22:26,672
a roll in the hay,
he's gonna think I'm an old woman.

436
00:22:26,822 --> 00:22:28,632
You just said "roll in the hay."

437
00:22:28,633 --> 00:22:30,442
I think that ship has sailed.

438
00:22:31,902 --> 00:22:34,394
Ohh! Well, I better figure
out how to slow him down

439
00:22:34,502 --> 00:22:36,202
before this John Wayne walk

440
00:22:36,203 --> 00:22:37,786
becomes permanent. Coming!

441
00:22:42,792 --> 00:22:44,350
Come on in. Hey, girls.

442
00:22:45,912 --> 00:22:47,034
Hey! Hey! You are just in time.

443
00:22:47,142 --> 00:22:49,814
I mixed up a signature drink
in honor of your divorce.

444
00:22:49,922 --> 00:22:51,925
I wouldn't pour that just yet.

445
00:22:53,292 --> 00:22:55,642
I'm starting to rethink
this whole divorce thing.

446
00:22:57,032 --> 00:22:58,264
Doug showed up last night.

447
00:22:58,372 --> 00:23:00,012
He flew in from New York?

448
00:23:00,262 --> 00:23:02,710
I know. He said
it's over with Tina.

449
00:23:03,962 --> 00:23:04,981
Wants me back.

450
00:23:05,762 --> 00:23:07,179
And he gave me this.

451
00:23:10,402 --> 00:23:11,924
Oh, Doug screws up a lot,

452
00:23:12,032 --> 00:23:14,903
but his apologies are
always the 4th of July.

453
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:18,272
Wow. Tom's apologies are
more like arbor day.

454
00:23:18,712 --> 00:23:20,223
But he cheated on you.

455
00:23:20,372 --> 00:23:23,630
Okay. A guy who has women
throwing themselves at him

456
00:23:23,822 --> 00:23:24,612
in every city.

457
00:23:25,412 --> 00:23:27,534
Meanwhile, we had ten great years,

458
00:23:27,642 --> 00:23:30,534
and he loved me and cared
for me and I think I should

459
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:31,902
give him another chance.

460
00:23:33,332 --> 00:23:34,210
Am I crazy?

461
00:23:35,252 --> 00:23:37,934
Well, you have invested
ten years in the marriage.

462
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:40,122
No one goes that long without
a few bumps in the road.

463
00:23:40,762 --> 00:23:42,392
Okay, then. I'm doing it.

464
00:23:43,192 --> 00:23:44,122
Are you insane?

465
00:23:44,832 --> 00:23:46,245
The man dumped you
for another woman.

466
00:23:46,353 --> 00:23:48,902
Well, he apologized.
Can't I forgive him?

467
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:51,583
Why? Because he gave
you a stupid ring?

468
00:23:52,072 --> 00:23:54,802
He's buying you off again.
Open your eyes.

469
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:57,040
Hey. It's my marriage anyway.

470
00:23:58,362 --> 00:24:00,632
Why don't you just keep
your fake nose out of it?

471
00:24:08,622 --> 00:24:09,835
What does she mean, fake?

472
00:24:09,943 --> 00:24:12,568
Gabrielle Solis,
did you have a nose job?

473
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:16,042
Hello! We're talking
about Trampy McTrinket!

474
00:24:17,282 --> 00:24:18,665
After all these years of you

475
00:24:18,773 --> 00:24:20,942
bragging about your
natural beauty?

476
00:24:21,332 --> 00:24:22,550
Oh, I never brag.

477
00:24:22,732 --> 00:24:25,064
You once called your face
proof of God's existence.

478
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:27,784
You said I was a fraud for
wearing a padded swimsuit.

479
00:24:27,892 --> 00:24:30,915
And now we find out you've
had plastic surgery.

480
00:24:32,212 --> 00:24:33,822
Ooh! That changes everything.

481
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:36,802
No, it doesn't.
It wasn't plastic surgery.

482
00:24:36,932 --> 00:24:39,781
It was corrective rhinoplasty
for a deviated...

483
00:24:42,382 --> 00:24:43,788
You will regret this.

484
00:24:45,432 --> 00:24:47,576
Oh, Gaby, come on! We're kidding!

485
00:24:48,902 --> 00:24:50,522
Don't get your nose out of joint.

486
00:24:59,312 --> 00:25:01,362
Bree Van De Kamp had a problem.

487
00:25:02,332 --> 00:25:04,266
Her boyfriend's sexual appetite

488
00:25:04,618 --> 00:25:06,458
was proving to be exhausting.

489
00:25:08,232 --> 00:25:09,942
And then out of the blue,

490
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:11,982
Bree came up with a solution.

491
00:25:12,872 --> 00:25:15,552
Since Keith's demands
were overwhelming her,

492
00:25:17,092 --> 00:25:19,460
why not make some
overwhelming demands

493
00:25:19,942 --> 00:25:20,820
of her own?

494
00:25:22,602 --> 00:25:23,882
Wow. There's a lot of work here.

495
00:25:24,432 --> 00:25:26,362
I guess I could get
it done by Friday.

496
00:25:26,752 --> 00:25:28,994
Oh, no, I'm gonna need
it sooner than that.

497
00:25:29,102 --> 00:25:30,591
Certainly... by tonight.

498
00:25:40,442 --> 00:25:41,345
Hey, Allison made you

499
00:25:41,453 --> 00:25:43,444
your favorite cookies for
your trip. Macaroons?!

500
00:25:43,552 --> 00:25:44,492
Oatmeal raisin.

501
00:25:45,392 --> 00:25:46,562
Oh. Those were my dad's favorites.

502
00:25:46,852 --> 00:25:48,083
Maybe you can trade them with

503
00:25:48,084 --> 00:25:49,314
the boy next to you on the plane

504
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:52,445
for his snack. Make fun,
but you have to admit,

505
00:25:53,222 --> 00:25:54,405
she's been great with the baby.

506
00:25:54,513 --> 00:25:57,462
She has been great.
You were right. I was wrong.

507
00:25:59,362 --> 00:26:01,034
Oh, if only these were macaroons.

508
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:03,672
This would be the
best day of my life.

509
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:07,542
Call me when you land.
See you, babe.

510
00:26:10,822 --> 00:26:12,295
Ah. So can I help
with the lasagna?

511
00:26:12,403 --> 00:26:14,714
Actually, the boys said
they wanted meatloaf,

512
00:26:14,822 --> 00:26:16,644
so I switched the menu. Now sit.

513
00:26:16,752 --> 00:26:17,525
All right.

514
00:26:18,012 --> 00:26:19,707
So Tom was telling me about

515
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:21,266
you going back to work.

516
00:26:22,582 --> 00:26:24,972
I must say,
I don't understand that.

517
00:26:25,482 --> 00:26:26,548
Well, that's...

518
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:28,035
Okay.

519
00:26:33,272 --> 00:26:34,292
What are you doing?

520
00:26:34,692 --> 00:26:35,918
I'm out of milk.

521
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:37,544
Well, your grandmother
is not here to serve you.

522
00:26:37,652 --> 00:26:40,072
I don't mind, dear.
See? She wants to.

523
00:26:41,762 --> 00:26:43,342
Soda, gram? Make it two.

524
00:26:44,492 --> 00:26:45,025
Boys!

525
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:49,146
Penny, I have to get the meat,
so you get the sodas.

526
00:26:51,272 --> 00:26:52,045
Uh... why?

527
00:26:52,512 --> 00:26:54,432
Why? We have to take
care of our men.

528
00:26:56,692 --> 00:26:57,512
Penny, sit.

529
00:26:58,492 --> 00:27:00,302
You boys want a drink,
get up and get it.

530
00:27:00,502 --> 00:27:01,944
They had such a long day...

531
00:27:02,052 --> 00:27:04,713
classes and then their
after-school sports.

532
00:27:04,892 --> 00:27:08,454
Allison, in this house,
the women don't wait on the men.

533
00:27:08,722 --> 00:27:11,072
The men get off their
asses and help themselves.

534
00:27:11,782 --> 00:27:15,203
When did it become a sin to
take care of your family?

535
00:27:15,492 --> 00:27:18,194
Oh, you modern women.
You just plop out a baby,

536
00:27:18,302 --> 00:27:20,952
and then you can't wait to get
back to your silly careers.

537
00:27:21,252 --> 00:27:22,868
I took care of my boys.

538
00:27:23,492 --> 00:27:24,845
When my husband came home,

539
00:27:24,953 --> 00:27:27,874
there was a hot meal waiting
for him on the table.

540
00:27:27,982 --> 00:27:29,822
He never wanted for anything.

541
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:32,194
Yeah, and how did
that work out for you?

542
00:27:32,302 --> 00:27:33,742
He had an affair and left.

543
00:27:53,632 --> 00:27:54,311
Damn it.

544
00:28:02,052 --> 00:28:03,445
I didn't realize you
were still here.

545
00:28:03,553 --> 00:28:04,922
Have you been working
this whole time?

546
00:28:05,042 --> 00:28:06,932
You said to get it all done today.

547
00:28:08,582 --> 00:28:10,433
So if there is nothing else,

548
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:13,502
I would like to go home
and slip into a coma.

549
00:28:14,102 --> 00:28:15,822
Why don't you spend
the night here?

550
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:18,145
I'd hate to see you
out there driving

551
00:28:18,253 --> 00:28:19,872
when you're so exhausted.

552
00:28:21,042 --> 00:28:22,636
You are exhausted, right?

553
00:28:23,142 --> 00:28:23,763
Totally.

554
00:28:24,792 --> 00:28:26,643
Every part of my body hurts.

555
00:28:27,282 --> 00:28:28,055
Then stay.

556
00:28:28,902 --> 00:28:29,722
Sleep here.

557
00:28:32,652 --> 00:28:34,434
In the morning, I will make you...

558
00:28:34,542 --> 00:28:35,597
Belgian waffles.

559
00:28:36,242 --> 00:28:38,386
That will be my special thank you

560
00:28:38,562 --> 00:28:39,852
for all of your hard work.

561
00:28:56,822 --> 00:28:57,822
What are you doing?

562
00:28:58,442 --> 00:28:59,902
I thought of another
way you could thank me.

563
00:29:00,952 --> 00:29:03,682
You said every part
of your body was sore.

564
00:29:05,112 --> 00:29:06,522
One part's doing okay.

565
00:29:07,062 --> 00:29:07,595
Okay!

566
00:29:10,242 --> 00:29:11,905
That's it! What's wrong?

567
00:29:12,302 --> 00:29:13,985
I can't do it!
I can no longer keep up

568
00:29:14,093 --> 00:29:15,478
with you and your Woody

569
00:29:15,479 --> 00:29:16,742
woodpecker sex drive!

570
00:29:17,132 --> 00:29:19,144
What? I-I'm just
gonna say it, okay?

571
00:29:19,252 --> 00:29:19,964
I'm older than you.

572
00:29:20,072 --> 00:29:22,142
I don't ha your stamina,
and I can't keep up.

573
00:29:22,682 --> 00:29:24,392
You... you can't keep up?

574
00:29:25,422 --> 00:29:27,804
I'm dating a woman who
talks to waiters in French

575
00:29:27,912 --> 00:29:29,184
and wants to discuss a play's

576
00:29:29,185 --> 00:29:30,324
symbolism during halftime.

577
00:29:30,432 --> 00:29:31,773
Intermission. You see?

578
00:29:31,774 --> 00:29:33,784
You're ten times smarter than me.

579
00:29:33,892 --> 00:29:35,294
That's why I keep sexing you up.

580
00:29:35,402 --> 00:29:36,872
I'm trying to keep you interested.

581
00:29:44,702 --> 00:29:46,788
Make no mistake. I am interested.

582
00:29:49,052 --> 00:29:50,909
I love when I am prattling on

583
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:52,894
about the meaning of the angel,

584
00:29:53,002 --> 00:29:54,408
you notice the wires.

585
00:29:55,922 --> 00:29:57,884
You have your own way
of seeing the world,

586
00:29:57,992 --> 00:30:00,053
and it's fun and down-to-earth

587
00:30:03,012 --> 00:30:04,570
and everything I'm not.

588
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:13,892
So you're saying you
like me how I am?

589
00:30:15,956 --> 00:30:17,959
Wow. I hadn't thought of that.

590
00:30:22,143 --> 00:30:22,676
Yes.

591
00:30:23,711 --> 00:30:24,484
Very much.

592
00:30:28,116 --> 00:30:31,082
Now put that thing away
and let's get some rest.

593
00:30:41,069 --> 00:30:42,240
Hi. Who are you?

594
00:30:43,405 --> 00:30:45,665
Oh, I'm Jenny. I'm the new nanny.

595
00:30:46,764 --> 00:30:48,134
Ah! Isn't it great?

596
00:30:49,909 --> 00:30:52,294
I offered her a little more money,
and she took the job.

597
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,908
She's the one with the boobs.
Remember?

598
00:30:57,016 --> 00:30:57,549
Yeah.

599
00:30:57,953 --> 00:30:59,019
You're welcome.

600
00:31:01,753 --> 00:31:03,834
Lynette, can I... can I talk
to you upstairs for a minute?

601
00:31:03,942 --> 00:31:04,475
Okay.

602
00:31:08,794 --> 00:31:09,925
I'll be right up.

603
00:31:10,033 --> 00:31:10,759
Oh. Okay.

604
00:31:18,674 --> 00:31:19,207
So...

605
00:31:20,137 --> 00:31:21,836
Great news about Jen, huh?

606
00:31:22,017 --> 00:31:22,550
Yeah.

607
00:31:23,491 --> 00:31:24,709
I just fired her.

608
00:31:25,504 --> 00:31:27,753
What? You had no right to do that.

609
00:31:28,518 --> 00:31:29,329
And you had no right

610
00:31:29,437 --> 00:31:30,948
to make my mother feel

611
00:31:31,078 --> 00:31:32,578
unwelcomed in my house.

612
00:31:32,899 --> 00:31:34,692
She just wanted to be
a part of this family.

613
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,681
Tom, I love your mother,
and if this were 1955,

614
00:31:37,789 --> 00:31:40,119
I would be so on board with
her parenting techniques,

615
00:31:40,227 --> 00:31:42,026
but I will not let her raise our

616
00:31:42,027 --> 00:31:43,600
children to turn out like...

617
00:31:43,708 --> 00:31:46,755
Whoa, whoa. Finish that sentence.
T-turn out like me?

618
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,971
No. No, I didn't say that! I...

619
00:31:49,668 --> 00:31:52,597
but we... let's be honest.
When we first met,

620
00:31:53,118 --> 00:31:55,090
you thought there were
only two roles for women...

621
00:31:55,198 --> 00:31:57,538
making a cake or
jumping out of one.

622
00:31:57,646 --> 00:31:59,817
I'm sorry. I just
don't want her here.

623
00:31:59,818 --> 00:32:01,097
For our entire marriage,

624
00:32:01,205 --> 00:32:02,204
you have been the one
to make the decisions.

625
00:32:02,312 --> 00:32:03,614
"I'm going back to work."

626
00:32:03,615 --> 00:32:04,708
"I'm hiring a nanny."

627
00:32:04,816 --> 00:32:07,781
This time, I am making
the decision. She stays.

628
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:13,931
Okay, boys and girls, gather up

629
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,554
your supplies and put them away.

630
00:32:15,662 --> 00:32:16,522
See you tomorrow.

631
00:32:21,051 --> 00:32:22,822
Maxine, I can't talk now.
I'm at work.

632
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:24,640
Look, I know I fired you,

633
00:32:25,287 --> 00:32:26,426
but if you like,

634
00:32:26,534 --> 00:32:29,365
I'm willing to offer you,
uh, another chance.

635
00:32:29,764 --> 00:32:30,297
Why?

636
00:32:30,841 --> 00:32:32,127
Well, this guy keeps calling.

637
00:32:32,235 --> 00:32:34,804
He really wants a private
session with you,

638
00:32:34,912 --> 00:32:37,830
and he's starting to
offer some serious money.

639
00:32:38,073 --> 00:32:39,783
Come on. What do you say?

640
00:32:41,896 --> 00:32:43,393
How serious are we talking?

641
00:32:46,887 --> 00:32:48,138
Thank you so much for coming.

642
00:32:48,246 --> 00:32:49,933
I cannot tell you
what it means to me.

643
00:32:50,124 --> 00:32:52,098
Yeah, yeah. Are you gonna
be singing any songs

644
00:32:52,206 --> 00:32:54,204
about a woman who's a
backstabbing bitch?

645
00:32:54,882 --> 00:32:56,947
We are really looking
forward to it, Emma.

646
00:32:57,055 --> 00:32:58,262
Good luck. Thanks.

647
00:32:59,813 --> 00:33:01,615
Would you get over it already?

648
00:33:01,723 --> 00:33:03,666
Why don't we go sit down
with our friends? No!

649
00:33:04,046 --> 00:33:07,327
I'm sick of Lynette making
those Cyrano de Bergerac jokes,

650
00:33:07,435 --> 00:33:08,548
whoever she was.

651
00:33:08,707 --> 00:33:11,332
He. And, baby,
they are just teasing you.

652
00:33:11,712 --> 00:33:14,839
Well, it's not funny.
My thing was my natural beauty.

653
00:33:15,127 --> 00:33:17,815
Like Susan's an artist.
Lynette's a great businesswoman.

654
00:33:17,923 --> 00:33:19,472
Bree's the perfect homemaker.

655
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,949
I was the beautiful one.

656
00:33:21,328 --> 00:33:23,121
Now I'm just the plastic one.

657
00:33:27,262 --> 00:33:29,757
And there's the woman
who's to blame.

658
00:33:30,062 --> 00:33:33,396
Man, I'd love to smack that
smile right off her face...

659
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,663
which, by the way,
has been pulled so tight,

660
00:33:34,771 --> 00:33:36,305
it would probably smack me back.

661
00:33:38,067 --> 00:33:41,423
I forgot what it was like
walking into a room on your arm.

662
00:33:41,531 --> 00:33:42,313
I like it.

663
00:33:42,421 --> 00:33:45,081
Baby, I think you are the
one they were staring at.

664
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:47,040
Ah. Well, this doesn't hurt.

665
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:51,010
Mmm. Mwah.

666
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:53,783
Hey, Gaby.

667
00:33:54,916 --> 00:33:56,682
I didn't nose you'd be here.

668
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:01,021
Okay, I don't know what you heard,
but it's all crap.

669
00:34:01,129 --> 00:34:01,960
Don't lie.

670
00:34:02,298 --> 00:34:03,861
That'll make it grow again.

671
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:11,926
Tell Doug Perry it's on the house.

672
00:34:14,226 --> 00:34:15,139
I'll do it.

673
00:34:25,921 --> 00:34:27,152
It's on the house.

674
00:34:27,489 --> 00:34:29,899
Oh, by the way,
she slept with your lawyer.

675
00:34:30,264 --> 00:34:31,330
Enjoy the show.

676
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:39,281
Is that true?

677
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:40,319
Well...

678
00:34:41,437 --> 00:34:43,136
The thing about that is...

679
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:45,401
Ladies and gentlemen,

680
00:34:45,509 --> 00:34:48,076
the smokehouse lounge
is proud to present

681
00:34:48,548 --> 00:34:49,415
Emma Graham.

682
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:53,443
Whoo, Emma!

683
00:34:58,239 --> 00:34:59,164
A word. Aah!

684
00:34:59,872 --> 00:35:02,466
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Get the claws off the Versace!

685
00:35:02,574 --> 00:35:04,244
Why the hell would
you tell him that?

686
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,181
Well, you know me and my big nose...

687
00:35:06,289 --> 00:35:08,569
This is my marriage
we're talking about!

688
00:35:08,677 --> 00:35:11,357
This trumps your stupid nose! O.
They're both fake!

689
00:35:11,465 --> 00:35:12,126
Oh, what do you know?

690
00:35:12,234 --> 00:35:14,632
You're nothing but a boring
housewife... shut up!

691
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:17,905
Whose life is so pathetic,
you gotta crap all over mine!

692
00:35:18,013 --> 00:35:19,575
I'm pathetic?! Hey,
what do you call

693
00:35:19,683 --> 00:35:22,612
a girl who sleeps with
a guy for $8 million?!

694
00:35:30,759 --> 00:35:32,024
Get off! Uhh! Aah!

695
00:35:32,679 --> 00:35:34,031
I'm gonna kill you!

696
00:35:34,139 --> 00:35:35,943
You whore! Uhh! Get off me!

697
00:35:38,393 --> 00:35:39,741
Okay, ladies, please.

698
00:35:40,647 --> 00:35:41,180
Uhh!

699
00:35:41,894 --> 00:35:43,900
I will never forgive you for this!

700
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:46,260
Sure you will. I'll just
buy you a sapphire ring.

701
00:35:46,368 --> 00:35:47,832
Oh, you like my ring?

702
00:35:48,183 --> 00:35:49,867
Well, get ready to smell I

703
00:35:51,221 --> 00:35:52,638
oh, my God, my nose!

704
00:35:53,567 --> 00:35:54,785
My nose! My nose!

705
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:11,922
Didn't think I'd
hear from you again.

706
00:36:13,189 --> 00:36:15,593
Look, I've been thinking about
everything that's happened.

707
00:36:15,701 --> 00:36:18,514
You slept with someone.
I slept with someone.

708
00:36:19,933 --> 00:36:21,706
Maybe we should just call it even.

709
00:36:23,316 --> 00:36:23,890
Really?

710
00:36:24,133 --> 00:36:24,666
Yeah.

711
00:36:25,197 --> 00:36:27,833
I mean, that's what
we both want, right?

712
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:50,620
Thank you, dear.

713
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:57,649
I am so sorry for saying those

714
00:36:57,861 --> 00:36:59,502
things about your husband.

715
00:37:00,429 --> 00:37:01,636
I appreciate that.

716
00:37:02,083 --> 00:37:05,211
And I'm sorry if I...
Crossed some sort of line.

717
00:37:06,149 --> 00:37:06,682
No.

718
00:37:06,921 --> 00:37:09,651
It just felt so nice
to feel useful again.

719
00:37:10,646 --> 00:37:13,423
You are useful,
and I really need you here,

720
00:37:13,872 --> 00:37:16,063
especially when I go back to work.

721
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,266
You know,

722
00:37:20,081 --> 00:37:22,952
the kitchen is my favorite
room in the house.

723
00:37:23,391 --> 00:37:25,278
The family sits together here.

724
00:37:26,157 --> 00:37:28,768
You get to cook for them
and make them happy.

725
00:37:28,876 --> 00:37:30,653
And I just don't understand

726
00:37:30,761 --> 00:37:32,811
why you would ever want to give

727
00:37:32,889 --> 00:37:34,798
all that up to go out there.

728
00:37:41,672 --> 00:37:43,100
It's just who I am.

729
00:37:48,764 --> 00:37:50,322
Mom? The baby's crying.

730
00:37:51,527 --> 00:37:53,566
Oh. Well, she's probably hungry.

731
00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:01,798
Ooh. Yummy.

732
00:38:05,635 --> 00:38:08,130
I'm so sorry.
What's your name again?

733
00:38:08,992 --> 00:38:09,823
I'm penny.

734
00:38:11,996 --> 00:38:13,460
And do you live here?

735
00:38:26,311 --> 00:38:28,690
I'm not really used
to apologizing...

736
00:38:29,845 --> 00:38:31,431
But here are some chocolates.

737
00:38:31,572 --> 00:38:34,841
I haven't touched a carb since 1985,
but thank you.

738
00:38:35,682 --> 00:38:36,515
Believe it or not,

739
00:38:36,612 --> 00:38:39,234
I was actually on my way
over to apologize to you.

740
00:38:41,435 --> 00:38:43,259
I don't know what came over me.

741
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:47,705
Look, I still feel you
deserve better than that guy.

742
00:38:48,193 --> 00:38:49,785
But I had no right to screw with

743
00:38:49,786 --> 00:38:51,278
your marriage. It's your life.

744
00:38:51,386 --> 00:38:52,804
Doug called this morning.

745
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:55,078
He said he still wants me back...

746
00:38:55,346 --> 00:38:55,879
Oh.

747
00:38:56,859 --> 00:38:57,392
Wow.

748
00:38:58,613 --> 00:38:59,690
And I said no.

749
00:39:01,248 --> 00:39:01,963
Seriously?

750
00:39:02,904 --> 00:39:05,386
He said we could pretend
it never happened,

751
00:39:05,494 --> 00:39:06,737
and I thought of all the things

752
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:09,374
I pretended never
happened over the years.

753
00:39:10,109 --> 00:39:13,132
You were right, Gaby.
I needed to open my eyes.

754
00:39:15,265 --> 00:39:16,869
Okay, well, before I
take credit for this,

755
00:39:16,977 --> 00:39:19,244
are you sure this
is what you want?

756
00:39:19,436 --> 00:39:19,969
Yes.

757
00:39:20,938 --> 00:39:23,113
And thank you.
Out of all the women,

758
00:39:23,221 --> 00:39:24,750
you were the only one who had

759
00:39:24,751 --> 00:39:26,332
the guts to tell me the truth.

760
00:39:26,888 --> 00:39:28,248
You're a real friend,

761
00:39:28,356 --> 00:39:31,484
and I'll take that over
a sapphire ring any day.

762
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:32,692
Oh!

763
00:39:34,689 --> 00:39:36,808
You're keeping the ring,
right? Oh, hell, yeah.

764
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:01,343
Hello?

765
00:40:03,616 --> 00:40:04,729
Is anyone there?

766
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:13,268
Are you shy, too?

767
00:40:14,136 --> 00:40:15,998
Well, that's okay. So am I.

768
00:40:18,147 --> 00:40:20,062
Why don't you start with just, uh,

769
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:21,576
telling me your name?

770
00:40:23,467 --> 00:40:25,010
I think you know my name.

771
00:40:25,118 --> 00:40:25,996
Oh! Oh! Oh!

772
00:40:30,787 --> 00:40:32,019
I'm still here, Susan.

773
00:40:34,041 --> 00:40:34,919
Oh. Oh. Oh.

774
00:40:48,928 --> 00:40:50,917
I'm glad you put your robe on.

775
00:40:51,025 --> 00:40:53,357
I hate to see you
debasing yourself.

776
00:40:55,832 --> 00:40:56,989
What do you want?

777
00:40:57,826 --> 00:40:59,243
I'd like your house,

778
00:40:59,353 --> 00:41:02,310
and I'm willing to pay a
very fair price for it.

779
00:41:02,773 --> 00:41:04,523
Yeah, Mike told me about that.

780
00:41:05,601 --> 00:41:06,924
It's not for sale.

781
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:10,811
Susan, it seems to me a lot
of things are for sale...

782
00:41:11,439 --> 00:41:12,892
your body, your honor,

783
00:41:14,356 --> 00:41:15,411
your reputation.

784
00:41:16,419 --> 00:41:17,943
The house would seem to be

785
00:41:17,944 --> 00:41:19,642
the smallest of those things.

786
00:41:20,281 --> 00:41:21,781
Are you threatening me?

787
00:41:22,582 --> 00:41:25,464
I'm simply saying it would
be terribly unfortunate

788
00:41:25,572 --> 00:41:28,595
if anyone were to find
out what I already know.

789
00:41:28,762 --> 00:41:30,367
I mean... I was shocked.

790
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:32,475
I can only imagine

791
00:41:32,583 --> 00:41:34,660
what your husband
and son would think.

792
00:41:35,654 --> 00:41:37,024
You son of a bitch.

793
00:41:38,437 --> 00:41:40,556
It's a lot to take in, I know.

794
00:41:41,713 --> 00:41:44,431
Why don't you take a couple
of days to think about it?

795
00:41:44,539 --> 00:41:46,080
I'd hate for you to feel

796
00:41:46,081 --> 00:41:47,921
that I was... pressuring you.

797
00:41:55,351 --> 00:41:57,741
He knew what he was
doing was wrong.

798
00:41:59,471 --> 00:42:01,416
He knew it was very dangerous.

799
00:42:03,582 --> 00:42:06,066
He knew the risks
if people found out.

800
00:42:07,338 --> 00:42:09,330
But Paul young wanted to punish

801
00:42:09,914 --> 00:42:11,660
those who had betrayed him.

802
00:42:12,308 --> 00:42:14,170
So he had a plan that would

803
00:42:14,482 --> 00:42:16,264
set neighbor against neighbor

804
00:42:16,922 --> 00:42:18,563
and friend against friend.

805
00:42:20,165 --> 00:42:21,734
And it was a plan that

806
00:42:22,508 --> 00:42:23,914
was going to succeed.
