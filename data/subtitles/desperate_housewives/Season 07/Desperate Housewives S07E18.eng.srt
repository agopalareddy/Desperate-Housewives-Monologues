2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,319
I need a C.F.O.
I'm prepared to give you

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,170
stock options,
access to the company jet.

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,319
Tom got a job offer
he couldn't refuse.

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,840
- I am in.
- Yes!

6
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,570
At dialysis, Susan made a friend.

7
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:18,890
Beth took her life,

8
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:21,439
which led to Susan
getting a kidney...

9
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,280
Honor Beth's life by allowing you
to make her well.

10
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:26,979
And Felicia being freed.

11
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,899
I just heard
from the parole board.

12
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,689
They've decided
to grant your request

13
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,270
for humanitarian release.

14
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:34,240
Alex left me.

15
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:35,549
Oh, honey.

16
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,440
I guess he just got sick
of living with a drunk.

17
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,790
And Bree helped her son
face his addiction.

18
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,989
When Bree Van De Kamp

19
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:56,559
decided to stop drinking,
her recipe for sobriety

20
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,010
was the 12 steps
of alcoholics anonymous.

21
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,490
She admitted she was
powerless over alcohol...

22
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,870
She asked God to remove
her shortcomings.

23
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,240
She made a list of all the people
she had harmed.

24
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:21,340
So when her son Andrew
decided to stop drinking,

25
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,839
Bree was pleased to see him
follow those steps

26
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,109
as successfully as she had.

27
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:28,620
Let me see it again.

28
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,689
Ahh. 30 days sober.
I am so proud of you.

29
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,489
I feel great, mom.

30
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:39,999
And it gets better all the time.

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,620
Just keep going to meetings
and working those steps.

32
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:46,619
Yeah, I kind of stalled out
around number eight, though.

33
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,880
Ooh, that is a tough one.

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,869
No one likes to make lists
of people they've done harm to,

35
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,059
particularly with
your penmanship.

36
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,859
No, I wrote the list.

37
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,049
But now I have
to make the amends,

38
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:01,770
and there's one person
I've been really awful to.

39
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:09,001
Well, I know it seems difficult,
but give it a chance.

40
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,630
Some people are more forgiving
than we give them credit for.

41
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,239
- You thought I meant you?
- Well, of course I did.

42
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,379
Aw, mom.

43
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,939
Uh, no offense,
but you're way down the list.

44
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,789
I think you're, like, seventh.

45
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:30,180
Seventh?

46
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,960
I'd like to know about
these six people ahead of me.

47
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,209
Did you steal their pocketbook?

48
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,629
Did you wreck their car?

49
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:40,859
Stick a kitchen knife through
an oil portrait of them?

50
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,659
- Okay, calm down.
- I will not calm down.

51
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,840
I resent you thinking you've
harmed anyone more than me.

52
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,560
Well, I have.

53
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,870
And if I'm gonna make amends,
I need to start now...

54
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,960
with the top of the list.

55
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:58,990
And who might that be?
Who is this victim number one?

56
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,300
Mr. Solis.

57
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:06,693
Yes, Bree was diligent
about following the 12 steps.

58
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:10,120
After all, I did sort of kill his mom.

59
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,119
But even she could
recognize a step too far.

60
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,430
Andrew, stop!

62
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,729
We teach our children

63
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:32,760
to apologize when
they make a mistake.

64
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,910
We tell them that it's wrong
to blame others...

65
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,890
or pretend it never happened...

66
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:49,190
or try to cover it up.

67
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,570
But there are those times
when apologizing...

68
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,439
Hey, Carlos! You got a minute?

69
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,339
- Is the biggest mistake of all.
- Be right there.

70
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,309
Andrew, stop. You really
need to think about this.

71
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,949
Mom, you know
what the step says...

72
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:06,289
Make direct amends
to those we have harmed.

73
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,529
Unless to do so would
injure them or others.

74
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,169
And if Carlos finds out,
trust me,

75
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,100
he's going to injure others!

76
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:14,539
Hey, buddy. What's up?

77
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,349
You know, there's something
I never told you...

78
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:20,209
Uh, yes. How wonderful
you were to him after Rex died.

79
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:22,989
You were like a...
surrogate father.

80
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,579
Oh, I don't know about that.

81
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,639
You were.
You took him on hunting trips,

82
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,729
football games, car races...

83
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,089
I didn't know you were gay then,

84
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:32,999
- or I'd have thrown in a few musicals.
- Ha ha ha ha!

85
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,919
The point is, you've always
been so kind to people,

86
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,860
never inuring them... or others.

87
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,509
Well, that was the same year
that my mom died,

88
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,530
so I was working
through some grief, too.

89
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,660
It was great that we could
be there for each other.

90
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,790
So... that was what
you wanted to tell me?

91
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:57,439
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, just, uh... thanks.

92
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,470
No problem.

93
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:04,320
Someone just earned another pie.

94
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,700
Hey!

95
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,149
Whoever's in here,
I own this house,

96
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:23,020
and I want you out now!

97
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,390
Well, hello, Paul.

98
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:35,960
What the hell
are you doing here?

99
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,979
I'm just nosing around

100
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,570
to see what I'll need
to buy before I move in.

101
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,479
Not much, apparently.

102
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,229
I had no idea
the place came furnished.

103
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:47,569
Have you lost
what's left of your mind?

104
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:49,409
This is my house!
Now get out!

105
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:51,569
Oh, I know you bought it.

106
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:54,069
You bought a lot of houses
on this street,

107
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,999
but you didn't want
people to know,

108
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,619
so you put this one
in Beth's name.

109
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,979
So what?
I was her husband!

110
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,889
And since she never made a will...

111
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:06,479
Oh, but she did, Paul, years ago.

112
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,040
And according to that will,

113
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,050
I own this house
and everything in it.

114
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:17,919
Oh, my goodness!
Is this a Gustav Stickley?

115
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,609
Do you really think
the people on this street

116
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,909
want a manipulative
psycho for a neighbor?

117
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,299
Well, they let you live here,

118
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,180
so I'm guessing the zoning laws
aren't all that strict.

119
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,550
If they wanna shun me, let them.

120
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,660
I won't be alone.

121
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,800
I'll have my daughter with me.

122
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:40,209
My God. You stole her ashes?

123
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:44,259
I did not steal them. You are
so quick to think the worst of me.

124
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:49,250
I just went to the mausoleum
and I explained my legal rights.

125
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,940
Your rights?

126
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,180
What about my rights?
She was my wife!

127
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,119
Did I say you couldn't visit her?

128
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,219
Drop by anytime, Paul.

129
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,610
My door is always open.

130
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,059
Everything looks great, Susan...

131
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,180
Your blood work,
creatine levels.

132
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:20,720
You're, like, the poster girl
for kidney transplants.

133
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,279
Does that mean I can have
salty food and sex again?

134
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,959
Salt in moderation.
You should wait two more weeks

135
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,009
before resuming
normal sexual activity.

136
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:30,439
Mike and I have already
waited a month.

137
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,359
There's not going to be
anything normal about it.

138
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,200
Okay, well, I'll see you
at your next checkup.

139
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:37,539
Where are you off to?

140
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,969
Well, I am definitely
going to the mall

141
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:43,039
to enjoy the last few hours
of my handicap placard.

142
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,989
First I'm going
to the dialysis center

143
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,039
to visit my friend Dick Barrows.

144
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,349
Oh, you don't have to go
to the dialysis center.

145
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:52,550
He's here in the hospital.
He was admitted yesterday.

146
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,399
Hey, tall, dark, and jaundiced.

147
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,100
Delfino.

148
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,950
Come closer.

149
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:10,540
I wanna see if you still have
that new kidney smell.

150
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,780
What are you doing here?

151
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,969
Where else can you get
a large Jamaican nurse

152
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,790
to give you a sponge bath
for 4 grand a day?

153
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,659
Another viral infection.

154
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,920
I'm sorry.

155
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:28,040
I can't believe you got
a kidney so fast.

156
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,809
I don't suppose you have
any more suicidal neighbors

157
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,239
with donor cards?

158
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,759
I didn't laugh when you wrote it
on my get-well note,

159
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,220
and I'm not laughing now.

160
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:42,259
I'm telling you, you are
the luckiest person alive.

161
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,260
You should take advantage.

162
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,210
Do you gamble?

163
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,719
A little.

164
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,169
Ah. Oh-ho, great.
When I get outta here,

165
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,389
I'm taking you
to that casino by the airport.

166
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:57,029
I've never won in that place.
You could be my rabbit's foot.

167
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,799
I'm not big on casinos.

168
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,959
I'm more of an
around-the-kitchen-table,

169
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,170
gossip-with-my-girlfriends,
win-all-the-M&M's kind of gal.

170
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:10,990
Ah, it's time for my spinal tap.

171
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:14,580
You see?
You're not the only lucky one.

172
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:21,360
Hey, babe.
You're home late.

173
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:24,300
I got called down
to the legal department.

174
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,530
Is everything okay?

175
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:31,079
There's no easy way to say this.

176
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,960
Oh, no. What is this?

177
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,770
That, my dear...

178
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,890
is my signing bonus.

179
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,829
$100,000.

180
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:48,059
No way. It is not $100,000.

181
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,220
"One..."

182
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:52,929
It is. It's $100,000!

183
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:54,569
I can't believe it!

184
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,829
I know!
What are we gonna do with it?

185
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,689
Um, how about this...

186
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:00,529
go to the bank,
get 100,000 singles,

187
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:03,129
and roll around naked on them,
and then apologize

188
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:04,749
to everybody at the bank
and come home!

189
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,479
- I like the naked part.
- Oh, my gosh!

190
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,189
Oh, my gosh!

191
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:12,270
Okay. Okay, let's think. Um...

192
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:15,849
Obviously, we should put some
in the kids' college fund,

193
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:18,600
and then top off
our retirement account...

194
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,399
Or actually start
a retirement account.

195
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,059
Definitely.
We should do all of that...

196
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,919
with 90 grand.

197
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,229
The other 10
is for you to spend

198
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,719
on something fun
and totally frivolous,

199
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,639
like a mink vest
or a diamond frisbee.

200
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,959
No, no, no...

201
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,489
No. Lynette, do you know
how long I have waited

202
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:39,270
to be able to say this to you?

203
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,840
Go crazy.

204
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:43,990
It's on me.

205
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,649
Fine.

206
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,179
If you're gonna be
a jerk about it,

207
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,599
I'll spend $10,000 on myself.

208
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,690
Aah!

209
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:53,959
We should celebrate!

210
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,589
Mm. Let's go out to dinner. Mwah.

211
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:59,429
Oh, definitely. But not tonight.
I've got a ton of work.

212
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:02,300
- Okay? How about Friday?
- Okay. It's a date.

213
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,790
Wait a sec.

214
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,500
"One..."

215
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,700
Nope. That's $100,000.

216
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,600
And I'll call.

217
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,859
9, 10, Jack, queen, king...
a straight.

218
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,070
Eat it!

219
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:26,849
I was going to say how nice it is
to have you back in our game,

220
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,399
until you so charmingly
told us to "eat it."

221
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,919
- For the third time.
- I'm sorry.

222
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,100
I've just never been
this hot before.

223
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,829
My friend called it today.
He said I was on a lucky streak.

224
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,869
Well, you are lucky.
You got a kidney transplant.

225
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,929
And if you take any more
of my money,

226
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,840
you're gonna need
a face transplant.

227
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:49,710
Okay, is anyone going to notice
what's different around here?

228
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:51,799
You cut your hair?

229
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,890
- No.
- Well, you should.

230
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,480
I mean the coffee.

231
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,729
Tom gave me part
of his signing bonus

232
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,830
and said, "Go crazy," so...

233
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:04,739
I bought a grind and brew
coffee master.

234
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,580
Wasn't even on sale.
Check me out.

235
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,159
Shall I say it?

236
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,180
No, please, allow me.
You're pathetic.

237
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,569
You finally get
a little mad money

238
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:17,709
and you buy
a kitchen appliance?

239
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,359
But I don't really need anything.

240
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,419
Oh, honey, look around.
You need everything. Two.

241
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,329
Well, it's hard for me.
Tom's only had this job a month.

242
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,789
I'm used to clipping coupons
and buying in bulk.

243
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:31,379
- I even color my own hair.
- Ah. Mystery solved.

244
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,370
Hey.

245
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,469
How did you let this happen?

246
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:37,289
Don't look at me like that.
I tried. I tried for years.

247
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,140
I couldn't even get her
out of flip-flops.

248
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,119
Oh, maybe I can
take a shot at her.

249
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,880
Don't do it.
She'll break your heart.

250
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:46,729
Well, I'm bored.
Look, after this game,

251
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:49,199
I am taking you
to a clothing store...

252
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,650
That doesn't also sell
patio furniture and meat.

253
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:54,510
I'm out.

254
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,890
I'll bet $20.

255
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,800
I'm all in.

256
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,359
You didn't even look
at your cards.

257
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,660
I don't need to.

258
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,410
So what do you say,
Van De Kamp?

259
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,680
Did you come to play?

260
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,630
Huh. Let's see
what you are made of.

261
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:24,790
Three kings.

262
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,709
Oh, look at me!
I should buy a lottery ticket right now.

263
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:31,600
Yes, you should,
and then you should "eat it."

264
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,280
I so don't belong here.

265
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:45,009
That saleslady knows it, too.

266
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:46,929
Did you see the look
she just gave me? Come on.

267
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:49,360
- What?
- Wait.

268
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,400
Um, excuse me.

269
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,389
We'd like two prosciutto panninis

270
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:59,670
and a couple of iced cappuccinos.

271
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,160
There's a café across the street.

272
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,089
Oh, please don't make me go
to the enormous hassle

273
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:09,920
of buying this place
just to fire you.

274
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,480
Nice.

275
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:22,059
Now let's get started.

276
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:25,910
Oh, you have got to try these on.

277
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:28,060
Nah. I don't...
I don't need boots.

278
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,490
You will once you try them.

279
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:35,930
Ahh.

280
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:40,279
It's like the boot
is French kissing my foot.

281
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,920
Walk around in them.

282
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,540
Oh, dear.

283
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,320
What they are doing
to my feet now...

284
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,320
I can't even say.

285
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,060
Oh.

286
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:59,080
Now... try these.

287
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,679
$500 for jeans?

288
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,560
I wouldn't pay that if they
had $400 in the pocket.

289
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,070
Try them.

290
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,060
Look at my ass!

291
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:11,079
Where did that ass come from?

292
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,419
- It came with the jeans.
- Ohh!

293
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,010
- You like it?
- Ohh!

294
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:18,120
You should see the ass
that comes with the $900 pair.

295
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:27,559
Do I even wanna know
how much that is?

296
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,650
You just want to put it on.

297
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,419
Thank you for shopping
with us, Mrs. Scavo.

298
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,949
Uh, that dress should be
altered by tomorrow.

299
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,240
We open at 10:00.

300
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:40,209
Let's make it 8:00.

301
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:42,130
And... bring croissants.

302
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,120
Hey, Bree!

303
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,379
I hope Andrew
brought his rain gear.

304
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,069
- I hear it's gonna pour up there.
- Up where?

305
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:55,280
- The cabin.
- What are you talking about?

306
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,769
Didn't Andrew tell you?

307
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:59,859
- He came by this morning
to talk to Carlos. - He did?

308
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,669
Yeah, Carlos was just leaving
for a hunting trip

309
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:04,979
and invited Andrew to come along
for old times' sake.

310
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,910
Andrew is with Carlos
in the woods with guns?

311
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,739
- I have to call him.
- Why? Is something wrong?

312
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,170
Oh, yes, something's wrong.

313
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:15,349
- Has Andrew lost his mind?
- I tried to talk him out of it,

314
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,549
but he's taking this
A.A. thing seriously.

315
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,919
Okay, see, this is the problem
with sobriety... it ruins lives.

316
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,709
Damn it. I still can't get through.

317
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:26,089
- There's no reception up there.
- I'm starting to get scared.

318
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:27,329
Oh you're scared?

319
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,859
I'm gonna be the one
raising two kids

320
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,479
with a husband in jail for murder!

321
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,419
And Andrew's gay, so it's a hate crime.
That's ten more years!

322
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,259
Let's not panic. It may not be
too late to stop this.

323
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,940
You're right.
We have to get up there.

324
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,549
I'm gonna see if Lee
can watch the girls.

325
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,540
And I have to get something
out of my nightstand.

326
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,450
Bree, aren't there gonna be
enough guns up there?

327
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:49,550
When one of them is in my hands,
then there'll be enough guns.

328
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:01,509
I just want to say I'm sorry
for the way I behaved yesterday.

329
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,670
You're sorry?

330
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:05,190
I'll give you two reasons
I don't believe you.

331
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,889
I knew you'd be upset to find
you'd bought me a house.

332
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:14,310
But I still had to twist the knife.
I guess old habits die hard.

333
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,989
You think that's what upset me...
the house?

334
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:19,949
And Beth's ashes, of course,

335
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:22,360
but I wanna make that up to you.

336
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,850
You're giving them back?

337
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:27,769
No. I don't think
either of us should keep them.

338
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:30,610
I think we should scatter them,
together.

339
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:34,079
So you've picked up on the fact

340
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,030
that I long to spend
more time with you.

341
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:40,539
There's a pretty little lake
about an hour north of here.

342
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,820
When Beth was a girl,
it was her favorite place.

343
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,390
I think she'd be happy there.

344
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,519
You could just do this on your own.

345
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,880
Why do you want me there?

346
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,190
Because Beth loved you.

347
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,650
It's what I think she'd want.

348
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,200
And I don't have a car yet.

349
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,590
Shall we say tomorrow
around 10:00?

350
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,410
10:00 will be fine.

351
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,470
Shall I make us some sandwiches?

352
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,059
If it's all the same to you, Felicia,

353
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,440
I'll bring my own.

354
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,610
Dick, are you awake?

355
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,989
Oh, good.

356
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,659
You were right
about the lucky streak.

357
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,190
Guess who won at poker?

358
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,959
Are you looking for my Uncle Dick?

359
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,750
Uh, yeah. Did he go home?

360
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,300
No, um...

361
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,150
I'm afraid we lost him last night.

362
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,000
What?

363
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,930
Oh, my God.

364
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,390
Yeah. He never let on
how sick he was.

365
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,699
I'm Wally, by the way.

366
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,620
- Susan.
- Susan Delfino?

367
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,060
Uh, he left somethin' for you.

368
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,500
.

369
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,650
He was always bugging me
to go out to that casino with him.

370
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,740
Now I wish I'd gone.

371
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,929
Bree, Gaby,
what are you doing here?

372
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,840
He's not here.
Where's Andrew?

373
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,179
He's hiking over by the cliffs.

374
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,689
- In the rain?
- Well, it wasn't raining when he left.

375
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:31,049
Why'd you two come
all the way out here?

376
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,259
We were worried about Andrew.

377
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,469
Because he... forgot his medicine.

378
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,610
So when is he gonna be back
from his hike?

379
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:40,230
Soon, I hope. Those rocks get
awful slippery when they're wet.

380
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,260
Oh, my God! Is that blood?

381
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,989
Yeah, I cut myself chopping wood.

382
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,230
What's that?

383
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:49,569
A shovel?

384
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:51,979
With fresh dirt on it!
Why is there fresh dirt?

385
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,110
Damn it, Carlos.
What did you do to Andrew?

386
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:56,529
- What are you talking about?
- Don't pretend!

387
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,971
- We know he came clean
about your mother! - My mother?

388
00:19:59,092 --> 00:20:01,607
It was an accident!
He didn't mean to run her over!

389
00:20:01,608 --> 00:20:02,413
You should blame me!

390
00:20:02,414 --> 00:20:04,519
I'm the one who helped him
get rid of the car!

391
00:20:06,216 --> 00:20:07,179
Mom?

392
00:20:09,933 --> 00:20:11,016
Andrew!

393
00:20:11,017 --> 00:20:13,003
Oh, thank God you're all right.

394
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:15,491
- What's going on?
- You killed my mother?

395
00:20:15,526 --> 00:20:17,627
What? No. No, who said that?

396
00:20:17,943 --> 00:20:19,392
We thought you told him.

397
00:20:19,393 --> 00:20:22,107
In the woods alone?
What am I, crazy?

398
00:20:22,108 --> 00:20:23,971
Well, you weren't here,
and we saw blood...

399
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:25,172
And the shovel with fresh dirt!

400
00:20:25,173 --> 00:20:27,974
- Explain that!
- Do you see a bathroom in here?

401
00:20:27,975 --> 00:20:31,237
- You son of a bitch. Carlos!
- I'm warning you. I have a gun...

402
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,007
In the car.

403
00:20:33,977 --> 00:20:35,421
Park ranger!

404
00:20:39,003 --> 00:20:41,065
Come in, please!

405
00:20:42,939 --> 00:20:43,735
Hey.

406
00:20:44,962 --> 00:20:46,876
Sorry you people picked
such a lousy weekend

407
00:20:46,877 --> 00:20:49,724
- to enjoy our park here.
- Actually, we were just leaving.

408
00:20:49,933 --> 00:20:52,237
Oh, 'fraid not.
Just got a radio call.

409
00:20:52,402 --> 00:20:55,292
Big old pine tree just fell
across the access road.

410
00:20:55,293 --> 00:20:56,916
We can't clear it up till tomorrow.

411
00:20:56,917 --> 00:20:58,986
So you're gonna have
to sit tight till then.

412
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,725
You mean we have
to stay here all night?

413
00:21:03,726 --> 00:21:04,389
Yep!

414
00:21:04,868 --> 00:21:06,769
I got a deck of cards in my truck

415
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:07,892
in case you get bored.

416
00:21:09,031 --> 00:21:10,754
Oh, I wouldn't worry about that.

417
00:21:20,094 --> 00:21:24,361
Ahh.

418
00:21:24,633 --> 00:21:26,394
Here. In case you're planning

419
00:21:26,395 --> 00:21:28,701
to put your champagne
in a paint bucket.

420
00:21:29,347 --> 00:21:30,611
I think I'm good.

421
00:21:32,231 --> 00:21:34,278
Wow.

422
00:21:35,517 --> 00:21:40,131
The sad caterpillar has turned
into an extravagant butterfly.

423
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:44,641
I am checking Tom's E.T.A.
so I know when to preheat the oven,

424
00:21:44,642 --> 00:21:46,979
and I'm not talking about... cooking.

425
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:47,669
- I'm talking about...
- Uh,

426
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,701
I know what you're talking about.
Please stop.

427
00:21:49,702 --> 00:21:52,225
Hey, Mr. C.F.O.,
the kids are gone,

428
00:21:52,226 --> 00:21:54,621
the champagne is on ice,

429
00:21:54,622 --> 00:21:58,300
and my bra actually
matches my panties.

430
00:21:58,578 --> 00:22:01,967
I was just gonna call you.
I'm on my way to the airport.

431
00:22:01,968 --> 00:22:04,310
I've got to get to Montreal
tonight on the jet.

432
00:22:04,311 --> 00:22:05,966
What? No.

433
00:22:06,176 --> 00:22:07,802
No, this is our celebration night.

434
00:22:07,803 --> 00:22:09,854
Can't you reschedule?

435
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:11,342
I'm sorry. I can't.

436
00:22:11,343 --> 00:22:14,118
I'm a hero for landing this meeting.
I got to be there.

437
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:15,966
Fine. I'll take another rain check.

438
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:18,280
You're starting to owe me
a lot of rain, you know?

439
00:22:18,973 --> 00:22:20,743
I love you.
Travel safe.

440
00:22:23,455 --> 00:22:25,813
Hey. Get your mitts off that.

441
00:22:25,814 --> 00:22:27,737
We'll have it tomorrow
when he gets back.

442
00:22:28,198 --> 00:22:31,203
Oh, Lynette.
Tomorrow it'll be something else.

443
00:22:32,123 --> 00:22:33,308
Tom is a big shot now,

444
00:22:33,309 --> 00:22:36,086
and the bigger he gets,
the less you're gonna see of him.

445
00:22:37,807 --> 00:22:38,555
Hey...

446
00:22:38,962 --> 00:22:41,134
you want the clothes
and the jewelry

447
00:22:41,135 --> 00:22:42,731
and all the other perks.

448
00:22:43,471 --> 00:22:45,802
Well, this is what they really cost.

449
00:22:59,403 --> 00:23:01,393
You came to the funeral.

450
00:23:02,457 --> 00:23:03,369
What?

451
00:23:04,145 --> 00:23:05,430
My mother's funeral.

452
00:23:06,731 --> 00:23:08,096
You sat in the second row,
behind the family,

453
00:23:08,097 --> 00:23:09,130
consoled us all.

454
00:23:11,645 --> 00:23:12,861
What was that like?

455
00:23:13,991 --> 00:23:16,474
Kind of... funny?

456
00:23:16,475 --> 00:23:20,431
Of course not.
It was very awkward.

457
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:23,088
Awkward.
Gosh.

458
00:23:24,251 --> 00:23:27,254
So sorry her funeral
was so tough on you.

459
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,707
God, I'm so hungry.

460
00:23:31,933 --> 00:23:33,705
Can't believe you guys
didn't bring any food.

461
00:23:34,882 --> 00:23:36,855
Actually, I brought something.

462
00:23:40,181 --> 00:23:43,474
This is all the dinner I need.

463
00:23:43,475 --> 00:23:46,388
Oh, great. We've got tension
and firearms. Let's add alcohol.

464
00:23:46,389 --> 00:23:47,449
Carlos, please put that away.

465
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:49,285
Andrew's only been sober a month.

466
00:23:50,181 --> 00:23:51,300
I heard.

467
00:23:52,309 --> 00:23:54,468
A whole month without a drink.

468
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,053
You must be thirsty.

469
00:23:59,257 --> 00:24:01,168
Help yourself.

470
00:24:04,132 --> 00:24:06,307
No, thanks. I'm... I'm good.

471
00:24:07,407 --> 00:24:09,435
Okay, let me put it this way.

472
00:24:09,436 --> 00:24:12,574
To mama Solis. May she rest in peace.

473
00:24:14,137 --> 00:24:17,320
Are you gonna drink to my mom?
Or you gonna insult her memory?

474
00:24:21,647 --> 00:24:24,842
- I... I guess I'm gonna drink
to your mom. - Yeah.

475
00:24:24,843 --> 00:24:27,804
Carlos, stop it.
You have every right to be angry,

476
00:24:27,805 --> 00:24:29,643
but please, think of all the years
we've been friends.

477
00:24:29,644 --> 00:24:33,256
Friends?
You think that we're still friends?

478
00:24:35,238 --> 00:24:36,558
How long have I watched you

479
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,472
play miss high-and-mighty
to the whole damn street?

480
00:24:39,473 --> 00:24:42,124
And the whole time,
you were just covering your ass!

481
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:43,521
Hey. Get mad at me,

482
00:24:43,522 --> 00:24:45,614
not the people
who just knew about it.

483
00:24:46,389 --> 00:24:47,442
People?

484
00:24:49,482 --> 00:24:51,050
Who else knew about this?

485
00:24:51,482 --> 00:24:53,119
That's not important.

486
00:24:55,913 --> 00:24:57,559
Gaby, what was that?

487
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,537
Nothing. It was a moth.

488
00:25:03,143 --> 00:25:04,521
You knew.

489
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,569
Her I can understand,
but my own wife?

490
00:25:08,777 --> 00:25:12,368
Oh, for God sakes, Carlos,
let it go. This is ancient history.

491
00:25:12,369 --> 00:25:14,864
Not to me.
I mean, not a day went by

492
00:25:14,865 --> 00:25:17,730
that I didn't think I should have
found the guy that did it.

493
00:25:18,689 --> 00:25:20,127
Well, I didn't have to look far, did I?

494
00:25:21,114 --> 00:25:23,107
I was taking him to ball games,

495
00:25:23,276 --> 00:25:25,847
inviting his accomplice
to dinner parties,

496
00:25:26,466 --> 00:25:28,089
and my wife knew.

497
00:25:28,968 --> 00:25:30,715
You know what?
To hell with all of you.

498
00:25:30,716 --> 00:25:32,624
Wait. Carlos,
where are you going?

499
00:25:32,625 --> 00:25:35,822
Anywhere but here.
I don't trust myself

500
00:25:35,823 --> 00:25:38,196
to be in the same room
with you people.

501
00:25:45,591 --> 00:25:47,180
Carlos!

502
00:25:47,829 --> 00:25:49,447
Carlos!

503
00:25:52,345 --> 00:25:53,756
Carlos!

504
00:25:58,442 --> 00:25:59,645
Ladies and gentlemen...

505
00:25:59,646 --> 00:26:03,162
please discontinue use
of all electronic devices

506
00:26:03,163 --> 00:26:05,705
so we can begin our meal service.

507
00:26:05,706 --> 00:26:09,206
What are you doing here?
We are about to take off.

508
00:26:09,207 --> 00:26:09,950
Not anymore.

509
00:26:09,951 --> 00:26:12,470
I pushed your flight back...
half an hour.

510
00:26:12,471 --> 00:26:14,256
You... what? How?

511
00:26:14,257 --> 00:26:17,157
Well, let's just say your pilot's
back at the terminal,

512
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:20,512
having coffee with
a few dead presidents, so...

513
00:26:20,513 --> 00:26:22,814
now it's just you, me...

514
00:26:24,314 --> 00:26:26,930
oh, and two unfortunate lobsters.

515
00:26:28,983 --> 00:26:32,885
Hey, you know what
you can do on a private jet?

516
00:26:33,601 --> 00:26:35,288
Anything.

517
00:26:35,783 --> 00:26:39,743
Absolutely anything.

518
00:26:39,896 --> 00:26:42,232
I can't believe you did this.

519
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:43,771
I know. What a wife, huh?

520
00:26:43,772 --> 00:26:47,766
No, no, no. No, I mean
it's really gonna screw me up.

521
00:26:48,978 --> 00:26:51,653
I'm supposed to sit down
with my team the moment I land.

522
00:26:51,654 --> 00:26:54,164
I need every second
to prep for this meeting.

523
00:26:54,349 --> 00:26:57,746
I understand.
You have been working so hard.

524
00:26:57,747 --> 00:27:00,056
I just wanted you to have
half an hour of fun.

525
00:27:00,271 --> 00:27:02,570
Thank you,
but you need to realize...

526
00:27:03,812 --> 00:27:06,250
this is fun.

527
00:27:07,858 --> 00:27:10,593
Honey, I love this job.

528
00:27:11,264 --> 00:27:14,088
I have never felt
so valuable before.

529
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:18,422
I... I walk into a room,
and people stop talking.

530
00:27:18,423 --> 00:27:20,030
They want to know
what Tom thinks.

531
00:27:20,031 --> 00:27:23,348
I got to tell you,
this company is a rocket ship.

532
00:27:23,349 --> 00:27:25,611
It's taking me
on the ride of my life.

533
00:27:27,365 --> 00:27:28,637
Wow.

534
00:27:30,031 --> 00:27:31,947
That's...

535
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,064
I am really happy for you.

536
00:27:35,391 --> 00:27:39,022
And don't think I have forgotten
why I have this gig.

537
00:27:39,306 --> 00:27:40,948
You gave me the confidence
to jump at it,

538
00:27:40,949 --> 00:27:44,186
and I am so, so grateful.

539
00:27:44,187 --> 00:27:48,121
This is all 'cause of you.

540
00:27:49,299 --> 00:27:52,741
- Can... can... yeah.
- What? Oh.

541
00:27:55,551 --> 00:27:56,686
Back to fun?

542
00:27:57,111 --> 00:28:00,434
Uh, I should take this.
I'll... I'll call you when I land.

543
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:01,438
Okay.

544
00:28:01,439 --> 00:28:03,091
- You look great, by the way.
- Oh.

545
00:28:05,736 --> 00:28:08,631
Hey. I got a little hung up
on the ground, but I'm on my way.

546
00:28:08,632 --> 00:28:12,195
While I got you on the phone, um,

547
00:28:12,196 --> 00:28:15,869
who is gonna be in
on this conference call?

548
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:18,990
Yeah... no.
N... n... not Ted.

549
00:28:18,991 --> 00:28:20,584
I... I want to try to keep this...

550
00:28:27,381 --> 00:28:28,652
Susan.

551
00:28:28,653 --> 00:28:31,589
Roy.
I didn't know you came here.

552
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:32,640
Every Thursday,

553
00:28:32,641 --> 00:28:35,946
Karen sticks 50 bucks in my pocket,
pats me on the butt,

554
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:39,552
and tells me not to come home
till I blow it or double it.

555
00:28:39,553 --> 00:28:41,022
So slots?

556
00:28:41,838 --> 00:28:45,181
I can't speak for those two,
but I think Lottie gets around.

557
00:28:46,173 --> 00:28:47,972
No. Slots.

558
00:28:47,973 --> 00:28:51,085
Oh! Oh, yeah. Hey, sit down.

559
00:28:51,086 --> 00:28:54,425
Oh, thanks, but, uh,
I'm gonna try the poker room.

560
00:28:54,426 --> 00:28:56,330
Oh, you don't want
to go in there.

561
00:28:56,331 --> 00:28:58,800
Those guys are just
a bunch of sharks.

562
00:28:58,801 --> 00:29:02,061
I'm sure I won't be here long.
I'm playing for a friend.

563
00:29:02,062 --> 00:29:04,825
100 bucks?
You're an honest woman.

564
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,588
When somebody gives me
money to gamble,

565
00:29:06,589 --> 00:29:08,958
I pocket it and tell 'em they lost.

566
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:16,037
Except you, Lottie.
You actually lost.

567
00:29:25,875 --> 00:29:27,811
What's so funny?

568
00:29:27,812 --> 00:29:30,986
Just wondering what Beth would
think if she could see us now,

569
00:29:30,987 --> 00:29:33,890
driving along like
we're off to a picnic.

570
00:29:34,723 --> 00:29:36,281
I think she'd be glad.

571
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:38,704
Our hate was what killed her.

572
00:29:39,294 --> 00:29:41,498
She couldn't please either of us
without hurting the other,

573
00:29:41,499 --> 00:29:44,411
so she just walked away.

574
00:29:44,526 --> 00:29:48,995
So maybe she's thinking,
"Oh, great. Now they get along."

575
00:29:49,263 --> 00:29:52,158
Or "Better late than never."

576
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,735
- Tell me something, Paul.
- What?

577
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:03,467
Did she suffer at the end,
in her last conscious moments?

578
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:06,401
I don't know.
I wasn't there when she died.

579
00:30:06,402 --> 00:30:09,372
No, I didn't mean Beth.
I meant my sister.

580
00:30:11,231 --> 00:30:13,060
You were there for that one.

581
00:30:13,989 --> 00:30:15,808
For God sakes, Felicia.

582
00:30:15,809 --> 00:30:18,258
I've wondered
about this for years.

583
00:30:19,287 --> 00:30:20,891
I'm not wearing a wire, Paul.

584
00:30:20,892 --> 00:30:24,528
And I'm not gonna frisk you
to make sure, so let's drop it.

585
00:30:24,529 --> 00:30:25,441
Think about it.

586
00:30:26,041 --> 00:30:30,134
We both saw someone
we love be destroyed.

587
00:30:30,135 --> 00:30:34,546
First my sister drove
your wife to kill herself.

588
00:30:36,556 --> 00:30:39,976
You admit that? Finally?

589
00:30:39,977 --> 00:30:42,220
Yes, Paul, I do.

590
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:45,878
You loved your wife,

591
00:30:45,879 --> 00:30:48,034
so you killed my sister.

592
00:30:48,251 --> 00:30:49,945
I loved my sister,

593
00:30:49,946 --> 00:30:53,666
so I tried to destroy you,

594
00:30:55,111 --> 00:30:57,471
and who paid the price for it?

595
00:30:59,022 --> 00:31:00,606
Beth.

596
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:04,825
I just hope that
by doing this together,

597
00:31:04,826 --> 00:31:08,343
we can put a stop
to this awful cycle,

598
00:31:09,253 --> 00:31:12,713
and reach some sort of... closure.

599
00:31:19,826 --> 00:31:22,191
I'm all for closure.

600
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:30,818
Well, I lost my $50,
but I ate my weight in shrimp.

601
00:31:30,819 --> 00:31:33,704
So all in all, a good day.
How you doing?

602
00:31:33,705 --> 00:31:35,314
I'm okay.

603
00:31:35,527 --> 00:31:36,666
Yeah, you got a little left.

604
00:31:36,667 --> 00:31:39,081
What's that, 60 bucks?
Good for you, kid.

605
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:43,759
Those are $1,000 chips.
I'm all in.

606
00:31:45,001 --> 00:31:49,930
$1,000? Y... you bet $6,000?
What are you, nuts?!

607
00:31:49,931 --> 00:31:52,063
She's nuts.
We're taking these back.

608
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:54,071
Hands off the table, sir.

609
00:31:54,795 --> 00:31:57,441
Grandpa must know something.
I'll call.

610
00:31:57,571 --> 00:31:59,631
2 pair, kings over 4s.

611
00:32:04,652 --> 00:32:07,499
Three aces!
The kid had three aces!

612
00:32:07,833 --> 00:32:11,406
Susan, you won over $12,

613
00:32:11,953 --> 00:32:13,359
I know.

614
00:32:13,534 --> 00:32:14,768
I just...

615
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,095
keep...

616
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,033
winning.

617
00:32:24,732 --> 00:32:29,234
And you cry every time.
You're weird.

618
00:32:29,235 --> 00:32:31,839
Susan, what's wrong?

619
00:32:32,178 --> 00:32:33,300
My friend...

620
00:32:33,301 --> 00:32:36,345
Your friend is gonna be thrilled.
You just won for him.

621
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,714
He died yesterday.

622
00:32:40,695 --> 00:32:42,972
He wanted me to come here.

623
00:32:43,243 --> 00:32:45,987
He said I was on a lucky streak.

624
00:32:46,168 --> 00:32:49,025
And he was right.
I am.

625
00:32:49,026 --> 00:32:50,101
But...

626
00:32:52,571 --> 00:32:53,663
Why?

627
00:32:55,586 --> 00:32:59,967
Why do I keep winning
while other people lose?

628
00:33:00,194 --> 00:33:04,346
And why did I get a kidney
while good people died?

629
00:33:04,347 --> 00:33:06,575
It doesn't make any sense.

630
00:33:08,294 --> 00:33:13,018
I served in Korea with this guy,
Joe Dansak...

631
00:33:13,205 --> 00:33:17,908
Funny as hell, he made
whiskey sours in his helmet.

632
00:33:17,909 --> 00:33:21,506
One day, we're out on patrol.

633
00:33:21,507 --> 00:33:24,007
I felt something whizz past my ear,

634
00:33:24,008 --> 00:33:28,432
I turned and looked,
and Joe was on the ground.

635
00:33:28,433 --> 00:33:29,818
He was dead?

636
00:33:29,819 --> 00:33:30,716
Yeah.

637
00:33:32,162 --> 00:33:35,009
That night, I asked the sergeant,

638
00:33:35,154 --> 00:33:37,041
"Why was it him and not me?"

639
00:33:37,814 --> 00:33:42,194
He sort of shook his head
and said, "Why ask?"

640
00:33:46,967 --> 00:33:49,199
So you're trying to tell me...

641
00:33:50,059 --> 00:33:53,421
that it is... random.

642
00:33:53,422 --> 00:33:55,304
I'm trying to do anything I can

643
00:33:55,305 --> 00:33:57,772
to get you to stop crying, honey.

644
00:34:00,032 --> 00:34:01,566
You're on a lucky streak.

645
00:34:01,567 --> 00:34:05,960
Who knows why?
Just enjoy it.

646
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:10,123
But what happens
when my luck runs out?

647
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:13,541
I know.

648
00:34:14,899 --> 00:34:16,237
"Why ask?"

649
00:34:16,238 --> 00:34:17,550
Why ask?

650
00:34:20,628 --> 00:34:22,919
How about right here?

651
00:34:23,543 --> 00:34:26,865
What do you think, honey?
Is this a good spot?

652
00:34:26,866 --> 00:34:29,361
Would you stop talking to the urn?
You're creeping me out.

653
00:34:29,362 --> 00:34:30,320
Must we bicker? I thought

654
00:34:30,321 --> 00:34:33,433
the point of doing this together
was to make a fresh start.

655
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:35,352
Do you really think I'm that stupid?

656
00:34:35,353 --> 00:34:38,144
That just scattering some ashes
is gonna make me trust you?

657
00:34:38,145 --> 00:34:41,065
Ugh. I know you don't trust me, Paul.

658
00:34:41,066 --> 00:34:42,869
It's why you brought a gun.

659
00:34:44,437 --> 00:34:45,588
What?

660
00:34:45,871 --> 00:34:47,739
You're not gonna deny it.

661
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:52,287
Okay. So what?
You show up at my house and say,

662
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,911
"Hey, let's go to the woods together."

663
00:34:53,912 --> 00:34:55,809
I'd be crazy not to bring a gun.

664
00:34:55,810 --> 00:35:00,224
I know... and I'd be crazy
to let you keep it.

665
00:35:01,326 --> 00:35:02,090
What?

666
00:35:04,241 --> 00:35:05,867
How did you get that?

667
00:35:05,868 --> 00:35:08,558
Prison's not a very nice place to live,

668
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:10,688
but I did pick up a few skills.

669
00:35:11,706 --> 00:35:13,909
I just brought that
for self-defense.

670
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:15,688
So now I'm supposed
to believe you?

671
00:35:16,585 --> 00:35:18,289
See, that's our problem, Paul.

672
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:20,832
How do you trust somebody
who doesn't trust you?

673
00:35:21,269 --> 00:35:24,904
You fear me, so you bring a gun.
I fear you, so I take it.

674
00:35:24,905 --> 00:35:26,925
Where does it end?

675
00:35:27,227 --> 00:35:29,512
Just put the gun down.

676
00:35:29,513 --> 00:35:31,411
It could end right here

677
00:35:31,412 --> 00:35:34,744
with me shooting you
just so I can sleep easier.

678
00:35:34,745 --> 00:35:36,775
Go ahead. Shoot me.

679
00:35:36,776 --> 00:35:39,586
At least I'll die knowing
you'll rot in jail forever.

680
00:35:39,587 --> 00:35:41,864
Oh, I don't think so.

681
00:35:41,865 --> 00:35:45,075
I'll plead self-defense.
It is your gun, after all.

682
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:47,650
You pulled it on me,
we struggled, it went off.

683
00:35:47,651 --> 00:35:51,611
I could kill you right now
and go scot-free.

684
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:59,326
Or I could do this.

685
00:36:06,002 --> 00:36:08,683
I don't want you dead, Paul.

686
00:36:08,684 --> 00:36:10,280
And I don't want us
to fear each other.

687
00:36:10,281 --> 00:36:14,739
I just want this over.
Don't you?

688
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,981
I think you should do the honors.

689
00:36:44,855 --> 00:36:48,486
Well, just keep looking.
It's not that big a forest.

690
00:36:49,232 --> 00:36:52,350
Finally! Next time you drop
your girls off for a few hours,

691
00:36:52,351 --> 00:36:54,909
you might mention you may not
be home that night.

692
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:57,078
The roads were closed.
We we trapped in the woods.

693
00:36:57,079 --> 00:36:59,209
Could have been worse.
Could have been at my dinner party

694
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:00,943
when I tried to serve the tiramisu

695
00:37:00,944 --> 00:37:04,616
- and the "tira" had been licked off.
- Look, Lee, I'm sorry, okay?

696
00:37:04,617 --> 00:37:06,465
My guests were another
gay couple who were thinking

697
00:37:06,466 --> 00:37:09,471
of adopting a child.
They're not anymore.

698
00:37:09,472 --> 00:37:11,671
Lee, cut me some slack.
My husband is missing.

699
00:37:11,672 --> 00:37:14,175
Don't try to play me.
Carlos called this morning.

700
00:37:14,925 --> 00:37:16,262
He did?

701
00:37:16,263 --> 00:37:18,365
Yeah. He asked if
I could watch the girls

702
00:37:18,366 --> 00:37:20,715
for a few more hours
while he drove out to Littleton.

703
00:37:20,716 --> 00:37:23,625
I said, "Why not?
I have very few breakables left."

704
00:37:23,626 --> 00:37:25,615
What's he doing out in Littleton?

705
00:37:26,048 --> 00:37:27,653
I know. Come on.

706
00:37:27,654 --> 00:37:30,047
What? No, wait. Gaby, wait!

707
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:35,572
I'm hungry.

708
00:37:35,573 --> 00:37:37,073
Of course you are.

709
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:42,746
You'll be pleased to know
that Paul was very touched

710
00:37:42,747 --> 00:37:44,362
when we scattered the ashes.

711
00:37:44,363 --> 00:37:46,966
He even teared up
a little at the end.

712
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:48,862
'Course...

713
00:37:49,102 --> 00:37:52,932
He thought it was
really you in the urn...

714
00:37:53,901 --> 00:37:57,986
not just some sweepings
from the fireplace.

715
00:37:59,064 --> 00:38:03,577
But I would never scatter you
in the woods.

716
00:38:03,578 --> 00:38:08,067
No. You're going to stay
where you belong,

717
00:38:08,068 --> 00:38:10,869
right here...

718
00:38:12,472 --> 00:38:14,769
with me.

719
00:38:15,054 --> 00:38:17,504
And don't you worry about Paul.

720
00:38:18,701 --> 00:38:21,766
I'll make him pay
for what he did to you.

721
00:38:22,156 --> 00:38:24,354
But not just by shooting him, no.

722
00:38:24,355 --> 00:38:28,024
That's too quick, too...

723
00:38:28,183 --> 00:38:29,740
merciful.

724
00:38:30,386 --> 00:38:31,321
No.

725
00:38:32,933 --> 00:38:35,531
Death is the easy way out.

726
00:38:37,683 --> 00:38:40,410
But look who I'm telling.

727
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:48,365
Oh, Carlos...

728
00:38:48,366 --> 00:38:50,186
thank God you're okay.

729
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:52,879
You really scared us.

730
00:38:54,752 --> 00:38:57,952
Aw. Flowers for your mom.
How sweet.

731
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:00,942
Save it, Gaby.
You never liked her.

732
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,609
Maybe you're right.

733
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:09,869
Maybe I didn't see why
she had to be in your life so much,

734
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:11,876
why she couldn't just let go.

735
00:39:13,272 --> 00:39:15,047
But I wasn't a mother yet.

736
00:39:16,556 --> 00:39:19,364
I didn't realize you never let go.

737
00:39:19,491 --> 00:39:21,677
Listen, uh, Carlos...

738
00:39:21,678 --> 00:39:25,958
We are so deeply sorry
for what we did.

739
00:39:26,117 --> 00:39:29,143
Andrew was only 16
and already abusing alcohol,

740
00:39:29,144 --> 00:39:30,922
a habit that he learned from me,
so I...

741
00:39:30,923 --> 00:39:33,002
Quiet, m... mom, please.

742
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:34,057
I'm just trying to defend you.

743
00:39:34,058 --> 00:39:36,731
I know. I know.
It's what you've always done.

744
00:39:36,732 --> 00:39:40,658
And I've let you. That's why
my life has been such a mess,

745
00:39:40,659 --> 00:39:44,252
but I need to do this.
This is between me and Carlos.

746
00:39:44,253 --> 00:39:47,085
- Just please, wait in the car, okay?
- But, Andrew...

747
00:39:47,086 --> 00:39:48,674
The car, mom!

748
00:39:52,643 --> 00:39:54,897
Bree, let's go to the car.

749
00:40:01,125 --> 00:40:03,209
I'm gonna make this right.

750
00:40:04,265 --> 00:40:07,431
You can sue me.
You can go to the police.

751
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,182
Whatever it takes.

752
00:40:11,793 --> 00:40:14,188
I know this must hurt.

753
00:40:14,189 --> 00:40:15,666
I'm not hurt.

754
00:40:17,603 --> 00:40:19,469
I'm proud.

755
00:40:22,624 --> 00:40:23,860
Sit down.

756
00:40:27,441 --> 00:40:30,721
Yes, whenever we make mistakes,

757
00:40:30,722 --> 00:40:32,950
we need to apologize,

758
00:40:32,951 --> 00:40:35,590
and then we need to move on.

759
00:40:38,508 --> 00:40:43,001
We must try to accept
the changes in our lives...

760
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:51,115
Or choose to trust
an old enemy,

761
00:40:53,525 --> 00:40:57,948
or learn to stop fighting
our children's battles.

762
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:04,876
But sometimes the pain
we've caused is so great,

763
00:41:04,877 --> 00:41:08,088
there is no moving on.

764
00:41:08,089 --> 00:41:11,628
Carlos, I want to thank you
for forgiving Andrew.

765
00:41:11,629 --> 00:41:15,591
You are a generous man,
and I am so grateful to you.

766
00:41:17,718 --> 00:41:19,155
May I come in?

767
00:41:19,156 --> 00:41:21,662
- You can go to hell.
- Carlos.

768
00:41:22,412 --> 00:41:23,834
Excuse me?

769
00:41:23,988 --> 00:41:27,120
I did forgive Andrew.
He was a kid that made a mistake,

770
00:41:27,121 --> 00:41:30,155
but you were an adult... my friend...

771
00:41:30,156 --> 00:41:31,846
who covered up for him.

772
00:41:31,847 --> 00:41:32,838
Carlos, please...

773
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:34,983
Mnh-mnh. Listen carefully,

774
00:41:34,984 --> 00:41:38,764
because this is the last thing
I am ever going to say to you.

775
00:41:38,765 --> 00:41:40,849
We are no longer friends,
not you and me,

776
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:42,613
- and not you and Gaby.
- You can't speak for me.

777
00:41:42,614 --> 00:41:44,674
I just did.

778
00:41:47,957 --> 00:41:49,579
No barbecues,

779
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:51,573
no cocktail parties,
no poker games.

780
00:41:53,167 --> 00:41:55,837
You are not even
to wave to us on the street.

781
00:41:56,552 --> 00:41:58,319
That's how it's going to be.

782
00:42:03,414 --> 00:42:05,180
You can keep your muffins.

783
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:16,680
