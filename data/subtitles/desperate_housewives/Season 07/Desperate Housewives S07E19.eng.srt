<i>Previously on
"Desperate Housewives"</i>...

2
00:00:04,227 --> 00:00:08,052
Paul was shocked to find
Felisha was back on the lane.

3
00:00:08,053 --> 00:00:09,833
Well, hello, Paul.

4
00:00:09,834 --> 00:00:12,349
Tom's new job came with perks.

5
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:15,481
You know what you
can do on a private jet?

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,673
Anything.

7
00:00:17,674 --> 00:00:20,156
A relationship was forced to end.

8
00:00:20,157 --> 00:00:22,133
We are no longer friends,
not you and me,

9
00:00:22,134 --> 00:00:24,077
- and not you and Gaby.
- You can't speak for me.

10
00:00:24,078 --> 00:00:28,482
- I just did. - And Susan got
her transplant, thanks to Paul.

11
00:00:28,483 --> 00:00:31,502
I'm sure as I sign the papers,
they'll be contacting you.

12
00:00:36,418 --> 00:00:38,160
After Susan Delfino's

13
00:00:38,161 --> 00:00:41,014
kidney transplant,
her doctor ordered her

14
00:00:41,097 --> 00:00:43,130
to abstain from sex...

15
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:45,905
for six weeks.

16
00:00:48,403 --> 00:00:51,800
But what the doctor
couldn't prevent Susan from doing...

17
00:00:52,715 --> 00:00:55,056
was dreaming about it.

18
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:01,967
These dreams were filled
with torrid caresses...

19
00:01:03,962 --> 00:01:06,083
with passionate kisses...

20
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:12,215
and with soft cries of ecstasy.

21
00:01:12,216 --> 00:01:13,533
Ahh.

22
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:16,978
The only thing missing
from these dreams...

23
00:01:19,228 --> 00:01:20,888
was her husband.

24
00:01:29,383 --> 00:01:30,890
Are you okay?

25
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:33,161
Uh... yeah, I just...

26
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:35,562
Had a dream.

27
00:01:35,563 --> 00:01:37,070
Yeah, I know.

28
00:01:37,521 --> 00:01:39,941
You know? What do you know?

29
00:01:39,942 --> 00:01:43,203
- Was I saying something? Was I talking?
- More like moaning.

30
00:01:43,204 --> 00:01:46,269
Oh, moaning! Oh, God.

31
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,206
Yeah, you mentioned him, too.

32
00:01:49,082 --> 00:01:51,565
Oh, don't be embarrassed.
So you had a sex dream.

33
00:01:51,648 --> 00:01:53,813
It's not surprising given
how long we've had to lay off.

34
00:01:54,386 --> 00:01:56,675
Tell me... what were we doing?

35
00:01:56,676 --> 00:01:58,825
Uh... we...

36
00:01:58,914 --> 00:02:00,120
Hey, maybe we could recreate it

37
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:03,184
when we end our drought
in 2 days, 17 hours,

38
00:02:03,185 --> 00:02:05,902
- and 35 minutes.
- Well, uh...

39
00:02:05,903 --> 00:02:08,637
needless to say, it was
some pretty kinky stuff.

40
00:02:08,638 --> 00:02:10,293
Like, did we--
did we do that thing--

41
00:02:10,294 --> 00:02:13,289
- that thing we talked about?
- Mike, it was my dream, not yours.

42
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,931
Oh, God, I'm desperate.
Can you give me some details?

43
00:02:16,932 --> 00:02:24,258
Uh... or could show you
in 2 days, 17 hours,

44
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:26,144
and 34 minutes.

45
00:02:26,762 --> 00:02:28,173
That'll work.

46
00:02:28,645 --> 00:02:31,164
I can't wait. We'll send M.J.
to Mrs. McCluskey's,

47
00:02:31,165 --> 00:02:33,027
and have the whole night together.

48
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:37,353
Yes, Susan was having
dreams about sex.

49
00:02:37,518 --> 00:02:39,491
Just the two of us.

50
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:42,513
Uh-huh. Just me and...

51
00:02:43,339 --> 00:02:44,499
you.

52
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,735
And they were becoming
a nightmare.

00:02:59,044 --> 00:03:03,636
The residents of Wisteria Lane
are nothing if not loyal.

55
00:03:04,619 --> 00:03:06,823
They love their country.

56
00:03:08,758 --> 00:03:11,055
They root for the home team.

57
00:03:14,456 --> 00:03:17,293
They support their favorite brand.

58
00:03:19,153 --> 00:03:22,247
But the fiercest loyalty
on Wisteria Lane

59
00:03:22,553 --> 00:03:24,949
is the one between friends.

60
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,689
All right. I gotta run.
I'm meeting the girls for coffee.

61
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:28,745
Stop.

62
00:03:29,686 --> 00:03:32,116
Which girls? Will Bree be there?

63
00:03:32,117 --> 00:03:33,765
She better be. She's buying.

64
00:03:33,766 --> 00:03:35,497
Then you're not going.

65
00:03:35,498 --> 00:03:38,397
Wait. You were serious about us
never speaking to Bree again?

66
00:03:38,398 --> 00:03:40,841
That woman satour table,
spent the holidays with us,

67
00:03:40,842 --> 00:03:43,084
all the while knowing
her son ran over my mother.

68
00:03:43,085 --> 00:03:45,688
- Yeah, I'm serious.
- Fine, then you stop talking to her.

69
00:03:45,689 --> 00:03:48,831
But you're not gonna control me,
'cause I have the secret weapon.

70
00:03:48,832 --> 00:03:52,158
You'll withhold sex? Please.
You always fold before I do.

71
00:03:52,594 --> 00:03:53,630
That's not true.

72
00:03:53,656 --> 00:03:55,555
The last time you tried,
you got so turned on

73
00:03:55,556 --> 00:03:57,437
telling me what you
weren't gonna do to me,

74
00:03:57,632 --> 00:04:01,200
- you wound up doing it to me right then.
- Damn it.

75
00:04:01,887 --> 00:04:03,339
Well, you're still
not gonna stop me

76
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,210
- from seeing Bree.
- Yes, I am.

77
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,227
Our relationship
with that woman is over,

78
00:04:09,228 --> 00:04:11,353
and I forbid you to see her again.

79
00:04:14,061 --> 00:04:17,222
He forbid me.
Who is he to forbid me?

80
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:18,783
I mean, what is this, 19...

81
00:04:19,636 --> 00:04:22,087
Whenever it was that husbands
got to forbid their wives?

82
00:04:22,301 --> 00:04:24,828
Gaby, he has every reason to be upset.

83
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:25,840
I hate to say this,

84
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:28,988
but I think we should
keep our distance for a while.

85
00:04:28,989 --> 00:04:31,003
What? I'm not giving in to this.

86
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:33,299
I've already caused Carlos so much pain.

87
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,482
I think it's the only thing we can do.

88
00:04:35,716 --> 00:04:36,999
So what are you saying?

89
00:04:37,542 --> 00:04:40,185
No more poker?
No more lunches?

90
00:04:40,746 --> 00:04:42,172
No more shopping?

91
00:04:42,521 --> 00:04:44,311
I'll miss it as much as you do.

92
00:04:44,312 --> 00:04:46,678
Oh, really? Doesn't sound like it.

93
00:04:46,679 --> 00:04:49,330
- I think this is easy for you.
- Easy?

94
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:50,715
I wanna come over there right now,

95
00:04:50,716 --> 00:04:52,528
so you can drag me
to the mall kicking and screaming,

96
00:04:52,529 --> 00:04:54,327
but we can't.

97
00:04:54,869 --> 00:04:57,915
I have to go.
I have scones in the oven.

98
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:00,874
- I love your scones.
- Stop.

99
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:02,584
Good-bye, Gaby.

100
00:05:06,945 --> 00:05:08,345
You're not hanging up.

101
00:05:08,494 --> 00:05:09,807
But I have to.

102
00:05:19,326 --> 00:05:22,374
- Hey, Lynette! You're not gonna
believe this. I-- - Shh!

103
00:05:22,767 --> 00:05:24,372
I had to walk Paige
around the block

104
00:05:24,373 --> 00:05:27,384
eight times to get her down.

105
00:05:29,814 --> 00:05:34,277
Nothing is so important that
you need to raise your voice.

106
00:05:35,263 --> 00:05:37,114
Not even this?

107
00:05:38,894 --> 00:05:40,905
Weisman leadership conference?

108
00:05:41,489 --> 00:05:43,083
Seriously?

109
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,005
You're invited?!

110
00:05:45,006 --> 00:05:48,409
- And so are you.
- Oh, my God!

111
00:05:49,318 --> 00:05:51,903
Warren Buffett
goes to this conference,

112
00:05:51,904 --> 00:05:54,740
and Bill Gates and Oprah--

113
00:05:54,741 --> 00:05:56,586
It's one of her favorite things.

114
00:05:57,239 --> 00:06:02,339
Oh! Look at this!
All the great speakers.

115
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,762
- Plus they've got the spa, and--
- And no kids, right? No kids?

116
00:06:05,763 --> 00:06:07,782
No kids.

117
00:06:07,783 --> 00:06:09,613
Yes! Yes!

118
00:06:13,615 --> 00:06:16,613
You take her.
I gotta figure out what to wear.

119
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:24,107
Hey, you two!
Thanks for watching him.

120
00:06:24,654 --> 00:06:27,430
Hey, can you watch him again
on Wednesday? Mike and I are--

121
00:06:27,431 --> 00:06:29,927
Yeah, I know.
Your big night, huh?

122
00:06:29,928 --> 00:06:31,693
Mike told you?

123
00:06:31,694 --> 00:06:34,939
Didn't have to.
I caught him staring at my cleavage.

124
00:06:35,105 --> 00:06:39,237
So... post-transplant sex, huh?

125
00:06:39,238 --> 00:06:41,514
If it's as good
as my post-cancer sex,

126
00:06:41,515 --> 00:06:42,822
you're in for a treat.

127
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:45,403
Fingers crossed.

128
00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:47,788
Hey, have you looked
at your old house lately?

129
00:06:47,789 --> 00:06:49,129
It's kind of a wreck.

130
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,604
Does look a little neglected.

131
00:06:53,605 --> 00:06:56,359
You should go over and
talk to Paul. I'll watch M.J.

132
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,802
Oh. I... can't do that.

133
00:06:58,803 --> 00:07:01,904
Um, I mean, he might be
in the middle of something.

134
00:07:01,905 --> 00:07:04,588
Or he might be hanging
from the showerhead.

135
00:07:05,202 --> 00:07:06,554
Do me a favor and check.

136
00:07:06,555 --> 00:07:08,988
'Cause if he's dead in there,
I live downwind.

137
00:07:22,577 --> 00:07:23,706
Susan?

138
00:07:24,071 --> 00:07:25,073
Paul?

139
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:28,264
Paul.
Uh... hi there.

140
00:07:29,128 --> 00:07:31,110
Um... I-I was just
in the neighborhood,

141
00:07:31,111 --> 00:07:33,130
and it-- and it looked
like things were piling up,

142
00:07:33,131 --> 00:07:35,222
and would you mind
closing that robe, please?

143
00:07:35,223 --> 00:07:38,459
Oh, sorry.
And sorry about the mess.

144
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,583
I haven't been getting
out of the house much.

145
00:07:42,342 --> 00:07:44,985
You look thin.
Are you eating?

146
00:07:44,986 --> 00:07:46,238
Yes.

147
00:07:46,502 --> 00:07:49,247
I'm fine. I'm a little behind
on my chores.

148
00:07:50,368 --> 00:07:52,018
So if there's nothing else...

149
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:56,762
Paul, um...
are you sure you're okay?

150
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:59,518
Yes, Susan.
Fit as a fiddle.

151
00:08:00,299 --> 00:08:01,678
Good-bye.

152
00:08:16,558 --> 00:08:18,553
I've already spotted
two ex-senators

153
00:08:18,554 --> 00:08:19,744
and three covers of "Forbes."

154
00:08:19,745 --> 00:08:22,280
Everybody here is definitely A-list.

155
00:08:24,372 --> 00:08:26,232
Oh! Bob! Lee!

156
00:08:26,233 --> 00:08:28,567
- Hey, hey, you fancy hotshots.
- Hi!

157
00:08:28,568 --> 00:08:30,100
- Mwah.
- Mwah.

158
00:08:30,101 --> 00:08:31,247
Hiya. Hi.

159
00:08:31,248 --> 00:08:32,833
Glad you've done
this conference before,

160
00:08:32,834 --> 00:08:34,191
'cause I'm definitely
gonna need somebody

161
00:08:34,192 --> 00:08:36,980
- to show me the ropes.
- Nothing to it. Just don't talk politics.

162
00:08:36,981 --> 00:08:38,778
And don't push Warren Buffett
in the pool.

163
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:41,031
I didn't push him.
He got between me

164
00:08:41,032 --> 00:08:42,946
and the margarita bar.

165
00:08:43,986 --> 00:08:46,085
Oh, let me introduce you
to Barry Weisman.

166
00:08:46,086 --> 00:08:48,281
Prepare to endure the single most
bone-crushing handshake

167
00:08:48,282 --> 00:08:49,610
of your life.

168
00:08:50,277 --> 00:08:50,953
Bye.

169
00:08:51,786 --> 00:08:52,828
Come on.

170
00:08:54,542 --> 00:08:56,650
Well, with this line,
it's gonna be hard to get drunk.

171
00:08:57,671 --> 00:08:59,499
Lesson one--
The power of the words

172
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,469
"The president's council
of economic advisors

173
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,404
want their martinis now."

174
00:09:12,268 --> 00:09:13,913
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

175
00:09:13,914 --> 00:09:15,141
That's a little trick I learned

176
00:09:15,142 --> 00:09:17,423
when I was too cheap
to buy my own newspapers.

177
00:09:18,704 --> 00:09:22,095
How fantastic is it that
Chris Cavanaugh is speaking?

178
00:09:22,096 --> 00:09:23,708
I thought "Flashpoint"
was the best business book

179
00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:25,340
- of the year.
- I agree.

180
00:09:25,341 --> 00:09:27,830
I've heard him speak before.
He's even better in person.

181
00:09:27,831 --> 00:09:29,762
We're in for a treat tomorrow.

182
00:09:29,763 --> 00:09:32,115
Meg Butler, president of Amtech.

183
00:09:32,116 --> 00:09:33,803
Oh, um...

184
00:09:33,804 --> 00:09:35,825
Uh, Lynette Scavo.

185
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:38,711
My husband is the C.F.O.
of Morris Technologies.

186
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:41,256
Oh. You're a plus one.

187
00:09:41,736 --> 00:09:42,655
What's that mean?

188
00:09:42,656 --> 00:09:45,587
Unfortunately, it means you
won't be seeing Chris Cavanaugh.

189
00:09:45,588 --> 00:09:48,150
The seminars are only for participants.

190
00:09:48,151 --> 00:09:49,117
Wha--

191
00:09:49,118 --> 00:09:50,663
What am I gonna be doing?

192
00:09:50,664 --> 00:09:53,467
I will tell you what--
japanese flower arranging.

193
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:56,596
Did I weep at the simple beauty
of my design last year? Yes.

194
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:59,479
- Yes, I did.
- I don't want to arrange flowers.

195
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,806
Why are they dividing us up like this?

196
00:10:01,807 --> 00:10:04,572
Maybe it's because
some of us spent our lives

197
00:10:04,647 --> 00:10:06,642
working our way up
the corporate ladder,

198
00:10:06,643 --> 00:10:09,462
and others just
married someone who did.

199
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:11,290
Excuse me.

200
00:10:12,801 --> 00:10:14,031
Oh, no. That's--

201
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:17,419
Wow. That is ridiculous.

202
00:10:17,724 --> 00:10:19,723
I really want to see those seminars.

203
00:10:19,724 --> 00:10:20,557
Hey, don't worry.

204
00:10:20,558 --> 00:10:23,717
You are going to love
what they have planned for us.

205
00:10:25,855 --> 00:10:27,206
Attention!

206
00:10:27,587 --> 00:10:30,549
If I could have all
of my plus ones find a buddy,

207
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:33,213
we're going to get to know
each other with a scavenger hunt.

208
00:10:51,976 --> 00:10:52,910
Bree.

209
00:10:52,911 --> 00:10:54,917
Gaby. What are you doing here?

210
00:10:55,349 --> 00:10:57,791
I just came by to talk to Lynette.

211
00:10:58,226 --> 00:10:59,473
Oh, she's out of town.

212
00:10:59,474 --> 00:11:02,484
She asked me to water the plants
and collect the mail.

213
00:11:02,978 --> 00:11:04,047
Oh.

214
00:11:05,386 --> 00:11:07,219
You look good.

215
00:11:08,021 --> 00:11:09,393
You, too.

216
00:11:10,411 --> 00:11:11,918
New coat?

217
00:11:12,716 --> 00:11:14,397
You noticed.

218
00:11:16,104 --> 00:11:16,964
I should go.

219
00:11:16,965 --> 00:11:19,225
Can't you just stay and talk?

220
00:11:19,226 --> 00:11:22,335
- Maybe have a cup of coffee?
- Gaby, we shouldn't.

221
00:11:22,336 --> 00:11:24,963
- It's just coffee, Bree.
- But your husband...

222
00:11:24,964 --> 00:11:27,173
He'd never look for us here.

223
00:11:28,108 --> 00:11:29,964
Oh, come on.

224
00:11:29,965 --> 00:11:32,450
It's been really hard
for me not seeing you.

225
00:11:32,451 --> 00:11:35,054
Aw, it's been hard for me, too,

226
00:11:35,055 --> 00:11:37,013
especially with Lynette out of town.

227
00:11:37,014 --> 00:11:38,359
I mean, there's Susan, of course,

228
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,211
but lately whatever
topic you bring up,

229
00:11:40,212 --> 00:11:42,610
she manages to steer it
right back to kidneys.

230
00:11:42,611 --> 00:11:43,910
Tell me about it.

231
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,467
Well, I guess I...
could put on a pot.

232
00:11:52,802 --> 00:11:54,964
I like mine with cream.

233
00:11:55,397 --> 00:11:57,626
I know how you like it.

234
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,151
Hello, Karen.

235
00:12:09,152 --> 00:12:11,638
Felicia. Hi.

236
00:12:13,429 --> 00:12:15,415
When did they let you out?

237
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:17,677
About a week ago.

238
00:12:18,528 --> 00:12:22,707
I just stopped by because
I wanted you to have this.

239
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:25,466
It belonged to my sister, and...

240
00:12:25,467 --> 00:12:27,679
she was always so fond of you.

241
00:12:28,841 --> 00:12:30,663
That's sweet.

242
00:12:31,026 --> 00:12:33,298
It's my small way of saying thanks

243
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:35,882
for keeping my secret
all those years.

244
00:12:37,815 --> 00:12:40,478
Yeah, not much a secret anymore.

245
00:12:40,479 --> 00:12:42,101
Don't I know it.

246
00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:44,614
But I've kept your secret.

247
00:12:44,793 --> 00:12:47,130
I never told a soul about
your role that night,

248
00:12:47,131 --> 00:12:49,320
and I never will.

249
00:12:53,641 --> 00:12:54,853
Um...

250
00:12:55,595 --> 00:12:59,874
It's not really a good time
to talk about that.

251
00:13:00,051 --> 00:13:01,771
I understand.

252
00:13:01,962 --> 00:13:04,604
But I hope you'll stop
by my place sometime.

253
00:13:04,605 --> 00:13:06,995
We have so much
catching up to do.

254
00:13:06,996 --> 00:13:09,407
Sure. I'll do that.

255
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:14,433
Uh, wh-where are you staying?

256
00:13:14,701 --> 00:13:17,907
Haven't you heard?
I'm moving in next door.

257
00:13:17,908 --> 00:13:20,130
We're going to be neighbors.

258
00:13:25,277 --> 00:13:26,668
Who was that?

259
00:13:28,298 --> 00:13:30,477
Just an old friend.

260
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:34,261
Old friend?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

261
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,793
Make me a drink, will you, sweetie?

262
00:13:46,077 --> 00:13:47,468
Toby!

263
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:49,449
Here, kitty, kitty.

264
00:13:49,765 --> 00:13:51,751
Toby! Where are you?

265
00:13:51,752 --> 00:13:53,856
Here, kitty, kitty!

266
00:13:55,044 --> 00:13:56,638
Toby!

267
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,703
Oh, Felicia, help me out.

268
00:13:59,122 --> 00:14:01,834
Ida Greenberg's lost
her stupid cat again.

269
00:14:03,066 --> 00:14:05,106
What happened to you?
Is that blood?

270
00:14:05,107 --> 00:14:06,141
You never saw me.

271
00:14:06,142 --> 00:14:09,971
- I have to go.
- Your hand! Let me call you an ambulance.

272
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:16,266
You love my sister, right?

273
00:14:16,267 --> 00:14:18,246
Martha? Y-yeah.

274
00:14:18,247 --> 00:14:20,322
And you know Paul Young
murdered her?

275
00:14:20,323 --> 00:14:22,359
There's no doubt in my mind.

276
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,135
Oh, my God.

277
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,681
Did you kill Paul?

278
00:14:29,682 --> 00:14:31,237
No!

279
00:14:32,228 --> 00:14:34,348
He killed me.

280
00:14:34,735 --> 00:14:35,691
What?

281
00:14:35,692 --> 00:14:39,005
They'll find my blood in his house
and my fingers in the car,

282
00:14:39,006 --> 00:14:41,781
and he'll spend
the rest of his life prison

283
00:14:41,782 --> 00:14:45,735
if you say you never saw me.

284
00:14:46,121 --> 00:14:48,848
- Don't ask me to do this.
- Please, Karen!

285
00:14:48,849 --> 00:14:51,621
Paul got away
with Martha's murder,

286
00:14:51,902 --> 00:14:56,271
but... he won't get away with mine.

287
00:15:08,571 --> 00:15:10,242
Toby.

288
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:12,487
Here, kitty, kitty!

289
00:15:21,034 --> 00:15:26,286
Ikebana is all about bringing
together nature and humanity.

290
00:15:26,287 --> 00:15:27,537
The three main branches,

291
00:15:27,538 --> 00:15:31,536
or shushi, represent chi-- earth,

292
00:15:31,537 --> 00:15:36,084
ten-- heaven, and jin-- man.

293
00:15:36,085 --> 00:15:38,751
Interesting.
Nothing to represent woman.

294
00:15:38,752 --> 00:15:42,058
How about this insignificant
clump of moss?

295
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:43,563
We could stuff it down at the bottom,

296
00:15:43,564 --> 00:15:46,292
where it will only speak
when spoken to.

297
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:49,144
- Does my chi look a little droopy?
- Did you hear me?

298
00:15:49,145 --> 00:15:50,400
Yes.

299
00:15:50,656 --> 00:15:52,437
Yes, Lynette, I heard you.

300
00:15:52,616 --> 00:15:54,774
I heard you during yoga,
during the fashion show,

301
00:15:54,775 --> 00:15:57,341
all through salsa dancing--
"Life is unfair."

302
00:15:57,342 --> 00:15:59,320
- Olé!
- Well, I'm sorry, but I came here

303
00:15:59,321 --> 00:16:01,654
to learn new things
and meet interesting people,

304
00:16:01,655 --> 00:16:05,843
not to pretend that
putting sticks in a vase is art.

305
00:16:06,103 --> 00:16:07,870
Are we still having a problem?

306
00:16:07,871 --> 00:16:10,077
Yes, we still are.

307
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:12,581
Doesn't it piss you all off

308
00:16:12,582 --> 00:16:15,362
that we're stuck in our gilded cage,

309
00:16:15,363 --> 00:16:17,302
forbidden to go
to interesting seminars

310
00:16:17,303 --> 00:16:20,680
- just because we're plus ones?
- No.

311
00:16:20,681 --> 00:16:24,398
This is fun.
I really feel like I'm in Japan.

312
00:16:24,602 --> 00:16:27,077
This is the United States of America
in the 21st century,

313
00:16:27,078 --> 00:16:29,539
not some oppressive
patriarchal regime.

314
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:33,588
It may be small and red,

315
00:16:33,589 --> 00:16:37,036
but this lanyard
is no better than a burka!

316
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:41,363
- Oh, dear. - We need to storm the gates
and demand to be let inside!

317
00:16:41,364 --> 00:16:43,068
- If you're not gonna use the rest
of your flowers, can I--

318
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:45,715
Come on! Rise up!
If we do it together,

319
00:16:45,716 --> 00:16:47,633
we will not be denied!

320
00:16:49,486 --> 00:16:50,851
4:00, people!

321
00:16:50,852 --> 00:16:53,061
I think you've all earned a cocktail.

322
00:16:55,322 --> 00:16:57,596
No. No!

323
00:16:57,597 --> 00:16:59,976
No, do not drink those!

324
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:02,989
Those are the--
the cocktails of oppression,

325
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:07,811
make from equal parts tyranny
and blind obedience, and...

326
00:17:08,597 --> 00:17:11,246
Oh, screw it.

327
00:17:13,036 --> 00:17:15,949
Mmm. This is the best
pineapple upside-down cake

328
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,970
- you have ever made.
- You know why?

329
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:21,409
It has an ingredient my cakes
have never had before...

330
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:23,093
Danger.

331
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:26,802
I know! Sneaking around
makes everything taste better.

332
00:17:27,063 --> 00:17:31,109
When I was with John Rowland,
every sense was heightened,

333
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,541
it was like this...

334
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:37,037
Skip it. You wouldn't understand.

335
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:39,816
Oh, really? Wouldn't I?

336
00:17:40,582 --> 00:17:43,144
What? You? No way.

337
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,584
Just because I don't trumpet
my indiscretions like you do,

338
00:17:45,585 --> 00:17:48,557
doesn't mean I haven't had
a little walk on the wild side.

339
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:50,200
- You cheated on Rex?
- Of course not.

340
00:17:50,201 --> 00:17:53,192
What do you take me for?
I cheated on Orson.

341
00:17:53,193 --> 00:17:54,768
With who?

342
00:17:55,097 --> 00:17:56,974
Karl Mayer.

343
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:58,479
Oh, my God!

344
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,818
He was a slimeball,
but he was hot.

345
00:18:00,819 --> 00:18:02,608
Mm. We'd meet at this cheap hotel,

346
00:18:02,609 --> 00:18:06,743
and as guilty as it made me,
I still felt this... tingle,

347
00:18:06,744 --> 00:18:09,853
this frisson I'd never felt before.

348
00:18:09,854 --> 00:18:13,763
And now this week with you...
it's back.

349
00:18:13,928 --> 00:18:14,983
Hmm.

350
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,953
Just wish Lynette didn't have
to come home tomorrow.

351
00:18:19,653 --> 00:18:23,109
Actually, that motel story
gives me an idea.

352
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,216
Gaby, I'm flattered,

353
00:18:24,217 --> 00:18:25,835
- but I really don't think we should--
- Not that.

354
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:29,425
There's a great new spa
that just opened on Foster Lake.

355
00:18:29,426 --> 00:18:31,703
We should go next weekend.

356
00:18:31,922 --> 00:18:33,467
Do we dare?

357
00:18:33,536 --> 00:18:35,736
I think we both know
the answer to that.

358
00:18:38,382 --> 00:18:40,120
I went by our house today.

359
00:18:40,121 --> 00:18:41,937
It's looking a little run-down.

360
00:18:41,938 --> 00:18:43,713
Yeah? You want me to talk to Paul?

361
00:18:43,714 --> 00:18:45,244
He's supposed
to be keeping the place up.

362
00:18:45,245 --> 00:18:48,410
Uh, actually, I already did. Uh...

363
00:18:49,678 --> 00:18:52,198
he seems kind of run-down, too.

364
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:54,320
Wh-what are you doing
talking to Paul?

365
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:59,640
Well, I was picking up M.J.,
and he came out of the house,

366
00:18:59,641 --> 00:19:02,763
and... kind of worried about him.

367
00:19:02,764 --> 00:19:04,090
Why? Who cares?

368
00:19:04,091 --> 00:19:06,754
Mike, he gave me a kidney.

369
00:19:06,755 --> 00:19:08,550
No, Beth gave you a kidney.

370
00:19:08,551 --> 00:19:10,585
Paul did everything
he could to block it.

371
00:19:10,586 --> 00:19:15,477
Yeah, but we talked,
and after, he seemed so sad.

372
00:19:15,478 --> 00:19:16,979
I don't give a damn!

373
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:19,609
I know you feel bad for the guy,
but I don't trust him.

374
00:19:21,843 --> 00:19:24,851
Please... just do me a favor

375
00:19:24,852 --> 00:19:26,649
and stay away from him.

376
00:19:28,377 --> 00:19:29,694
Okay.

377
00:19:31,525 --> 00:19:34,236
Now can we talk about
something a little more fun?

378
00:19:34,237 --> 00:19:36,862
Like our plan for sex night?

379
00:19:38,042 --> 00:19:41,143
Okay, hold that thought.
I'm gonna take a shower.

380
00:19:58,435 --> 00:20:00,337
May I come in?

381
00:20:01,717 --> 00:20:03,291
Please.

382
00:20:31,548 --> 00:20:32,681
Lynette, what are you doing here?

383
00:20:32,682 --> 00:20:34,152
I thought you had a spa thing.

384
00:20:34,153 --> 00:20:36,341
Oh, please.
I can get a face full of steam

385
00:20:36,342 --> 00:20:38,789
standing over a pot of spaghetti
any night of the week.

386
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,480
I wanna see Chris Cavanaugh.

387
00:20:40,481 --> 00:20:42,975
I know, and I asked,
and they said no.

388
00:20:42,976 --> 00:20:44,686
The keynote speech
isn't for spouses.

389
00:20:44,687 --> 00:20:47,243
They said they've got
other activities planned for you.

390
00:20:47,244 --> 00:20:51,702
Activities that they plan for me?
Tom, I'm not a child.

391
00:20:55,682 --> 00:20:59,026
I'm a grown-up.
I'll decide what I want to do.

392
00:20:59,027 --> 00:21:01,657
Come on. Don't you know
how much I wanna see this guy?

393
00:21:01,658 --> 00:21:04,293
Can't you pull some strings?
I don't have any strings.

394
00:21:04,294 --> 00:21:05,687
When I've been five or six times,

395
00:21:05,688 --> 00:21:08,036
then maybe I can ask
for a favor, but not now.

396
00:21:08,202 --> 00:21:10,930
There you are.
Someone's been naughty.

397
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,625
Let's go, Mrs. Scavo.
I think it's somebody's spa time.

398
00:21:16,274 --> 00:21:19,356
This is why you keep us drunk, huh?
So we don't fight back.

399
00:21:24,536 --> 00:21:25,823
This hits the spot.

400
00:21:25,824 --> 00:21:27,196
I remembered you like your coffee

401
00:21:27,197 --> 00:21:31,571
same way you like your men--
strong... and Irish.

402
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:36,065
So how did you get out
of jail so soon?

403
00:21:36,117 --> 00:21:37,627
Was it good behavior

404
00:21:37,628 --> 00:21:40,289
or bad behavior with the warden?

405
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:41,790
Oh, Karen.

406
00:21:42,171 --> 00:21:45,974
How I've missed your
frank and salty questions.

407
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:49,167
Actually, it was, uh,

408
00:21:49,611 --> 00:21:52,418
what they call humanitarian release.

409
00:21:52,584 --> 00:21:53,600
You see...

410
00:21:55,425 --> 00:21:58,525
my only daughter
passed away just recently.

411
00:21:59,628 --> 00:22:02,129
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you had a daughter.

412
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,611
Such a sweet girl.

413
00:22:03,969 --> 00:22:05,136
So young.

414
00:22:07,966 --> 00:22:10,085
She was barely 30 when she died.

415
00:22:10,177 --> 00:22:11,950
I wish could have met her.

416
00:22:12,277 --> 00:22:13,933
Actually, I'm pretty sure you did.

417
00:22:13,934 --> 00:22:16,811
Her name was Beth.
Beth Young.

418
00:22:20,534 --> 00:22:22,539
Can I... freshen that?

419
00:22:27,384 --> 00:22:29,572
So we'll cut you back to ten
every other day

420
00:22:29,573 --> 00:22:33,758
on the prednisone and take it from there.
Any questions?

421
00:22:34,971 --> 00:22:35,963
I do have one.

422
00:22:35,964 --> 00:22:36,880
Shoot.

423
00:22:38,688 --> 00:22:40,666
Is it common for patients
to have sex dreams

424
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:43,029
about the husbands
of their dead donors?

425
00:22:43,815 --> 00:22:45,875
I have to admit,
I did not see that coming.

426
00:22:45,876 --> 00:22:50,441
Understand-- awake, I have
no conscious desire for this man.

427
00:22:50,442 --> 00:22:51,572
But in my dreams...

428
00:22:51,573 --> 00:22:54,639
- Susan, I'm not a psychologist.
- But you went to med school.

429
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,332
You must have learned
something about dreams--

430
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:59,121
a course, a book.

431
00:22:59,122 --> 00:23:03,330
Okay. What did you talk about
before you went to sleep?

432
00:23:03,331 --> 00:23:04,999
- I was talking about him.
- Oh.

433
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,660
I mean, he's not doing
very well, and I got

434
00:23:07,661 --> 00:23:10,506
in an argument with my husband
about whether I should help him.

435
00:23:10,507 --> 00:23:13,305
Well, maybe the dream is telling you
to follow that impulse.

436
00:23:13,521 --> 00:23:16,307
The man's wife died.
You're alive because of it.

437
00:23:16,308 --> 00:23:18,117
It's natural to be concerned about him

438
00:23:18,118 --> 00:23:20,028
and want to make sure he's okay.

439
00:23:20,496 --> 00:23:23,270
Mike really doesn't want me
to talk to him.

440
00:23:23,744 --> 00:23:27,106
It's your call, but my guess is your
dreams won't stop until you do.

441
00:23:29,924 --> 00:23:31,425
When Paul went to jail,

442
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:35,408
his one goal was to make me
pay for putting him there,

443
00:23:35,409 --> 00:23:38,306
so he wrote to Beth,
begging her to come see him.

444
00:23:38,307 --> 00:23:41,997
He said he was innocent,
that he was a good man.

445
00:23:42,824 --> 00:23:46,427
Paul's very charming when
he wants to be, and Beth...

446
00:23:46,511 --> 00:23:48,154
she fell in love with him,

447
00:23:48,155 --> 00:23:50,603
just like he knew she would.

448
00:23:50,604 --> 00:23:52,193
Well, didn't you try to warn her?

449
00:23:52,194 --> 00:23:57,047
Of course. She just said
I didn't know him like she did.

450
00:23:57,048 --> 00:24:01,135
When he was released,
when he had defiled her,

451
00:24:01,426 --> 00:24:03,127
the real Paul came out.

452
00:24:03,128 --> 00:24:07,510
He said he'd never loved her,
that she was stupid

453
00:24:07,582 --> 00:24:09,854
and that she didn't deserve to live.

454
00:24:11,857 --> 00:24:14,957
S-so she killed herself...

455
00:24:16,262 --> 00:24:18,928
just like he knew she would.

456
00:24:19,629 --> 00:24:20,903
Bastard.

457
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:23,793
I hope you'll keep
this story between us

458
00:24:23,794 --> 00:24:24,762
at least for now.

459
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:27,399
Beth would hate
for all her friends to know

460
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,108
what a fool she was.

461
00:24:29,109 --> 00:24:31,322
Okay, but the one thing I don't get

462
00:24:31,323 --> 00:24:34,132
is why do you wanna live
on the same street as that monster?

463
00:24:34,133 --> 00:24:35,597
So I can watch him!

464
00:24:36,865 --> 00:24:40,157
It's too late for Beth and my sister,

465
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:43,247
but I won't let him
destroy another woman

466
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:45,385
the way he destroyed them.

467
00:24:45,386 --> 00:24:46,804
Well, you're not watching him alone,

468
00:24:46,805 --> 00:24:49,441
because I'll keep my eye
on that S.O.B., too.

469
00:24:49,717 --> 00:24:52,149
Now if you need anything--
anything at all--

470
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:53,586
you give me a call.

471
00:24:54,038 --> 00:24:55,892
Oh, Karen.

472
00:24:58,751 --> 00:25:01,448
I'm so lucky to have a friend like you.

473
00:25:09,955 --> 00:25:12,768
Wonderful what a
4-handed massage can do.

474
00:25:13,523 --> 00:25:15,501
One more hand,
and it would've been perfect,

475
00:25:15,652 --> 00:25:17,301
but this ain't that kind of spa.

476
00:25:19,357 --> 00:25:20,276
Yeah.

477
00:25:20,449 --> 00:25:22,959
No, no, tell him he has a choice.

478
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,009
He can sign those papers before
I shove them down his throat

479
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:27,896
or after they come out the other end.

480
00:25:28,941 --> 00:25:29,880
Yes.

481
00:25:30,057 --> 00:25:32,865
- I guess someone didn't see
the "no cell phones" sign. - No.

482
00:25:32,866 --> 00:25:35,620
I guess that rule
only applies to plus ones.

483
00:25:36,226 --> 00:25:37,122
I'll talk to you later.

484
00:25:37,123 --> 00:25:40,224
I wanna grab a soak before
the keynote speech. Bye.

485
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:11,101
Oh, Ms. Butler?

486
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:13,200
Huh? Oh, hi.

487
00:26:13,201 --> 00:26:16,376
Yes, I'm her. She's me.
Meg Butler. Meg.

488
00:26:16,499 --> 00:26:18,088
Oh, we have a seat
for you up front.

489
00:26:18,089 --> 00:26:19,696
Oh, uh...

490
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,536
Uh... great.

491
00:26:34,142 --> 00:26:35,569
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.

492
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:38,628
Now to introduce
our keynote speaker--

493
00:26:38,629 --> 00:26:42,218
the president of Amtech,
Ms. Meg Butler.

494
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,089
Come up.

495
00:26:49,446 --> 00:26:50,460
Come on.

496
00:27:07,911 --> 00:27:08,890
Hi.

497
00:27:11,699 --> 00:27:16,016
Those of you who know Meg
know... I'm not Meg.

498
00:27:16,591 --> 00:27:18,941
Nutmeg. That's funny.

499
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:24,709
Uh, anyway... Meg asked me
to introduce Chris Cavanaugh

500
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:28,852
because she knows
what a huge, huge fan I am.

501
00:27:28,853 --> 00:27:32,489
Where are ya,
ya big-brained rascal?

502
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:34,245
Oh, there he is.

503
00:27:34,343 --> 00:27:36,831
Almost as hot
as his author photo.

504
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:39,661
Anyway...

505
00:27:41,122 --> 00:27:45,192
Those of you who haven't read
"Flashpoint," do it immediately.

506
00:27:45,193 --> 00:27:47,618
Put it in your kindle, your iPad.

507
00:27:47,619 --> 00:27:50,430
I don't know. Buy the book.
It will make you smarter,

508
00:27:50,431 --> 00:27:56,366
because what Chris Cavanaugh
has to say about human nature,

509
00:27:56,367 --> 00:27:58,179
about creativity,

510
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:01,327
- is absolutely--
- There she is!

511
00:28:01,328 --> 00:28:05,393
That's the bitch who stole
my lanyard and my clothes!

512
00:28:07,006 --> 00:28:08,937
Ladies and gentlemen,
Chris Cavanaugh.

513
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:22,491
Hi. I called you a bunch of times.

514
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:26,641
- Your phone must be broken.
- It is now. Please respect my privacy.

515
00:28:26,642 --> 00:28:29,458
Paul, you have to let me talk to you.

516
00:28:29,478 --> 00:28:30,325
Why?

517
00:28:30,326 --> 00:28:33,593
Because you're a mess, and
someone has to do something.

518
00:28:34,364 --> 00:28:36,423
And okay, I'm having dreams about us.

519
00:28:37,246 --> 00:28:40,131
Dreams? What kind of dreams?

520
00:28:40,979 --> 00:28:42,232
Regular dreams--

521
00:28:42,233 --> 00:28:44,253
lots of daylight, lots of clothes.

522
00:28:44,811 --> 00:28:47,385
Look, I'm your landlord.
I have a right to come in.

523
00:28:47,871 --> 00:28:49,702
But I'd like you to invite me in.

524
00:28:59,403 --> 00:29:00,930
Getting ready to cook something?

525
00:29:01,441 --> 00:29:03,408
I see onions, potatoes,

526
00:29:03,738 --> 00:29:05,813
this long green and white thing

527
00:29:05,814 --> 00:29:07,516
with scary little hairs on the bottom.

528
00:29:07,517 --> 00:29:09,037
This is food, right?

529
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:10,572
It's called a leek.

530
00:29:10,651 --> 00:29:13,235
I was trying
to make potato leek soup.

531
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:15,678
I love potato leek soup.

532
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:18,388
Of course, that was before
I knew what a leek was.

533
00:29:18,787 --> 00:29:19,904
You want some help?

534
00:29:21,113 --> 00:29:23,356
Come on. Soup I can do.

535
00:29:23,684 --> 00:29:26,630
Making soup? Is that what
we were doing in your dream?

536
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:29,075
No. No, we weren't.

537
00:29:29,971 --> 00:29:32,024
That reminds me.
I need to wash my hands.

538
00:29:37,556 --> 00:29:40,031
Hey. How was the big conference?

539
00:29:42,002 --> 00:29:43,033
Okay.

540
00:29:43,757 --> 00:29:46,309
You meet any guys for me?
I'm not picky.

541
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:47,544
You know what they say.

542
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:50,382
Ugly plus money equals handsome.

543
00:29:50,676 --> 00:29:52,622
Well, apparently,

544
00:29:52,623 --> 00:29:55,769
crazy plus wife equals laughingstock.

545
00:29:56,567 --> 00:29:58,544
Uh, you two having a fight?

546
00:29:59,728 --> 00:30:01,031
Yeah, kinda.

547
00:30:01,085 --> 00:30:03,505
Well, you won't even know I'm here.

548
00:30:06,935 --> 00:30:08,527
Tom, why don't we
finish this later?

549
00:30:08,528 --> 00:30:09,832
Oh, I'm sorry.

550
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:12,228
Do you not wanna be embarrassed
in front of your friend?

551
00:30:12,951 --> 00:30:15,428
Well, she just embarrassed me
in front of the whole fortune 500.

552
00:30:15,429 --> 00:30:17,864
I don't know how many
different ways I can apologize.

553
00:30:17,865 --> 00:30:19,569
At some point,
you're gonna have to let it go.

554
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:22,137
I kinda don't feel like
letting it go, Lynette.

555
00:30:24,486 --> 00:30:26,606
It's not just the fact
that you humiliated me.

556
00:30:26,607 --> 00:30:28,262
It's that after all those years
that I supported you,

557
00:30:28,263 --> 00:30:32,928
took a backseat to your career,
you couldn't do the same for me.

558
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,961
What happened?

559
00:30:46,819 --> 00:30:48,303
It was awful.

560
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:50,887
All weekend,
I was treated like a plus one,

561
00:30:50,888 --> 00:30:52,625
a second class citizen, a--

562
00:30:52,626 --> 00:30:53,838
A wife!

563
00:30:54,543 --> 00:30:57,788
Lynette, in Tom's world,
that's what you are.

564
00:30:58,783 --> 00:31:00,428
You're gonna have
to get used to it.

565
00:31:00,879 --> 00:31:03,140
What if I don't
wanna get used to it?

566
00:31:03,141 --> 00:31:05,323
Well, take it from someone
who spent eight years

567
00:31:05,324 --> 00:31:07,556
being "Mrs. Third Baseman,"

568
00:31:08,253 --> 00:31:10,164
you can be a wife...

569
00:31:10,692 --> 00:31:13,100
Or you can be a first wife.

570
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:18,591
I'm home.

571
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:20,326
Hi, honey. How was your day?

572
00:31:20,791 --> 00:31:22,824
Worked straight through lunch
and I'm starving.

573
00:31:23,146 --> 00:31:24,178
What's this?

574
00:31:24,837 --> 00:31:26,539
It's a pineapple upside-down cake.

575
00:31:26,632 --> 00:31:27,582
Wow.

576
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,538
Reminds me of the cake
your old friend Bree

577
00:31:31,539 --> 00:31:33,288
brought to dinner last month.

578
00:31:35,808 --> 00:31:38,037
Huh. I-I don't remember that.

579
00:31:39,863 --> 00:31:42,480
'Cause obviously Bree
didn't make this one,

580
00:31:42,625 --> 00:31:44,335
since I don't see her anymore

581
00:31:44,336 --> 00:31:46,715
because I know...
how you feel about her.

582
00:31:46,912 --> 00:31:49,118
So... where'd this come from?

583
00:31:49,661 --> 00:31:53,422
I... m-made it.

584
00:31:54,968 --> 00:31:55,934
Really?

585
00:31:56,298 --> 00:31:57,277
Hmm.

586
00:31:57,278 --> 00:31:58,683
The woman who ordered in
Chinese food

587
00:31:58,684 --> 00:32:01,336
for Christmas dinner made
a pineapple upside-down cake.

588
00:32:02,793 --> 00:32:04,747
Well, it's not that hard.

589
00:32:04,806 --> 00:32:08,566
It's just some pineapples and...
upside-down cake.

590
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,306
You know what?

591
00:32:12,793 --> 00:32:15,349
This looks... so good.

592
00:32:15,661 --> 00:32:18,695
I would love for you
to make me one...

593
00:32:19,338 --> 00:32:20,513
just like it.

594
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:21,443
Right now?

595
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:25,218
Yeah, and I'm gonna sit here
and watch you...

596
00:32:26,435 --> 00:32:27,835
every step of the way.

597
00:32:29,049 --> 00:32:31,915
Sure. No problem.

598
00:32:33,094 --> 00:32:34,136
Uh...

599
00:32:35,476 --> 00:32:37,769
First, I'm gonna get some flour,

600
00:32:37,902 --> 00:32:40,806
'cause you can't make a cake
without flour, right?

601
00:32:45,661 --> 00:32:49,103
Oh, no! Got it all over me.

602
00:32:50,057 --> 00:32:52,532
Maybe I should take my top off.

603
00:32:53,755 --> 00:32:55,017
In fact...

604
00:32:55,438 --> 00:32:58,806
why don't you and I go up
to the bedroom and--

605
00:32:58,807 --> 00:32:59,994
Make the cake.

606
00:33:00,914 --> 00:33:02,808
Well, you really are hungry.

607
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,322
Well, let me freshen up first.

608
00:33:10,269 --> 00:33:12,772
He wants you to make
a pineapple upside-down cake--

609
00:33:12,773 --> 00:33:15,350
The woman who ordered in
Chinese for Christmas?

610
00:33:15,351 --> 00:33:19,145
Yes, we've already covered that.
Now what am I gonna do?

611
00:33:19,146 --> 00:33:20,161
If I can't make this,

612
00:33:20,162 --> 00:33:22,169
he's gonna know
I've been seeing you.

613
00:33:22,246 --> 00:33:24,776
Just stall him.
I'll make one and slip it to you.

614
00:33:24,958 --> 00:33:27,075
No, he wants to watch me make it.

615
00:33:27,692 --> 00:33:29,757
Okay, don't panic.
We can do this.

616
00:33:29,977 --> 00:33:30,991
How?

617
00:33:32,962 --> 00:33:34,121
Okay!

618
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:38,977
One pineapple upside-down cake
coming right up.

619
00:33:43,096 --> 00:33:45,520
First, preheat your oven to 300.

620
00:33:45,526 --> 00:33:48,809
First, I'm gonna preheat
my oven to 300.

621
00:33:49,746 --> 00:33:52,219
Then we're gonna start
with the caramel topping.

622
00:33:52,985 --> 00:33:55,367
And then we're gonna start
with the caramel topping...

623
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,272
for which I will need...

624
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,547
sugar.

625
00:34:02,922 --> 00:34:04,780
Brown sugar.

626
00:34:07,375 --> 00:34:09,923
And butter.
How much butter?

627
00:34:10,419 --> 00:34:11,730
Who are you talking to?

628
00:34:12,089 --> 00:34:15,312
Uh... my... grandmother.

629
00:34:15,313 --> 00:34:17,490
See, this was her recipe,
and talking to her

630
00:34:17,491 --> 00:34:19,674
makes me feel like
we're making it together.

631
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:24,261
How much butter, grandma?

632
00:34:25,442 --> 00:34:27,120
Quarter cup. Got it.

633
00:34:32,828 --> 00:34:33,967
And?

634
00:34:34,787 --> 00:34:36,001
It's very good.

635
00:34:36,175 --> 00:34:38,563
It is?
Hot damn.

636
00:34:38,759 --> 00:34:40,887
You know, truthfully,
I was just kinda winging it.

637
00:34:40,888 --> 00:34:42,864
Oh, and if you don't taste the wine,

638
00:34:42,865 --> 00:34:44,054
it's 'cause I drank it.

639
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:47,761
Ahh.

640
00:34:54,268 --> 00:34:57,021
So last time you and I
had a meal together,

641
00:34:58,484 --> 00:35:02,102
had to be...
before Mary Alice died.

642
00:35:02,103 --> 00:35:04,084
That was a long time ago.

643
00:35:06,064 --> 00:35:08,795
Maybe we should start
doing that again.

644
00:35:08,796 --> 00:35:12,376
Susan... why are you doing this?

645
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:13,678
Why do you care?

646
00:35:15,421 --> 00:35:17,004
M.J.! No running.

647
00:35:17,904 --> 00:35:18,973
Ah, leave him alone.

648
00:35:18,974 --> 00:35:21,471
It's nice to see something
moving fast in here.

649
00:35:21,535 --> 00:35:23,413
Thanks. And just to warn you,

650
00:35:23,414 --> 00:35:26,365
we... might be a little late
picking him up.

651
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:27,145
Yeah? Looks like

652
00:35:27,146 --> 00:35:29,475
you're going to be
a little late getting started.

653
00:35:37,674 --> 00:35:40,319
I remember a guy that
used to live on this street.

654
00:35:40,332 --> 00:35:42,071
He taught my daughter to swim.

655
00:35:42,149 --> 00:35:45,057
He made a killer barbecue tri-tip.

656
00:35:45,058 --> 00:35:47,195
He had a laugh you could
hear three houses away.

657
00:35:47,196 --> 00:35:51,059
- I liked that guy.
- I'm not that man anymore.

658
00:35:53,411 --> 00:35:54,956
I think you can be.

659
00:36:02,703 --> 00:36:04,681
Oh, you know, I'll be right back.

660
00:36:08,305 --> 00:36:10,673
What the hell are you doing?
I asked you not to come here.

661
00:36:10,674 --> 00:36:13,141
I know, but Paul is suffering,

662
00:36:13,142 --> 00:36:15,062
and everyone else
has turned their back on him.

663
00:36:15,063 --> 00:36:17,419
You know why?
'Cause he's a bad guy!

664
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,222
Look, you might
have fallen for his act,

665
00:36:19,223 --> 00:36:22,662
but I haven't, and I'm not gonna
let you put yourself in danger.

666
00:36:22,974 --> 00:36:24,300
Get in the car. We're going.

667
00:36:24,301 --> 00:36:25,927
I'm not going anywhere.

668
00:36:26,556 --> 00:36:29,780
Mike, I--believe it or not,
I am not an idiot.

669
00:36:29,781 --> 00:36:32,111
I don't need to be rescued
from whatever trouble it is

670
00:36:32,112 --> 00:36:33,407
you think I'm getting myself into.

671
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:35,048
You don't know this guy like I do.

672
00:36:35,049 --> 00:36:38,469
I know the look in somebody's
eyes when they're hurting,

673
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:41,279
and I'm not leaving until
I know that Paul's okay.

674
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,307
So you're going back in there.

675
00:36:42,308 --> 00:36:46,982
Yeah. Support me or not.
That's what I'm doing.

676
00:36:50,758 --> 00:36:51,808
Ugh!

677
00:37:17,987 --> 00:37:20,591
I heard an oven timer go off.
Let's take a look.

678
00:37:21,331 --> 00:37:23,318
No!
Aah! Not yet!

679
00:37:25,689 --> 00:37:28,565
Secret's all in the cooling,
and in fact, it'll probably

680
00:37:28,566 --> 00:37:30,784
cool faster on the windowsill.

681
00:37:34,735 --> 00:37:35,995
Hi. We're collecting for juvenile--

682
00:37:35,996 --> 00:37:38,727
out of my way!
Hot cake!

683
00:37:40,423 --> 00:37:42,479
Okay, but while we are waiting,

684
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,889
there's just one thing
I have to say.

685
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:49,214
Hey. This is not about a cake.
This is about trust.

686
00:37:49,215 --> 00:37:52,290
It is a sad day when a husband
forces a wife to bake for him

687
00:37:52,291 --> 00:37:54,271
just to prove she's not a liar.

688
00:37:54,514 --> 00:37:56,436
Do you have any idea
how offensive that is?

689
00:37:56,437 --> 00:37:57,566
Cake's ready.

690
00:38:02,318 --> 00:38:08,003
Ahh. There. One perfect
pineapple upside down cake.

691
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:11,929
If only trust were so easy to make.

692
00:38:38,638 --> 00:38:40,179
You look surprised.

693
00:38:42,686 --> 00:38:43,765
I am.

694
00:38:45,027 --> 00:38:46,215
After the way I talked to you,

695
00:38:46,216 --> 00:38:49,426
I was kind of expecting
the firing squad.

696
00:38:49,818 --> 00:38:51,013
I thought about it,

697
00:38:51,571 --> 00:38:54,393
but I decided to go
for the romantic dinner.

698
00:38:54,813 --> 00:38:56,375
Figured, less cleanup.

699
00:38:59,162 --> 00:39:02,539
Honey, I... I understand
how you feel about Paul.

700
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,836
I know you're just
trying to protect me.

701
00:39:05,383 --> 00:39:08,876
And you're just being you--
the woman that makes me

702
00:39:08,877 --> 00:39:10,709
pull over to the side
of the road in a rainstorm

703
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:12,555
to pick up a sick raccoon.

704
00:39:13,896 --> 00:39:16,161
It my defense,
I did think it was a cat.

705
00:39:18,076 --> 00:39:19,249
The point is...

706
00:39:20,803 --> 00:39:22,427
I can't stay mad at you

707
00:39:22,787 --> 00:39:27,381
for being the kind,
compassionate woman you are.

708
00:39:28,929 --> 00:39:31,016
Especially since it's been six weeks

709
00:39:31,017 --> 00:39:32,968
since we've had sex.

710
00:39:34,724 --> 00:39:35,751
That, too.

711
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:45,542
You sure you're okay
watching the girls all weekend?

712
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:48,093
Hey, can't miss your old
modeling friend's funeral.

713
00:39:48,528 --> 00:39:50,578
Yeah. We were really close.

714
00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:51,636
Well, you get to see
some old friends,

715
00:39:51,637 --> 00:39:54,916
- maybe even reconnect with a few.
- Maybe.

716
00:39:57,212 --> 00:40:00,040
Look, I know it's been hard
for you to not see Bree,

717
00:40:00,072 --> 00:40:01,552
but it has meant a lot to me.

718
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:08,061
- Nice coat. Is it new?
- Yeah. I just bought it this week.

719
00:40:13,297 --> 00:40:16,563
So then this long red hair
must have got on it pretty recently.

720
00:40:20,163 --> 00:40:21,774
It's not what you think.

721
00:40:21,775 --> 00:40:24,304
I... took Juanita
to a kid's birthday party,

722
00:40:24,305 --> 00:40:27,361
- and I hugged a clown.
- You hugged a clown?

723
00:40:27,998 --> 00:40:30,313
His monkey died.
He was very emotional.

724
00:40:30,986 --> 00:40:33,265
So you're off to a funeral, huh?

725
00:40:33,411 --> 00:40:34,898
What are you doing?

726
00:40:34,962 --> 00:40:39,215
Don't-- don't open that!
I packed it very carefully!

727
00:40:39,589 --> 00:40:40,815
I can see that.

728
00:40:41,169 --> 00:40:44,169
One, two, three bikinis.

729
00:40:44,367 --> 00:40:46,268
Is your friend being buried at sea?

730
00:40:46,356 --> 00:40:47,659
Stop it. I'm gonna be late.

731
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:50,199
Late for what?
Weekend getaway with Bree?

732
00:40:50,954 --> 00:40:52,689
Damn it, Gaby.
I forbade you to see her.

733
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:54,877
Well, that was your first mistake.
What did you expect?

734
00:40:54,878 --> 00:40:57,186
I expected you to choose me!

735
00:41:00,412 --> 00:41:01,846
You know, ever since
we moved to this street,

736
00:41:01,847 --> 00:41:04,807
and--and you got so tight
with those women,

737
00:41:06,113 --> 00:41:07,834
I always feel like you put them first.

738
00:41:07,835 --> 00:41:09,418
You know that's not true.

739
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,826
Prove it.

740
00:41:13,268 --> 00:41:14,341
Choose.

741
00:41:15,154 --> 00:41:17,617
Who do you want in your life--
me or Bree?

742
00:41:18,443 --> 00:41:19,647
Don't do this.

743
00:41:20,041 --> 00:41:21,463
I am doing it, Gaby.

744
00:41:25,701 --> 00:41:26,728
Choose.

745
00:41:28,797 --> 00:41:31,767
Yes, the residents of Wisteria Lane

746
00:41:31,768 --> 00:41:34,386
are nothing if not loyal,

747
00:41:35,123 --> 00:41:37,498
but there are times
when that loyalty

748
00:41:37,499 --> 00:41:39,464
is put to the test...

749
00:41:41,084 --> 00:41:44,286
By the desire to help
a stricken friend...

750
00:41:47,234 --> 00:41:51,141
By the need to protect
a long-buried secret.

751
00:41:54,414 --> 00:41:58,994
By the movement
of two lives in opposite directions.

752
00:42:02,002 --> 00:42:06,868
And sometimes just as one
test of loyalty ends...

753
00:42:07,944 --> 00:42:09,635
another begins.

754
00:42:09,636 --> 00:42:11,602
Gaby, I thought we said
we'd meet at the spa.

755
00:42:11,603 --> 00:42:15,129
Little change of plans.
Carlos knows.

756
00:42:15,395 --> 00:42:16,539
About us?

757
00:42:16,757 --> 00:42:20,187
Yeah.
Can I stay with you for a while?

758
00:42:20,188 --> 00:42:21,438
Of course.

759
00:42:22,326 --> 00:42:23,459
Thank you.

760
00:42:24,938 --> 00:42:27,051
Girls, come on. Go on in.

761
