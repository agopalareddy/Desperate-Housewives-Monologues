00:00:00,333 --> 00:00:03,126
<i>Previously on
"Desperate Housewives"</i>...

2
00:00:03,127 --> 00:00:04,814
I don't feel well.

3
00:00:04,909 --> 00:00:07,022
Susan's health
took a turn for the worse.

4
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:08,813
Someone call 9-1-1.

5
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,854
You have given me so much, Keith.

6
00:00:11,918 --> 00:00:14,669
One relationship came
to a bittersweet end.

7
00:00:14,696 --> 00:00:18,429
- I know who you are. Get out!
- Forgive me, please.

8
00:00:18,461 --> 00:00:20,911
- Please! I love you.
- No, you don't.

9
00:00:20,959 --> 00:00:23,342
And another ended in betrayal.

10
00:00:29,646 --> 00:00:32,126
The suburbs are full of parents,

11
00:00:32,191 --> 00:00:35,022
and each parent
has their own style.

12
00:00:36,893 --> 00:00:38,417
There's the disciplinarian...

13
00:00:40,797 --> 00:00:42,173
the smotherer...

14
00:00:44,222 --> 00:00:46,029
and the negotiator...

15
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:51,518
But the one thing
they all have in common...

16
00:00:52,158 --> 00:00:54,158
is they love to judge

17
00:00:54,167 --> 00:00:56,398
the parents next door.

18
00:00:59,725 --> 00:01:01,375
Take your sister inside, sweetie.

19
00:01:01,421 --> 00:01:03,853
I need to have
a little chat with Lee.

20
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,183
Hi! I see Jenny's
practicing again.

21
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,112
Two hours a day,
five days a week.

22
00:01:14,192 --> 00:01:17,023
Wow. She is really
into that violin.

23
00:01:17,088 --> 00:01:19,231
Sometimes. Mostly I have
to force her to do it.

24
00:01:19,296 --> 00:01:21,456
Ohh. Big mistake.

25
00:01:22,575 --> 00:01:25,841
Really? Seems like you have
an unsolicited opinion.

26
00:01:26,624 --> 00:01:28,528
Look, I know you're new
to this parenting thing,

27
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:30,433
so I'm gonna tell you
how it works...

28
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,656
You can't force
a kid to do stuff,

29
00:01:32,688 --> 00:01:35,200
'cause then it just leads
to a lot of door slamming

30
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:37,920
and name-calling,
and then the kid gets angry, too.

31
00:01:39,695 --> 00:01:41,536
Well, here's the way
I think it works...

32
00:01:41,557 --> 00:01:43,523
Jenny told us she wants
to play the violin,

33
00:01:43,555 --> 00:01:45,731
so it's my job to make sure
she sticks with it.

34
00:01:46,453 --> 00:01:47,811
By pushing her.

35
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:48,851
I'm not pushing her.

36
00:01:54,099 --> 00:01:56,195
What? She wanted
to learn Mandarin.

37
00:01:56,243 --> 00:01:59,199
Look, I don't mean to devalue
the two and a half weeks

38
00:01:59,231 --> 00:02:02,943
you've had as a father.
I'm simply telling you what works.

39
00:02:03,743 --> 00:02:07,071
So let me ask you...
what's Juanita pursuing on her own?

40
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:08,832
Huh?

41
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:10,703
As you know, the school
talent show is coming up.

42
00:02:10,734 --> 00:02:13,566
Jenny's playing the violin.
What's Juanita going to do?

43
00:02:13,593 --> 00:02:15,535
Well, that's hard to say.

44
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,867
See, the beauty of my method

45
00:02:17,931 --> 00:02:20,771
is that Juanita has explored
so many... things,

46
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:22,835
it's hard to know
which one to showcase.

47
00:02:22,868 --> 00:02:24,530
Well, this should be interesting...

48
00:02:24,562 --> 00:02:26,579
Two different parenting philosophies

49
00:02:26,628 --> 00:02:28,819
and a talent show to prove
which one of us is right...

50
00:02:28,851 --> 00:02:31,203
in front of hundreds of people.

51
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:34,723
Yes. Will it be the overbearing,
hypercritical father...

52
00:02:34,746 --> 00:02:37,796
Or the loving mom
who still looks hot in these sweats?

53
00:02:37,804 --> 00:02:39,075
Game on.

54
00:02:46,531 --> 00:02:49,124
Hey, sweetie, I heard
the talent show's coming up.

55
00:02:49,146 --> 00:02:52,483
- What are you gonna do?
- Oh, it's going to be great. Watch.

56
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:04,467
Yes, each parent
has their own style.

57
00:03:05,314 --> 00:03:06,580
But deep down,

58
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:10,067
they're all afraid
they're doing it wrong.

60
00:03:23,152 --> 00:03:26,257
There are many things
that bring us pleasure...

61
00:03:28,098 --> 00:03:29,889
baking for our friends...

62
00:03:31,376 --> 00:03:33,457
having a good laugh...

63
00:03:34,161 --> 00:03:36,321
donating to charity.

64
00:03:37,168 --> 00:03:40,546
But the things
that bring us pleasure

65
00:03:40,592 --> 00:03:43,249
may not be enough
to give our lives meaning...

66
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:47,345
Without someone to love.

67
00:03:53,058 --> 00:03:56,242
Morning, dear.
Just back from the store.

68
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,844
What the hell?

69
00:03:57,908 --> 00:04:00,516
I thought for dinner I could
make those lamb chops,

70
00:04:00,536 --> 00:04:01,330
you love so much.

71
00:04:01,411 --> 00:04:04,243
I got a great tip from the butcher
on searing the meat first.

72
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:05,843
I kicked you out of this house.

73
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:09,602
Oh, dear.
You're still angry with me.

74
00:04:09,635 --> 00:04:12,659
But you know, Paul,
every couple has their fights.

75
00:04:12,691 --> 00:04:15,059
And I'll admit, ours was a doozy.

76
00:04:15,091 --> 00:04:17,556
That wasn't a fight.
That was the end.

77
00:04:17,603 --> 00:04:20,914
Y... you don't mean that.
You're just upset.

78
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,404
But don't worry.

79
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,459
We will get past this.

80
00:04:26,244 --> 00:04:28,325
Are you out of your mind?

81
00:04:28,357 --> 00:04:30,627
You actually think
I would take you back?

82
00:04:32,452 --> 00:04:34,851
Wait. I get it.

83
00:04:35,653 --> 00:04:38,431
This is another ploy
cooked up by your sick mother.

84
00:04:39,214 --> 00:04:40,975
My mother.

85
00:04:41,664 --> 00:04:42,527
Yes.

86
00:04:42,563 --> 00:04:45,167
She's the one you're mad at.

87
00:04:45,188 --> 00:04:46,639
It's all her fault.

88
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:50,046
She told me you were a monster
who killed aunt Martha.

89
00:04:50,078 --> 00:04:52,976
But then I fell in love with you.

90
00:04:53,024 --> 00:04:54,590
And I realized...

91
00:04:54,638 --> 00:04:57,263
you never could have
done such a thing.

92
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:02,046
It was all a lie.

93
00:05:06,127 --> 00:05:09,311
Oh, Beth. That was no lie.

94
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,077
You don't mean...

95
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,127
My God.

96
00:05:27,191 --> 00:05:29,191
Now we both feel betrayed.

97
00:05:30,023 --> 00:05:31,895
Painful, isn't it?

98
00:05:38,848 --> 00:05:42,367
- You know what this is?
- Uh, a closet?

99
00:05:42,431 --> 00:05:43,999
No. It's a graveyard...

100
00:05:44,031 --> 00:05:46,751
A graveyard filled with
all the stuff we bought

101
00:05:46,773 --> 00:05:48,751
because you told us you wanted
to do something and then quit.

102
00:05:48,783 --> 00:05:52,880
Remember this? Remember how
you begged us to buy you a guitar?

103
00:05:52,911 --> 00:05:54,415
The strings hurt my fingers.

104
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,271
What about this?

105
00:05:58,303 --> 00:06:00,799
Very expensive.
You've never touched it.

106
00:06:00,831 --> 00:06:02,064
That's not true.

107
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:04,463
I use it to pretend
I'm playing guitar.

108
00:06:05,015 --> 00:06:07,638
Juanita, you are full of ideas,

109
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,528
but you never see
any of them through.

110
00:06:09,548 --> 00:06:12,576
Well, guess what? You are doing
one of these things at that talent show.

111
00:06:12,577 --> 00:06:14,163
But I'm already doing something.

112
00:06:14,211 --> 00:06:16,243
Not that.

113
00:06:17,186 --> 00:06:19,170
Fine. If you won't
pick something, I will.

114
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:25,451
Tap.

115
00:06:25,499 --> 00:06:26,972
- No.
- Yes.

116
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,696
You enjoyed it. You actually
set your personal record

117
00:06:29,718 --> 00:06:31,824
for sticking with something...
two months!

118
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,871
But it's hard.

119
00:06:35,655 --> 00:06:37,575
Let me tell you
something about life...

120
00:06:37,623 --> 00:06:39,721
Anything that's
worth doing is hard.

121
00:06:39,751 --> 00:06:43,431
- That's what life is?
- You're going back to that tap class,

122
00:06:43,456 --> 00:06:45,080
and you're gonna practice
two hours a day,

123
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:46,614
seven days a week
until you nail it.

124
00:06:46,643 --> 00:06:48,406
No, I'll do something else
at the show.

125
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,471
- Like what?
- I'll tell jokes.

126
00:06:50,502 --> 00:06:53,725
A Jewish guy and
a Mexican walk into a bar...

127
00:06:53,756 --> 00:06:54,605
No.

128
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,599
Thank you, Bree.

129
00:07:00,631 --> 00:07:03,352
It always brightens my day
when you invite me to visit.

130
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,507
Well, reverend Sykes,
I very much enjoy your company.

131
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:08,284
As I do yours.

132
00:07:11,191 --> 00:07:14,375
So... have you killed someone?

133
00:07:15,142 --> 00:07:16,999
Excuse me?

134
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:19,383
I've always found the treats
you prepare for my visits

135
00:07:19,431 --> 00:07:22,934
are a reliable indicator
of your level of spiritual turmoil.

136
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:25,338
The more exquisite
the baked goods,

137
00:07:25,366 --> 00:07:27,546
the more anguished
your soul. This...

138
00:07:27,594 --> 00:07:32,107
Is a hazelnut chocolate
chip scone with currants.

139
00:07:32,891 --> 00:07:35,467
So I ask again...
have you killed someone?

140
00:07:35,515 --> 00:07:37,755
No. It's just...

141
00:07:38,794 --> 00:07:40,411
lately I feel like Job.

142
00:07:41,851 --> 00:07:43,779
You know, Job,
from the Old Testament?

143
00:07:43,821 --> 00:07:45,828
I'm familiar with the book,
thank you.

144
00:07:47,316 --> 00:07:48,932
Why do you think you're Job?

145
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:57,923
I just feel that God
has taken everything away from me.

146
00:07:57,971 --> 00:08:01,251
I lost my business,
my children never call me,

147
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:05,987
and... my boyfriend
Keith has left me.

148
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:09,907
Well, it's not exactly
body boils and dead camels,

149
00:08:09,946 --> 00:08:12,051
but I understand what you're saying.

150
00:08:13,539 --> 00:08:15,172
When I complained

151
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:18,147
after I was not accepted
into Yale divinity school,

152
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,100
my father had no sympathy.

153
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:24,163
Instead, he drove me
from our lovely home in Connecticut

154
00:08:24,184 --> 00:08:26,335
to a dangerous section of the Bronx

155
00:08:26,356 --> 00:08:29,039
and forced me to hand out
blankets to the homeless.

156
00:08:29,061 --> 00:08:30,993
I see. That's the reason
you've always been

157
00:08:31,024 --> 00:08:33,712
- so sensitive to the plight of the poor.
- Perhaps.

158
00:08:34,483 --> 00:08:36,468
It's certainly the reason
my father was buried

159
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:38,181
in a sport jacket he detested.

160
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:41,188
The point is, looking at
what has been taken from us

161
00:08:41,209 --> 00:08:43,174
is a bad way to go through life.

162
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,203
Looking for what we can give
to others is far better.

163
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,567
Could you pass me the tape?

164
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:58,856
I'm so glad I asked you to help.

165
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:01,799
I'm sorry. I'm feeling a little faint.

166
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,302
What is that smell?

167
00:09:03,324 --> 00:09:06,135
It's like sneakers
mixed with cologne

168
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:10,129
mixed with "I ran around the block four
times wearing a shirt made of cheese."

169
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:11,977
That's Porter and Preston.

170
00:09:12,025 --> 00:09:14,248
Well, get the place cleaned.

171
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,913
Yeah. I think I'm gonna
hold off on that for a while.

172
00:09:17,935 --> 00:09:19,272
Why?

173
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,505
Because...

174
00:09:21,672 --> 00:09:23,768
I kind of love this smell.

175
00:09:24,632 --> 00:09:27,320
Okay, now you're
becoming delirious.

176
00:09:27,341 --> 00:09:28,984
We've gotta get you out of here.

177
00:09:29,016 --> 00:09:31,997
Hey, you don't have children,

178
00:09:32,025 --> 00:09:34,408
so you don't get it.

179
00:09:35,384 --> 00:09:38,600
But raising kids is
an amazing experience.

180
00:09:38,632 --> 00:09:42,231
It is the most meaningful
thing I've ever done.

181
00:09:42,263 --> 00:09:46,840
So anything that reminds me
of them is a good thing.

182
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,444
You must be pretty sad
they're gone.

183
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:53,419
No.

184
00:09:54,348 --> 00:09:55,884
No, it's right.

185
00:09:55,931 --> 00:09:58,476
They're moving on
with their lives.

186
00:09:59,227 --> 00:10:00,610
It's wonderful.

187
00:10:02,851 --> 00:10:05,635
Then why are there
tears in your eyes?

188
00:10:07,331 --> 00:10:10,035
Um... that's the smell.

189
00:10:10,099 --> 00:10:11,699
You're right.
Let's get outta here.

190
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:24,467
So... any idea
what's going on with me?

191
00:10:25,059 --> 00:10:27,923
As much as I enjoy
passing out at restaurants,

192
00:10:27,943 --> 00:10:29,683
I'm starting to get
a little concerned.

193
00:10:31,283 --> 00:10:34,503
According to these tests,
your creatine levels are increasing.

194
00:10:34,526 --> 00:10:37,558
- That's not good.
- Oh. Why is that happening?

195
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:40,264
I realize this isn't
a satisfying answer, but...

196
00:10:40,328 --> 00:10:41,816
we don't know.

197
00:10:42,455 --> 00:10:43,686
So, uh...

198
00:10:43,734 --> 00:10:45,995
how serious is it?

199
00:10:47,835 --> 00:10:50,474
I'll tell you what I tell
all my patients...

200
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,169
We are going to do everything
we can to get you a kidney.

201
00:10:54,217 --> 00:10:56,888
But in the meantime,
live your life.

202
00:10:56,937 --> 00:10:59,305
If there's things
you're thinking about doing...

203
00:11:00,712 --> 00:11:01,704
do them now.

204
00:11:17,306 --> 00:11:19,864
I think for our anniversary
we should have a picnic...

205
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:21,288
in the woods...

206
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,232
where we got married.

207
00:11:25,016 --> 00:11:26,249
Sure.

208
00:11:27,006 --> 00:11:28,296
That's a great idea.

209
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,240
I think we should do it now.

210
00:11:32,104 --> 00:11:34,712
But our anniversary's
not till July.

211
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:40,121
Were we not at the same
appointment just now?

212
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:58,442
I thought that dialysis
was supposed to keep you healthy.

213
00:11:58,491 --> 00:12:00,939
I guess it's just
not working for me.

214
00:12:00,972 --> 00:12:03,707
- How bad is this?
- Pretty bad.

215
00:12:03,727 --> 00:12:05,403
Yesterday, the doctor's secretary

216
00:12:05,412 --> 00:12:09,946
handed me this free parking pass
with this... sad look.

217
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,434
It was like,

218
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:15,355
"yeah, you're doomed,
but your parking's free."

219
00:12:15,378 --> 00:12:19,099
- So is this pass good for a month? A week?
- Gaby!

220
00:12:19,115 --> 00:12:20,629
I just wanna know
what we're facing here.

221
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:24,117
All I know is...
I need a new kidney,

222
00:12:24,165 --> 00:12:26,933
and there's nothing I can do
till they find me one.

223
00:12:26,981 --> 00:12:29,940
Well, have you thought about
trying to find a donor yourself?

224
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:31,852
So far, you've only asked family.

225
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:34,619
Yeah, widen the circle.
Ask friends and neighbors.

226
00:12:34,651 --> 00:12:36,187
Well, there's not much point.

227
00:12:36,219 --> 00:12:39,547
I mean, finding a match
is like 1 in 1,000.

228
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:41,114
So ask a thousand people.

229
00:12:41,162 --> 00:12:42,584
Yes. We can help.

230
00:12:42,615 --> 00:12:46,199
We can canvass the neighborhood,
put up signs, go door to door.

231
00:12:46,221 --> 00:12:48,390
Guys, it's a vital organ.

232
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:52,677
Susan, people care about you.

233
00:12:52,726 --> 00:12:55,174
You might be surprised
what they're willing to do.

234
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:57,990
I appreciate the thought,

235
00:12:59,465 --> 00:13:01,353
but I just can't ask anyone

236
00:13:01,385 --> 00:13:03,818
to make that kind
of sacrifice for me.

237
00:13:05,881 --> 00:13:07,576
I can't.

238
00:13:08,472 --> 00:13:10,632
I'm gonna get you more coffee.

239
00:13:16,776 --> 00:13:18,393
Maybe she can't.

240
00:13:20,407 --> 00:13:21,929
But I can.

241
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,427
Donate a kidney?

242
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:28,523
Have we met? I'm like 112.

243
00:13:28,555 --> 00:13:30,812
But, Karen, it's for
our dear friend Susan.

244
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,940
I'm not having elective surgery.

245
00:13:32,987 --> 00:13:35,659
I take enough risk
just climbing out of the tub.

246
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,727
I don't know.
Aren't there serious risks?

247
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,551
Actually, the mortality
rate is quite low.

248
00:13:41,599 --> 00:13:42,595
I meant the scarring.

249
00:13:42,627 --> 00:13:44,179
I've spent a lot of time
at the gym working off

250
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:47,254
my love handles, and I will not
give up a chance to go shirtless.

251
00:13:47,935 --> 00:13:49,136
- No.
- But I...

252
00:13:49,184 --> 00:13:50,288
- No.
- She's really...

253
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,744
- No.
- Would you ju...

254
00:13:51,766 --> 00:13:52,688
No.

255
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,046
Bree...

256
00:13:57,895 --> 00:13:58,875
Yes?

257
00:13:58,955 --> 00:14:00,138
No.

258
00:14:08,796 --> 00:14:10,001
I want a baby.

259
00:14:10,651 --> 00:14:13,019
Here.
I also have a 9-year-old.

260
00:14:13,803 --> 00:14:15,098
One of my own.

261
00:14:15,835 --> 00:14:17,419
Preferably a boy...

262
00:14:17,467 --> 00:14:19,107
and in brown.

263
00:14:19,763 --> 00:14:21,650
Wait.
You're serious?

264
00:14:21,682 --> 00:14:23,591
Where did you get
this incredibly rash

265
00:14:23,671 --> 00:14:26,023
- and not-thought-out idea?
- From you.

266
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,928
You know what you said yesterday

267
00:14:27,961 --> 00:14:31,625
about kids giving your life
meaning? I want that.

268
00:14:31,657 --> 00:14:33,674
I want... meaning.

269
00:14:33,704 --> 00:14:36,505
- In the form of a baby?
- Mm.

270
00:14:36,553 --> 00:14:38,136
Exactly.

271
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:41,232
I already made an appointment
with an adoption agency,

272
00:14:41,263 --> 00:14:43,328
which was right next door
to my manicurist.

273
00:14:43,345 --> 00:14:45,663
It was like it was meant to be.

274
00:14:46,171 --> 00:14:47,692
Are you sure about this?

275
00:14:47,741 --> 00:14:50,780
I mean, your social calendar
is very full.

276
00:14:50,811 --> 00:14:53,099
A baby would change all that.

277
00:14:53,131 --> 00:14:56,020
It requires a lot of sacrifice
and compromise.

278
00:14:56,042 --> 00:14:57,829
Maybe the way you do it.

279
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:00,164
Excuse me?

280
00:15:00,212 --> 00:15:02,500
You work your life
around your kids.

281
00:15:02,522 --> 00:15:05,412
I intend to work
my child into my life.

282
00:15:05,854 --> 00:15:08,467
No offense, but I think

283
00:15:08,515 --> 00:15:10,420
you make it a lot harder
than it has to be.

284
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,887
You know what?

285
00:15:16,287 --> 00:15:18,959
You might be right.

286
00:15:19,023 --> 00:15:22,495
But before you commit
to being a mom,

287
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:23,918
why don't you give it
a test drive?

288
00:15:24,911 --> 00:15:25,759
What do you mean?

289
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:27,664
You could watch Paige some night.

290
00:15:27,695 --> 00:15:29,247
Tom and I haven't
been out in a while.

291
00:15:29,277 --> 00:15:31,150
Really? You'd let me babysit?

292
00:15:31,172 --> 00:15:31,859
Yeah!

293
00:15:32,692 --> 00:15:34,062
Which one is Paige?

294
00:15:34,095 --> 00:15:35,455
This one.

295
00:15:37,615 --> 00:15:40,750
I accept. Wow.

296
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,767
My first step toward being a mom.

297
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:47,779
Oh, you watch.
I am gonna be a natural.

298
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:52,355
Oh, uh, does she eat shellfish?

299
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:54,514
Maybe.

300
00:15:57,011 --> 00:15:58,951
So I got us caviar,

301
00:15:58,998 --> 00:16:01,468
shrimp pâte, smoked salmon.

302
00:16:01,515 --> 00:16:03,834
If there's a part of a fish
they can overcharge for,

303
00:16:03,866 --> 00:16:04,986
we have it.

304
00:16:05,915 --> 00:16:08,315
Can you put these in the back?
Thanks.

305
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:14,110
- Sweetie?
- Yeah?

306
00:16:14,156 --> 00:16:17,436
- I just want to thank you for doing
this today. - You're welcome.

307
00:16:17,469 --> 00:16:19,741
And you can thank me again
when we go back in July

308
00:16:19,764 --> 00:16:21,116
for our real anniversary.

309
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,893
And I'd really love if,
for the next eight hours,

310
00:16:24,944 --> 00:16:27,292
I'm not sick.
No talk of kidneys.

311
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,593
Let's just have a fun,
normal day, okay?

312
00:16:32,376 --> 00:16:33,576
You got it.

313
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:40,903
One fun, normal day
in the woods, coming up.

314
00:16:46,841 --> 00:16:49,032
Nothing's gonna ruin this trip.

315
00:16:58,314 --> 00:17:00,563
Hey. How was tap class?

316
00:17:00,627 --> 00:17:03,330
It's too hard.
I don't wanna do it anymore.

317
00:17:04,034 --> 00:17:06,484
Oh, sweetie...

318
00:17:07,395 --> 00:17:09,763
You're doing it.
We're not a family of quitters.

319
00:17:10,336 --> 00:17:12,379
Ugh! You quit all the time.

320
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:14,619
Yesterday we played
hide-and-seek.

321
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,468
Celia and I looked
for you for an hour

322
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,292
before we saw your car was gone.

323
00:17:19,012 --> 00:17:20,932
So I found a great hiding place
at the shoe store.

324
00:17:20,964 --> 00:17:22,180
It's not quitting.

325
00:17:23,747 --> 00:17:25,395
All right, look,
let me ask you something...

326
00:17:26,275 --> 00:17:28,323
Are you getting better?

327
00:17:28,355 --> 00:17:30,242
- I guess.
- Well, there you go.

328
00:17:30,265 --> 00:17:31,909
Now go upstairs and change.

329
00:17:32,453 --> 00:17:35,605
Oh, and remember,
tomorrow's lesson's two hours.

330
00:17:35,636 --> 00:17:38,516
You're gonna make
my feet fall off.

331
00:17:38,548 --> 00:17:40,709
I can't wait for this to be over.

332
00:17:43,269 --> 00:17:46,431
Why are you working her so hard?
It's a lousy school talent show.

333
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:49,003
You think Bob and Lee
are going easy on their kid?

334
00:17:49,051 --> 00:17:51,980
No! They push her.
That girl's so good at the violin,

335
00:17:52,002 --> 00:17:53,302
she's practically Asian.

336
00:17:53,334 --> 00:17:56,359
So that's what this is about.
You're competing with Bob and Lee.

337
00:17:56,391 --> 00:17:59,628
Pfft. That's ridiculous.
This is about Juanita.

338
00:18:00,109 --> 00:18:03,180
I'm building her self-esteem
and giving her a chance to shine.

339
00:18:04,109 --> 00:18:05,740
And if a couple of
same-sex parents

340
00:18:05,787 --> 00:18:09,004
end up crying at home
in their silk kimonos, so be it.

341
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:16,258
Oh, Mike, look at this place.

342
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:19,218
Isn't it as beautiful
as you remember it?

343
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,393
Yeah. Lucky I didn't leave it
on the roof of the car.

344
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,041
Ugh. Will you forget
about the picnic basket?

345
00:18:26,937 --> 00:18:28,456
I guess you're right.

346
00:18:29,177 --> 00:18:31,817
What's important is we're together.

347
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:33,193
And there's no...

348
00:18:33,225 --> 00:18:35,913
Damn it! They forgot the fries!
Unbelievable.

349
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,254
Okay, Mike, look at me.

350
00:18:40,087 --> 00:18:42,488
Think back eight years,

351
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,422
when we stood in this spot

352
00:18:44,455 --> 00:18:46,807
and we pledged
our love to each other.

353
00:18:47,721 --> 00:18:49,193
Oh! I know.

354
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,401
Let's renew our vows.

355
00:18:52,345 --> 00:18:54,185
That's a great idea.

356
00:18:55,098 --> 00:18:57,561
I, Mike Delfino,

357
00:18:58,376 --> 00:18:59,673
promise to love...

358
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:06,089
I, Mike Delfino, promise to...

359
00:19:08,536 --> 00:19:10,969
It's just a bird. Forget it.

360
00:19:12,121 --> 00:19:14,857
Promise to love and honor...

361
00:19:14,889 --> 00:19:17,220
Okay.
Now he's just mocking me.

362
00:19:19,749 --> 00:19:20,826
Mike!

363
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:22,763
Mike, stop!

364
00:19:27,829 --> 00:19:28,996
Oh, my God.

365
00:19:29,027 --> 00:19:31,779
I... I can't believe
you hit that bird.

366
00:19:31,828 --> 00:19:32,980
Yeah, I know.

367
00:19:34,068 --> 00:19:35,604
I was aiming for that one.

368
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:44,465
As the gayest person
at this brunch,

369
00:19:44,466 --> 00:19:47,492
I feel it is my duty
to say... "fabulous."

370
00:19:47,493 --> 00:19:48,627
- Yeah, Bree, what's the occasion?
- Oh,

371
00:19:48,675 --> 00:19:51,315
nothing, just a little
get-together for friends.

372
00:19:51,363 --> 00:19:53,587
- Smoked salmon tartare cornucopia?
- Mmm.

373
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,699
This feels weird.
She's up to somethin'.

374
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:02,116
Oh, what are you talking about?
It's just a brunch.

375
00:20:03,011 --> 00:20:06,434
Excuse me. If I could borrow
a moment of your time

376
00:20:06,444 --> 00:20:07,987
for a brief presentation.

377
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:10,316
- Oh, God, you're right. It's an ambush.
- Mm-hmm.

378
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,209
It seems many of you
have some misguided ideas

379
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:17,259
about kidney donation,
so I have invited Craig Lynwood,

380
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,389
transplant coordinator
at Fairview Memorial

381
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,680
to dispel some of those myths.

382
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:25,339
Mr. Lynwood, is it true
there's an age limit to donating?

383
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,980
No, not necessarily.

384
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:32,950
And does the surgery
cause unsightly scarring?

385
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,080
It's laparoscopic.
The scarring is minimal.

386
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,919
Well, I don't know
about the rest of you,

387
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,320
but I find that very reassuring.

388
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,669
So now that we have the facts,

389
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:46,190
I am sure you'll all
want to get tested.

390
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:50,309
- Okay, fine. I'll go in next week.
- No need.

391
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,780
Nurse Dearborn?

392
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,700
So the line forms over here.

393
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,440
And we won't take no
for an answer.

394
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,469
You're gonna get tested?

395
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:09,220
No. I think I can take Gaby.

396
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:14,819
I don't know how Paul
found out, mama, but he did.

397
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,410
And then... well...

398
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,330
he threw me out.

399
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:24,629
He was just... so cold.

400
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,330
What a sad story.

401
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:30,239
If only someone had warned you
what a bastard he is.

402
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,059
I know. You were right all along.

403
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,660
I should have listened to you.

404
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:37,920
But I'm going to make it up to you.

405
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:40,100
Oh, Beth.

406
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:43,089
I can't allow you
back in my life.

407
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:46,340
You have failed me
in every possible way.

408
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,540
No. I didn't.

409
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:50,710
Paul confessed.

410
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,180
Really?

411
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:54,300
Did you get it on tape?

412
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,880
Did he write it on a napkin?

413
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,730
Of course not.

414
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:05,469
Because you have never
done anything right

415
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:07,170
in your life.

416
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,289
Give me another chance.
I'll do anything.

417
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:14,029
I have no more use for you.
Good-bye.

418
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,160
Wait!

419
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,960
I have nowhere to go.

420
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,560
What's going to happen to me, mama?

421
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:28,309
You're going to live
a lonely, depressing life

422
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:31,379
in some ratty apartment
with plenty of time to think

423
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,090
about all the people
you disappointed...

424
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:36,780
most of all... me.

425
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,560
Guard, I'm done here.

426
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,060
Take her off the visitor's list.

427
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,509
The Oakridge School talent show

428
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:58,910
will start in five minutes.

429
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:07,889
So... checking out Fairview's
answer to Itzhak Perlman?

430
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:08,839
I don't know what that is,

431
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,460
but if it's German for
"cat strangler," then yes.

432
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:13,650
It's like that, is it?

433
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,419
So when's your daughter
start stomping off to Buffalo?

434
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,639
She's on right before Jenny.
So you might want to keep

435
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,500
your sunglasses handy, because
Juanita is going to be dazzling.

436
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,469
Honey! Are you okay?
Were you being chased by a bee?

437
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:46,939
No, it's my routine.

438
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:49,820
That's the first time
I've nailed the finale.

439
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,769
Oh, that... that was you nailing it?

440
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:54,950
To the floor. Bam!

441
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,580
Performers to the stage.

442
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,130
Well, uh...

443
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,889
Where are my tap shoes?

444
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:23,110
I don't know.

445
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:26,670
I left them right here.

446
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,089
Oh, honey. I guess you lost 'em,
and the show's about to start.

447
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:39,219
Dang it!

448
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:43,229
I can't believe this.
I was so excited. I worked so hard.

449
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:47,259
I'm sorry. You want to stay
and watch your friends?

450
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,230
We can go after for ice cream.

451
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,890
Who cares?

452
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,809
I will see your shirt

453
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:03,890
and I will raise you one bra.

454
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,900
Nicely played.

455
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,249
Do you hear something?

456
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,769
Hmm. Probably just
a peeping raccoon.

457
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:14,770
Oh.

458
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:21,450
No. No, I think
there's someone out there.

459
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,969
This way! There they are!

460
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:27,670
- What the hell?
- I got him!

461
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,179
Identify yourselves.

462
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,209
Are you northern agitators?

463
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:40,529
Do we look like
northern agitators?

464
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:43,890
W... we're just
celebrating our anniversary.

465
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:45,120
You guys...

466
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,539
playing paintball or something?

467
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,809
No, madam, we are not playing.

468
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:52,809
I am Major General Jedediah Garrett

469
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:53,989
of the Confederate Army, and we are...

470
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,649
Kevin... Kevin... Kevin.
Hi. Hi.

471
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:57,379
Uh, we're part of a
civil war reenactment group.

472
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:00,139
Yeah, I know, I know.
Get a real life, right?

473
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:03,159
Can't you guys just have
your pretend war over there?

474
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,400
Pretend?

475
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:08,399
You, sir, are interrupting
the Battle of Fredericksburg.

476
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,900
Actually, we have
the entire park until 6:00.

477
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,970
Kyle, show 'em the permit.

478
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:16,879
I... i... it's fine.
We believe you.

479
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,929
No, it's not fine.
This is really important to her.

480
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:21,609
Just give us a couple hours.

481
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:26,679
No, sir. Now begone!
Men, we must be ready to attack

482
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,229
the enemy should they attempt
to retreat into Maryland.

483
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,580
What a douche.

484
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,009
A douche, you say?

485
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:34,050
Yeah.

486
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,670
Mike! Let's just go.

487
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:45,039
Eyes closed, Kyle.
You're supposed to be dead.

488
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,690
I died with my eyes open.
It happens.

489
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,910
Close 'em, Kyle.

490
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:08,379
And now to close our show

491
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:13,090
is a violin solo
by Jenny Hunter-McDermott.

492
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,269
She lives next door to me.

493
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:53,630
We're getting those
double-paned windows.

494
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,390
Okay.

495
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,479
Ouch!

496
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,110
Poor Lee. He must be
pretty embarrassed.

497
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:12,010
Does he look embarrassed?

498
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,629
She always stumbles over that part.

499
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:18,970
She really stumbled over it today.

500
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,520
But she powered through it.
We couldn't be prouder.

501
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,569
Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
Nobody move!

502
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:47,719
Okay, don't leave yet.

503
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,620
There's still, uh, one girl
who hasn't performed yet.

504
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:52,429
But I lost my tap shoes.

505
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:55,869
Oh, that's right.
Oh... oh, hey! Wait!

506
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:58,800
Is that them in the back room,
behind the radiator?

507
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:24,480
Aah!

508
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,220
Whoo! Bravo!

509
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:37,070
Oh, look, we had a great day.

510
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,980
Think of it this way...

511
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,040
now we have a funny story
to tell people.

512
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,400
Two funny stories?

513
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:00,879
Hello?

514
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,109
Bree, it's Craig Lynwood.

515
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:05,600
I have some great news.
All your efforts have paid off.

516
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,489
You found a match?

517
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:09,850
We found two.

518
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,119
Oh, my God.

519
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,430
It's a miracle.
Who are they?

520
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,260
Well, one of them is you.

521
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:20,540
Bree? Are you there?

522
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,580
I'm sorry. It's just, uh...

523
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:27,510
I... I wasn't expecting this. Um...

524
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,710
Who's the other one?

525
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,090
Woman named Beth Young.

526
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,279
Beth? I didn't even
know she got tested.

527
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,030
- Apparently she saw one of your flyers.
- And she wants to do this?

528
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:40,439
Well, I don't know yet.

529
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,680
We're having a hard time
getting in touch with her.

530
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:47,229
So... should we continue
to look for this Beth Young,

531
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:49,520
or is the donor going to be you?

532
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,689
Fancy. I thought we were
just gonna grab a burger.

533
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,439
Renee was really
talking this place up,

534
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,129
so I thought we could splurge.

535
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:04,360
Or we could stay home
and eat money.

536
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,839
We better order. Any second,
my phone is going to ring,

537
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,860
and Renee is gonna beg me
to rush home and get Paige.

538
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,490
I don't know.
She might surprise you.

539
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:20,060
Oh, great.

540
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:22,979
One night out and
we have to listen to that.

541
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,290
Who brings a baby
to a place like this?

542
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:29,029
Hey. Let's give the parents
that dirty look that we always get,

543
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,379
like, "huh."

544
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,360
Yeah.

545
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,870
Oh, my God.

546
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,299
It's Renee...

547
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,210
on a date...

548
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:45,720
with our baby.

549
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:48,020
Unbelievable.

550
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:50,620
And you thought
she'd be good at this?

551
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:52,729
Ohh, look at that.

552
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:54,249
What? What is she doing now?

553
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:57,910
Nothing. The filet mignon
just went by. It looks amazing.

554
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:01,939
S... so should we just
go over and get Paige?

555
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,300
Not yet.

556
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:05,000
I want to watch.

557
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,229
Look, look, there you go.

558
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:12,140
She's probably ordering
milk for Paige.

559
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:18,950
Or she's giving our baby away.

560
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:24,159
Wow. She really is bad at this.

561
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,290
Ugh!

562
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,010
Excuse me.

563
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:32,389
Oh, hi. I'll be right over
to take your order.

564
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:34,969
Why did that woman
give you this baby?

565
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:38,340
She gave me $100 to see
if I could calm her down...

566
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,160
But I don't mind.

567
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,229
I love children.
I'm actually expecting my third.

568
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:44,549
Really? That's beautiful.

569
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:46,950
Listen, how would you like to make...

570
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,000
$200?

571
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:53,080
Are you ready to order?

572
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:56,149
Uh... have you
forgotten something?

573
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:57,959
Oh, your drinks will be right out.

574
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,580
No, no. Not the drinks.
The baby.

575
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:04,339
I gave you a baby.
Where is it?

576
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:07,619
Oh, I had orders backing up,
so I gave it to a busboy.

577
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,389
What? What busboy?

578
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:12,460
Um... he should be
here somewhere.

579
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:15,370
Oh, I hope he didn't finish
his shift and go home.

580
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,110
You better find me that baby.

581
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:23,280
Or I'm gonna take that one now!

582
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:29,490
Uh, hey, busboy.
Are you the one that has a baby?

583
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:34,179
I'm looking for a baby...
2 feet tall, big head, drools.

584
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,549
I'm looking for... a baby.

585
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:39,859
Um... did anyone pass you a baby?

586
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,980
Has anyone seen a baby?!

587
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,580
- Had enough?
- In a minute.

588
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,180
That vein in her head
is really going.

589
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:50,289
Do you know
where there's a baby?

590
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:53,890
Because they gave it to me.
I don't know where the baby is!

591
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,210
Lynette...

592
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,879
and Paige. 
How... did you get Paige?

593
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,479
What are you doing with Paige?

594
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,400
You took our baby on a date.

595
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:10,009
Well... Brian called.
It was his one night in town.

596
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:13,559
Well, then you say,
"sorry, Brian, I can't make it tonight."

597
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,969
That's what being
a mother is about...

598
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:20,030
making sacrifices, something
you know absolutely nothing about.

599
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:23,050
Ugh! Come on, Tom.

600
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:33,540
Beth? It's Bree Van De Kamp.

601
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:35,170
Um...

602
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,640
coming.

603
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,470
I, uh, went to your house.
Paul told me you were here.

604
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,390
We aren't together anymore.

605
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:51,560
I'm so sorry.

606
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:55,570
It is what it is.

607
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,330
Thanks...

608
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:02,569
for checking on me.

609
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:04,710
Well, actually,
the reason I came by...

610
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:08,019
has the gentleman
from the transplant office

611
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,420
reached you?

612
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,920
Why?

613
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,910
Am I a match?

614
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,250
Yes.

615
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:17,520
Wow.

616
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,679
So... what do I do now?

617
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,849
Is there someone I need to call?
Are there forms?

618
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:26,850
Well, that won't be necessary,
because I'm a match, too.

619
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:29,639
What?

620
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,419
I know.

621
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,650
Two in the same neighborhood.
We're very blessed.

622
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,669
Anyway, I, uh,
am going to be Susan's donor,

623
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:39,090
but I wanted to thank you for...

624
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,920
getting tested.

625
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:50,560
When you moved onto the Lane,
I didn't give you a chance.

626
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:55,099
I saw you as a woman
who married a man I hated,

627
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:58,820
and I see now that you're
so much more than that.

628
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:03,120
I'm sorry it took me
so long to realize it.

629
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,750
Well, I...

630
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,580
I should go.

631
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,230
I want to do it.

632
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,049
Beth, no...

633
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:15,950
Please, Bree.

634
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,120
Let me help Susan.

635
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:22,520
It would really mean a lot to me.

636
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:27,299
Beth, what I'm about to say
may not make sense to you,

637
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,650
but, um...

638
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:32,110
I've been going through, uh...

639
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:37,489
a dark time...
feeling alone and unconnected

640
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:40,269
and wondering if I have a purpose,

641
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:43,280
so for me to be able
to do this for my friend...

642
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,730
It may mean a lot to you...

643
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,260
but it means everything to me.

644
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,920
Thank you for understanding.

645
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,610
Sorry about last night.

646
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,240
I bought this for the baby.

647
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:31,770
Wow.

648
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:36,420
Expensive, fragile, pointy...

649
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,410
if only it were flammable.

650
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:43,020
I'm not really cut out
to be a mother, am I?

651
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:45,099
No.

652
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,359
And there's nothing wrong with that.

653
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,790
It's not for everyone.

654
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:53,370
What's sad is how many people
go ahead and have kids anyway.

655
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:57,470
Well, what do people do
to fill up the hole in their lives?

656
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,600
No matter what I do,
no matter who I'm with, I...

657
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:02,739
I feel alone.

658
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,049
You'll find something,

659
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:06,570
and when you do,
you'll be glad you have the room.

660
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,130
Lots and lots of room.

661
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,820
Thanks. Mm.
I'm so glad I stopped by.

662
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:17,980
Hey.

663
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:21,060
We're about to eat.
Why don't you join us?

664
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:23,600
Okay.

665
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,710
Okay.

666
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,170
But keep the baby
on your side of the table.

667
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:32,080
What? I'll probably
let her play with my knife.

668
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:42,980
Ow! Son of a bitch!

669
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,719
Let me look at it.

670
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,790
No.

671
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,550
You okay?

672
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:58,539
Mike, are you okay?

673
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:01,289
No, I'm not okay.
We never should have come here.

674
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:03,159
Instead of waiting
for our real anniversary,

675
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,810
we wasted our time
on this disaster.

676
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,670
Is that why you are yelling at me?
'Cause I...

677
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:12,010
'cause I moved up our anniversary?

678
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:13,880
Because you're dying.

679
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,280
You're dying,

680
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:21,230
and there's not a damn thing
I can do about it.

681
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:23,190
Look, I'm sorry, but it...

682
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:26,020
it feels like you're getting ready
to say good-bye...

683
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,980
like you're bailing on me.

684
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:30,490
Bailing?

685
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:33,750
I am fighting.

686
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:38,059
I... I am scared,
I don't know what's gonna happen,

687
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:40,730
but I am fighting my ass off.

688
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:45,040
I want to see M.J. graduate.

689
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:50,140
I want to grow old with you.

690
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,690
I want all of that.

691
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,060
But in the meantime, I...

692
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:03,400
I am gonna enjoy every...

693
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:06,030
every moment of every day.

694
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,070
Let's get outta here.

695
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:29,310
Hey. Lean on me.

696
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,570
I'm a lot stronger
than you think.

697
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,090
Our lives are brief.

698
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:42,840
That's why it's important
to search for meaning.

699
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:47,830
We find it in
our daughter's smile...

700
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:52,740
in the warmth of our friends...

701
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,650
or the comfort of our faith.

702
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,150
Okay, coming through.

703
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:05,420
Then there are those
who make their lives meaningful

704
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:09,180
by making a great sacrifice.

705
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:14,210
Hello. My name is Beth Young.
I'm here to donate a kidney.

706
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:17,000
I just found out I'm a match
for a friend of mine.

707
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:19,129
I'm sorry, ma'am.
You're in the wrong place.

708
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:21,430
You want the transplant office
on the fourth floor.

709
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:23,550
These are my forms.

710
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,459
I think you'll see
they're all completely filled out.

711
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,129
Again, ma'am,
you want the transplant office.

712
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:29,349
This is emergency.

713
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:32,320
My friend's name
is Susan Delfino.

714
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:35,790
It's funny. At first,
we didn't get along very well.

715
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:38,410
Actually, we never got along.

716
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,409
But that kind of thing
seems so insignificant

717
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:43,080
when someone is in need.

718
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:46,610
That's great. Fourth floor,
elevator's down the hall.

719
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,189
I really don't mean to trouble you,

720
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:54,910
but these forms have
to get to the right place.

721
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,840
I don't want to mess this up.

722
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:01,430
It's the most important
thing I've ever done.

723
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,490
Okay.

724
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,369
I'll take care of it.

725
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:09,499
Thank you so much.
You're very kind.

726
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,900
Wheelchair is on its way.

727
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:27,180
We need some help over here!

728
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:35,080
