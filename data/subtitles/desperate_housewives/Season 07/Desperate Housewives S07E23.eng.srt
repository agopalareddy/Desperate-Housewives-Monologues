Oh. In that case...

177
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:25,814
Excuse me, miss.
We just love your clothes.

178
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:28,985
Yes, they are so expressive.

179

Oh, I'm so glad to hear you say so.

180
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:33,529
From the way they've been selling,

181
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:36,433
I was starting to think
they were too edgy for Fairview.

182
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,460
Not for us.
I'm gonna take these tops, and...

183
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:40,699
(GASPS) Ooh!

184
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:44,038

ventilated jeans, and...

(GASPS) Oh!

186
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:49,138
Look at this lovely skull purse!

187
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:52,180
Hey, don't you want to try them on first?

188
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:54,742
Yeah, Bree, you really should.

189
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,686
You two just made my day.

190
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:03,394

192
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:11,130
Thank you so much, Bree.

193
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,604
You're welcome, Doreen.

194
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:16,964
How do you know my name?

195
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:18,301
I don't.

196
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,505
You just said it. You called me Doreen.

197
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,979
Oh! Well, it was on your name tag.

198
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,645
Or would be if you had one.

199
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:29,446
That's why we don't check out the wife.

200

202
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:37,357

at the woman

203
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:38,624

204
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:41,531
Hey. Bree here is a class act.

205
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,625
Not that you can tell at the moment.

206
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:46,035
For your information,
Chuck has not slept with me,

207
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:47,902
and he won't while he's still married.

211
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:55,644
He has high ethical standards,
and so do I.

212
00:11:57,683 --> 00:12:01,585
Sorry. I guess I misjudged you.

213
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,313
Apology accepted.

214
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:05,687
And I hope for your sake
as well as for mine

215
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,693
that you and Chuck
come to an agreement soon.

216
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,688
You know what? I think we just might.

217
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:13,355

I said I'd sign?

Look at us. Quick! Button your shirt.

522
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:56,413
I don't have any buttons.

- What?
- You're the one who ripped them off.

Oh, no!

BREE: Hello, everyone!

528
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:12,655
I'm embarrassed to admit it, but...

529
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,526
My oven malfunctioned.

530
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:19,133
It's been very erratic lately
and I thought I'd fixed it,

531
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:23,630
but Chuck and I went to the cellar
to choose a wine,

532
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:28,135
and when we were done,
my entrée was smoking.

533
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:30,178
I'll bet it was.

534
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:33,712
Hey, Chuck,
what happened to your shirt?

535
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:37,050
Well, as Bree's already pointed out,
it was very smoky in the kitchen.

536
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:39,385
And I couldn't find a towel
to wave it away,

537
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,620
so I, um, used my shirt.

538
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:47,560
(STAMMERING)
And I waved it so vigorously

539
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:51,466
that all the buttons came off.

540
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:55,204
Should I offer to loan him a shirt?

541
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:56,535
Don't you dare.

542
00:32:56,975 --> 00:33:01,139
Anyway, we are going to

543
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:04,478
- go pick up some roast chickens.
- Chickens.

544
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:08,042
So, enjoy the wine and...
(WHISPERS) Get my shoes.

545

Are you counting my drinks now?

550
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:33,735
I don't think I can count that high.

You knew I drank when we met.
You were the bartender!

I mean, we never used to fight.

This was all about Doug.

When he cheated on me with Tina,

563
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:21,552
I thought he was just
sick of being married

564
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:23,958
and just wanted to screw around.

565
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:28,890
But now, he's marrying her,
which means what he was sick of

566
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:30,059
is me.

about all those things you said.

over your mouth,
