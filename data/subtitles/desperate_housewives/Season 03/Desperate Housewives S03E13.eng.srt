1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,960
Previously on DH

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,110
while ian's wife jane was in a coma...

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,190
do we have a deal?

4
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:06,620
Susan got an ultimatum.

5
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:10,200
He's not crazy about me spending time with my ex.

6
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,460
Mike's new hero...

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,300
I owe you one.

8
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,890
After those mutts knocked you around the other day,your boy paid 'em off.

9
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,160
your boy paid them off

10
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,470
Had a secret agenda.

11
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:20,140
Gabrielle.

12
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:22,160
Gabrielle learned the identity...

13
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,060
I'm rich now.

14
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,490
I can give you anything you want.

15
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,240
Of her secret admirer.

16
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:27,400
Tell me everything.

17
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:31,120
And orson's mother shared some family secrets

18
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,640
that bree...

19
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,570
would later discover.

20
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:44,180
if there was one thing orson hodge understood,it was teeth.

21
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,830
That's why people stopped him at barbecues...

22
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,950
during cocktail parties...

23
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:57,690
and in the occasional men's room.

24
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,430
Yes,when it came to teeth,people expected dr.

25
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,530
Hodge to have all the answers.

26
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,240
Sadly for orson,this was not always the case.

27
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,830
Well,it does look a little fishy.

28
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:16,860
Fishy?

29
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:18,830
It couldn't be more obvious.

30
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,790
Alma killed monique.

31
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:22,270
That's why she disappeared.

32
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:25,550
And I bet she pulled the teeth so people would suspect her dentist husband.

33
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:26,630
Well,why would she keep them?

34
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:26,990
Who knows?

35
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,440
She's probably gonna sneak in and plant them in our house.

36
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,380
Well,we've saved her the trouble,haven't we?

37
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,740
Is it a full set?

38
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,310
Orson! Not on the duvet! Oh,it's okay.

39
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:36,950
They won't stain.

40
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:44,650
I don't care! I am not sleeping in a bed that had your dead mistress' teeth in it! Let's just take them to the police.

41
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,050
And say what?

44
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:51,420
And don't forget,I'm the one they suspect.

45
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:52,940
Well,we have to do something.

46
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:56,610
I agree,but not until we put the back in her house.

47
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,960
And then we'll call the police.

48
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,850
Trust me,she'll never get away with it.

49
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,350
hello.

50
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,850
You've been very naughty,haven't you?

51
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,100
Orson?

52
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,650
Is that you?

53
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,760
I know what you and alma are up to,and it's gonna stop.

54
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:29,250
Yes,orson was an expert on teeth.

55
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,780
I have no idea what you're talking about.

56
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,780
Oh,I think you do.

57
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,410
That's how he could tell when people were lying through them.

58
00:02:41,649 --> 00:02:46,649
ytet

59
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
ytet

60
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,500
ytet

61
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,240
It can happen so quickly.

62
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:30,250
In the moment it takes a gunman's bullet to enter his victim's leg...

63
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:35,940
in the time it takes to tell a wife her husband won't be home for dinner...

64
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:42,760
in the instant it takes a father to meet his son for the very first time...

65
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:49,790
yes,life as we know it can change...

66
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,060
in a heartbeat.

67
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,620
Jane's still running a fever.

68
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:58,350
Yes,and she hasn't responded to any of the meds that we've tried.

69
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,560
Do you think we should call her husband?

70
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:01,900
Uh,not just yet.

71
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,360
Let's try vancomycin.

72
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,760
It worked for her before.

73
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,830
I don't want ian to worry.

74
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,780
this is your new lawyer,alan marcus.

75
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,610
Alan,this is mike delfino.

76
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:12,390
Hey,mike.

77
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,430
Sorry I couldn't start on your case sooner.

78
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,530
I was wrapping up an armed robbery trial.

79
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,400
It's nice to finally meet you.

80
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,380
And you must be ian.

81
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:24,650
I can't thank you enough for helping me out here.

82
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,070
Susan and I are happy to be of assistance.

83
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,370
so should we get started?

84
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:37,180
Sure.

85
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:46,060
So,mike,I've had a chance to review all the evidence against you,and I've got a strategy to ensure your case never goes to trial.

86
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:47,600
Don't you love this guy?

87
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,260
What's the strategy?

88
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:50,560
Pleading guilty?

89
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,030
What kind of a strategy is that?

90
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,740
He'd only be pleading to manslaughter.

91
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,190
That's still ten years in prison.

92
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:58,460
Well,which is better than life,and that's what mike's risking if he goes to trial.

93
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,740
With good behavior,he could be out in five.

94
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,950
With a better lawyer,he could be out in zero.

95
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,190
We need to find a lawyer who believes that he's innocent.

96
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,080
Well,the evidence against him is very compelling.

97
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,550
You're letting your feelings for him cloud your judgment.

98
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,340
My "feelings for him"?

99
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:13,770
Are we gonna do this again?

100
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,310
Do you realize that every conversation we have winds up being about mike?

101
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,490
"Who's the best lawyer for mike?

102
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,750
How can we get mike acquitted?

103
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:22,630
" I have told you I love you a thousand times.

104
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,980
Where is all this jealousy coming from?

105
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,720
Do you know what?

106
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,800
I have to catch that plane to montreal.

107
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:31,770
What?

108
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:34,030
No,ian,we have to talk about this.

109
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,650
I can't be late.

110
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:35,880
It's business.

111
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,800
Look,I have provided mike with the best lawyer I know.

112
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:43,780
If you want to get someone else,then you're on your own.

113
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,190
whatcha doing?

114
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:54,380
Oh,deciding what to wear on my first day back to work.

115
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,460
Do I look fat in this?

116
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,980
I think you look good in everything.

117
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,580
Wow.

118
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,220
Your father has taught you well.

119
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,880
What about the street fair?

120
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,440
If you're going back to work,who's gonna take me?

121
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,630
Mrs.Mccluskey

122
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,490
Won't that be fun?

123
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,850
No.

124
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,530
Do y have to go back to work?

125
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:13,890
Come on.

126
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,490
You and your brothers will be thrilled.

127
00:06:16,499 --> 00:06:22,730
Don't you get tired of me yelling at you to clean up your room and finish your homework?

128
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:27,180
Yeah,but you've been a lot nicer since you got shot.

129
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,170
Oh.

130
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,770
Well,that's good to know.

131
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,660
When you think about it,me going back to work is not that big a deal.

132
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,700
We're only losing a ttle time together in the afternoon.

133
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,420
But every hour counts.

134
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,480
I miss you all day long.

135
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,550
Oh,honey...

136
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,110
jeez.

137
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:57,230
Do you really mean that,or are you manipulating mommy into feeling incredibly guilty?

138
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,380
A little bit of both.

139
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:01,580
Yep.

140
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,220
Your father's taught you well.

141
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,020
the suspense is killing me.

142
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,270
shh! Shh! Here it comes.

143
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:15,020
and now the moment we've all been waiting for...

144
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:19,110
the winner of this year's little miss snowflake pageant is...

145
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,340
sherri maltby!

146
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,570
I'm in shork.I mean,I knew she had a shot at the top five,but to actually win?

147
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:41,060
I was sure she'd lose to that little blonde bitch who sang that patriotic medley.

148
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:41,980
I know.

149
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,470
She practically had sparklers coming out of her ass.

150
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,520
totally shameless.

151
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,170
Okay,hon,let's go meet those reporters.

152
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,280
What are you gonna tell 'em?

153
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,210
- I owe it all to "beauty by vern.
- attagirl

154
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,710
Oh,zach.what are you doing here

155
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:02,910
I came to support you.

156
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:03,750
Oh.

157
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,610
Okay,why don't you support me from the lobby?

158
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,350
I have some networking to do.

159
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,710
My girl just won the pageant.

160
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:11,440
Oh,yeah,I know,and you're welcome.

161
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:14,670
What did you do?

162
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:15,610
Don't worry.

163
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,700
I paid the judges in cash.

164
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,850
There's no paper trail.

165
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:20,000
You bribed the judges?

166
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,450
Gabrielle,why are we fighting?

167
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:22,610
We should be celebrating.

168
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,030
I got a limo outside,a bottle of chilled cristal.

169
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,510
Come on.Let's go.Let's party.

170
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,330
Listen to me,you pimply psychopath,you and i are never going to party.

171
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:37,270
In fact,the only reason we're ever gonna be in the same room again is if you strangle a cheerleader and I wind up on the jury!

172
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:40,780
- god i love it when we banter
- Ugh.

173
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,600
hello,alma.

174
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,760
Orson.

175
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:52,850
Uh,I let myself in.

176
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:53,640
I hope you don't mind.

177
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:55,710
Not at all.

178
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,130
You seem very cheerful.

179
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:03,370
Oh,I am,'cause the game's over,and you lost.

180
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,710
I told you what I'd do if you pushed me away.

181
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,440
Well,I'm afraid that threat no longer has any teeth in it.

182
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:14,830
Yes,your mother told me about bree's little discovery.

183
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,230
What'd you do with monique's teeth?

184
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,050
Well,maybe I threw them away.

185
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,740
Maybe I hid them here.

186
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,560
You might find them,if the police don't find them first.

187
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,700
Oh,I don't think you'll bring the police into this.

188
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,730
Well,neither will you now.

189
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,110
We're done.

190
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,140
Why don't you do us all a favor and go away?

191
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,520
You shouldn't treat me this way.

192
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,150
Don't bother crying.

193
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:41,150
Tears might've worked when we were married,after you lost the baby.

194
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,350
They won't work now.

195
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:44,570
We should have kept trying.

196
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,980
If we'd had a child,we'd still be together.

197
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:49,690
I know.

198
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:52,610
That's why I stopped trying.

199
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,120
Good-bye,alma.

200
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:05,190
well,there's some sucky news.Ken just quit

201
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,440
Your new maneger?

202
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:07,280
no

203
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:08,780
Yes,so I'm screwed

204
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,440
I'm gonna have to drop out of the street fair

205
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,580
Tom, no,you can't,you can't

206
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:17,810
The pizzeria opens in a week,and that street fair is the best advertising we're gonna get

207
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,000
I know,but I can't work it alone

208
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,160
you know,hire someone else

209
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,410
well there's no time for that

210
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,620
the future of the resturant is at stake

211
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:29,070
it is time to get creative

212
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:32,810
Well,I do have one option,but it would require some sacrifice.

213
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:34,580
Well,whatever it is gonna take.

214
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,210
You could help me.

215
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:38,680
What?no unh-unh

216
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,900
Look,I'm wearing makeup.

217
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:41,400
I am holding a briefcase.

218
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,750
What does this suggest to you?

219
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,110
You could call in sick.

220
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:51,030
I can't call in sick after eight weeks of sick leave,especially when I've been fine for three of them.

221
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:54,300
oh! Crap,that's ed.

222
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:55,880
Lynette?

223
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,090
Lynette,please?

224
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,570
You're the one who said that we need the street fair.

225
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,050
My boss is waiting for me outside in his car.

226
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,780
What am I supposed to do?

227
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:09,940
It's time to get creative.

228
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,330
oh,there she is.

229
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:20,380
hey,guys.

230
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,340
Boy,didn't expect you to still be wearing a sling.

231
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:28,230
Yeah,it heals a little slower when the bullet's still in there.

232
00:11:28,235 --> 00:11:29,280
oh They couldn't get it out?

233
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,210
No,it's too close.

234
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,380
To what?

235
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,040
Everything.

236
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,510
God,i'm so sorry.

237
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,840
Oh.

238
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,390
hey,you got a little,uh,cereal right...

239
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,470
cereal?

240
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:42,770
I didn't have any,uh...

241
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,010
oh,I know what that is.

242
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:50,390
I get nauseous from the pain,so that's just a little residual vomit.

243
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,160
Lynette,you sure you're ready to come back to work?

244
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,730
Yeah! Don't be silly.

245
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:56,730
I'm fine.

246
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:57,400
Come on.

247
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:59,870
Let's go sell some toothpaste.

248
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,120
all righty! Let's go.

249
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:08,280
ow! Ow! Son of a bitch! Don't touch me,okay?

250
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:09,230
Anything we can do?

251
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:12,030
My pills! My pain pills are in my bag.

252
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:13,050
Thanks.

253
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:27,310
Oh! Oh,my pills!I need my pills,and now they're all dirty!
see ya next week! Thanks for understanding!

254
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:35,570
Hey Looks like an interesting book.what's it about?

255
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:37,800
Never mind.

256
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,740
I'll wait for the movie.

257
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,630
What's eating you?

258
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,840
Those two guys you saved me from?

259
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,340
I know you paid 'em to attack me.

260
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,570
That's a lie.

261
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,810
- hey!
- You wanna take a minute to reconsider that?

262
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,120
Okay.OK

263
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:52,010
I needed a favor,and I wanted you to owe me.

264
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,920
What favor?

265
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,670
You sure you want to get into this now?

266
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,360
Yeah.

267
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,560
Okay.

268
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,550
You remember my son zach?

269
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,990
Vaguely.Why

270
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,990
Turns out you and I share more than a cellblock.

271
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,830
Hello,bree.

272
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,410
May I come in?

273
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,050
What's a garden without a snake?

274
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:30,390
I realize I'm not your favorite person,but I thought you should
know why alma's here

275
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:33,060
She wants orson back.

276
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,890
Thanks for the heads-up.

277
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,470
Now off you go.

278
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:44,200
Orson and i may have our spats,but I'm still deeply concerned about the state of his soul.

279
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,680
Adultery is a sin.

280
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,770
I wouldn't worry about orson's soul.

281
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:51,580
He won't be sleeping with alma.

282
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,860
When I said "adultery"...

283
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:57,340
I wasn't referring to orson and alma.

284
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:59,710
I meant orson and you.

285
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,390
Excuse me?

286
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:04,350
Our church doesn't accept divorce.

287
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:07,930
In the eyes of god,you're the other woman.

288
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:12,900
I'm sure you don't see it that way,but alma and I do...

289
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:16,170
and orson's beginning to.

290
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,720
Are those shoes suede?

291
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:22,390
Yes.

292
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,460
Why?

293
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,140
no reason.

294
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,890
why the hell didn't anybody tell me I had a son?

295
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,450
You'd just come out of a coma.

296
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:43,430
They probably figured you had enough on your plate.

297
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,520
Well,why are you telling me now?

298
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,820
Zach and i haven't spoken in months.

299
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,950
Every time I've tried to contact him,he won't return the calls.

300
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:53,730
I don't know what you expect me to do.

301
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,040
I barely remember the kid.

302
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:00,550
Yes,but he remembers you,and I think if you reach out to him,he'll talk to you.

303
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,310
Zach is all I have left in the world.

304
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,380
Through everything that's happened,I've never stopped loving him.

305
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:11,610
Can you please get him to come down here and see me?

306
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,480
That's one hell of a favor.

307
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,820
Man,you got some nerve.

308
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,860
I know.

309
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:24,010
It's kind of what got me in here.

310
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,030
Is it gaby's birthday?

311
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:30,670
No,they're probably from zach young.

312
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,820
What?

313
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,360
You haven't heard?

314
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,750
He has been begging gaby to go on a date with him.

315
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,580
He's been sending her all sorts of stuff to bribe her,even a diamond bracelet.

316
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:41,430
Zach young?

317
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,110
Our zach young?

318
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,800
How does he afford diamonds?

319
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:46,960
His grandfather left him all that money.

320
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,850
Yeah,I thought it was in a trust,and he couldn't touch it.

321
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:51,480
Until he turned 18,which was a month ago.

322
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,000
Wow.

323
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,730
So zach young is loaded,huh?

324
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:58,720
No.

325
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,560
Absolutely not.

326
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,350
Oh,come on.

327
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,110
Mike needs a great lawyer.

328
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,790
Zach can afford a great lawyer.

329
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:04,730
I don't care.

330
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,300
I'm not going out with zach young! It's one little date.

331
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,990
You wouldn't even let your own daughter go out with him.

332
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,490
You said he was a psycho.

333
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:13,470
He's matured...

334
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,630
to the tune of a billion dollars.

335
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:16,990
Please do this...

336
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:17,780
for mike.

337
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,510
Susan,do you know what your obsession with mike has cost you?

338
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:25,210
First you piss off bree and then ian,and--and now you're pimping me out to a teenager!

339
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:31,760
ok,i deserve the pimping remark,but  let's not pretend that ,youknow we are above teenagers.

340
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:37,550
Gaby,you're all I've got.

341
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,100
Oh,fine,I'll do it.

342
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:43,240
Thank you! This is a noble thing you're doing.

343
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,610
How n you be so sure zach's gonna go along with this?

344
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:49,790
Oh,'cause he's a great kid,and he's gonna want to help mike...

345
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:52,710
and you're not gonna be wearing a bra when you ask him out.

346
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:08,580
ooh,can you guys just,uh,take five,please?

347
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,300
gabrielle,what are you doing h here?

348
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,840
Wow,you have your own recording studio in your house?

349
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,840
Yeah,I needed a place to lay some tracks with my band.

350
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,450
You,um,you see that guy?
He used to tour with the doobie brothers.

351
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,370
How wild is that?

352
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,100
gee,well...

353
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,900
not as wild as what I'm about to say.

354
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,460
You can take me to dinner.

355
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,560
Seriously?
Aweme!

356
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,570
Yeah,here's how it's gonna work--

357
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:36,710
we drive to the restaurant separately,
we will not have dessert,

358
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:39,770
and under no circumstances will you touch me.
Capisce?

359
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:41,910
Um...
okay.

360
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:42,810
Great.

361
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:46,890
In order for this magical night to occur,
you're gonna need to help mike delfino.

362
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:49,080
Mike?
What happened?

363
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:51,310
He's in jail...
for murder.

364
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,770
But susan swears he's innocent,
and she wants you to get him a good lawyer.

365
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:56,550
All right,we have a deal?

366
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,270
No.

367
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,980
- No?
- Oh,I-I would love to help mike.

368
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,840
It's just that,uh,if I'm paying for a lawyer,you know,

369
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,720
I would like to have more than just one meal with you.
I'd like to have a whole day.

370
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:14,000
- A whole day?
- Yeah,here's how it's gonna work--

371
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,890
um,it's gonna be three meals with dessert,

372
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:20,810
activities of my choosing and A...

373
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:23,190
a good night kiss.

374
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,170
Now do we--
do we have a deal?

375
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:29,740
Not quite. The day starts with lunch,
and that kiss-- off the table.

376
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,500
Did they set bail for mike?

377
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,750
You know,'cause I-I could throw that in,too.

378
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,610
$1 million.

379
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,170
It's no biggie.

380
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:45,940
One call to my accountant,and mike's a free man.

381
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:52,760
Or do you want to tell susan that mike's gonna
stay in jail because you wouldn't kiss me?

382
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:56,780
Okay,deal,you little skunk.

383
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:03,370
Here you go. You can come back for seconds.
Our famous pepperoni pizza.

384
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:05,080
- Here's another canadian bacon.
- There you go.

385
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:09,460
Great. Guess what?
Our line is the biggest one at the fair. I counted.

386
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:12,260
- you know what I'm starting to think?
- What?

387
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:15,700
This restaurant is gonna be a big,fat hit.

388
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,620
Here you go.

389
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,360
Can I talk to you about something?

390
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:34,750
I think you hurt lynette's feelings
when you refused to go to the street fair with her.

391
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,730
She's gonna start to think you don't like her.

392
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,750
You don't want that,do you?

393
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:44,510
doorbell.

394
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:54,540
some of 'em should be left on a hillside to rot.

395
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:57,700
- Hi.
- Hi.

396
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,810
I'm ed ferrara,lynette's boss.
Is,uh,she around?

397
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:04,850
Uh,well,actually,she's at the,
uh,uh,the,uh,doctor'S.

398
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,590
Oh.
Yeah.

399
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:08,620
- Well,could you give h this?
- Oh.Sure.

400
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,940
And tell her to get well.

401
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,880
And she doesn't need to come back to work till
she's good and readY.

402
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,410
- I will make sure she gets this.
- Okay.

403
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:22,340
Excuse me.
Mister?

404
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:26,390
I just wanted to tell you our babysitter
gets mixed up sometimes.

405
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,830
Lynette's not at the doctor'S.

406
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,860
- She's not?
- Nope.

407
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,140
Well...

408
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,790
where is she?

409
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,670
Excuse me.

410
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,150
- Hey.
- Try some of that. Hey.

411
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,750
- Load me up again,would ya?
- Yeah?

412
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,640
I'm gonna go poach some customers from
that sausage-on-a-stick guy.

413
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,210
Oh,I love it when you're ruthless.

414
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,930
Scavo's pizzeria!

415
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:55,650
Try the smoked chicken and sundried tomato.

416
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,640
Oh!
This crust is fantastic!

417
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,920
It's cornmeal.
That's the secret.

418
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,060
it's not your only secret,is it,lynette?

419
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,110
Uh,hi,ed.

420
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,760
How's the arm?

421
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:19,130
uh,on the mend,
but I'm gonna be there bright and early monday morning.

422
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:21,120
Don't bother.
You're fired.

423
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,890
wait,ed!
Ed,please don't go.

424
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:26,980
Yes,i lied,and that was wrong,
but my husband needed my help.

425
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,400
I need your help.

426
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,190
You've been gone eight weeks,with pay,
while the company's been falling apart.

427
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,620
- Okay--
- and now you pull this on me?

428
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:38,370
Like I said,really,really wrong,but if you take me back,
I swear I will give you 100%.

429
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:41,720
So...

430
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,640
if we have to work late,you're gonna do it.

431
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:51,110
If I ask you to miss your kid's baseball game,
you're gonna say,"no problem,ed"?

432
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,860
You got it,ed.

433
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:55,970
Good.

434
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,860
I'll see you monday.

435
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:17,970
hi. It's-- it's me.
Um,listen,we-- we-- we have to talk.

436
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:21,380
Ian,I'm sorry,too.
We've got to stop fighting like this.

437
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:25,580
Susan,um,jane's doctor called me.
She's-- she's taken a bad turn.

438
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,230
Oh.
Ian...

439
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:32,170
I'm,uh,I'm on the next flight out,but it's not for a few hours,
and jane's parents are in rome.

440
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:35,270
Would,uh,would you go to the hospital for me?

441
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,710
The hospital?

442
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:41,010
Well,I-I know it's a lot to ask,
but if something should happen,I--

443
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,480
well,I don't want her to be alone.

444
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:52,420
oh,let's stop!
I can't believe you talked me into that crème brûléE.

445
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:55,570
Oh,don't feel guilty.
I'm sure we burned it off on the dance floor.

446
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:57,780
I know!
You're such a good dancer!

447
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,270
Where'd you learn how to salsa?

448
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:01,700
I've been taking lessons
'cause I knew it was your favorite.

449
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,320
When did I say that?

450
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,760
"Cosmo," '98.

451
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,170
And I knew you liked that merlot
from your "vogue" interview.

452
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:09,410
You researched me?
That's sweet!

453
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:13,330
In a,uh,stalkery kind of way.

454
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:18,150
thanks again for a surprisingly enjoyable night.

455
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:19,830
see you around.

456
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,870
Uh...
gaby?

457
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:28,390
oh!
Right,the kiss.

458
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:31,110
Sorry.
I didn't mean to welsh on ya.

459
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,190
All right.

460
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:35,320
Pucker up.

461
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,520
What the hell are you doing?!

462
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,180
But you said I could kiss you.

463
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,410
Yes,my lips,not my esophagus!

464
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:57,470
For your information,
I have been told that I'm a very good kisser,all right?

465
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:58,790
By who?

466
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:01,580
The same girl that taught you to use
your tongue like a windshield wiper?

467
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,630
No,by women--
women with lots of experience--

468
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:06,200
and every single one of them said that
I was a great kisser.

469
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,730
how much did you pay them to say that?

470
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,470
No!

471
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,670
You've paid women for--

472
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,700
it's none of your business,all right?
It's none of your business.

473
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,350
Uh,yes,it is.
You just vacuumed my tonsils.

474
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:23,580
I deserve to know where that mouth has been.

475
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,380
You know what?
I-I-I'm sorry. I gotta go.

476
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,990
Wait,zach.

477
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,070
Zach,I'm not mad!

478
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:32,820
Hey,I'm just a little...
grossed out,that's all!

479
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:43,260
no,you heard me.
You heard me,all right?

480
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,320
Read my lips.
Just go,all right? Go!

481
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,770
- You've got no right to be here!
- All right!

482
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:53,720
What,another one?
You organ donor people are vultures.

483
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,530
Um,no,actually,I'm a friend of ian'S.
He asked me to come...

484
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,040
for jane.

485
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,330
Oh,you...
you're the girlfriend.

486
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:03,540
All right,that's okay then.
Come on in.

487
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:15,480
so,erika,uh,youere fighting with that guy when I came in.

488
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:19,120
Have you had a lot of
those organ donor people around today?

489
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,610
Oh,that wasn't about that.

490
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,750
No,that was ted.

491
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:27,580
What,ian never told you about jane and ted?

492
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:30,910
No.
What about them?

493
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:34,180
Nothing. Forget I mentioned it.
It is not my place.

494
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,070
What?

495
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:38,220
They had an affair.

496
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,360
Jane cheated on ian?

497
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:41,920
When was this?

498
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,780
I hate to dish my best friend on her deathbed...

499
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:50,000
but gossip was the foundation of our relationship,so...

500
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,720
it was five years ago.

501
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:56,220
Ian was traveling a lot on business,

502
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,730
jane was lonely,and along came ted.

503
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,270
I'm just stunned.

504
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:07,710
So I guess they worked it out,right?

505
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:09,900
Well,ian took her back.

506
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:13,100
But if you're asking,did he ever really trust her again?
I don't think so.

507
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,100
Poor ian.

508
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:19,260
You don't know the half of it.

509
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,710
I mean,to be betrayed by somebody you loved that much...

510
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,690
You're just never the same.

511
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,820
Hey.
What are you doing here?

512
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:41,830
Um,word on the street is you're looking for a manager.

513
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,420
yeah.

514
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,820
Here's my application.

515
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,160
I thought ed took you back.

516
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,600
He did.
I told him I wasn't interested.

517
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,330
What?

518
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,620
You're quitting?

519
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:57,240
I had so much fun at the fair today,

520
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,400
working with you on something that was all ours.

521
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:05,700
I want every day to be like that.

522
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,360
Honey,so do I.

523
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,210
Are--
are you sure?

524
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,620
I mean,your career's always meant so much to you.

525
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:16,340
When I got shot and I was lying there bleeding,
I wasn't thinking,

526
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:19,080
"god,I'm really gonna miss advertising.¡±

527
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:24,820
I think this could be the best thing
that's ever happened to our family.

528
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:29,120
We can make our own hours,we'll be together more,

529
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,320
and,yes,the money is gna be a little tight,

530
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,420
but I think this place could be a gold mine.

531
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:40,430
In that case,you're hired.

532
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:45,490
You do,of course,
realize you have to sleep with the boss.

533
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:47,720
I can do that.

534
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,290
good.

535
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:57,500
Whoa.
It's a little soon to be gunning for a promotion.

536
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,720
your mother not home yet?

537
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,550
Uh,I haven't seen her.

538
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:10,550
hello?

539
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,330
What is it now?

540
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,980
Alma did what?!

541
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:19,950
No,no.
I'll be right over.

542
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:23,130
Wait,wait,what--
what-- what did alma do?

543
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,880
I just thank the lord I got here when I did.

544
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,910
But why didn't you call an ambulance?

545
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:38,760
I thought it best for all concerned to keep this quiet.

546
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,870
By the way,she left a note.

547
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:50,610
make you love me again,even after the terrible thing i did,
i was wrong.i'd can't live with you.i don't want to live at all.

548
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:54,030
She only did this to upset me.

549
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:56,060
She knows my history.

550
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:58,810
She knows exactly what buttons to push.

551
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:01,230
Orson,calm down.

552
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:02,850
Here.

553
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,400
Our marriage is over.

554
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,050
I will not submit to emotional blackmail.

555
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,690
Are you all right?

556
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,440
I feel dizzy.

557
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,980
then perhaps you should just...

558
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,980
sit.

559
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,650
My god.

560
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:40,590
Did you poison me?

561
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,350
And kill my only child?

562
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,990
You see how he talks to me?

563
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:50,120
It's my fault.

564
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:52,270
I upset him.

565
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:58,650
sorry about all this.
I ju needed to get your attention.

566
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,140
Why?

567
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:05,800
What do you want?

568
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,640
What every mother wants,dear...

569
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:11,800
a grandchild.

570
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:32,120
well,why don't i give you two some privacy?

571
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,360
Thank you,mother hodge.

572
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,620
You mustn't struggle.

573
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:42,230
I want this baby to be born of love.

574
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,800
I've been injecting myself...

575
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:52,070
with hormones to improve our chances.

576
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:56,010
You wait and see.

577
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:58,810
This is gonna fix everything.

578
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:00,500
You're crazy.

579
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,860
Crazy for you,mister!

580
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,300
I won'T.
You can't make me.

581
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,530
why,yes,I can.

582
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:10,200
That drink had two kinds of pills in it--

583
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,150
one to put you to sleep

584
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:16,760
and one to keep the part of you I need nice and perky.

585
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:20,560
Now...
how about a little music?

586
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:40,170
the doctor was just here.
He said her blood pressure's dropping. She could go anytime.

587
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:42,600
I,uh,gotta go call her parents.

588
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:58,790
hi.It's me.
We-- we just took off.

589
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,530
I-I'll be there in about six hours.

590
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:02,010
Uh,sweetie,

591
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,080
I don't think she's gonna make it that long.

592
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,480
don't tell me that.

593
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,580
You've done everything you could.
She knows that you love her.

594
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,110
Well,it's just there's--
there's things I've got to say to her.

595
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:18,030
I've carried around so much anger about something
that doesn't mean anything now,and I--

596
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:20,580
and I-I need her to know that.

597
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:27,260
I'm gonna put the phone up to jane's ear,
and you can tell her whatever you need to,okay?

598
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,020
Okay.

599
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:40,140
Hello,jane,darling.
It's ian.

600
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:44,350
I never imagined I'd have to
say good-bye to you like this.

601
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,140
There's so much I want to say.

602
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,960
you play that pretty well.

603
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:05,860
What are you doing here?

604
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,490
I had a good time tonight,but...

605
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,290
I hated the way it ended.

606
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:14,780
Yeah,me,too.

607
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,280
Gaby...

608
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,780
about those women...

609
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,480
forget about it.

610
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,900
Give a horny kid a couple million bucks and the yellow pages,
and stuff is gonna happen.

611
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,970
It's not just them.
I...

612
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:30,800
I'm paying everyone that I know.

613
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:34,450
Those guys in my band--
they're not my friends. I'M...

614
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:37,510
hiring them to hang out with me.

615
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:40,910
So stop doing it.
Stop buying people.

616
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:44,560
Yeah,right,and then I'd have no one at all.

617
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,220
That's not true.

618
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:51,110
You'd have me.

619
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:54,220
As a friend.

620
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:56,890
A friend friend.
Not a girlfriend.

621
00:33:56,890 --> 00:34:00,530
I really cannot overstress that.

622
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,250
Come on.

623
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:05,190
Why do you wanna be my friend?

624
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:07,660
- We have zero in common.
- I don't know.

625
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:12,230
Maybe it's because I think wee both...

626
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:14,030
adrift.

627
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:19,850
It'd just be nice to have a pal who gets
what I'm going thrgh.

628
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,920
Why don't you play me something you wrote?

629
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,020
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

630
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,830
- Okay. Can I sing,too?
- Sure. Why not?

631
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,840
All right.

632
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:37,840
Gaby sweet gaby--

633
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,590
Why don't you just hum it,okay?

634
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,440
hi.

635
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:49,100
Sorry.
My book club ran late.

636
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,960
- Didn't orson make you dinner?
- Oh,no.

637
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,270
He's been over at alma'S.
He's been there for a few hours now.

638
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:16,540
what the hell is this?!

639
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,940
Oh,bree.
I'm so sorry you had to find out this way.

640
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:23,400
Not as sorry as you are gonna be!

641
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,480
Orson,get up!

642
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,430
Leave him alone.
He wants to be with me now.

643
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:30,590
Orson,I have caught you cheating.
At least have the courtesy to wake up!

644
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:33,910
Oh,for god sakes.

645
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,630
Orson!

646
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,940
Orson?

647
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:46,080
- What have you done to him?!
- Nothing.

648
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:47,900
You know men.

649
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,470
The minute it's over--
wham,off to dreamland.

650
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:52,740
He's not sleeping.
He's out cold.

651
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:03,890
oh,I knew it.
These are sleeping pills,and these are...

652
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,550
oh,my god.

653
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,620
You raped my husband!

654
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:18,260
We made love,and when our baby's born,
he's gonna come back to me.

655
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:20,270
- Baby?!
- It's true.

656
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:22,090
I could be expecting right now.

657
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:23,840
Were you expecting this?

658
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:37,170
Andrew,I need you to come over here right away...

659
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:39,160
and,um...

660
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:42,630
bring the wheelbarrow.

661
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,140
hi.

662
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,520
Do...
do you remember me?

663
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,360
No.
No,not really.

664
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:17,790
But I know who you are.

665
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:21,270
Okay.
Good.

666
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:31,040
what you did,I'm,um...
really grateful.

667
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,760
It's cool.

668
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:40,050
So if you need anything else,I guess...

669
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:42,790
just let me know.

670
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:50,090
Well,I do need something.

671
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:53,660
But it's not for me.

672
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,240
take it to the end.
Move.

673
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:00,800
So how you doing?

674
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,380
You look terrific,really mature.

675
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,460
Your mother would be proud.

676
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,170
Thanks.

677
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:11,350
I've,uh,really missed you a lot,

678
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:13,520
and I'm sorry for,uh...

679
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,040
for everything.

680
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:19,620
I hope you can forgive me.
I want us to be friends.

681
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:23,020
And that's the only reason you wanted to see me,right?

682
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:25,700
So we could be friends?

683
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:27,740
- Yes.
- Okay.

684
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:31,610
That's great.
That's fine.

685
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:38,710
well,there is one other thing.

686
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:40,370
Oh. Yeah.

687
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:43,720
It's just...
felicia tillman faked her death.

688
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,690
She's still out there.
You and I,we both know that.

689
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:50,110
If you gave-- or lent me some money,

690
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:52,500
I could hire someone to track her down,

691
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:56,220
and then I could get out of here,
and you and I could pick up where we left off.

692
00:38:58,650 --> 00:38:59,980
okay...

693
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,010
you asked me how I was doing.

694
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:06,610
I'm actually doing great.

695
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,570
I've got the hottest,
most amazing girlfriend in the entire world,

696
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:12,500
and I am gonna marry that woman.

697
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:15,390
I'm gonna buy her everything she wants.

698
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,700
So...

699
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:21,680
I have got to learn to say no when people ask me for money,

700
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,500
because I got a future wife to think about.

701
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:28,850
She's got really expensive taste.

702
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:36,010
I mean,I do forgive you,though...

703
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:39,400
paul.

704
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:52,980
Hey,susan.

705
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:55,250
Hey.
You're back.

706
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:57,810
Yeah,zach young posted my bail,

707
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:01,520
but I'm guessing you had something to do with it.

708
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,030
Maybe a little.

709
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:06,650
Is there any way that I can thank you,you know,

710
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:08,520
for everything you've done?

711
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,660
Actually,yeah,there is.

712
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,340
Good.
Good.

713
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:14,230
Just tell me.

714
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,030
I can't see you anymore.

715
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:21,930
I want you to understand it doesn't
have anything to do with you. It's just...

716
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,250
that's okay.
It's not...

717
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,640
I think I get it.

718
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:45,460
Well,I,uh,I should probably go.

719
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,270
Bye.
Good-- good luck with everything.

720
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:52,010
Good luck to you and ian.

721
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,710
Yes,it can happen so quickly.

722
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:30,730
Life as we know it can change in the blink of an eye.

723
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:35,170
{6}Thanks for dinner...
Your new friend.

724
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:36,700
Unlikely friendships can blossom...

725
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:44,050
important careers can be tossed aside...

726
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:51,440
a long-lost hope can be rekindled.

727
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:57,970
Still,we should be grateful for whatever
changes life throws at us,

728
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:02,950
because all too soon the day will come...

729
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,960
when there are no changes left.
