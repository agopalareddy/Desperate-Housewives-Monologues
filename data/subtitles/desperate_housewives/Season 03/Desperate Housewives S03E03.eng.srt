1
00:00:01,214 --> 00:00:03,410
Previously on Desperate Housewives...

2
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,105
God, I love seeing you laugh.

3
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:21,590
Oh, well, it's been a long time since
I've been in the mood to. Thank you.

4
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:24,415
Persistence paid off
for Susan's new friend.

5
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,750
You're gonna leave me out here
in the middle of nowhere?

6
00:00:26,785 --> 00:00:30,270
And Bree began to regret
what she had done.

7
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:35,510
Orson Hodge dreamed
of the perfect honeymoon.

8
00:00:35,545 --> 00:00:41,570
Indeed, he'd begun planning it the moment
Bree Van De Kamp agreed to marry him.

9
00:00:41,605 --> 00:00:44,270
They'd start by flying first class,

10
00:00:45,035 --> 00:00:47,851
to an exclusive 5-star hotel,

11
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,126
where they'd spend
their days by the pool,

12
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,023
and their nights making love.

13
00:00:54,222 --> 00:00:56,488
And when they returned home,

14
00:00:56,528 --> 00:01:00,862
their perfect honeymoon
would continue... forever.

15
00:01:03,116 --> 00:01:05,443
Mrs. Hodge?

16
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:08,300
Yes, Mr. Hodge?

17
00:01:08,348 --> 00:01:11,853
Do you have any idea how
happy we're going to be?

18
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:16,003
I don't need to be any
happier than I am already,

19
00:01:16,017 --> 00:01:18,532
at this very second.

20
00:01:21,597 --> 00:01:23,723
Oh, my goodness, there's only
15 minutes before our plane.

21
00:01:23,758 --> 00:01:25,401
If you want that latte,
you should go now.

22
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:26,942
Yeah, that's a good idea.

23
00:01:27,848 --> 00:01:31,492
The population of homeless
teenagers continues to climb.

24
00:01:31,526 --> 00:01:32,433
This is Andrew.

25
00:01:32,477 --> 00:01:35,811
Andrew, what is it like
to live on the streets?

26
00:01:35,848 --> 00:01:37,641
It's not so bad.
I mean, you know,

27
00:01:37,685 --> 00:01:39,412
Sometimes people give you food.

28
00:01:39,456 --> 00:01:41,453
You can find a lot
in dumpsters.

29
00:01:41,486 --> 00:01:43,413
Uh, I mean,
just last night,

30
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:46,693
I found almost a whole bucket of
chicken that had hardly been touched.

31
00:01:46,726 --> 00:01:49,613
Andrew told me his
heart-wrenching story.

32
00:01:49,648 --> 00:01:51,072
An alcoholic mother,

33
00:01:51,115 --> 00:01:55,742
a father murdered by the woman's
boyfriend and a childhood shattered

34
00:01:55,778 --> 00:01:59,801
the day his mother abandoned
him on the side of the road.

35
00:02:00,925 --> 00:02:02,763
I'll tell you one thing.

36
00:02:02,808 --> 00:02:06,233
Some people just should never
be allowed to have children.

37
00:02:10,395 --> 00:02:12,650
Darling, I got an extra
one just in case you...

38
00:02:12,686 --> 00:02:13,631
Bree, what's the matter?

39
00:02:13,676 --> 00:02:17,583
A reporter just did a story on homeless
teens, and my son was one of them.

40
00:02:17,618 --> 00:02:18,722
Oh, my God.

41
00:02:18,766 --> 00:02:22,073
Well, we'll call child welfare
the minute we get to the resort.

44
00:02:26,596 --> 00:02:28,593
My son is eating out of dumpsters!

45
00:02:28,637 --> 00:02:30,973
Well, yes, but think how much
better you'll be able to deal

46
00:02:31,008 --> 00:02:33,053
with this crisis after
a nice, relaxing...

47
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,250
Orson!

48
00:02:34,298 --> 00:02:35,883
My child is in trouble.

49
00:02:35,925 --> 00:02:39,712
Don't make me choose between the two
of you, because believe me, you will lose.

50
00:02:39,746 --> 00:02:42,962
Now please, get your ass in gear.

51
00:02:47,068 --> 00:02:49,922
It was at this moment
that Orson realized

52
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:52,523
their honeymoon was over...

53
00:02:52,968 --> 00:02:55,271
In more ways than one.

56
00:03:38,876 --> 00:03:41,993
It was a holiday weekend
on Wisteria Lane,

57
00:03:42,817 --> 00:03:45,762
and everyone was
packing their bags,

58
00:03:46,006 --> 00:03:48,791
hoping to get away from it all.

59
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:52,023
-No, no, all right, good-bye, good-bye!
-No, no! This is so... unfair.

60
00:03:52,057 --> 00:03:54,852
No, no! What's unfair is that we're
slowly running out of money,

61
00:03:54,887 --> 00:03:56,672
and you've barely even
looked for a job.

62
00:03:56,716 --> 00:03:59,980
You're gonna have a good time,
all right? I love you. Good-bye!

63
00:04:00,026 --> 00:04:03,261
Lynette was getting away from
growing tension in her marriage.

64
00:04:03,648 --> 00:04:07,271
You can call it blackmail, Carlos,
but the court calls it "spousal support,"

65
00:04:07,308 --> 00:04:09,633
So unless I get a check by Monday,

66
00:04:09,677 --> 00:04:13,562
your shower buddies from jail will be
throwing you a "welcome back" party.

67
00:04:13,596 --> 00:04:17,391
Gabrielle was getting away
from an increasingly bitter divorce.

68
00:04:17,428 --> 00:04:18,750
Hi.

69
00:04:19,305 --> 00:04:20,942
I'm ready.

70
00:04:20,985 --> 00:04:24,022
So that's my number, in case there's
any change in Mike's condition.

71
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,102
I'm going to the mountains with a friend.

72
00:04:26,148 --> 00:04:31,213
And, uh, just in case you were
wondering, it's strictly platonic.

73
00:04:31,247 --> 00:04:32,733
He wasn't wondering.

74
00:04:32,776 --> 00:04:36,603
Susan was getting away
from mounting guilt.

75
00:04:36,946 --> 00:04:39,650
So you can't tell me anything
about my son's whereabouts?

76
00:04:39,688 --> 00:04:41,232
And then there was Bree,

77
00:04:41,276 --> 00:04:44,241
who had just learned
there are some problems...

78
00:04:44,275 --> 00:04:46,481
-Fine!
-You can't run away from.

79
00:04:46,507 --> 00:04:47,440
Some reporter.

80
00:04:47,498 --> 00:04:49,823
All she could tell me was what
neighborhood they found him in.

81
00:04:49,858 --> 00:04:54,012
They don't have any contact information,
no phone number, no address.

82
00:04:54,048 --> 00:04:57,003
Well, dear, if he had an address,
he wouldn't be homeless.

83
00:04:57,047 --> 00:05:00,983
This really blows. I am this close
to becoming homecoming queen,

84
00:05:01,025 --> 00:05:05,110
and now I'm gonna be that creepy girl
whose brother's a pathetic street junkie.

85
00:05:05,145 --> 00:05:07,312
You know, you could
show a little compassion.

86
00:05:07,356 --> 00:05:10,571
Your brother is out there on the
streets, struggling to survive.

87
00:05:10,635 --> 00:05:12,733
And whose fault is that?

88
00:05:20,947 --> 00:05:23,063
Oh, she's right. This is all my fault.

89
00:05:23,098 --> 00:05:24,541
You can't blame yourself.

90
00:05:24,585 --> 00:05:28,350
No parent can stop a child
who's determined to run away.

91
00:05:29,618 --> 00:05:32,181
He didn't run away.

92
00:05:33,405 --> 00:05:35,071
I kicked him out.

93
00:05:35,105 --> 00:05:36,533
You what?

94
00:05:36,876 --> 00:05:42,352
I left him on the roadside with
some money and his clothes.

95
00:05:42,747 --> 00:05:46,371
I didn't tell you because I was
afraid of what you'd think of me.

96
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:51,150
You did what you had to do.

97
00:05:52,337 --> 00:05:55,690
I just wish you'd said something sooner.

98
00:05:56,535 --> 00:05:59,430
Don't you know there's
nothing you can't tell me?

99
00:06:00,815 --> 00:06:04,171
I don't want there to be
any secrets between us.

100
00:06:04,205 --> 00:06:06,720
There won't be, not anymore.

101
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:12,202
You know, Andrew is not the
only one having a rough year.

102
00:06:12,248 --> 00:06:15,252
I'm the one whose boyfriend
got shot right in front of her.

103
00:06:18,055 --> 00:06:20,093
We'll talk in the car.

104
00:06:27,385 --> 00:06:29,080
Don't  you love this?

105
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:32,730
Oh, God bless Tom for taking
the kids camping this weekend.

106
00:06:34,277 --> 00:06:36,301
This  is exactly what we needed,

107
00:06:36,346 --> 00:06:38,633
Especially after everything
I've been through lately.

108
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:41,183
I'm all about relaxing
and rejuvenating...

109
00:06:41,215 --> 00:06:42,733
-Gaby?
-Yeah?

110
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,773
Could you be all about shutting up?

111
00:06:44,806 --> 00:06:46,680
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-Thanks.

112
00:06:48,065 --> 00:06:50,052
Please don't tell me you
brought your cell phone.

113
00:06:50,085 --> 00:06:51,062
Oh, I'm sorry.

114
00:06:51,105 --> 00:06:53,722
It's just... I'm waiting for
Carlos' lawyer to call.

115
00:06:53,758 --> 00:06:56,341
This whole spousal support
thing's gotten ugly.

116
00:06:56,826 --> 00:06:58,201
Hello?

117
00:06:58,515 --> 00:06:59,933
Oh, hi, Tom!

118
00:06:59,977 --> 00:07:01,193
No! No, no, no. No!

119
00:07:01,236 --> 00:07:04,302
Yeah! Yeah, she's
right here. Hang on.

120
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:06,170
Did you say something?

121
00:07:08,646 --> 00:07:09,603
Hey.

122
00:07:09,648 --> 00:07:13,501
Honey, I know it is your weekend
away, but it's my damn back.

123
00:07:14,838 --> 00:07:16,940
-I threw it out again.
-So?

124
00:07:17,025 --> 00:07:21,040
So I can... I can barely sit up.
The kids are running wild.

125
00:07:21,546 --> 00:07:23,002
I need you to come up here.

126
00:07:23,045 --> 00:07:24,760
Well, why don't you
take a muscle relaxant?

127
00:07:24,807 --> 00:07:28,270
Honey, I've already taken two.
They're not making a dent.

128
00:07:28,308 --> 00:07:29,963
Well, why don't you give
them to the kids?

129
00:07:29,997 --> 00:07:31,201
Ugh, Lynette!

130
00:07:31,245 --> 00:07:33,730
Please don't, Please
don't do this to me.

131
00:07:33,766 --> 00:07:36,013
Parker, for the last time,

132
00:07:36,045 --> 00:07:38,701
Put down the damn ax!

133
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:41,860
Oh, all right. Yeah, yeah.

134
00:07:41,905 --> 00:07:44,271
I will be there as soon as I can.

135
00:07:46,476 --> 00:07:48,082
God, I hate my life.

136
00:07:48,117 --> 00:07:49,040
I know.

137
00:07:49,088 --> 00:07:51,643
I wouldn't trade with
you for anything.

138
00:07:55,328 --> 00:07:58,801
Oh, wow, look at the view.

139
00:08:00,717 --> 00:08:02,990
Don't you just love when
the leaves change color?

140
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:06,943
Well, that's why I suggested this,
so we could hang out for the weekend,

141
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:09,473
and... and enjoy the, um...

142
00:08:11,428 --> 00:08:12,522
scenery.

143
00:08:12,785 --> 00:08:15,373
Yep, the scenery's great.

144
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,766
So, um...

145
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,503
Maybe I should unpack.

146
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,768
Where should I do that?

147
00:08:23,808 --> 00:08:27,001
Well, there are...
There are two bedrooms.

148
00:08:27,035 --> 00:08:29,571
One is mine...

149
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,870
And there's a guest room.

150
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:36,750
A guest room.
That, well, that's handy.

151
00:08:36,786 --> 00:08:38,030
Yeah.

152
00:08:39,725 --> 00:08:43,221
Uh, unless, of course, you'd
like to sleep in my room.

153
00:08:44,937 --> 00:08:47,560
In which case, I would
take the guest room.

154
00:08:47,908 --> 00:08:50,603
Oh! I... uh, no, no!

155
00:08:50,645 --> 00:08:54,100
I should take the guest room
because I am the guest.

156
00:08:54,148 --> 00:08:57,480
Yeah, well, it's, uh, it's up the
stairs at the end of the hall.

157
00:08:57,516 --> 00:08:58,661
Okay.

158
00:09:20,106 --> 00:09:21,730
Susan, I, um...

159
00:09:21,777 --> 00:09:24,700
I think I have your suitcase.

160
00:09:24,748 --> 00:09:27,640
Yeah, and I think I have yours.

161
00:09:29,697 --> 00:09:32,083
So, did you, um, did you
happen to see the, um...

162
00:09:32,117 --> 00:09:33,630
Yeah.

163
00:09:33,676 --> 00:09:36,023
-And did you notice...
-Hard to miss.

164
00:09:41,157 --> 00:09:43,982
-Well, I'm just going to, um...
-Hide pathetically in your room?

165
00:09:44,485 --> 00:09:45,842
Me, too.

166
00:09:53,655 --> 00:09:55,683
Hey, Lynette.

167
00:09:56,427 --> 00:09:57,523
What are you doing here?

168
00:09:57,565 --> 00:09:59,561
Kayla called, and she
told me about Tom's back.

169
00:09:59,596 --> 00:10:00,860
And my car got impounded again,

170
00:10:00,907 --> 00:10:03,240
so I thought that I'd
hitch a ride with you.

171
00:10:03,277 --> 00:10:04,723
Hitch?

172
00:10:05,917 --> 00:10:08,252
You mean, like, we're gonna be
driving in the car together?

173
00:10:08,815 --> 00:10:11,313
Well, you could strap
me to the front bumper,

174
00:10:11,356 --> 00:10:13,823
but, yeah, I'd be
more comfortable inside.

175
00:10:13,855 --> 00:10:16,691
Uh, it's like an 8-hour drive.

176
00:10:16,725 --> 00:10:18,100
So?

177
00:10:19,555 --> 00:10:20,923
Um, how far is the impound lot?

178
00:10:20,966 --> 00:10:24,123
Because, you know, I could just
drive you over there and...

179
00:10:24,548 --> 00:10:26,500
What's your problem, Lynette?

180
00:10:27,277 --> 00:10:30,441
I don't have a problem. I just don't
think we both need to go up there.

181
00:10:30,476 --> 00:10:32,370
I can grab Kayla
and bring her back.

182
00:10:32,407 --> 00:10:34,003
Oh, I see your plan...

183
00:10:34,048 --> 00:10:36,741
You just wanna go charging up
there on your white horse,

184
00:10:36,776 --> 00:10:39,270
and save everyone,
and then I get to be

185
00:10:39,318 --> 00:10:43,470
the rotten mother who didn't give a rat's
ass and stayed home eating bonbons.

186
00:10:45,138 --> 00:10:46,880
No.

187
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,850
-Due to Lynette's sudden departure...
-Thank you.

188
00:10:54,878 --> 00:10:59,890
Gabrielle was forced to spend the
last night of her spa vacation alone,

189
00:10:59,927 --> 00:11:02,232
but she didn't mind.

190
00:11:03,988 --> 00:11:08,540
In fact, she looked forward to a quiet
dinner alone with her thoughts.

191
00:11:09,706 --> 00:11:11,601
Unfortunately for Gabrielle,

192
00:11:11,647 --> 00:11:15,052
her thoughts quickly turned
to her impending divorce,

193
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:18,042
and the empty house
she'd soon return to.

194
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:24,030
And she began to resent the
happy couples she was seeing...

195
00:11:24,626 --> 00:11:26,502
everywhere.

196
00:11:27,527 --> 00:11:29,723
What is this, freakin' Noah's ark?!

197
00:11:32,115 --> 00:11:33,982
I  guess it really is a small world.

198
00:11:34,688 --> 00:11:36,751
Who's there? I can't see you.

199
00:11:38,608 --> 00:11:40,681
Can you see me now?

200
00:11:50,406 --> 00:11:52,081
How much, baby?

201
00:11:53,907 --> 00:11:55,680
Excuse me, ma'am?

202
00:11:57,547 --> 00:11:59,390
I mean... miss,

203
00:11:59,436 --> 00:12:01,880
I'm  looking for someone.
Uh, his name is Andrew.

204
00:12:01,917 --> 00:12:03,043
Have you seen him?

205
00:12:03,085 --> 00:12:05,730
Hard to say, boo.
I see a lot of lost boys his age.

206
00:12:05,947 --> 00:12:08,720
Good-looking one, though.
Someone special?

207
00:12:08,757 --> 00:12:11,462
Yes, very, and I'm
worried sick about him.

208
00:12:11,505 --> 00:12:14,291
You might try the soup kitchen
at St. MalachI's on third.

209
00:12:14,325 --> 00:12:17,682
-Oh, thank you, miss...
-Gates. Pearly gates...

210
00:12:17,725 --> 00:12:20,653
'Cause you can't get to heaven
without going through me.

211
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,490
How very saucy.

212
00:12:31,198 --> 00:12:32,951
Great piano. Do you play?

213
00:12:32,995 --> 00:12:34,851
Oh, no, I'm a, I'm a bit rusty.

214
00:12:34,897 --> 00:12:38,052
Jane loved to sing, so I'd play
for her, but since the accident...

215
00:12:38,085 --> 00:12:39,623
Right.

216
00:12:46,006 --> 00:12:47,460
So...

217
00:12:48,955 --> 00:12:50,402
Brandy,

218
00:12:50,445 --> 00:12:52,182
A roaring fire...

219
00:12:52,228 --> 00:12:54,091
What could be more romantic?

220
00:12:54,135 --> 00:12:56,693
Well, I can think of something.

221
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:01,052
Wow, my heart is pounding.

222
00:13:01,097 --> 00:13:03,622
Uh, is that a bad thing?
Consider the alternative.

223
00:13:04,927 --> 00:13:07,663
Your heart is beating
even faster than mine.

224
00:13:07,697 --> 00:13:10,221
I guess I'm excited.
It has been a while.

225
00:13:10,858 --> 00:13:12,573
Me, too.

226
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:24,361
So was that, uh, okay?

227
00:13:24,406 --> 00:13:26,701
It was bloody fantastic.

228
00:13:27,276 --> 00:13:30,062
Of course, it's a bit different
than what I'm used to.

229
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:31,230
Different?

230
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:34,540
Well, I was with the same
woman for a long time.

231
00:13:34,578 --> 00:13:36,172
Oh, yeah.

232
00:13:36,218 --> 00:13:38,710
But, I mean, you kissed other
girls before that, right?

233
00:13:38,746 --> 00:13:41,471
Sure, but most of them were 12.

234
00:13:41,817 --> 00:13:43,001
As was I.

235
00:13:43,047 --> 00:13:47,632
I met Jane at a school dance,
and after we started dating,

236
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,892
well, I never looked at anyone else.

237
00:13:49,938 --> 00:13:52,723
Are you saying that Jane is
the only woman you ever...

238
00:13:52,758 --> 00:13:54,923
Oh, God, I so didn't
want to tell you that.

239
00:13:54,956 --> 00:13:57,283
Why not? I think that's adorable.

240
00:13:57,325 --> 00:14:02,190
Well, I don't want to be adorable.
I want to be dashing and worldly and...

241
00:14:02,226 --> 00:14:04,793
Oh, Ian. It's okay.

242
00:14:04,835 --> 00:14:09,221
Some people have a lot of
lovers, and some just a few.

243
00:14:09,255 --> 00:14:10,953
It doesn't matter.

244
00:14:11,986 --> 00:14:16,960
Well, seeing as it doesn't matter,
where do you fall on that spectrum?

245
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:20,832
You know, how many men
have you been with?

246
00:14:20,877 --> 00:14:23,422
-Ian.
-Oh, I'm sorry. That was rude.

247
00:14:23,457 --> 00:14:25,060
I withdraw the question.

248
00:14:25,107 --> 00:14:27,401
It's not that it's rude.
It's just immaterial.

249
00:14:27,446 --> 00:14:30,272
I mean, it's just a number.
It doesn't mean anything.

250
00:14:30,307 --> 00:14:32,451
-Seeing as it doesn't mean anything...
-Ian!

251
00:14:32,488 --> 00:14:34,603
Well, you know my
number. It's only fair.

252
00:14:34,635 --> 00:14:37,330
Is it... Is it more than three?

253
00:14:37,735 --> 00:14:39,560
Nine.

254
00:14:39,607 --> 00:14:41,862
Please tell me you were
answering in german.

255
00:14:41,905 --> 00:14:45,802
Nine lovers is not a lot! Nine
lovers does not make me a slut!

256
00:14:45,835 --> 00:14:46,952
Why are you getting upset?

257
00:14:46,998 --> 00:14:50,343
Because it was really 11, and I knocked
off two, and you're still judging me.

258
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:53,693
I'm not judging you. It's just...
did you work in the recording industry?

259
00:14:53,725 --> 00:14:54,950
Okay, just so you know,

260
00:14:54,998 --> 00:14:57,533
11 is not a lot for
a woman my age.

261
00:14:57,566 --> 00:14:58,880
How old are you?

262
00:14:58,927 --> 00:15:01,060
What is this, the gallup poll?!

263
00:15:01,106 --> 00:15:04,150
-Where are you going?
-To bed, alone.

264
00:15:04,196 --> 00:15:07,912
You know, it's something that
I've always wanted to try, but
I've just never gotten around to.

265
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,792
So they liked the landscaping
I did here so much

266
00:15:12,815 --> 00:15:17,413
that they hired my company
to do whole sinclair hotel chain.

267
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:20,720
Your company?
You have a company now?

268
00:15:20,767 --> 00:15:24,050
Oh, my Gosh, when I met you,
all you had was a bike.

269
00:15:24,085 --> 00:15:25,041
Well, not only that,

270
00:15:25,085 --> 00:15:28,112
The, uh, gardening channel's approached
me about hosting my own show.

271
00:15:28,145 --> 00:15:31,413
I mean, we're still
in the talking stages, but...

272
00:15:32,446 --> 00:15:33,810
W hat?

273
00:15:33,858 --> 00:15:35,100
Nothing. I just...

274
00:15:35,445 --> 00:15:38,732
I can't get over how mature
and confident you are.

275
00:15:38,767 --> 00:15:40,713
You've really changed.

276
00:15:40,755 --> 00:15:44,412
Thanks. I was hoping you'd notice.

277
00:15:44,457 --> 00:15:47,763
So I guess, uh, there's no chance
of getting you over to the house

278
00:15:47,797 --> 00:15:50,011
to pick the dead leaves off my ficus.

279
00:15:50,915 --> 00:15:53,970
Yeah, you know,
I'm kind of past that.

280
00:15:54,015 --> 00:15:58,892
Besides, I don't think
Mr. Solis would approve.

281
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:01,532
Actually, we're getting a divorce.

282
00:16:04,126 --> 00:16:06,913
Um, I'm really sorry to hear that.

283
00:16:06,946 --> 00:16:09,491
Really? Then why are you smiling?

284
00:16:09,525 --> 00:16:11,512
I don't know. Why are you?

285
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,830
Gabrielle...

286
00:16:16,318 --> 00:16:18,623
It's really great to see you.

287
00:16:18,658 --> 00:16:20,843
Gabrielle.

288
00:16:20,887 --> 00:16:24,281
I think that's the first time
you've ever called me that.

289
00:16:26,395 --> 00:16:28,030
Well, um...

290
00:16:28,426 --> 00:16:30,472
I hope you enjoy
the rest of your stay.

291
00:16:32,138 --> 00:16:34,241
I intend to.

292
00:16:50,895 --> 00:16:52,470
Your cuppy thing is full.

293
00:16:52,517 --> 00:16:54,872
Do you mind if I put this
in your glove compartment?

294
00:16:54,907 --> 00:16:57,022
Yeah, I do mind. I mind deeply.

295
00:16:57,067 --> 00:17:00,000
Jeez-a-marooni.
I'll just get rid of 'em.

296
00:17:04,488 --> 00:17:07,171
Oh, that's... delightful.
That's delightful.

297
00:17:07,218 --> 00:17:10,270
Maybe it'll just soak up
the cream soda you spilled.

298
00:17:10,906 --> 00:17:13,241
Why do you always pick on me?

299
00:17:13,635 --> 00:17:16,171
It's like your new favorite game
is "finding fault with Nora."

300
00:17:16,207 --> 00:17:18,300
No, my favorite game

301
00:17:18,345 --> 00:17:22,390
is counting all the things
I'm dying to say to you,

302
00:17:22,415 --> 00:17:23,350
But I don't.

303
00:17:23,528 --> 00:17:24,040
Like...

304
00:17:24,826 --> 00:17:26,962
"Pipe down, you annoying nut job."

305
00:17:27,427 --> 00:17:29,021
I'd never say that.

306
00:17:29,945 --> 00:17:31,000
You think I'm crazy.

307
00:17:31,036 --> 00:17:32,920
No!

308
00:17:32,966 --> 00:17:35,301
You're colorful...

309
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:39,643
Colorful in a way that might
respond to medication.

310
00:17:39,675 --> 00:17:41,370
Well, you know...

311
00:17:41,417 --> 00:17:44,041
There's levels of crazy, Lynette.

312
00:17:44,087 --> 00:17:48,403
I mean, there are people like me
who just have a big personality.

313
00:17:48,438 --> 00:17:50,851
Then there are the kind of
people who do things like this.

314
00:17:51,658 --> 00:17:54,913
-Ah! Oh, my God! Knock it off!
-What is the matter with you?!

315
00:17:54,956 --> 00:17:58,183
What is wrong with you? What the
hell do you think you're doing?

316
00:17:58,218 --> 00:18:01,530
Oh, lighten up. Come on, it was a joke.

317
00:18:01,577 --> 00:18:03,920
No, well, it wasn't funny.
If you wanna kill yourself, fine,

318
00:18:03,968 --> 00:18:07,430
-but don't take me with you.
-Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't ya?

319
00:18:07,465 --> 00:18:10,521
You'd really like that,
if I killed myself.

320
00:18:10,555 --> 00:18:14,370
That is not what I'm saying.

321
00:18:14,417 --> 00:18:18,181
But if you did,
I'd find a way toarry on.

322
00:18:23,917 --> 00:18:25,261
Pull over.

323
00:18:25,307 --> 00:18:28,111
-Oh, lighten up. It's a joke.
-Pull the car over.

324
00:18:28,147 --> 00:18:30,451
-Nah.
-Pull it over!

325
00:18:30,497 --> 00:18:33,010
-Pull over, or I will jump out of this car.
-All right, all right, all right, all right.

326
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:37,113
I'm pulling over! Jeez!
What the hell are you doing?!

327
00:18:37,146 --> 00:18:39,292
Hitching my way...

328
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,441
To  the campsite!

329
00:18:42,635 --> 00:18:43,683
Nora!

330
00:18:43,727 --> 00:18:45,632
You can't be serious!

331
00:18:45,678 --> 00:18:47,541
Shut up! Just get out of my face!

332
00:18:47,578 --> 00:18:49,723
I'm not talking to you!

333
00:18:51,748 --> 00:18:54,171
All right, now look, you've
gone from crazy to stupid.

334
00:18:54,205 --> 00:18:55,671
This guy could be dangerous.

335
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:58,711
Well, then, it's your
lucky day, huh, Lynette?

336
00:18:59,528 --> 00:19:00,852
Shut up!

337
00:19:00,887 --> 00:19:02,142
See?

338
00:19:02,186 --> 00:19:05,320
This is what you do.
You just manipulate.

339
00:19:05,358 --> 00:19:08,552
You wormed your
way into my family.

340
00:19:08,595 --> 00:19:11,653
You conned your way into
coming on this trip with me,

341
00:19:11,687 --> 00:19:14,860
and now you wanna
force me into saving you.

342
00:19:14,898 --> 00:19:18,783
Well, forget it! You wanna go, go.

343
00:19:41,227 --> 00:19:44,681
No, I've tried that.
It wasn't enough power.

344
00:19:45,128 --> 00:19:46,742
Yeah, I'm way ahead of you.

345
00:19:46,776 --> 00:19:48,363
All right, here it goes.

346
00:19:51,196 --> 00:19:53,372
Ah, it worked! I'm a genius.

347
00:20:01,225 --> 00:20:03,630
Oh, hi. Um, I'm looking for Edie.

348
00:20:03,665 --> 00:20:04,850
She's out.

349
00:20:05,226 --> 00:20:08,460
-Ugh, God, where is everyone tonight?
-Anything I can do?

350
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:11,280
No, not unless you
can fix a fuse box.

351
00:20:11,326 --> 00:20:13,400
My science fair project
blew the power out.

352
00:20:13,438 --> 00:20:15,522
Oh, what's your project?

353
00:20:15,558 --> 00:20:17,572
Oh, uh, it's complicated.

354
00:20:17,615 --> 00:20:20,623
You think I'm too dumb to
understand your little science project?

355
00:20:20,656 --> 00:20:23,302
It's not little. I finished
third in the state twice.

356
00:20:23,338 --> 00:20:25,450
Now can you fix
the fuse box or not?

357
00:20:25,956 --> 00:20:29,270
Most houses built after 1990 are
wired through a circuit breaker.

358
00:20:29,308 --> 00:20:31,890
You didn't blow a fuse.
You tripped a breaker.

359
00:20:31,935 --> 00:20:35,592
Not to challenge a 2-time state science
fair almost-champion or anything.

360
00:20:38,096 --> 00:20:39,803
Let me grab a flashlight.

361
00:20:39,845 --> 00:20:42,931
Maybe you could also grab
a shirt... and some pants.

362
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:45,450
Pants would be nice.

363
00:20:47,345 --> 00:20:49,483
Susan, can I come in?

364
00:20:49,528 --> 00:20:52,550
I'm with a client. Take a number.

365
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:55,301
Susan, please.

366
00:20:58,065 --> 00:20:59,141
Everything I said

367
00:20:59,186 --> 00:21:01,731
came out of my own
insecurity and fear

368
00:21:01,757 --> 00:21:04,850
that I might, well,
I might disappoint you.

369
00:21:06,577 --> 00:21:09,070
I was gonna stay mad
at you another hour,

370
00:21:09,118 --> 00:21:11,582
but your damn accent
gets me every time.

371
00:21:11,618 --> 00:21:13,660
Blimey, you don't say?

372
00:21:13,696 --> 00:21:16,000
Don't push it.

373
00:21:38,568 --> 00:21:41,740
Oh, no, I don't mean to
break the flow, but I just, um...

374
00:21:42,417 --> 00:21:45,863
Look, I know that I'm only
your second lover ever,

375
00:21:45,897 --> 00:21:47,973
and that, I know
that means a lot,

376
00:21:48,018 --> 00:21:51,233
and I just don't want it
to mean... too much.

377
00:21:51,275 --> 00:21:53,453
I'm not following you.
What do you want it to mean?

378
00:21:53,495 --> 00:21:56,811
I mean, the last time you did this,
it turned into a lifetime commitment,

379
00:21:56,845 --> 00:21:58,691
And I'm just, I'm not ready for that.

380
00:21:58,727 --> 00:22:00,471
You think I am?

381
00:22:00,516 --> 00:22:04,842
Well, I assure you, I'm as capable
of having meaningless sex as you are.

382
00:22:06,087 --> 00:22:08,821
I have never had meaningless sex.

383
00:22:08,866 --> 00:22:10,700
So you were... You were
passionately in love,

384
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:13,850
and deeply committed to
all 11 of your conquests?

385
00:22:13,887 --> 00:22:17,601
Don't judge me,
Mr. Virgin... plus one!

386
00:22:17,646 --> 00:22:20,123
Okay, okay, we seem to have gotten
off on the wrong foot again.

387
00:22:20,156 --> 00:22:22,392
Susan...

388
00:22:22,776 --> 00:22:26,563
Cheerio? Bob's your uncle?

389
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:29,302
Get out.

390
00:22:30,076 --> 00:22:31,600
-Can't we at least talk?
-Why?

391
00:22:31,646 --> 00:22:33,332
You know, every time we do,
we just get angry.

392
00:22:33,365 --> 00:22:34,982
Well, we're still getting
to know each other,

393
00:22:35,025 --> 00:22:37,831
And that's good. You've
learned I'm a tad insecure,

394
00:22:37,868 --> 00:22:40,601
And I've learn... Well, you're
just a wee bit touchy.

395
00:22:40,646 --> 00:22:43,131
Okay, Ian, you know what?
This is not happening.

396
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:44,333
I am just going to sleep,

397
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:47,143
and you can just drive
me home in the morning.

398
00:22:56,346 --> 00:22:59,621
Uh, excuse me. I'm looking for
my son. Have you seen him?

399
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:02,832
Have you seen him?

400
00:23:03,627 --> 00:23:07,361
Excuse me, young man.
Have you seen this boy?

401
00:23:09,427 --> 00:23:12,142
Andrew! Oh, my God, thank God!

402
00:23:12,176 --> 00:23:13,371
What are you doing here?

403
00:23:13,416 --> 00:23:15,860
Looking for you.
How did you get that bruise?

404
00:23:15,898 --> 00:23:18,272
-It's none of your business.
-Andrew, please!

405
00:23:18,317 --> 00:23:21,282
Shouldn'you be at home,
taking care of your new husband?

406
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:22,472
How did you find out that...

407
00:23:22,517 --> 00:23:25,372
I read it in the paper.
You know, the one I sleep under.

408
00:23:25,408 --> 00:23:28,101
Andrew, you have every
right to be angry with me,

409
00:23:28,136 --> 00:23:29,783
but if you knew how sorry I am...

410
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:32,923
If you came here sucking after forgiveness,
you came to the wrong place.

411
00:23:32,957 --> 00:23:35,172
Andrew, please,
can't we just talk about this?

412
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:37,353
I'm your mother, for God sakes!
You're my son.

413
00:23:37,398 --> 00:23:40,750
No, you dumped your son at
a gas station seven months ago.

414
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:43,001
I'm somebody else now.

415
00:23:43,037 --> 00:23:44,750
Andrew.

416
00:23:47,367 --> 00:23:48,772
Andrew!

417
00:23:48,816 --> 00:23:51,473
Andrew, please!

418
00:23:53,346 --> 00:23:55,722
Andrew!

419
00:24:10,765 --> 00:24:12,512
What happened to your ride?

420
00:24:13,797 --> 00:24:15,231
The guy grabbed my boob,

421
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:18,521
so I hit him over the head
with his bong, and I got out.

422
00:24:22,775 --> 00:24:24,612
Look, I'm sorry I freaked
out there before.

423
00:24:24,655 --> 00:24:29,150
It's just, when you made that crack
about suicide, it just... kind of hit home.

424
00:24:29,708 --> 00:24:32,533
Oh, my God, Nora.

425
00:24:32,577 --> 00:24:35,043
Did you actually...

426
00:24:36,365 --> 00:24:40,361
Well, I'm... I'm very
sorry. I had no idea.

427
00:24:44,697 --> 00:24:47,123
But your life is better now, right?

428
00:24:47,168 --> 00:24:51,530
You have a beautiful daughter,
and you have that fun job at the...

429
00:24:51,566 --> 00:24:53,941
pancake house.

430
00:24:53,987 --> 00:24:56,021
Oh, yeah, my life's better.

431
00:24:56,055 --> 00:24:57,121
Yeah.

432
00:24:57,165 --> 00:25:01,300
But it's not your life.
Your life's perfect.

433
00:25:01,348 --> 00:25:05,540
Excuse me? Did you smoke that bong
before you beat the guy with it?

434
00:25:05,586 --> 00:25:09,752
It's just, you have it all. You have
the kids. You have the career.

435
00:25:09,786 --> 00:25:11,733
You have a husband.

436
00:25:11,777 --> 00:25:13,651
You're supermom.

437
00:25:13,698 --> 00:25:16,161
And you think that's easy?
Okay, I have a good life.

438
00:25:16,208 --> 00:25:19,482
Yes, yes, I am very lucky,
but I work 12 hours a day,

439
00:25:19,526 --> 00:25:22,771
and then I come home to
what seems like 33 children,

440
00:25:22,808 --> 00:25:25,392
and husban who refuses to get a job.

441
00:25:25,436 --> 00:25:29,743
And believe me, there is not a supermom
out there who wouldn't trade in her cape,

442
00:25:29,777 --> 00:25:32,033
for a chance to read
a book and get a massage

443
00:25:32,077 --> 00:25:34,521
by a man who has the decency
to leave when it's over.

444
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:37,921
Okay, sorry I brought it up.

445
00:25:41,037 --> 00:25:44,491
I'm sorry I said that about Tom.
He's doing his best to find a job.

446
00:25:44,537 --> 00:25:48,342
Well, you know, maybe he'd try a little
harder if he didn't hate advertising so much.

447
00:25:48,377 --> 00:25:50,741
He doesn't hate advertising.

448
00:25:50,787 --> 00:25:53,161
Last week, when he
came to pick up Kayla,

449
00:25:53,205 --> 00:25:56,123
And he'd just come from
some crappy interview,

450
00:25:56,168 --> 00:26:01,060
He said that he'd hated the
ad game for, like, freakin' ever,

451
00:26:01,098 --> 00:26:03,312
and would like to
bag the whole thing.

452
00:26:03,346 --> 00:26:05,632
He said that to you?

453
00:26:07,728 --> 00:26:09,762
He's never told me that.

454
00:26:09,807 --> 00:26:11,810
He's probably afraid to.

455
00:26:12,205 --> 00:26:14,313
Why would he be afraid?

456
00:26:14,355 --> 00:26:16,741
Probably because you're
the kind of woman who,

457
00:26:16,787 --> 00:26:19,142
When someone says they
wanna kill themselves,

458
00:26:19,175 --> 00:26:21,302
You say, "go ahead."

459
00:26:27,117 --> 00:26:30,860
-You sure you don't want to come in?
-No, I'm good.

460
00:26:33,255 --> 00:26:35,243
Uh, you really should
see what I'm doing,

461
00:26:35,275 --> 00:26:37,633
You know, for next time.

462
00:26:42,046 --> 00:26:44,990
Okay, here's the tripped switch.

463
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:50,553
So first, you move it to "off"...
to reset, then you pre it... to "on."

464
00:26:51,895 --> 00:26:54,243
-That's it?
-Yeah.

465
00:26:54,286 --> 00:26:56,840
You didn't have to come all
the way over here to do that.

466
00:26:56,876 --> 00:26:58,933
You could've just explained it to me.

467
00:26:58,965 --> 00:27:01,433
Yeah, I guess I could've.

468
00:27:02,147 --> 00:27:04,180
Well... hello there.

469
00:27:04,215 --> 00:27:05,572
Edie! Hi.

470
00:27:05,618 --> 00:27:06,902
Oh, sorry.

471
00:27:06,947 --> 00:27:09,301
Uh, he was just... He was helping
me get the lights back on.

472
00:27:09,335 --> 00:27:11,622
I overloaded my circuits.

473
00:27:11,658 --> 00:27:13,603
I can see that.

474
00:27:13,945 --> 00:27:16,021
Yeah, so she's doing
some big science project,

475
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:19,080
And she needed me to
explain how electricity works.

476
00:27:19,115 --> 00:27:21,310
I think that's called "irony."

477
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,362
Julie, where's your mom?

478
00:27:23,406 --> 00:27:25,512
She's on a trip.
Do you need something?

479
00:27:25,557 --> 00:27:30,033
Yeah, back when I could stand her,
I loaned her my CD player. I need it.

480
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:32,391
Oh, she took it to
the hospital for Mike.

481
00:27:32,427 --> 00:27:33,861
Oh, God.

482
00:27:33,907 --> 00:27:37,891
This florence nightingale
act is really chapping my ass.

483
00:27:38,297 --> 00:27:41,511
Hey, science guy,
I have an experiment for you.

484
00:27:41,547 --> 00:27:42,893
Go home,

485
00:27:42,935 --> 00:27:46,622
mix two ounces of gin,
a splash of vermouth,

486
00:27:46,666 --> 00:27:49,843
and see if it improves
my mood when I drink it.

487
00:27:52,658 --> 00:27:56,553
Julie, sweetie...
you're a good girl.

488
00:27:56,596 --> 00:27:59,023
Do yourself a favor and stay
away from my nephew.

489
00:27:59,067 --> 00:28:04,442
Trust me, I have no interest in swaggering,
muscle-bound juvenile delinquents.

490
00:28:04,826 --> 00:28:06,143
Honey...

491
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:08,240
that's what every good girl says,

492
00:28:08,277 --> 00:28:10,303
just before she becomes a bad girl.

493
00:28:10,778 --> 00:28:13,983
Trust me, I know.

494
00:28:18,805 --> 00:28:20,611
Except now when we're done,

495
00:28:20,656 --> 00:28:23,193
I don't have to proofread
your essay on "Ethan Frome."

496
00:28:23,238 --> 00:28:26,061
And I don't have to jump out
of a window. That's a nice change.

497
00:28:27,148 --> 00:28:30,232
Hey, how about I order
up a bottle of dom?

498
00:28:30,265 --> 00:28:32,190
Ooh, I like rich John!

499
00:28:37,806 --> 00:28:41,841
Hello? Oh! Uh, hi.

500
00:28:42,268 --> 00:28:45,823
Nothing, uh, you know, just, uh,
room service and a movie.

501
00:28:45,855 --> 00:28:47,473
What?

502
00:28:48,308 --> 00:28:50,802
Really? You're... You're kidding.

503
00:28:50,835 --> 00:28:53,300
Uh, no! I'm thrilled.

504
00:28:53,748 --> 00:28:56,431
It's, uh, room 424.

505
00:28:56,936 --> 00:28:59,350
Me, too. Bye.

506
00:28:59,397 --> 00:29:01,203
-You gotta get out of here.
-What?

507
00:29:01,235 --> 00:29:02,671
My fiancée's on her way up. Oh!

508
00:29:02,715 --> 00:29:05,093
-Your fiancée?
-She was supposed to come tomorrow.

509
00:29:05,128 --> 00:29:07,471
Guess she decided to
surprise me. Get dressed!

510
00:29:08,047 --> 00:29:10,321
Uh, you... You're engaged?
To who?!

511
00:29:10,367 --> 00:29:13,241
Her name's Tammy.
Where's your other shoe?!

512
00:29:13,276 --> 00:29:14,672
How could you do this to me?

513
00:29:14,717 --> 00:29:16,881
I would never have let you seduce me
if I knew you were getting married.

514
00:29:16,935 --> 00:29:18,902
Well, you didn't have any problem sleeping
with me when you were married!

515
00:29:18,936 --> 00:29:22,170
You knew about Carlos!
My cheating was upfront and honest.

516
00:29:22,207 --> 00:29:25,372
Look, Gaby, we don't have
time for this. Get moving.

517
00:29:25,416 --> 00:29:28,813
No, I'm not going anywhere. In fact,
I wanna meet the blushing bride.

518
00:29:28,845 --> 00:29:30,003
Listen to me, okay?

519
00:29:30,046 --> 00:29:33,033
Her name is Tammy Sinclair,
as in Sinclair Hotels,

520
00:29:33,067 --> 00:29:35,133
As in her father owns
this whole damn chain.

521
00:29:35,177 --> 00:29:38,763
So if she catches you in here,
I am totally screwed.

522
00:29:44,437 --> 00:29:46,720
Poodle!

523
00:29:48,676 --> 00:29:51,210
Look at you, surprising me.

524
00:29:51,255 --> 00:29:53,561
-Oh, I missed you.
-I missed you, too.

525
00:29:55,187 --> 00:29:57,681
Ugh, this room blows.

526
00:29:57,725 --> 00:29:59,453
Daddy was supposed to
hook us up with a suite.

527
00:29:59,487 --> 00:30:01,403
You know, you're right.

528
00:30:01,447 --> 00:30:03,300
Why don't we go down to the
front desk and demand one?

529
00:30:03,337 --> 00:30:05,532
-Come on.
-Oh, no. They're all booked.

530
00:30:10,127 --> 00:30:11,851
They call this a closet?

531
00:30:11,897 --> 00:30:14,090
Where am I suppod
to put all my stuff?

532
00:30:14,135 --> 00:30:18,021
You know, I could really use a drink.
Why don't we go down to the bar?

533
00:30:18,057 --> 00:30:22,142
I'm wiped. I just wanna stay in.

534
00:30:22,836 --> 00:30:25,352
Didn't you unpack yet?

535
00:30:25,727 --> 00:30:29,272
No, um, actually,
the zipper is stuck,

536
00:30:29,318 --> 00:30:33,202
but they have a guy
at the hotel that can fix it.

537
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:36,270
You know, I should probably go
ahead and take it down to the lobby.

538
00:30:36,305 --> 00:30:37,701
Now?

539
00:30:38,438 --> 00:30:40,302
I'm horny.

540
00:30:40,347 --> 00:30:42,182
So am I...

541
00:30:43,546 --> 00:30:46,692
But I will be a lot hornier...

542
00:30:46,728 --> 00:30:49,841
Once I get rid of this suitcase.

543
00:30:54,335 --> 00:30:56,020
Poodle?

544
00:30:56,065 --> 00:30:58,372
Where did this diamond
watch come from?

545
00:30:58,848 --> 00:31:00,752
Oh, shoot, um...

546
00:31:02,268 --> 00:31:04,902
That's what you get
for surprising me.

547
00:31:05,298 --> 00:31:07,703
I didn't get a chance to wrap it.

548
00:31:08,958 --> 00:31:11,573
You like it?

549
00:31:11,606 --> 00:31:14,150
I love it!

550
00:31:14,196 --> 00:31:18,231
-I'm never taking it off!
-Son of a bitch!

551
00:31:18,986 --> 00:31:20,980
Come here, you!

552
00:31:28,658 --> 00:31:29,951
John?

553
00:31:39,548 --> 00:31:43,092
John, where are you, damn it?

554
00:31:58,358 --> 00:32:01,531
Don't laugh.
I saved a bundle on airfare.

555
00:32:27,668 --> 00:32:29,560
Susan, I'm so...

556
00:32:57,836 --> 00:32:59,850
Your azaleas are breathtaking.

557
00:33:00,188 --> 00:33:01,311
Thank you.

558
00:33:02,696 --> 00:33:04,810
You should be very proud of them.

559
00:33:05,145 --> 00:33:08,501
Yeah, it's nice to know that I can
raise some things correctly.

560
00:33:09,295 --> 00:33:12,441
Darling, be patient.

561
00:33:12,955 --> 00:33:15,580
Andrew will come around.

562
00:33:15,625 --> 00:33:18,222
No, I don't think he will.

563
00:33:18,725 --> 00:33:20,333
I failed him.

564
00:33:20,378 --> 00:33:21,793
I think you're being
too hard on yourself.

565
00:33:21,826 --> 00:33:23,991
And you're not being hard enough.

566
00:33:24,036 --> 00:33:26,690
Stop saying that what
I did was understandable.

567
00:33:26,725 --> 00:33:28,722
I'm a mother who
abandoned her child.

568
00:33:28,758 --> 00:33:30,903
That's... unnatural.

569
00:33:30,948 --> 00:33:34,061
Bree, it's hot. You're tired.
Why don't you come inside?

570
00:33:34,106 --> 00:33:37,603
Because there is a bottle of chardonnay
in the refrigerator, and right now,

571
00:33:37,636 --> 00:33:41,103
this little chore is the only thing
that's keeping me from going inside

572
00:33:41,136 --> 00:33:43,162
and drinking the whole damn thing.

573
00:33:46,887 --> 00:33:48,822
Well...

574
00:33:49,996 --> 00:33:52,832
The azaleas really are lovely.

575
00:33:59,987 --> 00:34:02,642
Yes, they are, aren't they?

576
00:34:18,236 --> 00:34:20,051
Hi.

577
00:34:21,118 --> 00:34:24,283
Look, I'm sorry.

578
00:34:27,906 --> 00:34:29,992
Here's your watch.

579
00:34:30,927 --> 00:34:33,092
I guess I'll just buy Tammy a new one.

580
00:34:33,136 --> 00:34:36,853
Don't you mean her daddy will buy her a new
one and just launder the money through you?

581
00:34:36,888 --> 00:34:38,643
I don't blame you for being angry.

582
00:34:38,687 --> 00:34:41,133
All right, I should've told
you the truth from the start.

583
00:34:41,166 --> 00:34:44,951
But when I saw you there
in the moonlight,

584
00:34:44,997 --> 00:34:47,830
it took me right back
to when we were together.

585
00:34:49,567 --> 00:34:51,212
Me, too.

586
00:34:52,947 --> 00:34:54,903
Do you wanna sit down?

587
00:34:58,337 --> 00:35:00,911
You know, you're pretty
hard to stay mad at.

588
00:35:02,157 --> 00:35:03,153
Good,

589
00:35:03,196 --> 00:35:05,932
'cause I really didn't
want this to end badly.

590
00:35:05,968 --> 00:35:08,253
Who says it has to end?

591
00:35:09,905 --> 00:35:11,340
What are you talking about?

592
00:35:11,385 --> 00:35:14,223
Well, I'm single now,
and I thought we could maybe...

593
00:35:14,257 --> 00:35:17,730
Gaby... I'm getting married.

594
00:35:18,245 --> 00:35:21,160
Sure, and I was married
when we got together.

595
00:35:21,197 --> 00:35:22,810
Right, but that...

596
00:35:23,626 --> 00:35:25,342
is not how I'm gonna be married.

597
00:35:25,387 --> 00:35:29,190
Well, that's what I thought,
but trust me, marriage is hard.

598
00:35:29,228 --> 00:35:31,990
I know that, but...

599
00:35:32,028 --> 00:35:33,673
I love Tammy,

600
00:35:33,718 --> 00:35:36,031
And I don't wanna screw it up.

601
00:35:36,078 --> 00:35:38,592
'Cause enough of those screwups and...

602
00:35:38,626 --> 00:35:41,420
You just end up alone.

603
00:35:43,878 --> 00:35:46,672
Yeah, that can happen.

604
00:35:57,027 --> 00:35:59,151
Good-bye, Gabrielle.

605
00:36:12,767 --> 00:36:14,110
Um, hey, mister, uh,

606
00:36:14,157 --> 00:36:17,322
Could you spare a buck
or two? I'm really hungry.

607
00:36:21,268 --> 00:36:22,891
Hey, thanks!

608
00:36:22,938 --> 00:36:25,841
I'll give you $50 more,
you let me buy you lunch.

609
00:36:26,546 --> 00:36:29,551
Fries and a large root beer.

610
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:34,502
What am I gonna have
to do to earn this?

611
00:36:34,548 --> 00:36:36,460
I told you, I just wanna talk to you.

612
00:36:36,495 --> 00:36:39,020
-You're another reporter?
-No.

613
00:36:39,065 --> 00:36:43,350
You a youth pastor?
You trying to save my soul?

614
00:36:43,385 --> 00:36:45,620
Oh, you make it sound like a challenge.

615
00:36:45,656 --> 00:36:47,861
No, I just wanna
understand you, Andrew.

616
00:36:49,036 --> 00:36:51,501
Wait, how did you know my name?

617
00:36:54,828 --> 00:36:57,133
You're him, aren't you? You're, uh...

618
00:36:57,516 --> 00:36:59,450
The new husband.

619
00:36:59,485 --> 00:37:01,442
Orson.

620
00:37:02,238 --> 00:37:05,513
You know, I wouldn't talk to her.
At makes her think I'll listen to you?

621
00:37:06,236 --> 00:37:08,212
Your mother doesn't know I'm here.

622
00:37:09,438 --> 00:37:11,201
All right, dad.

623
00:37:11,247 --> 00:37:13,350
What do you wanna
talk about, dad?

624
00:37:13,396 --> 00:37:16,082
I wanna know how you survive out
here. What do you do for money?

625
00:37:18,167 --> 00:37:21,112
I ask. People give it to me.

626
00:37:22,388 --> 00:37:24,182
That's it?

627
00:37:25,336 --> 00:37:27,081
What do you wanna know?

628
00:37:27,128 --> 00:37:30,732
Have I done stuff for money
that I'm not proud of?

629
00:37:32,338 --> 00:37:37,470
Yeah, sure, but you figured that out as
soon I asked you what the $50 was for.

630
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:39,023
But, uh...

631
00:37:39,065 --> 00:37:40,890
Don't tell my mom.

632
00:37:40,935 --> 00:37:44,873
Or you know what? Do.
Who cares?

633
00:37:44,915 --> 00:37:48,143
Well, I think part of you wants
me to tell her because you know
how much it would hurt her.

634
00:37:48,645 --> 00:37:52,191
I mean, that's why you're out
here, isn't it? To punish her.

635
00:37:52,588 --> 00:37:55,743
When will you have punished
her enough, Andrew?

636
00:37:55,776 --> 00:37:57,373
When you turn to drugs
to numb the pain,

637
00:37:57,415 --> 00:38:00,162
or you catch a disease
you'll never be rid of?

638
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:02,872
Don't pretend to care
about me, all right?

639
00:38:02,916 --> 00:38:06,541
I do care about you,
because Bree cares about you,

640
00:38:06,825 --> 00:38:08,790
Because we're more
alike than you think.

641
00:38:10,278 --> 00:38:12,173
I know about rage.

642
00:38:12,596 --> 00:38:16,330
I know how it eats you up.
But rage goes away,

643
00:38:16,365 --> 00:38:18,350
and when it does,

644
00:38:18,807 --> 00:38:21,683
You're just left with
the mess you've made.

645
00:38:23,227 --> 00:38:25,092
Thks for lunch.

646
00:38:25,686 --> 00:38:29,140
You change your mind,
you know whereo find us.

647
00:38:43,908 --> 00:38:45,320
How's your back?

648
00:38:45,367 --> 00:38:47,682
If I don't breathe, great.

649
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:51,142
God, it has been so long
since my back has acted up.

650
00:38:51,186 --> 00:38:54,573
Then wham, out of the blue,
I'm crying by a tree stump.

651
00:38:54,607 --> 00:38:56,592
Well, you're under
a lot of stress.

652
00:38:56,636 --> 00:38:59,750
You got a new kid in the family.
You're job hunting.

653
00:38:59,797 --> 00:39:02,880
Ugh. Are we gonna fight about
that again? 'Cause if so,

654
00:39:02,917 --> 00:39:04,991
I'm gonna need those last
four muscle relaxants.

655
00:39:05,036 --> 00:39:09,633
No, I don't wanna fight.
In fact, I was thinking...

656
00:39:10,318 --> 00:39:13,190
If you can't find something
you like in advertising,

657
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:16,112
Maybe you should cast a wider net.

658
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,893
Meaning what?

659
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:22,112
You're a bright guy. Isn't there
anything else you might wanna do?

660
00:39:24,736 --> 00:39:26,700
I'd like to play bass for Aerosmith.

661
00:39:26,745 --> 00:39:28,671
Okay, let's call that the backup plan.

662
00:39:28,718 --> 00:39:32,282
But, seriously, don't you
have some road not taken,

663
00:39:32,316 --> 00:39:36,073
some dream you never got around to?

664
00:39:37,586 --> 00:39:39,830
I don't know, maybe.

665
00:39:40,437 --> 00:39:41,920
Maybe?

666
00:39:41,965 --> 00:39:45,002
I don't know. You get married.
You have kids and...

667
00:39:47,467 --> 00:39:49,461
You lose track of that stuff.

668
00:39:49,506 --> 00:39:51,433
Well, think about it, okay?

669
00:39:51,476 --> 00:39:55,791
Cause whatever you wanna do,
I'm in your corner.

670
00:39:57,445 --> 00:39:59,693
Man, did I luck out marrying you.

671
00:40:00,135 --> 00:40:02,760
Tell me something I don't know.

672
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:14,962
Hi, Mike.

673
00:40:15,478 --> 00:40:17,291
It's Edie.

674
00:40:19,047 --> 00:40:21,911
I'm sorry that I haven't
come by to visit.

675
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:28,060
Pretty rough luck, huh?

676
00:40:31,078 --> 00:40:33,361
Anyway, I'm, um...

677
00:40:33,407 --> 00:40:36,140
Here to pick up my CD player.

678
00:40:36,175 --> 00:40:38,411
So...

679
00:40:44,216 --> 00:40:47,840
Well, I hope you feel better soon.

680
00:41:02,758 --> 00:41:04,560
Damn!

681
00:41:05,427 --> 00:41:07,362
And that's with the coma.

682
00:41:23,605 --> 00:41:27,033
We all carry something with us.

683
00:41:27,858 --> 00:41:31,243
Of course, it's nice if we
travel with someone

684
00:41:31,348 --> 00:41:33,641
who can help lighten the load.

685
00:41:37,167 --> 00:41:41,583
But usually, it's easier to just drop
what we've been carrying,

686
00:41:41,715 --> 00:41:45,863
so we can get home
that much sooner...

687
00:41:49,608 --> 00:41:51,022
Assuming, of course,

688
00:41:51,048 --> 00:41:54,793
there will be someone there
to greet us when we arrive.

689
00:41:58,488 --> 00:42:00,882
Why do we clutch
at this baggage,

690
00:42:00,925 --> 00:42:04,201
even when we're
desperate to move on?

691
00:42:06,915 --> 00:42:10,460
Because we all know
there's a chance...

692
00:42:10,908 --> 00:42:14,060
we might let go too soon.
