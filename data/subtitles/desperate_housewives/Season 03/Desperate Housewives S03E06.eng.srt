1
00:00:00,117 --> 00:00:02,052
Previously on Desperate Housewives...

2
00:00:02,442 --> 00:00:03,840
Gabrielle got even...

3
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:06,110
So did I hurt you, or
should I keep trying?

4
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:07,450
Tom got an idea...

5
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,280
I'm gonna open up
a pizza parlor!

6
00:00:09,529 --> 00:00:10,737
Bree got a warning...

7
00:00:10,748 --> 00:00:12,720
He's a cold-blooded killer.

8
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,240
The police got a clue...

9
00:00:14,373 --> 00:00:16,806
Those blue marks,
I think it's a phone number.

10
00:00:17,896 --> 00:00:19,273
You've reached Mike Delfino.

11
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,116
This should never
have happened!

12
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:24,073
And the battle for Mike's
affection got ugly.

13
00:00:24,092 --> 00:00:25,538
How do you sleep at night?

14
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:28,011
Soon, with Mike on top of me.

15
00:00:32,228 --> 00:00:36,461
It is often said that confession
is good for the soul.

16
00:00:37,276 --> 00:00:40,323
No one knew this better
than a certain blonde,

17
00:00:40,506 --> 00:00:43,781
who had been confessing
her sins to Father O'Malley,

18
00:00:43,988 --> 00:00:46,441
once a week since
she was a child.

19
00:00:47,055 --> 00:00:48,693
As the years had passed,

20
00:00:48,865 --> 00:00:53,512
much to Father O'Malley's dismay,
a theme began to emerge.

21
00:00:54,957 --> 00:00:56,713
I seduced the cable guy again.

22
00:00:58,686 --> 00:01:01,073
I'm having a affair
with a folksinging duo.

23
00:01:03,286 --> 00:01:06,501
Last week, I let Rabbi
Lippman get to third base.

24
00:01:07,788 --> 00:01:10,100
And once she had been forgiven,

25
00:01:10,706 --> 00:01:13,410
Father O'Malley would
tell Edie Britt

26
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:17,201
to go out into the
world and sin no more.

27
00:01:19,075 --> 00:01:23,180
Unfortunately for Edie,
temptation seemed to be...

28
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,560
Hello there.

29
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:27,821
Everywhere.

30
00:01:31,705 --> 00:01:35,583
Edie, what were we like together...

31
00:01:36,537 --> 00:01:37,892
before the accident?

32
00:01:38,218 --> 00:01:39,101
What do you mean?

33
00:01:39,805 --> 00:01:42,750
You know, were we close?

34
00:01:44,545 --> 00:01:45,650
Honestly?

35
00:01:46,886 --> 00:01:49,530
We lived about 50 feet
from each other,

36
00:01:49,537 --> 00:01:52,090
and you barely
knew that I existed.

37
00:01:52,807 --> 00:01:53,830
Seriously?

38
00:01:54,805 --> 00:01:55,653
It's true.

39
00:01:55,986 --> 00:01:57,530
I mean, you weren't
rude or anything.

40
00:01:57,795 --> 00:02:01,122
We'd wave or exchange "hellos"
as we went to get our mail,

41
00:02:01,195 --> 00:02:03,123
but you never really looked at me.

44
00:02:08,568 --> 00:02:13,373
But if we weren't friends, why are
you here every day helping me?

45
00:02:14,627 --> 00:02:19,132
Because from the first
moment I laid eyes on you...

46
00:02:21,067 --> 00:02:23,052
I sort of fell in love with you.

47
00:02:27,758 --> 00:02:32,091
Yeah, and I'm not telling you this because
I expect anything, so you can just relax, okay?

48
00:02:34,107 --> 00:02:35,002
Okay.

49
00:02:35,486 --> 00:02:37,110
But when you do
come back home,

50
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:40,632
and we do run into each other
when we're getting our mail,

51
00:02:41,976 --> 00:02:43,790
I'd really appreciate it if you'd...

52
00:02:45,837 --> 00:02:47,263
just look at me.

53
00:02:49,357 --> 00:02:50,191
That's all.

54
00:02:52,707 --> 00:02:54,111
I'm looking at you now.

55
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:14,633
Yes, it's often said confession
is good for the soul.

56
00:03:15,148 --> 00:03:19,521
Mike Delfino and I made
out today, and it was great!

57
00:03:20,538 --> 00:03:26,410
But some confessions are
just bragging in disguise.

60
00:04:10,246 --> 00:04:14,851
There was nothing Bree Hodge
hated more than an unexpected...

61
00:04:15,578 --> 00:04:17,092
knock at the door.

62
00:04:17,886 --> 00:04:22,581
She was always certain it would
lead to a dagreeable surprise...

63
00:04:23,806 --> 00:04:26,912
Whether it be in the form of
a cosmetics saleswoman,

64
00:04:27,607 --> 00:04:31,691
religious Zealots
or extended family.

65
00:04:32,577 --> 00:04:35,561
But on this day,
the surprise awaiting Bree

66
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:40,161
was far more disagreeable than
she ever could have imagined.

67
00:04:41,688 --> 00:04:42,403
Hello, Bree.

68
00:04:42,668 --> 00:04:43,471
Carolyn.

69
00:04:44,567 --> 00:04:45,932
This isn't a very good time.

70
00:04:46,417 --> 00:04:47,162
I'm baking.

71
00:04:47,467 --> 00:04:48,001
Bree?

72
00:04:48,535 --> 00:04:49,410
Uh, hi.

73
00:04:49,637 --> 00:04:51,400
We haven't met.
I'm Harvey Bigsby,

74
00:04:51,597 --> 00:04:54,911
and I brought my wife
here to apologize.

75
00:04:56,646 --> 00:04:57,912
It's a soufflÃ©.

76
00:04:58,217 --> 00:04:59,581
And timing is everything.

77
00:04:59,938 --> 00:05:01,222
Oh, please, please, um...

78
00:05:02,318 --> 00:05:05,520
She's been under a great deal of
stress since Alma's disappearance,

79
00:05:05,658 --> 00:05:08,273
and she really hasn't been herself.

80
00:05:08,297 --> 00:05:10,842
Much of that was due to
the mexican painkillers

81
00:05:10,847 --> 00:05:13,402
that she was purchasing online,
but I put a stop to that.

82
00:05:15,996 --> 00:05:19,712
Well, Orson tells me that the
two of you were very close,

83
00:05:19,725 --> 00:05:23,602
and out of respect for that
friendship, I'm all ears.

84
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:28,220
After thinking it over, I realized
that maybe I was out of line.

85
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:32,182
I was definitely out of lin with
the terrible accusations that I made.

86
00:05:32,587 --> 00:05:35,081
I'm deeply sorry for
the pain that I caused.

87
00:05:35,328 --> 00:05:37,803
I hope that you can find it
in your heart to forgive me.

88
00:05:40,177 --> 00:05:43,473
Well, I can appreciate how difficult
that must have been for you.

89
00:05:46,788 --> 00:05:48,110
Apology accepted.

90
00:05:50,036 --> 00:05:51,060
I'm so relieved.

91
00:05:51,465 --> 00:05:52,470
As am I.

92
00:05:52,568 --> 00:05:56,752
Well, you don't know how rusty
my golf game's gotten without
this one keeping me on my toes.

93
00:05:56,917 --> 00:05:59,860
Well, perhaps we can all get together
for dinner at the club sometime.

94
00:05:59,986 --> 00:06:01,191
That sounds lovely.

95
00:06:02,018 --> 00:06:02,610
Great.

96
00:06:05,225 --> 00:06:06,953
Darling, you are amazing,
you know that?

97
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:11,152
To rise above all that
unpleasantness with such dignity.

98
00:06:11,198 --> 00:06:12,772
Well, thank you, darling.

99
00:06:13,115 --> 00:06:14,891
But if you think for one second

100
00:06:15,117 --> 00:06:18,333
that I'm gonna break bread with
that malicious, pill-popping shrew,

101
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:19,902
you're out of your mind.

102
00:06:43,577 --> 00:06:45,601
Hey, Susan! Whatcha doing?

103
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:49,361
I just dropped my trowel. Thanks.

104
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:53,030
All  righty then,
you have a nice day.

105
00:06:54,508 --> 00:06:55,280
Bye-bye.

106
00:06:57,598 --> 00:06:58,531
S usan?

107
00:06:59,307 --> 00:07:00,090
Ian!

108
00:07:00,575 --> 00:07:01,661
What a surprise.

109
00:07:01,748 --> 00:07:04,350
Were you, um, were
you hiding from me?

110
00:07:04,577 --> 00:07:06,532
Uh, a little.

111
00:07:06,698 --> 00:07:07,193
I...

112
00:07:07,985 --> 00:07:09,433
Just, the last time
we saw each other,

113
00:07:09,436 --> 00:07:12,590
it was so awkward
and complicated.

114
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,320
Water under the bridge.

115
00:07:14,405 --> 00:07:16,320
And besides, this
is strictly business.

116
00:07:16,627 --> 00:07:19,061
I'm throwing a party for an
editor friend in from London,

117
00:07:19,075 --> 00:07:20,570
and I thought you
two should meet.

118
00:07:20,836 --> 00:07:22,511
You could bring a date if you want.

119
00:07:23,278 --> 00:07:26,020
Speaking of which, uh,
how are things with Mike?

120
00:07:26,796 --> 00:07:30,352
Oh, uh, they're moving along.

121
00:07:31,577 --> 00:07:32,820
It's a process.

122
00:07:33,216 --> 00:07:36,133
And the, uh, blonde woman who's
been visiting him every day,

123
00:07:36,138 --> 00:07:37,830
is she part of the process?

124
00:07:37,948 --> 00:07:39,743
Uh, Edie? Oh, she's...

125
00:07:40,395 --> 00:07:41,491
just a neighbor.

126
00:07:42,485 --> 00:07:45,880
She visits Mike after
her hepatitis C treatments.

127
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,383
Well, I do hope you
can come to the party...

128
00:07:50,767 --> 00:07:52,650
so you can meet my editor friend.

129
00:07:53,095 --> 00:07:55,651
I just, I just don't think
that's a good idea.

130
00:07:56,515 --> 00:07:57,332
Right.

131
00:07:57,975 --> 00:08:00,331
Well, at least I, uh,
I got to see you.

132
00:08:02,645 --> 00:08:03,583
You have...

133
00:08:13,338 --> 00:08:16,060
This is ludicrous,
the Biedermeier armoire.

134
00:08:16,207 --> 00:08:19,442
It's my understanding that your
client doesn't even like antiques.

135
00:08:20,475 --> 00:08:21,533
Totally immaterial.

136
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,553
It's a valuable asset.

137
00:08:24,328 --> 00:08:25,092
Fine.

138
00:08:25,247 --> 00:08:27,140
Let's discuss the Kosta Boda vase.

139
00:08:27,145 --> 00:08:29,633
Nope, it's a premarital acquisition.

140
00:08:30,298 --> 00:08:31,951
We can verify that with receipts.

141
00:08:34,035 --> 00:08:35,772
It was a gift to Mr. Solis.

142
00:08:35,935 --> 00:08:37,951
Maybe you were sick that
day at law school, Myron,

143
00:08:38,115 --> 00:08:39,973
but it's called community property.

144
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,336
Don't patronize me, Kenny.

145
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,923
We're prepared to go
to the mat on this one.

146
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:45,318
Oh, enough. Just give
her what she wants.

147
00:08:45,445 --> 00:08:47,333
Look, I'm sick of fighting.
It's just stuff.

148
00:08:47,725 --> 00:08:49,420
I'd like a moment
alone with my client.

149
00:08:49,425 --> 00:08:51,233
This has been going
on for months. I'm done.

150
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:53,423
Draw up the papers.
I'll sign whatever.

151
00:08:54,058 --> 00:08:56,422
You're giving me everything
I want? Just like that?

152
00:08:56,976 --> 00:08:58,193
Just like that.

153
00:09:00,638 --> 00:09:03,150
We expect to see the paperwork
by the end of business.

154
00:09:04,688 --> 00:09:06,400
How sweet is that?

155
00:09:07,657 --> 00:09:09,003
We nailed their asses.

156
00:09:11,415 --> 00:09:15,441
Mrs. Solis, they complely folded.

157
00:09:16,855 --> 00:09:19,103
That's the thing,
Carlos doesn't fold.

158
00:09:19,776 --> 00:09:21,741
That son of a bitch
is up to something.

159
00:09:27,147 --> 00:09:29,132
Before you come in,
cover your eyes.

160
00:09:29,427 --> 00:09:31,001
-Tom, I...
-Do it!

161
00:09:33,457 --> 00:09:34,701
Okay, now...

162
00:09:35,686 --> 00:09:38,711
When I say "open,"
don't look with your eyes.

163
00:09:38,776 --> 00:09:41,181
look with your imagination.

164
00:09:41,288 --> 00:09:42,012
Okay.

165
00:09:42,948 --> 00:09:44,471
Okay. Open.

166
00:09:47,047 --> 00:09:47,981
Oh, dear God.

167
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:49,902
Damn it, you looked with your eyes!

168
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:51,173
It's a dump!

169
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:52,430
What are you thinking?

170
00:09:52,435 --> 00:09:54,561
Oh, I'll grant you,
it's a fixer-upper.

171
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:56,003
It's a burner-downer.

172
00:09:56,558 --> 00:09:58,251
Come on, honey, go with me.

173
00:09:58,278 --> 00:10:00,842
We can put in booths with
checkered tablecloths,

174
00:10:01,065 --> 00:10:04,132
a jukebox, a big-screen
to watch sports on.

175
00:10:04,857 --> 00:10:07,180
How can you not see
the potential in this place?

176
00:10:07,266 --> 00:10:09,201
Well, I just don't.

177
00:10:09,288 --> 00:10:12,291
Tom, you know how I feel
about this pizza thing.

178
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,803
Well, hopefully,
it'll grow on you.

179
00:10:17,696 --> 00:10:18,280
Don't...

180
00:10:18,828 --> 00:10:20,881
Tell me you didn't sign a lease.

181
00:10:22,796 --> 00:10:24,731
There's gonna be a dartboard!

182
00:10:25,145 --> 00:10:26,192
Tom!

183
00:10:26,287 --> 00:10:27,143
No...

184
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:29,773
There were multiple offers.
I had to move fast.

185
00:10:29,905 --> 00:10:31,950
You leased a building
without telling me?

186
00:10:31,955 --> 00:10:33,180
Well, maybe I didn't tell
you because I knew

187
00:10:33,188 --> 00:10:36,371
you'd try and talk me out of the
best opportunity in my life.

188
00:10:39,336 --> 00:10:39,992
Okay.

189
00:10:40,758 --> 00:10:42,690
Okay, here's what
we're going to do.

190
00:10:42,795 --> 00:10:45,971
You said there were multiple
offers, so we can sublease.

191
00:10:46,316 --> 00:10:48,211
Now let's get the hell out of here.

192
00:10:49,188 --> 00:10:51,310
You said you'd support my dream.

193
00:10:52,006 --> 00:10:55,461
My mistake. I assumed you'd have
a dream worth supporting.

194
00:10:57,608 --> 00:10:58,871
I'm gonna stay here tonight.

195
00:10:59,805 --> 00:11:00,563
Fine.

196
00:11:15,386 --> 00:11:17,010
Two lemonades for the victors.

197
00:11:17,178 --> 00:11:19,932
You  keep playing like this, Bree,
and we are a cinch for the finals.

198
00:11:20,818 --> 00:11:21,853
Hello, Tish.

199
00:11:22,155 --> 00:11:22,972
Hello, Rebecca.

200
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:27,391
Did you see that? She just
deliberately snubbed me.

201
00:11:27,426 --> 00:11:29,172
Maybe she didn't notice you.

202
00:11:29,177 --> 00:11:31,091
Rebecca, I just spoke to her.

203
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:33,610
And  call me paranoid,
but Amy Griswold did

204
00:11:33,616 --> 00:11:36,031
the same thing to me on
the golf course last week.

205
00:11:36,476 --> 00:11:37,841
What is going on?

206
00:11:38,847 --> 00:11:39,760
You really don't know?

207
00:11:39,828 --> 00:11:41,623
No! I have no idea. What?

208
00:11:41,927 --> 00:11:44,423
Tish is very good friends
with Carolyn Bigsby.

209
00:11:45,575 --> 00:11:47,050
Carolyn knows Tish?

210
00:11:47,086 --> 00:11:48,440
She knows everyone.

211
00:11:48,668 --> 00:11:51,963
Anyway, Tish won't talk to you
because you married Orson

212
00:11:51,998 --> 00:11:54,742
even after Carolyn told
you that he killed his wife.

213
00:11:54,977 --> 00:11:57,782
That is ridiculous.
Orson did not kill Alma.

214
00:11:57,877 --> 00:12:01,292
And besides, Carolyn just apologized
to me for that yesterday.

215
00:12:01,686 --> 00:12:03,720
Well, maybe that hasn't
gotten back to Tish.

216
00:12:03,948 --> 00:12:06,072
Oh, you don't believe any
of that nonsense, do you?

217
00:12:08,788 --> 00:12:09,623
Do you?

218
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:12,763
Bree, you're the best doubles
partner I've ever had.

219
00:12:12,908 --> 00:12:14,663
Can we talk about this
after the tournament?

220
00:12:25,427 --> 00:12:26,141
Hello.

221
00:12:26,305 --> 00:12:28,470
I'd like to make a reservation
for this evening,

222
00:12:28,476 --> 00:12:31,540
under the names Hodge
and Bigsby, and, um,

223
00:12:32,025 --> 00:12:34,890
we'll be needing a table
in the center of the room.

224
00:12:35,786 --> 00:12:37,300
How long will Daddy be gone?

225
00:12:37,438 --> 00:12:39,310
Well, that sort of depends on Daddy.

226
00:12:39,765 --> 00:12:41,731
Are you two mad at each other?

227
00:12:41,816 --> 00:12:42,591
Yeah.

228
00:12:43,016 --> 00:12:43,651
A little.

229
00:12:44,057 --> 00:12:44,912
But that's okay.

230
00:12:44,918 --> 00:12:46,913
That's okay. We still love
each other very much.

231
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:51,332
But just like kids, sometimes grown-ups
throw tantrums and need a time-out.

232
00:12:51,486 --> 00:12:53,440
Why can't he take a
time-out in his room?

233
00:12:53,446 --> 00:12:56,372
'Cause he decided to take
it in his pizza place.

234
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:58,883
No fair.
That sounds fun.

235
00:12:59,218 --> 00:13:01,112
Not this pizza place. It's a rat hole.

236
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,932
But once your Dad
comes to his senses,

237
00:13:03,935 --> 00:13:07,482
and stops being petulant,
he'll come home.

238
00:13:07,775 --> 00:13:08,710
What's "petulant"?

239
00:13:08,717 --> 00:13:15,520
It means childish, stubborn, careless
with my money and your futures.

240
00:13:15,816 --> 00:13:16,431
Huh?

241
00:13:16,716 --> 00:13:19,041
It's a grown-up word, and
when Daddy comes home,

242
00:13:19,058 --> 00:13:20,920
you'll learn a new one...

243
00:13:23,646 --> 00:13:24,542
Grovel.

244
00:13:27,287 --> 00:13:28,780
They got in a really big fight.

245
00:13:28,868 --> 00:13:30,372
Daddy's sleeping at the restaurant.

246
00:13:30,615 --> 00:13:33,193
No, no, it's good that
you told me, sweet pea.

247
00:13:33,455 --> 00:13:36,151
You keep those little
ears open, okay?

248
00:13:36,408 --> 00:13:37,612
Okay. Bye, Mom.

249
00:13:37,698 --> 00:13:38,242
Bye.

250
00:13:41,657 --> 00:13:43,781
Oh, hey, that's for me. I'll take that.

251
00:13:44,687 --> 00:13:45,571
Okay.

252
00:13:57,647 --> 00:13:59,281
Well, I'm beat.
I'm gonna take a nap.

253
00:13:59,607 --> 00:14:00,401
Uh, hold it.

254
00:14:01,275 --> 00:14:02,532
You're a sweaty mess.

255
00:14:03,267 --> 00:14:04,312
So? I was working out.

256
00:14:04,538 --> 00:14:07,372
So you're not laying on anything in
this house until you take a shower.

257
00:14:08,586 --> 00:14:09,422
Fair enough.

258
00:14:09,726 --> 00:14:11,080
It's all yours now, right?

259
00:14:35,196 --> 00:14:36,182
I don't know, Myron.

260
00:14:36,186 --> 00:14:37,730
It's a bunch of legal mumbo jumbo.

261
00:14:37,748 --> 00:14:39,422
Just read it and call me back.

262
00:14:43,037 --> 00:14:43,853
Crap!

263
00:15:04,315 --> 00:15:04,840
What?

264
00:15:06,095 --> 00:15:07,892
Why did you put those shorts back on?

265
00:15:09,338 --> 00:15:10,133
Why do you care?

266
00:15:10,317 --> 00:15:14,122
Uh, it's just that they're filthy,
anI was gonna wash 'em for you.

267
00:15:15,168 --> 00:15:16,641
You wanna wash my shorts?

268
00:15:17,526 --> 00:15:21,330
I don't want to, but if you wear them one
more time they're gonna ask me themselves.

269
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:31,083
Wait a minute.

270
00:15:31,906 --> 00:15:33,403
I forgot something in the pocket.

271
00:15:40,318 --> 00:15:41,282
No bleach.

272
00:15:41,897 --> 00:15:42,752
Got  it.

273
00:15:44,935 --> 00:15:46,613
So it's a job contract?

274
00:15:47,028 --> 00:15:50,801
Yeah, Welch and Simon are offering him
$2 million over 3 years, plus stock options.

275
00:15:51,068 --> 00:15:52,370
Well, that's fantastic!

276
00:15:52,578 --> 00:15:53,923
I get half, right?

277
00:15:53,966 --> 00:15:54,800
Well, no.

278
00:15:54,966 --> 00:15:57,681
If you're legally divorced
when he signs the contract,

279
00:15:57,696 --> 00:15:58,941
then you don't see a dime.

280
00:15:59,076 --> 00:16:01,801
That conniving, underhanded snake!

281
00:16:02,018 --> 00:16:03,603
Thank God I broke into his desk.

282
00:16:03,615 --> 00:16:07,503
At least now we know why he was
so quick to fold on your settlement.

283
00:16:08,018 --> 00:16:10,863
All right, well, let's just say something
happened to postpone the divorce.

284
00:16:11,165 --> 00:16:13,250
I would still get my share
of that $2 million, right?

285
00:16:13,357 --> 00:16:15,441
Well, in theory, but...

286
00:16:15,758 --> 00:16:17,142
How would you manage that?

287
00:16:17,758 --> 00:16:21,230
I know how Carlos thinks. More
importantly, what he thinks with.

288
00:16:33,438 --> 00:16:35,300
-Was that Susan Mayer?
-Yeah. Why?

289
00:16:35,526 --> 00:16:37,701
Mr. Delfino asked not to be disturbed.

290
00:16:38,577 --> 00:16:40,493
Mike? It's me.

291
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:42,630
Are you decent?

292
00:16:59,575 --> 00:17:00,610
Hey, Susan.

293
00:17:01,385 --> 00:17:02,481
Hey, you.

294
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:09,190
Whatcha doing?

295
00:17:09,715 --> 00:17:12,363
I suckered McCluskey into
taking the kids for a while,

296
00:17:12,395 --> 00:17:15,602
so I could kick back and
catch up with my old friend...

297
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:17,220
Margarita.

298
00:17:18,377 --> 00:17:19,491
You care to join us?

299
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:21,992
Believe me, I would
love to, but, um...

300
00:17:22,347 --> 00:17:24,623
I gotta get dinner started for Julie.

301
00:17:25,098 --> 00:17:25,913
Okay.

302
00:17:30,185 --> 00:17:31,503
Oh, you know, what the hell?

303
00:17:31,687 --> 00:17:32,823
She's 16.

304
00:17:33,096 --> 00:17:36,042
If she hasn't figured out how to
feed herself by now, I've failed.

305
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:43,581
That's nice.

306
00:17:45,406 --> 00:17:46,570
So where were we?

307
00:17:46,938 --> 00:17:50,373
You were trying to figure out how
to kill Edie without doing time.

308
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:51,540
Oh, right.

309
00:17:52,115 --> 00:17:54,933
Oh, I wish Paul Young was still
around. He'd know what to do.

310
00:17:58,206 --> 00:18:00,431
Fine, Gaby! Don't say hi!

311
00:18:01,968 --> 00:18:02,580
Hey!

312
00:18:03,255 --> 00:18:04,882
Cocktails? Nobody called me?

313
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:06,283
It was spur-of-the-moment.

314
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:08,531
We're numbing the pain
of our miserab lives.

315
00:18:10,138 --> 00:18:13,891
Well, I was trying to do that with
exercise but why risk a heart attack?

316
00:18:14,236 --> 00:18:15,432
Make mine a double!

317
00:18:17,425 --> 00:18:19,401
I don't recognize her.

318
00:18:20,526 --> 00:18:21,263
Who is she?

319
00:18:22,765 --> 00:18:24,112
That's what we're
trying to figure out.

320
00:18:24,418 --> 00:18:26,401
Your phone number was
written on her hand.

321
00:18:28,096 --> 00:18:29,790
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

322
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,970
He's had a bit of memory loss.

323
00:18:32,488 --> 00:18:34,413
After 2004, things are...

324
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:35,601
fuzzy.

325
00:18:36,038 --> 00:18:37,032
No memory, huh?

326
00:18:37,977 --> 00:18:38,891
That's convenient.

327
00:18:41,305 --> 00:18:43,662
Well, thank you for
your time, Mr. Delfino.

328
00:18:47,337 --> 00:18:49,271
You  killed a cop once, didn't you?

329
00:18:51,178 --> 00:18:52,873
That was self-defense.

330
00:18:53,505 --> 00:18:55,611
Hope it wasn't just beginner's luck.

331
00:18:57,408 --> 00:18:59,682
You wanna charge me
with something, go ahead.

332
00:19:00,585 --> 00:19:02,692
Otherwise, get the
hell out of my room.

333
00:19:04,646 --> 00:19:07,331
Were you always this
angry, Mr. Delfino,

334
00:19:08,017 --> 00:19:09,450
or can't you remember?

335
00:19:23,975 --> 00:19:27,272
So do you sell by the slice,
or do I gotta buy a whole pie?

336
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:29,800
What are you doing here?

337
00:19:29,906 --> 00:19:31,380
I knew how hard
you were working,

338
00:19:31,715 --> 00:19:34,351
So I figured I'd bring you
a little something to eat...

339
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:38,543
and drink.

340
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:43,900
You know, I can't pronounce this wine,

341
00:19:43,907 --> 00:19:49,410
which means it's either really
expensive or I have had too much.

342
00:19:49,667 --> 00:19:53,061
I can't believe that Lynette
doesn't just love this place.

343
00:19:53,696 --> 00:19:58,312
And if you ask me,
she's just a negative nellie.

344
00:19:58,316 --> 00:20:00,832
She's just being realistic. I mean,
the restaurant business is...

345
00:20:00,856 --> 00:20:02,162
- brutal, it's...
- Tom.

346
00:20:02,905 --> 00:20:05,993
Listen to me, okay, 'cause
I'm a very intuitive person,

347
00:20:06,948 --> 00:20:11,672
and you have a real aura
of success about you.

348
00:20:14,418 --> 00:20:15,290
Come on.

349
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:16,890
I'm serious.

350
00:20:18,807 --> 00:20:20,260
I believe in you,

351
00:20:21,586 --> 00:20:22,600
Tom Scavo.

352
00:20:22,746 --> 00:20:23,721
Thank you...

353
00:20:27,336 --> 00:20:29,741
Wait, wait, what,
what just happened?

354
00:20:30,265 --> 00:20:32,260
-We kissed.
-No, you kissed me.

355
00:20:32,266 --> 00:20:34,902
-No, no, no, you wanted me to.
-No, no, no, no, no, I didn't.

356
00:20:36,977 --> 00:20:37,950
Really?

357
00:20:38,648 --> 00:20:39,781
Cause this is you.

358
00:20:40,378 --> 00:20:41,482
My wife doesn't get me.

359
00:20:41,595 --> 00:20:45,313
Hey, let's have some more wine
alone, in a deserted building.

360
00:20:45,317 --> 00:20:48,012
I was just looking to vent.
I wasn't looking for anything more.

361
00:20:48,165 --> 00:20:50,252
Okay, but when opportunity knocks...

362
00:20:50,257 --> 00:20:51,653
Nora, please!

363
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:54,632
I love my wife!

364
00:20:56,387 --> 00:20:57,260
Really?

365
00:20:58,527 --> 00:21:01,021
You mean, the one who
thinks that you're a loser?

366
00:21:01,985 --> 00:21:05,131
No, the one that loves me enough
to keep me from screwing up.

367
00:21:06,075 --> 00:21:09,023
And I think it's about time
I got back home to her.

368
00:21:09,776 --> 00:21:10,841
You led me on.

369
00:21:12,017 --> 00:21:13,262
You shouldn't have done that.

370
00:21:25,345 --> 00:21:28,850
I'm just gonna say it.
Tequila makes me happy.

371
00:21:30,426 --> 00:21:33,562
Yeah, we're drinking on the porch.
You got a problem with that?

372
00:21:34,565 --> 00:21:37,071
Oh, I know them. They live on Cypress.

373
00:21:37,075 --> 00:21:40,382
They just celebrated their
53rd wedding anniversary.

374
00:21:40,617 --> 00:21:41,482
Show-offs.

375
00:21:41,588 --> 00:21:42,873
Don't worry. It won't last.

376
00:21:43,175 --> 00:21:45,372
You're just fooling yourselves!

377
00:21:45,518 --> 00:21:46,852
Hey, I know them.

378
00:21:47,096 --> 00:21:49,222
Oh, 53 years.

379
00:21:49,465 --> 00:21:51,032
What do you think their secret is?

380
00:21:51,047 --> 00:21:52,503
I'll take a wild guess.

381
00:21:52,938 --> 00:21:55,040
The man never opened a pizza place.

382
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:57,233
Oh, I just thought of something.

383
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:01,803
I'm never gonna celebrate
a 53rd wedding anniversary.

384
00:22:01,815 --> 00:22:04,073
I'd have to live into my 90s.

385
00:22:05,836 --> 00:22:08,353
Oh, my God. I'm gonna die.

386
00:22:08,925 --> 00:22:09,883
Bite on this.

387
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:16,053
Can I tell you guys something...
something I can only tell you guys?

388
00:22:16,186 --> 00:22:18,892
Oh, God, here she goes again.
What grade is he in?

389
00:22:19,807 --> 00:22:22,152
Not what I was gonna say.
What I was gonna say,

390
00:22:22,898 --> 00:22:25,750
is with all his conniving and trickery,

391
00:22:26,067 --> 00:22:27,492
I still love Carlos.

392
00:22:27,837 --> 00:22:29,180
Yeah, he's hot.

393
00:22:31,728 --> 00:22:36,322
Anyway, what if I never find
that passion with anybody else?

394
00:22:36,758 --> 00:22:40,343
Well, maybe you should try
to patch things up with him.

395
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:44,472
Nah, I already paid a lawyer.
I'm taking him down.

396
00:22:45,175 --> 00:22:48,732
I brought this on myself. I tell Tom,
"I want you to be your own man".

397
00:22:48,745 --> 00:22:50,651
But the truth is, I don't.

398
00:22:51,387 --> 00:22:56,442
I want him to have what
he wants if it's what I want.

399
00:22:58,237 --> 00:23:00,901
I'm a bitch with a capital "C".

400
00:23:00,927 --> 00:23:02,462
No! No, you're not!

401
00:23:02,477 --> 00:23:05,971
You're a great wife
and a great mother.

402
00:23:08,397 --> 00:23:11,212
Although... don't you have children?

403
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:13,902
I had passion with Mike...

404
00:23:15,258 --> 00:23:16,432
And drama.

405
00:23:17,017 --> 00:23:18,503
Lots of drama.

406
00:23:19,277 --> 00:23:21,663
Love isn't supposed to be that hard.

407
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,681
Oh, sweetie!

408
00:23:25,906 --> 00:23:29,872
But, you know, with Ian,
everything was always easy.

409
00:23:30,007 --> 00:23:34,383
You know, that's the kind of guy I could
see myself living into my 90s with.

410
00:23:34,576 --> 00:23:36,510
So go to Ian!

411
00:23:36,726 --> 00:23:39,580
Tell him you made the wrong choice,
and he's the one you wanna be with.

412
00:23:39,757 --> 00:23:41,311
What have you got to lose?

413
00:23:41,765 --> 00:23:42,930
Excuse me, ladies?

414
00:23:44,786 --> 00:23:47,271
Look, Susan, God called you a cab.

415
00:23:47,438 --> 00:23:51,902
I'm looking for, uh, 4347.
Ida Greenberg?

416
00:23:58,377 --> 00:23:59,992
I'm Ida Greenberg!

417
00:24:00,997 --> 00:24:02,423
Yeah, you are!

418
00:24:02,638 --> 00:24:03,490
See you later!

419
00:24:03,696 --> 00:24:04,732
Go, Ida!

420
00:24:04,775 --> 00:24:06,373
Go, Ida!

421
00:24:23,586 --> 00:24:24,463
Susan.

422
00:24:25,265 --> 00:24:26,140
You came.

423
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:28,402
Of course I came.

424
00:24:30,446 --> 00:24:33,841
Oh, I just love your house.
It always smells like you.

425
00:24:34,615 --> 00:24:35,752
Oh, my Gosh!

426
00:24:37,255 --> 00:24:39,153
Is the thing... is that tonight?

427
00:24:39,345 --> 00:24:41,251
Well, yes. Isn't that why you're here?

428
00:24:41,335 --> 00:24:43,240
No! No, no!

429
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:46,462
Actually, I just... I just
had something to tell you.

430
00:24:47,228 --> 00:24:50,521
Well, of course. Ah, Doug, see
if you can find Judith for me.

431
00:24:52,346 --> 00:24:53,053
Thank you.

432
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:56,553
Well, as long as you're here, I want you to
meet that editor I was telling you about.

433
00:24:56,567 --> 00:25:00,863
Oh, I don't think that's a good idea,
cause I didn't really bring my "a" game.

434
00:25:01,106 --> 00:25:02,090
Is it hot?

435
00:25:03,197 --> 00:25:04,383
Are you sloshed?

436
00:25:06,036 --> 00:25:06,983
Susan!

437
00:25:07,107 --> 00:25:10,783
Oh, is this the Susan you've
been telling us all about?

438
00:25:10,938 --> 00:25:12,853
Yes, this is she.

439
00:25:12,866 --> 00:25:14,761
Could you, um, give us a moment?

440
00:25:14,777 --> 00:25:16,113
Oh, of course.

441
00:25:20,196 --> 00:25:21,510
What's going on?

442
00:25:21,688 --> 00:25:25,651
Nothing. I just had a few drinks
with my girlfriends, and thank God,

443
00:25:25,655 --> 00:25:30,641
because it gave me the courage to come over
here and tell you what's really in my heart.

444
00:25:32,987 --> 00:25:33,673
Go on.

445
00:25:35,536 --> 00:25:38,611
But first, I think I should
use the powder room.

446
00:25:38,935 --> 00:25:42,001
Uh, oh... of course.
It's, um, it's over there.

447
00:25:48,367 --> 00:25:50,002
She seems nice, Ian.

448
00:25:50,068 --> 00:25:53,622
Oh, yes, she's, um,
she's absolutely delightful.

449
00:26:01,847 --> 00:26:05,222
Oh, I'm so sorry that
you had to see that.

450
00:26:05,336 --> 00:26:07,263
I see you've met Judith.

451
00:26:13,008 --> 00:26:16,480
So with a hundred bucks riding
on it, the pressure's on me now.

452
00:26:16,526 --> 00:26:22,533
I reach into my bag, I grab my 4-iron
and bada bing... hole in one.

453
00:26:22,617 --> 00:26:25,382
And there's been no living
with him ever since.

454
00:26:26,077 --> 00:26:28,672
Did I not tell you how hilarious
these two are together?

455
00:26:28,675 --> 00:26:31,482
Oh, they are a regular
barrel of... Tish!

456
00:26:32,106 --> 00:26:33,470
Why, hello, Bree.

457
00:26:33,657 --> 00:26:34,600
Carolyn.

458
00:26:35,576 --> 00:26:37,003
Do you two know each other?

459
00:26:37,545 --> 00:26:39,400
Well, that saves me an introduction.

460
00:26:39,937 --> 00:26:43,623
Uh, Tish, you know, I was wondering if
you need any help with the Christmas gala.

461
00:26:43,675 --> 00:26:45,443
Last year, I was on the
decorations committee...

462
00:26:45,456 --> 00:26:49,200
Oh, my God, I forgot to
call you. What an idiot!

463
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:50,733
We'll talk first thing tomorrow.

464
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:52,360
That would be lovely. Thanks.

465
00:26:52,607 --> 00:26:53,433
Nice to see you.

466
00:26:53,698 --> 00:26:54,801
Nice to be seen.

467
00:26:58,018 --> 00:27:00,100
Well, I need to powder
my nose. Care to join me?

468
00:27:00,146 --> 00:27:01,041
Oh, I'd love to.

469
00:27:04,345 --> 00:27:05,721
I'm so happy we did this.

470
00:27:05,848 --> 00:27:08,070
Yes, me, too. It's been
a delightful evening.

471
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:09,352
So, so fun.

472
00:27:10,498 --> 00:27:13,380
Could you get us some
extra tissues? Thank you.

473
00:27:15,737 --> 00:27:18,332
You know, I realized
something just the other day.

474
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:20,880
You've never seen a picture
of Alma, have you?

475
00:27:21,815 --> 00:27:23,382
No. Why?

476
00:27:34,605 --> 00:27:36,373
Granted, it's not her best look.

477
00:27:40,368 --> 00:27:41,502
What is all this?

478
00:27:41,525 --> 00:27:45,070
That's the police report that
Alma filed after Orson hit her.

479
00:27:46,276 --> 00:27:50,560
It's all in there. The bruises,
contusions, broken wrist.

480
00:27:50,685 --> 00:27:52,530
This is not possible.

481
00:27:54,296 --> 00:27:56,013
Photos don't lie, Bree.

482
00:27:56,777 --> 00:27:58,541
Is this why you apologized?

483
00:27:58,557 --> 00:27:59,382
Yes.

484
00:28:00,546 --> 00:28:03,132
I wanted you to spend time with
me so you can see I'm not some

485
00:28:03,426 --> 00:28:05,383
crazy nut out to get you.

486
00:28:06,378 --> 00:28:09,851
I'm sorry, but if something like that happened
again,  I could never forgive myself.

487
00:28:11,958 --> 00:28:12,710
Thank you.

488
00:28:15,605 --> 00:28:17,421
I had a feeling you might need these.

489
00:28:21,997 --> 00:28:22,862
Bring me another one.

490
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:25,600
Hey, buddy...

491
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:28,351
You wanna slow down
a little bit, huh?

492
00:28:30,456 --> 00:28:31,241
Harvey?

493
00:28:31,928 --> 00:28:33,450
Look, I'm going through something,

494
00:28:33,947 --> 00:28:36,280
And I don't have anyone
else to talk to about it.

495
00:28:38,647 --> 00:28:39,941
I had an affair.

496
00:28:42,247 --> 00:28:43,583
Uh, does Carolyn know?

497
00:28:43,598 --> 00:28:44,952
No, she has no idea.

498
00:28:45,247 --> 00:28:50,420
I met this girl on a flight from
Paris, and we just... connected.

499
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,812
No, I know it sounds
crazy, but it was...

500
00:28:53,625 --> 00:28:55,112
love at first sight.

501
00:28:56,015 --> 00:28:57,341
Well, are you still seeing her?

502
00:28:57,385 --> 00:28:58,781
No, that's the thing.

503
00:28:58,838 --> 00:29:02,351
A few months ago, she stopped
returning my calls, and,

504
00:29:02,457 --> 00:29:05,692
then I went by her place and I've looked
for her everywhere, and she's just...

505
00:29:06,475 --> 00:29:07,602
disappeared.

506
00:29:08,428 --> 00:29:12,462
No, I'll tell ya, now I know what you
went, through with Alma. It's brutal.

507
00:29:13,367 --> 00:29:15,272
It gets better. Trust me.

508
00:29:15,815 --> 00:29:17,912
I just can't get past it. I'm...

509
00:29:18,355 --> 00:29:20,072
I can't get Monique
out of my mind.

510
00:29:20,518 --> 00:29:21,181
Monique?

511
00:29:21,567 --> 00:29:22,460
That's her name.

512
00:29:24,047 --> 00:29:25,163
Monique...

513
00:29:26,767 --> 00:29:27,790
Polier.

514
00:29:29,637 --> 00:29:30,871
Isn't she beautiful?

515
00:29:35,866 --> 00:29:37,800
She's... very pretty.

516
00:29:42,435 --> 00:29:43,303
They're back.

517
00:29:45,718 --> 00:29:48,463
You two girls were gone a long
time, everything okay?

518
00:29:48,487 --> 00:29:49,710
Mm-hmm, absolutely.

519
00:29:51,528 --> 00:29:54,513
So... who wants dessert?

520
00:30:11,365 --> 00:30:12,573
What have you been up to?

521
00:30:15,276 --> 00:30:17,210
Just a quiet night with the girls.

522
00:30:20,526 --> 00:30:23,430
Listen, something happened tonight,
and it got me thinking, and...

523
00:30:26,847 --> 00:30:29,312
You mean more to me than
any restaurant ever could.

524
00:30:29,398 --> 00:30:35,523
Oh, stop right there.I am the one who
should apologize. I have been a bad wife.

525
00:30:35,566 --> 00:30:36,562
No, no, no, no, no!

526
00:30:36,578 --> 00:30:38,861
You were just trying to keep me
from doing something reckless.

527
00:30:38,865 --> 00:30:41,841
Yeah, well, any wife can support
a husband who never takes risks,

528
00:30:41,847 --> 00:30:45,830
and I don't want that kind of husband, and
I'll be damned if I'm gonna be that kind of wife.

529
00:30:45,838 --> 00:30:52,223
So you open your pizza place, and
we will find a way to make it work.

530
00:30:53,436 --> 00:30:55,403
You don't know how much
it means to me to hear that.

531
00:30:57,888 --> 00:30:58,882
God, I love you.

532
00:31:03,745 --> 00:31:05,823
So what happened tonight?

533
00:31:06,595 --> 00:31:09,770
Okay, but don't react until
I've told you the whole story.

534
00:31:09,776 --> 00:31:13,193
And remember, it's actually a good thing,
because it brought us back together.

535
00:31:20,547 --> 00:31:21,341
Ding-dong.

536
00:31:22,348 --> 00:31:25,543
I don't know what Tom told
you, but he came on to me.

537
00:31:25,888 --> 00:31:29,003
I'm sorry. I didn't quite catch that.

538
00:31:29,196 --> 00:31:32,610
Why don't you just come on over
here and say that to me again?

539
00:31:32,828 --> 00:31:33,850
Stay away from me.

540
00:31:33,855 --> 00:31:35,532
I have been trying to
stay away from you...

541
00:31:35,538 --> 00:31:36,332
Mom?

542
00:31:43,426 --> 00:31:48,000
Everything's all right, so you can
just go back into your room and play.

543
00:31:48,225 --> 00:31:51,542
Kayla! Don't move.

544
00:32:00,056 --> 00:32:02,591
Okay. Never mind.

545
00:32:03,895 --> 00:32:04,940
I'm leaving.

546
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,853
First, I'm just gonna
give your Mom a hug.

547
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:14,893
Your association
with my family is over.

548
00:32:14,976 --> 00:32:17,732
When Kayla comes to visit, you will
drop her at the end of the block.

549
00:32:17,755 --> 00:32:20,911
You will never again see
my husband, and if you try to,

550
00:32:20,925 --> 00:32:26,741
I will do to your spine what
I just did to your front door.

551
00:32:27,065 --> 00:32:29,353
Nod if you understand.

552
00:32:38,328 --> 00:32:40,901
And you, I'm gonna see
you on Saturday, right?

553
00:32:41,736 --> 00:32:42,962
Don't forget your swimsuit.

554
00:32:52,616 --> 00:32:55,582
Good morning! You're
looking bright-eyed and...

555
00:32:56,675 --> 00:32:57,542
bushy.

556
00:32:59,848 --> 00:33:01,722
Did you stay here all night?

557
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:03,161
Well, I slept on the sofa.

558
00:33:03,207 --> 00:33:06,310
When I brought you home, you
were still, as you americans say...

559
00:33:06,608 --> 00:33:08,510
tossing your tacos.

560
00:33:09,058 --> 00:33:12,283
Please, keep the food
references to a minimum.

561
00:33:13,798 --> 00:33:15,083
Bless you.

562
00:33:21,487 --> 00:33:23,051
So what else happened?

563
00:33:23,676 --> 00:33:24,842
You don't remember?

564
00:33:25,656 --> 00:33:28,393
Well, I'll tell you what...
I'll repeat what you said last night,

565
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:31,901
and you say whether it was you or
the booze talking. Are you ready?

566
00:33:33,056 --> 00:33:35,893
You said you missed me.
Susan or booze?

567
00:33:36,777 --> 00:33:37,573
Susan.

568
00:33:37,926 --> 00:33:42,230
You said it was a mistake breaking up
with me and that you wanted to start again.

569
00:33:42,345 --> 00:33:44,423
Susan or booze?

570
00:33:45,408 --> 00:33:46,242
Susan.

571
00:33:46,755 --> 00:33:53,531
Then you said that you wanted
to dress me up like a schoolboy
and spank my naughty bottom.

572
00:33:54,017 --> 00:33:55,822
Susan or booze?

573
00:33:59,535 --> 00:34:01,530
Oh, I didn't say that.

574
00:34:02,448 --> 00:34:05,411
Yeah, all right then,
but if you had, um...

575
00:34:05,728 --> 00:34:07,610
Susan or booze?

576
00:34:10,767 --> 00:34:13,872
A little of both, so... boozan.

577
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:37,501
Detective Ridley.

578
00:34:38,347 --> 00:34:41,972
Your Jane Doe in the morgue
is named Monique Polier.

579
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:43,542
Who's this?

580
00:34:43,795 --> 00:34:48,441
Just before she died, she was having an
affair with a man named Harvey Bigsby.

581
00:34:48,777 --> 00:34:49,352
You got that?

582
00:34:49,406 --> 00:34:51,182
Yeah. Uh, can I get your name?

583
00:34:51,217 --> 00:34:53,061
I'll need to bring you
in for a statement.

584
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:09,052
Carlos, could you come help me?

585
00:35:09,517 --> 00:35:10,582
I'm watching the game.

586
00:35:11,288 --> 00:35:13,661
It'll just take a second. Please?

587
00:35:19,907 --> 00:35:21,011
What, Gaby?

588
00:35:24,636 --> 00:35:26,672
You look... nice.

589
00:35:27,147 --> 00:35:28,411
Oh, thanks.

590
00:35:28,555 --> 00:35:30,171
I'm gonna go meet some
new friends for dinner.

591
00:35:30,187 --> 00:35:31,990
But my zipper's stuck.
Can you help me?

592
00:35:39,486 --> 00:35:41,340
Man, this is really stuck.

593
00:35:41,776 --> 00:35:43,882
It's like somebody put superglue
on it or something.

594
00:35:45,907 --> 00:35:46,903
Weird.

595
00:35:47,618 --> 00:35:51,931
Well, you know what? I don't wanna
be late, so I should probably change.

596
00:35:54,397 --> 00:35:56,930
Oh, Carlos, this old thing?

597
00:35:57,487 --> 00:35:59,391
You've seen it all before.

598
00:35:59,938 --> 00:36:01,851
I'm just gonna wear
the little blue number.

599
00:36:02,308 --> 00:36:03,851
Will you hand me those stockings?

600
00:36:07,346 --> 00:36:08,911
I've got a raggedy nail.

601
00:36:11,316 --> 00:36:13,503
You're gonna have to
help me put those on.

602
00:36:16,515 --> 00:36:18,192
Are you sure about that?

603
00:36:18,778 --> 00:36:21,243
Well, I'd do it myself, but
I don't wanna get a snag.

604
00:36:31,166 --> 00:36:32,772
It's been a long time.

605
00:36:33,505 --> 00:36:36,262
Really? It seems like
yesterday to me.

606
00:36:42,837 --> 00:36:44,412
You want me to help
you hook that?

607
00:36:45,487 --> 00:36:46,203
Sure.

608
00:36:46,926 --> 00:36:47,780
Why not?

609
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:49,842
For old time's sake.

610
00:37:03,858 --> 00:37:05,380
What about your new friends?

611
00:37:06,848 --> 00:37:09,620
I've decided I'd rather
catch up with an old one.

612
00:37:34,447 --> 00:37:37,472
Mr. Bigsby, Detective Ridley, homicide.

613
00:37:37,837 --> 00:37:39,160
I understand you know her.

614
00:37:51,195 --> 00:37:54,011
Uh, all right, yes, we
were sleeping together.

615
00:37:57,338 --> 00:37:59,013
Can we do this somewhere else?

616
00:37:59,466 --> 00:38:00,090
Sure.

617
00:38:08,498 --> 00:38:10,493
Carlos, do you think
we're making a mistake?

618
00:38:11,866 --> 00:38:12,621
What do you mean?

619
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:14,510
The whole divorce thing.

620
00:38:15,188 --> 00:38:17,072
Maybe we shouldn't
go through with it.

621
00:38:17,637 --> 00:38:21,090
It's not like we're gonna find this
kind of passion with anyone else.

622
00:38:24,136 --> 00:38:25,613
Are you saying you wanna stay together?

623
00:38:26,457 --> 00:38:27,273
Yeah,

624
00:38:28,237 --> 00:38:29,760
I guess I am.

625
00:38:30,205 --> 00:38:34,151
Why don't we just put all of this behind
us and stay together? What do you say?

626
00:38:34,375 --> 00:38:35,340
Oh, baby...

627
00:38:36,197 --> 00:38:38,900
If you knew how long I waited
to hear you say that...

628
00:38:45,287 --> 00:38:47,142
Well, what? What's so funny?

629
00:38:47,227 --> 00:38:48,623
Oh, man.

630
00:38:49,386 --> 00:38:52,772
I thought I'd be able to get through this
without cracking up, but you are just too funny.

631
00:38:57,767 --> 00:38:59,710
There's a little something
that I need to own up to.

632
00:39:01,587 --> 00:39:05,692
I know that the only reason you slept
with me was because I got a new job.

633
00:39:06,627 --> 00:39:10,031
You got a new job?
Honey, that's wonderful!

634
00:39:10,246 --> 00:39:11,433
Gaby, please.

635
00:39:11,736 --> 00:39:14,430
You were a model,
not a model actress.

636
00:39:15,658 --> 00:39:16,730
There is no job.

637
00:39:17,258 --> 00:39:19,871
The contracts in my desk were
fake. I mailed them to myself.

638
00:39:21,316 --> 00:39:22,132
What?

639
00:39:23,318 --> 00:39:24,920
Why would you do that?

640
00:39:25,586 --> 00:39:27,771
Well, let's see...

641
00:39:30,746 --> 00:39:34,130
You did this just
to get me in bed?

642
00:39:34,597 --> 00:39:38,652
No, I did it because I knew you'd smell
money and come crawling back.

643
00:39:39,487 --> 00:39:42,111
Then I could turn you down
and walk out on my own terms.

644
00:39:42,327 --> 00:39:43,180
Your terms?

645
00:39:43,566 --> 00:39:48,603
You don't get to screw around
on me, take my money and then
walk away without a scratch.

646
00:39:48,957 --> 00:39:50,581
I want you hurting, baby,

647
00:39:50,587 --> 00:39:52,363
and judging by the
look on your face,

648
00:39:52,528 --> 00:39:55,050
when you saw 2 million
imaginary dollars disappear,

649
00:39:56,077 --> 00:39:57,090
I succeeded.

650
00:39:58,695 --> 00:39:59,620
You are a bastard!

651
00:40:00,736 --> 00:40:02,240
Better a bastard
than a whore.

652
00:40:07,016 --> 00:40:08,021
Oh, God!

653
00:40:14,436 --> 00:40:17,753
Hello? Uh, there's been an
accident. My husband, he...

654
00:40:23,238 --> 00:40:24,630
I'm gonna have to call you back.

655
00:40:29,118 --> 00:40:30,221
Carlos?

656
00:40:32,217 --> 00:40:33,002
Honey?

657
00:40:35,758 --> 00:40:36,761
Carlos?

658
00:40:42,146 --> 00:40:43,360
Oh, yeah.

659
00:40:45,325 --> 00:40:46,642
It's on.

660
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:59,552
There is a place in St. Timothy's church
where sinners go to confess their sins.

661
00:40:59,838 --> 00:41:03,330
And once they're done,
they expect absolution.

662
00:41:03,937 --> 00:41:09,191
But the truth is, not all confessions
are worthy of such forgiveness.

663
00:41:09,896 --> 00:41:15,402
Most who unveil hidden agendas
deserve the condemnation they receive.

664
00:41:16,505 --> 00:41:22,402
Most who disclose vengeful motives
merit the punishment that follows.

665
00:41:22,916 --> 00:41:29,280
Only the truly repentant have any right
at all to expect a second chance...

666
00:41:31,207 --> 00:41:33,080
Come on. What's my surprise?

667
00:41:46,996 --> 00:41:49,061
I thought you'd never get here.

668
00:41:51,317 --> 00:41:55,773
Which is why it's best to think
twice before you confess...

669
00:41:56,048 --> 00:41:56,742
Mike?

670
00:41:58,418 --> 00:41:59,252
What's wrong?

671
00:42:01,885 --> 00:42:02,550
That...

672
00:42:03,317 --> 00:42:05,030
That girl who died...

673
00:42:05,268 --> 00:42:10,361
Especially if you don't know
what it is you're confessing to.

674
00:42:10,857 --> 00:42:12,630
I think I knew her.
