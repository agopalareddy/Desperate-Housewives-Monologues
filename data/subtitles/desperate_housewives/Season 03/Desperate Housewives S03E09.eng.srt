00:00:00,047 --> 00:00:01,961
Previously on Desperate Housewives...

2
00:00:02,301 --> 00:00:04,027
Wisteria Lane's new hero...

3
00:00:04,368 --> 00:00:04,896
Hello?

4
00:00:05,037 --> 00:00:06,552
Superhero houses are great!

5
00:00:06,883 --> 00:00:08,997
Turned out to be anything but.

6
00:00:10,654 --> 00:00:12,294
Orson's mother took
up residence...

7
00:00:12,285 --> 00:00:15,172
I've decided to accept
your wife's kind invitation.

8
00:00:15,236 --> 00:00:15,896
You wouldn't.

9
00:00:16,037 --> 00:00:17,490
And Mike couldn't remember...

10
00:00:17,547 --> 00:00:19,080
No memory, huh?
That'sconvenient.

11
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,226
Anything at all.

12
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:21,323
Here's our search warrant.

13
00:00:21,622 --> 00:00:22,898
We couldn't
find a toolbox.

14
00:00:23,929 --> 00:00:25,991
You might want to
wash that wrench off.

15
00:00:26,016 --> 00:00:27,462
It's got something on it.

16
00:00:30,358 --> 00:00:33,782
I'm just saying that we never
spend the night at your house.

17
00:00:33,805 --> 00:00:35,891
But your place is
so warm and cozy.

18
00:00:36,098 --> 00:00:37,543
Oh, it's also
a disaster area.

19
00:00:37,547 --> 00:00:39,313
I didn't get a chance
to clean it today.

20
00:00:39,386 --> 00:00:39,741
Oops!

21
00:00:40,337 --> 00:00:41,770
Oh, here, let me.

22
00:00:43,046 --> 00:00:46,932
Susan Mayer had never
thought of herself as Cinderella,

23
00:00:47,595 --> 00:00:49,331
but then one day...

24
00:00:50,347 --> 00:00:51,803
a prince showed up.

25
00:00:53,936 --> 00:00:57,201
Well, we can't have you
sleeping in squalor, can we?

26
00:00:57,797 --> 00:00:59,041
My place it is.

27
00:01:02,008 --> 00:01:05,222
And Susan realized
her life had become...

28
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:06,840
a fairy tale.

29
00:01:08,376 --> 00:01:11,882
And since her prince had
welcomed her into his castle,

30
00:01:13,528 --> 00:01:16,721
She felt the least she
could do was thank him...

31
00:01:17,326 --> 00:01:18,231
Again...

32
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:19,922
And again...

33
00:01:20,868 --> 00:01:22,053
And again.

34
00:01:23,466 --> 00:01:27,410
The next morning, however,
Susan discovered castles...

35
00:01:28,897 --> 00:01:30,742
Don't run themselves.

36
00:01:36,318 --> 00:01:38,133
All right, oh...

37
00:01:38,217 --> 00:01:41,780
But let's make it a quickie
'cause you are wasting water.

38
00:01:44,455 --> 00:01:45,360
Sorry.

39
00:01:45,725 --> 00:01:47,231
I didn't mean
to startle you.

40
00:01:48,406 --> 00:01:49,543
Who are you?

41
00:01:49,927 --> 00:01:50,981
I am Rupert.

44
00:01:55,097 --> 00:01:57,021
in case names
weren't exchanged.

45
00:01:57,688 --> 00:01:58,701
Oh, no,

46
00:01:58,956 --> 00:02:00,422
I'm your boss' girlfriend.

47
00:02:00,428 --> 00:02:01,893
Surely he mentioned me.

48
00:02:02,387 --> 00:02:04,032
Mm, not that I recollect.

49
00:02:05,466 --> 00:02:06,162
Rupert.

50
00:02:07,147 --> 00:02:07,963
Good morning...

51
00:02:08,307 --> 00:02:08,913
boss.

52
00:02:09,257 --> 00:02:10,522
I thought you
were off today.

53
00:02:10,646 --> 00:02:12,133
Isn't... Isn't your
sister in town?

54
00:02:12,377 --> 00:02:13,992
Uh, that's next
weekend, sir.

55
00:02:15,595 --> 00:02:16,713
It's a good thing, too.

56
00:02:17,155 --> 00:02:19,593
Otherwise, I might not have had
the pleasure of meeting your...

57
00:02:20,327 --> 00:02:21,242
girlfriend.

58
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:23,383
Susan?

59
00:02:24,626 --> 00:02:27,631
Yes, we met at the,
um, at the hospital.

60
00:02:28,765 --> 00:02:29,971
Why don't I fetch
you a robe?

61
00:02:30,585 --> 00:02:31,730
Loving that idea.

62
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,890
Would you care
for some breakfast?

63
00:02:41,016 --> 00:02:43,881
Omelette?
Strawberry tart? Brioche?

64
00:02:45,268 --> 00:02:47,260
Um, yeah,
that sounds great.

65
00:02:48,008 --> 00:02:48,883
You pick.

66
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:53,671
Yes, Susan's life had indeed
become a fairy tale.

67
00:02:53,705 --> 00:02:56,393
You are aware there
is a Mrs. Hainsworth?

68
00:02:57,607 --> 00:02:58,583
Well, of course.

69
00:02:59,238 --> 00:03:01,092
And what's a fairy tale...

70
00:03:01,977 --> 00:03:03,012
Tart it is.

71
00:03:05,297 --> 00:03:07,261
Without a dragon to slay?

74
00:03:50,718 --> 00:03:53,681
We know dangerous men
walk among us.

75
00:03:54,205 --> 00:03:55,912
What we can't be sure of

76
00:03:55,977 --> 00:03:58,531
is who they are
or where they hide.

77
00:03:59,017 --> 00:04:01,590
So the most we can
offer any stranger

78
00:04:01,756 --> 00:04:03,140
is reasonable doubt.

79
00:04:03,526 --> 00:04:05,421
But once the doubt is gone,

80
00:04:05,605 --> 00:04:08,282
people are anything
but reasonable.

81
00:04:08,598 --> 00:04:11,952
I am telling you, our
neighbor is a pedophile,

82
00:04:11,957 --> 00:04:14,141
and I expect you
to do something about it.

83
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:16,580
Mrs. Scavo, he's not listed
on any sex offender registry.

84
00:04:17,165 --> 00:04:18,941
He's never had so much
as a traffic ticket.

85
00:04:18,956 --> 00:04:21,711
He's a single man with
a basement full of toys!

86
00:04:21,746 --> 00:04:25,880
I understand your concern, but we
can't book a guy on possession of toys.

87
00:04:25,906 --> 00:04:26,662
You don't get it.

88
00:04:26,777 --> 00:04:29,760
His house had
this creepy vibe.

89
00:04:30,075 --> 00:04:30,840
Tell him, Tom.

90
00:04:30,846 --> 00:04:32,520
I never went down
to the actual room...

91
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:33,683
Okay, he wasn't there.
He doesn't know.

92
00:04:33,788 --> 00:04:39,000
Look, he had a wall full of pictures
of half-naked boys in swimsuits.

93
00:04:39,485 --> 00:04:41,393
Didn't you say
he was a swim coach?

94
00:04:42,045 --> 00:04:43,040
What are you, his lawyer?

95
00:04:43,066 --> 00:04:44,852
You have to admit, it's odd.

96
00:04:44,938 --> 00:04:45,722
Here's what's odd...

97
00:04:46,136 --> 00:04:47,893
If your neighbor
had something to hide,

98
00:04:48,308 --> 00:04:50,133
why'd he invite you in
to see all of his stuff?

99
00:04:57,407 --> 00:05:00,703
He wasn't technically home
when I went inside.

100
00:05:02,158 --> 00:05:03,183
So you broke in?

101
00:05:03,677 --> 00:05:05,170
The door was open...

102
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:07,401
I was bringing
him a cake.

103
00:05:09,265 --> 00:05:10,143
A cake?

104
00:05:10,295 --> 00:05:11,862
It  was a "thank you" cake.

105
00:05:12,767 --> 00:05:14,413
He sort of saved my life.

106
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:19,232
She  didn't know thate was a pedophile
when she baked the actual cake.

107
00:05:19,237 --> 00:05:20,742
He doesn't care
about the cake, Tom.

108
00:05:20,748 --> 00:05:22,153
-Why are you snapping at me?
-I'm not snapping at you.

109
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:23,840
-You're totally snapping.
-I am snapping

110
00:05:23,845 --> 00:05:26,553
because there is
a monster across the street,

111
00:05:26,605 --> 00:05:30,071
and Barney Fife here is making
me sound like the bad guy!

112
00:05:33,436 --> 00:05:34,190
Look, I'm sorry.

113
00:05:34,448 --> 00:05:36,692
She's been under a lot
of stress, hasn't slept well.

114
00:05:36,885 --> 00:05:38,953
You better not be
apologizing for me!

115
00:05:39,915 --> 00:05:40,952
Gotta go.

116
00:05:46,848 --> 00:05:49,102
So, I've got some
fabulous news.

117
00:05:49,546 --> 00:05:51,751
Well, I hope it's more
fabulous than this dress.

118
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,120
I look something
Ike Turner would hit.

119
00:05:55,048 --> 00:05:57,252
You're gonna have to find yourself
another personal shopper.

120
00:05:58,926 --> 00:06:00,620
What, I slam one dress,
and you quit on me?

121
00:06:00,696 --> 00:06:01,943
No, that's my news.

122
00:06:02,078 --> 00:06:05,052
I'm leaving the store and
starting my own business.

123
00:06:06,258 --> 00:06:07,750
"Beauty by Vern"?

124
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:11,223
You're opening up a salon?
God, could you get any gayer?

125
00:06:11,476 --> 00:06:13,951
It's a consulting firm for
beauty pageant contestants.

126
00:06:14,538 --> 00:06:16,432
And the answer's "yes."

127
00:06:17,086 --> 00:06:19,810
This week, I'm coaching little girls
for the Miss Snowflake pageant.

128
00:06:20,106 --> 00:06:23,133
It's very rewarding.
Hey, you know what might be fun?

129
00:06:23,548 --> 00:06:24,911
If you come down
and give a talk.

130
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:26,320
You know, give the
kids some pointers.

131
00:06:26,568 --> 00:06:29,050
Vern, I worked the catwalks
in Milan and Paris.

132
00:06:29,066 --> 00:06:32,040
I'm not gonna give makeup tips
to little miss training bra.

133
00:06:32,117 --> 00:06:34,141
You have been
in rare bitch form.

134
00:06:34,347 --> 00:06:36,593
It's been months now,
so don't blame it on your cycle.

135
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:39,861
Don't call me a bitch,
and stop tracking my cycle.

136
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:41,341
I told you that freaks me out.

137
00:06:41,488 --> 00:06:44,102
I'm just saying you've
been very cranky today.

138
00:06:44,898 --> 00:06:46,012
What's going on?

139
00:06:49,058 --> 00:06:51,043
The divorce decree
came through today.

140
00:06:51,418 --> 00:06:53,603
Carlos is officially
out of my life.

141
00:06:54,157 --> 00:06:55,241
Oh, honey.

142
00:06:57,507 --> 00:06:58,960
The girls' ages
range 8 to 12.

143
00:06:58,965 --> 00:07:01,080
We meet every Thursday in
the rec room of the elks lodge.

144
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:03,336
I'm not doing it.

145
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,253
You need a project.

146
00:07:05,252 --> 00:07:06,628
That's your problem,
you're bored.

147
00:07:06,989 --> 00:07:08,472
And you know what
the cure for that is...

148
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,410
Helping others.

149
00:07:11,737 --> 00:07:13,732
Fine. I'll do it,

150
00:07:14,597 --> 00:07:15,940
But I want
this dress for free.

151
00:07:15,985 --> 00:07:17,560
Evil! You said
you hated it.

152
00:07:17,925 --> 00:07:19,273
And I hate helping
others, too,

153
00:07:19,275 --> 00:07:20,523
but I'm doing that,
aren't I?

154
00:07:27,108 --> 00:07:28,172
Is the coast clear?

155
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:30,011
I don't wanna
flash the help again.

156
00:07:30,105 --> 00:07:31,783
Relax.
He's making breakfast,

157
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:33,983
But you're more than
welcome to flash me.

158
00:07:37,408 --> 00:07:38,913
How long has Rupert
worked for you?

159
00:07:39,597 --> 00:07:41,780
Oh, for years.
He's practically family.

160
00:07:42,885 --> 00:07:45,363
So you're that close, and
you never told him about me?

161
00:07:45,928 --> 00:07:47,472
Yes, about that...

162
00:07:48,028 --> 00:07:50,802
Rupert was incredibly
devoted to Jane.

163
00:07:51,355 --> 00:07:53,342
He's, uh, never seen me
with another woman,

164
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,053
Let alone a frisky,
naked one.

165
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:59,070
Well, that explains why he was
a little cold to me this morning.

166
00:07:59,628 --> 00:08:01,623
Was he?
I'll have a talk with him.

167
00:08:01,755 --> 00:08:03,902
Oh, no, don't do that.
That'll just make it wor.

168
00:08:04,038 --> 00:08:04,701
I get it.

169
00:08:05,177 --> 00:08:07,253
He loved Jane.
He doesn't know me.

170
00:08:07,698 --> 00:08:09,460
You know, I'll just
have to charm him,

171
00:08:09,835 --> 00:08:11,142
warm him up a little.

172
00:08:15,948 --> 00:08:18,803
Well, I'm, uh,
I'm sure you'll find a way.

173
00:08:19,936 --> 00:08:21,493
Great.
9:00 in the morning,

174
00:08:21,505 --> 00:08:23,773
and I have to put on
a slinky, black cocktail dress.

175
00:08:26,568 --> 00:08:27,841
Hey, here's an idea.

176
00:08:28,128 --> 00:08:30,580
You keep some things
in a drawer at my house.

177
00:08:30,785 --> 00:08:32,600
Would it be okay
if I had one here?

178
00:08:33,316 --> 00:08:33,971
A drawer?

179
00:08:34,607 --> 00:08:36,053
Do you think we'll
be here that often?

180
00:08:37,198 --> 00:08:39,070
Your shower
s six power nozzles.

181
00:08:39,427 --> 00:08:41,062
With or without you,
I'll be back.

182
00:08:41,615 --> 00:08:43,932
Well, then by all means,
let's get you a drawer.

183
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,291
I don't need much.
One of those will do.

184
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:49,823
Actually,
that's not a good idea.

185
00:08:49,866 --> 00:08:51,893
Rupert arranges
things meticulously.

186
00:08:51,897 --> 00:08:54,042
You'll never win him over
if you mess with his system.

187
00:08:54,056 --> 00:08:54,800
Rupert?

188
00:08:56,635 --> 00:08:58,570
Wow! Your timing's perfect.

189
00:08:59,938 --> 00:09:01,010
Not always.

190
00:09:01,478 --> 00:09:03,292
Susan will be
needing a drawer.

191
00:09:04,158 --> 00:09:05,131
A drawer, sir?

192
00:09:05,556 --> 00:09:07,040
Yes, for her things.

193
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,951
She's gonna be spending
more time here.

194
00:09:09,175 --> 00:09:11,603
Yeah, Rupe, I hope
we can be good friends,

195
00:09:11,628 --> 00:09:13,693
'cause you're gonna be
seeing lots more of me.

196
00:09:14,028 --> 00:09:16,781
Oh, madam, that
hardly seems possible.

197
00:09:19,457 --> 00:09:22,480
Mother  Hodge,
your food will get cold!

198
00:09:25,695 --> 00:09:28,663
Why, please, is there a lock
on the liquor cabinet?

199
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:32,142
Because your doctor says people taking
your medication shouldn't drink.

200
00:09:32,365 --> 00:09:34,343
A warning you've chosen
to ignore if the...

201
00:09:34,617 --> 00:09:37,223
lipstick on the vodka
bottle is any indication.

202
00:09:38,937 --> 00:09:41,123
Poached fish again?

203
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:42,641
I  don't want this.

204
00:09:43,168 --> 00:09:45,012
I want what
you're all having.

205
00:09:45,108 --> 00:09:47,703
Well, your doctor has you
on a low fat, low sodium diet.

206
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,012
Eight meals this week,

207
00:09:49,076 --> 00:09:51,071
Eight times I've told
you the same thing.

208
00:09:52,148 --> 00:09:54,450
So, who would
like to say grace?

209
00:09:54,548 --> 00:09:55,443
Allow me.

210
00:09:58,537 --> 00:09:59,330
Dear Lord,

211
00:09:59,405 --> 00:10:02,043
I thank you for this bland,
indifferently prepared meal,

212
00:10:02,047 --> 00:10:04,462
and beseech you to ignite
some spark of compassion

213
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:06,352
in my coldhearted
daughter-in-law.

214
00:10:06,358 --> 00:10:08,900
That she might show
some shred of mercy to me,

215
00:10:09,158 --> 00:10:10,892
her wretched captive.

216
00:10:11,205 --> 00:10:12,402
Amen.

217
00:10:17,605 --> 00:10:20,950
Mother, may I remind you,
you asked to come here?

218
00:10:21,275 --> 00:10:23,632
I didn't know I'd be trading
one jail for another.

219
00:10:24,278 --> 00:10:25,410
At least at the home

220
00:10:25,415 --> 00:10:28,372
you could bribe the orderlies
to smuggle things in,

221
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:31,180
But here, nothing gets
past the commandant.

222
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:34,441
I have done
everything I can

223
00:10:34,446 --> 00:10:36,572
to make you happy
and comfortable.

224
00:10:37,188 --> 00:10:38,411
What do you want from us?

225
00:10:38,655 --> 00:10:39,810
I want my freedom.

226
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:43,363
I want out of this
perky little gulag

227
00:10:43,365 --> 00:10:45,803
and into a house
I can call my own.

228
00:10:46,388 --> 00:10:49,052
And you're going
to buy it for me.

229
00:10:49,188 --> 00:10:50,953
I can't afford
to buy you a house.

230
00:10:52,075 --> 00:10:53,663
You can't afford not to.

231
00:10:58,206 --> 00:11:00,492
I know a house won't
be easy to swing,

232
00:11:00,515 --> 00:11:03,590
but how many more of these Edward
Albee dinners do you want to sit through?

233
00:11:03,946 --> 00:11:06,373
What did she mean by,
"you can't afford not to"?

234
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,930
Was she threatening
you with something?

235
00:11:07,935 --> 00:11:11,060
Yes, she's threatening to
make us miserable till we cave.

236
00:11:11,836 --> 00:11:14,372
Look, at least see if Edie
has any cheap listings.

237
00:11:14,558 --> 00:11:16,362
We'll be happier,
my mother will be happier...

238
00:11:16,368 --> 00:11:17,961
Yeah, and she'll take
terrible care of herself

239
00:11:17,966 --> 00:11:19,201
and be dead in a year.

240
00:11:19,905 --> 00:11:21,772
You just stole my
next argument.

241
00:11:26,376 --> 00:11:29,001
Okay, you've got enough
money to pay either

242
00:11:29,008 --> 00:11:31,550
the phone or the cable
bill, but not both.

243
00:11:34,138 --> 00:11:36,130
Hello? Mike.

244
00:11:37,646 --> 00:11:38,911
I'm trying to
help you here.

245
00:11:40,016 --> 00:11:43,402
Oh, I'm sorry.
Just do whatever you want.

246
00:11:45,186 --> 00:11:47,312
Fine. Cable it is.

247
00:11:48,057 --> 00:11:49,420
Nobody calls you anyway.

248
00:12:00,027 --> 00:12:01,092
What do you want?

249
00:12:01,498 --> 00:12:02,681
My toilet's clogged.

250
00:12:02,918 --> 00:12:04,252
I thought maybe
you could fix it.

251
00:12:04,686 --> 00:12:06,710
Oh, wait, you can't,
can you?

252
00:12:06,815 --> 00:12:08,431
'Cause you don't
have any tools.

253
00:12:08,827 --> 00:12:10,881
Must be tough being
a plumber without tools.

254
00:12:12,086 --> 00:12:13,840
Why don't you people
leave me the hell alone?

255
00:12:14,386 --> 00:12:15,122
Jeez,

256
00:12:15,358 --> 00:12:18,813
you sure are hostile for a guy who
makes his living in the service industry.

257
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:37,270
You know, it just occurred to me,
there's no point in paying the cable bill

258
00:12:37,275 --> 00:12:38,963
If you're not gonna
have electricity,

259
00:12:39,898 --> 00:12:44,140
So I'm thinking pay the
electricity upfront and...

260
00:12:59,355 --> 00:13:01,363
Where have you been?
They're all waiting for you.

261
00:13:01,426 --> 00:13:03,693
I'm here to teach fashion,
so I'm fashionably late.

262
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:04,032
Cute.

263
00:13:04,048 --> 00:13:07,222
Now remember, these mothers have refinanced
their trailers In order to pay for this,

264
00:13:07,228 --> 00:13:09,550
so when you make your entrance,
for God sakes, sparkle.

265
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:15,431
Now in addition to her
three Vogue covers,

266
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:18,302
you may remember her as
the face of La Roque cosmetics.

267
00:13:18,387 --> 00:13:20,811
Please welcome miss
Gabrielle Marquez!

268
00:13:33,655 --> 00:13:34,471
Vern?

269
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:35,661
A moment.

270
00:13:40,997 --> 00:13:41,812
Is there a problem?

271
00:13:41,935 --> 00:13:42,603
Yes!

272
00:13:42,718 --> 00:13:44,653
What  am I supposed to do with
that petting zoo out there?

273
00:13:44,667 --> 00:13:47,231
Not everyone wins the
genetic lottery like you did.

274
00:13:47,646 --> 00:13:48,832
These girls need help

275
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:51,100
finding the promised land
of beauty and style.

276
00:13:51,598 --> 00:13:53,753
Please, Gabrielle,
be their moses.

277
00:13:56,256 --> 00:13:57,243
Good comparison,

278
00:13:57,297 --> 00:14:00,171
because it's gonna take a miracle
to turn these mutts into show dogs.

279
00:14:03,545 --> 00:14:05,690
Hey, girls,
let's talk beauty.

280
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:14,423
What's up, brother?

281
00:14:16,818 --> 00:14:18,701
I'm sorry. You are...

282
00:14:18,777 --> 00:14:20,120
Carlos from
down the street.

283
00:14:24,936 --> 00:14:26,373
We were only
best friends, dude.

284
00:14:28,736 --> 00:14:30,352
Things have been
a little fuzzy,

285
00:14:30,968 --> 00:14:31,921
since the accident.

286
00:14:32,135 --> 00:14:34,781
I'm sorry that I, uh,
I hadn't come by sooner,

287
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:37,000
but my divorce has
been kicking my ass.

288
00:14:38,088 --> 00:14:39,052
I'm sorry to hear that.

289
00:14:39,408 --> 00:14:42,700
Anyway, I got a new condo,
but it's getting renovated,

290
00:14:43,647 --> 00:14:45,840
So I was thinking
maybe I could crash here.

291
00:14:47,038 --> 00:14:47,562
Here?

292
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:50,370
Yeah, I could help you
out around the house,

293
00:14:50,476 --> 00:14:52,913
and free you up to focus
on job one,

294
00:14:53,248 --> 00:14:54,102
getting better.

295
00:14:55,685 --> 00:14:57,311
'Cause you're tossing it
to Edie now, right?

296
00:14:58,505 --> 00:15:00,300
That's a real
relationship killer,

297
00:15:01,008 --> 00:15:02,881
needing your lady
to hoist you off the can.

298
00:15:05,016 --> 00:15:06,242
How long are we talking?

299
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,821
Couple months.
Three at the most.

300
00:15:09,445 --> 00:15:12,211
And, of course, I can kick in
for half the utilities and rent.

301
00:15:16,766 --> 00:15:19,093
Well, how can I say no
to my best friend?

302
00:15:26,156 --> 00:15:27,343
Can you do a kickflip?

303
00:15:27,508 --> 00:15:30,761
What are the Blake kids
doing all the way over here?

304
00:15:31,256 --> 00:15:33,181
Pam needs to keep
a closer eye on them.

305
00:15:33,188 --> 00:15:35,371
Will you please come
away from that window?

306
00:15:35,376 --> 00:15:37,781
You barely slept last night.
Come on. Take a nap.

307
00:15:38,007 --> 00:15:39,722
I'm fine. I'm fine.

308
00:15:42,668 --> 00:15:43,453
Hold on.

309
00:15:51,297 --> 00:15:52,831
Hey, what's up?

310
00:15:53,295 --> 00:15:55,110
I've been meaning to
get this back to you,

311
00:15:55,157 --> 00:15:56,530
and to thank you.

312
00:15:57,305 --> 00:15:59,660
Rebecca and I really
enjoyed the cake.

313
00:16:00,177 --> 00:16:01,342
Oh! Good.

314
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:03,592
So...

315
00:16:05,797 --> 00:16:06,312
Bye.

316
00:16:07,115 --> 00:16:08,421
So what'd you think
of our place?

317
00:16:10,417 --> 00:16:10,992
Sorry?

318
00:16:12,027 --> 00:16:14,122
I heard you were good friends
with the Young family.

319
00:16:14,137 --> 00:16:16,882
It must have been weird being in
there with all the new furniture.

320
00:16:17,775 --> 00:16:19,142
I didn't notice.

321
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:20,631
Well, how about
the kitchen?

322
00:16:20,928 --> 00:16:23,392
Rebecca likes the color,
but I'm not so sure.

323
00:16:23,795 --> 00:16:26,410
Oh, sorry. Never made it
past the living room.

324
00:16:26,828 --> 00:16:29,743
What?! Come on!
You're in an empty house,

325
00:16:29,747 --> 00:16:31,522
curious about
your new neighbors...

326
00:16:31,555 --> 00:16:33,982
You look around.
We all do it.

327
00:16:34,137 --> 00:16:35,420
Well, I don't.

328
00:16:38,638 --> 00:16:41,410
Well,  next time you're over,
I'll have to give you the tour.

329
00:16:41,947 --> 00:16:42,493
Great, great.

330
00:16:43,065 --> 00:16:44,513
Mr. Protector man!

331
00:16:45,077 --> 00:16:46,342
Hey, hey,
not now, Parker.

332
00:16:46,777 --> 00:16:49,642
I just wanted to see if I can
play his pinball machine again.

333
00:16:58,456 --> 00:17:00,213
I guess there's no
need for that tour.

334
00:17:09,636 --> 00:17:11,031
All right, girls,
first things first things first.

335
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:12,592
If you can't walk,
you can't win.

336
00:17:13,087 --> 00:17:13,782
Hit it, Vern!

337
00:17:15,216 --> 00:17:18,653
Remember, eyes forward,
shoulders back, hips square.

338
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:21,853
Look left, look right,
whip and walk.

339
00:17:25,668 --> 00:17:27,492
Yes, I'm unbelievable.
Close your mouths.

340
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:46,672
Stop, stop.

341
00:17:47,488 --> 00:17:48,090
What?

342
00:17:48,378 --> 00:17:51,051
My eyes were forward,
my hips were square.

343
00:17:51,085 --> 00:17:54,462
But where's your confidence?
Where's your pride?

344
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:57,230
Come on. What do
I have to be proud of?

345
00:18:08,668 --> 00:18:10,652
Have you guys ever
seen a runway model

346
00:18:10,657 --> 00:18:12,680
without the hot
clothes and makeup?

347
00:18:14,336 --> 00:18:16,463
Well, trust me,
they're not that special,

348
00:18:16,886 --> 00:18:20,512
But the one thing that
they do have is attitude.

349
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:22,660
You have to
believe in yourself,

350
00:18:22,915 --> 00:18:25,912
and if not, pretend to
believe in yourself, okay?

351
00:18:27,557 --> 00:18:28,250
All right.

352
00:18:28,818 --> 00:18:31,820
Now I want you to pretend
you're on the runway...

353
00:18:32,206 --> 00:18:33,940
Flashbulbs are popping,

354
00:18:34,407 --> 00:18:37,170
everyone's looking at you,
envying you,

355
00:18:37,327 --> 00:18:39,981
and they're all thinking
the same thing...

356
00:18:40,566 --> 00:18:44,491
Isabel Horowitz
is smoking hot!

357
00:18:46,976 --> 00:18:48,402
Go, Isabel! Go!

358
00:18:53,457 --> 00:18:55,731
You're doing it!
Isabel, you're doing it!

359
00:18:56,115 --> 00:18:57,131
That's it! Keep going!

360
00:19:02,897 --> 00:19:04,052
I was walking!

361
00:19:04,887 --> 00:19:06,440
You were
totally walking!

362
00:19:06,998 --> 00:19:08,070
Good job!

363
00:19:08,335 --> 00:19:09,512
All right, Donna, you're next.

364
00:19:10,188 --> 00:19:12,110
Get up there and make
me hate your beauty.

365
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:18,023
Now this place is a real
diamond in the rough.

366
00:19:18,587 --> 00:19:20,802
Cozy little
two-bedroom plus den,

367
00:19:21,305 --> 00:19:23,121
with a highly
motivated seller.

368
00:19:23,556 --> 00:19:25,881
Oh, look, a highly
motivated cockroach.

369
00:19:28,545 --> 00:19:30,122
Let's try to be
positive, people.

370
00:19:30,308 --> 00:19:31,572
It's a fabulous location.

371
00:19:31,816 --> 00:19:35,282
Just walking distance
to all sorts of fun shops.

372
00:19:35,745 --> 00:19:39,640
Right, from here I can see a bail
bondsman and an adult bookshop.

373
00:19:42,225 --> 00:19:44,861
What do you expect in
your price range, "Tara"?

374
00:19:46,398 --> 00:19:47,203
Let's go.

375
00:19:47,558 --> 00:19:48,193
Thank you.

376
00:19:48,637 --> 00:19:49,300
Wait.

377
00:19:50,165 --> 00:19:51,842
I'm not an
impractical woman.

378
00:19:52,186 --> 00:19:54,533
I know that my son's
resources are...

379
00:19:54,775 --> 00:19:57,450
like his achievements,
rather limited.

380
00:19:58,977 --> 00:20:00,101
I want to see
the rest of it.

381
00:20:01,805 --> 00:20:02,462
Okay.

382
00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:05,420
Now the lighting in the
kitchen is a bit harsh.

383
00:20:05,585 --> 00:20:07,451
The previous owner...
Well, let's just say

384
00:20:07,467 --> 00:20:10,663
he ran some sort of
home-based medical business.

385
00:20:12,486 --> 00:20:14,581
You cannot let your mother
move into this neighborhood.

386
00:20:14,675 --> 00:20:16,881
It's filled with
junkies and whores.

387
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,282
And we'll owe
them all an apology,

388
00:20:18,288 --> 00:20:19,672
but who cares?
She likes it.

389
00:20:19,698 --> 00:20:20,632
Of course she likes it.

390
00:20:20,827 --> 00:20:23,133
There's a 24-hour liquor
store across the street.

391
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,341
She wants a house.

392
00:20:24,346 --> 00:20:27,023
This ithe best we can afford
without bankrupting ourselves.

393
00:20:27,058 --> 00:20:29,123
Orson, what if something
should happen to her?

394
00:20:29,168 --> 00:20:32,042
Stop worrying about her.
Worry about us.

395
00:20:32,235 --> 00:20:34,561
Do you realize how much we've
been fighting since she came?

396
00:20:34,848 --> 00:20:36,881
The woman's ruined
every relationship

397
00:20:36,906 --> 00:20:38,711
that's mattered to me,
and she's doing it again.

398
00:20:39,788 --> 00:20:40,721
Oh, my God!

399
00:20:44,186 --> 00:20:45,183
-Are you all right?
-Oh! Mother?

400
00:20:45,498 --> 00:20:48,403
It's just a little spill.
Her cane hit a loose tile.

401
00:20:48,545 --> 00:20:49,583
Is anything broken?

402
00:20:49,587 --> 00:20:51,853
Well, obviously, the damn floor.

403
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:53,622
We'll need that fixed
before she moves in.

404
00:20:53,678 --> 00:20:54,820
Are you insane?!

405
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,841
She obviously can't
be on her own.

406
00:20:56,877 --> 00:20:58,303
Why, it's a loose tile.

407
00:20:58,305 --> 00:21:00,593
-I'm perfectly fine.
-And what if you weren't?

408
00:21:00,768 --> 00:21:03,850
What if she had broken something
and she was lying here for hours?

409
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:05,231
You are coming home with us.

410
00:21:05,285 --> 00:21:05,621
Bree...

411
00:21:05,627 --> 00:21:07,923
And I will not hear
another word on the subject.

412
00:21:11,417 --> 00:21:13,072
I can't believe
you bought us pizza.

413
00:21:13,518 --> 00:21:14,772
Well, you guys earned it.

414
00:21:15,127 --> 00:21:17,750
But eat fast, because we only
have one hour left, and I want

415
00:21:17,767 --> 00:21:20,500
to introduce you to your new
best friend, Mr. Spray Tan.

416
00:21:21,147 --> 00:21:23,412
You know so much cool stuff.

417
00:21:23,726 --> 00:21:25,130
Can't you come back another day?

418
00:21:25,175 --> 00:21:26,541
Oh, I don't know.

419
00:21:26,688 --> 00:21:28,261
-Please?
-You have to.

420
00:21:29,485 --> 00:21:31,230
Well, let me
check my book.

421
00:21:31,238 --> 00:21:32,892
I might have to move
some stuff around,

422
00:21:32,895 --> 00:21:34,023
but I think I can swing it.

423
00:21:34,118 --> 00:21:36,673
Your life must be
so exciting, huh?

424
00:21:37,815 --> 00:21:39,852
Yeah, every
day's a parade.

425
00:21:41,118 --> 00:21:44,261
So what was it like
being a famous model?

426
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:45,821
Honestly, it was
like any other job,

427
00:21:45,825 --> 00:21:49,441
except the pay was great,
the clothes were couture,

428
00:21:49,728 --> 00:21:51,783
and the parties were
just this side of Gomorrah.

429
00:21:54,145 --> 00:21:55,883
You don't know what
Gomorrah means, do you?

430
00:21:58,606 --> 00:21:59,283
Good.

431
00:22:00,266 --> 00:22:01,611
Did you know Kate Moss?

432
00:22:02,168 --> 00:22:03,552
I invited her to a party once.

433
00:22:03,676 --> 00:22:04,790
Did you eat pizza with her?

434
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:07,510
'Cause if you did, it's almost
like we ate pizza with her.

435
00:22:07,598 --> 00:22:09,401
Well, honey, most
models don't eat pizza.

436
00:22:10,075 --> 00:22:12,452
Well, at least not without
having a finger for dessert.

437
00:22:14,516 --> 00:22:15,390
Gross.

438
00:22:15,805 --> 00:22:16,980
I know. I never did that.

439
00:22:17,845 --> 00:22:20,923
You would not believe the horrible
things these girls did to stay skinny.

440
00:22:21,217 --> 00:22:22,063
Like what?

441
00:22:22,355 --> 00:22:25,503
Well, some would smoke those
unfiltered french cigarettes.

442
00:22:26,075 --> 00:22:27,643
But cigarettes
can kill you.

443
00:22:27,808 --> 00:22:29,811
But before they do,
they kill your appetite.

444
00:22:31,996 --> 00:22:33,041
One time,

445
00:22:33,455 --> 00:22:36,621
there was a girl who took
too many laxatives, and, uh...

446
00:22:36,995 --> 00:22:39,610
Well, if you're ever at the
Chateau Milan in room 238,

447
00:22:39,615 --> 00:22:41,622
do not use the jacuzzi.

448
00:22:43,207 --> 00:22:45,080
Do you have to be
skinny to be a model?

449
00:22:45,377 --> 00:22:48,851
Well, yeah. When's the last time you
saw a fat person on a magazine cover?

450
00:22:49,406 --> 00:22:52,010
Now I'm gonna go talk to
Vern about our next session.

451
00:22:52,128 --> 00:22:54,192
You guys finish lunch
so we can get back to work.

452
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,762
Hi, Rupert!

453
00:23:09,067 --> 00:23:12,363
I went to the mall and bought a change of clothes
for the weekend, and while I was there,

454
00:23:12,368 --> 00:23:13,892
I got something for you.

455
00:23:14,766 --> 00:23:16,740
I thought you could
wear it on your day off.

456
00:23:18,626 --> 00:23:19,471
Do you like it?

457
00:23:20,475 --> 00:23:21,473
Very much.

458
00:23:22,248 --> 00:23:23,401
It'll come in handy,

459
00:23:23,686 --> 00:23:26,181
should my nationality
ever slip my mind.

460
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,283
That was good.

461
00:23:31,075 --> 00:23:34,041
You... I wanna
party with you.

462
00:23:35,635 --> 00:23:39,093
Hey, I was thinking this afternoon
maybe we could go look for that drawer.

463
00:23:39,438 --> 00:23:40,523
Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am.

464
00:23:40,528 --> 00:23:42,512
I'm afraid I have
all this silver to polish.

465
00:23:42,567 --> 00:23:45,391
Well, let me help you,
and we can talk.

466
00:23:45,736 --> 00:23:48,800
There is so much
I wanna know about you.

467
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,450
Who is Rupert
Cavanaugh?

468
00:23:51,945 --> 00:23:53,403
What makes him tick?

469
00:23:56,757 --> 00:24:00,151
Tell you what. Let's go
find you that drawer, hmm?

470
00:24:03,138 --> 00:24:05,120
Oh, isn't the master
bedroom down that way?

471
00:24:05,378 --> 00:24:07,300
I realize it's
a bit of a jaunt,

472
00:24:07,578 --> 00:24:10,581
But I managed to find
you an entire bureau.

473
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:14,292
Okay, well, you certainly
didn't have to go to all that...

474
00:24:15,828 --> 00:24:16,492
trouble.

475
00:24:17,646 --> 00:24:18,720
Is there a problem?

476
00:24:20,136 --> 00:24:22,220
No, I just, um...

477
00:24:22,967 --> 00:24:25,683
Well, all I really needed
was just a little...

478
00:24:25,948 --> 00:24:27,402
Little drawer, and, uh...

479
00:24:27,827 --> 00:24:30,550
this is just so far away
and what is that smell?

480
00:24:31,157 --> 00:24:32,962
Oh, yes, about that...

481
00:24:33,127 --> 00:24:35,860
The cat passed
away in this room.

482
00:24:37,516 --> 00:24:39,730
Did you consider
removing the body?

483
00:24:40,028 --> 00:24:41,553
Well, if this
isn't acceptable,

484
00:24:41,557 --> 00:24:43,762
I can look elsewhere
for a drawer

485
00:24:43,765 --> 00:24:45,663
when I have the time.

486
00:24:46,935 --> 00:24:48,320
Why do you have
to be this way?

487
00:24:49,678 --> 00:24:50,700
What way is that?

488
00:24:51,185 --> 00:24:53,201
Listen, I know how
you feel about Jane,

489
00:24:53,206 --> 00:24:55,130
but if you could just
give me a chance...

490
00:24:55,138 --> 00:24:56,442
I mean, come on,

491
00:24:56,676 --> 00:24:59,851
you can't possibly hate
me this much, can you?

492
00:25:01,436 --> 00:25:02,072
I'm done.

493
00:25:02,615 --> 00:25:04,631
Fine. Fine,
fine, fine, fine.

494
00:25:04,897 --> 00:25:06,553
I don't need you
to like me,

495
00:25:06,896 --> 00:25:09,101
but I think you should
give me just a little respect.

496
00:25:09,428 --> 00:25:10,753
I am Ian's girlfriend.

497
00:25:11,995 --> 00:25:13,250
He's still married.

498
00:25:14,547 --> 00:25:16,812
At best,
you're his mistress.

499
00:25:17,717 --> 00:25:20,540
Okay, you are not
allowed to call me that.

500
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:23,752
Fine. What term
would you prefer?

501
00:25:24,168 --> 00:25:26,383
Concubine? Consort?

502
00:25:26,695 --> 00:25:28,413
Gold-digging whore?

503
00:25:30,526 --> 00:25:31,763
I'm so sorry.

504
00:25:31,776 --> 00:25:33,892
I'm, I shouldn't
have done that.

505
00:25:34,067 --> 00:25:35,893
But, Rupert,
you have to admit,

506
00:25:36,156 --> 00:25:37,290
it's just a drawer.

507
00:25:37,877 --> 00:25:40,763
Those drawers are
filled with Jane's things.

508
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:42,393
This is her house.

509
00:25:42,728 --> 00:25:44,702
You are a guest
in her house,

510
00:25:45,138 --> 00:25:46,863
and a temporary
one at best.

511
00:25:46,867 --> 00:25:49,991
Okay, you know,
that is for Ian to decide.

512
00:25:50,256 --> 00:25:51,611
Oh, he has decided.

513
00:25:53,117 --> 00:25:55,423
Why do you think he never
told me about you?

514
00:25:55,818 --> 00:25:58,292
Why did he wait so long
to bring you here?

515
00:25:58,758 --> 00:26:00,813
He didn't want you
in that room,

516
00:26:01,677 --> 00:26:06,433
where he still keeps Jane's
things exactly as she left them.

517
00:26:11,757 --> 00:26:12,362
But...

518
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:15,040
I'll keep looking
for that drawer.

519
00:26:21,095 --> 00:26:22,792
Hey, I'm going
over to Mike's.

520
00:26:23,106 --> 00:26:24,370
I thought you were
gonna mow the lawn.

521
00:26:25,128 --> 00:26:28,162
I know. It's just that I promised
I'd help him install a shower bar,

522
00:26:28,167 --> 00:26:30,331
And, um,
it could take a while.

523
00:26:31,055 --> 00:26:31,593
Okay.

524
00:26:35,937 --> 00:26:38,233
T-Rex. How they
hanging, brother?

525
00:26:38,455 --> 00:26:39,791
Low and lazy.

526
00:26:39,796 --> 00:26:41,022
-Here you go.
-Yeah.

527
00:26:41,675 --> 00:26:43,172
Hey, if Lynette asks,

528
00:26:43,726 --> 00:26:45,361
I installed your
shower bar today.

529
00:26:45,668 --> 00:26:46,383
Got it.

530
00:26:50,228 --> 00:26:51,912
Vern, what are
you doing here?

531
00:26:51,957 --> 00:26:52,672
We need to talk.

532
00:26:52,698 --> 00:26:53,863
Is it about the
girls' makeup?

533
00:26:53,888 --> 00:26:55,823
'Cause I got them each
their own makeup kit,

534
00:26:55,845 --> 00:26:57,952
custom-tailored
to match their skin tone.

535
00:26:58,148 --> 00:27:00,451
And I got melina some wax.
I know she's only 11,

536
00:27:00,508 --> 00:27:03,120
but those greek genes are
gonna kick in any day now.

537
00:27:04,968 --> 00:27:05,453
What?

538
00:27:05,615 --> 00:27:08,240
This morning, Mrs. Hayes caught
Donna her finger down her throat,

539
00:27:08,245 --> 00:27:09,850
trying to barf up
her toaster waffle.

540
00:27:11,145 --> 00:27:11,740
Really?

541
00:27:11,828 --> 00:27:14,672
And Mrs. Horowitz found Isabel
behind their garage smoking.

542
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:17,802
Apparently, she thought cigarettes
would help her lose a few pounds.

543
00:27:18,116 --> 00:27:19,622
Where do you think
she got that idea?

544
00:27:21,836 --> 00:27:23,630
Those damn tobacco companies!

545
00:27:23,636 --> 00:27:24,263
Gaby!

546
00:27:24,485 --> 00:27:27,532
Fine, I may have told a few
stories about the old days,

547
00:27:27,537 --> 00:27:28,890
but as a warning.

548
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:30,882
I didn't say anything
inappropriate for kids.

549
00:27:30,965 --> 00:27:33,573
Cassie Warren asked her mother
If she could throw a Gomorrah party.

550
00:27:35,295 --> 00:27:37,792
Okay, look, we have to do
damage control. I get it.

551
00:27:38,018 --> 00:27:40,091
Next session,
I'll apologize to all the moms.

552
00:27:40,108 --> 00:27:42,101
Unh-unh, there's not gonna
be a next session for you.

553
00:27:43,686 --> 00:27:45,950
The moms don't want you
anywhere near their daughters.

554
00:27:47,108 --> 00:27:48,740
But I'm helping them.

555
00:27:49,077 --> 00:27:50,350
They love me!

556
00:27:50,667 --> 00:27:51,550
Wait, please, Vern,

557
00:27:51,558 --> 00:27:53,700
you have to give me
a chance to fix this.

558
00:27:53,756 --> 00:27:56,730
It's too late, Gaby. You are
now officially a bad influence.

559
00:27:58,108 --> 00:28:00,082
Well, see you
at spin class.

560
00:28:13,507 --> 00:28:15,121
Mom said we couldn't leave.

561
00:28:15,835 --> 00:28:17,321
I'm just going out front.

562
00:28:22,338 --> 00:28:24,233
What the hell is that?!

563
00:28:24,547 --> 00:28:27,081
Stop running the ball!

564
00:28:28,395 --> 00:28:29,700
Can I ask you
guys something?

565
00:28:31,448 --> 00:28:33,690
What was I like
before the accident?

566
00:28:34,715 --> 00:28:35,493
What do you mean?

567
00:28:36,355 --> 00:28:37,530
I mean,
what kind of guy was I?

568
00:28:37,536 --> 00:28:39,723
Was I happy? Was I angry?

569
00:28:41,385 --> 00:28:43,413
Did I ever get violent?

570
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:47,722
You were fine.

571
00:28:53,597 --> 00:28:54,772
I'm serious.

572
00:28:55,835 --> 00:28:56,962
I really need to know.

573
00:28:58,246 --> 00:29:00,330
You can be honest.
You're my best friend.

574
00:29:05,407 --> 00:29:06,312
Honestly?

575
00:29:07,705 --> 00:29:09,913
You were sort of mysterious,
kept to yourself.

576
00:29:10,966 --> 00:29:12,452
Nobody really knew
you all that well.

577
00:29:15,976 --> 00:29:17,423
And this is coming
from your best friend.

578
00:29:25,996 --> 00:29:27,001
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

579
00:29:27,458 --> 00:29:28,263
Yes!

580
00:29:34,708 --> 00:29:36,763
I'm sorry, guys,
I just...

581
00:29:37,636 --> 00:29:39,373
I guess I was really tired.

582
00:29:40,997 --> 00:29:41,952
Where's your brother?

583
00:29:42,257 --> 00:29:44,072
-He went outside.
-Yeah.

584
00:29:45,435 --> 00:29:46,012
What...

585
00:29:46,935 --> 00:29:49,190
Okay, watch her!
Watch her.

586
00:29:49,395 --> 00:29:50,980
I'll be back.
I'll be right back.

587
00:29:52,548 --> 00:29:54,903
Hello? Open up!
Open the door!

588
00:29:55,955 --> 00:29:57,081
Lynette? What's the matter?

589
00:29:57,256 --> 00:29:58,091
I want my son.

590
00:29:58,515 --> 00:29:59,260
He's not here.

591
00:29:59,335 --> 00:30:01,401
He's not at our house,
he's not in our yard.

592
00:30:01,575 --> 00:30:03,561
Do not jerk me around.

593
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:04,690
Parker!

594
00:30:05,007 --> 00:30:07,452
You can't just barge into
my house like this, Lynette.

595
00:30:07,467 --> 00:30:08,893
Don't play dumb with me.

596
00:30:08,908 --> 00:30:11,260
I know exactly what
is down here!

597
00:30:14,588 --> 00:30:16,470
Where's the pinball?
Where's all the games?

598
00:30:16,846 --> 00:30:19,701
Oh, that was a collection I was
taking up for the children's hospital.

599
00:30:21,925 --> 00:30:23,372
I delivered
everything yesterday.

600
00:30:26,697 --> 00:30:28,293
Did you donate
the photos, too?

601
00:30:32,316 --> 00:30:33,300
Parker!

602
00:30:36,785 --> 00:30:38,663
What exactly is it
you're accusing me of?

603
00:30:38,665 --> 00:30:41,282
Don't pretend you don't know.
I'm calling the police.

604
00:30:41,505 --> 00:30:42,372
Parker!

605
00:30:42,388 --> 00:30:43,410
Is there a problem?

606
00:30:44,587 --> 00:30:45,640
You're damn right
there's a problem.

607
00:30:45,648 --> 00:30:47,371
I can't find my son.

608
00:30:48,898 --> 00:30:49,940
Isn't that your son?

609
00:31:00,968 --> 00:31:01,770
Hey, hey!

610
00:31:03,306 --> 00:31:05,372
Where have you been?!

611
00:31:05,596 --> 00:31:08,060
We were at Mike's.
He wandered over looking for me.

612
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:09,530
What's going on?

613
00:31:19,578 --> 00:31:22,641
Well, that was the
children's hospital.

614
00:31:23,337 --> 00:31:24,951
Art's story checks out.

615
00:31:25,616 --> 00:31:27,153
He donated all that stuff.

616
00:31:29,896 --> 00:31:32,782
That proves nothing. He knew I was on
to him. He had to dump it someplace.

617
00:31:32,786 --> 00:31:34,802
Honey, believe me,
I am with you.

618
00:31:34,808 --> 00:31:36,682
There is something fishy
about this guy.

619
00:31:36,836 --> 00:31:37,920
But you gotta get a grip.

620
00:31:37,945 --> 00:31:40,290
You can't go barging
into people's homes.

621
00:31:40,295 --> 00:31:42,871
-What if Parker had been in there?
-But he wasn't,

622
00:31:43,447 --> 00:31:45,841
And if you keep accusing
this guy whout proof,

623
00:31:47,246 --> 00:31:48,451
he can sue us.

624
00:31:52,028 --> 00:31:52,791
Listen...

625
00:31:54,498 --> 00:31:56,930
I've been thinking that after everything
that you have been through...

626
00:31:56,936 --> 00:31:58,792
Please don't bring up
the supermarket again.

627
00:31:58,797 --> 00:32:00,611
That was
a traumatic experience.

628
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:03,291
I think it's affected you
more than you realize.

629
00:32:08,225 --> 00:32:10,492
And maybe you need to talk
to somebody about it...

630
00:32:13,808 --> 00:32:14,952
Like a therast.

631
00:32:18,788 --> 00:32:21,600
You're right.
I need to talk to someone.

632
00:32:23,737 --> 00:32:25,791
He'd gotten rid
of everything...

633
00:32:25,937 --> 00:32:29,160
The toys, the pictures,
everything was gone.

634
00:32:32,108 --> 00:32:33,393
You can't sit
on this, Lynette.

635
00:32:33,667 --> 00:32:35,133
I know!

636
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:39,100
If something happened to someone's
kid because I kept my mouth shut...

637
00:32:41,316 --> 00:32:43,892
The thing is,
I promised Tom I'd back off.

638
00:32:45,155 --> 00:32:46,460
Well, I didn't.

639
00:33:05,875 --> 00:33:07,423
Jane has
some beautiful things.

640
00:33:08,385 --> 00:33:11,051
Yes, she's always had
impeccable taste.

641
00:33:15,066 --> 00:33:17,803
I, um, I know how
it must seem to you.

642
00:33:17,808 --> 00:33:19,982
My holding on to them.

643
00:33:20,706 --> 00:33:23,081
But I justouldn't
bring myself to...

644
00:33:23,186 --> 00:33:23,963
I get it.

645
00:33:26,255 --> 00:33:29,020
As much as I have
tried to pretend that

646
00:33:29,718 --> 00:33:31,100
it's just you and me.

647
00:33:32,405 --> 00:33:34,602
There's three of us
in this relationship.

648
00:33:34,905 --> 00:33:36,980
Susan, you know
I adore you.

649
00:33:37,095 --> 00:33:38,441
No, please, listen...

650
00:33:39,898 --> 00:33:41,163
The last couple of months,

651
00:33:41,787 --> 00:33:43,261
I thought we've
gotten really close,

652
00:33:43,265 --> 00:33:44,892
and I have been loving that.

653
00:33:45,455 --> 00:33:46,952
I just feel like lately...

654
00:33:48,137 --> 00:33:51,353
There's thisimit to how
far you'll let me in.

655
00:33:53,978 --> 00:33:55,330
Well, I'm trying.

656
00:33:55,528 --> 00:33:59,293
It's just the, um, the more
I let you into my heart,

657
00:33:59,297 --> 00:34:02,190
the more I feel I'm
pushing Jane out and...

658
00:34:02,288 --> 00:34:05,651
You don't have to push
Jane out to let me in.

659
00:34:09,428 --> 00:34:11,703
Of course. You're right.

660
00:34:17,135 --> 00:34:18,191
Do you know what I think?

661
00:34:18,796 --> 00:34:19,231
No.

662
00:34:19,438 --> 00:34:24,112
That kind of compassionate wisdom
deserves an obscenely expensive meal.

663
00:34:25,816 --> 00:34:26,890
Okay, well,
give me a minute,

664
00:34:26,906 --> 00:34:29,011
and I will change
into something nice.

665
00:34:30,246 --> 00:34:32,110
Rupert still hasn't
found you a drawer?

666
00:34:32,927 --> 00:34:34,072
No, not just yet.

667
00:34:36,848 --> 00:34:38,411
Well, in that case...

668
00:34:43,645 --> 00:34:45,221
Ian, you don't
have to do that.

669
00:34:47,008 --> 00:34:49,103
If I can make room in
my heart for both of you,

670
00:34:49,138 --> 00:34:51,621
I can certainly make
room in my bureau.

671
00:34:58,087 --> 00:35:00,700
It's just not right.
Your mother skipped lunch, too.

672
00:35:00,885 --> 00:35:02,022
She said she
wasn't hungry.

673
00:35:02,296 --> 00:35:04,302
Can't we just revel
in her absence?

674
00:35:04,467 --> 00:35:07,270
I know she's a handful, but she
deserves some compassion.

675
00:35:07,718 --> 00:35:10,251
The woman watched
a dream die yesterday.

676
00:35:13,686 --> 00:35:15,071
I'm taking her dinner up.

677
00:35:15,417 --> 00:35:16,923
Oh, that's okay.
I'll do it.

678
00:35:17,055 --> 00:35:18,691
Oh, no,
I'd rather do it myself.

679
00:35:19,006 --> 00:35:20,100
I wanna talk to her.

680
00:35:20,215 --> 00:35:22,190
Oh, well, I'll let her
know you're coming.

681
00:35:27,168 --> 00:35:28,503
Mom's coming.
Ditch the wine.

682
00:35:28,758 --> 00:35:29,692
Very well.

683
00:35:30,856 --> 00:35:32,381
You finished the
whole bottle already?

684
00:35:33,476 --> 00:35:35,500
I was... thirsty.

685
00:35:35,685 --> 00:35:37,160
Gloria, I've been
thinking and...

686
00:35:37,165 --> 00:35:39,402
Does no one in this house
ever bother to knock?

687
00:35:39,756 --> 00:35:40,993
Is that alcohol?

688
00:35:41,615 --> 00:35:42,821
Where did you get that?

689
00:35:45,507 --> 00:35:46,480
Andrew!

690
00:35:47,605 --> 00:35:51,420
When my grandma asks me a favor
with tears in her eyes, how...

691
00:35:51,467 --> 00:35:53,632
Oh, shut up,
you little extortionist.

692
00:35:53,675 --> 00:35:57,013
He charged me 20 bucks,
plus 5 for the corkscrew.

693
00:35:57,358 --> 00:35:58,493
I'll deal with you later.

694
00:35:59,747 --> 00:36:01,500
You can kiss that
codeine good-bye.

695
00:36:04,897 --> 00:36:06,202
Andrew brought her wine.

696
00:36:06,516 --> 00:36:07,703
Oh, for God's sake.

697
00:36:08,777 --> 00:36:09,791
This is our house.

698
00:36:10,425 --> 00:36:14,513
If you expect to stay here, You're
going to learn to obey a few rules.

699
00:36:14,647 --> 00:36:17,570
I don't obey rules.
I make them.

700
00:36:17,665 --> 00:36:18,882
Not anymore, mother.

701
00:36:18,995 --> 00:36:22,110
Just watch yourself,
sonny boy.

702
00:36:22,736 --> 00:36:23,691
Okay, look,

703
00:36:23,905 --> 00:36:27,000
I know you're upset, but don't
blame Orson. It's not his fault.

704
00:36:27,096 --> 00:36:29,101
It's all his fault.

705
00:36:29,858 --> 00:36:31,840
You think he's so wonderful.

706
00:36:32,096 --> 00:36:33,863
You don't know the half
of what he's done.

707
00:36:34,427 --> 00:36:37,111
Let's go. I can't deal with
her when she's like this.

708
00:36:37,685 --> 00:36:39,161
He doesn't want you
to hear the truth,

709
00:36:39,275 --> 00:36:40,622
how he cheated on Alma.

710
00:36:42,555 --> 00:36:43,110
What?

711
00:36:43,955 --> 00:36:45,641
She's drunk!

712
00:36:45,677 --> 00:36:47,961
How he broke her
heart... and mine,

713
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:50,640
All for his precious Monique.

714
00:36:50,677 --> 00:36:52,063
You shut up, mother.

715
00:36:52,336 --> 00:36:53,382
Monique Polier?

716
00:36:54,227 --> 00:36:56,200
I thought that was
Harvey Bigsby's mistress.

717
00:36:56,258 --> 00:36:59,431
Oh, she got around,
that girl!

718
00:36:59,466 --> 00:37:01,971
See, I told you.
I told you she would do this.

719
00:37:02,098 --> 00:37:04,092
There he was,
cheating on Alma,

720
00:37:04,105 --> 00:37:07,623
not knowing all the time his
whore was cheating on him.

721
00:37:07,676 --> 00:37:10,120
Stop it!
You shut your evil mouth!

722
00:37:10,187 --> 00:37:10,971
Or what?!

723
00:37:11,507 --> 00:37:14,982
What are you gonna do to me
that hasn't already been done?

724
00:37:24,977 --> 00:37:25,593
Bree...

725
00:37:26,187 --> 00:37:26,800
Bree!

726
00:37:27,557 --> 00:37:28,373
Bree, no!

727
00:37:29,626 --> 00:37:30,771
Bree, wait!

728
00:37:31,886 --> 00:37:32,493
Bree!

729
00:38:00,566 --> 00:38:02,962
I know. I thought
it was so adorable.

730
00:38:03,177 --> 00:38:04,630
-Skirt...
-I know!

731
00:38:07,436 --> 00:38:08,502
Miss Gabrielle!

732
00:38:10,027 --> 00:38:11,450
What is she doing here?

733
00:38:11,688 --> 00:38:12,511
I have no idea.

734
00:38:12,688 --> 00:38:13,910
I told her she was banned.

735
00:38:14,538 --> 00:38:16,003
Okay, just give
me a minute.

736
00:38:17,335 --> 00:38:20,452
I'm sorry about what
I said to the girls,

737
00:38:20,456 --> 00:38:22,083
and it won't
happen again.

738
00:38:22,507 --> 00:38:25,372
Damn right. You're not going
anywhere near our girls.

739
00:38:26,025 --> 00:38:28,002
Can't you give me
a second chance?

740
00:38:28,227 --> 00:38:29,042
Why should we?

741
00:38:29,185 --> 00:38:33,680
Yeah, I mean, you walk in here all
clickety-clack, perfect little miss size zero,

742
00:38:33,718 --> 00:38:35,263
thinking you're all
better than us.

743
00:38:35,765 --> 00:38:38,442
We all saw the look on your
face when you showed up.

744
00:38:39,915 --> 00:38:41,703
I don't think
I'm better than you.

745
00:38:41,708 --> 00:38:43,323
Hell, I envy you.

746
00:38:43,406 --> 00:38:44,661
Please.

747
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:46,213
No, it's true.

748
00:38:46,516 --> 00:38:50,701
You have husbands and families and
a reason to wake up in the morning.

749
00:38:51,165 --> 00:38:52,190
What do I have?

750
00:38:53,286 --> 00:38:54,011
Him.

751
00:38:55,517 --> 00:38:58,130
Teaching your kids
about confidence and

752
00:38:58,138 --> 00:39:00,621
beauty is the most useful
thing I've done since...

753
00:39:01,407 --> 00:39:02,651
I don't know when.

754
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:07,432
And as much as
I've helped them...

755
00:39:09,398 --> 00:39:11,111
They've helped me
so much more.

756
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:15,901
So please, I need this.

757
00:39:20,698 --> 00:39:23,922
And I promise, no more talk
about dodgy weight loss methods.

758
00:39:28,068 --> 00:39:31,253
Like the highly effective,
non-F.D.A. approved diet pill

759
00:39:31,258 --> 00:39:32,910
I can get from my
friends in zurich...

760
00:39:34,837 --> 00:39:35,451
in bulk.

761
00:39:40,156 --> 00:39:42,831
Well, I suppose the Christian
thing would be to forgive her.

762
00:39:47,267 --> 00:39:49,351
Well, why don't you
ladies talk it over?

763
00:39:49,357 --> 00:39:52,160
And I'm gonna work on
posture with the girls.

764
00:39:52,186 --> 00:39:53,381
Yeah! Come on!

765
00:39:53,406 --> 00:39:54,623
Come on, you guys.
Let's go!

766
00:39:54,626 --> 00:39:55,952
As long they're safe...

767
00:40:03,518 --> 00:40:04,862
Oh, thank God.

768
00:40:05,976 --> 00:40:08,122
I've been driving around
all night looking for you.

769
00:40:10,338 --> 00:40:13,261
We saw that woman
at the morgue...

770
00:40:14,138 --> 00:40:15,201
On our wedding night.

771
00:40:17,546 --> 00:40:19,072
You pretended
not to know her.

772
00:40:19,656 --> 00:40:21,471
Bree, I can explain.

773
00:40:21,717 --> 00:40:22,273
No.

774
00:40:23,697 --> 00:40:24,513
I'm done.

775
00:40:25,166 --> 00:40:27,233
You don't understand
what happened.

776
00:40:27,347 --> 00:40:29,412
There were two women
in your life before me.

777
00:40:29,626 --> 00:40:33,102
One vanished, and the other was killed.
That's all I need to understand.

778
00:40:36,188 --> 00:40:37,751
I've packed some
of your things.

779
00:40:39,506 --> 00:40:40,931
I want you out of the house.

780
00:40:43,468 --> 00:40:44,163
Now.

781
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:48,141
Bree...

782
00:40:49,698 --> 00:40:50,571
Please...

783
00:40:51,755 --> 00:40:52,663
I love you.

784
00:40:54,335 --> 00:40:55,131
I know...

785
00:40:56,177 --> 00:40:57,713
but it scares
the hell out of me.

786
00:41:10,115 --> 00:41:12,490
Dangerous men
walk among us,

787
00:41:13,057 --> 00:41:15,503
and we can't always
be sure of who they are

788
00:41:15,667 --> 00:41:18,121
or what secrets they hide.

789
00:41:19,537 --> 00:41:22,680
But once our worst
suspicions are confirmed,

790
00:41:24,325 --> 00:41:26,091
we can take action.

791
00:41:29,168 --> 00:41:31,473
Once their agendas
are revealed...

792
00:41:33,266 --> 00:41:35,173
We can take steps,

793
00:41:35,737 --> 00:41:37,451
to protect ourselves,

794
00:41:38,326 --> 00:41:40,160
and those we love.

795
00:41:50,386 --> 00:41:55,262
Yes, dangerous men
can cause great harm.

796
00:42:02,768 --> 00:42:06,271
But sometimes the greatest
danger they pose...

797
00:42:08,728 --> 00:42:09,702
I'll take those.

798
00:42:12,278 --> 00:42:13,922
Is to themselves.
