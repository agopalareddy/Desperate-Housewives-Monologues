1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,521
Previously on Desperate Housewives...

2
00:00:02,834 --> 00:00:05,062
Orson's wife Alma
disappeared...

3
00:00:05,976 --> 00:00:07,643
Gaby found
a new calling...

4
00:00:07,694 --> 00:00:09,538
Yes, I'm unbelievable.
Close your mouths.

5
00:00:09,696 --> 00:00:11,210
Someone new
moved in...

6
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:13,304
He's a bachelor who
lives with his invalid sister.

7
00:00:13,517 --> 00:00:15,342
But Lynette found
a dark secret...

8
00:00:15,343 --> 00:00:17,474
Our neighbor
is a pedophile.

9
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:18,757
You can't sit
on this, Lynette.

10
00:00:20,148 --> 00:00:22,160
Orson's mother
revealed his past...

11
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:24,326
He cheated on Alma,
broke her heart.

12
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:27,243
-For his precious Monique.
-Monique Polier?

13
00:00:27,282 --> 00:00:29,308
And the police couldn't
find the evidence...

14
00:00:29,309 --> 00:00:31,392
-We couldn't find a toolbox.
-The man's a plumber.

15
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:33,262
Until Mike
tried to hide it.

16
00:00:33,268 --> 00:00:34,333
I'll take those.

17
00:00:41,428 --> 00:00:45,871
The annual block party was a
winter tradition on Wisteria Lane.

18
00:00:49,128 --> 00:00:52,812
It was a way for the residents
to spread holiday cheer.

19
00:00:54,667 --> 00:00:56,241
Everyone was invited...

20
00:00:58,876 --> 00:01:00,862
Including Art Shepard,

21
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:03,763
The newest resident
of Wisteria Lane.

22
00:01:05,177 --> 00:01:07,433
But as the big
night drew near,

23
00:01:07,465 --> 00:01:11,031
more than holiday cheer
was being spread around.

24
00:01:11,147 --> 00:01:14,083
Hey, did you hear about the
new guy that just moved in?

25
00:01:14,796 --> 00:01:16,822
Well, get a load of this...

26
00:01:17,648 --> 00:01:20,980
Apparently, the perv's got all
this weird stuff In his basement.

27
00:01:21,265 --> 00:01:22,502
No, seriously.

28
00:01:22,777 --> 00:01:25,492
It's like this big kiddie
trap full of toys.

29
00:01:28,447 --> 00:01:29,943
By Sunday evening,

30
00:01:29,946 --> 00:01:32,143
most of the gossiping
had subsided,

31
00:01:32,248 --> 00:01:34,182
and the neighborhood
was once again

32
00:01:34,186 --> 00:01:36,753
consumed by the
spirit of the season.

33
00:01:37,925 --> 00:01:39,733
Friends laughed
over eggnog,

34
00:01:40,658 --> 00:01:42,722
lovers kissed
under mistletoe,

35
00:01:44,177 --> 00:01:45,852
and the mood
was jolly.

36
00:01:48,348 --> 00:01:51,030
That is, until
a certain guest

37
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:52,540
made his appearance.

38
00:02:05,528 --> 00:02:07,391
Look who's here!

39
00:02:09,768 --> 00:02:12,753
Merry Christmas,
everybody!

40
00:02:12,895 --> 00:02:14,431
Merry Christmas!

41
00:02:17,525 --> 00:02:20,660
Now, kids, who's been
good this year?

44
00:02:38,777 --> 00:02:39,963
Joey, get back here.

45
00:02:45,136 --> 00:02:46,403
What's going on?

46
00:02:48,237 --> 00:02:49,482
I'm not sure.

47
00:02:50,576 --> 00:02:51,773
Let's go, girls.

48
00:02:55,905 --> 00:02:57,583
Art, maybe we should go.

49
00:03:00,307 --> 00:03:03,091
Yes, for the residents
of Wisteria Lane,

50
00:03:03,117 --> 00:03:05,761
it was the most wonderful
time of the year.

51
00:03:12,015 --> 00:03:14,611
But for Arthur Shepard
and his sister,

52
00:03:14,925 --> 00:03:18,693
it had turned t to be
a very silent night.

54
00:03:24,457 --> 00:03:26,712
For the residents
of Wisteria Lane,

55
00:03:26,767 --> 00:03:29,181
the holiday season
could only begin,

56
00:03:30,515 --> 00:03:33,002
once the decorations
came out.

57
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:38,303
For some, that meant
pulling out the colored lights.

58
00:03:40,367 --> 00:03:43,901
For others, it meant
locating that holiday wreath.

59
00:03:46,007 --> 00:03:50,422
And then there were those eager
to display their nativity scene.

60
00:03:52,525 --> 00:03:54,463
But for a romantic few,

61
00:03:54,557 --> 00:03:56,950
it was all about
the mistletoe.

62
00:03:59,055 --> 00:04:00,773
You have to kiss me.
It's the law.

63
00:04:04,167 --> 00:04:06,941
While you're in a good mood,
I thought I'd spring something on you.

64
00:04:06,948 --> 00:04:09,891
-My parents are coming to town.
-Your parents? Really?

65
00:04:10,075 --> 00:04:12,841
And I wondered if you might be free
to join us for dinner Saturday.

66
00:04:13,955 --> 00:04:15,072
Absolutely.

67
00:04:15,738 --> 00:04:18,201
So I assume this means
they know about me?

68
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:19,342
But of course.

69
00:04:19,456 --> 00:04:20,863
And they know
about me as in...

70
00:04:20,967 --> 00:04:24,531
"Mum, Dad, bloody good news.
I've got melf a smashing new girlfriend."

71
00:04:24,918 --> 00:04:25,980
That's adorable.

72
00:04:26,155 --> 00:04:27,542
Please don't do it
in front of them.

73
00:04:27,877 --> 00:04:28,392
Right.

74
00:04:29,077 --> 00:04:30,193
So, um...

75
00:04:30,365 --> 00:04:32,873
Do you want me to make reservations
at that little french place?

76
00:04:33,145 --> 00:04:34,592
We could do that,

77
00:04:34,597 --> 00:04:37,540
but it's a 4-hour layover and
they're going to be exhausted,

78
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:39,443
and I thought we might have
a more enjoyable time

79
00:04:39,448 --> 00:04:41,692
if they came here and
you made dinner for them.

80
00:04:44,488 --> 00:04:47,731
Okay, I guess it's time
we have the conversation.

81
00:04:50,167 --> 00:04:51,063
Ian...

82
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:55,200
Haven't you ever wondered
why I've never cooked for you?

83
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,413
I just assumed
that you were lazy.

84
00:04:58,825 --> 00:04:59,751
I wish.

85
00:05:00,517 --> 00:05:01,522
My cooking...

86
00:05:02,417 --> 00:05:03,773
is not good.

87
00:05:03,946 --> 00:05:06,793
Well, my parents won't be
expecting a gourmet meal.

88
00:05:06,847 --> 00:05:08,773
Will they be expecting
stomach cramps,

89
00:05:08,945 --> 00:05:10,862
acid reflux,
night sweats?

90
00:05:10,928 --> 00:05:12,812
Come on,
you can't be that bad.

91
00:05:19,138 --> 00:05:22,433
It is really important that I make
them a home-cooked meal?

92
00:05:23,128 --> 00:05:26,612
Well, it's just that they're very
old-fashioned hearth-and-home types,

93
00:05:26,638 --> 00:05:29,161
and they might wonder why
you didn't make the effort.

94
00:05:30,786 --> 00:05:33,092
But it's okay.
You'll win them over...

95
00:05:33,898 --> 00:05:34,800
Eventually.

96
00:05:37,297 --> 00:05:40,093
Okay, I'll give it a shot. 

97
00:05:40,977 --> 00:05:42,032
Thank you.

98
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:46,160
Now nothing elaborate.
Just a simple roast and, uh,

99
00:05:46,177 --> 00:05:48,021
and something
appropriate to go with it.

100
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,042
Right...

101
00:05:50,105 --> 00:05:51,462
Like an ambulance.

102
00:05:59,036 --> 00:06:02,003
No, Amy, small
steps. Small!

103
00:06:02,268 --> 00:06:04,651
Little Miss Snowflake glides.
She doesn't stomp.

104
00:06:05,356 --> 00:06:06,420
Is  that better?

105
00:06:06,656 --> 00:06:07,873
Getting there, sweetie.

106
00:06:09,108 --> 00:06:10,843
If  she was a horse,
we'd have to shoot her.

107
00:06:12,685 --> 00:06:15,083
Poor thing,
she tries so hard.

108
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,440
Yeah, she's a trooper.
Let's dump her.

109
00:06:17,508 --> 00:06:18,513
What?! Why?

110
00:06:18,788 --> 00:06:21,602
Pageant consultants are judged
on the strength of their roster.

111
00:06:21,846 --> 00:06:24,390
You know, we can't afford to bounce
every nose-picking no-talent,

112
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:26,973
but we can definitely lose the one who's
dragging us down, and that's Amy.

113
00:06:26,976 --> 00:06:29,412
We can't do that!
Her mother died last year.

114
00:06:29,417 --> 00:06:32,930
Yes, I know, I know, and it's tragic,
but we are running a business.

115
00:06:33,148 --> 00:06:36,292
Amy is sucking up all of our time,
and we should be focusing on Sherri.

116
00:06:36,417 --> 00:06:37,933
She actually has
a shot at winning.

117
00:06:39,957 --> 00:06:41,213
How will I tell her family?

118
00:06:41,396 --> 00:06:43,481
We'll do it together.
We'll be very diplomatic.

119
00:06:43,565 --> 00:06:44,591
Are you sure about this?

120
00:06:44,597 --> 00:06:46,700
The poor kid's been
through the wringer and...

121
00:06:46,747 --> 00:06:47,431
Amy!

122
00:06:47,637 --> 00:06:48,633
For God sakes,

123
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:51,052
Little Miss Snowflake
does not scratch down there!

124
00:06:52,587 --> 00:06:54,360
Well, then again,
her mother died a year ago.

125
00:06:54,557 --> 00:06:55,552
How long is she
gonna milk it?

126
00:06:59,518 --> 00:07:01,260
Mother Hodge,
I have your breakfast.

127
00:07:01,277 --> 00:07:03,543
Just put it over there.
I'll pick through it later.

128
00:07:03,727 --> 00:07:04,823
Merry Christmas!

129
00:07:05,487 --> 00:07:07,143
Oh, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

130
00:07:07,717 --> 00:07:08,570
What are you watching?

131
00:07:08,947 --> 00:07:09,911
Home movies.

132
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:13,513
It's fun looking back
at the past, isn't it?

133
00:07:14,757 --> 00:07:18,122
Well, it's one way to kill time
while you're waiting for death.

134
00:07:19,817 --> 00:07:21,053
We also have cable.

135
00:07:22,677 --> 00:07:25,052
Have you decided what
you're gonna do about Orson?

136
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:26,812
-Decided?
-Yes.

137
00:07:27,168 --> 00:07:28,473
Have you called
a lawyer yet?

138
00:07:28,725 --> 00:07:30,720
I don't think that's
any of your concern.

139
00:07:30,758 --> 00:07:32,293
I don't mean
to pry, but,

140
00:07:33,158 --> 00:07:35,110
I think you're a good
Christian woman,

141
00:07:35,436 --> 00:07:37,541
and you deserve
better than my son.

142
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,123
Well, I will take that
under advisement.

143
00:07:40,265 --> 00:07:42,800
If you give him a chance,
he'll draw you back in.

144
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,436
It's what he does.

145
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,903
Just walk away.

146
00:07:47,382 --> 00:07:50,068
It's not that easy.
I love him.

147
00:07:51,859 --> 00:07:53,141
You'll get over it.

148
00:07:54,065 --> 00:07:55,133
I did.

149
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:07,830
Merry Christmas!

150
00:08:08,596 --> 00:08:10,293
Oh, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

151
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:11,421
Okay.

152
00:08:12,297 --> 00:08:14,813
Well, believe me,
Rita, he scares me, too.

153
00:08:16,056 --> 00:08:16,792
You know what?

154
00:08:16,935 --> 00:08:18,953
We should have a meeting,
get all the Moms together

155
00:08:19,026 --> 00:08:21,053
and figure out what
to do about this guy.

156
00:08:22,946 --> 00:08:25,172
Yeah, Saturday, your
house. Sounds good.

157
00:08:30,565 --> 00:08:31,990
Hey, Rita, I gotta go.

158
00:08:37,218 --> 00:08:39,220
Sorry, I can't talk now.
I have somewhere to go.

159
00:08:39,525 --> 00:08:43,373
Well, my brother doesn't.
The youth center just fired him.

160
00:08:43,948 --> 00:08:44,901
Are you happy?

161
00:08:46,406 --> 00:08:49,432
I'm not sad. He shouldn't be
around kids. I saw those pictures.

162
00:08:49,665 --> 00:08:52,290
Those boys were
on his swim team.

163
00:08:52,546 --> 00:08:53,851
He was proud of them.

164
00:08:54,448 --> 00:08:57,682
Turning that into something dirty
says more about you than him.

165
00:08:57,908 --> 00:08:59,333
You can defend
him all you want.

166
00:08:59,637 --> 00:09:00,572
I know what I know.

167
00:09:05,395 --> 00:09:07,592
Did you know my
brother got spit on

168
00:09:07,597 --> 00:09:09,472
at the hardware
store yesterday?

169
00:09:10,657 --> 00:09:13,211
That they refused to
serve us at the diner,

170
00:09:14,128 --> 00:09:17,582
that our tire got slashed
at the church parking lot?

171
00:09:21,226 --> 00:09:22,622
I am not a well woman.

172
00:09:23,197 --> 00:09:24,773
I don't need this stress.

173
00:09:27,077 --> 00:09:27,693
Well...

174
00:09:28,977 --> 00:09:30,360
I am sorry
that happened.

175
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,890
Have you considered even for a
Moment that you could be wrong,

176
00:09:34,967 --> 00:09:36,792
that you misinterpreted
what you saw,

177
00:09:36,987 --> 00:09:40,752
That you are ruining my
brother's life and mine

178
00:09:41,357 --> 00:09:42,453
over nothing?

179
00:09:44,437 --> 00:09:46,482
I have kids, okay?

180
00:09:47,308 --> 00:09:48,751
Better safe than sorry.

181
00:09:50,447 --> 00:09:52,672
So as long you're safe what
do you care who's sorry?

182
00:10:05,478 --> 00:10:08,830
So I'm cooking dinner for
Ian's parents tomorrow night,

183
00:10:08,898 --> 00:10:11,953
and it's the first time I'm meeting them,
so I sort of wanna impress them.

184
00:10:13,226 --> 00:10:14,431
And yet you're cooking?!

185
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:15,953
Well, that's the thing.

186
00:10:15,956 --> 00:10:19,523
Uh, so I was hoping, you know,
if you're not too busy...

187
00:10:19,815 --> 00:10:22,500
Oh, no, no, these things
practically build themselves.

188
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:25,081
Thank you.
You are a lifesaver.

189
00:10:25,396 --> 00:10:26,230
Actually...

190
00:10:27,158 --> 00:10:29,282
I could probably use
the distraction.

191
00:10:33,737 --> 00:10:35,840
I asked Orson to
move out last night.

192
00:10:39,027 --> 00:10:41,993
Oh, come on! Why would you
bury your toolbox in the woods?

193
00:10:42,006 --> 00:10:44,950
I knew the cops were
looking for it, and I panicked.

194
00:10:45,096 --> 00:10:46,681
I was just trying to 
buy myself me time.

195
00:10:46,718 --> 00:10:48,581
Well, you may have
bought yourself 20 to life!

196
00:10:48,686 --> 00:10:51,220
-Let the guy enjoy his breakfast.
-Stay out of this, Carlos.

197
00:10:51,998 --> 00:10:54,043
Mike,  I want you
to look at me.

198
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,551
Yeah, you look me in the
eye and you swear to me

199
00:10:56,618 --> 00:10:58,192
that you didn't
kill anybody.

200
00:10:58,276 --> 00:11:01,231
How many times do I have
to tell you? I can't remember.

201
00:11:01,258 --> 00:11:03,373
You can't remember,
or you don't wanna remember?

202
00:11:03,927 --> 00:11:04,961
Um, guys.

203
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:20,120
Bree,  you have got to go
to the police with all of this.

204
00:11:20,126 --> 00:11:23,070
I can't. Not yet. I need
some time to think.

205
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,883
His wife goes missing,
then his mistress turns up dead.

206
00:11:25,888 --> 00:11:27,293
What is there
to think about?

207
00:11:30,507 --> 00:11:33,553
I know it sounds suspicious,
but in my heart of hearts,

208
00:11:33,566 --> 00:11:35,920
I just can't believe that
Orson could do such a thing.

209
00:11:35,926 --> 00:11:37,553
Sweetie,
we all wanna believe

210
00:11:37,556 --> 00:11:39,220
the best of the people
we care about,

211
00:11:39,248 --> 00:11:42,963
But you cannot let your feelings for
a man blind you to cold hard facts.

212
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:47,723
What in the world?

213
00:11:51,828 --> 00:11:52,881
Oh, my God!

214
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:57,731
What's going on?

215
00:11:57,747 --> 00:11:59,810
They just arrested
Mike for murder.

216
00:12:00,407 --> 00:12:00,873
What?!

217
00:12:01,146 --> 00:12:03,270
They're saying he killed
that woman othe news,

218
00:12:03,298 --> 00:12:04,801
That Monique person.

219
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,050
Oh, thank God!

220
00:12:11,405 --> 00:12:13,283
I can't believe we're gonna
break that little girl's heart.

221
00:12:13,407 --> 00:12:14,681
Do not wimp out
on me here.

222
00:12:14,688 --> 00:12:16,012
We gotta do what's
best for the business.

223
00:12:16,017 --> 00:12:18,690
-What if the father yells at me?
-Then I will jump in and defend you.

224
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,800
Okay, but if you do,
try and be diplomatic.

225
00:12:20,976 --> 00:12:22,191
I'm always diplomatic.

226
00:12:22,226 --> 00:12:24,201
Now just get in there,
you spineless 'mo.

227
00:12:26,395 --> 00:12:27,770
Excuse me, Mr. Pearce?

228
00:12:30,047 --> 00:12:31,672
I'm so glad you
could come today.

229
00:12:31,738 --> 00:12:33,101
This is my partner Gabrielle.

230
00:12:35,877 --> 00:12:36,911
Pleasure to meet you.

231
00:12:38,687 --> 00:12:39,421
Shall we?

232
00:12:41,387 --> 00:12:44,593
So, uh, what did you
wanna talk to me about?

233
00:12:44,858 --> 00:12:45,801
Is there a problem
with Amy?

234
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:47,580
Not a problem, per se.

235
00:12:47,715 --> 00:12:50,453
We're just a little concerned
that she might not have the, um...

236
00:12:50,797 --> 00:12:53,543
temperament for
pageant competitions.

237
00:12:53,978 --> 00:12:54,752
And what does that mean?

238
00:12:54,876 --> 00:12:56,953
Well, when it comes
to performing,

239
00:12:57,228 --> 00:12:58,561
she's not exactly...

240
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,743
Well, she tends to be...
Feel free to jump in.

241
00:13:05,138 --> 00:13:07,082
I have no idea where
you're going with this.

242
00:13:11,228 --> 00:13:12,943
Well, as Gaby
and I discussed,

243
00:13:13,828 --> 00:13:16,862
Amy has certain limitations and
her odds of winning are slim.

244
00:13:16,888 --> 00:13:17,773
Vern!

245
00:13:18,668 --> 00:13:19,970
He is so competitive.

246
00:13:20,156 --> 00:13:22,561
I constantly have to remind
him they're just kids.

247
00:13:24,297 --> 00:13:26,732
-When did you lose the joy?
-Oh, I think you know.

248
00:13:26,767 --> 00:13:29,860
Wait, I'm confused.
Are you dumping Amy?

249
00:13:30,096 --> 00:13:31,793
Of course not, Bill.

250
00:13:32,368 --> 00:13:33,612
Can I call you Bill?

251
00:13:34,746 --> 00:13:38,382
It's just we feel that Amy would
benefit from some private coaching.

252
00:13:38,616 --> 00:13:41,592
Maybe I could come to your
house? Say, Friday, 5:00?

253
00:13:44,606 --> 00:13:46,803
Sure. Yeah, I guess.

254
00:13:46,865 --> 00:13:48,600
Great! It's a date.

255
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:50,930
Maybe I should come, too.

256
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:53,790
After the harsh things
you said about Amy?

257
00:13:53,877 --> 00:13:55,093
I don't think so.

258
00:13:58,726 --> 00:13:59,832
I'm gonna need
a good lawyer.

259
00:14:00,365 --> 00:14:02,042
And that may take
a little research.

260
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:04,931
And whoever takes my
case will need a retainer,

261
00:14:04,935 --> 00:14:07,442
so if you don't mind,
I promise I'll pay you back.

262
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:09,313
Oh, okay.

263
00:14:10,336 --> 00:14:11,822
And make sure he knows
about my wrench.

264
00:14:12,098 --> 00:14:15,533
Apparently, they tested it and
found traces of this Monique's blood.

265
00:14:18,878 --> 00:14:19,572
What's wrong?

266
00:14:21,565 --> 00:14:24,071
I don't know if you picked
up on this, Mike, but...

267
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:27,050
I haven't been happy.

268
00:14:28,886 --> 00:14:31,032
No, I didn't
pick up on it.

269
00:14:31,577 --> 00:14:32,913
Well, I wanted to tell
you this weeks ago,

270
00:14:32,928 --> 00:14:34,512
and I wish that I had,
because now

271
00:14:34,527 --> 00:14:36,170
I know you're gonna think
that I'm breaking up with you

272
00:14:36,188 --> 00:14:38,011
over  this whole blood
on the ax thing.

273
00:14:38,075 --> 00:14:38,771
Wrench.

274
00:14:39,447 --> 00:14:42,320
Whatever. But believe
me, that's not it.

275
00:14:44,585 --> 00:14:45,503
It's just...

276
00:14:47,457 --> 00:14:49,350
We are moving too fast.

277
00:14:51,155 --> 00:14:52,422
What are you
trying to say?

278
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:56,140
Well, maybe we should
just... take a break.

279
00:14:56,177 --> 00:14:58,802
You know...
date other people.

280
00:15:00,388 --> 00:15:03,411
You're telling me this on the
day I'm put in a men's prison?

281
00:15:04,585 --> 00:15:06,263
Well, I said the
timing was bad.

282
00:15:09,405 --> 00:15:10,773
I am sorry. I...

283
00:15:11,517 --> 00:15:12,852
I really am.

284
00:15:13,508 --> 00:15:16,020
I just can't do this.

285
00:15:31,577 --> 00:15:34,701
They told me somebody was coming,
but I did not expect it to be you.

286
00:15:35,665 --> 00:15:37,463
Is Edie getting you
a good lawyer?

287
00:15:38,997 --> 00:15:39,751
I doubt it.

288
00:15:40,245 --> 00:15:41,530
She dumped me today.

289
00:15:42,355 --> 00:15:43,520
What? Why?

290
00:15:43,995 --> 00:15:45,703
Well, I was
arrested for murder.

291
00:15:46,356 --> 00:15:47,342
Still...

292
00:15:49,155 --> 00:15:50,033
It's tacky.

293
00:15:52,227 --> 00:15:53,633
Well, okay then, uh...

294
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:56,511
I'll help get you out.

295
00:15:58,558 --> 00:15:59,531
What's your bail?

296
00:16:03,025 --> 00:16:04,180
A million dollars.

297
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:09,320
You don't have
to help me, Susan.

298
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:14,040
I want to.

299
00:16:17,497 --> 00:16:18,701
Aren't you gonna ask?

300
00:16:20,448 --> 00:16:21,082
What?

301
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:23,991
If I killed that woman?

302
00:16:26,787 --> 00:16:28,360
I don't have to.
I know you didn't.

303
00:16:32,138 --> 00:16:33,593
I wish I was that sure.

304
00:16:39,936 --> 00:16:41,211
I have these flashes,

305
00:16:41,605 --> 00:16:43,820
where I see her face,
so I must've known her.

306
00:16:44,608 --> 00:16:46,010
And if I did, maybe
something happened.

307
00:16:46,017 --> 00:16:47,541
maybe I got
angry, maybe...

308
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:51,402
There's an explanation for this,
and we're gonna figure it out.

309
00:16:53,088 --> 00:16:54,431
Don't worry about a thing.

310
00:17:04,645 --> 00:17:05,563
Miss Gabrielle!

311
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,440
When are you gonna
come outside and watch me?

312
00:17:07,686 --> 00:17:10,772
Oh, um, the grass, honey,
and my allergies...

313
00:17:11,008 --> 00:17:13,370
Go ahead and practice.
I'll watch you from here.

314
00:17:16,018 --> 00:17:17,932
Are you sure I can't
help with anything?

315
00:17:18,436 --> 00:17:20,021
I've been a single
Dad for a while now.

316
00:17:20,236 --> 00:17:21,923
I got the dinner
thing down.

317
00:17:22,686 --> 00:17:24,222
I've got the restaurant
thing down.

318
00:17:24,826 --> 00:17:26,720
I can't bring myself
to cook for one.

319
00:17:27,567 --> 00:17:29,291
Not that I ever
cooked for two.

320
00:17:29,887 --> 00:17:33,361
Well, no restaurant tonight. 
You are having dinner with us.

321
00:17:34,336 --> 00:17:35,271
That's sweet.

322
00:17:35,335 --> 00:17:37,473
It's the least I can do to
thank you for helping Amy.

323
00:17:37,635 --> 00:17:38,932
Oh. It's nothing.

324
00:17:46,157 --> 00:17:47,860
Yeah, she's
a special girl.

325
00:17:49,665 --> 00:17:50,581
So...

326
00:17:51,925 --> 00:17:54,141
How is it for you,
being single again?

327
00:17:55,257 --> 00:17:57,132
Oh, honestly?

328
00:17:59,206 --> 00:18:01,843
I  hate it. It's like I've
forgotten how to date.

329
00:18:02,265 --> 00:18:03,001
Me, too. You know,

330
00:18:03,017 --> 00:18:05,692
I even let a friend of mine talk me
into one of those speed dating things.

331
00:18:06,038 --> 00:18:07,131
How was it?

332
00:18:07,638 --> 00:18:08,470
I didn't even go in.

333
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,043
I just sat in this
hotel lobby.

334
00:18:10,336 --> 00:18:13,660
I watched all these lonely,
desperate single people filing in,

335
00:18:13,835 --> 00:18:15,961
and then it hit me,
I'm one of them.

336
00:18:17,356 --> 00:18:18,523
I know what
you mean.

337
00:18:22,288 --> 00:18:23,140
Did you see that?

338
00:18:23,207 --> 00:18:25,152
It spun three times
and then I caught it.

339
00:18:26,746 --> 00:18:27,741
You didn't see.

340
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:30,993
Yeah, I'm sorry, sweetie.
I was distracting Gabrielle.

341
00:18:30,996 --> 00:18:33,010
Oh, no, no,
it's totally my fault.

342
00:18:33,175 --> 00:18:35,431
I'm sorry, sweetie.
Go outside and do it again.

343
00:18:35,436 --> 00:18:37,303
I promise this time
we're gonna watch.

344
00:18:54,178 --> 00:18:54,943
Come in.

345
00:18:57,046 --> 00:18:57,733
Hey.

346
00:18:57,985 --> 00:19:00,321
Wow, oh,
those are gorgeous.

347
00:19:00,328 --> 00:19:03,680
Well, I figured you'd be too busy
cooking to manage a centerpiece.

348
00:19:05,518 --> 00:19:10,202
Well, you, uh, you may not be a good
cook but you're certainly a tidy one.

349
00:19:10,627 --> 00:19:13,341
Don't worry. Dinner's all
taken care of. We're having...

350
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,691
Blanquette de veau and
a grand marnier soufflé.

351
00:19:16,767 --> 00:19:18,431
Well, that's very
ambitious of you,

352
00:19:18,435 --> 00:19:21,060
and, uh, when will Bree
be done making it?

353
00:19:22,168 --> 00:19:22,842
5:30.

354
00:19:23,466 --> 00:19:25,583
But I am rewarming
it all by myself.

355
00:19:26,745 --> 00:19:29,190
Oh, what's, uh,
what's all this?

356
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,772
Mike was arrested
for murder.

357
00:19:32,247 --> 00:19:33,021
My God.

358
00:19:33,435 --> 00:19:35,461
I mean, of course
he's totally innocent.

359
00:19:35,656 --> 00:19:37,390
I'm just trying to help
him find a lawyer.

360
00:19:38,396 --> 00:19:40,482
Shouldn't, um, shouldn't
his girlfriend be doing that?

361
00:19:41,245 --> 00:19:43,173
Yeah. Edie dumped him.

362
00:19:47,377 --> 00:19:49,560
Okay, I know how
this looks but

363
00:19:50,135 --> 00:19:51,611
I just feel bad.

364
00:19:52,415 --> 00:19:53,842
He's just a friend now.

365
00:19:54,948 --> 00:19:57,913
Yes. Yes, a friend
you sat by for six months,

366
00:19:57,917 --> 00:20:00,112
hoping he'd wake up
and ravish you again.

367
00:20:00,627 --> 00:20:04,141
You are the only one allowed
to ravish me these days,

368
00:20:04,707 --> 00:20:06,070
So stop worrying.

369
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:14,723
Orson, it's me again.
Please call.

370
00:20:15,266 --> 00:20:16,323
We need to talk.

371
00:20:19,787 --> 00:20:21,000
I'll do the chips.
You deal.

372
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:21,830
You got it.

373
00:20:24,738 --> 00:20:27,452
Guys, why has it been so long
since we've played poker?

374
00:20:27,507 --> 00:20:29,270
-I really need this.
-Oh, me, too.

375
00:20:29,276 --> 00:20:33,452
There's nothing more relaxing than an
afternoon of finger food and girl talk.

376
00:20:34,205 --> 00:20:36,550
-Hi, ladies!
-Hey! How you doing?

377
00:20:37,686 --> 00:20:40,331
So did you tell the police that
you think Orson killed Monique?

378
00:20:40,617 --> 00:20:41,432
What?!

379
00:20:42,347 --> 00:20:44,893
No, I did not,
and I don't plan to.

380
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:46,122
But Mike is in jail,

381
00:20:46,137 --> 00:20:48,310
and you said yourself
you thought Orson did it.

382
00:20:48,505 --> 00:20:49,662
I said I had concerns,

383
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:53,223
Concerns that have disappeared
now that Mike has been arrested.

384
00:20:53,435 --> 00:20:55,491
What are you saying?
You think Mike is guilty?

385
00:20:55,656 --> 00:20:57,271
Hey, why don't we
start that girl talk?

386
00:20:57,398 --> 00:21:00,220
I'll get the ball rolling.
Anybody have a yeast infection?

387
00:21:01,488 --> 00:21:05,081
They found Monique's blood on the wrench
that Mike was trying to dispose of.

388
00:21:05,345 --> 00:21:07,333
I mean, that hardly
screams innocence.

389
00:21:07,437 --> 00:21:09,190
Her teeth were pulled.

390
00:21:09,326 --> 00:21:13,162
You don't think that's worth telling the cops
she was messing around with a dentist?

391
00:21:13,296 --> 00:21:14,992
Orson was slipping it
to the dead chick?

392
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:18,012
Mike is innocent.
I know that in my heart.

393
00:21:18,148 --> 00:21:19,570
We all have
convictions, Susan.

394
00:21:19,608 --> 00:21:22,021
I believe Mike's last one
was for manslaughter.

395
00:21:22,186 --> 00:21:24,843
Okay, okay, we've all made
some excellent points

396
00:21:24,846 --> 00:21:26,732
and blown off
a little steam.

397
00:21:26,758 --> 00:21:28,700
Whoo! Let's play
some cards.

398
00:21:30,386 --> 00:21:32,203
If you're so sure that
Orson is innocent,

399
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,523
why don't we go through his
things? Where's his desk?

400
00:21:34,628 --> 00:21:35,880
At his office.

401
00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:37,821
And what did you think
you'd find there anyway?

402
00:21:37,847 --> 00:21:38,683
I don't know.

403
00:21:38,685 --> 00:21:41,411
A blackmail letter,
a necklace made of teeth?

404
00:21:41,525 --> 00:21:42,960
We're not gonna
play cards, are we?

405
00:21:43,687 --> 00:21:44,170
Nope.

406
00:21:44,275 --> 00:21:45,933
Well, I am certainly not
playing with a woman

407
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:48,611
that is willing to let Mike take
the fall for her psycho husband.

408
00:21:48,636 --> 00:21:51,562
Well, needless to say, I won't be
cooking dinner for Ian's parents.

409
00:21:51,626 --> 00:21:53,693
Fine. I'll cook myself.

410
00:21:53,898 --> 00:21:54,582
Good.

411
00:21:54,858 --> 00:21:56,431
Let me know if there
are any survivors.

412
00:21:56,667 --> 00:21:58,981
And if you take Orson back,
you do the same.

413
00:22:06,437 --> 00:22:07,873
Well, that was
incredibly awkward.

414
00:22:07,876 --> 00:22:09,852
I'm sorry you both
had to sit through it.

415
00:22:11,198 --> 00:22:13,063
Was it me?
Was I out of line?

416
00:22:14,027 --> 00:22:15,392
Oh, I'm not
taking sides.

417
00:22:15,545 --> 00:22:16,832
This will blow over.

418
00:22:17,168 --> 00:22:17,931
You're right...

419
00:22:31,738 --> 00:22:33,103
Hey, come on in.
You're just in time.

420
00:22:33,137 --> 00:22:34,282
Thanks so much, Rita.

421
00:22:34,287 --> 00:22:37,732
I think it's such a good idea that
we all get together and talk and...

422
00:22:39,138 --> 00:22:40,071
Wow.

423
00:22:40,738 --> 00:22:42,980
Wow. What is all this?

424
00:22:43,177 --> 00:22:45,823
We decided to stage a
protest in front of Art's house.

425
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:48,001
A protest?
Mm-Hmm.

426
00:22:48,348 --> 00:22:51,661
Rita, I want the word
"pedophile" to really stand out.

427
00:22:51,877 --> 00:22:52,950
Do we have any glitter?

428
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:55,602
Say "molester."
It sounds scarier.

429
00:22:56,456 --> 00:23:02,463
I'm sorry. I thought we were all gonna talk
about how to keep an eye on this guy.

430
00:23:02,525 --> 00:23:04,433
We're past talking.
The guy's a menace.

431
00:23:04,506 --> 00:23:07,851
Well, that's what we think,
but we don't exactly have proof.

432
00:23:07,885 --> 00:23:11,100
The youth center just fired him.
How much proof to you need?

433
00:23:11,566 --> 00:23:15,430
But, see, the only reason they fired him
is because people were gossiping,

434
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:19,563
and the only reason they're gossipg is
because of what I told Mrs. McCluskey.

435
00:23:19,785 --> 00:23:22,213
Yeah, and you told me
to spread the word.

436
00:23:22,428 --> 00:23:25,601
So that people could watch
their kids and be vigilant.

437
00:23:25,757 --> 00:23:28,591
So you wanna wait until he
actually molests one of our kids?

438
00:23:28,687 --> 00:23:31,060
-Whose side are you on, Lynette?
-Knock it off, gert.

439
00:23:31,288 --> 00:23:33,432
Remember,
if it weren't for Lynette,

440
00:23:33,698 --> 00:23:35,961
We never would've found
out about this creep.

441
00:23:37,097 --> 00:23:38,091
She's our hero.

442
00:24:33,476 --> 00:24:35,933
...The 22-Yard line,
the give is to Harrison,

443
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:38,081
who is hit immediately
and dropped for a loss

444
00:24:38,087 --> 00:24:39,923
in his own backfield...

445
00:24:43,446 --> 00:24:44,222
Bye-bye, Daddy.

446
00:24:44,415 --> 00:24:45,571
See you, sweetie.
Have fun.

447
00:24:46,477 --> 00:24:48,561
So I was, uh,
I was thinking you...

448
00:24:48,635 --> 00:24:51,232
You wanna grab a cup of coffee
or something after class?

449
00:24:51,808 --> 00:24:53,591
I'd love to grab
a cup of coffee...

450
00:24:54,328 --> 00:24:55,202
or something.

451
00:25:00,396 --> 00:25:04,012
Amy, you are so lucky
to have such a nice Dad.

452
00:25:04,907 --> 00:25:05,802
Yeah, I know.

453
00:25:07,907 --> 00:25:08,800
Leave him alone.

454
00:25:09,958 --> 00:25:10,602
Excuse me?

455
00:25:10,827 --> 00:25:11,620
You heard me.

456
00:25:12,358 --> 00:25:13,682
I don't want
you dating him.

457
00:25:16,736 --> 00:25:18,411
Oh, sweetheart.

458
00:25:19,796 --> 00:25:22,000
I have a feeling
I know what this is about.

459
00:25:22,296 --> 00:25:23,020
No you don't.

460
00:25:23,108 --> 00:25:25,773
I think I do.
You miss your Mommy,

461
00:25:26,106 --> 00:25:29,730
and it feels funny seeing your
Daddy be nice to somebody else.

462
00:25:29,867 --> 00:25:33,041
But believe me, I'm not trying
to replace your Mom.

463
00:25:34,686 --> 00:25:35,613
Well, I am,

464
00:25:36,838 --> 00:25:38,141
And I have someone
all picked out.

465
00:25:39,707 --> 00:25:40,290
What?

466
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:43,423
I want my Dad to
marry Sherri's Mom.

467
00:25:45,438 --> 00:25:46,513
Sherri from class?

468
00:25:46,757 --> 00:25:48,582
We're best friends, and
we have it all planned out.

469
00:25:48,956 --> 00:25:50,202
Our parents are
gonna get married,

470
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:52,010
and then we'll
be real sisters.

471
00:25:52,697 --> 00:25:54,672
What about your Dad?
Don't you care what he wants?

472
00:25:54,918 --> 00:25:55,882
My Mom died.

473
00:25:56,636 --> 00:25:58,623
All my Dad wants
is for me to be happy.

474
00:26:00,657 --> 00:26:03,763
Now get in there and teach
me how to work the runway.

475
00:26:04,325 --> 00:26:05,832
That's what we're
paying you for, right?

476
00:26:12,345 --> 00:26:13,730
...Runs it left,
swings it around.

477
00:26:13,887 --> 00:26:16,301
He fights his way to the
25 for another first down,

478
00:26:16,307 --> 00:26:17,983
and that should
just about do it.

479
00:26:17,986 --> 00:26:21,663
I tell you, with 1:12 left on the clock
and no time-outs remaining...

480
00:26:47,708 --> 00:26:48,592
Orson?

481
00:26:51,495 --> 00:26:52,080
Bree?

482
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:53,693
Orson.

483
00:26:54,866 --> 00:26:56,930
Why haven't you
returned any of my calls?

484
00:26:58,005 --> 00:27:00,503
I was afraid you were calling
to ask me for a divorce.

485
00:27:02,076 --> 00:27:03,442
No, I wasn't.

486
00:27:04,987 --> 00:27:07,700
They arrested Mike for the
murder of Monique Polier.

487
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:08,712
They did?

488
00:27:09,577 --> 00:27:11,732
The other night, you wanted
a chance to explain everything.

489
00:27:11,748 --> 00:27:14,413
Well, here it is,
and I want it all.

490
00:27:15,097 --> 00:27:18,390
If I find out you've left anything out,
then I will ask for that divorce.

491
00:27:20,197 --> 00:27:20,991
Okay.

492
00:27:41,108 --> 00:27:44,960
You're working so hard, Sherri.
You must really wanna win this pageant.

493
00:27:45,598 --> 00:27:46,760
More than anything.

494
00:27:48,278 --> 00:27:50,401
Well, I think dedication
should be rewarded,

495
00:27:50,757 --> 00:27:52,523
so I have a little
surprise for you.

496
00:27:52,667 --> 00:27:53,361
What is it?

497
00:27:53,567 --> 00:27:56,500
Well, you know how the pageant
starts with a big opening number?

498
00:27:56,647 --> 00:27:59,300
This year, all the contestants
are gonna dance in pairs,

499
00:27:59,435 --> 00:28:03,322
and I've arranged for you to
dance with your best friend Amy!

500
00:28:07,305 --> 00:28:08,511
What's wrong, sweetie?

501
00:28:09,318 --> 00:28:10,350
Well...

502
00:28:11,557 --> 00:28:12,632
Amy sucks.

503
00:28:15,808 --> 00:28:19,500
Well, I thought you two
were practically sisters?

504
00:28:19,745 --> 00:28:22,542
We are...
but she still sucks.

505
00:28:22,958 --> 00:28:24,440
And first impressions
are everything.

506
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:25,722
You said so yourself.

507
00:28:26,498 --> 00:28:29,042
-Well, that's true...
-And this is the opening number.

508
00:28:29,486 --> 00:28:32,920
If the judges see me tripping all over
that klutz, there's no way I'm gonna win.

509
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:35,160
That's a good point.

510
00:28:35,316 --> 00:28:37,072
Now I wish I hadn't told Amy.

511
00:28:37,426 --> 00:28:39,353
You already told her?!

512
00:28:39,836 --> 00:28:42,101
She was so excited.

513
00:28:44,748 --> 00:28:46,323
Well, she's
your best friend.

514
00:28:46,406 --> 00:28:48,771
Why don't you just tell her
the truth? She'll understand.

515
00:28:49,967 --> 00:28:51,430
What if she doesn't?

516
00:28:52,575 --> 00:28:55,213
Well, friends come and go...

517
00:28:56,147 --> 00:28:58,193
but a crown is forever.

518
00:29:03,045 --> 00:29:04,210
I never loved Alma.

519
00:29:05,675 --> 00:29:07,152
My mother pushed
us together, and,

520
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:10,163
I was stupid enough
to get her pregnant.

521
00:29:11,105 --> 00:29:12,391
You had a child?

522
00:29:13,715 --> 00:29:15,781
Alma miscarried a month
after the wedding.

523
00:29:17,325 --> 00:29:18,303
I was trapped.

524
00:29:18,925 --> 00:29:20,131
Well, you could've left her.

525
00:29:20,638 --> 00:29:21,980
Mother wouldn't hear of it.

526
00:29:22,338 --> 00:29:24,383
Divorce is a sin.

527
00:29:26,977 --> 00:29:28,802
So I stayed in
the marriage,

528
00:29:29,498 --> 00:29:32,680
hoping I would come to feel
what I was supposed to,

529
00:29:33,945 --> 00:29:34,782
but I never did.

530
00:29:35,467 --> 00:29:38,173
So I resigned myself
to a life without love.

531
00:29:39,756 --> 00:29:40,982
And then I met Monique.

532
00:29:43,998 --> 00:29:46,503
It was wrong.
I didn't care.

533
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,840
I loved her more than
I'd loved anyone...

534
00:29:51,115 --> 00:29:51,893
Till you.

535
00:29:52,978 --> 00:29:54,860
So why couldn't
you tell me this?

536
00:29:56,038 --> 00:29:57,501
Because you told
me about Rex.

537
00:29:57,688 --> 00:29:59,801
How he cheated on you,
how hurt you were.

538
00:29:59,855 --> 00:30:02,920
Bree, I needed you
to feel safe with me.

539
00:30:03,138 --> 00:30:05,522
Well, you haven't
done a very good job.

540
00:30:06,046 --> 00:30:08,750
Handling the truth would have
been a hundred times easier

541
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:11,840
than dealing with all
the doubt and suspicion.

542
00:30:18,266 --> 00:30:21,113
So you stayed in a loveless
marriage because of your mother?

543
00:30:21,515 --> 00:30:22,940
I know how it sounds.

544
00:30:24,286 --> 00:30:25,803
But after my
father died,

545
00:30:26,577 --> 00:30:27,592
she was all I had.

546
00:30:28,485 --> 00:30:30,670
His death caused
me so much pain...

547
00:30:37,186 --> 00:30:38,541
I would've done
anything for her.

548
00:30:46,426 --> 00:30:48,802
She saw that weakness,

549
00:30:49,518 --> 00:30:50,771
and she ran with it.

550
00:30:56,408 --> 00:30:59,173
You've got no idea how
manipulative she can be.

551
00:31:00,507 --> 00:31:02,543
She ruins lives.

552
00:31:05,628 --> 00:31:07,061
Now I've told you
everything.

553
00:31:08,848 --> 00:31:09,893
What happens now?

554
00:31:11,468 --> 00:31:12,343
Well...

555
00:31:13,508 --> 00:31:15,891
First you pack up your
things and come home,

556
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:18,752
and then...

557
00:31:19,407 --> 00:31:22,182
we toss your mother
out on her evil ass.

558
00:31:23,357 --> 00:31:24,662
God, I love you.

559
00:31:43,408 --> 00:31:45,391
Hi! I'm so
sorry I'm late.

560
00:31:46,277 --> 00:31:47,863
-Where are your folks?
-They're not coming.

561
00:31:47,985 --> 00:31:49,833
Their plane was
snowed in at O'Hare.

562
00:31:51,067 --> 00:31:54,731
Well, that's too bad.
Well, no harm done then, huh?

563
00:31:55,468 --> 00:31:56,862
You're 40 minutes late.

564
00:31:57,418 --> 00:31:58,513
But they're not here.

565
00:31:58,595 --> 00:32:00,180
You didn't know that.
And where's dinner?

566
00:32:01,886 --> 00:32:03,583
Bree and I sort
of had a fight.

567
00:32:05,707 --> 00:32:09,301
Look, I'm awfully sorry that
I'm late. I had an emergency.

568
00:32:09,956 --> 00:32:12,492
Did this emergency have
anything to do with Mike?

569
00:32:18,997 --> 00:32:23,271
I'm pretty sure that Bree's husband murdered
the woman the cops think Mike killed.

570
00:32:24,478 --> 00:32:25,761
I went to his office...

571
00:32:25,838 --> 00:32:27,460
Oh, for God sakes, Susan.

572
00:32:27,505 --> 00:32:29,450
No, I found
evidence. Look.

573
00:32:30,606 --> 00:32:34,521
Orson was committed to a
mental institution for over a year.

574
00:32:34,675 --> 00:32:36,120
I mean, doesn't that suggest

575
00:32:36,135 --> 00:32:37,820
- he's some sort of...
- I don't care!

576
00:32:39,695 --> 00:32:41,831
Tonight meant a great deal
to me, and you blew it off.

577
00:32:43,496 --> 00:32:44,861
I said I was sorry, Ian.

578
00:32:51,058 --> 00:32:53,051
I have to help Mike.
I'm all he's got.

579
00:32:54,996 --> 00:32:56,303
Actually, you're wrong.

580
00:32:56,618 --> 00:32:57,600
He's got me.

581
00:32:58,878 --> 00:32:59,471
What?

582
00:32:59,796 --> 00:33:02,370
Tomorrow, I'll hire the best
lawyer in town to defend him,

583
00:33:02,378 --> 00:33:04,580
and I'll pay every
cent of his bill.

584
00:33:06,237 --> 00:33:07,511
You would do that for Mike?

585
00:33:08,015 --> 00:33:10,633
Yes, on one condition...

586
00:33:15,085 --> 00:33:16,712
You can't see
him anymore.

587
00:33:18,516 --> 00:33:19,111
Why?

588
00:33:19,325 --> 00:33:21,470
If you start visiting him,
being a friend to him,

589
00:33:21,475 --> 00:33:22,911
he'll fall in love
with you again.

590
00:33:22,916 --> 00:33:26,280
Then you'll have to decide whose
heart to break, his or mine.

591
00:33:28,868 --> 00:33:32,123
As jealous ultimatums go,
that's very flattering, but,

592
00:33:32,678 --> 00:33:34,012
I don't think
that's necessary.

593
00:33:34,017 --> 00:33:35,833
Mike and I are done.

594
00:33:36,307 --> 00:33:39,353
Then you should have no problem
accepting my generous offer.

595
00:33:40,826 --> 00:33:42,902
You would really get him
the best lawyer in town?

596
00:33:43,098 --> 00:33:44,653
An absolute piranha.

597
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:47,463
Do we have a deal?

598
00:33:51,335 --> 00:33:52,431
Well, okay then.

599
00:34:01,486 --> 00:34:03,180
You know, Mike barely
remembers me.

600
00:34:05,007 --> 00:34:07,640
What makes you so sure he would
fall in love with me again?

601
00:34:10,195 --> 00:34:12,421
What a perfectly
asinine question.

602
00:34:13,605 --> 00:34:14,673
How could he not?

603
00:34:28,185 --> 00:34:31,053
God, I was only
in the house 15 minutes.

604
00:34:31,475 --> 00:34:32,622
Are there more
of them now?

605
00:34:32,806 --> 00:34:33,693
Yep.

606
00:34:37,167 --> 00:34:39,032
Go ahead, say it.
I know you want to.

607
00:34:39,228 --> 00:34:41,343
This is all your fault.
You should've listened to me.

608
00:34:42,267 --> 00:34:43,342
I know.

609
00:34:44,557 --> 00:34:47,922
But be fair. There is no way
I could've anticipated this.

610
00:34:48,745 --> 00:34:50,743
You tell people
Frankenstein's on the loose,

611
00:34:50,746 --> 00:34:53,601
then you're surprised to see
the torch-wielding villagers?

612
00:34:56,407 --> 00:34:58,700
I'm putting the kids to bed early.
I don't want 'em to see this.

613
00:35:01,465 --> 00:35:03,072
Is that an ambulance?

614
00:35:06,546 --> 00:35:08,181
I can't believe
you're doing this!

615
00:35:08,235 --> 00:35:10,553
Amy, don't you want
me to have a chance?

616
00:35:10,688 --> 00:35:13,170
God, I hate you!
I hate you!

617
00:35:15,657 --> 00:35:17,071
Don't ever talk
to me again!

618
00:35:20,735 --> 00:35:22,173
Hi. Bill?

619
00:35:22,768 --> 00:35:25,251
I was wondering, do you
have plans Saturday night?

620
00:35:32,665 --> 00:35:35,070
What... Excuse me, can you
tell me what happened?

621
00:35:35,077 --> 00:35:36,631
Ma'am, I need
you to step back.

622
00:35:36,685 --> 00:35:37,230
Okay.

623
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:39,260
We're brinng in
a female, late 30s.

624
00:35:39,438 --> 00:35:41,640
And get crash cart ready.
She's in cardiac arrest.

625
00:35:52,105 --> 00:35:53,560
-There he is.
-There he is.

626
00:36:03,505 --> 00:36:09,062
Stop it! Stop it! You can't do this to
people! Have you lost your minds?!

627
00:36:09,215 --> 00:36:11,572
Well, excuse us for wanting
to feel safe in our own homes.

628
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:14,011
Well, that's my home, and
I don't feel very safe right now.

629
00:36:14,018 --> 00:36:17,583
Please, please, all of you,
just leave this street.

630
00:36:17,695 --> 00:36:19,690
Please, I beg of you. Go!

631
00:36:21,018 --> 00:36:22,572
Just get off my
street, please!

632
00:36:22,626 --> 00:36:24,882
Wait, wait!
Art, wait, I'm sorry...

633
00:36:29,927 --> 00:36:30,820
I'm sorry.

634
00:36:48,657 --> 00:36:50,412
You're an idiot
to take him back.

635
00:36:51,537 --> 00:36:53,650
I am no longer interested
in your opinion.

636
00:36:53,716 --> 00:36:55,110
I thought
I made that clear.

637
00:36:55,665 --> 00:36:56,761
Where are you
sending me?

638
00:36:56,826 --> 00:37:00,321
Oh, we've rented you a condo
in a lovely retirement community.

639
00:37:00,568 --> 00:37:02,111
It's our Christmas
gift to you.

640
00:37:02,367 --> 00:37:03,802
So you're exiling me?

641
00:37:04,337 --> 00:37:06,743
Cutting me off from
my new grandcldren?

642
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:08,300
That's our gift
to them.

643
00:37:14,975 --> 00:37:17,333
You think you can be
rid of me that easily?

644
00:37:17,405 --> 00:37:19,670
It's over, mother.
I told her everything.

645
00:37:20,107 --> 00:37:23,200
Oh, I doubt
that very much.

646
00:37:23,545 --> 00:37:25,562
You still have
secrets, my boy.

647
00:37:25,636 --> 00:37:26,902
So do you, mother,

648
00:37:27,516 --> 00:37:30,992
And if you want them
kept, you'll keep mine.

649
00:37:43,516 --> 00:37:46,931
It's me. I have some bad news.
She's taking him back.

650
00:37:48,107 --> 00:37:49,861
Meet me on the
corner in an hour.

651
00:37:50,247 --> 00:37:52,040
We need to
deal with this.

652
00:38:02,546 --> 00:38:05,123
I heard about
Rebecca on the news.

653
00:38:06,557 --> 00:38:10,232
If there's anything
I can do to help, I...

654
00:38:10,417 --> 00:38:13,673
With the funeral
arrangements, or, uh...

655
00:38:14,095 --> 00:38:16,093
help you call relatives...

656
00:38:17,355 --> 00:38:18,290
Wow.

657
00:38:20,456 --> 00:38:22,400
You must be feeling
really guilty.

658
00:38:24,475 --> 00:38:26,081
Of course!

659
00:38:26,477 --> 00:38:30,012
I feel just terrible.

660
00:38:30,078 --> 00:38:34,592
I mean, if you knew, if you
could just know how sorry I am.

661
00:38:45,285 --> 00:38:45,860
Hey.

662
00:38:48,318 --> 00:38:50,090
You know,
in a weird way...

663
00:38:52,147 --> 00:38:53,301
I should thank you.

664
00:38:56,897 --> 00:38:58,201
My sister was...

665
00:38:59,708 --> 00:39:01,743
a really wonderful person.

666
00:39:04,205 --> 00:39:06,381
She always saw
the best in me.

667
00:39:09,007 --> 00:39:11,170
But there were things
she couldn't see...

668
00:39:13,255 --> 00:39:14,393
Or chose not to,

669
00:39:15,047 --> 00:39:15,981
God love her.

670
00:39:21,536 --> 00:39:23,322
-What do you mean?
-I think you know.

671
00:39:25,536 --> 00:39:28,802
See, I always knew that I
had to take care of Rebecca,

672
00:39:28,836 --> 00:39:31,143
so I could never
let myself...

673
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:34,942
slip and do something
that would hurt her.

674
00:39:36,406 --> 00:39:37,432
But now...

675
00:39:40,977 --> 00:39:41,890
I'm free...

676
00:39:44,806 --> 00:39:46,411
And all because of you.

677
00:39:55,675 --> 00:39:57,160
You can't stay here.

678
00:39:57,205 --> 00:39:59,501
Oh, don't worry.
I'm already packed.

679
00:40:01,356 --> 00:40:02,440
Where are you going?

680
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:04,341
Why, you gonna write?

681
00:40:09,427 --> 00:40:10,211
Well...

682
00:40:13,116 --> 00:40:14,061
Good-bye, Lynette.

683
00:40:17,705 --> 00:40:20,952
You take care of that
beautiful family of yours.

684
00:40:54,608 --> 00:40:58,150
There's a reason people
can't wait for Christmas,

685
00:41:00,885 --> 00:41:04,320
and it has little to do
with family reunions...

686
00:41:07,806 --> 00:41:10,991
Or curling up with
a cup of eggnog...

687
00:41:16,865 --> 00:41:21,200
Or that unexpected kiss
beneath the mistletoe...

688
00:41:25,307 --> 00:41:29,551
Or receiving a present
from that special someone.

689

No, people look
forward to Christmas,

690
00:41:42,476 --> 00:41:46,152
because they
know it's a time...

691
00:41:48,588 --> 00:41:50,130
for miracles.

692
00:41:51,066 --> 00:41:52,112
Hello, Alma.

693
00:41:52,938 --> 00:41:54,202
Don't just stand there.

694
00:41:54,556 --> 00:41:55,813
Tell me everything.
