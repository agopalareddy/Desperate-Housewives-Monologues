1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:02,309
Previously on Desperate Housewives...

2
00:00:02,457 --> 00:00:05,105
The Scavos prepared
for a grand opening...

3
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:08,457
This could be the best thing
that's ever happened to our family.

4
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:11,199
While Gabrielle had
a few too many drinks...

5
00:00:11,473 --> 00:00:12,964
I'm gonna take
a little nap, okay?

6
00:00:14,487 --> 00:00:18,048
And a cry for help made
Orson lose his cool.

7
00:00:18,098 --> 00:00:20,339
Suicide is the worst thing
that could happen to a family!

8
00:00:20,396 --> 00:00:21,764
Mike got arrested...

9
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:22,950
Oh, thank God.

10
00:00:22,986 --> 00:00:24,880
And a friendship
hit the rocks.

11
00:00:25,143 --> 00:00:27,279
-For the sake of our friendship...
-Make no mistake,

12
00:00:27,276 --> 00:00:28,610
our friendship is over.

13
00:00:28,652 --> 00:00:30,677
Orson's Mom
was determined...

14
00:00:30,849 --> 00:00:33,961
In the eyes of God,
you're the other woman.

15
00:00:34,676 --> 00:00:37,950
To bring Alma and
Orson back together.

16
00:00:38,196 --> 00:00:40,213
She raped you, and
your mother helped.

17
00:00:40,505 --> 00:00:43,463
I think it's time I told you about
the night about Monique died.

18
00:00:43,856 --> 00:00:46,152
Alma became a prisoner...

19
00:00:46,207 --> 00:00:47,181
Gloria?!

20
00:00:48,077 --> 00:00:48,771
Bree...

21
00:00:49,815 --> 00:00:51,712
was set up
to take a fall.

22
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:56,542
And Mike was finally able
to remember the past.

23
00:01:03,437 --> 00:01:05,581
Orson Hodge had
always assumed

24
00:01:05,628 --> 00:01:07,372
that the moment
before he died,

25
00:01:07,586 --> 00:01:10,832
his entire life would
flash before his eyes.

26
00:01:11,348 --> 00:01:14,792
But as he fell from the roof of
the Fairview Memorial Hospital,

27
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,662
it wasn't his
life he saw.

28
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:20,882
It was one night
in particular.

29
00:01:21,258 --> 00:01:21,882
Monique?

30
00:01:23,567 --> 00:01:25,141
I've got wonderful news.

31
00:01:26,097 --> 00:01:27,200
Bonnes nouvelles!

32
00:01:27,708 --> 00:01:28,551
Monique?

33
00:01:33,298 --> 00:01:34,491
There's been
an accident.

34
00:01:38,967 --> 00:01:40,252
Oh, my God.

35
00:01:43,377 --> 00:01:44,461
What have you done?

36
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:45,461
It was self-defense.

37
00:01:45,927 --> 00:01:48,360
I came to tell her to stay away
from you. She attacked me.

38
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:50,220
Mother...

39
00:01:51,565 --> 00:01:52,353
she's dead.

40
00:01:52,627 --> 00:01:53,273
I know.

41
00:01:54,526 --> 00:01:57,313
And I'm sorry,
but what's done is done.

44
00:02:01,096 --> 00:02:02,871
No! I'll go to jail.

45
00:02:03,066 --> 00:02:03,982
You killed someone!

46
00:02:03,987 --> 00:02:06,112
I'm your mother!
You've got to help me!

47
00:02:06,186 --> 00:02:07,772
But I loved her.

48
00:02:07,788 --> 00:02:11,482
I once lost someone
I loved, thanks to you.

49
00:02:15,145 --> 00:02:16,110
You owe me.

50
00:02:26,297 --> 00:02:26,802
Hello?

51
00:02:30,576 --> 00:02:31,403
Ms. Polier?

52
00:02:34,508 --> 00:02:35,722
I've got that part
for the sink.

53
00:02:38,095 --> 00:02:38,690
Hello?

54
00:02:43,098 --> 00:02:43,831
Ms. Polier?

55
00:02:45,337 --> 00:02:46,323
Ah, I'm sorry.

56
00:02:47,405 --> 00:02:50,582
I'm Monique's boyfriend.
She's upstairs lying down.

57
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,353
She wasn't feeling well.

58
00:02:53,936 --> 00:02:56,581
Well, I'll just finish up with the
sink and get out of your hair.

59
00:02:56,877 --> 00:02:58,551
Look, why don't you
let me take care of that?

60
00:02:58,566 --> 00:03:00,703
I mean, I'm pretty handy,
and it's getting late.

61
00:03:02,317 --> 00:03:03,421
I don't mind staying.

62
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,712
I've got it under control.

63
00:03:06,055 --> 00:03:06,820
Here, let me, uh,

64
00:03:07,865 --> 00:03:08,810
let me pay you.

65
00:03:10,338 --> 00:03:11,312
That should cover it.

66
00:03:18,076 --> 00:03:18,633
Thanks.

67
00:03:20,098 --> 00:03:20,552
Oh, hey...

68
00:03:22,365 --> 00:03:23,711
Don't forget
your wrench.

69
00:03:38,775 --> 00:03:41,473
You handled that
very well, son.

70
00:03:42,316 --> 00:03:44,041
Now help me
find a tarp.

71
00:03:56,215 --> 00:03:57,113
What  are you doing?

72
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:01,280
You don't want her identified
through dental records, do you?

73
00:04:05,055 --> 00:04:06,293
I must say,

74
00:04:07,098 --> 00:04:10,571
I never realized your
job was so difficult.

75
00:04:10,865 --> 00:04:11,982
It's not enough to kill her.

76
00:04:11,987 --> 00:04:13,702
You have to desecrate
her body, too?

77
00:04:14,725 --> 00:04:15,871
Get away from her!

78
00:04:22,177 --> 00:04:23,622
Now look what
you've done!

79
00:04:25,155 --> 00:04:27,340
I think my damn
hip's broken.

80
00:04:31,215 --> 00:04:31,893
Help me.

81
00:04:36,726 --> 00:04:37,563
Yes...

82
00:04:39,676 --> 00:04:41,973
Orson Hodge had
always assumed

83
00:04:41,978 --> 00:04:44,303
that his life would
flash before his eyes

84
00:04:44,396 --> 00:04:46,290
the moment
before he died.

85
00:04:50,188 --> 00:04:51,632
Luckily, for Orson...

86
00:04:52,748 --> 00:04:53,823
That moment...

87
00:04:53,995 --> 00:04:55,060
I got a pulse!

88
00:04:55,415 --> 00:04:56,641
Let's get him inside!

89
00:04:57,298 --> 00:04:59,523
Was not scheduled for today.

92
00:05:46,745 --> 00:05:49,082
The first light
of sunrise.

93
00:05:52,426 --> 00:05:54,460
The sound of
the cat purring.

94
00:05:57,255 --> 00:05:59,563
The smell of
fresh coffee.

95
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:04,130
Yes, there are many things

96
00:06:04,137 --> 00:06:06,420
a housewife
likes to wake up to.

97
00:06:07,006 --> 00:06:09,462
But an unexpected
guest in her bed...

98
00:06:09,747 --> 00:06:11,453
is not one of them.

99
00:06:12,346 --> 00:06:13,032
Zach?

100
00:06:14,697 --> 00:06:16,703
You're... in your
underwear.

101
00:06:17,345 --> 00:06:20,203
Well, I needed to put on something
to get the morning paper.

102
00:06:21,598 --> 00:06:23,210
You've been
here all night?

103
00:06:23,765 --> 00:06:24,352
Sure.

104
00:06:24,866 --> 00:06:27,201
I'm not one of those guys who
gets up and leaves right after.

105
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:29,561
Right after what?

106
00:06:30,187 --> 00:06:31,253
Do you wanna
hear me say it?

107
00:06:32,186 --> 00:06:32,642
Fine.

108
00:06:33,557 --> 00:06:34,441
You were...

109
00:06:35,137 --> 00:06:35,970
amazing.

110
00:06:40,638 --> 00:06:43,463
Okay, listen to me
very carefully,

111
00:06:43,768 --> 00:06:45,602
and this is no time
to be vague.

112
00:06:45,648 --> 00:06:47,492
What exactly
was I amazing at?

113
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,393
Please tell me that
once contained a mint.

114
00:06:56,247 --> 00:06:57,402
After a few drinks,

115
00:06:58,117 --> 00:06:59,393
you told me how
lonely you were,

116
00:06:59,798 --> 00:07:02,523
and that I was the kindest man
you'd met in a few years, and, uh...

117
00:07:03,318 --> 00:07:04,283
then you kissed me.

118
00:07:05,848 --> 00:07:07,970
-And then you took off your...
-Okay, okay, stop talking.

119
00:07:08,385 --> 00:07:09,600
I'm getting nauseous.

120
00:07:11,805 --> 00:07:12,873
This is so great.

121
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:15,281
I have so many
awesome plans for us.

122
00:07:16,505 --> 00:07:17,121
"Us."

123
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:20,312
Oh, man. It feels so
good to say that.

124
00:07:22,186 --> 00:07:23,402
Oh, God.
Here it comes.

125
00:07:24,035 --> 00:07:25,440
Would you like me
to hold your hair, honey?

126
00:07:25,525 --> 00:07:26,282
No!

127
00:07:43,756 --> 00:07:46,023
Hey, what are
you doing?

128
00:07:46,206 --> 00:07:48,342
I'm lying in bed, thinking
about the opening tonight,

129
00:07:48,398 --> 00:07:49,223
when it hits me... 

130
00:07:51,045 --> 00:07:52,531
We could run
out of breadsticks.

131
00:07:52,606 --> 00:07:55,282
Oh, honey, you
have had, what,

132
00:07:55,385 --> 00:07:57,421
four hours sleep in
the past three days?

133
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:00,221
You need rest. Who cares
if we run out of breadsticks?

134
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:01,751
I do!

135
00:08:02,077 --> 00:08:03,450
Tonight's the most
important night of my life.

136
00:08:03,695 --> 00:08:04,803
Everything's
gotta be perfect.

137
00:08:05,987 --> 00:08:07,330
Here. Try that.

138
00:08:10,035 --> 00:08:10,922
It's good.

139
00:08:10,975 --> 00:08:12,461
No.  Too salty.

140
00:08:13,178 --> 00:08:15,480
If  they're salty,
we'll sell more beer.

141
00:08:15,485 --> 00:08:16,793
See? You're a genius.

142
00:08:16,905 --> 00:08:18,090
Don't patronize me!

143
00:08:18,096 --> 00:08:21,100
Oh, my God.
This is gonna be a disaster.

144
00:08:21,273 --> 00:08:23,079
Hey, chill out.

145
00:08:23,176 --> 00:08:25,490
You're acting like I did when
I was six months pregnant.

146
00:08:26,612 --> 00:08:28,607
Uh, excuse me.
You were hitting people.

147
00:08:28,989 --> 00:08:29,820
Only two.

148
00:08:30,075 --> 00:08:32,380
And the mailman had the good
taste never to bring that up again.

149
00:08:32,766 --> 00:08:34,021
Come on. Let's go
get some sleep.

150
00:08:34,156 --> 00:08:36,701
The dough maker and the
chairs get delivered at noon.

151
00:08:36,737 --> 00:08:38,983
I know. I'm the one
that put in the order.

152
00:08:39,008 --> 00:08:42,073
I will handle anything
that needs to be done.

153
00:08:42,127 --> 00:08:45,252
And you, take these
and get some sleep.

154
00:08:45,255 --> 00:08:46,812
Come on. We need you
at your best tonight.

155
00:08:51,508 --> 00:08:53,141
You're right.
I'm sorry. Crazy.

156
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:57,110
Honey glaze.

157
00:08:57,348 --> 00:08:59,662
Honey glaze will cut the
salt in the breadsticks.

158
00:09:00,925 --> 00:09:03,612
Tom, I do not need to be
pregnant to kick your ass.

159
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:04,892
Now go.

160
00:09:05,595 --> 00:09:06,070
Go on.

161
00:09:19,086 --> 00:09:20,530
Andrew, you're here.

162
00:09:24,547 --> 00:09:25,953
What happened to me?

163
00:09:26,847 --> 00:09:28,830
You kinda had
an accident.

164
00:09:29,665 --> 00:09:30,792
You fell off
our ladder.

165
00:09:31,197 --> 00:09:32,361
Oh, that's right.

166
00:09:34,718 --> 00:09:35,931
Is Orson here?

167
00:09:39,285 --> 00:09:41,203
Yeah, he's at
the hospital but,

168
00:09:42,108 --> 00:09:43,922
he's not
exactly visiting.

169
00:09:45,555 --> 00:09:46,651
Suicide?

170
00:09:47,325 --> 00:09:50,183
No. Orson would never
try to kill himself.

171
00:09:50,538 --> 00:09:52,601
The police are wrong.
It must have been an accident.

172
00:09:52,797 --> 00:09:55,042
But they found his footprints
on the trunk of his car.

173
00:09:55,406 --> 00:09:57,240
The only reason he'd
be up there is to jump.

174
00:09:57,696 --> 00:09:58,543
But why?

175
00:09:59,996 --> 00:10:01,461
Maybe he was
feeling guilty.

176
00:10:02,938 --> 00:10:03,670
For what?

177
00:10:05,798 --> 00:10:07,361
Mom, I looked
at that ladder.

178
00:10:07,366 --> 00:10:08,990
Someone sawed
through the rung.

179
00:10:10,715 --> 00:10:11,540
And you think...

180
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:13,523
I heard you two in your
room the other day.

181
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:16,403
You told him to turn
himself in or else...

182
00:10:16,665 --> 00:10:18,451
The next day,
you fall and nearly die.

183
00:10:18,505 --> 00:10:19,972
You think that's
a coincidence?

184
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:23,982
And you say he's
just down the hall?

185
00:10:24,485 --> 00:10:25,390
Yeah, but don't worry.

186
00:10:25,415 --> 00:10:27,112
I told them not to
let him near you,

187
00:10:27,596 --> 00:10:29,641
and we're gonna get you
home as soon as we can.

188
00:10:37,847 --> 00:10:38,631
Can I help you?

189
00:10:39,426 --> 00:10:41,471
I'm here to pick up
my wife's belongings.

190
00:10:41,777 --> 00:10:42,841
Jane Hainsworth?

191
00:10:43,077 --> 00:10:44,072
Oh, yes.

192
00:10:44,696 --> 00:10:46,013
I'm so sorry
for your loss.

193
00:10:46,115 --> 00:10:47,041
I'll be right back.

194
00:10:50,367 --> 00:10:51,342
You doing okay?

195
00:10:52,197 --> 00:10:54,421
Not really, but having
you here helps.

196
00:10:56,608 --> 00:10:57,973
Oh, hey, Mrs. Mayer.

197
00:10:58,068 --> 00:10:59,982
Andrew, what are you
doing at the hospital?

198
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:02,441
You haven't heard?

199
00:11:08,448 --> 00:11:09,150
Hey.

200
00:11:10,776 --> 00:11:11,781
Susan.

201
00:11:13,457 --> 00:11:15,361
I just heard from
Andrew what happened.

202
00:11:15,365 --> 00:11:16,612
I had to come see you.

203
00:11:17,848 --> 00:11:19,090
If you want me
to go, uh...

204
00:11:19,336 --> 00:11:20,543
No, no. Come in.

205
00:11:22,718 --> 00:11:24,280
I know we've
been fighting.

206
00:11:24,697 --> 00:11:27,762
Something like this happens, it just
puts everything into perspective.

207
00:11:27,765 --> 00:11:29,233
I am so sorry.

208
00:11:29,595 --> 00:11:30,913
It was all my fault.

209
00:11:31,177 --> 00:11:33,400
If I hadn't got so caught
up in protecting Mike...

210
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:34,641
Susan, stop.

211
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:37,253
Mike is innocent.

212
00:11:37,306 --> 00:11:40,261
He had nothing to do with
Monique Polier's murder.

213
00:11:41,656 --> 00:11:42,642
Do you know
something?

214
00:11:43,447 --> 00:11:46,810
Yes, and I intend
to go to the police.

215
00:11:48,658 --> 00:11:49,791
Oh, my God.

216
00:11:51,158 --> 00:11:53,370
Does this have something
to do with Orson's accident?

217
00:11:54,318 --> 00:11:55,842
I can't tell you
right now.

218
00:11:57,345 --> 00:11:59,833
You're just gonna have to
trust me. Can you do that?

219
00:12:03,865 --> 00:12:04,760
Of course.

220
00:12:09,517 --> 00:12:10,810
I should let you rest.

221
00:12:17,646 --> 00:12:19,431
So we're back
to being friends?

222
00:12:22,086 --> 00:12:23,360
We never
really stopped.

223
00:12:27,415 --> 00:12:30,611
Um, excuse me. These
things don't belong to Jane.

224
00:12:31,215 --> 00:12:31,880
Are you sure?

225
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:33,891
Oh, every couple
has their secrets,

226
00:12:33,895 --> 00:12:35,991
But I'm pretty sure she
wasn't a closet whittler.

227
00:12:41,256 --> 00:12:42,272
"Mike Delfino."

228
00:12:42,776 --> 00:12:44,343
Oh, these are
Mike's things?

229
00:12:44,436 --> 00:12:46,962
Yep. Someone made
a big mistake.

230
00:12:47,116 --> 00:12:49,340
Helen, you screwed
up the labels again!

231
00:12:54,956 --> 00:12:56,661
He had an engagement
ring with him.

232
00:12:56,918 --> 00:12:57,650
Ooh, that's pretty.

233
00:13:00,607 --> 00:13:02,511
You know, Mike and
I are good friends.

234
00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:04,911
I could return these
things to him, if you like.

235
00:13:05,626 --> 00:13:07,601
Sorry. He'll have
to pick 'em up himself.

236
00:13:08,075 --> 00:13:09,311
It's hospital policy.

237
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:13,752
It's also hospital policy to put the
right labels on the right boxes!

238
00:13:14,298 --> 00:13:14,861
Ian!

239
00:13:15,256 --> 00:13:16,542
Ian, you're not
gonna believe this.

240
00:13:17,217 --> 00:13:19,272
Bree just told me she can
prove Mike's innocent.

241
00:13:19,976 --> 00:13:20,502
What?

242
00:13:20,526 --> 00:13:21,242
It's true.

243
00:13:21,246 --> 00:13:23,201
He's gonna be a free man.
Isn't that great?

244
00:13:24,405 --> 00:13:26,542
Yes, it's bloody
fantastic.

245
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:29,790
Here.

246
00:13:30,236 --> 00:13:32,400
I'm gonna go get Bree some
flowers. I'll be right back.

247
00:13:37,898 --> 00:13:39,391
No, no, that's great news.

248
00:13:40,145 --> 00:13:40,793
Thank you, doctor.

249
00:13:41,856 --> 00:13:43,753
So Orson's gonna
pull through?

250
00:13:44,428 --> 00:13:45,293
You'd rather
he didn't?

251
00:13:47,155 --> 00:13:47,952
No. 

252
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:51,141
I just don't know what he's gonna
tell the police when he wakes up.

253
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:52,492
It wasn't your fault.

254
00:13:52,616 --> 00:13:54,533
Orson, falling off that roof
was an accident, right?

255
00:13:55,537 --> 00:13:56,701
Well, sort of.

256
00:13:57,256 --> 00:13:57,963
Sort of?

257
00:13:59,388 --> 00:14:00,891
Depending on what
Orson tells them,

258
00:14:02,076 --> 00:14:03,703
I could get charged
with attempted murder.

259
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:15,533
Well, I'm so glad she has
you to take care of her,

260
00:14:15,535 --> 00:14:18,151
and  of course your Mom
comes first, Andrew.

261
00:14:18,255 --> 00:14:20,382
And I wouldn't even ask
except, you know,

262
00:14:20,595 --> 00:14:22,322
-we're opening tonight-
-Chairs are here.

263
00:14:24,888 --> 00:14:26,173
Oh, God. Seriously?

264
00:14:26,406 --> 00:14:28,713
Fantastic. Thank you.
It's just two quick hours,

265
00:14:28,717 --> 00:14:30,591
and then we'll get you right
back home with your Mom.

266
00:14:31,026 --> 00:14:32,822
Thank you, Andrew.
Okay. Bye-bye.

267
00:14:33,656 --> 00:14:37,241
Did you finish folding
the takeout menus?

268
00:14:37,975 --> 00:14:39,231
You never asked
me to do that.

269
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,322
I shouldn't have to tell you every little
thing, you know. Show some initiative.

270
00:14:43,448 --> 00:14:43,931
Wait.

271
00:14:44,427 --> 00:14:46,373
Where are my chairs?
I didn't order these.

272
00:14:46,775 --> 00:14:48,001
-You're Lynette Scavo?
-Yes.

273
00:14:48,975 --> 00:14:50,053
Well,  then you
ordered these.

274
00:14:50,637 --> 00:14:53,703
No. Why would I order 50 high
chairs for the opening of a pizzeria?

275
00:14:53,876 --> 00:14:54,563
I don't know.

276
00:14:54,638 --> 00:14:56,591
I thought it was one of
those kiddie pizza places

277
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:58,242
with the games and
the animatronic rats.

278
00:14:58,268 --> 00:14:58,850
Give me that.

279
00:14:58,906 --> 00:14:59,890
Easy there, sally.

280
00:14:59,896 --> 00:15:03,003
"Animatronic rats."
Where do they find you people?

281
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:04,753
Okay, okay,
here it is. See?

282
00:15:04,966 --> 00:15:07,600
I ordered 50 of
item number 7-3...

283
00:15:09,765 --> 00:15:11,010
Did we find
the mistake?

284
00:15:11,227 --> 00:15:13,620
I switched
the 7 and the 1.

285
00:15:15,097 --> 00:15:17,291
So... we're
both wrong.

286
00:15:17,677 --> 00:15:19,510
Now this place opens
in five hours.

287
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:21,061
How long will it
take to fix this?

288
00:15:24,675 --> 00:15:27,591
Hi. I need to rent 50
chairs by tonight at 5:00.

289
00:15:28,378 --> 00:15:28,970
What?

290
00:15:29,648 --> 00:15:30,393
Why not?

291
00:15:31,337 --> 00:15:32,990
What do you mean,
it's bar mitzvah season?

292
00:15:32,996 --> 00:15:34,081
There's no such thing.

293
00:15:34,948 --> 00:15:37,843
You still have five.
I will take those. Scavo.

294
00:15:38,067 --> 00:15:41,002
Okay, that brings us to 22.

295
00:15:41,127 --> 00:15:43,640
Javi, Rico, we got
chairs to find. Move it.

296
00:15:52,055 --> 00:15:54,321
Looks like someone crawled into
a bottle of Merlot last night.

297
00:15:55,066 --> 00:15:57,312
I sort of threw myself
a little birthday party.

298
00:15:58,206 --> 00:16:00,533
So if you don't mind, I'd like
to get back to my dry heaving.

299
00:16:00,818 --> 00:16:01,483
Quick question.

300
00:16:02,438 --> 00:16:04,940
Was that Zach Young I saw leaving
your house 8:00 this morning?

301
00:16:06,948 --> 00:16:09,042
Uh, oh, yeah. Um...

302
00:16:09,505 --> 00:16:11,091
He just came by to, uh...

303
00:16:12,175 --> 00:16:13,561
drop off a birthday card.

304
00:16:14,555 --> 00:16:16,961
Really cute little
cat with balloons.

305
00:16:17,985 --> 00:16:18,642
All right, bye.

306
00:16:19,596 --> 00:16:20,161
Follow-up.

307
00:16:22,716 --> 00:16:25,090
Why was Zach in your driveway
at 7:00 this morning...

308
00:16:25,996 --> 00:16:26,840
In his underwear?

309
00:16:35,165 --> 00:16:37,141
We had sex
last night!

310
00:16:37,298 --> 00:16:37,722
What?!

311
00:16:37,765 --> 00:16:40,453
I mean, I think we did.
That's what he told me.

312
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:41,920
Weren't you there?

313
00:16:42,065 --> 00:16:43,692
No, I don't remember
anything!

314
00:16:43,707 --> 00:16:46,052
I just woke up, and he
was in bed next to me.

315
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,243
Thanks again, Gaby.
Hey, Carlos.

316
00:16:52,555 --> 00:16:53,940
If you don't remember,

317
00:16:54,248 --> 00:16:56,861
then how can you be sure
that you and Zach had sex?

318
00:16:56,965 --> 00:16:58,720
Well, we were
both half-naked,

319
00:16:59,015 --> 00:17:01,223
and there was 
a condom wrapper.

320
00:17:01,378 --> 00:17:04,000
And he said I was amazing,
which totally sounds like me.

321
00:17:05,088 --> 00:17:07,652
He thinks we're a couple now.
You have to help me.

322
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,063
I am not getting involved.

323
00:17:11,526 --> 00:17:13,771
God, I can't believe you bagged
another neighborhood kid.

324
00:17:14,285 --> 00:17:15,182
Where are you going?

325
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:18,101
To warn the Scavo boys.

326
00:17:28,015 --> 00:17:29,841
I wanna speak
to my wife.

327
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,051
She's  resting.

328
00:17:31,697 --> 00:17:33,531
If we can get back
to these questions...

329
00:17:34,297 --> 00:17:35,680
I fell off a roof.

330
00:17:35,748 --> 00:17:38,220
I need a physician,
not a psychiatrist.

331
00:17:38,477 --> 00:17:39,923
Well, I'm afraid
it's hospital policy

332
00:17:39,927 --> 00:17:41,790
when there's a suspected
suicide attempt.

333
00:17:42,358 --> 00:17:43,751
I didn't try
to kill myself.

334
00:17:44,557 --> 00:17:45,933
But you do
have a certain...

335
00:17:46,445 --> 00:17:47,060
history?

336
00:17:48,656 --> 00:17:51,680
You spent most of 1976
in a psychiatric hospital.

337
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:54,960
I don't care
to discuss that.

338
00:17:56,816 --> 00:17:58,321
You won't be leaving
here until we do.

339
00:18:05,407 --> 00:18:07,680
My parents were
very religious.

340
00:18:09,277 --> 00:18:11,352
When I was 16,
my father had an affair,

341
00:18:11,776 --> 00:18:13,770
caused quite a scandal
at our church.

342
00:18:14,926 --> 00:18:17,711
He became depressed.
He started drinking heavily.

343
00:18:18,778 --> 00:18:19,952
My mother grew
concerned.

344
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:21,672
She didn't like
leaving him alone.

345
00:18:22,758 --> 00:18:24,360
One night, she had
to visit a sick friend,

346
00:18:24,365 --> 00:18:26,003
and she asked me
to keep an eye on him.

347
00:18:26,287 --> 00:18:27,701
But I had made plans
with friends.

348
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:29,690
I thought I could
duck out for a while.

349
00:18:31,008 --> 00:18:32,993
When I got home,
I found him in the bathroom.

350
00:18:38,725 --> 00:18:39,883
You blamed yourself?

351
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:43,112
I didn't need to.

352
00:18:43,786 --> 00:18:46,042
Mother blamed me
enough for both of us.

353
00:18:47,067 --> 00:18:49,312
That must have caused quite
a strain in your relationship.

354
00:18:49,987 --> 00:18:50,522
Yes.

355
00:18:52,366 --> 00:18:53,583
But now and then,

356
00:18:53,586 --> 00:18:56,572
she suggests little ways
I might make it up to her.

357
00:18:58,488 --> 00:19:01,173
Yes, I'm calling to check
on the status of a patient.

358
00:19:01,937 --> 00:19:02,993
Last name Hodge.

359
00:19:04,755 --> 00:19:06,810
What do you mean,
"which Hodge"?

360
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:12,900
Gloria!

361
00:19:13,127 --> 00:19:15,161
Thank God. I thought
you'd forgotten about me.

362
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:16,971
When are you
letting me out of here?

363
00:19:17,088 --> 00:19:18,390
It won't be long now.

364
00:19:19,046 --> 00:19:21,960
In fact, something interesting
happened last night.

365
00:19:22,526 --> 00:19:24,053
Orson tried
to kill himself.

366
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:26,242
Oh, my goodness.
Is he okay?

367
00:19:26,578 --> 00:19:27,471
He'll be fine.

368
00:19:27,585 --> 00:19:28,903
My point is,

369
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:32,711
Suicide is hardly the act
of a happily married man.

370
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:36,970
Gloria, for God
sake, give it up.

371
00:19:37,178 --> 00:19:39,200
He doesn't love me.

372
00:19:39,615 --> 00:19:40,431
He will, dear.

373
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:42,643
Bree will be
gone soon,

374
00:19:43,227 --> 00:19:46,520
and he'll need a good woman
like you to console him.

375
00:19:48,718 --> 00:19:49,890
What are you gonna
do to Bree?

376
00:19:51,927 --> 00:19:52,623
Gloria?

377
00:19:53,765 --> 00:19:54,690
Gloria?

378
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,251
-Oh, hey, hon.
-Hey.

379
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:15,263
Did you get
some sleep?

380
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:19,143
Yes. I'm still kind of groggy
from those pills, but...

381
00:20:24,345 --> 00:20:25,601
And now I'm awake.

382
00:20:25,936 --> 00:20:28,352
Okay, little mix-up
with the new chairs.

383
00:20:28,355 --> 00:20:31,032
Which you were
in charge of.

384
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:33,012
Okay, okay,
we could point fingers,

385
00:20:33,027 --> 00:20:35,782
but what's important is forgetting
about what we expected,

386
00:20:35,787 --> 00:20:39,823
and focusing on what we
have, which isn't so bad.

387
00:20:40,047 --> 00:20:43,072
I mean, all the different
kinds of chairs

388
00:20:43,077 --> 00:20:46,280
give the place a kind
of bohemian vibe.

389
00:20:46,726 --> 00:20:49,872
Plus, if we get a lot of babies,
look, we're just totally set.

390
00:20:52,106 --> 00:20:54,341
Tom, I'm sorry.

391
00:20:54,367 --> 00:20:55,552
I am. I'm sorry.

392
00:20:55,558 --> 00:20:59,421
I just, I realize
it's not... perfect.

393
00:21:01,877 --> 00:21:02,392
But...

394
00:21:04,545 --> 00:21:05,813
Please say something.

395
00:21:08,865 --> 00:21:10,002
What can I say,
Lynette?

396
00:21:11,967 --> 00:21:13,662
It is what it is.

397
00:21:19,506 --> 00:21:21,070
Why do I have
to babysit Mom?

398
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:23,121
All my friends are
gonna be at the opening.

399
00:21:23,676 --> 00:21:25,291
Austin was gonna
sneak us beer!

400
00:21:25,395 --> 00:21:27,053
Damn it, Danielle,
I have to work!

401
00:21:27,128 --> 00:21:28,571
Our mother's lying
helpless upstairs

402
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:30,153
'cause her husband
tried to kill her.

403
00:21:30,546 --> 00:21:33,011
Now for just one night,
could you try to be responsible?

404
00:21:37,406 --> 00:21:39,591
I liked you better when
you were a psychopath!

405
00:22:01,475 --> 00:22:02,143
Here you go.

406
00:22:04,777 --> 00:22:06,131
Oh, you're... here.

407
00:22:06,397 --> 00:22:07,193
I wouldn't have
missed it.

408
00:22:07,577 --> 00:22:09,340
You know how I feel
about Lynette and Tom.

409
00:22:10,565 --> 00:22:12,250
Look, Zach,
I'm glad you're here.

410
00:22:12,257 --> 00:22:14,270
I've been wanting
to talk about us.

411
00:22:14,576 --> 00:22:16,943
Me, too. You, uh,
being in my life now,

412
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:19,901
having the connection
that we do,

413
00:22:20,098 --> 00:22:24,010
this is really the first time that I've been
happy since my mother killed herself.

414
00:22:27,437 --> 00:22:28,553
Would you excuse
me a second?

415
00:22:29,316 --> 00:22:30,682
Of course, baby.
Hurry back.

416
00:22:34,598 --> 00:22:35,943
I am in hell.

417
00:22:36,126 --> 00:22:37,960
I just tried to break up with
Zach, and the little twerp

418
00:22:37,968 --> 00:22:39,651
played the dead
Mommy card.

419
00:22:40,066 --> 00:22:41,561
Well, you can't let him
make you feel guilty.

420
00:22:41,766 --> 00:22:42,912
But I am guilty.

421
00:22:43,077 --> 00:22:45,211
I don't remember how
we ended up in bed together.

422
00:22:45,276 --> 00:22:46,830
Maybe I led him on.

423
00:22:47,305 --> 00:22:48,540
I gotta be sensitive here.

424
00:22:50,086 --> 00:22:51,392
Could you threaten
him for me?

425
00:22:51,955 --> 00:22:52,500
What?

426
00:22:52,726 --> 00:22:54,153
You know,
intimidate him.

427
00:22:54,197 --> 00:22:56,631
Do the whole jealous,
latin ex-husband thing you do.

428
00:22:56,985 --> 00:22:58,563
Tell him if you can't
have me, nobody can.

429
00:22:58,568 --> 00:23:00,782
Forget it. I'm not gonna
to do that to poor Zach.

430
00:23:01,097 --> 00:23:02,891
Hey, I am looking
out for Zach, too.

431
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:05,423
If I dump him,
it'll destroy him emotionally.

432
00:23:05,716 --> 00:23:06,883
Better to scare him off.

433
00:23:09,938 --> 00:23:10,950
Please?

434
00:23:14,187 --> 00:23:14,931
Fine.

435
00:23:15,466 --> 00:23:16,333
Thank you!

436
00:23:16,506 --> 00:23:17,621
Okay, look,
there he goes.

437
00:23:19,095 --> 00:23:19,483
Go!

438
00:23:19,706 --> 00:23:21,090
Go get all cholo
on his ass.

439
00:23:35,075 --> 00:23:36,173
Hey, Mr. Solis.

440
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:37,363
Hey.

441
00:23:41,778 --> 00:23:43,202
Look, I need to talk to you
about something.

442
00:23:44,038 --> 00:23:45,123
It's a little
awkward, but...

443
00:23:52,045 --> 00:23:52,842
Mr. Solis?

444
00:23:54,006 --> 00:23:54,401
What?

445
00:23:55,316 --> 00:23:58,090
You were just saying that
something was awkward?

446
00:23:59,427 --> 00:24:00,110
Never mind.

447
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:02,983
Forget that
I said anything.

448
00:24:07,395 --> 00:24:08,341
Hey. So how'd it go?

449
00:24:09,527 --> 00:24:10,982
You did not have sex
with Zach young.

450
00:24:11,988 --> 00:24:14,091
Really?
Did he tell you that?

451
00:24:14,447 --> 00:24:15,341
He didn't have to.

452
00:24:16,267 --> 00:24:16,732
What?

453
00:24:17,528 --> 00:24:19,153
I was standing next
to him at the urinal.

454
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:21,320
I don't care how
drunk you were.

455
00:24:21,666 --> 00:24:23,932
If you had sex with him,
you'd remember.

456
00:24:25,567 --> 00:24:26,931
Little Zach Young?

457
00:24:29,448 --> 00:24:31,391
Well, just how much
would I have remembered?

458
00:24:49,425 --> 00:24:51,031
Hey. What are
you doing here?

459
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:53,460
I thought Bree
might like some soup.

460
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:56,140
It's my own
special recipe.

461
00:24:59,145 --> 00:25:00,870
I'm surprised
to find you home.

462
00:25:01,597 --> 00:25:04,711
I thought the whole street
was going to Scavo's tonight.

463
00:25:05,405 --> 00:25:06,863
Well, I was
supposed to go,

464
00:25:06,976 --> 00:25:10,032
but Andrew said I had to
stay home and babysit Mom.

465
00:25:10,246 --> 00:25:12,700
Well, that's just silly.

466
00:25:13,436 --> 00:25:16,461
A vibrant young lady like
you should be at the party,

467
00:25:16,786 --> 00:25:18,472
turning boys' heads.

468
00:25:19,546 --> 00:25:20,240
You go.

469
00:25:21,485 --> 00:25:22,901
I'll look after
your mother.

470
00:25:23,538 --> 00:25:24,412
You mean it?

471
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:27,161
Just take her
dinner up first.

472
00:25:27,406 --> 00:25:30,992
I don't think I can manage
the tray with my cane.

473
00:25:31,456 --> 00:25:33,083
Thanks, Grandma.
You're the best!

474
00:25:35,266 --> 00:25:36,801
This soup
smells so good.

475
00:25:37,276 --> 00:25:40,502
You wanna score some points?
Don't say I brought it.

476
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:43,082
Tell her you
made it yourself.

477
00:26:17,137 --> 00:26:17,993
Hey!

478
00:26:22,955 --> 00:26:23,891
Hello?

479
00:26:24,835 --> 00:26:25,881
Over here!

480
00:26:41,606 --> 00:26:44,043
Honey, there is
a line out the door.

481
00:26:44,057 --> 00:26:45,443
We are gonna
make a killing tonight.

482
00:26:45,577 --> 00:26:46,653
I'm happy for you.

483
00:26:47,767 --> 00:26:48,432
For us.

484
00:26:49,157 --> 00:26:49,950
Now it's "us"?

485
00:26:50,035 --> 00:26:52,603
Because I thought I was the one
who was trying to ruin everything.

486
00:26:53,686 --> 00:26:54,452
Hey, look,

487
00:26:54,996 --> 00:26:56,050
I know I overreacted...

488
00:26:56,056 --> 00:26:58,972
Yes, you did.
But I have customers.

489
00:27:05,907 --> 00:27:07,022
The place came
out great, huh?

490
00:27:07,465 --> 00:27:08,093
Sure did.

491
00:27:10,076 --> 00:27:12,103
Looks like, uh,
the whole street's here.

492
00:27:12,507 --> 00:27:13,000
Yeah.

493
00:27:15,407 --> 00:27:17,940
Except for Orson,
who fell off a roof.

494
00:27:18,796 --> 00:27:20,012
You know anything
about that?

495
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:22,471
Why would you
think that?

496
00:27:24,085 --> 00:27:26,400
I heard you talking to Carlos.
Now answer the question.

497
00:27:27,925 --> 00:27:29,733
I can't talk
about it here.

498
00:27:31,676 --> 00:27:32,623
It's complicated.

499
00:27:34,276 --> 00:27:35,440
It always is with you.

500
00:27:36,596 --> 00:27:39,140
Hey. I just had a slice
of pizza. It's pretty good.

501
00:27:39,935 --> 00:27:41,093
Is it really good,

502
00:27:41,097 --> 00:27:43,223
or are you just pretending
you had a slice?

503
00:27:45,327 --> 00:27:47,163
You and I did not
have sex. Admit it!

504
00:27:47,695 --> 00:27:48,480
Of course we did.

505
00:27:48,538 --> 00:27:49,110
Zach!

506
00:27:49,468 --> 00:27:52,472
How can you claim to care
about me and lie to my face?

507
00:27:55,817 --> 00:27:56,493
I'm sorry.

508
00:27:57,468 --> 00:27:58,903
I'm tired of just
being your friend.

509
00:27:59,768 --> 00:28:02,641
I thought if you saw me as a lover,
you can think of me as a man, not...

510
00:28:02,918 --> 00:28:03,580
not a boy.

511
00:28:04,248 --> 00:28:06,143
Zach, a real
man is honest.

512
00:28:06,365 --> 00:28:07,782
All you've ever
tried to do Is bribe

513
00:28:07,787 --> 00:28:09,623
and trick me into falling
in love with you.

514
00:28:09,965 --> 00:28:12,393
A little advice next time?
Don't play games.

515
00:28:12,738 --> 00:28:14,993
Just stand up and
be the kind of man

516
00:28:14,997 --> 00:28:17,241
a woman would be proud
to share her life with.

517
00:28:22,206 --> 00:28:23,331
Hello!

518
00:28:25,706 --> 00:28:27,913
I think it's high time
to make a toast.

519
00:28:29,175 --> 00:28:30,273
Tom, where are you?

520
00:28:30,946 --> 00:28:33,980
Where... Ah.
Tom, you did it.

521
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:37,921
There are a lot of people in this room
that didn't think you could pull it off.

522
00:28:39,396 --> 00:28:40,870
Okay, well,
maybe just me.

523
00:28:42,496 --> 00:28:44,361
Anyway, congratulations.

524
00:28:45,355 --> 00:28:49,842
The pizza is excellent,
and the service is sublime.

525
00:28:50,338 --> 00:28:51,182
Cheers.
Cheers.

526
00:28:51,816 --> 00:28:52,582
Speech!

527
00:28:54,927 --> 00:28:57,182
Thank you.
Thank you for coming.

528
00:28:57,475 --> 00:28:59,890
It means everything
in the world to me.

529
00:29:00,186 --> 00:29:03,802
I gotta tell you, when I arrived here this
afternoon, I saw all these weird chairs,

530
00:29:04,118 --> 00:29:06,620
I thought the evening was
gonna be a total disaster.

531
00:29:07,737 --> 00:29:11,580
But now when I look out,
I can't even see the chairs.

532
00:29:14,016 --> 00:29:15,600
I just see people eating,

533
00:29:15,948 --> 00:29:17,661
laughing and
having a great time.

534
00:29:19,268 --> 00:29:20,343
It's absolutely perfect.

535
00:29:23,147 --> 00:29:24,762
And none of this
would've happened

536
00:29:24,766 --> 00:29:26,973
without my amazing
partner Lynette.

537
00:29:31,158 --> 00:29:31,953
Who, uh...

538
00:29:34,457 --> 00:29:34,971
To...

539
00:29:40,527 --> 00:29:42,202
I'm sorry.
I'm a little...

540
00:29:45,638 --> 00:29:47,783
I think what my husband
is trying to say is,

541
00:29:48,076 --> 00:29:50,532
if you really want to test a marriage,
open a restaurant together.

542
00:29:51,578 --> 00:29:53,430
Anyway, thank
you for coming.

543
00:29:53,728 --> 00:29:55,342
Eat a lot and
come back,

544
00:29:55,886 --> 00:29:57,822
'cause our kids
need braces.

545
00:30:02,228 --> 00:30:04,973
Actually, as long as everyone
has their glasses raised,

546
00:30:05,046 --> 00:30:07,382
I have something that
I would like to say.

547
00:30:09,418 --> 00:30:11,732
Well, I thought of waiting
for the perfect romantic spot

548
00:30:11,737 --> 00:30:13,312
in which to ask
this question,

549
00:30:13,357 --> 00:30:14,292
but being here tonight,

550
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:18,041
enveloped by so much love
and warmth, I realize that, um,

551
00:30:18,658 --> 00:30:21,162
this is the perfect
romantic spot.

552
00:30:24,566 --> 00:30:25,570
Susan Mayer...

553
00:30:26,487 --> 00:30:27,340
Drop the pizza.

554
00:30:29,387 --> 00:30:32,210
Will you make me the happiest man
in the world and be my wife?

555
00:30:37,027 --> 00:30:38,342
Absolutely, yes!

556
00:30:50,287 --> 00:30:51,222
Ladies and gentlemen,

557
00:30:51,798 --> 00:30:54,501
please, I have something
that I'd like to say also.

558
00:30:57,516 --> 00:30:58,600
Gabrielle Solis...

559
00:30:59,936 --> 00:31:00,762
Will you marry me?

560
00:31:01,968 --> 00:31:02,983
Should I clap?

561
00:31:04,327 --> 00:31:05,712
No, there will be
no clapping!

562
00:31:07,238 --> 00:31:09,131
You, moron,
come with me!

563
00:31:17,878 --> 00:31:19,563
Time for your pills,
Mr. Hodge.

564
00:31:21,355 --> 00:31:22,482
It's after 6:00?

565
00:31:23,467 --> 00:31:25,512
I need to speak with my wife.
What room is she in?

566
00:31:26,327 --> 00:31:27,681
Your wife checked out.

567
00:31:29,086 --> 00:31:29,701
Already?

568
00:31:30,005 --> 00:31:31,680
She was very eager
to get home.

569
00:31:31,985 --> 00:31:33,091
Don't worry.
She'll be fine.

570
00:31:33,537 --> 00:31:34,963
I have to talk to her.

571
00:31:35,446 --> 00:31:37,761
Oh, that reminds me.
Your mother called.

572
00:31:38,007 --> 00:31:39,370
She said she didn't
want to wake you up,

573
00:31:39,427 --> 00:31:41,512
and she wanted to make sure
we'd be keeping you overnight.

574
00:31:42,556 --> 00:31:44,301
Moms are like that,
so protective.

575
00:31:52,685 --> 00:31:53,693
Bree, it's me.

576
00:31:54,067 --> 00:31:54,900
Are you there?

577
00:31:55,848 --> 00:31:56,783
Please, pick up.

578
00:31:57,978 --> 00:31:58,670
Bree?

579
00:32:00,526 --> 00:32:02,542
Please, somebody,
pick up the phone.

580
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:04,923
I know that
you're mad.

581
00:32:04,928 --> 00:32:06,262
I'm not mad,
Zach. I'm done!

582
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:07,932
But you said
to be honest.

583
00:32:07,937 --> 00:32:09,472
I did not say to
humiliate me!

584
00:32:09,475 --> 00:32:11,600
I'm sorry. All right?
I was just trying...

585
00:32:12,407 --> 00:32:13,442
What do you
want from me?

586
00:32:13,475 --> 00:32:15,183
I want you to
leave me alone!

587
00:32:15,756 --> 00:32:18,533
This friends thing isn't gonna work
'cause you're always gonna want more,

588
00:32:18,665 --> 00:32:20,431
and I'm never gonna
love you... ever.

589
00:32:22,298 --> 00:32:24,853
20 years from now when you're
all middle-aged and alone,

590
00:32:25,106 --> 00:32:26,093
you'll regret this.

591
00:32:26,646 --> 00:32:28,031
Okay, I'll take
my chances.

592
00:32:38,676 --> 00:32:39,790
Thought you
might need this.

593
00:32:40,837 --> 00:32:41,623
Bless you.

594
00:32:46,678 --> 00:32:48,373
So how did it go
with Seabiscuit?

595
00:32:49,197 --> 00:32:50,071
He's devastated.

596
00:32:50,655 --> 00:32:51,281
Of course.

597
00:32:51,987 --> 00:32:53,083
It's my fault.

598
00:32:53,785 --> 00:32:56,912
I should've known he couldn't handle
the whole "let's be friends" thing.

599
00:32:58,306 --> 00:32:59,132
I don't blame him.

600
00:33:01,715 --> 00:33:04,061
I'm having kind of a hard time
myself being just your friend,

601
00:33:04,856 --> 00:33:06,341
Watching you
with other guys,

602
00:33:06,587 --> 00:33:07,630
being your confidant.

603
00:33:08,768 --> 00:33:09,312
Really?

604
00:33:10,868 --> 00:33:12,120
I think it's been nice.

605
00:33:13,326 --> 00:33:14,270
For you, maybe.

606
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:19,023
Look, seriously, I don't know how much
longer I'm gonna be able to keep this up.

607
00:33:27,025 --> 00:33:28,483
Well, hang in there
as long as you can,

608
00:33:28,488 --> 00:33:29,790
'cause I still need you.

609
00:33:33,247 --> 00:33:34,172
I'll do my best.

610
00:33:46,957 --> 00:33:47,813
What are you
doing here?

611
00:33:48,006 --> 00:33:50,173
I have better things to
do than babysit Mom.

612
00:33:50,388 --> 00:33:52,081
She's fine.
Gloria's watching her.

613
00:33:52,665 --> 00:33:53,172
What?

614
00:33:53,295 --> 00:33:55,581
I told you Mom's ready to
go to the cops about Orson.

615
00:33:55,587 --> 00:33:57,480
How could you leave her at
home with his crazy mother?

616
00:33:58,726 --> 00:33:59,723
She brought soup!

617
00:34:12,697 --> 00:34:13,381
Gloria?

618
00:34:15,037 --> 00:34:16,241
What are you
doing here?

619
00:34:16,797 --> 00:34:18,480
I came to take
care of you.

620
00:34:19,966 --> 00:34:21,673
I'm so sleepy.

621
00:34:22,008 --> 00:34:24,641
Good. Then the
pills are working.

622
00:34:29,436 --> 00:34:30,541
Andrew?

623
00:34:31,267 --> 00:34:32,191
Danielle?

624
00:34:32,435 --> 00:34:33,371
They're gone.

625
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:36,480
It's just us.

626
00:34:38,048 --> 00:34:38,761
Now...

627
00:34:40,027 --> 00:34:41,150
You rest, hon.

628
00:34:43,356 --> 00:34:47,861
I'm gonna draw you
a nice, warm bath.

629
00:35:26,945 --> 00:35:28,101
Oh, Bree...

630
00:35:29,807 --> 00:35:33,761
I wish I could make you understand
how deeply I regret having to do this.

631
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:36,123
Monique...

632
00:35:36,577 --> 00:35:38,652
that was easy.
She was a slut.

633
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:41,412
You're a good woman.

634
00:35:42,068 --> 00:35:44,592
You didn't know Orson
already had a wife.

635
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:46,563
But he did.

636
00:35:47,935 --> 00:35:51,363
And he made a vow
to her before God.

637
00:35:54,048 --> 00:35:57,083
What sort of mother would
I be if I let him break it?

638
00:36:03,177 --> 00:36:03,941
I'm sorry.

639
00:36:06,888 --> 00:36:10,492
But I will not let him
be his father's son.

640
00:36:34,507 --> 00:36:37,262
Wake up, Mr. Hodge.
I've got dinner.

641
00:36:49,216 --> 00:36:50,833
That water's not
too hot, is it?

642
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:53,412
No.

643
00:36:54,197 --> 00:36:55,342
It's just right.

644
00:37:07,167 --> 00:37:08,912
Mom? Are you all right?

645
00:38:15,395 --> 00:38:16,063
Andrew?

646
00:38:38,045 --> 00:38:40,182
You've done this
before, haven't you?

647
00:38:55,535 --> 00:38:56,192
No!

648
00:39:19,345 --> 00:39:20,283
Is she all right?

649
00:39:20,648 --> 00:39:21,421
She will be.

650
00:39:22,395 --> 00:39:24,531
Get her some blankets
and some dry clothes.

651
00:39:25,227 --> 00:39:26,141
Orson?

652
00:39:29,296 --> 00:39:30,330
Orson!

653
00:39:36,808 --> 00:39:38,111
Something's wrong.

654
00:39:39,756 --> 00:39:40,493
I think I'm...

655
00:39:41,495 --> 00:39:42,752
having a stroke.

656
00:39:43,638 --> 00:39:45,162
You need an
ambulance, mother.

657
00:39:46,956 --> 00:39:50,182
It's too bad there's no one here
who'd dream of calling you one.

658
00:40:02,008 --> 00:40:02,693
What are you doing?

659
00:40:03,456 --> 00:40:05,381
I don't want her
dying in our house.

660
00:40:30,017 --> 00:40:30,593
Hey there.

661
00:40:31,898 --> 00:40:32,980
Are you all right?

662
00:40:33,966 --> 00:40:35,082
Your mother...

663
00:40:36,128 --> 00:40:37,553
She tried to kill me.

664
00:40:38,238 --> 00:40:39,243
Don't worry about her.

665
00:40:40,216 --> 00:40:41,763
She's never gonna
hurt you again,

666
00:40:43,366 --> 00:40:44,531
and neither will Alma.

667
00:40:45,428 --> 00:40:46,043
Alma?

668
00:40:47,096 --> 00:40:47,970
She's dead.

669
00:40:48,508 --> 00:40:49,071
What?

670
00:40:49,476 --> 00:40:51,742
I don't know what happened,
but she's gone.

671
00:40:52,485 --> 00:40:54,100
And she's taking
our troubles with her.

672
00:40:56,858 --> 00:40:58,820
Tomorrow morning,
one of our neighbors

673
00:40:58,827 --> 00:41:01,202
will stumble on
a gruesome surprise.

674
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:05,023
Two bodies side by side.

675
00:41:11,647 --> 00:41:14,651
The police will conclude
that Alma fell from the roof,

676
00:41:15,036 --> 00:41:18,513
and when my mother found her,
she suffered a stroke.

677
00:41:23,015 --> 00:41:24,453
When they search
the house,

678
00:41:24,467 --> 00:41:27,750
they'll find the note Alma wrote
when she faked her suicide,

679
00:41:28,157 --> 00:41:31,683
and next to it, a bag
containing Monique's teeth.

680
00:41:35,977 --> 00:41:37,750
In the face of
such evidence,

681
00:41:38,035 --> 00:41:42,233
they'll have no choice but to drop
the charges against Mike Delfino.

682
00:41:52,996 --> 00:41:56,593
Now, you and I are gonna take that
honeymoon we never got around to.

683
00:42:00,147 --> 00:42:01,343
I'd love that.

684
00:42:07,078 --> 00:42:08,333
What about
your mother?

685
00:42:08,505 --> 00:42:13,672
After all the things she's done,
she's just gonna get off scot-free?

686
00:42:19,096 --> 00:42:21,763
Thank you, doctor.
I know you did all you could.

687
00:42:25,888 --> 00:42:27,283
Good news, mother.

688
00:42:28,855 --> 00:42:32,132
The doctor said your stroke has
left you completely paralyzed.

689
00:42:33,096 --> 00:42:34,153
You can't even speak.

690
00:42:35,068 --> 00:42:37,561
Which means all our secrets
will be safe forever.

691
00:42:40,158 --> 00:42:41,672
Oh, here's the best part.

692
00:42:42,597 --> 00:42:44,641
Your brain is
functioning normally.

693
00:42:45,586 --> 00:42:47,893
So I don't have to worry
about putting you in jail.

694
00:42:48,728 --> 00:42:49,740
You're already there.

695
00:42:52,375 --> 00:42:53,093
Now,

696
00:42:53,847 --> 00:42:54,993
I'm gonna turn
your head,

697
00:42:56,008 --> 00:42:57,962
so you can watch
me walk away.

698
00:42:59,015 --> 00:42:59,932
You don't wanna miss it,

699
00:43:00,887 --> 00:43:03,262
'cause it's the last time
you will ever see me.

700
00:43:15,598 --> 00:43:18,942
A surprising thing
happened to Orson Hodge

701
00:43:19,005 --> 00:43:21,883
as he'd left Fairview
Memorial Hospital.

702
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:27,282
His life began to flash
before his eyes.

703
00:43:29,866 --> 00:43:32,301
But it wasn't his
past he saw.

704
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:34,631
It was his future.

705
00:43:38,125 --> 00:43:40,210
Ordinary suburban days,

706
00:43:41,408 --> 00:43:43,832
filled with ordinary
suburban moments,

707
00:43:44,278 --> 00:43:48,202
each made beautiful because
