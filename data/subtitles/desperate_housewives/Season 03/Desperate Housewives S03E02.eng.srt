1
00:00:00,092 --> 00:00:02,111
Previously on Desperate Housewives...

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:03,840
It means a lot to her to feel included.

3
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:07,160
Sometimes dark clouds
have silver linings...

4
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:09,010
He sort of asked me out.

5
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,480
It's okay with you if
I go out with him?

6
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,850
Sometimes they don't.

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,070
Once that baby comes, I'm gonna
be stuck raising a child alone.

8
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:18,350
When it comes to life
on Wisteria Lane...

9
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:19,530
Will you marry me?

10
00:00:19,567 --> 00:00:21,553
Things that seem too
good to be true...

11
00:00:21,582 --> 00:00:23,217
Does she know you
killed your wife?

12
00:00:23,241 --> 00:00:24,152
Usually turn out...

13
00:00:24,177 --> 00:00:26,269
Get away from him
now while you can.

14
00:00:26,295 --> 00:00:28,350
To be deadly.

15
00:00:30,095 --> 00:00:32,773
Brides are sensitive creatures,

16
00:00:32,785 --> 00:00:38,643
and no one knows this better than the
bridesmaids who have to deal with them.

17
00:00:39,855 --> 00:00:43,751
Well, I think a 10-foot train is great,
but a shorter one would be just as nice,

18
00:00:43,757 --> 00:00:46,313
and you wouldn't have to worry
about people tripping on it.

19
00:00:48,667 --> 00:00:55,203
Personally, I love smoked rabbit, but for a
sure crowd-pleaser, you can't beat chicken.

20
00:00:56,726 --> 00:00:59,562
Uh, sure, who doesn't
love a string quartet?

21
00:00:59,678 --> 00:01:04,421
But if you got a band, maybe people
could dance, as opposed to sway.

22
00:01:05,855 --> 00:01:11,371
But the one area where a bridesmaid's
tact is most required involves the dress...

23
00:01:11,418 --> 00:01:12,820
So what do you think?

24
00:01:13,025 --> 00:01:15,083
she's required to wear.

25
00:01:15,155 --> 00:01:16,653
Well, um...

26
00:01:17,488 --> 00:01:21,281
I'm not sure that I've ever seen
this shade of green before.

27
00:01:21,316 --> 00:01:23,982
Yeah, don't you think it'll be
gorgeous with my coloring?

28
00:01:24,027 --> 00:01:25,943
Yes, it would look perfect.

29
00:01:25,967 --> 00:01:27,553
For someone with your coloring.

30
00:01:27,575 --> 00:01:31,131
I mean, I was lucky to find these. Not easy
putting a wedding together in two weeks.

31
00:01:31,165 --> 00:01:32,963
Then why the rush?

32
00:01:32,996 --> 00:01:36,441
Yeah, Bree, I'd have thought of you
as a person who wants time to plan.

33
00:01:36,468 --> 00:01:41,810
Well, Orson and I talked about it, and
we just feel at our age, it's silly to wait.

34
00:01:41,847 --> 00:01:43,923
And with your help, I'm sure
we can get it all done.

35
00:01:43,957 --> 00:01:46,303
Well, we are happy to pitch in.

36
00:01:46,347 --> 00:01:47,603
Oh, uh, that reminds me.

37
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:49,391
I have to get a copy of
the seating chart for you.

38
00:01:49,428 --> 00:01:51,612
Gaby, you are in charge
of the centerpieces.

39
00:01:51,626 --> 00:01:54,840
And don't worry, Susan.
I will thinkf a job for you.

40
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:57,622
Here's a job.

41
00:01:57,667 --> 00:01:59,870
How about talking you out
of marrying a homicidal dentist?

44
00:02:04,886 --> 00:02:07,283
His wife vanished, and
he didn't even tell Bree.

45
00:02:07,307 --> 00:02:08,723
How much more proof do you need?

46
00:02:08,756 --> 00:02:11,030
He says he's innocent.
She believes him.

47
00:02:11,057 --> 00:02:13,053
If we say we don't, she'll
just end up hating us.

48
00:02:13,085 --> 00:02:13,722
Well, I'm sorry.

49
00:02:13,748 --> 00:02:18,911
I cannot sit here on my key lime ass and
watch Bree make the worst mistake of her life!

50
00:02:20,528 --> 00:02:22,613
And what mistake would that be?

51
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:25,933
Well...

52
00:02:28,978 --> 00:02:30,742
Honestly...

53
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:37,182
Yes, a bridesmaid can question
many of the bride's choices.

54
00:02:37,206 --> 00:02:39,563
These dresses are hideous.

55
00:02:40,268 --> 00:02:44,152
But the groom isn't one of them.

58
00:03:26,945 --> 00:03:29,283
The perfect couple...

59
00:03:29,425 --> 00:03:32,250
We've all met them, haven't we?

60
00:03:32,336 --> 00:03:35,622
That man and woman so
clearly made for each other,

61
00:03:35,665 --> 00:03:38,923
we feel certain they're on
the road to happiness.

62
00:03:38,957 --> 00:03:41,833
But that road has many detours,

63
00:03:41,858 --> 00:03:45,293
and even perfect couples
can find themselves...

64
00:03:45,687 --> 00:03:47,051
at a dead end.

65
00:03:47,238 --> 00:03:48,623
You want what?!

66
00:03:48,656 --> 00:03:49,581
You heard me.

67
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,643
And I want the bedroom stereo.

68
00:03:51,675 --> 00:03:55,093
I want the marble console and
that painting of St. Augustine.

69
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:56,810
You don't even know who he is.

70
00:03:56,845 --> 00:03:58,151
I know he matches the drapes.

71
00:03:58,186 --> 00:03:59,460
People, can we focus here?

72
00:03:59,487 --> 00:04:01,152
And I want my pearl necklace back.

73
00:04:01,165 --> 00:04:02,703
Don't think I didn't notice
that you swiped it.

74
00:04:02,715 --> 00:04:05,830
That was my Mama's and hers before
her. I think it belongs in my family.

75
00:04:05,857 --> 00:04:09,592
There was a time that you thought I belonged
in your family, and you got over that.

76
00:04:10,006 --> 00:04:11,730
-Stop eating my fries!
-I'm hungry.

77
00:04:11,756 --> 00:04:13,030
You know what the doctor said.

78
00:04:13,067 --> 00:04:14,300
You should see his cholesterol.

79
00:04:14,335 --> 00:04:15,643
This man bleeds baking grease.

80
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:17,191
Enough!

81
00:04:19,307 --> 00:04:21,590
You two are gonna have to find
a way to deal with each other,

82
00:04:21,627 --> 00:04:24,101
because you are about to
bring a child into this world.

83
00:04:24,148 --> 00:04:26,761
And  divorced or not,
once that child arrives,

84
00:04:26,797 --> 00:04:30,331
you will be bound together
for as long as you live.

85
00:04:35,095 --> 00:04:37,440
Well, in that case...

86
00:04:38,048 --> 00:04:40,220
Have some more fries.

87
00:04:43,248 --> 00:04:44,691
I'll pick Kayla up on Sunday.

88
00:04:44,728 --> 00:04:45,470
Whenever.

89
00:04:45,508 --> 00:04:48,500
Just go. You and Turk
have a great time.

90
00:04:48,525 --> 00:04:50,320
Oh, trust me, we will.

91
00:04:52,238 --> 00:04:53,873
The man is a jackhammer.

92
00:04:55,027 --> 00:04:56,222
Bye, Tom.

93
00:04:56,316 --> 00:04:58,370
See you Sunday!

94
00:04:58,526 --> 00:05:00,320
Where is she going?

95
00:05:00,358 --> 00:05:04,520
She and Turk are going down
to the river for the weekend.

96
00:05:05,128 --> 00:05:06,722
That's Turk? That's
the new boyfriend?

97
00:05:06,745 --> 00:05:07,512
Uh-Uh, no.

98
00:05:07,556 --> 00:05:08,930
Hey, hey, hey, Tom, please.

99
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:11,542
I don't want my daughter hanging
around with a guy like that.

100
00:05:11,568 --> 00:05:12,820
You haven't even met him.

101
00:05:12,866 --> 00:05:15,610
He could be the sweetest
man in the world.

102
00:05:19,547 --> 00:05:24,083
More importantly, ever since he entered
the picture, squeaky fromme is never around.

103
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:25,703
It has been bliss.

104
00:05:25,748 --> 00:05:28,462
I haven't made this face... in a week.

105
00:05:29,006 --> 00:05:30,712
If you ruin this, so help
me, I will hurt you.

106
00:05:30,745 --> 00:05:32,610
Just look at him.
Look at him, please.

107
00:05:32,647 --> 00:05:35,463
I swear, that is a child's skull
hanging from his rearview mirror.

108
00:05:35,485 --> 00:05:37,023
Doesn't that concern you?

109
00:05:37,055 --> 00:05:38,703
No, I'm good.

110
00:05:39,937 --> 00:05:41,853
Could be a monkey.

111
00:05:42,815 --> 00:05:47,102
Uh, I think I will have the...

112
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:48,511
mesclun salad.

113
00:05:48,558 --> 00:05:51,411
That's it? That's all you're having?

114
00:05:51,547 --> 00:05:53,931
Well, all the food is very expensive.

115
00:05:53,965 --> 00:05:55,291
You don't need to whisper.

116
00:05:55,335 --> 00:05:57,811
The waiter knows
they're robbing us blind.

117
00:05:57,846 --> 00:05:59,980
You can have whatever you want.

118
00:06:00,288 --> 00:06:04,672
In that case, I'll have the lobster bisque
and the veal with the black truffles.

119
00:06:04,696 --> 00:06:05,453
Is that okay?

120
00:06:05,486 --> 00:06:06,471
Yeah, that's fine.

121
00:06:06,498 --> 00:06:08,330
I'll just have jane moved
to the V. A. Hospital.

122
00:06:08,356 --> 00:06:10,103
-Oh, my God.
-I'm kidding.

123
00:06:10,135 --> 00:06:11,302
It's fine.

124
00:06:12,227 --> 00:06:14,103
I'll have what she's having.

125
00:06:14,136 --> 00:06:15,430
Of course.

126
00:06:15,815 --> 00:06:17,562
God, I love seeing you laugh.

127
00:06:17,607 --> 00:06:20,313
Oh,  well, it's been a long time
since I've been in the mood to.

128
00:06:20,365 --> 00:06:21,403
Thank you.

129
00:06:21,425 --> 00:06:23,751
Oh, dear God!

130
00:06:23,805 --> 00:06:25,030
Did I squeeze too hard?

131
00:06:25,067 --> 00:06:27,833
No, it's my wife's parents.

132
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,463
Oh, is this gonna be awkward?

133
00:06:31,495 --> 00:06:34,021
No, no, no, not unless,
of course, they see us.

134
00:06:34,055 --> 00:06:34,963
Ian?

135
00:06:35,287 --> 00:06:36,322
Awkward.

136
00:06:36,746 --> 00:06:41,110
Jeff, Renee, what a delightful surprise.

137
00:06:41,978 --> 00:06:44,890
It's so good to see you, dear.

138
00:06:53,575 --> 00:06:56,592
Hello. I'm Renee, and
this my husband Jeff.

139
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:57,433
Susan Mayer.

140
00:06:57,468 --> 00:06:58,942
Uh, doctor...

141
00:06:59,026 --> 00:07:03,090
Dr. Susan Mayer. She's new
to Jane's neurology team.

142
00:07:04,955 --> 00:07:08,152
I just assumed you worked
in Ian's publishing house.

143
00:07:08,185 --> 00:07:11,671
Well, yes, and how nice
that would've been, huh?

144
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:14,957
Um, but, no, no, I'm a...

145
00:07:15,361 --> 00:07:17,182
A brain specialist.

146
00:07:17,227 --> 00:07:19,299
Well, Dr. Mayer, maybe I can ask you,

147
00:07:19,348 --> 00:07:22,413
our daughter's most recent
E.E.G. showed brain spikes,

148
00:07:22,728 --> 00:07:25,740
but it didn't change the
score on the glasgow scale.

149
00:07:26,548 --> 00:07:27,793
Why is that?

150
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:31,443
What an excellent question.

151
00:07:33,867 --> 00:07:38,360
And this is the, uh... spinal cord.

152
00:07:38,477 --> 00:07:42,272
And it, of course,
attaches to the brain.

153
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,710
You don't have to dumb
it down for us, doctor.

154
00:07:44,748 --> 00:07:46,773
We've been dealing with
Jane's condition for years.

155
00:07:46,807 --> 00:07:47,721
Oh, good.

156
00:07:47,766 --> 00:07:52,110
Um, well, then let's,
let's get technical.

157
00:07:52,145 --> 00:07:53,702
Uh, let's give Dr. Mayer the night off.

158
00:07:53,725 --> 00:07:57,621
She was in surgery for ten hours
today performing a craniotomy.

159
00:07:57,648 --> 00:07:59,932
That's exactly the procedure Jane had.

160
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,870
How'd it go?

161
00:08:02,928 --> 00:08:07,161
Uh, well, it just... Wow!

162
00:08:08,685 --> 00:08:11,112
I hear my, my phone vibrating.

163
00:08:11,855 --> 00:08:15,663
Um, hello, uh, Dr. Mayer.

164
00:08:15,857 --> 00:08:17,123
Yeah, what?

165
00:08:17,156 --> 00:08:19,940
You say that his brain shut off?

166
00:08:19,978 --> 00:08:21,521
Oh, well, I'll be right there.

167
00:08:21,546 --> 00:08:22,793
Um, stat.

168
00:08:23,206 --> 00:08:24,490
I'm sorry.

169
00:08:24,658 --> 00:08:26,242
Duty calls.

170
00:08:31,705 --> 00:08:32,773
Orson?

171
00:08:32,807 --> 00:08:35,513
I moved the furniture back!

172
00:08:36,105 --> 00:08:38,562
Good lord, Bree, not again.

173
00:08:43,746 --> 00:08:46,462
Don't you want our first
dance to be perfect?

174
00:08:46,506 --> 00:08:49,993
There'll be 200 people staring at us.

175
00:08:52,945 --> 00:08:54,980
You know, Bree...

176
00:08:55,366 --> 00:08:59,390
Since that incident at our engagement party,
there's been a lot of dark talk about me.

177
00:08:59,417 --> 00:09:01,553
Well, I don't pay attention to gossip.

178
00:09:01,587 --> 00:09:06,630
I'm just saying I would understand
if you had second thoughts about
marrying a man who's under a cloud.

179
00:09:08,498 --> 00:09:12,272
Well, no one who knows you could seriously
believe that you could hurt a woman.

180
00:09:12,306 --> 00:09:16,101
Strangers may talk,
but I know the truth.

181
00:09:16,277 --> 00:09:17,913
Really?

182
00:09:18,807 --> 00:09:20,790
Men have lied to me before.

183
00:09:20,825 --> 00:09:24,883
Believe me, that'll never happen again.

184
00:09:25,128 --> 00:09:28,021
So you trust me completely?

185
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,953
Clearly, I do.

186
00:09:35,398 --> 00:09:39,683
The body is unusually well-preserved
because it was buried in clay.

187
00:09:39,716 --> 00:09:41,501
Do we have a cause of death?

188
00:09:41,535 --> 00:09:44,492
Blunt  force trauma to the head.

189
00:09:44,837 --> 00:09:49,233
I want you to pull all the missing
persons reports, cross-check against
her height, age and weight.

190
00:09:49,266 --> 00:09:54,003
I'm also running a D.N.A. panel since we
won't be able to use her dental records.

191
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:55,082
Why not?

192
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:58,471
Whoever killed her
pulled out all her teeth.

193
00:10:07,787 --> 00:10:08,960
Nora?

194
00:10:08,988 --> 00:10:10,183
What are you doing back?

195
00:10:10,226 --> 00:10:11,292
Are you okay?

196
00:10:11,305 --> 00:10:13,341
Shut the door!

197
00:10:14,316 --> 00:10:16,822
I don't want kayla to find me like this.

198
00:10:16,868 --> 00:10:18,410
What's wrong?

199
00:10:18,438 --> 00:10:20,252
Tuck and I had a fight.

200
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,211
What?

201
00:10:21,248 --> 00:10:22,072
No!

202
00:10:22,106 --> 00:10:24,153
No, no, no!

203
00:10:24,235 --> 00:10:24,852
What happened?

204
00:10:24,886 --> 00:10:27,171
What happened is, Turk is an ass!

205
00:10:27,225 --> 00:10:30,012
On the way to the river, we stoped off
at is bar. Then we were paying pool,

206
00:10:30,037 --> 00:10:32,753
and I got a little bitchy with one of
the waitresses. So who cares, right?

207
00:10:32,776 --> 00:10:36,051
I mean, who cares? It's a bar,
and we all do it, right?

208
00:10:36,116 --> 00:10:36,993
R... Right.

209
00:10:37,085 --> 00:10:40,060
So he tells me to watch my mouth.

210
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:42,072
And I'm like, whoa!

211
00:10:42,447 --> 00:10:46,073
Get a load a Mr. Two Strikes trying
to tell me how to act in public.

212
00:10:46,098 --> 00:10:48,632
And  then he called me a whore.

213
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,881
We're done.

214
00:10:49,926 --> 00:10:51,130
Okay, whoa!

215
00:10:51,155 --> 00:10:51,872
Take a deep breath.

216
00:10:51,897 --> 00:10:57,282
You don't break up with a guy because in
a weak moment he calls you a whore.

217
00:10:57,316 --> 00:11:00,910
And then on the way out,
he threatened to hit me.

218
00:11:01,757 --> 00:11:03,391
Okay, but he didn't.

219
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:06,022
-And, you know, until...
-Oh, jeez, Lynette, whose side are you on?!

220
00:11:06,056 --> 00:11:08,291
I'm on the side of love.

221
00:11:08,316 --> 00:11:10,941
You  guys seem like
such a perfect couple.

222
00:11:10,966 --> 00:11:11,960
I know.

223
00:11:11,996 --> 00:11:13,202
I just, I...

224
00:11:13,238 --> 00:11:19,243
You know, you don't wanna throw that all
away 'cause of a little fight with no hitting.

225
00:11:20,975 --> 00:11:22,063
No.

226
00:11:22,378 --> 00:11:23,502
It's over.

227
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:29,341
I just got off the phone with Turk's
parole officer, and I was like,

228
00:11:29,486 --> 00:11:31,672
"Guess who ain't in Nevada no more"?

229
00:11:31,935 --> 00:11:33,331
Click.

230
00:11:41,395 --> 00:11:44,790
I think I'm gonna have
to stay here tonight.

231
00:12:10,676 --> 00:12:12,863
Freeze!

232
00:12:15,817 --> 00:12:17,361
Austin?

233
00:12:20,937 --> 00:12:21,941
Anyway...

234
00:12:21,985 --> 00:12:27,033
Mom just got backfrom her cruise to Jamaica
with new boobs and a 24-year-old cabin boy.

235
00:12:27,078 --> 00:12:31,160
Needless to say, me and Mr.
"Can I get yousome more hot towels?",

236
00:12:31,197 --> 00:12:32,720
we didn't exactly hit it off.

237
00:12:32,977 --> 00:12:36,481
So after I broke his nose, I figured it was
great time to come visit my favorite Aunt.

238
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,982
Your mom always did
have lousy taste in men.

239
00:12:39,016 --> 00:12:42,320
So, I figured I'd crash here for the night.

240
00:12:42,357 --> 00:12:44,801
Then itch down to Mexico.
Hang out, party.

241
00:12:44,825 --> 00:12:48,663
Yeah, I'm thinking,
like, no way in hell.

242
00:12:48,677 --> 00:12:52,213
You're gonna stay here with me until
things blow over with your mom, okay?

243
00:12:52,246 --> 00:12:52,891
Cool.

244
00:12:52,917 --> 00:12:54,310
Thanks.

245
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:58,901
Oh, wait, you're 18, right?

246
00:12:59,015 --> 00:13:01,221
Well that's what my I.D. says.

247
00:13:01,256 --> 00:13:03,680
Yeah, mine, too.

248
00:13:13,357 --> 00:13:15,332
You were supposed to be on bed rest.

249
00:13:15,597 --> 00:13:16,603
I'm bored.

250
00:13:16,965 --> 00:13:20,611
Well, why don't you try putting a pair of
pants? That should kill a couple of hours.

251
00:13:27,117 --> 00:13:27,902
Hey, babe.

252
00:13:29,197 --> 00:13:32,271
What is she doing out bed?
That can't be good for her.

253
00:13:32,606 --> 00:13:34,413
Or the stairs.

254
00:13:35,087 --> 00:13:36,292
What do you want?

255
00:13:36,328 --> 00:13:38,350
The mediator was right.

256
00:13:38,557 --> 00:13:40,633
A month from now we're not just
gonna be Carlos and Gaby.

257
00:13:40,655 --> 00:13:45,771
We're gonna be mom and dad, and I don't
wanna be at war with the mother of my child.

258
00:13:46,227 --> 00:13:47,361
So, here.

259
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:50,843
Your Mama's pearls?

260
00:13:50,898 --> 00:13:51,840
Carlos...

261
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:55,753
Thank you.

262
00:13:56,157 --> 00:13:57,211
And...?

263
00:13:57,807 --> 00:13:58,663
And what?

264
00:13:59,156 --> 00:14:02,332
Wouldn't you like to make
some reciprocal gesture?

265
00:14:02,978 --> 00:14:03,972
Fine.

266
00:14:03,996 --> 00:14:07,410
You can come to Bree's
wedding reception as my guest.

267
00:14:07,437 --> 00:14:08,283
Thanks.

268
00:14:08,645 --> 00:14:10,083
-Here.
-Here?

269
00:14:10,747 --> 00:14:12,511
You're throwing a... reception?

270
00:14:12,566 --> 00:14:14,270
Yeah, that's our wedding present to Bree.

271
00:14:14,308 --> 00:14:17,081
So I give you a priceless family
heirloom, and in return,

272
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:19,883
you invite me to a party at
my house that I'm paying for?

273
00:14:20,097 --> 00:14:23,293
Well, what kind of gesture
did you have in mind?

274
00:14:29,387 --> 00:14:31,452
Things I'll do for jewelry.

275
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:39,250
Susan, I am so sorry.

276
00:14:39,286 --> 00:14:40,782
Dr. Mayer?

277
00:14:40,818 --> 00:14:41,880
Panic.

278
00:14:42,037 --> 00:14:43,882
Pure panic.

279
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:44,950
Here.

280
00:14:44,987 --> 00:14:47,441
These are for ruining our first date.

281
00:14:47,817 --> 00:14:49,452
Not in front of Mike!

282
00:14:49,476 --> 00:14:52,682
Oh, look, Mike, Ian brought you flowers.

283
00:14:52,707 --> 00:14:55,502
I'll just go put them in some water.

284
00:14:59,495 --> 00:15:02,211
Look, I was just trying
to protect Jane's parents.

285
00:15:02,237 --> 00:15:03,371
Oh, please.

286
00:15:03,418 --> 00:15:07,191
They still haven't accepted the fact
that Jane isn't going to wake up.

287
00:15:07,217 --> 00:15:12,121
If they knew that we were on a date,
that I was trying to move on, well,
it would devastate them.

288
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:15,250
That a really lovely excuse, but
it isn't the whole story, isn't it?

289
00:15:15,288 --> 00:15:16,200
Excuse me?

290
00:15:16,225 --> 00:15:18,673
A part of you feels that
you're cheating on her.

291
00:15:18,695 --> 00:15:22,542
No. Well, perhaps a small part,
but that doesn't mean...

292
00:15:22,565 --> 00:15:25,461
It's all right, 'cause I feel guilty, too.

293
00:15:25,537 --> 00:15:29,163
That's why we should just stop is right now,
because it's all way too complicated,

294
00:15:29,205 --> 00:15:34,321
And I think we'd both be happier if
we just went back to being friends.

295
00:15:35,687 --> 00:15:38,713
Well, I don't think I can do that.

296
00:15:39,747 --> 00:15:43,830
The truth is, I haven't thought of you
as just a friend for some time now.

297
00:15:43,857 --> 00:15:47,521
Maybe I shouldn't have let
myself feel that way, but I have.

298
00:15:47,566 --> 00:15:50,262
I can't go back, I'm sorry.

299
00:15:53,028 --> 00:15:56,732
Well, if we can't be friends...

300
00:15:57,876 --> 00:15:59,731
Then I guess we'll be nothing.

301
00:16:30,765 --> 00:16:32,961
Hey, leave that alone.

302
00:16:32,995 --> 00:16:35,621
Sorry, I was just...

303
00:16:37,327 --> 00:16:39,471
Turning it down.

304
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:42,703
What, you're not a music fan?

305
00:16:42,745 --> 00:16:44,072
Sure, it's just, um...

306
00:16:44,107 --> 00:16:47,143
Got anything where a pimp
isn't beating his ho?

307
00:16:49,205 --> 00:16:52,383
I'm Austin, Edie Britt's nephew.

308
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,772
I'm Julie, Susan Mayer's daughter.

309
00:16:57,878 --> 00:17:00,680
Anyway, um, I was trying
to do my homework, so...

310
00:17:00,726 --> 00:17:01,952
On a Saturday?

311
00:17:02,547 --> 00:17:07,753
Well, make sure and take regular
breaks and stop for a sensible dinner.

312
00:17:08,507 --> 00:17:09,641
Just keep it down.

313
00:17:09,677 --> 00:17:11,322
You had it really loud.

314
00:17:11,368 --> 00:17:13,572
That's how I like it.

315
00:17:14,418 --> 00:17:16,200
How do you like it?

316
00:17:18,098 --> 00:17:22,042
You know what?
You're not that hot.

317
00:17:32,055 --> 00:17:33,143
Hey, what are you doing?

318
00:17:33,165 --> 00:17:35,073
Oh, I'm working on a seating chart.

319
00:17:35,107 --> 00:17:36,481
For Bree's wedding.

320
00:17:36,776 --> 00:17:38,470
Nora? Who invited her?

321
00:17:38,498 --> 00:17:39,223
I did.

322
00:17:39,246 --> 00:17:44,140
We need to find her another boyfriend,
and weddings are crawling with single men.

323
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:46,963
Hey, I hope you're not seating
her next to any of my friends.

324
00:17:46,995 --> 00:17:49,083
Hey, sacrifices must be made, Tom.

325
00:17:49,217 --> 00:17:50,161
No, Jerry Rawlings!

326
00:17:50,198 --> 00:17:51,192
Not Jerry Rawlings!

327
00:17:51,216 --> 00:17:54,211
If she gets her psycho hooks in Jerry
Rawings, he will never speak to me again.

328
00:17:54,245 --> 00:17:56,451
Oh, there are other urologists in the world.

329
00:17:56,477 --> 00:17:58,121
Go back to that other guy.

330
00:17:58,148 --> 00:17:59,201
The one with the cold hands?

331
00:17:59,237 --> 00:18:01,213
Oh, it's once a year. Suck it up.

332
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:03,182
Get a grip, Lynette.

333
00:18:03,218 --> 00:18:05,631
"Get a grip"?!

334
00:18:05,677 --> 00:18:08,190
I am hanging on for dear life here.

335
00:18:08,206 --> 00:18:12,652
You are the one that brought
this little problem into our family,

336
00:18:12,677 --> 00:18:17,832
And the only thing I should be hearing
from you is, "how can I help"?

337
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:23,280
I am also putting Stevie Handson at
her table, so you might want to start
shopping around for a new golf buddy.

338
00:18:27,526 --> 00:18:28,710
Get a grip.

339
00:19:06,497 --> 00:19:07,332
Hi.

340
00:19:07,365 --> 00:19:08,481
My name is Susan Mayer.

341
00:19:08,518 --> 00:19:10,412
Your neighbor told me
I could find you here.

342
00:19:10,448 --> 00:19:10,993
Yeah?

343
00:19:11,258 --> 00:19:14,142
Well, I was at my friend Bree's
engagement party the other night.

344
00:19:14,177 --> 00:19:19,602
You know, when you came in and you did
that whole "Orson killed his wife" thing?

345
00:19:19,637 --> 00:19:22,623
I was just wondering
if you could elaborate.

346
00:19:22,655 --> 00:19:23,781
He killed her.

347
00:19:23,816 --> 00:19:25,022
What else do you need to know?

348
00:19:25,056 --> 00:19:29,663
Well, what makes you so sure?
Do you have any proof?

349
00:19:31,887 --> 00:19:32,973
Look, I can't talk now.

350
00:19:32,995 --> 00:19:36,723
-I get off at 6:00.
-My friend is marring that men in two hours.

351
00:19:36,757 --> 00:19:38,792
Please?

352
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:45,893
Okay, I need $10 in unroled pennies
and I need to see you count it,

353
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:48,862
'cause last time you sttif me!

354
00:19:52,947 --> 00:19:56,513
After Alma disappeared, the police
came and searched the house.

355
00:19:56,555 --> 00:19:57,500
The police?

356
00:19:57,538 --> 00:20:00,543
-What did they find?
-Nothing.

357
00:20:01,716 --> 00:20:03,330
And that's bad, why?

358
00:20:03,347 --> 00:20:04,512
Don't you get it?

359
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:10,392
When the police showed up, Orson had scrubbed
every inch of the place clean with blich.

360
00:20:10,428 --> 00:20:13,320
No fingerprints,
no skin cells, no D.N.A.

361
00:20:13,356 --> 00:20:16,400
It was like Alma had never existed.

362
00:20:17,478 --> 00:20:21,792
Who cleans a house like that
unless he has something to hide?

363
00:20:28,415 --> 00:20:29,261
So when I left the bank,

364
00:20:29,287 --> 00:20:31,402
I called the detective
that worked the case,

365
00:20:31,437 --> 00:20:36,523
And he said that the only reason
Orson was never charged was
because they never found the body.

366
00:20:36,546 --> 00:20:37,873
So he was an actual suspect?

367
00:20:37,895 --> 00:20:41,420
-He was the only suspect.
-Oh, my God! What are we gonna do?

368
00:20:41,457 --> 00:20:43,663
Well, you know
what we have to do.

369
00:20:45,805 --> 00:20:47,020
That was close.

370
00:20:47,055 --> 00:20:49,342
The florist put three mums
in my bridal bouquet,

371
00:20:49,376 --> 00:20:50,953
but not to worry.

372
00:20:50,986 --> 00:20:52,170
Crisis averted.

373
00:20:52,215 --> 00:20:56,250
Bree... we have to talk.

374
00:21:04,445 --> 00:21:05,671
Ah, Reverend.

375
00:21:05,705 --> 00:21:07,420
Any word from the bridal party?

376
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:09,502
They're still in the bride's
room. You know women.

377
00:21:09,536 --> 00:21:12,450
They're probably in there
fussing about mascara and blush.

378
00:21:12,517 --> 00:21:15,761
He did not hack her up and
dissolve the pieces in acid!

379
00:21:15,795 --> 00:21:17,113
I  said it was a theory.

380
00:21:17,127 --> 00:21:20,181
The point is, Alma disappeared under
very suspicious circumstances.

381
00:21:20,217 --> 00:21:22,380
I don't have time for this.
I'm getting married now.

382
00:21:22,408 --> 00:21:24,882
This is your day. You can push
the ceremony back an hour.

383
00:21:24,905 --> 00:21:26,481
Now get that detective
on the phone,

384
00:21:26,517 --> 00:21:28,113
talk things out with Orson.

385
00:21:28,145 --> 00:21:29,813
I can't talk to Orson.

386
00:21:29,846 --> 00:21:33,012
It's bad luck for the groom to see
the bride before the wedding.

387
00:21:33,035 --> 00:21:36,302
You know what's really bad luck?
Marrying a wife-killer.

388
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:39,610
If the three of you don't
drop this right now,

389
00:21:39,648 --> 00:21:41,020
I will never forgive you.

390
00:21:41,058 --> 00:21:44,362
Bree, we are just doing this
because we love you.

391
00:21:46,037 --> 00:21:47,522
But...

392
00:21:47,646 --> 00:21:52,032
If you can honestly tell us that
you don't have the slightest doubt...

393
00:21:52,128 --> 00:21:55,133
None whatsoever.

394
00:22:59,876 --> 00:23:03,390
Dearly beloved, we are gathered
here together in the sight of God,

395
00:23:03,418 --> 00:23:08,112
-to join this man and woman in holy...
-Excuse me?

396
00:23:08,135 --> 00:23:10,561
Could you give us
just a second?

397
00:23:10,907 --> 00:23:13,891
-Is something wrong?
-I just need a moment.

398
00:23:19,797 --> 00:23:23,141
Before we do this, there's
something I need to ask you.

399
00:23:23,246 --> 00:23:24,630
What?

400
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:27,682
Did you kill your wife?

401
00:23:27,845 --> 00:23:29,781
Susan talked to that Carolyn woman.

402
00:23:29,807 --> 00:23:32,833
Why didn't you tell me that the
police seached your house.

403
00:23:32,867 --> 00:23:36,883
Because it's embarrassing,
and they didn't find anything.

404
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,953
Is that because you scrubbed
the house so thoroughly?

405
00:23:39,978 --> 00:23:43,022
When I'm upset, I clean.

406
00:23:46,606 --> 00:23:47,672
For God's sake, Bree,

407
00:23:47,707 --> 00:23:52,703
I swear to you
I did not kill my wife.

408
00:23:56,457 --> 00:23:57,821
Okay.

409
00:24:02,878 --> 00:24:04,493
Proceed.

410
00:24:06,048 --> 00:24:07,092
Dearly beloved,

411
00:24:07,117 --> 00:24:10,752
We are gathered here
together in the sight of God,

412
00:24:10,785 --> 00:24:14,392
to join this man and woman
in holy matrimony,

413
00:24:14,436 --> 00:24:16,202
which is an honorable estate...

414
00:24:39,997 --> 00:24:42,593
Hey! Look at you, miss popular!

415
00:24:42,627 --> 00:24:44,572
So are you having
a good time over there?

416
00:24:44,585 --> 00:24:45,910
As if,

417
00:24:45,927 --> 00:24:48,933
And I don't know what idiot
stuck me at that table,

418
00:24:48,947 --> 00:24:52,111
But every guy over there
is just a boring stiff.

419
00:24:52,128 --> 00:24:53,281
All of them?

420
00:24:53,315 --> 00:24:57,072
What about... Jerry?
Jerry's fun.

421
00:24:57,517 --> 00:25:01,170
You mean Mr. Fatty hair plugs?
Oh, yeah, he's a blast.

422
00:25:03,597 --> 00:25:05,420
Um, how about Steve?

423
00:25:05,475 --> 00:25:07,922
You know what?
I hear his family has money.

424
00:25:07,955 --> 00:25:11,903
Well, then maybe they could all chip
in and buy him some deodorant.

425
00:25:11,947 --> 00:25:13,053
I'm through with those losers.

426
00:25:13,096 --> 00:25:15,663
I'm gonna stay
right here with you.

427
00:25:16,447 --> 00:25:18,403
Are you gonna eat that?

428
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:23,703
Hey, look at you!

429
00:25:23,988 --> 00:25:25,651
God, I hate wearing a tux.

430
00:25:25,798 --> 00:25:28,503
On my way in, Bree's Aunt Fern
asked me to park the car.

431
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:29,952
She's got glaucoma.

432
00:25:29,977 --> 00:25:32,662
To her, you're nothing
but a hispanic blur.

433
00:25:32,775 --> 00:25:34,740
Let me fix your tie.

434
00:25:35,987 --> 00:25:38,160
Hey, you're wearing
Mama's pearls.

435
00:25:38,195 --> 00:25:39,372
Yeah.

436
00:25:46,697 --> 00:25:48,131
Hey, Julie!

437
00:25:48,167 --> 00:25:50,303
Have you met
my nephew Austin?

438
00:25:50,337 --> 00:25:51,151
Yeah, we've met.

439
00:25:51,165 --> 00:25:54,030
I just didn't recognize
him with his shirt on.

440
00:25:57,857 --> 00:25:59,863
She couldn't take
her eyes off my abs.

441
00:25:59,887 --> 00:26:01,821
I felt violated.

442
00:26:06,395 --> 00:26:08,380
Hi, Edie.
Nice party, huh?

443
00:26:08,408 --> 00:26:09,900
It was.

444
00:26:13,557 --> 00:26:14,563
Perfect.

445
00:26:14,598 --> 00:26:17,330
Well, it's nice to see you
two getting along again.

446
00:26:17,366 --> 00:26:19,761
We've sort of turned a corner. Really?

447
00:26:19,777 --> 00:26:21,633
Does that mean you're gonna
be getting back together?

448
00:26:21,657 --> 00:26:23,242
-Maybe.
-God, no!

449
00:26:26,155 --> 00:26:28,401
Wow, is that shrimp?

450
00:26:29,135 --> 00:26:32,231
What would make you think I would
even consider taking you back?

451
00:26:32,267 --> 00:26:34,201
Well, you invited me
to be your date.

452
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:35,813
"Guest," Carlos. I said "guest."

453
00:26:35,828 --> 00:26:37,581
Come on, you've been flirting
with me since I came in...

454
00:26:37,606 --> 00:26:39,070
"Here, baby, let me fix your tie."

455
00:26:39,096 --> 00:26:40,431
I mean, for a woman
who's not interested,

456
00:26:40,448 --> 00:26:42,090
you sure are sending
some mixed signals.

457
00:26:42,125 --> 00:26:44,601
You want a clear
signal? How's this?

458
00:26:48,968 --> 00:26:50,411
-Ian!
-Susan!

459
00:26:50,758 --> 00:26:52,372
What are you doing here?

460
00:26:52,656 --> 00:26:55,941
Well, my cousin is Dr.
Hodges' dental hygienist,

461
00:26:55,985 --> 00:26:57,383
and her husband...
He couldn't join us

462
00:26:57,407 --> 00:27:00,523
since he'd come down with
a spot of impetigo, so she called me,

463
00:27:00,915 --> 00:27:03,053
Knowing how much I love
a good garter toss, and so...

464
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:04,033
Ian.

465
00:27:04,897 --> 00:27:07,521
Yes, I'm such
a terrible liar.

466
00:27:08,508 --> 00:27:10,951
Impetigo, where did
that come from?

467
00:27:12,258 --> 00:27:13,871
So what are you really
doing here?

468
00:27:15,836 --> 00:27:16,670
Look...

469
00:27:17,655 --> 00:27:20,941
I can't stop thinking about us,

470
00:27:20,968 --> 00:27:22,622
about how great
we could be together,

471
00:27:22,656 --> 00:27:24,833
and I think you're making a mistake.

472
00:27:24,867 --> 00:27:27,053
-Ian...
-Susan, please don't go.

473
00:27:27,077 --> 00:27:28,821
Can't we at least
talk about this?

474
00:27:28,845 --> 00:27:32,703
I can't, 'cause I have...
bridesmaid stuff.

475
00:27:37,097 --> 00:27:38,040
HI there.

476
00:27:38,248 --> 00:27:40,461
I just wanted to say
you're doing a great job...

477
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,113
Tad.

478
00:27:42,665 --> 00:27:45,603
That's, um, that's such
a masculine name.

479
00:27:46,028 --> 00:27:47,953
My boyfriend
seems to like it.

480
00:27:48,946 --> 00:27:50,132
Okay, here's the drill.

481
00:27:50,217 --> 00:27:53,160
My ex is here, and I wanna piss him off,
so just act like you're all hot for me,

482
00:27:53,187 --> 00:27:54,823
and there's a 100 buck
tip in it for you.

483
00:27:55,107 --> 00:27:58,432
Right. Uh, so should
I... cup your boob?

484
00:27:58,517 --> 00:27:59,480
No, I'll drive.

485
00:28:10,797 --> 00:28:12,323
Tequila, straight.

486
00:28:15,116 --> 00:28:17,912
Hey, are there any decent
single women athis wedding?

487
00:28:18,535 --> 00:28:19,891
Not that I've seen.

488
00:28:20,738 --> 00:28:22,980
Ah, damn it. Not a one.

489
00:28:25,676 --> 00:28:26,730
Hey, Carlos.

490
00:28:27,027 --> 00:28:30,423
You should come over to our table.
That's where all the hotties are.

491
00:28:30,587 --> 00:28:31,233
Hey, everyone!

492
00:28:31,245 --> 00:28:34,232
I'd say it is time that we get
Bree and Orson up here

493
00:28:34,248 --> 00:28:36,511
for their first dance
as a married couple.

494
00:28:36,545 --> 00:28:42,630
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you
Mr. and Mrs. Orson Hodge!

495
00:29:03,525 --> 00:29:05,331
Orson,
you look so serious.

496
00:29:05,405 --> 00:29:07,480
I'm trying to remember my steps.

497
00:29:11,677 --> 00:29:13,153
You're upset, aren't you?

498
00:29:13,356 --> 00:29:15,633
You're still thinking about
what I said at the church.

499
00:29:16,226 --> 00:29:17,051
Which part, darling?

500
00:29:17,076 --> 00:29:20,442
The "I do" part, or the "did
you kill your wife?" part?

501
00:29:22,416 --> 00:29:24,463
I'm sorry, but I had to ask.

502
00:29:25,266 --> 00:29:26,601
That's my point.

503
00:29:27,086 --> 00:29:28,371
You had to ask.

504
00:29:37,266 --> 00:29:39,592
You are gonna
rot in hell for this.

505
00:29:40,155 --> 00:29:42,751
Hey, I just brought
two lost souls together.

506
00:29:45,937 --> 00:29:48,443
Okay, how about this?
He cheated on my friend.

507
00:29:49,207 --> 00:29:54,111
He deserves every bit of... crazy.
She's gonna rain down on him.

508
00:29:56,978 --> 00:30:00,200
Hell... rot... you.

509
00:30:09,355 --> 00:30:11,362
What are they doing?

510
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:17,632
Rounding second
and heading for third.

511
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:23,613
Carlos!

512
00:30:23,998 --> 00:30:25,832
Oh, hey, Gaby.
Look, I made a new friend.

513
00:30:25,856 --> 00:30:29,182
Yes, I've been watching you make
your new friend, and it's disgusting!

514
00:30:29,407 --> 00:30:31,291
Do you mind?
We're trying to dance here.

515
00:30:31,367 --> 00:30:32,800
Who the hell are you, anyway,

516
00:30:32,837 --> 00:30:35,142
and why the hell are
you at this wedding?!

517
00:30:36,316 --> 00:30:38,420
This is not gonna end well.

518
00:30:39,068 --> 00:30:41,412
They're just two random people
who met at a wedding.

519
00:30:41,868 --> 00:30:43,382
Can't pin it on.

520
00:30:44,466 --> 00:30:46,131
It was her!

521
00:30:46,967 --> 00:30:49,293
Lynette Scavo,
I wanna talk to you!

522
00:30:51,265 --> 00:30:52,232
I'll see you at home.

523
00:30:54,058 --> 00:30:54,791
What are you thinking?

524
00:30:54,828 --> 00:30:57,930
I didn't invite you here to embarrass
me in front of my friends.

525
00:30:57,955 --> 00:31:02,542
Oh, no, you just wanted me to watch while
you sucked the zits off some teenage waiter!

526
00:31:02,587 --> 00:31:04,753
That's it. I take my invitation back.

527
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:06,810
You are no longer welcome
in my house.

528
00:31:06,868 --> 00:31:09,782
Fine, I'll go!
Just give me back the pearls.

529
00:31:09,837 --> 00:31:11,652
-No!
-Gaby...

530
00:31:11,687 --> 00:31:13,782
-Carlos, no!
-They were my Mama's!

531
00:31:13,828 --> 00:31:14,513
No!

532
00:31:16,987 --> 00:31:18,541
Now look what you've done!

533
00:31:20,157 --> 00:31:21,373
Mrs. Solis!

534
00:31:21,455 --> 00:31:23,002
-No, Carlos!
-Hey, give me that!

535
00:31:23,227 --> 00:31:25,361
-Give me those!
-Pardon me. Excuse me.

536
00:31:25,406 --> 00:31:27,721
-Get away! Those are mine!
-No, the hell they are!

537
00:31:27,755 --> 00:31:28,763
Mrs. Solis?

538
00:31:28,785 --> 00:31:31,001
-Not now, Xiao-Mei!
-Mrs. Solis!

539
00:31:31,048 --> 00:31:32,712
Oh, for God sakes, what?!

540
00:31:43,188 --> 00:31:46,461
I think maybe it's time.

541
00:31:47,787 --> 00:31:52,243
And I wish you both
a lifetime of happiness.

542
00:31:56,527 --> 00:31:58,712
That was beautiful,
Aunt Fern. Thank you.

543
00:31:58,965 --> 00:32:01,433
Hey, they mopped up
all the amniotic fluid,

544
00:32:01,445 --> 00:32:04,200
so we should feel safe
start the conga line!

545
00:32:04,258 --> 00:32:06,733
Actually, I'd like to
say a few words.

546
00:32:11,656 --> 00:32:13,532
Bree, Orson,

547
00:32:13,735 --> 00:32:16,661
Your love is an inspiration to us all.

548
00:32:18,565 --> 00:32:20,043
-That's very sweet.
-Hmm.

549
00:32:20,065 --> 00:32:21,263
How do you know him?

550
00:32:21,286 --> 00:32:22,881
I thought he was on your side.

551
00:32:23,636 --> 00:32:25,572
Well, I know, this is a second
wedding for both of you,

552
00:32:25,616 --> 00:32:27,930
and I think you're jolly brave.

553
00:32:28,425 --> 00:32:31,333
So often, people find excuses
not to fall in love again.

554
00:32:31,348 --> 00:32:32,761
They're, they're afraid.

555
00:32:33,835 --> 00:32:36,370
But it's rare to find somebody
that you connect with,

556
00:32:36,406 --> 00:32:39,942
so when you do, you have
to follow your heart.

557
00:32:40,025 --> 00:32:41,210
Bree, Orson,

558
00:32:42,528 --> 00:32:43,632
I salute you.

559
00:32:45,137 --> 00:32:47,433
All right, let's get the
music cranking and the...

560
00:32:47,446 --> 00:32:49,571
Actually, Tom, could you
just hang on a second?

561
00:32:49,608 --> 00:32:52,620
Uh, I also would like
to say a few words.

562
00:32:53,265 --> 00:32:55,751
To Bree and Orson, uh, yes,

563
00:32:55,777 --> 00:32:57,592
what could be better
than a second love?

564
00:32:58,095 --> 00:33:01,390
And this time you enter into it
a little older, little wiser,

565
00:33:01,428 --> 00:33:02,573
but also,

566
00:33:02,908 --> 00:33:04,412
and this is key, uh...

567
00:33:04,956 --> 00:33:06,261
with a bit of caution.

568
00:33:08,077 --> 00:33:09,351
Because...

569
00:33:09,608 --> 00:33:12,900
while love can be
spontaneous and wonderful,

570
00:33:13,627 --> 00:33:16,220
it can also be selfish.

571
00:33:16,526 --> 00:33:17,822
And sometimes,

572
00:33:18,158 --> 00:33:20,730
the best thing you can do
is just to walk away.

573
00:33:26,286 --> 00:33:27,830
Uh... Not you two.

574
00:33:27,877 --> 00:33:30,222
I mean, you two
crazy kids are great.

575
00:33:30,865 --> 00:33:32,041
Congrats, yeah.

576
00:33:32,645 --> 00:33:33,830
Well, then, let's...

577
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:36,041
Hang on. I'd like
to respond to that toast.

578
00:33:36,746 --> 00:33:38,810
Bree, Orson,

579
00:33:39,237 --> 00:33:41,843
sometimes walking away
can seem the best choice.

580
00:33:41,897 --> 00:33:43,941
It's certainly
the safest. But...

581
00:33:45,128 --> 00:33:47,952
But what do you do when you find
someone who makes you feel joy,

582
00:33:47,976 --> 00:33:49,872
when you thought you
never would again?

583
00:33:51,636 --> 00:33:53,340
Do you, do you just let them go?

584
00:33:56,547 --> 00:33:57,212
No.

585
00:33:59,156 --> 00:34:00,461
No, I can't do that.

586
00:34:12,976 --> 00:34:13,991
You, you wanna...

587
00:34:16,277 --> 00:34:17,051
No.

588
00:34:18,328 --> 00:34:19,221
I'm good.

589
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:22,273
All right then, let's dance!

590
00:34:37,068 --> 00:34:39,042
Well, I thought you might
need a change of clothes.

591
00:34:41,495 --> 00:34:43,082
You're still mad at me, huh?

592
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:46,402
What were you thinking,
setting Carlos up with skank?!

593
00:34:46,435 --> 00:34:48,963
I'm sorry.
I was desperate.

594
00:34:49,425 --> 00:34:51,041
I had a little too much to drink.

595
00:34:51,165 --> 00:34:52,812
And you are divorcing Carlos...

596
00:34:52,845 --> 00:34:55,213
No, Lynette, Carlos will
never be fair game.

597
00:34:55,256 --> 00:34:56,430
You know the rules.

598
00:34:56,467 --> 00:34:59,071
You're right.
You are right. You're right.

599
00:34:59,365 --> 00:35:00,713
I'm so sorry.

600
00:35:02,447 --> 00:35:03,713
It's just...

601
00:35:06,346 --> 00:35:06,872
What?

602
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,760
I'm so unhappy.

603
00:35:11,266 --> 00:35:14,192
Ever since that woman
pushed her way into our lives,

604
00:35:14,226 --> 00:35:16,702
I can't even
wo up a smile.

605
00:35:16,926 --> 00:35:19,352
And the more she pushes,
the more I resent Tom.

606
00:35:19,508 --> 00:35:22,170
Tom, for something
he did 12 years ago.

607
00:35:22,425 --> 00:35:25,083
And I'm afraid
if I can't fix...

608
00:35:25,327 --> 00:35:26,641
this, that...

609
00:35:27,448 --> 00:35:29,752
The anger is just gonna
fester until...

610
00:35:29,788 --> 00:35:31,060
Lynette, listen to me.

611
00:35:32,437 --> 00:35:34,383
You and Tom
will survive this.

612
00:35:34,648 --> 00:35:39,330
No, seriously, Gaby, I am so
tired of pretending to smile.

613
00:35:39,456 --> 00:35:43,083
You and Tom...
will survive this.

614
00:35:43,438 --> 00:35:44,283
Yeah?

615
00:35:45,035 --> 00:35:46,300
How can you be so sure?

616
00:35:46,745 --> 00:35:49,581
Because some marriages
were built to last...

617
00:35:51,495 --> 00:35:53,423
And some aren't.

618
00:35:57,466 --> 00:35:59,880
Trust me,
I know the difference.

619
00:36:07,778 --> 00:36:09,282
I'm looking for Bree Van De Kamp.

620
00:36:12,848 --> 00:36:14,710
Could you excuse me
for just a minute?

621
00:36:17,516 --> 00:36:19,130
Orson, congratulations.

622
00:36:21,177 --> 00:36:23,970
Excuse me. Are you
Mrs. Van De Kamp?

623
00:36:24,127 --> 00:36:25,641
It's Hodge now.

624
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:28,770
Yes, I'm terribly sorry
to barge in like this,

625
00:36:28,798 --> 00:36:31,060
but we need your husband
to come down to the morgue.

626
00:36:31,287 --> 00:36:33,193
We may have found
his wife's body.

627
00:36:45,277 --> 00:36:46,873
Push, Xiao-Mei. Push.

628
00:36:49,816 --> 00:36:50,463
Okay, okay.

629
00:36:50,497 --> 00:36:52,382
Deep breaths now.
You're getting close.

630
00:36:52,488 --> 00:36:55,431
It's time! I can't believe
this is happening!

631
00:36:55,997 --> 00:36:57,420
I think I'm gonna cry.

632
00:36:58,745 --> 00:37:00,982
Carlos, I am so sorry about the...

633
00:37:01,006 --> 00:37:03,451
Yeah, i-Me, too. Me, too.
I was way out of line.

634
00:37:03,526 --> 00:37:05,013
I forgive you.

635
00:37:05,638 --> 00:37:08,720
It's worth it when you experience
a moment as beautiful as this.

636
00:37:10,307 --> 00:37:12,141
Okay, I can see the head now.

637
00:37:12,177 --> 00:37:14,143
Oh, get the camera!
Get the camera!

638
00:37:20,657 --> 00:37:21,961
Oh, my God!

639
00:37:35,046 --> 00:37:37,623
Oh, man, I gotta get the
color fixed on this thing.

640
00:37:45,707 --> 00:37:46,902
How could this has happened?

641
00:37:47,008 --> 00:37:49,192
What kind of half-Ass fertility
clinic are you running?

642
00:37:49,458 --> 00:37:50,620
Prior to implantation,

643
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:54,282
your embryo was accidentally
switched with another client's.

644
00:37:54,587 --> 00:37:56,942
So if we got theirs
and they got ours,

645
00:37:56,975 --> 00:37:57,833
Then it's possible...

646
00:37:57,846 --> 00:38:00,253
No, I'm afraid your
embryo didn't take.

647
00:38:00,495 --> 00:38:03,143
Again, on behalf of the
clinic, I am so sorry.

648
00:38:03,377 --> 00:38:05,443
It's rare, but these
things do happen.

649
00:38:05,515 --> 00:38:06,173
Excuse me.

650
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:08,753
You screw up our lives,
and the best you can do is,

651
00:38:08,766 --> 00:38:10,571
"That's the way
the cookie crumbles"?!

652
00:38:10,858 --> 00:38:13,153
And who is this guy? Why is he
writing down everything I say?

653
00:38:13,205 --> 00:38:14,773
This is Mr. Darby, our attorney.

654
00:38:14,796 --> 00:38:16,622
We thought it wise
to have him present.

655
00:38:16,938 --> 00:38:18,510
Do you know what else
would've been wise?

656
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:21,410
Sticking the right baby
in the right belly!

657
00:38:21,905 --> 00:38:23,352
Mrs. Solis, please.

658
00:38:50,098 --> 00:38:51,370
That's not Alma.

659
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:55,583
Are you sure?

660
00:38:55,865 --> 00:38:56,830
Absolutely.

661
00:38:57,716 --> 00:38:58,613
Thank God.

662
00:39:04,496 --> 00:39:06,970
Carolyn. What is she doing here?

663
00:39:07,007 --> 00:39:10,962
You didn't honestly think they'd
take your word for it, did you?

664
00:39:17,407 --> 00:39:18,571
It's not her.

665
00:39:20,908 --> 00:39:24,192
Well, that's it then.
Sorry for wasting your time.

666
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:25,702
This means nothing.

667
00:39:25,806 --> 00:39:28,470
I'm telling you,
that man is as guilty sin!

668
00:39:28,498 --> 00:39:29,751
We know what you think.

669
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:32,000
Now would you please
leave us alone?

670
00:39:32,285 --> 00:39:34,661
He's a cold-Blooded killer.

671
00:39:34,966 --> 00:39:39,060
He's kind and decent, and nothing you could
say will ever make me doubt him again.

672
00:39:39,136 --> 00:39:40,180
Now please go.

673
00:39:47,728 --> 00:39:48,973
You deserve him.

674
00:39:56,308 --> 00:39:59,522
Darling, I am so sorry you had
to endure that. Are you all right?

675
00:39:59,778 --> 00:40:02,050
I'm fine. Let's just go
back to our guests and

676
00:40:02,628 --> 00:40:04,250
forget any of this
ever happened. All right.

677
00:40:13,918 --> 00:40:15,421
Tu me manques, Monique.

678
00:40:29,575 --> 00:40:30,742
Well...

679
00:40:34,287 --> 00:40:35,762
I feel so...

680
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:37,560
Me, too.

681
00:40:41,846 --> 00:40:43,272
Well, you know what
the good news is.

682
00:40:45,316 --> 00:40:46,090
What's that?

683
00:40:47,636 --> 00:40:50,453
Now that there's no baby,
it'll make the divorce a lot simpler.

684
00:40:54,756 --> 00:40:56,233
Yeah, that's something.

685
00:40:58,856 --> 00:40:59,730
So...

686
00:41:02,688 --> 00:41:04,140
I'll see you
at the mediator's.

687
00:41:06,108 --> 00:41:07,140
See you then.

688
00:41:23,385 --> 00:41:26,121
Have you met
the perfect couple...

689
00:41:27,317 --> 00:41:29,151
The two soul mates,

690
00:41:29,666 --> 00:41:31,942
whose love never dies?

691
00:41:34,015 --> 00:41:35,730
The two lovers,

692
00:41:36,176 --> 00:41:39,550
