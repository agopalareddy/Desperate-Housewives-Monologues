1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,390
previously desperate housewives.

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:04,400
I saw the man in your freezer.

3
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:07,560
Mrs.Mccluskey and parker shared a secret...

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,260
0you can never tell anyone.

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,690
But the secret was discovered.

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,590
You bet me in a game of poker?

7
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,880
Susan was forced to make a decision.

8
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,660
Get out. There will be no kissing,
and there will be no wedding.

9
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:21,790
Lynette ventured into dangerous territory.

10
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:22,920
You ever wear your hair down?

11
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:23,930
Sometimes.

12
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:25,380
Looks really good.

13
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:26,440
Thanks.

14
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,010
Are you embarrassed to be dating me?

15
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,180
If gaby finds out, she's gonna hit the ceiling.

16
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,890
Edie came to a disturbing realization.

17
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,330
Oh, my god. You're still in love with her.

18
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,480
And gaby took a bold step.

19
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:41,340
In a few months, I will be mrs.Victor ng.

20
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:45,380
I don't know my own strength...

21
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:50,190
the night of her engagement party,
gabrielle solis was injured.

22
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:55,030
But she wasn't hurt by the chauffer
who almost slammed a door on her fingers...

23
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,050
or the stranger who almost stepped on her hand...

24
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,960
or the waiter who almost dropped a knife on her wrist.

25
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:09,750
No, gabrielle's injury came about in a more unexpected fashion

26
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,370
and was caused by someone gabrielle thought was her friend.

27
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,240
Thank you.

28
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,970
- So have you told bree about your engagement?
- Yep.

29
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,940
She's on the top of a swiss alp
and still managed to send a basket of muffins.

30
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:23,830
- You're kidding.
- No.

31
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:26,710
Damn things traveled 5,000 miles,
and they were still moist.

32
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,250
I don't know how she does it.

33
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:29,620
Hey, it's getting late.

34
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,010
Let's break out the champagne.

35
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:31,730
Wait, wait.

36
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,810
You're not gonna embarrass me
with some sappy toast, are you?

37
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:36,300
I'm not, but susan's written a poem.

38
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:38,400
A poem?

39
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:43,000
She's reworked the lyrics to "wind beneath my wings."

40
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:45,220
Testing.

41
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,010
one, two, three, testing.

44
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,390
thank you.

45
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,240
Hey, gaby.

46
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,580
Hi, edie!

47
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,260
So I finally met victor.

48
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,880
He is so charming.

49
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,100
Isn't he great?

50
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,880
I know it's been quick, buhe's just so amazing.

51
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,680
So you really love him?

52
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,760
He is the one?

53
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,640
He is, and I've never been happier.

54
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,010
I am so thrilled for you.

55
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,090
Edie, are you okay?

56
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,820
Yes! Oh, yes.

57
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,820
Yes, I'm--I'm fine. I... ,

58
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,900
oh, sweetie.

59
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,890
Don't worry. You're gonna find someone soon.

60
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,590
I just know it.

61
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,260
What?

62
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,050
Well, actually, I have found someone.

63
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:40,660
And I am... crazy about him.

64
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,500
Well, who is it?

65
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,030
Oh, no. No, no. Tonight is about you.

66
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,490
Oh, no, no, edie. Come on.

67
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,440
It would make me happy to know who's making you happy.

68
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,280
- Really?
- Yeah!

69
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,740
I wanna know who's putting that dopey grin on your face.

70
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:01,480
Well, actually, it'S... carlos.

71
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,340
Who?

72
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:04,820
Carlos.

73
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,530
I've been seeing carlos.

74
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:19,600
and this is how gabrielle solis came to be injured
the night of her engagement party.

75
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,570
And though she seemed to laugh it off,

76
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:29,040
gabrielle had been cut much, much deeper than anyone could see.

Season 03 Episode 20</font>

80
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,220
Greg is definitely off the wagon. Last week...

81
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:14,600
gossip--

82
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:18,510
for most housewives, it's just a harmless form of recreation,

83
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:24,590
an exchange of semi-interesting tidbits concerning
the semi-interesting lives of people they know.

84
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,830
That mailman was in sarah's house over an hour.

85
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,640
Packages weren't all he's delivering.

86
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,030
I could smell the whiskey on amy's breath.

87
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,480
It wasn't even noon yet.

88
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,880
Joanne may say that she was off on a religious retreat,

89
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,610
but since when does praying make your boobs bigger?

90
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:45,820
But the time comes in every neighborhood
when something very interesting happens,

91
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:51,180
and that's when gossip stops being recreation
and becomes... obsession.

92
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,390
What kind of woman would keep her husband's body in the freezer?

93
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,190
For ten years?

94
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,250
It's crazy.

95
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,500
Has anybody talked to her?

96
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,870
I've knocked twice.

97
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,840
She's not answering.

98
00:04:58,890 --> 00:04:59,720
Oh, I saw the curtain move.

99
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,820
I think I saw a hand.

100
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,600
Oh, great. Now we know she's watching us.

101
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,750
Why should we be embarrassed?

102
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,940
We're not the ones who kept a corpse-icle in the basement.

103
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:06,560
Oh, that's right.

104
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,150
She babysat your kids.

105
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:12,420
Oh, please, I don't want to think of how many times
she brought them ice cream from that basement.

106
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:17,060
I mean, jeez, if you want to keep your husband on ice,
at least have a dedicated freezer.

107
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,660
Do you think she actually killed him?

108
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,660
Uh, yeah.

109
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,070
Why else would she have hid the body?

110
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:24,440
Well, so far, she's only been charged
with improper disposal of a corpse.

111
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:29,690
But once they defrost the body and do an autopsy,
I guarantee you they're gonna find a bellyful of arsenic.

112
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,640
what's arsenic?

113
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,830
It's just-- it's something yucky, honey.

114
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,200
Go on and play with your ball.

115
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,150
Go on.

116
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,240
We're trying so hard to protect them from this.

117
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,560
There are just some things that kids don't need to know about.

118
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,960
Hell, there's some things we don't need to know about.

119
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,040
Would you guys excuse me?

120
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,330
Hey, edie!

121
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,870
Oh, hi, gaby!

122
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,100
What's up?

123
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:09,330
I've been doing some thinking,
and you know how... how do I put this?

124
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,120
You know how you feel like sometimes people hate you?

125
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,010
I don't feel like that.

126
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,860
We, you should, 'cause they do.

127
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,430
Since when?

128
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,720
Since you started doing things to piss people off.

129
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,080
About what?

130
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:22,840
Oh, I don't know.

131
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:27,250
Off the top of my head... dating your friends' exes.

132
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:32,530
Oh. Oh, so that big smile on your face
the other night was all an act.

133
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,830
You're not fine with me seeing carlos.

134
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:36,990
Edie, there are a thousand single men in fairview.

135
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,100
Why do you have to date my ex-husband?

136
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,440
You're engaged to somebody else!

137
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,170
What do you care?

138
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,520
It's awkward!

139
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,590
It's--it's like if i donated a dress to charity,
and I went to a party, and you showed up wearing it.

140
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,110
Again, if you gave it away in the first place,
then what the hell are you bitching about?

141
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:56,550
Look, edie, just find your own men
and stop snapping up other people's castoffs!

142
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,380
And what if I don't?

143
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:08,160
Then be prepared to suffer the consequences.

144
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:09,890
oh, please.

145
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,790
You are as tall as my legs.

146
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,230
What are you gonna do?

147
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,770
You're about to find out.

148
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,470
who is it this time?

149
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:27,860
Um... it's ian.

150
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,540
you gonna talk to him?

151
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,010
No.

152
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:33,600
Uh, he's got flowers.

153
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,470
I don't care.

154
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,240
looks like it's two dozen roses.

155
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,730
Oh, good. I hope the thorns rip him to shreds.

156
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:41,820
okay, mom, I know what mike and ian did was wrong, but--

157
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,990
they bet me in a game of poker.

158
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,050
They made decisions about my life over a hand of 5-card stud.

159
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:49,870
"Wrong" does not even begin to cover it.

160
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:56,410
okay, okay, but there are only two guys in this world
who know all of your flaws and have still found a way to love you.

161
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:57,770
You're just gonna toss 'em both away?

162
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,660
Yes.

163
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,420
I don't need a man.

164
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,570
I don't even need sex.

165
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,850
I went without it the first 16 years...

166
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,640
22 years of my life, and I can go a few more.

167
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:15,840
This should be interesting.

168
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:16,830
What?

169
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,100
Mike just walked up.

170
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,460
give it up.

171
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,800
She didn't answer the first ten times.

172
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,580
She's not gonna answer it now.

173
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,380
oh, this is getting sad.

174
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:38,530
Take it like a brit-- stiff upper lip.

175
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,910
You know what? I've just about bloody had it with you.

176
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,230
I preferred you when you were comatose and pooping in a bag!

177
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,940
Well, lucky for you, I don't have that bag right now.

178
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,620
All right, that does it.

179
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,480
Uh, excuse me? Guys?

180
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,020
Hi.

181
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:57,980
Um, my mom would really like for both of you to leave.

182
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,260
Don't soft-pedal it.

183
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:00,860
Let 'em know I mean business.

184
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,550
Uh, 'cause if you-- if you don't,
she'll be very, very disappointed.

185
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,700
Rip 'em!

186
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,220
So just, um... go home and think about what you've done.

187
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,410
If you want something bitchier, do it yourself!

188
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:25,480
Here we are-- ravioli stuffed with duck confit
in a porcini cream sauce.

189
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,850
What do you think?

190
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:34,500
I think it's a shame you didn't make any for yourself.

191
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,540
Hi, honey.

192
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:44,360
hey, I just wanted to say I love you.

193
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,820
Aren't you sweet?

194
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,540
what's that noise in the background?

195
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,430
Are the boys still up?

196
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,740
Yeah, they don't want to go to bed.

197
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,310
Well, of course they don'T.

198
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,790
They're kids. You're the dad.

199
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,470
Make 'em.

200
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,440
Well, I tried, honey, but they wanna wait up for you.

201
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,390
They... they miss their mom.

202
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:04,080
Ah, is this your way of guilting me into coming back home?

203
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:07,700
Lynette, the--the restaurant did close a half-hour ago.

204
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:10,430
preston, don't throw pudding!

205
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,460
Oh, tom... I'm sorry.

206
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,620
I can't come home.

207
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:21,090
We're, um... doing inventory, so... it could be a while.

208
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,100
Well, okay.

209
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,980
- Try to hurry?
- I will.

210
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,490
I love you. Bye.

211
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,320
inventory?

212
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,850
I know. I'm a horrible person.

213
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:37,020
I just chose ravioli over motherhood.

214
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,430
I should--I should go home.

215
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,220
Lynette, you got nothing to feel guilty about.

216
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,170
You bust your ass in this restaurant every day to keep it going,

217
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,830
and if anybody deserves a little downtime, it's you.

218
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,930
Those are shameless rationalizations.

219
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,310
Keep them coming.

220
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,310
Those, too.

221
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,660
there you are.

222
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,120
What are you doing outside?

223
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:13,140
Some big kids threw eggs at mrs. Mccluskey's house.

224
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,600
Oh, jeez.

225
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,080
They shouldn't have done that.

226
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,090
We should go talk to her.

227
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,460
No.

228
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:25,190
It's late.

229
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:27,710
Uh, she probably doesn't want us to bother her.

230
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,760
Come on, bud.

231
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:30,820
Bedtime.

232
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,050
so here's what's gonna happen-- we're not talking to edie anymore.

233
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,840
What do you mean, "we"?

234
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:52,890
I mean, "we" as in she betrayed me, and you're my best friends,

235
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:55,060
so y're gonna support me because that's what friends do.

236
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,980
And "support you" means... acting like we're in junior high?

237
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,660
I can't believe you're not furious at this.

238
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:05,870
Before she sank her fangs into carlos,
she was dating your ex-husband and mike.

239
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:08,000
Yes, and do you know who i blame?

240
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,770
I blame karl and mike.

241
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,340
Why isn't anybody mad at them?

242
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,270
I mean, let's face it.

243
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:14,200
The men-- they get away with murder.

244
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,320
They're scum!

245
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,610
Okay.

246
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,790
Back to edie... I'm not sure I'm comfortable ganging up on her.

247
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:22,570
Really?

248
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:27,720
Because I wasn't very comfortable taking your si
when you were feuding with patty monroe over the backyard fence line,

249
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,670
but I did.

250
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:29,680
Oh, gaby, that's not fair.

251
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,560
Nobody really liked patty to begin with.

252
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,820
Don't even get me started about what I've done for you, okay?

253
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:39,020
I'm still boycotting madame kim's day spa
because of your botched bikini wax.

254
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,170
Oh, my god. How do you botch a bikini wax?

255
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,980
She will show you later!

256
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:47,750
The point is, good friends share more than just gossip and brunch.

257
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,840
They share enemies, too.

258
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,730
So are you with me or not?

259
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,220
Of course we're with you.

260
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,380
We will give edie the cold shoulder.

261
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,580
No, no! Not cold, frozen!

262
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:04,400
I want icicles hanging from that bitch's ears!

263
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:10,200
Hello?

264
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:12,990
Hi.

265
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,170
Hey, do you still want me to look at that book report?

266
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,630
Daddy helped me yesterday.

267
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:18,890
You weren't home.

268
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,640
Oh. Okay.

269
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,820
Daddy does everything lately.

270
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,470
How come you always come home so late?

271
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,060
Well, I'm really busy at the restaurant.

272
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:34,130
Believe me, I come home to daddy just as soon as I can.

273
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,610
you're lying.

274
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,620
What?

275
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,320
You always laugh like that when you're telling a lie.

276
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,400
why would you say that?

277
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,300
Because... it's true.

278
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:55,860
I stay late because there's a lot of work to do,

279
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,720
and right now I'm the only person who can do it,

280
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:01,430
and now I have to go to the grocery store
because I am the only person who can do that, mm-hmm.

281
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:04,630
So why don't you go upstairs and finish your homework?

282
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,990
Okay.

283
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,930
But it is what you do.

284
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,610
excuse me!

285
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,490
uh, hey!

286
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,490
Excuse me.

287
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,880
That's my space!

288
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:41,780
Yeah, well, I'm parked in it,
so that kind of makes it my space.

289
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:47,410
hey, uh, I waited for that spot while the guy
made three phone calls and flossed his teeth.

290
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,430
You can't just steal it.

291
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,750
It's a parking space!

292
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,660
Keep a lid on your hormones, honey.

293
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:58,080
God! You did that on purpose!

294
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,230
Yeah, and I'm about to do this on purpose, too.

295
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,730
Crazy bitch!

296
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,870
What do you think you're doing?!

297
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,920
What are you doing? What are you doing?!

298
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,830
I'm taking my damn space!

299
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,700
Get out of my car. Get out of my car.

300
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,500
Hey, hey

301
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,380
Say you're sorry.

302
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:12,940
- Let me go!
- Say it!

303
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,530
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.

304
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:18,720
Say, "I'm a rude, arrogant bastard
who needs to treat women with courtesy and respect!"

305
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:21,890
I'm a rude, arrogant... how does the rest of it go?

306
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,780
freeze!

307
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:25,690
Was this man trying to steal your car?

308
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,860
It's my car!

309
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,190
She--she tripped me and grabbed my keys.

310
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,400
Is this true, ma'am?

311
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,360
Oh, all right, take his side!

312
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,710
Hey, who you spying on?

313
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:43,720
Lynette.

314
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,820
She hasn't returned my last two phone calls.

315
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,190
I think something's up.

316
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,560
She's probably just busy.

317
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:51,390
Yeah, we'll see about that.

318
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,380
I am calling her right... now.

319
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,500
oh, my god!

320
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:02,900
What?

321
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,160
she just screened me!

322
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,210
I have been screened!

323
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,960
maybe she's in a hurry.

324
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,800
No, no, no. This has gabrielle solis written all over it.

325
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,070
She is turning people against me.

326
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,600
And you're surprised?

327
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,630
I told you how she'd react if she found out about us.

328
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,360
Yeah?

329
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:24,600
Well, if she wants to play these schoolgirl games, fine.

330
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,740
'Cause i invented 'em.

331
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,300
Lynette!

332
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,130
Hi!

333
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:38,490
Hey, hey!

334
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,040
I just tried calling you.

335
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:40,990
Oh, really?

336
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:43,120
My ringer must've been off.

337
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,560
Oh, no prob.

338
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:48,180
I wanted to invite you and the boys to travers' birthday party on saturday.

339
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:51,800
Yeah, I'm having this reptile guy,
and he's got all these cool snakes and lizards.

340
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,410
Oh! The boys would love that,

341
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,830
but unfortunately, I gotta work.

342
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,160
Well, that's a shame, because I was hoping you could cater.

343
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,190
Cater?

344
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:07,660
Yeah, I'm gonna need pastas and salads for the parents
and at least 20 pizzas for the kids.

345
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:09,240
Wow, that many?

346
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,590
Yeah, and... well, you know kids.

347
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,890
If one has a pizza party,
they're all gonna want a pizza party.

348
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:16,510
Hmm, could be good for business.

349
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:23,140
Well, yeah, I guess I could work somethin' out.

350
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:25,380
Oh, I knew I could count on you!

351
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,220
mm! Love ya!

352
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:34,560
****

353
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,710
I do not have "anger issues."

354
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,670
I was just having a bad day.

355
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:43,100
You threatened to decapitate a man over a parking space.

356
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:45,270
A very bad day.

357
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:51,290
Susan, when someone loses it like you did,
there's usually a reason.

358
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,280
Are things going okayat work?

359
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,540
Work is great.

360
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:58,060
You could just sign that paper and tell the judge I'm finE.

361
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:00,020
what about your family?

362
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:01,110
Family's terrific.

363
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,820
Seriously, you're just wasting your time here.

364
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,000
How's your love life?

365
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,930
cancel my lunch.

366
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,600
I'm gonna be here for a while.

367
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:27,870
will you stop ringing that damn...

368
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,090
I'm sorry, parker.

369
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:33,840
I thought you were one of those little pissants
who keep ringing the bell and running away.

370
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,430
So what's on your mind?

371
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,760
I want you to come back and babysit us.

372
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,960
The new sitter stinks.

373
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,480
Your folks hired a new sitter?

374
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,910
Yeah, and she thinks carrot sticks are snacks.

375
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:51,910
Well, that's rough, but... life's like that sometimes.

376
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,550
It doesn't have to be.

377
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:56,050
If you just told people what happened with your husband,

378
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:58,390
everything could go back to the way it was.

379
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,320
Parker, you see those women over there?

380
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:07,050
Nothing I could say would stop those tongues from wagging.

381
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:12,600
I'm sorry, kid, but... I just have to wait this one out.

382
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,280
can you imagine?!

383
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:26,180
I mean, finding out that two men you trusted bet you in a poker game.

384
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,960
I mean, how demeaning is that?!

385
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,820
Well, it depends on how you look at it.

386
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:33,580
Men have been waging contests over women for centuries.

387
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,640
I grant you, poker isn't as romantic as, say, jousting,

388
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,470
but it shows how they felt about you.

389
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:44,950
the real question is how did you feel about them?

390
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:48,460
I told you-- hurt and betrayed.

391
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:53,250
No, how did you feel about them before this poker business?

392
00:19:53,850 --> 00:20:02,030
well... I was engaged to ian, so... obviously I loved him.

393
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:05,940
And mike?Were you in love with him, too?

394
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,940
- How we doing on time?
- Susan.

395
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,010
Okay, fine, I loved him.

396
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,210
I still love him, and I love ian.

397
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,400
So I am totally, hopelessly in love with two men.

398
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:17,870
Now we're getting somewhere.This is good.

399
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,700
No, this is horrible!

400
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:21,320
This wasn't supposed to happen!

401
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:25,080
I only let myself fall for ian 'cause i thought mike was lost to me.

402
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,520
And then bang!Suddenly he wants me back,

403
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,450
and now I have this choice that I can't possibly make.

404
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,650
- I agree.It's tough-
- it's devastating!

405
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:41,560
If I go with mike, ian's heart will be broken, and ian does not deserve that.

406
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:45,870
But how can I reject mike after all he's been through?

407
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:49,480
So you're just gonna walk away from both of them?

408
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,880
you have to make a choice, sweetie.

409
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:55,870
You've got two great guys, both of them crazy about you.

410
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:00,140
To let one go-- well, that's life.It happens.

411
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:04,540
To let them both go... that's just...

412
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:08,760
- stupid?
- Yes.

413
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:12,390
That would be the clinical term.

414
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:20,130
sounds great.Thanks.

415
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:28,110
Hey, how would you like to eat something that's neither pasta nor pizza?

416
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:30,700
such food exists?Don't tease me.

417
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,870
No, my--my friend al, he's opening a soul food place...

418
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,250
And sunday night, he wants to test the menu with some of his chebuddies.

419
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,960
He said I could bring someone.

420
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,990
And--and--and you want me to go wi you?

421
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:44,710
It'll be after we close.

422
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,890
and don't tell me that you hate southern food, 'cause then we can't be friends.

423
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:52,260
No, I love it.

424
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,840
It'S... it's just that's a little late for me, and...

425
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:57,550
Oh, oh, oh.Okay.I-I just thought it'd be fun.

426
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,950
No, it would be, but sunday nights are kind of crazy.

427
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:03,070
I'm packing lunches and checking homework...

428
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:06,300
Right, right.No worries.I get it.

429
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:09,760
You're just, uh, first person I thought of.

430
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:17,340
You know, maybe i should go.

431
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:23,190
Um... it's part of the job to check out the competition, right?

432
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:27,160
Yeah, absolutely.It never hurts to see what else is out there.

433
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:31,130
I agree.

434
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,340
hey, guys, go check out the snakes.

435
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,300
I'll give you some pizza later, okay?

436
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,160
- See you later.
- All right, I'll see you later.

437
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,650
- Hey, you want some pizza?
- Yeah.

438
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,510
There you go.

439
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,160
Lynette!

440
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:01,260
What are you doing here?

441
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:07,340
edie asked me to cater.I know, I'm a total whore, but please don't rat me out to gaby.

442
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:08,960
Hi, susan!

443
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,390
I have 30 copies of your book.The kids can't wait for you to sign it.

444
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:15,760
Come on, let's go!Come on, come on!

445
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,520
Looks like we're working the same corner.

446
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:24,100
Yeah, only I didn't know edie was gonna have the party in a park.

447
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,360
- What if gaby see us?
- Trust me, we can both relax.

448
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:30,310
I talked to her this morning, and she's out with victor all day.

449
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:33,810
oh.Well, that's a relief.

450
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:59,210
Go ahead.I dare ya.

451
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,960
Hey!what's going on?

452
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:20,460
{6}"Witch"

453
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,690
- hey, don't do that!
- Why not?

454
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,120
- Because she's not a witch.
- How do you know?

455
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:26,200
'Cause she isn'T.Don't be a jerk.

456
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,460
What is she, your girlfriend?parker's in love!

457
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:30,790
Shut up!

458
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:34,510
Hey, you boys!Knock it off!

459
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:37,130
Parker, I'm so sorry.

460
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,620
Are you all right?

461
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:43,830
You know, everything would be okay if you'd tell people what you told me.

462
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:46,750
You can make 'em stop.

463
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,440
Hey, lynette, it's gaby.

464
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,810
Victor got pulled into some photo op at the homeless shelter.

465
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,800
So I'm free for lunch.You wanna go with?

466
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:03,780
I tried susan but she's not home,

467
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:10,120
which is weird because her car's in the driveway and... so is yours.

468
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:12,790
Where is everybody?

469
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,870
Down!Down!Down!Aah!

470
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,230
Lynette, what is wrong with you?!

471
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,680
- Gaby's coming.- What?!

472
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,800
I thought you said she was with victor.

473
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,660
I was wrong.I was wrong.Come on.Follow me.Follow me.

474
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,830
Mommy, can I play?

475
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:45,270
No!Go ride the python!

476
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,810
Come on.

477
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,490
Rent A Reptile

478
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:59,240
Okay, okay, she's circling the park.

479
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:02,370
Ugh.I wish she'd hurry.I'm terrified of snakes.

480
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,770
Oh, yeah, I'm more terrified of gaby.

481
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,640
Okay, good, good.

482
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:10,630
- We're almost home free...
- what?

483
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,040
Don't turn around.

484
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:25,940
lynette!Susan!

485
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,520
- Hey, gab.- Hi.

486
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:29,960
What are you two doing here?

487
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:30,670
Uh, what are we doing here?

488
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:36,650
Well, edie hired me to cater, so it's just business.

489
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:39,150
I don't know what her excuse is.

490
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,220
You are so dead.

491
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:44,260
I don't believe it.This is an absolute betrayal of our friendship.

492
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,140
Gaby, she asked me to make 20 pizzas.

493
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:47,760
I couldn't turn it down.

494
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:51,260
Oh, this is so delicious.

495
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,500
Is that what our friendship is worth to you--20 pizzas?

496
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:56,480
- We had a pact!
- Oh, come on, gaby, be fair.

497
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,520
You put us in a really awkward position.

498
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:01,890
- Me?!You two owe me an apology.
- No, gaby, be reasonable.

499
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,630
I am leaving this party right now, and if you two don't come with me,

500
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:07,120
- our friendship is over.
- Gaby!Oh, come on!

501
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,030
- What?!
- Oh!No, I mean it.

502
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:11,570
Carlos, stop!

503
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,220
Put me down!What are you doing?!

504
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:17,680
Stop it!Carlos, put me down!

505
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:20,080
How dare you maul me like that!

506
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,920
You were ruining travers' birthday party.

507
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,560
What the hell is wrong with you?!

508
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:26,190
I'm sorry.Betrayal makes me a little cranky.

509
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:29,840
Come on, gaby, you can't tell susan and lynette who they're allowed to be friends with.

510
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:31,770
- It's ridiculouS.- I'll tell you what's ridiculous

511
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,130
-- you not having the guts to tell me you were dating edie.

512
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,570
oh, here it is.

513
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,640
Yeah.I had to find out from her at my damn engagement party.

514
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:43,020
Well, I had to hear that you were engaged to that victor guy on the news.

515
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,760
I didn't plan it that way.

516
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:46,360
It was spur of the moment.

517
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,750
Oh, so you just said, hey, what the heck?

518
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:53,240
- You even in love with this guy?
- Yes, deeply.

519
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,640
Must be nice.

520
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,890
Well, aren't you in love with edie?

521
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:08,440
We're having fun together, but it'll never be serious.

522
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:16,210
So... if I'm just dating, and you're in love and getting married...

523
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:20,390
remind me again why it is that you get to be the angry one.

524
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:24,830
I'm sorry, carlos.

525
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,440
You should be.

526
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:39,560
And for the first time, gabrielle was willing to let carlos be with someone else...

527
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:41,150
hey!HeY.

528
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:47,090
Because she knew... he still belonged to her.

529
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,940
Feel free to take home as much cake as you want.I do not want to be tempted.

530
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:54,430
I might take a little for tom and...

531
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:03,530
hi, mrs.Mccluskey.Would you like some cake?

532
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:06,200
I didn't come for sweets.

533
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:08,080
I know you people have been talking about me,

534
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:10,990
and I guess the only way to shut you up is to come clean.

535
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,920
So... who would like to hear the gruesome details?

536
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:22,180
- I would.
- Um... yeah.If--if you feel like it.

537
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:29,330
Well... first off--and I know this will disappoint some of you-- but I didn't kill gilbert.

538
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:35,860
I came home from a weekend in laughlin and found him in front of the tv--dead.

539
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,410
He still had the remote in his hand.

540
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,390
Good lord.

541
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:45,150
It was 2:00 A.M., So I decided to wait until morning to call the funeral home.

542
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:49,540
And I went to his desk to make sure everything was in order.

543
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:53,940
I found his pension plan... and guess what?

544
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:58,640
In the event of his death, I was not the beneficiary.

545
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:02,750
- Who was?
- His first wife.

546
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,220
They were married when he started the job-- for two years.

547
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:11,530
We were together for 34 years, and that idiot didn't change the paperwork.

548
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:17,160
I not only lost my gilbert, but I was about to lose everything.

549
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:21,080
So I, um... I, um...

550
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:25,790
you put him in the freezer and kept cashing the checks.

551
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:31,110
Well, what else was I gonna do?

552
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:36,740
Besides, after a while, it was kind of nice having him around.

553
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:40,690
Anyway... that's the truth.

554
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:43,580
You ladies have my permission to pass it along...

555
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:47,890
not that some of you ladies need it.

556
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,820
probably weren't expecting to see me, huh?

557
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:10,220
Well, after 20 unanswered calls... no, not really.

558
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:15,640
About that, uh, obviously, have been very confused.

559
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:19,200
I finally saw a therapist.

560
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:22,110
Actually, it was sort of a court-ordered thing.Anyway...

561
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:26,630
well, I need to talk to you.

562
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,780
You sound... sure.

563
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:35,670
I am.

564
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,770
I'm gonna marry ian.

565
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,580
Believe me, this wasn't easy,

566
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,780
especially when you started to remember how it was between us.

567
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:58,790
Maybe if the timing had been different... it wasn'T.

568
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,180
I'm sorry, mike.

569
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:11,310
Well, at least I have my memories.

570
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,550
- You ready to go?
- Yeah.

571
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:32,010
Um, I told kim that we'd be out the rest of the evening and she's gonna lock up.

572
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,850
- Great.I'll, uh, just get my jacket.
- Okay.

573
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,540
Hey!You got a table for seven?

574
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,370
- Hey!
- Hi!What are you doing here?

575
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:52,700
Well, the kids wanted to surprise you, and it's been forever since we've all had dinner together,

576
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,310
so... what--well, how did you t here?

577
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,620
I mean, you're not supposed to... drive.

578
00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:02,020
I took a cab, a double-dose of the painkillers, and voil?

579
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,060
- you surprised?
- Yeah, a little.

580
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,440
we missed you.

581
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:07,100
Oh, I missed you, too.

582
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:11,600
Hey, why don't you guys go grab that big table, and I will have rick whip something up for us?

583
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:15,480
Hi.wow, you smell good.

584
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:19,540
Oh.It must be the basil.It has a kind of sweet smell.

585
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:22,820
hey, kayla, can you get A... high chair for your sister, please?

586
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,240
- Yeah.
- all right, who wants pizza?

587
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,760
Oh, hi.Uh, change of plans.

588
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:30,090
Yeah.Yeah, I see.

589
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:32,400
But... I'm sorry.You could still go.

590
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:35,480
Oh, no.No, no.I'll stay.I'll cook for your family.

591
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:38,460
Thanks.Thank you.

592
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:45,770
Thanks, sweetie.

593
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:48,540
You are taking such good care of me.

594
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,940
When's lynette getting home?

595
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,700
Oh, as soon as she closes up the pizzeria.

596
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,390
Mm.Is that guy rick helping her?

597
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:57,480
He better be, for as much as we're paying him.

598
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,650
I think lynette likes him.

599
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:02,950
Sure.He's a nice guy, rd worker.

600
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:06,750
No, I mean, she likes him, likes him.

601
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:12,810
what makes you say that?

602
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:15,910
Just something I noticed.

603
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:19,240
Well, good night, daddy.

604
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:32,550
mrs.Susan hainsworth-- god, I love the sound of that.

605
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,740
Orid you want to keep your name?Because I love the sound of that, too.

606
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,240
As long as I get to call you my wife.

607
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:41,060
deal.

608
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:44,270
You do realize we're gonna be blissfully happy, don't you?

609
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:48,130
I mean, it could actually get a bit disgusting.People might throw fruit.

610
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,850
oh, I'm gonna lock up down here.

611
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,810
Why don't you go upstairs and warm up the bed?

612
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:01,190
you do realize we're gonna be great together, don't you?

613
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:03,980
I know.

614
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,260
hey, susan.Um, I don't mean to bug you.

615
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:19,870
There's just so much I didn't get to say.

616
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:23,730
Um, I... god, I'm lousy at good-byes.

617
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:29,850
Anyway, you will always be the best thing that ever happened to me, and,

618
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:33,330
well, I hope you find the happiness you deserve.

619
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:37,620
Bye.Oh, this is mike.

620
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:43,700
hey, susan.

621
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,500
Um, I don't mean to bug you.

622
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,760
There's just so much I didn't get to say.

623
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:52,330
Um, I... god, I'm lousy at good-byes.

624
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:58,200
Anyway, you will always be the best thing that ever happened to me, and, well,

625
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,240
I hope you find the happiness you deserve.

626
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,930
Bye.Oh, this is mike.

627
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,690
where are you going?

628
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:14,060
Home... to england.

629
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:18,200
To england?What's wrong?

630
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:22,420
Well, it's just, um... I don't think this is going to work.

631
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:24,670
What?

632
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,130
But just ten minutes ago, we were making plans,

633
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,560
and you were saying how great we were gonna be together.

634
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:33,340
I, uh, saw you listening to that message from mike.

635
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,430
Well, ian, I made my choice.

636
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,820
But not for the right reasons.

637
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:46,300
You're just trying to honor a promise you made to me.

638
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,860
That's not true.

639
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:52,950
I will get over him.

640
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,840
You've been trying to get over him for as long as I've known you.

641
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:59,040
Haven't had much luck, have you?

642
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,190
Ian, I love you.

643
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:03,010
I know you do.

644
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,950
But you love him a little bit more, don't you?

645
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:20,990
I can't live a life where every time I see you with a faraway look,

646
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:24,900
I'll wonder if you're thinking of him.

647
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:29,730
I'm so sorry.

648
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:34,330
You deserve to be happy.

649
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:37,960
And so do I.

650
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:42,880
Good-bye, susan.

651
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:56,120
Hey, mrs.Mccluskey.

652
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:58,320
Lynette.

653
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:02,990
Well, it turns out our new babysitterisn't working out too well.

654
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:06,250
Feel upto another tour of duty?

655
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:10,430
Are you sure you wantthe wisteria witch looking after your kids?

656
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,130
My kids knowyou're not a witch.

657
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:16,050
Too bad.I could use the leverage.

658
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:22,170
We missed you.Same here.

659
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,330
I'm gonna need a raise,though.

660
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,670
I'm kinda strapped.

661
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,640
okay.

662
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:41,550
I just talkedto mrs.Mccluskey, and she is gonna startlooking after our kids again.

663
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:43,070
- That's great!
- Yeah.

664
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:50,470
'Cause actually,I have been thinking, anD... it is timethat I got back to work.

665
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,350
- What?
- Yep.I'm feeling good.

666
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:55,730
I'm gettin' around better.

667
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:01,550
But... but the doctor saidyour recovery would take months, and it's only been six weeks.

668
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:04,430
Well, it's not likeI'm gonna, you know, dead-lift a bag of ice,

669
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:07,210
but I can sprinkle cheese on a pizza.

670
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:12,580
Mm.Besides... I hate making yourun that place by yourself.

671
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,920
- I don't mind
.- Really?

672
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:17,260
Because before,you said it was killing you.

673
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:22,400
Yeah, well, you know, it is,but I just don't want you to come backbefore you're ready.

674
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:24,430
You might reinjure yourselF.

675
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,070
I'll be careful.

676
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:29,500
The best part is we can finallyget rick off the books.

677
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,570
Rick?Why would we wantto let him go?

678
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:37,610
Well,I know he's been great, but, um, his salaryis cutting into our profits.

679
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:41,940
Actually, he is bringing inmore than enough business to cover his salary.

680
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:46,120
I mean, with all thosenew dishes he's been cooking, he's got a lot of fans out there.

681
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:47,010
Does he really?

682
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:50,840
Yeah.I think firing himwould be a huge mistake.

683
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:53,440
Well, it's just a thought.

684
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,550
Well, don't think so much.

685
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,110
Just rest and get better.

686
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:59,370
That's what you need to do.

687
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,750
You gonna be late tonight?

688
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:04,180
Probably.We got a big partycoming in at 10:00.

689
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:07,840
So...mm-hmm.I'll just see youin the morning.

690
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,410
- I'll be here.
- Okay.

691
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:15,790
Hi, ida.What's up?

692
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:18,850
That idiot postmanmixed up our mail again.

693
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:21,820
Oh, poor mr.Henley.He does seem to be getting worse.

694
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,090
Thanks for stopping by.

695
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,720
Hey, have you heardabout mike?

696
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,570
No.Uh, what about him?

697
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:30,590
- He moved.
- Moved?What do you mean?

698
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:34,600
Mona clarke was up at 2:00in the morning with acid reflux,

699
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:39,210
and she saw himpack his car and everything.

700
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,480
Well,that doesn't make sense.

701
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:43,780
Mike wouldn't leavewithout saying good-bye.

702
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:45,060
Well, he did.

703
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:51,460
According to carlos,something bad happened, and mike just wantedto get the heck out of dodge.

704
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:55,890
It's a pity.I always liked him.

705
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:10,830
Gossip-- it's just a harmless form of recreation.

706
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:14,480
It's careless talk that deals in polite fiction...

707
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:16,930
I'd love to beassistant manager, but apparently,

708
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:20,400
you haveto flirt with mrs.Scavo to get that job.

709
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:25,900
it's nasty speculation that's based on not-so-polite fact...

710
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,670
he may be dating edie, but everyone can seehe's still in love with gaby.

711
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:40,310
How do we protect ourselves from the venomous sting of such idle gossip?

712
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:43,000
A-are you the lady whokept her husband in her freezer?

713
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:45,850
The best way is to just tell the truth...

714
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:49,850
yep, that's me.Scary, aren't I?

715
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:55,050
And wait for people to start talking about someone else.

716
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:58,250
