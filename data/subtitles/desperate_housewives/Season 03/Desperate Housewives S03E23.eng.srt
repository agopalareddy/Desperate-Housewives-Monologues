00:00:00,236 --> 00:00:02,441
<i>Previously on Desperate Housewives...

2
00:00:03,035 --> 00:00:05,554
<i>Victor made himself
perfectly clear.

3
00:00:05,789 --> 00:00:07,666
Whenever I've truly
wanted something,

4
00:00:07,853 --> 00:00:08,902
I've always gotten it.

5
00:00:09,073 --> 00:00:10,497
<i>Bree needed to get away.

6
00:00:10,685 --> 00:00:12,242
We're finally taking our honeymoon.

7
00:00:12,523 --> 00:00:14,964
<i>Susan couldn't wait to
pop the question.

8
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:16,411
Will you marry me?

9
00:00:17,013 --> 00:00:18,937
<i>Lynette received shocking news.

10
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:20,987
You can see this...
It could be lymphoma.

11
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,045
Why are you so reluctant
to make a commitment to me?

12
00:00:24,131 --> 00:00:25,461
Because I'm not in love with you.

13
00:00:25,555 --> 00:00:26,556
<i>And Edie...

14
00:00:26,594 --> 00:00:28,065
What if we tried to have a baby?

15
00:00:28,197 --> 00:00:30,528
<i>engaged in a dangerous deception.

16
00:00:35,558 --> 00:00:38,718
<i>When Gabrielle Solis agreed to
marry Victor Lang,

17
00:00:39,031 --> 00:00:42,520
<i>she was determined to have
a very traditional wedding.

18
00:00:43,901 --> 00:00:48,110
<i>She was even more determined
to be a very traditional bride.

19
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:49,721
<i>To that end,

20
00:00:49,987 --> 00:00:52,576
<i>the handkerchief in
her cleavage was borrowed,

21
00:00:53,061 --> 00:00:55,064
<i>the garter on her leg was blue,

22
00:00:55,642 --> 00:00:58,114
<i>and the diamonds on
her ears were old.

23
00:00:58,763 --> 00:01:00,695
<i>But sadly for Gabrielle,

24
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,964
<i>something was missing,

25
00:01:03,871 --> 00:01:07,707
<i>and she was about
to throw a traditional fit.

26
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,841
It is after 3:00! Where the hell is Bree
with my "something new"?!

27
00:01:12,115 --> 00:01:14,901
I know her plane landed on time.
She'll probably be here any second.

28
00:01:15,262 --> 00:01:18,045
God, I should have my head examined
for even agreeing to this.

29
00:01:18,413 --> 00:01:20,791
Who the hell cares about
swiss jewelry anyway?

30
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:24,804
Gaby, Bree went out of her way
to buy you that bracelet.

31
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,229
And, of course, it's the hottest
day of the year.

32
00:01:27,518 --> 00:01:29,740
All the guests are out
there sweating like pigs.

33
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,118
God, at this rate,
my reception's gonna look like

34
00:01:32,165 --> 00:01:33,772
the finish line of
the Boston marathon.

35
00:01:33,831 --> 00:01:37,257
If you're that freaked out, just get
married without the bracelet.

36
00:01:37,414 --> 00:01:38,665
Are you out of your mind?!

37
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:40,824
I can't get married without
my "something new."

38
00:01:41,027 --> 00:01:42,090
I have an idea.

39
00:01:42,278 --> 00:01:44,953
I just got a lipstick yesterday.

40
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:47,378
You could wear that.

41
00:01:48,903 --> 00:01:51,641
I just paid a makeup artist
500 bucks to do my face.

44
00:01:55,818 --> 00:01:58,407
Okay, it's your big day,
so I'm gonna let that slide.

45
00:01:58,865 --> 00:02:01,587
God, it is 10 after,
and Bree is never late!

46
00:02:01,853 --> 00:02:03,293
Where can she be?

47
00:02:05,945 --> 00:02:07,149
All right, that's it.

48
00:02:07,447 --> 00:02:10,474
After I finish "tszujing" my hair,
tell the preacher it's showtime.

49
00:02:11,162 --> 00:02:14,327
I can't believe my wedding's already
ruined, and it hasn't even started.

50
00:02:19,057 --> 00:02:21,278
Hey, I'm starting to get
worried about Bree.

51
00:02:21,623 --> 00:02:22,702
Maybe we should call.

52
00:02:23,516 --> 00:02:24,877
I'm calling her cell.

53
00:02:28,245 --> 00:02:29,262
It's ringing.

54
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:39,397
Hello, ladies.

55
00:02:39,835 --> 00:02:42,495
Is that Bree? She better not
have come empty-handed!

56
00:02:43,144 --> 00:02:44,177
I didn't.

57
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:48,111
<i>As promised, Bree had arrived
with something new.

58
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,004
Holy crap!

59
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:51,858
<i>And she also...

60
00:02:52,671 --> 00:02:54,470
<i>brought the bracelet.

00:03:05,606 --> 00:03:06,701
<i>Family...

66
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,079
<i>there is nothing more important.

67
00:03:09,853 --> 00:03:13,545
<i>They're the ones we want to laugh
with during the good times...

68
00:03:14,543 --> 00:03:18,064
<i>And the ones we need
to console us during the bad.

69
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,212
<i>And even though the time comes
when they have to leave us,

70
00:03:25,734 --> 00:03:28,722
<i>their voices still linger
in our minds.

71
00:03:30,005 --> 00:03:32,501
<i>And sometimes we can't help

72
00:03:33,033 --> 00:03:34,276
<i>but listen.

73
00:03:34,933 --> 00:03:36,466
A tangled web...

74
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,265
That's what you're weaving.

75
00:03:38,656 --> 00:03:39,860
Beat it, mother.

76
00:03:40,298 --> 00:03:42,786
You really think this little scheme
of yours is gonna work?

77
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:44,413
Of course it will.

78
00:03:44,882 --> 00:03:46,071
Look at him.

79
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,261
He's practically in love
with me already.

80
00:03:48,605 --> 00:03:51,319
That's because he thinks
you're gonna give him a baby.

81
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:54,031
Wait till he finds out
you're still on the pill.

82
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:55,767
Shut up, would you?!

83
00:03:57,336 --> 00:04:00,716
I just thank the good lord
your father didn't live to see this.

84
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:02,280
Well, neither did you.

85
00:04:02,514 --> 00:04:05,001
You died alone in a trailer park
watching game shows.

86
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,317
And why should I listen to you?

87
00:04:07,982 --> 00:04:10,516
'cause I know
what's waiting for you, missy.

88
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,286
This one's gonna leave
you like all the others.

89
00:04:15,965 --> 00:04:18,500
You're going to end up old and alone,

90
00:04:18,852 --> 00:04:20,275
just like I did.

91
00:04:33,843 --> 00:04:35,235
Down here, babe!

92
00:04:36,299 --> 00:04:37,958
I'm making you a fruit smoothie.

93
00:04:43,648 --> 00:04:45,009
Chicken or fish?

94
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,729
What?

95
00:04:46,823 --> 00:04:48,560
I haven't gotten
your reply card back yet.

96
00:04:48,654 --> 00:04:49,764
So chicken or fish?

97
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:51,532
Right, your wedding.

98
00:04:51,923 --> 00:04:52,956
I can't go.

99
00:04:53,195 --> 00:04:54,697
- Why not?
- I'm a jinx.

100
00:04:54,882 --> 00:04:57,255
I went to your last wedding,
and look how that turned out.

101
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,702
Come on, Gaby. We both know
it'd be weird if I went.

102
00:04:59,984 --> 00:05:02,902
Okay, maybe a little, but
it'll be weirder if you don't.

103
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,200
Excuse me?

104
00:05:04,466 --> 00:05:06,315
Look, everyone knows
you're living with Edie.

105
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:09,194
If she shows up alone, people will
think I asked her not to bring you,

106
00:05:09,222 --> 00:05:11,068
like it bugs me that
you guys are together.

107
00:05:11,224 --> 00:05:13,555
But it does bug you. You hit
the roof when you found out.

108
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,231
Which is why I have to show
people that I'm okay with it.

109
00:05:16,543 --> 00:05:18,772
Please, just consider it
my wedding gift.

110
00:05:21,651 --> 00:05:22,996
But I'm skipping the ceremony.

111
00:05:23,294 --> 00:05:24,295
What?!

112
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,391
And just go to the reception?
You can't do that.

113
00:05:26,516 --> 00:05:28,081
I don't want to make a scene.

114
00:05:28,312 --> 00:05:30,173
You'll vow, "till death do us part,"

115
00:05:30,393 --> 00:05:32,943
I'll bust out laughing,
people will stare...

116
00:05:35,336 --> 00:05:36,823
Reception starts at 4:00.

117
00:05:41,035 --> 00:05:42,842
I'm thinking a chocolate fountain
would be

118
00:05:43,132 --> 00:05:44,837
a cool centerpiece
to a dessert buffet.

119
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:46,416
Dessert buffet?

120
00:05:46,682 --> 00:05:49,185
We're having a wedding cake, right?
Isn't that dessert?

121
00:05:49,443 --> 00:05:51,218
Yeah, but you have
to give people a choice.

122
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,659
Don't you think a chocolate
fountain would be elegant?

123
00:05:53,877 --> 00:05:57,757
I don't know... you,
a big white dress, melted chocolate.

124
00:05:58,453 --> 00:06:00,353
Am I the only one
hearing alarm bells?

125
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,379
Fine, we'll skip the chocolate.

126
00:06:02,943 --> 00:06:04,445
How about a champagne fountain?

127
00:06:04,969 --> 00:06:08,818
I know! Maybe we can make the champagne
flow through the ice sculpture.

128
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,411
Don't you think we might be
going a little over-the-top?

129
00:06:12,021 --> 00:06:14,728
These are all fairly standard
wedding features.

130
00:06:14,993 --> 00:06:17,481
Now you name one thing
that you think

131
00:06:17,731 --> 00:06:19,077
is going over-the-top.

132
00:06:20,102 --> 00:06:21,533
How about the dove wrangler?

133
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:24,083
The doves are not going
to release themselves.

134
00:06:24,786 --> 00:06:26,398
Do we really need 40 of 'em?

135
00:06:26,664 --> 00:06:28,674
Okay, I know that
you think I'being silly,

136
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:30,934
but all of our friends went
to Bree's wedding,

137
00:06:31,121 --> 00:06:32,568
and now they're going to Gaby's.

138
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,151
Two months from now, do we really
want them thinking our wasn't as nice?

139
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:40,059
It seems to me our friends wouldn't be
there to make petty comparisons.

140
00:06:40,357 --> 00:06:42,108
They'd be there to celebrate our love.

141
00:06:42,374 --> 00:06:44,236
You would think that, but no.

142
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:48,309
Come on. This is something that

143
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,906
we have both
looked forward to for so long.

144
00:06:51,485 --> 00:06:53,299
Don't you want it to be perfect?

145
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,075
I guess.

146
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:56,874
About the doves, though...

147
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,219
What?

148
00:06:59,423 --> 00:07:02,685
You in a wedding gown,
40 birds circling overhead?

149
00:07:02,967 --> 00:07:05,037
Again, not liking those odds.

150
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,092
It's not as bad as it sounds.

151
00:07:11,358 --> 00:07:14,111
It's Hodgkin's lymphoma, and

152
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:18,061
apparently, if you're going to get
lymphoma, that's the kind you want.

153
00:07:18,754 --> 00:07:20,554
Hey, you wanna hold it
down up there, kids?

154
00:07:20,788 --> 00:07:23,479
I'm trying to talk to your
aunt Lucy! Thank you!

155
00:07:24,234 --> 00:07:27,347
Anyway, I know I said that we would
come and visit you this june,

156
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:29,428
but I'll be a little woozy and...

157
00:07:29,679 --> 00:07:31,634
bald from the chemo, so...

158
00:07:33,511 --> 00:07:36,124
Thanks for understanding.
One more thing...

159
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,635
Our insurance policy has
a really high deductible,

160
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:42,756
so we are strapped financially,
and I was wondering

161
00:07:43,069 --> 00:07:45,510
if maybe you and Dave
might be able to...

162
00:07:46,844 --> 00:07:47,877
Really?

163
00:07:51,573 --> 00:07:54,890
No, I am not asking mom.
She doesn't know about any of this,

164
00:07:55,156 --> 00:07:56,893
so don't you tell her, okay?

165
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,145
We'll be fine. I love you. Bye.

166
00:07:59,778 --> 00:08:02,047
I take it that's a "no" on the loan?

167
00:08:03,361 --> 00:08:05,222
Dave lost his job at the plant,

168
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:09,407
and he is now handing out flyers
at a chicken restaurant, and...

169
00:08:09,767 --> 00:08:12,786
Prepare to wince...
there is a chicken suit involved.

170
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,705
So where are we
gonna find this $10,000?

171
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:21,755
You leave that to me.

172
00:08:22,052 --> 00:08:23,758
I want you to focus on getting better.

173
00:08:23,977 --> 00:08:25,588
- But, honey...
- I will find it.

174
00:08:25,995 --> 00:08:28,592
Meanwhile, we'll make some
sacrifices around here.

175
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,086
My tennis club membership
is up this month.

176
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:33,543
I'm not renewing.

177
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:37,219
Should you even be playing tennis
after your back surgery?

178
00:08:38,107 --> 00:08:39,358
Probably not.

179
00:08:40,805 --> 00:08:42,729
Well, in that spirit,

180
00:08:43,026 --> 00:08:45,827
as soon as I start chemo,
I will be giving up shampoo.

181
00:08:49,701 --> 00:08:50,797
Okay, thanks.

182
00:08:51,485 --> 00:08:52,705
Taxi's here.

183
00:08:54,129 --> 00:08:55,841
Are you sure you're
ready to go back?

184
00:08:55,982 --> 00:08:57,233
We could wait another week.

185
00:08:57,453 --> 00:09:00,081
And miss Gaby's wedding?
No, I'll be fine.

186
00:09:03,426 --> 00:09:05,726
Is this the dress you were
thinking for the ceremony?

187
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:07,228
- Yes.
- Good.

188
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:10,099
I'll fold it in tissue
so it doesn't wrinkle.

189
00:09:11,432 --> 00:09:13,153
Darling, I don't deserve you.

190
00:09:14,045 --> 00:09:15,203
Come on.

191
00:09:15,617 --> 00:09:17,667
We agreed...
no more tears.

192
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:20,827
I'm so sorry to be putting
you through this.

193
00:09:21,046 --> 00:09:24,300
I wouldn't blame you if you ran like
hell and never looked back.

194
00:09:24,535 --> 00:09:25,568
Stop.

195
00:09:26,201 --> 00:09:29,565
I'm going to raise this child and
love it as if it were my own.

196
00:09:32,762 --> 00:09:34,091
Now let's see a smile.

197
00:09:42,343 --> 00:09:44,096
I'm glad you could
join us, Milton.

198
00:09:44,205 --> 00:09:46,176
It's good to get to know
you before the wedding.

199
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:47,654
Thank you.
You know, I must say,

200
00:09:47,873 --> 00:09:50,650
all these months, I thought Victor
was exaggerating about you.

201
00:09:50,829 --> 00:09:52,253
But he hasn't done you justice.

202
00:09:52,441 --> 00:09:54,427
You, my dear, are
a flawless beauty.

203
00:09:55,022 --> 00:09:56,899
I'm hardly flawless.

204
00:09:57,157 --> 00:09:59,332
I'm sure I have a blemish
hidden away somewhere.

205
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,106
Now that's a search I would relish.

206
00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:03,610
She is way out of
your league, dad.

207
00:10:04,626 --> 00:10:07,497
Honey, he's a multimillionaire.
He runs my league.

208
00:10:08,995 --> 00:10:11,912
By the way, Victor, I ran into
Keith Perkinson last week.

209
00:10:12,119 --> 00:10:13,778
And how is the venerable
state chairman?

210
00:10:13,926 --> 00:10:14,943
Impressed with you.

211
00:10:15,053 --> 00:10:16,907
He liked the way you ran
your moral campaign,

212
00:10:17,032 --> 00:10:18,800
said if you keep your
numbers up, he might

213
00:10:18,988 --> 00:10:21,241
consider supporting you
in the next Governor's race.

214
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:22,575
Really?

215
00:10:28,431 --> 00:10:29,495
What's so funny?

216
00:10:30,817 --> 00:10:32,045
You gotta be kidding, right?

217
00:10:32,139 --> 00:10:33,626
I mean, we just finished a campaign.

218
00:10:33,654 --> 00:10:35,578
You're not about to put me
through another one.

219
00:10:35,604 --> 00:10:37,153
But I thought you loved campaigning.

220
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:39,109
God, no.
It's a complete snore.

221
00:10:39,335 --> 00:10:40,822
Pasting a smile on
my face while

222
00:10:41,056 --> 00:10:43,019
you say the same speech
for the 50th time?

223
00:10:43,504 --> 00:10:45,623
But you were a natural.
People loved you.

224
00:10:45,983 --> 00:10:47,414
Well, the feeling wasn't mutual.

225
00:10:47,712 --> 00:10:51,013
You think I enjoyed sipping tea
with these frumpy matrons

226
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,563
who wore loud,
probably end pantsuits?

227
00:10:53,776 --> 00:10:55,742
You know how many times
I just wanted to scream,

228
00:10:55,831 --> 00:10:58,178
"Vote for my husband,
you color-blind cow!"?

229
00:10:58,843 --> 00:11:00,329
I think you've discovered something

230
00:11:00,517 --> 00:11:02,254
very important
about democracy, my dear...

231
00:11:02,442 --> 00:11:05,148
The nation is full of fools,
and everyone gets a vote.

232
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:06,923
They're not gonna get us again.

233
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,535
I made nice with Fairview.

234
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:11,215
I'm not about to suck up
to the whole damn state.

235
00:11:20,461 --> 00:11:21,854
What are you doing?

236
00:11:23,907 --> 00:11:26,770
Some guy out in mount pleasant's
got a cracked water heater.

237
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,168
It's 3:00 in the morning.

238
00:11:33,811 --> 00:11:36,392
I started advertising as
a 24-hour plumber.

239
00:11:36,773 --> 00:11:38,353
After midnight, I get triple time.

240
00:11:38,588 --> 00:11:40,966
Okay, that's crazy.
You can't work round the clock.

241
00:11:41,122 --> 00:11:42,123
It's not healthy.

242
00:11:42,303 --> 00:11:44,196
This is the third night
I've worked this week.

243
00:11:44,321 --> 00:11:45,557
I'm fine so far.

244
00:11:46,104 --> 00:11:48,232
You've been sneaking out
while I've been asleep?

245
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:49,999
What are you, ninja plumber?

246
00:11:50,281 --> 00:11:52,941
It's just for a little while,
earn some extra money.

247
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,354
Is this about the wedding?

248
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,313
We agreed we want it to be nice.

249
00:12:04,283 --> 00:12:06,082
But we didn't agree on this.

250
00:12:06,864 --> 00:12:09,469
Maybe I can scale
things back a bit.

251
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:10,830
How?

252
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:12,933
Have a ginger ale fountain?

253
00:12:13,262 --> 00:12:15,233
Make paper doves
and hope it's windy?

254
00:12:15,945 --> 00:12:18,714
Okay, seriously, you don't
have to kill yourself.

255
00:12:19,871 --> 00:12:22,156
I could max out my credit card.

256
00:12:22,765 --> 00:12:25,096
Is that really how you want
to start our life together...

257
00:12:25,268 --> 00:12:26,301
in debt?

258
00:12:26,605 --> 00:12:28,545
No, I wanna start out happy.

259
00:12:29,945 --> 00:12:32,346
But clearly, you're upset,
and I don't know why.

260
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:36,763
I'm not Ian.

261
00:12:37,514 --> 00:12:39,735
I can't afford to move
you into a mansion

262
00:12:40,071 --> 00:12:41,996
or fly you off to Paris,

263
00:12:42,298 --> 00:12:43,862
but I'll be damned
if I don't give you

264
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:46,021
the same dream wedding
he would have given you.

265
00:12:48,274 --> 00:12:49,932
I'll see you in the morning.

266
00:12:54,044 --> 00:12:56,047
I'm drawing pictures of trees.

267
00:12:59,047 --> 00:13:00,627
Where the hell do you get off

268
00:13:00,909 --> 00:13:02,692
having cancer and
not telling me about it?!

269
00:13:02,872 --> 00:13:03,873
Mom...

270
00:13:04,068 --> 00:13:05,640
How do you think
you could handle

271
00:13:05,859 --> 00:13:06,907
this without me?

272
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,081
Stella?

273
00:13:08,558 --> 00:13:10,466
There's my Tommy boy!
Come here!

274
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:13,991
God.

275
00:13:14,304 --> 00:13:17,104
Listen, be a love, will you, honey,
and get my bags from the cab?

276
00:13:17,527 --> 00:13:19,584
Bags? She's staying?

277
00:13:21,012 --> 00:13:22,733
And do not tip the driver.

278
00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:24,939
SOB wouldn't let me smoke.

279
00:13:29,513 --> 00:13:32,595
Jeez, Lynette, I didn't know you
opened a day care center.

280
00:13:33,158 --> 00:13:35,004
Hey, kids, grandma's here.

281
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:40,484
Okay, what did you
tell them about me?

282
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,972
It's been five years, mom.
They don't rember you.

283
00:13:43,441 --> 00:13:45,944
Well, they'll remember me
this time. I brought presents.

284
00:13:46,163 --> 00:13:47,165
Cool!

285
00:13:47,908 --> 00:13:49,003
For you,

286
00:13:49,402 --> 00:13:50,606
and... you,

287
00:13:51,138 --> 00:13:52,187
and you.

288
00:13:52,812 --> 00:13:54,173
These are baby toys.

289
00:13:54,408 --> 00:13:55,910
We're too old to play with these.

290
00:13:56,191 --> 00:13:58,961
I'm too old to remember what the hell
6-year-olds like to play with.

291
00:13:59,352 --> 00:14:00,416
We're 8.

292
00:14:01,456 --> 00:14:02,660
What do I care?

293
00:14:03,224 --> 00:14:04,694
Just say thank you.

294
00:14:05,023 --> 00:14:06,060
Thank you.

295
00:14:07,062 --> 00:14:08,986
Who's the pretty thing?

296
00:14:09,252 --> 00:14:10,347
Your girlfriend?

297
00:14:11,528 --> 00:14:12,733
She's my sister!

298
00:14:15,819 --> 00:14:17,759
Is that Tom's little b-a-s-t-a...

299
00:14:18,119 --> 00:14:21,049
Okay, kids, time to get your toys
and let's play upstairs.

300
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:23,177
Come on, Penny.
Come on, sweetie.

301
00:14:23,795 --> 00:14:25,203
Let's go, everybody.

302
00:14:30,206 --> 00:14:32,365
Listen, mom, I really appreciate
you coming to help,

303
00:14:32,522 --> 00:14:34,258
but as you can see,
I'm perfectly fine.

304
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,261
For now.

305
00:14:36,472 --> 00:14:38,052
Now how you gonna handle
that mob when

306
00:14:38,365 --> 00:14:40,149
you're flat on
your ass from chemo?

307
00:14:40,931 --> 00:14:42,135
I'll manage.

308
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:45,671
You got through breast cancer while
raising the three of us alone.

309
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,911
I was not alone.

310
00:14:48,396 --> 00:14:49,460
I had you.

311
00:14:49,953 --> 00:14:53,739
Lynette was all of 13, and
she still looked after her sisters,

312
00:14:53,982 --> 00:14:55,492
cleaned the house,
cooked the meals,

313
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:58,323
and I was curled up in
a ball, puking my guts out.

314
00:14:58,628 --> 00:15:01,523
Well, that's what you get when
you mix chemo and vodka gimlets.

315
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:05,611
You can goad me
all you like, Lynette.

316
00:15:05,884 --> 00:15:07,386
I did not come here to fight.

317
00:15:08,168 --> 00:15:09,724
Now trust me, Cookie,

318
00:15:10,272 --> 00:15:12,885
I have memorized the whole
catalog of subjects

319
00:15:13,182 --> 00:15:16,123
you and I can no longer
discuss, and if that means

320
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,814
that we have to talk about
the weather for three months,

321
00:15:19,315 --> 00:15:20,378
then fine.

322
00:15:20,746 --> 00:15:22,717
But I am staying.

323
00:15:23,491 --> 00:15:24,508
Now...

324
00:15:24,977 --> 00:15:28,341
If you'll excuse me, I have to go
kick a child out of its room.

325
00:15:37,545 --> 00:15:38,562
Okay.

326
00:15:39,187 --> 00:15:40,220
Legs up!

327
00:15:41,135 --> 00:15:42,683
You wanna do it again?

328
00:15:45,108 --> 00:15:47,141
I've been doing a lot of research,

329
00:15:47,439 --> 00:15:49,262
and gravity helps facilitate

330
00:15:49,528 --> 00:15:51,217
the sperm reaching the eggs.

331
00:15:51,585 --> 00:15:53,102
So... heave-ho!

332
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,251
Could we try a little light spooning

333
00:15:56,517 --> 00:15:58,316
before you hang me up
like a side of beef?

334
00:15:58,895 --> 00:16:00,475
Edie, we're trying to have a baby.

335
00:16:00,851 --> 00:16:02,791
Well, could we be
a little less clinical?

336
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:05,466
Maybe let nature take its course?

337
00:16:06,452 --> 00:16:08,955
Nature is not on our side anymore.

338
00:16:10,574 --> 00:16:12,060
Look, you're no spring chicken, and

339
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:13,843
those eggs aren't exactly farm-fresh.

340
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,706
Stop referring
to me as poultry.

341
00:16:17,691 --> 00:16:20,539
Sorry. Can we just try this?
It's only for 30 minutes.

342
00:16:20,985 --> 00:16:22,315
30 minutes?!
I am not staying

343
00:16:22,471 --> 00:16:23,926
in this position
for a half an hour

344
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,805
Listen, I know that
this requires some work,

345
00:16:27,624 --> 00:16:31,128
but it will all be worth it when
we have our beautiful, beautiful baby.

346
00:16:31,394 --> 00:16:32,395
Right?

347
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:38,960
Right.

348
00:16:39,672 --> 00:16:41,017
I guess I could...

349
00:16:41,431 --> 00:16:43,231
make some sacrifices.

350
00:16:43,825 --> 00:16:45,014
That's my girl.

351
00:16:46,718 --> 00:16:48,010
Can I get you anything?

352
00:16:48,486 --> 00:16:50,020
I'd kill for a beer.

353
00:16:50,434 --> 00:16:51,967
- Sorry. No alcohol.
- What?!

354
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,523
For how long?

355
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,659
Just until the baby's born.
And you stop nursing.

356
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:00,219
Don't worry. I'll get you
a nice herbal tea.

357
00:17:04,234 --> 00:17:07,089
It's just for a few months
while you're in treatment.

358
00:17:07,304 --> 00:17:09,573
We're gonna have to find
someone to watch the kids.

359
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:13,015
I am not leaving that woman
in charge of our children.

360
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:15,552
In three months, the twins
will be chain-smoking, and

361
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,456
Penny will be an alcoholic.

362
00:17:17,722 --> 00:17:20,429
We can manage.
We've got Mccluskey.

363
00:17:20,694 --> 00:17:22,528
She costs money...
money that we won't have

364
00:17:22,638 --> 00:17:24,562
if we're paying someone
to replace you at work.

365
00:17:24,797 --> 00:17:27,418
You said not to worry about money,
that you'd find it somewhere.

366
00:17:27,715 --> 00:17:28,763
I did.

367
00:17:29,937 --> 00:17:32,048
What, someone loaned us $10,000?

368
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:33,457
No, gave us,

369
00:17:33,731 --> 00:17:36,234
and we can't thank her
by kicking her out.

370
00:17:37,248 --> 00:17:40,565
No! Tom, you didn't
ask my mother?!

371
00:17:40,971 --> 00:17:44,030
Didn't have to. She knew that
you hit up Lucy, so she offered.

372
00:17:44,249 --> 00:17:45,728
We're giving it back.

373
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,464
No, we can't afford to.

374
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,630
You don't know half
the stuff she did to us.

375
00:17:51,865 --> 00:17:54,791
She would get drunk
and smack us around.

376
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:57,372
She would meet some
new guy and then drop us off

377
00:17:57,513 --> 00:17:59,766
at her sister's for a week
because he wasn't into kids.

378
00:17:59,969 --> 00:18:01,393
So she was a crappy mom.

379
00:18:01,815 --> 00:18:03,881
<i>You said yourself that
she has mellowed.

380
00:18:04,245 --> 00:18:05,809
<i>Now she wants to make amends.

381
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,812
<i>If you would just try
to understand...

382
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:10,722
I think that I've been pretty
understanding lately.

383
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:12,609
What's that supposed to mean?

384
00:18:13,563 --> 00:18:14,705
I think you know.

385
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:17,552
Great, so in the middle of
everything I'm dealing with,

386
00:18:17,724 --> 00:18:19,169
you're gonna throw
Rick in my face.

387
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:21,990
When someone we love hurts us,
if we still love them,

388
00:18:22,607 --> 00:18:24,970
<i>we deal with it and
we move on.

389
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:28,191
If I can do it, so can you.

390
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:32,228
So forgiving my mother...

391
00:18:32,983 --> 00:18:34,376
That's my penance?

392
00:18:36,691 --> 00:18:37,990
I think it is.

393
00:18:51,273 --> 00:18:52,884
I thought you said
we weren't supposed to spend

394
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:54,214
the night before
the wedding together.

395
00:18:54,918 --> 00:18:56,983
I was trying to respect tradition...

396
00:18:57,891 --> 00:18:59,299
But I got horny.

397
00:19:02,894 --> 00:19:05,710
I guess we'll just have to start
the honeymoon early, won't we?

398
00:19:05,992 --> 00:19:07,666
Let me get rid of this stuff.

399
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:09,778
What are you working
on so late?

400
00:19:10,185 --> 00:19:11,280
Nothing.

401
00:19:12,899 --> 00:19:13,900
Polling data?

402
00:19:14,267 --> 00:19:16,019
Why are you polling?
The election's over.

403
00:19:16,254 --> 00:19:18,338
It's just a little research.
God, you look hot.

404
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:19,981
Is this about running for Governor?

405
00:19:20,184 --> 00:19:22,140
Because I told you
how I feel about that.

406
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,566
My dad just set up a little...
Exploratory committee.

407
00:19:25,723 --> 00:19:26,740
It's no big deal.

408
00:19:27,131 --> 00:19:28,539
Well, let's explore it now.

409
00:19:29,595 --> 00:19:30,784
Nope, not gonna happen.

410
00:19:31,582 --> 00:19:34,672
Victor, ever since we met,
it's been photo ops and

411
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:36,526
fund-raisers,
and I'm sick of it.

412
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,763
I'm a politician.
Do you think I want my career

413
00:19:39,091 --> 00:19:40,507
to begin and end
in the suburbs?

414
00:19:40,632 --> 00:19:42,681
Fairview is my home,
and I don't want to leave it.

415
00:19:42,705 --> 00:19:45,474
And you can't make this decision
without me. I'm gonna be your wife.

416
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:47,031
Exactly, not my career adviser.

417
00:19:47,172 --> 00:19:49,259
- So I don't even get a vote?
- Not if it's a veto.

418
00:19:49,358 --> 00:19:51,471
Look, no!
I already married a man

419
00:19:51,659 --> 00:19:54,553
who put his career before me,
and I swore I wasn't gonna do it again.

420
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:57,940
I swore I would not let
a stupid woman hold me back.

421
00:20:03,604 --> 00:20:06,232
That did not come out
the way I wanted it to.

422
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,377
I'm sorry.

423
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:10,933
I'm sor...
I'm really sorry.

424
00:20:11,121 --> 00:20:13,005
I've just been under
a lot of pressure lately.

425
00:20:13,201 --> 00:20:15,595
Here's one less thing
you have to worry about...

426
00:20:16,096 --> 00:20:17,206
our wedding.

427
00:20:17,598 --> 00:20:20,132
You can't cancel the wedding.
It's too late.

428
00:20:20,828 --> 00:20:23,410
As far as I'm concerned,
it's just in the nick of time.

429
00:20:35,427 --> 00:20:36,692
Good morning, Gaby.

430
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:39,711
God, Milton, the newspaper's
not even here yet.

431
00:20:40,071 --> 00:20:41,823
I'm sorry it's so early.
I just...

432
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,794
came to apologize.

433
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,454
Why? What happened
wasn't your fault.

434
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:49,301
That's not exactly the case.

435
00:20:50,091 --> 00:20:52,125
Is that coffee I smell?

436
00:20:55,747 --> 00:20:58,641
You only bolted because
Victor wants to be Governor.

437
00:20:59,048 --> 00:21:01,051
He only wants to be
Governor because of me.

438
00:21:01,449 --> 00:21:03,280
You only suggested it.
You can't make him go

439
00:21:03,475 --> 00:21:04,820
after something
he doesn't want.

440
00:21:05,149 --> 00:21:06,416
The hell I can't.

441
00:21:07,636 --> 00:21:09,896
Ever since he was a kid,
Victor's been killing himself

442
00:21:10,162 --> 00:21:12,376
trying to live up to
his big shot father.

443
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:14,832
He's desperate for my approval.

444
00:21:15,521 --> 00:21:16,553
Why?

445
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:19,252
I suppose because
he's never gotten it.

446
00:21:20,026 --> 00:21:21,927
Everything he does...
even becoming mayor...

447
00:21:22,162 --> 00:21:24,368
I'm let him know that
it's not quite enough.

448
00:21:27,048 --> 00:21:28,299
Don't get me wrong.

449
00:21:28,706 --> 00:21:31,319
I'm right to push.
That's why he's so successful.

450
00:21:32,492 --> 00:21:34,683
So what are you saying,
I should marry Victor because

451
00:21:34,909 --> 00:21:36,255
you're a with holding father?

452
00:21:36,513 --> 00:21:39,814
No, I just want you to understand
why he does what he does.

453
00:21:41,362 --> 00:21:42,677
Fine. I get it.

454
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,910
But why would I want
a husband who values

455
00:21:45,113 --> 00:21:46,944
his father's opinion
more than mine?

456
00:21:47,929 --> 00:21:50,964
Well, he doesn't really care
much what I think anymore.

457
00:21:51,331 --> 00:21:53,412
After you left last night,
he called me and...

458
00:21:53,709 --> 00:21:55,680
What's the phrase?
"tore me a new one"?

459
00:21:57,124 --> 00:21:58,141
He did?

460
00:21:59,487 --> 00:22:01,411
He said because of me,
he'd lost the best thing

461
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:02,913
that had ever
happened to him,

462
00:22:03,163 --> 00:22:05,729
and if he coul't win you back,
I could take my money

463
00:22:06,144 --> 00:22:07,661
and buy a new son,

464
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:11,039
because I was never gonna
be hearing from him again.

465
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,278
He blew off $80 million?

466
00:22:17,138 --> 00:22:18,671
If he cares about me
so damn much,

467
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:20,861
why am I not hearing
this from him?

468
00:22:22,082 --> 00:22:23,443
I think you're about to.

469
00:22:29,862 --> 00:22:31,786
Is there a back way out of here?

470
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,710
Aren't you gonna be late
for Gaby's wedding?

471
00:22:52,367 --> 00:22:53,760
Weddings are boring.

472
00:22:54,197 --> 00:22:56,630
I like to sneak in at the end,
look teary-eyed and

473
00:22:56,927 --> 00:22:58,468
pretend I was there
the whole time.

474
00:22:59,015 --> 00:23:00,814
I am gonna see you
at the reception.

475
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:05,778
Hi, Danny.

476
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,501
Carlos, the paperboy's here.
Could you pay him?

477
00:23:09,892 --> 00:23:11,128
Come on in.

478
00:23:13,584 --> 00:23:15,352
Hey, here you go, Danny.

479
00:23:20,787 --> 00:23:22,289
looks like I'm a little short.

480
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,510
Can I catch you later?

481
00:23:27,123 --> 00:23:28,656
Okay. Hold on.

482
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,139
My God.

483
00:23:44,984 --> 00:23:46,188
What's that?

484
00:23:47,362 --> 00:23:48,879
It's birth control pills.

485
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:51,820
I'm gonna need cash.

486
00:23:54,938 --> 00:23:56,190
Welcome home!

487
00:23:56,503 --> 00:23:58,036
I have missed you, sweetheart!

488
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:01,728
Here, allow me.

489
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,747
Hello there, Julie.

490
00:24:06,225 --> 00:24:07,383
You guys are back!

491
00:24:08,314 --> 00:24:09,816
Somebody's... blonder.

492
00:24:10,465 --> 00:24:12,562
Yeah, my mom hates it, too.

493
00:24:13,054 --> 00:24:14,540
So where's Danielle?

494
00:24:16,453 --> 00:24:19,144
While we were in switzerland,
she ran across this boarding school,

495
00:24:19,402 --> 00:24:21,514
and she fell in love with it
and just insisted

496
00:24:21,757 --> 00:24:23,854
that we let her spend
a year abroad.

497
00:24:25,394 --> 00:24:27,154
She must be having
a really good time.

498
00:24:27,436 --> 00:24:29,290
She hasn't returned any
of my phone calls.

499
00:24:30,953 --> 00:24:33,034
You know, her school's
up in the mountains, and...

500
00:24:33,253 --> 00:24:35,365
and her cell phone
reception is kind of funky.

501
00:24:36,163 --> 00:24:38,119
She hasn't answered
my e-mails, either.

502
00:24:39,234 --> 00:24:40,767
Well, I am gonna call
her tonight and

503
00:24:40,923 --> 00:24:43,161
have a little talk with her
about common courtesy, and

504
00:24:43,286 --> 00:24:46,031
I'm sure that you will get an e-mail
first thing tomorrow morning.

505
00:24:47,522 --> 00:24:50,479
We should go. I've got to get that
bracelet to Gaby before the wedding.

506
00:24:50,683 --> 00:24:52,310
I'll see you guys there. Bye.

507
00:24:55,983 --> 00:24:57,751
Well, that was uncomfortable.

508
00:24:58,048 --> 00:25:00,646
You have no idea. Everyone's
been asking questions.

509
00:25:01,318 --> 00:25:03,571
This might not be
as easy as we'd hoped.

510
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,422
There. Now you have
something new.

511
00:25:18,947 --> 00:25:20,387
So how do I look?

512
00:25:20,692 --> 00:25:24,353
You are now officially the most
beautiful bride that ever lived.

513
00:25:24,908 --> 00:25:26,332
Until your wedding,
of course.

514
00:25:26,488 --> 00:25:27,490
Nice save.

515
00:25:28,984 --> 00:25:32,379
It means so much to me that
we're all here together right now.

516
00:25:37,191 --> 00:25:38,396
And... break!

517
00:25:40,884 --> 00:25:41,885
Love you.

518
00:25:53,948 --> 00:25:56,561
We are gathered here
today to join together

519
00:25:56,802 --> 00:25:59,556
Victor Lang and Gabrielle Marquez
in matrimony...

520
00:26:00,338 --> 00:26:02,732
an honorable estate not
to be entered in lightly,

521
00:26:03,045 --> 00:26:04,922
but reverently and soberly.

522
00:26:05,681 --> 00:26:07,613
<i>This is a lifetime union...

523
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,497
<i>One based on love,
honor and trust...

524
00:26:10,794 --> 00:26:12,280
You wanna be
my new best friend?

525
00:26:12,593 --> 00:26:14,565
Premium scotch.
Keep it coming.

526
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:17,670
<i>You are promising not
only to give of yourself,

527
00:26:17,999 --> 00:26:20,830
<i>but also to accept each other,
promising not only

528
00:26:21,096 --> 00:26:24,084
<i>to love for today, but to extend
that love to include...

529
00:26:24,929 --> 00:26:26,696
I thought you weren't
coming until after...

530
00:26:26,778 --> 00:26:27,783
Save it.

531
00:26:30,276 --> 00:26:31,957
Okay, look, I can explain...

532
00:26:32,161 --> 00:26:33,334
Don't bother!

533
00:26:34,523 --> 00:26:36,455
Your lies were more
convincing when I cared.

534
00:26:38,489 --> 00:26:40,413
<i>Victor, do you take Gabrielle...

535
00:26:42,576 --> 00:26:43,812
<i>...in good times and bad...

536
00:26:43,985 --> 00:26:47,067
You've got to understand.
I do wanna have a baby with you,

537
00:26:47,364 --> 00:26:48,756
just not yet. I...

538
00:26:49,194 --> 00:26:52,824
I just... I wanted to give you a chance
to fall in love with me first.

539
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:55,710
I don't believe you, and
I will never trust you again!

540
00:26:55,984 --> 00:26:57,517
What was I supposed to do?

541
00:26:57,837 --> 00:26:59,503
You backed me into a corner,

542
00:26:59,769 --> 00:27:01,380
and you were gonna
bail on us,

543
00:27:01,615 --> 00:27:04,048
and I was just trying
to save what we had.

544
00:27:05,659 --> 00:27:06,942
Don't leave me.

545
00:27:08,842 --> 00:27:10,297
Please just talk to me.

546
00:27:10,641 --> 00:27:12,300
I am done with you.

547
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:18,048
Ladies a gentlemen,
I present to you

548
00:27:18,314 --> 00:27:20,176
Mr. and Mrs. Victor Lang.

549
00:27:20,364 --> 00:27:21,631
I'm sorry!

550
00:27:34,202 --> 00:27:35,265
Enjoy the wedding?

551
00:27:35,461 --> 00:27:37,072
Nice. Very classy.

552
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:40,753
Although what the hell was that
brouhaha between Carlos and Edie?

553
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,779
I don't know and I don't care.

554
00:27:43,013 --> 00:27:46,236
Today, I'm so filled with love,
I can forgive anyone anything.

555
00:27:47,573 --> 00:27:50,061
But if you do see
them again, call security.

556
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:54,082
So we're in Zurich, and
I sick after breakfast

557
00:27:54,371 --> 00:27:56,694
for the third morning in a row.
And I thought to myself,

558
00:27:56,937 --> 00:28:00,472
dear God, I hope I have not developed
an allergy to chocolate brioche.

559
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:02,748
Life just wouldn't be worth living.

560
00:28:03,859 --> 00:28:06,143
So I said, that's it.
We're seeing a doctor.

561
00:28:06,761 --> 00:28:09,081
Well, you could've knocked us
over that feather when

562
00:28:09,378 --> 00:28:11,193
he said she was already
two months pregnant.

563
00:28:11,757 --> 00:28:14,479
I think it's so great, and
we could not be happier for you.

564
00:28:14,722 --> 00:28:16,834
- When's your due date?
- Not until the early fall,

565
00:28:17,022 --> 00:28:18,680
but enough about me.
This is your day...

566
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,293
You and Victor... who,
by the way, I have not met yet.

567
00:28:21,551 --> 00:28:22,927
My gosh, that's right.

568
00:28:23,162 --> 00:28:25,454
Okay, you stay here.
I'm gonna go grab him.

569
00:28:28,212 --> 00:28:30,622
It is so good to be back.

570
00:28:30,997 --> 00:28:32,890
I can't believe how much
is happening. I mean,

571
00:28:33,047 --> 00:28:34,564
you and Gaby getting
married, and

572
00:28:34,783 --> 00:28:36,551
and I'm having a baby.

573
00:28:36,958 --> 00:28:38,827
What's going on
with you, Lynette?

574
00:28:39,923 --> 00:28:41,831
Nothing.
Same old, same old.

575
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,546
Really? Is everything
okay, sweetie?

576
00:28:44,749 --> 00:28:47,617
'cause you haven't quite seemed
yourself the last couple weeks.

577
00:28:48,102 --> 00:28:50,386
I'm fine.
Everything's just fine.

578
00:28:53,124 --> 00:28:55,220
I'll tell you this much...
I'm exhausted.

579
00:28:55,791 --> 00:28:57,825
I'll be glad when
this day is over.

580
00:28:58,248 --> 00:28:59,781
Well, it was all worth it.

581
00:29:00,469 --> 00:29:03,207
Marrying Gaby is the smartest
thing you've ever done.

582
00:29:03,598 --> 00:29:05,123
With her bringing
in the latino vote,

583
00:29:05,264 --> 00:29:07,000
the Governor's mansion's
as good as yours.

584
00:29:07,313 --> 00:29:09,378
Well, that's assuming
I can change her mind.

585
00:29:09,596 --> 00:29:12,256
I had to make certain concessions
just to get her down the aisle.

586
00:29:12,553 --> 00:29:14,994
You're the husband now.
The rules have changed.

587
00:29:15,377 --> 00:29:17,488
Be nice, buy her
a few pretty things.

588
00:29:17,786 --> 00:29:20,962
Trust me, you'll be able
to tame that little Spitfire.

589
00:29:21,525 --> 00:29:24,654
I'm not too worried. I've always
been able to manage my assets.

590
00:29:36,955 --> 00:29:38,253
Did you find him?

591
00:29:39,849 --> 00:29:42,415
No, I'm still looking,
but I'll let you know.

592
00:29:49,483 --> 00:29:53,113
Movie's over.
And may I add... amen.

593
00:29:53,966 --> 00:29:56,297
Go out and play.
Go on, go on. Out!

594
00:30:01,042 --> 00:30:02,763
They're just gonna go play guns.

595
00:30:03,021 --> 00:30:04,523
Can I watch another movie?

596
00:30:04,859 --> 00:30:07,596
Lynette said one was the limit,
and she'll be home soon.

597
00:30:07,862 --> 00:30:09,067
No, she won't.

598
00:30:09,395 --> 00:30:10,819
When ever they go out
to a party,

599
00:30:11,022 --> 00:30:13,072
they always come home
at least an hour later

600
00:30:13,306 --> 00:30:14,589
than they say they will.

601
00:30:15,798 --> 00:30:18,568
Aren't you an observant
little monkey?

602
00:30:20,774 --> 00:30:22,213
Tell me, sweetie...

603
00:30:23,394 --> 00:30:26,554
would you know anything
about a man named Rick?

604
00:30:28,139 --> 00:30:29,375
I know Rick.

605
00:30:29,688 --> 00:30:32,043
My daddy and Lynette had
a big fight about him.

606
00:30:32,278 --> 00:30:33,357
Really?

607
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:37,644
Sounds like there's maybe
a little story there.

608
00:30:38,441 --> 00:30:39,740
If I tell you,

609
00:30:40,318 --> 00:30:42,681
could I watch a really
good grown-up movie?

610
00:30:44,797 --> 00:30:47,676
If it's a really
good grown-up story.

611
00:30:51,353 --> 00:30:53,465
Okay, I got you some
appetizers to tide you over.

612
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,655
We have mini quiches and
beef satay and

613
00:30:55,864 --> 00:30:58,352
something called "crystal coast
shrimp with grits,"

614
00:30:58,618 --> 00:31:02,044
but it's mostly just grits 'cause
I ate all the shrimp on my way over.

615
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:20,490
Reverend, that was such
a beautiful ceremony.

616
00:31:20,834 --> 00:31:23,728
Really, just heartfelt and
moving... the whole package.

617
00:31:23,979 --> 00:31:24,980
Why, thank you.

618
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,826
It was really impressive.

619
00:31:27,107 --> 00:31:28,969
So what are you doing tonight?

620
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:41,525
Didn't know you were in here.

621
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,324
I got a little thirsty.

622
00:31:45,139 --> 00:31:46,594
I can see that.

623
00:31:48,174 --> 00:31:51,214
Gaby, I am sorry if
I ruined your wedding.

624
00:31:53,373 --> 00:31:56,267
But if it's any consolation,
I also ruined my life.

625
00:31:57,863 --> 00:31:59,850
What are you talking about?

626
00:32:00,788 --> 00:32:03,041
A couple years ago,
I was totally happy.

627
00:32:03,862 --> 00:32:06,866
I had a home, you, a great career.

628
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:11,161
And I don't understand
how I let it all go to hell.

629
00:32:13,567 --> 00:32:15,866
And now here I am,
back at square one.

630
00:32:18,792 --> 00:32:20,466
I really blew it.

631
00:32:25,328 --> 00:32:26,689
What am I doing?

632
00:32:27,565 --> 00:32:30,193
I shouldn't be dumping this
on you. It's your wedding day.

633
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,337
Go to Victor.

634
00:32:33,627 --> 00:32:35,395
I'm gonna stay right here...

635
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:44,917
Well,

636
00:32:45,026 --> 00:32:47,044
I don't know how you did it.
The kids are asleep,

637
00:32:47,185 --> 00:32:49,094
and the cough syrup
hasn't been touched.

638
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:53,325
Boy, you're just waiting for
an excuse to give me the boot.

639
00:32:53,786 --> 00:32:56,775
Well, if history's any indicator,
I won't have to wait long.

640
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,112
So you don't think
people can change?

641
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:05,634
I think at a certain point,
people just are

642
00:33:05,869 --> 00:33:06,932
who they are.

643
00:33:08,363 --> 00:33:10,663
Well, I think people can change.

644
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:12,619
Now take you.

645
00:33:13,416 --> 00:33:15,653
You were the perfect wife and mom...

646
00:33:16,372 --> 00:33:18,359
Then along came Rick.

647
00:33:21,523 --> 00:33:23,682
- How did you...
- Come on, Lynette.

648
00:33:24,277 --> 00:33:26,123
You kids were young when
I was sneaking around on Glen,

649
00:33:26,358 --> 00:33:28,188
but you knew
something was up.

650
00:33:29,611 --> 00:33:31,489
You heard about this from my kids?

651
00:33:31,708 --> 00:33:32,819
Just the girl,

652
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,969
and all she knows is that

653
00:33:35,282 --> 00:33:38,286
daddy got mad
because Rick "liked" you.

654
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,540
Nothing happened
between me and Rick.

655
00:33:43,884 --> 00:33:46,629
Yes, he came on to me,
but unlike you,

656
00:33:46,801 --> 00:33:48,155
I controlled myself.

657
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,928
Well, you had Tom
to come home to.

658
00:33:52,352 --> 00:33:53,932
I had your stepfather.

659
00:33:54,417 --> 00:33:56,325
Hey, Glen may have
bored you, but the years

660
00:33:56,497 --> 00:33:58,922
we had a father in that house
were the happiest in my life.

661
00:33:59,094 --> 00:34:00,909
You didn't care about that,
though, did you?

662
00:34:01,097 --> 00:34:02,302
You just drove him away.

663
00:34:02,912 --> 00:34:06,588
And you couldn't wait
to pay me back.

664
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:09,491
Do you remember what
you said the next year

665
00:34:09,773 --> 00:34:10,977
when I got sick?

666
00:34:11,869 --> 00:34:13,183
No I don't.

667
00:34:13,582 --> 00:34:14,614
Liar.

668
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:17,696
You said I earned it.

669
00:34:18,619 --> 00:34:20,387
It was God's punishment.

670
00:34:22,264 --> 00:34:24,361
How are you feeling now, Lynette?

671
00:34:25,761 --> 00:34:27,481
You think you're being punished?

672
00:34:30,091 --> 00:34:31,593
How can you say that?

673
00:34:32,094 --> 00:34:34,738
You were so sanctimonious.

674
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:37,186
You could not imagine
what sort of woman

675
00:34:37,437 --> 00:34:38,853
could do that kind of thing.

676
00:34:39,197 --> 00:34:41,513
Not so hard
to imagine now, is it?

677
00:34:41,833 --> 00:34:43,413
Stop comparing us.

678
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:45,087
I never did what you did.

679
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,841
No, you just wanted to.

680
00:34:50,351 --> 00:34:51,915
You're leaving tomorrow.

681
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:54,825
I don't want your money.
I don't want you imy house.

682
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:58,024
You are sick, Lynette.

683
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:00,910
You think you know
what you're in for

684
00:35:01,161 --> 00:35:02,882
'cause you watched
me go through it?

685
00:35:03,687 --> 00:35:05,393
Watching it is nothing.

686
00:35:06,331 --> 00:35:08,177
You are going to feel
worse than you thought

687
00:35:08,537 --> 00:35:11,619
a person could feel,
and I'll be holding your hand

688
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:13,888
through every damn minute.

689
00:35:16,153 --> 00:35:18,836
You can't stay if
I don't want you here.

690
00:35:19,196 --> 00:35:21,918
You can fight me or
you can fight the cancer.

691
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,772
Trust me,

692
00:35:24,281 --> 00:35:26,409
you won't have
the strength to do both.

693
00:35:34,064 --> 00:35:36,317
<i>Hi, Julie, it's me, Danielle!
Sorry I didn't write you.

694
00:35:36,536 --> 00:35:39,231
<i>My new school is
Switzerland is AWESOME.

695
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,915
Do young people
still say "awesome"?

696
00:35:45,213 --> 00:35:46,417
Not so much.

697
00:35:46,965 --> 00:35:48,294
Try "off the hook."

698
00:35:48,623 --> 00:35:50,766
"Off the hook"?
That doesn't even make sense.

699
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:53,598
Fine, ty in "groovy".
See if I care.

700
00:35:59,467 --> 00:36:01,141
Hello? Hodge residence.

701
00:36:02,173 --> 00:36:05,373
Hi, Danielle. Listen, I am sending
Julie Mayer an e-mail from you.

702
00:36:05,592 --> 00:36:09,352
Now would you say that
your school was "off the hook"?

703
00:36:10,196 --> 00:36:12,136
No. I would say it was sucky

704
00:36:12,441 --> 00:36:15,007
or crappy or
a freaking nightmare.

705
00:36:15,418 --> 00:36:18,062
Look, if you're gonna start complaining,
I'm going to hang up.

706
00:36:18,375 --> 00:36:20,542
<i>Mom, you have got</i>
to talk to the nuns.

707
00:36:20,839 --> 00:36:23,733
They are so harsh with me, and
they have all these stupid rules.

708
00:36:24,077 --> 00:36:26,283
Well, perhaps if some of
those rules had been in place

709
00:36:26,471 --> 00:36:27,957
when you took up
with Edie's nephew,

710
00:36:28,114 --> 00:36:29,718
you might not be
in this little pickle.

711
00:36:30,109 --> 00:36:32,408
Mom, please, I just
wanna come home.

712
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:34,943
<i>Look, I am gonna say
this one last time.

713
00:36:35,357 --> 00:36:37,986
You are gonna stay put
until that baby is born.

714
00:36:38,994 --> 00:36:41,012
Now don't forget,
we're driving up this weekend,

715
00:36:41,106 --> 00:36:42,483
and I am bringing your favorite...

716
00:36:42,647 --> 00:36:43,726
<i>Lemon squares, and...

717
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:48,185
Darling...

718
00:36:48,576 --> 00:36:49,859
Can I draw you a bath?

719
00:36:50,328 --> 00:36:51,862
That would be lovely.

720
00:36:55,395 --> 00:36:57,428
Would you give me
a hand, please?

721
00:37:01,892 --> 00:37:02,909
Here we go.

722
00:37:07,044 --> 00:37:09,000
It's almost time for
the 6 month size.

723
00:37:09,276 --> 00:37:10,575
Don't remind me.

724
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,024
No. No, it's no problem.
I can fix that for you.

725
00:37:18,806 --> 00:37:21,059
Just give me your name
and address.

726
00:37:21,309 --> 00:37:24,751
<i>I'm Mrs. Emmeline Walcott,
and I'm at 42 old mill road.

727
00:37:25,291 --> 00:37:27,747
I gotta stop and pick up
a Douglas valve,

728
00:37:28,044 --> 00:37:31,064
But I should be there
in 45 minutes tops.

729
00:37:34,354 --> 00:37:36,795
I hate to see you drive
when you're this tired.

730
00:37:37,686 --> 00:37:39,736
There's some iced coffee
in the fridge.

731
00:37:40,393 --> 00:37:41,566
I'll be fine.

732
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,732
See you when I get back.

733
00:37:52,986 --> 00:37:54,003
You were great.

734
00:37:54,175 --> 00:37:55,473
Did y'all ever doubt I would be?

735
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:57,945
Just hurry up and get dressed.
We only have 45 minutes.

736
00:38:14,521 --> 00:38:15,570
Are you Mike?

737
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:18,464
I'm looking for a
Mrs. Walcott's house.

738
00:38:18,722 --> 00:38:20,192
You've come to the right place.

739
00:38:20,474 --> 00:38:21,965
Here, put this on.

740
00:38:22,121 --> 00:38:23,389
<i>Wear me.
Love, Susan.

741
00:38:29,604 --> 00:38:31,685
You mind telling me
what Susan's up to?

742
00:38:31,967 --> 00:38:33,344
Ask her yourself.

743
00:38:53,812 --> 00:38:55,533
Are you sure about this?

744
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:57,692
I don't want you to look back and

745
00:38:58,357 --> 00:39:00,782
regret not having
your perfect wedding.

746
00:39:01,126 --> 00:39:03,269
Well, I don't know if
you've noticed, but my idea

747
00:39:03,535 --> 00:39:05,569
of the perfect wedding
keeps changing.

748
00:39:07,333 --> 00:39:10,619
One day, I want white roses,
and then I want lies, and

749
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:14,311
and first, I want a harpist,
and then a string quartet.

750
00:39:15,664 --> 00:39:17,854
Only one thing stays constant...

751
00:39:19,067 --> 00:39:20,772
And I'm looking at him.

752
00:39:25,048 --> 00:39:28,474
Why would I need anything else
to make my wedding perfect?

753
00:39:32,318 --> 00:39:35,134
Well, who knew down sizing
could be so romantic?

754
00:39:38,796 --> 00:39:40,673
Mrs. Walcott, I presume?

755
00:39:41,064 --> 00:39:42,284
That's right, sugar.

756
00:39:45,124 --> 00:39:47,424
You might wanna check that
breast pocket of your suit.

757
00:39:55,123 --> 00:39:57,188
And just so you know,
you'll be paying for those

758
00:39:57,423 --> 00:39:59,152
and the lights and
the flowers.

759
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,680
I've never seen you
look so beautiful.

760
00:40:07,245 --> 00:40:09,436
You clean up pretty good
yourself.

761
00:40:19,828 --> 00:40:20,938
Are we ready?

762
00:40:21,334 --> 00:40:24,197
Are you kidding? They've been dragging
this thing out for three years.

763
00:40:30,899 --> 00:40:32,510
We are gathered here today

764
00:40:32,933 --> 00:40:36,938
to join together Mike Delfino and
Susan Mayer in matrimony,

765
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:40,575
an honorable estate not
to be entered into lightly,

766
00:40:40,911 --> 00:40:42,929
but reverently and soberly...

767
00:40:47,133 --> 00:40:48,260
<i>Family...

768
00:40:48,713 --> 00:40:51,326
<i>there is nothing more important.

769
00:40:53,302 --> 00:40:56,697
<i>They're the ones who show up
when we're in trouble...

770
00:40:58,735 --> 00:41:01,536
<i>the ones who push us to succeed...

771
00:41:04,806 --> 00:41:06,339
<i>the ones who help

772
00:41:06,863 --> 00:41:08,521
<i>keep our secrets.

773
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:15,540
<i>But what of those who have
no family to rely on?

774
00:41:15,853 --> 00:41:17,715
<i>To My Beloved Carlos.

775
00:41:19,702 --> 00:41:22,502
<i>What happens
to those poor souls...

776
00:41:24,557 --> 00:41:26,771
<i>who have no loved
ones to help them

777
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:28,531
<i>in their hour of need?

778
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,104
<i>Well...

779
00:41:32,082 --> 00:41:35,388
<i>most learn to walk life's road
by themselves.

780
00:41:38,689 --> 00:41:40,801
<i>But a sad few of us...

781
00:41:44,317 --> 00:41:45,474
<i>simply...

782
00:41:46,038 --> 00:41:47,336
<i>stop trying.

783
