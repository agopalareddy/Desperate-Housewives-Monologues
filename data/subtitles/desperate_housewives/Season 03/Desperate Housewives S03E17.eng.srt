Previously on Desperate.Housewives ~

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:03,620
my back.I threw it out.

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,550
jeez,are you crying?

4
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:06,530
Just a little.

5
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,860
Edie got an unexpected visitor.

6
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:09,840
remember my little boy?

7
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:11,230
I didn't know your son was coming for a visit.

8
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,920
His father just dumped him here for four weeks.

9
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,840
Gaby became the object of victor's desire.

10
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:18,890
Have you not noticed? I'm a catch.

11
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,820
I have noticed,and I'm throwing you back.

12
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:24,650
And as mike struggled to recall his past,

13
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,040
ian's jealousy spurred him to action.

14
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:29,300
Will you be my wife?

15
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:30,310
Yes!

16
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,550
god,I'm so nervous.

17
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,610
Don't be.

18
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:39,390
They're going to adore you as much as I do.

19
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,810
Oh,thanks. I needed to hear to that.

20
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,830
Ah!Darling...thorns.

21
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,490
Oh!Uh,I'm so sorry.

22
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:51,420
if there was one thing ian hainsworth was sure of,

23
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:55,670
it was that his love for susan mayer was indestructible.

24
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,090
He knew this because it had been tested again...

25
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,570
and again...

26
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,270
and again.

27
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,860
still,ian had found a way to forgive susan her...

28
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,610
occasional lack of grace.

29
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,330
Oh! Here they come.

30
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,210
The question now on his mind was,

31
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:22,490
would his parents be able to do the same?

32
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,650
- Father. - My dear boy.

33
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,030
This is my fiancée susan.

34
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,380
These are my parents,graham and dahlia.

35
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:29,230
Delighted.

36
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,420
You weren't exaggerating. She's a vision,ian.

37
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:34,470
Oh,it's so great to finally meet both of you.

38
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,740
Oh,this is for you.

39
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,360
Be careful,mother!

40
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,210
Thorns.

41
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,520
Ian,I know how to hold a rose.

44
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:49,630
Anyone hungry?

45
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:50,610
Yes.

46
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,480
So one puts the meat atop the burning coals oh,

47
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,970
how wonderfully primal.

48
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:02,150
Yes,I'll feel like some
gloriously rough-hewn cowgirl enjoying her...

49
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,200
uh,what's the word?

50
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,350
"Vittles"?

51
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,330
No,that can't be right.

52
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,150
No,it is. It's vittles.

53
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,470
Yes.

54
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,310
So,um,can I get you something to drink?

55
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,480
I'd adore just a thimble of gin.

56
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,290
Oh,no,you stay,darling.

57
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,880
I-I-I can manage.

58
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,610
Well,it seems to be going rather well...

59
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:22,590
touch wood.

60
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,480
Were you worried?

61
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,090
Oh,you know,introducing one's fiancée
to one's parents is always a bit fraught.

62
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,340
Oh,well,you don't have to tell me.

63
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:32,060
The first time I met dahlia's parents
was a complete disaster.

64
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,090
We were at tea...

65
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,000
and there was this plate of small cakes.

66
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,760
And I--as I offered one to her mother,
I tipped the plate,and plop!

67
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,730
a scone fell right into her ladyship's teacup.

68
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:42,810
Ouch! Ha!

69
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,040
Earl grey everywhere!

70
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,030
On the cloth,her mother's skirt...

71
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:47,390
you must have been mortified.

72
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:50,210
Oh,I was. It was an absolute debacle.

73
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,060
um,guys?

74
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,620
Uh...don't worry.

75
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,250
She's all right.

76
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:04,140
Yes,ian hainsworth knew
his love for susan was indestructible.

77
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:10,190
Unfortunately for his mother,chiffon was not.

Season 03 Episode 17</font>

81
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,570
In every housewife's closet,

82
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:59,200
there's a treasured article of clothing
that she refuses to part with.

83
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:05,450
It might be an old cheerleader uniform
that symbolizes her youth...

84
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,770
Or the last bikini she wore
before she had children...

85
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:17,050
or a pair of expensive pants
she prays will come back in style.

86
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:22,980
But for gabrielle solis,
every piece of clothing was a treasure--

87
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:28,890
carefully selected,
beautifully maintained and utterly...

88
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,950
irreplaceable.

89
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,530
I can't believe you bought another bustier.

90
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,340
I know.

91
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,210
I should never shop for lingerie when I'm horny.

92
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,110
It's like buying groceries when you're hungry.

93
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,250
In a slump,huh?

94
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,390
How long's it been?

95
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,290
About three weeks,and I am dying.

96
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,540
You know,I'm this close to seducing my gardener.

97
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:52,810
Been there,done that.

98
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,000
Mmm,that scrumptious teenager of yours.

99
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,870
- Hey,do you think--
- he's married.

100
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:59,330
Mm,damn.

101
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,280
How about that victor lang?

102
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,920
- Have you two... 
- no. God,no.

103
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,600
As a matter of fact,
I think I'm dumping him
after dinner tonight.

104
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:07,500
Why?

105
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,770
He's rich. He's gorgeous.

106
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,190
He's probably gonna be mayor.

107
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,640
I mean,what more do youant?

108
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,020
I don't know. He's just too...arrogant.

109
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,230
He acts like I'm some trophy he's already won.

110
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,600
It's infuriating.

111
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,370
yeah,that's awful.

112
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,120
Can I do him?

113
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,340
Oh,stop it.

114
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,070
You cannot be that hard up.

115
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,060
Did I mention my gardener's 62?

116
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,320
what the hell is this?

117
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,480
Oh,my god!

118
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:47,190
no!

119
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,590
hey,hey,hey!

120
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,400
hey,hey,hey!

121
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,910
Honey,where's your uniform?

122
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:59,380
Oh,crap. I left it at home again.

123
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,580
Yeah,um,I figured you would...

124
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:02,570
again.

125
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,740
That's why...

126
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,310
I pulled an extra one from the back.

127
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,770
Oh.Thanks.

128
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,780
- Are you sure it's the right-
- yep,your size.

129
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,180
Listen...

130
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:18,370
I was thinking,wouldn't it be better
if the staff wore a uniform,

131
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,080
and you and i wore regular clothes?

132
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,310
That's way it's like,
"hi.Welcome to scavo'S.

133
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,920
We're the scavos."

134
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:27,510
Yeah,but I like wearing the uniform,
and when you don't,

135
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,580
it looks like we all work for you.

136
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,040
Oh,good point.

137
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,320
Okay,here's another good point--
I hate orange.

138
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:34,160
Since when?

139
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,160
Since always.

140
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,280
You know my closet.

141
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,680
Surely you've noticed
I don't own anything orange.

142
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,190
- No,I hadn't really--
- orange says,"beware.Something bad's gonna happen."

143
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,490
That's why they use it for life vests
and traffic cones and convicts.

144
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,870
- Lynette--
- also,it washes me out completely.

145
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,970
You're wearing the uniform.

146
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:57,000
Are you speaking as my husband
or as my boss?

147
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,670
Definitely your boss.

148
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,330
Your husband--

149
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,230
too damn scared of you.

150
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,360
As well he should be.

151
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,390
As edie walked home,

152
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:13,620
all she could think of was
her nonexistent love life...

153
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:14,890
pass it to me,carlos!

154
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,660
And how much she wanted back in the game.

155
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:26,340
it was just then she saw someone
she might like to play with.

156
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,490
- Hi! 
- Hey.

157
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,070
Did you see that,edie?

158
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,570
Kid's looking good,huh?

159
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,780
Mmm,looking real good.

160
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,680
Can we play another game?

161
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,880
No,it's lunchtime.

162
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,680
You go wash up.

163
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,540
- Bye,carlos. 
- Bye.

164
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,320
Oh,you have been so great with travers.

165
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,130
Let me take you out for steak tonight.

166
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:47,960
you don't have to pay me back.

167
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,580
I'm having more fun than he is.

168
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,300
Well,then...

169
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:54,630
we'll just have to arrange for another playdate.

170
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,440
Anytime.

171
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,240
look who's back.

172
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,660
yes. Let's try this again,shall we?

173
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,920
- Dahlia,I am so sorry about the--
- please,not another word.

174
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,530
Chiffon at a barbecue?

175
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:14,070
I was asking to be immolated.

176
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,790
A drink with dinner,mother?

177
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,010
Oh,god,yes.

178
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,980
Oh,not that chair. That's the wobbler.

179
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,530
I'm saving up for a new set.

180
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:21,500
Here,sit here.

181
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,810
Ian tells us you have a young daughter.

182
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,470
Won't she be joining us?

183
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:31,410
Julie? Uh,no,she's at her father's this weekend.

184
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:35,610
Oh.Is something wrong?

185
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:40,190
Oh,it's just that ian tolus that
your husband had been gone for years.

186
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,300
We assumed you were a widow.

187
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:46,890
Oh!no,karl's alive and kicking...sadly.

188
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,510
So you're A...divorcée?

189
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,410
What happened?

190
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:53,600
Did he beat you?

191
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:56,060
Uh,no. Of--of course not.

192
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,580
She had ample grounds,mother.

193
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,460
Karl was a shameless womanizer.

194
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,500
So it was just adultery.

195
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,730
Just adultery?

196
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:08,120
To my way of thinking,men are,by nature,weak.

197
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:10,420
I think graham will back me up on that.

198
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:11,740
Really,dahlia.

199
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:14,920
If you want your marriage to last...

200
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:17,050
when your husband strays,

201
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:20,690
you extract some suitable penance...

202
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,770
and get on with it.

203
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:26,100
punish the sin,but love the sinner.

204
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,580
Yeah,well,with karl,I was more,

205
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:31,750
"divorce the ass and seize the assets."

206
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,740
so you better watch out.

207
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,520
Betrayal makes me vengeful.

208
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,420
Well,that's good to know.

209
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,410
yes,it certainly is.

210
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,610
Apparently,
the water heater in the attic had burst.

211
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:51,900
Everything is ruined--
my clothes,my shoes,dresses.

212
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,850
Why are you smiling?

213
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,470
Well,we have different perspectives.

214
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:56,700
You see ruined clothes,

215
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,610
and I see a woman
who could suddenly use a rich boyfriend.

216
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,700
You will never be my boyfriend.

217
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,130
Gaby,how much longer are
you gonna pretend you're not crazy about me?

218
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:06,950
Not much longer.
This is our last date.

219
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,860
Hmm,didn't you say it was our last date
on our last date?

220
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,400
I mean it this time.

221
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:13,290
Yeah? Well,do me a favor--
mean it next time.

222
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,600
I'm getting an award tomorrow at the rotary club.

223
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,060
bor-ing.

224
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:19,950
Come on,I want my date to be
the most beautiful woman in the room.

225
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,780
Is that supposed to flatter me?

226
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:24,070
Only if you've never seen
the women of the rotary club.

227
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,380
Oh,shut up and get me a sweater.

228
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,070
Have you even noticed how cold I am?

229
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,600
Noticed?

230
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,180
It's made my whole evening.

231
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,040
Sweater--now.

232
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,920
How about a nice,uh,cashmere cardigan?

233
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,070
Oh,my god!

234
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,350
What?

235
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,960
Look at this!

236
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:55,030
There's lacroix and ungaro and vintage gaultier.

237
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,070
Yeah,I don't really know much about fashion.

238
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:59,380
Shh!they can hear you.

239
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,980
Oh,my god! There's another rack back here!

240
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,120
This all your ex-wife's stuff?

241
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:05,860
Yeah.

242
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,800
She's storing it here
until her new house is ready.

243
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,000
oh,my god!

244
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,040
She wears my size!

245
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,570
It's amazing. Nobody wears my size.

246
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,300
Well,I guess I have a type.

247
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,400
And normally that would creep me out,

248
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:22,160
except it means that I can borrow this
one-of-a-kind undari for our date!

249
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,590
Whoa,whoa,whoa. Heel,girl.

250
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,660
- This belongs to my ex.
- so?

251
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,360
I don't think she'd appreciate me
loaning her clothes to my girlfriend.

252
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,940
okay,"a," I'm not your girlfriend,

253
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:36,030
and "b,"she's not gonna
find out unless you tell her.

254
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,420
Come on!

255
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:41,900
a dress this gorgeous is meant to be seen.

256
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:45,550
Every day it hangs in the closet,
an angel loses its wings.

257
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:48,640
Well,that's very cute,but,uh,
the answer's still no.

258
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,080
Come on.Let's go.

259
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,450
Gaby.

260
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,820
I just wanted a moment to say good-bye.

261
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,570
So in the next scene,the guy wakes up,

262
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:13,490
and the girl--julia roberts,
sandra bullock,one of those--

263
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:17,130
is standing there holding a tray of pancakes.

264
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,250
What happens then?

265
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,150
I keep telling you,I don't remember.

266
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,170
What's the difference?

267
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,370
It's just some stupid movie I saw.

268
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,660
Yet every time you remember it,
you feel sad or upset.

269
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:31,600
I think something happened
at that movie or just afterwards.

270
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,130
Who did you see it with?

271
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,500
Well,it's obviously some chick flick...

272
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,140
so probably susan.

273
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:39,470
Well,why not ask her about it?

274
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,970
Maybe she can tell you what happened.

275
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,880
No. No,I don't want to bother her.

276
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,520
She just got engaged.

277
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:48,960
Mike,this therapy isn't just about
recovering your memories.

278
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,860
It's about you getting closure.

279
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:54,380
Now the emotions you're feeling won't be resolved
until you know whathey're about.

280
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:56,350
I don't know.

281
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,750
Come on. Talk to susan.

282
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,360
What could it hurt?

283
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,790
That's awesome.
I love model airplanes.

284
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,890
- So you'll help me put it together?
- Sure.

285
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,290
I'll see you tomorrow after school.

286
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,790
Can you come at 7:00 instead?

287
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,690
Why so late?

288
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,190
Mom says I can't play till
I finish my homework.

289
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,590
Bye.

290
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,190
He's coming.

291
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,390
So can I stay up and watch my show now?

292
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,790
You can stay up as late as you want,champ.

293
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,590
Tomorrow...

294
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,090
you are going to have an early night.

295
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,290
your father's been up there 20 minutes.

296
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,990
- Are you sure he's ok?
- He's fine.

297
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,290
He always lies down after dinner.

298
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,890
He says it helps his digestion.
relax.It's going very well.

299
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,890
I set your mother on fire.

300
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,190
And you've been relentlessly
charming ever since.

301
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,090
Trust me,when she looks back at tonight,
she won't even remember the fire.

302
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,690
but she may remember this.

303
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,390
Oh, my god!I'm so sorry!Are you all right?

304
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,290
Yes, I'm perfectly fine.

305
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,090
At least this blouse made
it through dinner.

306
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,990
Let me get you a towel.

307
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,790
Hello!

308
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,790
Oh, I hope you don't mind.

309
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,690
Dahlia has a birthday coming up,
and I saw this hanging there,

310
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,190
and I thought, "a robe!

311
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,690
Well, there's a notion.

312
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,590
" So I just tried it on...

313
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,590
to get a sense of the drape.

314
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,390
Were you also thinking
of getting her a lace bra?

315
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,690
Oh, dear god!

316
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,990
Please don't mentionhis
to any of my family.

317
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,090
Just take the robe off.

318
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,490
And whatever you have on underneath...

319
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,690
consider that yours.

320
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:53,390
Be reasonable, dear.
I'm only trying to protect you.

321
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,390
From susan?

322
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,890
Well, she doesn't care about my money.

323
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,190
She's never asked me for a cent.

324
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,990
Your logic is as wobbly
as the dining room chairs

325
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,690
she can't affordo replace.

326
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,990
I love susan,
and I won't ask heto do this.

327
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,490
Oh, hello.Mother's fine.
I-I found her a sweater.

328
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,790
- so,uh,what won't you ask me?
- Nothing.

329
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,990
I was wondering
if you'd object to signing a document

330
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,190
that says should you and ian part ways,

331
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:25,890
you'll accept a cash settlement and
not go after the money he inherits from us.

332
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,690
You mean a prenup?

333
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,790
Please try to understand.

334
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,590
Our country estate has been
in our family for generations.

335
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:39,690
We want it preserved for
the children we hope ian will have,

336
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,390
not lost in some pricey divorce.

337
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,590
Well, who's getting divorced?

338
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,690
I'm in this for keeps.

339
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,590
I'm sure you said the same
to your first husband

340
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,490
before you bolted with all you could carry.

341
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,290
- Okay, hey--
- mother, susan is not signing anything.

342
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,590
Fine.

343
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,990
Then we'll leave it all to your brother.

344
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,090
Oh,do you think nigel's
going to give you a grandson?

345
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,190
He's an alcoholic homosexual.

346
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,290
With a castle at stake,
he can learn a new skill.

347
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,190
Okay, stop this.

348
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,590
We invited you here to
celebrate our engagement.

349
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,390
Now I'm divorced,
and ian's disinherited?

350
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,690
Hello.

351
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,590
- Have I missed anything?
- We'll be going soon.

352
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,590
Please, don't be offended.

353
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:28,090
All of us go into marriage convinced
that everything will be perfect.

354
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,190
God knows I did.

355
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:35,390
And then one day,
I found a bill for some expensive lingerie--

356
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,790
bustiers,peignoirs--
none of it in my size.

357
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,990
Certainly opened my eyes.

358
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,490
But I-I'm not like my father.

359
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,590
Trust him, he's not.

360
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,990
I'm sorry, ian.

361
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,590
Hey, guys.

362
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,190
uh, hey, mrs.Scavo.

363
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,890
I'm--I'm sorry.
We were just taking a quick break.

364
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:03,990
We'll--we'll get back to work.

365
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,390
No.No, don't be silly.

366
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,090
Who am I--tom?

367
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,590
I'm one of you guys.Sit down.

368
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,490
Hey...

369
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,790
you know what we could use?

370
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:23,790
A good old-fashioned bitch session,
get some stuff off our chests.

371
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,290
So what's bugging you guys?
Okay, I'll go first.

372
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:31,390
How do we feel about these uniforms?
A little..."eh"?

373
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,190
they're okay.

374
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,890
But, hey, why--
why do we have to pool our tips?

375
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,690
Why can't we just keep what we earn?

376
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,590
good point, good point.

377
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,590
But right now we're talking about
these ugly-ass uniforms.

378
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,890
You know what bugs me?

379
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,590
No health benefits.

380
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,190
I'm kind of worried about this mole
that I found--

381
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,590
focus, people!The subject is shirts.
It's killing morale.

382
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,490
- Well, I kinda like 'em.
- Really, kim?

383
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,890
'Cause...

384
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,890
I heard one of your customers say
that when halloween comes around,

385
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,890
we should stick a candle in your mouth.

386
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,690
See?Morale.

387
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,190
You guys need to stand up for yourselves.

388
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,290
It's your right--

389
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:17,790
no,it's your obligation to go to management
and demand new shirts.

390
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,890
And if management doesn't like it,
you tell him he can go screw!

391
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,090
Okay, okay.

392
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,490
Break's over, people.
I'm gonna go find tom and talk.

393
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,290
Oh!Good.

394
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,190
I can't believe you tried
to undermine me like this.

395
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,990
Well, you gave me no choice.

396
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,090
It's just a uniform.

397
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,790
Why can't you wear it?

398
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,690
- Because I need to win one, tom.
- What?

399
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:55,790
You keep ordering me around and
disagreeing with me and ovruling me,

400
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,090
and I'm sick of it.

401
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,690
We have to do things my way
at least every once in a while.

402
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,290
This was the deal, lynette.

403
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,390
You agreed.I'm in charge here.

404
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,390
You're in charge at home.

405
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,790
Except we're never home.
We live here.

406
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,390
Our marriage happens here.

407
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,890
Okay, you know what?
We can't talk about this now.

408
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,590
We open in ten minutes.

409
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,490
- Maybe later we can--
- later I'll be asleep,

410
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,790
and then I will be back here
before you wake up.

411
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,390
We gotta deal with this now.

412
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,790
Okay, all right...

413
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,490
we're gonnadeal with this now.

414
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,290
I'm gonna get ready for the dinner rush,

415
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,790
and you're gonna wear the damn uniform.

416
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,090
- No.
- What?

417
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,090
I'm going home.

418
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,290
You're walking out on me?

419
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,690
I told you orange meant
something bad was gonna happen.

420
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,090
Hi.Remember me?

421
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,290
I had dinner here the other night.

422
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,190
Anyway,I was driving through
your neighborhood after having,

423
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,090
like, three iced teas,

424
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,590
and I really have to go to the bathroom.
Do you mind?

425
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,390
you and I are gonna be so happy together.

426
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,890
I feel 10 pounds lighter.
Thank you.

427
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,090
Hey, you got a minute?

428
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,290
I, uh, i need your help with something.

429
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,990
- I should probably get these inside.
- Please, I...

430
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,390
I need to ask you about a movie.

431
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,190
And so the last part I remember,

432
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,490
the girl is putting these
raw pancakes in front of him,

433
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,190
and then something else funny happened.

434
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,890
I don't remember.
It was just a stupid chick flick.

435
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,490
mike, it wasn't a movie.
That was us.

436
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,690
- What?
- Yeah.

437
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,990
that was the first night
that we spent together.

438
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,690
I wanted to surprise you.

439
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,390
With raw pancakes?

440
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,290
Well, they weren't all raw.

441
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,490
I was trying to spell "mike,"
and the "m" was goopy,

442
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,690
but the "ike" was delicious.
You loved it.

443
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,690
I did, huh?

444
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,990
Actually, no, it was gross.

445
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,190
But you were really sweet.

446
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,890
You just gave me a lot of
kisses and said not to worry,

447
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,590
I'd get a lot of chances
to make you pancakes 'cause...

448
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,290
'cause I was planning on spending
the rest of...

449
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,990
my mornings with you.

450
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,390
You remember.

451
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,390
Yeah.

452
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:39,290
I should go 'cause, um,
ian's parents are here.

453
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:47,430
it's nice to see you.

454
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,550
Thank you both for coming.

455
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:54,150
You know, I-I know I've said it ten times, but you look fantastic.

456
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,890
And my offer still stands.

457
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,860
You do not have to pafor my dress.

458
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:02,380
Come on.You only needed it for my luncheon,
and it looks like it cost a bundle.

459
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:04,690
Trust me, it was a steal.

460
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:08,510
I'm gonna go powder my nose, and then you can start showing me off.

461
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,970
Heads-up-- I just saw your ex-wife.

462
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:15,600
Ugh, what is she doing here?

463
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,060
Some friend of hers is getting a plaque, too.

464
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:20,460
You want to duck out after your speech?

465
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,410
Are you kidding?

466
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:25,250
I can't wait till she gets a good, long look at gaby.

467
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:38,180
Hey.Hello.

468
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:40,860
I love your dress.

469
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,880
Thanks.

470
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,390
It's one-of-a-kind, isn't it?

471
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,940
Yeah, couture.

472
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:47,920
Mm.Undari?

473
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,720
Wow, good eye.

474
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:53,860
Well, I do have an unfair advantage.

475
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,980
I bought it.

476
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:00,980
- So you're, uh...
- uh-huh.

477
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,970
Well, first, let me just say you have amazing taste.

478
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,620
if we had met in any other context, we would so get along.

479
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:12,420
I left those clothes with victor so he could store them,
not loan them to his sluts.

480
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:16,630
Okay, you're mad, so I'm just gonna blow right by that slut crack.

481
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:19,100
I want my dress back now.

482
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,550
Okay, let's be reasonable.

483
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,640
You can't wear two dresses to one lunch.

484
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,190
It's not like I have a spare in the car.

485
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:25,800
Not my problem.

486
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,520
Give me back the dress.

487
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:28,940
Go ahead.Yell all you want.

488
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,840
You can't force me to take off this dress.

489
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,480
This is pepper spray.

490
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:38,230
In three seconds, your eyeballs will be on fire.

491
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:42,200
Could you help me with the clasp?

492
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:48,950
hello, samantha.I heard you were...isn't that gaby's dress?

493
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:55,670
gaby?You in there?

494
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:59,030
Hey, victor.

495
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:03,520
Uh, you're probably wondering why I've been in here so long.

496
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,810
Funny story-- I ran into your ex-wife.

497
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:08,570
Yeah, she, uh, brought me up to speed.

498
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:24,980
okay, it's time for bed, travers.

499
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,570
But I wanna show carlos my new turtle.

500
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,590
Oh.Right.I'm tired.

501
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:33,710
That's okay, buddy.I gotta get going anyway.

502
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,630
Hey, you haven't even finished your wine.

503
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,960
Sorry, early day tomorrow.

504
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,680
Come on, kiddo.I'll tuck you in.

505
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:59,960
sleep tight, travers.

506
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,650
Oh, no!I'm such a klutz.I think I broke it.

507
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,500
Nah, nah, it's just a flap.I can fix that.

508
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,780
Uh, edie?

509
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:16,660
Yeah?

510
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,700
I can't see what I'm doing here.

511
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:21,480
Oh.I'm sorry.

512
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:28,420
maybe I should watch so that if it breaks again, I can fix it.

513
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:33,080
Okay, um, so this hinge needs to go in at this angle...

514
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:35,130
so that the flap works.

515
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:36,250
Mmm.See?

516
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,290
God, you're so mechanical.

517
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:41,890
Edie, what are you doing?

518
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,690
Learning about flaps.

519
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,360
Nah, I think you're coming on to me.

520
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,290
maybe.

521
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,720
Okay, edie, no.Come on.

522
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,880
We're close friends, and I don't want to ruinhat.

523
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,780
Oh, we're not that close.

524
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,600
Let's just do it and see where it goes.

525
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:00,800
Okay, you know what?It wouldn't go anywhere.

526
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,670
Why not?

527
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:07,160
mm, 'cause...I'm looking for a girl who wants to settle down

528
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:10,650
and be in a serious relationship, and you're not that type.

529
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:14,450
Oh?What type am I?

530
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:20,390
You're...the fun type, who likes to dress sexy and go out and meet new people,

531
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:24,870
and then go out the next night and meet another...new people.

532
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:26,620
you think I'm promiscuous?

533
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,250
I'm just saying, for a house on a cul-de-sac, this place sees a lot of traffic.

534
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:35,810
Just because I'm popular doesn't mean that I'm incapable of a lasting commitment.

535
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,510
Look, you can't even commit to your kid.

536
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:40,710
He's here for a month, and you keep dumping him on neighbors so you can go shopping.

537
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:44,060
That is, when you're not using him for sex bait.

538
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:49,300
Get out of my house.

539
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,430
tom, it's me again.

540
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,210
You should've been home 30 minutes ago.

541
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:01,420
I know.You're still mad.

542
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,520
I am, to so why don't you come home and we can be mad together?

543
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,680
See you soon.

544
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:08,630
so what kind of orange is this shirt?

545
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,630
Like a salmon or a coral?

546
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,460
Oh, cheese doodle.

547
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,650
Exactly, and I'm supposed to wear that every damn day.

548
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:19,250
Oh, please.It's not that bad.

549
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,110
I once worked at this fish-and-ch place.

550
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:24,240
I had to wear an eye patch and a stuffed parrot on my shoulder.

551
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:27,280
"Would you like to hear arrr specials?

552
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:30,670
" why dot you just tell tom to pick another color?

553
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,160
This isn't about the shirt anymore.

554
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:34,280
This is about us working together.

555
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,000
Every day it's a battle.

556
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:38,350
It's hurting our marriage.

557
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,660
You know what?

558
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:42,050
I'll just tell tom I need to step back.

559
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,260
You mean quit?

560
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,250
Yeah.We could hire a manager or something.

561
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:50,500
Wow.How do you think tom's gonna feel about that?

562
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:54,560
Well, once he decides to stop hiding, I can ask him.

563
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:57,570
You know what?I'm tired of waiting.

564
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,260
I'm gonna go down there and I'm gonna talk to him.

565
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:02,550
See you guys later.

566
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:09,160
So I guess this means we're babysitting the kids, huh?

567
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,000
Guess so.

568
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,140
I'm an idiot.Would you guys mind...

569
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,000
we got it.Just go.

570
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:31,920
Tom!Come on!

571
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:35,160
I know you're still here.

572
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:38,370
You realize what time it is?

573
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,980
I know!You're mad.

574
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:46,450
But you just...you can't avoid me all night.

575
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,690
oh, my god!Oh, my god!

576
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,710
Oh, tom.tommy...

577
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:57,260
okay, okay, you're breathing.

578
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,070
That's good.

579
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:06,300
hello?Hi.There's something wrong, yeah, with my husband.

580
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:10,020
I don't--I don't know.He's unconscious.

581
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,780
357 hawthorne place.

582
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:15,060
Okay, could you please hurry?

583
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:18,570
Thank you.Yes.

584
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,550
listen to me.

585
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:31,580
I forbid you to die.

586
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:37,690
If you leave me with a mortgage and a restaurant and five kids,

587
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:42,570
I swear I will track you into the deepest pit of hell and make you pay.

588
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:45,980
Do you hear me?

589
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:49,650
Come on, baby...

590
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:52,540
oh, please.

591
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:55,900
So that's it?He threw out his back?

592
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:57,830
Oh, thank god.

593
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,920
I'm guessing he passed out from the pain.

594
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,510
Mm.But I wanna be clear.

595
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:03,510
A ruptured disc is very serious.

596
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:04,880
He'll need surgery.

597
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,090
It'll be a while before he's back on his feet.

598
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:08,440
How much of a while?

599
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,640
We, three months.

600
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,850
Three months?

601
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,560
Even then, he'll need to go easy.

602
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:15,740
What sort of work does he do?

603
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:17,290
We run a restaurant.

604
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,500
Mm.He shouldn't go back for four or five months.

605
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:23,310
Restaurant work is very stressful.

606
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:26,910
Yeah, it is.

607
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:39,160
- What's that?
- Oh, it's the prenup my parents want you to sign.

608
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,450
And you brought it to bed?

609
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:45,840
okay, romance tip number one--

610
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,980
sorry.I just can't get that off my mind.

611
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:50,070
I keep thinking, why all thisngodly fuss?

612
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:52,520
Susan's not in this for money and heirlooms.

613
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,160
Thank you.I don't want your family's stuff.

614
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,220
What am I gonna do with half a castle?

615
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,860
exactly.

616
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:02,710
- So why not just sign it?
- Huh?

617
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:04,220
Well, I mean, looking at it rationally,

618
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,470
what's the difference between making the promise you just made to me

619
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:09,590
and making the same promise on paper?

620
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:14,870
Um...well, the difference is huge.

621
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:18,510
I mean, one way you're trusting me, and...

622
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:21,970
and the other way, you're trying to make it official.

623
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,930
But isn't that what marriage is-- making your love official?

624
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:30,190
Ian, do you really want to start our life together making me feel like...

625
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:32,230
I'm on probation?

626
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,770
You know that I trust you.

627
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:38,540
This isn't about my fears.It's about my parents.

628
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,100
Really?

629
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:44,330
I think it's about someone else.

630
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:48,580
He just wanted me to help him remember something.

631
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,970
Who?Mike.

632
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,650
I saw you watching us.

633
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,660
We were just talking.

634
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:57,890
I never thought anything else.

635
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,000
Okay, I'll sign it.

636
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:08,460
W-well...at least read it first.

637
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:11,760
I don't need to.I trust you.

638
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,440
oh.Hi, mike.

639
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:25,220
So tell me.I've been dying to know.

640
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:26,360
Did you talk to susan?

641
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:28,950
Could she remember what the movie was?

642
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:31,850
Actually...no.

643
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,420
Ah, well, hang in there.

644
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,410
We'll figure it out.

645
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:37,080
It's just a matter of time before everything starts coming back.

646
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,290
Here, have a seat.

647
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:45,640
Uh, listen, you've been really helpful the last few months,
but I think I'm done here.

648
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:49,440
Mike, I-I know this can be a frustrating process.

649
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:55,670
But if you give up now, there are so many memories that could be lost to you.

650
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:59,530
Yeah, I'm okay with that.

651
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:07,060
Oh, my god.How many did you take?

652
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:10,300
Sorry.I wanted options.

653
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:13,030
Stop judging me.I was hopped up on couture.

654
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:15,760
Hey, you know, it's not funny.Samantha called her lawyer.

655
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,060
What?Yeah.Over a dress?

656
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:19,000
God, what a bitch.

657
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:21,870
Hey!Don't call her that.

658
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,520
She threatened me with mace and then slugged you.

659
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:25,520
Now you're on her side?

660
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:29,070
Gaby, I didn't marry an angry woman.I just divorced one.

661
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,480
What happened?Did you have some little mistress on the side?

662
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:35,490
Worse.I treated her like she was the mistress.

663
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,140
I set her up in a nice house, I gave her an allowance...

664
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:43,180
and then I-I came and went as I pleased.

665
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:50,090
She was always there when I needed her, but if she needed me, well...

666
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:57,020
and if she wasn't happy, she could always go out and buy a nice new dress.

667
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:02,450
You saw the closet, so you know just how happy she was.

668
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:08,510
what?

669
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:17,420
I've known you for two weeks, and this is the first glimpse
of a guy I could actually like.

670
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,710
A clueless, emotionally stunted workaholic?

671
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:23,440
A guy who can admit he screwed up,

672
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:28,340
one who's not trying to impress me every second of the day with
how perfect and charming he is.

673
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:31,480
I wouldn't mind seeing more of that guy.

674
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:34,060
Well, his schedule's wide open.

675
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,980
How about dinner tomorrow night?

676
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:38,420
I'd love to.

677
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,270
Although what am i gonna wear now?

678
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:45,610
doesn't matter.

679
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,260
'Cause I'm just gonna talk you out of it.

680
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:50,880
look who's back-- mr.Cocky.

681
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:53,660
He never leaves for long, does he, that guy?

682
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:08,090
Are there any points you'd like to discuss before you sign?

683
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:12,380
I'd like you to say, "we don't need this.We trust you.

684
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:17,010
" But you don't, so, uh, I'll sign it.

685
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:21,760
And once I do, I am going to earn your trust by being a good wife to ian.

686
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,830
Well, we're sure you will be.

687
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:27,810
Um, sign all three copies, please.

688
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:35,540
I mean it.I am going to be loving and faithful and above all, honest.

689
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:38,400
There'll be no secrets with ian.

690
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:44,870
I'll tell him everything.

691
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,940
Well, we applaud your candor.

692
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:54,280
What I'm trying to say is, there'll be no topic that I need to...skirt,

693
00:36:55,770 --> 00:37:00,940
no issue that I won'T...address.

694
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:09,220
I won't conceal my true thoughts under garments of secrecy.

695
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:12,280
Good for you.Now if you'll just sign--

696
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,350
oh, for god sakes, dahlia.Anyone can see she's not a fortune hunter.

697
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:16,670
Graham, what are you doing?

698
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:17,920
She is willing to sign.

699
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:20,740
Which proves she can be trusted.

700
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:27,780
I'm sure you'll be a good wife to ian.

701
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:31,860
You can count on it.

702
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:50,240
I'm sorry ,carlos.

703
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:56,320
Thanks for the flowers.

704
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:59,730
You're welcome.come on.

705
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:05,400
You know, about travers-- you can see him if you want.

706
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:07,790
- He misses you.
- I miss him, too.

707
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:10,010
Oh, and just so you know, he's at a sleepover,

708
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:16,030
so I didn't leave him alone with a six-pack and some matches.

709
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,440
Look, edie, um...

710
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:21,750
- what I said about you the other day was-
- dead-on.

711
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,640
You nailed me, carlos.

712
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:27,780
Maybe not the way that I wanted you to, but still...

713
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,170
but I had no right to judge you.

714
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:34,680
Besides, the guys, the clothes, the partying-- that's you.

715
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:37,290
I mean, that's the edie that we love.

716
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:40,270
Well, I'm glad you love her, because I'm getting pretty tired of her.

717
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:43,130
- Come on.
- I'm a 40-year-old party girl.

718
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:47,310
Do you think that I don't know that my days are numbered?

719
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:50,510
Yeah...I don't know what you want me to say here.

720
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:53,770
Don't say anything.Just...

721
00:38:53,810 --> 00:39:00,350
stop seeing the person that I've been and start seeing the person I could be.

722
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:06,160
Look at me, not the edie that I show the world.

723
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:14,110
In fact...let's lose her.

724
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:20,920
Forget the blouse that she wears because she knows it shows off her cleavage.

725
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:23,660
Uh, edie, what are you doing?

726
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,450
And the skirt...

727
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:33,840
that's so short, because she knows that guys love long legs.

728
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,920
And the heels...

729
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:39,270
the ones that make her legs look even longer.

730
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,150
Edie, please.

731
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:47,930
Forget the bra that holds her breasts a little higher than
they are on their own these days.

732
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:56,230
And the panties...

733
00:39:57,050 --> 00:40:02,830
the ones that hide the scar from my c-section.

734
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,410
This is it.

735
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:16,850
Hi, carlos.

736
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:20,290
I'm edie.

737
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:26,090
I might not be the woman that you thought I was under all of that...

738
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:32,760
but I'm real, and I'm here.

739
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:40,170
And I'm asking for a chance.

740
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,270
oh.hey, andrew.

741
00:40:57,290 --> 00:41:00,960
Aw, thanks.He's gonna be okay.

742
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:03,220
No.No, absolutely not.

743
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:06,590
We will open tonight as usual.

744
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:08,520
Hey, it's gonna be fine, andrew.

745
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:11,280
I will take care of it.

746
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,510
It's my job now.

747
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:18,180
Mm-hmm.Okay.See you soon.Bye.

748
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:25,820
in every housewife's closet there's an article of clothing

749
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:30,970
that tells you more about its owner than she would want you to know.

750
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:37,880
It might be a shirt that she despises but wears without complaint.

751
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:46,730
Perhaps it's some lingerie she knows isn't hers but refuses to discuss...

752
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:52,040
or a dress she once loved...

753
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:56,630
that she can no longer bear to look at.

754
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:04,270
Yes, you can learn a lot about women from what they choose to wear.

755
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:14,670
You can learn even more by what they choose to take off,
and who they take it off for.

756
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:17,690
