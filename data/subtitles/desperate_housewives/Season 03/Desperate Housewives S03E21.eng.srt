Previousn on desperate housewifes

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,500
lynette made excuses...

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:09,100
-the restaurant did close a half-hour ago.
-0we're doing inventory.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,800
Carlos made a friend...

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,600
nothing better than family.

6
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,000
And edie made a pass.

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,500
-Victor popped the question.
-Will you marry me?

8
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,300
-Susan let mike down.
-I love you.

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,100
But yolove him a little bit more.

10
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,200
-And ian...
-good-bye, susan.

11
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,600
Let susan go.

12
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,100
it can happen to anyone--

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
an old woman hears suspicious footsteps
as she walks down the street...

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,200
a businessman sees a
reflection in his car window...

15
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:51,800
A shop owner feels a
blade...pressed against his back...

16
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,900
and in that instant...

17
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,800
an ordinary person...

18
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,100
is transformed into a victim.

19
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,600
And a world that seemed so safe

20
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,200
is suddenly...

21
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,000
filled with danger.

22
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,500
-So this little ear-shaped pasta is called...
-orecchiette.

23
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,000
-Anthe cubes of bacon are pancetta.
-Thank god fortalian.

24
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,500
You can charge way more for
"orecchiette with pancetta"

25
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,300
than you'd ever get for "bacon and little ears."

26
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,400
Thank you.

27
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,300
this is nice.

28
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,400
-It doesn't need more garlic?
-No, I mean...

29
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,300
everything--the food, the wine...

30
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,100
you.

31
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,200
I swear, there are times this is
all that gets me through my day,

32
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,800
knowing at the end of it,I get
to steal this little half-hour

33
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:01,300
where I'm not a mom or a wife or A... pizza slave.

34
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm just A...

35
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,800
tired lady with a nice man who cooks for her.

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,300
Well, it's the highlight of my day, too.

37
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,500
-Sorry, guys
-we're closed.

38
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,000
Yeah, we know.

39
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,600
Put your cell phones on the table.

40
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,700
Oh, crap.

41
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,300
get in there.Don't make any noise.

44
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,700
They locked us in here!

45
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,000
It's 42 degrees!We're gonna freeze to death!

46
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,300
Listen, don't paniC.

47
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,200
I'm sure when you don't come
home,tom will come looking for you.

48
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,600
No, he won'T.He takes a pain pill at 10:00.

49
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,100
He's probably already asleep.Jeez.

50
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,600
how are we gonna make it
through the night in here?

51
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,800
Yes, in the moment it takes to bolt a freezer door,

52
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,900
ordinary pple can become victims.

53
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,900
That better?

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,200
-And a world that seemed so safe...
-yeah.

55
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,900
That helps.

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000

At the exact same moment his wife
was being locked in a freezer,

60
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:38,200
tom scavo was having a nightmare about
monsters trying to destroy his home.

61
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,900
But it wasn't until he woke up the next morning

62
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,200
that his real nightmare began.

-Yeah.

65
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,700
-Did you sleep at all?
-A little.

66
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,500
Thanks for not letting me freeze last night.

67
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,400
Are you kidding me? You're
the one that kept me warm.

68
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:23,100
-You don't have a fever,do you?
-no.

69
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,900
That's just me.

70
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,900
Tom's always kicking the covers off the bed.

71
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,200
He calls me his little blonde furnace.

72
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,700
He's a lucky guy.

73
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,300
lynette?!

74
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,200
Tom!In here!

75
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,500
-Thank god.
-We were robbed!

76
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,200
-I don't care about that.Are you okay?
-Yeah. No, I'm fine.

77
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,100
-Were you hurt?
-No, no, I'm just cold.

78
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,100
I was so worried about you.

79
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
if you knew the places that my mind has been...

80
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,600
I'm sorry.I would've called,

81
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,900
but they took our cell phones
before they locked us in there.

82
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,200
-"Us"?
-Hey.

83
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,800
Hey.

84
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,100
I can't believe one dress could cost so much.

85
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,800
Ll, I wanna look fabulous tonight
when victor's elected mayor.

86
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,400
Yeah, but isn't it bad luck to buy a dress
for the victory party before the election?

87
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,900
Vern, focus. It's never bad
luck when I look fabulous.

88
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,700
Oh! Hi.Don't worry. I'm here now.

89
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,900
Yeah, but your meter just expired.

90
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,900
-Might want to put another quarter in.
-Oh, no, no.

91
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,900
I'm just gonna say bye to my friend, then I'm gone.

92
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,700
You know,this whole thing is crazy.

93
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,700
I go on one gay cruise and come home to
find you engaged to some rich politician.

94
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,100
Oh, vern, I can't wait for you to meet him.

95
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,600
He's everything I've ever wanted
in a man--sensitive and kind...

96
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:01,200
-and buys you $3,000 dresses.
-Ys me $3,000 dresses.

97
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,600
And he's totally fine with you
being a high-maintenance nightmare?

98
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:07,000
Oh, my god. That's the best part. He lets me be me.

99
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,000
All right,I gotta get going.

100
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,500
see you later.

101
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,600
What are you doing?

102
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,800
I told you I was leaving.Stop writing!

103
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,100
Yeah, but you weren't leaving.

104
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,700
-You were flapping your gums.
-Oh, give ma breaK.

105
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,200
I was standing right tre.You
could've said something.

106
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,700
I told you to put a quarter in... spoiled bitch.

107
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,500
you can't talk to me like that!

108
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,100
$40?You think I'm gonna pay that?

109
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,900
No, uh,I'm guessing it'd be the sap
that bought you the $3,000 dress.

110
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:51,100
Hey, carlos! Wait.Hi.

111
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,700
Look, there's some crazy rumor
going around that mike moved.

112
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,000
It's true.He went on a little
trip,and en he's heading back east.

113
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,200
Oh, my god.What--where is he now?

114
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,000
okay, look, I know that I've
put mike through the wringer,

115
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,900
but that's why I have to
talk to him--to make it right.

116
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,500
-He's not answering his cell phone.
-He turned it off.

117
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,300
-He said he wanted to clear his head.
-Okay, carlos...

118
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,700
tell me where to find hiM.

119
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,500
I'm sorry, susan.Look, you know
what they say--bros before hos.

120
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,400
They... say it.I... don'T.

121
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:27,100
Come on.Just for my peace of
mind,I have to know he's okay.

122
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,900
-I don't know...
-what am I gonna do go hunt him down?!

123
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,300
-I have a daughter.I have responsibilities.
-Okay.

124
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,700
He hiked to the hot springs at
pinewood valley state forest.

125
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,700
Okay, julie, I'm out of
here.Here's 40 bucks on the counter.

126
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,100
-Are you sure this is a good idea?
-Yes.

127
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,000
If I don't find mike before he's off
that mountain,I may never see him again.

128
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,900
Okay, what you're doing is nauseatingly romantic,

129
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,800
but how do you know he even wants to see you?
I mean, after the whole "I choose ian" thing?

130
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,000
That's why I have to go.

131
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,400
I have to make amends and heal his broken heart.

132
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,800
Oh, well, what if his
devastation has turned to anger,

133
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,900
and he's burning pictures of you in his campfire?

134
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,000
Well, what else can I do?

135
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,600
I love him. I have to go.

136
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,100
then go.

137
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,300
-strike three!You're outta there!
-Again?How are you beating me?

138
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,100
You got someone in there greasing
the ball for you?Huh? Huh?

139
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,700
Hey, come on, travers.You can take
him.Go for the soft underbelly!

140
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,600
Soft?!What are you talking about?

141
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,900
I'm all muscle.Travers, feel that bicep.

142
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,700
-Mom's is harder.
-Oh, well, thank you,sweetheart.

143
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,100
Fine. I can take a hint.I need a little exercise.

144
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,900
So how about we go to the
batting cages and hit a few?

145
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,500
-Cool.
-Wait! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

146
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,800
We're supposed to go to the movies.

147
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,400
-How about batting cages on saturday?
-Sounds great.

148
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,800
Yeah, we'll get to find out who
hits the ball harder--you or mom.

149
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,300
You are so going down.come here.

150
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,300
hey, w the hell is that?

151
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,700
Hello, edie.

152
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,800
Oh.Uh, travers?

153
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,100
It's your dad.

154
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:28,800
kenya was amazing,and, uh, being a part of
doctors without borders was so rewarding.

155
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,800
But I can't do it again,not
wi the time commitment.

156
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,100
I'm gonna have to wait till
this little guy is in college.

157
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,900
so... when are you taking travers home?

158
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Uh, not till tomorrow.

159
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,400
I'm, uh, speaking at a conference
in hilldale this afternoon.

160
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,900
And if you're hungry,I'm buying you breakfast.

161
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,200
-That'd be great.
-All right!

162
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,000
I'll help you get dressed.

163
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,600
You know, um...if you wanna
take a couple days and chill,

164
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,900
edie and i would be more than
happy to keep looking after travers.

165
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,400
-Oh, thanks, but, uh, we should probably get back home.
-Right.

166
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,600
the thing is--is...

167
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,300
we kind of made plans to take him
to the batting cage on saturday.

168
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,400
Oh. Sorry.

169
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:23,000
-Uh, well, maybe you can take him the next time he visits.
-Yeah, yeah.

170
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,500
When do you think that'll be?

171
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,100
I don't know. Um...

172
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,000
I'll have to check my schedule.

173
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,600
I don't mean to sound pushy.It's just, uh...

174
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,000
You know, the three of us,we've just--we've
been having a lot of fun together.

175
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,200
Well...look at the bright side--

176
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,700
you'll have a lot more time alone with edie.

177
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,700
Yeah...that is good.

178
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,100
here you go, officer.

179
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,100
I cued it up to the, uh,clearest shot of the G.

180
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,300
Thank god you made me spring
for that surveillance camera.

181
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,900
I wanted to spend the money on a pinball machine.

182
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,500
Son of a bitch.

183
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,200
I think these are the same guys that hit
a couple of diners out on mount vernon.

184
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,800
-You mind if I rewind?
-No.

185
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,300
I wanna see the exact time they came in.

186
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,900
Oop. Whoops.Huh, overshot it a little.

187
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,500
I was doing receipts,and rick surprised
me with this great idea for the menu.

188
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,600
-It's called--what are they called?
-Uh, orecchiette.

189
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,900
-It means "little--"
-I know what it means.

190
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,200
And he makes them with pancetta and garlic
and olive oil.It's really, really good.

191
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,500
It's gonna be our special tonight.

192
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,300
so the door was unlocked?

193
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,100
You need to be more careful.

194
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,400
The two of you are just asking for trouble.

195
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,600
Yeah, I guess we were.

196
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,200
quiet! Quiet!They're about to announce!

197
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,000
...And the race in valley
ridge is too close to call.

198
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,100
However, we're now projecting a winner in fairview.

199
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,000
It's victor lang by 10%...

200
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,500
speech! Speech!

201
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,200
Thank you, all. I couldn't
have done it without any of you.

202
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,600
I would especially like to thank
my beautiful fiance gabrielle.

203
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,800
and I will,as soon as the
feeling returns to my lower back.

204
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,500
sir,mayor's on the phone.

205
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,400
Sounds like he wants to concede.

206
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,500
-Gabrielle,congratulations.
-Thank you.

207
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,400
-Your husband runs a hell of a campaign.
-We're so excited for victor.

208
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,800
What a day, huh?

209
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:04,500
-Well, it is ending a lot better than it started.
-Oh? What happened?

210
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:08,900
Oh, this morning,I got in a fight with a parking
cop over a ticket,and the guy was a total jerk.

211
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,700
-Well, your days of dealing with that crap are over.
-What do you mean?

212
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,900
Mayor johnson's wife,sydney--

213
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,600
she's been collecting parking tickets
like bubble gum cards for years--

214
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:23,200
just gives them to her husband.They disappear.

215
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,600
Keep talking.

216
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,900
Honey, you are no longer one of the little people.

217
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,800
Forget jury duty,speeding tickets.

218
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,500
You rule this town now.

219
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,500
well, he conceded.I'm the mayor.

220
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,800
-You ready to be the mayor's wife?
-Am I ever.

221
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,000
knock, knock.

222
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,400
Hey.Where's travers?

223
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,600
His dad's helping him pack.

224
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,700
God, I'm gonna miss that little guy.

225
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,200
-it's been so much fun.
-Yeah, it was.

226
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,300
You're gonna miss him, too,aren't you?

227
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I know what would cheer us up.

228
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,800
A weekend getaway,just the two of us.
How's that sound?

229
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:19,300
-Actually,I'm busy this weekend.
-Really?

230
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,500
I thought we had plans to go to the batting cage.

231
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,900
Well, yeah, but that was gonna take a
couple of hours,and I'm swamped with work.

232
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,500
since when?

233
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,800
-You spent every day hanging out with me and travers.
-Exactly.

234
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,500
I've been putting off my work so I
could be there to help you with him,

235
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,900
and now it's time for me to buckle down.

236
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,600
So... what does that mean for you and me?

237
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,800
we're still gonna see each other.

238
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,300
I was thinking...

239
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:53,500
uh, for your birthday,that we
could go to that new oyster bar.

240
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:58,200
-My birthday is two weeks from now.
-Yeah. It'll be my treat.

241
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,500
great.

242
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,800
Looking forward to it...

243
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,900
for the next 14 days.

244
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,200
Hey, uh, don't let travers leave
without saying good-bye to me.

245
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,400
Oh, wouldn't dream of it.

246
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:19,100
I know how much he means to you.

247
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:26,920
Hi there.

248
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:29,910
Uh,can i get a map to the hot springs?
I'm gonna hike up there.

249
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,150
- No problem.You got gear?
- Yep.

250
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,190
- That's not gear.
- Why not?

251
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,940
It's tiny,ma'am.And pink.

252
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:40,860
Well,it's my daughter's.
Uh,the whole junior class has them.

253
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:43,210
Does the junior class have compasses,too?

254
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,990
- Trail shoes?Tents?
- Why would i need a tent?

255
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,710
- It's a 2-day hike to reach the springs.
- Two days?

256
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,980
Well,can't i just drive part of the way
and then hike from there?

257
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:58,590
That's not really how nature works,ma'am.
There are trails,not roads.

258
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:03,990
Well,maybe i am a little unprepared,
but it'll be fine.

259
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,070
I work out.I have quads of steel.

260
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,720
I'm sorry.
I just can't let you go up there--

261
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,790
Can't?There's no "can't" in love.

262
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,090
There's a man on that mountain that
i intend to spend the rest of my life with,

263
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:18,170
and nothing is gonna keep me from him-- not fate,
not destiny and definitely not you.

264
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:22,900
To finish my thought,ma'am.
I can't let you go up there alone.

265
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:28,090
- You'll need a guide.
- Cool.

266
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:33,490
- How do i get one of those?
- Toni,i got a hiker for ya!

267
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,970
This is toni,and those are quads of steel.

268
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:47,980
Thanks for suggesting we do this.
I've always wanted to try this place.

269
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:52,380
Well,you've been working for me for over a month,
and i figured it was time we got acquainted.

270
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,120
So much i don't know about you.

271
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:58,830
Well,i'll be happy to fill in the blanks.

272
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,650
What would you like to know?

273
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,890
Well,for starters.

274
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,870
Are you sleeping with my wife?

275
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:13,390
What?No,tom.Of course not.

276
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,630
Okay,so you're just hoping to sleep with her.

277
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,560
Look,if this is about the video,
i swear,i was just trying out a new recipe.

278
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:22,780
Don't give me the recipe line.
I am not an idiot.

279
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:30,880
The truth is that lynette and
i have been going through sort of a rough patch.

280
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:33,640
Yeah,she-- she told me about that.

281
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:38,060
And then you came along,and wham,
it's the perfect storm.

282
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,030
You're young,good-looking,sensitive.

283
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,970
Way more fun than five screaming kids
and a cranky,invalid husband.

284
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,840
Tom,seriously,nothing has happened.

285
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:53,420
And nothing is going to,
because you are gonna quit.

286
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:56,120
Quit?No.No,no.

287
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:58,060
No,i'm not gonna do that.

288
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,960
You want me gone,fire me.

289
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,960
Oh,you'd like that,wouldn't you?

290
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:08,460
Have lynette fight for you,
while i'm the jealous jerk who can't trust his wife.

291
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,500
No.You have to quit.

292
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:18,070
I'm staying as long as lynette wants me there.

293
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:22,880
And make no mistake.
She wants me there.

294
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,500
Oh,buddy.

295
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:32,400
You're not thinking this thing through,
because lynette will neverleave her family.

296
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:37,850
So the best and i mean,the very best that
you can hope for is to catch her in a weak moment

297
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:42,480
and leave a wound in her marriage that
will take years to heal,but.

298
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,520
T will heal,because i will stand by her

299
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:50,490
and i will le her just as hard as
she hates herself for what she did.

300
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,970
You still feel like sticking around?

301
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:00,300
Can i get you some more bread?

302
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:04,380
No,i think i've had just about enough.

303
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,730
I mean,the doctor said that mike might
never come out of the coma.

304
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,480
And then when he did,he didn't even remember me.

305
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,850
Di you need to rest a second?
You sound winded.

306
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,270
No,no.I'm invigorated.
This fresh mountain air is--aah!

307
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,910
Little help.

308
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:35,870
So anyway,the whole situation with mike--
it just seemed hopeless

309
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,670
and that's when i decided to
take a chance with ian.

310
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,160
Ian is the british guy whose heart you crushed?

311
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,810
Yeah.

312
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:47,090
What was i supposed to do,wait forever for mike?

313
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:53,260
No,seriously,i was asking.
What would you have done?

314
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,400
I would have waited for him.

315
00:19:56,410 --> 00:20:02,410
Well,clearly,you were n paying attention,because i did go
back to mike the second he woke up,and he'd totally forgotten me!

316
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,330
But none of that matters anymore 'cause.

317
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,140
Bug.

318
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,700
You know,the bugs can't get in
if you keep your mouth shut.

319
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,900
Travers.

320
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,360
I have someone who wants to meet you.

321
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:31,960
- A puppy!
- Yeah.

322
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:34,160
You wanna hold him?

323
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,220
He's awesome.
Are you gonna keep him?

324
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:40,500
No,he's not mine.He's yours.

325
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,180
- No way!
- Well,way!

326
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,430
I just rescued him from the pound.

327
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,100
So.What you gonna call him?

328
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,840
- Fenway.After fenway park.
- That is so cute!

329
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:55,350
Everybody back home is gonna be so jealous.

330
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:59,110
But,mom.I can't take him home.

331
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,860
Dad's allergic.

332
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:06,080
That's right.Shoot.

333
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,530
Oh,i'm gonna have to take poor little fenway
back to the pound.

334
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:14,250
No!Why can't i keep him here?

335
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:19,940
Well,you don't visit here very often,and--
and i can't take care of a dog all by myself.

336
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,730
Well,i don't know what else to do.

337
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:28,710
Why can't i just visit you more?

338
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:35,550
Hey,that's a thought,and carlos would love it,too.

339
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,660
Of course,i don't know how your father
would feel about joint custody.

340
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:41,420
I'll talk to him.
I'll tell him i want it.

341
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:45,130
Really?Well,that would be great.

342
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:48,910
But you better make sure that he knows
that it was all your idea,okay?

343
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,710
We're about three hours from the hot springs.

344
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,930
So if we get an early start tomorrow,
we should be there by lunch.

345
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,050
- What are you doing?
- Oh,it's a face mask.

346
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,920
It's lavender and honey.
You want some?

347
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:09,070
Honey,huh?

348
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:13,310
So you're in the middle of the woods,getting
ready to smear your face with bear food?

349
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:18,120
Well,i wanted to look nice for mike.

350
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:23,670
Lord knows i don't want to hear you
talk about this anymore

351
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:29,050
but what exactly do you think is
gonna happen with you andhis guy?

352
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:36,250
Well.I'm going to apologize and.

353
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,930
Then i'm gonna tell him that
i made a huge mistake--

354
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:43,210
no,no,no,no.After that.

355
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:47,020
Say he accepts your apology.
You get back together,and then what happens?

356
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:50,630
You know,after the novelty wears off?

357
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:54,220
Well,then.

358
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:57,730
We'll just be happy.

359
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:03,170
Okay,i know it's dark,but i can see you.

360
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:06,690
Look,after hearing your whole history with mike

361
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:10,030
it doesn't take a genius to figure out
what the problem is.

362
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,350
- What is it?
- You.

363
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,420
You don't want to be happy.
You're a drama junkie.

364
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:18,410
When there is no drama,you create it.

365
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:21,850
You sleep with your ex-husband,
you cheat on a coma victim

366
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:26,550
and now you're hiking up a mountain after a guy
who has no idea you're coming.

367
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:32,200
Who knows?
Maybe this guy will take you back.

368
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:35,620
But once the dust settles,
you'll kick up some more

369
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:40,460
because you don't know how to just.Be.Happy.

370
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:46,600
You don't even know me.
How dare you talk to me like that?

371
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:49,590
Ooh,so dramatic.

372
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,720
I'm gonna turn in now.

373
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,720
All right,sunshine,let's get moving.

374
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:34,420
- What are you looking at?
- My city.

375
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:36,890
It's like i'm seeing it for the first time.

376
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,270
Everything looks different now
that i'm first lady of fairview.

377
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,940
Oh,my god.You did not just call
yourself "first lady of fairview.

378
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:48,800
Well,well,well.
Who do we have here?

379
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:51,890
Oh,wouldn't you just love to rub
his nose in your newfound power?

380
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,440
Vern,you're just awful.

381
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,970
And as it happens,so am i.

382
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:07,820
Gaby,come on,i was just joking.

383
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:10,540
Hey,lady.It's a hydrant.
You can't park there.

384
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,910
Really?'Cause i just did.

385
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,890
Oh,you again!Gaby.

386
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,890
Just stand back and enjoy the carnage.

387
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,490
Thank you.
Now what you're about to see may astound you.

388
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,850
You know,i could give you
another ticket for littering.

389
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,010
You could try,but you might not want to.

390
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:36,020
See,i'm engaged to victor lang.Ring a bell?

391
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:41,280
- The mayor?Your new boss?
- I don't follow politics.

392
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,320
Let me know when the carnage begins
so i can shield my eyes.

393
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:49,480
Listen,buddy,you're not getting it.
You answer to me now.

394
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:53,240
- I could have you fired.
- You can't do nothing.

395
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,830
I can do whatever i want!

396
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:59,670
In fact,my first official act of
business as mayoress of fairview...

397
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:04,580
is to declare today "free parking day"!

398
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:06,650
Hey,knock that off.Hey!

399
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:12,030
- Free parking!
- Give me that!

400
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,000
- No!- Give me that!

401
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:15,600
Ow,you're hurting me!

402
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,080
You know what that sound is,fat boy?

403
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:22,560
The sound of your career circling the bowl.

404
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:27,340
Yeah,you're gonna find out what happens
when you screw with the first lady of fairview!

405
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:40,190
Okay,north.
I need north.

406
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:44,640
Moss grows on the north side of trees.

407
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:51,030
What?

408
00:26:56,540 --> 00:27:00,770
Ugh,damn it!
Stupid mossy trees!

409
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:13,780
- Dad!
- Hey,hey,buddy!

410
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:17,650
- How you doing?
- Good.

411
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:21,450
- Can i ask you a question?
- Sure.You can ask me anything.

412
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:25,740
How would you feel about joint custody?

413
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,080
- You bought him a puppy?
- No,i bought myself a puppy.

414
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,840
How was i supposed to know that
he'd get so attached?

415
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:38,690
Don't lie to me,edie.
You were trying to manipulate him.

416
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,330
What?Would it be so terrible
to have joint custody?

417
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:45,090
In case you forgot,i am his mother.

418
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:48,110
Two weeks out of the year,
and that's the way you wanted it.

419
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,880
- Well,i changed my mind.
- Aw,damn it,edie.

420
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:55,550
- We had an agreement!
- It wasn't official!

421
00:27:55,560 --> 00:28:00,460
And there isn't a judge in this world
that would keep a mother from her cld.

422
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:09,930
- Hey,travers.What's going on?
- Mom and dad are fighting.

423
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:15,640
- You wanna go watch tv at my house?
- Okay.

424
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:19,850
I'll see you there in a sec,buddy.

425
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:23,190
You haul me into court,and so help me,
i will destroy you!

426
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,500
You threaten me again,and i will go for
full custody,you--you son of a bitch.

427
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:35,240
- Oh,hi.
- Hey.

428
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:38,020
So.What is going on?

429
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:40,050
Edie has lost her mind.

430
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,840
For eight years,she's been happy
to see him two weeks a year.

431
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:46,250
Now out of the blue,
she's gotta have joint custody.

432
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,390
- Really?
- Yeah.And how's that supposed to work?

433
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,750
We live four hours away.

434
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,510
What's he gonna do,go to two different schools?

435
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:57,960
I don't know what to tell you,man.I'm sorry.

436
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:00,120
Yeah,thanks.

437
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:05,050
You know,i just don't get it.

438
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:08,180
Edie's been perfectly happy with our arrangement.

439
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:12,700
What the hell's gotten into her?

440
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:18,190
- Well,thanks.
- Good night.

441
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,910
Come again.

442
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,550
There.
Hey...

443
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,640
I made you an espresso.

444
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,360
Great.

445
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,760
You okay?

446
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:30,170
You've been so quiet all night.

447
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,510
I had lunch with tom today.

448
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,390
That's funny.

449
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:40,480
He didn't mention it.

450
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,680
He asked me if i was sleeping with you.

451
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,710
What?

452
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,890
I'm so sorry.
Oh, my god.

453
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:52,100
I'm so sorry.

454
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,290
That paranoid idiot.
You know, i knew it.

455
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:56,850
I knew when we were watching
the surveillance tapes that

456
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:59,960
he would completely misinterpret it.

457
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,430
- Oh, did he?
- Did he what?

458
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,920
Uh, did he misinterpret it?

459
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:08,780
Or did he just see what is obvious
that you and i can't admit?

460
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,670
I--ahem--don't know what you're talking about.
There's nothing to admit.

461
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:14,550
Lynette, how long are we gonna kid ourselves?

462
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:16,260
I have feelings for you.

463
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,860
I know you feel something for me.

464
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:19,780
Stop!
Don't say it!

465
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,480
You cannot say these things.

466
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,830
Come on.
We both know it's true.

467
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:23,970
We've been flirting since we met.

468
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,750
Yes, flirting!
That's it!

469
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:29,240
It's what married people do,
because we know there is a line you don't cross.

470
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:31,450
And maybe i've gotten close to that line,

471
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,500
and maybe i've enjoyed getting close to that line,

472
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,320
but i have never once crossed it.

473
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:38,200
Look, i know i don't have much to offer--

474
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:42,010
and i have nothing to offer!
I am taken!

475
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,530
God!

476
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,770
Great, great.
Now--now what, you're mad at me?

477
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:50,600
Yeah, i'm mad!
I am mad because i loved our nights together.

478
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:54,770
It made me feel sexy and happy,
and, god, how i needed that.

479
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:58,090
And now it's over.
You ruined it.

480
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:02,100
You can't work here anymore.

481
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:06,250
Wait...
You're gonna fire me?

482
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:11,110
Oh, jeez.
What choice do i have?

483
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,010
- Lynette.Lynette, please--
- don't touch me!

484
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:18,160
You have to go now.
Please, go.

485
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,980
You have to go now.

486
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:24,070
Go on.
Go.

487
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,590
Her name is susan mayer,
and she's never hiked before.

488
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:33,480
Now this is the last place i saw her,
but honestly,

489
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,630
she could be anywhere.

490
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,680
Just checking back in.
The name's delfino.

491
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:41,890
Delfino.
Great.You're all set.

492
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,530
- Are you sure she's lost?
- Of course i'm sure.

493
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:46,680
She's a dippy brunette from the suburbs.

494
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,640
She didn't bring a compass.
She brought makeup.

495
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,990
Wait, is she the one looking for
the guy at the hot springs?

496
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,920
Yep, that's her.

497
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:56,470
Now let's go find her before she falls off a cliff.

498
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:59,700
- The woman is a total klutz.
- Yeah, i hear you.

499
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,580
All right, we'll split up.

500
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:04,550
I'll take north of the river here,
and you look down in here.

501
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,030
Excuse me.

502
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,210
This klutz...

503
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:12,700
Could you tell me her name?

504
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:33,410
Oh.
Hey...

505
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:34,880
Mike.

506
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:39,820
Um, listen, i know your cell phone's off,
but i...

507
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:44,750
I wanted you to know that
i followed you up to the hot springs, and...

508
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,040
Now i¡¯m lost.

509
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:51,870
You know, in the off chance that i get
devoured by a mountain lion, i-

510
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:55,700
i just wanted you to know that, um...

511
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:58,740
I love you.

512
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:02,600
I've always loved you.

513
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:08,230
And i don't want any more drama.

514
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:13,270
And if you take me back,
i promise there won't be.

515
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:16,860
Unless i get eaten by a mountain lion,
and, you know,

516
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,650
that'll be dramatic,
but it won't be my fault.

517
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,440
Anyway, um...

518
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:27,890
I hope it's not too late,
but if it is, i just...

519
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:32,280
I just want you to know that i am so, so...

520
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:41,190
Sorry.

521
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,690
Here she is, sir.

522
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:03,950
No charges, no press.

523
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:06,100
Never happened.

524
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,380
Hi, honey.

525
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,630
You look handsome in a tux.

526
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:13,500
Jerome, give us the room, please.

527
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,590
All right, look,
i know y're mad, but

528
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:22,610
wait till you hear what
that jerk did to me--

529
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:26,070
gaby, shut up.

530
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:28,200
Are you familiar with the quote,

531
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:32,530
"from the one to whom much has been entrusted,
even more will be demanded"?

532
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:35,100
Um...
Doesn't ring a bell.

533
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,020
From the bible.

534
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:40,150
- That explains it.
- This is not a joke!

535
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:44,420
I have been elected mayor.
Certain things are expected of me.

536
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:48,100
One in particular is that my future wife
not assault city employees.

537
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:51,350
- He was mean.He deserved it.
- I don't care!

538
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:54,100
Your behavior reflects on me,
and i can't do my job

539
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,200
if you're constantly humiliating me.

540
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:59,180
Constantly?Aside from today,
give me one example.

541
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,230
Okay, how about jumping into my arms
like a 10-year-old at the election party?

542
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:07,790
I was just joking around, being me.
I thought you liked that.

543
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:09,090
I do, in private.

544
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:13,310
In public, you have to act like a grown-up.

545
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,450
Okay.

546
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:24,140
I'm sorry i disappointed you.

547
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,560
It won't happen again.

548
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,930
I better get dressed.

549
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:31,440
I don't want to be late to the victory party.

550
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:33,550
What happened to your wrist?

551
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,730
Oh.

552
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,600
That's what i was trying to tell you.

553
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,840
The meter man--
he grabbed my arm and twisted it.

554
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,640
What?

555
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,700
My god, he left a bruise.

556
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,680
Mm, it's not as bad as it looks.

557
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:49,980
Still, he shouldn't have done that.

558
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:05,490
- Hey.
- Hey!

559
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:07,200
You're home early.

560
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,940
It was kind of dead tonight.

561
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,520
Hi.

562
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,570
Ooh, sorry.

563
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:21,670
By the way, we are gonna need
to find a new chef.

564
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,800
Rick gave notice.

565
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:26,000
He quit?

566
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:31,500
Well, he got a better offer
from some place across town.

567
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,340
That's too bad.

568
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:36,530
Well...

569
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,670
Whatcha gonna do?

570
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,050
Well...
We don't have to hire someone.

571
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:46,440
I am coming back.

572
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,980
- You sure you're ready?
- Yeah.

573
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:51,340
Doctor said i can lose
the back brace next week,

574
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,350
and i promise i'll take it easy.

575
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:55,680
No lifting-- just cooking.

576
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:58,120
Well, okay, then.

577
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:04,720
I feel really good about this, hon.

578
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:12,070
I have been going nuts just lying around.

579
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:21,300
This is gonna be so great!
We're a team again.

580
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,820
Besides...

581
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:27,540
I missed you.

582
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:33,610
I missed you, too.

583
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,720
Hey, ee?

584
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:48,630
Well, hello, stranger.

585
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:50,710
Come on in.

586
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:58,080
- So what's up?
- Nothing much.

587
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:04,540
I hear you're going for joint custody of travers.

588
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:05,850
Yep.

589
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:09,340
I hired a lawyer,
and he is a real shark.

590
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:11,890
Wow, you're not messing around, huh?

591
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:16,050
I think it's important that travers
has his mother in his life.

592
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:23,210
Of course, he'll probably want to
spend more time with his video game buddy.

593
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:26,840
Yeah.

594
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:30,830
You know, but i just keep thinking, um...

595
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:34,650
What's all this gonna be like for him--
you know, all the traveling back and forth?

596
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:36,790
He's a kid.

597
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:38,520
He'll adjust.

598
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:41,630
Yeah, plus two schools, two sets of friends.
I mean, it's not gonna be easy.

599
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:44,600
Why are you being so negative?

600
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:47,820
I thought you'd be excited about this.

601
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,180
I know you did.
Um...

602
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:56,340
I just want you to ask yourself,
is this all really in the best interest of travers?

603
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,520
You know, ki need stability.

604
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:03,370
What about what i need?

605
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:11,050
I know that you miss him...

606
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:15,070
And i know you're worried about being lonely,

607
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:18,360
but i am going to be here for you.

608
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,840
Yeah, once every two weeks.

609
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:23,920
No.

610
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:28,110
I'm really going to be here for you.

611
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:32,450
And i'm gonna make you happy.

612
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,840
Don't say that if you don't mean it, carlos.

613
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:38,630
I do.

614
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:49,090
All right, i'll, um...

615
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:54,300
I'll call off the lawyer.

616
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:10,770
You know, i really am goa miss him.

617
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:17,610
Yeah, me, too.

618
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:19,290
Congratulations
Mayor Lang

619
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:25,150
Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in
welcoming the next mayor of fairview--

620
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:28,160
victor lang!

621
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,360
Your name jeff scott?

622
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:56,610
- Yeah.
- You read meters for a living?

623
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:01,660
Do you know how much i love you?

624
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:09,130
I think so.

625
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:14,560
Anyone can end up a victim...

626
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:18,780
Injured by the actions of others.

627
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:24,360
But whether the damage is inflicted
by a cunning ex-wife...

628
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:30,150
Or a blow delivered by
the object of our affection...

629
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:37,670
The time comes when we must pick
ourselves up and continuen our journey.

630
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:43,010
And if we can't, then all we can pray for...

631
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:45,470
Is rescue.

632
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:49,190
Mike.

633
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,980
I twisted my ankle.

634
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:53,990
Good.

635
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,470
'Cause now i get to do this.
