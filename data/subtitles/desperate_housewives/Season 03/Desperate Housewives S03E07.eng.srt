1
00:00:00,058 --> 00:00:01,864
Previously on Desperate Housewives...

2
00:00:02,228 --> 00:00:04,640
Nora looked for
trouble and found it...

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,790
You will never again
see my husband.

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,733
Julie got to know
Edie's nephew...

5
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:11,404
She couldn't take
her eyes off my abs.

6
00:00:11,414 --> 00:00:12,372
I felt violated.

7
00:00:12,518 --> 00:00:14,374
Susan and Ian made plans...

8
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:15,929
I'd love to go to
France someday.

9
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:17,355
Would you like to
go next month?

10
00:00:17,367 --> 00:00:19,500
Gabrielle and Carlos reunited...

11
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:20,526
It's been a long time.

12
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,343
And dinner with the Bigsbys...

13
00:00:22,562 --> 00:00:25,698
That's the police report that
Alma filed after Orson hit her.

14
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:27,631
Was full of surprises.

15
00:00:27,637 --> 00:00:28,903
Look, I'm going
through something.

16
00:00:28,927 --> 00:00:30,223
I had an affair.

17
00:00:33,898 --> 00:00:38,721
FRIDAY

18
00:00:41,976 --> 00:00:45,850
It was supposed to be an
ordinary day for Carolyn Bigsby.

19
00:00:46,907 --> 00:00:49,460
She had planned to bake
her husband a strudel,

20
00:00:50,355 --> 00:00:51,920
give her dog a bath

21
00:00:53,005 --> 00:00:55,202
and water her african violets.

22
00:00:56,765 --> 00:01:01,682
Yes, Carolyn had planned to do all
sorts of things she thought mattered.

23
00:01:03,158 --> 00:01:06,510
But earlier that day,
a woman who wasn't her friend

24
00:01:06,588 --> 00:01:09,871
told Carolyn something she
wasn't supposed to hear.

25
00:01:12,817 --> 00:01:15,802
From that moment
on, Carolyn felt...

26
00:01:16,578 --> 00:01:19,261
nothing really
mattered anymore.

27
00:01:23,835 --> 00:01:24,761
Hello, Carolyn.

28
00:01:24,897 --> 00:01:26,331
Yeah, hey, how are you?

29
00:01:36,136 --> 00:01:37,023
Carolyn?

30
00:01:38,075 --> 00:01:39,131
What are you doing here?

31
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:41,883
I've been thinking, Harvey, that if you
loved this Monique woman so much,

32
00:01:42,988 --> 00:01:44,622
maybe you should be with her.

33
00:01:44,965 --> 00:01:47,280
For God sakes,
Carolyn, she's dead.

34
00:01:47,448 --> 00:01:48,451
Yeah, I know.

35
00:01:56,375 --> 00:02:00,902
Yes, Carolyn Bigsby had planned
on it being an ordinary day...

36
00:02:01,128 --> 00:02:01,963
Harvey!

37
00:02:02,697 --> 00:02:04,680
You come out of there, damn it!

38
00:02:04,788 --> 00:02:07,051
But as every housewife knows...

39
00:02:07,818 --> 00:02:09,550
Down. Nobody goes anywhere.

40
00:02:12,127 --> 00:02:13,720
Plans change.

41
00:02:15,856 --> 00:02:19,442
THE NIGHT BEFORE

44
00:02:32,466 --> 00:02:35,393
She dreamt of the last
time she saw me...

45
00:02:39,195 --> 00:02:41,661
and of the last
time we spoke.

46
00:02:42,808 --> 00:02:43,863
Hey!

47
00:02:44,438 --> 00:02:46,823
Mary Alice, are you okay?

48
00:02:48,527 --> 00:02:50,171
Yes, thank you.

49
00:02:50,785 --> 00:02:51,800
I'm fine.

50
00:03:00,108 --> 00:03:02,541
Okay. See you later.

51
00:03:04,566 --> 00:03:07,373
It was still hard for
Lynette to accept

52
00:03:07,415 --> 00:03:10,670
that this unremarkable
exchange had been our last.

53
00:03:11,946 --> 00:03:13,491
Or that moments later,

54
00:03:13,648 --> 00:03:15,560
I would enter my house,

55
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:18,483
and put a bullet
through my brain.

56
00:03:26,728 --> 00:03:30,881
FRIDAY MORNING

57
00:03:32,247 --> 00:03:34,783
I had the Mary Alice
dream again last night.

58
00:03:35,046 --> 00:03:36,080
Oh, hon, again?

59
00:03:36,126 --> 00:03:38,630
I haven't had it for months.
I don't know why it came back.

60
00:03:38,775 --> 00:03:41,943
Well, somebody just bought her old
house. Maybe that triggered something.

61
00:03:42,227 --> 00:03:44,143
It was awful, as always.

62
00:03:44,207 --> 00:03:46,902
I saw she was in pain,
and I just walked away and...

63
00:03:47,238 --> 00:03:48,772
There was nothing you could do.

64
00:03:48,835 --> 00:03:50,790
And that's what I did, nothing.

65
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,223
Hey, is that the new neighbor?

66
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:02,322
-Oh, he's cute!
-Edie said he's a bachelor...

67
00:04:02,665 --> 00:04:03,502
Keep talking.

68
00:04:03,506 --> 00:04:05,242
Who lives with his invalid sister.

69
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:06,732
You can stop now.

70
00:04:08,888 --> 00:04:10,521
Should we go introduce ourselves?

71
00:04:10,747 --> 00:04:13,450
Yeah, let's give him the
scoop on the neighborhood.

72
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:17,002
Do you think he knows Mary Alice
shot herself in his living room?

73
00:04:18,837 --> 00:04:21,900
Then again, he probably
wants some time to unpack.

74
00:04:28,515 --> 00:04:29,233
Orson?

75
00:04:29,467 --> 00:04:32,043
If you have a moment, there's
something I'd like your thoughts on.

76
00:04:32,115 --> 00:04:33,941
Certainly.
What is it?

77
00:04:34,086 --> 00:04:35,710
The menu for our
holiday open house?

78
00:04:35,835 --> 00:04:39,110
No, it's the police report from the
night you beat your first wife.

79
00:04:41,138 --> 00:04:42,641
I'm still working on the menu.

80
00:04:46,267 --> 00:04:48,242
I assure you,
I did not beat my wife.

81
00:04:48,407 --> 00:04:50,103
She suffered these
injuries in a fall.

82
00:04:50,517 --> 00:04:51,761
Oh, how did she fall?

83
00:04:52,055 --> 00:04:53,082
I pushed her.

84
00:04:53,798 --> 00:04:56,020
It was self-defense.
She attacked me.

85
00:04:56,305 --> 00:04:57,810
Why would she attack you?

86
00:04:58,357 --> 00:05:00,302
She spilled some red
wine on a white tablecloth.

87
00:05:00,658 --> 00:05:02,221
She was trying to clean
it up with dish soap.

88
00:05:02,266 --> 00:05:05,673
When I pointed out her mistake, she
started screaming, "Shut up, shut up!"

89
00:05:05,767 --> 00:05:08,202
And striking me repeatedly
with a sauté pan.

90
00:05:10,598 --> 00:05:11,392
Well, look...

91
00:05:12,427 --> 00:05:14,382
The police dropped the charges.

92
00:05:14,788 --> 00:05:16,113
Where did you get this?

93
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:17,752
Carolyn.

94
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,372
Well, of course.
Who else?

95
00:05:21,235 --> 00:05:23,733
If she paid this much attention
to her own marriage, maybe

96
00:05:23,818 --> 00:05:25,330
Harvey wouldn't
have cheated on her.

97
00:05:25,846 --> 00:05:26,810
Harvey cheated?

98
00:05:26,896 --> 00:05:30,261
Yes, with some flight
attendant named Monique.

99
00:05:32,428 --> 00:05:35,711
Darling, I could never
strike a woman.

100
00:05:38,575 --> 00:05:40,912
Well, you do believe
me, don't you?

101
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:47,603
All right, I accept
your explanation.

102
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:52,292
I just wish there were fewer
things for you to explain.

103
00:05:55,566 --> 00:06:00,050
By the way, to remove a red wine
stain, you sprinkle salt to absorb it.

104
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:03,973
That's  just what I was saying
to Alma when she clocked me.

105
00:06:10,376 --> 00:06:12,331
Whoa, what fresh hell is this?

106
00:06:13,256 --> 00:06:14,532
-Hey,  Tom...
-Whoa!

107
00:06:14,998 --> 00:06:15,871
Whoa, whoa!

108
00:06:16,246 --> 00:06:18,553
You have stepped onto my property,
and you've talked to Tom.

109
00:06:18,595 --> 00:06:22,352
That's two rules you've broken, and
I'm not sure that top doesn't make three.

110
00:06:22,865 --> 00:06:25,872
Would you tell your lunatic
wife I'm not talking to her?

111
00:06:25,937 --> 00:06:27,603
You're the lunatic if you think
I'm letting you anywhere

112
00:06:27,606 --> 00:06:30,221
-near my husband.
-Just drop Kayla off and go.

113
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,152
Kayla won't be visiting today.

114
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:34,042
We're moving.

115
00:06:34,588 --> 00:06:36,572
And here's where you can
send the child support.

116
00:06:42,627 --> 00:06:43,440
Mexico?

117
00:06:43,527 --> 00:06:49,940
An old friend of mine got me a sweet
job dancing at a nightclub in Tijuana.

118
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,582
Great, and you're taking Kayla?

119
00:06:51,657 --> 00:06:52,831
Thank your wife.

120
00:06:53,216 --> 00:06:55,822
She's been itching to get rid
of us ever since we got here.

121
00:06:56,686 --> 00:06:58,033
She finally got her way.

122
00:06:59,596 --> 00:07:01,660
Wave bye-bye to your Daddy, honey.

123
00:07:03,737 --> 00:07:06,501
Nora, can't... can't we
just talk about this?

124
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,550
Oh, we're not allowed to talk.

125
00:07:10,405 --> 00:07:11,463
Remember?

126
00:07:12,077 --> 00:07:15,011
She's Tom's daughter. You can't
just take her out of the country.

127
00:07:15,046 --> 00:07:16,112
Watch me.

128
00:07:25,146 --> 00:07:29,662
Does either party have anything to add before
I rulon the division of assets and alimony?

129
00:07:29,805 --> 00:07:35,180
No, we're confident that your
ruling will reflect the pain and
suffering endured by my client.

130
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:40,980
Your honor, does the definition of
"suffering" encompass the seduction
of my client four days ago?

131
00:07:42,835 --> 00:07:43,710
Excuse me?

132
00:07:43,937 --> 00:07:48,400
She thought he was coming into some
money and hoped to stall the divorce
until she could claim her share.

133
00:07:48,428 --> 00:07:51,052
How dare you!
That is a vicious lie.

134
00:07:51,475 --> 00:07:54,073
Oh, Carlos, give it to me!

135
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:57,592
Carlos! Yes! Yes!

136
00:07:57,626 --> 00:07:58,600
Carlos...

137
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:01,153
You recorded our lovemaking?

138
00:08:01,256 --> 00:08:02,713
It's all right here, your honor.

139
00:08:02,808 --> 00:08:06,310
When she climaxes, she actually
starts screaming out dollar amounts.

140
00:08:06,937 --> 00:08:08,193
Mrs. Solis...

141
00:08:09,018 --> 00:08:10,653
Would you like to respond?

142
00:08:10,878 --> 00:08:13,451
As a matter of fact,
I do have a few thoughts.

143
00:08:14,638 --> 00:08:16,740
Carlos, you're a dead man!
Do you hear me?

144
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,396
Oh, the ruling seems fair
to me. You get the house.

145
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,153
I just get everything in it.

146
00:08:21,252 --> 00:08:22,938
I said dead!

147
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:25,420
No alimony.
That's a drag.

148
00:08:25,895 --> 00:08:27,303
But, hey, you like
to work, right?

149
00:08:27,347 --> 00:08:30,711
Come on, just give me one clean shot
at him. I'm willing to do the time!

150
00:08:35,075 --> 00:08:37,683
Mom, I was packing your suitcase,
and you're totally out of toothpaste.

151
00:08:37,687 --> 00:08:39,160
Do you want me to go to
the store and get some?

152
00:08:41,127 --> 00:08:41,920
What is this?

153
00:08:42,336 --> 00:08:44,642
Oh, um, it was Austin's, okay?

154
00:08:44,878 --> 00:08:47,081
Edie's nephew? Since when
are you friends with him?

155
00:08:47,165 --> 00:08:49,983
Uh, we are not friends. I was
tutoring him, he brought beer,

156
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,441
I told him to throw it out,
and he did. End of story.

157
00:08:52,608 --> 00:08:53,753
Did you have any?

158
00:08:56,075 --> 00:08:58,493
Oh, I cannot believe your timing.

159
00:08:58,575 --> 00:09:02,133
I'm about to fly off to Paris, and you're
inviting boys over for oktoberfest.

160
00:09:02,138 --> 00:09:05,320
Oh, that's it! Go to your room and finish
packing. This conversation's over.

161
00:09:05,555 --> 00:09:07,722
The last time I checked,
I was the parent.

162
00:09:07,878 --> 00:09:11,233
Yeah, well, the last time I checked,
I was the daughter who never gave
you any reason to doubt her.

163
00:09:12,036 --> 00:09:14,181
-Okay, I know I...
-And don't play the parent card with me.

164
00:09:14,248 --> 00:09:17,563
I just finished packing your suitcase, doing
your laundry and balancing your checkbook.

165
00:09:18,628 --> 00:09:20,693
And now I'm going to the
store to buy your toothpaste.

166
00:09:22,435 --> 00:09:26,123
Well, a simple "No, I didn't
drink any beer" would've sufficed.

167
00:09:32,015 --> 00:09:32,821
Bree!

168
00:09:33,257 --> 00:09:35,683
You haven't returned any of my calls.
I've been worried.

169
00:09:35,935 --> 00:09:37,963
Have you told the wife-beater
you're leaving him yet?

170
00:09:38,027 --> 00:09:39,202
Sorry, no.

171
00:09:39,368 --> 00:09:42,073
Turns out he has an explanation
for the police report.

172
00:09:42,388 --> 00:09:45,171
Oh, come on. There's never
a good reason for hitting a woman.

173
00:09:45,286 --> 00:09:47,673
I used to think that, too.
Then I met you.

174
00:09:48,098 --> 00:09:48,993
Good day.

175
00:09:49,508 --> 00:09:52,641
I'm trying to help you.
You're living in a fool's paradise.

176
00:09:52,678 --> 00:09:54,693
Well, I guess that
makes us neighbors.

177
00:09:55,747 --> 00:09:57,221
What's that supposed to mean?

178
00:09:58,126 --> 00:10:01,852
It means you should stop worrying about my
marriage and start worrying about your own.

179
00:10:13,925 --> 00:10:15,192
don't play coy with me.

180
00:10:16,438 --> 00:10:18,420
You've got something
to say, then just say it.

181
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:21,652
Okay. Does the name Monique
mean anything to you?

182
00:10:26,105 --> 00:10:30,100
Hey, I found this site that offers
really cheap fares to Tijuana,

183
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:32,783
but should I even be thinking
of going to Tijuana?

184
00:10:32,888 --> 00:10:33,992
It's fine with me...

185
00:10:34,465 --> 00:10:36,722
Soon as you figure out a way
to leave your genitals here.

186
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:40,720
What are you saying, Lynette? I'm not
allowed to visit my daughter? What?

187
00:10:40,785 --> 00:10:44,271
See? This is exactly
what she wants.

188
00:10:44,465 --> 00:10:47,723
She takes Kayla,
and I get blamed.

189
00:10:49,247 --> 00:10:51,702
Well, screw her.
Let's sue for custody.

190
00:10:52,797 --> 00:10:54,752
Full custody?
You'd go for that?

191
00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:56,243
You bet I woul'd.

192
00:10:56,477 --> 00:10:59,351
Kayla will be much better off
without Crazy in her life.

193
00:10:59,768 --> 00:11:00,510
So will we.

194
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:02,370
I am right there with you.

195
00:11:02,417 --> 00:11:04,880
I just... I never thought
you'd want a fifth kid.

196
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:09,011
I don't, but I didn't want the first four,
and they're starting to grow on me.

197
00:11:20,135 --> 00:11:22,963
Hey,  look whose plastic
handcuffs got taken off.

198
00:11:24,616 --> 00:11:27,812
Okay, you' clearly still a little
miffed about the settlement.

199
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:29,453
But come on, be fair.

200
00:11:29,575 --> 00:11:32,681
I did buy most of the stuff
in this house, honey.

201
00:11:44,087 --> 00:11:45,291
What the hell are you doing?!

202
00:11:45,368 --> 00:11:46,780
Oh, I'm helping you pack.

203
00:11:46,798 --> 00:11:49,173
Think  of all the money you're
gonna save on bubble wrap.

204
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,572
Do you know how
much that was worth?!

205
00:11:55,095 --> 00:11:57,032
Do you know how
much I was worth?!

206
00:11:57,367 --> 00:11:59,920
When we met, I was
on the coverf magazines.

207
00:12:00,077 --> 00:12:03,553
I had a career and a future,
but I gave it all up for you,

208
00:12:03,697 --> 00:12:05,270
and what did I get in return?

209
00:12:05,688 --> 00:12:08,242
If you break one more
thing, so help me...

210
00:12:08,277 --> 00:12:09,642
What? What are you gonna do?

211
00:12:25,997 --> 00:12:27,900
Carlos, have you lost your mind?!

212
00:12:28,405 --> 00:12:30,142
Well, you're helping
me pack my stuff.

213
00:12:30,475 --> 00:12:32,233
I'm helping you
remodel your house.

214
00:12:35,935 --> 00:12:38,362
You know, I don't
know about you,

215
00:12:38,485 --> 00:12:41,763
but I always thought there should
be a window that was right there.

216
00:12:49,007 --> 00:12:51,761
We can stop this right now,
or we can keep on playing.

217
00:12:52,098 --> 00:12:53,272
Your call.

218
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:09,541
Toothpaste, mouthwash...
Did somebody get an anonymous e-mail?

219
00:13:09,547 --> 00:13:11,601
Said the boy with the
economy-sized acne cream.

220
00:13:11,678 --> 00:13:13,452
There you go again,
checking out my basket.

221
00:13:13,468 --> 00:13:16,250
Ugh, go away. Do you know how much
trouble your stupid beer can got me in?

222
00:13:16,327 --> 00:13:18,902
Well, then let me make it up
to you. I'll carry your stuff.

223
00:13:21,627 --> 00:13:22,491
Whatever.

224
00:13:44,606 --> 00:13:45,140
Yeah?

225
00:13:45,388 --> 00:13:46,471
Harvey, it's me.

226
00:13:46,655 --> 00:13:48,802
Hey, hon, I'm in the middle
of something here, so, um...

227
00:13:49,105 --> 00:13:50,521
I know about Monique.

228
00:13:53,678 --> 00:13:55,690
Um, could you excuse me a second?

229
00:14:02,648 --> 00:14:05,091
Look, I don't know who you've
been talking to, but, um...

230
00:14:05,127 --> 00:14:06,480
Did you love her?

231
00:14:07,437 --> 00:14:10,920
She was just a friend, and she
disappeared eight months ago.

232
00:14:10,957 --> 00:14:12,960
The police just found her body.

233
00:14:13,898 --> 00:14:17,133
Eight months ago. That's right when
you fell into that big depression.

234
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:20,290
And I kept thinking,
"Why is Harvey so blue?

235
00:14:20,335 --> 00:14:22,641
How do I cheer him up?"
That was about her, wasn't it?

236
00:14:23,506 --> 00:14:24,323
It's over.

237
00:14:25,117 --> 00:14:25,990
She's dead.

238
00:14:28,006 --> 00:14:29,193
But if she weren't,

239
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:32,383
who would you be
with, me or her?

240
00:14:35,895 --> 00:14:37,111
She's dead.

241
00:14:39,498 --> 00:14:42,753
That'll be $12.99.
I'll take your fields card.

242
00:14:52,555 --> 00:14:54,443
Couldn't keep your
wallet in your pants?

243
00:14:55,368 --> 00:14:56,443
Mr. Bigsby?

244
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:00,681
Look, um...

245
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:02,880
I gotta go.

246
00:15:22,207 --> 00:15:23,393
Mommy, look at us!

247
00:15:23,638 --> 00:15:25,900
I'll look as soon as I get
back from the store.

248
00:15:25,986 --> 00:15:27,182
Bye, mom!

249
00:15:33,937 --> 00:15:35,020
This is Edie.

250
00:15:35,597 --> 00:15:36,843
Yeah, I'm his aunt.

251
00:15:37,566 --> 00:15:39,052
He shoplifted what?

252
00:15:40,326 --> 00:15:42,472
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Be right there.

253
00:15:48,357 --> 00:15:50,430
You're still packing?
We're going to be late.

254
00:15:50,718 --> 00:15:54,542
Nope, we're fine. Besides, I can't leave
until Julie gets back with my toothpaste.

255
00:15:54,596 --> 00:15:57,842
Oh, we don't need it. I packed
a large tube and some dental floss.

256
00:15:58,106 --> 00:15:58,861
Really?

257
00:15:59,868 --> 00:16:04,361
why are americans so amazed
when the english display the slightest
acquaintance with dental hygiene?

258
00:16:05,246 --> 00:16:08,562
Okay, I'm gonna need some
help with this big baby.

259
00:16:11,355 --> 00:16:12,782
Go! Zip, zip, zip!

260
00:16:12,887 --> 00:16:16,111
Uh, Susan, do you really need all this?
I mean, we're not emigrating.

261
00:16:16,465 --> 00:16:18,962
It's my first time in Paris.
I want it to be magical,

262
00:16:18,967 --> 00:16:21,312
and that means
accessories, so back off.

263
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:23,483
It's the fashion capital of the world.

264
00:16:23,547 --> 00:16:26,592
Uh, while I'm working, you can take
my credit card and buy some new things.

265
00:16:26,845 --> 00:16:29,153
No, no, I am not gonna
spend your money.

266
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:30,702
I have an expense account.

267
00:16:31,396 --> 00:16:33,371
And you just tell me this now?

268
00:16:35,717 --> 00:16:37,442
I'll tell the driver
you'll be a minute.

269
00:16:41,485 --> 00:16:42,260
Hello?

270
00:16:42,998 --> 00:16:44,430
Yes, this is her mother.

271
00:16:46,126 --> 00:16:46,723
What?

272
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:55,221
Well,  you're gonna
love the neighborhood.

273
00:16:55,558 --> 00:16:56,721
Are you all moved in?

274
00:16:56,815 --> 00:17:00,131
Uh, pretty much. Just waiting on
some medical equipment for my sister.

275
00:17:00,217 --> 00:17:03,570
Oh, yeah, I heard she isn't well.
Can I ask what's wrong with her?

276
00:17:03,687 --> 00:17:08,251
Oh, of course. Unfortunately,
she has this rare degenerative...

277
00:17:08,258 --> 00:17:10,320
Oh, that's rough.
Excuse me.

278
00:17:13,287 --> 00:17:16,571
You told me you weren't even friends with
him. Now you're shoplifting together?

279
00:17:16,607 --> 00:17:19,191
-Mom, you know I wouldn't steal.
-Yeah, I wanna believe that,

280
00:17:19,196 --> 00:17:22,131
but suddenly you're having
boys over, you're drinking beer...

281
00:17:22,137 --> 00:17:25,560
And soon she'll be listening to that rock
'n' roll music everybody's talking about.

282
00:17:26,536 --> 00:17:28,961
So how are we gonna handle this?

283
00:17:29,046 --> 00:17:31,840
Listen, I have somebody in
the car who's late for a plane.

284
00:17:31,846 --> 00:17:33,203
-Can you give me two minutes?
-Mom...

285
00:17:33,227 --> 00:17:35,243
I am so disappointed in you.

286
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,183
Hello, Carolyn.

287
00:17:40,557 --> 00:17:41,801
Yeah, hey, how are you?

288
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:52,811
Look, make him work it off.
You get a free stock boy for a month.

289
00:17:52,837 --> 00:17:55,321
A month?
It was a $10 bottle of whiskey.

290
00:17:55,476 --> 00:17:57,691
Exactly. You weren't even smart
enough to steal the good stuff.

291
00:17:57,696 --> 00:17:59,251
Harvey, don't walk away.

292
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:02,553
Come on.
Let's sort this out.

293
00:18:07,665 --> 00:18:09,761
Hey, Nora.
How's tricks?

294
00:18:09,866 --> 00:18:11,761
I thought it was your
car I saw in the lot.

295
00:18:11,877 --> 00:18:13,292
You're a conniving bitch.

296
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:15,291
Ah, I see you've
heard from our lawyer.

297
00:18:15,378 --> 00:18:18,221
So it's not enough that
you run me out of town.

298
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,232
You gotta steal my damn kid.

299
00:18:21,547 --> 00:18:22,900
Carolyn, what are
you doing here?

300
00:18:23,078 --> 00:18:26,211
I've been thinking, Harvey, that if you
loved this Monique woman so much...

301
00:18:26,217 --> 00:18:29,081
Even you have to admit
Kayla would be better off

302
00:18:29,086 --> 00:18:32,633
with us than in a dingy apartment
over a Tijuana strip club.

303
00:18:32,877 --> 00:18:36,441
Believe me, Lynette, you
do not wanna screw with me.

304
00:18:36,506 --> 00:18:41,042
You went after my husband.
If anyone should be afraid, it's you.

305
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:46,902
Go!

306
00:18:47,805 --> 00:18:48,331
Go!

307
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:56,013
Harvey!

308
00:18:58,508 --> 00:19:01,041
Harvey, you come
out of there, damn it!

309
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:04,682
Down.

310
00:19:05,715 --> 00:19:06,651
Everybody down.

311
00:19:07,788 --> 00:19:08,842
Nobody goes anywhere.

312
00:19:12,806 --> 00:19:13,680
Don't move.

313
00:19:14,057 --> 00:19:14,771
Get down.

314
00:19:18,828 --> 00:19:21,772
You can't be serious.
We have tickets.

315
00:19:21,816 --> 00:19:23,502
The plane leaves in two hours.

316
00:19:23,545 --> 00:19:26,862
I'm sorry. I know, Julie
picked a lousy time to rebel.

317
00:19:27,447 --> 00:19:29,083
I just can't fly off
and ignore it.

318
00:19:29,266 --> 00:19:31,683
You're overreacting.
It's an adolescent prank,

319
00:19:31,758 --> 00:19:34,131
and you're turning it into
some great bloody crisis.

320
00:19:34,245 --> 00:19:35,961
You have a lot of
meetings anyway.

321
00:19:36,186 --> 00:19:37,630
Wel go some other time.

322
00:19:37,847 --> 00:19:39,403
I can't leave Julie right now.

323
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:41,141
We'll take her with us.

324
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:43,103
Oh, that's responsible parenting.

325
00:19:43,198 --> 00:19:44,352
Stealing whiskey?

326
00:19:44,427 --> 00:19:46,532
"That's it, young lady.
I'm taking you to Paris."

327
00:19:46,578 --> 00:19:48,193
Ah, ah, but that's just some ruse.

328
00:19:48,196 --> 00:19:52,223
Once  we get her on the plane, we'll make
her fly coach-middle seat, no mercy.

329
00:19:53,206 --> 00:19:54,211
I'm sorry.

330
00:19:56,218 --> 00:19:57,962
It won't be Paris without you.

331
00:20:01,808 --> 00:20:02,982
What the hell's going on?

332
00:20:03,255 --> 00:20:04,920
It's Mrs. Bigsby.
She has a gun.

333
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:05,793
What?

334
00:20:06,715 --> 00:20:08,220
I said nobody move!

335
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,561
She's at the back.

336
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:12,252
I think we can make it.

337
00:20:17,057 --> 00:20:17,620
Hey!

338
00:20:27,408 --> 00:20:30,961
Attention, shoppers, wee having
a special today on not getting shot,

339
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:34,360
but it's only available
at the back of the store!

340
00:20:38,557 --> 00:20:40,122
Hey, how are ya?

341
00:20:41,177 --> 00:20:43,140
Thanks for joining us.
Do I know you?

342
00:20:43,767 --> 00:20:45,263
My son Jordan's in your
Sunday school class.

343
00:20:45,266 --> 00:20:46,930
Oh, he's a great little boy,

344
00:20:47,618 --> 00:20:50,911
so don't do anything that'll make him
wake up tomorrow without a Mommy.

345
00:20:55,106 --> 00:20:57,752
Um, for the rest of
you, hi, I'm Carolyn.

346
00:20:57,775 --> 00:20:59,760
I'm sorry for putting
a crimp in your day,

347
00:20:59,766 --> 00:21:02,841
but I'm pretty sure that my cheating husband
is in re right now phoning the police,

348
00:21:02,848 --> 00:21:07,792
so I'm counting on all you folks
to help me keep them oside till
Harvey and I have a chance to...

349
00:21:08,388 --> 00:21:09,572
talk things over.

350
00:21:10,468 --> 00:21:11,212
Harvey!

351
00:21:12,207 --> 00:21:14,231
You're inconveniencing your customers.

352
00:21:14,237 --> 00:21:15,242
Get out here!

353
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:17,703
Yeah, she's got hostages!

354
00:21:17,715 --> 00:21:18,980
Oh, my God.

355
00:21:19,138 --> 00:21:21,320
Austin's there, and Julie!

356
00:21:21,676 --> 00:21:23,562
Get your ass out there
before someone gets hurt!

357
00:21:23,636 --> 00:21:25,882
What am I, a moron?
She'll shoot me.

358
00:21:26,106 --> 00:21:28,950
She has got ten innocent
people out there.

359
00:21:28,966 --> 00:21:31,031
Sometimes you've got
to take one for the team.

360
00:21:39,415 --> 00:21:41,362
Sweetie, it's Mommy.
I need to talk to Daddy.

361
00:21:41,395 --> 00:21:43,361
Porter's hogging all the legos.

362
00:21:43,777 --> 00:21:46,751
Tell him I said to share.
Now put Daddy on.

363
00:21:47,066 --> 00:21:48,743
I did tell them,

364
00:21:49,196 --> 00:21:51,450
but he says he needs
them all for his robot.

365
00:21:51,765 --> 00:21:55,261
Put Daddy on, and
I'll buy you a real robot.

366
00:21:55,697 --> 00:21:56,433
You will?

367
00:21:56,766 --> 00:22:00,403
A big one with laser beam
eyes. Now go get Daddy!

368
00:22:01,106 --> 00:22:02,870
I'm getting a real robot!

369
00:22:02,878 --> 00:22:04,862
A real robot?
Come on, that's not fair.

370
00:22:11,665 --> 00:22:13,202
I'm having a real bad day here.

371
00:22:14,007 --> 00:22:15,961
Is a little cooperation
too much to ask?

372
00:22:20,228 --> 00:22:21,052
Lynette?

373
00:22:21,426 --> 00:22:22,222
Lynette?

374
00:22:25,507 --> 00:22:26,863
It's terrible. Terrible.

375
00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:36,653
Excuse me, what's going...
what's going on?

376
00:22:36,657 --> 00:22:38,501
Crazy woman with
a gun in there!

377
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:49,521
No, no, no! Stay back!

378
00:22:51,116 --> 00:22:53,313
Carolyn! Open up!
My daughter's inside!

379
00:22:53,315 --> 00:22:54,472
Sorry, store's closed.

380
00:22:54,576 --> 00:22:56,272
Yeah, but there's a crazy
woman in there!

381
00:22:56,488 --> 00:22:57,872
Yeah, I know.

382
00:23:07,716 --> 00:23:08,862
Quick, turn on the TV.

383
00:23:09,868 --> 00:23:10,912
It's kinda on the fritz.

384
00:23:10,957 --> 00:23:12,253
Well, turn on your radio.

385
00:23:12,835 --> 00:23:14,371
If only you'd come
ten minutes earlier.

386
00:23:14,396 --> 00:23:17,331
Some woman is shooting up
fields market. She's got hostages.

387
00:23:17,587 --> 00:23:18,330
Oh, my God!

388
00:23:18,335 --> 00:23:20,640
Yeah, we're all watching it
over at Bree's house, and...

389
00:23:26,606 --> 00:23:28,462
Uh, is everything okay here?

390
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:31,752
Yeah, everything's fine.
Having a little squabble.

391
00:23:37,137 --> 00:23:37,923
Give us a minute.

392
00:23:38,725 --> 00:23:40,713
Carlos, where do you think
you're going with that?!

393
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:44,451
Information is very
thin at this time.

394
00:23:44,455 --> 00:23:47,301
We do not see anybody in the front
of the building at this hour but...

395
00:23:47,387 --> 00:23:52,121
Coffee's almost ready, and if
you'd prefer to watch the coverage
on channel 9, it's on in the den.

396
00:23:54,997 --> 00:23:56,930
Orson, Greta needs a coaster.

397
00:24:00,327 --> 00:24:02,233
Bree, have you heard?

398
00:24:02,267 --> 00:24:04,920
Oh, it's just awful. Deviled egg?

399
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:06,922
Oh, thank you.

400
00:24:09,408 --> 00:24:11,453
I told you she'd have food.

401
00:24:19,675 --> 00:24:26,550
I'm sure some of you might be
thinking that this is all my fault,

402
00:24:26,576 --> 00:24:29,431
and that I'm the bad guy
here, but I'm not. He is.

403
00:24:31,385 --> 00:24:34,820
Will you people stop calling me?
I'm right in the middle of something.

404
00:24:36,068 --> 00:24:37,942
He humiliated me.

405
00:24:38,216 --> 00:24:41,331
First he cheated on me with
a stewardess named Monique.

406
00:24:41,345 --> 00:24:43,423
How cliché is that?

407
00:24:43,538 --> 00:24:46,112
And then he told people about it.

408
00:24:46,326 --> 00:24:48,733
Now there are news
trucks out there.

409
00:24:48,748 --> 00:24:51,253
Judy Pope's husband has
an affair, nobody finds out.

410
00:24:51,285 --> 00:24:53,411
Mine cheats, and they
break into programming!

411
00:24:57,515 --> 00:25:00,951
The whole town is laughing at me!
You hear that, Harvey?

412
00:25:01,046 --> 00:25:02,830
I only told one person.

413
00:25:02,975 --> 00:25:05,143
Well, it was clearly the wrong one.

414
00:25:06,996 --> 00:25:08,902
I told you to stop calling me-

415
00:25:09,067 --> 00:25:11,601
Tish, I'm sorry. I thought
it was somebody else.

416
00:25:12,518 --> 00:25:15,290
Oh, my God, was that
today? I'm so sorry.

417
00:25:15,725 --> 00:25:16,813
I know, Tish.

418
00:25:17,127 --> 00:25:17,871
Yeah, I know.

419
00:25:17,885 --> 00:25:19,361
I know I volunteered
for the winter fair...

420
00:25:19,366 --> 00:25:20,681
How can you look so calm?

421
00:25:21,665 --> 00:25:22,682
Aren't you scared?

422
00:25:23,546 --> 00:25:27,101
No, because I'm not
gonna die today...

423
00:25:28,678 --> 00:25:29,991
and neither are you.

424
00:25:34,276 --> 00:25:36,040
Tish, I really don't
think that I can.

425
00:25:38,366 --> 00:25:39,963
I'm telling you, um...

426
00:25:40,476 --> 00:25:43,282
Oh, Tish, for God sakes,
turn on your damn TV!

427
00:25:50,436 --> 00:25:52,572
Excuse me,
my name is Susan Mayer.

428
00:25:52,656 --> 00:25:54,230
Ma'am, this is a restricted area.

429
00:25:54,326 --> 00:25:56,680
I would like to trade places
with one of the people inside.

430
00:25:56,687 --> 00:25:57,633
Don't... don't you do that?

431
00:25:57,817 --> 00:26:00,431
Oh, you mean our hostage
exchange program?

432
00:26:00,735 --> 00:26:03,300
Okay, you don't have to be nasty.
My daughter is inside there.

433
00:26:03,306 --> 00:26:06,422
Ma'am, we're doing everything
we can to get her out safely.

434
00:26:06,836 --> 00:26:08,032
Now please step back.

435
00:26:20,026 --> 00:26:23,072
I want the perimeter locked down.
Nobody goes in, nobody goes out,

436
00:26:23,267 --> 00:26:26,432
and see if you can get me an open
phone line with the manager's office.

437
00:26:38,225 --> 00:26:41,282
Attention! Attention, Carolyn Bigsby!

438
00:26:42,417 --> 00:26:43,893
Where's that coming from?

439
00:26:43,938 --> 00:26:46,503
This is Susan Mayer... again.

440
00:26:47,088 --> 00:26:50,621
First of all, I'm sorry for
the "crazy lady" remark.

441
00:26:50,885 --> 00:26:53,383
Second, I have a proposition for you.

442
00:26:53,397 --> 00:26:54,731
Find her now!

443
00:26:55,025 --> 00:26:58,171
Let Julie go and take me instead.

444
00:26:59,425 --> 00:27:01,513
Repeat, take me.

445
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:04,232
I will be a model hostage.

446
00:27:05,047 --> 00:27:06,351
If we have a deal,

447
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:09,643
signal by sending Julie to the...
No, take your hands off me!

448
00:27:09,668 --> 00:27:13,112
Carolyn, Carolyn!
Call my cell! It's 572...

449
00:27:19,176 --> 00:27:23,350
Now we don't know where anyone
is inside the building right now,

450
00:27:23,527 --> 00:27:25,502
but we are standing by,
waiting for information.

451
00:27:25,506 --> 00:27:28,212
I'm hoping to talk to the chief of
police in just a couple of minutes,

452
00:27:28,337 --> 00:27:29,303
get a few more details...

453
00:27:29,305 --> 00:27:31,263
Andrew, honey, would
you please get the phone?

454
00:27:36,018 --> 00:27:39,280
Police have just released the
name of the hostage taker.

455
00:27:39,346 --> 00:27:42,603
It's Carolyn Bigsby, wife of
store owner Harvey Bigsby.

456
00:27:42,907 --> 00:27:46,382
Harvey has informed police that
he is barricaded inside the store...

457
00:27:46,387 --> 00:27:47,922
Oh, my God, Bree, don't you ow her?

458
00:27:48,055 --> 00:27:49,940
Uh, yes, um...

459
00:27:50,715 --> 00:27:53,270
I just... ran into
her this morning.

460
00:27:56,786 --> 00:27:57,843
Uh, mom?

461
00:28:00,048 --> 00:28:01,750
That was Edie Britt on the phone.

462
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:04,140
She's inside the market.

463
00:28:04,836 --> 00:28:06,213
Is she all right?

464
00:28:06,225 --> 00:28:08,990
Yeah, uh, she's locked
inside the manager's office,

465
00:28:08,997 --> 00:28:14,631
but she said that Julie Mayer and
Mrs. Scavo are with the hostages.

466
00:28:23,755 --> 00:28:26,960
Bree, would you mind watching the kids?
I've got a doctor's appointment,

467
00:28:26,966 --> 00:28:30,523
and Lynette is taking her
sweet time at the market.

468
00:28:34,507 --> 00:28:35,991
I'm sorry. Are you guys having a party?

469
00:28:37,828 --> 00:28:41,282
we continue to report live on
the scene as the hostage standoff

470
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:43,660
at fields market enters its third hour.

471
00:28:44,448 --> 00:28:46,280
According to a police spokesman,

472
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:49,493
there has been no further
contact from the hostage taker.

473
00:28:49,585 --> 00:28:51,843
We continue to wait for
the latest information.

474
00:28:52,088 --> 00:28:53,441
No new news at this point.

475
00:28:53,445 --> 00:28:56,371
We will bring you the latest as
soon as it becomes available.

476
00:29:02,827 --> 00:29:03,881
Are you all right?

477
00:29:04,957 --> 00:29:05,672
I'm fine.

478
00:29:05,597 --> 00:29:09,201
I just, I'm running out of food, and it's
not as if I can go to the ocery store.

479
00:29:10,496 --> 00:29:10,923
Bree...

480
00:29:10,948 --> 00:29:13,561
Thank God I found this stale
baguette so I can make bruschetta,

481
00:29:13,565 --> 00:29:15,063
and there's shrimp in the freezer,

482
00:29:15,067 --> 00:29:17,893
so I'm gonna make my
rice and seafood dish.

483
00:29:17,898 --> 00:29:19,232
Bree, this is not your fault.

484
00:29:20,626 --> 00:29:21,623
I had toell her.

485
00:29:22,858 --> 00:29:24,792
She hurt me,
so I hurt her back.

486
00:29:26,078 --> 00:29:29,352
If anything should happen
to Julie or Lynette...

487
00:29:32,898 --> 00:29:34,062
Is there anything I can do?

488
00:29:34,688 --> 00:29:36,320
You can peel a clove of garlic.

489
00:29:38,608 --> 00:29:39,270
Okay.

490
00:29:59,147 --> 00:30:00,412
I wanted kids.

491
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:04,690
I wanted kids so badly but

492
00:30:04,695 --> 00:30:06,583
Harvey had two
from his first wife.

493
00:30:08,886 --> 00:30:10,150
He said it made her fat.

494
00:30:12,678 --> 00:30:13,942
Harvey likes them lean.

495
00:30:15,435 --> 00:30:16,891
I run four miles a day.

496
00:30:16,895 --> 00:30:19,033
This is my first
cookie in six years.

497
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:20,403
You hear that, Harvey?

498
00:30:21,718 --> 00:30:22,973
I'm breaking my diet!

499
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,892
She's starting to lose it
out there. What do I do?

500
00:30:26,236 --> 00:30:29,030
Just keep her calm,
tell her you're sorry,

501
00:30:29,396 --> 00:30:32,530
and see if you can get her to
release the kids and old people.

502
00:30:32,607 --> 00:30:33,851
Okay, I'll try.

503
00:30:39,117 --> 00:30:39,871
Carolyn...

504
00:30:40,536 --> 00:30:43,753
Honey, uh, it's me, Harvey.

505
00:30:44,086 --> 00:30:46,051
Look, I'really sorry.

506
00:30:46,065 --> 00:30:48,492
What I did was wrong,

507
00:30:49,098 --> 00:30:51,263
but I still love you a lot.

508
00:30:51,478 --> 00:30:52,681
Cut the crap.

509
00:30:53,546 --> 00:30:55,651
I had my hair done this
morning. Did you notice?

510
00:30:56,007 --> 00:30:58,743
-Did you even notice?
-Well, I was distracted.

511
00:30:58,778 --> 00:31:00,842
You were shooting at me.

512
00:31:01,266 --> 00:31:02,873
Tell her let the kids go.

513
00:31:03,856 --> 00:31:05,612
Who the hell was that?!

514
00:31:06,986 --> 00:31:08,312
You got a woman in there?

515
00:31:08,606 --> 00:31:10,283
She's a customer!

516
00:31:10,456 --> 00:31:12,052
Don't lie to me, Harvey!

517
00:31:12,376 --> 00:31:14,320
She's another one of
your whores, isn't she?

518
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:16,423
Oh, fantastic!

519
00:31:16,838 --> 00:31:18,782
Carolyn, I swear...

520
00:31:18,917 --> 00:31:19,761
shut up.

521
00:31:20,475 --> 00:31:22,523
I hope you're having a good
time in there, whore,

522
00:31:23,288 --> 00:31:25,242
'cause I got a bullet for you, too.

523
00:31:35,925 --> 00:31:37,173
God, what a nightmare.

524
00:31:38,258 --> 00:31:39,852
You know what the weird part is?

525
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:41,742
What?

526
00:31:43,916 --> 00:31:46,142
I keep thinking about that
crazy lady in the market, and...

527
00:31:47,277 --> 00:31:49,182
I understand her.

528
00:31:50,755 --> 00:31:52,502
I could be her.

529
00:31:54,028 --> 00:31:54,902
Come on.

530
00:31:58,498 --> 00:31:59,432
No, I mean it.

531
00:32:00,367 --> 00:32:02,841
The rage that I have felt
in these past six months...

532
00:32:04,068 --> 00:32:06,071
If I had had a gun in
the courthouse today...

533
00:32:06,227 --> 00:32:07,900
you could never shoot me.

534
00:32:09,486 --> 00:32:11,692
I don't know what
I'm capable of anymore.

535
00:32:12,655 --> 00:32:14,961
This divorce has
turned me into this...

536
00:32:15,947 --> 00:32:18,771
bitter, hateful person,
and I don't like her.

537
00:32:20,088 --> 00:32:20,832
Hey, baby.

538
00:32:21,867 --> 00:32:24,930
And for what it's worth, I don't like
what it's turned you into either.

539
00:32:27,905 --> 00:32:30,130
Then let's stop
being those people.

540
00:32:35,255 --> 00:32:35,981
Okay.

541
00:32:37,647 --> 00:32:38,211
Okay.

542
00:32:45,437 --> 00:32:47,970
Hey, just so you know...

543
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:52,102
I heard the woman in there
teaches Sunday school.

544
00:32:55,805 --> 00:32:58,183
A Sunday school teacher
would never hurt a kid.

545
00:32:58,785 --> 00:32:59,532
No way.

546
00:32:59,926 --> 00:33:00,820
Thank you.

547
00:33:03,615 --> 00:33:05,820
I'm sure Lynette's
gonna be fine, too.

548
00:33:06,198 --> 00:33:07,602
Oh, I'm not worried
about Lynette.

549
00:33:08,315 --> 00:33:11,362
Hell, with Lynette in there,
they don't even need that negotiator.

550
00:33:11,508 --> 00:33:14,772
You put Lynette in a room with a woman
who wants to shoot her husband,

551
00:33:15,267 --> 00:33:16,802
she'll have them renewing their vows.

552
00:33:16,938 --> 00:33:17,623
Right.

553
00:33:18,345 --> 00:33:20,141
Lynette is very persuasive.

554
00:33:22,248 --> 00:33:23,713
I give it an hour, tops.

555
00:33:26,516 --> 00:33:29,413
Then we'll all be back home
eating our hamburgers.

556
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:33,660
She was gonna go to
the store tomorrow,

557
00:33:34,538 --> 00:33:36,330
but we were out of hamburger.

558
00:33:39,247 --> 00:33:40,882
I wanted hamburgers.

559
00:33:51,048 --> 00:33:54,150
I hope all this is giving you
a little perspective on our situation.

560
00:33:54,156 --> 00:33:56,142
Shh! She told us not to talk.

561
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:01,901
You're thinking about
your kids, right?

562
00:34:02,168 --> 00:34:04,331
How awful it'd be to
never see them again.

563
00:34:04,337 --> 00:34:06,972
Well, that's what you're asking me
to feel, but for the rest of my life!

564
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:08,302
Nora, please!

565
00:34:08,757 --> 00:34:10,781
Hey, what'd I say?

566
00:34:12,206 --> 00:34:14,681
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
We'll... we'll be quiet.

567
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:17,250
You and your friend are
really startinto bug me.

568
00:34:17,267 --> 00:34:18,480
She's not my friend.

569
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:23,763
-She's trying to steal my kid.
-Nora, shut up!

570
00:34:24,197 --> 00:34:25,133
Is that true?

571
00:34:25,145 --> 00:34:27,241
No! I... we're...

572
00:34:27,535 --> 00:34:29,650
We have... We're sharing
custody, and then,

573
00:34:29,687 --> 00:34:32,052
she tried to
seduce my husband, so...

574
00:34:32,115 --> 00:34:33,703
She put the moves
on your husband?

575
00:34:34,066 --> 00:34:34,992
Why didn't you say so?

576
00:34:45,987 --> 00:34:49,163
That was a shot! We just heard
a shot fired inside the building.

577
00:34:49,167 --> 00:34:51,200
A shot has been fired.

578
00:35:02,326 --> 00:35:04,663
I believe the phrase you're
looking for is "thank you".

579
00:35:07,525 --> 00:35:11,530
We just had a shot. We heard a
shot fired inside the market.

580
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:14,983
You can see police are responding,
taking this very seriously.

581
00:35:15,125 --> 00:35:19,302
We are going to just continue to stand
and watch and wait and see what happens.

582
00:35:25,276 --> 00:35:28,161
It was on television at the airport.
I came as soon as I could.

583
00:35:28,637 --> 00:35:32,113
The last thing I said to her
was that she disappointed me.

584
00:35:33,508 --> 00:35:36,893
Police have just confirmed
that a hostage has been shot.

585
00:35:36,906 --> 00:35:39,921
Repeat, a hostage has been shot.

586
00:35:40,016 --> 00:35:44,550
There's no word on the name of the victim
at this time, but it is believed to be female.

587
00:35:44,555 --> 00:35:45,823
Mrs. Hodge?

588
00:35:48,628 --> 00:35:50,992
When's mommy gonna
be back from the store?

589
00:35:55,895 --> 00:35:59,512
I'm sure she'll be back soon.
Why don't we, uh, go have some cookies?

590
00:35:59,595 --> 00:36:02,013
Mommy said we can't have
cookies before dinner.

591
00:36:04,317 --> 00:36:06,013
I'm sure she won't mind. Come on.

592
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:08,462
Let's go. Come on.

593
00:36:10,286 --> 00:36:12,760
Okay, I gotta keep the pressure
up to stop the bleeding!

594
00:36:16,487 --> 00:36:18,793
Good news is you won't
need that lawyer now.

595
00:36:19,278 --> 00:36:21,480
You are gonna get
through this just fine.

596
00:36:21,485 --> 00:36:24,570
There is a parking lot full
of ambulances out there.

597
00:36:24,577 --> 00:36:26,323
You gotta let us take
her out of here!

598
00:36:26,498 --> 00:36:27,531
No one's leaving.

599
00:36:29,448 --> 00:36:31,023
Listen to me... Lynette...

600
00:36:33,868 --> 00:36:34,653
About Kayla...

601
00:36:34,756 --> 00:36:36,951
Oh, forget it! Forget it!
We'll work that out later.

602
00:36:36,958 --> 00:36:37,492
No...

603
00:36:37,786 --> 00:36:41,130
I don't have... have
later, you stupid bitch.

604
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:42,772
Okay? So listen.

605
00:36:43,095 --> 00:36:44,501
Okay, I'm listening.

606
00:36:46,098 --> 00:36:52,210
Kayla's the only good thing that
I've ever done in my whole life.

607
00:36:53,877 --> 00:37:00,362
I need you to really take
really good care... of her.

608
00:37:01,387 --> 00:37:02,300
Okay?

609
00:37:04,885 --> 00:37:06,482
I don't have all day. Come on.

610
00:37:06,728 --> 00:37:09,082
Yeah, yes, I will, I will, I will.

611
00:37:09,088 --> 00:37:12,630
I will love her like she
is my own. I will, Nora.

612
00:37:13,137 --> 00:37:14,063
Nora?

613
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:16,831
Nora!

614
00:37:26,598 --> 00:37:29,292
Oh, don't look at me that way.
You know you wanted her dead.

615
00:37:31,347 --> 00:37:32,910
How can you say that?

616
00:37:32,935 --> 00:37:37,660
Well, you told me about her and
your husband after I made it pretty
clear where I stand on whores.

617
00:37:38,066 --> 00:37:39,753
I did not want this.

618
00:37:39,815 --> 00:37:42,212
Don't you dare say
that I wanted this.

619
00:37:42,345 --> 00:37:43,063
Shut up!

620
00:37:43,138 --> 00:37:45,032
No, I will not shut up!

621
00:37:45,087 --> 00:37:46,431
What's the matter with you?!

622
00:37:46,457 --> 00:37:49,833
Have you not been paying attention?
My husband cheated on me!

623
00:37:49,978 --> 00:37:50,831
Who cares?!

624
00:37:51,027 --> 00:37:52,552
Who cares? We all have pain!

625
00:37:52,557 --> 00:37:55,232
Everyone in here has pain,
but we deal with it!

626
00:37:55,295 --> 00:37:57,401
We swallow it and get
going with our lives!

627
00:37:57,428 --> 00:38:00,053
What we don't do is go
around shooting strangers!

628
00:38:00,107 --> 00:38:01,171
She deserved it!

629
00:38:01,176 --> 00:38:03,613
Well, maybe you deserved
to be cheated on!

630
00:38:14,327 --> 00:38:16,312
I'm.. I'm... I'm sorry.

631
00:38:16,317 --> 00:38:18,043
I shouldn't have said that.

632
00:38:19,428 --> 00:38:20,682
Yeah, you shouldn't have.

635
00:40:24,496 --> 00:40:27,810
Lynette Scavo had
a dream that night.

636
00:40:28,956 --> 00:40:31,962
It was one she'd had
many times before.

637
00:40:39,625 --> 00:40:40,560
Hey!

638
00:40:41,157 --> 00:40:43,861
Mary alice, are you okay?

639
00:40:45,138 --> 00:40:46,752
Yes, thank you.

640
00:40:47,418 --> 00:40:48,412
I'm fine.

641
00:40:48,836 --> 00:40:51,032
Okay. I'll see you later.

642
00:40:52,287 --> 00:40:55,781
But this night,
something changed.

643
00:41:05,847 --> 00:41:09,072
No, you're not. I can tell.

644
00:41:11,837 --> 00:41:13,280
Please...

645
00:41:14,386 --> 00:41:16,140
Tell me what's wrong.

646
00:41:17,368 --> 00:41:19,530
Let me save you.

647
00:41:19,816 --> 00:41:21,263
You can't.

648
00:41:22,345 --> 00:41:23,493
Why not?

649
00:41:24,165 --> 00:41:28,723
Sweetie, we can't prevent
what we can't predict.

650
00:41:29,307 --> 00:41:31,673
Isn't there anything I can do?

651
00:41:32,647 --> 00:41:33,522
Yes.

652
00:41:35,587 --> 00:41:37,820
You can enjoy this beautiful day.

653
00:41:39,217 --> 00:41:40,920
We get so few of them.

654
00:42:02,876 --> 00:42:07,093
This was the last time Lynette
would ever dream of me,

655
00:42:07,628 --> 00:42:09,121
and for her sake,

656
00:42:09,486 --> 00:42:11,023
I am grateful.
