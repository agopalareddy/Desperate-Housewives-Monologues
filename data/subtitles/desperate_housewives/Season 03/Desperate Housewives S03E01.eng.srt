1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,890
Previously on Desperate Housewives...

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:04,550
I have another child, Lynette.

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,530
You're the one who gave
me permission, remember?

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,240
Not to sleep with a woman
who's carrying our child.

5
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,710
For some, love will wither...

6
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,199
-Do I know you?
-Orson Hodge, Susan's dentist friend.

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,340
While others will
wait for love.

8
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:20,700
For others,
new love will bloom...

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,010
That may never arrive.

10
00:00:32,045 --> 00:00:36,711
Something awful happened on
Lake View Drive last year.

11
00:00:36,742 --> 00:00:38,337
To understand why,

12
00:00:38,351 --> 00:00:42,382
you need to know that when
Alma Hodge awoke that morning,

13
00:00:42,407 --> 00:00:47,089
she had no idea this would be
the day she'd leave her husband.

14
00:00:47,106 --> 00:00:49,983
Certainly, it began
normally enough.

15
00:00:50,005 --> 00:00:53,640
She put away the groceries
per his instructions.

16
00:00:54,827 --> 00:00:59,462
She hung his dry cleaning
exactly as he had requested.

17
00:01:00,386 --> 00:01:04,620
She folded the towels just
as he had taught her.

18
00:01:06,157 --> 00:01:09,493
It was just before noon...

19
00:01:09,567 --> 00:01:11,382
Mama loves her baby.

20
00:01:11,407 --> 00:01:13,213
Does the baby love Mama?

21
00:01:13,248 --> 00:01:14,363
Mama!

22
00:01:14,387 --> 00:01:17,190
Something inside Alma broke,

23
00:01:17,228 --> 00:01:22,910
and she decided it
was time... to fly away.

24
00:01:23,297 --> 00:01:27,432
Of course, she knew better than
to say this to her husband.

25
00:01:27,467 --> 00:01:29,873
He thought Alma was happy,

26
00:01:29,896 --> 00:01:34,763
and Orson Hodge did not
like to be contradicted.

27
00:01:35,108 --> 00:01:40,701
So she waited till
he left for work, and then...

28
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:02,513
Baby, you gotta come down now.
Mama's in a hurry.

29
00:02:02,537 --> 00:02:04,082
Hurry! Hurry!

30
00:02:06,237 --> 00:02:08,673
If you don't get back
in your cage right now,

31
00:02:08,698 --> 00:02:10,292
I'm gonna have to
leave you behind.

32
00:02:10,326 --> 00:02:11,903
Please!

33
00:02:32,668 --> 00:02:35,892
The next day,
Carolyn Bigsby stopped by,

34
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:38,241
and like most nosy neighbors,

35
00:02:38,275 --> 00:02:42,080
she knew you learned
more if you didn't knock.

36
00:02:42,117 --> 00:02:43,871
Alma?

37
00:02:44,067 --> 00:02:45,661
Are you home?

38
00:02:49,478 --> 00:02:50,911
Carolyn?

39
00:02:51,248 --> 00:02:52,733
I'm just looking for Alma.

40
00:02:52,766 --> 00:02:54,350
We had a coffee
date this morning.

41
00:02:54,387 --> 00:02:56,202
She never showed.

44
00:03:01,338 --> 00:03:03,260
We had a bit of a row.

45
00:03:04,135 --> 00:03:06,842
Harvey and I thought we
heard some raised voices.

46
00:03:06,876 --> 00:03:09,541
So where'd she go?

47
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:13,132
Don't know, but I wouldn't worry
about it. I'm sure she's fine.

48
00:03:13,378 --> 00:03:16,593
Orson, no!

49
00:03:18,096 --> 00:03:20,410
Orson, no!

50
00:03:25,607 --> 00:03:30,391
So if I hear from Alma,
I'll let her know that you dropped by.

51
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:47,572
Yes, Orson Hodge was a man who
did not like to be contradicted...

52
00:03:48,945 --> 00:03:51,832
by anyone.

53
00:03:53,486 --> 00:03:56,921
6 MONTH AGO

54
00:03:59,467 --> 00:04:03,290
It doesn't rain very often
in the town of Fairview,

55
00:04:03,317 --> 00:04:07,563
but when it does, it pours.

56
00:04:08,398 --> 00:04:10,352
It was on just such a day

57
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:15,463
that Bree Van De Kamp went on her first
date with her new friend Orson Hodge.

58
00:04:16,038 --> 00:04:20,421
A date that ended
with a kiss in the rain.

59
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:26,600
This occurred just as Gabrielle Solis was
conferring with her new divorce lawyer,

60
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:32,150
and describing in vivid detail her
husband's affair with their maid,

61
00:04:32,176 --> 00:04:36,260
who also happened to
be their surrogate.

62
00:04:37,608 --> 00:04:38,903
Meanwhile...

63
00:04:38,947 --> 00:04:43,970
Lynette Scavo was busy meeting her
husband's illegitimate daugher.

64
00:04:46,205 --> 00:04:50,702
While resisting the urge to
strangle the girl's mother.

65
00:04:51,716 --> 00:04:54,902
This happened just after
Susan Mayer learned

66
00:04:54,917 --> 00:04:59,153
Mike Delfino had been badly
injured in a hit-and-run accident,

67
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:04,383
and was now in a coma at
Fairview Memorial Hospital.

68
00:05:05,058 --> 00:05:06,760
At that same moment,

69
00:05:06,777 --> 00:05:13,892
Edie Britt was putting up a "for sale" sign
on the lawn of the house where I once lived.

70
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:19,302
Edie had also planned to spruce up the
property by washing down the driveway.

71
00:05:19,335 --> 00:05:25,240
But she was pleased to see the rain
had already taken care of that.

72
00:05:25,446 --> 00:05:28,333
This is what rainy
days are good for.

73
00:05:28,987 --> 00:05:32,333
They make everything clean again,

74
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:37,511
which is necessary on a
street like Wisteria Lane...

75
00:05:37,618 --> 00:05:42,521
where everything
can get so messy.

76
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:50,311
TODAY

77
00:06:00,088 --> 00:06:02,370
Welcome, welcome.

78
00:06:03,455 --> 00:06:05,952
Don't worry about the water,
the floors are laminated.

79
00:06:05,988 --> 00:06:06,923
Here's a flyer.

80
00:06:06,965 --> 00:06:10,643
And then the police found her
severed fingers in the garage.

81
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:11,521
Oh, no!

82
00:06:11,545 --> 00:06:14,002
And they never found Felicia's body.

83
00:06:14,037 --> 00:06:16,622
I  wouldn't be surprised if someday
you opened a cabinet, and...

84
00:06:16,656 --> 00:06:17,621
Hello!

85
00:06:17,658 --> 00:06:18,702
Karen, dear.

86
00:06:18,718 --> 00:06:20,992
Have you seen the
marble backsplash?

87
00:06:21,016 --> 00:06:22,772
Oh, I just must show it to you.

88
00:06:22,797 --> 00:06:24,430
Excuse us.

89
00:06:24,578 --> 00:06:27,343
What are you trying to do to me,
you backstabbing cow?

90
00:06:27,357 --> 00:06:29,102
They asked why the
owner was selling.

91
00:06:29,135 --> 00:06:31,053
I told them that Paul
Young was in jail.

92
00:06:31,087 --> 00:06:32,680
They asked why.

93
00:06:32,707 --> 00:06:35,103
Conversation has a flow.

94
00:06:35,225 --> 00:06:36,550
Well, knock it off.

95
00:06:36,585 --> 00:06:38,460
I've been trying to unload this
house of horrors for months now,

96
00:06:38,496 --> 00:06:39,911
and you are not helping.

97
00:06:41,706 --> 00:06:45,302
Those are for potential buyers,
you withered old mooch.

98
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:47,083
Good luck trying to
find one of those.

99
00:06:47,118 --> 00:06:51,031
Maybe you'll have an easier time
with the Applewhite house and
that rec room in the basement.

100
00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:52,553
Get out.

101
00:06:52,815 --> 00:06:54,032
Get out.

102
00:06:54,077 --> 00:06:56,593
Get out, get out, get out!

103
00:06:56,645 --> 00:06:58,811
Edie, uh, do you have
a moment, please?

104
00:06:58,846 --> 00:07:01,113
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

105
00:07:05,808 --> 00:07:08,383
-Settle down.
-Come on!

106
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,073
Is Kayla ready yet?

107
00:07:10,085 --> 00:07:11,000
Just a sec.

108
00:07:11,026 --> 00:07:12,813
Honey, thank you for this.

109
00:07:12,837 --> 00:07:15,340
I know it's a little weird, I mean,

110
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:17,630
to send out a family Christmas photo
with your husband's love child,

111
00:07:17,665 --> 00:07:19,920
but it means a lot to
her to feel included.

112
00:07:19,938 --> 00:07:20,780
No problem.

113
00:07:20,788 --> 00:07:22,563
She's a great little girl.

114
00:07:22,606 --> 00:07:23,332
Okay?

115
00:07:23,356 --> 00:07:25,270
All right, let's do this.

116
00:07:25,366 --> 00:07:29,261
I am just going to,
um, check the focus.

117
00:07:31,538 --> 00:07:32,853
Nora.

118
00:07:33,175 --> 00:07:34,330
Lynette.

119
00:07:35,308 --> 00:07:36,553
What are you doing there?

120
00:07:38,018 --> 00:07:39,933
Well, it's a family photo, right?

121
00:07:42,605 --> 00:07:44,850
Tom, could I,
could I check your tie again?

122
00:07:47,446 --> 00:07:49,560
She sat down so quickly,
I didn't know what to say.

123
00:07:49,596 --> 00:07:52,460
How about, "You're in
the frame, bitch, move"?

124
00:07:53,048 --> 00:07:53,710
Lynette...

125
00:07:53,735 --> 00:07:54,873
No, I am sorry.

126
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:57,523
How much of her crap do
I have to put up with?

127
00:07:57,555 --> 00:07:58,873
First,  it's the
little drop-bys.

128
00:07:58,908 --> 00:08:01,410
Then she's inviting herself
to dinner three times a week.

129
00:08:01,445 --> 00:08:03,040
Now she wants to be in
our Christmas photo?

130
00:08:03,078 --> 00:08:04,741
I'm sorry. No, that's not happening.

131
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,160
Hey, guys.

132
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:07,021
Don't fight.

133
00:08:07,037 --> 00:08:09,292
It's the holidays.

134
00:08:10,686 --> 00:08:12,420
Nora...

135
00:08:13,085 --> 00:08:14,602
this is just for our family.

136
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:18,321
I would prefer if
you weren't in it.

137
00:08:23,896 --> 00:08:25,073
Okay.

138
00:08:26,546 --> 00:08:28,692
Kayla, honey, we gotta go.

139
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:30,630
They're kicking us out.

140
00:08:30,896 --> 00:08:33,531
We didn't say that Kayla
couldn't be in the photo.

141
00:08:33,565 --> 00:08:34,432
Yeah, well, you know what?

142
00:08:34,466 --> 00:08:39,243
If I'm not your family,
then she's not your family.

143
00:08:41,497 --> 00:08:42,692
It's okay.

144
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:45,387
I don't have to be
in the picture.

145
00:08:47,031 --> 00:08:48,502
Fine!

146
00:08:48,567 --> 00:08:49,189
Fine.

147
00:08:49,215 --> 00:08:51,053
No, absolutely fine.

148
00:08:51,068 --> 00:08:53,622
Put crazy at the end, and
we can crop her out later.

149
00:08:53,655 --> 00:08:54,560
Fair enough. Fair enough.

150
00:08:54,597 --> 00:08:55,733
Hey, everything's okay.

151
00:08:55,746 --> 00:08:57,691
It's okay. Come on, guys.
Come on back.

152
00:08:59,746 --> 00:09:01,042
Thank you, Lynette.

153
00:09:01,085 --> 00:09:04,780
Back to the Christmas spirit
that I was looking for.

154
00:09:05,805 --> 00:09:06,833
Ten seconds!

155
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,131
I think this is a little stiff.

156
00:09:14,156 --> 00:09:15,853
I have a really fun idea.

157
00:09:26,676 --> 00:09:28,643
Where are my crackers?

158
00:09:28,698 --> 00:09:31,780
We're out, but I got you a pickle.

159
00:09:31,836 --> 00:09:33,643
Pickles and soup?

160
00:09:33,678 --> 00:09:34,861
Who eats that?

161
00:09:34,917 --> 00:09:36,862
You know, that's all I got.

162
00:09:36,895 --> 00:09:38,951
Ever heard of a store?

163
00:09:45,138 --> 00:09:46,393
You did not just do that.

164
00:09:46,425 --> 00:09:48,871
-I hate pickles.
-Pick it up.

165
00:09:48,907 --> 00:09:52,100
Doctor say I only get
out of bed to pee.

166
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:56,190
Better for baby, remember?

167
00:10:02,378 --> 00:10:03,741
Don't go.

168
00:10:04,845 --> 00:10:07,073
I need you to rub my feet.

169
00:10:07,108 --> 00:10:10,731
-They're sore, and doctor say...
-Oh, cut it out, Xiao-Mei.

170
00:10:10,765 --> 00:10:13,813
The doctor didn't say anything
about rubbing your chubby stumps.

171
00:10:13,845 --> 00:10:15,791
Rub 'em yourself.

172
00:10:16,295 --> 00:10:19,160
You treat me like dirt.

173
00:10:19,398 --> 00:10:22,583
Would you rather go
live with Mr. Solis,

174
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:28,471
in a dingy one-bedroom apartment with
no air conditioning and no cable, huh?

175
00:10:28,716 --> 00:10:31,573
No, I didn't think so.

176
00:10:31,866 --> 00:10:34,212
You are meanest person I know.

177
00:10:34,235 --> 00:10:36,630
I am the meanest person.

178
00:10:36,655 --> 00:10:37,803
You've been in this
country a year.

179
00:10:37,836 --> 00:10:39,890
Modify your nouns, damn it!

180
00:10:39,935 --> 00:10:42,840
What... a... bitch.

181
00:10:46,956 --> 00:10:50,322
I can't wait for you
to pop out that baby,

182
00:10:50,377 --> 00:10:54,010
Because when you do, I am putting you
on the first plane back to Shanghal,

183
00:10:54,045 --> 00:10:59,023
And you're gonna be on all
fours in a rice paddy before
the epidural wears off!

184
00:10:59,876 --> 00:11:03,390
But you promised to get me
apartment in Chinatown,

185
00:11:03,405 --> 00:11:07,761
so I can work for my friend in
restaurant, start a new life.

186
00:11:07,858 --> 00:11:11,152
Tell it to my chinese
friend... sue me!

187
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,393
You know, we do have people here
in the hospital who could do that.

188
00:11:23,426 --> 00:11:24,611
But  I like doing it.

189
00:11:24,648 --> 00:11:26,170
I think Mike would want me to.

190
00:11:26,246 --> 00:11:27,530
Oops.

191
00:11:35,377 --> 00:11:37,992
So have you got the results
of his latest M.R.I. yet?

192
00:11:38,027 --> 00:11:40,461
I'm afraid there was no change.

193
00:11:40,897 --> 00:11:43,491
Well, how long until
you can do another one?

194
00:11:43,546 --> 00:11:45,753
I don't want to tell you
not to be optimistic, but...

195
00:11:45,787 --> 00:11:47,540
Look, I know it's
been six months,

196
00:11:47,566 --> 00:11:49,252
but he could still
come out of it, right?

197
00:11:49,285 --> 00:11:51,053
I saw in the news there
was this woman in Peru.

198
00:11:51,087 --> 00:11:52,750
She woke up after ten years.

199
00:11:52,775 --> 00:11:54,972
There's a reason
that made the news.

200
00:11:54,988 --> 00:11:58,813
You might think I'm naive,
but I know he's coming back to me.

201
00:11:58,845 --> 00:12:00,702
-Susan...
-Don't say it.

202
00:12:00,728 --> 00:12:04,183
You just keep doing your job,
and I'll keep doing mine.

203
00:12:04,228 --> 00:12:05,713
Oops.

204
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:20,631
That risotto was perfect.

205
00:12:21,017 --> 00:12:22,442
Just like you.

206
00:12:23,456 --> 00:12:26,222
Listen, I hope you
saved room for dessert.

207
00:12:26,265 --> 00:12:30,393
I got us something special from a
wonderful little bakery downtown.

208
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:38,002
That is so adorable, but I don't
think I can eat another bite.

209
00:12:38,036 --> 00:12:40,413
Well, here, let me take half.

210
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:46,290
What do you say, Bree?

211
00:12:47,056 --> 00:12:48,673
Will you marry me?

212
00:12:53,226 --> 00:12:55,422
This  is a little sudden, isn't it?

213
00:12:55,745 --> 00:13:00,260
We've only known each other six months,
but I've loved you every minute of it.

214
00:13:02,445 --> 00:13:06,223
-But if you don't share my feelings...
-No, no.

215
00:13:06,965 --> 00:13:08,000
I do.

216
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:10,841
It's just that, um,
I can't help being cautious.

217
00:13:10,847 --> 00:13:14,793
Since Rex, I haven't
been exactly lucky in love.

218
00:13:14,838 --> 00:13:16,723
I used to feel the same way.

219
00:13:17,078 --> 00:13:19,230
When Alma left me,
I was shattered,

220
00:13:19,258 --> 00:13:21,783
but I realize now it was
the luckiest day of my life,

221
00:13:21,817 --> 00:13:25,181
because  it meant I was
free when I met you.

222
00:13:27,798 --> 00:13:29,970
Luck can change, Bree.

223
00:13:30,238 --> 00:13:32,111
Let me change yours.

224
00:13:36,797 --> 00:13:38,201
Yes.

225
00:13:38,927 --> 00:13:40,451
Yes?

226
00:13:40,527 --> 00:13:43,512
Yes, I will marry you, Orson.

227
00:14:08,677 --> 00:14:12,193
Ian Hainsworth
had been miserable

228
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:19,770
ever since a tragic horseback
riding accident had left his
wife Jane in a coma.

229
00:14:20,056 --> 00:14:25,112
For the next three years,
he shied away from all social contact,

230
00:14:25,145 --> 00:14:28,680
because he wanted to be
alone with his grief.

231
00:14:29,947 --> 00:14:34,322
Then one day,
he met Susan Mayer,

232
00:14:34,898 --> 00:14:41,202
who, because of her own tragedy,
was just as miserable as he was.

233
00:14:43,887 --> 00:14:47,040
And a friendship
slowly blossomed,

234
00:14:47,066 --> 00:14:51,852
because as everyone knows,
misery loves company.

235
00:14:51,878 --> 00:14:56,051
And Ian was loving
this company...

236
00:14:56,526 --> 00:15:00,611
more and more every day.

237
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,760
Two...

238
00:15:07,347 --> 00:15:10,802
Three... Oh, itch,
itch, itch, itch, itch.

239
00:15:10,897 --> 00:15:12,241
Do the nurses know you do this?

240
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:13,411
Oh, hey!

241
00:15:13,437 --> 00:15:14,932
Um, you weren't
supposed to see that.

242
00:15:14,967 --> 00:15:16,140
Well, clearly.

243
00:15:16,175 --> 00:15:19,920
Now, you can buy my silence if
you'll have coffee with me.

244
00:15:19,956 --> 00:15:22,080
Oh, I would love to,
but I think I'm in a rush here.

245
00:15:22,117 --> 00:15:24,313
I'm supposed to meet my
girlfriends for lunch at 1:00.

246
00:15:24,346 --> 00:15:25,090
Is it 1:00 yet?

247
00:15:25,126 --> 00:15:26,540
Well, you tell me.

248
00:15:26,566 --> 00:15:30,233
I notice you're always rushing into
the hall to check the time, so I, um...

249
00:15:30,267 --> 00:15:32,102
Well, I bought you this.

250
00:15:36,405 --> 00:15:38,210
I can't accept this.

251
00:15:38,235 --> 00:15:39,313
This is too extravagant.

252
00:15:39,347 --> 00:15:40,352
Oh, no, it's nothing.

253
00:15:40,388 --> 00:15:42,922
There was a guy on the sidewalk, had
a bunch of them laid out on a blanket.

254
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:46,501
If you look closely,
it says "Folex".

255
00:15:47,478 --> 00:15:48,183
- Still, I...

256
00:15:48,186 --> 00:15:50,932
Please, it would make me
so happy if you'd took it.

257
00:15:53,358 --> 00:15:57,463
Well, in that case,
thank you for my cheap knockoff.

258
00:15:57,686 --> 00:15:58,371
Oh, my God.

259
00:15:58,395 --> 00:15:59,783
I'm late.

260
00:16:07,097 --> 00:16:10,711
COMING SOON...
OUR NEW PRO SHOP!

261
00:16:13,816 --> 00:16:15,390
-Hi!
-Hi!

262
00:16:15,447 --> 00:16:17,031
I'm so sorry I'm late.

263
00:16:17,056 --> 00:16:18,922
No, that's fine.

264
00:16:19,155 --> 00:16:20,370
Wow, white gloves.

265
00:16:20,517 --> 00:16:22,943
What, are we having
luncheon in the 1880s?

266
00:16:23,057 --> 00:16:25,013
Well, it's a very elegant club.

267
00:16:25,047 --> 00:16:27,281
You know, Orson's been
a member here for years.

268
00:16:27,315 --> 00:16:29,962
It'll be even nicer when
they finish the construction.

269
00:16:29,996 --> 00:16:31,790
So you were very
mysterious on the phone.

270
00:16:31,828 --> 00:16:33,010
Why did you wanna have lunch?

271
00:16:33,045 --> 00:16:37,761
Well, I wanted to invite you to
a dinner that Orson and I are
having this saturday.

272
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:41,151
So you asked us to a meal
to announce another meal?

273
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,132
That's so... Bree of you.

274
00:16:44,197 --> 00:16:45,433
What's the occasion?

275
00:16:45,467 --> 00:16:46,662
Oh, um, no occasion.

276
00:16:46,685 --> 00:16:48,591
Just a little get-together.

277
00:16:48,616 --> 00:16:50,171
What are you being
so coy about?

278
00:16:50,207 --> 00:16:51,941
I'm not being coy.

279
00:16:51,966 --> 00:16:53,623
She said coyly.

280
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:57,123
If you don't tell us,
we're not coming.

281
00:16:57,796 --> 00:16:59,620
Oh, all right.

282
00:17:00,277 --> 00:17:04,531
I wanted to wait and make a
proper announcement, but...

283
00:17:05,697 --> 00:17:07,110
Orson and I are engaged.

284
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:08,510
Oh, my Gosh!

285
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:10,321
Oh, let me see!

286
00:17:10,976 --> 00:17:12,381
You move fast.

287
00:17:12,418 --> 00:17:15,410
I know it's quick,
but it just feels so right.

288
00:17:15,446 --> 00:17:20,893
Orson is just the most warm,
wonderful, generous man.

289
00:17:20,926 --> 00:17:22,673
Oh, generous.

290
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,443
That means he's
good in the sack.

291
00:17:24,485 --> 00:17:25,983
Actually, uh, no.

292
00:17:26,007 --> 00:17:27,672
We haven't had sex yet.

293
00:17:27,707 --> 00:17:30,142
We're waiting until
we get married.

294
00:17:37,085 --> 00:17:38,702
Oh, my God. You're serious?

295
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,271
No sex at all?

296
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:42,773
Not even...

297
00:17:42,918 --> 00:17:45,223
Whatever you're
alluding to, no.

298
00:17:45,257 --> 00:17:47,332
But you're gonna get married.

299
00:17:47,347 --> 00:17:51,750
You wouldn't buy a car without at
least taking it for a little test drive.

300
00:17:51,786 --> 00:17:55,320
It's not like you've never slept
with a guy you weren't married to.

301
00:17:55,337 --> 00:17:56,080
True.

302
00:17:56,106 --> 00:17:58,560
I have in the past given
myself away too freely.

303
00:17:58,598 --> 00:18:01,581
How charming of you to bring that up
while I'm announcing my engagement.

304
00:18:01,618 --> 00:18:04,463
But I like to think that I have
learned from my mistakes.

305
00:18:04,496 --> 00:18:07,771
So the dinner is at 8:00, and
when we make the announcement,

306
00:18:07,808 --> 00:18:10,901
Please, everybody,
look surprised.

307
00:18:10,947 --> 00:18:11,650
Okay. No, don't worry.

308
00:18:11,685 --> 00:18:15,951
I'm just gonna replay the look I had when
I found out you hadn't banged him yet.

309
00:18:23,986 --> 00:18:25,890
Hey, sexy mama.

310
00:18:26,256 --> 00:18:27,552
That's cute.

311
00:18:27,588 --> 00:18:29,982
So you invited Kayla to
Parker's birthday party, right?

312
00:18:30,017 --> 00:18:31,572
Of course.

313
00:18:31,616 --> 00:18:32,231
And?

314
00:18:32,265 --> 00:18:33,572
And?

315
00:18:33,595 --> 00:18:34,622
What did you tell Nora?

316
00:18:34,658 --> 00:18:39,892
I told her that we were picking up
Kayla for a quiet afternoon at home.

317
00:18:39,915 --> 00:18:41,893
-You lied?
-Yeah, you're damn straight I lied.

318
00:18:41,925 --> 00:18:45,432
I will not have that lunatic
ruining one more family gathering.

319
00:18:45,465 --> 00:18:48,490
But Kayla's gonna, you know,
tell Nora that we had a party,

320
00:18:48,516 --> 00:18:51,680
and I'm just afraid that
Nora's gonna blow a gasket.

321
00:18:55,587 --> 00:18:56,470
What?

322
00:18:56,508 --> 00:18:59,383
So what are you saying, you're more
afraid of Nora than you are of me?

323
00:18:59,418 --> 00:19:01,172
Is that what you think I meant?

324
00:19:01,205 --> 00:19:03,602
Because that is so
not what I meant.

325
00:19:05,386 --> 00:19:07,332
You scare the hell
out of me, baby.

326
00:19:07,367 --> 00:19:08,811
Thank you.

327
00:19:14,085 --> 00:19:16,402
The coffee machine was broken,
so I got us a couple of smoothies.

328
00:19:16,435 --> 00:19:18,181
They had strawberry
and strawberry.

329
00:19:18,218 --> 00:19:22,711
Well, I hate strawberry,
so give me the strawberry.

330
00:19:27,488 --> 00:19:27,991
Hi, Jane.

331
00:19:28,028 --> 00:19:29,772
Nothing, nothing
against smoothies,

332
00:19:29,785 --> 00:19:32,753
but I wouldn't mind having
some real food sometime.

333
00:19:32,766 --> 00:19:34,792
Maybe we could go
to a restaurant.

334
00:19:34,825 --> 00:19:37,150
You mean, like,
outside the hospital?

335
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:38,881
Yeah, you know, like a date.

336
00:19:38,907 --> 00:19:40,420
A date?

337
00:19:41,885 --> 00:19:44,491
There's a lovely little
bistro down the street.

338
00:19:44,515 --> 00:19:45,310
I'm sorry.

339
00:19:45,347 --> 00:19:47,422
I'm really, really sorry.

340
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:51,933
Uh, well, that sounds, uh, just...
That sounds great!

341
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:54,212
I mean, I hope that's okay.

342
00:19:54,245 --> 00:19:55,453
Yeah!

343
00:20:01,187 --> 00:20:04,430
So, I was, um, I was thinking
about how that sounded just now...

344
00:20:04,507 --> 00:20:06,392
the, uh, the date thing.

345
00:20:06,425 --> 00:20:08,550
I really sprang it on
you out of nowhere.

346
00:20:08,596 --> 00:20:10,541
Yes, you did.

347
00:20:16,495 --> 00:20:17,783
Jane looked cold.

348
00:20:20,837 --> 00:20:21,981
Thanks.

349
00:20:22,645 --> 00:20:26,523
Look, we're, um,
we're both in difficult situations.

350
00:20:26,568 --> 00:20:28,382
I've been in mine a lot
longer than you have,

351
00:20:28,418 --> 00:20:31,382
So, uh, if you're not ready,
I understand.

352
00:20:31,417 --> 00:20:35,602
If you ever should be,
uh, let me know.

353
00:20:35,846 --> 00:20:37,721
All right.

354
00:20:38,397 --> 00:20:40,312
Wow, I am really hungry.

355
00:20:40,337 --> 00:20:45,622
Well, then let's, um, let's go to the
blood bank and swipe some sugar cookies.

356
00:20:48,597 --> 00:20:54,980
Oh, uh, you might want to give jane a sponge
bath 'cause she had a little... accident.

357
00:21:04,046 --> 00:21:04,571
Hello?

358
00:21:04,618 --> 00:21:06,490
Hey, Lynette, it's me.

359
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:08,663
Hey, Nora.

360
00:21:12,008 --> 00:21:13,692
Are you having a party?

361
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:15,793
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet!

362
00:21:15,835 --> 00:21:18,322
Yeah, no, no, of course not.

363
00:21:18,357 --> 00:21:23,040
In fact, we're just having
a quiet afternoon at home.

364
00:21:23,065 --> 00:21:25,151
Um, the kids are so bored.

365
00:21:25,188 --> 00:21:28,021
Tom and I were thinking of
taking 'em out for ice cream.

366
00:21:28,067 --> 00:21:32,100
Well, would you tell Kayla that
Mommy called to check on her?

367
00:21:32,135 --> 00:21:34,263
Oh, I will, I will,
and I'll see you tonight.

368
00:21:34,296 --> 00:21:35,642
Okay.

369
00:21:35,695 --> 00:21:36,783
Bye.

370
00:21:38,936 --> 00:21:40,093
You think she bought it?

371
00:21:40,127 --> 00:21:43,273
No, I think she'll be
over here in ten minutes.

372
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:45,580
Okay, let's move! Let's move!

373
00:21:45,598 --> 00:21:49,513
I've got 10 bucks here for the kid
who can carry the most stuff, okay?

374
00:21:51,556 --> 00:21:53,302
Hey, Gaby, it's Lynette.

375
00:21:53,316 --> 00:21:54,411
Got a little emergency here.

376
00:21:54,448 --> 00:21:56,851
Is that okay if we
use your backyard?

377
00:21:57,628 --> 00:21:59,220
Great, great.

378
00:22:00,307 --> 00:22:04,460
And we take complete responsibility
for whatever the pony does.

379
00:22:04,695 --> 00:22:06,821
Hope  you get this message soon.

380
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:13,183
My only concern would
be the neighborhood.

381
00:22:13,215 --> 00:22:16,331
We really need a quiet
place for our retirement.

382
00:22:16,355 --> 00:22:18,081
Oh, are you kidding?

383
00:22:18,107 --> 00:22:21,423
There's no place in Fairview
that's more peaceful.

384
00:22:21,447 --> 00:22:23,091
Stay off the pony!

385
00:22:23,365 --> 00:22:25,671
Okay, guys, come on, come on! Come on!

386
00:22:27,968 --> 00:22:30,150
Let me show you the media room.

387
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,103
Okay, go on in.

388
00:22:32,148 --> 00:22:33,193
Got the balloons?

389
00:22:33,298 --> 00:22:34,131
Good.

390
00:22:34,635 --> 00:22:35,663
All right.

391
00:22:35,798 --> 00:22:38,843
Okay, all right, that's it.
Everybody's in.

392
00:22:39,885 --> 00:22:41,121
Where's the cake?

393
00:22:41,845 --> 00:22:43,643
Oh, crap!

394
00:22:48,616 --> 00:22:49,702
Yoo-Hoo!

395
00:22:50,847 --> 00:22:51,813
Anybody home?

396
00:22:57,976 --> 00:22:58,692
Hello?

397
00:22:58,735 --> 00:22:59,933
Hey, Nora.

398
00:23:00,538 --> 00:23:03,723
We weren't expecting
you until 7:00.

399
00:23:03,755 --> 00:23:04,751
So where's Kayla?

400
00:23:04,587 --> 00:23:05,532
I thought I told you.

401
00:23:05,567 --> 00:23:07,720
Tom took the kids
to the movies.

402
00:23:09,215 --> 00:23:12,221
You said ice cream.

403
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:14,862
After the movies.

404
00:23:14,898 --> 00:23:17,822
Movies, then ice cream.
An American tradition.

405
00:23:18,486 --> 00:23:20,061
So, is something wrong?

406
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:29,113
To be honest, I thought that you
were lying and having a party.

407
00:23:29,397 --> 00:23:30,492
I guess I was wrong.

408
00:23:30,528 --> 00:23:32,593
Oh, apology accepted.

409
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:34,590
Want me to walk
you to your car?

410
00:23:40,636 --> 00:23:42,970
Where did everybody go?

411
00:23:45,427 --> 00:23:49,532
Nora, look, I am sorry I lied, but you
know, you gave me no choice, and...

412
00:23:49,608 --> 00:23:52,333
Lynette, I want my daughter.

413
00:23:52,385 --> 00:23:55,553
Where's the damn party?

414
00:23:55,588 --> 00:23:56,680
No, I'm not telling.

415
00:23:56,716 --> 00:23:57,713
Where's the party?

416
00:24:12,815 --> 00:24:14,183
No! No, no!

417
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:15,952
If you want in, you're gonna
have to go through me.

418
00:24:15,988 --> 00:24:18,400
I want my kid, Lynette.

419
00:24:18,928 --> 00:24:20,173
Kayla!

420
00:24:20,198 --> 00:24:22,573
Kayla, come out here now!

421
00:24:22,606 --> 00:24:23,772
What is going on?

422
00:24:23,798 --> 00:24:27,493
Well, first you have a party,
and you don't invite me,

423
00:24:27,525 --> 00:24:31,570
And then you lie about it,
so now we're leaving.

424
00:24:31,626 --> 00:24:32,913
Well, wait a minute.

425
00:24:32,958 --> 00:24:35,761
Hold on, hold on,
hold on, hold on, Kayla.

426
00:24:36,185 --> 00:24:38,060
I'm sorry.

427
00:24:38,237 --> 00:24:39,260
We're sorry.

428
00:24:39,295 --> 00:24:41,911
We shouldn't have done that.

429
00:24:41,935 --> 00:24:44,140
But look, Kayla is
having such a good time.

430
00:24:44,167 --> 00:24:45,950
Why don't we all just come
on in and have some cake,

431
00:24:45,988 --> 00:24:47,613
-And we can just...
-Lynette, Lynette.

432
00:24:47,648 --> 00:24:49,501
We can just have fun.

433
00:24:49,535 --> 00:24:51,941
Could you excuse
me for one second?

434
00:24:52,025 --> 00:24:53,242
Lynette.

435
00:24:54,347 --> 00:24:57,371
Okay, okay, I know,
but what else could I do?

436
00:24:57,395 --> 00:24:59,000
I'm just thinking of Kayla.

437
00:24:59,028 --> 00:25:01,971
I know you are, Tom,
and I know you love her.

438
00:25:02,007 --> 00:25:05,173
Why else do you think I'm willing to
put up with all this for six months?

439
00:25:05,206 --> 00:25:07,143
Why do you think I'm willing to
say to my college roommates,

440
00:25:07,175 --> 00:25:10,992
"Yes, that's my husband's love child and
her mother in our Christmas picture"?

441
00:25:11,028 --> 00:25:13,960
Because I am your wife!

442
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:16,951
You always come first with me.

443
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:21,752
Do I still come first with you?

444
00:25:29,627 --> 00:25:31,572
I guess I'll see you later, Nora.

445
00:25:31,606 --> 00:25:32,340
Well...

446
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:33,933
I'm taking Kayla.

447
00:25:33,967 --> 00:25:35,942
Well, that's a shame.

448
00:25:35,996 --> 00:25:38,403
I've gotta go hoist a piñata.

449
00:25:39,558 --> 00:25:42,540
Mommy, they have a piñata.

450
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,623
Fine!

451
00:25:53,555 --> 00:25:54,910
I'll be back at 7:00.

452
00:25:54,937 --> 00:25:59,702
But there had better be a corner
piece of cake waiting for me.

453
00:26:01,737 --> 00:26:04,083
Come on, Kayla.
Go have some fun.

454
00:26:04,136 --> 00:26:05,412
Go have some...

455
00:26:12,786 --> 00:26:14,253
Thank you for that.

456
00:26:14,286 --> 00:26:15,563
Sure.

457
00:26:16,228 --> 00:26:18,303
I'll be back in 20 minutes.

458
00:26:18,337 --> 00:26:20,123
Gonna go buy a piñata?

459
00:26:20,168 --> 00:26:21,991
I sure am.

460
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:24,800
Xiao-Mei?

461
00:26:25,456 --> 00:26:28,033
Come on out! I have your lunch.

462
00:26:30,407 --> 00:26:33,042
Xiao-Mei, your
favorite soap is on.

463
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:36,670
There's a doctor fondling a
patient on the operating table.

464
00:26:36,708 --> 00:26:38,482
You're missing it!

465
00:26:39,125 --> 00:26:40,000
Xiao-Mei?

466
00:26:43,926 --> 00:26:45,172
Xiao-Mei?

467
00:26:59,688 --> 00:27:01,123
Hey, quick question.

468
00:27:01,155 --> 00:27:04,812
Have you, by any chance,
seen Xiao-Mei?

469
00:27:05,988 --> 00:27:07,732
I can't believe
you lost our baby.

470
00:27:07,755 --> 00:27:09,753
I did not lose our baby.
Stop saying that.

471
00:27:09,785 --> 00:27:11,330
I know exactly where it is.

472
00:27:11,355 --> 00:27:16,650
Inside some crazy chinese woman who
also stole half a chicken from my fridge.

473
00:27:23,425 --> 00:27:24,443
Hi!

474
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:25,280
Hi.

475
00:27:25,315 --> 00:27:27,430
Liang, right?

476
00:27:27,458 --> 00:27:28,330
Remember me?

477
00:27:28,365 --> 00:27:29,452
Xiao-Mei lives with me.

478
00:27:29,486 --> 00:27:30,710
You came over. We had lunch.

479
00:27:30,745 --> 00:27:32,653
You got some nerve
showing your face here.

480
00:27:32,687 --> 00:27:33,983
Get out.

481
00:27:35,346 --> 00:27:38,252
What happened to that
famous chinese hospitality?

482
00:27:38,296 --> 00:27:39,261
Xiao-Mei called me.

483
00:27:39,298 --> 00:27:44,660
She said you threatened to send her back
to china to work as a slave in a rice paddy.

484
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:46,771
I...

485
00:27:46,805 --> 00:27:51,173
I may have mentioned deportation, but
I didn't think she'd take it personally.

486
00:27:51,228 --> 00:27:52,291
Are you crazy?

487
00:27:52,336 --> 00:27:53,920
It was banter.

488
00:27:53,946 --> 00:27:58,431
I mean, has this country come to the
point where you can't joke with the help?

489
00:27:58,915 --> 00:28:00,583
You treat Xiao-Mei like dirt.

490
00:28:00,598 --> 00:28:03,761
She's just a poor, innocent girl
trying to live the American dream,

491
00:28:03,796 --> 00:28:06,441
Just like your ancestors.

492
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:08,972
Oh, don't give me that
"we are the world" crap.

493
00:28:08,988 --> 00:28:11,711
That woman's uterus is
harboring a stolen baby.

494
00:28:11,748 --> 00:28:13,892
So if you know where she is,
you better start talking,

495
00:28:13,926 --> 00:28:15,680
or else I'm gonna get the
health department down here,

496
00:28:15,716 --> 00:28:20,060
and take a closer look at what
you're serving as mushu pork.

497
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:28,371
Boy, those people just don't
have a sense of humor, do they?

498
00:28:28,948 --> 00:28:31,843
I'm telling you, at this number,
it's not gonna last long.

499
00:28:31,855 --> 00:28:33,281
Well, we like the neighborhood,

500
00:28:33,315 --> 00:28:36,851
but we've heard that some odd things
have gone on with this house.

501
00:28:36,876 --> 00:28:38,150
Complete fabrication.

502
00:28:38,186 --> 00:28:41,041
Malicious lies spread
by jealous competitors.

503
00:28:41,077 --> 00:28:43,260
Now you've gotta check
out this storage.

504
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:45,781
You're not gonna believe
what you can fit in here.

505
00:28:50,275 --> 00:28:52,202
And now the media room.

506
00:28:53,508 --> 00:28:56,580
Wow, you certainly
devoured that ice cream.

507
00:28:56,605 --> 00:28:58,210
Can I get you anything else?

508
00:28:58,247 --> 00:28:59,472
You tell me.

509
00:29:01,157 --> 00:29:01,891
Orson...

510
00:29:06,156 --> 00:29:07,230
I thought we...

511
00:29:07,857 --> 00:29:08,822
Orson.

512
00:29:09,355 --> 00:29:11,080
Oh, I just assumed now
that we're engaged...

513
00:29:11,118 --> 00:29:13,641
Well, does that change
our core values?

514
00:29:13,976 --> 00:29:15,291
No.

515
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:19,561
But when I saw you standing in front
of the freezer with a clingy silk dress,

516
00:29:19,595 --> 00:29:22,141
Let's just say, well,
that challenged them.

517
00:29:22,297 --> 00:29:25,740
Well, I thought we agreed we wanted
our wedding night to be perfect.

518
00:29:25,778 --> 00:29:28,353
Yes, but actors want
opening night to be perfect.

519
00:29:28,387 --> 00:29:30,233
That's why they rehearse.

520
00:29:30,615 --> 00:29:32,763
It'll be better this way.

521
00:29:34,148 --> 00:29:36,982
Now, can I get you
some more ice cream?

522
00:29:38,525 --> 00:29:39,883
Not in that dress.

523
00:29:54,915 --> 00:29:56,060
Hi.

524
00:30:04,387 --> 00:30:06,512
So I need to ask you something.

525
00:30:08,148 --> 00:30:13,532
Ian, you know, from across
the hall. You met him.

526
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:16,132
Anyway...

527
00:30:17,265 --> 00:30:20,261
He sort of asked me out...

528
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:23,581
on a date.

529
00:30:24,077 --> 00:30:25,901
I know you're thrown.

530
00:30:26,447 --> 00:30:28,033
I was thrown, too.

531
00:30:28,275 --> 00:30:30,541
But he's really nice, and...

532
00:30:32,957 --> 00:30:36,102
I could sort of use
someone to talk to...

533
00:30:38,846 --> 00:30:41,231
who also talks back.

534
00:30:47,218 --> 00:30:48,801
The thing is...

535
00:30:49,458 --> 00:30:51,413
I'm sort of lonely...

536
00:30:52,966 --> 00:30:56,811
and the past six months have
been really hard on me.

537
00:30:58,435 --> 00:31:00,540
So what I need is...

538
00:31:03,137 --> 00:31:06,993
I need to know that it's okay
with you if I go out with him.

539
00:31:10,527 --> 00:31:13,100
Because if it's not, I won't.

540
00:31:13,195 --> 00:31:18,171
In fact, I'd like nothing better than
for you to just wake up right now
and tell me not to go out with him.

541
00:31:18,206 --> 00:31:20,163
Just wake up and tell me.

542
00:31:20,747 --> 00:31:22,000
Wake up.

543
00:31:22,037 --> 00:31:23,562
Please!

544
00:31:30,208 --> 00:31:31,713
All right.

545
00:31:35,847 --> 00:31:37,713
I'll see you tomorrow.

546
00:31:39,307 --> 00:31:40,840
I love you.

547
00:31:50,746 --> 00:31:53,322
It is really just dinner.

548
00:32:02,498 --> 00:32:05,701
I'm just dropping off Carlos,
and then I'll be by to pick her up.

549
00:32:05,736 --> 00:32:07,463
Okay, thanks, Edie.

550
00:32:09,386 --> 00:32:11,183
Xiao-Mei's fine.

551
00:32:11,445 --> 00:32:12,411
Crisis averted.

552
00:32:12,446 --> 00:32:13,971
No harm, no foul.

553
00:32:13,997 --> 00:32:14,662
How can you say that?

554
00:32:14,695 --> 00:32:17,063
You endangered the life
of our baby today.

555
00:32:17,098 --> 00:32:19,370
Don't you dare give
me that attitude.

556
00:32:19,416 --> 00:32:22,370
You have no idea what I've been
going through these past six months.

557
00:32:22,408 --> 00:32:23,170
Here we go.

558
00:32:23,235 --> 00:32:26,462
I have had to wait hand
and foot on your mistress.

559
00:32:26,696 --> 00:32:29,263
I mean, imagine if the day after
you found out about John Rowland,

560
00:32:29,295 --> 00:32:31,791
you had to make his
lunch and rub his feet.

561
00:32:31,815 --> 00:32:33,880
Yeah, well, John Rowland
wasn't carrying our kid.

562
00:32:33,917 --> 00:32:37,030
Forgive me for being
concerned about our surrogate.

563
00:32:37,817 --> 00:32:40,461
Xiao-Mei is going to be fine.

564
00:32:40,495 --> 00:32:43,032
Once that baby comes,
her slate is wiped clean.

565
00:32:43,056 --> 00:32:46,642
She's gonna walk away, go off
and live her American dream.

566
00:32:46,678 --> 00:32:47,202
Me?

567
00:32:47,228 --> 00:32:50,923
I'm gonna be stuck, a single
mother raising a child alone,

568
00:32:51,266 --> 00:32:54,132
haggling with lawyers on who
gets the kid at Christmas.

569
00:32:56,918 --> 00:32:59,661
My American dream
is officially dead.

570
00:33:03,058 --> 00:33:04,590
I'm sorry.

571
00:33:05,788 --> 00:33:07,243
Thank you.

572
00:33:08,315 --> 00:33:11,422
But just so you know,
my dream hasn't exactly...

573
00:33:18,056 --> 00:33:23,801
Okay, so we will see you Saturday,
and please pretend to be surprised.

574
00:33:23,937 --> 00:33:25,112
Bye.

575
00:33:26,028 --> 00:33:27,591
You told someone else?

576
00:33:27,838 --> 00:33:31,313
Bree, I thought the whole point of the
party was to announce our engagement.

577
00:33:31,345 --> 00:33:33,183
I just can't help it.

578
00:33:33,197 --> 00:33:35,132
I like telling people.

579
00:33:35,156 --> 00:33:36,853
Makes me feel...

580
00:33:36,888 --> 00:33:37,372
I don't know.

581
00:33:37,408 --> 00:33:40,092
Makes me feel like
I'm starting over.

582
00:33:40,126 --> 00:33:41,290
It feels good.

583
00:33:41,317 --> 00:33:43,001
Feels good to me, too, though.

584
00:33:45,035 --> 00:33:47,043
Ah, no hands. See?

585
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:55,610
Oh, you don't have to wash those.
I already did them.

586
00:33:55,635 --> 00:33:58,032
Oh, I found some streaks,

587
00:33:58,165 --> 00:34:01,921
so I'm wiping them down with
undiluted red wine vinegar.

588
00:34:02,835 --> 00:34:04,753
I've never heard of that.

589
00:34:04,965 --> 00:34:06,021
Oh, sure.

590
00:34:06,298 --> 00:34:12,011
For tougher spots, I use a 50-50
mix of denatured alcohol and water.

591
00:34:13,946 --> 00:34:17,403
And for those really
intractable stains, I mean,

592
00:34:17,908 --> 00:34:20,211
we're talking shower doors,

593
00:34:20,238 --> 00:34:23,061
I wipe on lacquer
thinner with a towel.

594
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:29,811
Bree?

595
00:34:40,798 --> 00:34:42,203
Oh, Orson.

596
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:58,812
Excuse me.

597
00:34:59,488 --> 00:35:01,251
Did you lose something?

598
00:35:02,108 --> 00:35:02,781
No.

599
00:35:02,815 --> 00:35:03,890
I just thought...

600
00:35:04,308 --> 00:35:05,583
for you...

601
00:35:08,425 --> 00:35:10,450
I don't do that.

602
00:35:10,606 --> 00:35:11,672
Why not?

603
00:35:11,866 --> 00:35:13,240
I'm a republican.

604
00:35:13,607 --> 00:35:15,012
I'm a libertarian.

605
00:35:15,025 --> 00:35:18,971
I believe in minimizing the role of the
state and maximizing individual rights.

606
00:35:19,017 --> 00:35:20,612
But, Orson!

607
00:35:21,776 --> 00:35:22,661
Trust me.

608
00:35:22,696 --> 00:35:24,130
I know what I'm doing.

609
00:35:25,546 --> 00:35:26,840
Okay.

610
00:35:42,668 --> 00:35:43,701
Oh, no!

611
00:35:43,905 --> 00:35:47,130
What, you didn't just crack
that veneer again, did you?

612
00:35:46,965 --> 00:35:48,543
I have to go.

613
00:35:49,335 --> 00:35:50,420
Go?

614
00:35:51,437 --> 00:35:52,841
Go where?

615
00:35:53,645 --> 00:35:56,243
And then it was like
something inside ruptured.

616
00:35:56,255 --> 00:35:58,820
Well, not so much a
rupture as a spasm.

617
00:35:59,275 --> 00:36:02,392
Waves of this hot clutching.

618
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:04,752
I think I might have
had a small stroke.

619
00:36:05,486 --> 00:36:06,902
How severe were the pains?

620
00:36:06,947 --> 00:36:08,292
Well, that's the odd thing.

621
00:36:08,317 --> 00:36:12,890
I mean, there was no pain per se.

622
00:36:12,925 --> 00:36:13,890
In fact, it wasn't entirely unpleasant.

623
00:36:13,928 --> 00:36:16,383
What were you
doing at the time?

624
00:36:17,688 --> 00:36:19,630
I was, uh, with my fiancé?

625
00:36:19,668 --> 00:36:21,852
We were lying down...

626
00:36:22,408 --> 00:36:23,612
resting.

627
00:36:23,866 --> 00:36:25,720
I'm gonna take a
wild swing here.

628
00:36:25,755 --> 00:36:28,220
Were you having sex?

629
00:36:28,857 --> 00:36:30,463
Sort of.

630
00:36:30,516 --> 00:36:34,413
Ms. Van De Kamp, I think
you may have had an orgasm.

631
00:36:35,008 --> 00:36:35,623
No, no, no.

632
00:36:35,647 --> 00:36:37,130
I had orgasms before.

633
00:36:37,158 --> 00:36:38,752
Mm, how would you
describe them?

634
00:36:38,837 --> 00:36:43,743
Oh, you know, that warm sensation, that
tingling feeling of relief when it's over.

635
00:36:43,776 --> 00:36:46,860
-No, no, this was much...
-Better?

636
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:48,270
Yes.

637
00:36:48,305 --> 00:36:50,882
That's 'cause it was an orgasm.

638
00:36:56,258 --> 00:36:57,880
Well, I'll be darned.

639
00:37:31,068 --> 00:37:32,642
Hi. Can I help you?

640
00:37:33,526 --> 00:37:35,422
Are you Bree Van De Kamp?

641
00:37:35,448 --> 00:37:36,870
Yes, and you are?

642
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,583
Carolyn Bigsby.

643
00:37:38,858 --> 00:37:40,503
I was Orson's neighbor.

644
00:37:40,536 --> 00:37:41,862
Oh, well, come on in.

645
00:37:41,886 --> 00:37:44,303
Let's dry you off
and get you a drink.

646
00:37:46,895 --> 00:37:48,871
I didn't come here
to celebrate.

647
00:37:50,068 --> 00:37:50,932
Carolyn.

648
00:37:51,725 --> 00:37:54,403
Engaged again?
That was quick work.

649
00:37:56,235 --> 00:37:58,613
Does she know you
killed your wife?

650
00:38:01,395 --> 00:38:03,313
My wife left me.

651
00:38:04,818 --> 00:38:06,831
And no one ever
heard from her again.

652
00:38:06,866 --> 00:38:09,180
Not me, not her family.

653
00:38:09,767 --> 00:38:12,121
Just dropped off the
face of the earth.

654
00:38:16,297 --> 00:38:18,252
Orson, what is
she talking about?

655
00:38:18,287 --> 00:38:19,950
Didn't tell you that part, did he?

656
00:38:19,985 --> 00:38:21,222
All right, Carolyn,
you've made your little scene.

657
00:38:21,255 --> 00:38:23,773
You keep your hands off me.

658
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:26,401
Don't let him fool you.

659
00:38:26,808 --> 00:38:29,221
Get away from him
now while you can.

660
00:38:33,055 --> 00:38:34,963
Please leave my house.

661
00:38:35,236 --> 00:38:36,443
Fine.

662
00:38:36,757 --> 00:38:38,532
Be a fool. Marry him.

663
00:38:39,615 --> 00:38:42,133
Just don't be surprised
when you go missing, too.

664
00:39:01,765 --> 00:39:03,803
I'm sorry you had
to endure that.

665
00:39:08,686 --> 00:39:10,472
Your wife...

666
00:39:11,315 --> 00:39:13,432
disappeared?

667
00:39:13,898 --> 00:39:15,942
I tried to find her.

668
00:39:16,616 --> 00:39:19,820
Her family claimed not
to have heard from her.

669
00:39:20,457 --> 00:39:24,233
Personally, I think she was
just trying to punish me.

670
00:39:25,066 --> 00:39:28,551
So, are you still married?

671
00:39:28,586 --> 00:39:33,073
No, I was granted a divorce
on grounds of abandonment.

672
00:39:35,628 --> 00:39:36,991
Bree...

673
00:39:38,617 --> 00:39:42,921
-You can't possibly think that...
-No, of course not.

674
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:48,123
I love you.

675
00:39:49,177 --> 00:39:50,761
And I love you.

676
00:39:54,977 --> 00:39:56,781
Orson...

677
00:39:57,108 --> 00:39:58,492
my hand.

678
00:40:25,808 --> 00:40:27,982
The buffet is open.

679
00:40:29,228 --> 00:40:30,551
Bree...

680
00:40:57,247 --> 00:41:00,133
Every storm brings
with it hope...

681
00:41:00,536 --> 00:41:05,902
that somehow by morning,
everything will be made clean again,

682
00:41:05,948 --> 00:41:10,390
and even the most troubling
stains will have disappeared,

683
00:41:10,748 --> 00:41:14,293
like the doubts over
his innocence...

684
00:41:16,928 --> 00:41:20,922
or the consequence
of his mistake.

685
00:41:24,898 --> 00:41:28,592
Like the scars of
his betrayal...

686
00:41:33,856 --> 00:41:37,400
or the memory of his kiss.

687
00:41:41,005 --> 00:41:46,461
So we wait for the storm to
pass, hoping for the best.

688
00:41:51,286 --> 00:41:55,253
Even though we know
in our hearts...

689
00:41:56,335 --> 00:41:59,753
some stains are so indelible...

690
00:42:00,857 --> 00:42:04,071
nothing can wash them away.
