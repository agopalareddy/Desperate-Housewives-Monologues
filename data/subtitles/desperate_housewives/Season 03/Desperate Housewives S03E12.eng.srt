1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:01,886
Previously on Desperate Housewives...

2
00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:03,800
The last two years
are a blank.

3
00:00:03,835 --> 00:00:05,100
That's a fresh approach.

4
00:00:05,433 --> 00:00:06,400
I believe you.

5
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,296
Mike couldn't place
a familiar face...

6
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,299
Whoever killed her...

7
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,642
The police couldn't
identify a murder victim...

8
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,951
-Pulled out all her teeth.
-There's no signature.

9
00:00:14,952 --> 00:00:17,269
Gabrielle was getting
showered with gifts...

10
00:00:17,416 --> 00:00:18,720
Buyer asked to
remain anonymous.

11
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:19,836
From a mystery suitor.

12
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,363
I'm gonna open up
a pizza parlor!

13
00:00:21,402 --> 00:00:23,068
And Lynette
couldn't believe...

14
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:23,930
Oh, dear God.

15
00:00:24,005 --> 00:00:25,460
What her husband
had done.

16
00:00:25,508 --> 00:00:27,560
I wanna do what...
you wanna do.

17
00:00:27,605 --> 00:00:30,300
Julie's first love
was two-timing her,

18
00:00:31,035 --> 00:00:32,833
And Orson's first wife...

19
00:00:32,948 --> 00:00:33,831
I'm Alma Hodge.

20
00:00:33,836 --> 00:00:34,972
Wasn't going away...

21
00:00:34,987 --> 00:00:36,361
-What do you think?
-I'll take it.

22
00:00:36,615 --> 00:00:37,992
Anytime soon.

23
00:00:42,346 --> 00:00:44,962
Your average housewife
worries constantly

24
00:00:44,966 --> 00:00:48,603
about the dangerous people
she sees on the nightly news.

25
00:00:50,106 --> 00:00:53,201
Which is why she buy
expensive alarm systems,

26
00:00:54,405 --> 00:00:56,502
carries pepper spray
in her purse,

27
00:00:57,547 --> 00:00:59,900
and keeps a gun
in her drawer,

28
00:01:01,955 --> 00:01:05,521
so she can go about her day
feeling safe and protected.

29
00:01:08,866 --> 00:01:11,061
Your average inmate
worries constantly

30
00:01:11,066 --> 00:01:14,611
about the dangerous people
he comes in contact with every day.

31
00:01:17,106 --> 00:01:19,631
Which is why
he takes ordinary items,

32
00:01:20,766 --> 00:01:22,850
And turns them
into weapons,

33
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:25,890
that he always
keeps handy,

34
00:01:26,688 --> 00:01:30,832
so he can go about his day
feeling safe and protected.

35
00:01:32,457 --> 00:01:35,600
What is the difference between
the housewife and the inmate?

36
00:01:37,366 --> 00:01:41,402
The inmate knows
the feeling won't last long.

37
00:02:00,336 --> 00:02:01,501
Delfino, right?

38
00:02:02,586 --> 00:02:03,200
Yeah.

39
00:02:04,465 --> 00:02:05,010
So?

40
00:02:23,195 --> 00:02:24,301
Come on, brah,
let's go.

41
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:25,700
You okay?

44
00:02:30,195 --> 00:02:32,560
Yeah. I guess you do.

45
00:02:33,938 --> 00:02:36,672
Yes, we all need protection

46
00:02:36,676 --> 00:02:38,800
from those who
would do us harm...

47
00:02:41,957 --> 00:02:45,322
And sometimes from
those who protect us.

49
00:02:53,675 --> 00:02:55,022
Wild parties.

50
00:02:56,026 --> 00:02:57,691
Handsome strangers.

51
00:02:58,827 --> 00:03:00,112
Tender kisses.

52
00:03:02,128 --> 00:03:03,301
I had a great time.

53
00:03:03,508 --> 00:03:04,200
Bye.

54
00:03:04,996 --> 00:03:06,863
Yes, there were
many things

55
00:03:06,908 --> 00:03:10,400
Gabrielle Solis liked
about being single again...

56
00:03:12,417 --> 00:03:14,782
But coming home to
an empty house...

57
00:03:16,606 --> 00:03:18,021
was not one of them.

58
00:03:24,975 --> 00:03:25,611
What?

59
00:03:33,738 --> 00:03:35,761
Hi. You're sleeping
at my place tonight.

60
00:03:36,187 --> 00:03:36,902
Really?

61
00:03:38,206 --> 00:03:39,301
What did you
have in mind?

62
00:03:40,566 --> 00:03:42,072
God, I hate myife.

63
00:03:42,738 --> 00:03:44,953
Honestly, did you think
I was gonna sleep with you?

64
00:03:45,367 --> 00:03:46,893
It would be the polite
way to thank me.

65
00:03:47,178 --> 00:03:48,222
Carlos, this isn't funny.

66
00:03:48,227 --> 00:03:50,171
I am scared to death
of this maniac.

67
00:03:50,725 --> 00:03:51,641
Since when?

68
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:55,400
Yesterday you were loving
all the presents, the intrigue.

69
00:03:55,446 --> 00:03:56,932
The guy broke
into the house.

70
00:03:57,058 --> 00:03:59,090
He went from secret
admirer to stalker.

71
00:03:59,236 --> 00:04:01,753
For all I know, he's trying to kill me
so no one else will have me.

72
00:04:02,255 --> 00:04:03,733
Why don't you just
call the cops?

73
00:04:03,895 --> 00:04:04,872
And tell them what?

74
00:04:05,038 --> 00:04:08,561
"911, sobody broke in the house
and left a 6,000 dollars dress."

75
00:04:08,668 --> 00:04:10,743
Okay, so if this guy
shows up again,

76
00:04:10,745 --> 00:04:12,182
what am I supposed
to do, exactly?

77
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:15,703
Nothing. Just having
you here helps.

78
00:04:16,665 --> 00:04:17,670
Now that's very sweet.

79
00:04:18,436 --> 00:04:20,910
Because when he breaks in and starts
hacking you up with his machete,

80
00:04:20,915 --> 00:04:23,410
your screams will wake me up,
and then I'll be able escape.

81
00:04:26,186 --> 00:04:27,200
Glad I could help.

82
00:04:34,345 --> 00:04:35,182
Hey, stranger.

83
00:04:36,607 --> 00:04:37,403
Hey.

84
00:04:37,848 --> 00:04:38,931
You have good timing.

85
00:04:39,406 --> 00:04:41,080
I just got all the
kids to sleep.

86
00:04:41,496 --> 00:04:43,481
Ah, damn,
I wanted to tuck 'em in.

87
00:04:43,578 --> 00:04:46,440
Well, you could
tuck me in.

88
00:04:47,908 --> 00:04:51,001
I thought I smelled
your sex perfume.

89
00:04:51,505 --> 00:04:52,581
Come here. Hi.

90
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:53,841
-Hi.
-Hi.

91
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:57,891
Oh, oh, oh. Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

92
00:04:57,925 --> 00:04:59,161
Don't get me all
revived up just yet.

93
00:04:59,296 --> 00:05:01,882
The printer said he was gonna drop
off my menu on his way home.

94
00:05:02,456 --> 00:05:03,312
He already did.

95
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:06,721
Oh, you didn't look
at that, did you?

96
00:05:06,725 --> 00:05:07,901
'Cause it's just 
a mock-up.

97
00:05:07,906 --> 00:05:10,730
Too late. I looked...
and it's great.

98
00:05:12,576 --> 00:05:13,163
Really?

99
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:17,400
Yes. I love the font,
the color, everything.

100
00:05:17,438 --> 00:05:21,003
I am so jazzed
to see the restaurant.

101
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:23,021
It is so good
to hear that.

102
00:05:27,807 --> 00:05:31,250
So... any idea
when that might be?

103
00:05:32,007 --> 00:05:32,730
Sure.

104
00:05:33,405 --> 00:05:35,293
How  about...
two weeks?

105
00:05:35,296 --> 00:05:35,793
Hey.

106
00:05:37,057 --> 00:05:38,323
You  open in
two weeks.

107
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,423
Yeah. Well, that'd be a good
time for you to come by,

108
00:05:40,428 --> 00:05:43,192
'cause there's free refills,
balloons, music...

109
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:46,171
Might there be
a V.I.P. preview

110
00:05:46,176 --> 00:05:48,700
for people, say,
who bore your children?

111
00:05:51,026 --> 00:05:52,100
-Lynette...
-Yeah?

112
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,900
I don't want you to see it
until it's all done.

113
00:05:57,675 --> 00:05:58,273
Why not?

114
00:05:58,595 --> 00:06:00,180
Because you will take
one look at the place

115
00:06:00,187 --> 00:06:02,203
and then you'll have all
these tips and suggestions

116
00:06:02,206 --> 00:06:03,980
that you just won't be able
to keep to yourself.

117
00:06:04,738 --> 00:06:06,062
You think?
'Cause I just saw

118
00:06:06,106 --> 00:06:08,002
a take-out menu with
a 6-digit phone number,

119
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:09,062
and I kept that to myself.

120
00:06:09,106 --> 00:06:12,543
See? There it is! That snarky,
know-it-all attitude.

121
00:06:12,548 --> 00:06:16,502
What? I am snarky because I point
out one small, glaring mistake?

122
00:06:16,788 --> 00:06:17,460
That's it.

123
00:06:17,647 --> 00:06:19,903
Now you're banned
from the opening.

124
00:06:22,105 --> 00:06:24,293
Fine! Good night.

125
00:06:26,808 --> 00:06:28,303
So... we're not
having sex?

126
00:06:29,536 --> 00:06:31,743
Hey, you banned me
from your opening.

127
00:06:41,015 --> 00:06:43,703
All I'm saying is that I'd
feel a lot safer on the pill.

128
00:06:44,697 --> 00:06:46,840
But if you're not 18,
you need parental consent.

129
00:06:47,028 --> 00:06:49,002
Do we really need to give your
mother another reason to hate me?

130
00:06:49,148 --> 00:06:51,480
She'll hate you a lot worse
if you get me... Hey!

131
00:06:52,856 --> 00:06:53,502
Hi.

132
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:55,281
Hi

133
00:06:58,397 --> 00:06:58,941
Bye.

134
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:00,282
-Bye.
-Bye.

135
00:07:07,725 --> 00:07:09,793
Can't we just keep using condoms
and be extra careful?

136
00:07:10,106 --> 00:07:11,962
Are you crazy?
They're not dependable.

137
00:07:12,006 --> 00:07:14,701
Sure, they are. Why do you
think everybody uses them?

138
00:07:15,246 --> 00:07:16,962
They all have to
pass inspection.

139
00:07:17,007 --> 00:07:18,142
It's too risky.

140
00:07:18,596 --> 00:07:20,380
Condoms are only
85% effective.

141
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:23,201
Mom!

142
00:07:23,638 --> 00:07:25,420
Mom, what happened?
Are you okay?

143
00:07:26,305 --> 00:07:28,580
Oh! I was just, uh...

144
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,776
I lost an earring.

145
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,723
Mom, you're wearing
both your earrings.

146
00:07:35,312 --> 00:07:37,108
Oh! I found it.

147
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:41,800
Austin, I would like to talk
to my daughter privately.

148
00:07:42,238 --> 00:07:43,620
Sure. Call me later.

149
00:07:49,378 --> 00:07:50,890
Why were you two
talking about condoms?

150
00:07:51,116 --> 00:07:52,123
Why were you
eavesdropping?

151
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,472
Don't change
the subject.

152
00:07:53,868 --> 00:07:54,981
Are you two
having sex?

153
00:07:54,985 --> 00:07:57,523
Because I thought that I raised
you to be smarter than that.

154
00:07:57,667 --> 00:08:00,821
Don't you realize that
sex is not fun and games?

155
00:08:00,995 --> 00:08:01,963
It's dangerous.

156
00:08:02,157 --> 00:08:03,763
Every time you turn around,
there's a new disease.

157
00:08:03,765 --> 00:08:05,470
Do you want it to burn
when you pee?

158
00:08:05,505 --> 00:08:07,091
-Mom! Mom!
-Sex kills!

159
00:08:07,226 --> 00:08:07,812
What?

160
00:08:08,427 --> 00:08:09,540
I'm not having sex.

161
00:08:11,296 --> 00:08:11,923
Really?

162
00:08:12,948 --> 00:08:13,573
Really.

163
00:08:15,306 --> 00:08:16,410
Oh, thank God.

164
00:08:18,306 --> 00:08:20,521
If you're not having sex, why were
you talking about condoms?

165
00:08:22,007 --> 00:08:24,903
Because we know two
kids at school who are,

166
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:26,663
and they're only
using condoms,

167
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:30,472
which really stupid because
condoms are only 85% effective.

168
00:08:31,905 --> 00:08:33,393
Yes. That's right.

169
00:08:34,308 --> 00:08:35,851
A condom alone
will not protect you.

170
00:08:38,306 --> 00:08:39,262
I totally agree.

171
00:08:52,607 --> 00:08:53,760
Bree!

172
00:08:53,837 --> 00:08:54,482
Alma!

173
00:08:54,518 --> 00:08:56,602
I didn't know that
you knew Edie.

174
00:08:56,635 --> 00:08:59,923
I told your friends at that dinner party
I was looking for a new house.

175
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:01,521
A house?

176
00:09:01,865 --> 00:09:04,031
Yes, and Gaby
introduced us.

177
00:09:04,975 --> 00:09:06,341
Oh. Well, um...

178
00:09:07,066 --> 00:09:07,821
I don't want
to keep you.

179
00:09:07,826 --> 00:09:11,530
I'm sure that Edie has lots
of other houses to show you.

180
00:09:12,005 --> 00:09:13,111
Nope. We're done.

181
00:09:13,457 --> 00:09:16,452
Alma took one look at the
Applewhite house, am bam...

182
00:09:16,735 --> 00:09:17,961
love at first sight.

183
00:09:18,247 --> 00:09:18,930
What?

184
00:09:18,936 --> 00:09:20,371
We're gonna
be neighbors.

185
00:09:20,728 --> 00:09:21,520
No!

186
00:09:23,636 --> 00:09:24,301
I mean...

187
00:09:24,968 --> 00:09:27,891
I mean, no, Alma,
you can't buy this house.

188
00:09:28,087 --> 00:09:28,710
Why not?

189
00:09:29,006 --> 00:09:30,960
Well, are you aware
of its history?

190
00:09:31,116 --> 00:09:34,463
The previous owner...
was harboring a murderer.

191
00:09:34,637 --> 00:09:35,573
It was her son.

192
00:09:36,205 --> 00:09:38,002
Say what you like,
she was a great Mom.

193
00:09:38,407 --> 00:09:40,162
They had a dungeon
in the basement.

194
00:09:40,277 --> 00:09:43,502
I mean, people say they still hear 
groans coming from the house night.

195
00:09:44,405 --> 00:09:47,500
They're gonna hear groans coming
from your house if you don't zip it.

196
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,463
Don't worry, Alma,
I'm sure that, uh,

197
00:09:51,568 --> 00:09:53,893
Edie  can find you a house that
won't give you nightmares.

198
00:09:54,307 --> 00:09:55,801
It's too late, Bree.

199
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,163
I've fallen in love
with this neighborhood.

200
00:09:58,938 --> 00:10:01,500
And as for that haunted house
stuff, well, that's just silly.

201
00:10:01,988 --> 00:10:03,600
People don't come
back from the dead.

202
00:10:09,806 --> 00:10:11,450
Don't I wish.

203
00:10:15,335 --> 00:10:17,521
I  will not have that
woman as a neighbor.

204
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,023
You have got
to do something.

205
00:10:19,126 --> 00:10:20,600
I said I'd talk to her.

206
00:10:20,678 --> 00:10:21,800
So what are you
waiting for?

207
00:10:21,905 --> 00:10:23,450
The house is dark.
She's not there.

208
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,702
Oh, so you're just gonna
wait until she moves in?

209
00:10:25,706 --> 00:10:27,863
I will deal with it.
Bree, please calm down.

210
00:10:27,866 --> 00:10:28,930
How can I be calm?!

211
00:10:29,038 --> 00:10:31,503
For months, people thought
you killed your first wife.

212
00:10:31,535 --> 00:10:33,763
No sooner does she show up
and clear your name,

213
00:10:33,807 --> 00:10:36,581
than the police haul you off
to ask you about another murder!

214
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:37,923
They just had some questions.

215
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,301
Everybody has questions.

216
00:10:39,436 --> 00:10:41,401
Susan and I aren't even
speaking because of it.

217
00:10:41,437 --> 00:10:42,410
Bree, please.

218
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:45,302
I try to hold my
head up and smile

219
00:10:45,308 --> 00:10:48,271
and just bake more pies
for the church social.

220
00:10:48,558 --> 00:10:50,751
But now your ex is camped
out on our doorstep

221
00:10:50,847 --> 00:10:53,152
like I am hosting some kind
of mormon slumber party,

222
00:10:53,358 --> 00:10:56,300
And I do not know how I am gonna
bake my way out of this one!

223
00:10:57,915 --> 00:10:58,510
Darling,

224
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,532
I swear to you, I will get
Alma out of that house.

225
00:11:01,715 --> 00:11:04,491
I don't care if I have to live up to
my reputation and strangle her.

226
00:11:07,607 --> 00:11:08,872
You're a good husband.

227
00:11:10,985 --> 00:11:12,351
Have you lost
your mind?

228
00:11:12,807 --> 00:11:14,363
I am not getting
you the pill.

229
00:11:15,297 --> 00:11:16,893
Aunt Edie,
Julie and I are in love.

230
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:20,433
Oh, please. It's not love
you're feeling. It's hormones.

231
00:11:20,495 --> 00:11:21,512
That's not true.

232
00:11:21,758 --> 00:11:22,903
Okay, fine.

233
00:11:23,785 --> 00:11:25,383
If you want to...

234
00:11:25,705 --> 00:11:28,393
express your love, you
don't need to go all the way.

235
00:11:28,807 --> 00:11:30,792
Kiss. Touch. Rub.

236
00:11:31,015 --> 00:11:32,802
I mean, whatever happened
to heavy petting?

237
00:11:33,346 --> 00:11:34,790
It's so underrated.

238
00:11:35,505 --> 00:11:36,723
That's your advice?

239
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:41,161
Well, I'm sorry. I've never been good
at getting people not to have sex.

240
00:11:41,265 --> 00:11:42,602
So you're not
gonna help us?

241
00:11:43,308 --> 00:11:47,151
Julie, if I do this, your
mother would have my head.

242
00:11:48,505 --> 00:11:49,711
You should
be talking to her.

243
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:50,971
I can't talk to her.

244
00:11:51,206 --> 00:11:53,213
The whole idea of this
completely freaks her out.

245
00:11:53,638 --> 00:11:55,393
She started screaming,
"sex kills."

246
00:11:57,276 --> 00:11:58,500
So now it's
all in my lap.

247
00:11:59,408 --> 00:12:01,402
God, she pisses me off.

248
00:12:02,515 --> 00:12:06,021
Look, how about I spring
for a box of condoms?

249
00:12:06,245 --> 00:12:07,591
Will that get you two
off my back?

250
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:10,593
Condoms are only
85% effective.

251
00:12:11,257 --> 00:12:12,093
Is that true?

252
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:17,163
Damn. I thought I could coast
all the way to menopause.

253
00:12:17,805 --> 00:12:20,651
Look, we're gonna have sex
whether you help us or not.

254
00:12:21,376 --> 00:12:23,030
We're just trying
to be responsible.

255
00:12:27,217 --> 00:12:27,881
All right.

256
00:12:29,026 --> 00:12:30,581
But just so you know,

257
00:12:30,877 --> 00:12:33,223
the responsible thing
is to abstain from sex

258
00:12:33,477 --> 00:12:35,001
and focus on
your studies.

259
00:12:36,536 --> 00:12:40,181
There. I said it out loud,
just in case anybody asks.

260
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,730
Gaby, I need
another pillow.

261
00:12:45,186 --> 00:12:47,272
All right, don't take the
big one. That's my favorite.

262
00:12:48,115 --> 00:12:49,400
It's only for
one night.

263
00:12:50,146 --> 00:12:52,491
'Cause tomorrow I'm gonna be back
home sleeping in my own bed.

264
00:12:52,636 --> 00:12:53,222
What?!

265
00:12:53,598 --> 00:12:56,701
You can't abandon me!
There's a madman stalking me.

266
00:12:56,965 --> 00:12:58,490
My life is on the line.

267
00:12:58,955 --> 00:13:00,470
Do you know
how scared I am?

268
00:13:01,987 --> 00:13:03,100
You're keeping that?

269
00:13:05,406 --> 00:13:07,310
Hey, I'm scared,
but not of the dress.

270
00:13:29,636 --> 00:13:30,452
Carlos!

271
00:13:31,328 --> 00:13:32,510
Carlos, wake up!

272
00:13:32,997 --> 00:13:34,001
I  need you!

273
00:13:34,337 --> 00:13:36,000
Oh, yeah, I thought
you'd come around.

274
00:13:36,035 --> 00:13:37,330
What? No!

275
00:13:37,847 --> 00:13:38,642
Hey!

276
00:13:38,847 --> 00:13:39,900
He's here.

277
00:13:51,995 --> 00:13:52,520
Don't!

278
00:13:53,607 --> 00:13:55,722
Carlos, be careful!
He might have a gun!

279
00:13:57,167 --> 00:13:58,963
I'm unarmed.
Stop kicking me!

280
00:13:59,008 --> 00:14:01,061
Oh, now you're gonna
give me attitude?!

281
00:14:01,346 --> 00:14:02,862
Gaby, we got him.
Maintain.

282
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:04,463
This jerk has been
terrorizing me.

283
00:14:04,508 --> 00:14:05,571
He broke into
my house!

284
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:07,251
It was a 6,000
dollars dress,

285
00:14:07,376 --> 00:14:09,610
and my boss didn't want me
leaving it on the porch.

286
00:14:10,635 --> 00:14:11,662
Your boss?

287
00:14:13,006 --> 00:14:15,551
Hey, uh, ahem,
I'm sorry to wake you, sir,

288
00:14:16,505 --> 00:14:18,730
But there was a problem
dropping off the gift.

289
00:14:19,756 --> 00:14:22,233
Yes, and she's, uh,
right here... with me.

290
00:14:22,726 --> 00:14:24,500
This is Gabrielle.
Who the hell is this?

291
00:14:25,718 --> 00:14:28,503
Yes, I got your "token of esteem,"
and I'm not impressed.

292
00:14:29,538 --> 00:14:31,802
Because you're freaking
me out, that's why!

293
00:14:32,908 --> 00:14:35,893
No, I don't care how much it cost.
That's beside the point.

294
00:14:38,165 --> 00:14:39,553
Really? That much?

295
00:14:40,026 --> 00:14:42,910
Tell him if he doesn't stop harassing
you, you're gonna call the cops.

296
00:14:43,405 --> 00:14:45,612
Look, I know you're
trying to be romantic,

297
00:14:45,678 --> 00:14:47,802
but if you keep this up,
I'm gonna be forced...

298
00:14:52,637 --> 00:14:53,651
What'd he say?

299
00:14:54,066 --> 00:14:55,172
That's very
sweet of you,

300
00:14:55,176 --> 00:14:57,723
but I am not the most
beautiful woman in the world.

301
00:14:58,005 --> 00:15:00,002
Tell him you're gonna get
a restraining order on him.

302
00:15:00,705 --> 00:15:02,442
Yes, I may be
in the top ten.

303
00:15:02,466 --> 00:15:03,182
Gaby!

304
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:05,092
Hey, I'm talking here!

305
00:15:06,908 --> 00:15:09,001
Your voice sounds so
familiar. Do I know you?

306
00:15:11,305 --> 00:15:12,900
He says I know him,

307
00:15:13,206 --> 00:15:15,102
and that he wants to
reintroduce himself at dinner.

308
00:15:15,638 --> 00:15:17,132
Absolutely not.

309
00:15:17,637 --> 00:15:20,292
I would not feel comfortable
meeting for dinner.

310
00:15:21,027 --> 00:15:21,843
Good girl.

311
00:15:22,515 --> 00:15:23,793
-How about lunch?
-Gaby!

312
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,872
But you have to promise to stop
buying me these expensive gifts.

313
00:15:27,685 --> 00:15:29,363
Because I'm not
that kind of girl.

314
00:15:30,106 --> 00:15:31,660
Well, for that many karats,

315
00:15:31,667 --> 00:15:33,300
yes, I could be
that kind of girl.

316
00:15:34,048 --> 00:15:35,071
Um, I gotta go.

317
00:15:35,415 --> 00:15:36,843
I'll talk to you tomorrow!

318
00:15:38,367 --> 00:15:39,671
Oh, how about that?

319
00:15:40,158 --> 00:15:42,983
And here I was, thinking some guy
wants to murder me in my sleep.

320
00:15:43,897 --> 00:15:45,121
The night's still young. 

321
00:15:53,966 --> 00:15:54,921
How are those ribs?

322
00:15:55,427 --> 00:15:59,820
Ah, just needed some tape.
Man, those guys were hard-core.

323
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:01,673
You really saved my ass.

324
00:16:02,366 --> 00:16:03,100
Don't mention it.

325
00:16:03,516 --> 00:16:05,511
No. Seriously.

326
00:16:06,697 --> 00:16:07,851
Ever anything
I can do for you,

327
00:16:08,528 --> 00:16:09,400
you just say the word.

328
00:16:10,498 --> 00:16:11,353
I'll  keep that in mind.

329
00:16:12,917 --> 00:16:13,730
Hey, Delfino.

330
00:16:17,656 --> 00:16:18,351
Yeah, boss?

331
00:16:19,617 --> 00:16:21,362
You might wanna find
yourself another prom date.

332
00:16:21,896 --> 00:16:23,003
Guy's not your friend.

333
00:16:24,505 --> 00:16:25,200
How do you know that?

334
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:27,420
After those mutts knocked you
around the other day,

335
00:16:28,075 --> 00:16:29,182
Your boy paid 'em off.

336
00:16:31,185 --> 00:16:31,903
You sure?

337
00:16:32,346 --> 00:16:34,123
I saw money
change hands.

338
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,750
Just watch your back.

339
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:46,850
So I was in the middle
of totally freaking out

340
00:16:46,885 --> 00:16:49,150
when Julie assured me
that she's not having sex.

341
00:16:49,638 --> 00:16:51,170
I can't tell you
how relieved I was.

342
00:16:51,966 --> 00:16:52,703
Uh-huh.

343
00:16:53,837 --> 00:16:56,750
Don't say "uh-huh" like that.
Julie wouldn't lie to me.

344
00:16:56,796 --> 00:16:59,641
She says she's not having sex,
then she's not having sex.

345
00:17:00,537 --> 00:17:01,300
Ooh-kay.

346
00:17:02,365 --> 00:17:04,203
You can't say "ooh-kay"
like that, either.

347
00:17:04,545 --> 00:17:07,320
Julie's not like other girls.
She's a straight-A student.

348
00:17:07,885 --> 00:17:09,570
And you were
valedictorian.

349
00:17:09,907 --> 00:17:11,800
What were you up to that
your mother didn't know about?

350
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:17,140
Okay, you search the closet.
I'm gonna look under the bed.

351
00:17:17,318 --> 00:17:19,841
Wait, wait, wait.
First rule of ransacking...

352
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:23,422
Remember where
everything goes.

353
00:17:23,948 --> 00:17:26,043
You are gonna make a really
good mother someday.

354
00:17:26,715 --> 00:17:29,332
So what does this
diary look like?

355
00:17:29,367 --> 00:17:31,760
Uh, it's small.
It's got a plaid cover.

356
00:17:31,806 --> 00:17:33,972
Oh, and when you find it,
you have to read it,

357
00:17:34,025 --> 00:17:36,413
because I promised her that I
would always respect her privacy.

358
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:38,033
Now help me
flip this mattress.

359
00:17:38,116 --> 00:17:39,130
Oh( Oh, my God!

360
00:17:39,347 --> 00:17:40,222
You found it?

361
00:17:40,696 --> 00:17:42,202
This is adorable!

362
00:17:42,767 --> 00:17:45,503
-You think maybe I could...
-No, you cannot borrow it.

363
00:17:46,506 --> 00:17:47,103
Fine.

364
00:17:48,876 --> 00:17:50,551
Why does Julie
have a VCR?

365
00:17:51,298 --> 00:17:52,302
To watch movies.

366
00:17:52,826 --> 00:17:55,942
Please. Kids don't watch videos
anymore. Everything's digital.

367
00:18:02,846 --> 00:18:04,582
See? It's just a tape.

368
00:18:08,786 --> 00:18:09,502
Is it?

369
00:18:25,808 --> 00:18:26,411
Alma.

370
00:18:28,075 --> 00:18:29,122
What do you think
you're doing?

371
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:32,500
Measuring for drapes.

372
00:18:33,035 --> 00:18:34,340
I'm thinking damask.

373
00:18:35,377 --> 00:18:36,451
You know
what I mean.

374
00:18:38,496 --> 00:18:39,571
Why have you
moved here?

375
00:18:40,216 --> 00:18:42,130
Well, it's a very
nice street,

376
00:18:42,936 --> 00:18:44,672
and I've made
friends here.

377
00:18:46,287 --> 00:18:48,603
People have taken
such an interest in me.

378
00:18:48,808 --> 00:18:50,103
Yeah, they thought
you were dead.

379
00:18:51,045 --> 00:18:54,233
The novelty of your not being
a corpse can't last forever.

380
00:18:55,257 --> 00:18:56,400
What are you
after, hmm?

381
00:18:56,938 --> 00:18:58,971
Are you still
punishing me?

382
00:18:59,336 --> 00:19:01,002
You want me to pay
you to leave? What?

383
00:19:02,805 --> 00:19:04,500
I want what I've
always wanted...

384
00:19:05,565 --> 00:19:06,201
You.

385
00:19:08,506 --> 00:19:09,890
I'm married.

386
00:19:11,188 --> 00:19:13,481
And even if I weren't,
I don't love you.

387
00:19:15,465 --> 00:19:17,001
You didn't love
the old Alma.

388
00:19:17,435 --> 00:19:18,701
I'm not that
woman anymore.

389
00:19:19,318 --> 00:19:20,920
I'm stronger,
more confident.

390
00:19:21,908 --> 00:19:24,903
It may take you a while
to see that, but I can wait.

391
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:27,261
Alma, I love Bree.

392
00:19:28,117 --> 00:19:29,440
But does she love you?

393
00:19:30,648 --> 00:19:33,550
Oh, she may love
the Orson she knows...

394
00:19:35,195 --> 00:19:37,160
But does she know
what you did to Monique?

395
00:19:39,267 --> 00:19:41,701
Does she know you
ran over Mike Delfino?

396
00:19:43,528 --> 00:19:44,550
I know all that.

397
00:19:45,956 --> 00:19:46,971
I still love you.

398
00:19:48,808 --> 00:19:49,531
Would she?

399
00:20:01,537 --> 00:20:03,211
So I see you've
spoken to Mother.

400
00:20:05,065 --> 00:20:08,623
Yes. It's nice to have someone
on my side in all of this.

401
00:20:11,025 --> 00:20:13,403
Don't worry.
I won't tell Bree.

402
00:20:13,696 --> 00:20:14,910
She might go
to the police,

403
00:20:16,187 --> 00:20:17,581
And you're no good
to me in jail.

404
00:20:21,198 --> 00:20:23,341
But if I thought I had
no chance with you,

405
00:20:23,786 --> 00:20:25,111
no chance at all...

406
00:20:26,135 --> 00:20:28,832
Well, there'd be nothing
to stop me from telling.

407
00:20:31,407 --> 00:20:32,400
Please, Orson,

408
00:20:34,696 --> 00:20:35,882
Don't take
away my hope.

409
00:20:50,117 --> 00:20:50,900
She's not going.

410
00:20:52,406 --> 00:20:53,183
Why not?

411
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:56,071
And what the hell was
that on the porch?!

412
00:20:57,025 --> 00:21:00,021
She kissed me good-bye.
What was I supposed to do, slug her?

413
00:21:00,318 --> 00:21:02,561
You went over there to
read her the right act.

414
00:21:02,565 --> 00:21:04,961
Instead, it looked like you were
reading her a bedtime story.

415
00:21:04,967 --> 00:21:07,852
Bree, I told her
we don't want her here.

416
00:21:08,027 --> 00:21:09,563
I threatened, I shouted.

417
00:21:09,905 --> 00:21:11,252
She refuses to go.

418
00:21:11,706 --> 00:21:13,300
We're just gonna have
to make the best of it.

419
00:21:19,106 --> 00:21:20,490
Hello?

420
00:21:20,786 --> 00:21:23,531
Hey, it's me.
You wanna meet for lunch?

421
00:21:24,038 --> 00:21:25,360
No, honey, I got...

422
00:21:25,408 --> 00:21:27,670
I gotta drive to greendale
to picout napkins.

423
00:21:27,967 --> 00:21:29,391
Remember?
I told you.

424
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:31,911
Oh. Yeah, that's right.

425
00:21:31,976 --> 00:21:33,882
So I'll, um,
I'll see you tonight.

426
00:21:34,205 --> 00:21:36,301
Okay. Good.
I'll see ya.

427
00:22:04,105 --> 00:22:06,763
Oh... my... God.

428
00:22:11,928 --> 00:22:13,400
Hey, Mrs. Scavo.

429
00:22:14,178 --> 00:22:15,111
Andrew, hi!

430
00:22:15,627 --> 00:22:17,593
I thought you weren't
starting until the opening.

431
00:22:18,076 --> 00:22:20,303
Oh, yeah, there's just so much
work that needs to be done.

432
00:22:20,335 --> 00:22:21,951
Mr. Scavo asked me
to start early.

433
00:22:23,865 --> 00:22:25,002
He's not here,
by the way.

434
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:28,451
Yeah, I know. And hey,
don't tell him I stopped by.

435
00:22:28,456 --> 00:22:32,141
I'm not supposed to be here.
I just wanted to sneak a peek.

436
00:22:36,008 --> 00:22:37,003
Shouldn't you
be working?

437
00:22:38,376 --> 00:22:40,152
Shouldn't you
not be here?

438
00:22:41,065 --> 00:22:41,692
Touché.

439
00:22:42,947 --> 00:22:44,581
So, uh, how do you
like the place?

440
00:22:45,805 --> 00:22:48,322
I think it's fantastic.

441
00:22:48,775 --> 00:22:51,932
It's really coming together.
Oh, I love the bar.

442
00:22:52,505 --> 00:22:54,162
Oh, yeah, it's, uh,
it's pretty cool.

443
00:22:54,305 --> 00:22:56,202
It's too bad we can't
get a liquor license.

444
00:22:56,706 --> 00:22:57,310
What?

445
00:22:58,226 --> 00:23:00,202
Oh, uh, didn't
Mr. Scavo tell you?

446
00:23:01,228 --> 00:23:03,083
No... he didn't.

447
00:23:04,406 --> 00:23:08,352
Don't, um, restaurants make
half their money on the liquor?

448
00:23:08,667 --> 00:23:11,220
Oh. Yeah. We're
completely screwed.

449
00:23:11,896 --> 00:23:13,791
This is a nightmare.

450
00:23:14,376 --> 00:23:15,701
How did this happen?

451
00:23:16,417 --> 00:23:18,380
The city rezoned and said

452
00:23:18,388 --> 00:23:20,791
he had to get all the residents
within a block to sign a waiver,

453
00:23:21,395 --> 00:23:22,563
and there are
some holdouts.

454
00:23:22,757 --> 00:23:23,632
He's kinda bummin'.

455
00:23:23,838 --> 00:23:27,003
Well, then why isn't he dealing with
it Instead of shopping for napkins?

456
00:23:31,428 --> 00:23:33,450
We could lose our
shirts in this dump!

457
00:23:36,645 --> 00:23:38,160
Is this Dr. Marvin Tashman?

458
00:23:39,266 --> 00:23:41,031
Hi. My name
is Susan Mayer.

459
00:23:41,157 --> 00:23:43,073
My daughter Julie
came in to see you...

460
00:23:44,195 --> 00:23:45,552
Yes, about birth control.

461
00:23:45,806 --> 00:23:47,201
So I'm just curious...

462
00:23:47,907 --> 00:23:51,672
Where do you get off prescribing
that without my consent?!

463
00:23:53,758 --> 00:23:56,371
What?! No, I most
certainly was not there.

464
00:23:57,515 --> 00:23:58,432
What do I look like?

465
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:01,090
I don't have blonde hair.

466
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:09,591
Wait, did my blonde
hair have dark roots?

467
00:24:13,155 --> 00:24:15,603
I forgot to give you
the keys to the shed.

468
00:24:17,746 --> 00:24:20,220
You got my daughter
the pill?!

469
00:24:21,048 --> 00:24:22,131
Here. Catch.

470
00:24:25,838 --> 00:24:27,701
Don't you walk
away from me!

471
00:24:28,897 --> 00:24:31,453
-Do we have to do this now?
-Yes, we do.

472
00:24:31,796 --> 00:24:34,221
You might have gotten your
first diaphragm with milk money,

473
00:24:34,247 --> 00:24:36,841
but that doesn't give you the
right to corrupt my daughter! 

474
00:24:36,885 --> 00:24:38,701
Look, it's not like I went
after Julie and said,

475
00:24:38,868 --> 00:24:41,321
"Hey, do you wanna go out for a
burger and some birth control?"

476
00:24:41,427 --> 00:24:42,762
She came to me.

477
00:24:42,766 --> 00:24:45,212
You do not get to
decide this for her!

478
00:24:45,216 --> 00:24:46,662
What were
you thinking?!

479
00:24:47,076 --> 00:24:49,592
I was thinking,
if Julie got knocked up,

480
00:24:50,127 --> 00:24:52,491
that you and I could become
family, and I'm sorry,

481
00:24:52,506 --> 00:24:54,243
-I cannot take that chance.
-Oh, you know what?

482
00:24:54,245 --> 00:24:58,022
It wasn't till your rotten nephew came
to town that Julie was a perfect kid.

483
00:24:58,218 --> 00:25:01,502
And now she's lying and scheming
and having casual sex!

484
00:25:02,006 --> 00:25:04,391
She's just a boob job
away from being you!

485
00:25:04,608 --> 00:25:07,200
Look, Mayer,
Julie has discovered sex.

486
00:25:07,235 --> 00:25:08,891
The genie is out
of the bottle.

487
00:25:09,255 --> 00:25:11,692
And you better get good with it,
or you could lose her forever.

488
00:25:12,217 --> 00:25:14,480
'Cause like it or not,
she loves him.

489
00:25:15,668 --> 00:25:16,700
And you know
what else?

490
00:25:17,517 --> 00:25:18,621
He loves her.

491
00:25:32,996 --> 00:25:34,441
Your gentleman friend
went to make a call.

492
00:25:34,686 --> 00:25:35,970
-He'll be with you shortly.
-Thank you.

493
00:25:58,707 --> 00:25:59,400
Gabrielle.

494
00:26:03,116 --> 00:26:04,163
Zach Young!

495
00:26:04,205 --> 00:26:07,033
Oh, my God!
It's been ages.

496
00:26:09,365 --> 00:26:12,202
Look at you!
So handsome in a suit.

497
00:26:12,587 --> 00:26:13,442
You look beautiful.

498
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:15,011
Aren't you sweet?

499
00:26:17,417 --> 00:26:19,923
Uh, well, anyway,
I'd love to catch up,

500
00:26:19,926 --> 00:26:21,522
but I'm kinda waiting
for someone.

501
00:26:22,515 --> 00:26:23,552
Yes, I know.

502
00:26:29,158 --> 00:26:30,773
So the dress fits. Cool.

503
00:26:38,468 --> 00:26:41,801
I'd like a bottle of your 1982
Château Lafite Rothschild, please.

504
00:26:41,966 --> 00:26:44,133
I'm sorry.
How old are you?

505
00:26:46,536 --> 00:26:47,680
Why don't we say...

506
00:26:48,848 --> 00:26:49,622
A hundred?

507
00:26:50,746 --> 00:26:51,603
So you are.

508
00:26:54,557 --> 00:26:56,701
Wow, someone got an
advance on their allowance.

509
00:26:57,536 --> 00:26:59,050
I was my grandfather's
sole heir.

510
00:26:59,675 --> 00:27:01,741
I'm actually
in the Fortune 400.

511
00:27:03,127 --> 00:27:04,620
Does that seem
weird to you?

512
00:27:05,476 --> 00:27:06,653
I'm on a date
with Zach Young.

513
00:27:06,797 --> 00:27:08,273
Nothing's ever gonna
seem weird again.

514
00:27:11,165 --> 00:27:13,380
Every cent we have
is circling the bowl,

515
00:27:13,388 --> 00:27:15,741
and Tom never said a word.
Why didn't he come to me?

516
00:27:15,975 --> 00:27:17,432
Well, clearly,
he's embarrassed.

517
00:27:17,706 --> 00:27:20,322
-But I'm his wife.
-Don't be dense, Lynette.

518
00:27:20,938 --> 00:27:22,881
Half the reason men
want to accomplish anything

519
00:27:22,895 --> 00:27:24,652
is so they can show off
for the women they love,

520
00:27:24,758 --> 00:27:27,112
and when they fail, they like
to keep it to themselves.

521
00:27:27,618 --> 00:27:28,432
I'm gonna tell him.

522
00:27:28,537 --> 00:27:30,290
I'm gonna tell him
I went to the restaurant,

523
00:27:30,618 --> 00:27:34,980
and that I know he screwed up
and that I'm gonna fix it.

524
00:27:35,408 --> 00:27:37,701
Oh, for God sake, it's bad
enough you cut off his cojones.

525
00:27:37,708 --> 00:27:38,912
Now you wanna
juggle them?

526
00:27:39,507 --> 00:27:41,362
My husband is
in trouble.

527
00:27:41,598 --> 00:27:43,710
I love him. Shouldn't
I want to help him?

528
00:27:43,837 --> 00:27:45,281
Well, if you really love him,
you should help him

529
00:27:45,286 --> 00:27:47,070
without letting him
know that you did.

530
00:27:51,806 --> 00:27:54,452
Yeah, so in addition
to my penthouse,

531
00:27:54,636 --> 00:27:56,630
I also have a château
in Switzerland

532
00:27:56,847 --> 00:27:58,663
and a cottage
in the Hamptons.

533
00:27:58,997 --> 00:28:00,283
That's pretty
impressive, huh?

534
00:28:01,528 --> 00:28:02,790
You got a little chocolate
on your shirt.

535
00:28:04,477 --> 00:28:05,053
Damn it!

536
00:28:05,377 --> 00:28:07,290
-Here, let me get it.
-No, I can do it! I can do it!

537
00:28:07,305 --> 00:28:09,183
I'd like to do it myself,
thank you very much.

538
00:28:12,007 --> 00:28:12,873
I'm sorry, I...

539
00:28:13,005 --> 00:28:14,701
You know, I'll be neater
for you ne time.

540
00:28:15,255 --> 00:28:16,091
Next time?

541
00:28:16,546 --> 00:28:19,101
Honey, let's get real.
You are way too young for me.

542
00:28:20,777 --> 00:28:22,893
I'm two months older
than John Rowland.

543
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,303
Well, John Rowland
was a mistake.

544
00:28:28,638 --> 00:28:29,532
I was lonely.

545
00:28:31,028 --> 00:28:32,083
You're not
lonely now?

546
00:28:33,397 --> 00:28:34,762
You've heard
about my divorce.

547
00:28:35,205 --> 00:28:37,203
Yeah. You were really smart
to get rid of Carlos.

548
00:28:37,267 --> 00:28:38,401
You deserve
much better.

549
00:28:39,698 --> 00:28:41,702
And let me guess,
now you're my upgrade?

550
00:28:42,718 --> 00:28:46,272
Well, everybody knows you need
someone to take care of you and,

551
00:28:47,106 --> 00:28:49,601
I'm rich now. I can give
you anything you want.

552
00:28:50,576 --> 00:28:53,522
Wait a minute. Who says I need
someone to take care of me?

553
00:28:54,238 --> 00:28:56,930
My Mom, her friends
from the neighborhood.

554
00:28:57,678 --> 00:28:59,402
They said it was the only reason
you stayed with Carlos,

555
00:28:59,408 --> 00:29:00,893
considering
how he treated you.

556
00:29:05,348 --> 00:29:06,321
Well, they were wrong.

557
00:29:07,466 --> 00:29:08,592
Thank you for
lunch, Zach.

558
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:10,163
Wait, Gabrielle.

559
00:29:11,755 --> 00:29:13,792
I'm not that awkward
kid that I was before.

560
00:29:15,788 --> 00:29:16,522
Can you please just...

561
00:29:17,205 --> 00:29:18,500
Please take me
seriously.

562
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:20,692
I'm sorry. I just can't.

563
00:29:22,087 --> 00:29:23,312
I'm not, I'm not
gonna give up.

564
00:29:25,045 --> 00:29:26,202
Oh, sweetie.

565
00:29:27,268 --> 00:29:28,591
I really wish
you would.

566
00:29:35,898 --> 00:29:37,181
For God sakes, Zach!

567
00:29:37,386 --> 00:29:39,902
Don't hijack a Ferrari if you
don't know how to drive!

568
00:29:46,686 --> 00:29:47,460
Mr. Gaunt?

569
00:29:47,506 --> 00:29:49,142
Hi, I'm Lynette Scavo.

570
00:29:49,157 --> 00:29:51,800
My husband is opening the
pizzeria right down the block.

571
00:29:51,985 --> 00:29:53,972
If it's about that
liquor license,

572
00:29:54,265 --> 00:29:55,103
I'm not signing.

573
00:29:55,696 --> 00:29:58,070
Please, I've been at this
for hours. Just hear me out.

574
00:29:58,816 --> 00:30:01,803
Well, I never could
resist a pretty lady.

575
00:30:02,668 --> 00:30:03,932
-Come on in.
-Thank you.

576
00:30:06,128 --> 00:30:07,352
Did you live
in Las Vegas?

577
00:30:08,007 --> 00:30:09,893
I was a croupier
for 40 years,

578
00:30:10,105 --> 00:30:13,003
and as you can see,
I had a weakness for showgirls.

579
00:30:13,106 --> 00:30:14,701
I bet you were
quite the player.

580
00:30:15,386 --> 00:30:17,143
You have no idea.

581
00:30:18,377 --> 00:30:19,462
Can I top you
off there?

582
00:30:19,828 --> 00:30:21,792
No, thanks.
Two's my limit.

583
00:30:22,046 --> 00:30:23,333
Well, suit yourself.

584
00:30:24,166 --> 00:30:28,300
Look, I understand your
concerns about the license.

585
00:30:28,445 --> 00:30:30,123
Your neighbors
had them, too.

586
00:30:30,437 --> 00:30:33,802
But they signed the waiver
once I explained to them

587
00:30:33,837 --> 00:30:36,181
that this is
a family restaurant.

588
00:30:36,187 --> 00:30:39,301
No late nights,
no loud music.

589
00:30:39,387 --> 00:30:41,253
If there's one thing
I learned in Vegas,

590
00:30:41,268 --> 00:30:44,661
it's that booze turns most
people into noisy jackasses,

591
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:47,283
And I don't want 'em
puking on my doorstep.

592
00:30:47,698 --> 00:30:51,201
Come on, Harry.
You are my last holdout.

593
00:30:51,927 --> 00:30:53,260
What's it gonna
take? Cash?

594
00:30:54,055 --> 00:30:56,400
Free pizza for the rest
of your life? You name it.

595
00:30:56,638 --> 00:31:00,951
Look, I hate to disappoint a
pretty lady, but I'm not signing.

596
00:31:03,438 --> 00:31:04,093
Harry,

597
00:31:05,198 --> 00:31:08,983
my husband quit his job
to start this restaurant,

598
00:31:09,468 --> 00:31:11,860
And if we can't sell liquor,
we can't make a profit...

599
00:31:11,907 --> 00:31:14,990
And whoa, whoa, whoa,
Harry. eyes up here.

600
00:31:15,735 --> 00:31:16,800
Oh, sorry. I'm sorry.

601
00:31:16,895 --> 00:31:17,522
Sorry.

602
00:31:18,708 --> 00:31:21,730
This place is his dream,

603
00:31:21,735 --> 00:31:25,340
and if he can't make it work,
then it's just gonna kill him,

604
00:31:25,465 --> 00:31:27,500
And consequently,
it's gonna kill our marriage...

605
00:31:27,538 --> 00:31:29,281
And, Harry, Harry,
what did I say?

606
00:31:29,876 --> 00:31:32,271
I know, uh, uh,
I don't mean to be rude.

607
00:31:32,275 --> 00:31:35,372
It's just that my showgirl
days were a while ago,

608
00:31:35,378 --> 00:31:38,420
and I can't remember the
last time I laid eyes on a...

609
00:31:38,898 --> 00:31:40,381
a beautiful woman's...

610
00:31:41,187 --> 00:31:41,862
bosom.

611
00:31:48,157 --> 00:31:48,973
Really?

612
00:31:49,165 --> 00:31:51,410
Well, what if
I were to...

613
00:31:52,906 --> 00:31:56,051
very briefly refresh
your memory?

614
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:04,703
Completely worth it.

615
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:06,190
Glad you thought so.

616
00:32:18,407 --> 00:32:21,472
Come on, baby. Say it one
more time for Mommy.

617
00:32:22,095 --> 00:32:23,871
So you can teach 'em
to say whatever you want?

618
00:32:23,976 --> 00:32:25,900
Oh, yes. These birds
are very bright.

619
00:32:26,248 --> 00:32:27,603
I think they're smarter
than people.

620
00:32:29,808 --> 00:32:31,501
Some people, anyway.

621
00:32:35,857 --> 00:32:38,801
Bree! Come in.
I just made some lemonade.

622
00:32:45,717 --> 00:32:47,080
This isn't a social call.

623
00:32:48,807 --> 00:32:49,803
We need to talk.

624
00:32:50,867 --> 00:32:51,553
About what?

625
00:32:52,568 --> 00:32:55,301
About what it's gonna take to get
you to sell this house and move.

626
00:32:56,156 --> 00:32:57,741
Move? Why?

627
00:32:58,305 --> 00:32:59,813
You're my husband's ex-wife.

628
00:33:00,198 --> 00:33:02,440
You disappeared so people
would think he killed you.

629
00:33:02,787 --> 00:33:05,443
Does my scomfort really need
any further explanation?

630
00:33:07,457 --> 00:33:08,991
I had no idea
you felt this way.

631
00:33:09,078 --> 00:33:09,903
Oh, please.

632
00:33:10,918 --> 00:33:13,352
Orson made it perfectly clear
we don't want you here.

633
00:33:13,955 --> 00:33:16,641
Okay, now I'm
really confused.

634
00:33:16,737 --> 00:33:18,743
When Orson came by,
all he said was,

635
00:33:19,598 --> 00:33:22,092
"Welcome to the street"
and did I need help unpacking.

636
00:33:25,448 --> 00:33:26,563
That's not true.

637
00:33:28,648 --> 00:33:29,193
You know what?

638
00:33:29,976 --> 00:33:31,703
I think I've
said too much.

639
00:33:32,175 --> 00:33:33,103
How about
that lemonade?

640
00:33:36,128 --> 00:33:38,133
Ma'am, where would
you like this?

641
00:33:38,458 --> 00:33:40,371
Ooh, uh, upstairs.
I'll show you.

642
00:33:42,428 --> 00:33:43,973
Here, drink this.

643
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,803
You look a little pale.
Be right back.

644
00:33:50,917 --> 00:33:51,633
Don't tell Bree.

645
00:33:55,477 --> 00:33:56,393
Don't tell Bree.

646
00:34:52,485 --> 00:34:53,321
Are you all right?

647
00:34:54,288 --> 00:34:57,301
I'm so sorry.
I br... broke a glass.

648
00:34:57,508 --> 00:34:58,781
Don't worry.
I'll get it.

649
00:34:59,217 --> 00:35:00,333
Well, okay...

650
00:35:01,086 --> 00:35:02,121
I have to go.

651
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:05,000
Bree...

652
00:35:05,408 --> 00:35:06,082
Wait.

653
00:35:07,826 --> 00:35:11,942
I understand why you might feel a little
threatened about my moving in here.

654
00:35:13,276 --> 00:35:15,103
But in time,
you'll see I'm...

655
00:35:15,756 --> 00:35:16,940
I'm perfectly harmless.

656
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:34,101
So... how was
the mystery date?

657
00:35:34,897 --> 00:35:37,140
Uh, it was fabulous.
Thanks for asking.

658
00:35:38,018 --> 00:35:39,991
Oh, come on.
I want details. Who is he?

659
00:35:40,487 --> 00:35:42,783
He's some global financier,

660
00:35:42,955 --> 00:35:44,990
Saw me on the cover
of "Paris Match."

661
00:35:45,368 --> 00:35:46,800
Good-looking,
just not my type.

662
00:35:47,588 --> 00:35:48,203
Really?

663
00:35:49,756 --> 00:35:52,231
'Cause I always thought that you and
Zach would make a really great couple.

664
00:35:53,378 --> 00:35:55,233
You son of a bitch.
You were there?

665
00:35:55,727 --> 00:35:57,701
Parked across the street,
laughing my ass off.

666
00:35:57,998 --> 00:35:59,550
I can't believe
you followed me.

667
00:36:01,038 --> 00:36:03,892
I thought you were meeting a psycho
killer for lunch. I was worried.

668
00:36:06,065 --> 00:36:09,482
Well, at least until they brought out
the crayons and children's menus.

669
00:36:10,075 --> 00:36:12,760
-All right, off my porch.
-Okay, but don't forget,

670
00:36:12,946 --> 00:36:14,550
you asked me to
watch your back.

671
00:36:15,658 --> 00:36:16,832
Yeah, about that...

672
00:36:17,487 --> 00:36:19,921
I'm installing an alarm
system tomorrow, so...

673
00:36:20,825 --> 00:36:22,752
I'm not gonnaeed you to
look after me anymore.

674
00:36:25,248 --> 00:36:26,223
Gaby, I don't mind.

675
00:36:26,925 --> 00:36:27,581
I mind.

676
00:36:28,298 --> 00:36:30,873
We're divorced. I can't keep running
to you every time I get scared.

677
00:36:31,797 --> 00:36:33,803
I want to be the kind of woman
who can take care of herself.

678
00:36:35,986 --> 00:36:36,702
Well...

679
00:36:38,675 --> 00:36:39,453
Good for you.

680
00:36:44,407 --> 00:36:45,660
I'm still right
down the block,

681
00:36:47,758 --> 00:36:48,812
So if you do
need me...

682
00:36:49,956 --> 00:36:52,213
I won't. But thank you.

683
00:37:01,868 --> 00:37:02,473
Hi.

684
00:37:02,986 --> 00:37:03,703
Hey.

685
00:37:04,617 --> 00:37:05,722
You're home early.

686
00:37:05,828 --> 00:37:08,650
I'm celebrating. We got
our liquor license today.

687
00:37:10,055 --> 00:37:11,193
Really? That's great!

688
00:37:11,385 --> 00:37:14,122
Yeah, Andrew said he went all over
the neighborhood getting signatures.

689
00:37:14,847 --> 00:37:15,562
Good for him.

690
00:37:16,796 --> 00:37:17,891
But I think he's lying.

691
00:37:19,226 --> 00:37:21,041
I think somebody else
got the siatures.

692
00:37:21,947 --> 00:37:26,562
Okay, let's say just for the sake of
argument, rhat someone else did,

693
00:37:26,618 --> 00:37:29,130
someone who clearly
loves you very much.

694
00:37:29,138 --> 00:37:30,373
What's wrong with that?

695
00:37:30,416 --> 00:37:33,400
Nothing. Nothing. Order has
been restored in the universe.

696
00:37:33,767 --> 00:37:35,722
You saved the day.
I'm a loser.

697
00:37:36,638 --> 00:37:38,781
Ah, come on, Tom.

698
00:37:38,988 --> 00:37:41,550
I tried for two months
to get that waiver signed.

699
00:37:41,556 --> 00:37:42,991
You did it in a day.

700
00:37:43,246 --> 00:37:43,992
Like I said...

701
00:37:44,935 --> 00:37:46,853
You can't drown
in self-pity

702
00:37:46,855 --> 00:37:49,522
just because I helped you
with one tiny little thing.

703
00:37:50,228 --> 00:37:52,852
Okay, but if I tell you that
the plumbing's not up code,

704
00:37:52,857 --> 00:37:55,383
that we have termites and that the chairs
won't be there until after we open,

705
00:37:55,438 --> 00:37:57,191
can I drown
in self-pity then?

706
00:37:58,038 --> 00:38:01,160
Why haven't you told
me about all of this?

707
00:38:01,208 --> 00:38:03,862
Because I wanted to accomplish
something on my own.

708
00:38:04,005 --> 00:38:07,091
I'm the man. I shouldn't have
to run to my wife to bail me out.

709
00:38:07,586 --> 00:38:08,152
Ow!

710
00:38:08,207 --> 00:38:12,332
Gambling with our life savings
and not asking for help

711
00:38:12,537 --> 00:38:14,303
doesn't make
you a man.

712
00:38:14,405 --> 00:38:16,530
It makes you an idiot.

713
00:38:16,938 --> 00:38:19,143
Come on, Tom, for God
sakes, we are a team,

714
00:38:19,148 --> 00:38:21,292
and that restaurant
is a huge undertaking.

715
00:38:21,298 --> 00:38:22,503
No one could
do it alone.

716
00:38:22,587 --> 00:38:24,762
You don't ask me for help
with your ad campaigns.

717
00:38:25,338 --> 00:38:25,790
Ow!

718
00:38:25,915 --> 00:38:27,531
I don't have to.

719
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:31,221
You're always giving it
to me, inspiring me.

720
00:38:31,368 --> 00:38:34,352
Remember the mouthwash jingle?
You came up with the hook.

721
00:38:34,535 --> 00:38:36,303
And what about
the Bartlett campaign?

722
00:38:36,468 --> 00:38:38,851
Would I have ever come up
with tango-dancing fleas?

723
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:39,742
All you.

724
00:38:39,855 --> 00:38:41,953
There's nothing that
I have accomplished

725
00:38:41,956 --> 00:38:43,581
that I could have done
without your help.

726
00:38:44,375 --> 00:38:45,991
Okay, fine. I help.
We're a team.

727
00:38:46,605 --> 00:38:47,743
Just don't hit
me again.

728
00:38:49,096 --> 00:38:51,861
So tomorrow, first thing,
we'll fix the plumbing,

729
00:38:52,056 --> 00:38:54,611
we'll call an exterminator,
we'll rent some chairs,

730
00:38:54,616 --> 00:38:58,081
and we will open on time,
and it'll be a glorious success

731
00:38:58,318 --> 00:39:02,571
that you will have achieved
with my help, okay?

732
00:39:03,568 --> 00:39:04,303
Okay.

733
00:39:08,105 --> 00:39:11,111
And tonight I'm gonna slap on some sex
perfume and you're gonna get naked,

734
00:39:11,116 --> 00:39:12,751
and then we're gonna
see who the man is.

735
00:39:15,175 --> 00:39:16,371
God, I hope it's me.

736
00:39:16,626 --> 00:39:18,201
Oh, I'm sure it will be.

737
00:39:26,888 --> 00:39:28,762
Hey, Mom. What are
you doing out here?

738
00:39:34,908 --> 00:39:36,020
Okay, here's the thing-

739
00:39:36,178 --> 00:39:39,302
Don't worry, I'm not gonna
get mad. Just sit down.

740
00:39:47,908 --> 00:39:49,600
You know what
upset me the most?

741
00:39:50,766 --> 00:39:53,361
That you didn't trust me
enough to tell me the truth.

742
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:56,180
I tried to.
You freaked out.

743
00:39:56,186 --> 00:39:59,213
Well, of course
I freaked out. I'm a parent.

744
00:40:00,155 --> 00:40:03,860
You know, we hope that our
children will wait to have sex till...

745
00:40:04,817 --> 00:40:06,003
after we're dead.

746
00:40:06,707 --> 00:40:07,993
And you wonder why
I went to Edie.

747
00:40:08,207 --> 00:40:11,271
Okay, that's the other thing.
That cannot happen anymore.

748
00:40:12,556 --> 00:40:15,703
You and I have always had
an amazing relationship.

749
00:40:17,827 --> 00:40:19,192
Let's not mess
it up now.

750
00:40:20,908 --> 00:40:21,513
Okay.

751
00:40:22,736 --> 00:40:23,431
I'm sorry.

752
00:40:27,206 --> 00:40:29,392
Look, I know you think
I'm too young, but...

753
00:40:30,596 --> 00:40:31,961
Austin and I are in love.

754
00:40:35,646 --> 00:40:36,862
Yeah, um...

755
00:40:39,777 --> 00:40:40,672
About that...

756
00:40:47,527 --> 00:40:50,892
God, I wish there was a pill you
could take to protect your heart.

757
00:40:52,507 --> 00:40:53,230
What do you mean?

758
00:40:56,556 --> 00:40:57,372
Honey, I...

759
00:40:58,048 --> 00:41:00,652
I was over at
Edie's today and,

760
00:41:01,837 --> 00:41:03,253
I walked in the door...

761
00:41:04,177 --> 00:41:06,260
Uh, yes. I need to speak
to my husband.

762
00:41:08,557 --> 00:41:10,002
Uh, yes. There he is.

763
00:41:10,128 --> 00:41:11,041
Would you...

764
00:41:11,646 --> 00:41:14,462
please ask him to come home
as early as possible tonight.

765
00:41:15,197 --> 00:41:15,850
Thank you.

766
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,720
It's a dangerous world...

767
00:41:26,165 --> 00:41:28,403
So we all look
for protection...

768
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:34,230
And whether we find it in
the arms of our mother...

769
00:41:39,255 --> 00:41:41,811
Or at the end of
a jacket blade...

770
00:41:46,766 --> 00:41:49,022
In the kiss of
our sweetheart...

771
00:41:53,148 --> 00:41:55,033
Or at the end
of a barrel...

772
00:41:56,248 --> 00:41:59,101
We do what we have
to, to feel safe...

773
00:42:02,638 --> 00:42:05,912
Beacuse we know
somewhere in the world...

774
00:42:11,607 --> 00:42:14,613
There are those who
will do us harm.
