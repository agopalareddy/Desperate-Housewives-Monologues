NO, NO, NO, NO.

WALK IN UNANNOUNCED.

BESIDES, HE HAS A GIRL IN THERE.

129
00:06:31,369 --> 00:06:32,374

130
00:06:33,472 --> 00:06:35,281

136
00:06:49,338 --> 00:06:52,271

137
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:06,262

138
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,357

139
00:07:08,877 --> 00:07:11,567
GOD, CARLOS!
STRAWBERRIES AND CHAMPAGNE?

140
00:07:11,845 --> 00:07:13,445
DID YOU REALLY THINK
YOU'RE GONNA SEDUCE ME?

141
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:16,404
NEVER ENTERED MY MIND.
OH, RIGHT, RIGHT.

142
00:07:16,453 --> 00:07:18,060
YOU KNOW,
I MAY BE LIVING WITH YOU

143
00:07:18,163 --> 00:07:19,385

BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN

144
00:07:19,483 --> 00:07:20,948
I HAVE TO PUT UP
WITH YOUR CHEESY COME-ONS.

145
00:07:22,571 --> 00:07:23,762
GABY,
CAN I JUST SAY ONE THING?

146
00:07:24,242 --> 00:07:25,882
WHAT, YOU'VE BEEN
DOING SOME THINKING,

147
00:07:26,299 --> 00:07:28,218
AND YOU REALIZE
THAT I'M YOUR SOUL MATE,

148
00:07:28,286 --> 00:07:30,210
AND THERE'S A VACANCY
IN YOUR HEART ONLY I CAN FILL?

149
00:07:30,881 --> 00:07:32,355
GABY, LISTEN--
IT'S OVER BETWEEN US.

150
00:07:32,755 --> 00:07:33,945
JUST MOVE ON ALREADY.

151
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:35,265
FORGET ME.

152
00:07:44,544 --> 00:07:47,358
AS I WAS TRYING TO SAY,
I HAVE COMPANY OVER.

153
00:07:48,143 --> 00:07:50,135
THIS IS TRISHELLE.

154
00:07:52,463 --> 00:07:53,294
TRISHELLE, THIS IS...

155
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:56,149
WHAT WAS YOUR NAME AGAIN?

156
00:07:57,645 --> 00:07:58,670
I SEEM TO HAVE FORGOTTEN.

157
00:08:07,057 --> 00:08:07,689
SO THE DOCTOR SAID

158
00:08:07,809 --> 00:08:10,185
I SHOULD USE AS MANY THINGS
AS I CAN TO JOG YOUR MEMORY.

159
00:08:10,679 --> 00:08:11,562
AND NOT JUST PICTURES.

160
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,672
HE SAID I COULD USE TASTES
AND SMELLS AND SOUNDS,

161
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,432
SO TONIGHT IS...

162
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,006
"SOUNDS OF THE SEVENTIES."

163
00:08:23,382 --> 00:08:24,240
OKAY, UH...

164
00:08:24,573 --> 00:08:26,173
WELL, YOU KNOW,
LET ME SET THE SCENE.

165
00:08:26,845 --> 00:08:29,915

168
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:38,010

WE WERE THERE, AND, UH,

169
00:08:38,314 --> 00:08:40,658

170
00:08:40,761 --> 00:08:42,634

TILL THE MUSIC PART?

171
00:08:43,321 --> 00:08:43,897
OH, IT'S COMING.

172
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,273
UM, AND--AND THIS
'70s COVER BAND,

173
00:08:46,528 --> 00:08:47,480
WELL, THEY STARTED TO PLAY,

174
00:08:47,664 --> 00:08:50,457
AND... THAT'S HOW
WE GOT OUR SONG.

175
00:08:53,028 --> 00:08:54,322
<i>(Rose Royce) * AT THE CAR WASH,
WHOA, WHOA... *</i>

176
00:08:55,096 --> 00:08:56,729
OUR SONG WAS "CAR WASH"?

177
00:08:57,226 --> 00:08:59,142
YEAH!
SEE HOW MUCH FUN WE WERE?

178
00:09:00,383 --> 00:09:02,465
(laughs) SO I DRAGGED YOU OUT
ONTO THE DANCE FLOOR,

179
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,465
AND, WELL, YOU WERE
GIVING ME THIS LOOK--

180
00:09:05,256 --> 00:09:06,601
SORTF LIKE THE LOOK
YOU'RE GIVING ME RIGHT NOW--

181
00:09:06,858 --> 00:09:08,566
AND, UM,
I STARTED TO DO THIS...

182
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,296
AND THEN YOU DID THIS...

183
00:09:15,807 --> 00:09:18,438
I'M--LOOK, I'M SORRY,
THIS--THIS ISN'T WORKING.

184
00:09:18,757 --> 00:09:21,292
OH, MIKE. COME ON, YOU'RE NOT
EVEN TRYING TO REMEMBER!

185
00:09:21,549 --> 00:09:22,397
IT WAS FUN!

186
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,638
OH, I KNOW.
OKAY, SING WITH ME.

187
00:09:25,884 --> 00:09:26,644
♪ CAR WASH

188
00:09:26,981 --> 00:09:29,108
♪ TALKIN' ABOUT
THE CAR WASH ♪

189
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,051
♪ WHOO, CAR WASH, YEAH

190
00:09:34,826 --> 00:09:36,067
YOU KNOW, I'M REALLY BEAT.

191
00:09:37,538 --> 00:09:40,090
OKAY, MIKE, I-I AM NOT
DOING THIS TO UPSET YOU.

192
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:41,329
I'M DOING THIS TO HELP.

193
00:09:42,074 --> 00:09:44,810
I GET THAT. IT'S JUST...

194
00:09:45,881 --> 00:09:47,328
THE MUSIC IS GIVING ME
A HEADACHE.

195
00:09:48,616 --> 00:09:49,191
OKAY, WELL...

196
00:09:49,928 --> 00:09:51,856
I'LL GO, BUT I AM NOT
GIVING UP ON YOU.

197
00:09:52,841 --> 00:09:54,223
YOU KNOW,
YOU ARE GOING TO REMEMBER

198
00:09:54,447 --> 00:09:56,047
THE NIGHT THAT
WE DANCED TO "CAR WASH,"

199
00:09:56,171 --> 00:09:59,375
AND NOT JUST BECAUSE IT WAS FUN,
BUT BECAUSE LATER THAT NIGHT,

200
00:09:59,734 --> 00:10:00,975
WE DID SOME THINGS
THAT, TRUST ME,

201
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:02,706
ARE WORTH REMEMBERING.

202
00:10:12,707 --> 00:10:13,932
THAT JANE DOE
FROM THE GOLF COURSE...

203
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,356
I THINK I MISSED SOMETHING
AT THE AUTOPSY.

204
00:10:17,963 --> 00:10:21,218
CHECK IT OUT.
YOU ALWAYS GOTTA
COME AT LUNCH, DON'T YOU?

205
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:24,394
THOSE BLUE MARKS
ON THE BACK OF HER HAND?

206
00:10:24,678 --> 00:10:27,114
FIRST I THOUGHT THEY WERE VEINS.
NOW I THINK IT'S INK.

207
00:10:28,241 --> 00:10:29,201
YOU MEAN,
LIKE SOME KIND OF WRITING?

208
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,096
YEAH. I NEED TO RUN
SOME MORE TESTS,

209
00:10:31,914 --> 00:10:33,112
SEE IF I CAN GET
A CLEARER IMAGE.

210
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:35,193
I COULD BE WRONG, BUT...

211
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,656
BUT WHAT?

212
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,095
I THINK
IT'S A PHONE NUMBER.

213
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,149
THE ODDEST THING HAPPENED
AT THE CLUB TODAY.

214
00:10:48,613 --> 00:10:49,357
TISH ATHERTON--

215
00:10:52,533 --> 00:10:53,764
(sighs)
ANDREW, WOULD YOU BE A DEAR

216
00:10:53,894 --> 00:10:56,021
AND MAKE SURE YOUR SISTER'S
JUST BREAKING HER OWN THINGS?

217
00:11:03,294 --> 00:11:04,245
ANYWAY...
HMM.

218
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,362
TISH ATHERTON...

219
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:12,319
DANIELLE?

220
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,027
YEAH, I'LL TELL 'EM.

221
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:38,460
I'M TELLING YOU,
IT WAS A DELIBERATE SNUB.

222
00:11:38,876 --> 00:11:40,818
I WAVED TO HER,
AND SHE LOOKED RIGHT THROUGH ME.

223
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,698
TRUE, I NEVER BOUGHT
HER ELDEST DAUGHTER A GIFT--
UH, MOM?

224
00:11:43,882 --> 00:11:45,425
ANDREW, PLEASE DON'T
INTERRUPT ME WHILE I'M SPEAKING.

225
00:11:46,057 --> 00:11:47,953
TRUE, I NEVER BOUGHT
HER ELDEST DAUGHTER A GIFT,

226
00:11:48,369 --> 00:11:52,143
BUT YOU KNOW MY POLICY--
NO HUSBAND, NO BABY GIFT.

227
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,032
NOW WHAT IS IT, DEAR?

228
00:11:55,753 --> 00:11:58,143
WELL, UM, DANIELLE'S UPSTAIRS
TRYING TO COMMIT SUICIDE.

229
00:12:08,518 --> 00:12:10,126
<i>THERE'S NO RUSH.
SHE'S NOT TRYING THAT HARD.</i>

230
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:16,781
HOW CAN YOU SIT THERE
PLAYING THAT RIDICULOUS GAME?!

231
00:12:17,452 --> 00:12:18,995
YOUR SISTER
TRIED TO KILL HERSELF.

232
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,053
THAT DOESN'T UPSET YOU?

233
00:12:20,436 --> 00:12:22,260
SHE TRIED TO SLIT HER WRISTS
WITH A SPOON.

234
00:12:22,668 --> 00:12:23,748
HOW UPSET
DO YOU WANT ME TO BE?

235
00:12:24,372 --> 00:12:26,619
MRS. HODGE?
IS MY DAUGHTER ALL RIGHT?

236
00:12:26,987 --> 00:12:28,530
SHE'S A LITTLE GROGGY,
BUT SHE'LL BE FINE.

237
00:12:29,076 --> 00:12:30,490
THE WOUNDS
ARE FAIRLY SUPERFICIAL.

238
00:12:31,392 --> 00:12:32,298
(scoffs)
SO'S THE PATIENT.

239
00:12:32,795 --> 00:12:33,963
WE'LL RELEASE HER TONIGHT,

240
00:12:34,243 --> 00:12:36,145
BUT YOU UNDERSTAND
THAT IN CASES LIKE THIS,

241
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:39,680
COUNSELING IS MANDATORY.
OF COURSE. WE'LL GET HER
ALL THE HELP SHE NEEDS.

242
00:12:40,056 --> 00:12:41,961
SHE IS RESISTING OUR EFFORTS
TO PUMP HER STOMACH.

243
00:12:42,264 --> 00:12:43,800
SHE SAYS SHE ONLY TOOK
THREE SEDATIVES.

244
00:12:44,288 --> 00:12:46,256
SHE'S DISORIENTED.
PUMP HER.

245
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,328
ANDREW!

246
00:12:50,247 --> 00:12:50,975
PUMP HER.

247
00:12:55,286 --> 00:12:58,109
THEY'RE STICKING A TUBE
DOWN HER THROAT.

248
00:12:58,413 --> 00:12:59,298
DO YOU STILL THINK
THIS IS FUNNY?

249
00:12:59,527 --> 00:13:01,598
MOM, THIS WAS
A HALF-ASSED BID FOR ATTENTION.

250
00:13:01,903 --> 00:13:04,012
THIS WAS A CRY FOR HELP,
AND IF WE DON'T LISTEN,

251
00:13:04,293 --> 00:13:06,188
THE NEXT TIME SHE COULD DO
SOMETHING EVEN MORE DANGEROUS.

252
00:13:06,989 --> 00:13:09,116
YEAH, NEXT TIME SHE MIGHT
JUMP OFF THE PORCH.

253
00:13:09,475 --> 00:13:10,347
STOP IT!

254
00:13:10,683 --> 00:13:12,659
SUICIDE IS THE WORST THING
THAT CAN HAPPEN TO A FAMILY!

255
00:13:12,794 --> 00:13:14,771
I WILL NOT HAVE IT
MADE LIGHT OF! (exhales deeply)

256
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:24,305
ORSON'S RIGHT.

257
00:13:24,465 --> 00:13:26,425
WE NEED TO SUPPORT
EACH OTHER AS A FAMILY.

258
00:13:27,602 --> 00:13:28,225
IN FACT,

259
00:13:28,801 --> 00:13:31,433
I SAY WE ALL...
GO FOR COUNSELING.

260
00:13:39,294 --> 00:13:41,278
(Gabrielle) TOM ACTUALLY SAID
HE'S OPENING UP A PIZZA PARLOR?

261
00:13:41,703 --> 00:13:42,782
(Susan)
LYNETTE, YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS.

262
00:13:43,006 --> 00:13:46,023
MM-HMM.
WELL, MIGHT AS WELL
STAND IN A VAT OF TOMATO SAUCE

263
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:49,550
AND TEAR UP $100 BILLS.
I KNOW, BUT I SAID
THAT I WOULD SUPPORT HIM

264
00:13:49,693 --> 00:13:50,622
AND HELP HIM
FOLLOW HIS DREAM.

265
00:13:51,172 --> 00:13:53,704
WELL, HE CAN'T HOLD YOU TO THAT,
NOT IF THE DREAM IS PIZZA.

266
00:13:53,889 --> 00:13:55,461
SHE PROMISED
TO STAND BY HIM,

267
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,962
AND ONCE YOU MAKE
THAT COMMITMENT

268
00:13:57,057 --> 00:14:00,875
YOU HAVE TO SEE IT THROUGH.
YEAH...
HOW'S THAT DIVORCE GOING?

269
00:14:01,954 --> 00:14:05,059
I'M DONE TALKING.
HEY, PARKER,
BE CAREFUL UP THERE.

270
00:14:06,049 --> 00:14:06,986
I JUST KEEP THINKING

271
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:10,338
HE'S GONNA COME TO HIS SENSES
AND REALIZE IT'S A BAD IDEA.

272
00:14:10,825 --> 00:14:12,369
THAT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.
WHY?

273
00:14:12,656 --> 00:14:14,208
BECAUSE MEN
ARE GENETICALLY INCAPABLE

274
00:14:14,392 --> 00:14:16,713
OF REALIZING
THAT THEIR DREAMS ARE STUPID.

275
00:14:17,312 --> 00:14:18,816
CARE TO ELABORATE,
DR. McCLUSKEY?

276
00:14:19,216 --> 00:14:21,695
MY HUSBAND SOLD INSURANCE
FOR 36 YEARS,

277
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:23,301
AND ONE DAY,
HE WOKE UP AND DECIDED

278
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,245
HE WANTED TO MOVE TO PARIS
AND PAINT NAKED LADIES.

279
00:14:26,148 --> 00:14:28,290
I TOLD HIM, "GILBERT,
YOU CAN BARELY PAINT THE GARAGE.

280
00:14:28,971 --> 00:14:30,546
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
YOU CAN COMMIT ART?"

281
00:14:31,642 --> 00:14:33,362
AND FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE,
HE DESPISED ME.

282
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:36,041
HE DESPISED YOU
FOR SAYING "NO"?

283
00:14:37,136 --> 00:14:39,249
WELL, HE ALSO THOUGHT
I WAS SLEEPING WITH HIS BROTHER,

284
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,256
AND I'M SURE
THAT WAS MIXED IN THERE, TOO.

285
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:48,672
OKAY, SO I GOT KAYLA
ALL UNPACKED.

286
00:14:49,207 --> 00:14:52,367
OH, GREAT. SO, UH, TOM WILL DROP
HER OFF AT YOUR HOUSE ON FRIDAY.

287
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:54,646
SOUNDS GOOD. LYNETTE,
CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND?

288
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,886
MM-HMM. YEAH.

289
00:15:03,797 --> 00:15:05,549
OKAY, PARDON ME FOR HAVING
REALLY BIG EARS,

290
00:15:05,692 --> 00:15:07,931
BUT I HEARD ABOUT
TOM AND THIS PIZZA PLACE.

291
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,876
DO YOU WANNA KNOW
WHAT I THINK?
NO, NOT REALLY.

292
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,676
IT SUCKS.
IT'S A SUCKY IDEA,

293
00:15:14,467 --> 00:15:15,468
AND YOUR FRIENDS
BACK THERE--

294
00:15:15,641 --> 00:15:17,864
THEY'RE JUST TOO NICE
TO COME RIGHT OUT AND SAY IT.

295
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,687
LUCKILY, I'M NOT YOUR FRIEND,
SO YOU CAN TRUST ME.

296
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:23,863
NIP IT...

297
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,430
IN... THE BUD.

298
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:30,293
AND MAKE TOM RESENT ME
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE.

299
00:15:30,443 --> 00:15:31,064
I DON'T THINK SO.

300
00:15:31,349 --> 00:15:33,708
WELL, YOU BETTER DO SOMETHIN',
'CAUSE IF YOU DON'T,

301
00:15:34,812 --> 00:15:36,124
<i>YOU AND ME</i>

302
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:38,998
WILL WIND UP WORKING A POLE
TO PAY FOR BRACES.

303
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,281
HEY, JULIE.
I BOUGHT YOU SOME FLOWERS.

304
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,433
<i>GENERALLY,
WHEN YOU BUY FLERS,</i>

305
00:15:53,545 --> 00:15:54,706
THEY DON'T STILL HAVE
THE ROOTS ON THEM.

306
00:15:55,585 --> 00:15:57,201
OKAY, UH, I WAS HOPING
YOU COULD HELP ME

307
00:15:57,299 --> 00:15:58,201
WITH MY ENGLISH LIT PAPER.

308
00:15:58,705 --> 00:16:01,104
HI, I'M SARAH.
HEY.

309
00:16:01,913 --> 00:16:05,079
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?
ACTUALLY,
M SORT OF BUSY RIGHT NOW.

310
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,343
OH, COME ON.

311
00:16:06,976 --> 00:16:08,791
LOOK, AUNT EDIE'S GONNA
GIVE ME THE BOOT IF I FLUNK OUT.

312
00:16:09,831 --> 00:16:11,799
WOULDN'T YOU MISS ME?
OH, ABSOLUTELY!

313
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,118
WHOSE MOTORCYCLE WOULD WAKE US
ALL UP AT 2:00 IN THE MORNING?

314
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:15,958
YOU DRIVE A MOTORCYCLE?
HMM.

315
00:16:18,733 --> 00:16:19,581
(sighs) PLEASE?

316
00:16:20,037 --> 00:16:21,182
LOOK, I COULD REALLY
USE SOME HELP HERE.

317
00:16:24,548 --> 00:16:26,401
NORMALLY, I CHARGE
12 BUCKS AN HOUR FOR TUTORING,

318
00:16:26,497 --> 00:16:27,882
BUT SEEING AS IT'S YOU...

319
00:16:28,417 --> 00:16:28,962
$15.

320
00:16:30,246 --> 00:16:31,711
GREAT. SEE YOU FRIDAY.

321
00:16:34,712 --> 00:16:36,126
OH, AND JUST SO YOU KNOW,

322
00:16:37,031 --> 00:16:38,269
I CHARGE $15 AN HOUR
TO MAKE OUT,

323
00:16:38,487 --> 00:16:40,123
SO I'LL PROBABLY BREAK EVEN.

324
00:16:44,673 --> 00:16:45,186
UGH.

325
00:16:54,184 --> 00:16:55,977
HI. YOU'RE NEW.
WHERE'S MARCY?

326
00:16:56,633 --> 00:16:59,567
SHE'S IN HONOLULU ON VACATION.
CAN I HELP YOU?

327
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:01,535
OH, I'M JUST
GOING TO SEE MIKE DELFINO.

328
00:17:02,127 --> 00:17:04,368
WHAT'S THAT SMELL?
UH, THAT'S
MY MACONI AND CHEESE.

329
00:17:04,734 --> 00:17:06,367
I-I WAS HOPING IT WOULD
TRIGGER MIKE'S MEMORY.

330
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:10,332
I MADE IT THE FIRST TIME
WE MET TWO YEARS AGO.
YOU SHOULD'VE REFRIGERATED IT.

331
00:17:13,941 --> 00:17:14,549
EDIE?

332
00:17:15,757 --> 00:17:17,540
OH, YOU KNOW MS. BRITT?

333
00:17:17,893 --> 00:17:19,939
UH, YEAH.
WHAT IS SHE DOING HERE?

334
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,587
VISITING MR. DELFINO.

335
00:17:23,283 --> 00:17:25,275
YOU KNOW, SHE WAS WITH HIM
WHEN HE CAME OUT OF HIS COMA.

336
00:17:26,299 --> 00:17:28,338
AND SHE'S BEEN HERE
EVERY DAY SINCE.

337
00:17:30,579 --> 00:17:31,260
YOU!

338
00:17:34,202 --> 00:17:36,562
HELLO, SUSAN.
LONG TIME NO SEE.

339
00:17:37,025 --> 00:17:38,856
I'VE BEEN WONDERING WHY
MIKE'S BEEN SO COLD TO ME.

340
00:17:39,001 --> 00:17:42,349
NOW IT ALL MAKES SENSE.
I'M SURE I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

341
00:17:42,949 --> 00:17:44,555
WHEW! FOR GOD SAKES,
TAKE A BATH.

342
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:47,123
OH, THAT'S MY MAC AND CHEESE.
DON'T CHANGE THE SUBJECT.

343
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:50,201
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN
TELLING HIM ABOUT ME?
WHY WOULD I SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT YOU?

344
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:52,665
MIKE HAS NO IDEA
WHO YOU ARE.

345
00:17:53,784 --> 00:17:54,664
I ENVY HIM.

346
00:17:55,113 --> 00:17:56,473
LADIES,
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

347
00:17:56,872 --> 00:17:58,999
I WANT THIS WOMAN
BANNED FROM THE HOSPITAL.

348
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,888
SHE'S BEEN LIKE THIS
EVER SINCE MIKE DUMPED HER.

349
00:18:02,431 --> 00:18:05,898
IMAGINE "FATAL ATTRACTION"...
WITH A MUCH OLDER WOMAN.

350
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:09,836
MA'AM, MR. DELFINO
ALREADY HAS A VISITOR.

351
00:18:10,127 --> 00:18:11,054
I THINK YOU SHOULD GO.

352
00:18:11,405 --> 00:18:13,390
ME? BUT WHY
DOESN'T SHE LEAVE?

353
00:18:13,565 --> 00:18:14,262
I-I'M THE ONE

354
00:18:14,422 --> 00:18:16,045
WHO'S BEEN HERE EVERY DAY
FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS.

355
00:18:16,206 --> 00:18:19,301
WELL, I DON'T KNOW YOU,
BUT I DO KNOW HIS GIRLFRIEND.

356
00:18:21,797 --> 00:18:23,716
GIRLFRIEND?!
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

357
00:18:23,867 --> 00:18:25,091
I WANT MARCY'S NUMBER
IN HONOLULU,

358
00:18:25,211 --> 00:18:26,380
AND I WANT IT RIGHT NOW.

359
00:18:26,925 --> 00:18:28,084
YOU NEED TO LEAVE.
WHAT?!

360
00:18:28,219 --> 00:18:31,499
YOU'RE DISTURBING
THE OTHER PATIENTS.
NO, WHAT ARE YOU--
OH, THIS IS RIDICULOUS!

361
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,874
I MEAN,
WHO AM I DISTURBING?

362
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:35,283
IT'S A COMA WARD!
DON'T YOU WANT THEMTO WAKE UP?!

363
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,276
- i didn't call you that
- YES, YOU DID!

364
00:18:39,784 --> 00:18:42,665
I HAVE NEVER IN MY LIFE
USED THE WORD "RETARD."
IT'S WHAT YOU THINK.

365
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,112
YOU THINK I'M TH IMMATURE
MORON WHO CAN'T BE TRUSTED

366
00:18:45,184 --> 00:18:48,535
TO DECIDE WHAT'S BEST FOR HER.
WELL, YOU DID
TRY TO OFF YOURSELF.

367
00:18:48,651 --> 00:18:49,943
I DON'T THINK
YOU GET TO PULL

368
00:18:50,063 --> 00:18:51,767
THE "I KNOW
WHAT'S BEST FOR ME" CARD.
ANDREW!

369
00:18:51,918 --> 00:18:53,102
(lowered voice)
NOT IN FRONT OF THE THERAPIST.

370
00:18:53,447 --> 00:18:55,591
ACTUALLY, I THINK
WE'RE MAKING GREAT PROGRESS.

371
00:18:55,962 --> 00:18:57,703
YOU FEEL
DANIELLE REFUSES TO SEE

372
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,988
YOU'RE ACTING
IN HER BEST INTEREST.

373
00:19:00,965 --> 00:19:03,468
AND YOU THINK YOUR MOTHER
CARES MORE ABOUT HER IMAGE

374
00:19:04,412 --> 00:19:06,436
THAN YOUR FEELINGS.
DANIELLE, HOW CAN YOU THINK

375
00:19:06,636 --> 00:19:07,973
I DON'T CARE
ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS?

376
00:19:08,426 --> 00:19:10,395
DON'T YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
YOUR MOTHER LOVES YOU?

377
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,387
WHEN I SAW YOU IN THAT TUB,

378
00:19:12,595 --> 00:19:13,929
IT WAS THE WORST MOMENT
OF MY LIFE.

379
00:19:14,722 --> 00:19:16,410
THE THOUGHT OF LOSING YOU
IS MORE THAN I CAN BEAR.

380
00:19:17,849 --> 00:19:18,865
HOW DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL?

381
00:19:22,969 --> 00:19:23,649
ACTUALLY...

382
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,472
KIND OF POWERFUL.

383
00:19:29,343 --> 00:19:30,360
POWERFUL?

384
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:34,118
<i>YOU REALLY
DON'T WANNA LOSE ME?
OF COURSE NOT.</i>

385
00:19:34,623 --> 00:19:36,519
I ALREADY WENT THROUGH
THINKING I'D LOST ANDREW.

386
00:19:36,655 --> 00:19:37,607
I CAN'T
GO THROUGH THAT AGAIN.

387
00:19:38,229 --> 00:19:40,141
WELL, THEN, HERE'S
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN--

388
00:19:41,894 --> 00:19:43,374
I'M GOING
TO START DATING ROBERT AGAIN,

389
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:46,317
AND IF YOU TRY TO BREAK US UP
OR GET HIM FIRED,

390
00:19:46,772 --> 00:19:47,732
THEN I'M GOING TO LEAVE,

391
00:19:47,901 --> 00:19:50,501
<i>AND YOU WILL NEVER
SEE ME AGAIN.
DAELLE.</i>

392
00:19:50,885 --> 00:19:52,708
IF THAT CAN SURVIVE
ON ITS OWN, SO CAN I.

393
00:19:53,172 --> 00:19:54,132
YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME?

394
00:19:55,059 --> 00:19:56,820
CALL MY BLUFF.
SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

395
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,018
SO...

396
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:06,739
<i>WHAT DO WE OWE YOU
FOR ALL THIS PROGRESS?</i>

397
00:20:12,681 --> 00:20:13,753
COME ON, AUSTIN.
CONCENTRATE.

398
00:20:14,425 --> 00:20:16,441
OKAY, WHY DID
IAGO BETRAY OTHELLO?

399
00:20:16,689 --> 00:20:17,409
(sighs) UH...

400
00:20:19,175 --> 00:20:21,344
BECAUSE THE PLAY WOULD SUCK
IF HE DIDN'T?

401
00:20:22,871 --> 00:20:23,768
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

402
00:20:24,784 --> 00:20:25,511
MMM.

403
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:26,696
SORRY.

404
00:20:27,544 --> 00:20:29,454
NO! NO, NO, NO, NO!
NO, NO, WE'RE HERE TO WORK.

405
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,278
AND IF MY MOM CAME HOME,
SHE'D FLIP.

406
00:20:31,421 --> 00:20:32,301
NOW PUT THAT AWAY.

407
00:20:35,406 --> 00:20:36,180
AHH.

408
00:20:37,285 --> 00:20:38,198
YOU SAID, "PUT IT AWAY."

409
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:40,496
LOOK, IF--IF YOU THINK

410
00:20:40,635 --> 00:20:42,763
I'M GONNA SIT HERE
AND WRITE YOUR PAPER FOR YOU

411
00:20:42,892 --> 00:20:45,650
WHILE YOU'RE GETTING DRUNK--
NO, JU HELP ME
GET IT STARTED, OKAY?

412
00:20:45,706 --> 00:20:46,955
THIS IS HARD FOR ME,
ALL RIGHT?

413
00:20:47,049 --> 00:20:48,425
I DIDN'T READ A LOT
OF SHAKESPEARE IN JUVIE.

414
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:50,369
I KIND OF MAJORED
IN NOT GETTING STABBED.

415
00:20:53,178 --> 00:20:54,112
UGH, FINE.

416
00:20:54,664 --> 00:20:56,655
I'LL WRITE YOUR INTRO, BUT--
BUT THEN YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

417
00:20:56,817 --> 00:20:57,604
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
(sighs)

418
00:21:01,076 --> 00:21:04,127
SO... WHY DID THEY SEND YOU
TO JUVIE ANYWAY?

419
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:07,104
"THEY" DIDN'T. MY MOM DID.

420
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:10,022
WHY?

421
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:13,221
SHE HAD THIS BOYFRIEND--

422
00:21:13,455 --> 00:21:16,364
<i>NO JOB, BIG DRUNK,
REAL CATCH.</i>

423
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,692
ONE NIGHT,
HE POPS HER ONE,

424
00:21:18,796 --> 00:21:20,309
SO I BREAK A CHAIR
OVER HIS HEAD, AND, UH...

425
00:21:20,804 --> 00:21:22,301
<i>AND SHE CALLS THE COPS...
ON ME.</i>

426
00:21:24,613 --> 00:21:25,587
BUT YOU WERE
PROTECTING HER.

427
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:28,624
YEAH,
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

428
00:21:30,199 --> 00:21:31,943
BUT THE GUY SAID HE'D LEAVE
IF SHE DIDN'T PRESS CHARGES,

429
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:36,031
AND... WELL, MY MOM
DOESN'T REALLY LIKE TO BE ALONE.

430
00:21:40,172 --> 00:21:42,653
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE TIRED.

431
00:21:42,757 --> 00:21:45,245
UM, WHY DON'T YOU LAY DOWN
FOR A COUPLE MINUTES,

432
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:47,204
AND I'LLUST
DO A PAGE OR TWO?

433
00:21:49,539 --> 00:21:50,506
YOU'RE A ROCK STAR, MAYER.

434
00:22:02,049 --> 00:22:02,890
CARLOS...

435
00:22:03,618 --> 00:22:04,666
NO TRISHELLE TONIGHT?

436
00:22:05,577 --> 00:22:06,252
AH, NO.

437
00:22:07,089 --> 00:22:08,609
ABOUT HER--
I HAVE A CONFESSION TO MAKE.

438
00:22:08,873 --> 00:22:10,577
DOES HER PIMP WANT
THE REST OF THE MONEY?

439
00:22:10,713 --> 00:22:12,584
YOU KNOW, THERE IS
SOME CASH IN MY PURSE.

440
00:22:12,905 --> 00:22:15,118
LOOK, I KNOW I CROSSED A LINE
BRINGING HER HERE, ALL RIGHT?

441
00:22:15,771 --> 00:22:16,912
BUT I WAS TRYING
TO MAKE YOU JEALOUS,

442
00:22:17,672 --> 00:22:19,056
LIKE THE WAY
YOU MADE ME FEEL

443
00:22:19,303 --> 00:22:21,439
WHEN YOU SAID YOU SLEPT
WITH JOHN ROWLAND AGAIN.

444
00:22:22,094 --> 00:22:23,374
WELL, I THINK
IT'S MORE THAN THAT.

445
00:22:23,648 --> 00:22:25,205
<i>I THINK YOU REALLY HATE ME.</i>

446
00:22:26,213 --> 00:22:28,164
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
OH, I THINK IT IS.

447
00:22:28,366 --> 00:22:29,621
YOU KNOW,
INTRODUCING YOUR SPOUSE

448
00:22:29,789 --> 00:22:31,310
TO SOMEONE
YOU'RE ABOUT TO HAVE SEX WITH?

449
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:33,421
THERE'S ONLY ONE REASON
TO DO THAT--

450
00:22:34,965 --> 00:22:36,551
PURE HATRED.

451
00:22:37,036 --> 00:22:38,372
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

452
00:22:47,277 --> 00:22:48,214
OH, I THINK I DO.

453
00:22:52,252 --> 00:22:54,402
PHIL, COME MEET
MY BASICALLY EX-HUSBAND--

454
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:55,555
THANK YOU--CARLOS.

455
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,210
CARLOS, THIS IS
MY NEW FRIEND PHIL LOPEZ.

456
00:22:58,637 --> 00:22:59,423
WE'VE MET, GABY.

457
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:02,772
REALLY?
WELL, THAT'S WEIRD. WHEN?

458
00:23:03,748 --> 00:23:05,620
FAIRVIEW CHAMBER OF COMMERCE--
THE ANNUAL DINNER.

459
00:23:06,331 --> 00:23:07,947
OH, MY GOD! THAT'S RIGHT!
THAT'S RIGHT! (laughs)

460
00:23:08,715 --> 00:23:10,051
YOU WERE UP

461
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,075
FOR THE LATINO BUSINESSMAN
OF THE YEAR AWARD

462
00:23:12,185 --> 00:23:12,995
THAT PHIL WON.

463
00:23:13,818 --> 00:23:15,794
WELL, ACTUALLY,
I BEAT HIM OUT TWICE.

464
00:23:15,986 --> 00:23:16,489
NO!

465
00:23:17,723 --> 00:23:20,060
<i>OOH, I REMEMBER.
CARLOS WAS SO ANNOYED.</i>

466
00:23:20,587 --> 00:23:21,449
WHAT DID YOU SAY, HON?

467
00:23:22,121 --> 00:23:25,098
"HE MAY HAVE THAT TROPHY,
BUT I'VE GOT YOU."

468
00:23:27,217 --> 00:23:28,160
AIN'T LIFE FUNNY? (laughs)

469
00:23:29,553 --> 00:23:30,871
GABY,
CAN WE TALK FOR A SEC?

470
00:23:31,384 --> 00:23:32,583
MNH-MNH, NOT RIGHT NOW.

471
00:23:32,735 --> 00:23:33,871
PHIL AND I ARE
GETTING IN THE HOT TUB.

472
00:23:34,072 --> 00:23:36,852
OOH, PHIL,
DID YOU BRING YOUR SUIT?
YOU SAID I DIDN'T HAVE TO.

473
00:23:37,878 --> 00:23:40,411
<i>NOT IN FRONT OF ARLOS-CAY!</i>

474
00:23:41,094 --> 00:23:42,310
GO OUTSIDE.
I'LL MEET YOU THERE.

475
00:23:46,644 --> 00:23:47,563
PHIL LOPEZ?

476
00:23:48,501 --> 00:23:49,837
YOU BROUGHT HOME
PHIL LOPEZ?!

477
00:23:50,938 --> 00:23:52,531
I HAD NO IDEA
YOU HATED ME THAT MUCH!

478
00:23:53,482 --> 00:23:54,162
WELL, NOW YOU KNOW.

479
00:23:58,211 --> 00:23:59,026
AAH!

480
00:24:02,882 --> 00:24:03,889
HEY, GOOD NEWS.

481
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:06,473
MY REALTOR FOUND ME
SOME SWEET LOCATIONS.

482
00:24:07,232 --> 00:24:08,482
THAT'S... GREAT.
(chuckles)

483
00:24:09,543 --> 00:24:12,992
HEY, CAN WE TALK ABOUT THIS
RESTAURANT THING FOR A SECOND?

484
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,151
YEAH. WHAT'S UP?

485
00:24:14,814 --> 00:24:16,224
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU NOTICED,

486
00:24:16,527 --> 00:24:18,968
BUT WHEN YOU FIRST PITCHED
THE WHOLE PIZZA CONCEPT...

487
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:21,014
(chuckles)
I WAS A WEE BIT SKEPTICAL.

488
00:24:21,351 --> 00:24:22,302
YEAH, I SENSED THAT.

489
00:24:22,981 --> 00:24:24,376
OF COURSE YOU DID,
'CAUSE YOU'RE A SMART GUY,

490
00:24:24,552 --> 00:24:28,182
WHICH IS ALSO WHY YOU ARE GONNA
JUMP ON THE IDEA I HAVE

491
00:24:29,358 --> 00:24:30,726
TO MAKE
THE WHOLE THING WORK.

492
00:24:31,518 --> 00:24:32,797
OKAY, SO YOU'RE NOT
BAILING ON ME?

493
00:24:33,093 --> 00:24:36,622
NO. NO, NO, NO,
I AM TOTALLY ON BOARD.

494
00:24:36,781 --> 00:24:39,508
(laughs) OH, GOOD! YOU HAD ME
SCARED THERE FOR A SECOND.

495
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:42,492
OKAY, SO, WELL,
WHAT IS THIS GREAT IDEA?

496
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:43,860
I'M THINKING...

497
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:46,114
CATERING COMPANY.

498
00:24:47,436 --> 00:24:48,027
HUH?

499
00:24:48,515 --> 00:24:50,947
START SMALL,
HAVE AN ITALIAN THEME,

500
00:24:51,249 --> 00:24:54,363
CREATE SOME CASH FLOW,
AND THEN LATER ON,

501
00:24:54,818 --> 00:24:56,849
EXPAND INTO THE PIZZA THING.

502
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:59,136
BUT THAT'S NOT MDREAM.

503
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:00,650
WELL, THINK ABOUT IT.

504
00:25:00,977 --> 00:25:03,648
YOU'RE GONNA DO
ALL THESE FUN PARTIES.

505
00:25:03,808 --> 00:25:06,575
PEOPLE WILL START TALKING--
"HEY, THIS IS GREAT FOOD.

506
00:25:06,711 --> 00:25:08,409
THIS GUY SHOULD
OPEN A RESTAURANT."

507
00:25:08,776 --> 00:25:10,463
"YEAH, YEAH, I'D EAT THERE,"
AND THEN WHAM!

508
00:25:10,664 --> 00:25:12,727
FIVE SHORT YEARS LATER,

509
00:25:13,207 --> 00:25:15,205
YOU HAVE
A BUILT-IN CUSTOMER BASE.

510
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:17,918
BUT I SAID IT'S NOT MY DREAM.
PIZZA IS MY DREAM.

511
00:25:18,088 --> 00:25:20,641
KNOW, I KNOW.
CATERING'S HOW YOU GET THERE.
SO WHY CAN'T I JUST
SKIP THE CATERING,

512
00:25:20,753 --> 00:25:22,809
AND GO STRAIGHT
TO THE PIZZA?
BECAUSE YOU'LL FAIL!

513
00:25:25,034 --> 00:25:28,368
I'M SORRY! GOD. (groans)
I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT.

514
00:25:28,824 --> 00:25:30,968
BUT YOU'RE GAMBLING
WITH OUR LIFE SAVINGS,

515
00:25:31,391 --> 00:25:33,239
AND YOU HAVE NO EXPERIENCE.

516
00:25:33,959 --> 00:25:35,112
YOU SAID
THAT YOU'D SUPPORT ME.

517
00:25:39,263 --> 00:25:41,515
I'M TRYING TO.
I AM TRYING TO.

518
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,337
BUT ARE YOU AWARE

519
00:25:42,418 --> 00:25:45,471
THAT 90% OF RESTAURANTS
TANK IN THEIR FIRST YEAR?

520
00:25:45,584 --> 00:25:47,360
WHICH MEANS THAT
10% OF THEM MAKE IT!

521
00:25:47,473 --> 00:25:49,039
WHY DON'T YOU EVER THINK
THAT I WOULD BE ONE OF THEM?

522
00:25:49,744 --> 00:25:51,943
NO! NO, DO ME A FAVOR.

523
00:25:54,704 --> 00:25:55,550
DON'T ANSWER THAT.

524
00:26:05,222 --> 00:26:06,807
YOO-HOO! CARLOS!

525
00:26:08,158 --> 00:26:09,430
I'M MAKING A SNACK
FOR PHIL.

526
00:26:11,413 --> 00:26:12,885
DO YOU WANT
SOMETHING TO EAT?

527
00:26:13,645 --> 00:26:16,173
SOME SOUR GRAPES, PERHAPS?

528
00:26:16,293 --> 00:26:17,389
MAYBE A LITTLE CROW?

529
00:26:27,267 --> 00:26:28,227
OKAY, WE NEED
TO MOVE THIS OVER THERE.

530
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:29,043
WHY?

531
00:26:30,236 --> 00:26:31,610
UH, FENG SHUI.

532
00:26:43,172 --> 00:26:44,610
(banging)
(Gabrielle) YES! YES!

533
00:26:45,283 --> 00:26:47,233
(laughs)
HEY, DON'T START WITHOUT ME.

534
00:26:48,485 --> 00:26:50,186
(lowered voice) OH, NO, NO,
LET'S GET SOMETHING STRAIGHT--

535
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:52,065
YOU AND I ARE NOT GONNA
HAVE SEX TONIGHT.

536
00:26:53,209 --> 00:26:53,881
WHAT?

537
00:26:54,911 --> 00:26:56,382
I'M SORRY.
NO OFFENSE, YOU'RE A NICE GUY.

538
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,896
I'M JUST
NOT INTO YOU THAT WAY.

539
00:26:58,536 --> 00:27:00,125
OH, GOD, PHIL!

540
00:27:00,294 --> 00:27:02,598
YES, YES, GIVE IT TO ME!

541
00:27:02,878 --> 00:27:03,805
OKAY. OH, OKAY.

542
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,228
NO, NO, I'M NOT
TALKING TO YOU. BACK OFF!

543
00:27:06,573 --> 00:27:07,588
WHAT--BUT I THOUGHT--
I MEAN...

544
00:27:07,722 --> 00:27:11,036
YOU KNOW, THE HOT TUB...
WE WERE...
YES, YOU SAW MY BOOBS,

545
00:27:11,381 --> 00:27:13,109
AND YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE THAT MENTAL SNAPSHOT

546
00:27:13,218 --> 00:27:14,270
TO USE AS YOU WISH
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE...

547
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:17,181
<i>BUT THAT IS
ALL YOU'RE GETTING!</i>

548
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:20,556
WAIT, WAIT,
SO YOU'RE JUST USING ME?

549
00:27:22,483 --> 00:27:23,093
YOU'RE UNBELIEVABLE.

550
00:27:23,301 --> 00:27:23,932
I'M WHAT?!

551
00:27:24,427 --> 00:27:25,555
(Phil)
YOU ARE UNBELIEVABLE!

552
00:27:25,745 --> 00:27:28,770
REALLY?
OH, SO ARE YOU, BIG BOY!

553
00:27:29,794 --> 00:27:30,616
YES!

554
00:27:37,217 --> 00:27:39,280
NO WONDER YOU'RE DIVORCING HER.
SHE'S A STRAIGHT-UP LOON.

555
00:27:40,613 --> 00:27:41,784
OH, CRAP.
SHE'S BLOCKING MY CAR!

556
00:27:44,336 --> 00:27:45,975
ALWAYS HAPPY
TO HELP A BROTHER OUT.

557
00:27:46,975 --> 00:27:47,831
HOLD ON.

558
00:27:50,926 --> 00:27:52,574
(Gabrielle) OH, GOD, YES!

559
00:27:53,126 --> 00:27:55,310
OH, RIDE 'EM, COWBOY!

560
00:27:56,197 --> 00:27:57,893
OH, YES, GOD!

561
00:27:58,998 --> 00:28:00,780
TAKE ME HOME, PHILLY!

562
00:28:01,292 --> 00:28:02,789
YOU SHOULD WEAR A SADDLE!

563
00:28:02,965 --> 00:28:04,101
YES! YES!

564
00:28:04,973 --> 00:28:07,028
STOP IT, PHIL.
I TOLD YOU TO BEAT IT.

565
00:28:07,139 --> 00:28:07,893
NO MEANS NO!

566
00:28:10,995 --> 00:28:11,964
I NEED YOUR CAR KEYS.

567
00:28:12,794 --> 00:28:14,275
YOU'RE BLOCKING
THE STALLION'S HATCHBACK.

568
00:28:22,356 --> 00:28:25,537
"OH, YES, YES, PHIL!

569
00:28:25,913 --> 00:28:27,262
FILL ME WITH PHIL!"

570
00:28:27,949 --> 00:28:31,044
I NEVER SAID THAT.
(chuckles)
AND YOU MOVED THE BED.

571
00:28:31,429 --> 00:28:32,226
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

572
00:28:32,771 --> 00:28:34,579
SHUT UP.
YOU KNOW, IF YOU WERE
TRYING TO HURT ME,

573
00:28:34,692 --> 00:28:37,178
THAT'S NOT THE WAY TO DO IT.
WELL, THEN ENLIGHTEN ME.

574
00:28:38,051 --> 00:28:40,371
<i>HOW CAN I HIT YOU SO HARD
THAT YOU WILL NEVER RECOVER?</i>

575
00:28:43,066 --> 00:28:44,265
YOU CAN'T.

576
00:28:44,587 --> 00:28:47,073
OH, I HAVE TO, CARLOS.
I NEED YOU TO GIVE UP ON US.

577
00:28:47,593 --> 00:28:50,041
WE'RE NOT GOOD FOR EACH OTHER,
AND I CAN'T KEEP DOING THIS.

578
00:28:51,937 --> 00:28:52,639
BUT I CAN.

579
00:28:53,639 --> 00:28:55,069
YOU PROVED SOMETHING
TONIGHT--

580
00:28:56,064 --> 00:28:58,029
YOU HAD A RICH,
GOOD-LOOKING GUY IN YOUR BED,

581
00:28:58,124 --> 00:28:59,162
AND YOU COULDN'T
PULL THE TRIGGER.

582
00:29:00,714 --> 00:29:03,426
THAT MEANS YOU STILL CARE,
AND AS LONG AS I KNOW THAT,

583
00:29:03,583 --> 00:29:06,185
I CAN TAKE ANYTHING
THAT YOU CAN DISH OUT.

584
00:29:10,352 --> 00:29:11,250
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M TIRED.

585
00:29:12,057 --> 00:29:13,265
CAN WE TALK ABOUT THIS
IN THE MORNING?

586
00:29:15,321 --> 00:29:15,897
SURE.

587
00:29:16,401 --> 00:29:18,136
BUT YOU'RE BRINGING ME
BREAKFAST IN BED OR NO DEAL.

588
00:29:21,487 --> 00:29:22,070
IT'S A DATE.

589
00:29:39,828 --> 00:29:40,453
SARAH?

590
00:29:41,093 --> 00:29:42,052
WHAT ARE YOU--OH!

591
00:29:43,764 --> 00:29:45,379
OH, JULIE!
THANK GOD IT'S YOU.

592
00:29:45,516 --> 00:29:46,579
WE TOTALLY THOUGHT
YOU WERE THE COPS.

593
00:29:47,667 --> 00:29:48,602
(grunts) OH, HEY, JULIE.

594
00:29:48,963 --> 00:29:50,307
WHAT ARE YOU,
ON BUZZ KILL PATROL TONIGHT?

595
00:29:51,835 --> 00:29:53,475
<i>THIS IS WHY YOU COULDN'T
GO TO THE MOVIES WITH ME?</i>

596
00:29:54,289 --> 00:29:56,241
WELL, SORRY, I THOUGHT
YOU WEREN'T THAT INTO HIM.

597
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:57,977
BUT, YOU KNOW, IF YOU ARE--
I'M NOT!

598
00:29:58,267 --> 00:30:00,114
I'M JUST--
I'M MAD THAT YOU BLEW ME OFF.

599
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:01,986
WELL,
I WOULD TOTALLY UNDERSTAND

600
00:30:02,129 --> 00:30:03,720
IF YOU WANTED
TO BLOW ME OFF FOR A DATE.

601
00:30:05,249 --> 00:30:07,376
(scoffs) YOU CALL THIS A DATE--
GETTING MAULED IN A CAR?

602
00:30:07,895 --> 00:30:09,160
HEY, YOU WANNA
TALK ABOUT THIS LATER?

603
00:30:09,488 --> 00:30:10,864
I'M LOSING ALTITUDE HERE.

604
00:30:12,423 --> 00:30:13,974
<i>UGH, YOU ARE DISGUSTING!</i>

605
00:30:14,446 --> 00:30:15,814
<i>ENJOY THE REST OF YOUR DATE.</i>

606
00:30:20,462 --> 00:30:21,334
JULIE, THERE YOU ARE.

607
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:23,606
I THINK I FOUND A WAY
TO GET THROUGH TO MIKE.

608
00:30:24,381 --> 00:30:25,750
LET IT GO!
HE'S NOT INTO YOU!

609
00:30:31,515 --> 00:30:33,476
GABY, RISE AND SHINE.

610
00:30:34,108 --> 00:30:35,380
I MADE YOU SOME WAFFLES.

611
00:30:41,083 --> 00:30:43,518
I GOT A SECOND WIND LAST NIGHT,
SO I WENT TO A BAR.

612
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,932
THAT'S WHERE I MET JASON.

613
00:30:45,547 --> 00:30:48,081
WE SPENT THE WHOLE NIGHT--
HOW DID YOU PUT IT?

614
00:30:48,961 --> 00:30:49,841
PULLING THE TRIGGER.

615
00:30:55,536 --> 00:30:57,392
SO DID I HURT YOU,
OR SHOULD I KEEP TRYING?

616
00:31:06,877 --> 00:31:09,924
YOU KICKED ASS
IN REHAB TODAY.

617
00:31:10,567 --> 00:31:12,253
YEAH, I RAISED MY ARM
OVER MY HEAD.

618
00:31:12,717 --> 00:31:14,013
SIGN ME UP
FOR THE OLYMPICS.

619
00:31:14,197 --> 00:31:16,356
OH, BE PATIENT.
IT TAKES TIME.

620
00:31:17,189 --> 00:31:18,312
MS. BRITT?
HMM?

621
00:31:18,471 --> 00:31:19,940
PHONE CALL FOR YOU
AT THE NURSES' STATION.

622
00:31:20,229 --> 00:31:21,343
FOR ME? HUH.

623
00:31:23,132 --> 00:31:23,917
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

624
00:31:30,596 --> 00:31:31,483
THERE'S A PHONE CALL
FOR ME?

625
00:31:33,348 --> 00:31:34,907
SUSAN? WHAT ARE YOU--

626
00:31:35,283 --> 00:31:37,067
SHH! I THOUGHT YOU COULD USE
SOME FRESH AIR.

627
00:31:37,227 --> 00:31:38,074
HELLO?

628
00:31:39,059 --> 00:31:40,018
HELLO? IT'S EDIE.

629
00:31:44,033 --> 00:31:45,112
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?
WHO'S HE?

630
00:31:45,337 --> 00:31:47,665
OH, THIS IS HANK,
AND HE HAS VERY KINDLY OFFERED

631
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,138
TO TAKE US ON
A LITTLE FIELD TRIP TODAY...

632
00:31:49,753 --> 00:31:50,737
FOR 60 BUCKS AN HOUR.

633
00:31:51,742 --> 00:31:52,511
WHERE ARE YOU TAKING ME?

634
00:31:52,917 --> 00:31:55,092
UH, JUST A LITTLE JAUNT
DOWN MEMORY LANE.

635
00:31:56,276 --> 00:31:57,724
OH, GOD, YOU'RE NOT
TAKING ME TO THAT

636
00:31:57,876 --> 00:32:00,763
FISH AND DISCO PLACE,
ARE YOU?
(laughs) NO, NO.

637
00:32:00,908 --> 00:32:02,573
WHAT WE'RE DOING TODAY
IS A LITTLE MORE LOW-KEY.

638
00:32:02,692 --> 00:32:04,091
DON'T WORRY.
YOU'RE TOTALLY SAFE.

639
00:32:04,995 --> 00:32:05,978
WE'RE NOT
DOING ANYTHING WRONG.

640
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:10,640
PUNCH IT!

641
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,086
HELLO.
LOOK, MRS. HODGE,

642
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:21,678
UH, I'VE ONLY SEEN YOUR DAUGHTER
ONCE SINCE THE MOTEL.

643
00:32:22,118 --> 00:32:23,156
SHE TOLD ME
THAT YOU BACKED OFF.

644
00:32:23,516 --> 00:32:25,077
OH, MR. FALADI,
I'M NOT HERE TO THREATEN YOU.

645
00:32:25,717 --> 00:32:28,844
I'VE COME TO GIVE YOU
MY BLESSING.
YOUR BLESSING?

646
00:32:29,236 --> 00:32:30,443
YES, DANIELLE
MADE IT QUITE CLEAR

647
00:32:30,924 --> 00:32:32,715
THAT I'M POWERLESS
TO STOP THIS RELATIONSHIP,

648
00:32:32,836 --> 00:32:35,139
AND SINCE SHE ASSURES ME
THAT YOU LOVE HER--

649
00:32:35,699 --> 00:32:37,187
YOU DO LOVE HER,
DON'T YOU?

650
00:32:37,596 --> 00:32:39,043
UH, YES, OF COURSE.

651
00:32:39,435 --> 00:32:41,180
GOOD. THEN WE'RE ALL SET.

652
00:32:44,117 --> 00:32:45,187
HERE ARE SOME OF HER CLOTHES.

653
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:48,082
I'LL BRING HER CDs AND HER
STUFFED ANIMALS OVER TOMORROW.

654
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:52,442
YOU WANT HER TO STAY HERE?
THIS PLACE IS KIND OF SMALL.

655
00:32:53,018 --> 00:32:54,858
WELL, THAT HOTEL ROOM
WAS SMALL,

656
00:32:55,017 --> 00:32:56,697
AND YOU SEEMED
HAPPY ENOUGH TRE.

657
00:32:57,185 --> 00:32:58,577
OH, AND I TRUST YOU
TO BE DISCREET.

658
00:32:58,904 --> 00:33:00,880
YOU WOULDN'T WANT YOUR WIFE
FIND OUT ABOUT THIS

659
00:33:01,024 --> 00:33:02,400
AND USE IT AGAINST YOU
IN YOUR DIVORCE.

660
00:33:03,352 --> 00:33:05,473
WHOA, WHOA, MRS. HODGE?

661
00:33:06,912 --> 00:33:08,519
THINGS ARE GETTING
A LITTLE BIT COMPLICATED.

662
00:33:09,526 --> 00:33:10,968
COULD YOU
PLEASE TELL DANIELLE

663
00:33:11,144 --> 00:33:13,015
THAT THIS IS NOT GONNA
WORK OUT AND THAT WE--

664
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:15,351
MR. FALADI, IF YOU WANT TO
BREAK MY DAUGHTER'S HEART,

665
00:33:15,566 --> 00:33:17,863
I CAN'T STOP YOU,
BUT I WILL NOT BE AN ACCOMPLICE.

666
00:33:18,646 --> 00:33:19,453
YOU'LL TELL HER YOURSELF.

667
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,510
RIGHT.
AND DON'T EVEN
THINK ABOUT BLAMING ME,

668
00:33:23,629 --> 00:33:25,285
'CAUSE IF YOU SO MUCH
AS MENTION THAT WE SPOKE,

669
00:33:26,389 --> 00:33:27,116
I'LL PHONE THE POLICE.

670
00:33:29,045 --> 00:33:30,452
FINE, I WILL
LEAVE YOU OUT OF IT.

671
00:33:34,428 --> 00:33:36,584
OH, AND ONE MORE THING...
YES?

672
00:33:37,326 --> 00:33:39,334
DANIELLE IS APPLYING
TO COLLEGES.

673
00:33:39,933 --> 00:33:43,069
I DO HOPE SHE CAN COUNT ON YOU
FOR A GLOWING RECOMMENDATION.

674
00:33:44,686 --> 00:33:45,229
SURE.

675
00:33:50,354 --> 00:33:51,756
AND WHEN I LOCKEMYSELF
OUT OF THE HOUSE,

676
00:33:52,013 --> 00:33:54,739
THAT'S WHERE THE BUSH WAS
THAT YOU FOUND ME IN... NAKED.

677
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:56,115
SURELY YOU REMEMBER THAT.

678
00:33:57,123 --> 00:33:57,578
NOPE.

679
00:33:58,874 --> 00:33:59,675
OUCH, THAT HURTS.

680
00:34:00,203 --> 00:34:02,082
UM, OKAY,
REMEMBER THIS SPOT?

681
00:34:03,498 --> 00:34:04,944
THIS IS WHERE
WE SAT IN YOUR TRUCK

682
00:34:05,105 --> 00:34:06,058
AND HAD OUR FIRST KISS.

683
00:34:07,724 --> 00:34:09,476
WERE YOU NAKED THEN, TOO?

684
00:34:11,576 --> 00:34:13,381
(sighs) MIKE,
WHY ARE YOU BEING THIS WAY?

685
00:34:13,997 --> 00:34:15,374
BECAUSE THIS IS POINTLESS.

686
00:34:16,437 --> 00:34:17,165
I... I'M SORRY.

687
00:34:17,366 --> 00:34:19,932
I CAN'T--I DON'T REMEMBER
BEING WITH YOU.

688
00:34:20,509 --> 00:34:23,181
OKAY, I KNOW IT'S HARD,
BUT YOU GOTTA MAKE AN EFFORT,

689
00:34:23,293 --> 00:34:24,860
AND, YOU KNOW,
IF YOUR HEAD IS A LITTLE FOGGY,

690
00:34:24,971 --> 00:34:25,723
THEN DON'T LOOK THERE.

691
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:29,635
LOOK IN YOUR HEART,
BECAUSE I'M IN THERE,

692
00:34:30,723 --> 00:34:31,699
JUST LIKE
YOU'RE INSIDE MINE.

693
00:34:34,673 --> 00:34:38,306
OKAY, UM,
THIS IS MARY ACE'S HOUSE,

694
00:34:38,688 --> 00:34:40,561
AND THIS IS
WHERE WE FIRST MET.

695
00:34:40,754 --> 00:34:43,145
I WAS SETTING OUT
MY MACARONI AND CHEESE,

696
00:34:43,521 --> 00:34:45,096
AND YOU WE INVITED--
OH! OW! (grunts)

697
00:34:47,007 --> 00:34:47,417
I'M GOOD.

698
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:50,320
FINALLY, A SMILE.

699
00:34:50,703 --> 00:34:51,864
YOU DO THAT A LOT,
DON'T YOU?

700
00:34:52,015 --> 00:34:54,111
WELL, YEAH, I'VE BEEN KNOWN
TO TAKE A SPILL OR TWO,

701
00:34:54,297 --> 00:34:56,132
BUT, YOU KNOW, MY DOCTOR SAYS
IT'S AN INNER EAR...

702
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,400
WAIT, YOU REMEMBER THAT?

703
00:35:00,292 --> 00:35:01,563
YEAH, I THINK I... DO.

704
00:35:02,379 --> 00:35:04,491
YES! THAT'S PROGRESS! SEE?

705
00:35:04,714 --> 00:35:07,742
OH, IT'S ALL GONNA COME BACK.
WE'RE GONNA BE US AGAIN!

706
00:35:09,428 --> 00:35:11,654
BUT... WHAT ABOUT
THE BRITISH GUY?

707
00:35:16,421 --> 00:35:16,900
MIKE...

708
00:35:18,021 --> 00:35:19,378
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT EDIE'S BEENELLING YOU,

709
00:35:19,525 --> 00:35:21,318
BUT IAN AND I--
WE'RE JUST FRIENDS.

710
00:35:22,636 --> 00:35:23,429
JUST FRIENDS?

711
00:35:24,483 --> 00:35:25,020
YEAH...

712
00:35:26,283 --> 00:35:26,908
NOW.

713
00:35:31,939 --> 00:35:33,139
LOOK,
YOU GOTTA UNDERSTAND.

714
00:35:34,634 --> 00:35:35,731
THE DOCTORS WERE TELLING ME

715
00:35:36,081 --> 00:35:37,659
THAT YOU WOULD PROBABLY
NEVER WAKE UP,

716
00:35:38,994 --> 00:35:40,777
AND I JUST NEEDED
SOMEBODY TO TALK TO.

717
00:35:42,249 --> 00:35:45,445
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU WERE
DOING IN THE COUNTRY--TALKING?

718
00:35:50,475 --> 00:35:51,284
(nurse) MR. DELFINO?

719
00:35:51,788 --> 00:35:52,332
ARE YOU OKAY?

720
00:35:55,692 --> 00:35:56,242
I'M FINE.

721
00:35:56,643 --> 00:35:58,937
YOU CAN'T JUST DISCHARGE
A PATIENT WITHOUT PERMISSION!

722
00:35:59,106 --> 00:36:01,146
OH, BUT YOU--I WAS JUST
TRYING TO HELP HIM REMEMBER.

723
00:36:01,257 --> 00:36:03,521
TELL HER, MIKE. WE WERE--
WE WERE MAKING PROGRESS.

724
00:36:05,753 --> 00:36:07,001
TAKE ME BACK
TO THE HOSPITAL.

725
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:14,642
OH, UH...

726
00:36:14,743 --> 00:36:15,367
MIKE!

727
00:36:15,918 --> 00:36:18,054
WELL, AT THE RISK
OF STATING THE OBVIOUS,

728
00:36:18,726 --> 00:36:21,169
IT'S OVER. HE'S MINE NOW.

729
00:36:21,717 --> 00:36:24,165
NO, NO, NO, NO! NO, NO,
THIS--THIS IS NOT HOW THIS ENDS.

730
00:36:24,518 --> 00:36:26,750
NO, EVIL DOES NOT TRIUMPH
OVER GOOD.

731
00:36:26,933 --> 00:36:28,007
<i>THAT'S HOW YOU SEE ME?</i>

732
00:36:28,438 --> 00:36:30,855
DAMN STRAIGHT!
YOU LIE, YOU CHEAT, YOU SCHEME!

733
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:32,979
YOU RUIN
PEOPLE'S RELATIONSHIPS!

734
00:36:33,187 --> 00:36:34,932
I MEAN,
HOW DO YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT?

735
00:36:35,564 --> 00:36:37,628
<i>SOON WITH MIKE
ON TOP OF ME,</i>

736
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:39,890
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

737
00:36:40,544 --> 00:36:41,595
SEE? EVIL!

738
00:36:42,011 --> 00:36:42,779
EVIL!

739
00:36:43,122 --> 00:36:44,485
HAS IT EVER OCCURRED TO YOU

740
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:46,873
THAT MBE MIKE AND I ARE
MEANT TO END UP TOGETHER?

741
00:36:50,025 --> 00:36:50,365
NO!

742
00:36:50,933 --> 00:36:53,444
YOU--YOU--MIKE?
YOU DON'T EVEN WANT HIM!

743
00:36:53,555 --> 00:36:55,145
YOU'RE JUST DOING THIS
TO HURT ME.

744
00:36:56,616 --> 00:36:59,729
WOW. HOW SELF-ABSORBED
CAN YOU BE?

745
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:02,816
I HAVE HAD A THING FOR MIKE
SINCE THE DAY HE MOVED IN HERE,

746
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:04,063
AND I EVEN BACKED OFF

747
00:37:04,204 --> 00:37:05,863
WHEN HE FELL FOR YOUR
LITTLE MISS ADORABLE ACT.

748
00:37:06,342 --> 00:37:07,925
BUT HE'S OVER THAT.
IT'S MY TURN NOW,

749
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:11,590
AND I WILL BE BETTER FOR HIM
THAN YOU EVER WERE.

750
00:37:11,821 --> 00:37:12,612
AND IF YOU DO GET HURT,

751
00:37:12,838 --> 00:37:14,893
WELL... (chuckles)
THAT'S JUST GRAVY.

752
00:37:18,693 --> 00:37:22,077
<i>ALL RIGHT, MAYBE THAT
WAS A LITTLE EVIL.</i>

753
00:37:37,251 --> 00:37:38,032
FINALLY.

754
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:39,026
SORRY IT TOOK SO LONG.

755
00:37:39,585 --> 00:37:41,090
THAT LAST DIGIT
WAS BARELY LEGIBLE.

756
00:37:42,076 --> 00:37:43,340
I THOUGHT YOU'D LIKE
TO DO THE HONORS.

757
00:37:57,421 --> 00:37:58,942
<i>(Mike) You've reached
Mike Delfino Plumbing.</i>

758
00:37:59,357 --> 00:38:00,660
<i>Please leave a message
after the beep.</i>

759
00:38:01,508 --> 00:38:02,457
<i>(beep)</i>

760
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:17,061
WHOA, A D-MINUS.
THAT BLOWS.
YEAH, IT DOES,

761
00:38:17,749 --> 00:38:19,358
ESPECIALLY SINCE IT'S
NOT THE ONE WE DID TOGETHER.

762
00:38:19,845 --> 00:38:21,209
YOU E-MAILED ME
THE WRONG PAPER.

763
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:23,736
YOU DIDN'T EVEN READ IT
BEFORE YOU TURNED IT IN?

764
00:38:23,897 --> 00:38:24,935
I DIDN'T THINK I HAD TO!

765
00:38:25,135 --> 00:38:27,399
THE ONE YOU WROTE
THAT NIGHT WAS GREAT.
WELL, AFTER YOU LEFT,

766
00:38:27,502 --> 00:38:29,038
I DECIDED I REALLY SHOULD
PUT IT IN YOUR WORDS.

767
00:38:32,759 --> 00:38:34,750
IS THIS SOME WEIRD CHICK THING
YOU DID 'CAUSE YOU'RE INTO ME?

768
00:38:35,628 --> 00:38:36,316
OH, PLEASE.

769
00:38:37,893 --> 00:38:38,948
NO, NO. NO, IT IS.

770
00:38:39,149 --> 00:38:40,628
YOU'RE, UH, PISSED 'CAUSE
I HOOKED UP WITH YOUR FRIEND.

771
00:38:40,893 --> 00:38:42,901
NO, I'M PISSED BECAUSE
YOU TOLD ME SOME SOB STORY

772
00:38:43,036 --> 00:38:43,940
SO I'D WRITE YOUR PAPER
FOR U.

773
00:38:45,052 --> 00:38:46,100
NOW YOU OWE ME 15 BUCKS.

774
00:38:47,804 --> 00:38:50,371
YOU KNOW WHAT? HERE.

775
00:38:53,002 --> 00:38:54,266
<i>OH, AND, UH,
I DID LEARN SOMETHING.</i>

776
00:38:55,506 --> 00:38:57,169
IAGO BETRAYED OTHELLO
BECAUSE HE WAS JEALOUS.

777
00:39:07,072 --> 00:39:08,608
OH, DANIELLE, I THOUGHT YOU'D
BE WITH MR. FALADI TONIGHT.

778
00:39:09,537 --> 00:39:11,007
OH, YOU'LL BE HAPPY TO KNOW
HE DUMPED ME.

779
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,775
<i>HE DUMPED YOU?
SAID IT WAS
GETTING TOO MESSY,</i>

780
00:39:13,887 --> 00:39:15,358
THAT I WAS GONNA
COMPLICATE HIS DIVORCE.

781
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:18,771
DON'T PRETEND YOU'RE SORRY.

782
00:39:19,303 --> 00:39:20,263
I DON'T PLAN TO.

783
00:39:20,982 --> 00:39:23,262
WELL, I HOPE THIS DOESN'T MAKE
HISTORY CLASS TOO AWKWARD.

784
00:39:23,757 --> 00:39:25,093
OH, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT THAT.

785
00:39:25,399 --> 00:39:26,957
I WENT TO THE PRINCIPAL
AND GOT HIS ASS FIRED,

786
00:39:27,478 --> 00:39:29,541
AND THEN WHEN HE CALLED TO YELL
AT ME FOR SQUEALING ON HIM,

787
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:32,796
I RECORDED THE CALL AND SENT
A TAPE OF IT TO HIS WIFE.

788
00:39:33,436 --> 00:39:35,964
THANKS TO ME, HE'LL BE GETTING
NOTHING IN THIS DIVORCE.

789
00:39:40,479 --> 00:39:42,220
WELL, I MUST SAY
THAT WAS RATHER UNDERHANDED.

790
00:39:42,812 --> 00:39:45,396
YES. I WONDER
WHERE SHE GETS IT.

791
00:39:49,796 --> 00:39:50,570
(Kayla) BYE, DADDY.

792
00:39:50,915 --> 00:39:52,705
BYE,HIPMUNK. I'LL SEE
YOU GUYS NEXT FRIDAY, OKAY?

793
00:39:53,899 --> 00:39:55,843
KAYLA SAID THAT
YOU'RE OPENING A PIZZA PLACE.

794
00:39:57,138 --> 00:39:59,978
WELL, MAYBE. I MEAN,
IT'S NOT A DONE DEAL YET.

795
00:40:00,626 --> 00:40:01,026
AH...

796
00:40:02,306 --> 00:40:04,041
LYNETTE PUT
THE KIBOSH ON IT, HUH?

797
00:40:05,297 --> 00:40:06,690
WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT?
(chuckles)

798
00:40:07,089 --> 00:40:07,792
WELL, YOU KNOW...

799
00:40:08,937 --> 00:40:09,535
LYNETTE.

800
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,481
WELL, SHE'S PROBABLY RIGHT.

801
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:14,616
I MEAN, THERE'S A BUNCH
OF DUMB SCHMUCKS OUT THERE

802
00:40:14,751 --> 00:40:17,414
TRYING TO OPEN
A RESTAURANT, SO...
YOU KNOW, TOM,
I'VE TASTED YOUR PIZZA,

803
00:40:18,543 --> 00:40:20,271
AND I HAVE TO BE
PERFECTLY HONEST WITH YOU.

804
00:40:21,902 --> 00:40:24,326
IT WAS LIKE I DIED
AND WENT TO ITALY.

805
00:40:26,766 --> 00:40:27,284
REALLY?

806
00:40:27,736 --> 00:40:30,148
OH, MY GOD.
YOU ARE BORN TO DO THIS,

807
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:32,253
AND I JUST HATE TO SEE YOU
GIVE IT UP, BECAUSE, WELL...

808
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,052
MAN,
THIS IS NONE OF MY BUSINESS,

809
00:40:37,181 --> 00:40:39,004
BUT LYNETTE DOES...

810
00:40:40,691 --> 00:40:42,891
BULLY YOU SOMETIMES.

811
00:40:44,362 --> 00:40:45,290
WELL, SHE DOESN'T MEAN TO.

812
00:40:45,458 --> 00:40:47,267
THEN DON'T LET HER!
YOU GO TO THE MAT ON THIS ONE.

813
00:40:47,333 --> 00:40:50,903
SHE WILL RESPECT YOU
A LOT MORE IF YOU GROW A PAIR.

814
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,791
I'M NOT
TRYING TO INSULT YOU.

815
00:40:55,684 --> 00:40:57,838
ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT...

816
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,586
I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE CAPABLE OF,

817
00:41:04,547 --> 00:41:06,244
AND I BELIEVE IN YOU.

818
00:41:08,731 --> 00:41:10,602
I REALLY NEEDED TO HEAR THAT.
(chuckles)

819
00:41:14,011 --> 00:41:15,145
THANKS.

820
00:41:22,827 --> 00:41:23,859
<i>SABOTAGE--</i>

821
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:26,304
<i>EVERYONE IS CAPABLE OF IT,</i>

822
00:41:26,953 --> 00:41:30,392
<i>BUT SOME GO ABOUT IT
MORE RUTHLESSLY THAN OTHERS...</i>

823
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,071
<i>LIKE THE ONES
WHO CRAVE VENGEANCE...</i>

824
00:41:38,214 --> 00:41:41,181
<i>OR THE ONES
WHO HUNGER FOR LOVE...</i>
