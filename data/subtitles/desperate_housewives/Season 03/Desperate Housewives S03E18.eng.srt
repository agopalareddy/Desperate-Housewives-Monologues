previous on desperate housewives

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:04,570
Mike's therapy hit a snag.

3
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:05,830
Keep telling you,I don't remember.

4
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:07,190
Something happened at the movie.

5
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:08,240
Who did you see it with?

6
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,150
Probably Susan.

7
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,360
Why not ask her about it?

8
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,100
- Mike,it wasn't a movie, that was us.
- What?

9
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,470
That was the first night that
we spent together.

10
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,230
I saw you watching us.

11
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,830
We were just talking.

12
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,010
Gaby saw another side of Victor.

13
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,190
I didn't marry an angry woman.

14
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,010
I just divorced one.

15
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,030
And I set her up in a nice house,

16
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,920
and gave her allowance then
I came and went as I please

17
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,310
I've known you for two weeks,

18
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,100
and this is the first glimpse of a guy
I could actually like.

19
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,740
Tom's back put him out of commission.

20
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,390
It'll be a while
before he's back on his feet.

21
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,530
How much of a while?

22
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,150
Three months.

23
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,580
And Eddie bared more her soul for Carlos.

24
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,620
Im here,and I'm asking for a chance.

25
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:52,810
Eddie Britt had always thought of herself
as passionate--

26
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,020
aggressively...

27
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,410
relentlesly...

28
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,980
violently passionate.

29
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,410
Carlos Solis had always thought
of himself as passionate

30
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,690
romantically...

31
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,610
spontaneously...

32
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,010
constant passionate.

33
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:19,450
So it was natural for Eddie and Carlos
to assume that if they ever had sex,

34
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,970
it would be amazing.

35
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,820
And, in fact, it was...

36
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:26,650
amazingly...

37
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:27,740
bad.

38
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:30,030
- Morning.
- Morning.

39
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:34,780
So, uh, last night...

40
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,430
Yeah, I know.

41
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,210
Wow.

42
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,490
Super wow.

44
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,220
Oh, man, I gotta get to work.

45
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,320
Ah, I gotta get home.

46
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:56,420
Uh... Oh! We should do this again.

47
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,330
Oh, definitely.

48
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,630
Yeah, this week doesn't seem to be that great.

49
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,060
- Maybe...
- Ugh! Next week, I'm swamped.

50
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,060
Well, we'll figure something out.

51
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:11,760
It was at that moment Eddie and Carlos
had the exact same thought...

52
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,280
Thank you.

53
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,510
No... Thank you.

54
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,940
They would definitely
be having sex again...

55
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,530
just not...

56
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,050
with each other.

It's so easy to spot the lonely ones.

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,220
It wn't the fit time...

62
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,580

to their plants...

63
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,700
I kind of like him.

64

- D have arguments with their tv.
- Get him off the court!

He w rning like his feet
are made out of lead!

68
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:35,340
And the loneliest of all are the ones
who talk to people...

I tipped the glass just
likyou told me to.

132
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:07,870

Why do you ask?

136
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,820

00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,530

He was on the e talkg to someone.

144
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,920
So what does "bad in bed" mean?

145
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:43,940
Well,it means that
you're not good at making...

146
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,170
your bed.

147
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:52,160
And mmy don't like people saying
she can't make a bed because...

148
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:56,930

as good as your mommy.
