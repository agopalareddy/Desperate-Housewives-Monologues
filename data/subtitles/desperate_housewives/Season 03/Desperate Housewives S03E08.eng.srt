00:00:00,078 --> 00:00:02,072
Previously on Desperate Housewives...

2
00:00:02,521 --> 00:00:03,467
The new neighbor...

3
00:00:03,468 --> 00:00:05,199
-He's cute.
-He's a bachelor.

4
00:00:05,296 --> 00:00:06,786
Became a hero.

5
00:00:08,417 --> 00:00:11,269
In a crisis that brought
Julie and Austin together,

6
00:00:11,449 --> 00:00:13,739
while Carlos and
Gaby broke apart.

7
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:17,258
I had a career and a future,
but I gave it all up for you,

8
00:00:17,368 --> 00:00:18,840
and what did I get in return?

9
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:22,083
The police assembled
their pieces of evidence.

10
00:00:22,395 --> 00:00:24,120
Your phone number was
written on her hand.

11
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,516
I can't help you.

12
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,653
No memory, huh?
That's convenient.

13
00:00:33,322 --> 00:00:36,718
Karen McCluskey had always
believed in helping others,

14
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:39,730
whether they wanted
her help or not.

15
00:00:42,247 --> 00:00:43,033
What's all this?

16
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:45,732
You know how you never got around
to painting your garage door?

17
00:00:46,027 --> 00:00:47,463
Well, it's done.

18
00:00:48,188 --> 00:00:49,631
Hope you like blue.

19
00:00:52,448 --> 00:00:54,983
Baxter!
You found him!

20
00:00:55,058 --> 00:00:56,603
Yeah, and I got him
neutered, too.

21
00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:59,232
I figured you wouldn't want
any more strays around here.

22
00:01:01,287 --> 00:01:03,053
-Karen!
-Hi, Alberta.

23
00:01:03,398 --> 00:01:07,090
I took these down for you since, you
know, Christmas was six months ago.

24
00:01:08,885 --> 00:01:13,672
Yes, Mrs. McCluskey's helping hand
was known throughout Wisteria Lane.

25
00:01:13,827 --> 00:01:17,311
But on this day, it was
about to get slapped.

26
00:01:17,337 --> 00:01:18,582
What the hell
are you doing?

27
00:01:19,378 --> 00:01:21,283
Jeez, Edie, you scared me.

28
00:01:21,655 --> 00:01:22,683
What are you doing here?

29
00:01:22,686 --> 00:01:25,451
Getting Mike's house ready. He comes
back from the hospital tomorrow.

30
00:01:25,467 --> 00:01:27,351
Since when do you have
a key to his garage?

31
00:01:27,947 --> 00:01:30,822
He gave me one...
in case of an emergency.

32
00:01:31,058 --> 00:01:32,422
Don't lie to me, prune.

33
00:01:33,058 --> 00:01:34,771
Fine, I found it under his mat.

34
00:01:34,786 --> 00:01:36,233
Look, I'm not doing
anything wrong.

35
00:01:36,237 --> 00:01:40,001
I just come over once a week and start
his mower so the engine doesn't get rusty.

36
00:01:40,295 --> 00:01:42,241
And do you mow your
lawn with it, too?

37
00:01:42,506 --> 00:01:44,591
What's the big deal?
I'm doing him a favor.

38
00:01:44,636 --> 00:01:46,881
Well, he doesn't need
any favors from you.

39
00:01:47,336 --> 00:01:49,202
I'm gonna go through
Mike's house room by room,

40
00:01:49,216 --> 00:01:52,813
and if I find as much as one paper
clip missing, I'm calling the cops.

41
00:01:53,908 --> 00:01:55,712
Funny you should talk
about stuff that's missing.

44
00:02:00,626 --> 00:02:02,380
Oh, don't act for me.

45
00:02:02,847 --> 00:02:05,333
I know that Mike's been having
troubles with his memory.

46
00:02:05,508 --> 00:02:06,513
My guess...

47
00:02:07,006 --> 00:02:10,292
You don't want him to remember how
crazy he was about his old girlfriend.

48
00:02:11,057 --> 00:02:13,651
I don't need to resort to
deception to land a man.

49
00:02:14,508 --> 00:02:17,103
Oh, Edie,
I saved the pictures...

50
00:02:18,868 --> 00:02:21,753
And I can show them
to Mike anytime I like.

51
00:02:25,006 --> 00:02:28,852
Yes, Karen McCluskey
believed in helping others...

52
00:02:28,987 --> 00:02:30,430
Where are you
going with this?

53
00:02:30,806 --> 00:02:33,180
Which she felt gave
her the right...

54
00:02:36,335 --> 00:02:37,912
To help herself.

57
00:03:20,626 --> 00:03:22,183
So remember
to be polite...

58
00:03:22,206 --> 00:03:25,010
Each year as part of
their fund-raising drive,

59
00:03:25,177 --> 00:03:28,842
the Fairview adventure scouts
would award a shiny new bike

60
00:03:28,847 --> 00:03:31,920
to whoever sold the most
magazine subscriptions.

61
00:03:32,676 --> 00:03:37,392
And each scout would set out utterly
convinced the prize would be hers.

62
00:03:40,115 --> 00:03:41,921
That's the beauty of youth.

63
00:03:42,086 --> 00:03:44,951
Little girls believe
anything is possible...

64
00:03:45,898 --> 00:03:49,671
That is, until they grow
up anget divorced.

65
00:03:50,128 --> 00:03:50,800
Hi.

66
00:03:51,488 --> 00:03:54,260
What if I told you there is a
way you could help children,

67
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:57,573
while also reading your favorite
magazines at a reduced price?

68
00:03:57,825 --> 00:03:59,112
Would you like
to hear more?

69
00:03:59,795 --> 00:04:01,452
Sure, knock yourself out.

70
00:04:02,297 --> 00:04:03,243
Wise choice.

71
00:04:03,336 --> 00:04:05,293
For the lady of the
house, we offer...

72
00:04:05,456 --> 00:04:08,542
Redbook, Glamour,
"Vog-you"...

73
00:04:08,645 --> 00:04:10,360
I think you mean
Vogue, sweetie.

74
00:04:10,596 --> 00:04:11,273
You sure?

75
00:04:11,447 --> 00:04:13,143
I should know.
I was on the cover.

76
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:16,233
No way.

77
00:04:17,626 --> 00:04:18,891
Uh, way.

78
00:04:22,407 --> 00:04:26,122
Oh, see that coat I'm wearing in
this shot? That's genuine ocelot fur.

79
00:04:27,155 --> 00:04:30,532
Although the photographer was the real
animal, if you know what I'm saying...

80
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:35,633
Which I hope you don't.

81
00:04:37,048 --> 00:04:38,642
And don't ever
do drugs, okay?

82
00:04:39,278 --> 00:04:41,691
Being a model must
be so amazing.

83
00:04:42,195 --> 00:04:43,330
Why did you stop?

84
00:04:44,278 --> 00:04:46,110
Well, I fell in love,

85
00:04:46,555 --> 00:04:49,150
got married and moved
to the suburbs for the

86
00:04:49,448 --> 00:04:51,972
whole fairy-tale
happy ending thing.

87
00:04:52,445 --> 00:04:53,863
That was a crock.

88
00:04:54,488 --> 00:04:56,472
So you going back
to modeling?

89
00:04:57,357 --> 00:04:58,872
No. No, no, no,
no, no, no.

90
00:04:59,657 --> 00:05:00,290
Why not?

91
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,302
What else are
you gonna do?

92
00:05:06,138 --> 00:05:08,641
You're going back to modeling?
This is so sudden.

93
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,270
Well, let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

94
00:05:10,288 --> 00:05:13,493
I'm just gonna fly to New York, meet with
my old agent and take it from there.

95
00:05:16,397 --> 00:05:19,870
Come on, you guys, this is
exciting. Be happy for me.

96
00:05:20,465 --> 00:05:23,200
We are. We're just gonna
miss you, that's all.

97
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:27,052
Well, now that my divorce is final,
I need a reason to wake up in the morning.

98
00:05:27,338 --> 00:05:29,922
I have this hole in my life that
can't be filled by shopping.

99
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:34,082
That's right, I said it.

100
00:05:37,508 --> 00:05:39,083
Oh, my Gosh.
Lynette.

101
00:05:42,988 --> 00:05:45,530
I'll get the kids.
They're dying to see you.

102
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:46,403
Hey.

103
00:05:47,137 --> 00:05:49,692
Hey!
Oh, my Gosh!

104
00:05:49,687 --> 00:05:51,821
You  didn't have
to do this!

105
00:05:52,075 --> 00:05:52,781
Hi!

106
00:05:53,976 --> 00:05:55,052
You  look great.

107
00:05:55,268 --> 00:05:58,582
Well, apparently, taking a .38 slug
to the shoulder agrees with you.

108
00:05:58,598 --> 00:06:02,612
Yeah, um, listen, about that...
The kids don't know what happened.

109
00:06:02,747 --> 00:06:03,332
They don't?

110
00:06:03,527 --> 00:06:05,893
I thought they were little young to
deal with their mother getting shot.

111
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,650
All I told them is Kayla is
staying with her grandmother,

112
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:11,242
and I made up a story
about how I got hurt.

113
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:13,163
-Hey, Mom!
-Oh, here they are!

114
00:06:13,168 --> 00:06:14,223
-Hey!
-Mommy!

115
00:06:14,408 --> 00:06:16,500
Hello. Oh, this side. Hi!

116
00:06:17,078 --> 00:06:17,922
Hello!

117
00:06:18,736 --> 00:06:20,823
I can't believe you got
in a fight with a hobo.

118
00:06:22,888 --> 00:06:23,562
Yeah...

119
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,213
Well, let's see how well you
do on a morphine drip.

120
00:06:26,328 --> 00:06:29,721
Mommy, come inside. We helped Mrs.
McCluskey make your favorite lunch.

121
00:06:29,736 --> 00:06:32,431
Fantastic! Lead the
way, I'm coming in.

122
00:06:32,486 --> 00:06:34,233
-Hurry up. I'm hungry.
-Let's go. Let's go.

123
00:06:34,618 --> 00:06:37,780
There she is!
Hi, my little bunny!

124
00:06:42,066 --> 00:06:44,283
Hey, why don't you go inside
and get the party started?

125
00:06:44,286 --> 00:06:45,663
I've gotta... Okay?

126
00:06:45,675 --> 00:06:47,681
-Gotcha.
-Hi, bunny. I'll be right there.

127
00:06:53,066 --> 00:06:53,901
Hey.

128
00:06:54,116 --> 00:06:56,053
-Hey, Lynette!
-Uh, yeah.

129
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:57,550
-You're home.
-Yeah.

130
00:06:58,057 --> 00:06:58,961
How you doing?

131
00:06:59,125 --> 00:06:59,913
I'm good.

132
00:07:00,056 --> 00:07:01,230
I just...

133
00:07:04,067 --> 00:07:05,023
How do I...

134
00:07:06,338 --> 00:07:08,282
Thank the man
who saved my life?

135
00:07:09,827 --> 00:07:11,543
You don't have
to say anything.

136
00:07:15,496 --> 00:07:16,941
I'm gonna make
you a cake.

137
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:19,972
-A cake?
-Yeah.

138
00:07:20,018 --> 00:07:22,312
I never make cakes.
This is huge.

139
00:07:22,766 --> 00:07:23,972
In that case...

140
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:25,791
Thanks.

141
00:07:32,898 --> 00:07:34,910
Yeah, I'm gonna
make you a cake.

142
00:07:39,868 --> 00:07:41,873
Christmas carols?
It's not even Thanksgiving.

143
00:07:42,058 --> 00:07:44,120
I'm starting my cards
early this year.

144
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,556
It puts me in the mood
to spread holiday cheer.

145
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,293
And with the pack of lies in this family
newsletter, she spreads holiday denial.

146
00:07:50,372 --> 00:07:53,808
Andrew, it's etiquette. Nobody wants
to read the truth at Christmas.

147
00:07:53,929 --> 00:07:54,920
Well said, darling.

148
00:07:54,926 --> 00:07:58,801
Honey, would you put on another CD?
Something with sleigh bells.

149
00:07:59,465 --> 00:08:03,240
Oh, by the way, Orson, I need your
mother's address at the nursing home.

150
00:08:04,306 --> 00:08:08,353
Oh, well, I appreciate the thought,
darling, but you needn't send her a card.

151
00:08:08,598 --> 00:08:11,620
Oh, don't be silly. I'm sending one
to the man who reads our gas meter.

152
00:08:11,627 --> 00:08:13,100
I can certainly send
one to your mother.

153
00:08:13,156 --> 00:08:16,000
She's completely senile. She'll
only try to dunk it in her coffee.

154
00:08:16,036 --> 00:08:17,921
Well, all the more
reason to send her one.

155
00:08:18,158 --> 00:08:21,140
Let the nurses know that she has
family at home who loves her...

156
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:24,873
and who could drop by at any minute
and slap them with a lawsuit.

157
00:08:26,407 --> 00:08:27,553
Bree, I hear what
you're saying-

158
00:08:27,656 --> 00:08:30,423
Orson, what's the big deal?
It's just an address.

159
00:08:32,246 --> 00:08:32,892
Fine.

160
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:34,281
I'll get my book.

161
00:08:34,855 --> 00:08:36,591
The home is somewhere
over in Lakeview.

162
00:08:37,758 --> 00:08:38,592
Lakeview?

163
00:08:38,607 --> 00:08:40,922
Oh, you gave me the impression
that she was back east.

164
00:08:41,075 --> 00:08:43,343
Well, that's because, frankly,
I wanted to avoid this conversation.

165
00:08:44,258 --> 00:08:47,780
But if she's only 30 minutes away,
why haven't you been visiting her?

166
00:08:48,255 --> 00:08:49,681
Okay, the truth is...

167
00:08:50,628 --> 00:08:52,411
It breaks my heart
to see her now.

168
00:08:52,418 --> 00:08:54,332
I want to remember
her as she was.

169
00:08:55,138 --> 00:08:56,261
-But, Orson...
-Bree,

170
00:08:56,457 --> 00:09:00,182
I refuse to sit in a room that smells
of disinfectant and lime Jell-O,

171
00:09:00,188 --> 00:09:02,691
making small talk with a woman
who doesn't remember me.

172
00:09:02,797 --> 00:09:04,183
Now let it go, damn it.

173
00:09:10,768 --> 00:09:12,832
But by all means,
do send a card.

174
00:09:16,117 --> 00:09:17,910
The elves will tickle her.

175
00:09:25,345 --> 00:09:26,491
Well, shall we?

176
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:27,370
Wait.

177
00:09:27,917 --> 00:09:30,870
Julie's gonna know we came home early
from the restaurant to check up on her.

178
00:09:30,905 --> 00:09:33,152
I don't want her to think
I'm overprotective and clingy.

179
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:36,523
The girl was held hostage. It's only
natural you're gonna be a little bit clingy.

180
00:09:36,537 --> 00:09:39,231
Yeah, it's been a week.
I'm getting on her nerves.

181
00:09:39,817 --> 00:09:40,661
How about this?

182
00:09:40,827 --> 00:09:43,082
We came home early because
we hated the restaurant.

183
00:09:43,126 --> 00:09:45,583
The service was dreadful,
and the lobster was inedible.

184
00:09:46,447 --> 00:09:47,380
Okay.

185
00:09:52,296 --> 00:09:55,881
Wait, if we hated the restaurant,
then why are we bringing home food?

186
00:09:55,986 --> 00:09:57,061
Good point.

187
00:09:57,266 --> 00:09:59,010
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Are you kidding?!

188
00:09:59,426 --> 00:10:00,700
That's lobster!

189
00:10:01,007 --> 00:10:03,763
Okay, I thought the
restaurant was fantastic,

190
00:10:04,657 --> 00:10:08,160
and you were the fussy snob
who was impossible to please.

191
00:10:08,568 --> 00:10:10,693
Why do I have to
be the fussy snob?

192
00:10:11,137 --> 00:10:12,541
Because you're british.

193
00:10:12,806 --> 00:10:13,540
Fine.

194
00:10:13,806 --> 00:10:15,462
But I trust you'll make
it up to me later

195
00:10:15,475 --> 00:10:19,203
by doing the things a gentleman
expects when he's sprung for lobster.

196
00:10:33,148 --> 00:10:35,182
I'm not getting any
tonight, am I?

197
00:10:37,075 --> 00:10:38,463
You're  supposed to
be having dinner!

198
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:41,111
It's my fault. I found the
restaurant to be absolutely...

199
00:10:41,126 --> 00:10:45,330
Oh, let it go. We came home because I was
worried about you, and with good reason.

200
00:10:45,506 --> 00:10:47,901
You, put on your
shirt and get out.

201
00:10:48,167 --> 00:10:50,231
Well, I didn't bring a shirt.

202
00:10:51,378 --> 00:10:54,081
-See, I was out running and...
-Who cares?! Go!

203
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:57,941
How  could you
treat him like that?

204
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:00,431
If Austin hadn't been in that
supermarket, I might not be here.

205
00:11:00,445 --> 00:11:04,490
Yes, and I am grateful, but I found a way
to say "thank you" without taking my top off.

206
00:11:04,596 --> 00:11:07,383
A couple of buttons came undone.
It's not like my boobs were out.

207
00:11:07,398 --> 00:11:10,412
Okay, well, it's, uh, it's
getting late and I really...

208
00:11:10,425 --> 00:11:12,683
No, Ian, am I overreacting here?

209
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:17,423
Well, I can understand on the heels of a crisis,
two people might bondand find themselves...

210
00:11:18,528 --> 00:11:19,950
You're a very naughty girl!

211
00:11:20,678 --> 00:11:23,241
Julie, that boy
drinks, he steals,

212
00:11:23,256 --> 00:11:25,663
and now I find him mauling
you on my couch? That's it.

213
00:11:25,777 --> 00:11:26,970
I forbid you to see him.

214
00:11:27,056 --> 00:11:29,023
You can't do that.
I choose who I date.

215
00:11:29,067 --> 00:11:31,741
Yeah? Well, I choose to
ground you. Two weeks, baby.

216
00:11:32,188 --> 00:11:33,451
Fine, I'll just see
him at school.

217
00:11:33,478 --> 00:11:35,553
Well, then you won't go to
school. I'll homeschool you.

218
00:11:35,566 --> 00:11:37,872
Right, you're gonna teach me trig?
You can't even balance your own checkbook.

219
00:11:37,887 --> 00:11:40,571
Yes, and you will be poorly educated,
and you won't get into college,

220
00:11:40,578 --> 00:11:44,210
and you will work for minimum wage for
the rest of your life, all because of that boy!

221
00:11:44,335 --> 00:11:45,682
I hope you're happy!

222
00:11:46,655 --> 00:11:50,562
Mom, I like this guy, and I'm
sorry if it makes you unhappy,

223
00:11:50,775 --> 00:11:52,312
but I'm going to
keep seeing him.

224
00:12:05,465 --> 00:12:06,890
Doesn't the place look great?

225
00:12:08,147 --> 00:12:09,823
I came in and straightened up.

226
00:12:09,838 --> 00:12:11,873
I wanted everything
to look nice for you.

227
00:12:15,148 --> 00:12:15,933
You okay?

228
00:12:18,198 --> 00:12:20,521
Yeah. Yeah, it's just that...

229
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:24,743
I'm home, but it doesn't
really feel like home.

230
00:12:26,016 --> 00:12:27,892
It will. Give it time.

231
00:12:28,846 --> 00:12:31,173
The important thing is that
you're back from the hospital,

232
00:12:31,898 --> 00:12:33,780
and every day
you're getting better.

233
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:37,563
Hey, the worst is behind you.

234
00:12:43,427 --> 00:12:44,892
I need the Delfino
search warrant.

235
00:12:44,906 --> 00:12:46,861
We're not gonna get it
without proble cause.

236
00:12:46,865 --> 00:12:49,171
The guy's phone number was
written on a dead girl's hand.

237
00:12:49,187 --> 00:12:50,811
The judge is gonna need more.

238
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:54,333
I thought you might say that.
Here's Monique Polier's lab work.

239
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:57,863
The infrared spectroscopy
matched paint fragments

240
00:12:57,878 --> 00:13:00,931
in the head wound to the
proximo line of pipe wrenches.

241
00:13:01,215 --> 00:13:04,181
They're high-end, only used
by professional plumbers.

242
00:13:05,046 --> 00:13:07,951
And guess what our boy
Delfino does for a living?

243
00:13:09,947 --> 00:13:11,121
I'll see what I can do.

244
00:13:14,588 --> 00:13:15,861
What do you mean
you can't shoot her?

245
00:13:15,867 --> 00:13:19,731
Francesco, if you can airbrush her acne,
you can airbrush the track marks.

246
00:13:20,055 --> 00:13:22,211
Now don't call me
again unless she O.D.S.

247
00:13:22,606 --> 00:13:24,882
Gabrielle, ma petite fille!

248
00:13:26,007 --> 00:13:27,491
Oh, sit!

249
00:13:27,745 --> 00:13:30,791
You look amazing,
younger than ever!

250
00:13:30,807 --> 00:13:32,023
It's my new dermal filler.

251
00:13:32,257 --> 00:13:34,910
It's banned here, so my assistant
smuggles it in from Brazil.

252
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:37,863
Isn't it fun? I have
my own drug mule.

253
00:13:38,435 --> 00:13:39,900
That's great!

254
00:13:40,506 --> 00:13:42,633
Well, I have some
fun news of my own.

255
00:13:43,085 --> 00:13:45,310
-I'm ready to model again.
-Really?

256
00:13:46,206 --> 00:13:48,612
The last time we spoke,
you couldn't wait to quit.

257
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:50,663
You were giving
it all up for love.

258
00:13:51,076 --> 00:13:52,792
What happened
to prince charming?

259
00:13:54,296 --> 00:13:55,501
Divorce.

260
00:13:55,936 --> 00:13:57,690
Oh, single again?

261
00:13:57,858 --> 00:14:00,530
Isn't that ironic, since
I'm the one you called...

262
00:14:00,987 --> 00:14:02,252
How did you put it?

263
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:06,800
A "career-obsessed lesbo who would
die alone and be eaten by her cats."

264
00:14:08,365 --> 00:14:09,632
Did I say that?

265
00:14:09,877 --> 00:14:11,143
Water under the bridge.

266
00:14:11,146 --> 00:14:12,522
I thought it was funny.

267
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:15,133
It's even funnier now.

268
00:14:16,376 --> 00:14:18,340
Look, Marcella, I'm back.

269
00:14:18,528 --> 00:14:22,031
And we made such a great team
before, and I think we can be again.

270
00:14:22,045 --> 00:14:24,110
I don't know, darling.
Things are different now.

271
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:27,253
You're not gonna be able to jump
right back in where you left off.

272
00:14:27,378 --> 00:14:28,721
Well,  I just wanna work.

273
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,842
Boy, I'm still not sure.

274
00:14:31,998 --> 00:14:33,200
You know what might help?

275
00:14:34,385 --> 00:14:35,781
If you groveled.

276
00:14:37,305 --> 00:14:38,410
Are you serious?

277
00:14:40,306 --> 00:14:42,742
Well, I can't tell because your
face doesn't move anymore.

278
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:44,642
No, I'm joking!

279
00:14:44,647 --> 00:14:46,343
Welcome back, darling!

280
00:14:53,235 --> 00:14:54,383
Hi.

281
00:14:57,848 --> 00:14:58,680
Thank you.

282
00:15:03,238 --> 00:15:04,321
Well, hello there!

283
00:15:06,216 --> 00:15:08,260
How pretty you look today!

284
00:15:08,655 --> 00:15:11,093
It's wonderful that
you're up and about!

285
00:15:11,345 --> 00:15:14,252
You must be enjoying
these colorful balloons!

286
00:15:18,235 --> 00:15:21,182
Why are you talking to
me like I'm a moron?

287
00:15:23,295 --> 00:15:24,841
Oh, I'm...
I'm so sorry.

288
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:28,423
The nurse pointed me over here.
I'm looking for Gloria Hodge.

289
00:15:28,736 --> 00:15:30,333
I'm Gloria Hodge.

290
00:15:30,907 --> 00:15:32,291
Who might you be?

291
00:15:36,397 --> 00:15:39,232
Well, I must say, I'm surprised
at how lucid you are.

292
00:15:39,518 --> 00:15:40,613
Orson led me to believe...

293
00:15:40,626 --> 00:15:42,873
That I was in the final
stages of dementia?

294
00:15:42,927 --> 00:15:46,663
No, I'm afraid that's just
wishful thinking on his part.

295
00:15:46,688 --> 00:15:49,072
Well, how can he feel that
way? You're his mother.

296
00:15:49,118 --> 00:15:50,941
I wouldn't judge
him too harshly.

297
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:55,120
Ours is a...
complicated relationship.

298
00:15:55,377 --> 00:15:57,360
There is love,
to be sure,

299
00:15:57,526 --> 00:15:59,712
but we have a way of
disappointing each other.

300
00:16:00,967 --> 00:16:03,561
Well, how does
he disappoint you?

301
00:16:03,618 --> 00:16:06,172
He's cold, rigid...

302
00:16:06,857 --> 00:16:07,422
And...

303
00:16:08,117 --> 00:16:11,401
And utterly incapable
of letting go of the past.

304
00:16:11,996 --> 00:16:13,863
And how do you
disappoint him?

305
00:16:14,517 --> 00:16:16,033
I refuse to die.

306
00:16:18,765 --> 00:16:22,592
Yes, I see. Well, surely
this rift isn't irreparable.

307
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:28,203
Do you know how people in nursing
homes spend their days, Bree?

308
00:16:29,168 --> 00:16:30,570
They think about the past,

309
00:16:31,468 --> 00:16:35,103
and all the things they'd do
differently if they had the chance.

310
00:16:36,136 --> 00:16:38,473
Please tell Orson
that I'm sorry,

311
00:16:39,226 --> 00:16:41,873
And in spite of everything,
I still love him.

312
00:16:44,778 --> 00:16:47,572
Well, I have a better idea.
Why don't you tell him yourself?

313
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:56,140
That would be great.

314
00:16:56,427 --> 00:16:57,672
I really appreciate it.

315
00:16:58,795 --> 00:16:59,903
Okay. Thank you.

316
00:17:01,378 --> 00:17:03,261
So what did Ted say? When do
you have to go back to work?

317
00:17:03,275 --> 00:17:05,893
He said take as much
time as I want with pay.

318
00:17:07,135 --> 00:17:08,561
You should get gunned
down more often.

319
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:13,351
-Hey, there they are!
-Hey, guys!

320
00:17:13,777 --> 00:17:14,842
How was school?

321
00:17:16,656 --> 00:17:18,262
Mommy, were you shot?

322
00:17:19,388 --> 00:17:21,420
Shot? Where did
you hear that?

323
00:17:21,865 --> 00:17:23,012
Jordan Blackwelder.

324
00:17:24,465 --> 00:17:27,163
That's the same little creep
who tried to ruin Santa Claus!

325
00:17:27,515 --> 00:17:31,660
And he said that the same crazy lady
that shot you killed auntie Nora dead.

326
00:17:31,856 --> 00:17:33,750
It was on the news
and everything.

327
00:17:34,395 --> 00:17:36,610
Okay, listen, kids.
I am sorry.

328
00:17:36,616 --> 00:17:41,291
We  shouldn't have lied, but sometimes parents
wanna protect the kids fromcary things.

329
00:17:41,308 --> 00:17:44,923
And look, the good news is,
Mommy's fine now.

330
00:17:45,158 --> 00:17:48,993
And we'll all see auntie
Nora again in heaven.

331
00:17:50,935 --> 00:17:51,832
Or wherever.

332
00:17:52,418 --> 00:17:54,141
Did they let you
keep the bullet?

333
00:17:54,358 --> 00:17:55,782
No, no, afraid not.

334
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:58,640
That blows. We wanted to
bring it for show-and-tell.

335
00:18:04,836 --> 00:18:06,090
Hey, sweetheart, you okay?

336
00:18:06,797 --> 00:18:08,890
What if the crazy
lady comes back?

337
00:18:11,748 --> 00:18:12,850
She won't.

338
00:18:14,257 --> 00:18:15,143
How do you know?

339
00:18:15,737 --> 00:18:18,312
Well, because she's...

340
00:18:19,295 --> 00:18:21,421
Up in heaven
with auntie Nora.

341
00:18:21,787 --> 00:18:22,901
Or wherever.

342
00:18:33,355 --> 00:18:36,121
Julie Mayer, you get back here!

343
00:18:36,555 --> 00:18:38,443
You're grounded, remember?!

344
00:18:44,968 --> 00:18:47,441
Edie Britt, I wanna talk to you.

345
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:50,960
I just survived a hostage situation.

346
00:18:51,078 --> 00:18:52,861
Haven't I suffered
enough for one week?

347
00:18:52,886 --> 00:18:55,792
You keep your nephew away
from my daughter or else.

348
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:57,692
Look, I don't like it either,

349
00:18:58,027 --> 00:18:59,783
but the harder we try
to keep them apart,

350
00:18:59,787 --> 00:19:01,843
the more they're gonna
fight to be together.

351
00:19:02,217 --> 00:19:04,460
Just let it run its course.

352
00:19:04,778 --> 00:19:05,911
Are you crazy?!

353
00:19:06,086 --> 00:19:09,511
If we don't do something,
those two could end up having sex!

354
00:19:09,685 --> 00:19:10,523
"Could"?

355
00:19:11,225 --> 00:19:12,423
Oh, my God.

356
00:19:13,338 --> 00:19:15,133
-You don't...
-Let me put it this way-

357
00:19:15,308 --> 00:19:17,733
I got a box of condoms
in my dresser.

358
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,223
Eleven are gone.

359
00:19:19,426 --> 00:19:20,921
Can only account
for eight of 'em.

360
00:19:22,347 --> 00:19:24,681
How can you be so
calm about this?

361
00:19:25,025 --> 00:19:25,671
Edie?

362
00:19:26,238 --> 00:19:26,822
Yeah?

363
00:19:26,995 --> 00:19:29,370
Can you help me
with this tie? I...

364
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:34,590
Hey.

365
00:19:35,328 --> 00:19:35,932
Mike...

366
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,010
You're out of the hospital.

367
00:19:38,325 --> 00:19:40,123
Yeah. He's home.

368
00:19:40,736 --> 00:19:42,630
In fact, we're gonna go
out and celebrate tonight.

369
00:19:44,345 --> 00:19:46,430
I'll be with you in one
sec, okay, babe?

370
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:47,663
Yeah.

371
00:19:51,228 --> 00:19:52,702
Since you asked,

372
00:19:52,967 --> 00:19:55,813
I'm calm because I know if two
people are meant to be together,

373
00:19:56,447 --> 00:19:58,143
there's nothing anyone
can do about it.

374
00:20:03,055 --> 00:20:06,633
Okay, I should be back at around 6:00.
They can have one snack.

375
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:09,280
Try and push apples,
but if they threaten violence,

376
00:20:09,288 --> 00:20:11,612
I have an emergency
candy bar under the sink.

377
00:20:11,676 --> 00:20:12,643
Not anymore you don't.

378
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:14,280
Oh, jeez.

379
00:20:15,917 --> 00:20:17,643
Mommy?
Where are you going?

380
00:20:18,105 --> 00:20:19,061
To the market.

381
00:20:19,197 --> 00:20:19,943
No!

382
00:20:20,598 --> 00:20:23,161
Hey, sweetie,
it's a different market.

383
00:20:23,445 --> 00:20:24,761
You're gonna get shot again.

384
00:20:24,818 --> 00:20:25,552
No, I won't.

385
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:28,592
Lots of mommies go to the
store every day, and they're fine.

386
00:20:28,646 --> 00:20:30,200
It's really not a scary place.

387
00:20:30,305 --> 00:20:33,791
You went to the store, and you
got shot, and auntie Nora died.

388
00:20:39,027 --> 00:20:41,322
I'm only gonna be in there
ten minutes, I promise.

389
00:20:42,286 --> 00:20:43,961
Can't she go?

390
00:20:46,467 --> 00:20:47,391
Fine. I'll go.

391
00:20:48,376 --> 00:20:49,112
Thanks.

392
00:20:50,637 --> 00:20:52,640
Don't give a hoot if
I get shot, do ya, kid?

393
00:21:10,156 --> 00:21:11,550
You must be Tanya.

394
00:21:11,597 --> 00:21:14,491
I'm Gabrielle. We're gonna
be co-models today.

395
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:21,580
Now I don't know if you've ever done one of
these big shoots before, but don't be nervous.

396
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:24,811
Durkin and I are old friends.
He's a sweetheart.

397
00:21:25,297 --> 00:21:29,783
Now just remember, he's the king, do
exactly what he says, and you'll be fine.

398
00:21:32,206 --> 00:21:34,012
I've been modeling
for two years,

399
00:21:34,027 --> 00:21:37,493
I've done six magazine covers,
and I'm sleeping with Durkin.

400
00:21:40,397 --> 00:21:41,973
Well, I guess you're
all set then.

401
00:21:43,578 --> 00:21:45,822
I've got some wardrobe choices.

402
00:21:52,587 --> 00:21:55,113
I want to be buried
in this dress!

403
00:21:55,227 --> 00:21:56,791
This is for Tanya.

404
00:21:57,008 --> 00:21:58,972
The "Mom" stuff is at the end.

405
00:22:00,637 --> 00:22:01,460
"Mom"?

406
00:22:03,508 --> 00:22:05,891
Okay, luv, let's get
the blood pumping!

407
00:22:06,237 --> 00:22:08,360
The concept is "lock
up your daughters".

408
00:22:08,377 --> 00:22:10,353
Okay? Get to work, everybody.

409
00:22:10,816 --> 00:22:15,483
Tanya, I want you to hover down here
on the lawn, looking absolutely delicio.

410
00:22:15,928 --> 00:22:17,072
Thank you very much.

411
00:22:17,136 --> 00:22:20,823
And up here on the porch, Mom
and Dad looking all scandalized.

412
00:22:21,235 --> 00:22:22,321
Excuse me, Durkin?

413
00:22:22,395 --> 00:22:23,170
Yes, luv?

414
00:22:23,857 --> 00:22:25,032
It's Gaby.

415
00:22:27,385 --> 00:22:30,171
Gabrielle Marquez.
You shot me in Milan, remember?

416
00:22:31,118 --> 00:22:32,463
Yes! Yes!

417
00:22:32,848 --> 00:22:34,132
Lovely to see you again.

418
00:22:34,216 --> 00:22:35,441
Did you have a question then?

419
00:22:35,786 --> 00:22:36,790
I do.

420
00:22:39,018 --> 00:22:42,140
Aren't you a little worried
that I'm gonna pull focus?

421
00:22:42,418 --> 00:22:44,051
I mean, it's a little confusing.

422
00:22:44,075 --> 00:22:46,881
People are gonna see Tanya,
and then they're gonna...

423
00:22:47,608 --> 00:22:50,652
See that guy, and they're
gonna wonder who I am.

424
00:22:51,967 --> 00:22:52,611
You're the Mum.

425
00:22:55,548 --> 00:22:57,711
People aren't gonna buy that,
so here's what I was thinking.

426
00:22:58,067 --> 00:22:59,721
I slap on one of those gowns,

427
00:23:00,027 --> 00:23:02,250
I play Tanya's "big sister",

428
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:04,942
home from college
to raise a little help.

429
00:23:06,038 --> 00:23:08,611
And we're gonna cram all
that on a subtitle, are we?

430
00:23:09,337 --> 00:23:11,792
I'm sorry. Is just,
this outfit is hideous!

431
00:23:12,045 --> 00:23:13,202
Just make it work.

432
00:23:15,426 --> 00:23:16,042
Fine.

433
00:23:16,576 --> 00:23:18,152
I just need a moment
to get into character.

434
00:23:23,577 --> 00:23:25,013
Gabrielle, what's the holdup?

435
00:23:25,076 --> 00:23:26,281
We've got to get moving here.

436
00:23:27,315 --> 00:23:28,552
Ready, ready!

437
00:23:31,897 --> 00:23:32,791
What's that?

438
00:23:33,076 --> 00:23:34,273
Oh, I made it work.

439
00:23:34,646 --> 00:23:35,852
I'm "hot Mom".

440
00:23:40,548 --> 00:23:41,592
Get me her agent.

441
00:23:46,845 --> 00:23:51,151
Before we begin, would either of you like
some cookies, milk, lemonade, perhaps?

442
00:23:51,655 --> 00:23:53,381
Mom, why are we here?

443
00:23:53,885 --> 00:23:55,971
Ah, cutting to the chase.

444
00:23:56,097 --> 00:23:57,012
I like it.

445
00:24:01,586 --> 00:24:03,093
I have a confession to make.

446
00:24:03,207 --> 00:24:05,633
This whole dating drama has
been keeping me up at night,

447
00:24:05,885 --> 00:24:08,161
and I hate being the
bitchy, naggy Mom.

448
00:24:08,707 --> 00:24:12,031
When it comes to parenting, I am much
more comfortable playing the good cop.

449
00:24:12,567 --> 00:24:14,420
Do you see where I'm
going with this, kids?

450
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:16,241
No.

451
00:24:17,547 --> 00:24:18,652
Well, in that case.

452
00:24:19,446 --> 00:24:20,671
Meet the bad cop.

453
00:24:23,687 --> 00:24:24,503
Daddy!

454
00:24:24,757 --> 00:24:25,911
Hey, baby girl.

455
00:24:26,387 --> 00:24:27,462
That the guy?

456
00:24:27,807 --> 00:24:28,683
Yep!

457
00:24:29,326 --> 00:24:29,971
Get him.

458
00:24:36,428 --> 00:24:37,771
This is so unfair.

459
00:24:37,818 --> 00:24:40,110
Look, you defied my wishes,
you broke my rules.

460
00:24:40,127 --> 00:24:42,291
Did you really think I was just
gonna throw in the towel?

461
00:24:42,455 --> 00:24:44,952
Face it. I outsmarted you.

462
00:24:53,166 --> 00:24:53,991
Who's Ian?

463
00:24:54,485 --> 00:24:54,951
What?

464
00:24:55,097 --> 00:24:57,923
You're dating some
british guy named Ian.

465
00:24:58,238 --> 00:24:59,292
How did that come up?

466
00:24:59,467 --> 00:25:02,152
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
it was a big secret.

467
00:25:02,248 --> 00:25:05,620
You know, when you said it was
true love with you and the plumber,

468
00:25:06,126 --> 00:25:07,173
I was a good guy.

469
00:25:07,207 --> 00:25:09,702
I stepped aside, and now
you're on to someone else.

470
00:25:10,085 --> 00:25:13,300
Big picture, Karl. His hand
up our daughter's shirt.

471
00:25:13,597 --> 00:25:16,372
-Don't change the subject!
-That is the subject!

472
00:25:16,407 --> 00:25:19,342
How serious is it
with this Ian guy?

473
00:25:19,527 --> 00:25:21,371
I don't know!
It's complicated.

474
00:25:21,488 --> 00:25:23,101
Yeah, he's kind of married.

475
00:25:24,577 --> 00:25:25,591
He's what?

476
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:27,222
It's not what you think.

477
00:25:27,555 --> 00:25:30,503
Well, in her defense,
his wife is in a coma.

478
00:25:31,805 --> 00:25:32,873
All right, that's it!

479
00:25:32,876 --> 00:25:34,972
All right, I forbid
you to see this guy!

480
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:35,850
What?

481
00:25:36,115 --> 00:25:38,303
No! I don't take
orders from you!

482
00:25:38,475 --> 00:25:39,531
Mom has a point, Dad.

483
00:25:39,627 --> 00:25:41,312
You can't tell a woman who
she can and can't date.

484
00:25:41,327 --> 00:25:43,571
-It's her choice.
-Exactly. Thank you.

485
00:25:43,745 --> 00:25:45,500
Wait, no, that does
not apply to you.

486
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:48,210
You know, if you don't
care about my feelings,

487
00:25:48,218 --> 00:25:49,553
I don't know what
I'm doing here.

488
00:25:49,727 --> 00:25:50,781
Your feelings?

489
00:25:50,817 --> 00:25:53,900
My God, you are the
worst bad cop ever!

490
00:25:57,285 --> 00:25:58,181
Go to your room.

491
00:26:01,457 --> 00:26:02,522
Not you!

492
00:26:06,125 --> 00:26:07,751
Get back here!
You're under arrest!

493
00:26:07,777 --> 00:26:08,681
No, I'm not!

494
00:26:10,566 --> 00:26:12,692
Hey, buddy, you've been
reading comic books for a while.

495
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:13,980
Don't you wanna
go and play?

496
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:17,403
No, I wanna stay with you.

497
00:26:17,536 --> 00:26:18,182
Yeah?

498
00:26:19,355 --> 00:26:20,021
Okay.

499
00:26:30,725 --> 00:26:31,642
Hey, Art.

500
00:26:33,066 --> 00:26:34,351
Oh, hey! How are ya?

501
00:26:34,577 --> 00:26:35,563
Good, uh...

502
00:26:35,698 --> 00:26:39,971
Listen, as if saving my life wasn't
enough, I have a little favor to ask.

503
00:26:40,158 --> 00:26:41,030
Sure. What's up?

504
00:26:41,327 --> 00:26:42,922
My kids are having
a hard time.

505
00:26:42,927 --> 00:26:45,981
They're pretty freaked out by
that whole supermarket thing.

506
00:26:45,985 --> 00:26:47,122
You're my hostage!

507
00:26:47,157 --> 00:26:49,423
Keep moving, or I'll
blow your face off!

508
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:51,362
Okay, it's my turn.
Give me the gun.

509
00:26:51,367 --> 00:26:52,571
Not so much them.

510
00:26:53,088 --> 00:26:53,592
Right.

511
00:26:54,057 --> 00:26:55,912
But my other son, Parker.

512
00:26:57,465 --> 00:27:00,090
So. Back to the favor.

513
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:05,012
Hey, Parker.

514
00:27:05,476 --> 00:27:08,473
I want you to meet
our new neighbor, Art.

515
00:27:08,748 --> 00:27:10,202
He lives in the house
across the street.

516
00:27:10,217 --> 00:27:13,123
His sister has the cool
wheelchair witthe joystick.

517
00:27:13,185 --> 00:27:14,041
Hey there, Parker.

518
00:27:14,376 --> 00:27:14,992
Hi.

519
00:27:19,256 --> 00:27:20,360
In the daytime,

520
00:27:20,617 --> 00:27:23,923
Art coaches swimming
at the rec center, but...

521
00:27:25,218 --> 00:27:27,491
Please, I can tell
Parker? Please?

522
00:27:27,598 --> 00:27:31,463
And compromise my secret identity?
No way, Mrs. Scavo. No way.

523
00:27:33,066 --> 00:27:34,652
Secret identity?

524
00:27:35,518 --> 00:27:38,181
Oh, great, now the
cat's out of the bag.

525
00:27:38,195 --> 00:27:39,450
Oh, might as well tell him.

526
00:27:40,197 --> 00:27:43,883
It's okay. You can
trust him, really.

527
00:27:43,977 --> 00:27:47,820
Art is the one who saved
me at the supermarket.

528
00:27:47,927 --> 00:27:50,090
He's sort of a superhero.

529
00:27:54,207 --> 00:27:55,610
Give me a break.

530
00:27:57,938 --> 00:27:59,243
It's true.

531
00:28:01,575 --> 00:28:05,052
All right, if you're a superhero,
what's your name?

532
00:28:05,438 --> 00:28:06,451
I'm...

533
00:28:08,056 --> 00:28:09,221
Protector Man.

534
00:28:10,075 --> 00:28:12,780
Because I protect
people from bad guys.

535
00:28:17,448 --> 00:28:18,673
You don't believe
me, do you?

536
00:28:20,857 --> 00:28:22,160
Okay.

537
00:28:22,946 --> 00:28:25,012
I really shouldn't
do this, but...

538
00:28:29,345 --> 00:28:31,180
Did you really
save my Mom?

539
00:28:32,405 --> 00:28:33,750
I really did.

540
00:28:35,258 --> 00:28:36,522
He really did.

541
00:28:37,458 --> 00:28:38,853
That's why you don't
have to worry.

542
00:28:38,856 --> 00:28:41,303
That's Protector Man's job.

543
00:28:41,315 --> 00:28:45,140
Your job is to run and
play and have fun.

544
00:28:45,947 --> 00:28:46,762
Okay?

545
00:28:49,816 --> 00:28:50,540
Okay.

546
00:28:51,985 --> 00:28:52,683
Okay.

547
00:28:59,765 --> 00:29:02,121
Oh, my cousin
went to Purdue.

548
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:16,311
What the hell?

549
00:29:18,285 --> 00:29:18,962
Delfino.

550
00:29:20,336 --> 00:29:21,890
Nice to see you
up and about.

551
00:29:23,775 --> 00:29:24,690
Here's our search warrant.

552
00:29:24,705 --> 00:29:25,923
Search warrant?

553
00:29:26,217 --> 00:29:27,193
Let me see that.

554
00:29:32,936 --> 00:29:33,680
How we doing?

555
00:29:34,325 --> 00:29:35,691
We couldn't find a toolbox.

556
00:29:36,666 --> 00:29:37,920
The man's a plumber.

557
00:29:38,656 --> 00:29:39,450
Keep looking.

558
00:29:40,506 --> 00:29:41,652
Sir, I can't find a thing.

559
00:29:41,667 --> 00:29:42,321
You tired?

560
00:29:50,016 --> 00:29:51,413
You, come with me.

561
00:29:51,977 --> 00:29:53,623
Marcella, look,

562
00:29:53,987 --> 00:29:55,272
I don't know what
they told you,

563
00:29:55,275 --> 00:29:57,112
but all I'm asking for is
a simple costume change.

564
00:29:57,118 --> 00:29:58,422
You don't get to
pull diva crap.

565
00:29:58,667 --> 00:30:00,782
Tanya gets away with
it because she's a star.

566
00:30:00,856 --> 00:30:02,061
You are nothing.

567
00:30:02,727 --> 00:30:04,392
Where do you get off
talking to me like that?

568
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:06,873
I shot 36 covers by
the time I was 20!

569
00:30:07,118 --> 00:30:08,523
Well, you're 30 now.

570
00:30:09,356 --> 00:30:11,600
When you make that
face, you look 35.

571
00:30:13,798 --> 00:30:16,160
Do you know how many photographers
would die to work with me again?

572
00:30:16,207 --> 00:30:17,640
Yeah. Zero.

573
00:30:17,765 --> 00:30:20,261
I had to call in major favors
just to get you this job.

574
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:21,683
I don't believe that.

575
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,833
Well, you know
what I don't believe?

576
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:25,872
You gave up a brilliant career
to play house in the suburbs,

577
00:30:25,977 --> 00:30:29,253
and the minute it falls apart, you come
back here expecting a homecoming parade.

578
00:30:29,545 --> 00:30:30,752
Well, guess what, sweetie?

579
00:30:30,977 --> 00:30:32,240
We've moved on.

580
00:30:33,525 --> 00:30:36,440
Now get your polyester
ass over there,

581
00:30:36,618 --> 00:30:38,982
and act like the pro
you used to be.

582
00:30:44,838 --> 00:30:46,832
Beautiful, Tanya.
That's it. Chin up.

583
00:30:47,198 --> 00:30:48,122
Fantastic!

584
00:30:48,167 --> 00:30:50,251
Mother, hold the plate higher.

585
00:30:54,576 --> 00:30:56,953
Beautiful, Tanya.
Oh, you are gorgeous!

586
00:30:57,586 --> 00:30:58,872
Yes, girl! Lovely, lovely!

587
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:04,482
Hiya, Mike. Welcome home.
You remember me?

588
00:31:04,807 --> 00:31:06,151
Yeah, I think so.

589
00:31:06,407 --> 00:31:09,341
The corner house with
all the gnomes out front?

590
00:31:09,356 --> 00:31:10,983
You're thinking
of Martha Huber.

591
00:31:11,255 --> 00:31:12,250
Terrible story.

592
00:31:12,296 --> 00:31:15,360
Someone beat her to death, and
then buried her in the forest.

593
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:16,512
Ironic, huh?

594
00:31:16,688 --> 00:31:17,952
Isn't that where
gnomes live?

595
00:31:18,708 --> 00:31:21,222
I don't really know that
much about gnomes.

596
00:31:21,586 --> 00:31:24,243
Anyway, I know the
cops were here earlier.

597
00:31:24,656 --> 00:31:25,450
So?

598
00:31:25,715 --> 00:31:28,721
Well, you won't remember this,
but one night two years ago,

599
00:31:28,918 --> 00:31:32,002
you drove me to the hospital
after I had an attack of angina.

600
00:31:32,226 --> 00:31:34,113
Probably saved my life.

601
00:31:34,357 --> 00:31:36,583
Anyway, I figure
I owe ya. Here.

602
00:31:38,095 --> 00:31:40,110
You might wanna
wash that wrench off.

603
00:31:40,246 --> 00:31:41,841
It's got something on it.

604
00:31:47,927 --> 00:31:49,090
Sorry I'm late.

605
00:31:49,096 --> 00:31:51,182
Mrs. Prescott broke
a crown and...

606
00:31:53,665 --> 00:31:55,731
Orson, how well you look.

607
00:31:57,778 --> 00:31:58,691
Hello, mother.

608
00:32:00,275 --> 00:32:01,233
A word, darling?

609
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:09,231
I can't believe
you did this!

610
00:32:10,116 --> 00:32:13,301
And I can't believe you told me
that she was senile! You lied to me.

611
00:32:13,375 --> 00:32:17,020
Yes, to spare us the misery of her
company. You don't know her, Bree.

612
00:32:17,305 --> 00:32:20,082
She's a loathsome woman, and
I refuse to break bread with her.

613
00:32:20,337 --> 00:32:23,040
Now you listen to me.
That woman gave you life,

614
00:32:23,245 --> 00:32:26,072
and the Fifth Commandment tells us
to honor our parents no matter how

615
00:32:26,136 --> 00:32:27,720
hideous or repellent they may be.

616
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:30,602
-That's not exactly what...
-Orson, it's implied!

617
00:32:31,108 --> 00:32:33,560
Now get out there and
show her some respect!

618
00:32:33,996 --> 00:32:37,323
Fine, but if you expect anything
more from me than forced civility,

619
00:32:37,447 --> 00:32:39,220
you will be deeply disappointed.

620
00:32:44,847 --> 00:32:47,190
Bree, this salmon is superb.

621
00:32:47,196 --> 00:32:48,313
Well, thank you!

622
00:32:48,388 --> 00:32:51,193
It did win me the blue ribbon
at the gourmet county cookoff.

623
00:32:51,208 --> 00:32:52,843
I just love the sauce.

624
00:32:52,967 --> 00:32:54,113
What gives it that kick?

625
00:32:55,148 --> 00:32:57,820
You'd never ask a magician
how a trick is done.

626
00:33:00,035 --> 00:33:02,411
You've barely touched
your salmon, dear.

627
00:33:03,718 --> 00:33:04,922
Is everything okay?

628
00:33:05,446 --> 00:33:06,302
Yes.

629
00:33:07,427 --> 00:33:08,952
I was just wondering
why you're here.

630
00:33:11,386 --> 00:33:12,820
I want us to be friends.

631
00:33:13,198 --> 00:33:18,030
Okay, let's suppose I just had a
massive head injury and believe you.

632
00:33:18,047 --> 00:33:19,622
We're pals. Now
what do you want?

633
00:33:19,788 --> 00:33:22,682
Orson, why does she have
to have an ulterior motive?

634
00:33:26,215 --> 00:33:27,672
I want out of that home.

635
00:33:27,778 --> 00:33:29,182
Ah, there it is.

636
00:33:29,188 --> 00:33:32,530
It's a hellhole! Besides,
I'm perfectly healthy now.

637
00:33:32,767 --> 00:33:34,893
My hip is better,
I can handle the stairs,

638
00:33:35,056 --> 00:33:38,992
and you said when I got strong
enough I'd get to go back to my house.

639
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:42,133
Oh, here's the thing. I sold it.

640
00:33:43,416 --> 00:33:44,071
What?

641
00:33:45,818 --> 00:33:46,811
You heard me.

642
00:33:48,295 --> 00:33:50,043
What about my things?

643
00:33:50,568 --> 00:33:53,070
All gone.
Oh, I also sold the car.

644
00:33:53,175 --> 00:33:54,580
See, that's the thing
about hellholes.

645
00:33:54,585 --> 00:33:56,283
They don't pay
for themselves.

646
00:33:56,645 --> 00:34:00,041
How dare you?
You had no right!

647
00:34:00,416 --> 00:34:03,303
Okay! Maybe I will share
my secret ingredient.

648
00:34:03,627 --> 00:34:07,221
I should have smothered you in
your crib when I had the chance.

649
00:34:07,437 --> 00:34:09,450
Paprika! There, it's out!

650
00:34:10,147 --> 00:34:12,432
That's the mother I remember!

651
00:34:12,715 --> 00:34:14,881
I was wondering
when she'd show up.

652
00:34:15,747 --> 00:34:18,883
Yes, Orson,
I am your mother,

653
00:34:19,087 --> 00:34:23,112
so you more than anyone should
know how I deal with betrayal.

654
00:34:30,825 --> 00:34:31,833
So...

655
00:34:32,607 --> 00:34:34,083
Can we call her grandma?

656
00:34:43,045 --> 00:34:45,461
I've got one more load, and
then I'm gonna do my homework.

657
00:34:45,665 --> 00:34:47,392
Do you have anything you
want me to throw in?

658
00:34:47,595 --> 00:34:49,332
No, I'm good. Thanks.

659
00:34:55,187 --> 00:34:56,292
Mom, listen.

660
00:34:57,416 --> 00:34:59,952
I know I've put you through
the wringer lately, and...

661
00:35:00,476 --> 00:35:01,373
I'm sorry.

662
00:35:02,645 --> 00:35:04,380
16 years of being perfect.

663
00:35:04,695 --> 00:35:05,643
You were due.

664
00:35:06,965 --> 00:35:08,262
That's what I don't get.

665
00:35:09,015 --> 00:35:11,273
You've always
trusted my judgment.

666
00:35:11,828 --> 00:35:13,620
Why can't you trust
me about Austin?

667
00:35:16,268 --> 00:35:19,290
Relationships have nothing
to do with good judgment.

668
00:35:19,708 --> 00:35:21,582
It doesn't matter
how smart you are.

669
00:35:22,428 --> 00:35:23,811
You can still get hurt.

670
00:35:26,418 --> 00:35:28,702
You do your homework.
I'm gonna finish the laundry.

671
00:35:29,648 --> 00:35:30,383
Okay.

672
00:35:47,275 --> 00:35:48,930
There you go, Mrs. H.

673
00:35:49,995 --> 00:35:50,912
All right.

674
00:35:53,316 --> 00:35:55,460
-Can I use your bathroom, just...
-Come on in.

675
00:35:59,027 --> 00:36:01,603
Please, stay for dessert.

676
00:36:01,677 --> 00:36:04,033
I'll work on Orson, and
we'll discuss this together.

677
00:36:04,068 --> 00:36:06,010
You saw what he
sentenced me to...

678
00:36:06,138 --> 00:36:08,262
A room no better
than a furnished coffin.

679
00:36:09,105 --> 00:36:10,520
I have nothing
to say to him.

680
00:36:10,536 --> 00:36:11,982
Well, then talk to me.

681
00:36:12,226 --> 00:36:15,401
I know you're upset, but
don't shut me out. Please.

682
00:36:16,045 --> 00:36:18,720
Please, Gloria, let me in.

683
00:36:20,587 --> 00:36:23,611
Well, I didn't mean
it literally, but okay.

684
00:36:24,617 --> 00:36:27,182
We'll, um, we'll sit together.
And we'll talk.

685
00:36:27,196 --> 00:36:28,302
What are you doing?

686
00:36:28,668 --> 00:36:30,191
I'm not going
back to that place.

687
00:36:31,285 --> 00:36:32,730
Gloria, stop!

688
00:36:33,828 --> 00:36:35,540
Let's get my mother back
to the home, shall we?

689
00:36:36,415 --> 00:36:40,033
Not that it's any of my business, but,
is everything okay with you folks?

690
00:36:40,216 --> 00:36:43,522
Oh, yeah, there was a little tension
earlier, but I think it's all been resolved.

691
00:36:49,268 --> 00:36:51,600
Oh, what the hell?

692
00:36:58,237 --> 00:37:00,092
No, I absolutely forbid it!

693
00:37:00,108 --> 00:37:03,393
Just for a few weeks till we find
a place where she'll be happier.

694
00:37:04,166 --> 00:37:05,821
You should've heard
her in the car.

695
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:08,461
She's absolutely miserable
in that nursing home.

696
00:37:08,555 --> 00:37:09,350
I don't care.

697
00:37:09,945 --> 00:37:12,813
My mother's not moving in here
till she fits in a jar on the mantle.

698
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:14,762
How can you be so cold?

699
00:37:15,498 --> 00:37:16,901
You don't know who she is.

700
00:37:17,916 --> 00:37:20,433
I've worked my entire life to
get away from that woman.

701
00:37:20,657 --> 00:37:21,430
Why?

702
00:37:21,555 --> 00:37:24,650
What could she possibly have done
to make you hate her so much?

703
00:37:26,816 --> 00:37:29,492
Look, there is nothing to be
gained by dredging up the past.

704
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:33,123
Orson, if there's something
I should know.

705
00:37:34,217 --> 00:37:36,691
Could I speak to
my son a moment?

706
00:37:40,065 --> 00:37:41,001
Of course.

707
00:37:46,296 --> 00:37:47,502
So you know,

708
00:37:47,978 --> 00:37:50,980
I've decided to accept
your wife's kind invitation.

709
00:37:52,978 --> 00:37:54,033
I won't allow it.

710
00:37:54,126 --> 00:37:55,861
Oh, I think you will.

711
00:37:56,196 --> 00:37:58,481
We're going to end
our quarrel right now,

712
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:02,141
or I'll tell your
wife what it's about.

713
00:38:03,328 --> 00:38:04,393
You wouldn't.

714
00:38:05,088 --> 00:38:06,323
Just try me.

715
00:38:06,985 --> 00:38:08,191
I gave you life.

716
00:38:09,416 --> 00:38:11,842
You know I won't
hesitate to take it away.

717
00:38:21,338 --> 00:38:22,951
Now give mother a kiss.

718
00:38:24,106 --> 00:38:25,940
Why in the hell would
I wanna do that?

719
00:38:27,087 --> 00:38:28,410
To make it look real.

720
00:38:48,525 --> 00:38:49,713
Hey, you're back!

721
00:38:50,917 --> 00:38:52,582
I'd give you a hug,
but I'm really sweaty.

722
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:53,791
So how was New York?

723
00:38:54,015 --> 00:38:54,812
Oh, it was fine.

724
00:38:54,886 --> 00:38:56,523
Bree said you got
a job on the first day.

725
00:38:56,535 --> 00:38:58,520
You're such a star!
I want details.

726
00:38:59,845 --> 00:39:03,483
You know, just hours and hours
of sitting around, looking pretty.

727
00:39:03,876 --> 00:39:05,481
But I think I'm done
with modeling.

728
00:39:06,536 --> 00:39:07,990
So you're not gonna
move to New York?

729
00:39:08,035 --> 00:39:11,061
Well, if something great
comes up, I might fly out,

730
00:39:11,288 --> 00:39:13,390
but I'm pretty settled here.

731
00:39:13,715 --> 00:39:14,891
Oh, thank God!

732
00:39:15,026 --> 00:39:16,650
We were all so worried
we were losing you.

733
00:39:16,666 --> 00:39:18,051
Okay, now I'm hugging you.

734
00:39:21,596 --> 00:39:24,423
Oh, it's amazing.
Your life is such an adventure.

735
00:39:24,708 --> 00:39:26,320
Can't wait to see
what you do next.

736
00:39:27,967 --> 00:39:28,981
Yeah, me, too.

737
00:39:36,478 --> 00:39:37,021
Okay.

738
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:46,451
Mr. Protector Man?

739
00:39:46,466 --> 00:39:48,103
Shh! That's a secret.

740
00:39:48,417 --> 00:39:49,111
Hello?

741
00:39:50,326 --> 00:39:51,120
Hello?

742
00:39:55,716 --> 00:39:57,140
Ah, sweet!

743
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:02,340
Mom, look!

744
00:40:02,627 --> 00:40:04,263
Hey, don't touch anything.

745
00:40:04,267 --> 00:40:07,392
I'm just gonna write a
note, and then we'll go.

746
00:40:08,976 --> 00:40:09,750
Okay.

747
00:40:12,826 --> 00:40:14,462
Parker? Hey!

748
00:40:15,585 --> 00:40:16,690
Come back here!

749
00:40:18,338 --> 00:40:19,151
Honey?

750
00:40:19,506 --> 00:40:20,762
Come on, we're leaving.

751
00:40:22,208 --> 00:40:23,060
Parker.

752
00:40:24,716 --> 00:40:26,450
Parker, come on,
we're leaving.

753
00:40:27,355 --> 00:40:29,732
Why didn't you come
when I called?

754
00:40:35,168 --> 00:40:37,101
Superhero houses are great!

755
00:41:13,708 --> 00:41:16,472
Parker, come on, we're
gonna get out of here.

756
00:41:16,485 --> 00:41:18,473
-Why?
-Oh, I just say so. Come on.

757
00:41:24,765 --> 00:41:28,912
There are so many things we
wish we could tell the young.

758
00:41:30,725 --> 00:41:34,573
We'd like to persuade them
not to grow up so fast,

759
00:41:35,907 --> 00:41:37,443
but they won't listen.

760
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:42,253
We want to tell them
that beauty fades,

761
00:41:44,175 --> 00:41:46,400
but they refuse to believe it.

762
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:52,132
We warn them that their
actions will have consequences,

763
00:41:53,976 --> 00:41:56,250
but still they defy us.

764
00:41:57,678 --> 00:42:03,201
Sadly, the young can't begin to understand
the world is a dangerous place.

765
00:42:04,156 --> 00:42:08,730
So it's up to us to do anything
we can to protect them...

766
00:42:10,105 --> 00:42:12,891
What if I told you there is a
way you could help children...

767
00:42:13,895 --> 00:42:16,470
Absolutely anything.
