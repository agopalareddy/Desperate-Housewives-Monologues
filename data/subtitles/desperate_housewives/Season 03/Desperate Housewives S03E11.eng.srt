00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,300
Previously on Desperate Housewives

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,010
I will love her like she is my own.

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:07,920
Lynette made a promise...

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:10,950
his wife goes missing,and his mistress turns up dead?

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,350
I just can't believe that orson could do such a thing.

6
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:14,470
Mike got arrested...

7
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:15,200
oh,thank god!

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,910
And a friendship hit the rocks.

9
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:20,720
I am not playing with a woman that is willing
to let mike take the fall for her psycho husband.

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,050
Susan made a deal...

11
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,690
I'll hire the best lawyer in town on one condition--

12
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,290
you can't see him anymore.

13
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:28,000
And a missing wife returned.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,450
Hello,alma.

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,060
to understand the journey of alma hodge,

16
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,920
you first need to know how it started.

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,160
It began the day she wed orson hodge,

18
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,630
a man she had tricked into marriage by getting pregnant.

19
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,200
Alma was confident that as their family grew,

20
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,290
orson's feelings for her would grow as well.

21
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,630
But then something went wrong,

22
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:04,010
and the baby she had been counting on never came.

23
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:10,650
So alma found herself married
to a man who seemed to despise her.

24
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,210
Still,alma hoped things would get better...

25
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,100
mama loves her baby.

26
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,810
Es the baby love mama?

27
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:25,750
Until the day she discovered orson was having an affair.

28
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:31,650
And alma realized the only way she'd ever
get her husband to appreciate her

29
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,250
was to leave him...

30
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,330
immediately.

31
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,910
if you don't get back in your cage right now,

32
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,520
I'm gonna have to leave you behind.
Please!

33
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,010
going somewhere?

34
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,870
I'm staying at a motel tonight.

35
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:20,770
Why?

36
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:23,590
I don't have time to discuss it.
I'm late for the bus.

37
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:26,790
All right.

38
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,580
I'm going away because...

39
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,320
I know you're having an affair.

40
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,210
Ah.
I see.

41
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,530
Aren't you even gonna deny it?

44
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:56,250
How can you say that to me?
I'm your wife!

45
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,230
We both know why we got married,

46
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,680
and it had nothing to do with affection.

47
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,690
So you don't care if I go?

48
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,180
No.

49
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:14,560
Wait!

50
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,880
This isn't what's supposed to happen!
You should be begging me to stay with you.

51
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,740
I deserve to be happy,alma.
So do you.

52
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,730
And we're clearly not gonna find that together.

53
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,580
Orson,no!

54
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:29,620
It was at that moment alma realized

55
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,660
it wasn't enough to leave her husband.

56
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,270
He had to be punished.

57
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:41,330
Yes,this was the journey of alma hodge...

58
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,570
bree hodge?
I'm alma hodge.

59
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,170
I believe we have someone in common.

60
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:54,280
and it wasn't over yet.

Season 03 Episode 11</font>

64
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,880
There is a time of day all housewives look forward to.

65
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,510
It occurs just after the chores have been completed

66
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:49,360
and right before the children come home from school.

67
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:54,660
It's a time for good friends to get together,

68
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:59,300
have a cup of coffee and exchange gossip

69
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,990
aboutthe other good friends who couldn't make it that day.

70
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,500
Bree letrson move back in.

71
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,890
- You're kidding.When?
- Yesterday.

72
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,040
I'm so disappointed in her.

73
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,250
Well,the police did arrest mike.

74
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:17,450
I mean,I know you think he's innocent,
but surely you can understand why bree's feelings have changed.

75
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:21,770
Well,mine haven't,
and I know something that bree probably doesn'T.

76
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:30,950
When orson was 17,he spent time in a mental institution.

77
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,170
How did you find that out?

78
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:36,160
I snuck into his office and rifled through his things.

79
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:38,340
Of course you did.

80
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,340
But that doesn't prove he had anything
to do with monique's murder.

81
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,240
No,but it's a piece of the puzzle.

82
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,890
I mean,he did have an affair with her.

83
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:49,280
And when you combine that with
the fact that his first wife went missing...

84
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,550
so you're alma.

85
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,580
Where have you been all this time?

86
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,550
In canada.
My aunt lives there.

87
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:03,000
Well,you should've told someone.
People thought you were dead.

88
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,130
Some even thought that orson killed you.

89
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:08,480
Well,that's sort of what I wanted them to think.

90
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,320
That's why I left my bird behind and only took cash,

91
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,440
so they couldn't trace me through my credit cards.

92
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,760
So you deliberately framed orson?

93
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,140
I'm not saying it was my finest hour.

94
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,000
But you have to understand,orson hurt me very badly.

95
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,220
- He cheated on me.
- Yes,I know--

96
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,890
with monique polier.

97
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:29,670
And I thought,if I disappeared,

98
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:33,340
she'd get scared and leave him,like he left me.

99
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,450
Isn't jealousy awful?

100
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,210
So why have you come back?

101
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,590
I found this fantastic therapist.

102
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:43,110
He told me that by holding on to my anger

103
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,540
I was really just hurting myself,which was hard to deny.

104
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:49,790
I mean,hello,I'm here in winnipeg
with a deaf aunt and no credit.

105
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,410
So I thought,it's time to make amends.

106
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,760
Darling?

107
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,350
Mrs. Mclean canceled,so...

108
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,790
I'm free for lunch.

109
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:04,530
Um,actually,we have a guest.

110
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,500
hello,orson.

111
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,490
Oh,hello...

112
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:12,700
so...
what is it with you and redheads?

113
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:22,060
I-I hope you don't mind me springing this picnic on you.

114
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,410
I figured it'd be more fun than some stuffy restaurant.

115
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,840
Are you kidding?

116
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,290
What could be more romantic?

117
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,620
Back off,you son of a bitch!

118
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,380
more wine?

119
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:34,580
Yes,keep it coming.

120
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:36,960
hello?

121
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,060
hey,who's the dork?

122
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,970
- Carlos?
- What's with that cap?

123
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,330
extra,extra,read all about it!

124
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,050
Where the hell are you?

125
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,870
What are you doing at mike's house?

126
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:55,940
I live here.

127
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,770
What do you mean you live there?
Since when?

128
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:01,990
Gaby,my car's been in the driveway for three weeks.
Even you can't be that self-absorbed.

129
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:08,050
Well,as you can see,
I have more pleasant things to focus on.

130
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:12,480
So when you gonna tell jimmy olsen
there that you hate picnics?

131
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,860
I'm gonna hang up noW.

132
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,150
So where were we?

133
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:21,770
Your ex-husband moved in across the street?

134
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,680
What's that gonna be like?

135
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:28,600
- yeah?!
- Are you gonna kiss him?

136
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,490
That's right,carlos.

137
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:34,780
We have had some pblems with raccoons
getting into the trash.

138
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,750
So why don't you just put a lid on it?

139
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,400
Okay,they're here.
Now listen,stand up.

140
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,170
Kayla has been through a lot,
so when she walks in the door,

141
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:52,960
I want you to make her feel welcome,okay?
Give her a hug and be really nice.

142
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,240
I'm giving her my room.
How much nicer do I have to be?

143
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,010
Well,nicer than that,
or she's gonna get alyour toys,too.

144
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,130
- hey,hey,hey!
- Hi!

145
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:04,440
Look who I found wandering around the airport.

146
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,510
Hi,kayla! We missed you!
We're so glad you're here.

147
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,260
okay,boys.

148
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,820
Good.Yeah,okay.
So give her some room.

149
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,900
Hey,wow,look,are those presents for kayla?

150
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,240
Yes,they are.

151
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,650
Hey,look at that.Preston gave you a harmonica.
Isn't that cool?

152
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:36,860
Oh."Harriet the spy.¡± Sounds mysterious.

153
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,510
Thanks.

154
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,190
And what did you get for her,porter?

155
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:47,750
A video game,but I get to play it whenever I want.

156
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,460
Porter!

157
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:54,530
I-- you know what?
I got you something,too.

158
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:56,770
This...

159
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:58,920
is nellie.

160
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:02,700
My grandma gave her to me when I was little,

161
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,840
and I was hoping you could take care of her for me.

162
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,270
Thanks.

163
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:15,630
Hey,honey,why don't you take
your stuff and go upstairs and,

164
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,010
uh,get ready for lunch,okay?
I'm gonna ma some chili.

165
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:19,780
- Okay,daddy.
- Okay,baby.

166
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,340
HoneY...

167
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:27,940
that was so sweet...
to give her your doll.

168
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,620
She didn't seem that knocked out by it.

169
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,820
Well,just give her some time.
She'll--

170
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,930
she'll come around.
It's a tough adjustment.

171
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,170
Okay.

172
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:51,120
I must say,bree,I don't know when
I've tasted such moist pound cake.

173
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,060
Sour cream.

174
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:04,050
So whatever happened to my parrot?

175
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,610
I set it free.

176
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,590
Orson,they don't fair well in the wild.
You should've--

177
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:13,590
,for god sake,alma,who cares about the damn bird?

178
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,760
You set me up.

179
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:20,040
Why don't I wrap up a piece of
this pound cake for you to enjoy later?

180
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:26,850
Do you have any idea what you put me through?
You almost ruined my life.

181
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,420
You've rebounded nicely.
Bree's lovely.

182
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,810
Don't change the subject.

183
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:34,680
You put me through a lot,too,orson,but I forgave you.

184
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,070
Can't we just put this behind us?

185
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,980
And that's all you've come back for--

186
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,990
- closure?
- Of course.

187
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,940
What else?

188
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,890
I'm out of lipstick.
Can I borrow yours?

189
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,010
Sure.

190
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,400
Cherry berry?

191
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,990
austin likes the way it tastes.

192
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:56,510
Oh,i so did not need to know that.

193
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,590
So,um,where you going?

194
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,910
Down to the jailhouse to talk to mike.

195
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:04,310
But didn't you tell ian you wouldn't see him anymore?

196
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:07,590
Yeah.
But somebody's gotta tell him about his new lawyer.

197
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:10,810
Otherwise,the guy's gonna show up,and he's gonna go,
"who the hell is he?¡±

198
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,710
ian gets that.

199
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,520
besides...

200
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,290
why would it be a big deal?
Mike and I are over.

201
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,270
I was just wondering,'cause,

202
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:24,110
you know,you're putting on lipstick to go to a prison.

203
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,220
Thank you for clearing things up.

204
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:33,010
Oh,well,it was the least I could do.

205
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:37,430
Orson,I'm truly sorry for the pain I've caused,

206
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:39,880
and if there's anything else I can do...

207
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:44,290
actually,there is.

208
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:46,970
I'd love it if you could join us for dinner this weekend.

209
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:49,240
There are some friends that I'm just...

210
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,870
dying for you to meet.

211
00:12:58,570 --> 00:12:59,630
you got me a lawyer?

212
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,980
Yeah,and he is fantastic.

213
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,860
You cannot believe the scum he has gotten off.

214
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,960
Not that you're scum.

215
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,570
But,you know,if you were,you'd be sitting pretty.

216
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:13,460
I'm paying you back--
every penny.

217
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,710
Oh,well,you know,we'll figure that out later.

218
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:20,990
I-I can't believe that I just
listened to all that stuff edie told me about you,

219
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:24,490
and it turns out you're the only one standing by me.

220
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:28,400
You're a good friend,susan.

221
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:33,230
Um,yeah,about that...

222
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,270
it's ian.

223
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:38,590
He's not crazy about me spending time with my ex.

224
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:41,800
Even an ex who doesn't remember dating you?

225
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,390
I remember,and I guess that's enough for him.

226
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,840
I'm sorry.

227
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:56,900
Well,I,uh,can't say that I blame him.

228
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,500
Take care of yourself,mike.

229
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,610
You,too,susan.

230
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,730
dinner's ready.

231
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,890
Kayla,I made your favorite--

232
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:24,550
tacos.

233
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,470
here you go.

234
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,370
But where's my daddy?

235
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,680
Oh,sorry,sweetheart.
He's working late,trying to get the restaurant ready.

236
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:37,680
Oh,lovely,parker.
Go wash your hands.Go on.

237
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:41,380
Kayla,where you going?

238
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,420
To watch tv.

239
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,290
Oh,sweetie,we don't watch tv during dinner.

240
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,940
But my show is on.

241
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,490
Well,I'm sorry.
Those are the rules.

242
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,390
My mommy let me.

243
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:55,730
Well...

244
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:00,210
just this once.

245
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,630
Okay,okay,I know what you're thinking,but...

246
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,710
kayla's going through a hard time right now.
Come and sit down.

247
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:18,920
Letting her watch tv is like me letting
you eat ice cream when you're sick.

248
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,940
But she's not sick.

249
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,730
Well,that's true,but she's sad.

250
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,970
I'm sad I n't watch tv.

251
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:29,210
eat your tacos.

252
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:40,070
Whoa,whoa,whoa!
Sit your butts down!

253
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,330
It's not fair.

254
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:43,760
I don't care.
We have rules.

255
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,010
Well,she gets to.

256
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:47,360
She is special.
Now sit down.

257
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,810
Come on.

258
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:54,420
- does she get dessert,too?
- Of course I do.

259
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,030
what an amazing documentary,huh?

260
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:06,010
Yoknow,I read the director shot over 400 hours of film.

261
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:08,230
Really?
I only counted half that.

262
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:12,340
I get it.
You pick the next one.

263
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,600
Okay.

264
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,370
look at you!
Who knew you were such a romantic?

265
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,880
Actually,I...
I didn't send them.

266
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,070
You didn't?

267
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,950
So,uh,who's making me look bad?

268
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:37,030
Uh,there's no signature.

269
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:40,310
sorry.
This is kind of awkward.

270
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:44,210
No,I-I don't care who worships you from afar,

271
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,460
as long as I get to do it up close.

272
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:53,550
that's sweet that you're not...
jealous.

273
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,000
Carlos would've hit the roof if some guy sent me...

274
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,880
would you excuse me a minute?

275
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:18,220
- Nice try,carlos.
- Huh?

276
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:21,070
Oh,don't act innocent.
You know you sent me these flowers.

277
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,130
why would I get you flowers?

278
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:27,610
To sabotage my new relationship.

279
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,930
Oh,with picnic boy?
What do I care if you go out with him?

280
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:34,920
Oh,you care.
First,you move across the street.

281
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,200
And then,earlier today,I catch you spying on me--

282
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,710
I was not spying.
I was mocking you.

283
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,010
- You need to move on,carlos.
- I have moved on!

284
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,050
You're the one talking to your ex during the middle of a date.

285
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,570
Is he that boring?

286
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:48,990
Bill is not boring.

287
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:51,900
He is vibrant...

288
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:54,720
And--
and sexy.

289
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,580
And yet here you are.

290
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,760
she threw your doll in the trash?

291
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:29,370
No.

292
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:32,820
First,she ripped off its arms,stuffed it with ili.

293
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,460
Then she threw it in the trash.

294
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,440
So what did you do?

295
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,200
Nothing.

296
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:42,960
And this is after you let her watch tv during dinner?

297
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,820
Well,I didn't know what else to do.

298
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:49,650
I'm trying to win over a little girl
who clearly doesn't want a new mother.

299
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:54,410
Well,I guess giving her special treatment
isn't gonna lve anything.

300
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:58,300
You know what might solve something?

301
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:03,210
If you were home once in a while.
You're the one she listens to.

302
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:07,370
I am trying to open up a restaurant.
Our life savings is riding on this thing.

303
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:09,380
I know,I know.
I know.

304
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,500
You know what?

305
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,100
I don't want you to be afraid to take a firm hand with kayla.

306
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,710
She's part of our family now,and...

307
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,470
you know what that means.

308
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,650
Yeah.

309
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:24,970
I should treat her as badly as I treat my own children.

310
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,680
Exactly.

311
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,040
sorry.
Um...

312
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:44,080
I'm not sure I'M...
ready for that yet.

313
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,180
That's cool.

314
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,890
You can't blame me for trying,though.

315
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:54,570
Austin,you know I want to.
It's just...

316
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,740
hey,don't sweat it.

317
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,150
All right,if you're not ready,you're not ready.

318
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,530
So he didn't pressure you at all?
What a great guy.

319
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:12,320
I know.I'm so lucky.
Underneath all that bad boy posturing,he'S...

320
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,550
a real gentleman.

321
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,710
Wow,you're not only virgin.
You think like one.

322
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:19,950
Beat it,eavesdropper.

323
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,160
No,wait.
Um...

324
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:23,820
what did you mean by that?

325
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,500
Well,uh...

326
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,880
guys need sex.All right?
It's basic science.

327
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,830
So if he's not getting it from you,
he'll end up getting it somewhere else.

328
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:36,300
You're a moron.
Not all guys pressure girls for sex.

329
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,250
Yeah,gay guys don'T.

330
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,730
But austin's not gay,not even after three beers.

331
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,430
don't ask.

332
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:48,830
So what's your point?

333
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:52,730
If a guy has to wait too long to see you naked,

334
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:55,610
he'll end up seeing you as a friend.

335
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,000
Again...
science.

336
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:02,310
Don't listen to him.
You hold on to your virginity.

337
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:05,090
If austin won't wait,then he doesn't deserve you.

338
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,360
I just don't wanna lose him.

339
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,830
It's better than ling your self-respect.

340
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:13,490
Take it from a girl who's known at school as
"little miss van de tramp.¡±

341
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,990
I thought you made that up.

342
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:19,000
Only 'cause it was nicer than the other
names they were calling me.

343
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:27,480
I really appreciateyou donating this stuff.

344
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,190
Anything for a good cause.

345
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:31,550
Everyone at the shelter's gonna be so excited.

346
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:32,300
Yeah.

347
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,960
I mean,to you and me,these are just a bunch of old clothes.
But to a homeless woman...

348
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:39,970
It's a chance r her to feel pretty again.

349
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,870
You okay?

350
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,620
- What?
- I asked if you're okay.

351
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:47,060
You seem kind of distracted.

352
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,660
I...
am fine.

353
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:52,790
Yes,I just remembered today's my mother's birthday.

354
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:56,180
can we stop by the florist on the way to the shelter?

355
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,410
Yeah.

356
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,670
Detective ridley,my name is susan mayer,

357
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:08,280
and I'm calling to "drop a dime" on someone.
That's the expression,right?

358
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:11,890
Yes,ma'am.
You've got the lingo down pat.

359
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:13,430
Good.
Uh...

360
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:19,880
his name is orson hodge,and he had an affair
with the woman that you think mike delfino killed.

361
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:23,510
Monique polier?
Are you sure? Because...

362
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:27,010
Mr. Hodge saw her body in the morgue.
He acted like he didn't know her.

363
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:31,180
Well,he does,and so he's pretending he didn'T.
That's suspicious,right?

364
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,010
Well,um.

365
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:35,220
oh,uh,can you hold on?

366
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,540
Hello?

367
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,430
Susan.Hi.
It's bree.

368
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:41,020
Bree?Uh...
hi.

369
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:43,170
Can you hold on a second?

370
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,600
It's orson's wife.
She can't know I called you.

371
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,180
Then how about you don't tell her?

372
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,470
Right.

373
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,860
Sorry.Uh,

374
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:54,250
I'm just new to this whole snitch thing.
Hold on,okay?

375
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,840
Bree, hi.

376
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,620
Sorry about that.Damn telemarketer.

377
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,870
So what can I do for you?

378
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:04,180
I just feel really awful about our fight,

379
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,840
and I-I think it's time for an apology.

380
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,590
Bree, I am so relieved.

381
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:14,880
Would you join orson and me for
dinner tomorrow night?

382
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,620
Oh, uh...sure.

383
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:21,090
Good. I'll see you at 8:00.

384
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:22,220
Bree...

385
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,370
I just want you to know that no matter what,

386
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:28,050
your friendship means the world to me.

387
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:30,440
Oh, susan, you know,I feel exactly--

388
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,550
it's me again.

389
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:35,930
You should also know that
orson spent a year in an asylum.

390
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,940
hi. Can I help you?

391
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:46,490
Hi. I received some flowers
from your shop yesterday

392
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,300
and the card didn't say who they were from.

393
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,540
Can you check The name is solis.

394
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:53,040
Sure, sure.Just give me a sec here.

395
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,070
Solis?

396
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,090
Yeah.

397
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:00,200
Solis... solis...

398
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,860
huh. This is odd.

399
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,530
The buyer asked to remain anonymous.

400
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:08,230
Really? Uh, well,the flowers were so beautiful,

401
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,780
I'd like to know who to thank.

402
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,640
Sorry. I have to honor their request.

403
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:14,910
Why? They're just flowers.

404
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,370
They're not government secrets.

405
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,460
If you don't mind,I'm busy.

406
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,310
Well, okay, wait, wait, wait,let me explain.

407
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:23,870
What's to explain?

408
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,480
A pretty girl gets flowers.

409
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,300
Do you know how many girls never get flowers?

410
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:29,620
I work in a flower shop.

411
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,770
I've never gotten anfreakin' flowers!

412
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:36,360
So stop your whining about
who sent them and just be glad he did.

413
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:48,670
you're right,and I am so sorry for
taking up so much of your time.

414
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:51,480
Sorry for doing this.

415
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,280
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

416
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,000
hey, hey, hey!

417
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:57,870
I'm gonna make it up to you, okay?

418
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,960
Once I'm done, I'll send you flowers.

419
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:11,460
Hey! You won't get away with is!

420
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,090
I know where you live!

421
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:15,120
Yeah? Well, stop by.We'll hot tub.

422
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:19,230
Hey, mister, help!

423
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,880
She locked me in here!

424
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,930
Gaby?

425
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:27,090
This is totally her fault.

426
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:30,140
I mean, I simply asked her
if carlos sent me the flowers,

427
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,300
and she refused to show me the order slip.

428
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:33,760
Are you still hung up on that?

429
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,430
For god sake.

430
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,170
No, no, no!Wait, wait, wait.

431
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:38,310
I just need a couple more minutes.
I need to know the truth.

432
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:40,160
What truth is that, huh?

433
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:42,110
That you're still obsessed with your ex-husband?

434
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:45,160
What?!No, he's obsessed with me.

435
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:49,670
You just imprisoned a florist to
find out if he sent you roses.

436
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:57,310
Okay, I see what you mean.

437
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,620
there. I'm done.

438
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:01,910
Let's go.

439
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:03,050
Actually...

440
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:06,140
I think I'm done, too.

441
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,060
I'm sorry.

442
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,390
It's okay.

443
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:22,530
I'm probably not ready to date.

444
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:34,020
thanks.

445
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:38,170
And just so you know,i am ready to date.

446
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,770
All right, let's hit it.

447
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:46,170
Now come on, kayla.

448
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,800
I haven't finished my ice cream.

449
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:50,900
Well, I'm sorry,but we gotta go.
I have a dinner party I have to get to.

450
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:53,190
They got to finish their ice cream.

451
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:58,080
Well, they, you know,wolfed it down
like kids are supposed to.

452
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,180
So... hurry it up.

453
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:09,340
kayla,I'm not fooling around.

454
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,930
We--we're going.

455
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,440
Mm-hmm. Okay.

456
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:17,560
Boys, go to the car.

457
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,260
I'll be out in a minute. Go.

458
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:28,940
Listen, sweetheart, I don't blame you for being angry.

459
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,730
Your mom's gone,and you're stuck with me.

460
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,550
But...

461
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:43,130
the last thing she said to me was,

462
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:46,870
"promise you'll take care of kayla,"
and I am going to.

463
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,960
But you're gonna have to help me, okay?

464
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,270
We can leave when I'm done.

465
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,750
Okay, let's go.

466
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,730
hey, whoa!Whoa, whoa, whoa! Okay.

467
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:09,940
What the hell are you doing?!

468
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:11,870
Stop, stop! Stop screaming!Stop!

469
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,940
Leave me alone!

470
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:15,580
You're not my mommy!

471
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:49,060
guys, how would you like to eat dinner
in front of the television for a whole week?

472
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:59,530
What are you guys doing here?

473
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:04,270
kayla, stop screaming!

474
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,480
You're hurting my ears!

475
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,040
Get in the car!

476
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:09,890
Come on!We're going home!

477
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,540
Get your seat belt on!

478
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:15,290
Kids--they're always rough housing.

479
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:36,990
why'd you stop?

480
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:40,000
Well, uh, it's getting late.

481
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,890
I got your blouse unbuttoned.

482
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:43,970
That's usually when we call it a night.

483
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,580
Do you wanna call it a night?

484
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:50,410
What, do you wanna grab a pizza or something?

485
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,940
I wanna do what...you wanna do.

486
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:06,250
Well...you know what I wanna do.

487
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,690
Well, okay.

488
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:12,220
Are you sure?

489
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:15,140
Yeah, I'm sure.

490
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:38,960
you can always spot the new guys
by the way they pick through their food.

491
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,730
So what did you do when you thought
no one was looking?

492
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:47,840
The cops say I killed a woman.

493
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,730
But you didn't, right?

494
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:54,250
Actually, I have no idea.

495
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:57,940
I got pretty banged up in an accide.

496
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,710
The last two years are a blank.

497
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:04,290
Well...that's a fresh approach.

498
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,910
I'm not sure the jury's gonna swallow it.

499
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,390
It's the truth.

500
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,850
I believe you.

501
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:22,050
Okay, mrS. Mccluskey's downstairs,and
we will be right across the street if you need us.

502
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,430
Okay, daddy.

503
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:28,320
You know, I heard what happened with lynette today.

504
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,510
Hey, she's doing her best.

505
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,250
Why you being so hard on her?

506
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,780
'Cause it's her fault my mommy died.

507
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,960
No. No, no, honey.It's not.

508
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:41,140
Mom only went to that store because
lynette was trying to steal me.

509
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,100
Okay, that is not true.

510
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:47,540
Look, honey, it is way more complicated than that.

511
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:53,090
I know you miss your mommy
and she loved you very much.

512
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:55,250
But guess what?

513
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:58,500
Lynette loves you, too.

514
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,250
That's why you gotta give her a chance.

515
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,840
Can you do that for me?

516
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,340
Okay. I'll be good.

517
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:11,800
That's my girl.

518
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:14,980
But I'm never gonna love her...

519
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:18,470
and you can't make me.

520
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,100
Well, you've won.

521
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:36,150
What did I win?

522
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,150
Bill and I split up.

523
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,000
Can't say I'm surprised.

524
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:46,110
He wasn't right for you.

525
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,740
I know.

526
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:51,440
So just admit you sent the flowers.

527
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,460
I didn'T.

528
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:56,590
Carlos, just tell me.

529
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,560
I won't be mad.I promise.

530
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,120
Gaby, if I was gonna send you flowers,

531
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:03,030
I wouldn't send you pink roses.

532
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,680
I'd send you white orchids,

533
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,090
because I know they're your favorite.

534
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:12,530
And if I wanted to cheer you up--sunflowers.

535
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:14,510
And for the flu...

536
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,600
blue irises.

537
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,720
I hate that you know me so well,

538
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,290
and it took so long for that to happen.

539
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:36,840
Now I have to start over again with somebody else.

540
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,490
Yeah.

541
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,170
That's what dating's for.

542
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:42,100
I know, and it sucks.

543
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:46,030
I mean, you saw me.I went on a picnic
and ate pudding out of a can.

544
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:47,680
It was horrible.

545
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,290
well, if it makes you feel any better,

546
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,710
I dragged to the ballet the other night.

547
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:57,200
So you are dating.

548
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:01,500
That's why you've been lifting weights and jogging.

549
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,770
Well, if you wanna bag the big game,
gotta work on the guns.

550
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:13,700
I'll give you this--

551
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:18,000
you're gonna be a tough act to follow, carlos.

552
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:25,210
Back at yard, babe.

553
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:43,020
I'm so sorry to keep you waiting,

554
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,790
but I don't want to introduce
you until all my guests are here.

555
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:47,250
I don't mind.

556
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:52,940
By the way, when my friends ask you what happened--

557
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,260
and they will--

558
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,000
I don't think it's necessary to go into all that

559
00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:00,170
unpleasantness about orson and monique.

560
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:03,810
All they need to know is that
you're back and we're on good terms.

561
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:06,280
And orson didn't kill me.

562
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:09,250
And orson didn't kill you.

563
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:13,980
oh, okay, just one minute.That'll be susan.

564
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,120
Hi. I brought you a bundt cake.

565
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,940
Don't worry.I didn't make it.

566
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:42,490
Oh, you didn't have to do that.

567
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:43,830
I was really touched by your call.

568
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:45,230
It was so big of you.

569
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:48,290
Well, when you're wrong,you're wrong.

570
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:55,210
Now that we're all assembled,
I'd like to introduce the guest of honor.

571
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,820
I hope you'll all be as delighted
to meet her as I was.

572
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:01,080
You can come in now.

573
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:10,200
Everyone,this is alma hodge,orson's first wife.

574
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:16,580
Oh, about that apology...

575
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:18,410
any time you're ready.

576
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:23,630
So you have been in canada this entire time?

577
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:26,520
Well, my aunt agnes has a place in winnipeg.

578
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:28,260
I hadn't planned on staying slong,

579
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:30,710
but I needed the time to find myself.

580
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:32,680
It would've been nice if someone
else could've found you.

581
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:34,470
There was a whole lot of drama around here.

582
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:35,610
Yes, I heard.

583
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:38,500
People actually thought orson had done away with me?

584
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:43,270
amazing, isn't it,where some people's minds will go?

585
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,280
Well, you gotta hand it to her.

586
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:51,260
Just when u think bree's thrown
every conceivable theme party

587
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:54,580
she hosts a "shame on you for
thinking my husband killed someone" dinner.

588
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:57,020
So alma's alive. Big deal.

589
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:59,360
We still don't know what went down
between orson and monique.

590
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,140
susan, please. We look stupid enough for suspecting him.

591
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,200
Just let it go.

592
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:09,670
It may be a little late for that.

593
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,720
Detective ridley.

594
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:13,120
Can I help you?

595
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,070
Yes. I'd like to speak to your husband.

596
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:18,430
Oh, well,I'm afraid he's not here,

597
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,190
but I will be happy to tell him that you came by.

598
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,870
who is it, darling?

599
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:28,310
excuse us.

600
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,670
Can't this wait?We're having a dinner party.

601
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,400
hello, dr. Hodge.

602
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,790
Detective ridley.

603
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:39,440
We need you to come with us.

604
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:42,660
We have some questions about that jane doe
we showed you in the morgue.

605
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:45,490
Why do you think I'd know anything about her?

606
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:48,910
Well, you were having an affair
with her when she died.

607
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:52,390
Oh, where did you hear that?

608
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,590
Susan?

609
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:02,300
I didn't know they were gonna come tonight.

610
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:08,080
Uh, I'm happy to answer any questions
that you might have.

611
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:10,010
My apologies. Please, stay.

612
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:11,900
Enjoy the dessert.

613
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:17,300
I don't believe this.

614
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:19,070
You called the police?

615
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:20,990
Well, obviously,you weren't going to.

616
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:24,120
They needed to know that that
dead woman was orson's mistress.

617
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,990
I told you that in confidence.

618
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:30,040
Did you seriously think I could sit on information
that would exonerate mike?

619
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:33,140
I mean, if you had seen his face
in jail the other day...

620
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:35,460
the other day?You--you saw mike?

621
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:39,120
Yeah. I--just to tell him about the lawyer.

622
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:41,840
I know that mike is innocent.

623
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:44,220
Right, just like you knew she was dead.

624
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,270
I thought we had an agreement.

625
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:50,100
We do. Can we talk about this later?

626
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:51,200
When?

627
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,400
After your next conjugal visit?

628
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:55,650
Ian. Wait!

629
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,750
Boy, when it comes to mike
there's no one you won't betray.

630
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:00,470
Excuse me?

631
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:02,060
Hey, guys...

632
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,620
please leave my house.

633
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:04,450
Bree!

634
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,890
You heard me. Get out!

635
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:07,950
Okay, bree,I know you're angry,

636
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:09,320
but for the sake of our friendship--

637
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:13,030
oh, make no mistake,our friendship is over.

638
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,790
- Okay. You go...
- okay.

639
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:34,180
So, winnipeg...must get pretty cold up there.

640
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:39,750
I'm just getting my coat.

641
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:42,130
Ian, please, I just lost one of my best friends.

642
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:43,190
I can't lose you, too.

643
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:45,070
You said that you wouldn't see him again.

644
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:49,070
But you had to know that I would go
one more time to just explain everything.

645
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:50,360
Actually, no, I didn'T.

646
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:51,800
Well, that's just crazy!

647
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,920
Why are you acting like a crazy person?

648
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:56,610
Because you've already left me once for this--this guy!

649
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:59,180
Things are different now!
I-I love you!

650
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,700
You--you don't have to worry about that anymore.

651
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:04,040
If we're gonna make this relationship work

652
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:07,550
then you have to trust me
and why are you smiling at me?

653
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:09,480
You just said that you love me.

654
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,740
Yeah? So?

655
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,570
Well, you've never said that before.

656
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:13,750
Yes, I have.

657
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,300
No. I-I-I would've remembered.

658
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,200
Well, I'm saying it now.I love you.

659
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:18,520
Do you have a problem with that?

660
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,600
No, ma'am.

661
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,170
You--you--you can't kiss me now.

662
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:22,000
I'm yelling at you.

663
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,100
Well, I'm listening.

664
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:26,240
Well...don't--don't think that
you can get out of this,

665
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:30,840
you know, by just...oh, god. Oh, yeah, uh,

666
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:33,110
oh, yeah, right--right there.Oh, right there.

667
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:39,700
look, I think we should stop doing thiS.

668
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:45,890
I know it's my idea,but it just
doesn't feel right anymore.

669
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:50,130
So you slept with julie.It's no big deal.

670
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,310
Well, it is to her
and I don't want to see her get hurt.

671
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:54,750
Me, either.

672
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,080
so let's just not tell her.

673
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:07,430
there's no place in fair view
that's more peaceful.

674
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:09,510
All the floors are hardwood.

675
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:11,790
Oh, there are brand-new appliances.

676
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:13,420
And the gardens are...

677
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:15,020
well, they're beautiful.

678
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:18,590
So... what do you think?

679
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:22,470
I'll take it.

680
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:23,830
Really?

681
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:25,830
that's terrific!

682
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:27,820
I'll draw up the papers in the morning.

683
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:34,280
If you don't mind me asking,

684
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:37,760
why were you so interested in this particular street?

685
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:40,910
I've been moving around a lot in the last few months,

686
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:44,040
and I need a place where I can really settle down.

687
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,370
You know what I mean?

688
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:49,510
I wanna live in a place
where children know how to behave,

689
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:54,010
where people still have some sense of moral value,

690
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:59,990
and where friendships are good
and strong and last forever.

691
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:03,490
That's what I'm looking for.

692
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:07,570
Then I think wisteria lane is the place for you.

693
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,330
Good.

694
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:12,530
More than anything,I just wanna fit in.

695
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,890
