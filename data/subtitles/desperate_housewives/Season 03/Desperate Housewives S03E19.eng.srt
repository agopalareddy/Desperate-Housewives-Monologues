1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,450
previously on desperate housewives.

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:04,230
maybe you haven't noticed,
but I'm in love with you.

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,090
Victor caught gaby by surprise...

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,760
why would a four-star chef wanna slum at a pia joint?

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,280
Lynette took a gamble...

6
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,270
- he has a history...using cocaine.
- No,no way.

7
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,600
Well,but he's been clean for almost a year.

8
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,180
Mike bet on love...

9
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,100
I win,you leave me and susan alone.

10
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:20,290
And lost...

11
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:21,150
don't panic.

12
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,200
But still came to susan's rescue.

13
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,320
You okay?

14
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,550
Yeah.

15
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:32,410
And mrs. Mccluskey revealed her secret
for a lasting relationship.

16
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:39,880
It was late on a tuesday night
when the power went out all over fairview.

17
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,200
for most of the residents,
it was a minor inconvenience.

18
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:51,440
But for those with secrets,
the darkness proved quite useful indeed.

19
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,250
Millie russell was able to
indulge in another night of midnight binging.

20
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:03,790
Timmy cooper was ableo sneak another peek
at his father's adult magazines.

21
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:10,710
Marilyn quinn was able to
steal a few more puffs of her forbidden tobacco.

22
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:19,360
but these secrets paled compared to the one
a certain old woman was hiding in her basement.

23
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,180
You sit tight,ida.

24
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,120
I got batteries here.

25
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,510
No,I keep them in the freezer for just such an emergency.

26
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,050
I'll run 'em over to you.

27
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:32,650
By the way,yowouldn't happen to
have any extra ice laying around,would ya?

28
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,660
No,I've just got some stuff in my freezer
I don't want thawing out anytime soon.

29
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:45,670
Yes,as a rule,darkness helps us
keep our secrets safely hidden.

30
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,470
Oh,crap!

31
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,330
But every rule...

32
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,780
karen,what's happened?

33
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,320
Are you okay? ...

34
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,090
Has its exceptions.

38
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,730
When the lights went out on wisteria lane,

39
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:54,220
karen mccluskey wasn't the only reside left in the dark.

40
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:59,470
Everyone else felt the pain of going without power as well.

41
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,210
Ow! Damn! Thumbtack!

44
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:08,410
Oh,wait.

45
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,400
Here we go.

46
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,380
But it's hardly a long-term solution.

47
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,300
Well,at least it'll keep me
from stabbing myself while I look.

48
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:19,880
But this is silly.

49
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:22,360
Why don't we just borrow a flashlight from mike?

50
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,860
Mike?

51
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,250
He's a plumber. He's bound to have a spare.

52
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:31,590
Sure,but we can't keep leaning on him for everything.

53
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:32,860
"Mike,we're drowning. Save us."

54
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,310
"Mike,it's dark. Give us a flashlight."

55
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,420
Let's go ask gaby.

56
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,930
Actually,I wanted to talk to him anyway.

57
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,000
I thought we might ask him over for dinner.

58
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,270
Dinner?

59
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,890
You know,as a-- as a thank you gesture.

60
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,390
Well,ian,you've tasted my cooking.

61
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,220
It's not a thank you.

62
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,280
It's revenge.

63
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,450
well,then I'll cook.

64
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,560
You know,you told me
I should put my jealousy behind me.

65
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,270
I think breaking bread together
would be a great start.

66
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,250
Well,let's not bother him tonight.

67
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,100
You know,
I don't really even need a flashlight.

68
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,320
My eyes have totally adjusted to the dark.

69
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,660
what was that?

70
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,420
Don't walk in the kitchen.

71
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:10,850
Anyway,where is your sense of romance?

72
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,930
It's a blackout.

73
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,010
You have a defenseless lady.

74
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:16,660
getting any ideas?

75
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,090
Well,I-I-I'm starting to,yes.

76
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,370
It's funny.

77
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:24,740
All that time I wasted worrying mike
would come between us--

78
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,890
it seems so laughable now,doesn't it?

79
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,300
Kiss me.

80
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,530
Hey,carlos,we had a blackout.

81
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,090
You need a flashlight?

82
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,600
carlos,you okay?

83
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:48,720
Oh,uh,sorry,man.

84
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,800
I thought I heard a thud.

85
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:53,810
I just,um,bumped into a chair.

86
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,930
I didn't think
that you were coming home till tomorrow.

87
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,050
Nah,fish weren't bitin'.

88
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,930
So,uh...

89
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,060
you got a girl in here?

90
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,070
No.

91
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,950
Why?

92
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:11,480
Oh,'cause when I came home,
I thought I heard sex nois.

93
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,940
No,that was just me.

94
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,640
Okay.

95
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:18,760
Night.

96
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,440
oh,god,that was close.

97
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,940
All this sneaking around is ridiculous!

98
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:31,070
mike and I dated foR...five minutes.

99
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,040
He's not gonna care.

100
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,400
What if travers finds out?

101
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:35,990
look,I don't want him to be confused,

102
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:39,350
and until we figure out where this is going,
I just...

103
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:41,580
think we should keep things on the down low.

104
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,340
Hey,I didn't say we had to stop.

105
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,080
- I just said we had to  quiet.
- What?

106
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,660
I suppose we should tiptoe around like schoolchildren
so our parents don't catch us doing it?

107
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,300
I feel like I'm 12 again.

108
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,070
I'm just saying,I don't think
that the whole world needs to know our...

109
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:56,990
12?

110
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,170
Okay,look...

111
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:02,330
I will find us another place to rendezvous.

112
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,680
But I'm not gonna skulk around forever.

113
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,650
And no one's asking you to.

114
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:10,200
I respect you too much for that.

115
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,460
if you don't mind...

116
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,080
oh,for god sake...

117
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,760
I'm gonna be right there.

118
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:35,950
Here you go.

119
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,550
So can you still cook with the power out?

120
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,360
Of course!

121
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,090
Absolutely!

122
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,350
Please,please,tell me we can still make pizza.

123
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,220
No dice.

124
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,820
Some genius installed pizza ovens with electric starters.

125
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,730
Oh,this is awful.

126
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:52,390
On a good night,we barely break even.

127
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,060
Tonight is gonna kill the whole week.

128
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,830
Not necessarily.

129
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,400
The stovetop's gas.

130
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,090
I bought pasta for the staff dinner.

131
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,280
You give me ten minutes,

132
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:06,010
I'll whip up a spaghetti carbonara
that'll knock their socks off.

133
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,640
Oh,my god!

134
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,010
You are a lifesaver!

135
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,830
And,uh,since it's not on the menu,

136
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,540
you can charge whatever you want--

137
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,700
say,20 bucks?

138
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,440
For pasta? Are you crazy?

139
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,440
Won't hurt to ask.

140
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:23,480
Oh,I don't wanna scare them away.

141
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,420
Okay.

142
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,540
Okay.

143
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,920
So...

144
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:29,800
good news!

145
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:33,070
Our chef is preparing his special spaghetti carbonara.

146
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:33,900
Ooh,yummy!

147
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,070
And we're offering that for $12.

148
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,370
Great!

149
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,830
For the appetizer portion.

150
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,860
The entrée is $20.

151
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:41,530
Fine.

152
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,910
2. 22.

153
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,420
Okay.

154
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,760
shouldn't there be an emergency light?

155
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,500
sometimes in these elevators there's A...

156
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,730
ta-da!

157
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,480
Well,aren't you clever?

158
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,350
I'll just call hotel security
and let 'em know we're--

159
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:01,770
no,wait!

160
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:04,750
This is the first time
I've had you to myself all night.

161
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:05,760
I'm sorry.

162
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,910
It's those fund-raisers.

163
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,940
Everybody wants a piece of the candidate.

164
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,140
What are you doing?

165
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,430
Taking my piece.

166
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,140
Are you insane? We're in an elevator.

167
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,620
Exactly.

168
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,630
Going down...

169
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,020
no! come on.

170
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,040
Cut it out.

171
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,500
The power could come on at any moment.

172
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:23,520
I know.

173
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:26,650
That's what makes it so exciting--the risk.

174
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:30,000
But,uh,
I-I'm kind of running for mayor here,remember?

175
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,050
It's an elevator,silly.

176
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,180
It has an emergency stop button.

177
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,630
I don'T.

178
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,040
oh,my god,that's amazing!

179
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:47,900
What are you doing?

180
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:48,830
That's my phone.

181
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,930
It's on vibrate.

182
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:51,950
oh,god!

183
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,970
Oh,man,I was just starting to get into it.

184
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,720
Less talking,more dressing.

185
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:03,670
you two okay?

186
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:05,980
Yeah,fine,thanks.

187
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:10,680
Must've gotten pretty hot in there.

188
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:13,940
You have no idea.

189
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,830
karen,don't worry about a thing.

190
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,840
I'll collect your mail till you get back.

191
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:30,140
Well,how long's this blackout supposed to last?

192
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,260
Well,they say it may last for days.

193
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,390
Days?!

194
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,770
Uh...hey,blondie,come here.

195
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:36,800
Come here.

196
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,190
Hey,listen,
I don't really need to go to the hospital.

197
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:39,860
I'm fine.

198
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,580
You fractured a rib,
and you might ve a concussion.

199
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,610
You need looking after.

200
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,570
No,some of the stuff in my freezer might melt.

201
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,910
How about I just run out and get some ice
and then meet you at the hospital?

202
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:50,200
Ma'am,you can replace groceries.

203
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,330
You don't understand.

204
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,910
Some of my groceries-- they--
they have sentimental value.

205
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:55,790
Sorry.

206
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:57,140
Yeah,well,I don't need to ask your permission.

207
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,290
Ma'am,no!

208
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,630
Get your hands off me,you big ape!

209
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,340
Get the restraints.

210
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,140
I'm gonna sue your ass!

211
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,520
hey!

212
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,890
Well,what are we waiting for?

213
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:17,950
Get me to the hospital.

214
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,410
I'm not a well woman.

215
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,930
What was that all about?

216
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:27,960
Your friend's afraid the stuff
in her freezer is gonna spoil.

217
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:30,140
Oh,well,thank god the power's back on.

218
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,330
Now she won't have to worry.

219
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,830
I made you waffles!

220
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,990
eat 'em while they're hot.

221
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,550
What?

222
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,500
Will you marry me?

223
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,950
They're just toaster waffles.

224
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:14,110
Ah,that was just the pre-proposal,actually.

225
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:17,680
The real one will be much more romantic
with a big diamond the size of a doorknob.

226
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,720
But just so you're prepared,
I do wanna marry you.

227
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:23,800
Well,just so you're prepared,
consider this my pre-refusal.

228
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:24,590
Come on. What's wrong?

229
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,480
You're wearing my shirts.

230
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,290
You burn my breakfast.

231
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:27,280
You're here every night.

232
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,660
It's like wee married already.

233
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:30,230
We're having a good time.

234
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,980
Why risk ruining it?

235
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:34,950
See,what happened to the thrill seeker
that seduced me in the elevator?

236
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,140
She wouldn't be afraid of taking a little risk.

237
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,210
Oh,you don't wanna marry her.

238
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,260
She's a tramp.

239
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,470
Hold out for a good girl.

240
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,350
No,no,no.

241
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,470
I've found what I'm looking for.

242
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,090
Come on. What gives?

243
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:49,580
Look,victor...

244
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:53,310
getting divorced really kicked my ass.

245
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,710
I'm sorry. Just...

246
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:59,010
next time I get married,I've gotta be sure.

247
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,770
Okay,I get it.

248
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:05,870
I just wish there was a way
I could prove how much I love and ore you.

249
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:08,880
Well,if you canhoke down
that lousy waffle I made you,

250
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,140
that'd be a starT.

251
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,160
oh,there's mike.

252
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,560
Should we see if he's free friday night?

253
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,640
Yeah. Yeah,why not?

254
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,010
Sure.

255
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:40,220
You know what?
Do you wanna run this ice cream side before it melts?

256
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,050
look,ian is going to come invite you to dinner friday,

257
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,770
and you are not--I repeat--
not going to accept.

258
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,870
Why is ian inviting me to dinner?

259
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:00,890
He wants to thank you for saving us,

260
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,880
and he wants to show that he's not jealous of you.

261
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,360
How's that for irony?

262
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,210
I didn't plan to kiss you,
but you didn't exactly resist.

263
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,870
I was in shock.

264
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:13,000
Why were you so upset when you mentioned ian?

265
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,970
Because we had just had a fight...

266
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,420
about you.

267
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,850
Really?

268
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:20,650
You talk about me a lot?

269
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,470
Mike,I am marrying ian.

270
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:23,490
We have hired a caterer.

271
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,980
We are going with the salmon,
so just back off!

272
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,290
Hey,ian.

273
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,550
Hi,ian.

274
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,920
I just asked mike.

275
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,060
He can't make it.

276
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,290
Yeah,I'm sorry.

277
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,920
I've got plans tonight.

278
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:36,780
Oh,but didn't we say friday?

279
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,090
Friday?

280
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:39,370
Oh,friday I'm wide open.

281
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:41,870
Splendid!

282
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:43,710
Shall we say 7:30?

283
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,090
It's a date.

284
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,410
edie!

285
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,590
Mrs. Epstein!

286
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,680
Listen,I'm late for my hadassah meeting.

287
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,660
Here's the key.

288
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,820
Take your time.

289
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,300
Oh,and don't be shy.

290
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,890
Check out those closets.

291
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,760
They're very spacious.

292
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,400
Edie,what are we doing here?

293
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,760
Checking out a house.

294
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,910
I told you,I'm not looking to buy right now.

295
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,920
Well,who's talking about buying anything?

296
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:19,010
I...

297
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:20,360
am giving it away.

298
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,060
Edie,we cannot have sex in here.

299
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,540
It's someone else's bed!

300
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,460
That's just wrong!

301
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,850
Look,we can't use my place.

302
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,520
We can't use yours.

303
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,300
But I'll be damned
if I am gonna pay for a hotel room

304
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:38,220
when there are all of these empty houses
all over town that I have the keys to.

305
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:44,090
Though reluctant at first,
carlos soon saw the wisdom in edie's plan.

306
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,820
Secret affairs e a lot like real estate.

307
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,500
The three keys to success are...

308
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,700
location...

309
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,790
location...

310
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,970
location.

311
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:03,330
- careful. I can't sit down that fast.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

312
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,810
But it's gonna be worth it.

313
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:08,020
Okay,so tell tom the secret of your risotto.

314
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:11,340
Well,I saut?spinach and onions in white wine--

315
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,280
no,no,the profit margin.

316
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,030
Uh,basically,it costs a dollar to make--

317
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,320
and we charge $20!

318
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:21,570
4 people who would've shared a $15
izza are now spending 80 bucks.

319
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,570
Okay,kids,dig in!

320
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,150
- There's just one little problem with that,lynette.
- Yeah?

321
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,210
Those families you're talking about have kids,

322
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:36,400
and there's no kid that's gonna eat anything
with spinach in it.

323
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:37,860
Um,tom...

324
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,480
it's delicious,huh?

325
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:46,970
Mm-hmm! Oh,yeah!

326
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:48,320
Yeah?

327
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:50,100
Rick learned how to make this in italy.

328
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,120
Go ahead.

329
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:51,860
Try it.

330
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:53,170
I wanna see what you think.

331
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,130
It's good.

332
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,280
It's awesome!

333
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,550
It's good.

334
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,480
But?

335
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,160
But it's just not us.

336
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,170
Us?

337
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,310
What is us?

338
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,400
Look,we're a neighborhood pizza place.

339
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,710
We serve pizza.

340
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:21,620
I like this better.

341
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,170
I'm getting bored of pizza.

342
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,470
Porter,the adults are talking.

343
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:28,100
Look,we serve good food at good prices.

344
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:31,020
We're not looking to be the next,you know,
trendy flash in the pan.

345
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,060
That's--that's not what I'm looking for either.

346
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,150
Um,see,my food-- it's not trendy.

347
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:35,990
It's classic.

348
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:36,730
Rick...

349
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,940
obviously you're a great cook,
and when you have your own place,

350
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,150
I will definitely eat there,
but I see no reason to change my menu.

351
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:52,030
More,please!

352
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,150
hi!Can I help you?

353
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:12,860
Uh, yeah, I'm here to see mr. Lang.

354
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,910
He's not here.Is that for him?

355
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:19,610
Yeah.But it's very persal.

356
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,400
- Okay.
- I don't think I should leave it with the maid.

357
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,610
Do I look like the maid?Give me that!

358
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:45,020
Victor lang if you want the negatives.I demand 50,000!
do not call the police!I will contact you!

359
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:50,790
you!Blackmailer!

360
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,680
Oh, man, you weren't supposed tlook!

361
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:01,950
Get off of me!

362
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:04,860
Ow!No!

363
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,130
$50,000?Are you insane?!

364
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,740
No, that's not for you to decide!

365
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:11,320
I want all the negatives of those photos, or I start breaking fingers!

366
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,770
No, you can't break my fingers!

367
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,670
Come on!Aah!

368
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,710
give me the pictures!

369
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:19,690
hey, hey, hey, hey!Hey, break it up!Break it up!Come on!Come on!

370
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,840
She's crazy!She's crazy!

371
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,430
That's for calling me a maid!

372
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,050
he works the hotel security monitors.

373
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:33,030
That's how he got the photos.

374
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,440
That miserable cockroach.

375
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,690
Well, if you wanna smack him around a little, I can go inside and turn up the radio.

376
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,110
Again, no, thank you, but I will need those photos.

377
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,180
Oh, no, no, I'm gonna hang on to these.

378
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,850
They're a little revealing.

379
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:48,570
Ma'am, we can't charge him without evidence, and if he walks,

380
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:51,190
he can do what he wants with the originals.

381
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,870
Okay...yeah.

382
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,550
But guard them with your life.

383
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:02,560
Yeah, especially that one.

384
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:07,650
we've been open for three months now, and we've barely turned a profit!

385
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,880
we are building a customer base!That takes time!

386
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,620
Go on, ask her.

387
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,970
No, you ask her!

388
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,530
why are you being so stubborn?

389
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:21,200
And you would rather see the restaurant fail than succeed with rick's idea!

390
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,340
And I can't believe that you two are ready to toss out my concept.

391
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:27,470
You know, why don't you just rename the restaurant "lynette and rick's"?

392
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:30,770
- Can we have fudgsicles?
- no!

393
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:35,470
Sorry, lynette, but the menu is not changing.End of discussion.

394
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,480
I don't think so.

395
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,970
I'm giving it a try.

396
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:42,490
That's not your decision to make.

397
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:46,010
yeah?Well, then why don't you come down to the restaurant and stop me?

398
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,020
Oh, that's right.You can'T.

399
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:54,680
I told you she'd say no.

400
00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:00,350
ms.Mccluskey always has some fudgsicles.

401
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,680
Yeah, but she's in the hospital.

402
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,300
where's the ice cream?

403
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,440
She didn't have any.

404
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,540
oh, man!

405
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:58,670
- There wasn't anything good in there?
- No.

406
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:21,750
Lang sexcapade caught on tape!

407
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,480
what the hell were you thinking?

408
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:26,350
How was I supposed to know the cops were gonna release the photos to the press?

409
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,410
Everybody in town knows the police chief is the mayor's brother-in-law--everyone!

410
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,700
Enough, jerome!

411
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:33,410
I want you to organize a press conference, and then I want you to help me prep for it.

412
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:36,070
Well, this is gonna be a bloodbath.I don't know how you're gonna prep.

413
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:40,940
Just get me a bucket of piranhas, and I'll stick my head in it.

414
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:49,090
you know, you're a single guy.Maybe people won't care.

415
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:53,140
I'm running a family values campaign, and I had sex in an elevator.

416
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,810
I think they will care.

417
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:02,470
look, I know this is my fault, so if you wanna bite my head off, go ahead.

418
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:07,960
You know, gaby, there are only two things that matter to me these days-- my campaign and you.

419
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:13,350
And if I had to lose one of them, I'd rather it was the campaign.

420
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,310
Is there anything I can do?

421
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:23,610
Uh, yeah, you can stick around on election night.

422
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,530
I have a feeling I'm gonna need some serus consoling.

423
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,560
Mmm!God, that is so good!

424
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:37,070
I know.It's hard to decide, huh?

425
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:40,800
No.No, I'm gonna go with the crab cakes and the little quesadillas.

426
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,980
Well, all we need is a wedding cake, and we're done.

427
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:46,550
You are the most decisive bride I've ever met.

428
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:48,370
I just guess I'm in a rush.

429
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:52,180
Oh?Oh, gotcha.

430
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:55,110
Well, don't worry.You are not showing at all.

431
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:57,000
Oh, no, no, no.No, I'm not pregnant.

432
00:22:57,030 --> 00:23:01,060
No, I just know know what I want, which is ian.

433
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:06,310
So I'm just eager to...you know, no- not get it over with, per se, but just to...

434
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:11,370
get to the good part, which is the marriage...to ian.

435
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:13,480
Seems like a great guy.

436
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,250
I don't suppose he has a brother.

437
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,660
Oh, so you're not seeing anyone?

438
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:23,340
No, I'm between disappointments.

439
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:25,720
Well, are you free for dinner tomorrow?

440
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:27,770
Is this some lame setup?

441
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,200
Please say yes.

442
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:36,100
Well, there's this guy coming to dinner, and he is single and handsome and charming and...

443
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:38,610
you had me at "guy.¡±

444
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,420
So how do you knowim?

445
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:45,560
Oh, uh...he's just a neighbor.

446
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:55,970
- Hey, buddy, whatcha doing?
- Nothing.

447
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,210
You seem a little mopey lately.Is everything okay?

448
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,150
Yeah.

449
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:05,190
Can we go see mrs. Mccluskey?

450
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,060
You guys didn't have to come down here.

451
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:11,260
No matter what that C.A.T.Scan says, I'm breaking out tomorrow.

452
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,130
Well, parker really wanted to come vit you.

453
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,560
I'm gonna put a little water in these.

454
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:20,760
Don't tell your brothers.you were always my favorite.

455
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:24,080
I saw the man in your freezer.

456
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,570
- lynette!
- Yeah?

457
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,150
Could you run down to the snack bar and get me some green jell-o?

458
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:32,100
Oh, sure!

459
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:40,170
Okay, time for a little grown-up talk.

460
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:52,650
So can you understand now why I had to do what I did?

461
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,560
And how you can never tell anyone, not even your mom?

462
00:24:55,590 --> 00:25:00,910
Hey, they didn't have jell-o, so I hope pudding is okay.

463
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:03,450
Uh...yeah, let's-- let's give it to parker.

464
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:06,450
A good boy like him deserves a treat.

465
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,820
what are you thinking about?

466
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:24,040
Just...this room doesn't really work.

467
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,020
It's just too sterile.

468
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:29,050
Can we go back to that spanish colonial on 3rd?

469
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:32,690
Sure.Fine.

470
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,760
You know what i was thinking?

471
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:43,640
I'm really happy, and I haven't felt this happy in a long time.

472
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,290
How about you?

473
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,860
Are you happy?

474
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:50,570
Oh, my god!

475
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,970
Oops, sorry.Bed's not made.

476
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,520
- Russell!
- Why don't you check out the subzero in the kitchen?

477
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:59,050
It's to die.

478
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,090
Well, I see you can't close a sale without opening something else.

479
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,530
Oh, please, I heard about your open house on holly drive.

480
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:11,000
They're still disinfecting the jacuzzi.

481
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:13,890
- Slut.
- Bitch.

482
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:18,060
you thk he's gonna tell anyone?

483
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:21,930
He's a gay realtor.He's speed-dialing as we speak.

484
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,250
Then go stop him.

485
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,620
What's the big deal?

486
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,320
Who cares if people find out?

487
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,560
- I do.
- Why?

488
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,390
Are you embarrassed to be dating me?

489
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:35,660
No!it'S...you know, if gaby finds out, she's gonna hit the ceiling.

490
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:39,350
Oh, why would she care?She's dating that victor guy.

491
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:42,050
Please, that's not gonna last.

492
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,860
Oh, my god.

493
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:50,770
You're still in love with her.

494
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:56,840
No, I just...look, I mean, we've been getting along, and don't wanna...

495
00:26:57,070 --> 00:27:01,740
I don't know who the bigger moron is-- you or me.

496
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:04,680
Hey, don't be like this.

497
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,300
Look, we're having fun, right?

498
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,630
Apparently that's all we're having.

499
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,090
Edie, come on!

500
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,720
No, fun's over.

501
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:23,230
Ah, mike.Thanks for coming.

502
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:25,310
Thanks for asking me.

503
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,700
Susan.

504
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:36,090
- hi.
- Um, mike,

505
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:38,810
I want you to meet maggie gilroy.

506
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:46,690
I don't believe this.

507
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,310
You're setting me up?

508
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:50,240
You need to move on, okay?

509
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,860
I don't wanna move on.

510
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:53,090
I came here to see you.

511
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:56,190
Well, I'm not available, so if you feel like kissing someone tonight,

512
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:58,900
point those lips at maggie.

513
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:03,330
Here we go--your beer.

514
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,970
Did I mention that maggie is an amazing chef?

515
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,410
We're embarrassed to be cooking for her.

516
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,830
Stop.

517
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:15,880
So, um, mike, do you have a favorite type of cuisine?

518
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:22,640
Nah.After three months of prison food, everything tastes good to me.

519
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,070
So you were in prison?

520
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,590
He was totally innocent.

521
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:32,810
Yeah, a woman was bludgeoned to death, and her blood wound up on my wrench.

522
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:34,200
Oh, my god.

523
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,720
But he was cleared.All charges dropped.

524
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,760
Here.Eat this.

525
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,170
It's just so awful.

526
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,020
I mean, to go to jail for a crime you didn't commit.

527
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,440
Oh, it was just a few months.

528
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:47,170
Now my first stretch for manslaughter...

529
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,480
that was brutal.

530
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:55,630
My worst cellmate was this guy called "stilts.¡±

531
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:59,860
When they arrested him, they found a bowl full of ears.

532
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:03,650
ow!I-I think that was meant for you.

533
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:05,300
Sorry.

534
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:08,190
So why don't I just go and brew some coffee?

535
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:13,550
And, uh, I brought a little surprise for dessert-- wedding cakes for you to sample.

536
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,470
Great.

537
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:23,720
Thanks a lot.Now maggie thinks you're charles manson.

538
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,660
I don't care.I love you.

539
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:26,820
Don't say that.

540
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:29,250
It's true.I remember everything now.

541
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:32,280
When i got run over, I was on my way to propose to you.

542
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,830
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- I do.

543
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:38,320
What would you have said?

544
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:42,230
You know what I would have said.It doesn't matter now.

545
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,870
The hell it doesn'T.Susan,

546
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:47,020
if you can look me in the eye and tell me that when we kissed,

547
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:49,720
you felt nothing, then I'll just go,

548
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,070
but only if you can say that and really mean it.

549
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:55,630
Can you?

550
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,590
Who wants wedding cake?

551
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,840
Maggie, these cakes are fantastic.

552
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:09,390
Great.Well, all you have to do is choose one, and we're done.

553
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:11,000
Did you notice the themes?

554
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,730
Themes?Yes.

555
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:17,560
This one is very british-- fondant icing and toffee ganache.

556
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:23,670
And this is your classic american-- white cake with buttercream frosting.

557
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,410
So which one do you like the best?

558
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:32,420
Wow.It's kinda hard to decide.

559
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:37,610
Well, that depends on what you're looking for-- rich and elegant...

560
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:41,910
or down-to-earth and sweet?

561
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:46,770
I don't know.

562
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:48,340
You want to taste 'em again?

563
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,390
No, I know what they taste like.

564
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:51,960
I'm just torn, okay?

565
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:54,320
There's no need to get upset.It's--it's just a cake.

566
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,940
It's not just a cake.It's a major decision!

567
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,700
Well, hey, if you like 'em both so much, why don't--why don't you have two cakes?

568
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,740
How would that look?

569
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:04,330
"Oh, hey, everybody!

570
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:06,060
Here's my wedding cake.

571
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:07,680
Oh, and what's that over there?

572
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:09,600
It's my other wedding cake.¡±

573
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:12,330
I have to pick, and I will!

574
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,280
So just stop pressuring me, okay?

575
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,690
I'm sorry.

576
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:30,440
I think I was just having a little sugar rush.

577
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:36,740
Thanks again, and sorry.

578
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:54,050
seriously, just put it on hold for just a month or two.

579
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,740
Excuse me.Am I interrupting something?

580
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:59,950
No.It's nothing.

581
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:02,660
I think it's time to level with him.

582
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:06,030
I just told susan I want her back.

583
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:07,530
Excuse me?

584
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:12,650
Look, I know it puts a crimp in your plans, and I'm sorry, but I love her.

585
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,960
Well, that's too damn bad, isn't it?Because she doesn't love you.

586
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,600
Really?

587
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:18,660
She didn't seem to mind when I kissed her.

588
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:21,120
What?Did he just kiss you?

589
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:22,860
No.It--it was days ago.

590
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:25,960
- And you let him?!
- No!He--he pounced.

591
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,260
It was hardly a pounce.

592
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:30,470
You bastard.We...we had an agreement.

593
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:34,700
Susan doesn't have to rry you because you won her in a game of cards.

594
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:38,430
What, he didn't tell you how we played poker for you?

595
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,910
You bet me in a game of poker?

596
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:43,090
It's not--not how it sounds.

597
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:48,530
I merely suggested that-- that if I won the hand, then he--he would stop badgering you.

598
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,160
And if he won?

599
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:55,090
Well, I-I forget the exact terms, but the point is, he lost, as I knew he would.

600
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:59,070
I never would have wagered you if I didn't have a very good hand.

601
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,190
- Get out!
- Susan, please.

602
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:05,250
- You heard her.
- You, too.

603
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,310
I've had it with both of you.

604
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:08,980
You're tugging at me like I'm some kind of wishbone.

605
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:12,250
- You're just upset.
- No, I am beyond upset.

606
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,690
You two want a decision?Well, here's what I decide.

607
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:21,250
There will be no kissing, and there will be no wedding, and there will be no damn cake!

608
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,560
what's this?

609
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:39,170
Uh, pumpkin sage ravioli.

610
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,390
It's a little thank you for taking a chance on me.

611
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:44,960
are you kidding?I should be thanking you.

612
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:47,800
We took in 3 grand tight.

613
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:50,960
Oh, woW.Candles, too?

614
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,200
Yeah, I think we should use 'em all the time.

615
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,340
It softens up the ambience.

616
00:33:55,380 --> 00:34:00,050
So come on.Eat.

617
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,480
Oh.Oh, my god.

618
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:15,510
If we serve this for tomorrow's special, will will clear 4 grand.

619
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:19,260
Great.Uh...just be sure to run it by tom.

620
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:22,140
Why?You know he'll just shoot it down.

621
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:24,850
I mean, I get it.He's in pain.

622
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:28,800
He doesn't like being sidelined, but that is no reason to...

623
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:32,090
you know what?Let's talk about something else.

624
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,370
Yeah, sure.

625
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:37,530
I mean, unless you'd like to go.You're here so late all the time.

626
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,380
No.No, I like being here.

627
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:41,920
It beats going home to an empty apartment.

628
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,360
Don't you have any friends to hang out with?

629
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:47,920
My friends come in two varieties-- the ones I drove away bere I got clean and the ones

630
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:50,760
I should avoid if I wanna stay clean.

631
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:54,470
Oh, yeah.I gotcha.

632
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,920
you ever wear your hair down?

633
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:05,250
What?Yeah, sometimes.why?

634
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,840
It looks really good.

635
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:11,320
You should do it more often.

636
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:15,370
Oh, well...thanks.

637
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:29,040
- This is delicious.
- Thanks.

638
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:32,170
- Do you want some more wine?
- Sure.

639
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:41,860
daddy!

640
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:44,450
The paper has a story about your restaurant.

641
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,050
You're kidding!

642
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:49,250
Well, come--come here.What does it say?

643
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:55,550
"When scavo's pizzeria opened its doors, you could almost hear the city groan,

644
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:58,490
"'just what we need-- another pizza joint.

645
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:02,420
' But with an updated menu from new chef rick coletti...¡±

646
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,250
is he the man who cooked us that really, really

647
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:06,490
Yeah, that's the one.

648
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:07,910
What--what else does it say, honey?

649
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,300
"There's more than just crayons on the table.

650
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:14,960
"The veal piccata is divine, "and the mushroom risotto is an...

- exquisite.

652
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:20,020
"An exquisite treat.

00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:25,750
"Scavo's has been transformed from a mundane family eatery into the area's hottest--"

654
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:33,450
that's enough, kayla.Daddy's tired.

655
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,800
Okay.

656
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,000
More fallout from lang bang.

657
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:58,990
Okay, I know you guys like a good scandal, but I think the citizens of fairview

658
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:01,380
are more interested in the real issues.

659
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:12,490
mr. Lang, given your 15-point drop in the polls, what do you have to say to your constituents?

660
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:17,580
Well, I would ask them to, uh, not base their view of me on a single lapse of...

661
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:19,090
it's not going very well, is it?

662
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,260
You picked up on that, did you?

663
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,770
Who is she, mr. Lang?Give us a name.

664
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,680
No, I will not identify the woman.

665
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,510
What are you hiding?Is she a prostitute?

666
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:31,780
no!She's not a prostitute.

667
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:35,420
I'll answer questions one at a time, people.

668
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:42,590
that does it.

669
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,430
Whoa, whoa, whoa.What are you doing?

670
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,600
Gaby, stop, please.Please, stop.

671
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:49,260
Excuse me.Excuse me.

672
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:55,550
Excuse me.I am the woman in the photos!

673
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:04,000
what are you doing?

674
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:06,260
Standing by my man.

675
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,460
what's your name?

676
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:13,610
My name is gabrielle marquez, and I want you to know,

677
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:18,710
right before those photos were taken, victor asked me to marry him.

678
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,400
what did you say?

679
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:24,800
I said, "yes.

680
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:29,010
I would be thrilled to be mrs. Victor lang.¡±

681
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,120
are you gonna get married?

682
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,450
have you set a date?

683
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:35,350
are you really getting married?

684
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:38,790
In fact, I was so overcome, that when we were trapped in the elevator,

685
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:41,700
I seized the moment to...

686
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,830
express my joy.

687
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:45,790
So this is a love story?

688
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:49,810
The only reason victor kept it from you was to protect me...

689
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:54,320
because he's the kind of man who puts a woman's honor before his own,

690
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:57,060
and that's the kind of man you marry.

691
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,150
That's the kind of man you vote for.

692
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,190
where are you honeymooning?

693
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,600
What's that smell?

694
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:46,180
ma'am.

695
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:51,280
Are you karen mccluskey?

696
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:55,130
That little bastard gave me up, didn't he?

697
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:58,250
today, at the mayoral candidate's press conference,

698
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:02,810
a woman identified as gabrielle marquez, a former model,

699
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:08,230
surprised reporters by announcing her engagement to mr. Lang.

700
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:12,300
the only reason he didn't tell you was because he was protecting me.

701
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:15,720
carlos?

702
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:17,510
I don't know if you've heard...

703
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:21,220
yeah.I heard.

704
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:26,270
In a few months, I will be mrs. Victor lang.

705
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,120
I just heard on the radio the power company is still having problems,

706
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:42,910
and there might be another rolling blackout today.

707
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:45,590
Do you want me to leave ida's number in case something happens?

708
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:48,290
I'm sure I'll be fine.

709
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:50,840
Did you read our review in the paper?

710
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:54,500
Yep.

711
00:40:55,310 --> 00:41:00,570
Okay.I'm off.

712
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:28,560
power-- it's the type of thing most people don't think about...

713
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:33,260
until it's taken away.

714
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:37,590
Whether it's the political power of the many...

715
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:46,840
or a lover's influence over just one...

716
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:52,990
we all want some sort of power in our lives...

717
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:57,330
if only to give ourselves choices.

718
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:08,310
Yes, to be without choices, to feel utterly powerless, well...

719
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:11,350
it's a lot...

720
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:15,390
like being alone...in the dark.
