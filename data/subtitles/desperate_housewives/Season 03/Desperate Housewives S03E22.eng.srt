00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,420
Previously on desperate housewives

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:05,530
Carlos revealed his deepest desire.

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:06,690
It's about children.

4
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:08,100
I want them so bad.

5
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,810
Tom forced the issue.

6
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:11,210
Are you sleeping with my wife?

7
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:12,550
Of course not.

8
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,160
Rick came clean.

9
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:15,720
I have feelings for you.

10
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,310
I know you feel something for me.

11
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,530
You can't work here anymore.

12
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,050
And Susan's tortured love life...

13
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:25,590
I was on my way to propose to you.

14
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:26,840
Was finally...

15
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:27,860
what would you have said?

16
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,190
On the mend.

17
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:40,980
exactly one year had passed since the night
mike delfino and susan mayer were supposed to become engaged.

18
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:45,550
So when mike took susan
to her favorite restaurant,

19
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,400
she just knew he was
going to pop the question.

20
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:51,170
What are you gonna have?

21
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,530
And when he did...

22
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,520
the chicken.

23
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:58,180
She'd be ready with her answer.

24
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:02,180
But as the evening wore on,

25
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,270
the moment susan had been waiting for...

26
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,480
failed to materialize.

27
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,340
and though many opportunities presented themselves...

28
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,030
the question was never asked.

29
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:31,710
Until the thought began to dawn on susan that perhaps...

30
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:34,900
it never would.

31
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,710
Pretty quiet over there.

32
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,710
Was dinner okay?

33
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:48,050
If by "okay" you mean uneventful,then yes.

34
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,420
Something on your mind?

35
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,220
Mike,what day is today?

36
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,750
Um,wednesday.

37
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,990
Yes.

38
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:59,860
It's also the anniversary of the day
we were supposed to get engaged.

39
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,250
A year ago tonight,

40
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:06,030
you were on your way to ask me to marry you
when you got hit by that stupid car.

41
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,830
Wow,that was a year ago?

44
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,650
why are you getting mad?

45
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:18,120
I thought you were gonna propose tonight.

46
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,760
Susan,why would I want to commemorate the anniversary
of the night that some maniac put me in a coma?

47
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,810
Because this date has special meaning for us.

48
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,420
I sat in front of that trailer for six hours thinking you hated me,

49
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,900
and a proposal would've brought the entire thing full circle.

50
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,520
It would've turned a bad memory into a beautiful one.

51
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:39,070
You really thought this through,didn't you?

52
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:42,420
Yes,I did,because I am a thoughtful person.

53
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:46,330
And whenever we do get married,
that is something you are gonna have to work on.

54
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,720
I'll do my best.

55
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:52,840
By the way...

56
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,080
that seem familiar?

57
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,160
Oh,my god.

58
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:07,660
I can't believe that you did this.

59
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,510
Well,I wanted to...

60
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,490
how'd you put it?

61
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,200
Turn a bad memory into a beautiful one.

62
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:18,660
now go sit in front of that trailer.

63
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,690
I promise I'll show up this time.

64
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,710
yes,susan knew mike was about to pop the question--

65
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:59,090
the one she feared he'd never ask.

66
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,010
Oh,mike.

67
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,150
And thanks to susan...

68
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,770
will you marry me?

69
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,880
He never did.

70
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,790
luckily,it wasn't the question she needed to hear.

71
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,730
I kind of had a speech prepared,but...

72
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,230
sure.

73
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,530
What the heck?

74
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,300
It was the answer.

78
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,870
From the moment we wake up in the morning...

79
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,970
what time is it?

80
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:43,480
Till our head hits the pillow at night...

81
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,290
did you lock the front door?

82
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,830
Our lives are filled with questions...

83
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:52,150
did you remember to buy more shaving cream?

84
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,270
simple ones that are easy to answer.

85
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,410
Can I still pull this look off?

86
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:05,400
But someuestions are so dangerous,

87
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:09,080
the truth...is not an option.

88
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,030
Are you mad at daddy?

89
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,410
No.

90
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,910
Why would you think that?

91
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,260
'Cause you're not talking to him.

92
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:28,580
Well,when two people have known each other
as long as mommy and daddy have,

93
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,840
they don't have to always talk.

94
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:34,180
In fact,a sign of a good relationship
is being comfortable in silence.

95
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,410
That's true.

96
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:39,570
Although mommy ignoring me last night at work
wasn't exactly what I'd call "comfortable."

97
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:47,960
Well,daddy probably didn't notice that I was unloading
20-pound bags of flour 'cause he still can't lift them,

98
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:51,410
so mommy didn't exactly have time
to sit around and chew the fat.

99
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,450
Well,you haven't wanted to chew the fat for five days now.

100
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,310
Come on,lynette,something's obviously bugging you.

101
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,160
You wanna know what's bugging me?

102
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,130
I'm trying to have a lovely breakfast with my family,
and you're picking a fight.

103
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:02,850
Who's fighting? I just wanna talk.

104
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,260
There's nothing to talk about,okay?

105
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,910
- Just leave me alone.
- Fine.

106
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:07,120
Good.

107
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,770
Sorry I asked.

108
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,510
Hey,françois,it's susan mayer.

109
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,030
Um,call me as soon as you get this.

110
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,560
I know I told you that my wedding is off,but it's back on,

111
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,990
and I wanna see if you're still available to do the flowers.

112
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:20,650
Bye.

113
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:24,070
Oh,um,just so you know,ian's not the groom anymore.

114
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,280
Long story.

115
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,350
Call me.

116
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,700
there.

117
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:29,470
I think I left messages for everyone.

118
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,660
Are you sure it's okay for us to have the same wedding
I was planning with ian?

119
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:34,580
Be honest.

120
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,130
Well,I stole his bride.

121
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,160
I guess I can poach his florist.

122
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:41,670
Gosh,I just keep thinking
there's someone I've forgotten to tell.

123
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:45,640
Caterer,band,florist...

124
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,670
um...guests?

125
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,630
Oh,my god!

126
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,790
I had julie call and cancel everyone.

127
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:52,610
Just call 'em back.

128
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,970
You can't invite people to a wedding on the phone.

129
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,270
You have to send a proper invitation.

130
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,910
You want people to think I'm a complete flake?

131
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,930
Hi,curt. Susan mayer.

132
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,360
You did my wedding invitations?

133
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,200
Uh,I'm gonna need another batch.

134
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,980
Exactly the same,
only change the name "ian hainsworth" to "mike delfino."

135
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,050
Long story.

136
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,090
Call me.

137
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,860
hey,what's with the frown?

138
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,540
You trying to get wrinkles before the wedding?

139
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,460
No.

140
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:27,380
I can't find a good flower girl.

141
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,490
Lynette keeps hinting for me to use penny.

142
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,780
But I saw her in that preschool sing-along,
and I am sorry,

143
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:34,010
but we are talking zero charisma.

144
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,850
You know,I had a thought about the flower girl.

145
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,560
You did?

146
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,730
My cleaning lady has a daughter...

147
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,020
where's that picture?

148
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,070
Look familiar?

149
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,310
Oh,my god. She looks just like me when I was that age!

150
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,360
Yeah,that's what I thought.

151
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:52,180
See,this way,the wedding procession starts with you
as this beautiful little girl,

152
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,420
ds with you as the stunning bride that you've become.

153
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,410
I love that you're so into this wedding.

154
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,710
Most men would be like,"yeah,yeah,tell me where the church is,"

155
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,730
but you're as obsessed as me.

156
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,370
You're like a hot groom and a gay best friend all rolled into one.

157
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,750
Well,can you blame me for wanting to make everything
as perfect as you?

158
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:16,920
feel better?

159
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,580
Yeah.

160
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,060
There must've been a bad scallop in that paella last night.

161
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:26,460
You'd think that half-bottle of tequila
you drank would've disinfected it.

162
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,810
Oh. Sorry to interrupt.

163
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,650
I'm just,uh,moving some stuff over to susan's house.

164
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,410
You two shacking up now?

165
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,710
Actually,we're getting married.

166
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,460
you're kidding!

167
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:40,790
Congratulations!

168
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,620
Thanks.

169
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:42,990
You don't waste any time.

170
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,610
Well,you know,I've already wasted a year.

171
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,650
I don't want to wake up one more day
without her lying next to me.

172
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,490
Oh,god.

173
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:50,850
Here comes what's left of breakfast.

174
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,420
And,uh,you two better be careful.

175
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,580
All this wedding fever going around...

176
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:56,960
you might catch it.

177
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,570
yeah,right!

178
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:04,600
What?

179
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,470
Oh,I'm sorry.

180
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:09,390
I didn't realize the concept of our being married
was such a thigh-slapper.

181
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,360
come on,edie.

182
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,340
Look,it's way too soon for us to be talking marriage.

183
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,550
We only just started dating.

184
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,290
Oh,I know,but...

185
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,370
well,we could live together.

186
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:22,050
We're either at my house or your house every night anyway.

187
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,910
Yeah...true,but...

188
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,540
well,why not?

189
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:30,930
And we're not kids anymore,carlos,and,
I mean,I really care about you.

190
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,820
Don't you care about me?

191
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:35,820
Of course I do.

192
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,530
But...

193
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,690
I just took over mike's lease yesterday.

194
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:42,750
Oh,please. Old lady sims can find another tenant.

195
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,070
Edie,I already signed the papers.

196
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,940
Look,I have a responsibility.

197
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:49,290
You know,that rent helps pay for her nursing home.

198
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,160
You understand,right?

199
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,610
Mrs. Sims?

200
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,700
E-edie?

201
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:09,060
- Edie britt?
- hi! Are you up for a visit?

202
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,230
Well,of course!

203
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,940
Oh! What a nice surprise!

204
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,670
I haven't seen you for years.

205
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,810
Oh,I know,and I feel awful about that.

206
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,920
I have always liked you so much.

207
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,770
You know,wisteria lane hasn't been the same since you left.

208
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,340
Well,with my arthritis,I just couldn't live alone anymore.

209
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,380
But what I get from renting more than pays for this place.

210
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,420
Ooh! Well,that's good.

211
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:36,470
Although with mike delfino getting married,
your house is gonna be empty now.

212
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,470
Actually,no.

213
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,460
A friend of mike's just signed a lease-- a very nice man.

214
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,860
Oh,what was his name?

215
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,480
Uh...it's here somewhere.

216
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,920
Uh,"carlos solis."

217
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,220
Oh,dear.

218
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,460
What?

219
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,750
What did mike tell you about carlos?

220
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:56,730
Oh,just that he's a nice,responsible man.

221
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,080
Oh.Well,he is when he's sober.

222
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,810
He has a drinking problem?

223
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,170
Well,actually,what i heard is...

224
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,710
oh,what am I doing?

225
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,570
I shouldn't be indulging in idle gossip.

226
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,780
Edie,please!

227
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:15,190
Smack. He does smack.

228
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:15,950
What?

229
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,380
Good heavens!

230
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,590
Oh,well...

231
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,980
he seemed such a nice man when I met him,
and he's got a good job.

232
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,340
I know.

233
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,510
What is that term?

234
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,400
"Functional junkie."

235
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,070
This is very upsetting.

236
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:32,380
Maybe I should rethink this.

237
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,580
No!

238
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,970
I should learn to shut my big mouth.

239
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,660
I mean,here I am, blathering on about drugs and prostitutes.

240
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,550
Prostitutes?!

241
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:42,220
You never said anything about prostitutes.

242
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,140
And I'm not going to.

243
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,190
Frankly...

244
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,510
I don't want to be on his bad side.

245
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,480
Edie,I can't have someone like that in my house.

246
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,170
I have to tear up this lease.

247
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,540
Oh,no,I can't let you do that!

248
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,950
Not with your arthritis.

249
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,550
Here.

250
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,360
You let me.

251
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:07,620
Gaby!

252
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,720
Oh,susan!

253
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,610
Julie told me about ian.

254
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,960
I am so sorry.

255
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:15,570
You must be devastated.

256
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,560
Hey,gaby.

257
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,470
I see you've picked up the pieces.

258
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,130
We got engaged last night.

259
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:23,450
We're getting married!

260
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,190
Oh,my god! Congratulations!

261
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,040
So forget what julie told you about the wedding being off.

262
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,570
It's back on.

263
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,250
Really?!

264
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,290
Same day?

265
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,770
Yep! I promised people a wedding, and they are getting one.

266
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,500
Well,I'm sorry.

267
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,570
I can't make it.

268
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,560
I have plans that day.

269
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:39,490
Oh,you could change your plans.

270
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,060
No,I really can'T.

271
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,880
well,what could be more important to you than my wedding?

272
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,790
Uh...my wedding?

273
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,640
What?

274
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:51,130
Oh,I see you got the invitation!

275
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:54,970
You're getting married on my wedding day?

276
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,950
Well,you canceled,and victor was kind of in a rush

277
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,740
because he didn't think it'd look good  for the mayor to be shacking up.

278
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:03,110
And every day we tried,someone had a conflict.

279
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:06,090
And then your date opened up, and we knew all my friends were available,

280
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:07,600
and,well...

281
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,390
you know,you,too.

282
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:10,790
Uh,it's really no problem.

283
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,220
We'll find another date.

284
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:18,310
Gaby,did you really think I would want to spend what would've
been my wedding day watching someone else get married?

285
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:21,770
I am so throwingt bouquett to you!

286
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,090
okay,if you think for one second...

287
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,210
it's fine. Really.

288
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:25,950
Come on,susan.

289
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,360
We got some calls to make.

290
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,250
Oh,right!

291
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,840
I have to cancel my wedding...

292
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,890
again!

293
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,700
-susan. Hi.
-Is this a bad time?

294
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,900
-I'm kind of in the middle of something.
-Okay, well,

295
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,600
I just wanted to say that I'm sorry for
getting so snippy yesterday,

296
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,100
that when I canceled my wedding,
you had every right to...

297
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:57,500
-susan? Susan?Is that my susan?
-Fran is!

298
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,200
I am so sorry that I could not do your wedding flowers.

299
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:05,800
But the moment you canceled,your friend here--
she, uh... how you say?

300
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,200
Scoop me up.

301
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,500
you stole my florist?

302
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,400
Only because I admire your taste.
It's not theft.It's an homage.

303
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,500
I left the bouquet and the centerpiece on the table.

304
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,100
If there are any changes,you let me know.

305
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,300
Au revoir.

306
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,900
Well, I gotta go.

307
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,200
I wanna see those flowers.

308
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,200
-Oh, my god,that's my centerpiece!
-Oh, what,

309
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,600
now you suddenly have the trademark on peach tulips?

310
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,700
In this town in wedding season?Yeah, I do.

311
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,300
You might as well have used my caterer and my swing band.

312
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,000
Yeah. Listen, about that...

313
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,800
-oh, my god. Did you steal my whole wedding?
-It was short notice, okay?

314
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,300
These people are booked months in advance.

315
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,800
The only people available were thones you just bailed on.

316
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:02,200
Gaby, I spent months planning that wedding.

317
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,700
Oh, I see what you're getting at.

318
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,800
And you know what?You are right.

319
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:11,000
You have been my de facto wedding planner,
and you deserve to get paid.

320
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,200
All right, what's the going rate? $7,000? $8,000?

321
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,400
-Gaby...
-all right, $10,000.I'm not gonna haggle.

322
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,300
I don't want to be paid.I want my wedding back.

323
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,000
Well, you can't have it.

324
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:27,700
-And if you ask me, I am doing you a really big favor.
-Excuse me?

325
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,800
You are rushing into this marriage thing way too fast.

326
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:34,200
Why don't you give it some time
and see if you and me work as a couple?

327
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,600
I'm rushing?

328
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,600
You met victor three months ago.
I've known mike three years.

329
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,100
Yeah, on and off.Mostly off.

330
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:46,800
What if you tie the knot in a month and realize that
you miss ian and mike misses the coma?

331
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,500
I cannot believe that you just said that.
Okay, you know what?

332
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,400
I came over here to give you my response card.

333
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:59,300
But here. This is my response.

334
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,300
you don't mean that.
That's just a big dramatic gesture.

335
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,500
Oh? No.No, this is a big dramatic gesture.

336
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:12,800
-My flowers!
-No. They're my flowers!

337
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,300
Enjoy your stolen wedding!

338
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
you can't do this!I just signed a lease!

339
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:27,000
I'm sorry. The law says my mom
has 72 hours to change her mind.

340
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,100
She's exercising that option.

341
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,200
-hey! What's going on?
-I've been evicted.

342
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,400
-What?
-Yeah.That was mrs. Sims' kid.

343
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,200
She's giving me 24 hours to move out of her house.

344
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,700
-That is so weird.
-It gets weirder.

345
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,600
He told me mrs. Sims is praying for my spiritual recovery.

346
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,100
Oh. Well, when old folks see the end coming,
they get all religious.

347
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,400
I guess.

348
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,600
So mind if I crash with you until I can find a new place?

349
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,200
-Of course not.
-Thanks. I'll bring my stuff over in the morning.

350
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,100
Ooh, why wait?I've got boxes in the garage.

351
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,000
I'll help you start packing now.

352
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,500
Edie...

353
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,500
-did you have something to do with this?
-What

354
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,500
you have to admit,it is kind of a coincidence.

355
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,700
-You ask me to move in,I say no, I get evicted.
-How dare you.

356
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:26,900
I offer to put a roof over your head,
and you repay me with suspicions and insults?

357
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I don't even know that I want you in my house.

358
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,400
-Fine. I'll get a motel.
-Oh, whoa! Uh, hold on.

359
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,000
-Let's not be hasty.
-I knew it.

360
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,400
-You were behind this.
-Okay.

361
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,900
If you wanna fight, fine.
But let's talk about the real issue here.

362
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,500
I mean, why are you so reluctant to make a commitment to me?

363
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,000
-I told you. I don't want to talk about this.
-Well, you never do,

364
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,400
but you owe me an explanation.

365
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,300
-I mean, why don't you want to move in with me?
-Because I'm not in love with you.

366
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:03,000
Edie, I'm sorry.I really like you...

367
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,200
no, I get it. I...

368
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,200
it's just a little upsetting because...

369
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,000
I'm late.

370
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,800
Ed, you can't be pregnant.You're on the pill.

371
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,300
Yeah, well, I might've forgotten to take it a couple of days,

372
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:26,100
and I've been nauseous for an entire week,
so I went and got a pregnancy test.

373
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,700
I figure I should find out
if i'm carrying your love child.

374
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:38,700
Oh, wait, my mistake.Your like child.

375
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:56,800
-so? What does it say?
-It's gonna take a couple more minutes.

376
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,400
I just peed on that.For god sake,put it on a coaster.

377
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,600
Ugh. This is just dandy.

378
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,200
I'm 40,single and knocked up.

379
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,200
But on the bright side,the dad's not into me. Hmm.

380
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,900
Edie, if you are pregnant,I'm not gonna
let you go through this alone.

381
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,700
so what, you're gonna be my lamaze partner?

382
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,300
No. I'm saying I'll step up.
I'll be there to help you raise him.

383
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,800
you serious?

384
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,200
Hey, I was there practically every day
to help you with travers.

385
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,000
What makes you think that I would do any less
if it were actually my child?

386
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:48,000
Well, thanks. That'S...nice to know.

387
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,300
You know...

388
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,800
your spare bedroom...would make a great nursery.

389
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,100
yeah. I guess it would.

390
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,800
I mean, it's right down the hall from the master,
so we'd be able to hear him when he was crying.

391
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,700
"We"?

392
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,200
You'd move in?

393
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,000
I told you that I would be here for you.

394
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,600
We could even decorate his room
in, like, a whole pirate theme.

395
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,600
I always wanted to do that if I had a son.

396
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,000
You know what would be really cool?

397
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:30,700
Decorate his bed like--like a--like a ship,
with a sail and a mast--

398
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,500
carlos?

399
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,700
It's negative.

400
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,300
Oh.

401
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:52,000
-Well, that's a relief, huh?
-Yeah.

402
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,700
we really dodged a bullet.

403
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:02,300
So...let's celebrate,have a drink.

404
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:09,600
Oh, and by the way,you're still welcome to stay
till you find a place.

405
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,100
That's nice of you.Thanks.

406
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,100
I cannot thank you enough for doing this.

407
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,300
Thanks for taking the time out of your day.

408
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,300
Yeah, tom, I'm not sure this is the best approach.

409
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,300
I mean, I've never done a session before where half of the couple
didn't know I was a marriage counselor.

410
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,200
We'll tell her...eventually.

411
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,400
I just don't wanna scare her off.

412
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,100
-Hey, lynette.
-Yeah?

413
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,100
Look who just walked in off the street--scott mckinney.

414
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,000
Remember?We pledged alpha tau together.I told you about him.

415
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,600
You won the beer pong championship?

416
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,700
-You told her about that?
-Yeah, and then you threw up in the trophy.

417
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:56,400
Well, that is far from his only accomplishment.He's got a phd.

418
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:00,600
Oh, wow.Well, I'd love to chat,
but I have cheese to grate.

419
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,900
Honey, no, wait, please.I will do that later.

420
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,800
I want you guys...to know each other.

421
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:12,000
I mean,this guy... is my boy.

422
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,600
So scott got married the same year that we did.

423
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,300
How's your wife liki fairview?

424
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,400
Well, uh, her whole family's back east,
so she--she kind of resisted the move.

425
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:28,400
-Really? So that was a source of conflict?
-Yes. Well, all couples have their conflicts.

426
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,000
-I'm sure you've had your share.
-Oh, sure, now and then.

427
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,500
Emphasis on "now."

428
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,500
-tom...
-scott shared with us.

429
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,000
-We're--we're--we're going through kind of a rough patch.
-I see.

430
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,100
Well, I'm sure it's something you will get through.

431
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,000
The trick is to keep those lines of communication open.

432
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:47,200
Boy.easier said than done.

433
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:52,300
So this rough patch...what--what--what would you say
is the underlying issue there?

434
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,000
Well, scott,I'm not sure i would say,

435
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,000
particularly not to someone I just met.

436
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:06,000
He--he's just trying to help.If you ask me,
I'd say it started when our manager, rick, quit.

437
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,700
Oh. Okay, and--and how did that make you feel, lynette?

438
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:14,500
I am not answering that.
This is not a therapy session.

439
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:18,200
But if it were,wh-wh-wh-wh--what would you say?

440
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,900
-Oh, dear godyou didn'T.
-What... didn't what?

441
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,000
Okay, okay.Give it up, tom.

442
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,100
Yes. Yes, lynette,I am a couples counselor.

443
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,000
Really? And what do you call this, ambush therapy?

444
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:39,300
It was my idea.Look, I'm just trying to get you to
talk about what is going on.

445
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,300
-And don't tell me that nothing's going on!
-No, no. Good, good.

446
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,000
-All our cards are on the table.
-Cram it!

447
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,700
Okay, yeah, tom,I've been unhappy lately.

448
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,600
I am working through some issues,
but that is something I need to do on my own.

449
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:56,000
Talking about it doesn't help--not to you,
and certainly not to dr. Beer pong.

450
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:05,500
Well, I'm biing you for a whole hour,so,
uh, is there anything else on your mind?

451
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,300
I mean, I'm sorry,but this time,gaby has just crossed the line,

452
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,300
and I will not make myself sit through her wedding.

453
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,900
Julie thinks I'm overreacting.
You don't think I'm erreacting, do you?

454
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,900
-Yeah, a little.
-Absolutely not.

455
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,000
What? She asked.

456
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,600
Look, even if gaby is in the wrong here...

457
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,900
and she--she is hugely, hideously wrong--

458
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,600
do you really want to boycott her wedding?

459
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:34,000
She said that I would make mike wish he was back in a coma.

460
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,900
i think her point--and again,I wish she'd express herself a little more tactfully--

461
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,900
was that marriage is unpredictable.We can't know
what it'll be until we're in it.

462
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,400
Don't defend that self-centered brat.

463
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,300
She steals susan's wedding and then expects to stay friends.

464
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,700
She--she divorces carlos and doesn't want anyone else to date him.

465
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:56,300
You know,I've never known anyone
as dishonest and manipulative.

466
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,300
-Speaking of carlos,I hear he got evicted.
-Yeah,that was a real shocker.

467
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:04,600
Anyway,you stick to your guns,
and don't you dare go to that wedding.

468
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,900
It could ruin yourriendship.
Are you willing to take that chance?

469
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,000
no, I guess not.

470
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,400
Wuss.

471
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:18,200
Well, at least get her a thoughtless, crappy gift,like a blender.

472
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,100
I got you a blender for christmas.

473
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,600
And I use it every day.Gotta go.

474
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,900
honey, I am so sorry.I hope you don't hate me.

475
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,600
I don'T. I was just on my way to apologize to you.

476
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,000
-Just so you know,I changed all my flowers.
-You don't have to.

477
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:58,500
The hell I don'T.Those peach tulips belong to you...

478
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,700
and so do these.

479
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,100
thank you.I was just bringing you this.

480
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,500
well, we got chocolate and wine.Your place or mine?

481
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,200
Oh! Well...

482
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,500
I'm so glad we're doing this.
I hate it when we fight.

483
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:19,400
Me, too, and I'm so sorry about that
comment I made about mike.It was way out of line.

484
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:23,500
-You guys are gonna be insanely happy.
-I think so, too.

485
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,400
But, you know,then I remember,
that's what I thought about me and karl.

486
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,700
Please. Mike is not karl.

487
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,100
Well, you know,when I married him,karl wasn't karl.

488
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,200
And I think that's why I got so mad at you.

489
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:40,400
Because 99% of me is sure that we're gonna be totally happy.

490
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:44,600
But then what you said--it just stirred up that pesky 1%.

491
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,100
Honey, please. If anyone should be nervous, it's me.

492
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:50,900
I met victor three months ago.
I mean, I'm crazy about him.

493
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:55,000
It's just, the thought of saying those vows again?That's scary.

494
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:58,600
Mm. Lynette is right.You know, marriage is like...

495
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,100
it's like these bonbons.

496
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,900
You never know what you're getting
until you're in the middle of it.

497
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,500
it's one of those hard jelly ones.

498
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:12,800
-Do you think that's an omen?
-Honey, you're gonna be okay.

499
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:17,200
-All right? We're gonna help each other through this.
-Right. Yeah.

500
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:23,500
And getting married is scary,
but at least we'll be doing it together.

501
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,500
Oh, my god!

502
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,300
-We should totally do that!
-What?

503
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,300
-Get married together!
-You and me?

504
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:38,400
Oh! Well,I-I'm beyond flattered.
I-I find you to be an incredibly attractive woman.

505
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,300
-I just--
-oh! No, stupid.

506
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:44,500
-I mean, a double wedding!
-Oh. Oh!

507
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,900
Oh, I would love that!

508
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,600
Yeah, and then you wouldn't be mad at me for the date,
and I wouldn't feel guilty.

509
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,800
-And we could be brides...
-together!

510
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,800
oh, yes! Let's celebrate.More chocolate.

511
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,500
And just so you know,if I was a lesbian,I'd totally do you.

512
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,800
That's good to know.

513
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:16,190
It's a fact of life that brides-to-be who
agree to double weddings late at night

514
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,610
Often feel differently come the dawn.

515
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:26,250
This change of heart was certainly
true in the case of susan mayer...

516
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,530
and evenore so...

517
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:32,550
for gabrielle solis.

518
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:35,950
- Morning.
- Hi,honey.

519
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:40,630
I hope I didn't wake you last night.
I was at susan's till midnight.

520
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,250
- Is something wrong?
- No,not exactly.Just A...

521
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:47,120
Small change of plans about the wedding.

522
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:49,770
What kind of change?

523
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:52,260
See...

524
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:56,050
Susan was really upset...

525
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:59,850
I mean,I've never seen gaby so torn up with guilt.

526
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:02,550
Practically in tears over this
whole wedding date thing.

527
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:06,320
And she kept saying,"please,
let me make it up to you!

528
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:10,300
So after an hour of this,
I suddenly heard myself say...

529
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:12,090
Hey,how about a double wedding?

530
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,910
Wanted to bite my tongue the minute it came out.

531
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,330
She's so excited,so needy.

532
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,680
Jumping up and down and hugging me.

533
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:21,180
I mean,what could I say?

534
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:24,340
So we're kind stuck.

535
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:26,560
So what do you think?

536
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:29,800
I think anything
that makes you happy is fine by me.

537
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:32,900
- Will this make you happy?
- No.

538
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:34,330
I'm screwed.

539
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:37,870
I cannot get out of this without
hurting her feelings.

540
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:41,440
Well,maybe this'll help...
I forbid it.

541
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:42,620
- You do?
- Sure.

542
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,930
Tell her that your groom's an old-fashioned guy

543
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:48,160
and he doesn't want to see anybody
on that altar but his bride.

544
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:51,440
If she gets mad,have her take it up with me.

545
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:54,320
So this is what marriage is about?

546
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:57,860
Having someone to hide behind?

547
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:01,370
- So what do youhink?
- You're gonna have to undo this.

548
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:04,260
How?Look I know I shouldn't have offered,
but I did.

549
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:06,360
- I can't just take it back.
- Well,you're gonna have to.

550
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:09,100
Do you have any idea what
this day means to me?

551
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:12,370
I do,and I know you've worked really
hard to make our wedding perfect.

552
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:17,370
Exactly.Do you think I want to share it
with your friend and her ex-convict fianc?

553
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:21,160
- That's your problem?
- Gaby,I'm the mayor of this town.

554
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:22,960
How's it gonna look?
There'll be press there.

555
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:26,450
- Press?At our wedding?
- Well,we're public figures.

556
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:30,590
So all of this planning and attention to detail--
that's all been about your image?

557
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:34,320
Of course not.Gaby,this is gonna be
the proudest day of my life

558
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:36,580
and I'm not sharing the spotlight with anyone.

559
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:39,590
- How about the bride?
- Oh,please.

560
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,110
Every eye in that place is gonna be on you.

561
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,920
Every woman will wish they were you.
Every guy will wish they had you.

562
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:47,760
It's gonna be great.

563
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:49,240
Tell your friends you're sorry.

564
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:51,410
Tell 'em I'll even pay for eir wedding.

565
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:54,660
But they're not sharing mine.

566
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04,710
Here's a 1-bedroom at the oaks with
a view of the golf course.

567
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,340
That's gonna go fast.

568
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:10,040
You know,I'm gonna call on this first thing
in the morning.

569
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:14,940
Or...I know this is the last thing
you'd expect to hear from me,but...

570
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:21,980
What if you stayed here with me,
and we tried to have a baby?

571
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:26,760
What,you're serious?

572
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:31,310
Well,I saw the look on your face
when that test came back negative.

573
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:35,700
Admit it.You were disappointed.

574
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,880
Yeah,maybe a little.

575
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:43,530
- Well...so was I.
- You were?

576
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,230
Yeah,I was.

577
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:49,080
You know,having travers here
made me realize that...

578
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:52,610
I like being a mom.And you're so great with him.

579
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,670
Well,think...

580
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:59,150
we could have that all the time.

581
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:02,030
edie,nobody wants a kid more than me.

582
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:07,180
- It's just...
- yeah,yeah,we're not head over heels in love.

583
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:10,350
We like each other,right?

584
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:14,300
I mean,that's more than a lot of
parents have going for them.

585
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:17,050
It'S...just a very big step.

586
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,820
Carlos,look around.

587
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:24,560
Everyone's taking big steps--
gaby and victor,susan and mike.

588
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:28,190
And this could be our step.

589
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:32,180
And we both need to love someone.

590
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:36,090
No one said it had to be each other.

591
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,120
Just think about it.

592
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,410
let's do it.

593
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:09,850
- You really want to?
- Yeah.

594
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:12,940
I'm tired of waiting for my life to start.

595
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:16,390
Oh,carlos!

596
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:21,260
Imagine,with your genes and mine,
that child is gonna be a knockout!

597
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:28,490
I'm gonna brush my teeth,I'm gonna flush those
birth control pills,and we're gonna get crackin'.

598
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,950
- Hey!
- Hey!

599
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:55,860
- How are you doing?
- Good.

600
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:57,680
Listen.We need to talk.

601
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:03,430
I spoke to mike,and,uh,he's just not really
into the whole double wedding thing.

602
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:08,480
- Mike said no?
- Yeah,he sort of wants the day just to be about us.

603
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:12,070
So we're gonna wait till the fall.
I'm so sorry.

604
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:15,140
No.No,it's okay.
Victor was kind of on the fence about it,too.

605
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:17,980
Oh,good!I mean,not that they said no,just...

606
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:19,870
- 'cause i really wanted to do it.
- Me,too.

607
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:23,970
- I think it would've been so much fun.
- Yeah.

608
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:27,390
Well,I gotta go.I'm gonna meet fran is.

609
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,510
See ya.Oh,by the way...

610
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:34,360
You know that 1% sliver of a doubt thing
I told you about?Totally gone.

611
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:38,510
Any question I had about mike's been answered.

612
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:43,290
- That must feel really great.
- Yeah.

613
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:52,180
I feel really good about this.

614
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:54,500
I do,too.

615
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:56,430
Our friends are probably gonna make fun of us.

616
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,720
Yeah,I'm sure.

617
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:01,500
But who cares?It's gonna be great.

618
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:03,660
I'm so happy we're gonna be living together.

619
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:06,670
We're gonna have so much fun.

620
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,880
I'll be right out.

621
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,740
Okay...

622
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:45,200
let's make a baby.

623
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:04,570
- I talked to my back doctor today.
- What did he have to say?

624
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:08,730
He said,assuming I exercise reasonable caution

625
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:11,100
I can have sex again.

626
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:13,300
And what would that have to do with me?

627
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:16,100
Well,you don't seem to want to
talk to me these days

628
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:21,690
so I figured it's the one thing that
we can do together without speaking.

629
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:25,940
Remember when I was giving birth to the twins
and screaming in agony

630
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:28,460
because porter was dragging
my uterus out with him?

631
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:32,990
Well,I was more in the mood for sex
then than I am now.

632
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,130
- Lynette?
- Hmm?

633
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:37,830
I'm your husband.I have to find a way
to connect to you somehow.

634
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:43,230
So we can have sex or we can talk.

635
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,750
Your call.

636
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:50,030
- Fine.Let's have sex.
- What?

637
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:54,390
- Yeah.Let's get this off.
- What,you would rather have sex with me than talk to me?

638
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,730
- Ow,that hurts.
- I said I'd have sex.I didn't say I'd make love.

639
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:01,170
Huh,you wanna play rough?
'Cause I could play rough.

640
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:05,610
- Cut it out!
- Sorry.I'll try to be gentler as I move down south.

641
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:08,520
Okay.Okay!

642
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:12,720
okay,fine!You are mad at me.

643
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:15,810
But name one thing that I have done to deserve it!

644
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:18,890
You d lunch with rick.

645
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,650
You're damn right I did.I saw the security tape.

646
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,830
What was I supposed to do,
pretend that nothing was going on?

647
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,950
Nothing was going on!He never touched me!

648
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,650
And I wasn't gonna sit around
and wait until he did!

649
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:32,650
- I am glad that I made him quit!
- You didn't make him quit!

650
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:35,980
- I fired him!
- You what?

651
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:38,980
The idiot told me he had feelings for me,
which he never would've done

652
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:42,730
if you hadn't pushed him,and now he's gone.
It's all your fault.

653
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,320
My back!

654
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:51,430
Lynette?

655
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,850
Honey?

656
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:03,120
It'll just be a few more minutes,mrs.Scavo.

657
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:06,940
- The doctor's oking at your C.A.T Scan.
- Thank you.

658
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,920
This whole thing is ridiculous.
I bumped my head.

659
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:13,600
Lynette,you were dizzy and throwing up.

660
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:17,820
- You can't be too careful.
- Well,I feel just fine now.

661
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:27,590
When rick said he had feelings for you,
what did you say?

662
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:34,160
I said that it was totally inappropriate,
and then I fired him.

663
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:40,940
Do you have feelings for him,lynette?

664
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,720
Do you have feelings for rick?

665
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:48,780
I would never cheat on you.You know that.

666
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:51,920
That's not what I asked.

667
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:58,730
Did you fall for him?

668
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:11,210
Oh,god.

669
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:15,000
Nothing happened.He's gone.It's over.

670
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:18,710
Don't tell me that it's over.
We've been fighting about this all week.

671
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:22,020
You miss him,don't you?

672
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:25,210
- Don't do this.
- Damn.

673
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:32,170
Not now.I can'T.

674
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:36,720
Mrs.Scavo?

675
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:40,200
That's me.I'll be back.

676
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:45,230
Actually,I'D...rather have you both
come in for this.

677
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:54,030
- Is it a concussion?
- No,it's just a bruise.

678
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:57,480
Well,good.

679
00:39:57,490 --> 00:40:01,460
But I noticed something in your C.A.T.Scan
that concerns me.

680
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:06,530
You have a few swollen lymph nodes in your neck.

681
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,680
I wanna send you in for a biopsy.

682
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:10,060
A biopsy?Why?

683
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:13,370
Have you noticed any change in
your appetite lately?

684
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:17,590
- Any fatigue,fevers,uh-
- Stop.Just...stop.

685
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,940
What is it you think I have?

686
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:24,260
I don't want you to panic.
This can be any number of things.

687
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:27,490
Is one of them cancer?

688
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:30,440
It could be lymphoma.

689
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:34,060
We're hoping the biopsy will rule that out.

690
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,260
If you look at the C.A.T.Scan...

691
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:46,070
you can see this white area here stands out.

692
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:49,840
These are called submandibular lymph nodes.

693
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:56,660
Lymphoma can vary according to the type of cell
that multiplies and how the cancer presents itself.

694
00:40:56,670 --> 00:41:02,170
There are two types-- hodgkin's and non
-hodgkin's lymphoma.

695
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:11,670
From the moment we wake up in the morning

696
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,900
Till our head hits the pillow at night

697
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:19,450
our lives are filled with questions.

698
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:23,390
Is it morning yet?

699
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,510
Most are easily answered and soon forgotten.

700
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:30,920
Not yet,sweetheart.
You go back to sleep now.

701
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:33,980
but some questions are much harder to ask

702
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:38,670
because we're so afraid of the answer.

703
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:44,280
Will I be around to watch my children grow up?

704
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:50,710
Am I making a mistake by marrying this man?

705
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,480
Could he ever truly love me?

706
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:03,580
And what happens when
we ask ourself the hard question

707
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:07,650
and get the answer we'd been hoping for?

708
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:14,040
Well,that's when happiness begins.
