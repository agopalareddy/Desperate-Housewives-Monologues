1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,683
Previously on Desperate Housewives...

2
00:00:01,723 --> 00:00:04,119
Mike's plan to
propose to Susan...

3
00:00:04,198 --> 00:00:05,899
These things don't
belong to Jane.

4
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:06,999
"Mike Delfino."

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,870
Was a surprise to Ian.

6
00:00:09,802 --> 00:00:11,268
Monique was murdered...

7
00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:12,346
There's been an accident.

8
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:14,600
-And Orson...
-Don't forget your wrench.

9
00:00:14,957 --> 00:00:16,300
Passed the blame.

10
00:00:16,807 --> 00:00:18,650
A connection was made...

11
00:00:21,243 --> 00:00:22,909
A heart was broken...

12
00:00:23,446 --> 00:00:26,510
And Bree buried
her husband Rex.

13
00:00:34,602 --> 00:00:37,327
My name is
Rex Van De Kamp.

14
00:00:37,729 --> 00:00:40,050
I always hated cemeteries
when I was alive.

15
00:00:40,706 --> 00:00:43,400
Now that I'm dead,
I like 'em even less.

16
00:00:46,365 --> 00:00:47,751
Here's where
I used to live.

17
00:00:47,815 --> 00:00:49,833
A whole lot nicer,
don't you think?

18
00:00:51,566 --> 00:00:53,700
The place hasn't changed
much since I left,

19
00:00:53,805 --> 00:00:55,851
as tasteful
and tidy as ever.

20
00:00:56,258 --> 00:00:57,800
Everything perfect...

21
00:00:58,108 --> 00:00:59,700
at least on
the surface.

22
00:01:00,067 --> 00:01:01,630
My family was
the same way.

23
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:04,303
Look at us.

24
00:01:04,345 --> 00:01:07,401
You'd never guess how ticked off
we all were the day this was taken,

25
00:01:07,786 --> 00:01:10,311
but that was the thing
about us Van De Kamps.

26
00:01:10,326 --> 00:01:11,402
To really fit in,

27
00:01:11,506 --> 00:01:14,400
you had to have a smile
that gave away nothing.

28
00:01:17,955 --> 00:01:19,362
Like my son Andrew.

29
00:01:19,676 --> 00:01:22,621
To look at him, you'd never know
he spent six months on the streets

30
00:01:22,627 --> 00:01:25,993
supporting himself with
panhandling and light prostitution.

31
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:28,303
Or my daughter Danielle.

32
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:30,180
Does she look like
the kind of girl

33
00:01:30,187 --> 00:01:32,490
who'd seduce her
middle-aged History teacher?

34
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:35,700
I mean, they're my kids,
and I love 'em,

35
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:38,203
but I'm pretty darn
relieved to be dead.

36
00:01:40,305 --> 00:01:42,501
Here's the clown
Bree replaced me with,

37
00:01:43,306 --> 00:01:44,202
Orson.

38
00:01:45,276 --> 00:01:46,342
I don't mind saying,

39
00:01:46,347 --> 00:01:48,503
he's creeped me out
right from the get-go.

40
00:01:52,908 --> 00:01:55,300
To me, he always has
the shifty look of a guy

41
00:01:55,307 --> 00:01:57,351
who knows where
the bodies are buried...

44
00:02:02,607 --> 00:02:04,801
But Bree thinks
he's sir Galahad.

45
00:02:05,746 --> 00:02:06,971
The kids like him.

46
00:02:09,287 --> 00:02:10,471
And all my friends...

47
00:02:11,825 --> 00:02:13,231
now his friends.

48
00:02:13,948 --> 00:02:16,660
So it pleases me to know that
at least one of my old neighbors

49
00:02:17,606 --> 00:02:19,272
sees right
through the guy.

50
00:02:20,205 --> 00:02:23,003
Mike, you just
missed Bree.

51
00:02:23,055 --> 00:02:24,601
She's off to
see her folks,

52
00:02:24,606 --> 00:02:26,701
and then we're finally
taking our honeymoon.

53
00:02:27,407 --> 00:02:29,903
Yeah, not a bad time for
you to leave town, is it?

54
00:02:30,745 --> 00:02:32,203
Well, I don't follow you.

55
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:35,702
I just keep thinking about
that night at Monique's place.

56
00:02:35,807 --> 00:02:37,901
How you made sure
I left with my wrench.

57
00:02:38,606 --> 00:02:39,901
The one with
her blood on it.

58
00:02:40,106 --> 00:02:41,902
Well, it was
your wrench.

59
00:02:43,367 --> 00:02:44,950
Why are you
rehashing this?

60
00:02:45,308 --> 00:02:47,572
My ex-wife confessed
in her suicide note.

61
00:02:47,576 --> 00:02:48,862
The case is closed.

62
00:02:49,557 --> 00:02:50,721
Maybe it shouldn't be.

63
00:02:52,407 --> 00:02:53,802
What do you think
the police would say

64
00:02:54,206 --> 00:02:55,950
if they knew you were
there that night?

65
00:02:56,868 --> 00:02:57,702
What do you
think they'd say

66
00:02:57,806 --> 00:02:59,372
if they knew you
threw me off a roof?

67
00:03:02,706 --> 00:03:03,700
Oh, Mike.

68
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,900
We could make so much
trouble for each other,

69
00:03:07,706 --> 00:03:09,680
or we can forget what
we think we know

70
00:03:09,687 --> 00:03:11,503
and be good neighbors.

71
00:03:13,707 --> 00:03:14,600
Your call.

72
00:03:18,437 --> 00:03:21,303
No, Orson Hodge
isn't exactly the guy

73
00:03:21,307 --> 00:03:22,842
I'd have picked
to head my family,

74
00:03:23,807 --> 00:03:25,102
but I'll give
him one thing...

75
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:29,333
He's got the smile
down cold.

78
00:04:13,207 --> 00:04:15,631
Take a drive down
any street in suburbia.

79
00:04:16,045 --> 00:04:17,210
You know what
you're gonna see?

80
00:04:18,266 --> 00:04:19,500
Desperate women.

81
00:04:20,406 --> 00:04:21,223
That's right.

82
00:04:21,807 --> 00:04:24,450
One unhappy housewife
after another,

83
00:04:25,868 --> 00:04:27,862
each completely
miserable...

84
00:04:29,605 --> 00:04:31,601
in her own
unique way.

85
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:34,303
But I don't want
to talk about them.

86
00:04:34,966 --> 00:04:37,702
No, I want to talk
about their men

87
00:04:38,308 --> 00:04:39,690
and what
happens to a guy

88
00:04:39,706 --> 00:04:43,103
when that special lady
in his life starts to lose it.

89
00:04:44,505 --> 00:04:46,141
Like my friend Carlos.

90
00:04:47,006 --> 00:04:48,350
He used to
have it all.

91
00:04:48,807 --> 00:04:50,803
Hot wife, tons of dough,

92
00:04:50,868 --> 00:04:52,400
then bam!

93
00:04:53,336 --> 00:04:55,663
She gets a divorce, and
he gets stuck with the bill.

94
00:04:57,008 --> 00:04:58,580
But does he sit
around and complain

95
00:04:58,606 --> 00:05:00,140
like your average
hausfrau?

96
00:05:00,506 --> 00:05:01,500
No, sir.

97
00:05:02,408 --> 00:05:04,220
He finds creative ways

98
00:05:04,226 --> 00:05:06,200
to get what you
can out of life.

99
00:05:10,558 --> 00:05:12,511
Hey, bro!
Where you off to?

100
00:05:12,515 --> 00:05:13,593
Oh, the hospital called.

101
00:05:13,606 --> 00:05:15,710
They found the stuff I had on
me the night of the accident.

102
00:05:17,126 --> 00:05:19,421
Coma, murder rap.
You've had a tough year, buddy.

103
00:05:19,735 --> 00:05:21,803
You know what you need?
Some pampering.

104
00:05:22,505 --> 00:05:24,060
Tomorrow you're checking
in to a nice hotel.

105
00:05:24,066 --> 00:05:25,810
Room service,
jacuzzi, my treat.

106
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,022
You trying to get me
out of the house?

107
00:05:28,968 --> 00:05:31,272
Mike, why would I...
Okay, there's this girl.

108
00:05:31,436 --> 00:05:32,262
I knew it.

109
00:05:32,577 --> 00:05:34,361
Dude, she's a dancer,

110
00:05:35,148 --> 00:05:37,372
and if her online profile's
any indication,

111
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:39,870
she's a complete freak. We're
talking serious Daddy issues.

112
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:41,810
Look, I'll stay in my room.
You'll never hear me.

113
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:43,552
Yeah, but
you'll hear me.

114
00:05:43,985 --> 00:05:47,072
I'm kind of exuberant by nature,
and when I haven't had it in a while,

115
00:05:47,087 --> 00:05:48,933
I kind of do this shrieking
thing that, I mean, is kinda...

116
00:05:48,936 --> 00:05:51,700
Okay. All right, I'll go.
Just stop talking.

117
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:54,360
Thanks, pal. I wouldn't want it
to put a weird spin on our friendship.

118
00:05:54,407 --> 00:05:55,331
Too late.

119
00:05:58,407 --> 00:05:59,841
This is my friend Tom.

120
00:06:00,406 --> 00:06:02,570
Have you heard what
he's been up to lately?

121
00:06:04,526 --> 00:06:07,192
This silly bastard opened up
his own pizza place.

122
00:06:07,606 --> 00:06:09,720
He thought that
if he was his own boss,

123
00:06:09,768 --> 00:06:11,990
he could sleep in
as late as he wanted,

124
00:06:13,408 --> 00:06:16,371
but the problem with that
logic is that married guys...

125
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,000
Hey. It's after 9:00.

126
00:06:18,326 --> 00:06:20,502
Come on, Thomasina,
it's time to get up.

127
00:06:20,706 --> 00:06:22,302
Are never
their own boss.

128
00:06:23,436 --> 00:06:25,041
Are you as
tired as I am?

129
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:28,641
More, but I'm tougher,
and I complain less.

130
00:06:29,285 --> 00:06:31,702
Not when you give birth,
and you do that a lot.

131
00:06:31,905 --> 00:06:32,882
Yeah?

132
00:06:33,706 --> 00:06:36,741
Before I forget, you got
a call from Chez Nous

133
00:06:36,746 --> 00:06:40,160
confirming your reservation
for our anniversary.

134
00:06:40,426 --> 00:06:42,732
You heard that?
I wanted that to be a surprise.

135
00:06:42,807 --> 00:06:45,163
Well, we've been going there
for the last seven years.

136
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:46,732
It's not exactly a surprise.

137
00:06:47,566 --> 00:06:49,682
Anyway, I hope
you don't mind,

138
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:51,600
but I canceled.

139
00:06:53,848 --> 00:06:55,611
You canceled? Why?

140
00:06:55,935 --> 00:06:59,342
Honestly, I just don't feel up
to going out this year.

141
00:06:59,355 --> 00:07:01,913
But it's our anniversary.
It's our ninth anniversary.

142
00:07:01,947 --> 00:07:03,093
Come on.
The "big nine."

143
00:07:03,308 --> 00:07:06,800
That's a year longer than my
Mom said we would be married.

144
00:07:06,803 --> 00:07:09,659
Come on.
We gotta party down.

145
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:11,890
I'm exhausted.

146
00:07:12,752 --> 00:07:17,127
Honestly, all I wanna do is pawn
the kids off on somebody else,

147
00:07:17,149 --> 00:07:19,510
take a long bath
and be in bed by 8:00.

148
00:07:21,617 --> 00:07:22,403
Okay.

149
00:07:22,445 --> 00:07:23,480
Oh, thank you.

150
00:07:23,945 --> 00:07:25,081
Thank you.
Thank you.

151
00:07:28,337 --> 00:07:29,003
Hold it.

152
00:07:30,776 --> 00:07:31,901
What about my sex?

153
00:07:32,667 --> 00:07:34,201
I always get sex
on our anniversary.

154
00:07:34,577 --> 00:07:36,733
We can still have sex.
Just try not to wake me.

155
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:43,971
This is Ian.

156
00:07:44,427 --> 00:07:45,661
Don't really
know the guy,

157
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:47,803
but Susan Mayer
seems to like him.

158
00:07:49,488 --> 00:07:51,730
The other night, he surprised
her with a proposal.

159
00:07:52,355 --> 00:07:55,303
She said yes, but he's
still a little skittish

160
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,383
about the competition.

161
00:07:58,647 --> 00:08:01,001
But Ian knows
that if love is war...

162
00:08:01,016 --> 00:08:03,620
Hey. Where were you off
to so early this morning?

163
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:06,802
Sometimes you gotta bring
out the big artillery.

164
00:08:09,816 --> 00:08:11,280
I should have had it
when I proposed.

165
00:08:11,285 --> 00:08:12,881
It's not very good
form, I know.

166
00:08:14,346 --> 00:08:17,402
Ian, oh,
you can't be serious.

167
00:08:17,808 --> 00:08:19,502
Oh, that's just...
too much.

168
00:08:19,506 --> 00:08:20,370
It's huge.

169
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:21,871
Well, we could go smaller.

170
00:08:22,218 --> 00:08:24,652
Oh, no. No one's saying smaller.
No, that's crazy talk.

171
00:08:29,346 --> 00:08:30,203
Rock me.

172
00:08:34,728 --> 00:08:37,501
Oh, my!
Oh, it's so beautiful!

173
00:08:39,395 --> 00:08:40,900
Oh, okay.
Okay, nobody move.

174
00:08:45,415 --> 00:08:46,282
I got it.

175
00:08:46,397 --> 00:08:47,851
I knew I should have
measured your finger.

176
00:08:47,857 --> 00:08:49,903
No, it's okay.
I can get it resized.

177
00:08:50,607 --> 00:08:52,191
You should go to the
jeweler's right now,

178
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:54,923
and when you get back, we can go and
look at some places for the reception.

179
00:08:55,145 --> 00:08:55,943
Reception?

180
00:08:55,945 --> 00:08:58,433
Yes, I was hoping we could pull
this together for next month.

181
00:08:59,058 --> 00:09:01,361
What's the rush?
Am I pregnant?

182
00:09:01,406 --> 00:09:02,193
Of course not.

183
00:09:02,206 --> 00:09:04,902
I just, well, I just can't
wait to be married to you.

184
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:05,901
Are you sure?

185
00:09:06,266 --> 00:09:07,752
'Cause you seem
a little anxious.

186
00:09:08,787 --> 00:09:10,853
What would I have
to be anxious about?

187
00:09:16,277 --> 00:09:17,583
Again,
sorry for the mix-up.

188
00:09:17,637 --> 00:09:19,040
If you could just
sign right here...

189
00:09:19,537 --> 00:09:20,930
I don't remember this.

190
00:09:21,385 --> 00:09:22,392
You sure that's mine?

191
00:09:22,435 --> 00:09:24,221
It was on you the night
you were admitted.

192
00:09:24,427 --> 00:09:25,523
I got hit by a car.

193
00:09:26,206 --> 00:09:28,012
I don't remember anything
about that night.

194
00:09:28,507 --> 00:09:30,721
Well, it looks like you were
gonna propose to someone.

195
00:09:33,507 --> 00:09:35,331
"Susan, be mine
forever. Mike."

196
00:09:38,577 --> 00:09:39,580
Does that ring a bell?

197
00:09:45,006 --> 00:09:45,943
Sure does.

198
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:49,423
Hey, Carlos.

199
00:09:51,676 --> 00:09:52,392
Hi.

200
00:09:52,735 --> 00:09:53,872
I have a little visitor

201
00:09:53,876 --> 00:09:55,702
that I thought you might
get a kick out of seeing.

202
00:09:56,366 --> 00:09:57,522
Remember my little boy?

203
00:09:58,307 --> 00:10:01,401
Hey, Travers. How you
doing? Put her there.

204
00:10:02,095 --> 00:10:03,172
I'm Carlos Solis.

205
00:10:03,387 --> 00:10:05,501
I think you came by my house
one time trick-or-treating.

206
00:10:05,757 --> 00:10:08,502
I remember.
You gave me a protein bar.

207
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:09,830
Right.

208
00:10:10,507 --> 00:10:13,100
Sorry. My wife
forgot to buy candy.

209
00:10:14,307 --> 00:10:16,321
Hey, is that football I hear?

210
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:17,612
Go on.
Check it out.

211
00:10:19,668 --> 00:10:21,190
I didn't know your son
was coming for a visit.

212
00:10:21,586 --> 00:10:22,662
Neither did I.

213
00:10:27,698 --> 00:10:30,702
His father just dumped him
here for four weeks

214
00:10:30,738 --> 00:10:33,893
so he could jet off with his
doctors without borders buddies

215
00:10:33,905 --> 00:10:36,101
and fix cleft
palates in Kenya.

216
00:10:36,146 --> 00:10:37,801
Selfish son of a bitch.

217
00:10:38,087 --> 00:10:39,443
Come on. I mean,
you barely even see him.

218
00:10:39,446 --> 00:10:41,362
It'll be fun.
A chance to bond.

219
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,112
Yeah, that's true,
but, um...

220
00:10:44,787 --> 00:10:47,013
I have this major
party tonight,

221
00:10:47,487 --> 00:10:51,111
and I was wondering if maybe you could
just keep an eye on him for a few hours.

222
00:10:51,465 --> 00:10:53,041
Sorry. I can't tonight.

223
00:10:53,128 --> 00:10:55,111
Come on! You love kids.

224
00:10:55,116 --> 00:10:56,692
I mean, didn't you rent
that chinese chick

225
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:58,163
so that you could have
one of your own?

226
00:10:58,436 --> 00:10:59,672
I have a date, too,

227
00:10:59,745 --> 00:11:02,201
with a chick so hot I had to turn off
the smoke alarms in my house.

228
00:11:03,508 --> 00:11:04,292
Fine.

229
00:11:05,227 --> 00:11:07,022
Travers, come on.
Let's go.

230
00:11:09,428 --> 00:11:12,072
This isn't
a child-friendly house.

231
00:11:15,745 --> 00:11:16,600
Bye, Travers.

232
00:11:28,656 --> 00:11:29,902
Wow, she's a looker.

233
00:11:30,008 --> 00:11:30,900
I'll say.

234
00:11:33,517 --> 00:11:35,111
Hey, what time's
that fund-raiser?

235
00:11:35,115 --> 00:11:36,121
You got an hour.

236
00:11:37,107 --> 00:11:37,903
Well, then...

237
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:39,710
Let's have
a little fun.

238
00:11:53,506 --> 00:11:54,732
Look what you did!

239
00:11:54,775 --> 00:11:56,682
Don't yell at me.
I'm just a passenger.

240
00:11:56,808 --> 00:11:58,191
Well, your driver's an idiot!

241
00:11:58,207 --> 00:11:59,702
Hey, it's not
Clyde's fault.

242
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:02,560
I mean, what man wouldn't be
distracted by such beauty?

243
00:12:03,308 --> 00:12:04,610
Now you're
hitting on me?

244
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:07,843
I was talking
about the car.

245
00:12:08,986 --> 00:12:10,562
Well, good.
I'm glad you like it,

246
00:12:10,565 --> 00:12:12,001
'cause you're gonna
pay to fix this.

247
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,302
Of course.
$5,000 cover it?

248
00:12:15,258 --> 00:12:16,140
Five?

249
00:12:17,285 --> 00:12:19,301
Well, sure, I guess.

250
00:12:19,636 --> 00:12:21,402
I'd rather not file
an insurance claim.

251
00:12:21,726 --> 00:12:23,912
My opponent could find out
and try to make me look bad.

252
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:24,880
Opponent?

253
00:12:24,885 --> 00:12:26,501
Oh, well, I guess you
don't read the papers.

254
00:12:26,687 --> 00:12:28,803
I'm running for mayor.
My name's Victor Lang,

255
00:12:29,387 --> 00:12:30,791
and I hope I can
count on your vote.

256
00:12:32,846 --> 00:12:34,592
I think I'd rather vote
for the other guy.

257
00:12:34,856 --> 00:12:36,443
You know, the one
who didn't wreck my car?

258
00:12:43,468 --> 00:12:44,770
you're off
your game.

259
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,052
You didn't even get
a phone number.

260
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:48,101
Oh, don't worry.
I'll be seeing her again.

261
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:50,032
How can you
be so sure?

262
00:12:50,877 --> 00:12:51,992
I didn't sign
the check.

263
00:13:04,607 --> 00:13:05,660
What the hell
are you doing?

264
00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:06,592
We neeto talk.

265
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,891
No, we don't. Get out.

266
00:13:08,095 --> 00:13:09,490
Please. You won't
return my calls.

267
00:13:09,507 --> 00:13:10,403
Well, I've been busy.

268
00:13:10,407 --> 00:13:12,371
Plus, my Mom caught you
naked on top of my friend.

269
00:13:14,745 --> 00:13:17,901
Just read this, and if you
still don't want to talk to me,

270
00:13:18,446 --> 00:13:19,562
then I'll never
bother you again.

271
00:13:21,108 --> 00:13:22,102
Fine, I'll read it,

272
00:13:22,105 --> 00:13:23,781
but only if you get out
of the car right now.

273
00:13:24,107 --> 00:13:25,911
Now? But the hot
wax is starting.

274
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:28,082
I know.
Ticktock.

275
00:13:41,478 --> 00:13:42,592
You're still in there?

276
00:13:42,796 --> 00:13:44,482
How long does it take
to pluck that unibrow?

277
00:13:44,656 --> 00:13:45,673
Leave me alone!

278
00:13:46,218 --> 00:13:48,390
Danielle, I have to be
at work in ten minutes.

279
00:13:48,407 --> 00:13:50,473
Now can I please just come
in and brush my teeth?

280
00:13:50,807 --> 00:13:53,652
I'm having a really
bad day, all right?

281
00:13:53,657 --> 00:13:55,000
Just go away!

282
00:13:55,408 --> 00:13:56,692
I'm gonna have
a really bad day, too.

283
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:59,090
I tend not to get tipped
when my breath stinks.

284
00:14:01,767 --> 00:14:02,691
I'm pregnant.

285
00:14:16,108 --> 00:14:17,903
Mike, what are
you doing here?

286
00:14:18,008 --> 00:14:21,951
Oh, hey, I'm just
selling some old jewelry.

287
00:14:22,137 --> 00:14:23,251
I spoke to my manager.

288
00:14:23,908 --> 00:14:25,710
There's gonna be a charge
to remove the inscription,

289
00:14:25,718 --> 00:14:27,912
but we can refund you
for the engagement ring.

290
00:14:29,246 --> 00:14:30,302
That'll be fine.

291
00:14:33,468 --> 00:14:34,991
Was that the ring
that you bought for...

292
00:14:35,148 --> 00:14:35,821
Yeah.

293
00:14:37,828 --> 00:14:38,632
Can I help you?

294
00:14:40,155 --> 00:14:42,441
Yeah, I have
to get this sized.

295
00:14:42,497 --> 00:14:43,603
It's a little loose.

296
00:14:43,705 --> 00:14:44,782
Do you know
your size?

297
00:14:44,976 --> 00:14:45,532
No.

298
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,353
Congratulations,
by the way.

299
00:14:49,838 --> 00:14:51,510
Ian... seems great.

300
00:14:52,717 --> 00:14:53,402
Thanks.

301
00:14:54,037 --> 00:14:55,542
I can't find my sizer.

302
00:14:56,746 --> 00:14:57,613
Here.

303
00:14:58,717 --> 00:15:00,182
-Try this one.
-Oh, no...

304
00:15:03,185 --> 00:15:04,101
How's that fit?

305
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:11,821
It's perfect.

306
00:15:12,338 --> 00:15:13,052
Great.

307
00:15:19,326 --> 00:15:20,442
Can I have it back now?

308
00:15:22,596 --> 00:15:23,693
Sorry.

309
00:15:33,968 --> 00:15:36,762
Hey, you've got a cousin in
the limo business, don't you?

310
00:15:36,946 --> 00:15:40,370
Actually, I've got a cousin In the "limo
as a front for prostitution" business.

311
00:15:41,225 --> 00:15:42,431
He's in jail.
Why do you ask?

312
00:15:42,598 --> 00:15:45,753
Oh, I'm just planning a big
thing for my anniversary.

313
00:15:45,808 --> 00:15:48,132
Aren't you just gonna go to Chez
Boring, like you do every year?

314
00:15:48,178 --> 00:15:48,820
No.

315
00:15:50,025 --> 00:15:52,491
Lynette's so over that, she was
ready to bag the whole night,

316
00:15:52,497 --> 00:15:54,043
so got me thinking.

317
00:15:55,258 --> 00:15:57,890
Nine years.
Time to shake things up.

318
00:15:58,475 --> 00:16:01,540
Now I'm planning the greatest
anniversary of all time.

319
00:16:04,025 --> 00:16:04,830
Check this out.

320
00:16:05,807 --> 00:16:08,063
Lynette's gonna open the
door to find a limo driver

321
00:16:08,065 --> 00:16:09,820
with a dozen
roses and a card.

322
00:16:10,058 --> 00:16:12,983
The card is gonna tell
her to go with the guy,

323
00:16:13,558 --> 00:16:15,003
not ask any questions.

324
00:16:15,365 --> 00:16:16,830
He'll drive her
out to the country.

325
00:16:16,937 --> 00:16:18,072
He'll drop her off,

326
00:16:19,007 --> 00:16:20,452
Then drive away.

327
00:16:20,957 --> 00:16:23,131
Just as she is starting
to freak out,

328
00:16:23,588 --> 00:16:25,932
I show up in a
horse-drawn carriage,

329
00:16:27,508 --> 00:16:29,302
which takes us up
to Whitman's bluff,

330
00:16:29,345 --> 00:16:30,601
where we eat
a catered dinner,

331
00:16:30,955 --> 00:16:32,633
listen to
a professional violinist.

332
00:16:34,306 --> 00:16:36,430
Afterwards,
when we come home,

333
00:16:37,026 --> 00:16:39,080
I'm sure Lynette will think
of a way to thank me.

334
00:16:41,576 --> 00:16:43,382
You're one romantic
son of a bitch.

335
00:16:44,576 --> 00:16:45,762
I have my moments.

336
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:50,270
Of course I'm not questioning
mayor Johnson's family values.

337
00:16:50,295 --> 00:16:52,631
I'm sure they're what prompted him
to put his sisters, brother-in-law

338
00:16:52,638 --> 00:16:54,361
and six of his cousins
on the city payroll.

339
00:16:59,498 --> 00:17:02,000
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to cut this interview short.

340
00:17:02,058 --> 00:17:04,720
I have some very important
business to attend to.

341
00:17:05,867 --> 00:17:06,940
Ms. Solis,

342
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:08,933
What a nice surprise.

343
00:17:09,817 --> 00:17:11,883
Are you here to make
a contribution to my campaign?

344
00:17:12,146 --> 00:17:13,162
Not exactly.

345
00:17:14,428 --> 00:17:16,662
Oh, no.
Did I forget to s...

346
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:18,290
I'm so sorry.

347
00:17:19,796 --> 00:17:20,723
Let me make
it up to you.

348
00:17:21,005 --> 00:17:22,060
I'll take you to dinner.
My treat.

349
00:17:22,077 --> 00:17:24,300
It would be your treat.
I'm a hot date.

350
00:17:24,595 --> 00:17:25,652
What's in it for me?

351
00:17:26,876 --> 00:17:28,900
Well, I have, uh,
"an ingratiating wit,

352
00:17:29,706 --> 00:17:30,872
trustworthy smile,"

353
00:17:31,377 --> 00:17:32,741
According to the
"Plainview Herald."

354
00:17:33,296 --> 00:17:34,742
Yeah. Check, please.

355
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:40,611
My family also owns
Lang Enterprises.

356
00:17:42,398 --> 00:17:43,602
Dad's worth a...

357
00:17:44,177 --> 00:17:45,181
few hundred mil.

358
00:17:48,848 --> 00:17:50,442
Well, a girl's gotta eat.

359
00:17:53,128 --> 00:17:55,241
Great. I'll take
you to Cucina.

360
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:56,940
There's no place
harder to get into.

361
00:17:58,305 --> 00:17:59,572
That's what you think.

362
00:18:03,158 --> 00:18:05,702
Mike, this is completely
unnecessary.

363
00:18:05,765 --> 00:18:07,750
My paying for your
lawyer was a favor.

364
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:08,742
It wasn't a loan.

365
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:11,301
I appreciate it, but I just
don't like to owe anybody.

366
00:18:11,305 --> 00:18:13,371
Well, I just don't want you
to have any trouble

367
00:18:13,378 --> 00:18:14,602
getting back
on your feet.

368
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:17,002
No, it's fine. I had a windfall.

369
00:18:17,385 --> 00:18:18,853
The hospital
gave me back

370
00:18:18,858 --> 00:18:20,962
an engagement ring
I didn't even know I had.

371
00:18:21,096 --> 00:18:22,602
Oh, really?
So you sold it?

372
00:18:23,088 --> 00:18:25,340
You should have kept it
till the right girl comes along.

373
00:18:26,386 --> 00:18:27,230
Well, I...

374
00:18:27,665 --> 00:18:29,243
couldn't give this ring
to just anyone.

375
00:18:29,735 --> 00:18:31,701
Oh, right, the, um,
the inscription.

376
00:18:36,795 --> 00:18:38,043
How'd you know
it was inscribed?

377
00:18:38,855 --> 00:18:41,603
Well, isn't that the custom?
I just assumed it was.

378
00:18:44,877 --> 00:18:47,523
Well, listen, I've got
to get some fresh rags.

379
00:18:47,777 --> 00:18:49,553
Thanks for the check.
I'll see you around.

380
00:18:54,618 --> 00:18:55,882
Oh, you can
count on it.

381
00:18:57,735 --> 00:18:59,040
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

382
00:18:59,635 --> 00:19:01,463
I peed on five
different sticks.

383
00:19:02,986 --> 00:19:05,303
Would you put that burrito away?
It's making me nauseous.

384
00:19:05,675 --> 00:19:06,693
Join the club.

385
00:19:07,497 --> 00:19:09,893
Look, I know your parents are
religious, but I know this clinic.

386
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:11,201
Absotely not!

387
00:19:11,408 --> 00:19:12,750
So what other choice
do we have?

388
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:15,000
Well, gee, you could,
like, uh, marry me?

389
00:19:15,158 --> 00:19:17,431
Marry you?!
I can't stand you.

390
00:19:17,936 --> 00:19:20,023
Nice way to talk to the
mother of your child!

391
00:19:21,288 --> 00:19:22,160
Oh, God.

392
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,413
Bathroom.

393
00:19:28,318 --> 00:19:28,912
Hey.

394
00:19:29,546 --> 00:19:30,183
Julie.

395
00:19:30,325 --> 00:19:32,232
Hi. Uh, hey.

396
00:19:32,345 --> 00:19:34,101
Your door was open.
Can I come in?

397
00:19:36,316 --> 00:19:37,301
What are you
doing here?

398
00:19:37,507 --> 00:19:38,542
I read your letter.

399
00:19:41,268 --> 00:19:43,552
I had no idea
it would be so sweet.

400
00:19:44,377 --> 00:19:46,042
I could really tell
it came from your heart.

401
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,621
I'm embarrassed
to admit, I...

402
00:19:50,725 --> 00:19:51,553
cried.

403
00:19:54,455 --> 00:19:57,620
My aunt Edie sort of
tied one on last night.

404
00:20:00,347 --> 00:20:02,353
Anyway, I guess
what I'm saying is...

405
00:20:04,007 --> 00:20:04,651
Okay.

406
00:20:05,028 --> 00:20:06,153
"Okay"?

407
00:20:07,285 --> 00:20:08,212
We can try again.

408
00:20:08,745 --> 00:20:10,131
Julie, that's great!

409
00:20:10,326 --> 00:20:11,912
And I want to
talk about this,

410
00:20:11,938 --> 00:20:13,932
but I just kinda need
to take care of my aunt.

411
00:20:14,376 --> 00:20:15,450
Can I call you
tomorrow?

412
00:20:15,766 --> 00:20:16,481
Sure.

413
00:20:19,538 --> 00:20:21,010
We're gonna have
to take things slow,

414
00:20:21,548 --> 00:20:23,702
'cause it'll be a while
before I can trust you again.

415
00:20:26,087 --> 00:20:27,102
I understand.

416
00:20:34,016 --> 00:20:35,760
Thank you, Bruno.
The veal was excellent.

417
00:20:36,016 --> 00:20:37,992
-Feel like dessert?
-No, thank you. I'm stuffed.

418
00:20:39,045 --> 00:20:40,551
Then let me
propose a toast.

419
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:42,523
To a delightful evening,

420
00:20:42,727 --> 00:20:44,773
and to the happy accident
that brought us together.

421
00:20:45,735 --> 00:20:48,201
Victor, you are
so full of crap.

422
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:49,653
What?

423
00:20:50,245 --> 00:20:51,272
There was no accident.

424
00:20:51,277 --> 00:20:53,563
I know you told your
chauffeur to ram my car.

425
00:20:54,148 --> 00:20:55,020
Why would I do that?

426
00:20:55,926 --> 00:20:58,493
For the same reason you
"forgot" to sign the check.

427
00:20:58,878 --> 00:21:00,492
You've been working me
since the second we met,

428
00:21:00,497 --> 00:21:02,383
and I've been on to you
every step of the way.

429
00:21:05,257 --> 00:21:06,643
What? What's so funny?

430
00:21:07,055 --> 00:21:08,903
I just called you
a manipulative jerk.

431
00:21:09,425 --> 00:21:10,813
I think
I underestimated you.

432
00:21:12,457 --> 00:21:15,341
I also think this relationship
just got a lot more interesting.

433
00:21:16,017 --> 00:21:18,543
There is no relationship.
This is our last date.

434
00:21:18,927 --> 00:21:20,043
You didn't have any fun?

435
00:21:21,077 --> 00:21:22,081
It was okay.

436
00:21:22,318 --> 00:21:25,801
You know, you told a few good
jokes. you're sorta charming.

437
00:21:25,998 --> 00:21:28,861
You're not bad-looking.
I just think I can do better.

438
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:31,152
Have you not noticed?
I'm a catch.

439
00:21:31,557 --> 00:21:34,211
I have noticed,
and I'm throwing you back.

440
00:21:36,005 --> 00:21:37,383
Gaby, let me tell
you something.

441
00:21:38,195 --> 00:21:39,300
For my whole life,

442
00:21:39,428 --> 00:21:41,830
whenever I've truly
wanted something,

443
00:21:42,408 --> 00:21:43,503
I've always gotten it.

444
00:21:44,168 --> 00:21:47,633
And tonight, right around the time
you were calling me a manipulative jerk,

445
00:21:47,888 --> 00:21:51,661
I decided
I truly want you.

446
00:21:53,107 --> 00:21:54,163
So brace yourself.

447
00:21:55,006 --> 00:21:56,643
The chase is on.

448
00:21:57,325 --> 00:21:59,353
You can chase me
all you want,

449
00:21:59,498 --> 00:22:00,673
But trust me,

450
00:22:01,468 --> 00:22:03,003
I'm way too
fast for you.

451
00:22:08,845 --> 00:22:09,623
Bruno...

452
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:13,353
I'm gonna
marry that girl.

453
00:22:18,888 --> 00:22:19,672
Can I just say
something?

454
00:22:19,696 --> 00:22:21,502
You are way hotter
than your online profile.

455
00:22:21,546 --> 00:22:24,252
So many guys say that.

456
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:34,750
What's wrong?

457
00:22:35,475 --> 00:22:36,840
Oh, my friend's
kid is out there.

458
00:22:41,417 --> 00:22:43,170
Hey, I got an idea.

459
00:22:43,485 --> 00:22:44,953
Let's go upstairs.

460
00:22:55,226 --> 00:22:56,490
I should warn you...

461
00:22:57,156 --> 00:23:00,703
My therapist says
I'm sexually compulsive.

462
00:23:01,578 --> 00:23:03,483
This could take hours.

463
00:23:04,195 --> 00:23:06,960
Whatever your issues are,
we will work them out together.

464
00:23:14,607 --> 00:23:16,860
It's almost 11:00. What is
he doing out therby himself?

465
00:23:17,665 --> 00:23:19,900
I'm sure his folks
know he's out there.

466
00:23:21,595 --> 00:23:23,732
Now relax.

467
00:23:33,868 --> 00:23:36,303
I'm so sorry. I will be
right back. I promise.

468
00:23:40,455 --> 00:23:41,700
Hey, Travers, what are
you doing out here?

469
00:23:41,735 --> 00:23:42,483
Where's your Mom?

470
00:23:42,715 --> 00:23:44,292
She had to go
visit a sick friend.

471
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:51,252
Come on.

472
00:23:52,805 --> 00:23:56,222
No way. I didn't come over here
to babysit some little brat.

473
00:23:56,276 --> 00:23:58,391
-He can hear you.
-I don't care.

474
00:23:59,977 --> 00:24:02,981
Look, his mother's bound
to be home soon, all right?

475
00:24:03,795 --> 00:24:05,741
Then we can pick up
where we left off.

476
00:24:06,235 --> 00:24:06,931
Forget it.

477
00:24:07,186 --> 00:24:09,550
I'm officially
no longer in the mood.

478
00:24:21,357 --> 00:24:22,801
Sorry I ruined
your date.

479
00:24:24,205 --> 00:24:25,243
That's okay.

480
00:24:26,218 --> 00:24:27,603
She was
a very bad lady

481
00:24:28,045 --> 00:24:30,453
who wanted to do very,
very bad things to me.

482
00:24:34,296 --> 00:24:35,330
Night, Raoul.

483
00:24:53,997 --> 00:24:55,790
-Where the hell have you been?
-Oh, I, uh...

484
00:24:57,208 --> 00:24:59,400
ducked out...
just for an hour.

485
00:24:59,445 --> 00:25:00,363
That's funny,

486
00:25:00,605 --> 00:25:02,662
'cause I found Travers wandering
the streets three hours ago.

487
00:25:02,795 --> 00:25:04,401
Look, he was
fine when I left.

488
00:25:04,996 --> 00:25:06,672
I just didn't know
he'd go outside.

489
00:25:06,706 --> 00:25:08,302
Yeah, you never know what
an 8 year old's gonna do.

490
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:09,710
That's why
you supervise him.

491
00:25:09,906 --> 00:25:13,761
Hey, you don't get to judge me.
You don't have a kid.

492
00:25:13,806 --> 00:25:15,023
Well, if I did,

493
00:25:15,066 --> 00:25:17,180
I'd treat him a hell of
a lot better than you do.

494
00:25:17,835 --> 00:25:19,472
Thank God he lives with
his father. I mean, come on.

495
00:25:19,477 --> 00:25:20,982
What kind of
mother are you?

496
00:25:26,008 --> 00:25:27,491
If you are done
lecturing me,

497
00:25:27,495 --> 00:25:29,902
I would like
my son now.

498
00:25:30,377 --> 00:25:31,412
He's asleep.

499
00:25:32,346 --> 00:25:33,582
Come and get him
in the morning...

500
00:25:34,777 --> 00:25:35,782
When you're sober.

501
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:46,461
Hey, buddy!

502
00:25:47,375 --> 00:25:48,581
Your Mom's here for ya.

503
00:25:51,455 --> 00:25:53,301
I know you think
I'm a terrible person.

504
00:25:54,245 --> 00:25:55,263
I never said that.

505
00:25:56,266 --> 00:25:59,103
Terrible mother, terrible person.
It's the same thing.

506
00:26:00,345 --> 00:26:02,982
Because no matter
what else she does,

507
00:26:04,006 --> 00:26:06,323
if a woman isn't a good mother,
she's a failure, right?

508
00:26:12,645 --> 00:26:13,763
Look, um...

509
00:26:15,378 --> 00:26:19,060
When I had Travers,
I knew I was in over my head,

510
00:26:19,486 --> 00:26:21,570
and when Charles
and I split, I...

511
00:26:23,266 --> 00:26:24,710
I gave him custody.

512
00:26:26,878 --> 00:26:30,020
Because I wanted my son
to have the best life possible.

513
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:34,833
And that doesn't make me
a good mother, but...

514
00:26:36,808 --> 00:26:39,171
I like to think it makes
me a realistic one.

515
00:26:43,825 --> 00:26:44,730
Hey, Mom.

516
00:26:45,475 --> 00:26:46,592
Hey, champ.

517
00:26:47,517 --> 00:26:48,540
I missed you.

518
00:26:49,408 --> 00:26:50,801
I missed you, too.

519
00:26:51,607 --> 00:26:52,581
Guess what?

520
00:26:53,127 --> 00:26:55,710
I've got so many fun things
for you to do today.

521
00:26:56,205 --> 00:26:57,062
Cool.

522
00:26:57,507 --> 00:26:58,562
Thanks for
the ice cream.

523
00:26:58,607 --> 00:26:59,590
My pleasure.

524
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:01,443
I'll see you, little man.

525
00:27:01,905 --> 00:27:02,702
Hey.

526
00:27:04,907 --> 00:27:06,832
Travers said he's
staying at least a month.

527
00:27:07,735 --> 00:27:08,420
Yeah.

528
00:27:09,485 --> 00:27:11,881
So if you ever need
a babysitter, just yell.

529
00:27:15,556 --> 00:27:16,673
I appreciate that.

530
00:27:21,256 --> 00:27:23,280
Hey! Wait for me!

531
00:27:23,867 --> 00:27:25,500
No, I don't want
a viola player.

532
00:27:25,508 --> 00:27:28,161
I asked for a violinist. I don't
even know what a viola is.

533
00:27:29,416 --> 00:27:30,620
Oh, it's just
a big violin?

534
00:27:31,546 --> 00:27:33,162
Okay. Yeah, sure.

535
00:27:33,468 --> 00:27:34,731
Okay, I'll see you at 8:00.

536
00:27:36,416 --> 00:27:37,183
What was that?

537
00:27:38,597 --> 00:27:41,223
It's just a little
surprise, okay?

538
00:27:41,338 --> 00:27:43,830
-Let it go.
-"Let it go", that's cute.

539
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:45,920
Start talkin'.

540
00:27:46,656 --> 00:27:49,080
I planned a little something
for our anniversary.

541
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,033
That is all
I'm gonna say.

542
00:27:53,018 --> 00:27:55,101
Okay. Okay. Okay.

543
00:27:55,316 --> 00:27:57,970
If we're doing this,
I need to buy you something.

544
00:27:58,247 --> 00:27:59,960
What do you want? You don't
have to buy me anything.

545
00:28:00,005 --> 00:28:01,551
Well, you didn't have
to plan anything,

546
00:28:01,565 --> 00:28:03,673
but you did, even though
we had an agreement.

547
00:28:03,936 --> 00:28:05,881
You like ties?
You're getting a tie.

548
00:28:06,035 --> 00:28:07,603
What are you getting?

549
00:28:07,608 --> 00:28:10,252
I have been dragging my ass
all day, and the only thought

550
00:28:10,257 --> 00:28:12,582
that's kept me going
is the hot bath,

551
00:28:12,727 --> 00:28:16,200
and now I have do my hair
and shave my legs.

552
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,603
So what do you
want to do, Lynette?

553
00:28:17,606 --> 00:28:19,140
Just tell me what you want.

554
00:28:19,148 --> 00:28:20,891
I told you what I want.

555
00:28:21,746 --> 00:28:25,272
Hot bath, bed early,
but you choose not to listen.

556
00:28:26,666 --> 00:28:28,780
Well, okay, I guess I can
just cancel the whole thing.

557
00:28:28,788 --> 00:28:30,441
You can have your
dream evening alone,

558
00:28:30,445 --> 00:28:32,533
and I'll get up a poker
game or something.

559
00:28:32,636 --> 00:28:33,770
Thank you.

560
00:28:35,845 --> 00:28:39,361
Hey. You know what? I've been
dragging my ass all day, too,

561
00:28:39,366 --> 00:28:40,672
and you know what
got me through it?

562
00:28:40,988 --> 00:28:43,182
The idea of doing
something special with you.

563
00:28:45,416 --> 00:28:46,550
Happy anniversary.

564
00:28:53,705 --> 00:28:55,342
All right. I'm off
to join your mother.

565
00:28:56,155 --> 00:28:58,233
The hotel number's on the fridge
in case there's a problem.

566
00:28:58,235 --> 00:28:59,991
Bree said her cell phone
isn't getting good reception.

567
00:29:01,466 --> 00:29:04,313
Actually, we kinda
already have a problem.

568
00:29:04,546 --> 00:29:05,962
Well, I'm already
late for my flight.

569
00:29:06,005 --> 00:29:07,991
Can this wait a few
weeks till we're back?

570
00:29:08,237 --> 00:29:10,102
Yeah, this could
wait a few weeks.

571
00:29:10,106 --> 00:29:10,740
Oh, good.

572
00:29:10,825 --> 00:29:12,990
I mean, heck, this particular
problem could wait...

573
00:29:13,638 --> 00:29:14,623
nine months.

574
00:29:19,315 --> 00:29:20,043
Good Lord.

575
00:29:22,406 --> 00:29:23,333
How was your bath?

576
00:29:23,376 --> 00:29:24,560
Oh, I couldn't relax.

577
00:29:24,606 --> 00:29:28,292
I just kept replaying the fight
I had with Tom in my head.

578
00:29:28,547 --> 00:29:30,662
Well, at least your husband
tries to be romantic.

579
00:29:31,406 --> 00:29:33,701
Every anniversary, Gilbert
bought me an appliance.

580
00:29:33,765 --> 00:29:35,891
The last one, he gave
me a vacuum cleaner.

581
00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:38,051
He died two weeks later.

582
00:29:38,817 --> 00:29:39,780
I didn't cry.

583
00:29:44,335 --> 00:29:45,303
Who could that be?

584
00:29:45,747 --> 00:29:46,333
Here.

585
00:29:49,718 --> 00:29:50,821
All right. Here's
what we're thinking.

586
00:29:51,548 --> 00:29:54,911
Clearly, the idea of the two of
you getting married is ridiculous.

587
00:29:56,356 --> 00:29:57,933
So what do you
want me to do?

588
00:29:58,035 --> 00:29:59,261
Glad you asked.

589
00:30:00,306 --> 00:30:02,060
Bree and I have decided

590
00:30:02,065 --> 00:30:04,571
that Danielle will join
us on our heymoon.

591
00:30:04,975 --> 00:30:08,630
When we return, we'll tell our friends
she's decided to study abroad.

592
00:30:08,805 --> 00:30:11,581
Once the baby is born and
adopted by a suitable family,

593
00:30:11,808 --> 00:30:12,901
she'll come home.

594
00:30:16,265 --> 00:30:17,132
What about me?

595
00:30:17,338 --> 00:30:18,430
You leave.

596
00:30:18,965 --> 00:30:19,763
Leave?

597
00:30:19,878 --> 00:30:22,013
Get out of Fairview
and don't tell a soul why,

598
00:30:22,336 --> 00:30:24,261
-Not even your aunt.
-I can't do that.

599
00:30:24,358 --> 00:30:25,032
Why not?

600
00:30:25,036 --> 00:30:26,490
Because I've got
responsibilities here.

601
00:30:26,506 --> 00:30:27,611
People are counting on me.

602
00:30:27,638 --> 00:30:29,032
Yeah, well, you should
have thought of that

603
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:30,690
before you impregnated
my stepdaughter.

604
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:32,122
I said I'm not leaving!

605
00:30:33,177 --> 00:30:34,501
Easy there, turbo.

606
00:30:35,808 --> 00:30:36,863
We'll be right back.

607
00:30:43,825 --> 00:30:45,343
So who exactly
is counting on you?

608
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:47,751
Julie Mayer, maybe?

609
00:30:48,016 --> 00:30:49,420
She gave me
another chance.

610
00:30:49,677 --> 00:30:51,410
I can't leave if I've still
got a shot with her.

611
00:30:51,537 --> 00:30:54,242
And what's gonna happen when Julie
finds out you knocked up my sister?

612
00:30:54,488 --> 00:30:57,202
Didn't your stepdad just say no
one's gonna find out about that?

613
00:30:58,877 --> 00:30:59,480
Okay.

614
00:31:00,676 --> 00:31:01,600
Try this.

615
00:31:02,568 --> 00:31:03,721
Julie's a nice girl,

616
00:31:04,547 --> 00:31:06,303
and you, well...

617
00:31:07,415 --> 00:31:08,502
you're a dog.

618
00:31:12,888 --> 00:31:13,860
No knock.

619
00:31:14,976 --> 00:31:16,561
I'm a dog lover myself,

620
00:31:18,038 --> 00:31:19,463
but Julie deserves better.

621
00:31:20,498 --> 00:31:22,303
You know you'll just
end up cheating on her.

622
00:31:22,766 --> 00:31:24,051
No, I won't
hurt her again.

623
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:27,013
Sure you will.

624
00:31:28,905 --> 00:31:30,431
Not right away.

625
00:31:30,958 --> 00:31:32,732
Maybe you'll hold
out for six months,

626
00:31:33,367 --> 00:31:35,732
but then it'll hurt
her even more.

627
00:31:36,847 --> 00:31:37,850
Am I wrong?

628
00:31:41,096 --> 00:31:42,563
You just have
to ask yourself

629
00:31:43,025 --> 00:31:45,033
if you can be the kind of
guy she needs you to be.

630
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:47,482
If you can't...

631
00:31:49,117 --> 00:31:50,121
walk away.

632
00:31:57,325 --> 00:31:59,463
Beer is on the
house, guys.

633
00:31:59,506 --> 00:32:02,863
Drink fast, get stupid,
lose money.

634
00:32:03,308 --> 00:32:04,001
Mike!

635
00:32:04,337 --> 00:32:06,123
Hey. How's it going, buddy?

636
00:32:06,708 --> 00:32:08,763
Hey, you know,
uh, Orson, right?

637
00:32:09,017 --> 00:32:09,821
Oh, yeah.

638
00:32:10,108 --> 00:32:11,141
Hey, neighbor.

639
00:32:11,276 --> 00:32:14,372
Hey, so let's get started, huh?
5-card stud? Two dollars ante?

640
00:32:15,828 --> 00:32:16,971
Good evening, gentlemen.

641
00:32:17,137 --> 00:32:17,981
Ian!

642
00:32:19,098 --> 00:32:20,982
Hey... Ian.

643
00:32:21,487 --> 00:32:22,753
Nice to see you, Mike.

644
00:32:27,496 --> 00:32:29,073
What is fish and
chips doing here?

645
00:32:30,006 --> 00:32:31,392
Susan asked me
to include him.

646
00:32:31,406 --> 00:32:32,941
Said he always wanted
to learn how to play poker.

647
00:32:32,946 --> 00:32:35,663
So we're going to give him
some very expensive lessons.

648
00:32:36,617 --> 00:32:39,581
Be careful. He already
knows how to bluff.

649
00:32:45,506 --> 00:32:46,131
Hey.

650
00:32:47,307 --> 00:32:48,841
Hey. How's it going?

651
00:32:49,285 --> 00:32:50,612
Good. Good, uh...

652
00:32:51,735 --> 00:32:54,342
Just wanted to tell you, I have
to leave town for a while.

653
00:32:54,966 --> 00:32:56,660
Really?
Is something wrong?

654
00:32:57,237 --> 00:32:59,112
No, no, no.
It's just family stuff.

655
00:33:02,297 --> 00:33:04,282
I don't know exactly
when I'll be back.

656
00:33:05,695 --> 00:33:06,892
It could be a while,
though.

657
00:33:12,776 --> 00:33:13,451
Okay.

658
00:33:14,187 --> 00:33:15,552
I just want you
to know that...

659
00:33:16,368 --> 00:33:18,940
It means a lot that you were willing
to give me a second chance.

660
00:33:21,695 --> 00:33:23,460
You're, like, the only person
that's ever done that.

661
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:27,210
Austin...
What's going on?

662
00:33:28,557 --> 00:33:30,440
Nothing, uh,
it's just...

663
00:33:32,145 --> 00:33:33,083
I have to go.

664
00:33:36,095 --> 00:33:37,083
Good-bye, Julie.

665
00:33:40,635 --> 00:33:41,382
Austin!

666
00:34:04,517 --> 00:34:05,432
I'll raise you.

667
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:10,601
Out.

668
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:13,851
Ah, another courageous
move for "foldilocks."

669
00:34:13,896 --> 00:34:16,011
All right. I'll call you.

670
00:34:17,815 --> 00:34:18,753
Flush, king high.

671
00:34:21,007 --> 00:34:23,252
Full house,
7s and knaves.

672
00:34:23,376 --> 00:34:26,453
Jacks.
We call them jacks.

673
00:34:26,517 --> 00:34:29,231
Boy, this is your
lucky room.

674
00:34:29,517 --> 00:34:31,441
Yes, I heard about your
engagement the other night.

675
00:34:31,445 --> 00:34:32,523
Congratulations.

676
00:34:32,995 --> 00:34:35,232
Yeah, about that, Ian,

677
00:34:35,735 --> 00:34:39,510
Was that proposal spontaneous,
or did you have it all planned?

678
00:34:39,737 --> 00:34:41,121
It was entirely planned.

679
00:34:41,658 --> 00:34:43,542
I thought it would be
the ideal occasion.

680
00:34:44,246 --> 00:34:45,952
Well, if it was planned,
why didn't you have a ring?

681
00:34:47,175 --> 00:34:49,851
Well, I thought Susan might
like to choose the ring herself.

682
00:34:50,408 --> 00:34:51,523
Ante up, boys.

683
00:34:51,686 --> 00:34:54,372
So why'd she pick a ring
that was too big for her?

684
00:34:56,847 --> 00:34:58,000
How did you
know that?

685
00:34:59,037 --> 00:35:01,202
Guys, guys, guys, guys,
we came here to play cards.

686
00:35:01,207 --> 00:35:02,520
Why are we talking
about jewelry?

687
00:35:02,586 --> 00:35:06,263
Sorry, Tom, but I just found out
I bought a ring for Susan myself.

688
00:35:07,168 --> 00:35:10,052
It was in my pocket that night
some son of a bitch ran me over.

689
00:35:10,777 --> 00:35:12,701
Hey, Tom's right.
We should focus on the game.

690
00:35:14,216 --> 00:35:16,840
After our talk,
I called the hospital.

691
00:35:17,847 --> 00:35:19,730
They said my ring got in
with your wife's stuff.

692
00:35:20,648 --> 00:35:21,930
So you saw it
before I did...

693
00:35:22,206 --> 00:35:24,881
The same day you
proposed to Susan.

694
00:35:26,998 --> 00:35:28,161
And your point is?

695
00:35:28,286 --> 00:35:30,193
That that's why you were
in such a big hurry.

696
00:35:30,778 --> 00:35:34,611
You wanted to seal the deal before
I found out about the ring and told her.

697
00:35:36,647 --> 00:35:38,030
Do you think
I'm afraid of you?

698
00:35:38,465 --> 00:35:39,541
Maybe you should be.

699
00:35:40,446 --> 00:35:41,612
What do you think
Susan would say

700
00:35:41,745 --> 00:35:44,760
if she found out why your
proposal was so spontaneous?

701
00:35:45,795 --> 00:35:47,593
Guys, can we just play?

702
00:35:48,295 --> 00:35:49,220
I'm trying.

703
00:35:50,936 --> 00:35:51,721
Fine.

704
00:35:53,438 --> 00:35:54,050
Deal.

705
00:36:03,266 --> 00:36:03,881
Hello?

706
00:36:03,948 --> 00:36:04,740
Mr. Scavo,

707
00:36:04,808 --> 00:36:06,451
It's Lamar from
the limo service.

708
00:36:07,385 --> 00:36:10,462
I got a flat, so I might be late
picking up you and your wife.

709
00:36:10,775 --> 00:36:12,642
What are you talking about?
I canceled you.

710
00:36:12,926 --> 00:36:13,732
No, you didn't.

711
00:36:13,736 --> 00:36:15,762
Yes, I did. I left
you a message.

712
00:36:16,075 --> 00:36:17,161
I must have
missed it.

713
00:36:17,566 --> 00:36:19,932
Anyway, I dropped your wife off,
right where you told me.

714
00:36:20,975 --> 00:36:21,842
Oh, God. When?

715
00:36:21,967 --> 00:36:23,082
About two hours ago.

716
00:36:29,657 --> 00:36:31,962
Guys, lock up
when you're done.

717
00:36:36,707 --> 00:36:37,480
I'll open.

718
00:36:39,755 --> 00:36:40,602
I'm out.

719
00:36:40,978 --> 00:36:42,053
And I'll raise you.

720
00:36:47,768 --> 00:36:48,562
You want a beer?

721
00:36:48,567 --> 00:36:50,841
Hell, Tom's gone.
Let's go open up the good stuff.

722
00:36:55,716 --> 00:36:56,431
Well...

723
00:36:56,977 --> 00:36:58,541
Looks like
it's just you and me,

724
00:36:59,125 --> 00:37:00,642
if you're still in.

725
00:37:01,976 --> 00:37:04,053
With this hand?
You bet I am.

726
00:37:07,218 --> 00:37:08,170
I'll re-raise.

727
00:37:15,716 --> 00:37:16,922
And raise again.

728
00:37:20,185 --> 00:37:22,610
Your stack's
looking kinda small.

729
00:37:31,886 --> 00:37:33,041
Will you take a check?

730
00:37:34,667 --> 00:37:35,973
You know I can't
match that.

731
00:37:37,648 --> 00:37:38,803
How about this, then?

732
00:37:39,686 --> 00:37:42,590
You win, you keep the money, and
you tell Susan whatever you want.

733
00:37:44,057 --> 00:37:46,663
I win, you keep your
mouth shut about the ring,

734
00:37:46,736 --> 00:37:48,691
and you leave me
and Susan alone.

735
00:38:02,236 --> 00:38:02,983
Deal.

736
00:38:17,827 --> 00:38:18,783
How was the game?

737
00:38:20,396 --> 00:38:21,302
I won.

738
00:38:33,308 --> 00:38:36,183
Lynette, I am so sorry.
I am so sorry!

739
00:38:38,146 --> 00:38:40,281
You see, there was supposed to
be a horse-drawn carriage and...

740
00:38:42,316 --> 00:38:43,912
Good. You got the flowers.

741
00:38:57,958 --> 00:38:58,541
Coffee?

742
00:38:58,865 --> 00:38:59,771
Yes, please.

743
00:39:02,627 --> 00:39:04,663
Yeah, she likes
coffee, too. Thanks.

744
00:39:07,755 --> 00:39:09,941
I'm really, really,
really sorry...

745
00:39:09,946 --> 00:39:12,060
Please stop apologizing.

746
00:39:12,107 --> 00:39:14,101
I appreciate what you
were trying to do.

747
00:39:14,135 --> 00:39:16,773
It was a lovely though that
just went hideously, hideously,

748
00:39:17,076 --> 00:39:18,403
hideously wrong.

749
00:39:20,988 --> 00:39:23,232
Wait till the kids find out
that you saw a real coyote.

750
00:39:23,377 --> 00:39:24,283
Hideously.

751
00:39:29,307 --> 00:39:30,432
Well, I learned
my lesson.

752
00:39:31,237 --> 00:39:32,792
Never again.
No more surprises.

753
00:39:32,796 --> 00:39:35,061
From now on, I'll do
exactly what you say.

754
00:39:40,326 --> 00:39:42,821
Don't... you... dare.

755
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:44,731
What?

756
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:47,681
I had a lot of time
to think tonight,

757
00:39:48,186 --> 00:39:49,883
and I realized
you were right.

758
00:39:50,848 --> 00:39:53,082
We have to keep
the romance going,

759
00:39:53,715 --> 00:39:55,470
no matter how
tired we are.

760
00:39:56,908 --> 00:40:01,032
The only thing worse thaor just
going through the motions Is not...

761
00:40:01,696 --> 00:40:03,953
bothering to go
through the motions.

762
00:40:05,875 --> 00:40:08,133
So you want me to
surprise you next year?

763
00:40:09,436 --> 00:40:10,690
Knock yourself out.

764
00:40:11,556 --> 00:40:14,370
Just wait, 'cause I will think
of something even better.

765
00:40:14,567 --> 00:40:16,210
Well, after this year,

766
00:40:16,217 --> 00:40:18,751
I would be happy
with any date

767
00:40:18,767 --> 00:40:20,982
that included
food and shelter.

768
00:40:34,108 --> 00:40:34,912
Nine years.

769
00:40:40,126 --> 00:40:41,093
Nine years...

770
00:40:42,826 --> 00:40:44,650
And I have loved
every minute of it.

771
00:40:47,405 --> 00:40:48,192
Me, too.

772
00:40:57,357 --> 00:40:59,870
Take a drive down any
street in suburbia.

773
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:01,783
You know what
you're gonna see?

774
00:41:03,968 --> 00:41:06,673
A bunch of guys wearing
the same expression.

775
00:41:08,266 --> 00:41:09,762
It's a look that says,

776
00:41:10,566 --> 00:41:11,662
"Oh, crap.

777
00:41:12,575 --> 00:41:14,692
My dreams are never
gonna come true."

778
00:41:18,605 --> 00:41:21,173
"I'll never have a life
free from scandal."

779
00:41:23,896 --> 00:41:25,783
"I'll never have
a son of my own."

780
00:41:28,706 --> 00:41:30,843
"I'll never hold her
in my arms again."

781
00:41:34,748 --> 00:41:37,481
"I'll never get to
tell her how I feel."

782
00:41:41,947 --> 00:41:45,693
Yeah, the suburbs are filled with
a lot of men who have given up hope.

783
00:41:48,098 --> 00:41:50,500
Of course, every once in a
while you do come across

784
00:41:50,505 --> 00:41:53,911
some lucky S.O.B. whose
dreams have all come true.

785
00:41:56,395 --> 00:41:57,723
You know how
you spot them?

786
00:41:59,358 --> 00:42:01,961
They're the ones who
can't stop smiling.

787
00:42:04,546 --> 00:42:06,821
Don't you just
hate those guys?
