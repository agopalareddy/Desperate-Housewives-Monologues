1
00:00:00,153 --> 00:00:02,407
Previously on Desperate Housewives...

2
00:00:02,677 --> 00:00:05,295
Ian's wife Jane
passed away.

3
00:00:05,954 --> 00:00:07,551
Gaby made a new friend.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,465
A "friend" friend,
not a girlfriend.

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,967
The finger of guilt...

6
00:00:10,968 --> 00:00:12,000
I think it's a
phone number.

7
00:00:12,101 --> 00:00:13,500
Pointed toward Mike...

8
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:17,329
They tested my wrench and found
traces of this Monique's blood.

9
00:00:17,515 --> 00:00:19,464
But he still couldn't
remember.

10
00:00:19,785 --> 00:00:21,900
Bree found a bag
of evidence.

11
00:00:22,273 --> 00:00:23,439
We have to
do something.

12
00:00:23,436 --> 00:00:26,140
Not until we put these
back in her house.

13
00:00:27,142 --> 00:00:28,617
Orson had a night...

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,600
-What do you want?
-A grandchild.

15
00:00:31,655 --> 00:00:33,520
That he'd soon
rather forget.

16
00:00:33,545 --> 00:00:35,850
You raped my husband.

17
00:00:35,898 --> 00:00:37,601
I could be expecting
right now.

18
00:00:42,088 --> 00:00:44,713
It had been two months
since Mike Delfino

19
00:00:44,716 --> 00:00:46,423
had awakened
from his coma,

20
00:00:46,978 --> 00:00:48,653
and the memories
he had lost

21
00:00:48,786 --> 00:00:50,820
were finally
starting to return.

22
00:00:53,225 --> 00:00:56,703
He could now recall the first
time he saw Wisteria Lane...

23
00:00:59,595 --> 00:01:02,103
And the first time he met
his new neighbors...

24
00:01:05,225 --> 00:01:08,323
And the first time he heard
Susan Mayer laugh.

25
00:01:11,665 --> 00:01:15,963
But the memory he most wanted
to reclaim still eluded him.

26
00:01:16,675 --> 00:01:19,863
That's why he had gone
to see a hypnotherapist,

27
00:01:20,035 --> 00:01:23,400
so that he could finally
remember everything.

28
00:01:31,256 --> 00:01:32,780
I thought you'd
never get here.

29
00:01:33,876 --> 00:01:36,450
I'm sorry.
The traffic was terrible.

30
00:01:40,695 --> 00:01:41,862
Sorry about that.

31
00:01:44,156 --> 00:01:46,540
I called my landlord when
the pipe started leaking,

32
00:01:46,548 --> 00:01:47,853
and he recommended you.

33
00:01:48,217 --> 00:01:50,772
I was so flustered, I couldn't
find a piece of paper.

34
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:52,302
I wrote your number
on my hand.

35
00:01:53,268 --> 00:01:55,771
After you finish the sink, maybe
you could help me wash it off.

36
00:01:57,645 --> 00:01:58,131
Look...

37
00:01:59,618 --> 00:02:01,701
I'm flattered,
but I'm seeing somebody.

38
00:02:02,335 --> 00:02:02,921
Me, too.

39
00:02:04,927 --> 00:02:06,563
But he's married,
and I'm drunk.

40
00:02:10,095 --> 00:02:12,982
Well, your s-trap
is cracked.

41
00:02:13,816 --> 00:02:14,890
I don't have
one with me.

44
00:02:17,616 --> 00:02:19,382
Yeah, well, that water's
just gonna keep seeping,

45
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:20,862
cause a lot
more damage.

46
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,661
I'll, uh, be back
in an hour.

47
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:25,341
I'll be waiting.

48
00:02:38,088 --> 00:02:38,751
Ms. Polier?

49
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:44,122
I've, uh... got that
part for the sink.

50
00:02:47,327 --> 00:02:47,973
Hello?

51
00:02:56,945 --> 00:02:57,890
What happened, Mike?

52
00:02:58,488 --> 00:03:00,270
I almost had it.
I was so close.

53
00:03:00,575 --> 00:03:01,302
Close to what?

54
00:03:01,518 --> 00:03:03,121
When I went back
to Monique's place,

55
00:03:03,526 --> 00:03:04,600
somebody else
was there.

56
00:03:05,658 --> 00:03:06,143
Who?

57
00:03:06,735 --> 00:03:07,990
I don't know.
I couldn't see it.

58
00:03:08,687 --> 00:03:11,443
Yes, there were
still many things

59
00:03:11,448 --> 00:03:13,522
Mike Delfino
couldn't remember...

60
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:15,851
Then why are
you smiling?

61
00:03:16,887 --> 00:03:21,020
But he'd finally remembered
the most important thing of all.

62
00:03:22,887 --> 00:03:25,151
'Cause now I know
I didn't kill her.

65
00:04:10,435 --> 00:04:12,481
It was 6:00 in
the morning,

66
00:04:13,275 --> 00:04:15,901
and Bree Hodge was
faced with a dilemma

67
00:04:15,975 --> 00:04:18,312
familiar to countless
housewives.

68
00:04:19,777 --> 00:04:22,751
Should she wake her husband
to discuss recent events

69
00:04:22,756 --> 00:04:24,851
that were weighing
heavily on her mind?

70
00:04:26,086 --> 00:04:29,973
Or should she left him continue
to get the rest he needed?

71
00:04:30,848 --> 00:04:33,710
Bree  made the
obvious choice.

72
00:04:36,405 --> 00:04:38,720
I'm sorry, but you've been
out cold for ten hours,

73
00:04:38,885 --> 00:04:39,973
and we need to talk.

74
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:44,462
I remember
drinking the scotch

75
00:04:45,066 --> 00:04:47,102
and then Alma
suddenly sitting up.

76
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,363
But after that, nothing.

77
00:04:49,927 --> 00:04:50,611
Oh, dear.

78
00:04:51,526 --> 00:04:53,050
I'm not sure how
to tell you this, but...

79
00:04:53,568 --> 00:04:55,231
After Alma knocked you out,

80
00:04:56,058 --> 00:04:57,350
she assaulted you.

81
00:04:59,108 --> 00:04:59,652
Where?

82
00:05:00,306 --> 00:05:01,222
Sexually.

83
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:03,622
She had sex with you.

84
00:05:03,707 --> 00:05:04,570
But that's impossible.

85
00:05:04,626 --> 00:05:06,341
Your drink was laced
with pills for...

86
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,040
erectile dysfunction.

87
00:05:09,565 --> 00:05:11,102
But I was dead
to the world.

88
00:05:11,415 --> 00:05:13,283
No, dear, you were
dead to the waist.

89
00:05:13,878 --> 00:05:16,372
I had sex with Alma,
and I wasn't even conscious?

90
00:05:18,445 --> 00:05:19,701
How reminiscent
of our marriage.

91
00:05:20,256 --> 00:05:21,713
Okay, this is no joke.

92
00:05:22,876 --> 00:05:24,842
She raped you,
and your mother helped.

93
00:05:26,106 --> 00:05:27,792
Look, after we get dressed,
we're going to the police.

94
00:05:27,865 --> 00:05:28,682
I can't do that.

95
00:05:28,988 --> 00:05:29,511
Orson,

96
00:05:30,178 --> 00:05:31,602
I know you're
embarrassed,

97
00:05:32,276 --> 00:05:34,402
but what they did to
you was a crime.

98
00:05:34,407 --> 00:05:36,041
No, I can't go
to the police.

99
00:05:36,517 --> 00:05:37,912
Not now, not ever.

100
00:05:38,015 --> 00:05:40,703
Orson, your ex-wife
is a homicidal rapist,

101
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:43,261
and your mother is
straight out of "I, Claudius."

102
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:45,231
Why do you refuse
to deal with them?

103
00:05:51,465 --> 00:05:55,093
I think it's time I told you about
the night Monique Polier died.

104
00:06:04,266 --> 00:06:05,070
What do you think
of this one?

105
00:06:06,198 --> 00:06:06,951
Pretty sexy.

106
00:06:07,156 --> 00:06:09,902
Is sexy what you're going for at
the funeral of your boyfriend's wife?

107
00:06:10,756 --> 00:06:12,023
You're right.
I'll keep looking.

108
00:06:12,917 --> 00:06:15,002
Why are you even going?
Won't it be weird?

109
00:06:15,405 --> 00:06:17,430
No, it'll be fine.
Ian wants me there.

110
00:06:17,647 --> 00:06:20,113
Yeah, but it'll be all
of Jane's friends and family,

111
00:06:20,758 --> 00:06:22,700
and you'll be the other woman
who swooped in like some...

112
00:06:22,705 --> 00:06:24,203
Okay, yes,
it'll be weird.

113
00:06:24,738 --> 00:06:25,662
But it's not about me.

114
00:06:25,945 --> 00:06:27,482
This is about
Jane and Ian.

115
00:06:29,537 --> 00:06:30,402
What if I wore
this one?

116
00:06:31,748 --> 00:06:33,922
Then it'll be about Jane,
Ian and your boobs.

117
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:37,442
I have got to get more
depressing clothes.

118
00:06:38,556 --> 00:06:41,890
Okay, I just need to keep a low
profile through the memorial,

119
00:06:42,506 --> 00:06:43,930
'cause once I get
through this,

120
00:06:44,307 --> 00:06:46,830
Ian can officially introduce
me as his girlfriend,

121
00:06:47,317 --> 00:06:49,953
and we'll finally be a normal,
non-adulterous couple.

122
00:06:51,715 --> 00:06:52,601
What does this one
say to you?

123
00:06:53,627 --> 00:06:56,951
Modest, reserved and definitely not
dating the dead lady's husband.

124
00:06:58,586 --> 00:06:59,151
Sold.

125
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,683
I'm not gonna get you
towels for your birthday.

126
00:07:03,007 --> 00:07:04,373
Let's go to the
jewelry department.

127
00:07:04,638 --> 00:07:08,203
No, Zach, I only accept jewelry
from men I plan on sleeping with.

128
00:07:08,488 --> 00:07:10,922
Well, okay, so where
does that leave me?

129
00:07:12,648 --> 00:07:14,702
You can buy me 
that toilet seat cover.

130
00:07:15,577 --> 00:07:17,881
Fine. All right,
we're just friends.

131
00:07:18,217 --> 00:07:20,491
Can I at least take you out
for a birthday dinner?

132
00:07:20,818 --> 00:07:22,552
There will be
no celebration.

133
00:07:22,746 --> 00:07:23,932
I'm turning 31.

134
00:07:24,237 --> 00:07:26,211
I'm a single woman
in her 30s.

135
00:07:26,496 --> 00:07:28,752
I now have to subscribe
to "Cat Fancy."

136
00:07:29,165 --> 00:07:29,902
It's the law.

137
00:07:30,618 --> 00:07:32,432
Age is just a number.
It doesn't mean anything.

138
00:07:32,736 --> 00:07:34,042
It means something to me.

139
00:07:34,598 --> 00:07:37,391
Being  alone at
this age, it's hard,

140
00:07:37,596 --> 00:07:38,802
and  it's only
gonna get harder.

141
00:07:39,547 --> 00:07:40,902
I'm so depressed.

142
00:07:42,106 --> 00:07:42,943
Let me buy
you a car.

143
00:07:44,226 --> 00:07:44,990
No, thanks.

144
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:48,319
But I do need a, uh,
liquid soap dispenser.

145
00:07:50,546 --> 00:07:51,020
Go.

146
00:08:09,792 --> 00:08:10,347
Hello.

147
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:15,053
Oh, sorry.
Didn't mean to disturb you.

148
00:08:15,807 --> 00:08:16,790
I was just trying to
see whether or not

149
00:08:16,807 --> 00:08:19,430
this was a regular king
or a California king.

150
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:21,133
Well, I think
it's a regular.

151
00:08:21,307 --> 00:08:23,273
California kings
are much longer.

152
00:08:24,425 --> 00:08:27,191
Is your... wife
particularly tall?

153
00:08:28,116 --> 00:08:29,492
Oh, I'm, uh,
I'm not married.

154
00:08:30,425 --> 00:08:32,460
Oh. Well, why
don't you try it out?

155
00:08:33,476 --> 00:08:34,840
That's okay. I can
wait till you get off.

156
00:08:35,717 --> 00:08:38,980
Oh, that'll happen a lot faster
if you just hop on board.

157
00:08:40,497 --> 00:08:41,031
I'm sorry?

158
00:08:42,167 --> 00:08:43,972
It was a...
shameless sex joke.

159
00:08:44,796 --> 00:08:45,993
I was flirting with you.

160
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:48,531
Right!

161
00:08:49,848 --> 00:08:51,022
Sorry, I can be
a little dense.

162
00:08:52,946 --> 00:08:53,722
Can we start over?

163
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,833
No. Moment's gone.
You killed it.

164
00:08:57,188 --> 00:08:58,730
Uh, look, you know,
I'm in a bit of a hurry,

165
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:01,330
but maybe we can try
this again sometime.

166
00:09:03,677 --> 00:09:04,402
It could happen.

167
00:09:04,868 --> 00:09:06,550
Hey, sorry
I took so long.

168
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:08,423
Mr. Young?

169
00:09:08,967 --> 00:09:11,283
Oh. You know
my friend Zach?

170
00:09:12,937 --> 00:09:14,363
No, I don't think so.

171
00:09:14,367 --> 00:09:16,381
I'm Luke... Purdue?

172
00:09:16,906 --> 00:09:19,361
I'm on your legal team. I'm taking
point on the Halverson deal.

173
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:20,523
Yeah, right. Hey.

174
00:09:23,155 --> 00:09:25,132
Again, it was
nice meeting you.

175
00:09:26,855 --> 00:09:27,241
Sir.

176
00:09:30,177 --> 00:09:31,143
That was really weird.

177
00:09:31,577 --> 00:09:33,321
I don't even know the guy,
and he works for me.

178
00:09:36,278 --> 00:09:37,790
Works for me, too.

179
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:43,292
Bree...

180
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:44,641
Please don't touch me.

181
00:09:46,768 --> 00:09:48,752
All this time, you've said
you wanted the truth.

182
00:09:49,025 --> 00:09:50,442
That's before
I knew what it was.

183
00:09:51,315 --> 00:09:53,893
You see, that's why I've tried
to protect you from this.

184
00:09:54,376 --> 00:09:56,961
Yeah, but you weren't just
trying to protect me, were you?

185
00:09:59,805 --> 00:10:00,640
What do you
want me to do?

186
00:10:01,355 --> 00:10:02,800
Exonerate Mike.

187
00:10:03,817 --> 00:10:05,282
How could you
stand by and let an

188
00:10:05,445 --> 00:10:07,482
innocent man be
dragged off to prison?

189
00:10:07,486 --> 00:10:08,880
You think I haven't
felt terrible?

190
00:10:09,027 --> 00:10:10,643
And this, after he'd
been in a coma

191
00:10:10,647 --> 00:10:12,893
because some lunatic
ran him over.

192
00:10:14,455 --> 00:10:15,432
He has had
a rough year.

193
00:10:16,378 --> 00:10:17,483
I wanna help Mike.

194
00:10:17,845 --> 00:10:20,343
How do I do that without
implicating myself?

195
00:10:20,445 --> 00:10:21,452
I could go to jail.

196
00:10:22,138 --> 00:10:23,332
I don't care
if you go to jail.

197
00:10:23,846 --> 00:10:26,612
You have done a horrible thing,
and you have to make it right.

198
00:10:28,237 --> 00:10:29,280
I mean it, Orson.

199
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,701
If you don't fix this,
I will.

200
00:10:34,826 --> 00:10:36,673
Well, I guess I'm in
no position to argue.

201
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:39,071
No, you're not.

202
00:10:45,085 --> 00:10:45,850
Morning, Andrew.

203
00:10:46,217 --> 00:10:46,793
Hey, Orson.

204
00:10:47,168 --> 00:10:49,653
I was just gonna ask if you
guys wanted some coffee.

205
00:10:50,538 --> 00:10:52,152
Yeah. Thanks.
I could use some.

206
00:10:53,316 --> 00:10:54,462
It's gonna be
a long day.

207
00:11:01,498 --> 00:11:02,692
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

208
00:11:03,727 --> 00:11:04,613
Thank you.

209
00:11:08,138 --> 00:11:08,863
Mom!

210
00:11:09,595 --> 00:11:11,653
Dinner is in an hour.
You know the rules.

211
00:11:12,748 --> 00:11:13,642
And so do you.

212
00:11:13,858 --> 00:11:16,500
I know, I know,
but he gave me the face.

213
00:11:17,466 --> 00:11:19,623
You fell for the face.
What are you, a rookie?

214
00:11:19,776 --> 00:11:21,231
Okay, you're right.

215
00:11:21,775 --> 00:11:23,131
Sorry, buddy.
Mom's the boss.

216
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:26,831
I feel nothing.

217
00:11:31,638 --> 00:11:33,340
Hi, Lynette.
Hey, Tom.

218
00:11:34,355 --> 00:11:35,393
How's the restaurant going?

219
00:11:35,707 --> 00:11:36,701
You ready for
the big opening?

220
00:11:36,766 --> 00:11:39,370
Oh, we're getting there.
Let me give you a coupon.

221
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:42,811
Free extra topping
on any medium or large.

222
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:44,182
How nice.

223
00:11:44,685 --> 00:11:46,270
But you know what
would be even nicer?

224
00:11:46,816 --> 00:11:48,383
Hire my nephew
to work for you.

225
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:51,600
You know, the coupon's
good all week.

226
00:11:51,866 --> 00:11:54,032
Look, I don't know what lies
you've heard about Austin,

227
00:11:54,037 --> 00:11:56,290
but you can't be listening
to vicious gossip.

228
00:11:56,848 --> 00:11:58,772
I heard he got arrested
for beating some guy up.

229
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:00,810
Okay, that one's
pretty accurate.

230
00:12:00,957 --> 00:12:02,662
Edie, I'm all staffed up.

231
00:12:03,528 --> 00:12:05,241
Come on!
Help me out.

232
00:12:05,465 --> 00:12:07,631
Seriously, ever since
Julie dumped him,

233
00:12:07,635 --> 00:12:09,783
he's been depressed and mopey.
He's driving me crazy.

234
00:12:10,007 --> 00:12:12,342
Please, any crappy
job you got.

235
00:12:13,957 --> 00:12:16,992
Well, I guess I could use
an extra guy in back.

236
00:12:16,997 --> 00:12:19,352
Have him there tomorrow,
8:00 in the morning.

237
00:12:19,816 --> 00:12:22,732
Thank you.
Thank you so, so much.

238
00:12:22,968 --> 00:12:25,320
Uh, Edie, you forgot
your coupon.

239
00:12:25,937 --> 00:12:26,793
Tom, please.

240
00:12:26,806 --> 00:12:29,530
You've checked out my butt enough
times to know that I don't eat pizza.

241
00:12:42,487 --> 00:12:42,881
Zach!

242
00:12:42,885 --> 00:12:45,440
I know. You said you wanted to be
alone for your birthday, but, uh,

243
00:12:46,337 --> 00:12:48,342
that's just dumb, so
I'm gonna take you out.

244
00:12:48,487 --> 00:12:49,732
Oh, that's so sweet,

245
00:12:49,807 --> 00:12:50,723
-but I, uh...
-Don't worry.

246
00:12:50,725 --> 00:12:53,021
It's just gonna be one friend
keeping another friend company.

247
00:12:53,317 --> 00:12:54,103
It's not gonna be a date.

248
00:12:54,637 --> 00:12:55,932
Oh, well, um,

249
00:12:56,146 --> 00:12:58,552
Luke's gonna be here in 20 minutes,
and that kind of will be a date.

250
00:13:00,178 --> 00:13:00,582
Luke?

251
00:13:01,075 --> 00:13:03,311
That's, uh... 
my lawyer guy?

252
00:13:03,695 --> 00:13:04,073
Yeah.

253
00:13:05,706 --> 00:13:06,900
That isn't a
problem, is it?

254
00:13:07,376 --> 00:13:09,971
'Cause this is what friends do.
They talk about each other's dates.

255
00:13:11,266 --> 00:13:12,193
No, I'm cool.

256
00:13:13,475 --> 00:13:14,202
Have a great time.

257
00:13:14,675 --> 00:13:17,273
Uh, I'm gonna
get out of your hair.

258
00:13:20,945 --> 00:13:22,362
So you think this
guy's really into you?

259
00:13:23,618 --> 00:13:26,372
Well, he seemed to like me
in the mattress department,

260
00:13:26,376 --> 00:13:29,313
so  here's hoping I like him
the mattress department.

261
00:13:33,128 --> 00:13:35,170
What?
Friends say these things.

262
00:13:39,575 --> 00:13:40,103
Orson.

263
00:13:41,718 --> 00:13:43,902
Oh, well, I'm in luck.

264
00:13:44,705 --> 00:13:46,083
The whole coven's here.

265
00:13:48,697 --> 00:13:50,081
I just stopped by
to say thank you.

266
00:13:51,337 --> 00:13:52,343
Mm... you're welcome.

267
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,573
I bought a pregnancy test,
but it's too soon to take it.

268
00:13:56,618 --> 00:13:58,150
I wasn't talking
about the sex.

269
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:01,502
Though hats off, mother,
for colluding in my rape.

270
00:14:01,968 --> 00:14:04,460
I think it's great that we can
still surprise each other.

271
00:14:05,568 --> 00:14:07,753
No, I was talking more about
what you did for me and Bree.

272
00:14:08,257 --> 00:14:09,113
What did I do?

273
00:14:09,628 --> 00:14:11,440
Your  little stunt
made her so angry,

274
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,170
she demanded
we go the police.

275
00:14:14,455 --> 00:14:15,501
She forced my hand,

276
00:14:17,376 --> 00:14:18,500
So I told her
everything.

277
00:14:19,028 --> 00:14:19,581
Everything?

278
00:14:21,378 --> 00:14:23,232
That is rather unwise.

279
00:14:23,308 --> 00:14:25,292
I faced my worst fear,

280
00:14:25,418 --> 00:14:28,382
the moment I felt sure would end
my marriage, and guess what?

281
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:30,423
It didn't.

282
00:14:31,798 --> 00:14:33,073
She forgave you?

283
00:14:33,728 --> 00:14:34,421
Not entirely.

284
00:14:35,147 --> 00:14:35,873
Not yet.

285
00:14:36,465 --> 00:14:37,500
But she'll come around.

286
00:14:38,965 --> 00:14:40,021
The good news is,

287
00:14:40,427 --> 00:14:43,023
the months of dread,
the fear of discovery...

288
00:14:43,976 --> 00:14:44,631
that's all over.

289
00:14:46,267 --> 00:14:47,201
So thank you...

290
00:14:48,997 --> 00:14:49,910
and good-bye.

291
00:14:54,457 --> 00:14:54,960
Wait!

292
00:14:55,567 --> 00:14:57,163
I could be carrying
your child!

293
00:14:58,337 --> 00:15:01,323
I don't care if you've got
the Hodge septuplets in there.

294
00:15:02,045 --> 00:15:03,521
I'm sticking with Bree.

295
00:15:10,705 --> 00:15:14,072
Why must he make
everything so difficult?

296
00:15:18,766 --> 00:15:20,091
Oh, uh, floor's done.

297
00:15:22,907 --> 00:15:25,460
I told you I wanted this floor
to sparkle like your Mom's.

298
00:15:25,506 --> 00:15:28,592
Now does this floor look
"Bree Hodge" clean to you?

299
00:15:28,737 --> 00:15:32,373
Uh... no. It looks "Andrew
Van De Kamp" clean.

300
00:15:33,088 --> 00:15:35,673
But your disappointment
in me is very Bree Hodge.

301
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:39,060
Okay, just for that, you get
to help me take out the trash.

302
00:15:41,218 --> 00:15:43,400
I know you think
I'm being a hard-ass,

303
00:15:43,866 --> 00:15:47,732
But I'm just looking for a basic
level of professionalism that...

304
00:15:51,776 --> 00:15:52,413
Austin?

305
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:54,473
What the hell's
going on here?

306
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:57,213
Just, uh, just talking
to the delivery guy.

307
00:15:58,557 --> 00:15:59,542
Hey, where'd he go?

308
00:16:01,268 --> 00:16:02,051
Are you high?

309
00:16:03,188 --> 00:16:03,892
Only...

310
00:16:06,918 --> 00:16:07,812
Totally.

311
00:16:08,478 --> 00:16:09,412
Austin!

312
00:16:09,605 --> 00:16:11,022
Dude, not smart.

313
00:16:11,098 --> 00:16:13,803
But I have good reason,
and when you hear it,

314
00:16:14,038 --> 00:16:16,500
you're not gonna make
that face anymore.

315
00:16:18,885 --> 00:16:21,703
Julie Mayer dumped me,
and I'm very...

316
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:24,703
very upset.

317
00:16:26,975 --> 00:16:28,540
Your face is
not changing.

318
00:16:29,878 --> 00:16:30,762
Get your stuff.

319
00:16:31,087 --> 00:16:33,401
Get the hell out of my restaurant. 
You're fired. Go on.

320
00:16:40,415 --> 00:16:42,380
Floor's looking pretty
clean right now, isn't it?

321
00:16:49,207 --> 00:16:50,493
You said he'd come
back to me.

322
00:16:50,907 --> 00:16:52,822
You said deep down,
he still loves me.

323
00:16:52,936 --> 00:16:54,622
Well, you heard him
today. He hates me!

324
00:16:55,008 --> 00:16:57,202
You ravished him
against his will.

325
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:59,633
He's bound to be touchy
in the short run.

326
00:17:00,198 --> 00:17:02,762
I'll handle Orson.
You just worry about the baby.

327
00:17:03,066 --> 00:17:04,242
He  said he
doesn't care.

328
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,101
He says that now,

329
00:17:06,565 --> 00:17:09,373
But he will not abandon
his own flesh and blood.

330
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:10,862
You're his flesh
and blood.

331
00:17:11,276 --> 00:17:13,480
He put you in a home.

332
00:17:14,906 --> 00:17:18,430
You know, I usually don't
say this to expectant mothers,

333
00:17:18,477 --> 00:17:21,131
but for God sake,
have a scotch.

334
00:17:25,138 --> 00:17:26,421
I should just
call the police.

335
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:29,232
What?

336
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:30,560
I know what he did.

337
00:17:30,905 --> 00:17:33,111
If he's never gonna love me,
why should I protect him?

338
00:17:33,978 --> 00:17:35,161
I'd rather see him in jail

339
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:37,061
than playing house
with tammy tightass.

340
00:17:37,108 --> 00:17:38,850
Knock it off, Alma.

341
00:17:40,098 --> 00:17:42,473
I will make Orson
come around.

342
00:17:42,848 --> 00:17:44,442
I don't believe
you anymore.

343
00:17:45,026 --> 00:17:48,383
She's got her claws in him,
and she's not letting go.

344
00:17:48,858 --> 00:17:50,392
Don't be so sure.

345
00:17:51,668 --> 00:17:54,401
I was looking over
at their house last night,

346
00:17:54,557 --> 00:17:57,871
and I saw
something very...

347
00:17:58,906 --> 00:17:59,972
curious.

348
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,690
What?

349
00:18:03,356 --> 00:18:04,981
You can't see
it down here.

350
00:18:07,175 --> 00:18:09,823
We need to
be up higher.

351
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,122
How can you see anything from here?
There's not even a window.

352
00:18:27,445 --> 00:18:28,140
Gloria?

353
00:18:31,225 --> 00:18:32,103
Gloria?!

354
00:18:33,198 --> 00:18:35,883
Just calm down,
sweetheart.

355
00:18:35,905 --> 00:18:37,261
Gloria, let me out!

356
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:38,683
Stress isn't good
for the baby.

357
00:18:38,696 --> 00:18:39,821
What are you doing?!

358
00:18:41,806 --> 00:18:43,022
Gloria?!

359
00:19:02,557 --> 00:19:03,551
So how are you
holding up?

360
00:19:04,105 --> 00:19:05,500
Better, now that
you're here.

361
00:19:06,648 --> 00:19:09,401
Oh! No, I wanna, um,
keep a low profile.

362
00:19:09,517 --> 00:19:11,230
But I've kissed
a hundred lips today.

363
00:19:11,287 --> 00:19:14,052
I assure you, it would look
more conspicuous if I didn't.

364
00:19:18,006 --> 00:19:18,931
Okay, that's enough.

365
00:19:27,046 --> 00:19:29,801
Ian, oh,
you must be shattered.

366
00:19:29,906 --> 00:19:31,012
I know I am.

367
00:19:31,156 --> 00:19:32,183
Thanks for coming, Lynn.

368
00:19:36,435 --> 00:19:39,423
You know, Jane used
to kid me about you.

369
00:19:39,585 --> 00:19:40,513
Huh. Did she?

370
00:19:41,405 --> 00:19:44,401
She'd say, "Lynn, if anything
ever happens to me,

371
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:46,361
I want you to marry Ian."

372
00:19:47,647 --> 00:19:49,141
"You're pushy.

373
00:19:49,168 --> 00:19:51,332
Maybe you can get him
to pick up his socks. "

374
00:19:54,498 --> 00:19:57,202
Listen, um, if you
ever need to talk,

375
00:19:57,607 --> 00:19:58,421
I'm here.

376
00:19:59,455 --> 00:20:03,403
Why don't you stop over some
night for a home-cooked meal?

377
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:06,401
Oh, that... that's
very kind of you,

378
00:20:06,406 --> 00:20:08,192
but I wouldn't dream
of putting you out.

379
00:20:09,727 --> 00:20:12,782
Well, I won't take
"no" for an answer.

380
00:20:13,168 --> 00:20:14,200
Have you got
my number?

381
00:20:15,288 --> 00:20:16,332
I sure as hell do.

382
00:20:17,198 --> 00:20:19,392
Well, I'm sure I'll find it
in Jane's phone book.

383
00:20:20,197 --> 00:20:22,391
Let me give it to you,
just in case.

384
00:20:26,336 --> 00:20:27,500
Call anytime.

385
00:20:35,387 --> 00:20:37,021
Oops. Watch yourself.

386
00:20:41,488 --> 00:20:42,921
So I was there
on a plumbing job.

387
00:20:43,296 --> 00:20:44,612
It makes complete sense.

388
00:20:44,626 --> 00:20:46,143
I had no reason
to want her dead.

389
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:49,502
I always thought hypnotherapy
was a bunch of bull, but damn.

390
00:20:51,217 --> 00:20:53,621
This is huge, man.
You didn't kill anyone.

391
00:20:54,556 --> 00:20:56,722
The murderer has to be
this yellow gloves guy.

392
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,892
Yeah, but no matter
how much I concentrate,

393
00:20:59,098 --> 00:21:00,602
I still can't see a face.

394
00:21:00,648 --> 00:21:01,632
Ah, you will.

395
00:21:02,635 --> 00:21:04,332
Look at the progress
that you've made so far.

396
00:21:05,226 --> 00:21:06,492
You're gonna
find this guy,

397
00:21:06,617 --> 00:21:08,391
and then you're gonna
hand his ass over to the cops.

398
00:21:09,478 --> 00:21:11,901
Yeah...
something like that.

399
00:21:14,247 --> 00:21:15,101
Hey, guys.

400
00:21:25,268 --> 00:21:27,050
Well, Ian seems
to be holding up.

401
00:21:27,697 --> 00:21:30,303
It's just a mask.
The man is devastated.

402
00:21:31,045 --> 00:21:34,662
Tomorrow night, I'm gonna swing by
his place to offer him a casserole

403
00:21:35,067 --> 00:21:36,540
and a shoulder to cry on.

404
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:39,891
Will that shoulder be
wearing a spaghetti strap,

405
00:21:40,105 --> 00:21:41,430
and Chanel no. 5?

406
00:21:42,097 --> 00:21:43,411
You know me so well.

407
00:21:44,395 --> 00:21:45,800
Oh, look at him.

408
00:21:46,147 --> 00:21:48,692
Even in mourning,
the man is scrumptious.

409
00:21:51,347 --> 00:21:52,823
I'm sorry for eavesdropping,

410
00:21:52,898 --> 00:21:55,901
but don't you think your conversation
is a little inappropriate?

411
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:58,902
I mean, we're here
to grieve, not cruise.

412
00:21:59,935 --> 00:22:02,071
I'm sorry,
and you are...

413
00:22:03,566 --> 00:22:04,413
Susan Mayer.

414
00:22:05,176 --> 00:22:08,190
I'm... a friend
of the family.

415
00:22:10,615 --> 00:22:13,371
Then you know how
lonely Ian's been.

416
00:22:13,968 --> 00:22:15,702
And if I want to do
something about that,

417
00:22:16,646 --> 00:22:18,403
it's no business of yours.

418
00:22:22,438 --> 00:22:24,562
Look, just to save you
the embarrassment,

419
00:22:25,067 --> 00:22:26,561
Ian's seeing someone.

420
00:22:28,796 --> 00:22:29,371
Who?

421
00:22:31,528 --> 00:22:33,042
I'm not at liberty to say.

422
00:22:33,045 --> 00:22:36,042
Under the circumstances,
they'd prefer to keep it quiet.

423
00:22:36,677 --> 00:22:39,043
I don't believe it. If there was
some bimbo in the picture,

424
00:22:39,197 --> 00:22:40,213
I'd have heard about it.

425
00:22:40,348 --> 00:22:41,853
As far as I'm concerned,

426
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:43,633
he's free meat.

427
00:22:45,776 --> 00:22:46,622
Okay, it's me.

428
00:22:47,497 --> 00:22:47,963
What?

429
00:22:48,486 --> 00:22:50,200
I'm the bimbo.
He's my meat.

430
00:22:54,927 --> 00:22:55,503
All righty.

431
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:58,250
I just wanted
to clear that up.

432
00:22:59,756 --> 00:23:02,561
And now I'm going to go
find myself a seat with a...

433
00:23:03,126 --> 00:23:03,870
better view.

434
00:23:07,527 --> 00:23:09,013
Here are your W-4s.

435
00:23:09,095 --> 00:23:12,002
Please sign them and get them
back to me as soon as possible.

436
00:23:12,256 --> 00:23:14,620
Also, I'm gonna need a copy,

437
00:23:14,758 --> 00:23:16,912
hi, of your driver's license.

438
00:23:17,888 --> 00:23:19,211
-Austin?
-Yeah?

439
00:23:19,635 --> 00:23:21,181
What are you doing
here? I fired you.

440
00:23:22,315 --> 00:23:24,702
Well, Mr. Scavo gave
me my job back.

441
00:23:25,957 --> 00:23:26,380
Hey!

442
00:23:28,687 --> 00:23:30,193
You hired him back?

443
00:23:30,437 --> 00:23:32,732
Did he tell you he
was stoned on the job?

444
00:23:33,227 --> 00:23:35,580
Yeah, and he knows if he
does again, he's outta here.

445
00:23:35,828 --> 00:23:37,162
-So I wanted...
-Look, I don't know what kind

446
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,252
of hustle you pulled on him,
but it's not gonna work on me.

447
00:23:39,267 --> 00:23:39,982
Lynette.

448
00:23:40,178 --> 00:23:43,642
No, I fired him, and you
are gonna stay fired.

449
00:23:43,678 --> 00:23:45,890
Honey, can I see you
in the back for a sec?

450
00:23:52,468 --> 00:23:53,262
What the hell
are you doing,

451
00:23:53,268 --> 00:23:54,961
Talking to me like that
in front of my staff?

452
00:23:55,077 --> 00:23:57,932
Well, I'm sorry, but you totally
blindsided me out there.

453
00:23:57,935 --> 00:23:59,860
No, I was the one
who was blindsided.

454
00:23:59,867 --> 00:24:02,203
You just went off on me without
hearing what my reasons were.

455
00:24:02,205 --> 00:24:03,603
Well, I'm sorry.
Let's hear them.

456
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,860
What are your reasons for
bringing back Joe Bong hit?

457
00:24:05,926 --> 00:24:06,600
I'll tell ya,

458
00:24:06,915 --> 00:24:09,363
if you drop that tone and
stop making that face.

459
00:24:10,597 --> 00:24:11,193
What is...

460
00:24:12,268 --> 00:24:14,282
This was
a business decision.

461
00:24:14,407 --> 00:24:15,363
In case you
hadn't noticed,

462
00:24:15,515 --> 00:24:19,283
and I hadn't, until the waitresses
pointed it out to me, Austin is hot.

463
00:24:19,515 --> 00:24:21,432
He's gonna bring in every
girl from Fairview high

464
00:24:21,565 --> 00:24:22,931
And half the boys
in the chorus.

465
00:24:23,177 --> 00:24:24,053
What's more,

466
00:24:24,267 --> 00:24:28,123
Edie is gonna include our menu in the
welcome packet she gives to new homeowners.

467
00:24:28,418 --> 00:24:31,520
I'm not sure she'd feel so
generous If we fired her nephew.

468
00:24:34,235 --> 00:24:35,382
Those reasons
working for ya?

469
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:36,252
Yeah.

470
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:40,040
I just wish you'd told me
before you rehired him.

471
00:24:40,046 --> 00:24:41,960
I mean, I am the manager.

472
00:24:42,378 --> 00:24:42,793
Right...

473
00:24:45,148 --> 00:24:46,040
But I'm the boss.

474
00:24:47,615 --> 00:24:48,433
Well, kinda.

475
00:24:49,317 --> 00:24:51,461
No, no.
Not "kind of."

476
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:52,502
Really.

477
00:24:53,535 --> 00:24:54,451
I'm the boss.

478
00:24:56,638 --> 00:24:57,712
You pulling rank on me?

479
00:24:58,138 --> 00:25:01,123
Look, at home,
you get to be in charge,

480
00:25:01,135 --> 00:25:03,293
and you decide how
we discipline the boys,

481
00:25:03,328 --> 00:25:04,980
what car we buy,
everything.

482
00:25:05,127 --> 00:25:06,152
I consult you.

483
00:25:06,155 --> 00:25:08,671
Oh, sure, and if you
disagree, you ignore me.

484
00:25:08,796 --> 00:25:10,050
Look, when I go home,

485
00:25:10,196 --> 00:25:12,743
basically, I check
my balls at the door,

486
00:25:12,898 --> 00:25:14,451
and that's fine.
It works.

487
00:25:14,697 --> 00:25:17,570
But for this to work, when
you walk through that door,

488
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,631
you gotta check yours.

489
00:25:25,238 --> 00:25:25,741
Okay.

490
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:28,532
Really?

491
00:25:29,816 --> 00:25:30,412
Really.

492
00:25:31,558 --> 00:25:33,211
This place
is your dream, so...

493
00:25:34,685 --> 00:25:35,871
Consider them checked.

494
00:25:36,908 --> 00:25:39,462
Thanks. Now I need you
to do just one more thing.

495
00:25:40,596 --> 00:25:41,563
Whatever you say...

496
00:25:42,127 --> 00:25:42,682
boss.

497
00:25:43,296 --> 00:25:46,351
I don't care if you think
you know what's best!

498
00:25:46,486 --> 00:25:47,960
You don't! I do,

499
00:25:48,145 --> 00:25:50,373
because I'm the boss,
and what I say goes.

500
00:25:50,807 --> 00:25:51,813
Yeah, that's it.
Give it to me.

501
00:25:52,055 --> 00:25:54,123
So when I make a decision,
it stays made!

502
00:25:54,145 --> 00:25:56,091
-You got that, Lynette?
-Yes, sir.

503
00:25:56,515 --> 00:25:58,202
-Okay, that's enough.
-No, just one more.

504
00:25:58,347 --> 00:26:00,513
And if I want your opinion,
I'll ask for it!

505
00:26:00,836 --> 00:26:02,852
But I probably won't,

506
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:05,582
because I'm the boss!
Are we clear?

507
00:26:06,037 --> 00:26:07,802
Seriously, stop
or I will hurt you.

508
00:26:08,008 --> 00:26:09,340
Okay, I've made my point.

509
00:26:10,417 --> 00:26:11,971
Anybody needs me,
I'll be in the back...

510
00:26:12,747 --> 00:26:13,582
drinking a beer.

511
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:29,773
This is delicious.

512
00:26:30,345 --> 00:26:31,553
Don't get too full.

513
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,300
You have to leave
room for dessert.

514
00:26:35,607 --> 00:26:36,300
What are we having?

515
00:26:36,708 --> 00:26:39,253
Well, let's just say it's
going to be served upstairs

516
00:26:39,257 --> 00:26:40,790
and involves
whipped cream.

517
00:26:42,257 --> 00:26:42,990
Is it pudding?

518
00:26:44,168 --> 00:26:45,032
No.

519
00:26:46,086 --> 00:26:47,403
Oh! You're flirting.

520
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:49,780
Okay. Do it again.
I swear I'll get it.

521
00:26:49,928 --> 00:26:51,723
It's okay. Do you
want some coffee?

522
00:26:52,037 --> 00:26:53,440
You bet I want coffee...

523
00:26:54,477 --> 00:26:56,083
nice and hot and...

524
00:26:56,617 --> 00:26:58,161
Just finish your soup,
and we'll get naked.

525
00:27:06,268 --> 00:27:07,603
Sorry to bother you,
Mrs. Solis.

526
00:27:07,698 --> 00:27:09,021
I work with Luke.
Is he available?

527
00:27:10,477 --> 00:27:11,060
Charles?

528
00:27:12,166 --> 00:27:13,043
What are you
doing here?

529
00:27:13,318 --> 00:27:15,503
You forgot to initial some pages
on the Halverson contract.

530
00:27:15,836 --> 00:27:16,862
Can't this wait?

531
00:27:16,915 --> 00:27:18,421
The market's already
open in Tokyo.

532
00:27:20,137 --> 00:27:22,191
Uh, go ahead. I'm gonna
open some more wine.

533
00:27:35,347 --> 00:27:37,801
Mr. Young wants to make sure
you understand that last part.

534
00:27:38,995 --> 00:27:39,523
Do you?

535
00:27:49,328 --> 00:27:49,700
Yeah.

536
00:27:51,698 --> 00:27:52,150
I get it.

537
00:27:56,907 --> 00:27:58,413
So when we
think of Jane,

538
00:27:59,775 --> 00:28:03,251
Let us remember her kind
heart and her loving spirit.

539
00:28:03,847 --> 00:28:07,843
And now if there's someone who'd like to
share a special memory of our dear friend?

540
00:28:08,336 --> 00:28:09,080
I would.

541
00:28:17,556 --> 00:28:19,332
Hi. I'm Lynn Dean.

542
00:28:19,755 --> 00:28:22,103
Jane and I were
sorority sisters.

543
00:28:22,208 --> 00:28:25,113
If she were here, she'd make
me sing our pledge song,

544
00:28:25,605 --> 00:28:28,890
but I think there's already been
enough grief for one day.

545
00:28:31,115 --> 00:28:35,832
Now I know how badly
we've all felt for Ian

546
00:28:36,287 --> 00:28:39,182
during his long,
lonely vigil,

547
00:28:39,835 --> 00:28:44,412
So I'm sure you'll be as
happy as I was to learn

548
00:28:45,096 --> 00:28:47,621
His vigil wasn't quite
so lonely after all.

549
00:28:49,225 --> 00:28:50,250
Oh, dear God.

550
00:28:50,747 --> 00:28:55,400
No, he found a warm,
caring woman

551
00:28:55,715 --> 00:28:57,290
to share his burden...

552
00:28:59,277 --> 00:29:01,080
and so much else.

553
00:29:06,047 --> 00:29:08,591
Some people might find
the fact that she's here today...

554
00:29:08,946 --> 00:29:10,362
inappropriate.

555
00:29:10,877 --> 00:29:13,621
But I think she's a hero.

556
00:29:14,728 --> 00:29:21,690
She dared to brave the scorn of
those who might find her actions

557
00:29:21,756 --> 00:29:25,353
questionable or
even unsavory.

558
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:30,300
I was gonna ask her to stand,
but I see she already has.

559
00:29:32,806 --> 00:29:35,293
Susan Mayer,
say hello.

560
00:29:38,208 --> 00:29:39,023
Hey.

561
00:29:50,596 --> 00:29:52,621
Guess someone's in a hurry
to get on with the evening.

562
00:29:53,797 --> 00:29:54,551
Yeah.

563
00:29:56,146 --> 00:29:57,022
Well, I should go.

564
00:29:58,205 --> 00:29:58,861
What?

565
00:29:59,137 --> 00:30:01,950
I have a lot more work to do
on that Halverson deal.

566
00:30:03,925 --> 00:30:04,471
Sorry.

567
00:30:04,858 --> 00:30:06,800
But can't it wait
till after dessert?

568
00:30:07,035 --> 00:30:08,763
And by "dessert,"
I mean sex.

569
00:30:09,168 --> 00:30:10,583
You are clear
on that, right?

570
00:30:11,548 --> 00:30:12,501
Painfully,

571
00:30:13,168 --> 00:30:15,462
but my job's at stake here.
I really don't have much of a choice.

572
00:30:15,866 --> 00:30:18,280
Oh, I think you've got
lots of choices.

573
00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:19,701
Here's one of them.

574
00:30:27,508 --> 00:30:28,230
Hello?

575
00:30:28,568 --> 00:30:29,453
What do you think
you're doing?

576
00:30:30,708 --> 00:30:31,283
What?

577
00:30:31,338 --> 00:30:33,672
I gave you an order,
and I expect you to follow it.

578
00:30:33,968 --> 00:30:35,013
Now get out of there.

579
00:30:35,836 --> 00:30:36,760
I'm trying, sir.

580
00:30:37,267 --> 00:30:38,930
It's just that I'm meeting
some resistance to the plan...

581
00:30:39,187 --> 00:30:40,090
we've agreed on.

582
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:42,913
Okay, she's not letting
you leave? That's fine.

583
00:30:43,355 --> 00:30:44,383
Here's what
I want you to say.

584
00:30:48,685 --> 00:30:50,001
Okay, I'll give
that a shot, sir.

585
00:30:50,207 --> 00:30:51,472
Is that your office?

586
00:30:51,717 --> 00:30:54,761
Yeah, they, uh, they really
need me over there.

587
00:30:55,008 --> 00:30:58,320
Okay. So come back when
you're done. I'll wait up.

588
00:30:59,175 --> 00:31:01,601
I can't.
No, I really can't.

589
00:31:05,198 --> 00:31:06,623
What is with you?!

590
00:31:06,968 --> 00:31:08,703
An hour ago,
you were really into me,

591
00:31:08,707 --> 00:31:10,453
and now you can't
get out fast enough.

592
00:31:10,525 --> 00:31:11,893
Okay. Truth?

593
00:31:14,146 --> 00:31:15,492
I thought I could
do this, but I can't.

594
00:31:17,636 --> 00:31:19,170
I'm just not
attracted to you.

595
00:31:20,916 --> 00:31:21,802
Of course you are!

596
00:31:21,835 --> 00:31:22,663
No. See...

597
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:26,141
I really only date
women in their 20s.

598
00:31:27,115 --> 00:31:27,543
What?

599
00:31:27,875 --> 00:31:28,471
Sorry.

600
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:30,911
You're too
old for me.

601
00:31:38,606 --> 00:31:40,910
I still got a lot of kick
for an old broad, don't I?!

602
00:32:25,615 --> 00:32:26,132
Mom?

603
00:32:28,678 --> 00:32:29,171
Mom?

604
00:32:29,576 --> 00:32:30,823
Mom, are you all right?

605
00:32:30,925 --> 00:32:33,420
Don't move her. She might
have broken something.

606
00:32:36,716 --> 00:32:40,630
Yes, we need an ambulance,
please, at 4354 Wisteria Lane.

607
00:32:40,955 --> 00:32:42,543
My wife's had a bad fall.
Please hurry.

608
00:32:53,608 --> 00:32:54,502
How is this?

609
00:32:58,288 --> 00:32:59,960
Mrs. Hodge was very lucky.

610
00:33:00,117 --> 00:33:01,712
She only suffered
a slight concussion.

611
00:33:02,405 --> 00:33:05,153
If you have any more questions,
the doctor should be back soon.

612
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:05,890
Thank you.

613
00:33:08,365 --> 00:33:10,371
Thank God.
I was so worried.

614
00:33:11,877 --> 00:33:12,691
Yeah, I'll bet.

615
00:33:15,605 --> 00:33:16,720
What's that
supposed to mean?

616
00:33:18,235 --> 00:33:19,591
I heard you two
yesterday-

617
00:33:20,138 --> 00:33:21,951
All that stuff about you
maybe going to jail.

618
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:24,470
Well, that's none
of your business.

619
00:33:25,916 --> 00:33:29,610
But if you think I had anything
to do with Bree falling...

620
00:33:29,617 --> 00:33:30,510
I'm not stupid.

621
00:33:31,127 --> 00:33:33,440
I know the cops have been all
over you about that dead woman,

622
00:33:34,438 --> 00:33:36,761
and Mom said for you
to fix it, or she would.

623
00:33:36,967 --> 00:33:39,153
Is this "accident"
how you fixed it?

624
00:33:39,197 --> 00:33:40,591
All right, you're
upset. I get it.

625
00:33:40,596 --> 00:33:41,760
No, no, you don't get it.

626
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:44,200
There's a reason my Mom put
me out on the street last year.

627
00:33:44,557 --> 00:33:47,510
You've never met that guy.
You've never met bad Andrew.

628
00:33:48,895 --> 00:33:50,611
But hurt my Mom,
and you will.

629
00:33:52,466 --> 00:33:53,413
I love your mother.

630
00:33:54,667 --> 00:33:56,471
I'm gonna do everything
I can to protect her.

631
00:33:58,518 --> 00:33:59,733
Yeah, so am I.

632
00:34:03,718 --> 00:34:05,551
Hi. I'm Bree Hodge's son.

633
00:34:06,235 --> 00:34:07,321
You see that guy
right there?

634
00:34:08,105 --> 00:34:08,861
That's her husband.

635
00:34:09,527 --> 00:34:12,492
Do not under any circumstances
let him be alone with her.

636
00:34:12,738 --> 00:34:13,222
Why?

637
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:15,401
Because it's his fault
that she's in here.

638
00:34:15,788 --> 00:34:17,380
He's a dangerous guy.
Now I've warned you.

639
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:20,002
If anything happens
to her, you're liable.

640
00:34:23,167 --> 00:34:24,080
Night, Dad.

641
00:34:40,698 --> 00:34:41,361
Oh, you're home.

642
00:34:42,427 --> 00:34:44,173
I thought you'd still be
out on your date.

643
00:34:44,438 --> 00:34:45,812
Date's over.
What do you want?

644
00:34:46,476 --> 00:34:48,872
Oh, I thought since I can't
take you out for your birthday,

645
00:34:48,895 --> 00:34:50,540
I'd at least leave
you a present.

646
00:34:52,415 --> 00:34:54,013
Don't worry.
It's not expensive.

647
00:34:59,427 --> 00:35:01,633
Ah, Zach!

648
00:35:04,187 --> 00:35:05,430
So how'd your date go?

649
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:08,560
Is he crazy?
You're not old.

650
00:35:10,645 --> 00:35:13,201
You did not see the look on his
face when I tried to kiss him.

651
00:35:14,465 --> 00:35:16,421
It's like he was
sniffing expired milk.

652
00:35:17,478 --> 00:35:20,132
That's ridiculous.
You're gorgeous,

653
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:22,782
And you're just gonna
get prettier every year.

654
00:35:23,638 --> 00:35:26,020
Ah, that's so sweet...

655
00:35:26,485 --> 00:35:27,461
But it's a lie.

656
00:35:28,688 --> 00:35:30,911
Every tick of the clock
takes away something.

657
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:36,383
Zach, what am I gonna do
when I'm not pretty anymore?

658
00:35:40,335 --> 00:35:41,553
That's never
gonna happen.

659
00:35:44,157 --> 00:35:45,601
I'm gonna take
a little nap, okay?

660
00:35:45,915 --> 00:35:46,921
Just for a minute.

661
00:35:49,778 --> 00:35:51,210
Take as long
as you like.

662
00:36:04,776 --> 00:36:07,842
Susan, I've looked
everywhere for you.

663
00:36:08,678 --> 00:36:10,691
I didn't think
to start with the, um...

664
00:36:11,968 --> 00:36:12,990
embalming room.

665
00:36:14,386 --> 00:36:16,642
Yeah. I'll be having
night terrors from now on...

666
00:36:18,318 --> 00:36:19,413
which I deserve.

667
00:36:20,965 --> 00:36:23,803
Look, no one
is judging you.

668
00:36:24,165 --> 00:36:26,463
If anything, they're judging
that dreadful Lynn.

669
00:36:26,927 --> 00:36:28,693
I should be thanking you
for driving her away.

670
00:36:29,605 --> 00:36:31,700
It usually takes a crucifix
and some garlic.

671
00:36:32,548 --> 00:36:35,092
I'm so sorry
I ruined Jane's funeral.

672
00:36:35,585 --> 00:36:36,993
No, you didn't.

673
00:36:36,998 --> 00:36:38,323
Yes, I did.

674
00:36:40,838 --> 00:36:41,690
It's just...

675
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:43,700
What?

676
00:36:46,005 --> 00:36:48,330
I thought after we got
through this really...

677
00:36:49,148 --> 00:36:50,211
painful day,

678
00:36:50,548 --> 00:36:52,200
things would start
to get better.

679
00:36:54,968 --> 00:36:57,132
I thought I could be
more a part of your world.

680
00:36:59,448 --> 00:37:01,722
Now all your friends and family
are just gonna think of me

681
00:37:01,725 --> 00:37:04,160
as the crazy lady
from Jane's funeral.

682
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:07,650
Oh, God. Oh, Ian.

683
00:37:07,706 --> 00:37:09,760
Okay, this is not
supposed to be about me.

684
00:37:09,767 --> 00:37:13,442
You should be upstairs...
saying good-bye.

685
00:37:15,888 --> 00:37:17,811
I'm just gonna
hide out here

686
00:37:18,176 --> 00:37:20,611
with the departed
until everybody leaves.

687
00:37:22,386 --> 00:37:22,922
No.

688
00:37:24,747 --> 00:37:25,482
No more hiding.

689
00:37:25,717 --> 00:37:27,071
We have been doing
it far too long.

690
00:37:29,587 --> 00:37:31,521
You have nothing
to be ashamed of.

691
00:37:32,105 --> 00:37:34,391
You helped me through the
most difficult part of my life.

692
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:37,201
I love you, and I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

693
00:37:37,205 --> 00:37:38,502
I want to marry you.

694
00:37:40,576 --> 00:37:42,101
Ian, are you
proposing to me?

695
00:37:44,098 --> 00:37:44,572
Well...

696
00:37:45,646 --> 00:37:47,933
I guess maybe I... I am.

697
00:37:50,107 --> 00:37:51,271
Before you say
another word...

698
00:37:52,247 --> 00:37:53,161
Take a look around.

699
00:37:54,948 --> 00:37:56,821
Ah. Right.

700
00:37:58,106 --> 00:37:59,931
I hadn't really thought a lot
about this moment,

701
00:37:59,946 --> 00:38:01,143
but when I did...

702
00:38:02,008 --> 00:38:04,013
the table we were at
didn't have a blood gutter.

703
00:38:05,935 --> 00:38:09,653
Then may I reopen the subject at
a more opportune time and place?

704
00:38:13,268 --> 00:38:14,171
Yes.

705
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:20,861
I accept your
proposal to propose.

706
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:24,102
Shall we?

707
00:38:33,156 --> 00:38:35,171
Now I want you
to dig deep.

708
00:38:36,128 --> 00:38:37,993
If you feel your
memory blocked,

709
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:41,703
just count to three,
and the block will melt away.

710
00:38:42,577 --> 00:38:46,422
It is natural and easy
for you to recall anything.

711
00:38:47,456 --> 00:38:49,862
Now remember
Monique Polier.

712
00:38:50,557 --> 00:38:53,023
Remember the night
you met her.

713
00:38:56,226 --> 00:38:56,920
Ms. Polier?

714
00:38:59,446 --> 00:39:01,903
I've, uh... got that
part for the sink.

715
00:39:04,248 --> 00:39:04,771
Hello?

716
00:39:16,685 --> 00:39:17,143
Sorry.

717
00:39:18,566 --> 00:39:20,193
Monique's upstairs
taking a nap.

718
00:39:20,408 --> 00:39:21,681
She wasn't feeling well.

719
00:39:26,936 --> 00:39:29,001
Mike? Did you
see something?

720
00:39:33,677 --> 00:39:34,612
I'm her boyfriend.

721
00:39:34,697 --> 00:39:38,133
I, uh, figured she'd want to
wake up to a clean kitchen.

722
00:39:40,805 --> 00:39:43,562
Well, I'll just finish up with the
sink and be out of your hair.

723
00:39:45,345 --> 00:39:47,043
Why don't you let me
take care of the sink?

724
00:39:47,766 --> 00:39:50,141
I mean, I'm pretty handy,
and it's getting late.

725
00:39:51,687 --> 00:39:52,702
I don't mind staying.

726
00:39:53,106 --> 00:39:55,361
No, look, it's okay.
I got it under control.

727
00:39:56,575 --> 00:39:57,130
Here.

728
00:39:58,618 --> 00:39:59,930
Well, this should cover
what we owe you.

729
00:40:06,708 --> 00:40:08,611
Tell Ms. Polier
I hope she feels better.

730
00:40:08,816 --> 00:40:09,471
Will do.

731
00:40:11,866 --> 00:40:12,480
Oh, hey...

732
00:40:14,398 --> 00:40:15,503
Don't forget
your wrench.

733
00:40:22,388 --> 00:40:24,112
Mike? Where
are you going?

734
00:40:24,707 --> 00:40:25,190
Mike!

735
00:40:33,498 --> 00:40:34,841
Hey, Mr. Delfino.

736
00:40:35,536 --> 00:40:37,701
I need to talk
to your stepdad.

737
00:40:37,905 --> 00:40:40,652
Orson's not here. He went
to the hospital with my Mom.

738
00:40:42,446 --> 00:40:44,322
She's fine!
Thanks for asking!

739
00:40:51,256 --> 00:40:51,942
Mr. Hodge?

740
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:54,901
You're wife's just sleeping.

741
00:40:55,207 --> 00:40:56,950
I suggest you go home
and do the same.

742
00:40:59,517 --> 00:41:00,063
I will.

743
00:41:02,066 --> 00:41:02,801
You're okay?

744
00:41:04,836 --> 00:41:06,180
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

745
00:41:07,177 --> 00:41:08,063
It's just, uh...

746
00:41:11,216 --> 00:41:13,191
There was a time where
we were all so happy.

747
00:41:14,478 --> 00:41:16,422
I just don't seem to
remember it anymore.

748
00:41:18,157 --> 00:41:21,471
Recapturing the past
is a tricky business.

749
00:41:22,295 --> 00:41:25,991
While most memories are just
memories of a happier time...

750
00:41:26,587 --> 00:41:27,212
Hey, there.

751
00:41:27,947 --> 00:41:31,441
Others can be
quite deadly.

752
00:41:32,758 --> 00:41:33,413
Hey, Mike.

753
00:41:34,758 --> 00:41:35,951
What brings you
to the hospital?

754
00:41:36,966 --> 00:41:39,080
I've been seeing
an hypnotherapist.

755
00:41:40,326 --> 00:41:42,452
She's helping me fill the
gaps of my memory.

756
00:41:43,957 --> 00:41:44,953
How is it going?

757
00:41:47,196 --> 00:41:48,043
It's working.
