00:00:00,369 --> 00:00:02,129
Previously on Desperate Housewives...

2
00:00:02,179 --> 00:00:05,648
A reporter just did a story on homeless
teens, my son is one of them.

3
00:00:05,741 --> 00:00:06,501
Oh, my God.

4
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:08,003
Orson found Andrew.

5
00:00:08,287 --> 00:00:12,120
Have I done stuff for money that
I'm not proud of? Yeah, sure.

6
00:00:12,154 --> 00:00:14,066
And the prodigal son returned.

7
00:00:17,897 --> 00:00:19,725
Mike fell into a coma...

8
00:00:19,796 --> 00:00:22,716
-What could be more romantic?
-I could think of... of something.

9
00:00:22,766 --> 00:00:25,539
And Susan fell into the
arms of another man...

10
00:00:26,597 --> 00:00:27,921
a bit too soon.

11
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,986
The day Mike Delfino
woke from his coma,

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,253
Edie Britt was
the first to know.

13
00:00:41,832 --> 00:00:44,138
Once she was sure
he was responsive...

14
00:00:44,187 --> 00:00:44,912
Mike?

15
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,862
Edie decided to share
the good news with others.

16
00:00:51,065 --> 00:00:53,281
Code red! Code red!

17
00:00:53,857 --> 00:00:55,442
My friend just woke
up from his coma.

18
00:00:56,196 --> 00:00:59,081
And that is how word
began to spread.

19
00:00:59,635 --> 00:01:01,410
Mike's physician, Dr. Craig,

20
00:01:01,465 --> 00:01:04,352
was busy with a patient
when he first heard the news.

21
00:01:05,215 --> 00:01:08,522
Not long after,
he called his aunt Ida,

22
00:01:08,557 --> 00:01:10,471
who was busy
knitting a sweater.

23
00:01:11,546 --> 00:01:15,700
She told Lynette Scavo,
who was busy watering her lawn.

24
00:01:16,306 --> 00:01:18,311
And she told her husband Tom,

25
00:01:18,415 --> 00:01:20,583
who was busy playing
at computer game.

26
00:01:21,236 --> 00:01:23,332
He then e-mailed
his friend Carlos,

27
00:01:23,425 --> 00:01:26,550
Who was busy plotting strategy
with his divorce lawyer.

28
00:01:28,076 --> 00:01:31,501
And Carlos called his
soon-to-be ex-wife Gabrielle,

29
00:01:31,886 --> 00:01:34,162
who was busy doing
the same with hers.

30
00:01:35,607 --> 00:01:38,772
Yes, word of Mike's
miraculous recovery

31
00:01:38,855 --> 00:01:41,510
spread quickly
throughout Wisteria Lane,

32
00:01:42,028 --> 00:01:45,702
And stopped cold
everyone's busy, busy life...

33
00:01:47,237 --> 00:01:48,661
Everyone, that is...

34
00:01:49,387 --> 00:01:51,880
Except for Susan Mayer,

35
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:54,682
who was busy doing something

36
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:56,480
she would soon wish...

37
00:01:57,686 --> 00:01:58,970
she hadn't.

40
00:02:43,088 --> 00:02:47,203
Edward Sibley was the beloved
founder of the town of Fairview.

41
00:02:47,826 --> 00:02:48,850
Prior to that,

44
00:02:54,976 --> 00:02:56,452
and a horse thief.

45
00:02:57,155 --> 00:03:01,310
Of course, no one remembers
those parts of Edward's past.

46
00:03:02,325 --> 00:03:06,533
Luckily for him, history is
designed to be rewritten...

47
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:10,531
And no one knew this
better than Bree Hodge.

48
00:03:10,598 --> 00:03:12,232
So you're just gonna
lie to people?

49
00:03:12,245 --> 00:03:15,743
Oh, I'm not talking about
a lie. Just a polite fiction

50
00:03:15,758 --> 00:03:17,343
to explain to everybody
where you've been.

51
00:03:17,506 --> 00:03:18,920
I mean, we can't
possibly tell them that

52
00:03:18,975 --> 00:03:21,620
you've been living on skid row,
sleeping in a cardboard box.

53
00:03:22,115 --> 00:03:24,671
So why do I have to go
to this history fair anyway?

54
00:03:24,725 --> 00:03:26,542
I mean, it's just some
dumb school contest.

55
00:03:26,565 --> 00:03:28,262
We all know Danielle's
not gonna win.

56
00:03:28,516 --> 00:03:30,920
She never wins anything.
Is it weird eating off plates?

57
00:03:30,975 --> 00:03:32,432
'Cause if you were more
comfortable, you could just

58
00:03:32,488 --> 00:03:35,820
aat straight out of the garbage.
This is a family event,

59
00:03:35,825 --> 00:03:37,690
and we're all gonna
enjoy it together.

60
00:03:37,895 --> 00:03:41,133
Now, Danielle, stop sniping and start
thinking of an alibi for your brother.

61
00:03:41,168 --> 00:03:44,782
I know. We could say he joined a cult,
and we had to kidnap and deprogram him.

62
00:03:44,915 --> 00:03:47,903
Well, that would certainly spare
the family some embarrassment.

63
00:03:48,115 --> 00:03:49,850
Why not throw in
a killing spree, too?

64
00:03:50,407 --> 00:03:53,082
Well, here's a thought.
We say he was at drama camp.

65
00:03:53,686 --> 00:03:56,780
It reflects Andrew's interest
in the performing arts,

66
00:03:56,835 --> 00:03:58,563
while giving us
a private joke to savor

67
00:03:58,615 --> 00:04:01,132
about the drama
of his estrangement.

68
00:04:02,398 --> 00:04:04,670
Uh, yeah,
he is always like that.

69
00:04:05,157 --> 00:04:08,970
Uh, guys, why can't
we just tell the truth?

70
00:04:10,587 --> 00:04:12,693
Uh, I got out of line,
you kicked me out,

71
00:04:12,746 --> 00:04:14,541
I lived on the street,
and I came back home.

72
00:04:17,077 --> 00:04:19,130
We'll need a name
for this drama camp.

73
00:04:21,205 --> 00:04:23,151
We got ties here, people!

74
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,203
Designer ties,
two for a dollar!

75
00:04:27,677 --> 00:04:29,211
Oh, do you like
those barbells?

76
00:04:29,676 --> 00:04:31,190
Make me an offer.
I'm feeling generous.

77
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,183
Here's the customer
I've been waiting for.

78
00:04:36,728 --> 00:04:38,030
I'll give you $5 for this.

79
00:04:38,735 --> 00:04:41,382
Carlos, I see you got my flier.
You're having a garage sale

80
00:04:41,386 --> 00:04:43,710
featuring menswear
and sporting equipment.

81
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:46,643
I need cash, and you don't expect
me to sell my stuff, do you?

82
00:04:47,345 --> 00:04:49,390
Those are my good cuff links!

83
00:04:49,477 --> 00:04:51,180
Those are my cds!

84
00:04:52,445 --> 00:04:53,851
Oh, my God,
this is my baby blanket.

85
00:04:53,856 --> 00:04:55,121
My MamÃ¡ knitted this!

86
00:04:55,868 --> 00:04:57,431
And it pains me to sell it.

87
00:04:57,835 --> 00:04:59,263
It's just that my lawyer told me

88
00:04:59,318 --> 00:05:00,893
what you're offering
for spousal support,

89
00:05:00,946 --> 00:05:02,593
and I can't get by on that.

90
00:05:02,687 --> 00:05:03,792
Hey, I am doing
the best that I can.

91
00:05:03,796 --> 00:05:05,141
I've got a few deals
in the pipeline,

92
00:05:05,146 --> 00:05:08,850
but I'm not making near as much as
I used to. So I should be punished?

93
00:05:08,905 --> 00:05:11,762
Attention, shoppers,
for the next 20 minutes,

94
00:05:11,885 --> 00:05:13,772
free golf club with
every purchase!

95
00:05:15,258 --> 00:05:16,573
Gaby, I'm trying to be civil,

96
00:05:17,088 --> 00:05:18,603
but if you don't
knock it off right now,

97
00:05:18,687 --> 00:05:20,420
I swear, the gloves are coming off.

98
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:22,382
Oh, honey, the gloves
aren't just off...

99
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:24,581
They're 70% off!

100
00:05:24,595 --> 00:05:26,451
Get your cashmere gloves!

101
00:05:31,658 --> 00:05:33,553
Hey, Parker,
where's your uniform?

102
00:05:33,557 --> 00:05:35,161
You got your game in an hour.

103
00:05:35,756 --> 00:05:37,333
No, I don't. I quit.

104
00:05:37,835 --> 00:05:38,401
W hat?

105
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:39,442
I hate baseball.

106
00:05:39,727 --> 00:05:41,711
Daddy  said I don't have
to play it anymore.

107
00:05:42,248 --> 00:05:44,311
Well, daddy should have
checked with mommy,

108
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:47,032
so she could have a chance
to tell him why he's wrong.

109
00:05:47,277 --> 00:05:48,990
Hey, you're playing.

110
00:05:49,556 --> 00:05:51,093
But, mom, I suck!

111
00:05:51,236 --> 00:05:52,660
Everybody says so.

112
00:05:53,045 --> 00:05:55,230
That's why they made up
a fake position for me.

113
00:05:55,535 --> 00:05:56,892
It is not fake.

114
00:05:56,967 --> 00:06:01,521
There is not a team I know that could get
along without their backup far right fielder.

115
00:06:02,626 --> 00:06:04,202
Okay, come on,
let's go practice.

116
00:06:07,357 --> 00:06:09,032
All right, let's try it again.

117
00:06:09,086 --> 00:06:11,052
Nice and easy.
Watch the ball hit the bat.

118
00:06:11,088 --> 00:06:13,200
You ready? You can do it.
Here we go.

119
00:06:14,896 --> 00:06:15,823
Okay, Parker,

120
00:06:15,877 --> 00:06:17,982
I keep telling you, you gotta
keep your eyes open.

121
00:06:18,017 --> 00:06:19,802
How are you gonna hit the
ball when you're doing this?

122
00:06:19,855 --> 00:06:22,263
You threw it too fast.
Throw slower.

123
00:06:22,317 --> 00:06:24,781
If I threw any slower,
we would be bowling.

124
00:06:24,946 --> 00:06:25,783
Hey.

125
00:06:26,748 --> 00:06:28,272
Hey, whatcha guys doing?

126
00:06:28,557 --> 00:06:30,251
I'll tell you what
we're not doing, quitting.

127
00:06:31,107 --> 00:06:32,713
Oh, hey, buddy,
did you change your mind?

128
00:06:32,808 --> 00:06:33,783
No.

129
00:06:34,655 --> 00:06:36,750
Lynette, I told him that
he didn't have to play anymore.

130
00:06:36,756 --> 00:06:38,352
He's got five more
games in the season.

131
00:06:38,407 --> 00:06:40,382
He made a commitment.
He's gonna see it through.

132
00:06:40,907 --> 00:06:42,881
But, Lynette, he doesn't like it,

133
00:06:43,046 --> 00:06:44,663
and if you haven't noticed,
he kind of sucks.

134
00:06:44,746 --> 00:06:46,193
Yeah, well, that's not the point.

135
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:49,423
What kind of message are we sending if we
let him quit whenever the going gets rough?

136
00:06:49,466 --> 00:06:52,590
Honey, it is kids' baseball. It's a way to
kill three hours before they eat pizza.

137
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:54,040
Why you being such a hard-ass?

138
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:56,510
Well, it's called parenting, Tom.
Watch and learn.

139
00:07:01,538 --> 00:07:03,261
Okay, P-Dog,

140
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:04,722
this is a curveball.

141
00:07:09,546 --> 00:07:11,973
Again, opening the eyes.
Can't stress it enough.

142
00:07:16,028 --> 00:07:17,920
Are you sure it's okay
if we stay another day?

143
00:07:17,978 --> 00:07:21,791
Well, let's see. What excuse did we use
when we had this conversation yesterday?

144
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,176
That we work hard,
and we deserve to relax.

145
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,723
No, I believe that was
last Thursday's rationale.

146
00:07:26,892 --> 00:07:29,008
-Uh, fresh air is good for us?
-Ah, Tuesday.

147
00:07:29,057 --> 00:07:29,860
Okay, here's one...

148
00:07:30,025 --> 00:07:32,603
Julie needs to spend more
time bonding with her father.

149
00:07:32,707 --> 00:07:33,693
Brilliant!

150
00:07:35,298 --> 00:07:36,290
If we keep this up,

151
00:07:36,297 --> 00:07:37,431
we could stay here
till christmas.

152
00:07:40,158 --> 00:07:42,443
You know, sometimes
when you smile like that,

153
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:44,163
That, that really makes
me think that, that...

154
00:07:45,518 --> 00:07:47,250
What? What were
you gonna say?

155
00:07:47,726 --> 00:07:49,452
Well, it makes me think
that could love you.

156
00:07:52,156 --> 00:07:55,821
I... don't mean "love" in the
swooning schoolboy sense.

157
00:07:55,858 --> 00:07:57,851
You know,
fireworks exploding,

158
00:07:57,905 --> 00:07:59,281
Bells ringing.

159
00:07:59,338 --> 00:08:01,373
To me, it's about this...

160
00:08:01,477 --> 00:08:04,223
A mundane task
that's suddenly a joy,

161
00:08:04,225 --> 00:08:05,832
because of who
you're doing it with.

162
00:08:06,107 --> 00:08:07,571
That's love to me.

163
00:08:08,006 --> 00:08:09,592
Someone to fluff
while you fold,

164
00:08:09,608 --> 00:08:11,530
someone to whisper
to at a boring party,

165
00:08:11,636 --> 00:08:12,242
Someone to...

166
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:14,573
Shh. Do you mind?

167
00:08:14,855 --> 00:08:17,173
You're kind of drowning
out the bells.

168
00:08:19,695 --> 00:08:20,693
So I am.

169
00:08:28,668 --> 00:08:30,830
I think I can feed myself now.

170
00:08:30,888 --> 00:08:32,472
Mm, you said that yesterday,

171
00:08:32,527 --> 00:08:34,343
And I wound up with
a cleavage full of pudding.

172
00:08:34,998 --> 00:08:36,003
You heard the therapist.

173
00:08:36,007 --> 00:08:38,441
It's gonna be weeks
before you're up and running.

174
00:08:41,517 --> 00:08:44,472
I just wanna get home, unpack.

175
00:08:44,746 --> 00:08:47,552
You just let home
come to you, okay?

176
00:08:48,147 --> 00:08:50,020
The whole street's
dying to see you.

177
00:08:50,145 --> 00:08:53,480
Bree is even bakin'
ya a peach pie.

178
00:08:54,975 --> 00:08:56,881
She's the redhead, right?

179
00:08:57,956 --> 00:08:58,533
Right.

180
00:08:59,555 --> 00:09:00,752
Husband's a doctor...

181
00:09:02,427 --> 00:09:03,042
Rex.

182
00:09:05,505 --> 00:09:06,831
Rex is dead.

183
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:09,690
Really?

184
00:09:10,615 --> 00:09:11,391
When did that happen?

185
00:09:12,146 --> 00:09:13,183
About a year and a half ago.

186
00:09:13,606 --> 00:09:14,473
What?

187
00:09:14,776 --> 00:09:16,771
Yeah. You were at his funeral.

188
00:09:16,978 --> 00:09:19,070
What are you talking about?
That's not possible.

189
00:09:19,228 --> 00:09:21,063
I just met him right
before my accident.

190
00:09:24,427 --> 00:09:25,302
Mike...

191
00:09:26,088 --> 00:09:27,420
What year is it?

192
00:09:29,057 --> 00:09:31,163
2004. Why?

193
00:09:34,528 --> 00:09:37,143
It's called retrograde memory loss.

194
00:09:37,197 --> 00:09:40,102
It's caused by the swelling
and frontal lobe damage.

195
00:09:40,457 --> 00:09:42,953
You say he's lost two whole years?

196
00:09:43,528 --> 00:09:45,703
Yeah. Is that unusual?

197
00:09:45,755 --> 00:09:49,070
Ah,  patients more typically
lose several weeks.

198
00:09:50,695 --> 00:09:53,003
The damage may be more
severe than we thought.

199
00:09:53,228 --> 00:09:55,222
Well, do you think
he'll get his memory back?

200
00:09:55,325 --> 00:09:57,732
He might,
at least partially.

201
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:00,083
You could be of some
assistance with that.

202
00:10:00,825 --> 00:10:01,392
How?

203
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,263
Bring  him some personal belongings.

204
00:10:03,297 --> 00:10:04,543
Photos, letters.

205
00:10:05,398 --> 00:10:07,573
He's gonna need some help
to remember what he can't.

206
00:10:10,868 --> 00:10:12,980
Oh, I'm sure I could
fill in a few blanks.

207
00:10:23,738 --> 00:10:25,161
Hey, did I tell you that, uh,

208
00:10:25,217 --> 00:10:27,473
Burnham Fox is looking
for a new creative director?

209
00:10:27,528 --> 00:10:30,673
P.R.? What makes you think
I wanna work for a P.R. firm?

210
00:10:30,887 --> 00:10:35,040
Easy hours, big paycheck,
access to great parties...

211
00:10:35,377 --> 00:10:36,573
Yeah, what was I thinking?

212
00:10:36,628 --> 00:10:39,252
Honey, we agreed that
I would chase my dreams,

213
00:10:39,586 --> 00:10:40,413
and that ain't it.

214
00:10:41,827 --> 00:10:43,500
Look, I was just
making conversation.

215
00:10:43,627 --> 00:10:44,340
Batter up!

216
00:10:44,866 --> 00:10:46,250
Is he up?
Oh, come on!

217
00:10:49,026 --> 00:10:51,672
Come on, Parker!
Keep your eye on the ball!

218
00:10:56,026 --> 00:10:56,781
Strike one!

219
00:10:58,555 --> 00:11:01,180
Hey, people,
he's just a kid, okay?

220
00:11:01,236 --> 00:11:01,802
Come on.

221
00:11:04,306 --> 00:11:05,060
Strike two!

222
00:11:06,156 --> 00:11:08,400
Hey, hey,
that is not helpful.

223
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:11,452
It only takes one, Parker!
Only takes one! Come on, Parker!

224
00:11:11,957 --> 00:11:13,040
It's not your son's fault.

225
00:11:13,045 --> 00:11:15,112
He's just up against
the best pitcher in the league.

226
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:16,991
Yeah, guy's a machine.
Who is that kid?

227
00:11:17,056 --> 00:11:19,132
Nicky Abbott.
He's a neighbor of mine.

228
00:11:19,216 --> 00:11:21,813
The kid's got an arm
like a 13-year-old.

229
00:11:24,376 --> 00:11:26,152
Strike three! You're out!

230
00:11:29,158 --> 00:11:30,363
I'm gonna go buy
him an ice cream.

231
00:11:32,967 --> 00:11:34,552
It's okay, P-Dog.

232
00:11:34,587 --> 00:11:36,411
You're gonna get 'em
the next inning!

233
00:11:47,795 --> 00:11:48,521
So tell me,

234
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:51,233
what else do you know
about this Nicky kid?

235
00:11:54,457 --> 00:11:55,580
You're short 50 cents.

236
00:11:55,655 --> 00:11:56,892
Please, that's all I got.

237
00:11:57,527 --> 00:12:00,263
Hey, give the kid
what he wants.

238
00:12:03,226 --> 00:12:03,882
Thanks.

239
00:12:03,936 --> 00:12:05,603
Hey, aren't you, uh,
Parker Scavo's mom?

240
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:06,483
That's right.

241
00:12:07,187 --> 00:12:09,203
Come. Walk with me.

242
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:12,251
So...

243
00:12:13,298 --> 00:12:14,491
Money's a little tight, huh?

244
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:15,502
A little.

245
00:12:15,587 --> 00:12:17,541
Yeah, I heard your old
man's out of work.

246
00:12:17,598 --> 00:12:18,763
That's gotta be tough.

247
00:12:19,145 --> 00:12:21,111
Yeah, they, uh,
cut my allowance.

248
00:12:21,147 --> 00:12:23,482
No! A kid's gotta
have an allowance.

249
00:12:23,518 --> 00:12:25,940
How else you gonna buy
the things you want, right?

250
00:12:26,517 --> 00:12:27,992
Like that cotton candy.

251
00:12:29,088 --> 00:12:30,842
That's a little piece
of heaven, huh?

252
00:12:32,515 --> 00:12:36,810
Hey, I got an idea. Maybe we
could help each other out.

253
00:12:36,845 --> 00:12:38,632
My son's having a little
trouble hitting the ball.

254
00:12:39,045 --> 00:12:40,043
Yeah, I saw that.

255
00:12:40,255 --> 00:12:40,743
Yeah.

256
00:12:43,948 --> 00:12:44,663
Ever seen one of these?

257
00:13:01,045 --> 00:13:02,753
Carlos, what are you doing here?

258
00:13:03,045 --> 00:13:05,000
I mean, besides loring
my property value.

259
00:13:05,237 --> 00:13:06,392
I had a little news,

260
00:13:06,407 --> 00:13:08,383
and I wanted to see your
face when I delivered it.

261
00:13:10,008 --> 00:13:11,230
I'm tired of fighting,

262
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:15,951
So I called my lawyer and told him to give
in to your demands for spousal support.

263
00:13:16,298 --> 00:13:16,962
Really?

264
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:21,030
Wow. Well, thank you.

265
00:13:22,997 --> 00:13:25,043
Okay, you've seen my face.
Now you can beat it.

266
00:13:25,878 --> 00:13:26,941
Wait. There's more.

267
00:13:28,578 --> 00:13:30,930
Since I'm gonna be giving
you all that money,

268
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,030
I have to cut back
on some stuff,

269
00:13:33,376 --> 00:13:34,960
like the rent
on my apartment.

270
00:13:35,378 --> 00:13:37,602
But the good news is,
according to my lawyer,

271
00:13:37,675 --> 00:13:40,070
I'm completely within
my rights to do this...

272
00:13:46,248 --> 00:13:48,581
Honey,  I'm home.

273
00:13:51,145 --> 00:13:53,061
Wait! You can't stay here!

274
00:13:54,005 --> 00:13:55,681
Now there's the face
that I was looking for.

275
00:13:59,568 --> 00:14:00,722
Batter up!

276
00:14:10,567 --> 00:14:11,530
Strike one!

277
00:14:12,038 --> 00:14:14,141
Wow, that was
kind of slow.

278
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:15,791
His arm must be getting tired.

279
00:14:16,245 --> 00:14:19,383
Yeah, well,
after all those fastballs...

280
00:14:19,415 --> 00:14:21,013
Come on, Parker!

281
00:14:21,045 --> 00:14:22,623
You can do it!

282
00:14:27,345 --> 00:14:28,232
Strike two!

283
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:42,711
Oh, my God! Yes!

284
00:15:25,036 --> 00:15:26,383
-Mr. Faladi.
-Yes?

285
00:15:26,515 --> 00:15:29,621
Yes? I cannot thank you enough for
getting Danielle interested in history.

286
00:15:29,636 --> 00:15:32,770
She has never worked so
hard on a project before.

287
00:15:33,178 --> 00:15:36,750
Well, don't tell anyone,
but she is my favorite student.

288
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:41,180
Oh, and it's so good to
see that Andrew's back.

289
00:15:41,236 --> 00:15:42,321
Where's he been
all this time?

290
00:15:43,807 --> 00:15:44,681
Drama camp.

291
00:15:44,998 --> 00:15:47,071
A very prestigious drama camp.

292
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:05,283
Do I know you?

293
00:16:06,015 --> 00:16:09,211
Yeah, uh, you gave me a ride
in your black Sedan once.

294
00:16:10,018 --> 00:16:12,823
You know, the one
with the reclining seats?

295
00:16:14,876 --> 00:16:16,282
-Excuse me.
-Yeah.

296
00:16:19,016 --> 00:16:20,303
Wasn't that Dr. Keck?

297
00:16:21,098 --> 00:16:21,852
You know him?

298
00:16:22,097 --> 00:16:24,023
Yeah. Yeah, we, uh...

299
00:16:24,385 --> 00:16:25,901
met at drama camp.

300
00:16:26,326 --> 00:16:27,132
Oh, good Lord.

301
00:16:27,955 --> 00:16:28,613
You mean, you...

302
00:16:28,617 --> 00:16:32,712
Yeah, I "performed" for him once.

303
00:16:33,295 --> 00:16:34,241
Are you all right?

304
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,543
I'll be all right. I'm fine.

305
00:16:36,907 --> 00:16:38,181
Howard Keck?

306
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:39,711
You sure?

307
00:16:40,315 --> 00:16:42,743
I mean, he's a very respected
member of the community.

308
00:16:42,977 --> 00:16:45,033
Yeah, well, they all were.

309
00:16:53,605 --> 00:16:57,460
What were you and Andrew
talking about today at the fair?

310
00:16:58,077 --> 00:16:59,803
Uh, nothing.

311
00:17:01,877 --> 00:17:03,700
I was gonna make some cocoa.
Would you like some?

312
00:17:03,755 --> 00:17:07,291
Orson, I saw the two of you whispering
right after Dr. Keck ran off.

313
00:17:07,378 --> 00:17:08,372
What happened?

314
00:17:15,218 --> 00:17:18,380
Look, Andrew asked me
not to say anything,

315
00:17:18,395 --> 00:17:20,590
but I don't want there to be
any secrets between us,

316
00:17:21,435 --> 00:17:23,020
so please don't
let him know I told you.

317
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:25,513
Well, of course not.
What is it?

318
00:17:26,305 --> 00:17:28,023
How to put this? Uh...

319
00:17:29,278 --> 00:17:30,581
When Andrew
was on the street,

320
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:33,750
he, uh, he didn't just
beg for money.

321
00:17:34,128 --> 00:17:35,561
At times, he...

322
00:17:36,246 --> 00:17:38,302
Well, he did things to earn it.

323
00:17:38,637 --> 00:17:41,562
Oh, good. I mean, I'd hate to
think he had no work ethic at all.

324
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:44,432
Uh, what I mean is...

325
00:17:45,905 --> 00:17:48,893
Men hired him, uh, to...

326
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:52,362
Do things, things
he wasn't very proud of.

327
00:17:53,918 --> 00:17:54,930
Yard work?

328
00:17:55,946 --> 00:17:56,611
Afraid  not.

329
00:17:57,936 --> 00:17:59,280
Orson, you're scaring me.

330
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:00,681
Did he do something awful?

331
00:18:00,866 --> 00:18:02,500
No! Nonot awful.

332
00:18:02,767 --> 00:18:05,521
I mean, people do it all
the time. I do it with you.

333
00:18:06,508 --> 00:18:08,381
I just don't pay you for it.

334
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:14,291
I think someone
could use a cocoa.

335
00:18:19,486 --> 00:18:21,740
Look, we mustn't judge Andrew.

336
00:18:22,087 --> 00:18:24,241
-He was desperate.
-I'll never forgive myself.

337
00:18:24,258 --> 00:18:26,302
It's all my fault for pushing him
away.

338
00:18:26,366 --> 00:18:28,001
Bree, don't do that to yourself.

339
00:18:28,246 --> 00:18:30,693
The important thing now is
that he's home and he's safe.

340
00:18:30,745 --> 00:18:32,450
How does this Dr. Keck
fit into all of this?

341
00:18:32,455 --> 00:18:35,081
I mean, is he treating Andrew
for some awful disease?

342
00:18:36,005 --> 00:18:37,941
Actually, I think
he was one of Andrew's...

343
00:18:38,496 --> 00:18:39,243
clients.

344
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:40,830
Howard Keck?!

345
00:18:41,088 --> 00:18:43,010
Oh, that's ridiculous.
He's got a wife and a daughter.

346
00:18:43,297 --> 00:18:45,422
He plays on Tom Scavo's bowling team.

347
00:18:45,506 --> 00:18:47,670
Well, that's clearly not
the only team he plays for.

348
00:18:48,898 --> 00:18:51,220
This is a nightmare,
an absolute nightmare.

349
00:18:53,405 --> 00:18:55,662
Please don't cut into that pie.
I made it for Mike.

350
00:18:56,356 --> 00:18:58,750
Mike? Delfino?

351
00:18:58,826 --> 00:18:59,992
Yes. I left you two messages.

352
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:01,191
Didn't you check your voice mail?

353
00:19:01,205 --> 00:19:02,822
He woke up from his coma.

354
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:10,013
Who is it? It is Sharla Banning?

355
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:13,182
I'm not telling who it is.
I'm just asking the question.

356
00:19:13,238 --> 00:19:15,721
If you know a husband
has been unfaithful,

357
00:19:16,097 --> 00:19:17,683
do you tell the wife?

358
00:19:17,696 --> 00:19:20,110
Absolutely. If he's cheating,
he could bring home a disease.

359
00:19:20,115 --> 00:19:23,492
Okay, that's what I was thinking. I mean,
that's how Bunny Connors got chlamydia.

360
00:19:23,546 --> 00:19:25,840
She told me she got it from wearing
someone else's bathing suit.

361
00:19:25,845 --> 00:19:27,331
No, that's how she got crabs.

362
00:19:29,298 --> 00:19:30,682
Poor Bunny.
It's always something.

363
00:19:30,738 --> 00:19:32,900
If it's not the clap,
it's a botched face-lift.

364
00:19:33,675 --> 00:19:34,880
Be that as it may,

365
00:19:35,018 --> 00:19:37,371
do we all agree that
I should tell this man's wife?

366
00:19:37,516 --> 00:19:38,172
I wouldn't.

367
00:19:38,817 --> 00:19:41,000
Women always say they wanna know
if their husband's cheating,

368
00:19:41,007 --> 00:19:43,011
and they always resent
the person who tells them.

369
00:19:43,067 --> 00:19:44,960
So if Tom was cheating,
you wouldn't tell me?

370
00:19:45,066 --> 00:19:48,293
No! But I would hire someone
to beat the crap out of him.

371
00:19:48,425 --> 00:19:49,913
Aw, you're sweet.

372
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:55,770
Bree, I'm sorry. I think you gotta
follow your heart on this one,

373
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:58,130
even if it isn't the easiest thing to do.

374
00:19:59,946 --> 00:20:00,522
Gaby...

375
00:20:02,586 --> 00:20:04,812
Are you and Carlos
getting back together?

376
00:20:05,047 --> 00:20:05,731
Why?

377
00:20:10,868 --> 00:20:12,992
Uh... would you excuse me?

378
00:20:16,866 --> 00:20:19,540
What are you doing? I told you
I was having friends over!

379
00:20:19,598 --> 00:20:22,172
I'm thirsty!
And this is my kitchen, too.

380
00:20:22,498 --> 00:20:23,512
Hey, ladies!

381
00:20:24,986 --> 00:20:26,981
Oh, for God sakes,
put some pants on!

382
00:20:26,986 --> 00:20:30,910
Well, I wanted to, but somebody threw my
laundry out of the dryer while it was still wet. 

383
00:20:30,997 --> 00:20:32,692
Don't act like you
didn't deserve that.

384
00:20:33,538 --> 00:20:34,420
What are you talking about?

385
00:20:34,435 --> 00:20:36,233
You peed in my shampoo. Admit it!

386
00:20:36,398 --> 00:20:37,852
-What?!
-Yeah, the cap was loose,

387
00:20:37,908 --> 00:20:39,572
and I know how your
sick mind works.

388
00:20:39,588 --> 00:20:40,122
Oh, really?

389
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:42,680
Well, in that case, you should know that
if I was gonna do something like that,

390
00:20:42,736 --> 00:20:44,270
I wouldn't do it
to your shampoo.

391
00:20:44,405 --> 00:20:47,801
I would do it to your mouthwash,
soup and decaffeinated coffee.

392
00:20:51,475 --> 00:20:52,291
Ladies.

393
00:21:00,556 --> 00:21:03,430
To answer your question... No,
we are not getting back together.

394
00:21:17,335 --> 00:21:18,580
I love this music.

395
00:21:19,685 --> 00:21:20,493
What's it about?

396
00:21:21,258 --> 00:21:23,102
Making love, regret,

397
00:21:23,686 --> 00:21:24,542
cigarettes.

398
00:21:25,045 --> 00:21:25,882
Cigarettes?

399
00:21:25,965 --> 00:21:26,890
That's what I assume.

400
00:21:26,896 --> 00:21:28,540
It's french. They write
what they know.

401
00:21:29,677 --> 00:21:31,453
I'd love to go to France someday.

402
00:21:34,908 --> 00:21:36,171
Would you like
to go next month?

403
00:21:37,246 --> 00:21:38,250
Are you serious?

404
00:21:38,376 --> 00:21:39,790
Yeah, I'm going on business.
Come with me.

405
00:21:39,937 --> 00:21:42,101
Oh, Ian, I just took a week off.

406
00:21:42,106 --> 00:21:44,312
I couldn't possibly justify
taking another.

407
00:21:44,367 --> 00:21:45,771
Oh, you'll manage.

408
00:21:45,866 --> 00:21:49,292
We've already proven ourselves
masters of the flimsy rationalization.

409
00:21:50,258 --> 00:21:51,982
Well... okay.

410
00:21:52,876 --> 00:21:55,202
You gotta promise me we'll
actually leave the hotel room.

411
00:21:55,968 --> 00:21:59,110
It's Paris, dear. You can pretty
much make love anywhere.

412
00:22:01,616 --> 00:22:03,362
I thought you said you didn't
get reception up here.

413
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:05,610
We, the occasional
signal gets through.

414
00:22:05,627 --> 00:22:07,113
Please don't answer.

415
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:09,380
Oh, it's Julie. I have to.

416
00:22:10,215 --> 00:22:11,262
Hello? What's up?

417
00:22:12,328 --> 00:22:12,810
Hey...

418
00:22:13,818 --> 00:22:14,860
Uh, I can't...

419
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:16,993
No, can you say that again?

420
00:22:18,246 --> 00:22:19,863
The signal's really bad.

421
00:22:22,078 --> 00:22:22,710
What?

422
00:22:23,607 --> 00:22:24,503
Oh, my God.

423
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:26,970
-Is something wrong?
-Mike woke up.

424
00:22:27,306 --> 00:22:28,800
Um, Julie, when did he...

425
00:22:29,296 --> 00:22:30,810
Julie? Julie!

426
00:22:31,215 --> 00:22:32,541
Oh, damn it!

427
00:22:33,035 --> 00:22:33,953
Oh, my God.

428
00:22:35,306 --> 00:22:36,673
Oh! Oh, my God!

429
00:22:38,278 --> 00:22:40,330
Uh, I... I have to go.

430
00:22:40,435 --> 00:22:42,213
Um, I gotta
get out of here.

431
00:22:42,265 --> 00:22:43,081
Yes, of course.

432
00:22:45,165 --> 00:22:47,352
Uh, I think that
you're sitting on my bra.

433
00:22:55,397 --> 00:22:56,292
What'd the coach say?

434
00:22:56,307 --> 00:22:58,400
What do you think he said?
Parker's off the team.

435
00:22:58,415 --> 00:23:00,380
That's not fair!
It's not his fault!

436
00:23:00,855 --> 00:23:01,741
It doesn't matter,

437
00:23:01,796 --> 00:23:04,832
because his mother bribed
an 8-year-old pitcher,

438
00:23:04,998 --> 00:23:07,480
who also, by the way,
was kicked off of his team.

439
00:23:07,627 --> 00:23:09,070
Not Nicky, too!

440
00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:11,460
What were you thinking?

441
00:23:11,846 --> 00:23:16,180
I was trying to repair my
son's shattered self-esteem.

442
00:23:16,507 --> 00:23:17,432
With a $50?

443
00:23:19,186 --> 00:23:23,423
Honey, everything would've been
fine if you had just let Parker quit.

444
00:23:23,767 --> 00:23:26,971
Well, excuse me for not
wanting my son to be a quitter.

445
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:31,581
Yeah, 'cause I guess having two
in the family would be a bit much.

446
00:23:32,815 --> 00:23:34,202
Whoa. Where'd that come from?

447
00:23:34,427 --> 00:23:36,041
You say that you support my decision

448
00:23:36,058 --> 00:23:37,582
to leave advertising
and follow my dream,

449
00:23:37,676 --> 00:23:39,710
but it is obvious to
me that you resent it.

450
00:23:40,006 --> 00:23:41,330
That is not true!

451
00:23:41,495 --> 00:23:44,983
Why do you keep dropping all these hints
about the job at Burnham Fox then, huh?

452
00:23:44,987 --> 00:23:49,411
I just figured, since you're taking your time
figuring out what your dream even is,

453
00:23:49,436 --> 00:23:51,422
you might wanna make
a few bucks in the meantime.

454
00:23:51,616 --> 00:23:54,090
I have a dream, too.
It includes keeping this house.

455
00:23:54,146 --> 00:23:54,871
Oh, like I don't...

456
00:23:58,666 --> 00:24:00,270
-Are you fighting?
-No!

457
00:24:01,515 --> 00:24:02,291
No.

458
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:05,973
It was excitement, because
we have just decided

459
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:08,352
you don't have to
play baseball anymore.

460
00:24:08,487 --> 00:24:11,013
-Ah! Isn't that great?
-But I can't stop now.

461
00:24:11,615 --> 00:24:12,021
Huh?

462
00:24:12,126 --> 00:24:13,462
Not when I'm finally getting good.

463
00:24:13,667 --> 00:24:16,142
You were right, mom. I just
needed a little more practice.

464
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:17,872
So come on, come on!
Let's go practice!

465
00:24:18,126 --> 00:24:18,712
See you outside.

466
00:24:22,316 --> 00:24:25,422
So what's on the next page
of your parenting handbook?

467
00:24:28,768 --> 00:24:31,580
-Ian, can you please hurry?
-I am hurrying!

468
00:24:32,506 --> 00:24:34,381
We should've been on
the road ten minutes ago.

469
00:24:34,538 --> 00:24:36,182
It's not like checking out of a hotel.

470
00:24:36,337 --> 00:24:37,351
There's doors to secure.

471
00:24:37,408 --> 00:24:40,190
-I have to turn the gas valve off.
-Can't you do that stuff later?

472
00:24:40,248 --> 00:24:42,283
When? After the place
is overrun by raccoons?

473
00:24:42,286 --> 00:24:44,052
Of course, the joke would be
on them when it blows up.

474
00:24:44,305 --> 00:24:47,032
Mike is awake! He's lying there
and he's wondering where I am.

475
00:24:47,087 --> 00:24:48,492
Yes, I get it.
You're in a hurry.

476
00:24:48,548 --> 00:24:49,920
Just please give me a minute.

477
00:24:51,148 --> 00:24:53,090
I bet you'd move faster
if Jane were awake.

478
00:25:01,188 --> 00:25:05,580
Ah, here's the picture that you took
of me in my bikini at that pool party.

479
00:25:06,007 --> 00:25:07,973
You could've warned me
I was showing a little nip.

480
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:10,972
Oh, Susan Mayer.

481
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:12,492
Remember her?

482
00:25:12,838 --> 00:25:13,652
Yeah.

483
00:25:14,787 --> 00:25:15,692
She's pretty.

484
00:25:16,857 --> 00:25:18,993
Yeah, she is, sorta,
in this picture.

485
00:25:19,048 --> 00:25:20,222
Is there a date
on this thing?

486
00:25:20,646 --> 00:25:23,113
The nurses said that
she visited me a lot.

487
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:24,690
We were close, huh?

488
00:25:25,126 --> 00:25:26,831
You have just
come out of a coma.

489
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:30,482
Can we not talk about Susan
till you start to regain your strength?

490
00:25:31,217 --> 00:25:31,870
Why?

491
00:25:33,497 --> 00:25:34,420
Oh, God.

492
00:25:35,387 --> 00:25:37,290
I hate to be the one
telling you this...

493
00:25:37,848 --> 00:25:39,613
Well, if you don't want to...

494
00:25:39,646 --> 00:25:41,450
That tramp
treated you like dirt.

495
00:25:41,757 --> 00:25:44,051
She strung you along.
She slept with other guys.

496
00:25:44,486 --> 00:25:46,003
You broke up with her twice.

497
00:25:46,536 --> 00:25:49,143
Well, why did she keep visiting
me when I was out of it?

498
00:25:50,136 --> 00:25:51,970
Well, she's a bit of a stalker.

499
00:25:52,406 --> 00:25:55,992
I was worried that she was gonna come in here
and disconnect one of the tubes or something.

500
00:25:56,726 --> 00:25:57,673
But don't worry.

501
00:25:58,235 --> 00:26:00,241
She's glommed on
to some new guy,

502
00:26:00,297 --> 00:26:03,453
and she's up in the mountains
at his place with him right now.

503
00:26:04,316 --> 00:26:04,983
Wow.

504
00:26:05,635 --> 00:26:08,180
She told the nurses
that she really loved me.

505
00:26:10,765 --> 00:26:14,073
That's the one thing about
Susan that you must never forget,

506
00:26:15,487 --> 00:26:16,561
she is a liar.

507
00:26:28,526 --> 00:26:29,742
You waiting to see
Mike Delfino?

508
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:33,543
Uh, yes. I'm a...
I'm a neighbor.

509
00:26:33,818 --> 00:26:36,202
But, uh, he already has a
vitor, so I'll come back later.

510
00:26:36,307 --> 00:26:38,272
Well, don't be surprised
if he doesn't recognize you.

511
00:26:38,325 --> 00:26:41,032
He's suffered
significant memory loss.

512
00:26:42,495 --> 00:26:43,343
Really?

513
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:46,810
Oh, that's too bad.

514
00:26:48,796 --> 00:26:49,843
You sure you don't want to go in?

515
00:26:50,238 --> 00:26:51,982
Ms. Britt's here all the time.
She won't mind.

516
00:26:52,035 --> 00:26:54,512
No. I've waited this long.
I can wait a bit longer.

517
00:27:13,368 --> 00:27:14,033
Gaby!

518
00:27:22,887 --> 00:27:25,471
Hey, Carlos. What's up?
My key won't work.

519
00:27:27,945 --> 00:27:30,402
That's probably because
I had the locks changed.

520
00:27:31,996 --> 00:27:33,620
-Gaby!
-Can't be too safe.

521
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:36,540
You never know when someone might
move in on you when you're not looking.

522
00:27:47,796 --> 00:27:48,980
Hello, 911?

523
00:27:49,445 --> 00:27:51,422
There's an intruder
breaking into my home.

524
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:55,973
Can you tell them
to come armed?

525
00:27:56,027 --> 00:27:57,303
I think he's mexican.

526
00:27:59,407 --> 00:28:01,183
I'm telling you,
I'm her husband.

527
00:28:01,195 --> 00:28:03,361
I bought her this house.
My name is on the deed.

528
00:28:03,658 --> 00:28:05,841
Ma'am, if you're married,
it's a matter of public record.

529
00:28:05,897 --> 00:28:06,951
I can find out very quickly.

530
00:28:11,586 --> 00:28:14,750
All right, but we're going
through a very messy divorce,

531
00:28:14,806 --> 00:28:16,102
and he moved back in on me.

532
00:28:16,377 --> 00:28:18,392
And everyone knows
the wife keeps the house,

533
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:20,192
and the husband gets
the crappy apartment.

534
00:28:20,248 --> 00:28:21,403
It's the american way.

535
00:28:21,976 --> 00:28:25,033
Call my lawyer. This is all
totally legal, and she knows it.

536
00:28:25,088 --> 00:28:26,300
She's just trying
to get back at me.

537
00:28:29,036 --> 00:28:29,822
I hear that.

538
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:34,022
You wouldn't believe the stuff
my wife pulled when we split.

539
00:28:36,687 --> 00:28:37,470
Whoa!

540
00:28:37,475 --> 00:28:39,391
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
you can't take sides!

541
00:28:39,445 --> 00:28:41,543
Police officers aren't
allowed to take sides.

542
00:28:41,797 --> 00:28:43,193
I pay your salary.

543
00:28:44,468 --> 00:28:47,553
Ted, did you see that?
This lady just assaulted me.

544
00:28:47,636 --> 00:28:50,321
Oh. It was a swat.

545
00:28:50,375 --> 00:28:51,473
Ted, does this hurt?

546
00:28:56,187 --> 00:28:57,861
Get your hands off me!

547
00:28:58,826 --> 00:29:00,501
Police brutality!

548
00:29:09,876 --> 00:29:11,711
This is all my fault.

549
00:29:11,766 --> 00:29:13,150
Why punish Parker?

550
00:29:13,658 --> 00:29:15,880
Sorry, Mrs. Scavo.
Rules are rules.

551
00:29:16,167 --> 00:29:17,531
I can't put him back on the team.

552
00:29:17,576 --> 00:29:19,032
Just one more game.

553
00:29:19,035 --> 00:29:21,151
He'll suck,
the other kids will taunt him,

554
00:29:21,167 --> 00:29:23,763
and he'll wanna quit again.
See, everybody wins.

555
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,211
I wish I could help, but...

556
00:29:25,626 --> 00:29:28,222
Please? You can't
bend the rules just once?

557
00:29:30,118 --> 00:29:32,052
Did you know the team could
use some new batting helmets?

558
00:29:34,498 --> 00:29:35,651
Are you asking for a bribe?

559
00:29:36,615 --> 00:29:37,911
You pretending
you're above that?

560
00:29:39,476 --> 00:29:40,562
I'll get my checkbook.

561
00:29:43,317 --> 00:29:44,423
Hello, Vera.

562
00:29:45,068 --> 00:29:48,163
I made you some of those, uh, shortbread
biscuits that you like so much.

563
00:29:48,227 --> 00:29:49,243
How sweet!

564
00:29:50,035 --> 00:29:52,632
Can you stay for some tea?
It's been so long.

565
00:29:52,788 --> 00:29:54,222
We have some
catching up to do.

566
00:29:54,716 --> 00:29:56,352
Yes. Yes, we do.

567
00:30:05,168 --> 00:30:07,221
I know how painful
this must be for you.

568
00:30:07,225 --> 00:30:10,841
It isn't easy for me either,
considering Andrew's role in it.

569
00:30:12,545 --> 00:30:14,113
And why have you told me this?

570
00:30:14,807 --> 00:30:16,173
Because I thought
you'd want to know.

571
00:30:18,136 --> 00:30:18,831
Why?

572
00:30:19,897 --> 00:30:21,342
So you could do something.

573
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:27,571
Do you think I'm an idiot?

574
00:30:28,375 --> 00:30:32,093
That I know nothing about the
man I've lived with for 27 years?

575
00:30:35,328 --> 00:30:38,302
I've always assumed
Howard had some... outlet,

576
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:40,300
a friend tucked
away somewhere.

577
00:30:40,326 --> 00:30:41,210
I didn't know.

578
00:30:42,206 --> 00:30:43,593
I didn't care to know.

579
00:30:44,958 --> 00:30:47,522
But thank you
for painting so vivid,

580
00:30:47,927 --> 00:30:51,201
so indelible a picture
of my husband's activities.

581
00:30:51,647 --> 00:30:52,501
I'm sorry.

582
00:30:52,577 --> 00:30:54,682
I just felt that
if it were me, I...

583
00:30:54,685 --> 00:30:56,842
-You'd want to know.
-Yes, absolutely.

584
00:30:57,386 --> 00:30:58,810
Then I owe you an apology,

585
00:31:00,078 --> 00:31:02,851
because I've been sitting on a
little secret about your family.

586
00:31:04,126 --> 00:31:04,622
Oh?

587
00:31:04,676 --> 00:31:06,193
Actually, it's not much of a secret.

588
00:31:06,767 --> 00:31:09,753
My daughter tells me it's common
knowledge among the cheerleaders.

589
00:31:09,877 --> 00:31:10,510
What is?

590
00:31:12,088 --> 00:31:14,503
The fact that Danielle is
sleeping with her history teacher.

591
00:31:18,466 --> 00:31:19,932
But where are my manners?

592
00:31:21,126 --> 00:31:22,941
I should have brought
some biscuits with that.

593
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:32,780
Well, aren't we just
the parents of the year?

594
00:31:33,035 --> 00:31:35,013
Sitting in the stands,
waiting for our son to fail,

595
00:31:35,037 --> 00:31:37,263
so we can weasel out
of a bribery scandal.

596
00:31:37,517 --> 00:31:40,333
Two bribery scandals.
Gotta count the batting helmets.

597
00:31:44,028 --> 00:31:44,853
Strike one!

598
00:31:46,148 --> 00:31:48,493
You know, for what it's worth,
I don't think you're a quitter.

599
00:31:48,748 --> 00:31:49,401
Good.

600
00:31:51,196 --> 00:31:52,250
And you don't resent me?

601
00:31:52,308 --> 00:31:52,991
No.

602
00:31:53,878 --> 00:31:54,581
Ball one!

603
00:31:54,777 --> 00:31:56,372
Okay, well, maybe a little.

604
00:31:56,936 --> 00:31:57,712
Why?

605
00:31:57,986 --> 00:32:01,550
You get to chase your dream while I get
to spend the rest of my life in advertising.

606
00:32:02,245 --> 00:32:03,063
Strike two!

607
00:32:03,318 --> 00:32:07,010
Maybe I'd like to write a book or,
you know, start my own magazine.

608
00:32:07,017 --> 00:32:08,492
And then I think, "No, I can't.

609
00:32:08,685 --> 00:32:11,581
I have a family to support,"
and I am okay with that...

610
00:32:11,835 --> 00:32:12,571
Ball two!

611
00:32:12,645 --> 00:32:13,262
Most of the time.

612
00:32:14,776 --> 00:32:15,491
You know what?

613
00:32:16,437 --> 00:32:18,331
I'm gonna look into that
job at Burnham Fox.

614
00:32:18,447 --> 00:32:19,742
Don't you dare!

615
00:32:20,088 --> 00:32:21,541
You are gonna
chase your dream,

616
00:32:21,547 --> 00:32:24,631
and I am gonna support
you 99% of the time.

617
00:32:26,428 --> 00:32:27,852
It's all I could
really ask for.

618
00:32:37,045 --> 00:32:38,722
How the hell
did he do that?!

619
00:32:39,015 --> 00:32:40,600
Yeah! Come on, come on!

620
00:32:42,016 --> 00:32:43,652
Crap, they're cheering for him.

621
00:32:46,037 --> 00:32:48,791
Oh, he's never gonna quit now!

622
00:32:49,137 --> 00:32:50,273
What are we gonna say to him?

623
00:33:03,998 --> 00:33:05,000
I don't know, buddy.

624
00:33:05,017 --> 00:33:06,810
Looks like a pretty bad sprain.

625
00:33:07,906 --> 00:33:10,540
Probably gonna be out
the rest of the season.

626
00:33:12,248 --> 00:33:13,022
Damn.

627
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:17,162
Hey, but you know what?
That was one heck of a hit.

628
00:33:18,487 --> 00:33:19,871
Sure was.

629
00:33:40,605 --> 00:33:42,793
I posted your bail.
We can go.

630
00:33:48,476 --> 00:33:50,231
-Gaby...
-Don't talk to me.

631
00:33:50,287 --> 00:33:51,821
Oh, lighten up.

632
00:33:51,858 --> 00:33:53,902
You were in there
for maybe an hour.

633
00:33:53,916 --> 00:33:56,022
The whole thing is funny,
and you know it.

634
00:33:58,888 --> 00:34:00,292
Come on, Gaby!

635
00:34:00,297 --> 00:34:02,132
We've been going at each
other for months now.

636
00:34:02,137 --> 00:34:03,083
Can we just stop?

637
00:34:04,287 --> 00:34:06,833
You know as well as I do we're
gonna end up back together.

638
00:34:06,916 --> 00:34:08,710
Wow, you are crazy.

639
00:34:08,725 --> 00:34:11,292
No, what's crazy is throwing
away the past three years.

640
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:15,153
Why can't we just say what
we really feel for a change?

641
00:34:19,048 --> 00:34:22,531
Fine, I'll get the ball rolling.
I still love you.

642
00:34:22,587 --> 00:34:24,193
That's too bad,
because I don't love you.

643
00:34:24,587 --> 00:34:25,291
Yeah, right.

644
00:34:26,717 --> 00:34:27,501
I don't...

645
00:34:29,115 --> 00:34:30,891
And I haven't
for a very long time.

646
00:34:32,846 --> 00:34:35,181
That's a lie. You're just
saying that to hurt me.

647
00:34:35,377 --> 00:34:38,221
No, if I wanted hurt you, I would
tell you about last weekend...

648
00:34:39,197 --> 00:34:40,931
When I slept with
John Rowland.

649
00:34:50,247 --> 00:34:52,313
Carlos, what are you doing?

650
00:34:53,327 --> 00:34:54,073
Carlos!

651
00:34:55,808 --> 00:34:57,961
What are you doing?! Carlos!

652
00:34:57,967 --> 00:35:00,921
You can't leave me out here
in the middle of nowhere!

653
00:35:04,186 --> 00:35:04,952
Carlos!

654
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:33,063
Danielle! Danielle, he is your history
teacher, and he is 35-years-old!

655
00:35:33,118 --> 00:35:36,141
-Robert says age is just a number.
-Don't you dare leave this house!

656
00:35:36,147 --> 00:35:38,662
You can't break us up!
I love him, d he loves me!

657
00:35:50,428 --> 00:35:51,382
Come on, mom.

658
00:35:52,486 --> 00:35:56,653
I am so tired of feeling like
the worst mother who ever lived.

659
00:35:57,856 --> 00:35:58,690
You're not.

660
00:35:59,565 --> 00:36:00,412
There's grandma.

661
00:36:05,045 --> 00:36:07,782
I've tried so hard to
set a good example.

662
00:36:08,807 --> 00:36:11,311
I've done the best I could to
teach you kids right from wrong.

663
00:36:11,315 --> 00:36:12,781
Why isn't it taking?

664
00:36:14,185 --> 00:36:15,061
It took.

665
00:36:15,217 --> 00:36:19,023
I mean, we know the difference between
right and wrong. We just chose wrong.

666
00:36:20,676 --> 00:36:21,410
Why?

667
00:36:22,438 --> 00:36:25,022
Sometimes when you push a kid
really hard to go one way,

668
00:36:25,508 --> 00:36:27,590
the other way starts to
look more entertaining.

669
00:36:28,765 --> 00:36:29,862
You're awful.

670
00:36:29,917 --> 00:36:31,381
Yeah, I know.

671
00:36:31,808 --> 00:36:32,962
I blame shoddy parenting.

672
00:36:38,846 --> 00:36:40,112
You know, we never...

673
00:36:41,007 --> 00:36:44,321
discussed what it s like for
you while you were... away.

674
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:46,500
I just want you to know,
if you ever wanna...

675
00:36:47,465 --> 00:36:50,323
talk about it, there's
nothing you can't tell me.

676
00:36:54,335 --> 00:36:54,923
Thanks.

677
00:36:58,127 --> 00:36:59,042
Not right now.

678
00:36:59,756 --> 00:37:00,243
Okay?

679
00:37:09,397 --> 00:37:10,803
I'll pick up my bags later.

680
00:37:13,017 --> 00:37:14,440
It's not my fault
you weren't there.

681
00:37:14,956 --> 00:37:16,841
-What?
-It's not.

682
00:37:17,636 --> 00:37:18,920
I know what you're feeling, but...

683
00:37:18,938 --> 00:37:20,681
How could you possibly
know what I was feeling?

684
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:23,022
For six months,
I have prayed every day

685
00:37:23,075 --> 00:37:25,233
for that man to wake up,
and you made me give up on him.

686
00:37:25,236 --> 00:37:26,301
I did not make you.

687
00:37:26,396 --> 00:37:28,133
Okay, not on purpose, but you did.

688
00:37:28,467 --> 00:37:30,151
You were sweet and
charming and english.

689
00:37:30,215 --> 00:37:32,101
And that's why when my
prayers were answered,

690
00:37:32,105 --> 00:37:34,441
I was a hundred miles away,
naked in someone else's arms.

691
00:37:34,668 --> 00:37:36,232
This should never
have happened.

692
00:37:36,656 --> 00:37:38,320
You can say
what you want about this,

693
00:37:38,338 --> 00:37:40,750
say that you feel guilty,
say that it was bad timing,

694
00:37:40,815 --> 00:37:43,490
vut don't you say that this
should never have happened!

695
00:37:47,526 --> 00:37:48,161
Because you're the...

696
00:37:48,218 --> 00:37:50,162
You're the best thing that's
happened to me in years.

697
00:37:54,608 --> 00:37:56,291
Ian, I'm sorry.

698
00:37:58,565 --> 00:37:59,762
I know how you feel.

699
00:38:01,605 --> 00:38:02,533
It's Mike.

700
00:38:03,405 --> 00:38:04,533
It's my Mike.

701
00:38:10,125 --> 00:38:11,750
Well, then you should go.

702
00:38:18,466 --> 00:38:19,320
Thank you.

703
00:38:35,175 --> 00:38:36,192
Oh, my God.

704
00:38:37,468 --> 00:38:39,032
You are awake.

705
00:38:39,726 --> 00:38:40,781
Hi, Susan.

706
00:38:41,077 --> 00:38:42,791
Oh, God!

707
00:38:42,998 --> 00:38:45,721
It's so wonderful to
hear your voice again.

708
00:38:46,668 --> 00:38:48,130
They say you've been here lot.

709
00:38:48,338 --> 00:38:51,650
Yes! Yes, I have.
Almost every day.

710
00:38:52,438 --> 00:38:55,913
I can't tell you how much I'm kicking myself
for not being here when you woke up.

711
00:38:56,808 --> 00:38:57,710
Where were you?

712
00:39:00,808 --> 00:39:02,361
I was in the country.

713
00:39:04,238 --> 00:39:05,371
But I'm back now.

714
00:39:07,337 --> 00:39:08,033
Okay.

715
00:39:11,717 --> 00:39:12,692
Is something wrong? You...

716
00:39:13,456 --> 00:39:15,061
You don't seem
happy to see me.

717
00:39:18,917 --> 00:39:21,413
To be honest,
I don't remember you.

718
00:39:23,705 --> 00:39:24,383
What?

719
00:39:25,127 --> 00:39:28,073
I remember moving to Fairview
and meeting people,

720
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:30,252
but after that, nothing.

721
00:39:30,737 --> 00:39:33,312
The doctors say
it's the head trauma.

722
00:39:37,477 --> 00:39:39,360
But you're gonna all right.

723
00:39:40,075 --> 00:39:41,752
And I'm gonna
help you remember.

724
00:39:42,407 --> 00:39:44,822
And if you don't mind,
I'm kind of tired now.

725
00:39:47,587 --> 00:39:48,363
Okay.

726
00:39:52,937 --> 00:39:55,280
Right, you, um,
you sleep.

727
00:39:56,308 --> 00:39:57,472
I'll come back tomorrow.

728
00:39:59,347 --> 00:40:00,850
I'd rather you didn't.

729
00:40:05,337 --> 00:40:07,092
Well, I've got therapy.

730
00:40:08,425 --> 00:40:09,773
Maybe next week.

731
00:40:16,905 --> 00:40:17,631
Okay.

732
00:40:57,368 --> 00:41:00,520
We all have our reasons
for rewriting history.

733
00:41:02,938 --> 00:41:06,141
Sometimes we need to
provide ourselves alibis...

734
00:41:06,167 --> 00:41:07,902
Drama camp was awesome.

735
00:41:08,267 --> 00:41:10,421
Uh, we're talking
zero supervision.

736
00:41:11,568 --> 00:41:14,923
Sometimes we wanna hurt
someone who has hurt us...

737
00:41:14,966 --> 00:41:17,840
So you can tell Carlos that
he can have the photo albums.

738
00:41:18,406 --> 00:41:20,872
She says that they hold
no sentimental value for her.

739
00:41:22,805 --> 00:41:27,442
And then there are times we just wanna
spare ourselves embarrassment...

740
00:41:27,496 --> 00:41:29,193
I don't know how
these rumors get started.

741
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,581
No, Parker only quit the team
'cause he hurt his ankle.

742
00:41:35,307 --> 00:41:36,093
Of course,

743
00:41:36,135 --> 00:41:41,201
there are some who feel that to rewrite
history Is just another way to lie...

744
00:41:41,637 --> 00:41:44,102
And poor Howard has to
work late again tonight.

745
00:41:45,378 --> 00:41:47,182
Of course,
he does it all f the family.

746
00:41:50,606 --> 00:41:53,091
But what is history anyway...

747
00:41:53,557 --> 00:41:56,622
You say I dated Susan
for a long time.

748
00:41:57,958 --> 00:41:59,761
Do you think I was in love with her?

749
00:42:00,448 --> 00:42:03,462
But a set of lies
agreed upon?

750
00:42:05,338 --> 00:42:06,190
I don't.

751
00:42:06,965 --> 00:42:08,030
I really...

752
00:42:09,167 --> 00:42:10,113
really don't.
