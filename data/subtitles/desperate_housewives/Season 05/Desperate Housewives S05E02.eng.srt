1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,360
Previously on...

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,350
Lives change in five years.

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:08,160
Some families grow,
while others grow apart.

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,010
So I thought I'd bring him back
sunday around 6:00 or so. Fine.

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,660
And we find ways... it's
not really a good time.

6
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,510
To ease the pain.

7
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,050
Yes, in five years...

8
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,670
Edie, is that really
you? I have a husband now.

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,600
Many things change.

10
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,370
You're required to
check in once a month.

11
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,150
It was a condition of your release.

12
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:32,780
All in all,

13
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,980
Susan mayer's boyfriend knew
he had a lot goingor him.

14
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,240
He was romantic...

15
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,810
Had a nice smile...

16
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,550
And was consistently thoughtful.

17
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:54,510
Yes, jackson braddock had
many wonderful attributes.

18
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,680
Sadly...

19
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,760
A sense of timing wasn't one of them.

20
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,540
Hello.

21
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,020
Can I help you?

22
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,170
I guess you could
tell susan I'm here.

23
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:10,170
Okay. Uh... who are you?

24
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:13,120
Oh, I'm mike... the ex-Husband.

25
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:15,790
I, uh, I take it you're...

26
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,140
Jackson.

27
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,710
I'm, uh...

28
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,380
Susan's, uh...

29
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:21,460
Friend?

30
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,030
Friend. That's right.

31
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,640
Wow. Could this be any more awkward?

32
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:28,700
Well, your robe's open... so yeah.

33
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:32,090
Well, you be the judge.

34
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,480
I don't know, man.
It--It's pretty good.

35
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:35,320
Well, I got the feeling that...

36
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,200
Hey, your ex-Husband is...

37
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,780
Mike! Uh, what's going on?

38
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:56,420
I was just returning
m.J.'S video game.

39
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,660
He left it at my house.

40
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:01,290
Oh. Thanks. So I
guess you met jackson.

41
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,010
Yeah. Nice legs.

42
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,900
Oh, clearly this is not

43
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,840
How I would've wanted
the two of you to meet.

44
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:10,690
He's--He's
really a nice guy.

45
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,930
Yeah, well, just to
make sure, I'm gonna need

46
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,550
To hang with him a
little bit, check him out.

47
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,460
Oh, I don't know
that that's necessary.

48
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,400
If he's sleeping in the
same house as my son,

49
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,230
I think it is.

50
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,600
Oh, well, first off, um, m.J.
Was at a sleepover last night.

51
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,780
And, in fact, jackson
and he haven't even met,

52
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,350
So, uh, there's really no
need for you to be hanging...

53
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,790
Or checking.

54
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,800
Oh, just... tell jackson I'll
pick him up here tomorrow night.

55
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,210
Hey, hold on.

56
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,820
You don't get to just decide
these things by yourself.

57
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,320
You remember how nice I was
about our custody agreement?

58
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:48,010
I can haul you back to court tomorrow

59
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,460
If I'm not 100% satisfied
with who you expose my son to.

60
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,770
Got it?

61
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,090
Uh, I'm sorry.

62
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:06,090
It's so not how I wanted to
meet your ex for the first time.

63
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,030
Well, when you meet
him for the second time,

64
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,070
You can tell him that.

65
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,340
He's picking you up here
tomorrow night. What?

66
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,300
I'll explain over breakfast.

67
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,610
Did you get the paper?

68
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,230
And that is w jackson
braddock realized

69
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,900
He needed better timing...

70
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:29,830
Who are you?

71
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,520
And a longer robe.

72
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:48,550
If there is one thing everyone in
suburbia can appreciate... oh, hey!

73
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,200
It's a good neighbor.

74
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:52,210
You know, the kind that helps

75
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,840
With the last bag of groceries...

76
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,180
Or brings over misplaced mail...

77
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,950
Or offers to mow your lawn.

78
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,700
Yes, everyone appreciates
a good neighbor.

79
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,600
You are so sweet to do this.

80
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,240
I just know how tricky
these bulbs can be.

81
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,120
And no one knew this
bette than dave williams,

82
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,410
Who was determined to be

83
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:21,280
The best neighbor steria
lane had ever seen...

84
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,340
Assuming, of course,

85
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:27,650
His wife didn't get in the way.

86
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,900
What's going on?

87
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,160
Packing our bags.

88
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,960
Karen mccluskey insulted me again,

89
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,780
And I can't put up with it anymore.

90
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,520
All right, what did she
say to you this time?

91
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:41,700
Nothing. It doesn't matter. We are
moving. Adults don't pack up and move

92
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,550
Because of some
good-Natured teasing.

93
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,670
She said that my breasts were
a triumph oferman engineering.

94
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,230
You call that good-Natured?

95
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,360
Come on. She's a cranky old lady.

96
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:53,530
It's not just her. It's all of them.

97
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:57,320
I mean, it's been five
years. I have changed.

98
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,430
But the people on
this street don't care.

99
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,230
To them, I will always be a joke.

100
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,740
I'm sorry you had a bad day.

101
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,770
Please don't use your
motivational voice.

102
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,690
I really hate that.

103
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,530
You're upset and you're tired.

104
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,680
Why don't you take a nice hot shower,

105
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,540
And I'll makus some lunch?

106
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,440
Does that sound good?

107
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,410
I just never understood it.

108
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:32,800
We--We could've gone and lived
in any city in this country.

109
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:37,080
Why did you insist on living here?

110
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,910
'Cause we can be happy here.

111
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:41,500
You just need to give it some time.

112
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,150
And I promise,

113
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,640
I'll personally see to it

114
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,170
That people start treating
you with a little more respect.

115
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,480
You didn't answer my question.

116
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,040
Didn't I?

117
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,620
Carlos, we got invited to
michelle downing's party!

118
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:15,620
I'm gonna have to buy
something nice to--Aah!

119
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:18,610
Gaby, I'm giving a massage.

120
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,170
I can see that.

121
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,730
I can see a
lot of things--

122
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,990
Things that can never be unseen.

123
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,890
Uh, sorry. I guess the
towel must've rode up.

124
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:32,220
Carlos? Kitchen. Now.

125
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,880
I know you don't like
it when I work down here,

126
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:38,020
But he couldn't get up the stairs.

127
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:41,380
He's got a bum hip. He's
also missing a testicle.

128
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:44,070
Carlos, how much more of
this am I supposed to take?

129
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,690
Okay, okay, maybe I could
set up my table in the garage.

130
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,030
No! That's only part of the problem.

131
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,870
Have you checked our
bank balance lately?

132
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:55,360
Gaby, I am not taking
the country club job.

133
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,560
Why not? You'd be
massaging rich people.

134
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:59,080
They tip better and they tend to

135
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,920
Flake less. Yeah, but
I like working here

136
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,920
I get to spend lots of
time with you and the kids.

137
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,090
Carlos, I don't need to
spend lots of time with you.

138
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,310
And frankly, the kids
are on the fence. Gaby!

139
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,230
Bottom line, I miss our
life. I miss shopping.

140
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,900
All I have to look forward to

141
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,240
Is the occasional
invitation to a fancy party.

142
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:18,590
And I can't even afford
a dress to go to it.

143
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,790
Carlos, please, I am begging you.
Fine. I'll-- I will take the job.

144
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,130
Thank you.

145
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:28,900
Sorry.

146
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,330
Ah, no.

147
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,990
Unh-Unh. Come on.

148
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,260
I really don't think mike's
gonna care what shirt I wear.

149
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,590
Well, I do.

150
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,370
We need a shirt that says,
"I'm a responsible citizen,"

151
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:50,980
Not "my favorite clothing
store also sells bongs."

152
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,950
Are you dissing my sense of style?

153
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,650
Absolutely.

154
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,630
Put this on.

155
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,210
Now...

156
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,960
Let's talk about acceptable
topics of conversation.

157
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,680
You like sports, right?

158
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,990
Yeah. I'm a huge socr
fan. No, you're not.

159
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,200
You like football--
American football.

160
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,920
Specifically the colts. Okay.

161
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,640
And here are some other
things you can talk about--

162
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:13,080
Cars, barbue, fishing.

163
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:16,040
How about fire? Mike like talk fire?

164
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,360
Jackson, please take this seriously.

165
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:21,580
I am. I'm just--I'm not gonna
pretend to be somebody I'm not.

166
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,930
If he doesn't like
me, wh's he gonna do?

167
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,190
He could take me to court,

168
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,610
And the judge can make me
choose between you and my son.

169
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:30,090
And I'm sorry. You will lose.

170
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,000
Peyton manning

171
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,990
Is the greatest
quarterback who ever lived.

172
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:36,730
Thank you.

173
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,350
Now go shave. You look like a hobo.

174
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,090
Got a sec?

175
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,310
Not really.

176
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:59,210
So I assume you know about
what happened to jimmy conrado.

177
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,170
I guess.

178
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,400
Your friend gets busted
for dealing drugs at school,

179
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,490
And all you have to
say is, "I guess"?

180
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,010
He's not my friend.
- What are you talking about?

181
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,560
You were on the same
little league team.

182
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:13,940
Yeah, like a million
years ago. Anything else?

183
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,170
No.

184
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,090
Not really.

185
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,710
Parker.

186
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,820
Can I ask you something,
just between us?

187
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:32,390
Does porter hang out
with jimmy conrado?

188
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,350
I don't know. I could check out his

189
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,490
Friends list on
silverfizz. His what on what

190
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,960
It's like myspace.
You have a web page.

191
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,930
It shows your hobbies,
your favorite music,

192
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:44,420
And you can talk to people.

193
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:47,690
Really? Can anyone talk to him?

194
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,030
Yeah. He just has to invite you.

195
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:52,820
And, uh...

196
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,780
How would somebody make that happen?

197
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,560
Now it's just a mock-Up,

198
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,460
But this is what the book
is going to look like.

199
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,570
Mom, that's fantastic.

200
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,200
Good call on the font.

201
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,690
Thank you, dear.

202
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,600
Orson, what do you think?

203
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,370
Well, I think it's strange

204
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,740
To see my wife billed
as "mrs. Van de kamp."

205
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,650
Well, you knew what
the book was gonna be

206
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,840
Called. Yes, but it's
differen actually seeing it

207
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:21,440
I mean, is it too late
to go with "mrs. Hodge"?

208
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,960
My company, which I formed
when we were separated,

209
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,880
Is called mrs. Van
de kamp's catering.

210
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:28,440
It's how I'm known. Oh, in fairview.

211
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,710
But this book will be national.

212
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:33,520
I mean, it's your chance
to rebrand yourself.

213
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:35,820
Is there something
wrong with "hodge"?

214
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,710
I think I just heard the
milk go bad. I should check.

215
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,410
Orson, I adore you,

216
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:46,510
But your name... our
name-- It has no music.

217
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,750
"Van de kamp" trips off the tongue.

218
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,880
"Hodge" sounds like the
noise a plunger makes.

219
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,250
That's preposterous.

220
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,340
Listen...

221
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,610
Van de kamp.

222
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,980
Hodge.

223
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,340
Also, she's got a radio
interview wednesday,

224
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,360
And they're already promoting
her as mrs. Van de kamp.

225
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,550
See? The ship has already sailed.

226
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,260
Oh, don't be hurt. It's
my professional name.

227
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:09,250
In this house, I will
always be mrs. Hodge.

228
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:12,500
Now... would it help if mrs. Hodge

229
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:15,160
Cooked you your favorite
pot roast tonight?

230
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,890
Yes, I guess it would help.

231
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,700
Uh, meeting with your publicist?

232
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:25,080
Oh, right. Um,
tomorrow for sure, then.

233
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,820
Van de kamp. Hmm.

234
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,350
Hodge.

235
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,630
Here you go. Oh, thank you.

236
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,940
Toby, get off my
chair. You know better.

237
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,310
So what's on your mind?

238
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,470
It's Edie.

239
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,250
You said something to her yesterday

240
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,990
That hurt her feelings.

241
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,010
That thing about her breasts?
Come on. That was a joke.

242
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,320
Perhaps, but it upset her so much

243
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:02,240
That she suggested we
leave wisteria lane.

244
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,810
I can't have that, mrs. M.

245
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,880
Hey, this is what Edie and
I do. We tease each other.

246
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:09,990
I say she's easier to get
into than community college.

247
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,390
She says my face looks like a knee.

248
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:13,730
It's fun.

249
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:17,160
Still... I would consider
it a personal favor

250
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,560
If you'd apologize to her.

251
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:21,950
You know, make her
feel accepted and loved.

252
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,680
No.

253
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:27,030
No?

254
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,770
If Edie wants to change the
way we talk to each other,

255
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,720
She's gotta ask me personally.

256
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:33,750
And I think you've got a lot of gall

257
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,790
Making me feel like
I did something wrong

258
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,540
When you don't even know me.

259
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,340
Oh... I know you,

260
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,150
Better than you think.

261
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,390
Oh, really?

262
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,720
For starters,

263
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,990
You talk to your cat
like it's a person.

264
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:52,340
When I knocked on your door,
you immediately invited me in.

265
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,790
Doesn't take a genius to
see that you're lonely.

266
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,330
I'm thinking you had people
in your life at one time...

267
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,920
People who cared about you.

268
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,070
But somethg happened to them.

269
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:10,250
Some probably died. The rest, well...

270
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,600
They just don't come
around much anymore.

271
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,810
Why do you think that is?

272
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,760
I know you, mrs. Mccluskey.

273
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,290
And it seems to me

274
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,110
That a woman le you
would like to keep

275
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,170
The few friends that she has left.

276
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,660
I think you'd better go.

277
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,430
Thanks for tonight.

278
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,460
And, uh, before I
forget, the colts suck.

279
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:00,350
Oh, here's what sucks--
Watching a zero-Zero game

280
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,670
With no cheerleaders, soccer boy.

281
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,300
You guys were insulting each other.

282
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:11,200
That's good, right?
Yeah, we had a blast

283
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:12,260
Really? Yeah.

284
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:14,590
In fact, we're getting together
wednesday night at o'brien's,

285
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,750
Which he claims has the best
bacon potato skins in town.

286
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,670
Potato skins at o'brien's?
You've made his inner circle!

287
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,970
This is fantastic!
Thank you. Mmm. Mmm.

288
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:26,100
Ah, you can think of

289
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:28,350
A more creative way
to thank me than that.

290
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:39,280
Nice.

291
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:40,030
Yeah?

292
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,910
Yeah. Mmm.

293
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45,270
You've never done that before.

294
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,080
Wait.

295
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:51,500
You've never done that before.
Why are you doing that now?

296
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:54,110
I don't know. Don't you like it?

297
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,590
Yeah. But how did you
know I would like it?

298
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,850
Oh, my god.

299
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,090
What?

300
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,920
Mike told you about the
ear thing, didn't he?

301
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,020
No.

302
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:08,990
So you just happened

303
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,570
To stumble across my secret turn-On

304
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,810
The same night that you
and mike became b.F.F.S?

305
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,180
But aren't we losing sight
of the fact that you like it?

306
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:18,900
This is... I mean, I'm just...

307
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:20,890
I have been violated.

308
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,090
Oh, honey,
come on--

309
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,420
Don't touch me! Or my ears!
My ears are dead to you.

310
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:28,230
It just slipped out. We were
talking about how girls--

311
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,620
They--They all like
different things, right?

312
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,320
And I-I was talking about
this girl in high school,

313
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,990
How she liked to do
it with her shoes on,

314
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,830
And--And mike talked about the
lobe nibble. He has a name for it?

315
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,520
Okay.

316
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:42,260
That's it. You and mike
are not hanging out anymore.

317
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,330
And this little

318
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:47,860
Wednesday "potato skins
and susan sex tips night"?

319
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,000
I forbid it.

320
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:56,050
Did mike mention he likes
having his toes sucked?

321
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,800
Oops! That just slipped out. Hmm.

322
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:06,500
Gaby...

323
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:08,810
Bree! What's up?

324
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:13,440
Well, um, michelle downing
asked me to speak to you.

325
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:14,680
I don't know if you heard,

326
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:15,960
But I'm catering her
birthday party-- I

327
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:19,350
Heard. I can't wait.
Ooh, I was gonna ask you

328
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,630
Should I wear the navy blue chanel

329
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,110
Or the red sleeveless
dress? You can't come.

330
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:25,630
Sorry.

331
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,570
I just had to rip the band-Aid off.

332
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:31,010
What? She's disinviting me?

333
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,090
It's not personal.

334
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,150
You know how carlos
just started at the club?

335
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,810
Well, her guests are all members,

336
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,430
And she thinks they
might find it awkward

337
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,810
Socializing with...

338
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,240
Staff.

339
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,010
She called us "staff"?

340
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:46,490
Oh, gaby, it's just one
party. I'll save you some cake.

341
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,370
No! It's not just one party!

342
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,010
It's the kickoff to
the whole social season.

343
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,410
If people see we're
off michelle's list,

344
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,820
Then we'll be off everyone's.

345
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:55,050
And then it's gonna be
the start of our slow slide

346
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:58,490
From gowns and galas to
flip-Flops and keggers!

347
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:05,220
Okay, if carlos working
at the club is the problem,

348
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:07,040
Then tell her he just quit.

349
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,990
Oh, hon, I don't
think that's gonna fly.

350
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,170
He's already rubbed too many members.

351
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:15,790
What's happened to my life?

352
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,010
We used to have help.
Now we are the help!

353
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:27,030
What are you doing?

354
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:29,630
I am just...

355
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,700
Talking to porter on silverfizz.

356
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,630
Who is saraj from
macarthur high school?

357
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,320
Me.

358
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,250
I'm 16 and cute.

359
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,280
I like graphic novels and
tokyo police club. Oh, my god.

360
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:45,230
You--You're pretending
to be somebody else?

361
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,020
Our brooding son has a classmate

362
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,600
Who got arrested for selling drugs.

363
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:52,200
I really think the end
justifies the means here.

364
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:56,090
Okay, we'll address your major
ethical breach in a moment.

365
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:01,010
What did you find out?
Well, the good news is

366
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,690
He really doesn't hang
out with jimmy conrado.

367
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,730
But I am a little
worried about anita47,

368
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:10,480
Who told him cherry fruit
pops are an aphrodisiac.

369
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,850
Okay, great, you know who
he hangs around with now.

370
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,470
You got what you came
for. Time to stop.

371
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,840
You're probably right. It's just...

372
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,180
Did you know porter writes poetry?

373
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,270
Serious? Yeah.

374
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,510
Our porter,

375
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,980
The kid who communicates
with grunts and shrugs,

376
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,410
Writes this...

377
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:35,500
Beautiful, heart-Wrenching poetry.

378
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,950
Maybe one day he'll share it with you

379
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,320
Instead of your fantasy alter ego.

380
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,790
Until then, shut it off.

381
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:46,510
Okay, okay.

382
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:48,370
You're right.

383
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:49,720
You're right.

384
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,310
I luvs me some walt whitman!

385
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,390
Emlly dickinson kicks
walt whitman's ass!!

386
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:20,300
Yeah, if you're into spinster poetry.

387
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:22,960
Oh, really?

388
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:31,670
Is your girlfrend into poetry,too?

389
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:40,110
Don't have one.There's a girl I
lile.But we haven't gotten to that yet.

390
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,010
Aw. That's sweet.

391
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,660
Girls love romance.Send her a
poem.She won't know what hit her.

392
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,390
Still talking to poetry girl?

393
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,590
Bite me.

394
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,980
Dude, she didn't put up her photo.

395
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:01,700
5 bucks says she looks
like she came out of an egg.

396
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,480
Whatever.

397
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,490
Toby?

398
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:12,320
Toby! Where are you?

399
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,760
Toby!

400
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:17,010
Everything all right, mrs. M.?

401
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,550
It's toby. I can't find him.

402
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,390
Oh, no. How did he get out?

403
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,680
The living room window
was open, which is bizarre

404
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,420
Because I don't remember opening it.

405
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:28,550
Can you help me find him?

406
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:33,140
Have you given any more thought
about apologizing to Edie?

407
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,980
She's still pretty down in the dumps.

408
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,380
I've kind of been busy.

409
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,950
Of course you have. It's just that...

410
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,670
Well, since I'm about to
help you find your cat,

411
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,620
It sure would be nice if you
could help me out with Edie.

412
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,130
Doesn't that seem fair to you?

413
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,010
I guess.

414
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:54,550
Here.

415
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,010
Thank you.

416
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,620
Okay. Toby!

417
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,580
Toby! Come here, boy!

418
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,050
Toby!

419
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,390
So they'll finish with the
news, do a quick traffic update,

420
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,340
And then we're on the air.
Uh, do you need anything?

421
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:16,050
No, I'm good. How do I look?

422
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,870
We're on the radio.

423
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:21,120
Oh. I'm a little bit nervous.

424
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:22,910
This is my first national interview.

425
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,600
And I am a huge fan
of your cookbooks.

426
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:27,800
Well, I've heard
good things about you.

427
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,590
I understand you're catering

428
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,700
Michelle downing's
birthday dinner tonight.

429
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:34,390
Oh, you know michelle?
Yes, and I'll be there.

430
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,300
I can't wait to see what you dish up.

431
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:38,580
Okay, now I'm terrified.

432
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,690
Here we go.

433
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:44,740
Good afternoon.

434
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:48,250
I'm linda flanagan, and
this is "gourmet americana."

435
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,090
If you've been to
fairview's best parties,

436
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,710
Then you've probably tasted
the mouthwatering food

437
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,070
Dished up by my first
guest, bree van de kamp.

438
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,070
Now she's about to
publish her first book,

439
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,750
"Mrs. Van de kamp's
old-Fashioned cooking."

440
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,820
Welcome, bree.

441
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,090
Hi, linda.

442
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,170
Tell me. Why "old-Fashioned"?

443
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:07,270
Well, I think a lot of people
miss the way life used to be--

444
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,500
Back when women had
more time to cook.

445
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:11,090
It's always been important to me

446
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,560
To have the family gather
around the table every night

447
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:16,110
For hot, lovingly prepared meals.

448
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,460
So you're a traditional kinda gal.

449
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,900
Is there a mr. Van de kamp?

450
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,250
No.

451
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:26,120
Uh, mr. Van de kamp is deceased. Oh.

452
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:27,890
But in regards to my husband,

453
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,800
I should make one
thing very clear--

454
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:34,200
His passing had nothing
to do with my cooking.

455
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,140
Is that my yeats book?
I love his poetry.

456
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:46,950
Yeah. I'm borrowing it for school.

457
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,570
This is the kind of poetry
that melts a girl's heart.

458
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,380
So romantic.

459
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:55,540
Oh! Here's
a great one--

460
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:58,650
"The lover tells of
the rose in his heart."

461
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,500
My first boyfriend gave me this poem.

462
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:04,890
I was a junior in-- Mom, I'm--I'm
running late. Can I have the book back?

463
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,560
Oh. Sorry.

464
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,080
Enjoy!

465
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:21,210
Katherine, it is not too
late to change tonight's menu.

466
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,130
If linda flanagan likes my food,

467
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,190
She might give me a
quote for the book jacket.

468
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,520
I have to knock her socks off,

469
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:29,720
And I am not betting
the farm on haddock.

470
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:32,240
Argue with me all you like.

471
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:35,610
I just bought 40 pounds of pork,
so get your tushie over here.

472
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:40,130
Orson! Did you get my
message about linda flanagan?

473
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,240
Yes, I heard.

474
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,410
Isn't it amazing?

475
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:46,360
Mm. Almost as amazing as
my on-Air death notice.

476
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:47,780
What?

477
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,890
"So, bree, do you have a husband?"

478
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:54,460
"Nope. Used to. He croaked." She
didn't ask if I had a husband.

479
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:56,290
She asked if there
was a mr. Van de kamp,

480
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:59,310
And there's clearly not.
Well, there's a mrhodge.

481
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,650
Would it have killed
you to have mentioned me?

482
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,020
And waste valuable airtime?

483
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,660
The show was about my cookbook,

484
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:06,830
Not about my tortured
marital history.

485
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,420
That's not what this is about.

486
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:10,890
It's because I went
to jail, isn't it?

487
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:15,220
Orson, I have 6 hours to
prepare a meal for 80 people.

488
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,270
We're not having this discussion now.

489
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:19,830
Just admit it. You're ashamed of me.

490
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,120
Should I be proud?

491
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:24,720
Do you want me to go
on the radio and boast

492
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,850
That my husband served time
for running someone over?

493
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,750
I went to jail because you told me

494
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,450
It was the only way
you'd take me back.

495
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,670
And because it was
the right thing to do.

496
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,600
I just didn't know then

497
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:38,270
That I would be a
public figure someday.

498
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,890
But I am. I have a name now.

499
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:42,040
And luckily for you, it's not mine.

500
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:47,350
Orson, please don't be hurt.

501
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,990
I am under so much pressure
and so terrified I'll fail

502
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,260
That I don't even know what
I'm saying half the time.

503
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,340
Just let me get through this.

504
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:57,230
As soon as the plates go out tonight,

505
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,810
I will come home and cook
you that pot roast I promised.

506
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:01,870
Okay?

507
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:06,500
Okay. Hmm.

508
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,100
It's just
that... I--

509
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:12,870
Chives! How could I forget chives?

510
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:20,260
Hey, susan, it's me.

511
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:23,630
Listen, I'm not gonna be
able to make dinner tonight.

512
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,900
My college roommate's in town,

513
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:27,520
And this is the only
night we can get together.

514
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:30,090
Oh. Is his name mike delfino?

515
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,700
Did you room together
at liars' college?

516
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:35,020
Um, I know it's last-Minute,
and I'm really sorry,

517
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:36,300
But I stilwanna see you.

518
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:40,610
So how about I drop by later?
Call me if that's a problem.

519
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,030
Yeah, you'll drop by later...

520
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,530
With potato skins on your breath,

521
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,150
You miserable two-Timer!

522
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,650
What's wrong, mom?

523
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,560
Nothing.

524
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,890
Just, the answering
machine lied to mommy.

525
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:00,870
I finally found a poem as beautiful
as you. You're all I think about.

526
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:07,070
"The lover tells of the rose in
his heart" by william butler yeats.

527
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:10,120
Oh, crap on things.

528
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:12,230
Crap on what things?

529
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:19,740
Porter sent me a sex poem.

530
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:22,260
What? Why?

531
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,460
He may be in love with me.

532
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:27,870
Why would he be in love with you?

533
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:31,290
Okay... remember how you told me

534
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,260
I should stop talking to him online?

535
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:34,820
Well, of course, I didn't,

536
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:37,880
And I sort of told
him I liked his poetry.

537
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:41,310
You told a teenage boy
that you liked his poetry?

538
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:44,140
Jeez, lynette! Why not
just flash him a boob?

539
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:46,440
Shh! He'll hear you. So
what are you gonna do?

540
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:48,090
Are you gonna tell him the
truth now, or are you gonna

541
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,150
Wait until after he kills
me and blinds himself?

542
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:53,490
Calm down. I'm gonna
break it off in an e-Mail.

543
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:56,390
Oh, great. Just like
that? That'll kill him.

544
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,760
I know that you have only
been the receiving end

545
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:01,860
Of break-up letters, but
I've actually written a few,

546
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,920
And I know how to let him down easy.

547
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,050
"Dear porter,

548
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,140
"I really like you,

549
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:10,010
But I wanna see other offspring."

550
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,150
Go away.

551
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:21,200
You know, I'm kinda surprised

552
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,310
We still made michelle's
list this year,

553
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,840
What with me working at the club.

554
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:27,570
Oh, don't be silly, carlos.
We're still on everyone's list.

555
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,100
Now let's go. Okay.

556
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,730
Gaby, are we in the banquet hall?

557
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,000
What's all the noise?
Oh, it's just the caterers

558
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:43,260
Putting glasses and
silverware on the tables.

559
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:45,010
They make some racket, huh?

560
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,890
But the decorations are stunning.

561
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:49,370
Especially that waterfall effect.

562
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:52,340
Gaby? Bree!

563
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,000
Shouldn't you be in the kitchen?

564
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,570
Don't move, honey. The
press is taking your photo.

565
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:06,560
What are you doing here? You were
disinvited. I got it all figured out.

566
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:09,340
We duck inside, make sure we're
seen by all the right people--

567
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,580
Except mrs.
Downing--

568
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,410
And then after about
20 minutes, we cut out.

569
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,660
Well, I know nothing.
Just keep me out of it.

570
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,600
What is carlosoing?

571
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:35,390
Where is he? Where is who?

572
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:37,380
Like you don't
know-- Jackson.

573
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:38,830
Well, he's not here.

574
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,690
Really? Whose is this?

575
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:44,290
I... d--I don't
know. Some guy's.

576
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,650
"I... I don't know"?

577
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:49,340
Well, I hope that "some guy"

578
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,260
Doesn't mind this.

579
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:53,470
No, susan, really, I wouldn't...

580
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:56,100
Lady, what are you doing to my beer?

581
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,990
We're not married anymore,

582
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,470
So I don't have to protect you.

583
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:06,420
I am... so sorry.

584
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,990
Miss?

585
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,590
Um... could you just...

586
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:13,210
Please take good care of my friend?

587
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:18,320
Jackson canceled on me.

588
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,760
He said you weren't
comfortable with us hanging out.

589
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:23,890
He said that? And I
think I said, "meow."

590
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:26,490
I am such a jackass.

591
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,340
So why don't you want us hanging out?

592
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,250
Well, I was pretty ticked off

593
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,850
That you told jackson
about the ear thing.

594
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:36,050
Oh, god. The second I said
that, I wished I hadn't.

595
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,800
I-I'm really sorry.

596
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,890
Apology accepted.

597
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:46,260
So if I promise to behave,
can we still hang out?

598
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:48,340
'Cause I really think
it'd be good for m.J.,

599
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,950
Just seeing that we're all friends.

600
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,490
I don't...

601
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,700
What?

602
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:55,650
I'm just not comfortable

603
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,550
With you and jackson
getting that close.

604
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,620
Okay.

605
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:02,380
It's just...

606
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,900
I don't want him to see
me through your eyes.

607
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:10,770
How exactly do you think I see you?

608
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,020
Well, those last few months
we were together, I...

609
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:17,760
The things I said to
you, the way I acted...

610
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:20,410
I mean, I'm not proud
of the person I became.

611
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:23,310
That was a bad time, susan.

612
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,970
We're not those people anymore.

613
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:29,440
And if you could see
yourself through my eyes,

614
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:32,050
You'd know you got
nothing to worry about.

615
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,900
Could you please
take care of this guy?

616
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:44,960
He's my friend, too.

617
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:59,030
Boy, am I glad to see you.

618
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,900
Where you been?

619
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:03,580
Out, uh, doing some thinking.

620
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:08,120
And I've decided that I may
have gone a little overboard

621
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:09,440
About you and mike.

622
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,750
In fact, I think it's cool if
you wanna hang out with my ex.

623
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:16,380
Hey, susie q.!

624
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,990
Just shakin' the dew off the lily.

625
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:20,460
And speaking of,

626
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,310
That paint job in the
guest can is nice. Kudos.

627
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:24,980
What are you doing here?

628
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:28,330
Well, julie needed me to cosign
some insurance stuff for her,

629
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:32,570
And I guess I lost track of time
talking to crunchy granola here.

630
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,470
Plumber to housepainter
in one move, susie?

631
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,010
Don't get dizzy climbin'
that social ladder.

632
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,290
Can you leave, please? Just think...

633
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:45,190
If I'd been a roofer, we might
still be together. Sigh. Get out.

634
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:47,940
See ya around, hacky sack.

635
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:56,420
So... any more exes
I should know about?

636
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:04,850
Don't you just love
michelle's parties?

637
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,200
Oh, they are fun. Mm-Hmm.

638
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:09,560
But I enjoy my intimate
lunches with michelle even more.

639
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:13,280
We have intimate lunches. We're
friends. Well, you simply must come

640
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:15,720
To the charity auction at
ted's gallery next weekend.

641
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:17,530
Really? We'd love to.

642
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,020
Gaby!

643
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:24,380
Well, it's the caterer!

644
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,620
Everything is fabulous.

645
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:30,590
But would you be a dear and get me
some more wine? I would be happy to.

646
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,010
I just want to make sure
it's the kind you like.

647
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,530
You're still here?

648
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:42,180
Dinner is about to be served.
Whose seats are you in? The bowmans.

649
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:45,370
I found out mrs. Bowman is
home with the flu. Score!

650
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,140
Oh, will you unclench? It'll be fine.

651
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:51,640
No, no, no, no, no. These are
my seats. This is my mother.

652
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:54,540
That was mr. Bowman, wasn't it?

653
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:55,300
Yes, and I'm pretty sure

654
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:57,540
That elderly woman
with him was his mother!

655
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:59,040
What kind of man leaves
his sick wife at home

656
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:01,070
To go party with mommy?!
- You can fix this.

657
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,600
Just tell them that
you're at the wrong tabl

658
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:04,110
And then slip out
the side door. Right.

659
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:07,720
Yes, sir, he has absolutely no--
That was the matre d', wasn't it?

660
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:10,390
Yes, and he appears to be checking
the guest list. Which we're not on.

661
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,940
Okay, you can fix this.

662
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:13,520
Just explain you're
going to a different party

663
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:15,470
Here at the club and
that you got confused.

664
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,280
Mrs. Downing never
has to know. Right.

665
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:19,340
You need to leave! Out.

666
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:23,810
That's mrs. Downing.
How am I gonna fix this?

667
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:26,600
At this point, I would just run
off screaming into the night.

668
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:29,040
Thank you. Mm-Hmm.

669
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,340
Get your hands off me.

670
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:33,950
Gaby! Gaby!

671
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:37,210
Poor blind bastard.

672
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,720
I'll meet him outside.

673
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,030
What? Hi, Edie.

674
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:54,800
I just wanted to say I feel
awful about what I said to you.

675
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:57,910
You know, that crack
I made the other day?

676
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,740
Okay.

677
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,130
That's nice of you.

678
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:06,920
Are you all right?

679
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:09,970
Actually, no. My cat's missing.

680
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,110
Toby? Mm-Hmm.

681
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:15,020
Since when? It's been two days,
and he's never been out this long.

682
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:16,860
Oh, I'm so sorry.

683
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,230
I'm sure he's fine.

684
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,110
Yeah. Well...

685
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,820
Could you tell dave...

686
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:26,520
Tell him I apologized? And,
uh, you and I are good, huh?

687
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:30,550
I guess I could.
Why do you want him--

688
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,780
Oh, just tell him, please.

689
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,630
I cannot believe you
pulled a stunt like that.

690
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,170
What?

691
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:47,300
I was just trying to salvage
what's left of our social life.

692
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,800
Now just let it go

693
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:50,150
And start thinking about
where we're gonna move.

694
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,590
This is not a joke, gaby.
I work with these people.

695
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,120
I have to show my face
tomorrow. It's humiliating.

696
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:57,850
You wanna know what's humiliating?

697
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:58,710
Waking up one day

698
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,480
And finding out you're invisible.

699
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:03,410
Now it's official.
I've lost everything.

700
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,400
Everything?

701
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:07,170
First our money, then my figure,

702
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:10,030
Now the last shreds
of our social standing.

703
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,900
We haven't lost a thing

704
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:16,750
Except the chance to hobnob
with a bunch of unhappy snobs.

705
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,970
What do you mean, they're unhappy?

706
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:21,670
They're rich! They
have jewels and cooks.

707
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,700
They use "winter" as a verb.

708
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,100
I rub them, gaby,

709
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,880
And there is nothing

710
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:30,430
That a blind masseur
doesn't hear about.

711
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,680
Trust me.

712
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:34,030
They are every bit
as miserable as I was

713
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,470
When I was out there
chasing that stuff.

714
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:43,870
We have lost nothing that matters.

715
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:47,740
We have a home, we have each other,

716
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:49,240
We have work that supports us,

717
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:52,860
And we have two beautiful
little girls that...

718
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,720
Love us more than ice cream.

719
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:01,420
I've never been happier in my life.

720
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,180
Are you serious?

721
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,430
Yes,

722
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,830
And the only thing that
would make me happier

723
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:11,250
Is forou to realize
how good we've got it.

724
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,510
"I have never talked
to such a wonderful guy,

725
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,610
But I should've told you I'm
already seeing somebody..."

726
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,320
Blah, blah, blah...

727
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:29,450
"Continue to trust your heart,
and your dreams will follow."

728
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,060
Wow, lynette.

729
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:33,950
Best dear john letter ever.

730
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,140
Uh... thanks.

731
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:37,560
Except you might
wanna change that part

732
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:40,840
Where you signed it "love,
mom." What? No I didn't.

733
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:42,930
Yeah, you did...

734
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,140
Right there.

735
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:46,960
You sent it?!

736
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:48,930
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

737
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,740
Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

738
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,700
Why didn't you say something?! I did!

739
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,860
You said it was great.
Way to bury the lead, tom!

740
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,030
Tom, don't you dare! Hey,

741
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,580
One of needs to live to
take care of the other one

742
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:25,210
Hey.

743
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:30,350
Mind if I join you?

744
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,440
Okay, I know what I did...

745
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,520
Was unforgivable.

746
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:40,590
And I am not trying to make excuses,

747
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,990
But...

748
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,100
We used to talk all the time,

749
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:47,570
And then one day it just stopped,

750
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,470
And it killed me.

751
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:52,020
I felt like I lost you.

752
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:55,490
And then I was saraj,
and I had you back,

753
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,550
And we were talking again,
and you were telling me thin.

754
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,330
I wasn't telling you anything.

755
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:02,590
I was telling her.

756
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:06,390
Okay.

757
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:16,000
Well, for what it's worth,

758
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:18,300
I loved our conversations,

759
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:21,390
And I'm... going to miss them.

760
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:29,310
Me, too.

761
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,200
Orson, you're still up.

762
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,380
Oh, I wish you could've been there.

763
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:43,430
Linda flanagan loved my food.

764
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,140
She said I was "god's
gift to the table"

765
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:47,290
And that I could quote
her on the book jacket.

766
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,400
Are you all right?

767
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:52,250
I'm hungry.

768
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,490
It's after midnight.
Haven't you eaten?

769
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:58,390
I was waiting for you. You
said you'd make me pot roast.

770
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,980
I am so sorry. I-I
lost all track of time,

771
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:04,200
And linda had so many
questions about the food.

772
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:06,870
I'll make you that pot
roast tomorrow, okay? No.

773
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,380
I want it now.

774
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:14,640
Now?

775
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,220
You promised.

776
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:20,530
Orson, I've been cooking all day.

777
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,860
I... I'm so tired,
I can barely stand up.

778
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:26,590
You really want me to
make you a pot roast now?

779
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,890
You promised.

780
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:21,420
Toby!

781
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:25,930
Where in the world
did you come from, huh?

782
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:44,600
Yes, everyone appreciates
a good neighbor...

783
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:51,470
You know, the kind that helps
you with the groceries...

784
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:56,310
But doesn't ask, "why
is your son so moody?"

785
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:00,890
The type that delivers misplaced mail

786
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:06,300
But doesn't point out your
wife seems discontented...

787
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:12,150
The sort that offers
to mow your lawn...

788
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:17,730
But doesn't mention
your husband seems cold.

789
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,700
But if you're not
sure the man next door

790
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:25,750
Is as nice as he would
have you believe...

791
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,910
Now why would you bring me flowers?

792
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,840
'Cause you've got a computer,

793
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:33,030
And I need to find out some
stuff about Edie's husband.

794
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:37,500
Do everything you can to
get to know him better.
