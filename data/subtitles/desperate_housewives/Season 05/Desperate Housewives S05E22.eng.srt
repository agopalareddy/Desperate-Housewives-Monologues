1
00:00:03,784 --> 00:00:04,384
Dave!

2
00:00:04,417 --> 00:00:05,417
Is that the bathroom?

3
00:00:05,418 --> 00:00:07,357
No. I think that's it there.

4
00:00:07,391 --> 00:00:09,007
Oh, okay. Thanks.

5
00:00:09,098 --> 00:00:13,279
Dave tried to eliminate a witness to murder.

6
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:14,316
Hey! Uhh!

7
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:16,858
But Jackson survived...

8
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:17,985
I bought M.J. a fishing pole.

9
00:00:17,986 --> 00:00:19,869
We're not gonna be able to make it this weekend.

10
00:00:19,903 --> 00:00:21,944
I'm kind of getting married.
What?

11
00:00:21,978 --> 00:00:24,285
I thought I heard you out here.
Jackson.

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,427
Forcing him to change his plans.

13
00:00:26,461 --> 00:00:28,434
I'm a middle-aged guy...

14
00:00:28,468 --> 00:00:29,510
Tom was searching.

15
00:00:29,511 --> 00:00:31,512
And I don't know what I wanna do with my life.

16
00:00:31,546 --> 00:00:33,920
We're rich again! Hallelujah!

17
00:00:33,954 --> 00:00:35,995
Gaby's life returned to normal.

18
00:00:36,029 --> 00:00:38,771
We're gonna be us again... the old Carlos and Gaby.

19
00:00:38,806 --> 00:00:41,079
I'm gonna make sure that you walk away from this marriage

20
00:00:41,114 --> 00:00:43,622
with your assets intact. Now to accomplish this...

21
00:00:43,657 --> 00:00:46,432
and Bree agreed to protect what she felt was hers.

22
00:00:46,466 --> 00:00:49,443
I'm capable of doing whatever needs to be done.

23
00:00:59,481 --> 00:01:02,758
 The lawyer arrived just after sundown.

24
00:01:04,366 --> 00:01:07,944
He checked to make sure no one was watching,

25
00:01:07,978 --> 00:01:11,423
then he hurried to the front door...

26
00:01:11,457 --> 00:01:14,568
where his client was waiting.

27
00:01:16,275 --> 00:01:20,389
As she poured him the scotch he requested,

28
00:01:20,424 --> 00:01:22,396
the client began to wonder

29
00:01:22,431 --> 00:01:25,274
exactly how he planned to hide her assets

30
00:01:25,308 --> 00:01:28,318
from the husband she was divorcing.

31
00:01:29,683 --> 00:01:33,203
The lawyer suggested some creative accounting.

32
00:01:33,237 --> 00:01:35,879
His client agreed.

33
00:01:35,913 --> 00:01:40,329
He suggest a secret bank account.

34
00:01:40,363 --> 00:01:42,369
She agreed.

35
00:01:43,495 --> 00:01:45,782
He suggested a second set of books.

36
00:01:45,816 --> 00:01:48,793
She agreed.

37
00:01:48,827 --> 00:01:55,116
And then the lawyer looked deep into his client's eyes

38
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:58,595
and made one final suggestion...

39
00:01:58,629 --> 00:02:02,743
that she was completely unprepared for.

40
00:02:02,778 --> 00:02:05,219
You want me to rob my own house?!

41
00:02:05,253 --> 00:02:08,240
Not exactly. I was thinking we'd
hire my friend Tony to do it.

42
00:02:08,241 --> 00:02:08,999
Absolutely not.

43
00:02:09,033 --> 00:02:11,475
I am all up for a little creative accounting

44
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,482
and some secret bank accounts,

45
00:02:13,517 --> 00:02:15,757
but hiring some thug to stage a break-in?

46
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:17,731
It's a community property state, babe.

47
00:02:17,765 --> 00:02:19,772
Orson's going to get half of everything,

48
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,314
including your jewelry, your artwork, your antiques.

49
00:02:22,348 --> 00:02:24,489
Wouldn't it be easier to just have him killed?

50
00:02:24,523 --> 00:02:26,496
As your lawyer, I can't condone that.

51
00:02:26,531 --> 00:02:29,307
That said, I have a cousin... 
I was kidding!

52
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:32,083
So was I. Loosen up, freckles.

53
00:02:32,117 --> 00:02:34,057
Well, I just never know with you.

54
00:02:34,091 --> 00:02:36,065
And don't call me "freckles."

55
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:38,038
Look, if you're not comfortable with Tony,

56
00:02:38,073 --> 00:02:40,045
why don't we do the job ourselves?

57
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,220
I bet you'd look hot in a ski mask.

58
00:02:42,255 --> 00:02:45,699
You are repugnant, and this conversation is over.

59
00:02:45,734 --> 00:02:48,677
Fine, but since I'm charging you for the full hour,

60
00:02:48,711 --> 00:02:51,973
let me make it worth your while. Sit down and close your eyes.

61
00:02:51,974 --> 00:02:52,491
What? No!

62
00:02:52,525 --> 00:02:55,870
Just humor me. Come on.

63
00:02:58,313 --> 00:03:01,590
Now I want you to picture Orson after the divorce.

64
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:05,906
He owns half of your business, half of your assets.

65
00:03:05,941 --> 00:03:07,378
You see it?

66
00:03:07,412 --> 00:03:09,218
Go on.

67
00:03:09,252 --> 00:03:13,433
Now I want you to picture Orson dating some young bimbo.

68
00:03:13,468 --> 00:03:15,407
And don't kid yourself.

69
00:03:15,442 --> 00:03:17,816
He will get a bimbo.

70
00:03:17,851 --> 00:03:20,291
Now picture your favorite strand of pearls

71
00:03:20,326 --> 00:03:24,206
dangling in the 24-year-old cleavage of said bimbo

72
00:03:24,241 --> 00:03:25,979
while she is using

73
00:03:26,013 --> 00:03:28,540
your first edition Robert Frost as a coaster...

74
00:03:28,891 --> 00:03:32,102
And your 19th century french crystal vase

75
00:03:32,136 --> 00:03:33,607
as an ashtray.

76
00:03:33,642 --> 00:03:35,982
If you can live with that...

77
00:03:36,017 --> 00:03:39,930
I will leave.

78
00:03:39,964 --> 00:03:41,402
And with that,

79
00:03:41,436 --> 00:03:44,246
The client offered a suggestion of her own...

80
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,220
We should probably break a window

81
00:03:46,254 --> 00:03:48,260
to make it look more real.

82
00:03:50,068 --> 00:03:53,914
And the lawyer agreed.

83
00:04:02,981 --> 00:04:04,720
Masks... 

84
00:04:04,755 --> 00:04:08,568
you can find them in any home.

85
00:04:08,602 --> 00:04:13,051
Some are used once a year to scare the neighbors...

86
00:04:14,591 --> 00:04:18,738
Some are needed for the occasional chore.

87
00:04:18,772 --> 00:04:24,425
Some are applied every other Thursday.

88
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,235
Then there's the kind of mask

89
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:29,811
some men wear every day.

90
00:04:29,846 --> 00:04:32,789
It's a friendly smile

91
00:04:32,823 --> 00:04:37,171
designed to hide the most wicked of intentions.

92
00:04:37,205 --> 00:04:39,446
Hey, M.J., is your mom home?

93
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,554
She's inside talking to Jackson.

94
00:04:43,662 --> 00:04:45,836
Really?

95
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,984
So... what do you think of Jackson?

96
00:04:50,019 --> 00:04:53,665
I like him. He buys me comic books.

97
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:56,408
Yeah, he's a good guy.

98
00:04:56,442 --> 00:04:58,415
He was very brave that night

99
00:04:58,449 --> 00:05:00,757
during that fire at the nightclub.

100
00:05:00,792 --> 00:05:03,266
Does he ever talk about that fire...

101
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,042
or anybody he saw that night?

102
00:05:06,078 --> 00:05:09,723
Have the police stopped by to ask him any questions?

103
00:05:11,329 --> 00:05:14,741
If they do, would you let me know?

104
00:05:14,775 --> 00:05:16,113
Why?

105
00:05:16,147 --> 00:05:17,953
Well...

106
00:05:17,987 --> 00:05:21,265
I wanna make sure they're being nice to our friend Jackson,

107
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,242
'cause he's such a good guy.

108
00:05:30,198 --> 00:05:34,479
It is such a stunning piece.

109
00:05:34,514 --> 00:05:38,126
It's simple and elegant. Don't you think?

110
00:05:40,067 --> 00:05:42,040
I mean, I know it was expensive,

111
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:45,286
but you can't put a price tag on beauty. Am I right?

112
00:05:47,193 --> 00:05:49,669
So when daddy finds out how much I spent,

113
00:05:49,703 --> 00:05:53,013
would it be okay if I used you as a human shield?

114
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:58,467
You know, I should really get you tested.

115
00:06:00,676 --> 00:06:02,649
Mom?

116
00:06:02,683 --> 00:06:04,789
Hey! Did you have a fun playdate with Heather?

117
00:06:04,825 --> 00:06:07,299
She's got a canopy bed. I want one.

118
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:10,611
We just bought you a bed. It's not even a year old.

119
00:06:10,645 --> 00:06:13,990
I don't like it anymore. I wanna sleep under a canopy.

120
00:06:14,025 --> 00:06:18,406
Then go move in with Heather, 'cause I'm not getting you one.

121
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,480
Why not? We're rich.

122
00:06:20,515 --> 00:06:23,491
Who told you that?
I heard you telling Aunt Bree,

123
00:06:23,526 --> 00:06:26,702
since daddy got his new job, we're rolling in money.

124
00:06:26,737 --> 00:06:28,844
Well, mommy shouldn't have said that.

125
00:06:28,878 --> 00:06:32,055
Just, when Aunt Bree started bragging about her Prada bag,

126
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:35,334
mommy kind of lost it.

127
00:06:35,368 --> 00:06:37,006
Whatever.

128
00:06:37,042 --> 00:06:40,219
I want a canopy, and you gotta get me one.

129
00:06:40,253 --> 00:06:42,694
I don't have to get you anything.

130
00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:44,702
And stop acting like a spoiled brat.

131
00:06:44,736 --> 00:06:47,713
I am not spending a fortune on a bed you don't need.

132
00:06:47,747 --> 00:06:50,991
Oh, but you can spend millions of dollars on a stupid vase?

133
00:06:51,025 --> 00:06:53,634
That vase is not stupid.

134
00:06:53,668 --> 00:06:55,608
Is that vase stupid?

135
00:06:57,716 --> 00:07:00,994
Okay, you know what? This conversation is over.

136
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:03,503
Go to your room!

137
00:07:03,537 --> 00:07:05,243
You, too, bobblehead.

138
00:07:06,716 --> 00:07:09,558
Okay, my clothes are in the closet.

139
00:07:09,593 --> 00:07:12,336
I'm going to put my toothbrush in the bathroom.

140
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,844
Oh, just leave the toilet seat up,

141
00:07:14,878 --> 00:07:18,257
and the immigration people will totally think we're married.

142
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:21,268
Yeah, I don't know how I'm gonna thank you for doing this.

143
00:07:21,302 --> 00:07:25,216
Actually, I did think of one way you could repay me.

144
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,189
Mmm. You got it.

145
00:07:27,224 --> 00:07:29,698
Uh, no. not like that.

146
00:07:29,733 --> 00:07:33,010
No, I was thinking that after our quickie courthouse ceremony,

147
00:07:33,045 --> 00:07:35,788
you could buy me a cake.

148
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:37,527
I love wedding cake.

149
00:07:37,561 --> 00:07:40,772
It's the one part of marriage that never lets you down.

150
00:07:40,807 --> 00:07:42,779
Well, I can do you better than that.

151
00:07:42,814 --> 00:07:45,589
How out I throw us a big engagement party?

152
00:07:45,624 --> 00:07:47,162
What?

153
00:07:47,197 --> 00:07:49,169
Well, we're not having a wedding,

154
00:07:49,204 --> 00:07:51,344
and we're gonna need pictures of something

155
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:53,351
to put in our photo album as evidence.

156
00:07:53,386 --> 00:07:55,861
Okay. Yeah, I guess that could be fun.

157
00:07:55,895 --> 00:07:58,369
While our friends are toasting to our everlasting happiness,

158
00:07:58,404 --> 00:08:01,146
we can yell, "surprise! It's all a sham!

159
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:03,154
Thanks for the crock-pot!"

160
00:08:03,188 --> 00:08:06,098
No, no, no. We can't tell anybody this is a fake.

161
00:08:06,132 --> 00:08:09,276
The whole thing could blow up.
Can't I at least tell the girls?

162
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:12,287
No way. I mean, they don't call her "Gabby" for nothing.

163
00:08:12,321 --> 00:08:14,728
Wow.

164
00:08:14,763 --> 00:08:18,074
Ah, fake marriages... they're complicated.

165
00:08:18,108 --> 00:08:20,416
I... I... I know I'm asking a lot, Susan.

166
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:23,929
No, no. It's okay. I wanna do this.

167
00:08:23,964 --> 00:08:26,338
Truth is...

168
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:28,746
I miss you,

169
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,757
and the house has been kinda lonely since you left.

170
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,535
Well, I hear you loud and clear.

171
00:08:34,569 --> 00:08:36,843
Not that lonely.

172
00:08:54,274 --> 00:08:56,246
What are you doing?
Thinking.

173
00:08:56,281 --> 00:08:58,956
Well, think inside. I made pork chops.

174
00:08:58,991 --> 00:09:01,633
Aren't you gonna ask me about my job interview?

175
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:04,075
Oh, right. How'd that go?

176
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,052
Okay... until the 30-year-old who was interviewing me asked me

177
00:09:07,086 --> 00:09:10,866
if I'd ever used twittering as part of a marketing campaign.

178
00:09:10,901 --> 00:09:13,007
And what'd you say?

179
00:09:13,042 --> 00:09:14,346
Nothing...

180
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:17,490
Because I don't know what "twittering" is.

181
00:09:17,525 --> 00:09:20,501
It's a social networking tool where you send instant updates

182
00:09:20,536 --> 00:09:23,211
to anybody who signs up for them.

183
00:09:23,245 --> 00:09:27,995
So... you knew about this, and yet you kept it from me?

184
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:30,504
I didn't keep it from you.

185
00:09:30,538 --> 00:09:32,812
It's just one of those tech things

186
00:09:32,847 --> 00:09:35,020
that you don't care about.

187
00:09:35,055 --> 00:09:36,994
It's for young people.

188
00:09:37,028 --> 00:09:40,876
And I am a dinosaur marching into the tar pit.

189
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,184
I didn't say that.

190
00:09:43,218 --> 00:09:46,195
You're not gonna get a whole lot of sympathy from me.

191
00:09:46,229 --> 00:09:48,269
I just went through the same thing. Remember?

192
00:09:48,303 --> 00:09:50,745
Yeah, but you didn't tell me how bad it was.

193
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:53,020
That's another thing you kept from me.

194
00:09:53,054 --> 00:09:56,031
50 guys showed up for that one job,

195
00:09:56,065 --> 00:10:00,479
and I was 10 years older than every single one of 'em.

196
00:10:00,514 --> 00:10:03,022
I could hear 'em twittering as I left the room.

197
00:10:03,057 --> 00:10:06,133
I think you mean "tittering."

198
00:10:06,168 --> 00:10:09,546
Sorry. Please, don't hit me.

199
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:13,293
I heard a door slam shut today, Lynette.

200
00:10:13,327 --> 00:10:17,208
It's official. My time has passed.

201
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:20,084
I am no longer relevant.

202
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,594
Oh, for God sakes, knock it off!

203
00:10:22,628 --> 00:10:25,102
I am not gonna let you feel sorry for yourself.

204
00:10:25,137 --> 00:10:27,712
You are Tom Scavo, damn it!

205
00:10:27,746 --> 00:10:29,652
And?

206
00:10:31,795 --> 00:10:35,842
Sorry. I got nothing else. Come inside and eat your pork.

207
00:10:43,451 --> 00:10:47,097
This place smells funny. I don't wanna be here.

208
00:10:47,131 --> 00:10:49,238
Well, you should've thought about that

209
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,445
before you started acting like such a diva. Now sit down.

210
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,855
Father Crowley!

211
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:56,029
This is a surprise.

212
00:10:56,064 --> 00:10:58,505
What brings you to our soup kitchen?

213
00:10:58,539 --> 00:11:00,981
Well, I want Juanita to work with the poor.

214
00:11:01,015 --> 00:11:03,289
I want to teach her to be grateful

215
00:11:03,324 --> 00:11:06,232
for how good she has it.
Oh, well, we can always use a hand.

216
00:11:06,267 --> 00:11:08,039
And four hands? Well, that's a blessing.

217
00:11:08,074 --> 00:11:10,381
Oh, me? No, no. Not me.

218
00:11:10,415 --> 00:11:12,456
I'm not really dressed for ladling,

219
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,964
but, um, I could stand by the condiment bar

220
00:11:14,999 --> 00:11:17,507
and spritz people with my Chanel.

221
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:23,061
And you say Juanita is a little ungrateful? Hmm.

222
00:11:30,087 --> 00:11:31,759
Fran Schulman?

223
00:11:33,266 --> 00:11:34,536
Fran.
Huh?

224
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,610
It's Gabrielle Solis from the tennis club.

225
00:11:36,645 --> 00:11:38,717
Oh, of course.

226
00:11:38,752 --> 00:11:40,458
Wow, it's been years!

227
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:44,137
The last time I saw you was at that charity fashion show.

228
00:11:44,172 --> 00:11:46,178
Wasn't that fun?
Yes. Yes, it was.

229
00:11:46,213 --> 00:11:48,353
So what are you doing here? Are you volunteering?

230
00:11:48,387 --> 00:11:50,828
Not exactly.
Me either.

231
00:11:50,863 --> 00:11:52,802
My daughter's gotten so snooty,

232
00:11:52,836 --> 00:11:55,779
I am forcing her to spend time with the great unwashed.

233
00:11:55,814 --> 00:11:58,757
You wanna ditch this place for a cappuccino?

234
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:03,072
Um, actually, I'm here to eat.

235
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:09,764
Oh!

236
00:12:13,478 --> 00:12:15,652
It's Susan.

237
00:12:15,687 --> 00:12:18,663
Great. We don't see enough of her.

238
00:12:18,698 --> 00:12:21,440
And she's not alone.

239
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:24,852
Hey, Jackson. Long time no see. What's going on?

240
00:12:24,886 --> 00:12:28,431
Um... we sort of have an announcement.

241
00:12:29,804 --> 00:12:31,810
We're getting married.

242
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:37,297
Oh, my God!

243
00:12:37,332 --> 00:12:39,639
This is such great news!

244
00:12:39,674 --> 00:12:40,943
Oh!

245
00:12:40,978 --> 00:12:43,218
So... when's the date?

246
00:12:43,253 --> 00:12:44,757
Monday.

247
00:12:44,792 --> 00:12:48,003
Whoa. W... well, that's kind of sudden.

248
00:12:48,037 --> 00:12:50,478
Well, when you know, you know.

249
00:12:50,513 --> 00:12:53,456
Why wait? And we're having a little engagement party on Friday,

250
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:55,296
and you're both invited.

251
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,303
A party? Count us in.

252
00:12:57,338 --> 00:13:00,080
I can't think of a better reason to... celebrate.

253
00:13:00,115 --> 00:13:02,723
Have you told M.J. yet?

254
00:13:02,758 --> 00:13:05,132
Yeah. He was on board when he found out there was cake.

255
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,972
Okay.

256
00:13:07,006 --> 00:13:10,518
Just wanna make sure this isn't all happening too fast for him.

257
00:13:10,552 --> 00:13:13,495
You know kids. They need a little time to adjust.

258
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:15,537
Oh, kids are resilient.

259
00:13:15,571 --> 00:13:17,978
He'll be fine. I'm so excited!

260
00:13:20,924 --> 00:13:24,736
Well, uh, we wanted you two to be the first to know,

261
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:27,111
and we should probably get going.

262
00:13:27,146 --> 00:13:29,486
Got a few more neighbors to shock.

263
00:13:29,521 --> 00:13:31,963
Oh, well, we are just so happy for you.

264
00:13:31,997 --> 00:13:34,606
Yeah. Congratulations.

265
00:13:44,777 --> 00:13:48,222
Now if we're going with the Damask for the settee,

266
00:13:48,256 --> 00:13:52,002
then I strongly suggest that
we do the couch in the chenille.

267
00:13:52,037 --> 00:13:53,842
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

268
00:13:53,877 --> 00:13:56,853
The only word I understood there was "couch."

269
00:13:56,888 --> 00:13:58,860
I'll explain it to him later.

270
00:13:58,895 --> 00:14:00,834
Good, because they're only going to hold this fabric

271
00:14:00,868 --> 00:14:02,874
for a couple of days.

272
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,849
Well, I am off.

273
00:14:04,883 --> 00:14:07,927
Ohh. Isn't that vase divine?

274
00:14:07,961 --> 00:14:09,934
I am so glad you like it.

275
00:14:11,273 --> 00:14:14,651
I thought we were just trying out the vase.

276
00:14:14,686 --> 00:14:17,996
I'll explain it to him later.
Okay.

277
00:14:18,031 --> 00:14:20,439
Mm-hmm. Thank you.

278
00:14:22,948 --> 00:14:24,922
Can you believe this?

279
00:14:24,956 --> 00:14:27,397
Seven years ago, Evelyn did Fran's house.

280
00:14:27,432 --> 00:14:29,371
Now? No house.

281
00:14:29,406 --> 00:14:32,450
That's crazy. You ask Fran what happened?

282
00:14:32,484 --> 00:14:34,623
No! I didn't want to embarrass her.

283
00:14:34,658 --> 00:14:37,133
You met her in line for free soup.

284
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,608
How much more embarrassed could she get?

285
00:14:39,643 --> 00:14:42,051
Remember that dinner party she gave?

286
00:14:42,085 --> 00:14:44,526
She had 20 place settings of Tiffany china.

287
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,173
How does this happen to someone who has Tiffany china?

288
00:14:48,207 --> 00:14:51,050
This is $200 a yard.

289
00:14:51,085 --> 00:14:53,894
Tell Fran to save us a place in line.

290
00:14:53,928 --> 00:14:56,035
I bet I know what happened.

291
00:14:56,069 --> 00:14:57,707
She drank it away.

292
00:14:57,742 --> 00:14:59,714
That one New Year's Eve

293
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,592
where she got so plowed she fell in the koi pond...

294
00:15:02,626 --> 00:15:05,503
where she landed on you, drunky sue.

295
00:15:06,976 --> 00:15:09,751
Everybody was hammered at that party.

296
00:15:09,786 --> 00:15:12,394
Well, then it must've been a gambling problem.

297
00:15:12,429 --> 00:15:14,904
Based on what?

298
00:15:14,938 --> 00:15:18,048
She never missed bingo night at Immaculate Heart...

299
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,758
and she was Lutheran.

300
00:15:20,792 --> 00:15:23,602
You really think she bingo'ed her house away?

301
00:15:23,637 --> 00:15:26,545
Uh, I don't know. There has to be some reason.

302
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:29,055
You don't fall that far that fast

303
00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:31,363
without making some really stupid choices.

304
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:33,605
Why you gettin' so angry?

305
00:15:37,085 --> 00:15:39,593
It was Tiffany china, Carlos.

306
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:51,015
Aha! There's the man that ruined my fishing trip.

307
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,157
Sorry about that, Dave.
Oh, no worries.

308
00:15:53,191 --> 00:15:56,603
Hey, I am so happy for you and Susan. Congratulations.

309
00:15:56,637 --> 00:15:58,108
Thanks.

310
00:15:58,143 --> 00:16:00,082
So how have you been?

311
00:16:00,116 --> 00:16:02,089
We haven't had a chance to talk since...

312
00:16:02,123 --> 00:16:04,397
I don't know, probably the fire.

313
00:16:04,432 --> 00:16:07,108
Uh, yeah. You were the big hero.

314
00:16:07,142 --> 00:16:09,567
I was the doofus that got stuck in the men's room.

315
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:11,088
Oh, that was a hell of a night.

316
00:16:11,123 --> 00:16:13,698
Sure would like to forget that.
Yeah, me, too.

317
00:16:13,732 --> 00:16:16,208
Unfortunately, I have to go down
and talk to the cops on Tuesday.

318
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:16,508
Really?

319
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:19,485
Yeah. I went down to city hall to get my marriage certificate,

320
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,430
And I ran in one of the detectives from that night,

321
00:16:22,464 --> 00:16:24,872
and apparently, they've been trying to get in touch with me.

322
00:16:24,907 --> 00:16:27,448
So now I get to go down there the day after my wedding.

323
00:16:27,482 --> 00:16:29,221
Some honeymoon, huh?

324
00:16:29,256 --> 00:16:32,232
Wow. Those guys really know how to put a crimp in your day.

325
00:16:32,267 --> 00:16:35,210
So did they say what they wanted to talk to you about?

326
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:38,454
I guess they just wanna know if I saw anything suspicious.

327
00:16:38,489 --> 00:16:41,499
Hmm. Did you?

328
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:44,343
Mm, no. I mean, I was backstage.

329
00:16:44,377 --> 00:16:48,057
I was headed to the men's room, and I ran into... 

330
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:49,963
Oh! Ugh!

331
00:16:49,998 --> 00:16:51,636
I am so sorry.

332
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:54,011
Oh, no. Don't worry about it. I'll take care of it.

333
00:16:54,045 --> 00:16:56,387
I mean, there's gotta be a mop around here somewhere.

334
00:16:56,421 --> 00:16:58,361
That's not coming out.

335
00:16:58,395 --> 00:17:02,074
Oh, Bree can get rid of that in a jiffy.

336
00:17:02,109 --> 00:17:04,884
Now where did she go?

337
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:16,024
Okay. Showtime.
Wipe your feet first.

338
00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:17,999
I just had the carpets cleaned.

339
00:17:18,033 --> 00:17:19,972
Just because we're thieves

340
00:17:20,007 --> 00:17:22,482
doesn't mean we need to be untidy.

341
00:17:35,396 --> 00:17:37,235
Are we stealing this?

342
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:39,176
Uh, yes. As I recall, it's quite valuable.

343
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:41,919
What about this?
Oh, God, no.

344
00:17:41,953 --> 00:17:43,959
That's Orson's dental Innovator of the Year award.

345
00:17:43,994 --> 00:17:45,967
I've always hated that thing.

346
00:17:46,002 --> 00:17:47,840
Oh, here.

347
00:17:49,681 --> 00:17:51,287
What are you doing?

348
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:54,665
I, uh, took some of my silver off the mantle,

349
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,639
and it threw off the balance.

350
00:17:56,674 --> 00:17:59,349
Yeah.

351
00:17:59,383 --> 00:18:02,059
You're right. Let me help.

352
00:18:04,067 --> 00:18:06,609
There. Balance restored.

353
00:18:06,643 --> 00:18:08,817
Was that necessary?

354
00:18:08,851 --> 00:18:11,828
This place has to look like it was ransacked by robbers,

355
00:18:11,862 --> 00:18:13,500
not someone's personal shopper.

356
00:18:13,501 --> 00:18:16,143
Fine! But do you have to do it with such relish?

357
00:18:18,185 --> 00:18:21,161
Hey, you're not paying me to just go through the motions.

358
00:18:21,195 --> 00:18:24,507
Speaking of which... are you nailing Orson like we discussed?

359
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:26,983
That is none of your business.

360
00:18:27,017 --> 00:18:29,826
Well, we have to make sure he doesn't suspect anything.

361
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,770
I do the bare minimum. No more, no less.

362
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:37,220
So is he just missionary?

363
00:18:38,793 --> 00:18:41,134
He seems like a strictly missionary kind of guy.

364
00:18:41,168 --> 00:18:43,108
Must you be so crude?

365
00:18:43,142 --> 00:18:45,517
Must you always be such a priss?

366
00:18:45,551 --> 00:18:47,491
You freak out at the mention of sex.

367
00:18:47,525 --> 00:18:49,498
You never want to make a mess.

368
00:18:49,532 --> 00:18:51,639
You suppress every spontaneous urge you ever have!

369
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:54,315
Man, it must be exhausting being you!

370
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,289
Yes, being a lady takes effort.

371
00:18:56,323 --> 00:18:58,799
Well, maybe give it a rest once in a while.

372
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:01,374
It might surprise you how good it feels.

373
00:19:01,409 --> 00:19:03,883
You wanna be a Neanderthal, Karl? That's your choice.

374
00:19:03,918 --> 00:19:06,359
I prefer to behave with class and dignity.

375
00:19:06,394 --> 00:19:09,203
Now may we please finish robbing my home?

376
00:19:23,221 --> 00:19:27,737
Bill Brown!

377
00:19:27,771 --> 00:19:30,178
It's Tom Scavo.

378
00:19:30,214 --> 00:19:32,688
Tom! Oh, my God!

379
00:19:32,722 --> 00:19:34,662
What are you doing here?

380
00:19:34,696 --> 00:19:37,673
Well, Jackson and I are in the same soccer league.

381
00:19:37,707 --> 00:19:39,646
Lynette, this is Bill Brown.

382
00:19:39,682 --> 00:19:41,490
We were roommates freshmen year in college.

383
00:19:41,491 --> 00:19:41,654
Hi.

384
00:19:41,689 --> 00:19:43,628
Really?
Yeah!

385
00:19:43,662 --> 00:19:46,121
God, you look fantastic. You haven't aged a day.

386
00:19:46,122 --> 00:19:47,275
Hey, right back at ya.

387
00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:49,382
Liar. You didn't even recognize me.

388
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:51,476
Back up a second. You guys were classmates?

389
00:19:51,477 --> 00:19:51,757
Yeah.

390
00:19:51,792 --> 00:19:54,133
Meaning you were in the same class at the same time?

391
00:19:54,167 --> 00:19:56,641
That's what classmates means, Lynette. We're the same age.

392
00:19:58,316 --> 00:20:00,757
Actually, I think I'm six months older.

393
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:02,798
You're older?!

394
00:20:02,832 --> 00:20:05,240
I'm sorry, I just cannot believe...

395
00:20:06,713 --> 00:20:08,987
That they're out of stuffed mushrooms.

396
00:20:09,021 --> 00:20:10,726
Excuse me.

397
00:20:10,761 --> 00:20:13,235
Okay, my wife's annoying, but she is right.

398
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:15,678
What's your secret? What is it? Diet? Exercise?

399
00:20:15,712 --> 00:20:18,153
You eatin' a bowl of stem cells every morning?

400
00:20:18,188 --> 00:20:20,663
Come on. What's going on, Peter Pan?

401
00:20:20,697 --> 00:20:22,938
Okay... You really wanna know?

402
00:20:26,585 --> 00:20:27,922
Hi!

403
00:20:27,957 --> 00:20:30,364
This is for you and Jackson. Congratulations!

404
00:20:30,398 --> 00:20:32,350
Aw, how sweet. Oh! And heavy.

405
00:20:32,351 --> 00:20:33,911
Score.

406
00:20:33,945 --> 00:20:35,885
Yeah, well, we can afford to be generous

407
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,795
now that I'm off the hook for alimony.

408
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,468
Yeah. What?

409
00:20:40,502 --> 00:20:42,140
You're getting remarried.

410
00:20:42,175 --> 00:20:44,282
So I can stop sending that check every month.

411
00:20:44,316 --> 00:20:47,091
Everybody gets a gift.

412
00:20:47,127 --> 00:20:49,066
Right! Score for you!

413
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:52,044
Uh, can I talk to you for a sec?

414
00:20:52,078 --> 00:20:53,415
Yeah?

415
00:20:58,099 --> 00:21:00,073
Oh, thank you.

416
00:21:02,181 --> 00:21:04,087
You get alimony?

417
00:21:04,121 --> 00:21:06,428
I thought you were too proud take alimony.

418
00:21:06,464 --> 00:21:09,406
I was too proud to admit it. I'm not too proud to take it.

419
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,581
I need that money, Jackson.

420
00:21:11,582 --> 00:21:14,024
Well, I... I can try to chip in.
"Chip in"?

421
00:21:14,058 --> 00:21:16,532
It's not a birthday cake for Shirley in accounting.

422
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:20,112
It's mortgage and food and insurance.

423
00:21:20,147 --> 00:21:22,153
I'm sorry, but I can't marry you.

424
00:21:22,187 --> 00:21:24,796
No, Susan, they'll send me back.

425
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,468
It's Canada, not Iran.

426
00:21:26,502 --> 00:21:29,011
It's like America with free health insurance.

427
00:21:29,045 --> 00:21:31,487
Okay, I know this is important to you,

428
00:21:31,521 --> 00:21:34,498
but I depend on that check every month.
And I know you do.

429
00:21:34,532 --> 00:21:37,475
I just can't believe that I finally found a job that I love,

430
00:21:37,509 --> 00:21:40,486
and now I just gotta give it up.

431
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,995
Well, look, maybe... I could talk to Mike.

432
00:21:43,029 --> 00:21:45,237
I could see if we could work something out.

433
00:21:45,271 --> 00:21:46,742
You'd do that?

434
00:21:46,777 --> 00:21:48,849
Yeah, I'll try.

435
00:21:48,884 --> 00:21:51,359
Don't think he's not gonna want his gift back.

436
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,399
And it's really heavy, too.

437
00:21:59,289 --> 00:22:00,693
So...

438
00:22:00,727 --> 00:22:03,202
you thought my friend bill looked pretty fantastic, huh?

439
00:22:03,236 --> 00:22:05,175
Okay, I went a little overboard.

440
00:22:05,211 --> 00:22:07,350
You know me... two margaritas, and I need a muzzle.

441
00:22:07,384 --> 00:22:09,290
No, I completely agree with you. He looks really young.

442
00:22:09,325 --> 00:22:11,197
I know, right? He must take care of himself.

443
00:22:11,232 --> 00:22:13,205
Actually, he told me his secret,

444
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,312
and I'm thinking of doing the same thing.

445
00:22:15,347 --> 00:22:19,059
No, you're not having plastic surgery.

446
00:22:19,094 --> 00:22:20,498
It's my face.

447
00:22:20,533 --> 00:22:22,572
Uh, we live in a community property state,

448
00:22:22,606 --> 00:22:24,580
so half that face is mine.

449
00:22:24,614 --> 00:22:27,558
Fine, you know what? You get the half below the nose.

450
00:22:27,592 --> 00:22:30,669
But these wrinkles up here? All going away.

451
00:22:30,703 --> 00:22:33,177
Tom, men don't need plastic surgery.

452
00:22:33,211 --> 00:22:36,121
They look better as they age.

453
00:22:36,156 --> 00:22:37,460
Real?

454
00:22:37,494 --> 00:22:39,467
Because you couldn't stop talking

455
00:22:39,501 --> 00:22:41,943
about how great Bill looked. "you guys were classmates?

456
00:22:41,978 --> 00:22:44,585
You mean the same class at the same time?"

457
00:22:44,621 --> 00:22:47,596
Okay, that's a lousy impression of me.

458
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:51,076
Look, Bill said it really gave him a leg up in job interviews,

459
00:22:51,111 --> 00:22:53,585
and I could use that right now.

460
00:22:53,619 --> 00:22:55,593
You don't need a face-lift.

461
00:22:55,627 --> 00:22:58,101
What if I went out and got a boob job

462
00:22:58,136 --> 00:23:00,744
and came home with big, giant sideshow boobs?

463
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:02,751
How would you like that?

464
00:23:02,787 --> 00:23:05,595
I'd learn to live with it somehow.

465
00:23:07,437 --> 00:23:10,714
You're not doing this. We can't afford it!

466
00:23:10,749 --> 00:23:14,059
It's an investment in our future. We can't afford not to.

467
00:23:14,094 --> 00:23:16,870
I'm calling the doctor and making an appointment.

468
00:23:16,904 --> 00:23:19,551
If you want, I can also get a price check on a pair of... 

469
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,851
I'm not getting a boob job.

470
00:23:27,944 --> 00:23:31,724
Why don't I make you a nice cup of Earl Grey...

471
00:23:33,665 --> 00:23:36,675
Oh, dear God.

472
00:23:36,709 --> 00:23:40,890
Orson, we've been robbed!

473
00:23:40,925 --> 00:23:43,500
It wasn't me. I swear.

474
00:23:49,084 --> 00:23:51,170
No cuts! Back of the line.

475
00:23:51,204 --> 00:23:54,333
Oh, relax. I already ate dinner at home...

476
00:23:54,367 --> 00:23:57,362
in my box under the bridge.

477
00:23:59,617 --> 00:24:00,962
Fran?

478
00:24:00,997 --> 00:24:04,023
Oh, God. I was afraid I wouldn't find you here.

479
00:24:04,059 --> 00:24:06,716
Ah, lucky you, I'm still poor.

480
00:24:06,751 --> 00:24:09,374
I feel bad I ducked out so fast the other day.

481
00:24:09,409 --> 00:24:11,360
And I've been thinking about you a lot,

482
00:24:11,394 --> 00:24:13,681
and I just... I really wanna help.

483
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:20,613
Wow.

484
00:24:20,647 --> 00:24:22,261
Thank you. Thank you!

485
00:24:22,296 --> 00:24:23,843
Now...

486
00:24:23,878 --> 00:24:26,501
I just wanna make sure that you're not gonna...

487
00:24:26,536 --> 00:24:28,487
you know...

488
00:24:28,522 --> 00:24:31,482
Drinking was never my problem, Gaby.

489
00:24:31,517 --> 00:24:34,712
I didn't think so. You were always so classy.

490
00:24:34,746 --> 00:24:36,462
20, 40, 60...

491
00:24:36,497 --> 00:24:38,481
Was it drugs?

492
00:24:38,515 --> 00:24:40,970
No. I never did drugs.

493
00:24:41,006 --> 00:24:42,418
Good to know.

494
00:24:42,452 --> 00:24:43,931
80, 100.

495
00:24:43,966 --> 00:24:46,927
Because gambling is bad enough without being high.

496
00:24:46,961 --> 00:24:49,450
I never gambled a day in my life, Gaby.

497
00:24:49,486 --> 00:24:52,984
Well, then what the hell happened?

498
00:24:53,018 --> 00:24:54,632
This doesn't make sense.

499
00:24:54,666 --> 00:24:57,930
I was at your house. You had such lovely things.

500
00:24:57,964 --> 00:25:00,622
Yes, Mark and I lived really well.

501
00:25:00,656 --> 00:25:03,280
Probably a little... too well.

502
00:25:03,314 --> 00:25:04,962
But we were young,

503
00:25:04,997 --> 00:25:07,923
and we thought we had time to save for the future.

504
00:25:07,958 --> 00:25:10,278
Then he died.

505
00:25:10,313 --> 00:25:13,879
Mark died?

506
00:25:13,914 --> 00:25:15,898
I didn't know.

507
00:25:15,933 --> 00:25:18,220
He was sick a really long time.

508
00:25:18,255 --> 00:25:20,509
He couldn't work. He lost his insurance.

509
00:25:20,543 --> 00:25:23,503
By the time he passed away, we were completely wiped out.

510
00:25:23,538 --> 00:25:25,892
Oh, Fran, I'm so sorry.

511
00:25:25,927 --> 00:25:29,627
You didn't have any family to turn to? Any friends?

512
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:33,799
No family, and as it turns out, not too many friends either.

513
00:25:33,834 --> 00:25:36,862
Look, Gaby, know you came here

514
00:25:36,896 --> 00:25:39,890
wanting to find out what I did to make this all happen.

515
00:25:39,925 --> 00:25:42,818
But the truth is, we're all just an accident or a tumor

516
00:25:42,852 --> 00:25:44,837
or a bad investment away from...

517
00:25:44,871 --> 00:25:47,528
standing in line for free soup.

518
00:25:47,563 --> 00:25:48,908
Thank you.

519
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:53,989
I don't agree, Fran.

520
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,830
You know, Carlos went blind for five years.

521
00:26:01,864 --> 00:26:04,319
We went broke. We almost lost our house.

522
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:07,315
But we worked our asses off and we made it back.

523
00:26:07,349 --> 00:26:10,983
Oh, so just because you survived that,

524
00:26:11,017 --> 00:26:13,472
you think you've crossed some kind of finish line,

525
00:26:13,506 --> 00:26:15,794
that nothing bad can happen again?

526
00:26:15,828 --> 00:26:17,812
Well, no, but... 
Listen.

527
00:26:17,847 --> 00:26:20,303
I hope it works out for you.

528
00:26:20,338 --> 00:26:24,071
I hope you never lose that big, beautiful home of yours.

529
00:26:24,106 --> 00:26:27,335
God knows I wish I'd appreciated mine more while I had it.

530
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:34,772
Thank you again.

531
00:26:50,587 --> 00:26:54,524
Remind me again when you're getting your teeth cleaned.

532
00:26:54,558 --> 00:26:57,115
Um... the 14th.

533
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:59,134
And the 15th, we have tickets

534
00:26:59,169 --> 00:27:01,623
to that play that you're dragging me to.

535
00:27:01,659 --> 00:27:02,970
Yes. Why?

536
00:27:03,004 --> 00:27:05,459
I'm just... I'm trying to figure out

537
00:27:05,495 --> 00:27:08,488
when would be a good time to get married.

538
00:27:08,524 --> 00:27:11,146
I'm sorry. What did you just...

539
00:27:11,182 --> 00:27:12,830
I know, I know.

540
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:15,319
Not the most romantic proposal in the world.

541
00:27:15,353 --> 00:27:18,313
I shouldn't have led with the teeth cleaning.

542
00:27:18,348 --> 00:27:21,006
I feel I can overlook that.

543
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,360
So is that a yes?

544
00:27:23,397 --> 00:27:25,986
Yes! It's a yes!

545
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,198
Oh!

546
00:27:28,611 --> 00:27:31,740
Wow! What brought this on?

547
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:34,095
It just seemed like the right time.

548
00:27:34,131 --> 00:27:36,249
Oh, Mike.

549
00:27:36,283 --> 00:27:38,268
I'm so happy.

550
00:27:38,303 --> 00:27:40,253
I love you.

551
00:27:49,744 --> 00:27:51,761
I love you, too.

552
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:58,861
I understand taking things,

553
00:27:58,895 --> 00:28:02,125
but why smash something you're gonna leave behind?

554
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,287
They're robbers, dear. Not personal shoppers.

555
00:28:05,324 --> 00:28:07,778
Yeah, well, whoever did this should be shot.

556
00:28:07,813 --> 00:28:10,268
Well, I wonder if the victims of your kleptomania

557
00:28:10,303 --> 00:28:13,431
felt the same way.

558
00:28:13,465 --> 00:28:16,055
You know what? You're absolutely right.

559
00:28:16,091 --> 00:28:18,579
I never realized what my stealing put people through.

560
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:20,229
Maybe this is karma.

561
00:28:20,263 --> 00:28:21,742
What is that?

562
00:28:21,777 --> 00:28:23,358
Oh.

563
00:28:23,392 --> 00:28:27,126
It's a picture of the mask they stole.

564
00:28:27,161 --> 00:28:29,448
I drew it from memory.

565
00:28:29,483 --> 00:28:31,466
Wow.

566
00:28:31,502 --> 00:28:33,789
Hmm. Remember where we got it?

567
00:28:33,823 --> 00:28:35,302
Was it Florence?

568
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:36,649
Venice.

569
00:28:36,683 --> 00:28:39,139
We walked past that little shop under the bridge,

570
00:28:39,173 --> 00:28:40,856
and you saw it in the window.

571
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:42,706
Oh, that's right.

572
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,118
Mm.

573
00:28:44,154 --> 00:28:46,710
You told me you'd been wearing a mask all your life,

574
00:28:46,745 --> 00:28:48,729
but with me, you felt... 

575
00:28:48,764 --> 00:28:51,723
Like I could finally take it off and be myself.

576
00:28:51,758 --> 00:28:53,541
Yeah.

577
00:28:55,729 --> 00:28:58,083
Anyway, I faxed it to the shop in Venice.

578
00:28:58,118 --> 00:29:00,102
They said they could make a new one.

579
00:29:00,137 --> 00:29:02,694
I should have it for you in about a month.

580
00:29:02,728 --> 00:29:05,082
I can't believe you went to all that trouble

581
00:29:05,117 --> 00:29:08,111
then you must not know how much you mean to me.

582
00:29:21,976 --> 00:29:23,824
Hello? Oh, hi, Dave.

583
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:26,315
No, of course not. What's on your mind?

584
00:29:26,349 --> 00:29:29,343
Well, I figured it was time to get back to work,

585
00:29:29,377 --> 00:29:31,868
so I put together a speaking tour... 

586
00:29:31,902 --> 00:29:34,290
Seattle, Portland, my usual route.

587
00:29:34,324 --> 00:29:38,429
Work? Are you sure it's not too soon?
Well, I have to do it eventually.

588
00:29:38,463 --> 00:29:39,943
Anyway, I was hoping

589
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:42,602
you could check in on the house now and then.

590
00:29:42,636 --> 00:29:44,620
Of course.

591
00:29:44,655 --> 00:29:47,682
Oh, someone's at my door. Let me get rid of them.

592
00:29:50,274 --> 00:29:52,259
Hey, Katherine, is Mike here?

593
00:29:52,293 --> 00:29:54,647
No, he's at work. Oh, shoot. Um...

594
00:29:54,682 --> 00:29:58,101
Well, can you tell him to call me as soon as he gets back?

595
00:29:58,102 --> 00:29:58,449
Sure.

596
00:29:59,628 --> 00:30:02,218
Is everything okay?

597
00:30:02,253 --> 00:30:03,632
Uh, well...

598
00:30:05,247 --> 00:30:08,209
Okay, you know what? Mike's probably gonna tell you anyway,

599
00:30:08,243 --> 00:30:10,664
so just can't tell anyone else, okay?

600
00:30:10,699 --> 00:30:13,188
There's not a problem with the wedding, is there?

601
00:30:13,222 --> 00:30:15,376
It's still on, right?

602
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:18,034
It depends.

603
00:30:18,068 --> 00:30:20,423
Jackson and I are only getting married

604
00:30:20,457 --> 00:30:22,307
because he needs his green card.

605
00:30:22,342 --> 00:30:24,426
Oh.

606
00:30:24,462 --> 00:30:27,421
And then I realized that I would lose my alimony.

607
00:30:27,456 --> 00:30:30,282
So unless Mike will keep paying me, I can't get married.

608
00:30:30,316 --> 00:30:32,334
You have to.

609
00:30:32,369 --> 00:30:34,017
I mean, poor Jackson.

610
00:30:34,052 --> 00:30:37,685
I... I would hate to see him deported back to...

611
00:30:37,719 --> 00:30:40,646
where's he from?
Canada.

612
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:44,011
Oh! Oh! Brr! We can't have that!

613
00:30:44,045 --> 00:30:46,283
If you want, I could talk to Mike for you.

614
00:30:46,284 --> 00:30:47,376
That would be great.

615
00:30:47,411 --> 00:30:49,799
Just tell him I need an answer quickly

616
00:30:49,833 --> 00:30:51,817
'cause the wedding is Monday.

617
00:30:51,851 --> 00:30:55,755
Well, don't cancel anything yet. You'll have your answer tonight.

618
00:30:55,789 --> 00:30:57,336
Thanks.

619
00:31:04,975 --> 00:31:07,666
Sorry, Dave.

620
00:31:07,701 --> 00:31:09,047
Dave?

621
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:18,796
Hey.

622
00:31:18,831 --> 00:31:21,309
Hey, Lynette. How's it going?

623
00:31:21,343 --> 00:31:24,297
Oh, my husband wants to spend money we don't have

624
00:31:24,333 --> 00:31:26,743
on a face-lift he doesn't need, so... not great.

625
00:31:26,779 --> 00:31:28,950
Mm, tell him to be careful.

626
00:31:28,985 --> 00:31:31,430
Have you seen Bruce in payroll?

627
00:31:31,466 --> 00:31:34,419
He just went in for a little nip and tuck.

628
00:31:34,453 --> 00:31:36,694
And? How's he look?

629
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,682
Like he's standing in a wind tunnel.

630
00:31:39,718 --> 00:31:41,686
Really?
Mm-hmm.

631
00:31:41,721 --> 00:31:43,147
Poor Bruce.

632
00:31:43,182 --> 00:31:44,743
Yep.

633
00:31:47,224 --> 00:31:48,852
What's his extension?

634
00:31:48,888 --> 00:31:51,977
And I'm thinking I may have acted rashly.

635
00:31:52,011 --> 00:31:55,441
I mean, every marriage has its rough patches.

636
00:31:55,476 --> 00:31:58,430
Orson loves me, and deep down, he's a good man.

637
00:31:58,465 --> 00:32:01,384
If I stick with this, maybe we can make it work.

638
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,388
Are you even listening to me?

639
00:32:03,424 --> 00:32:05,766
Don't need to. Heard it all before.

640
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,056
Oh, really?

641
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,875
I've been doing this 20 years.

642
00:32:09,911 --> 00:32:12,014
And trust me,

643
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:14,052
every woman gets cold feet.

644
00:32:14,088 --> 00:32:17,041
"Am I making a mistake?"

645
00:32:17,076 --> 00:32:19,044
"Was he really that bad?"

646
00:32:19,045 --> 00:32:22,101
"Maybe I could try harder.

647
00:32:22,136 --> 00:32:25,225
And I'm gonna tell you what I tell them... 

648
00:32:25,261 --> 00:32:27,230
you're not making a mistake.

649
00:32:27,265 --> 00:32:29,233
He really is that bad.

650
00:32:29,269 --> 00:32:31,679
And no matter how hard you try,

651
00:32:31,713 --> 00:32:33,682
he's still gonna be the same jerk

652
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:36,705
who sent you into this office in the first place.

653
00:32:36,739 --> 00:32:38,710
Oh. So I'm just like everyone else,

654
00:32:38,744 --> 00:32:40,814
and you know everything I'm going to say.

655
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:42,174
Yep.

656
00:32:42,208 --> 00:32:45,807
I even know the stuff you're not going to say.

657
00:32:45,842 --> 00:32:47,675
I doubt that.

658
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:50,120
Let me give it a shot.

659
00:32:50,155 --> 00:32:52,123
You've been thinking,

660
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,773
"What happens if I walk away from Orson

661
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:58,442
and everything I invested in this relationship?"

662
00:33:01,091 --> 00:33:04,791
"Will I ever find another man?"

663
00:33:07,306 --> 00:33:10,837
Will you spend the rest of your life alone?

664
00:33:13,521 --> 00:33:15,422
Close?

665
00:33:18,174 --> 00:33:20,584
In the ballpark.

666
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,271
Well, you listen to me.

667
00:33:25,307 --> 00:33:27,275
You've got nothing to worry about.

668
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:33,660
You're a beautiful, elegant, classy woman,

669
00:33:33,694 --> 00:33:36,954
and there's no way you're gonna end up alone.

670
00:33:45,615 --> 00:33:48,060
And do you say that to every woman, too?

671
00:33:48,095 --> 00:33:49,589
No.

672
00:33:49,623 --> 00:33:52,101
I mean, I get some real uggos in here.

673
00:33:52,136 --> 00:33:54,615
You know, the kind that are gonna die alone

674
00:33:54,649 --> 00:33:57,909
and get eaten by their cats.

675
00:33:57,943 --> 00:33:59,369
Charming.

676
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:02,901
So are we back in business?

677
00:34:02,936 --> 00:34:06,909
Send me the papers when they're ready.

678
00:34:13,737 --> 00:34:15,739
Honey, I'm glad you're home.

679
00:34:15,775 --> 00:34:18,182
I brought someone me from work I want you to meet.

680
00:34:18,183 --> 00:34:18,796
W... 

681
00:34:18,831 --> 00:34:19,067
Ohh.

682
00:34:19,068 --> 00:34:21,783
Yeah. It turns out he got the same procedure

683
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:24,535
that you're thinking about getting.

684
00:34:24,571 --> 00:34:26,361
So I thought maybe you could chat him up about it.

685
00:34:26,362 --> 00:34:27,694
So you're finally on board with this?

686
00:34:27,729 --> 00:34:29,731
Well, like you said, it's your face.

687
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:33,263
Come on, I'm dying for you to meet Bruce.

688
00:34:37,273 --> 00:34:39,716
Bruce, I want you to meet my husband Tom.

689
00:34:41,585 --> 00:34:45,694
Hi, Tom.

690
00:34:45,729 --> 00:34:49,089
So, um, Lynette tells me

691
00:34:49,125 --> 00:34:52,248
you're thinking about having a little elective surgery.

692
00:34:52,284 --> 00:34:54,829
Did she?
Mm-hmm.

693
00:34:54,864 --> 00:34:58,939
Now you may not be able to tell,

694
00:34:58,974 --> 00:35:01,724
but I've had work done.

695
00:35:01,758 --> 00:35:05,493
Really? Have they finished?

696
00:35:05,529 --> 00:35:08,075
Yeah.

697
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:11,540
Now I should warn you that, uh...

698
00:35:11,574 --> 00:35:14,155
after they operate, it looks a little weird.

699
00:35:14,189 --> 00:35:16,802
Oh, I was wondering about that. Yeah.

700
00:35:16,839 --> 00:35:19,656
But eventually it settles, like this.

701
00:35:19,691 --> 00:35:21,490
Mm.

702
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:31,338
Isn't it exciting, Tom?

703
00:35:31,374 --> 00:35:34,361
In a few weeks, you are gonna look just like Bruce.

704
00:35:36,604 --> 00:35:40,475
Hey, if you want, I'll give you the name of my surgeon.

705
00:35:40,509 --> 00:35:43,973
Yes. I definitely want the name of the guy who did that.

706
00:35:44,007 --> 00:35:46,995
Lynette, um, Bruce looks like he could use something to drink,

707
00:35:47,031 --> 00:35:49,543
and I know that I sure could.

708
00:35:49,578 --> 00:35:52,260
C... could you excuse us for a sec?

709
00:35:55,827 --> 00:35:58,746
Very clever, Lynette... inviting the joker over to scare me.

710
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:01,769
I wanted you to see the face they don't put in the brochure.

711
00:36:01,803 --> 00:36:04,792
I will be having my work done by a reputable surgeon.

712
00:36:04,826 --> 00:36:07,100
Bruce looks like his was done by a bear.

713
00:36:07,136 --> 00:36:09,615
That's my point.

714
00:36:09,649 --> 00:36:11,818
You don't know how these things will turn out.

715
00:36:12,638 --> 00:36:15,626
Well, I am willing to take that risk. I'm doing it.

716
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,766
Why are you being so stubborn?

717
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,973
Why do you care so much?

718
00:36:20,008 --> 00:36:23,674
Because I don't want to have plastic surgery.

719
00:36:23,709 --> 00:36:24,863
What?

720
00:36:24,898 --> 00:36:28,666
Tom, if you're unsatisfied with your looks,

721
00:36:28,702 --> 00:36:32,198
someday you're gonna be unsatisfied with mine.

722
00:36:32,235 --> 00:36:33,591
No.

723
00:36:33,627 --> 00:36:35,188
No.
Yes.

724
00:36:35,222 --> 00:36:38,992
You are going to look at me someday with your brand-new face

725
00:36:39,026 --> 00:36:41,742
and say, "when did she get so old?"

726
00:36:41,777 --> 00:36:45,648
We won't look like we belong together anymore.

727
00:36:45,683 --> 00:36:49,010
Lynette, I'm just talking about gettin' rid of a few wrinkles.

728
00:36:49,045 --> 00:36:51,014
But I don't see your wrinkles, Tom.

729
00:36:51,049 --> 00:36:53,053
I see our whole life together.

730
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:57,060
This...

731
00:36:57,094 --> 00:37:01,712
is you worrying about how you're going to provide for us.

732
00:37:01,747 --> 00:37:04,701
This is Penny falling out of the tree house

733
00:37:04,736 --> 00:37:06,840
and breaking her arm.

734
00:37:06,876 --> 00:37:09,558
This is my cancer.

735
00:37:12,004 --> 00:37:14,482
These are the millions of laughs

736
00:37:14,516 --> 00:37:17,029
that got us through all those tough times.

737
00:37:19,272 --> 00:37:22,056
It's like a map of our marriage,

738
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:24,977
and I don't want to lose it.

739
00:37:25,012 --> 00:37:27,524
And it if keeps me from getting a job?

740
00:37:29,597 --> 00:37:32,380
You're gonna get a job,

741
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:35,301
And it'll be because they're impressed by your experience,

742
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:37,305
not your wrinkle-free face.

743
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:40,939
I know exactly what you mean.

744
00:37:40,973 --> 00:37:43,044
And I love your face, too.

745
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,675
Mmm.

746
00:37:44,709 --> 00:37:46,916
Mmm.

747
00:37:46,951 --> 00:37:49,566
And this wrinkle here, that's when... 

748
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:53,131
This isn't about me, Tom.

749
00:37:53,167 --> 00:37:56,017
Come on. Mwah.

750
00:38:03,151 --> 00:38:04,814
Hey.

751
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:06,376
Good news.

752
00:38:06,411 --> 00:38:08,787
Looks like we're getting fake married after all.

753
00:38:08,823 --> 00:38:11,028
Really?
Yeah.

754
00:38:11,064 --> 00:38:14,256
Mike agreed to keep paying me alimony. He just sent me a text.

755
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:17,142
Oh, man. That's a relief.

756
00:38:17,177 --> 00:38:18,841
And unbelievably generous.

757
00:38:18,876 --> 00:38:22,134
I'm gonna send him a thank-you right now.

758
00:38:25,192 --> 00:38:28,248
You're welcome.

759
00:38:38,741 --> 00:38:41,263
You know, I really can't tell you

760
00:38:41,298 --> 00:38:44,366
how much I appreciate you doing this for me, Susan.

761
00:38:44,401 --> 00:38:46,651
And I promise, as long as I'm here,

762
00:38:46,686 --> 00:38:48,629
I'll pitch in around the house, run errands.

763
00:38:48,664 --> 00:38:50,982
You know, just like a real husband.

764
00:38:51,018 --> 00:38:53,165
Clearly, you've never been married before.

765
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:56,302
Well, you know, just because this is, um...

766
00:38:56,337 --> 00:38:59,303
a fake marriage, doesn't mean it can't be wonderful.

767
00:38:59,338 --> 00:39:02,271
Well, I've been in some real marriages that weren't,

768
00:39:02,305 --> 00:39:05,237
so... maybe you're right.

769
00:39:13,252 --> 00:39:15,877
Oh, look. Cans.

770
00:39:15,913 --> 00:39:18,366
You can't have a wedding without cans and signage!

771
00:39:18,401 --> 00:39:20,242
Sweet!

772
00:39:20,277 --> 00:39:22,723
Let's get to the car wash on our way to the courthouse.

773
00:39:22,724 --> 00:39:23,073
Mm-hmm.

774
00:39:27,882 --> 00:39:29,041
Jackson Braddock?

775
00:39:29,076 --> 00:39:30,132
Yes?

776
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:32,314
We're with immigration.

777
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:34,565
You're in the country on an expired visa.

778
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:37,055
You're gonna have to come with us. - Oh, no, no, no.

779
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:39,919
You... you can't take him now.
Ma'am, I need you to step back.

780
00:39:39,954 --> 00:39:42,170
Susan, there's a business card on the dresser

781
00:39:42,205 --> 00:39:45,000
with an attorney's number. Would you call him for me, please?

782
00:39:45,036 --> 00:39:47,444
Please, can't this wait? We're about to get married.

783
00:39:47,445 --> 00:39:48,444
Not today you're not.

784
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,935
What's going on? Who are these guys? - Uh... immigration agents,

785
00:39:50,969 --> 00:39:52,912
and I think they're...

786
00:39:52,948 --> 00:39:54,924
sending Jackson back to Canada.

787
00:40:22,242 --> 00:40:22,569
Hello?

788
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:25,241
May I speak with, uh, Bree Van de Kamp?

789
00:40:25,277 --> 00:40:28,208
Oh, she's not in at the moment. Can I take a message?

790
00:40:28,243 --> 00:40:30,732
Uh, yeah, this is Sheila with Weston Brothers Storage.

791
00:40:30,767 --> 00:40:32,977
It's about the storage unit she just rented.

792
00:40:32,978 --> 00:40:33,665
Storage unit?

793
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,642
Uh, yeah, we overcharged her on the deposit.

794
00:40:35,677 --> 00:40:37,655
Tell her not to worry.

795
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:39,633
We're gonna deduct it from her next bill.

796
00:40:39,668 --> 00:40:41,611
Okay. Uh, thank you.
You're welcome.

797
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:48,601
Everyone wears some kind of mask,

798
00:40:48,637 --> 00:40:50,614
so you must look closely

799
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:54,365
to find the truth that lies beneath.

800
00:40:55,491 --> 00:40:57,536
Hi. Mwah.

801
00:40:57,572 --> 00:41:02,686
Some conceal anxiety about growing older.

802
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:10,052
Some hide fears of financial ruin.

803
00:41:17,078 --> 00:41:22,500
Others cover up a love that continues to linger.

804
00:41:29,082 --> 00:41:33,344
And then there are those who let their masks slip.

805
00:41:38,324 --> 00:41:40,369
If you look to their eyes,

806
00:41:40,404 --> 00:41:43,745
you'll see who they really are...

807
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:47,866
and exactly what they're capable of.
