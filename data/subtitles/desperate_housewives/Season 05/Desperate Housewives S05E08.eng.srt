1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,360
Previously on Desperate Housewives...

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:03,210
I love you.

3
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:06,020
You're having sex with
your best friend's mother?

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,720
An affair was revealed.

5
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,210
You have to promise me that you won't
say anything to her psycho husband.

6
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,500
A good time was brought to an end.

7
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,200
Back off!

8
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:15,740
Who do you think you're tking to?

9
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,120
We're done here. Good-bye.

10
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,130
And a man's past was uncovered.

11
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:21,470
Look,we're just trying to
get some info on this guy.

12
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,000
He just moved to fairview, and
he's really creeping people out.

13
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:25,090
You're in fairview?

14
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,350
Yeah,why? Does that
mean something to ya?

15
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:38,630
Once a year, the owner
of the white horse bar

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,530
would host a competition known
as the battle of the bands.

17
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,540
Give it up for cold splash.

18
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,150
And young musicians would come...

19
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,920
With their drums...

20
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:59,220
And guitars...

21
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:02,820
And dreams of stardom.

22
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:08,820
This year, those young musicians were
joined by a group of middle-aged men

23
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,440
Who came with their stiff joints...

24
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:15,130
And high cholesterol...

25
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:21,050
And dreams of being young
again, if only for one night.

26
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,630
god,look at those guys.

27
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,510
They'rso young.

28
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,350
No wonder they went first.

29
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,270
They probably have homework.

30
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,330
Would you guys relax?

31
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,950
Rock 'n' roll's not
just for young people.

32
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,560
Why are they so loud?

33
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:36,830
Not helping,carlos.

34
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,280
They're really good, and we're
really old enough to be their fathers.

35
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:45,700
Okay,we may look a little old up there,
and we may hit a few clams, but who cares?

36
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:46,910
We're here to have fun.

37
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,280
Yeah,tonight we're not the plumber and
a masseur and a guy that makes pizzas.

38
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:53,170
We're a rock 'n' roll band.

39
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,200
Right,Dave?

40
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,460
Absolutely.

41
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:59,600
Look,i've gotta check with
the guy about the light cues.

42
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:04,690
You're sure we're not
gonna humiliate ourselves?

43
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,320
I promise you it'll
be a night to remember.

44
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,970
and it was...

45
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:18,720
♪ Mustang sally ♪

46
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:25,470
♪ guess you better slow
your mustang down ...♪

47
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,410
In ways they could never have known.

48
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:39,230
oh,my god! Fire!

49
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,080
It's locked.

53
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:11,300
The next morning, news of
the tragedy began to spread...

54
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:16,890
Along with rumors that the
blaze had been set intentionally.

55
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:22,140
It wasn't long before the police
began using the word "arson"...

56
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:27,250
And someone was taken into custody.

57
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:32,080
The Day Before

58
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:46,210
Look at my little girl.
Isn't she adorable?

59
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,070
Oh,i missed her so much.

60
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,160
Oh,i can't wait to meet her.

61
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,320
Oh,not yet.

62
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,190
I wanna give her new
boyfriend the once-over.

63
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:58,240
He's as cute as she said-- nice
smile, and look at that hair.

64
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,630
Don't you just wanna run
your fingers through it?

65
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,490
Fortunately for you,no.

66
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,960
You know, i'm very good
at first impressions.

67
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,590
I'm gonna like this guy.

68
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:15,120
Why is the cab driver handing
Julie's boyfriend money?

69
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:21,380
Why is Julie's boyfriend
getting back in the cab?

70
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:27,670
And why is the middle-aged
cab driver kissing Julie?

71
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,260
I think what's
goingn is--

72
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,260
i know what's going on.

73
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,960
Let me enjoy my denial.

74
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:39,220
Honey,i'm home.

75
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,910
You wouldn't believe the traffic...

76
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,570
Hello,gabrielle.

77
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,390
Virginia came by to say hello.
Isn't that a nice surprise?

78
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,340
I have news i wanted to share.

79
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,340
You don't seem happy to see me.

80
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,540
Well,maybe that's because
the last time we spoke,

81
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:58,330
You called me a greedy bitch
and i called you a scary old hag.

82
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,880
Weren't we a fine pair of hotheads?

83
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,330
But what family doesn't
have its squabbles?

84
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,220
Family? Lady,you had carlos fired.

85
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:08,200
That was a terrible misunderstanding.

86
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:11,490
And she straightened it
out, and i got my job back.

87
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,950
Isn'tthatnice?

88
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,040
Delightful.

89
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:18,840
Now leave before there's a terrible
misunderstanding between my foot and your ass.

90
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:24,100
Gaby,could i see you
in the kitchen... Now?

91
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:26,860
Save your breath,carlos.

92
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:30,240
There is no way we're letting grandma
screw-loose back into our lives.

93
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,230
She put us in her will.

94
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,100
Oh,my god! That woman is crazy.

95
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:38,000
- Is she crazy or just desperately lonely?
- I don't care.

96
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:40,480
All she wants is
some human contact--

97
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:43,620
To hang out with us on the occasional
weekend, maybe a holiday or two.

98
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:46,920
Right,and in exchange, when she finally
kicks the bucket, we wind up with a lamp.

99
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,270
I'm sorry,carlos.

100
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,550
We're the sole heirs
of her entire fortune.

101
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:58,640
And her blood pressure is 220/90.

102
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:03,800
Virginia! Why can't i stay mad at you?

103
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:09,450
All right,then, we'll see you soon.

104
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,490
The reporter's almost
here. I am so nervous.

105
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,510
Why? You've done lots of interviews.

106
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,220
That w all local. This is
"the new york dispatch."

107
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:22,520
if this goes well,my cookbook could be on
the front page of their weekend style section.

108
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,710
Katherine,what did you do to your hair?

109
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,500
I've never seen it look
so thick and lustrous.

110
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,580
I'm already planning to
say nice things about you.

111
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:35,410
Good. I can check that off my list.

112
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,620
- When's the reporter coming?
- Any minute.

113
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:40,900
Oh,my gosh,andrew. Don't
you look sharp today?

114
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:43,310
Don't worry. I-i
won't tell her i'm gay.

115
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,640
Check and check.

116
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,500
Mom,do you ow anything
about this reporter?

117
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,970
Only that her name is sandra birch.

118
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,800
We just spoke, and she seemed very nice.

119
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:50,600
She isn't.

120
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:55,330
I went online and pulled a bunch of her articles,
and a lot of them are complete hatchet jobs.

121
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:58,290
"a deeper look suggests something
darker,something more ominous,

122
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:04,190
A woman whose perky surface conceals a
deep,almost demonic thirst for power."

123
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,330
I doubt betty white saw that coming.

124
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:09,210
Mom,if this woman tanks you,
i could kill sales of the book.

125
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,860
You're gonna have to figure
out a way to handlthis.

126
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:14,400
Knock,knock?

127
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:16,940
I'm looking for Bree.

128
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,040
You must be sandra.

129
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:25,230
What a sharp outfit.

130
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,630
And look at that hair--
So thick and lustrous.

131
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,470
Mom, you got a minute?

132
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,780
I do.

133
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:45,770
Why do i have a sense you're
gonna take it away from me?

134
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,360
Porter got anne schilling pregnant.

135
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:55,500
Mom,are you okay?

136
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:59,240
Oh,yeah,i'm great. That it?

137
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:03,530
No. There's more. They're
planning to run away.

138
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:08,480
Okay. Well,your minute's up.

139
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:12,830
Aren't you gonna go talk to him?

140
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:18,090
No,i have to talk to someone else first.

141
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,410
Remember when you left that
soda can on the coffee table,

142
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,710
And it left a ring, and i yelled at you?

143
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:32,360
I take it all back.

144
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:40,750
And we always sell out, so i
want the band there by 6:00.

145
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,930
- Any questions?
- Sounds good.

146
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,960
- When are we on?
- Second.

147
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:47,710
You got the primo spot
as a favor to my wife.

148
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,350
Since she rented you the space,
she feels like part of the band.

149
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,380
Well,rock on,anne schilling.

150
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:55,140
If she requests "free
bird," we're doing it.

151
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,870
Hey,uh,tom,i saw porter
at my house the other day.

152
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:04,540
Yeah,he and kirby were shooting hoops.

153
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:07,840
- I can't believe how big he's getting.
- Yeah.

154
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:10,710
They grow up fast,huh?

155
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,140
- Yeah. Little too fast.
- Yeah.

156
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,930
uh,hey,doc, i know i
owe you a phone call.

157
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:28,510
I'm gonna cut to the chase, Dave.

158
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,760
Are you in fairview?

159
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,910
What? Where did that come from?

160
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,970
Doesn't matter where it came from.

161
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,980
Are you in fairview?

162
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:43,520
Look,i don't know what brought this
on, but i'm really busy right now.

163
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:46,450
I'll call you tomorrow. I promise.
And we can talk about it then.

164
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,930
Okay? Bye.

165
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:57,260
Excuse me.

166
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:03,770
So they were,huddled under this broken
umbrella, and... He just kissed me.

167
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,630
It was so romantic.

168
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,260
She's skipping the part where one
of the spokes got me in the eye.

169
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:12,780
Julie,i'm gonna take your
suitcases upstairs now,okay?

170
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:15,790
Oh,i'll come with you. I
need to check my e-mail.

171
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,340
Be right back.

172
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,230
So,Susan,i'm...

173
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,610
I'm sensing that,uh, you're a
little freaked out about my age.

174
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:37,660
You know,when your 24-year-old daughter calls you
and tells you she's bringing home a boy from college,

175
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:42,300
You sort of expect it
to be,well... A boy.

176
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:48,980
Well,i just want you to know that we didn't
srt dating until after the semester was over.

177
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,900
I don't date students.
That's--that's a rule with me.

178
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,730
And a damn good one.

179
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:59,060
Although strictly speaking, i suppose
my third wife wasmy teaching assistant,

180
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,190
But she was really more of
my employee than my student.

181
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,320
Your what?

182
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,200
- Student.
- Before that.

183
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:08,380
- Employee.
- Beforethat.

184
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:11,400
- Third wife.
- That's the one.

185
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,200
So you've been married three times?

186
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,290
Didn't Julie tell you that?

187
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,810
I don't believe so.

188
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:22,140
Although i may have blacked out
after she told me you were 40.

189
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:25,930
So how does a man your age get
married and divorced three times?

190
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,230
Well,my first wife and i were
only married a few months,

191
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,380
So i-i almost don't like to count it.

192
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:32,630
- Did someone throw rice at you?
- Yeah.

193
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,050
It counts.

194
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,990
Is this upsetting you? I-i
thought you'd understand.

195
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,530
Julie said you'd been divorced yourself.

196
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,280
Yeah. Only twice.

197
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:44,340
Two. Small number.
Much smaller than three.

198
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:47,240
And my first cheated on me,
so that doesn't even count.

199
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,240
- Did someone throw rice at you?
- Shut up.

200
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:53,160
Look,you and i both know that
sometimes it just doesn't work out.

201
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:58,520
Well... That's true.

202
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:02,610
And besides,it--it's different
with Julie. I love her so much.

203
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:06,470
It's very important that you know
i take my commitments seriously.

204
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,890
Why?

205
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,240
Oh,my god.

206
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:14,370
Lloyd,come here. I can't
find my cell phone charger.

207
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,900
Please,please, don't say anything.

208
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:19,020
I want it to be a surprise.

209
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:23,040
Thanks... Mom.

210
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,920
And this is my own little kitchen.

211
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,410
I'm pretty sure my
husband's here somewhere.

212
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,730
Orson,dear, are you decent?

213
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,920
In here,love.

214
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,930
Nice to meet you.

215
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,860
I've had the most delightful
time with your wife and stepson.

216
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,230
Your home is stunning.

217
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,850
You cannot run a business
and do all this,too.

218
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,280
Tell me you have a housekeeper.

219
00:12:56,290 --> 00:13:00,820
Why would i y someone to do
work that gives me such joy?

220
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:04,190
Now who wants a little snack?

221
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:10,900
Bree,the idea was for me to
spend atypicalday with you.

222
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:13,610
So this is legit?

223
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,810
You're really this donna
reed housewife from the '50s?

224
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,660
You say that like it's a bad thing.

225
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:21,000
I think that decade had
a lot to recommend it.

226
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:26,370
Mm, people had values then-- values
this family strives to uphold.

227
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:29,960
But not everyone can keep a
perfect house for a perfect family

228
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:33,050
with perfect food and perfect flowers.

229
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,360
Of course they can...

230
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,350
If they read my book,that is.

231
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,790
Okay,truth be told...

232
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,130
I'm far from perfect.

233
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:46,810
Only yesterday,i burned
a whole tray of biscotti.

234
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,400
And to think,i was worried
about finding a lead.

235
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,930
Andrew,please. The machine can get it.

236
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,910
We never answer the
phone while entertaining.

237
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,040
So rude to one's guests.

238
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:03,680
Now,um,may i pour you some more tea?

239
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,110
This is mr. Jones for Orson Hodge.

240
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,380
Due to vacation schedules, i'll be
filling in for your parole officer.

241
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,560
Give me a call,please.

242
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:21,240
So,mr. Hodge... You've been to prison.

243
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:25,330
Nowcan i be gay?

244
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,640
Kirby,is that you?

245
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:35,740
I thought you went to the movies.

246
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,960
Are you really pregnant?

247
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:50,320
Yes.

248
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:56,970
A couple of months back, warren and i...

249
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,870
W-we fought.

250
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:04,410
I was pretty banged
up, and--and...

251
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:09,270
Porter came by looking
for kirby, and--and...

252
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:14,460
He was so... Kind and...

253
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:17,540
- And gentle.
- Don't.

254
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:22,050
Don't try and justify
this. This is sick.

255
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:25,550
You are sick.

256
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:33,850
Your son... Loves me.

257
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:38,820
And--and
i love him.

258
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:42,130
And--and--and
you know what?

259
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:46,980
I'm glad i'm having porter's baby.

260
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,160
Damn.

261
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:58,380
Not exactly what a husband
wants to hear coming in the door.

262
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:02,060
I suppose dinner's not ready,either.

263
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:07,140
Warren,i'm
sorry that--

264
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:09,200
thank you.

265
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:14,380
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

266
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,460
Don't go.

267
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:19,560
I need to talk with my wife right now.

268
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:23,440
I'm sorry for any pain this has
caused your family, mrs. Scavo.

269
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,580
Damn it.

270
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,910
You think you can humiliate
me? You piece of filth!

271
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,420
Get off of her! Get off of
her! I'm calling the police!

272
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:54,780
Stay out of this!

273
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:06,540
Okay,well,just so you know, i hit back.

274
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:08,660
Call the police.

275
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:12,760
I'd love to hear her explain
her way out of statutory rape.

276
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:17,230
You don't live here anymore.

277
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,790
Oh,my god! Oh,my god!

278
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,710
Thank you for coming back.

279
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:42,360
Here we are,boys! Are
you psyched or what?

280
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:45,340
Oh,i feel like i'm gonna puke again.

281
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,710
You guys cold splash?

282
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,610
- Yes,sir.
- "sir"?

283
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,500
We're blue odyssey.

284
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,890
Yeah,i can see that.

285
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:01,560
Uh,so after the gig, we're having
a party at our manager's loft.

286
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:02,410
You guys should come.

287
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,800
Abso-tively.

288
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:07,360
We just gotta check with our wives.

289
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,400
Why were you talking to that woman?

290
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:32,590
She just walked up and asked if we knew
you, wanted us to confirm a bunch of rumors.

291
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,570
What kind of rumors?

292
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,550
Just... Stuff she'd heard
around the neighborhood.

293
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,820
- Were you really a boozehound?
- Lee...

294
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,470
No,i'm just saying,i wish
i'd have known you then.

295
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,170
We'd have been such good friends.

296
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,530
She seemed to know an
awful lot about you.

297
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,990
Key
word--"awful."

298
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,610
I cannot let this happen.
I have to find her.

299
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,740
Well,she's gonna be at the
battle of the bands tonight.

300
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,460
Why?

301
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:58,960
She wants to hear Orson, and i quote, "sing
harmony with the guy he tried to kill."

302
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:03,800
Oh,dear god. This woman is determined to make my
life sound ten times worse than it actually is.

303
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:08,560
Yeah. So was your first husband
really into s and m hookers?

304
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,740
And you wonder why we're
never invited anywhere.

305
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:20,670
Okay,girls, mommy's leaving. I love you!

306
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,570
I'm planning on having a
massive hangover tomorrow,

307
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:25,990
so keep the girls up late
so we can all sleep in.

308
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,960
My,don't you look festive.

309
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,540
Virginia.

310
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,880
What are you doing here?

311
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:44,020
What do you mean? We're going
to watch carlos' band play.

312
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:46,660
You invited me this morning, remember?

313
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:51,390
No,uh,what i remember was you
asking me to the movies tonight,

314
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:56,330
And me saying i couldn't because i
was going to watch carlos' band play.

315
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,030
You got invitation out of that?

316
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,220
Well,i'm here now,dear,
and i have this lovely limo.

317
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:03,570
So come on. We'll ride
over to the club in style.

318
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:06,420
Well,here's the thing. I'm
supposed to go with my girlfriends.

319
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:10,400
Oh,Gaby,please,i was so
looking forwardo this.

320
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:13,420
Don't make me go all alone.

321
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,840
Well,i guess we're all
going to the same place.

322
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,690
I'll just see my friends there.

323
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,190
Oh,goody!

324
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,370
Dr. Smith to cardiac i.c.u.

325
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:29,070
- Where's anne?
- She's asleep. She's fine.

326
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:29,940
What happened?

327
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:33,170
I went over to talk to anne
about recent developments.

328
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,260
You went to her house?

329
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:36,690
Yes,i did,porter. I had to talk to anne.

330
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:41,000
I didn't know that her husband was
there, and he overheard us and...

331
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,810
The doctors say she's gonna be fine.

332
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:50,500
Porter,wh-- where are
you going? Damn it!

333
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:56,380
"tonic water,bourbon,ketchup."
This is your grocery list?

334
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:59,330
There's got to be something else on
Dave's phone bill that will lp us.

335
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,780
Uh,there isn't.

336
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:05,350
Oh,don't get broccoli.
It isnotyour friend.

337
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,210
You're telling me that you cross-checked all
those other numbers, and there was nothing?

338
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,440
Squat.

339
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:12,430
- The key is this doctor guy.
- Yeah.

340
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,310
Maybe we should just bite
the bullet and go to boston.

341
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:19,610
Yeah. Maybe we can get more
out of him face-to-face.

342
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:32,350
Hey,you wanna go to a rock show tonight?

343
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,900
Me? With you?

344
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:38,990
Well,i'm a little out of your league,
but if it'll get you there, sure.

345
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,850
I don't think i can, but thanks.

346
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:44,360
Here,in case you change your mind.

347
00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:00,590
and then I noticed that maria's
pockets were stuffed with silverware.

348
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:04,380
I'm telling you,it's impossible
to find good help these days.

349
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,750
Well,you'll know soon enough when my
cholesterol finally
gets the better of me.

350
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,960
Don't talk like that.

351
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,300
You want a cheeseburger or something?

352
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,210
That has got to stop.

353
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,330
I'm gonna do something.

354
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,240
Why?

355
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,610
Julie's a grown woman.

356
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:29,280
Uh-huh,she's a grown woman with stars in
her eyes who's in love with a 3-time loser.

357
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,480
If she wants to accept his
proposal,that's her business.

358
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:37,820
But in the meantime,you're
not gonna ruin his surprise.

359
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,680
En't I?

360
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:39,370
No.

361
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:40,050
Aren't I?

362
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,860
No.

363
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,140
you're right.

364
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:52,230
I'll stay out of it.

365
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:59,200
Oh,now where is the little girls' room?

366
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,680
Hey,why did that guy hand you a cd?

367
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,130
Your name isn't julie,is it?

368
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,760
No. Why?

369
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,140
Well,there's a song on
there he wants me to play.

370
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:10,340
I guess he's gonna propose to
his girlfriend or something.

371
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,900
Tonight?!

372
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,740
isn't that lovely?

373
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:24,270
whoa,oh julie,julie,julie,do
you love me?

374
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:29,970
Julie,julie,julie,do you care?

375
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:35,560
Julie,julie,are you thinking of me?

376
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,440
Hey,you two.

377
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,120
What's going on?

378
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:41,490
Um,nothing.

379
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,100
What's going on with you?

380
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:46,420
Oh,I just love this song.

381
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:50,050
and jackson doesn't like to dance,so...

382
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:53,540
isn't this fun?

383
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:54,490
It was.

384
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:58,030
Oh,reminds me of being young and single.

385
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,300
Oh,I wish I'd never given up that.

386
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:01,290
yeah,susan.

387
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:04,130
Listen,uh,I don't want
to,uh,uh,sound rude or anything,

388
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:07,600
but this is really a-a
moment that's meant for two.

389
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:09,720
Right! Right.

390
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:15,520
You mind easing away so i
can dance with my dauter?

391
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:18,710
mm,susan?

392
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,020
What are you doing?

393
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:23,170
I'M... just movin' to the music.

394
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:24,570
Mm,yeah.

395
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,670
You're coming with me.

396
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:28,020
Uh,no. No. No,no. No!

397
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,910
Oh,all right!

398
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,970
But no matter what he asks
you,promise me you'll say "no."

399
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:34,370
Susan!

400
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:35,510
lloyd,I'm sorry.

401
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:39,140
I can't help i I don't want my
daughter to be someone's fourth wife.

402
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,580
Wife?

403
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,430
Were you gonna ask me to marry you?

404
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:45,520
Oh,uh,were we not clear on that by now?

405
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,440
You can't be serious.

406
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:47,780
We've only been dating three months.

407
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:51,210
Well,yes,I know,but I have
such a good feeling about us.

408
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:54,430
Right,better feelings than you
had about wives one,two and three?

409
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,890
Mom.

410
00:24:56,770 --> 00:25:00,690
You are very sweet,but
I'm not getting married...

411
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:01,640
ever.

412
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:02,500
"Ever"?

413
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,240
W-what do you mean "ever"?

414
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:05,620
We'll talk about this later.

415
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:08,950
I just really need a moment to myself.

416
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:19,870
Thank you.

417
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:24,220
Bree,darling.

418
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,660
Spare me your "darling," sandra.

419
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,850
I know you've been trying
to dig up dirt on me.

420
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:32,320
Mm,just doing my job.

421
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:35,300
And frankly,I didn't
have to dig all that hard.

422
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:40,670
I wrote a cookbook,sandra--
meatloaf,pot pies,peach cobbler.

423
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,420
Why are you trying to crucify me?

424
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:44,890
Because it's not a cookbook,bree.

425
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,040
It's a "look how great I am" book¡ª

426
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:51,760
one designed to make every woman who reads it
feel like a failure if she doesn't measure up.

427
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:54,240
What you're selling's a total sham.

428
00:25:54,550 --> 00:26:00,140
But it isn't,sandra,because
I don't think I'm great.

429
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:03,320
I have fallen down more
times than I can count,

430
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,530
just like so many other
housewives out there.

431
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:10,440
We're all just barely holding
on,and we all think that we're alone.

432
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,760
So maybe you're right.

433
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,610
Maybe it isn't a cookbook.

434
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:16,270
It's a lifeline from
me to those other women,

435
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:21,910
because I want them to know there's
always a chance to get something right...

436
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:25,030
even if it's just a casserole.

437
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:31,560
Why didn't you just tell
me that right up front,bree?

438
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,430
That's an angle I can work with.

439
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:38,620
I got some good news today.

440
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:41,520
I've been speaking with the headmaster
at greenbrier country day school,

441
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:43,610
and I got them to reserve
two spots for the girls.

442
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,490
They start next term.

443
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,840
Well,thanks,but the girls
already have a school.

444
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:49,250
Yes,I know--a
public school.

445
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:50,640
This is a good school.

446
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:52,290
Virginia,they're happy where they are.

447
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:53,650
They love fairview.

448
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:55,720
Besides,greenbrier's,like,an hour away.

449
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,810
So i'll get them a drir.

450
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,160
That would be a real treat for them.

451
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,240
No,I want them to be close by.

452
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:03,710
They could need me during the
school day-- get sick or something.

453
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:06,120
Oh,that's what school nurses are for.

454
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,870
Dear,this is a decision I
feel very strongly about.

455
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,620
I'm afraid I have to insist.

456
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,100
Excuse me.

457
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:17,450
You don't get to insist on anything
when it comes to my daughters.

458
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:21,360
I think,given the extent of my investment
in this family,I should have some say.

459
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,530
I'll just give you some
time to think about it.

460
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:26,660
I don't need any time to think about it.

461
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,760
Keep your money.

462
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,770
Now you're being reckless.

463
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:30,830
You know something?

464
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:31,660
I like money.

465
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:32,880
I like it a lot.

466
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:36,320
And a couple years ago,you could've
bought me with that big fortune of yours.

467
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:41,200
But I'm a mom now,and i make
the decisions for my kids.

468
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:44,210
And that is something
that cannot be bought.

469
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,690
Gaby,I can make a decision,too.

470
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,540
I can call my lawyer tomorrow
morning and take you out of my will.

471
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:52,090
And that is your right
as a crazy old rich lady.

472
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,910
thank you.

473
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:11,270
Screening your calls now,dave?

474
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,620
Let me guess.

475
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:25,040
You can explain everything.

476
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:35,890
I'm really,really sorry,doc.

477
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,850
You changed your name
and didn't tell me.

478
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:46,360
You're living in fairview-- the
one place you swore you wouldn't go.

479
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:49,930
I didn't change my name to be deceptive.

480
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,530
I just wanted a fresh start.

481
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,490
Fairview is not a fresh start for you.

482
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:58,910
My wife edie-- she's from here,and she
really wanted to move back,and I said okay.

483
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,980
Did you tell her your history?

484
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:08,880
Did you tell her why it's
not healthy-- or safe.

485
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,870
For you to be here?

486
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:16,660
She knows everything,and I'm in
a really good place right now.

487
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:20,720
But...can we talk about
this after the show?

488
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:29,290
These guys...they're my
friends,and they're depending on me.

489
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:33,860
The moment you're finished playing.

490
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,710
let's start this year's battle
of the bands with our first group.

491
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:44,460
Give it up for cold splash!

492
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:02,230
spare me the apology for butting
into my life for the millionth time.

493
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:05,120
What is this about you
never getting married?

494
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,380
Why would I?

495
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:10,190
If there's one thing I've learned from
your experience,marriage is a joke.

496
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,110
Hey,I believe in marriage.

497
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:13,590
Why?

498
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:17,950
First there was dad,who left you
for his secretary,and then mike...

499
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:20,520
he was the love of your
life,and it still went to hell.

500
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:23,380
I mean,honestly...

501
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,660
just tell me what the upside is.

502
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:28,220
Oh,julie,you're way too
young to be this cynical.

503
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,340
I am not cynical.

504
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,690
I'm realistic.

505
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:37,800
I'M...I'm just trying to protect myself.

506
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:43,240
Well,putting a wall around
your heart doesn't protect you.

507
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,640
It just keeps people out.

508
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:47,680
I learned that the hard way.

509
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:50,960
Now with jackson...

510
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:54,740
I remember that I like feeling hopeful.

511
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:58,400
I like believing in
"happily ever after."

512
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,500
I really wish that
you felt that way,too.

513
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:19,550
sorry about the tip,but
I just lost $50 million.

514
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,190
Gaby,have you seen porter?

515
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:26,950
No,I haven'T.

516
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,320
Why? Is he supposed to be here?

517
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:31,960
No. So if you see him,please tell me.

518
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,500
Thanks.

519
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:53,780
yeah,come on. Tonight,we're not a plumr
and a masseur and a guy that makes pizzas.

520
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:55,700
We're a rock 'n' roll band.

521
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:57,020
Right,dave?

522
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,020
Absolutely.

523
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:04,030
Look,I'm gonna check with
the guy about the light cues.

524
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:06,590
Hey,doc.

525
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:09,210
He's in your band?!

526
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,690
I know.

527
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,140
It sounds crazy,but we've
worked through everything.

528
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:14,840
It's cool.

529
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:17,490
No. This is too dangerous.

530
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:19,280
I need to speak to him right now.

531
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:22,040
C,you just have trust
me on this one,okay?

532
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,610
Now,dave.

533
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,380
I speak to him right now...

534
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:28,940
or I call the police.

535
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:35,880
okay.You win.

536
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,050
Come on.

537
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:47,440
I hope you realize I'm only doing
this because I want to help you.

538
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:51,470
I genuinely care about you,dave.

539
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,940
I know you do,dr. Heller.

540
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,430
And I like you.

541
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,800
actually,I like you a lot.

542
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,680
I'm sorry.

543
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:56,860
a bit about yourself?

544
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:02,970
I know this is gonna sound crazy,but
I can actually smell our fear.

545
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,450
If I could see wherethe
exits are,I'd run for 'em.

546
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:08,100
I can't believe we let
dave talk us into this.

547
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,940
By the way,where is dave?

548
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,520
hey,jackson.Where are you going?

549
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,240
- The guys are about to start.
- Uh,bathroom.

550
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:33,140
Back in a sec.Oh, the men's room's packed,
but there's an employee bathroom back there.

551
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,870
Thank you.

552
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,120
hey,dave,is that the bathroom?

553
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,400
No. I think that's it there.

554
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,360
Okay.Thanks.

555
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:06,200
We're up.

556
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:07,490
Where the hell is dave?

557
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,170
Sorry.

558
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,600
we thought you ditched
us.Where were you?

559
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,340
Needed a little liquid courage.

560
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,380
Come on,boys.Let's do it.

00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:14,360

You've been running all over
town hitting women and children?

573
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,310
You must be so proud.

574
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,460
Lock that door.

575
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,780
What were you thinking?

576
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:22,560
You could've gotten hurt in there!

577
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,910
You are responsible for this.

578
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:26,840
Whatever happens is your fault.

579
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:35,810

00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:08,500
No.

600
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,600
Eh,it was worth a shot.

601
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,450
it's locked.

602
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:18,700
Look out!

603
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:27,870
- Come on.
- No,I gotta make sure everyone gets out of here.

604
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,550
Go! Go!

605
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,510
don't push!

606
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:35,750
One at a time!

607
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:36,640
Jackson!

608
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:38,620

610
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:41,120
Jackson--he's
still in there.

611
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,410
He's in the bathroom.

612
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:43,950

613
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:45,730

jackson.Thank god.

618
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:39,420
Where's mike?

619
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,070
I don't know.I didn't see him.

620
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:44,070
is he still in there?

621
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:45,380
Yeah!He went in there to find you.

622
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:48,030
What?Mike? Mike's still in there?

623
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:49,820
Dave,no!

624
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:55,920
Mike!

625
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:57,320
Mike!

626
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,530
Mom!Dad.

627
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,170
Porter,I told you to go home.

628
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,010
What are you doing here?

629
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:07,620
You!

630
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:08,420
You son of a bitch!

631
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:09,590
You did this!

632
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:10,610
What are you talking about?

633
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:11,360
Stay away from my kid!

634
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:14,940
Your kid burned down my club.

635
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:22,260
Susan,do you think he's still in there?

636
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,110
I didn't see him.

637
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:27,690
Look,my husband's still inside.

638
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:29,280
You've gotta go back in there!

639
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,860
I'm sorry.That roof
is about to collapse.

640
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:32,370
Now please get back.

641
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:36,840
Someone's coming!

642
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:49,540
hang in there.

643
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:51,340
I'm not done with you yet.

644
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:59,930
There was a fire last night in fairview.

645
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:06,040
Ifou open up your morning paper,you
can read about those who survived...

646
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:10,180
and those who were injured...

647
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:15,540
those who barely escaped
with their lives...

648
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:20,090
and those who didn'T.

649
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:29,200
You can also read about a man who
risked his life to rescue his neighbor.

650
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:34,840
What you won't read about are
the reasons for this bravery.

651
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,010
You're the one who pulled
that guy out of the fire.

652
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,110
Can I interview you?

653
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,630
and that's because...

654
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:44,650
no one ever doubts...a hero.
