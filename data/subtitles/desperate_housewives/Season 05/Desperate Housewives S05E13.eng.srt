00:00:01,516 --> 00:00:03,484
<i> Eli Scruggs</i>

2
00:00:03,518 --> 00:00:07,488
<i>was the handiest
of all handymen.</i>

3
00:00:07,522 --> 00:00:10,007
<i>You could ask any
of his customers,</i>

4
00:00:10,024 --> 00:00:11,992
<i>and they would tell you,</i>

5
00:00:12,026 --> 00:00:15,429
<i>there was nothing
he couldn't fix.</i>

6
00:00:17,165 --> 00:00:20,234
<i>Whether it was a broken vase...</i>

7
00:00:20,268 --> 00:00:24,705
<i>a leaky pipe...</i>

8
00:00:24,739 --> 00:00:27,407
<i>or a shaky banister,</i>

9
00:00:27,442 --> 00:00:31,879
<i>Eli always knew
how to get the job done.</i>

10
00:00:31,913 --> 00:00:33,680
<i>But sadly,</i>

11
00:00:33,715 --> 00:00:36,183
<i>the man who had fixed
so many things</i>

12
00:00:36,217 --> 00:00:38,752
<i>for the residents
of Wisteria Lane</i>

13
00:00:38,786 --> 00:00:40,654
<i>was now about</i>

14
00:00:40,688 --> 00:00:42,956
<i>to break their hearts.</i>

15
00:00:42,991 --> 00:00:45,225
Eli Scruggs,
get down from there!

16
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,261
Mrs. McCluskey.

17
00:00:47,295 --> 00:00:49,663
Just found this note
in my mailbox.

18
00:00:49,697 --> 00:00:51,665
Says you're retiring?
What the hell?

19
00:00:51,699 --> 00:00:54,001
Yes, ma'am. It's true.

20
00:00:54,035 --> 00:00:56,603
Now why would you want to do
something stupid like that?

21
00:00:56,638 --> 00:00:58,605
My doc says
I got a bum ticker,

22
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,074
have to take it easy
from now on.

23
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:03,310
Well, once I'm done fixing
Mrs. Mayer's shingles,

24
00:01:03,344 --> 00:01:06,280
I'm on a plane to Waikiki.
- Well, this is very annoying.

25
00:01:06,314 --> 00:01:09,550
Who's gonna fix my water heater
when it breaks?

26
00:01:09,584 --> 00:01:12,519
Oh, I met this young guy
named Toby.

27
00:01:12,554 --> 00:01:15,522
Very bright, just turned 30.
He'll take care of you.

28
00:01:15,557 --> 00:01:17,024
Ah, damn it, Eli!

29
00:01:17,058 --> 00:01:19,526
I am not comfortable
with strangers in my house.

30
00:01:19,561 --> 00:01:23,463
<i>Took me ten years to trust you.
- I know.</i>

31
00:01:23,498 --> 00:01:26,767
Most of those guys leave tools
and nails all over the place.

32
00:01:26,801 --> 00:01:28,769
You never leave a mess.

33
00:01:28,803 --> 00:01:30,537
Thank you, ma'am.

34
00:01:30,572 --> 00:01:32,906
Have you told everyone else
you're leaving?

35
00:01:32,941 --> 00:01:36,043
I left copies of that same note
in everybody's mailbox.

36
00:01:36,077 --> 00:01:37,778
Well, that's not right.

37
00:01:37,812 --> 00:01:40,547
After all these years, people
will want to say good-bye,

38
00:01:40,582 --> 00:01:43,417
and... you know, maybe throw you
a party or somethin'.

39
00:01:43,451 --> 00:01:46,386
Oh, no. I prefer to go quietly,
if you know what I mean.

40
00:01:46,421 --> 00:01:48,388
I don't want a big fuss.

41
00:01:48,423 --> 00:01:52,025
Well, I'll miss you, Eli.

42
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,561
There will never be
another one like you.

43
00:01:57,198 --> 00:02:00,667
<i>With that Eli Scruggs
climbed his ladder</i>

44
00:02:00,702 --> 00:02:03,604
<i>for the very last time.</i>

45
00:02:03,638 --> 00:02:07,641
<i>And once he had finished
making his last repair,</i>

46
00:02:07,675 --> 00:02:12,546
<i>Eli Scruggs--
quietly, with no fuss--</i>

47
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:16,216
<i>had a heart attack and died.</i>

48
00:02:18,286 --> 00:02:21,488
<i>And most importantly...</i>

49
00:02:21,522 --> 00:02:25,125
<i>without leaving a mess.</i>

50
00:02:36,237 --> 00:02:39,773
<i>It took an hour
for someone to finally notice</i>

51
00:02:39,807 --> 00:02:43,944
<i>the body laying atop
Susan Mayer's roof.</i>

52
00:02:46,481 --> 00:02:48,382
Aah!

53
00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:53,520
<i>It was
less than ten minutes later</i>

54
00:02:53,554 --> 00:02:56,890
<i>that the neighbors
began arriving,</i>

55
00:02:56,924 --> 00:02:58,825
<i>each determined to get a look</i>

56
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,962
<i>at the various paramedics
and policemen</i>

57
00:03:01,996 --> 00:03:04,464
<i>who were all frantically
trying to figure out</i>

58
00:03:04,499 --> 00:03:07,834
<i>exactly how
to bring the body down.</i>

59
00:03:12,206 --> 00:03:16,309
<i>And it took two days
for my friends to realize</i>

60
00:03:16,344 --> 00:03:19,680
<i>this tragedy
had affected them...</i>

61
00:03:19,714 --> 00:03:22,282
We're ready! Come on.

62
00:03:22,316 --> 00:03:26,553
<i>more than
they were willing to admit.</i>

63
00:03:26,587 --> 00:03:28,922
Hey, Gaby, did you remember
to get change?

64
00:03:28,956 --> 00:03:31,925
'Cause when I cash in my chips,
I don't want to hear you say,

65
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:34,828
"all I've got is $50s."
- Speaking of cashing in your chips,

66
00:03:34,862 --> 00:03:37,664
anyone know when Eli's funeral is?
- Oh, I think it's Saturday.

67
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:41,034
I wonder how many people
are gonna show up.

68
00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:42,803
Mrs. McCluskey was saying
he didn't have much family.

69
00:03:42,804 --> 00:03:44,538
Poor Eli. We should make sure
he's got flowers at his funeral.

70
00:03:44,572 --> 00:03:47,040
I'm in.
- How much are we talking?

71
00:03:47,075 --> 00:03:49,543
I don't know.
What do you think, Gaby?

72
00:03:49,577 --> 00:03:50,777
Gaby?

73
00:04:01,622 --> 00:04:04,224
Wow! Jimmy Choo!

74
00:04:05,393 --> 00:04:07,394
Oh, Carlos!

75
00:04:07,395 --> 00:04:09,396
These aren't even
in the states yet.

76
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,932
What's the catch?

77
00:04:11,966 --> 00:04:14,067
What are you talking about?

78
00:04:14,102 --> 00:04:16,069
You never buy me a present

79
00:04:16,104 --> 00:04:18,071
unless I'm mad
or about to be mad.

80
00:04:18,106 --> 00:04:20,240
And I don't think I am,
so why am I about to be?

81
00:04:20,274 --> 00:04:22,743
I have to go to Cleveland tomorrow.
- Carlos!

82
00:04:22,777 --> 00:04:24,445
They're begging me.
The merger's going south.

83
00:04:24,446 --> 00:04:26,113
You just got home!

84
00:04:26,147 --> 00:04:28,215
With shoes.

85
00:04:28,249 --> 00:04:32,085
Don't leave me here.
I'm going out of my mind.

86
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,654
Everyone is so boring
and suburban.

87
00:04:34,689 --> 00:04:36,890
And how many
freakin' honor students

88
00:04:36,924 --> 00:04:38,792
can that school have?

89
00:04:38,826 --> 00:04:40,827
Can we please not argue
in front of the handyman?

90
00:04:40,828 --> 00:04:42,829
He has a name.

91
00:04:42,864 --> 00:04:45,332
What's your name?

92
00:04:45,366 --> 00:04:46,933
Eli Scruggs.

93
00:04:46,968 --> 00:04:48,602
You hear that, Carlos?

94
00:04:48,636 --> 00:04:50,604
You've brought me to a place

95
00:04:50,638 --> 00:04:53,306
where people are named
"Eli Scruggs."

96
00:04:53,341 --> 00:04:55,308
Fine.
I'll give up my job...

97
00:04:55,343 --> 00:04:57,444
and everything
that comes with it.

98
00:04:57,478 --> 00:04:59,146
<i>Not the Jimmy Choos.</i>

99
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,148
They're the only friends
I've got.

100
00:05:01,182 --> 00:05:02,883
Thought so.

101
00:05:02,917 --> 00:05:04,584
I'm going to pack.

102
00:05:07,855 --> 00:05:09,923
You know,
it's none of my business...

103
00:05:09,957 --> 00:05:11,591
You're right. It's not.

104
00:05:11,626 --> 00:05:14,261
But the ladies
in this neighborhood

105
00:05:14,295 --> 00:05:17,264
are actually pretty nice.
- Yeah. They came by, brought muffins.

106
00:05:17,298 --> 00:05:19,466
One of 'em
wants her basket back.

107
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,501
That'd be Bree.

108
00:05:21,536 --> 00:05:23,503
Anyhow,
she and the other ladies, uh,

109
00:05:23,538 --> 00:05:25,305
play poker every week.

110
00:05:25,339 --> 00:05:27,307
If you'd like,
I could talk to 'em,

111
00:05:27,341 --> 00:05:30,343
<i>see if they'll let you
host a game.</i>

112
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:39,085
Hi. We're, um...
the neighborhood.

113
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,121
Gabrielle invited us
to play poker.

114
00:05:45,493 --> 00:05:48,195
So... is she in?

115
00:05:48,229 --> 00:05:51,364
Mrs. Solis
will be right down.

116
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:54,134
She likes to make
an entrance.

117
00:05:54,168 --> 00:05:57,070
What does that mean,
"an entrance"?

118
00:05:57,104 --> 00:05:59,840
Hello there.

119
00:05:59,874 --> 00:06:03,844
Welcome to my home.

120
00:06:03,878 --> 00:06:05,445
Oh.

121
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:07,247
That's what it means.

122
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:08,849
So I said, "pumpkin"--

123
00:06:08,883 --> 00:06:10,851
That's what I call
Jon Bon Jovi--

124
00:06:10,885 --> 00:06:13,687
I said, "pumpkin, even if
I could steer a yacht,

125
00:06:13,721 --> 00:06:16,690
I'm certainly not about to do it
in 5-inch heels."

126
00:06:16,724 --> 00:06:18,725
True story.

127
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:21,161
Well, you've certainly had
quite a glamorous life.

128
00:06:21,195 --> 00:06:24,164
Well, it was before my husband
moved me here to East Nowhere.

129
00:06:24,198 --> 00:06:26,700
Seriously, I don't know
how you girls do it.

130
00:06:26,734 --> 00:06:29,603
Do what?
- Get out of bed in the morning.

131
00:06:29,637 --> 00:06:31,605
I've only lived here a month,

132
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:33,607
and I want
to put a gun to my head.

133
00:06:33,641 --> 00:06:36,009
You know what I mean?

134
00:06:36,043 --> 00:06:37,527
No, we don't.

135
00:06:37,528 --> 00:06:39,012
There are no good
nightclubs, no theater.

136
00:06:39,046 --> 00:06:41,548
What do you do for a good time?

137
00:06:41,582 --> 00:06:43,717
Well, we watch the kids
play soccer.

138
00:06:43,751 --> 00:06:46,219
And the school drama department
puts on some really great shows.

139
00:06:46,254 --> 00:06:48,221
And then there's church,
of course.

140
00:06:48,256 --> 00:06:51,258
Church.

141
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,995
Oh, you're serious.

142
00:06:56,797 --> 00:07:00,300
Look, I know it's quiet here,
but I think you'll find

143
00:07:00,334 --> 00:07:02,302
there's a real charm
to Fairview.

144
00:07:02,336 --> 00:07:05,005
No, no, it's cute. It's cute.
I get that.

145
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,673
It's just...

146
00:07:06,707 --> 00:07:09,376
I was a top-tier fashion model,

147
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:12,779
and I guess I'm just gonna
have to get used to the fact

148
00:07:12,813 --> 00:07:15,649
that the best part of my life
is behind me.

149
00:07:15,683 --> 00:07:18,151
Good-bye doing vodka shots
with Kate Moss,

150
00:07:18,185 --> 00:07:19,653
and hello

151
00:07:19,687 --> 00:07:22,455
to sipping international coffee
with you girls.

152
00:07:26,627 --> 00:07:28,395
Full house.

153
00:07:33,334 --> 00:07:34,467
Yes?

154
00:07:34,502 --> 00:07:36,803
Hello. Is Mrs. Solis here?

155
00:07:36,837 --> 00:07:39,272
Oh, I got it. I got it.
Go, go, go, go, go.

156
00:07:39,307 --> 00:07:40,808
Ma'am, here's the bill
for fixing your sink.

157
00:07:40,809 --> 00:07:42,309
Okay. Thank you.

158
00:07:42,343 --> 00:07:43,810
By the way...

159
00:07:43,844 --> 00:07:46,246
You made quite an impression
at the poker game.

160
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,014
Really?

161
00:07:48,015 --> 00:07:49,749
Oh, yeah. The ladies
can't stop talking about you.

162
00:07:49,784 --> 00:07:51,751
Aw. Well, I'm sure
it was kind of exciting

163
00:07:51,786 --> 00:07:54,521
for them to have a star
in their midst.

164
00:07:54,555 --> 00:07:56,523
Uh, let me think...
did they say "star"?

165
00:07:56,557 --> 00:08:01,695
I heard, uh, "stuck-up,"
"obnoxious," "bitch."

166
00:08:04,198 --> 00:08:05,632
What?!

167
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:08,868
You know, I went out on a limb
to get you into that game,

168
00:08:08,903 --> 00:08:11,304
and then you go in there
acting like

169
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:13,190
you're better than they are.

170
00:08:13,191 --> 00:08:15,041
<i>Oh, my clothes
said that, not me.</i>

171
00:08:15,076 --> 00:08:17,277
<i>Well, did you ask them anything
about their lives?</i>

172
00:08:17,278 --> 00:08:19,479
<i>Why would they want
to talk about their lives?</i>

173
00:08:19,513 --> 00:08:21,081
Their lives are boring.

174
00:08:21,115 --> 00:08:23,483
Well, you know what's
gonna be really boring?

175
00:08:23,517 --> 00:08:26,987
You sitting here alone in this
big house without any friends.

176
00:08:27,021 --> 00:08:29,622
If I were you,
I'd drop the attitude.

177
00:08:29,657 --> 00:08:31,691
Learn to like
your neighbors.

178
00:08:33,394 --> 00:08:35,362
Well,
thanks for the advice.

179
00:08:35,396 --> 00:08:37,364
<i>You wanna add that
to your bill?</i>

180
00:08:37,398 --> 00:08:40,000
No. It's on the house.

181
00:08:45,873 --> 00:08:49,642
I brought muffins.

182
00:08:51,212 --> 00:08:53,847
That's so nice.

183
00:08:53,881 --> 00:08:55,515
We were just...

184
00:08:55,549 --> 00:08:58,418
Playing poker,
and I wasn't invited.

185
00:08:58,452 --> 00:09:00,086
I know. I get it.

186
00:09:00,121 --> 00:09:02,822
I just wanted
to tell you guys

187
00:09:02,857 --> 00:09:05,592
I know I made
a horrible first impression.

188
00:09:05,626 --> 00:09:08,094
Now you know why
models don't usually talk.

189
00:09:08,129 --> 00:09:10,597
Because we say a lot
of stupid, patronizing things.

190
00:09:14,402 --> 00:09:18,538
What I should've said was...
my husband's never home.

191
00:09:18,572 --> 00:09:21,307
I miss the city.

192
00:09:21,342 --> 00:09:23,176
I miss my life.

193
00:09:25,413 --> 00:09:27,881
I'm lonely all the time...

194
00:09:29,917 --> 00:09:32,419
and I could
really use some friends.

195
00:09:36,891 --> 00:09:39,025
Anyway, here.

196
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:48,168
Now that's how
you make an entrance.

197
00:09:55,142 --> 00:09:56,709
Gaby?

198
00:09:56,744 --> 00:09:58,945
I'm sorry. What?

199
00:09:58,979 --> 00:10:02,382
We're getting a wreath
for Eli's funeral. Are you in?

200
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:04,717
Actually, why don't you
let me pay for it?

201
00:10:04,752 --> 00:10:09,122
It can still be from all of us.
- No, you don't have to do that.

202
00:10:09,156 --> 00:10:10,890
I sort of do.

203
00:10:12,293 --> 00:10:14,327
Now let's play some poker.

204
00:10:15,758 --> 00:10:18,126
All right,
time for my luck to change.

205
00:10:18,161 --> 00:10:20,128
This hand is for Eli.

206
00:10:20,163 --> 00:10:22,130
<i>Hmm. Next hand is for Eli.</i>

207
00:10:22,165 --> 00:10:24,533
You know, if we're gonna
have a get-together

208
00:10:24,567 --> 00:10:27,402
after the funeral, we should
start thinking about food.

209
00:10:27,437 --> 00:10:29,021
And by "we" and "food,"
you mean Bree, right?

210
00:10:29,022 --> 00:10:30,606
I thought that was clear.

211
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,075
I'd be happy to.
Any special requests?

212
00:10:33,109 --> 00:10:35,210
How about we pick something
from your cookbook?

213
00:10:35,245 --> 00:10:37,412
Great. Gaby,
do you have your copy?

214
00:10:37,447 --> 00:10:39,948
I'll go get it.

215
00:10:46,222 --> 00:10:49,591
You use my cookbook
to balance your table?

216
00:10:49,592 --> 00:10:51,560
Oh, it's only temporary.

217
00:10:51,594 --> 00:10:53,996
Juanita needed
her coloring book back.

218
00:10:56,065 --> 00:10:58,300
Oh.
- All right.

219
00:10:58,334 --> 00:11:01,370
Watch out, ladies.

220
00:11:13,082 --> 00:11:15,551
I'm sorry if the frittata
is a bit dry.

221
00:11:15,585 --> 00:11:18,053
Are you kidding? It's great.

222
00:11:18,087 --> 00:11:21,089
You should give Linette the recipe.
- Yes, 'cause that's what

223
00:11:21,124 --> 00:11:22,508
women in their eighth month
really crave--more stove time.

224
00:11:22,509 --> 00:11:23,892
Mine is so erratic.

225
00:11:23,927 --> 00:11:26,295
I'm not even sure what the
real temperature is.

226
00:11:26,329 --> 00:11:28,397
Of course,
if a certain doctor

227
00:11:28,431 --> 00:11:30,866
would loosen the purse strings...
- We're not getting a new stove.

228
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,468
If you would just take on
a few more patients,

229
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,954
we could afford it.

230
00:11:34,955 --> 00:11:36,405
Well, if I'm not supporting
you adequately, my dear,

231
00:11:36,439 --> 00:11:38,007
by all means, feel free
to do something about it.

232
00:11:38,008 --> 00:11:39,575
Such as?

233
00:11:39,609 --> 00:11:42,878
Well, you could maybe...
I don't know, get a job?

234
00:11:42,912 --> 00:11:46,315
I have a job.
I'm a homemaker.

235
00:11:46,349 --> 00:11:48,917
And a damn good one.
So to make this,

236
00:11:48,952 --> 00:11:50,836
you--you just s-sauté
some ham and some onions--

237
00:11:50,837 --> 00:11:52,721
It's not happening, Tom.

238
00:11:52,755 --> 00:11:54,323
I just sometimes think

239
00:11:54,357 --> 00:11:56,992
maybe you would appreciate
the value of a dollar more

240
00:11:57,026 --> 00:11:59,094
if you had to work
outside the home.

241
00:11:59,128 --> 00:12:01,763
<i>And I think you would appreciate
my value more if, for once,</i>

242
00:12:01,798 --> 00:12:04,333
you had to cook your own food
and wash your own clothes.

243
00:12:04,367 --> 00:12:06,635
Lynette makes me sew my own buttons.
- I'll sew anything you want

244
00:12:06,669 --> 00:12:08,637
if you just stop
getting me pregnant.

245
00:12:08,671 --> 00:12:10,639
I want a new stove, Rex,

246
00:12:10,673 --> 00:12:13,875
and if I need to get a job
to pay for it, so be it.

247
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,744
If you're
looking for a stove,

248
00:12:15,778 --> 00:12:18,380
we've got one
that's hardly ever been used.

249
00:12:18,414 --> 00:12:21,183
I wish I could say the same
for my uterus.

250
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,222
<i>Oh, yeah. I ruined the brunch.</i>

251
00:12:33,096 --> 00:12:35,063
Hey, how's it looking
under there, Eli?

252
00:12:35,098 --> 00:12:37,466
Is it gonna cost me
an arm and a leg?

253
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,735
Nah. A few fingers, maybe.

254
00:12:41,738 --> 00:12:44,706
Honey, my stomach's growling.
When's dinner?

255
00:12:44,741 --> 00:12:46,241
Oh, we're having leftovers.

256
00:12:46,275 --> 00:12:48,610
You can heat them up yourself
if you want.

257
00:12:48,645 --> 00:12:50,979
Since when
do we have leftovers?

258
00:12:51,014 --> 00:12:53,615
Since I started
writing my own cookbook.

259
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,283
Remember how you told me

260
00:12:55,318 --> 00:12:57,285
I should start making
my own money?

261
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,287
Well, I've been going through
all my old recipes,

262
00:12:59,322 --> 00:13:01,356
and I've got
this great idea

263
00:13:01,391 --> 00:13:04,259
for a real home-style American cookbook.
- You're not serious?

264
00:13:04,293 --> 00:13:06,328
Why wouldn't I be?

265
00:13:06,362 --> 00:13:08,130
People are always
complimenting me on my cooking.

266
00:13:08,131 --> 00:13:09,898
You're great, but come on.

267
00:13:09,932 --> 00:13:11,900
Every bored housewife
who pulls off a decent lasagna

268
00:13:11,934 --> 00:13:14,236
thinks she can
write a cookbook.

269
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:16,538
You think I'm just like
every other housewife?

270
00:13:16,572 --> 00:13:19,708
No. No, no, no. That's not what
I'm saying. It's just that...

271
00:13:19,742 --> 00:13:22,477
what do you really know?

272
00:13:22,512 --> 00:13:25,647
I'll learn. And I want it to be
more than just a cookbook.

273
00:13:25,682 --> 00:13:27,649
I want to talk
about traditional values

274
00:13:27,684 --> 00:13:29,651
and give helpful hints
about homemaking.

275
00:13:29,686 --> 00:13:31,753
Look, look,
this is my fault.

276
00:13:31,788 --> 00:13:34,256
You know, I-I was
ribbing you the other day

277
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:36,558
about getting a job,
but you took it seriously.

278
00:13:36,592 --> 00:13:39,594
If you really want a new stove,
I'll get you a stove.

279
00:13:43,066 --> 00:13:45,033
Now can you stop
this foolishness

280
00:13:45,068 --> 00:13:47,969
and make me something to eat
that isn't leftovers?

281
00:14:17,567 --> 00:14:19,201
Mrs. Van de Kamp?

282
00:14:19,235 --> 00:14:22,137
I fixed your banister.
Should be fine now.

283
00:14:24,474 --> 00:14:26,842
I'll just go.
You can pay me whenever.

284
00:14:26,876 --> 00:14:29,211
I know this is
a rough time for you.

285
00:14:29,245 --> 00:14:32,080
Thanks, Eli.

286
00:14:32,115 --> 00:14:35,016
By the way,

287
00:14:35,051 --> 00:14:37,552
the service for Mr. V.
was really nice.

288
00:14:41,557 --> 00:14:43,191
You were there?

289
00:14:43,226 --> 00:14:45,694
I sat
in the back of the church.

290
00:14:45,728 --> 00:14:48,697
I wanted to say good-bye
to Mr. V.

291
00:14:50,466 --> 00:14:52,134
So uh...

292
00:14:53,503 --> 00:14:55,971
have you thought about
what you're gonna do now?

293
00:14:56,005 --> 00:14:59,007
You mean, with my life?

294
00:15:00,443 --> 00:15:02,444
I don't know.

295
00:15:04,847 --> 00:15:07,015
Mrs. V...

296
00:15:07,049 --> 00:15:10,185
I've been meaning to give this
to you for a while now...

297
00:15:10,219 --> 00:15:11,753
but I, uh,

298
00:15:11,788 --> 00:15:13,722
could never find
the right moment.

299
00:15:18,728 --> 00:15:21,830
I kept it for you, just in case
you might need it someday.

300
00:15:25,735 --> 00:15:27,502
Hope you don't mind.

301
00:15:30,406 --> 00:15:34,075
Oh, I gotta tell you.
I made your Cajun meatloaf.

302
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,410
Whoo!

303
00:15:35,444 --> 00:15:39,014
That may be
my favorite meal ever.

304
00:15:39,048 --> 00:15:41,783
I can't believe
you saved this.

305
00:15:41,818 --> 00:15:43,151
Ah.

306
00:15:43,186 --> 00:15:46,154
Of course,
I'm not really in the mood

307
00:15:46,189 --> 00:15:48,290
to write a cookbook
right now.

308
00:15:48,324 --> 00:15:49,958
Well...

309
00:15:49,992 --> 00:15:52,594
maybe one day you will be.

310
00:15:59,836 --> 00:16:02,737
Hey, Bree, I know what
you can make for the wake--

311
00:16:02,772 --> 00:16:05,707
that flaky-breaded-shrimp
thing.

312
00:16:07,443 --> 00:16:10,679
Thanks, but I know
exactly what I'm gonna make.

313
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,948
Dave, it was a nice trip,
but I gotta tell you,

314
00:16:16,983 --> 00:16:20,218
I don't know why we spent all
that money going to the Bahamas.

315
00:16:20,253 --> 00:16:22,320
If we're not gonna
leave the hotel room,

316
00:16:22,355 --> 00:16:24,656
then why not just cover
ourselves in suntan lotion

317
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,324
and have sex here?

318
00:16:26,359 --> 00:16:29,227
You just got a message
from Mrs. McCluskey.

319
00:16:29,262 --> 00:16:30,796
Oh?

320
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:33,265
She said your handyman died.

321
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:35,700
Eli?

322
00:16:35,735 --> 00:16:37,202
Oh, my God.

323
00:16:37,236 --> 00:16:39,204
He was
working on Susan's roof

324
00:16:39,238 --> 00:16:41,606
and dropped dead
of a heart attack.

325
00:16:41,641 --> 00:16:43,708
Can you believe that?

326
00:16:52,652 --> 00:16:55,620
<i>No, no, no. You are not
going to the gym again.</i>

327
00:16:55,655 --> 00:16:57,923
You said we were gonna
have afternoon sex.

328
00:16:57,957 --> 00:16:59,324
We'll do it when I get back.

329
00:16:59,325 --> 00:17:00,692
<i>You say that
every time, Umberto,</i>

330
00:17:00,726 --> 00:17:02,377
And then you're too tired.

331
00:17:02,378 --> 00:17:04,029
Maybe I wouldn't be
if you weren't so clingy.

332
00:17:04,063 --> 00:17:05,130
Clingy?

333
00:17:05,164 --> 00:17:07,599
We haven't had sex
in two weeks.

334
00:17:07,633 --> 00:17:09,734
It's like I'm 15 again.

335
00:17:11,437 --> 00:17:13,138
<i>Not us. You.</i>

336
00:17:13,172 --> 00:17:15,340
Your libido
is out of control.

337
00:17:15,374 --> 00:17:17,109
Umberto--

338
00:17:17,143 --> 00:17:20,145
Look, you've got
a drawerful of toys. Use 'em.

339
00:17:27,086 --> 00:17:29,087
Oh!

340
00:17:32,425 --> 00:17:33,925
Ahem.

341
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,560
Oh!

342
00:17:35,595 --> 00:17:38,196
Oh! Eli! I-I forgot
you were in there.

343
00:17:38,231 --> 00:17:40,198
Yeah. I'm done fixing
your faucet.

344
00:17:40,233 --> 00:17:42,601
Actually, I was done
ten minutes ago,

345
00:17:42,635 --> 00:17:45,504
but I was afraid to come out.
- I'm sorry you heard all of that.

346
00:17:45,538 --> 00:17:47,506
The good news is,
while I was in there,

347
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:50,041
I re-grouted your tub...
free of charge.

348
00:17:51,577 --> 00:17:53,411
Wait a second.

349
00:17:56,449 --> 00:17:59,017
What do you think
of my ass?

350
00:17:59,051 --> 00:18:00,385
Sorry?

351
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:03,188
My ass--
on a scale from one to ten.

352
00:18:03,222 --> 00:18:05,624
Well, I-I-I, uh...

353
00:18:05,658 --> 00:18:06,658
ticktock.

354
00:18:06,692 --> 00:18:08,326
Ten. It's a ten.

355
00:18:09,862 --> 00:18:12,597
And the boobs?
Perky and firm?

356
00:18:12,632 --> 00:18:14,833
You've named them?

357
00:18:14,867 --> 00:18:16,501
Oh, come on, Eli.

358
00:18:16,536 --> 00:18:19,004
My husband
won't have sex with me.

359
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:22,274
I just need to make sure
it's not... me.

360
00:18:22,308 --> 00:18:24,376
It's not you.

361
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,077
Are you sure?

362
00:18:26,112 --> 00:18:28,079
Trust me. I used
to work in construction.

363
00:18:28,114 --> 00:18:30,582
My buddies would've
gone crazy for you--

364
00:18:30,616 --> 00:18:32,484
cat calls, uh,
nasty gestures.

365
00:18:32,518 --> 00:18:34,286
"Hey, you,
with the sweater meats!

366
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,321
"If you ever need
any work done, call me!

367
00:18:36,355 --> 00:18:39,591
'Cause I got the perfect tool
for the job!"

368
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:42,627
Y-you get the drift.

369
00:18:42,662 --> 00:18:45,564
Yeah. I do.

370
00:18:45,598 --> 00:18:48,066
That was insulting
and demeaning.

371
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,734
Oh.

372
00:18:49,769 --> 00:18:52,604
Thank you so much.

373
00:19:02,114 --> 00:19:03,648
Miss Britt?

374
00:19:03,683 --> 00:19:05,584
The door was wide open.

375
00:19:05,618 --> 00:19:07,452
I got the paint. You
want to check the color?

376
00:19:07,453 --> 00:19:09,287
Eh.

377
00:19:10,957 --> 00:19:12,757
Is everything okay?

378
00:19:12,792 --> 00:19:16,261
Things are great.

379
00:19:16,295 --> 00:19:17,996
You want some wine?

380
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,331
We're celebrating.

381
00:19:19,365 --> 00:19:20,999
What's the occasion?

382
00:19:21,033 --> 00:19:24,236
I am no longer married
to a gay guy.

383
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:26,538
Umberto was gay?

384
00:19:26,572 --> 00:19:28,740
So you wasted your time

385
00:19:28,774 --> 00:19:30,742
installing that light
in the closet,

386
00:19:30,776 --> 00:19:33,578
because...
he went flying out of there.

387
00:19:33,613 --> 00:19:36,348
At least you know now
it wasn't you.

388
00:19:36,382 --> 00:19:38,183
Wasn't it?

389
00:19:38,217 --> 00:19:40,752
He said
that being married to me

390
00:19:40,786 --> 00:19:44,189
was what convinced him
that he liked men.

391
00:19:44,223 --> 00:19:46,441
Oh.

392
00:19:46,442 --> 00:19:48,660
You could imagine what a
boost to the ego that was.

393
00:19:50,029 --> 00:19:51,796
Come on.

394
00:19:51,831 --> 00:19:54,799
You had a gay guy sleeping
with you for two years,

395
00:19:54,834 --> 00:19:57,802
and those guys are pretty hard to land.

396
00:19:57,837 --> 00:20:00,105
No. No, trust me.

397
00:20:01,707 --> 00:20:03,208
No need to be sad.

398
00:20:04,777 --> 00:20:07,279
You're a knockout.

399
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:17,222
No, I-I-I need
this hand back.

400
00:20:17,256 --> 00:20:21,326
It's hard to be a handyman
without a-a hand.

401
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,427
Mm.

402
00:20:24,397 --> 00:20:27,332
Miss Britt,
what are you doing?

403
00:20:27,366 --> 00:20:30,935
You put the mirror
over my bed.

404
00:20:32,471 --> 00:20:34,739
You know
exactly what I'm doing.

405
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:39,811
Are you sure about this? I don't
want to take advantage of you.

406
00:20:41,647 --> 00:20:44,182
Oh,
I'm sure you'll be gentle.

407
00:20:48,287 --> 00:20:50,555
Anyway,

408
00:20:50,589 --> 00:20:53,058
I guess they're
burying him on Saturday.

409
00:20:53,092 --> 00:20:55,060
Obviously, you want to go.

410
00:20:55,094 --> 00:20:57,896
Yeah.

411
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:00,465
I do.

412
00:21:02,268 --> 00:21:05,136
Oh,
leave that black dress out.

413
00:21:05,171 --> 00:21:07,205
I'll get it dry-cleaned
for the funeral.

414
00:21:07,239 --> 00:21:10,241
A little sexy for a funeral,
isn't it?

415
00:21:11,877 --> 00:21:14,512
Oh, I don't think Eli would mind.

416
00:21:19,066 --> 00:21:20,800
Mom?

417
00:21:20,834 --> 00:21:23,869
That's Penny.
I'll be right back.

418
00:21:23,904 --> 00:21:25,738
Mom!

419
00:21:25,772 --> 00:21:27,873
Hey, sweetie.

420
00:21:27,908 --> 00:21:29,375
What's up?

421
00:21:29,409 --> 00:21:31,877
You said you would
help me with my math.

422
00:21:31,912 --> 00:21:34,614
We're dividing fractions.

423
00:21:34,648 --> 00:21:38,551
Oh. I wish you'd caught me
two Chardonnays ago.

424
00:21:38,585 --> 00:21:40,553
Mom, you promised.

425
00:21:40,587 --> 00:21:44,423
I know, but mommy's
still planning Eli's memorial.

426
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:45,925
Start without me.

427
00:21:45,959 --> 00:21:48,594
I'll be there
in a little while.

428
00:22:06,813 --> 00:22:09,181
Oh, my gosh.
Lynette, are you okay?

429
00:22:09,216 --> 00:22:12,952
The doctor just called.
I'm pregnant.

430
00:22:12,986 --> 00:22:16,455
This is fantastic!

431
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:17,623
You--

432
00:22:17,658 --> 00:22:19,291
Yeah. Whoop-dee-doo.

433
00:22:19,326 --> 00:22:22,995
Honey, you don't sound
too happy about this.

434
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:25,665
I was planning
to go back to work.

435
00:22:25,699 --> 00:22:28,501
What? What a--
what are you talking about?

436
00:22:28,535 --> 00:22:31,003
I had it in the back
of my mind for a while,

437
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:34,173
and then yesterday, I got a ph--
- Hold it.

438
00:22:37,344 --> 00:22:40,613
Sorry. I was having trouble
paying attention.

439
00:22:40,647 --> 00:22:44,450
Jeffrey Cuevas is retiring
in September.

440
00:22:44,484 --> 00:22:47,953
I am the perfect person
to step into his job,

441
00:22:47,988 --> 00:22:51,891
and that is exactly when
Parker starts kindergarten.

442
00:22:51,925 --> 00:22:54,627
The timing is like a dream.

443
00:22:54,661 --> 00:22:57,496
But what about our dream
of having a-a little girl?

444
00:22:57,531 --> 00:22:59,498
This could be our chance.

445
00:22:59,533 --> 00:23:02,535
Oh, please. You know it's gonna
be a boy. It's always a boy.

446
00:23:02,569 --> 00:23:04,537
It's just gonna pee
in my face

447
00:23:04,571 --> 00:23:07,173
and hide dead things
in my shoes.

448
00:23:07,207 --> 00:23:09,575
I am doing this, Tom.

449
00:23:09,609 --> 00:23:13,212
I am going after this job.

450
00:23:13,246 --> 00:23:16,182
But who's gonna take care of the kids?

451
00:23:17,901 --> 00:23:19,585
Well, I was hoping you could
cut back on your hours at work.

452
00:23:19,619 --> 00:23:21,320
I can't do that.

453
00:23:21,354 --> 00:23:23,155
I have a career.

454
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:28,160
You did not just say that.

455
00:23:28,195 --> 00:23:29,995
No, I-I didn't. I didn't.

456
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:34,900
Tom, I cannot just
stay at home wiping noses.

457
00:23:34,935 --> 00:23:37,236
I need it for my sanity,

458
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:40,039
and I need you
to back me up.

459
00:23:40,073 --> 00:23:43,075
Oh!

460
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:45,411
Mom?

461
00:23:45,445 --> 00:23:47,413
Well, the kids are up.

462
00:23:47,447 --> 00:23:49,381
They're gonna want
their breakfast.

463
00:23:51,051 --> 00:23:55,588
And I'm gonna back you up
by, uh, making it for 'em.

464
00:23:58,091 --> 00:24:00,226
My hero.

465
00:24:01,328 --> 00:24:03,462
Jeff Cuevas is fantastic,

466
00:24:03,497 --> 00:24:08,567
but I know I could take his
department to a whole new level.

467
00:24:08,602 --> 00:24:10,803
What the hell is that?

468
00:24:10,837 --> 00:24:12,805
Oh, my water broke.

469
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:14,807
Take the overnight bag
out to the car.

470
00:24:14,841 --> 00:24:16,809
Oh, three weeks.

471
00:24:16,843 --> 00:24:20,346
That's a little soon, but, uh,
sure, I could make that work.

472
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,398
For God sakes, Lynette,
we gotta go to the hospital.

473
00:24:22,399 --> 00:24:24,416
- In a minute. I'm
trying to lock this job down.

474
00:24:24,451 --> 00:24:27,586
What kind of
perks are we talking about here?

475
00:24:29,206 --> 00:24:30,790
Okay, you're having
contractions. That's it. You--

476
00:24:30,824 --> 00:24:33,092
I swear,
if you touch this phone,

477
00:24:33,126 --> 00:24:35,928
I will have this baby right here
and then beat you with it!

478
00:24:35,962 --> 00:24:39,165
You're insane.
We have to go.

479
00:24:39,199 --> 00:24:41,200
Could you hold on
one second?

480
00:24:41,234 --> 00:24:43,969
We agreed
I could go back to work

481
00:24:44,004 --> 00:24:47,106
after I gave birth.
- After, Lynette, not during!

482
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,707
I'm sorry.

483
00:24:48,742 --> 00:24:53,212
Is there any way we could finish
this conversation tomorrow?

484
00:24:54,815 --> 00:24:57,016
Oh!

485
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:59,919
L-l-later in the day
works better for me, too.

486
00:24:59,953 --> 00:25:02,488
Well, thank you very much.

487
00:25:02,522 --> 00:25:05,925
Bye.
- Hey. Whew! I got the job.

488
00:25:05,959 --> 00:25:08,427
Congratulations.
The baby's arm is sticking out.

489
00:25:08,461 --> 00:25:10,830
Why don't you high-five it?

490
00:25:10,864 --> 00:25:14,166
Tom, I am in pain.
Do you mind?

491
00:25:14,201 --> 00:25:15,334
Oh.

492
00:25:15,368 --> 00:25:17,036
You'll see, Tom.

493
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:22,007
I know.
People say that you... ooh!

494
00:25:22,042 --> 00:25:26,679
You can't have it all,
but I know we can.

495
00:25:26,713 --> 00:25:30,816
Oh, Mr. Swenson, I can't
tell you how excited I am.

496
00:25:30,851 --> 00:25:33,686
Maybe you could schedule
a staff meeting

497
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,388
so I could hit the ground
running on Monday.

498
00:25:36,423 --> 00:25:38,090
No, no.

499
00:25:38,124 --> 00:25:40,092
No, it can't be Friday,

500
00:25:40,126 --> 00:25:43,095
because, remember, we agreed
that we would start next week?

501
00:25:58,979 --> 00:26:02,414
So again, thank you so much
for this opportunity.

502
00:26:02,449 --> 00:26:04,350
Mrs. Scavo?
Yeah?

503
00:26:04,384 --> 00:26:07,419
I think you might have
forgotten somethin'.

504
00:26:10,257 --> 00:26:12,491
Could you hold on a second?

505
00:26:13,994 --> 00:26:16,695
Oh, my God.

506
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:18,297
Oh, my God.

507
00:26:18,331 --> 00:26:20,266
She's fine.

508
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,768
I was on the phone.

509
00:26:22,802 --> 00:26:26,372
I was talking to my new boss, and I...
- She was only in there for a minute.

510
00:26:26,406 --> 00:26:31,210
But it's 85 degrees outside.
I've never done this before.

511
00:26:31,244 --> 00:26:34,780
You got a lot on your mind--
three kids and a newborn,

512
00:26:34,814 --> 00:26:37,850
it sounds like new job.

513
00:26:37,884 --> 00:26:39,518
Yeah, I do.

514
00:26:39,552 --> 00:26:42,821
Yeah. It's a lot to handle.

515
00:26:42,856 --> 00:26:44,456
There you go.

516
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:49,295
Mm.

517
00:27:00,006 --> 00:27:03,042
I should probably get back
to Susan's windows.

518
00:27:03,076 --> 00:27:04,944
Uh, you take care.

519
00:27:13,853 --> 00:27:16,422
Lynette,
are you still there?

520
00:27:16,456 --> 00:27:17,489
Lynette?

521
00:27:17,524 --> 00:27:19,124
Hello?

522
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:21,427
Are you still there?

523
00:27:25,432 --> 00:27:27,900
Hey. You coming back in?

524
00:27:29,869 --> 00:27:31,804
No.

525
00:27:31,838 --> 00:27:34,840
I'm gonna go help my daughter
with her homework.

526
00:28:15,655 --> 00:28:17,890
Ugh.

527
00:28:17,924 --> 00:28:21,160
Yard sale!

528
00:28:21,194 --> 00:28:24,630
Oh! Good. You're here.

529
00:28:24,664 --> 00:28:26,398
How are you, Eli?

530
00:28:26,432 --> 00:28:27,933
Fine. You?

531
00:28:27,967 --> 00:28:30,936
Great. Yeah, I haven't worn
these Jeans in a while,

532
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:32,938
and I found 20 bucks
in the pocket.

533
00:28:32,972 --> 00:28:35,774
Don't you just love
when that happens?

534
00:28:35,808 --> 00:28:37,776
Also, Karl left me
for his secretary,

535
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:40,445
so I need you
to change these locks.

536
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,514
Oh, I'm so sorry.

537
00:28:42,549 --> 00:28:44,716
Oh, thanks, but don't be.
Just hurry.

538
00:28:44,751 --> 00:28:48,187
Karl said he was coming by
to get some of his stuff,

539
00:28:48,221 --> 00:28:51,623
and I want this place
to be a fortress by then.

540
00:28:51,658 --> 00:28:53,192
You're doing all right,
though?

541
00:28:53,226 --> 00:28:55,527
Oh, well, on one hand,

542
00:28:55,562 --> 00:28:58,530
I got dumped for a pair
of headlights named Brandy.

543
00:28:58,565 --> 00:29:01,033
On the other, I reported
Karl's credit cards stolen,

544
00:29:01,067 --> 00:29:04,036
and I cut the pockets
out of all of his pants.

545
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:07,039
So a little from column "a,"
a little from column "b."

546
00:29:08,575 --> 00:29:12,244
Oh. Sorry.

547
00:29:14,314 --> 00:29:17,482
Well, if it's any consolation,
redheads are nuts.

548
00:29:17,517 --> 00:29:19,151
What do you mean?

549
00:29:19,185 --> 00:29:21,320
That she'll make his life
a living hell.

550
00:29:21,354 --> 00:29:23,322
It sounds like
what he deserves.

551
00:29:23,356 --> 00:29:25,424
Brandy's not a redhead.
She's blonde.

552
00:29:29,896 --> 00:29:33,999
So, uh, you maybe want to go
with a dead bolt this time?

553
00:29:36,069 --> 00:29:41,206
What... do... you... know

554
00:29:42,909 --> 00:29:46,411
I saw him around town
a couple times with a redhead.

555
00:29:46,446 --> 00:29:48,714
Uh, people in the neighborhood
were talking.

556
00:29:48,748 --> 00:29:50,549
I-I thought you knew.

557
00:29:50,583 --> 00:29:53,151
I didn't.

558
00:29:53,186 --> 00:29:55,153
Would you feel any better

559
00:29:55,188 --> 00:29:57,489
knowing that, uh,
she's kinda chubby?

560
00:29:57,523 --> 00:29:59,858
Just leave!

561
00:29:59,892 --> 00:30:01,727
But what--
but what about the locks?

562
00:30:01,761 --> 00:30:03,562
I-i-if Karl's coming...

563
00:30:03,596 --> 00:30:05,864
Change the locks, then leave.

564
00:30:05,898 --> 00:30:08,834
Okay,
but I really am sorry--

565
00:30:08,868 --> 00:30:12,237
Change the locks,
don't talk to me, then leave.

566
00:30:19,579 --> 00:30:21,079
Susan?

567
00:30:23,082 --> 00:30:25,050
Susan, did you call me?

568
00:30:25,084 --> 00:30:27,719
I couldn't really understand
the message.

569
00:30:31,391 --> 00:30:32,891
Oh, wow.

570
00:30:32,925 --> 00:30:36,228
You want me
to come back later?

571
00:30:36,262 --> 00:30:39,197
Are you all right?

572
00:30:41,734 --> 00:30:45,137
No. Of course you're not.

573
00:30:45,171 --> 00:30:47,673
I heard you and Mike
are getting divorced.

574
00:30:47,707 --> 00:30:49,107
I'm sorry.

575
00:30:49,142 --> 00:30:51,410
Probably not
what you want to hear,

576
00:30:51,444 --> 00:30:54,313
but I thought
you were a great couple.

577
00:30:54,347 --> 00:30:55,580
Thanks.

578
00:30:55,615 --> 00:30:57,015
Sweet.

579
00:31:05,591 --> 00:31:09,261
Do you--maybe you remember
what you wanted me to do?

580
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,564
Locks.

581
00:31:12,598 --> 00:31:14,566
Change the locks. Got it.

582
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:18,737
Let me go see what I got
out in the truck.

583
00:31:37,857 --> 00:31:39,524
Susan...

584
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:42,227
I don't know much
about love.

585
00:31:42,261 --> 00:31:45,230
I... I dabbled in it
once or twice,

586
00:31:45,264 --> 00:31:48,834
but it always seemed
more trouble than it was worth.

587
00:31:48,868 --> 00:31:52,637
I told myself
I wasn't missing much.

588
00:31:52,672 --> 00:31:58,377
But watching you
all these years,

589
00:31:58,411 --> 00:32:03,749
how...
how hard you've tried, how...

590
00:32:03,783 --> 00:32:05,484
how hurt you've been,

591
00:32:05,518 --> 00:32:07,486
but you still...

592
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:11,056
keep getting back up,
you dust yourself off,

593
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:12,758
then you try again.

594
00:32:12,792 --> 00:32:16,561
<i>Maybe I am...</i>

595
00:32:16,596 --> 00:32:18,063
missing something.

596
00:32:18,097 --> 00:32:20,832
Maybe...

597
00:32:20,867 --> 00:32:23,101
maybe it is worth it.

598
00:32:25,238 --> 00:32:28,673
And, um, I'm sure
it's not gonna help

599
00:32:28,708 --> 00:32:30,809
for you to hear
tell you this,

600
00:32:30,843 --> 00:32:34,780
but you're damn heroic
to me.

601
00:32:34,814 --> 00:32:38,250
<i>You are.</i>

602
00:32:44,557 --> 00:32:46,324
Yeah.

603
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:55,066
Hey. Just dropping these off.
I finally got 'em cut.

604
00:32:55,101 --> 00:32:57,369
Tell Jackson
I'm sorry it took me so long.

605
00:32:57,403 --> 00:32:59,971
Actually, um...

606
00:33:00,006 --> 00:33:02,073
Jackson and I split up.

607
00:33:02,108 --> 00:33:05,076
Wow. I'm sorry.

608
00:33:05,111 --> 00:33:06,578
Am I sorry?

609
00:33:06,612 --> 00:33:08,346
Oh, yeah.

610
00:33:08,381 --> 00:33:10,549
He's a great guy.

611
00:33:10,583 --> 00:33:12,951
I just, uh,

612
00:33:12,985 --> 00:33:15,153
want to be alone right now.

613
00:33:15,188 --> 00:33:17,255
Well, good for you.

614
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:18,757
Oh, hey.
- Mm?

615
00:33:18,791 --> 00:33:20,759
As long as you're here,

616
00:33:20,793 --> 00:33:23,395
I think there's a loose shingle
on my roof.

617
00:33:23,429 --> 00:33:26,998
Do you think maybe
you could fix it for me?

618
00:33:27,033 --> 00:33:29,067
Oh, I'd be happy to.

619
00:33:29,101 --> 00:33:31,002
But just so you know,

620
00:33:31,037 --> 00:33:34,005
it'll be the last thing I ever
fix for you. I'm retiring.

621
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,340
What?

622
00:33:35,374 --> 00:33:37,609
Today's my last day.

623
00:33:37,643 --> 00:33:40,846
You can't retire.
I break too many things.

624
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,849
I know. You paid for the trip
to Hawaii I'm gonna take.

625
00:33:43,883 --> 00:33:47,085
No, it's the right move.
Be happy for me.

626
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:49,421
Hey, I am happy for you.

627
00:33:49,455 --> 00:33:51,523
It's just, uh...

628
00:33:51,557 --> 00:33:54,359
this is gonna sound crazy.

629
00:33:54,393 --> 00:33:55,961
What?

630
00:33:55,995 --> 00:33:57,963
Um, I think you have been

631
00:33:57,997 --> 00:34:01,700
the most consistent
male relationship in my life.

632
00:34:01,734 --> 00:34:04,469
You're so stable and reliable,
and I just...

633
00:34:04,504 --> 00:34:07,405
always thought
you'd be around.

634
00:34:09,308 --> 00:34:13,712
Which is funny, because I don't
really know anything about you.

635
00:34:13,746 --> 00:34:16,948
Well, how about this--
I fix your shingle,

636
00:34:16,983 --> 00:34:20,218
and when I'm done, you can
ask me anything you want.

637
00:34:20,253 --> 00:34:21,586
Great.

638
00:34:21,621 --> 00:34:24,422
I will go to the store right now
and get some wine

639
00:34:24,457 --> 00:34:26,658
so we can toast
your retirement.

640
00:34:26,692 --> 00:34:31,329
I like that. Perfect way
to end my time on Wisteria Lane.

641
00:34:31,364 --> 00:34:33,698
Oh, yes.

642
00:34:33,733 --> 00:34:36,268
What kind do you like--
red or white?

643
00:34:36,302 --> 00:34:40,171
Either one. Just make sure
it's a screw top.

644
00:34:51,296 --> 00:34:55,766
<i>Eli Scruggs was buried
on a Saturday...</i>

645
00:34:55,801 --> 00:34:58,769
<i>and all the people that Eli
had helped over the years</i>

646
00:34:58,804 --> 00:35:02,773
<i>came to pay
their last respects.</i>

647
00:35:02,808 --> 00:35:05,209
<i>But one person was missing--</i>

648
00:35:05,243 --> 00:35:09,046
<i>someone who had changed
Eli's life...</i>

649
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:12,683
<i>in a way he never forgot.</i>

650
00:35:14,352 --> 00:35:17,321
Hope I'm not interrupting
your day.

651
00:35:17,355 --> 00:35:19,290
Not at all. Can I help you?

652
00:35:19,324 --> 00:35:22,226
I was hoping I could help you.
I'm a handyman.

653
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,328
Just moved into town.
Looking for work.

654
00:35:24,362 --> 00:35:28,098
Sorry. I, um, I don't have
anything that needs fixing.

655
00:35:28,133 --> 00:35:31,836
Well, if you ever do,
uh, here's my card.

656
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:34,905
"Eli Scruggs."

657
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,674
What a distinctive name.

658
00:35:36,708 --> 00:35:38,576
People do seem to remember it.

659
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:40,611
So if any of your friends,
uh, need help,

660
00:35:40,645 --> 00:35:43,914
I can do pretty much anything.
- I don't know. Um...

661
00:35:43,949 --> 00:35:47,017
If you have a extra card or two,
I-I could hand them out.

662
00:35:47,052 --> 00:35:49,487
Oh,
I'd really appreciate that.

663
00:35:49,521 --> 00:35:52,122
Oh.
Oh.

664
00:36:08,139 --> 00:36:09,507
Anyway...

665
00:36:11,409 --> 00:36:13,410
thank you for your time.

666
00:36:15,814 --> 00:36:17,781
I have a broken vase.

667
00:36:17,816 --> 00:36:19,283
I'm sorry?

668
00:36:19,317 --> 00:36:21,285
I-I was, uh,
dusting the other day

669
00:36:21,319 --> 00:36:24,121
and knocked it off the bureau,
like an idiot.

670
00:36:24,155 --> 00:36:25,656
Anyway, I saved the pieces.

671
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:28,158
If you could glue it
back together for me,

672
00:36:28,193 --> 00:36:29,660
I'd really appreciate it.

673
00:36:29,694 --> 00:36:32,696
Oh, ma'am,
you don't have to do that.

674
00:36:32,731 --> 00:36:35,833
Mr. Scruggs,

675
00:36:35,867 --> 00:36:37,801
I need my vase fixed.

676
00:36:37,836 --> 00:36:39,837
It means a lot to me.

677
00:36:41,339 --> 00:36:44,208
Now you're not gonna
make me beg, are you?

678
00:36:45,911 --> 00:36:48,746
No, ma'am, I'm not.

679
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,381
Good.

680
00:36:50,415 --> 00:36:52,283
Come on in.

681
00:37:03,194 --> 00:37:04,728
Mr. Young?

682
00:37:04,763 --> 00:37:07,131
Oh. Didn't mean to disturb you.

683
00:37:07,165 --> 00:37:09,400
Your front door was wide open.

684
00:37:09,434 --> 00:37:11,569
Oh.

685
00:37:11,603 --> 00:37:14,538
Eli, I-I don't have any work
for you today.

686
00:37:14,573 --> 00:37:17,541
I'm just here to drop off
that handle you wanted.

687
00:37:17,576 --> 00:37:21,145
Finally found one that matched.
Want me to install it?

688
00:37:21,179 --> 00:37:23,781
Not today.

689
00:37:23,815 --> 00:37:25,215
Okay.

690
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:27,384
I'll just be going then.

691
00:37:28,987 --> 00:37:31,488
Eli, wait.

692
00:37:33,458 --> 00:37:34,892
What?

693
00:37:36,595 --> 00:37:38,596
Do you remember this?

694
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:40,598
Oh, right.

695
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:42,566
This is the very first
thing you ever fixed for me.

696
00:37:42,601 --> 00:37:44,085
Yeah, that must have been what,
uh, two years ago?

697
00:37:44,086 --> 00:37:45,569
Yeah.

698
00:37:45,604 --> 00:37:48,238
I just that glue really held, huh?
- Yeah.

699
00:37:48,273 --> 00:37:50,240
I want you to have it.

700
00:37:50,275 --> 00:37:53,577
What?

701
00:37:53,612 --> 00:37:54,878
Why?

702
00:37:54,913 --> 00:37:58,015
I've just been
doing some thinking

703
00:37:58,049 --> 00:38:00,017
about the people I know,

704
00:38:00,051 --> 00:38:02,019
the ones who've walked
into my life

705
00:38:02,053 --> 00:38:05,289
and made it better than it was before...
- Oh.

706
00:38:05,323 --> 00:38:07,257
People like you.
- Oh.

707
00:38:07,292 --> 00:38:10,294
Anyway, I've--I've--
I've never said "thank you."

708
00:38:10,328 --> 00:38:13,464
Oh, no, I'm--I'm the one
who should thank you.

709
00:38:13,498 --> 00:38:16,367
You--you introduced me
to all your friends.

710
00:38:16,401 --> 00:38:18,469
My business
couldn't be better.

711
00:38:18,503 --> 00:38:20,938
I'm so glad.

712
00:38:20,972 --> 00:38:22,840
Yeah.

713
00:38:22,874 --> 00:38:26,243
Anyway, I, uh,
I want you to have this.

714
00:38:31,116 --> 00:38:34,018
Mrs. Young...

715
00:38:34,052 --> 00:38:35,552
Are you all right?

716
00:38:37,389 --> 00:38:39,490
Everything's fine.

717
00:38:45,063 --> 00:38:48,632
Are you sure?

718
00:38:52,837 --> 00:38:54,938
You should go now.

719
00:39:31,409 --> 00:39:34,011
So I look in the window,

720
00:39:34,045 --> 00:39:35,813
and there's blood everywhere--

721
00:39:35,847 --> 00:39:38,515
all over the walls and the ceiling...
- Oh!

722
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:40,517
Not to mention,
her hardwood floors,

723
00:39:40,552 --> 00:39:42,753
which she just had installed
last week.

724
00:39:42,787 --> 00:39:45,422
I don't know
what she was thinking.

725
00:39:45,457 --> 00:39:47,958
I just wish there had been
some warning,

726
00:39:47,992 --> 00:39:51,995
some sign that she would do
such a thing.

727
00:40:14,085 --> 00:40:19,189
<i>Eli Scruggs sat in his truck
for almost an hour,</i>

728
00:40:19,224 --> 00:40:23,360
<i>devastated that he had done
nothing to save me.</i>

729
00:40:23,394 --> 00:40:28,165
<i>He then made a quiet vow
to God--</i>

730
00:40:28,199 --> 00:40:30,601
<i>From that moment forward,</i>

731
00:40:30,635 --> 00:40:33,437
<i>he would do what he could
to help people,</i>

732
00:40:33,471 --> 00:40:36,240
<i>to help them fix their lives.</i>

733
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:42,012
<i>And for the rest of his life,</i>

734
00:40:42,046 --> 00:40:45,382
<i>that's exactly what he did.</i>

735
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,728
That was a lovely service.

736
00:40:57,762 --> 00:40:59,396
Eli would've liked it.

737
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:03,133
Hell of a turnout.
- Who knew he had so many friends?

738
00:41:03,168 --> 00:41:05,903
I'm not surprised.
He was a good man.

739
00:41:05,937 --> 00:41:07,437
I can't help feeling

740
00:41:07,472 --> 00:41:09,506
there's more we could have done
to honor him.

741
00:41:09,541 --> 00:41:11,642
Well, let's just make sure
we remember him.

742
00:41:11,676 --> 00:41:14,311
Eli would have said that's more
than most people get.

743
00:41:14,345 --> 00:41:17,614
And he would have
been right...

744
00:41:17,649 --> 00:41:19,483
As usual.

745
00:41:26,157 --> 00:41:28,592
Wait.

746
00:41:43,708 --> 00:41:49,746
I wanted to fix something
for Eli for a change.

747
00:41:56,521 --> 00:41:57,988
<i>And somewhere,</i>

748
00:41:58,022 --> 00:42:01,225
<i>in a place reserved
for the very best of us,</i>

749
00:42:01,259 --> 00:42:06,029
<i>Eli Scruggs smiled
and said, "thank you."</i>

750
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:07,030
