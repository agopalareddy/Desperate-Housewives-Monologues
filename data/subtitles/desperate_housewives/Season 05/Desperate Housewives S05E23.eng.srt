1
00:00:01,172 --> 00:00:02,606
Previously on...

2
00:00:02,673 --> 00:00:03,640
We're getting married.

3
00:00:03,708 --> 00:00:06,007
One proposal led to another.

4
00:00:06,077 --> 00:00:08,478
We're with immigration.

5
00:00:08,546 --> 00:00:10,097
But the law gets in the way.

6
00:00:10,098 --> 00:00:11,648
Can't this wait?
We're about to get married.

7
00:00:11,716 --> 00:00:15,185
Not today, you're not.
A break-in was staged...

8
00:00:15,253 --> 00:00:17,521
Orson, we've been robbed.

9
00:00:17,588 --> 00:00:21,525
in an attempt to hide assets in a divorce.

10
00:00:21,592 --> 00:00:23,126
After the crash...

11
00:00:23,127 --> 00:00:24,661
And the truth about the accident came out.

12
00:00:24,729 --> 00:00:27,797
Mike told 'em that he was driving, but it wasn't true.

13
00:00:33,971 --> 00:00:36,373
 The thing you have to understand

14
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,810
about Dave Williams is he wanted to be forgiven.

15
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:44,681
That's why he made the videotape.

16
00:00:47,385 --> 00:00:51,254
I didn't want to kill M.J. Delfino.

17
00:00:51,322 --> 00:00:53,690
I had to.

18
00:00:59,564 --> 00:01:04,534
Susan Mayer killed my wife and daughter.

19
00:01:04,602 --> 00:01:07,437
The police called it... an accident.

20
00:01:07,505 --> 00:01:11,675
But I don't believe a person

21
00:01:11,742 --> 00:01:14,344
who takes two precious lives

22
00:01:14,412 --> 00:01:16,947
should be allowed to just...

23
00:01:17,014 --> 00:01:18,448
walk away.

24
00:01:18,516 --> 00:01:22,052
I know some people will wonder,

25
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:24,554
why didn't I just kill Susan?

26
00:01:24,622 --> 00:01:27,958
But what good would that have done?

27
00:01:28,025 --> 00:01:31,127
She'd be dead. There'd be no...

28
00:01:31,195 --> 00:01:32,662
suffering.

29
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:35,131
And to those who hate me

30
00:01:35,199 --> 00:01:37,834
because I took the life...

31
00:01:37,902 --> 00:01:39,736
of an innocent young boy, I say...

32
00:01:41,973 --> 00:01:43,873
Aw, crap.

33
00:01:49,914 --> 00:01:55,585
Yes, Dave Williams wanted everyone to forgive him...

34
00:01:55,653 --> 00:01:59,389
Look, I got a new tackle box for our trip on Saturday.

35
00:01:59,457 --> 00:02:02,525
But not until he finished doing...

36
00:02:02,593 --> 00:02:06,196
the unforgivable.

37
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,737
After the White Horse nightclub

38
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,807
was destroyed by a suspicious fire,

39
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:25,411
one body was left unclaimed.

40
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:28,714
The detectives on this case referred to him as...

41
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:32,685
"John Doe A-37."

42
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:36,922
For months, they tried to identify him.

43
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:41,527
Then one day, they got a call from an impound lot.

44
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:44,530
It seems a car had been towed from the club parking lot

45
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:46,532
the night of the fire... 

46
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,301
a car that had been rented...

47
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:52,938
to a Dr. Samuel Heller from Boston,

48
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:57,943
who had been reported missing four months earlier.

49
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:03,649
The doctor's dental records confirmed their theory.

50
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:06,051
His receptionist, however,

51
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,519
did not.

52
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:09,655
No way.

53
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:12,157
Dr. Heller did not die in that fire.

54
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:14,159
Ma'am, we've got his dental records.

55
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:17,129
I don't care. You said the fire was four months ago?

56
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,932
Well, I've gotten texts from him since then.

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,401
You have?

58
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:25,271
Yeah. The last one was just a few weeks ago.

59
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:27,439
Hmm.

60
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:30,342
Maybe we should send a text back.

61
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,378
Ma'am, you have your phone with you?

62
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,391
Hey, Dave.

63
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,393
I was gonna call you.

64
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,661
You were?

65
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:49,862
Yeah. Um... did you say something to M.J.

66
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:52,865
about going on that fishing trip?
Yeah, I did.

67
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:55,834
I know how depressed you've been since Jackson was deported,

68
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,737
so I thought, now is the perfect time

69
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:01,573
for the three of us to go up to the lake. And...

70
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:04,410
I got M.J. his own little life vest.

71
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:08,438
I wish I could, but I can't. I'm worried about Jackson.

72
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:09,782
All the more reason.

73
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,784
You know what they say about fishing... 

74
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:13,919
it's nature's tranquilizer.

75
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:18,590
Dave, I haven't heard from Jackson since he was taken away,

76
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,592
and I just wanna be here in case he calls.

77
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,462
Yeah, well, that's okay. Just bring your cell phone.

78
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,098
I'd just feel more comfortable if I'm close by.

79
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,100
Oh, that's crazy.

80
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:30,402
I mean, Jackson wouldn't want you sittin' around here

81
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,404
worrying about him.

82
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:35,741
I'm sorry. We'll go fishing another time.

83
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:40,512
Don't you think you're being a little selfish here?

84
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,448
And what about M.J.?

85
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:45,317
You wanna go fishing, don't you, buddy?
Yeah!

86
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:46,518
Yeah.

87
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:49,021
What are you doing?

88
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:51,590
I just told you I can't go.

89
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:54,026
I'm just thinking about M.J.

90
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:57,096
He'll be fine.

91
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:03,402
You know what? You're right.

92
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,137
I'm sorry.

93
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:06,872
It's just a trip.

94
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,753
You're not listening!

95
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,721
Six months in Europe would be educational.

96
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,723
You know what would be more educational?

97
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,725
You going to college like we talked about.

98
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,727
Mom, I've already been in school for 12 years already.

99
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:29,917
I... I need a vacation.

100
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:32,698
Well, it seems like, based on your last few report cards,

101
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:34,900
you've already been on vacation.

102
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:38,103
I'm gonna be 18. If I wanna go to Europe, I'll go to Europe.

103
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:41,306
Oh? Well, good luck paying for it,

104
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:44,209
because if you so much as apply for a passport,

105
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:45,393
we're cuttin' you off.

106
00:05:45,394 --> 00:05:48,080
Cut off from the mighty Scavo family fortune? Oh, no!

107
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:51,850
Tom, why didn't you help me out there?

108
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:54,520
Because I agree with him.

109
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:55,854
What?

110
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:57,856
Well, he's young. He should be having fun.

111
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:00,859
I mean, look--look at me. I'm a middle-aged man

112
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:03,595
reading the want ads for jobs that I'll never get.

113
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:06,109
I should've gone to Europe when I had the chance.

114
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:06,598
Hey, focus.

115
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,600
Our son is throwing his life away.

116
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:11,270
We have got to keep him on track.

117
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:13,839
What is so great about the track?

118
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:16,341
I was on it. I did everything I was supposed to.

119
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:18,677
It chewed me up
and spit me out.

120
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:20,646
I know you're discouraged,

121
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,682
But... letting our son
make a huge mistake

122
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,319
is not gonna help anything.
Even if it is a huge mistake,

123
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,823
you got to let people make some decisions about their own life.

124
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,225
Your way is not the only way.

125
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:35,227
I am just trying to help Preston

126
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:37,463
avoid the way marked "unemployable loser."

127
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,699
Fine. What do you want me to do?

128
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:45,938
I want you to get this stupid Europe idea out of his head.

129
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:47,940
Take him on a tour of the campus.

130
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:50,442
Get him excited. Show him college could be fun.

131
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,044
Sure.

132
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:56,448
And on the way home, I'll show my college diploma

133
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,750
to the guy at the Burger Barn.
Ohh.

134
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:01,787
Yeah. They're hiring a new fry cook for the night shift.

135
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:05,591
If you're really stopping by there,

136
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:07,893
bring home some onion rings.

137
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:09,895
Mommy, what are you doing?

138
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:12,865
We're going to a family reunion at Aunt Connie's on Saturday,

139
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,766
and I want to look my best.

140
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:17,169
Is it gonna be fun?

141
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:19,338
Well, if your idea of a good time

142
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:21,807
is sitting on rusty lawn chairs in the driveway

143
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,809
eating lard the shaped fried chicken,

144
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:26,945
then yeah! It's gonna be a blast.
The driveway?

145
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:28,447
Honey, you're 6 now,

146
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:32,784
so I think it's time we had a little mother/daughter talk.

147
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:34,786
Your father's side of the family's trash.

148
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:36,488
Any questions?

149
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:38,490
If you don't like her,

150
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:41,293
why are you putting on your best jewelry?

151
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:43,262
'Cause that's what grownups do, sweetie.

152
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,731
when we don't like someone, we don't punch them

153
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,200
or say mean things. We just find subtle ways

154
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:50,636
to make them feel bad about their lives.

155
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:53,071
Ooh, like these earrings. Aunt Connie can't afford them,

156
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,173
and that'll make her sad.

157
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:57,676
And this will bring her to her knees.

158
00:07:57,744 --> 00:08:00,112
And this will be a kick in her throat.

159
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,551
If you hate 'em so much, maybe we shouldn't go.

160
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:08,320
Oh, no, sweetie. We have to go. They're family.

161
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:13,392
See, this is why I wanted to check on my things.

162
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:16,361
You don't leave a valuable painting on the damn floor.

163
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:18,864
You need to put something underneath it.

164
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:21,400
Fine. How about this ugly doormat?

165
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:23,402
That is not a doormat.

166
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:25,470
That is a handwoven Kurdish Kazak rug.

167
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:30,642
You know, Bree, when I hang out with you,

168
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,644
I realize how little I know

169
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,846
and how much I don't give a crap.

170
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:37,316
Give me that.

171
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:39,318
I'm so glad this divorce is almost over.

172
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:42,788
An obnoxious, unpleasant man will be out of my life,

173
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,723
and so will Orson.

174
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,725
Hey, it's not over yet.

175
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:48,727
You still got
a couple of hurdles.

176
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:51,630
Has Orson brought up the insurance claim again?

177
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,265
No, he thinks I filed it.

178
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,567
Great. When he realizes you never did, you'll be divorced,

179
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:57,536
he'll be broke, and it won't matter.

180
00:08:57,604 --> 00:08:59,538
Yes, and I'll be single again,

181
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:01,540
and I can concentrate on my business,

182
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:03,609
maybe do some traveling.

183
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,344
Maybe spend a little time

184
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:07,412
at the intersection of right leg and left leg,

185
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,704
If you know what I'm saying.

186
00:09:08,705 --> 00:09:10,716
Sadly, Karl, I always know what you're saying.

187
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:13,652
You know, if you want, I could set you up.

188
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,222
I know a lot of great guys who are good for a free dinner.

189
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,225
And a few laughs, huh?

190
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:22,227
Thanks, Karl. I'm not even divorced yet,

191
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:25,197
and once I am, I don't think you'd be my first choice

192
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:26,832
as a matchmaker.
Oh, shoot.

193
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,386
Hello?

194
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:48,854
Hey, Susan, it's me.

195
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:51,857
Jackson, I have been so worried.

196
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,092
Where... where are you?
Fairview jail.

197
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,995
They're processing my deportation papers.

198
00:09:57,063 --> 00:10:00,766
So they're sending you back? When?

199
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,668
Couple days.

200
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:05,170
I just wanted to call and say thank you and...

201
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:07,572
tell you that I'll miss you.

202
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,343
Well... I'll miss you, too.

203
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:13,345
I mean, you came in my life

204
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:16,314
when I was going through a really hard time,

205
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:17,816
and you were amazing.

206
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:20,385
I mean, you are amazing.

207
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,254
You, too.
So...

208
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:24,256
Did the immigration people tell you

209
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:26,992
how they found out about you?
Anonymous tip.

210
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,429
Although it's pretty obvious who "anonymous" is.

211
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:33,732
Does Mike really think I'm that stupid?

212
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,069
Mike? You think Mike did this?

213
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,603
Who else?

214
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:41,106
Mike and Katherine were the only people who knew.

215
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:43,575
Katherine was doing cartwheels
about us getting married, so...

216
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,610
Yeah, but, no, this doesn't make any sense

217
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,746
because Mike knew that it wasn't for real.

218
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:50,716
Well, real or not, he had the look of a guy

219
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:53,151
who's not ready to give you up, so... 

220
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:54,720
Time's up.

221
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:56,788
Uh, I-I gotta go.

222
00:10:56,856 --> 00:11:00,258
I'll try and call you again before I leave.

223
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,292
Hey!

224
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,861
Hey, hey, how was the campus tour?

225
00:11:25,929 --> 00:11:27,029
Fantastic. Oh!

226
00:11:27,097 --> 00:11:30,399
Oh, my God. That school is amazing.

227
00:11:30,467 --> 00:11:32,401
Oh.
The professors are so engaged,

228
00:11:32,469 --> 00:11:34,403
and the kids were open and friendly.

229
00:11:34,471 --> 00:11:35,905
Really?

230
00:11:35,972 --> 00:11:39,442
Yeah. It was inspiring. You were so right to send us.

231
00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:41,911
Good. Good. I knew if you saw the campus,

232
00:11:41,978 --> 00:11:44,747
you'd have a change of heart.

233
00:11:44,815 --> 00:11:46,782
Me? Nah. I'm still going to Europe.

234
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:53,723
What was that? I thought you said the tour was fantastic.

235
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:57,893
Okay, so Preston still needs a little convincing.

236
00:11:57,961 --> 00:12:01,664
But I don't.

237
00:12:01,732 --> 00:12:04,467
I'm going back to school.

238
00:12:04,534 --> 00:12:06,635
Wh-what's that now?

239
00:12:06,703 --> 00:12:09,305
Okay. I know it's a little out of left field,

240
00:12:09,372 --> 00:12:12,808
but walking across the quad, I felt so alive.

241
00:12:12,876 --> 00:12:14,777
I spoke with someone in admissions,

242
00:12:14,845 --> 00:12:17,813
and all I have to do is pass an entrance exam.

243
00:12:17,881 --> 00:12:21,851
So...

244
00:12:21,918 --> 00:12:25,654
Ahem. You would be a college student... again.

245
00:12:25,722 --> 00:12:27,723
Mm-hmm.

246
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:30,993
25 years after the first time.

247
00:12:31,061 --> 00:12:33,929
But this time... focused.

248
00:12:33,997 --> 00:12:37,433
This time, knowing exactly what I wanna major in.

249
00:12:37,501 --> 00:12:39,301
Which is?

250
00:12:39,369 --> 00:12:41,437
Chinese.

251
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,673
Chinese?

252
00:12:44,741 --> 00:12:46,709
Chinese?

253
00:12:46,777 --> 00:12:48,711
As in "moo goo gai pan" Chinese?

254
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:50,713
What's he gonna do with that,

255
00:12:50,781 --> 00:12:52,948
watch Bruce Lee movies without the subtitles?

256
00:12:53,016 --> 00:12:54,917
We didn't get that far.

257
00:12:54,985 --> 00:12:57,920
I felt faint, and he left to go buy a backpack.

258
00:12:57,988 --> 00:13:00,422
Ooh. Lynette, that's bad.

259
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:03,893
Well, it's just so random, and the worst part is

260
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,395
if I point that out, I'm a bitch.

261
00:13:06,463 --> 00:13:07,897
Why is that?

262
00:13:07,964 --> 00:13:09,865
When did being practical and realistic

263
00:13:09,933 --> 00:13:11,367
become synonymous with bitchiness?

264
00:13:11,434 --> 00:13:13,869
The first time a man did something stupid,

265
00:13:13,937 --> 00:13:16,438
and a woman pointed it out.

266
00:13:16,506 --> 00:13:19,408
I know Tom. He's going to learn
how to count to ten in Chinese,

267
00:13:19,476 --> 00:13:21,911
then he'll get bored and move on to his new dream

268
00:13:21,978 --> 00:13:23,095
of becoming a beekeeper.

269
00:13:23,096 --> 00:13:25,748
Well, then you have no choice. Bite the bullet and bitch.

270
00:13:25,816 --> 00:13:27,750
No, she has a choice.

271
00:13:27,818 --> 00:13:30,252
It's entirely possible to get what you want

272
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,755
without being perceived of as a nagging shrew.

273
00:13:32,823 --> 00:13:35,791
Please, Sensei, instruct me in your ancient ways.

274
00:13:35,859 --> 00:13:39,094
Well, the key is to not let them know what you're doing.

275
00:13:39,162 --> 00:13:42,898
This requires observation, cunning and manipulation.

276
00:13:42,966 --> 00:13:45,434
Isn't it just easier to shut down your hoo-ha

277
00:13:45,502 --> 00:13:47,736
until he gives in?
I think that Bree is right... 

278
00:13:47,804 --> 00:13:50,005
that the more Tom sees you digging in your heels,

279
00:13:50,073 --> 00:13:52,641
the more he's gonna wanna do it.

280
00:13:52,709 --> 00:13:54,643
So you wait for an opportunity

281
00:13:54,711 --> 00:13:56,645
that you can use to your advantage

282
00:13:56,713 --> 00:13:58,476
while at the same time appearing supportive.

283
00:13:58,477 --> 00:13:59,181
That's your advice?

284
00:13:59,249 --> 00:14:01,317
Hope an opportunity just drops in my lap?

285
00:14:01,384 --> 00:14:04,453
Might as well start shopping for beekeeper suits.

286
00:14:09,092 --> 00:14:13,696
Oh, you guys, I'm sorry. I gotta run.

287
00:14:15,432 --> 00:14:17,733
Hey. I need to talk to Mike.

288
00:14:17,801 --> 00:14:20,776
Oh, he's in the shower, but I'll tell him you stopped by.

289
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:21,904
Oh, no need. I'll wait.

290
00:14:30,647 --> 00:14:33,282
Orson, I'm home.

291
00:14:52,269 --> 00:14:53,869
Have a seat.

292
00:15:02,112 --> 00:15:06,382
So there never was a robbery.

293
00:15:06,449 --> 00:15:11,020
You took these things, hoping to hide them from me.

294
00:15:11,087 --> 00:15:14,490
And though I've tried to come up with a reason, I can't.

295
00:15:14,557 --> 00:15:16,959
So I'm forced to ask the question why.

296
00:15:17,027 --> 00:15:19,495
Why would you do such a thing?

297
00:15:22,532 --> 00:15:24,700
I want a divorce.

298
00:15:28,371 --> 00:15:30,906
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

299
00:15:30,974 --> 00:15:33,242
My lawyer says you're entitled to half of everything

300
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:35,244
we've acquired during the marriage,

301
00:15:35,312 --> 00:15:37,680
so I was trying to hide some of those things,

302
00:15:37,747 --> 00:15:40,983
since... let's face it... I paid for them.

303
00:15:41,051 --> 00:15:43,018
You've already hired a lawyer?

304
00:15:43,086 --> 00:15:44,887
Yes, but I'm tired of all the lying

305
00:15:44,955 --> 00:15:47,423
and the sneaking around, so I will inform him

306
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:50,826
that you can have whatever you like.
I don't want a divorce.

307
00:15:50,894 --> 00:15:53,862
Well, that part's non-negotiable.

308
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,898
Can't we at least talk about this?

309
00:15:55,966 --> 00:15:59,001
There's no point.

310
00:15:59,069 --> 00:16:01,971
So you should get a piece of paper, start to make a list

311
00:16:02,038 --> 00:16:07,109
of what it is you wish to take with you.

312
00:16:07,177 --> 00:16:12,247
So... you don't want any of it?

313
00:16:12,315 --> 00:16:17,653
No. All I want is out.

314
00:16:30,433 --> 00:16:33,502
You know, he might be a while. Sure I can't help you?

315
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:37,072
No, I need to talk to Mike.

316
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:40,743
Now you could flush the toilet
and try to get him out of there.

317
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,881
You seem upset.

318
00:16:45,949 --> 00:16:47,716
Something happened?

319
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:53,389
Did Mike turn Jackson in to immigration?

320
00:16:53,456 --> 00:16:56,025
No. Why would he do that?

321
00:16:56,092 --> 00:16:57,526
I don't know. Jealousy?

322
00:16:57,594 --> 00:16:59,962
Jackson thinks Mike is still hung up on me.

323
00:17:01,498 --> 00:17:04,733
Trust me, Susan. Mike did not turn Jackson in.

324
00:17:04,801 --> 00:17:06,402
Mm. Shower's off.

325
00:17:06,469 --> 00:17:08,771
I guess we'll know in a few seconds.

326
00:17:08,838 --> 00:17:11,940
Listen... Mike couldn't have called immigration

327
00:17:12,008 --> 00:17:13,942
because I never told him

328
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:16,612
that Jackson was marrying you for a green card.

329
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:19,081
Well, somebody did, because he sent me a text

330
00:17:19,149 --> 00:17:22,251
agreeing to keep paying me alimony.

331
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:24,887
That was me.

332
00:17:24,954 --> 00:17:27,389
I sent it.

333
00:17:27,457 --> 00:17:30,592
Are you insane? Why would you do something... 

334
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,562
Mike has asked me to marry him.

335
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,397
What?

336
00:17:35,465 --> 00:17:37,866
And I was afraid that if he found out

337
00:17:37,934 --> 00:17:39,868
that you weren't really in love with Jackson,

338
00:17:39,936 --> 00:17:42,371
that he might change his mind about me.

339
00:17:42,439 --> 00:17:44,373
Okay, Katherine, that is...

340
00:17:44,441 --> 00:17:47,109
it's totally unfair to Mike.

341
00:17:47,177 --> 00:17:49,878
I mean, he needs to know the truth.

342
00:17:49,946 --> 00:17:52,047
I can make him happy, Susan.

343
00:17:52,115 --> 00:17:54,283
He just needs to get over you.

344
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,885
Katherine?

345
00:17:56,953 --> 00:17:58,987
Please, don't ruin this.

346
00:18:01,858 --> 00:18:04,593
Hey, you wanna just order in?

347
00:18:04,661 --> 00:18:06,695
Oh, hey, Susan.

348
00:18:06,763 --> 00:18:09,431
Um... I'm glad you're here.

349
00:18:09,499 --> 00:18:11,900
Um, I have something I wanna tell you.

350
00:18:11,968 --> 00:18:14,470
Um, yeah. I...

351
00:18:14,537 --> 00:18:16,972
Katherine already told me about your big news.

352
00:18:20,176 --> 00:18:22,511
Oh.

353
00:18:22,579 --> 00:18:24,546
Okay. Um...

354
00:18:24,614 --> 00:18:28,083
Well, I hope we have your blessing.

355
00:18:32,088 --> 00:18:34,723
Yes, sure.

356
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:36,758
Uh...

357
00:18:36,826 --> 00:18:38,727
Why not?

358
00:18:44,134 --> 00:18:48,170
I'm sorry, Susan.

359
00:18:50,607 --> 00:18:54,209
I was gonna tell you myself.

360
00:19:00,817 --> 00:19:03,085
Well, don't be mad at Katherine.

361
00:19:03,153 --> 00:19:06,855
We all know that she just can't... keep a secret.

362
00:19:20,238 --> 00:19:22,839
Yeah, Aunt Connie's salons haven't been doing so well.

363
00:19:22,907 --> 00:19:25,342
You know, maybe you should take off some of those diamonds.

364
00:19:25,409 --> 00:19:27,344
You walk in there like that,

365
00:19:27,411 --> 00:19:29,753
you're gonna make her feel bad about herself.

366
00:19:29,754 --> 00:19:30,313
Say no more.

367
00:19:30,381 --> 00:19:32,816
You know, Aunt Connie's like a second mother to me.

368
00:19:32,884 --> 00:19:34,075
Why do you hate her so much?

369
00:19:34,076 --> 00:19:35,819
Because all she ever does is put me down.

370
00:19:35,887 --> 00:19:38,255
If you'd pay attention, you'd see what I'm talking about.

371
00:19:38,322 --> 00:19:40,690
Oh! There's my Carlos!

372
00:19:40,758 --> 00:19:42,759
Hi, Tía.
Hi!

373
00:19:42,827 --> 00:19:44,160
Mmm.

374
00:19:44,228 --> 00:19:45,996
Are these the girls?

375
00:19:46,063 --> 00:19:48,598
No! They're so grown up!

376
00:19:50,334 --> 00:19:51,902
And, Gaby...

377
00:19:53,871 --> 00:19:55,305
Is it just me,

378
00:19:55,373 --> 00:19:59,276
or do you get more beautiful every time I see you?

379
00:19:59,343 --> 00:20:01,645
No, it's not just you.

380
00:20:01,712 --> 00:20:04,614
Come here. Give me a hug.
Let me see your palms.

381
00:20:04,682 --> 00:20:07,617
Gaby.
Fine.

382
00:20:07,685 --> 00:20:09,386
Oh!
Oh! Oh!

383
00:20:11,455 --> 00:20:13,590
Now come on in!

384
00:20:13,658 --> 00:20:15,592
The whole family's here.

385
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:19,296
And I've made some of my world-famous tamales.

386
00:20:23,701 --> 00:20:25,802
Aunt Connie seems nice.

387
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,437
Maybe she's changed.

388
00:20:27,505 --> 00:20:30,540
Trash don't change, sweetheart. She's up to something.

389
00:20:30,608 --> 00:20:33,043
Now come on, let's go grab a lawn chair

390
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:36,546
before we get stuck on the grass with the fire ants.

391
00:20:40,017 --> 00:20:42,452
 Tom Scavo, this is Mr. Cummings.

392
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,421
We met during your tour of the campus.

393
00:20:44,488 --> 00:20:45,922
Forgive me,

394
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:48,925
but I gave you the wrong date for the admissions test.

395
00:20:48,993 --> 00:20:51,895
It's tomorrow at 8:00 a.m.
So get a good night's sleep,

396
00:20:51,963 --> 00:20:55,065
and we'll see you first thing in the morning.

397
00:20:55,132 --> 00:20:57,567
Help! Help! Help! Help!
Oh! Coming. I'm coming.

398
00:20:57,635 --> 00:20:59,235
It goes... there.

399
00:20:59,303 --> 00:21:04,407
So... I was thinking this whole going back to school thing..

400
00:21:07,144 --> 00:21:08,979
deserves a little celebration.

401
00:21:09,046 --> 00:21:12,449
Really? I didn't think you were on board.

402
00:21:12,516 --> 00:21:15,218
I wanna be supportive.

403
00:21:15,286 --> 00:21:17,187
Let's go for a nice dinner,

404
00:21:17,254 --> 00:21:19,022
get a bottle of wine...

405
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:22,425
maybe two, since we don't have
to wake up early tomorrow.

406
00:21:22,493 --> 00:21:24,894
Or we can go to that Mexican place

407
00:21:24,962 --> 00:21:26,896
that has those great margaritas.

408
00:21:26,964 --> 00:21:30,567
Oh, Tom. You and tequila?

409
00:21:30,634 --> 00:21:33,303
What a great idea.

410
00:21:33,371 --> 00:21:37,374
Okay, everybody, I need you to gather around.

411
00:21:37,441 --> 00:21:40,744
Aunt Connie has something to say.

412
00:21:40,811 --> 00:21:42,746
Gaby, come on. My Tía's waiting.

413
00:21:42,813 --> 00:21:44,748
Well, let her wait. I need something to drink.

414
00:21:44,815 --> 00:21:48,518
I mean trying to keep down one
of her "world-famous" tamales.

415
00:21:48,586 --> 00:21:51,021
Thank you all so much for coming today.

416
00:21:51,088 --> 00:21:54,657
It's been so long since we've been together.

417
00:21:54,725 --> 00:21:57,260
We love you, Aunt Connie.

418
00:21:57,328 --> 00:21:59,963
Oh, and I love all of you.

419
00:22:00,031 --> 00:22:02,065
There's nothing more important than family.

420
00:22:02,133 --> 00:22:05,368
And now I have an announcement to make.

421
00:22:05,436 --> 00:22:07,404
As many of you know,

422
00:22:07,471 --> 00:22:10,373
I've battled a weak heart for most of my life.

423
00:22:10,441 --> 00:22:12,375
And the doctor now tells me

424
00:22:12,443 --> 00:22:15,745
that I may only have a few months left.

425
00:22:20,184 --> 00:22:22,085
Sorry.

426
00:22:22,153 --> 00:22:24,521
Bad heart. Floor's all yours.

427
00:22:24,588 --> 00:22:26,523
As some of you know,

428
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,558
I've been taking care of my granddaughter,

429
00:22:28,626 --> 00:22:30,527
my beautiful Ana.

430
00:22:30,594 --> 00:22:33,263
Because of my condition, I can't do it anymore,

431
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:35,832
and I need someone to take her in.

432
00:22:40,237 --> 00:22:42,672
I realize that this is a lot to ask.

433
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:46,910
We would love to help out, but Miguel just lost his job.

434
00:22:46,977 --> 00:22:48,978
We're barely scraping by.

435
00:22:49,046 --> 00:22:50,747
I understand.

436
00:22:50,815 --> 00:22:54,584
Obviously, it has to be someone who can afford to do this.

437
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,222
We wish we could, but we've got such a full house.

438
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:02,492
Maybe it should be someone who doesn't have kids.

439
00:23:04,695 --> 00:23:07,931
I know this is not gonna be easy, but we're family,

440
00:23:07,998 --> 00:23:10,133
and this is what we do for each other.

441
00:23:12,436 --> 00:23:14,904
Well, you know...

442
00:23:14,972 --> 00:23:18,675
we're still gonna be family tomorrow,

443
00:23:18,742 --> 00:23:21,377
so I think we should think about it overnight

444
00:23:21,445 --> 00:23:23,079
and search our hearts,

445
00:23:23,147 --> 00:23:25,115
and try to figure out

446
00:23:25,182 --> 00:23:27,684
which one of your homes is best for Ana.

447
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,021
Gabrielle's right.

448
00:23:32,089 --> 00:23:35,625
And please know that I won't judge any of you harshly

449
00:23:35,693 --> 00:23:38,995
if you decide that you cannot take care

450
00:23:39,063 --> 00:23:41,664
of my beautiful granddaughter.

451
00:23:41,732 --> 00:23:44,100
We love you, Aunt Connie!

452
00:23:44,168 --> 00:23:46,402
Yay!

453
00:24:04,321 --> 00:24:06,089
What are you doing?

454
00:24:06,157 --> 00:24:07,790
I'm helping.

455
00:24:07,858 --> 00:24:09,792
I don't need any help.

456
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,962
And besides, my Parisian salad doesn't call for any chives.

457
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:16,666
Yes. I've always thought it was a bit bland.

458
00:24:16,734 --> 00:24:21,137
I think the chives will give it the bite it's so sorely lacking.

459
00:24:21,205 --> 00:24:24,240
My salad has plenty of bite.

460
00:24:28,379 --> 00:24:31,714
So... when are you moving out?

461
00:24:31,782 --> 00:24:33,516
Actually, I'm not.

462
00:24:33,584 --> 00:24:35,485
Excuse me?

463
00:24:35,553 --> 00:24:38,354
Oh, I've decided to stay so we can work on our marriage.

464
00:24:38,422 --> 00:24:40,323
Am I cutting these too fine?

465
00:24:40,391 --> 00:24:42,325
Orson, I understand this is a shock,

466
00:24:42,393 --> 00:24:45,929
but you have to face facts. Our marriage is over.

467
00:24:45,996 --> 00:24:47,931
Ah, once you weigh what's at stake,

468
00:24:47,998 --> 00:24:49,966
I think you'll change your mind.

469
00:24:50,034 --> 00:24:52,602
Well, if you're referring to the financial settlement,

470
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:55,104
I already told you, I don't care anymore.

471
00:24:55,172 --> 00:24:57,307
No, actually, I'm referring to your freedom.

472
00:24:57,374 --> 00:24:59,309
I've been to jail, Bree.

473
00:24:59,376 --> 00:25:01,311
Trust me, you wouldn't last ten seconds.

474
00:25:01,378 --> 00:25:03,880
Jail?
Yes, of course.

475
00:25:03,948 --> 00:25:08,284
Well, insurance fraud is a serious crime.
Ah, but I never filed an insurance claim.

476
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,919
Ah, but I did.

477
00:25:12,556 --> 00:25:15,391
What?!
Yes, I thought we were robbed.

478
00:25:15,459 --> 00:25:16,893
So, of course,

479
00:25:16,961 --> 00:25:19,329
I did the responsible thing and reported it...

480
00:25:19,396 --> 00:25:21,898
on both our behalves.

481
00:25:21,966 --> 00:25:23,900
And since you rather carelessly

482
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:26,202
rented the storage unit under your own name,

483
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:29,105
I think the police will find me completely blameless.

484
00:25:29,173 --> 00:25:31,207
You would actually send your wife to prison?

485
00:25:31,275 --> 00:25:32,875
My wife? No.

486
00:25:32,943 --> 00:25:34,844
My ex-wife? You bet.

487
00:25:34,912 --> 00:25:37,080
But it won't come to that, darling.

488
00:25:37,147 --> 00:25:40,149
I know we can get back to what we both once had.

489
00:25:42,152 --> 00:25:43,886
That will never happen.

490
00:25:43,954 --> 00:25:46,122
And sure we've had our challenges... 

491
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:49,058
tour penchant for emasculation, my kleptomania.

492
00:25:49,126 --> 00:25:51,527
But every marriage has its ebb and flow.

493
00:25:51,595 --> 00:25:54,464
Orson, please don't do this.

494
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,201
I don't love you.

495
00:26:02,072 --> 00:26:03,906
That's all right, darling.

496
00:26:05,643 --> 00:26:07,844
I have enough love for the both of us.

497
00:26:11,482 --> 00:26:14,817
Mmm! Not bland anymore.

498
00:26:25,663 --> 00:26:28,431
The girls are sacked out. Can we talk now?

499
00:26:28,499 --> 00:26:30,433
What's there to talk about?

500
00:26:30,501 --> 00:26:33,436
You won't even let the girls get a golden retriever,

501
00:26:33,504 --> 00:26:36,406
And now you wanna take in a teenager?
It's not about what I want.

502
00:26:36,473 --> 00:26:38,408
It's about doing the right thing.

503
00:26:38,475 --> 00:26:41,411
This is what family does for each other.
Well, luckily, it's a big family.

504
00:26:41,478 --> 00:26:44,247
Let her go live with Nina and Luis.
They have eight kids.

505
00:26:44,315 --> 00:26:45,915
So what's one more?

506
00:26:45,983 --> 00:26:48,418
They'll never know the difference.
You're being selfish.

507
00:26:48,485 --> 00:26:51,754
No, I'm thinking about our children. They're so happy.

508
00:26:51,822 --> 00:26:55,258
Taking in a kid we don't even know? That's a huge risk.

509
00:26:55,326 --> 00:26:57,260
Yeah, it's the same risk

510
00:26:57,328 --> 00:26:59,629
my Aunt Connie took for me and my mother.

511
00:26:59,697 --> 00:27:03,366
When my father left, Mamá and I had nowhere else to turn.

512
00:27:03,434 --> 00:27:05,368
Aunt Connie opened her home to us.

513
00:27:05,436 --> 00:27:08,338
She saved us from the streets.
Yeah, and knowing Aunt Connie,

514
00:27:08,405 --> 00:27:11,341
she's waited all these years to call that favor in.

515
00:27:11,408 --> 00:27:13,443
She's probably dying on purpose.

516
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:17,213
Babe, we are so blessed.

517
00:27:17,281 --> 00:27:19,215
This is a chance for us to give back.

518
00:27:19,283 --> 00:27:22,985
Maybe God gave me back my sight and all this money

519
00:27:23,053 --> 00:27:25,388
so I could help my family.

520
00:27:25,456 --> 00:27:27,390
Gaby, think about it.

521
00:27:27,458 --> 00:27:29,392
If something happened to us,

522
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:32,695
wouldn't you want someone to do this for our two girls?

523
00:27:38,736 --> 00:27:41,070
Okay, whoa, whoa, easy. You're a little drunk there.

524
00:27:41,138 --> 00:27:43,072
That's 'cause I love you, Lynette!

525
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,174
I love you, too, baby. Here you go.

526
00:27:45,242 --> 00:27:47,143
And I love you, Preston.

527
00:27:47,211 --> 00:27:49,479
I'm Porter.

528
00:27:49,546 --> 00:27:50,980
I could never tell
you two apart.

529
00:27:51,048 --> 00:27:54,951
But you're my favorite.

530
00:27:55,018 --> 00:27:56,552
Lynette!

531
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:59,021
How come you let me drink so many margaritas?

532
00:27:59,089 --> 00:28:03,359
Yeah, and why did we have to stay till closing?

533
00:28:03,427 --> 00:28:05,361
It's almost 2:00.
Who cares what time it is?

534
00:28:05,429 --> 00:28:08,097
We were celebrating a big change in your dad's life.

535
00:28:08,165 --> 00:28:09,532
Whoo-hoo!

536
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,168
Hoo! Hey, someone called.

537
00:28:12,236 --> 00:28:14,537
 Tom Scavo, this is Mr. Cummings.

538
00:28:14,605 --> 00:28:16,739
We met during your tour of the campus.

539
00:28:16,807 --> 00:28:18,207
Forgive me,

540
00:28:18,275 --> 00:28:20,209
but I gave you the wrong date for the admissions test.

541
00:28:20,277 --> 00:28:22,412
It's tomorrow at 8:00 a.m.

542
00:28:23,981 --> 00:28:26,582
Oh, cram! I gotta crap for that test!

543
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:30,553
Ooh, jeez.

544
00:28:49,516 --> 00:28:51,284
They're on to you.

545
00:28:53,354 --> 00:28:55,788
Those messages you sent to my receptionist

546
00:28:55,856 --> 00:28:57,457
didn't fool anybody.

547
00:28:59,426 --> 00:29:01,327
They've identified my body,

548
00:29:01,395 --> 00:29:04,397
and now they're trying to trap you.

549
00:29:05,866 --> 00:29:07,467
It's not gonna work.

550
00:29:07,534 --> 00:29:10,103
They can trace those signals, Dave.

551
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:13,272
They're going to find you.

552
00:29:18,612 --> 00:29:21,014
It's too late.

553
00:29:21,081 --> 00:29:23,016
Whatever plan you had,

554
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:25,918
it went to hell when you killed me.

555
00:29:25,986 --> 00:29:28,388
You should've stayed on your meds.

556
00:29:28,455 --> 00:29:30,390
Y-you don't know what you're talking about.

557
00:29:30,457 --> 00:29:33,059
I'm getting away with this.
Why would you want to?

558
00:29:33,127 --> 00:29:35,528
I don't mean to criticize,

559
00:29:35,596 --> 00:29:38,531
but I thought you were doing this for us.

560
00:29:43,404 --> 00:29:45,271
I am.

561
00:29:45,339 --> 00:29:48,307
I want justice for our family.

562
00:29:48,375 --> 00:29:51,044
Then who cares if you're caught?

563
00:29:51,111 --> 00:29:53,312
We miss you, Dave.

564
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:56,149
We should be together.

565
00:29:56,216 --> 00:29:58,317
So...

566
00:29:58,385 --> 00:30:01,320
What are you saying?

567
00:30:01,388 --> 00:30:05,224
So I should just... walk over and kill M.J. now?

568
00:30:05,292 --> 00:30:08,594
Sure. Why not?

569
00:30:08,662 --> 00:30:11,597
And let's face it, your plan to take the kid to some lake

570
00:30:11,665 --> 00:30:14,667
and pretend he accidentally drowned?

571
00:30:14,735 --> 00:30:17,070
Boring.

572
00:30:17,137 --> 00:30:20,206
Hey, isn't it better than Susan know

573
00:30:20,274 --> 00:30:22,341
why her son had to die?

574
00:30:22,409 --> 00:30:25,311
I mean, the whole point is to make her suffer.

575
00:30:25,379 --> 00:30:26,546
Right?

576
00:30:28,916 --> 00:30:30,383
That's true.

577
00:30:30,451 --> 00:30:34,620
And then the whole world will finally understand

578
00:30:34,688 --> 00:30:36,889
what you've been going through.

579
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,809
Yeah, that's it! Good job.

580
00:30:56,877 --> 00:30:58,978
One more just like that.

581
00:30:59,046 --> 00:31:02,348
Ooh. Hey. Um, can I talk to you a sec?

582
00:31:02,416 --> 00:31:03,916
Yeah. Sure.

583
00:31:06,086 --> 00:31:08,521
I'm gonna get some juice. You want anything?

584
00:31:08,589 --> 00:31:09,789
Um, no, thanks.

585
00:31:09,857 --> 00:31:11,691
So, look, uh...

586
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:14,093
I'm sorry if I was

587
00:31:14,161 --> 00:31:17,029
a little under-enthusiastic the other day

588
00:31:17,097 --> 00:31:19,031
about you and Katherine getting married.

589
00:31:19,099 --> 00:31:20,700
Oh, well, I understand.

590
00:31:20,768 --> 00:31:22,835
You just found out your fiancé was being deported.

591
00:31:22,903 --> 00:31:25,471
The timing kind of sucked.

592
00:31:25,539 --> 00:31:28,007
Yeah. That and, uh...

593
00:31:28,075 --> 00:31:31,010
I don't know. It d... did kind of come out of nowhere.

594
00:31:31,078 --> 00:31:34,213
Well, we have been living together.

595
00:31:34,281 --> 00:31:36,682
I know.

596
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:39,352
But still... I mean, it happened so fast.

597
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:41,220
I just...

598
00:31:41,288 --> 00:31:44,590
I wanna make sure that you know what you're doing.

599
00:31:46,493 --> 00:31:47,627
Susan...

600
00:31:47,694 --> 00:31:51,097
I know. And feel free to throw me out of your house

601
00:31:51,165 --> 00:31:53,266
if I'm out of line...

602
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:56,702
but do you love her?

603
00:32:01,809 --> 00:32:03,743
Why would you ask that?

604
00:32:03,811 --> 00:32:07,613
Just answer the question.

605
00:32:07,681 --> 00:32:10,683
Yeah.

606
00:32:10,751 --> 00:32:12,385
I love her.

607
00:32:15,022 --> 00:32:17,356
Good.

608
00:32:17,424 --> 00:32:19,692
That's all I needed to hear.

609
00:32:22,029 --> 00:32:26,632
Well, I hope that you will be very happy together.

610
00:32:28,702 --> 00:32:32,805
And I hope everything works out for you and Jackson.

611
00:32:32,873 --> 00:32:35,541
Yeah, well, I don't know if that's gonna happen.

612
00:32:35,609 --> 00:32:38,744
What do you mean? You two aren't getting married?

613
00:32:38,812 --> 00:32:42,148
Oh, the truth is, um...

614
00:32:43,784 --> 00:32:46,519
well, it's complicated.

615
00:32:46,587 --> 00:32:48,254
Hey, Susan!

616
00:32:48,322 --> 00:32:52,225
M.J. told me you were here. What are you guys talking about?

617
00:32:54,027 --> 00:32:56,896
We were talking about you, actually.

618
00:32:56,964 --> 00:32:59,966
Me? What about me?

619
00:33:00,033 --> 00:33:03,236
Well...

620
00:33:03,303 --> 00:33:06,739
I realized that I never properly congratulated you

621
00:33:06,807 --> 00:33:08,741
on getting married.

622
00:33:08,809 --> 00:33:11,110
Really?

623
00:33:13,947 --> 00:33:16,249
Really.

624
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:25,892
Hey, babe. How'd the test go?

625
00:33:29,229 --> 00:33:31,197
It's as though...

626
00:33:31,265 --> 00:33:32,865
I dug down deep

627
00:33:32,933 --> 00:33:35,534
and I found a new level of suck

628
00:33:35,602 --> 00:33:37,503
that I never knew I had in me.

629
00:33:37,571 --> 00:33:40,072
I'm sure it wasn't that bad.

630
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,308
Lynette...

631
00:33:44,344 --> 00:33:46,779
I puked tequila in the parking lot,

632
00:33:46,847 --> 00:33:49,916
I... I passed out twice in the essay section,

633
00:33:49,983 --> 00:33:53,286
and I giggled uncontrollably when I read the word "Uranus."

634
00:33:53,353 --> 00:33:57,890
Add to that that I'm pretty sure that I spelled "Scavo" wrong,

635
00:33:57,958 --> 00:34:00,860
and it is a safe bet that I will not be

636
00:34:00,928 --> 00:34:03,162
broadening my horizons anytime soon.

637
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:05,564
Hey.

638
00:34:05,632 --> 00:34:07,300
Don't sweat it.

639
00:34:07,367 --> 00:34:09,235
You wanted to learn Chinese...

640
00:34:09,303 --> 00:34:11,203
Mm, we'll get you a book.

641
00:34:11,271 --> 00:34:16,175
Mandarin is a very complicated language.

642
00:34:16,243 --> 00:34:18,644
You can't get the kind of fluency you need

643
00:34:18,712 --> 00:34:21,213
for the professional marketplace from a book.

644
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:24,884
Marketplace?

645
00:34:24,952 --> 00:34:27,520
That's the whole point.

646
00:34:27,587 --> 00:34:31,924
China is one of the world's fastest growing economies.

647
00:34:31,992 --> 00:34:34,994
The opportunities for someone with my marketing experience

648
00:34:35,062 --> 00:34:37,496
Who can speak the language are amazing.

649
00:34:37,564 --> 00:34:39,498
I mean, we're talking beaucoup bucks.

650
00:34:39,566 --> 00:34:42,535
I could've totally reinvented myself.

651
00:34:45,072 --> 00:34:47,506
That's...

652
00:34:47,574 --> 00:34:49,575
a brilliant plan.

653
00:34:51,511 --> 00:34:53,546
Why didn't you tell me this?

654
00:34:55,282 --> 00:34:57,283
What does  matter?

655
00:34:59,586 --> 00:35:00,920
It's over.

656
00:35:07,127 --> 00:35:09,095
I'm sorry I let you down.

657
00:35:16,803 --> 00:35:18,838
Wow.

658
00:35:18,905 --> 00:35:20,840
You're getting married this weekend?

659
00:35:20,907 --> 00:35:22,842
Yeah. That's the good thing about Vegas.

660
00:35:22,909 --> 00:35:25,311
Doesn't require any planning. Oh, my gosh.

661
00:35:25,379 --> 00:35:27,813
You know what? Why don't you come with us?

662
00:35:27,881 --> 00:35:30,383
You could be my Maid of Honor.

663
00:35:31,818 --> 00:35:33,886
That's ridiculous, isn't it?

664
00:35:33,954 --> 00:35:36,355
It's sweet, but...

665
00:35:36,423 --> 00:35:38,424
Yeah, it's ridiculous.

666
00:35:38,492 --> 00:35:40,259
And besides, um,

667
00:35:40,327 --> 00:35:43,462
M.J. and I have big plans this weekend.

668
00:36:12,259 --> 00:36:13,826
Hey, Dave.

669
00:36:15,429 --> 00:36:16,862
Glad I caught you.

670
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:20,466
Is your friend's boat still available this weekend?

671
00:36:20,534 --> 00:36:21,967
What?

672
00:36:22,035 --> 00:36:24,937
Well, I was thinking about what you said, and you were right.

673
00:36:25,005 --> 00:36:28,974
It really would do me good to
get out of here for a few days.

674
00:36:29,042 --> 00:36:31,243
You're right.

675
00:36:31,311 --> 00:36:35,614
It would do us all some good.

676
00:36:42,439 --> 00:36:45,007
Carlos!

677
00:36:45,075 --> 00:36:48,878
You have no idea how much this means to me,

678
00:36:48,946 --> 00:36:50,880
knowing that you and Gaby

679
00:36:50,948 --> 00:36:55,184
will be looking after my beautiful Ana.

680
00:36:55,252 --> 00:36:58,554
I can finally be at peace.

681
00:36:58,622 --> 00:36:59,889
Ohh.

682
00:36:59,957 --> 00:37:02,091
I love you, too.

683
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:05,228
And tell Gaby I said thank you.

684
00:37:05,295 --> 00:37:07,263
Bye.

685
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:13,336
So... are you gonna tell him the truth about Ana?

686
00:37:13,403 --> 00:37:15,872
Oh, they'll find out soon enough.

687
00:37:24,014 --> 00:37:25,281
Hello?

688
00:37:25,349 --> 00:37:28,184
Hi. I'm trying to reach Roberta Simmonds.

689
00:37:28,252 --> 00:37:31,220
Speaking, but barely. Who's this?

690
00:37:31,288 --> 00:37:32,922
This is Claire Cormier,

691
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:35,091
Dr. Heller's receptionist.

692
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:36,759
Do you remember me?

693
00:37:36,827 --> 00:37:38,094
Yeah, sure

694
00:37:38,162 --> 00:37:40,463
but I'm right in the middle of my breakfast,

695
00:37:40,531 --> 00:37:43,566
so if you'd call me back around 11:00...
I just thought you might wanna know

696
00:37:43,634 --> 00:37:45,635
the police stopped by.

697
00:37:45,702 --> 00:37:48,237
They told me that Dr. Heller is dead.

698
00:37:48,305 --> 00:37:52,575
Yeah, go on. I'm listening.

699
00:37:52,643 --> 00:37:57,313
Dr. Heller died in a fire at the White Horse?

700
00:37:57,381 --> 00:37:59,782
And apparently, there was no smoke in his lungs.

701
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:03,152
Which means he was dead before the fire started.

702
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,987
My guess?

703
00:38:05,055 --> 00:38:08,024
The person he was coming to see is the person who killed him.

704
00:38:08,091 --> 00:38:09,826
Dave.

705
00:38:09,893 --> 00:38:11,894
Dave.

706
00:38:14,131 --> 00:38:17,033
Roberta, what are we gonna do?
Go to the police.

707
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,098
And tell 'em what?

708
00:38:18,099 --> 00:38:21,037
Well, we know Dr. Heller was a criminal psychologist,

709
00:38:21,104 --> 00:38:23,506
And we're pretty sure Dave was his patient.

710
00:38:23,574 --> 00:38:25,508
I'd feel better if we had proof.

711
00:38:25,576 --> 00:38:27,710
I'd feel better if I had a functioning liver,

712
00:38:27,778 --> 00:38:30,713
but sometimes you have to play the hand you're dealt.

713
00:38:30,781 --> 00:38:33,683
If we walk into the police with a half-cocked story,

714
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:35,685
they're gonna laugh us out of the station.

715
00:38:35,752 --> 00:38:37,353
I don't know how,

716
00:38:37,421 --> 00:38:39,989
but we... we gotta give 'em something more.

717
00:38:40,057 --> 00:38:43,192
Didn't you tell me Dave once broke into your house?

718
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:46,028
Yeah. Why?

719
00:38:46,096 --> 00:38:51,000
Maybe it's time we returned the favor.

720
00:38:51,068 --> 00:38:54,470
You know, when you missed your appointment on Monday,

721
00:38:54,538 --> 00:38:58,274
we thought maybe you skipped out on us.

722
00:38:58,342 --> 00:39:02,178
Yeah, well, as you can see, I was otherwise detained.

723
00:39:02,246 --> 00:39:05,014
You know this guy?

724
00:39:07,417 --> 00:39:09,518
No.

725
00:39:09,586 --> 00:39:11,420
Who is he?

726
00:39:11,488 --> 00:39:14,824
Samuel Heller... the John Doe who died in the club fire.

727
00:39:14,892 --> 00:39:17,827
You sure you didn't see him when
you were in that back hallway?

728
00:39:17,895 --> 00:39:19,462
No.

729
00:39:19,529 --> 00:39:21,430
Well, like I told you that night,

730
00:39:21,498 --> 00:39:23,432
I was only back there for a minute.

731
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,468
And you didn't see anybody?

732
00:39:25,502 --> 00:39:27,703
Aw, jeez, it was a long time ago.

733
00:39:27,771 --> 00:39:30,172
No. I was looking for the men's room.

734
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,508
I ran into Dave Williams.

735
00:39:32,576 --> 00:39:35,011
He was coming out of the storage room... 

736
00:39:35,078 --> 00:39:37,980
Wait. You saw Dave Williams
coming out of the storage room?

737
00:39:38,048 --> 00:39:40,149
Yeah.

738
00:39:40,217 --> 00:39:42,685
Didn't I tell you that before?

739
00:39:42,753 --> 00:39:44,720
I thought it was the bathroom,

740
00:39:44,788 --> 00:39:47,323
but Dave pointed me in the right direction.

741
00:39:48,892 --> 00:39:52,028
And right after that, somebody locked you in.

742
00:39:52,095 --> 00:39:55,998
Come on. You don't think Dave did that.

743
00:39:56,066 --> 00:40:00,036
I don't know. He have any reason to harm you?

744
00:40:00,103 --> 00:40:02,471
No.

745
00:40:02,539 --> 00:40:04,440
We're friends.

746
00:40:04,508 --> 00:40:07,009
He's one of the nicest guys I've ever met.

747
00:40:09,546 --> 00:40:12,315
Well, thank you for your time, Mr. Braddock.

748
00:40:12,382 --> 00:40:16,385
I'm sorry I couldn't be more help.

749
00:40:17,988 --> 00:40:21,524
How many times we talk to this Williams guy?

750
00:40:21,591 --> 00:40:24,226
Oh, I don't know. Four?

751
00:40:24,294 --> 00:40:28,531
He ever mention anything about being in that storage room?

752
00:40:28,598 --> 00:40:30,933
He did not.

753
00:40:47,617 --> 00:40:50,186
And I'm gonna catch a fish this big.

754
00:40:50,253 --> 00:40:52,888
Well, if you do, we're gonna clean it

755
00:40:52,956 --> 00:40:56,659
and serve it up for dinner.
And if I don't, can we eat the worms?

756
00:40:56,727 --> 00:40:59,362
Just make sure he catches a fish.

757
00:40:59,429 --> 00:41:02,398
Hey, Mike, I got something for you.

758
00:41:02,466 --> 00:41:05,568
It's a video from our band, one of our early rehearsals.

759
00:41:05,635 --> 00:41:07,803
Man, do I even want to see this?

760
00:41:07,871 --> 00:41:09,805
Yeah. We weren't half bad.

761
00:41:09,873 --> 00:41:12,775
Don't watch it till you get back from your honeymoon. Okay?

762
00:41:12,843 --> 00:41:15,644
Will do. Thanks.

763
00:41:15,712 --> 00:41:18,447
Okay.

764
00:41:18,515 --> 00:41:20,783
Bye, Mike.

765
00:41:20,851 --> 00:41:22,518
Have a nice wedding.

766
00:41:22,586 --> 00:41:24,253
Thanks.

767
00:41:36,633 --> 00:41:39,301
You take good care of my boy, okay?

768
00:41:39,369 --> 00:41:42,071
You can count on me.

769
00:42:13,412 --> 00:42:14,412
