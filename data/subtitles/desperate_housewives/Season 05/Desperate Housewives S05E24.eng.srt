1
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:10,500
The first thing Lila Dash thought about

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,530
that fateful morning was her husband Dave.

3
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:19,530
It occurred to her she should buy him a new tie.

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:26,130
She thought of her husband again that afternoon...

5
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:31,330
And decided she would make him something special for dinner.

6
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:37,330
That evening, Lila once again thought about her husband...

7
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:40,300
And she asked herself what she had done

8
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,130
to deserve someone

9
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,000
so wonderful.

10
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:51,000
Hey, you. What are you thinking about?

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,300
Nothin'.

12
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,400
So what do you say we all go out for ice cream?

13
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,200
Oh, I'd love to, but I brought work home.

14
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,600
Again?

15
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,600
I know. I'm so boring.

16
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,260
Hey, why don't you two go?

17
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,630
No. We'll all go tomorrow.

18
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,600
Now how can you make this face wait a whole day for ice cream?

19
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,330
Look sad.

20
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,160
Yeah. Oh!

21
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,630
Oh, fine.

22
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:22,130
I'll take her now.

23
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:24,430
Come on, sweetie.

24
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:29,430
Hey, how about tomorrow night,

25
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,930
I'll leave my briefcase at the office,

26
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:35,360
and we do something special, just the three of us?

27
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,060
It's a date.

28
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:52,460
But there would be no tomorrows for Lila and Paige Dash...

29
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:56,460
Because that was the night they crashed...

30
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,830
Into Susan and Mike Delfino.

31
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,160
The last thing Lila Dash thought about before she died

32
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,200
was her husband Dave.

33
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,960
She wondered what her death would do to him.

34
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:30,930
Luckily for Lila,

35
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,760
she would never know.

36
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,430
There was a wedding recently

37
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:51,600
at Fairview presbyterian church.

38
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,060
The minister spoke about the nature of marriage

39
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,560
and then said what all ministers say

40
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,430
to conclude such matters.

41
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:05,330
You may now kiss the bride.

42
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,460
It was then the church bells began to ring,

43
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:15,030
telling brides-to-be everywhere

44
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:18,230
their turn was next.

45
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,500
Hello, groom.

46
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,130
Guess what?

47
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,130
I called the hotel to tell them we were getting married.

48
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,100
They promised to upgrade us to a suite

49
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,500
and have champagne on ice.

50
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,000
- Isn't that terrific?  - Yeah. Yeah, that's great.

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,030
Wo I hope you can muster up a little more enthusiasm

52
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,230
for the "I dos."

53
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,860
I'm sorry. I'm just thinking about Susan and M.J.

54
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,430
Why?

55
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,930
Well, when they left, I just got a weird vibe from Dave.

56
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:48,460
Dave always gives off a weird vibe. That's just Dave.

57
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,460
No, I think I should call them.

58
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:53,160
Or maybe you should get our bags in the car

59
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,200
so we don't miss our flight? Because if we miss our flight,

60
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,160
we're going to miss our wedding day,

61
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,200
and if we miss our wedding day,

62
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,660
we're gonna miss our wedding night.

63
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,700
Yeah, you're right.

64
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,260
I'm probably worried about nothing. I'll load the car.

65
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,300
Uh, we need to stop at the store.

66
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:16,100
I have to get videotape for the camera. Oh, I got some old ones in the desk.

67
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,900
Just grab one. We'll record over it.

68
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,760
She's two blocks away. She'll be here any second.

69
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,360
Great. 

70
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,330
Are you nervous?

71
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:35,330
Why would I be nervous?

72
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,830
Well, you're about to have a teenager in the house.

73
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,800
Well, I didn't say I wasn't sedated.

74
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,000
Yeah, I'm a little freaked out, too.

75
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,100
But we're doing the right thing.

76
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,100
Yeah, when I think about everything

77
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,100
that little girl's been through...

78
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,400
Her dad walked out, her mother's in jail,

79
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,600
the way she bounced from relative to relative...

80
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,700
- I just want this to be the end of the line for her.  - Me, too.

81
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,860
Mommy, here comes the taxi!

82
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,330
I wonder if she'll even remember me.

83
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:05,760
Oh, I doubt it. You haven't seen her since she was 6.

84
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,230
Yeah, and when she was little, I used to spend a lot of time

85
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:12,060
with her and her dad before he left.

86
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,060
I remember taking her on the swings at the park.

87
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,060
I remember buying her ice cream.

88
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,600
- I remember giving her piggyback rides.  - Ohh.

89
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,530
I don't remember that.

90
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:38,130
- You told him about the divorce?  - I had to. He found the storage unit.

91
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,800
He wanted an explanation.

92
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,960
I was in such a state of shock,

93
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,100
I couldn't think of anything else to say.

94
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,060
- Bree, this isn't good.  - You have no idea.

95
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,560
Now he's saying if I try to divorce him,

96
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,130
he can go to the police and report me.

97
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:55,100
- Report you? For what?  - Filing a false insurance claim.

98
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,100
He's the one who filed it,

99
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,700
but he's gonna say that I told him to.

100
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,830
- Oh, crap.  - I told him I don't love him. He said he doesn't care.

101
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,830
He wants us to work on our marriage.

102
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:07,330
Oh, wow. Well, clearly, the guy's a little crazy.

103
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:10,930
A little? The man put chives in my parisian salad!

104
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:13,160
He should be in a straightjacket!

105
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:17,060
Okay, calm down. This isn't the end of the world.

106
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,060
Isn't it?

107
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:22,030
I'm being blackmailed by a man I'm starting to despise,

108
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:24,030
and if I don't pretend to love him,

109
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:26,230
he can have me arrested.

110
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,600
Bree...

111
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,530
I don't want you to worry about this.

112
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,600
We're gonna think of something.

113
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,230
What can we think of? He's holding all the cards.

114
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:44,030
Trust me. None ever holds all the cards.

115
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,300
Lynette, get down here!

116
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,660
- What's going on?  - I just got off the phone with the university.

117
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,330
- Mm-hmm?  - I'm in!

118
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,330
Really?! You passed the test?!

119
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:15,330
Not only did I pass the test,

120
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,330
your genius husband scored in the top 5%,

121
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,500
Drunk out of his mind!

122
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,800
Oh!

123
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,200
Which, by the way, I am not condoning... ever.

124
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,630
Congrats, dad!

125
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,530
Thank you, baby. Mwah!

126
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,530
I can help you study if you want.

127
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm not sure how much help you're gonna be.

128
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,460
I'm majoring in Chinese.

129
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:37,660
I know how to say "take me to a strip bar" in mandarin.

130
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,330
I'm so proud.

131
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,800
Porter, aren't you gonna congratulate your father?

132
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,030
Congratulations on ruining my life.

133
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:47,030
If you see me on campus,

134
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:49,560
You're not allowed to talk to me.

135
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,260
Okay, that's everyone.

136
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,830
This calls for hot fudge sundaes.

137
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,230
Everybody... In the car!

138
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,830
Okay. Ohh! Mwah!

139
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:02,200
- You coming?  - Uh, I'm gonna make a quick phone call,

140
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,430
- and I'll be right out.  - Okay.

141
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Hi. This is Lynette Scavo.

142
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,500
May I please speak to Dr. Rushton?

143
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,160
Tell him it's important.

144
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,830
Hi. Dr. Rushton,

145
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:25,060
I need to come in and see you as soon as possible.

146
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,660
I think the cancer's back.

147
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,260
Mommy, can I have a juice box?

148
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,360
Oh, sweetie. You just had one,

149
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,400
and we don't want to have to stop ten times

150
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,660
so you can go to the bathroom.

151
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,360
I miss diapers.

152
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,400
Oh, the joys of being a parent.

153
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,860
Yeah, I remember.

154
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,830
You do?

155
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:58,160
I had a little girl.

156
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,630
She died.

157
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:02,160
Oh, my god. I...

158
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,360
I... I had no idea. I'm so sorry.

159
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,100
That's okay.

160
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,760
I'm learning to deal with it.

161
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,830
- I can't believe Edie gave you a key.  - Why not? She trusted me.

162
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,830
And I only used it when I was out of milk or bread...

163
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:22,230
or cash.

164
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,730
Okay, look for anything that could tie Dave to Dr. Heller.

165
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:31,800
Look through his files, his papers, even his trash.

166
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,260
Roberta, what are you doing?

167
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:39,100
- We're trying to catch a murderer.  - I know, but before I get to the bottom of that,

168
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,100
I'd like to get to the bottom of this.

169
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,060
Oh, look! 

170
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,560
Oh! Muscle relaxers... score!

171
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,260
Put that back! They're not yours.

172
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:51,730
Yeah, apparently, they're not his either. Who's David Dash?

173
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,630
Mr. Williams? It's the police.

174
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:57,200
- Oh!  - Oh, cheese it!

175
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,160
We need to ask you a few questions.

176
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,160
Please tell me

177
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,160
- you doesn't have anything illegal on you.  - I do, but it's hidden.

178
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,400
And if they find it, we got a lawsuit. 

179
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,560
Ladies?

180
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:13,500
Open up, please.

181
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:25,730
- Uh, hi there.  - Can I help you?

182
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:28,200
Well, I hope so. Are you Orson Hodge?

183
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,700
Yes, I am. You are... 

184
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,760
You want me to let go?

185
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,560
You want me to let go?

186
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,660
Yeah.

187
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,060
There, I let go.

188
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,230
- Now you gotta do the same.  - I don't know what you mean.

189
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,830
Oh, I think you do, and I am dead serious.

190
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:54,260
If you don't let go... 

191
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,800
Next time, neither will I.

192
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,630
Brought you a laundry basket.

193
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:08,460
You need me to show you how to use the washer?

194
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,500
It's my clever way of saying

195
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,560
You're gonna be doing your own laundry.

196
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,000
Oh. Okay.

197
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,960
You know, the girls have chores, too.

198
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,100
It's how we teach them responsibility.

199
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,830
Speaking of which, uh...

200
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:27,860
curfew's 10:00, 11:00 on weekends.

201
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,760
Does that seem reasonable?

202
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,630
Sure. No problem.

203
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,100
Hmm.

204
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,000
This teenager thing isn't so bad.

205
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,360
So what are my other chores?

206
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,330
Oh, well, not to push my luck,

207
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:42,830
But I was thinking you could sweep the front porch

208
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:45,200
and take care of the guest bathroom.

209
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,600
You got it.

210
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,460
Oh, that's a pretty dress.

211
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,830
Oh, my god, it's Versace!

212
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:57,130
Yeah. It's all right.

213
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:01,160
"all right"? Young lady, if you live under my roof,

214
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,160
You will not disparage Versace.

215
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,900
Sorry.

216
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,330
No, I'm just kidding. It was a joke.

217
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:10,130
Oh. Funny.

218
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:13,860
Well, I guess I'm gonna get started on my laundry.

219
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,930
Vera Wang!

220
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:18,930
Where are you getting all these dresses?

221
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,600
They were gifts.

222
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,330
You know, from boyfriends.

223
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:25,030
Boyfriends? How many do you have?

224
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:28,100
Not as many as I used to. I had to make some cutbacks.

225
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:32,300
Yeah, the economy has hit us all.

226
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,030
So...

227
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:37,230
What kind of boyfriends can afford things like this?

228
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,930
They're college guys

229
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:41,330
With rich parents who can pay for everything.

230
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:45,330
Uh... huh. And so... they give you designer clothes,

231
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,800
and you give them...

232
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,800
The pleasure of my company.

233
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,800
Yeah. Okay, well...

234
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,800
Don't take this the wrong way,

235
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,230
but that's not exactly from the Versace virgin line.

236
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,260
I don't have to do anything.

237
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,800
They just have to think I might.

238
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,160
Uh... huh, and how long do you think that will last?

239
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,900
Till 10:00, 11:00 on the weekends.

240
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,930
Just kidding. It was a joke.

241
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:14,460
Oh.

242
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,760
Funny.

243
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,660
Are you all right?

244
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:34,530
What happened to your shirt?

245
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:37,360
Why don't you ask your friend?

246
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,730
The one you hired to assault me.

247
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:42,800
You were assaulted?

248
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,760
He, uh...

249
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,260
Grabbed me by the throat, threw me to the ground

250
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,260
And told me to "let go."

251
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,930
Your message came through loud and clear.

252
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:54,800
I had nothing to do with that.

253
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,230
Oh, please.

254
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:59,930
Who else would have done it?

255
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,300
I don't know.

256
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,800
But I swear to you, we may have our differences,

257
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,130
But I would never hire someone to attack you.

258
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:14,260
You have to believe me.

259
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,730
I do.

260
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,230
Forgive me.

261
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:25,000
I should've known you could never hurt me.

262
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,530
I'll stay.

263
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,360
What?

264
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,000
Once I've unpacked, I'll bring you my shirt so you can mend it.

265
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,330
We're just running to the store, ana. We'll be back in a bit.

266
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:53,460
- Okay. I'll sweep the porch while you're gone.  - And if you don't mind,

267
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,760
will you make sure Juanita and Celia do their chores, too?

268
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,200
Sure thing.

269
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,960
I got the rest, Babe.

270
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,900
All right, I'll see you inside.

271
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,700
Oh, you're back.

272
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,760
Oh, my god.

273
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,060
Ana, the house is so clean.

274
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,030
Just wanted to do my part.

275
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:29,530
Well, how did you get everything done so quickly?

276
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,430
Well... 

277
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,130
We finished upstairs, Ana. Anything else you need done?

278
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,600
They wanted to hang out, but I had chores to do,

279
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,660
so they insisted on helping me.

280
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,330
Aren't they sweet?

281
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:51,000
Hey, um, I'm not bragging and I don't recommend it,

282
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,730
But you could so eat out of your downstairs toilet.

283
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:57,200
Okay, boys, thanks for your hard work,

284
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,200
But maybe it's time to go home and take a shower...

285
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,260
Preferably a cold one.

286
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,800
Bye, Preston.

287
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,500
- I'm Porter.  - I'm Preston.

288
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,760
- Oh, you can call me whatever you want.  - All right.

289
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,600
Mommy, it was so cool.

290
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,600
Ana got the boys to do my chores, too.

291
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,330
Did she?

292
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:23,560
I wanna learn how to make boys do stuff. Can you teach me?

293
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,560
Uh, okay, Juanita, go to your room.

294
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,130
And don't come out until you're 18.

295
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,960
Is something wrong?

296
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:34,030
Ana, the whole point of chores is that you do them.

297
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:36,800
You don't bat your eyes and call rent-a-horny-kid.

298
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,330
The house is clean. Why do you care how it got that way?

299
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:43,300
I care about the message it sends to my little girls,

300
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,760
- and I'm starting to care a little bit about your tone.  - Oh, I'm sorry.

301
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:50,130
How do you like your housekeepers to speak to you?

302
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:54,800
And the teenager has finally arrived.

303
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,500
Ana, listen.

304
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,460
We want you to be part of this family.

305
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:01,430
We will love you and support you and take care of you,

306
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,100
but in exchange,

307
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:06,100
You will show us a little bit of respect and obey our rules,

308
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,200
which means doing your own chores,

309
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,830
no boys in the house and no more gifts from men.

310
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,160
I get it now.

311
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,060
You're jealous.

312
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,400
Of what?

313
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,730
Of me.

314
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:25,400
You're not young anymore.

315
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,360
You can't get guys to do things for you,

316
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,800
and that drives you crazy.

317
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,000
You wanna see crazy?

318
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,960
Make one more statement like that,

319
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,960
and I am throwing your ass out on the street.

320
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,260
You care to test me?

321
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:02,800
Ana? What's wrong?

322
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:07,260
I don't know what I did. She wants to kick me out.

323
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,930
So she had a couple boys come over and do her chores.

324
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,930
You've been doing stuff like that your whole life.

325
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:17,900
- That's not the point! You didn't hear the way she talked to me!  - I don't care!

326
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:21,000
You don't tell a kid who's been bounced around her whole life

327
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,360
- that you're gonna throw her out on the street!  - I didn't tell her that!

328
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,500
I just... Kind of threatened to.

329
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,100
Bottom line... she is my niece, and she is not going anywhere.

330
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,800
You're the adult, Gaby. Start acting like it.

331
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,960
I know this looks bad,

332
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,360
but we did what we did for a good reason.

333
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,100
Ma'am, you can't break into a person's house for any reason.

334
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,960
Uh, what if there's a baby inside and there's a fire?

335
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,630
Well...

336
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:59,360
See? Everything's not all cut and dry, is it, rookie?

337
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,330
Roberta, don't piss him off.

338
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:04,730
You can't take a club to the head like you used to.

339
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,160
Okay, I just got off the phone with Heller's secretary.

340
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,500
David Dash was definitely a patient there.

341
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,760
- Well, that's why we couldn't make the match.  - Mm-hmm.

342
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,730
- He changed his last name. And get this.  - Mm-hmm.

343
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:18,730
He's the same guy whose wife and daughter

344
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:21,560
- were killed in that car crash up on Canterbury road.  - Canterbury road!

345
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,230
I remember that accident.

346
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:26,330
My neighbors Mike and Susan were in the car that hit 'em.

347
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,400
Oh, wait. Now wait. Okay, that's quite weird.

348
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,430
I mean, why would Dave move onto the same street

349
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:32,860
as the people who killed his family?

350
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:42,030
The doctor has your results. He'll be here in a minute.

351
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,760
Do you know what they are?

352
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:50,100
You'll need to talk to the doctor about that.

353
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:54,000
Come on. I know you know. It's cancer again. Am I right?

354
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,660
I honestly don't know.

355
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:58,860
Now please, he'll just be a moment.

356
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,960
If it's cancer, and I find out you knew,

357
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,260
I won't be dying alone.

358
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,160
Hello, Lynette.

359
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,500
Hi.

360
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,500
Well, I'm glad you came in. We got the results back,

361
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,530
and the test did pick something up.

362
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:18,930
So it is the cancer.

363
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:20,860
Oh, god, I can't go through this again!

364
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,060
No, no, no. It's nothing like that.

365
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,600
You're pregnant.

366
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,200
Excuse me?

367
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,900
About six weeks or so.

368
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:37,530
Are you sure it's not cancer?

369
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,130
Okay, Susan.

370
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:44,100
But when you're out on the boat, make sure you put on sunscreen.

371
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:47,330
And on your feet, too. Remember our trip to Mexico?

372
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,860
Okay, I'll talk to you guys later.

373
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,730
Everything's fine.

374
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:57,530
I don't know what I was worried about.

375
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,900
Are you sure you wanna do this?

376
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,900
Do what?

377
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,860
Go to Vegas, get married.

378
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,660
I mean, it is a whole weekend away from Susan.

379
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,660
Katherine, I told you.

380
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:16,400
- I just wanted to make sure M.J. was okay.  - Why don't you just admit it?

381
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,860
- You're still hung up on her.  - Oh, for god sake, are we gonna do this again?

382
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,960
All I know is, it's our wedding day,

383
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,930
and you were in a crappy mood

384
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:26,660
until you talked to your ex-wife.

385
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,360
Katherine, I wouldn't be sitting here

386
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,730
if I didn't want to marry you. Okay?

387
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,130
Really?

388
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,460
Do I need to shout it out in the airport?

389
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,830
- You wouldn't do that.  - Oh, I will.

390
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:44,400
- I'll... I'll do whatever I need to, to prove my love!  - No, it's okay!

391
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,460
You convinced me.

392
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,960
I am dying for a cappuccino. You want one?

393
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,330
Yeah, I do.

394
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:58,930
You said it. "I do."

395
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:01,130
Can't take it back now.

396
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:04,700
... should be allowed to just... Walk away.

397
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,560
I know some people will wonder,

398
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:11,930
why didn't I just kill Susan?

399
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:14,660
But what good would that have done?

400
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,960
She'd be dead. There'd be no... suffering.

401
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,960
And to those of you who hate me

402
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,800
Because I took the life of an innocent, young boy,

403
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,030
I say...

404
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:30,260
Katherine!

405
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,800
Excuse me.

406
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,030
That woman I was with? Tell her I had to go. It's an emergency.

407
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:52,160
Oh, uh, your friend asked me to tell you he had to leave.

408
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,330
What?

409
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:57,260
He said to say he's sorry.

410
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:15,130
- What were you thinking?  - First, tell me if it worked,

411
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:16,930
then I'll tell you what I was thinking.

412
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:20,960
Don't be glib. Did you hire someone to attack Orson?

413
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,300
Yes.

414
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,200
Are you insane? Your thug tried to strangle him.

415
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,260
If he had tried to strangle him, he'd be dead.

416
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:30,560
Look, Orson had the upper hand in this divorce.

417
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,560
- We needed to regain it.  - Not by resorting to physical violence.

418
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:38,200
- I would never have given my permission for that.  - That's why I didn't ask you.

419
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,330
W... what's your beef here, Bree?

420
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:43,500
My beef is that from the minute I walked into this office,

421
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,560
You have pulled me deeper and deeper

422
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,730
Into your moral cesspool. That is not why I hired you.

423
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,300
Please. That is exactly why you hired me.

424
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:55,300
Face it. You were tired of being a good girl.

425
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,800
You knew it was time to play dirty.

426
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,800
I wanted to protect what was mine.

427
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,800
You have turned me into someone I don't recognize.

428
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,600
And you've loved every minute of it.

429
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,100
- No, I haven't.  - Yes, you have!

430
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:09,000
And so have I.

431
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,460
Because the truth is,

432
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,960
I think you're the most fascinating woman

433
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,060
That I have ever met.

434
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,530
What?

435
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,260
Karl... 

436
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:26,300
If I have not been clear about how I feel about you,

437
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,260
I apologize for any ambiguity.

438
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:31,660
Understand this... I detest you.

439
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:35,230
No, you don't. I can see it in your eyes.

440
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:38,200
You want me to walk over there and pull you up against me

441
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,230
And kiss you until your knees buckle.

442
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,300
You're fired.

443
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:47,400
Good. That keeps this from being a breach of ethics.

444
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,630

Hey! Hey, where are you? Are you with Dave?

449
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:28,030
Uh, yeah. We are in the car, singing.

450
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:30,930
All right, Susan, listen to me. Do not react

451
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:33,930
- To what I'm about to tell you.  - Wow.

452
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:37,460
- This sounds really...  - Susan! Do you understand me?

453
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,130
Okay.

454
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:43,030
Dave's real name is David Dash.

455
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:46,500
- He's the husband of the woman we killed in the accident.  - Oh, my god.

456
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,900
Don't react!

457
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,660
Uh... Problem?

458
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:55,260
Uh... That sucks.

459
00:25:55,260 --> 00:26:00,300
- How could they cancel your flight?  - All right, you guys are in danger.

460
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,800
Just get away from him. Go to a gas station, a store...

461
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,530
Anyplace there's people. I'm on my way.

462
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,000
Right.

463
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,260
So how long do you think you'll be delayed?

464
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,300
Uh, I'm a half-hour from the lake.

465
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,800
I'm calling the cops right now. Just get away from him.

466
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,100
Get out of that car and get away from Dave.

467
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:20,660
- And you call me the second you do.  - Okay.

468
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,830
Um... Well, I hope you get there soon.

469
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:25,300
Bumped his flight?

470
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:28,260
- Yeah.  - Oh, what a drag.

471
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,400
Mm. Okay, from the top.

Maybe we should stretch our legs.

477
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,060
Ah, we're almost there. Let's keep going.

478
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,160
Aren't you hungry, though?

479
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,760
Maybe there's a restaurant up ahead.

480
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,400
I really don't want to stop, Susan.

481
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,760
Okay.

482
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,660
It's no big deal.

483
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,930
Hon! 

484
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:26,530
Look what I got for college. I got pens. I got notebooks.

485
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:29,530
Ooh, I got an English to Mandarin dictionary

486
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:30,200
'Cause you never know

487
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,930
when you might need a... 

488
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:35,830
Oh, and look at this.

489
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,600
Check it out.

490
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,430
They're scented. You wanna smell grape?

491
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:45,600
What? They're... 

492
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,660
Like candy.

493
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,160
I went to the doctor today.

494
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:52,530
What's wrong?

495
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:55,200
I'm pregnant.

496
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,330
Pregnant?

497
00:27:58,330 --> 00:27:59,960
With a baby?

498
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,500
How long have you been sniffing those markers?

499
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,460
Of course with a baby.

500
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:07,100
But you can't. I mean... W... we can't.

501
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,930
W... we're old!

502
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:11,460
Well, apparently, not old engh.

503
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,730
What am I gonna do about school?

504
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:22,060
What am I gonna do about my job?

505
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,930
We're gonna have another baby.

506
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:34,700
Actually, I have an addendum to that.

507
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,360
Please tell me you're about to recite the girl scout oath.

508
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,130
No, Tom.

509
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:44,260
We're having twins...

510
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,560
Again.

511
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:56,900
I have to go potty.

512
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,200
Okay, sweetie.

513
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,260
Do you mind pulling over at the next rest stop?

514
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:05,200
- We're almost there, buddy. Can you hold it?  - No. I really have to go.

515
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:11,660
Fine.

516
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:14,160
Just hold on a few more minutes.

517
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,260
Oh. Um...

518
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,500
Here?

519
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,530
He... he can't go here.

520
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,800
Come on, M.J. Let's go.

521
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,630
Um, can't we find a gas station or maybe a diner?

522
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:30,600
He's a big boy. He can use the bushes.

523
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,630
- Okay. Here, M.J. Wait for me.  - Don't go too far.

524
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,860
Hello?

525
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,660
Dave, detective Collins with the Fairview P.D.

526
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,330
We know everything.

527
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:46,030
- I... I'm sorry. What are you...  - Heller, your wife, your child. All of it.

528
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:49,000
If you come in now, I'll do everything I can to help you.

529
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,260
But let's end this before someone gets hurt. 

530
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,330
Keys.

531
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:02,160
Keys... Oh.

532
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:17,460
Aah!

533
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,530
Aah! M.J., run!

534
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:22,230
Come on, honey! Let's run! Let's run!

535
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:24,460
Why are we running?

536
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:26,460
We're playing a game with Dave, okay?

537
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:29,930
So run as fast as you can.

538
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:31,930
Are you okay?

539
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:34,500
Aah! Ow! I'm fine.

540
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,860
Susan! M.J.!

541
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,360
Okay, listen.

542
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,500
It's really important that you win this game.

543
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,560
So I want you to find a good hiding place,

544
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,560
And even if you hear Dave,

545
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,700
You don't come out no matter what, okay? Okay? 

546
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,760
Don't worry. I'm gonna hide, too. Now go.

547
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,160
Go!

548
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,360
Where is he?

549
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:05,630
You are not gonna mess this up!

550
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:08,630
- Aah! Aah!  - We are too close to the finish line!

551
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:12,260
Now call him!

552
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:15,130
Call him.

553
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,730
M.J.!

554
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,330
Don't come out! 

555
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,900
M.J.!

556
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:36,030
You wanna go fishing, don't you, buddy?

557
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:39,030
Well, if you don't come out now, we're gonna get there too late!

558
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:42,430
I'll let you drive the boat!

559
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,830
Okay, if you don't come out right now,

560
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:53,300
We're gonna leave without you.

561
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:57,400
You don't wanna be in this scary graveyard after dark, do ya?

562
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:03,460
All right, M.J.,

563
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,730
We're leaving!

564
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,900
Mommy, wake up. I get to drive the boat.

565
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:37,060
Now keep the volume really high.

566
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:40,100
You don't wanna hear all the boring grown-up talk.

567
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,330
Buckle up.

568
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,400
What are you gonna do to us?

569
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,860
Shut up. I'm trying to think.

570
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:07,260
Dave, please...

571
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:11,400
I'm so sorry about that accident.

572
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,200
You don't wanna hurt M.J. or me.

573
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,900
- You're a good person. I know you.  - Don't analyze me.

574
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:22,530
The last guy who tried that didn't do so well.

575
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,930
Well, you won't get away with it.

576
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:30,760
- Mike already called the cops. They're on their way.  - Enough!

577
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:40,230
Susan? Where are you?

578
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:42,360
Not up at the lake.

579
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,400
- You kind of screwed up my plans here, Mike.  - Mike!

580
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,560
Oh, and, uh, Susan says hello.

581
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,830
Okay, Dave, take it easy.

582
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,860
You aren't revenge?

583
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,760
Let Susan and M.J. go. Take me instead.

584
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,960
How does it feel, Mike,

585
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,500
to know that you can't save the people that you love?

586
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,430
Hopeless?

587
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:09,460
Like your entire life has no meaning?

588
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:12,800
Dave, please.

589
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,800
I... I can't be that far behind you. I'm on route 12.

590
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,960
You're on route 12?

591
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,360
Yeah. Yeah, come on.

592
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,700
You don't wanna hurt them. Let me be the one.

593
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:28,200
You're right. You should be the one.

594
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,760
So we've got a deal?

595
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:35,300
If I see one cop car, they're both dead.

596
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:38,830
No cops. You just tell me where to meet you.

597
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:40,500
Keep heading south.

598
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,460
There's an abandoned gas station

599
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:45,200
Past the intersection of route 12 and Canterbury road.

600
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:48,730
Canterbury road? That's where we...

601
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:51,030
Yeah, it is.

602
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,630
Look familiar?

603
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:08,030
What are you gonna do to us?

604
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:10,100
Why did you bring us here?

605
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:13,430
I thought it would be poetic.

606
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:16,930
Mike should be here any minute.

607
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:19,560
Dave, please. Don't hurt Mike.

608
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,230
It wasn't his fault.

609
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:25,830
No. It was your fault.

610
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:28,730
But he wants to be the hero, so...

611
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,630
Get out. 

612
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:36,500
I'm not leaving M.J.

613
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:40,500
M.J.'s coming. I need send you up first. Get out.

614
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,430
Now.

615
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:50,430
Try not to scare M.J. when you bring him here.

616
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:53,130
Actually, change of plans. 

617
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:54,430
What?

618
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:56,930
M.J.'s staying with me.

619
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:59,430
He and I are gonna pull into that intersection

620
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:03,100
Just as Mike comes barreling down that road.

621
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,060
Oh, my God.

622
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:07,560
And you're gonna stay there and watch

623
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,860
as Mike kills your child,

624
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:12,130
just like you killed mine.

625
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,400
I told you it was poetic.

626
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,430
Dave, please. Please.

627
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:20,430
I cannot imagine the pain you went through,

628
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:23,430
But you can't do this. You can't kill my little boy!

629
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:25,660
Shut up.

630
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:28,830
What if your daughter could see you now!

631
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:31,460
Is this how you'd want her to see you?!

632
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:35,760
As a monster who could murder an innocent child?!

633
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,330
I'm not a monster.

634
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:43,260
Dave! Dave!

635
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:53,430
You don't need that.

636
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:57,200
You're a big boy now.

637
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:21,300
Aah!

638
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,760
Aah!

639
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,700
Mike!

640
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,600
Mike! Mike!

641
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,200
Stop!

642
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,500
No! 

643
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,960
M.J.!

644
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:57,330
M.J.!

645
00:37:57,330 --> 00:38:00,800
Mama!

646
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,060
Oh, God! Are you okay?

647
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,560
Dave told me to get out of the car.

648
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,560
Oh!

649
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,000
Mike.

650
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:16,260
Mike!

651
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,800
Daddy!

652
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:50,000
So what do you say we all go out for ice cream?

653
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,730
Oh, I'd love to, but I brought work home.

654
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,130
Again?

655
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:56,160
I know. I'm so boring.

656
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,800
Hey, why don't you two go?

657
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,800
Oh, fine. I'll take her now.

658
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,260
Come on, sweetie.

659
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,800
Wait.

660
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,430
Don't go.

661
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:17,660
We have marshmallows and chocolate.

662
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,530
I can make s'mores.

663
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:22,030
Would you like that, my little princess?

664
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,560
Yeah!

665
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,630
Yeah.

666
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,830
You sure?

667
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:30,130
You said you had work.

668
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,730
It can wait.

669
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:37,530
I always have time for my girls.

670
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,300
I always have time for my girls.

671
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,260
There was a wedding recently

672
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:24,000
at Fairview presbyterian church.

673
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,430
The Minister spoke about the nature of marriage...

674
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:34,260
The sublime joy of giving birth...

675
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:43,330
The immense pleasure of raising a family...

676
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:51,530
The importance of fidelity...

677
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:59,530
and then he said what all ministers say

678
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:01,530
To conclude such matters...

679
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:04,330
You may now kiss the bride.

680
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:09,930
For a moment,

681
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:14,700
The groom wondered if he was doing the right thing.

682
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:20,060
That's when the bells began to ring,

683
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:23,030
Telling him he had.
