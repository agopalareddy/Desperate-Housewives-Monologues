1
00:00:04,627 --> 00:00:07,090
A tragic event...

2
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:09,100
Led to the end of a marriage...

3
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:10,990
He's dating a friend of mine.

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:14,330
And the complications of moving on.

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,352
Medical wonders occurred...

6
00:00:16,514 --> 00:00:19,340
If we remove that bone fragment,
you could regain your sight.

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,210
Both large and small.

8
00:00:21,434 --> 00:00:24,150
My husband has agreed to
the procedure you suggested.

9
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,630
Oh, the one to alleviate his snoring?

10
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:26,330
Detectives...

11
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:28,440
And a devastating lie was told.

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,450
The night of the fire,
i saw somebody come out.

13
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,000
His name is porter scavo.

14
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,370
One morning, it
occurred to lynette scavo

15
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:46,940
she could not rememb the last time
her family had breakfast together.

16
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:54,200
So lynette did what any mother
would do in that situation...

17
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,070
See ya later, mom.

18
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:00,970
The first person who steps foot
out that door will lose a leg.

19
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:04,930
She threatened her family with violence.

20
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,320
That was delicious.

21
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,470
But i did promise chrissy
i'd walk her to school today.

22
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,470
Oh, you are such a gentleman.

23
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,230
Sit your ass down.

24
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:23,794
Dad, make mom let me go.

25
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:28,830
Everyone at this table who thinks i have
the power to make your mom do anything,

26
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,090
raise your hand.

27
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,740
Wish i could have helped.

28
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:41,070
Look, this family has
been through a lot lately,

29
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:45,730
And your dad and i feel we'll be better parents
if we know what's going on in your lives.

30
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,430
So, Parker, how's that science
project you've been working on?

31
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,073
Can i help you?

32
00:01:53,235 --> 00:01:55,660
Is this the residence of porter scavo?

33
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,790
Yeah. Why?

34
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,220
I'm porter scavo.

35
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,457
Sir, can you step outside?
Can you step outside?

36
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:03,620
- Porter scavo, you are under arrest.
- What?

37
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,870
- You have the right to remain silent.
- Wait. What's going on?

38
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,380
Ma'am, i'm gonna have
to ask you to step back.

39
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,520
Okay, guys. Look, if this is
about warren schilling's bar,

40
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,050
Porter had nothing to do with that fire.

41
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:12,730
- Apparently, there's a witness
that says otherwise. - A witness?I...

42
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:16,520
now will you please step
back and let us do our job?

43
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,308
If you give up that right, anything you
say can and will be used against you.

44
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:22,000
A witness? What are they talking about?

45
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,310
It's gonna be okay. We'll call a lawyer.

46
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,840
We'll get through this.

47
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:45,220
Lynette scavo couldn't remember the last
time her family had breakfast together...

48
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,870
I guess we're done talking
about my science project, huh?

49
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,360
Yes, sweetie, we are.

50
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,100
And she couldn't know
it would be many years

51
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:59,350
before her family would have
breakfast together again.

55
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:14,040
It's an awful thing to live in the dark,

56
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,980
unable to see what
others take for granted.

57
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:24,430
But sometimes for a lucky few, a
flicker of light pierces that darkness

58
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:29,294
And brings with it the
promise of better days to come.

59
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,350
Do you see anything?

60
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:36,020
I see light...

61
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,870
And some fuzzy shapes.

62
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,320
That's it?

63
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,750
That's all he can expect to see right
now, but if he's able to see that much,

64
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,720
It won't be long till
his full sight returns.

65
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,400
Can you see me, babe?

66
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,800
Just your silhouette.

67
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,560
I can tell you cut your hair short.

68
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,460
It kinda makes your ears
stick out, but i like it.

69
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:58,390
Carlos, that's the
doctor. I'm right here.

70
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:02,327
It doesn't matter. I can see
something other than nothing.

71
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:04,880
Oh, this is a good day.

72
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,740
Now remember, his eyes will be very
sensitive for the next few weeks,

73
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,480
So low light indoors,
dark glasses outside...

74
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,551
Uh, doctor, we are very grateful, so
don't take this the wrong way, but...

75
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,210
Well, your septum looks great,
and you say your snoring's gone.

76
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,830
I think we're in good shape.

77
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,540
Will we need to come
in for a follow-up?

78
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,870
No. I think we're done.

79
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:36,821
You know, i always tell my patients i'm gonna
miss them, but this time, i really mean it.

80
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:41,040
Oh, we feel the same way
about you. You've been lovely.

81
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:44,990
Please excuse me.

82
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,460
- What are you doing? - Leaving
the man a thank-you card.

83
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,380
For a doctor?

84
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,970
He helped you through
a very difficult time.

85
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:56,160
The least we can do is let him
know how much we appreciate...

86
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:01,480
What the hell is this?

87
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,685
You're living with the man? Since when?

88
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,604
Um, alex moved in six months ago.

89
00:05:10,766 --> 00:05:13,330
Why the secrecy? Did
you think i'd disapprove?

90
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:17,040
The man's a doctor, for heaven
sakes. You've done better than i did.

91
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,380
That was a bit of a drive-by.

92
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:23,640
I'm just trying to understand how my son could
keep a secret like this from his own mother.

93
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,880
Mom, uh, come on.

94
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,830
I mean, since i came out, you haven't shown
the slightest interest in my love life.

95
00:05:28,992 --> 00:05:30,249
Of course i have.

96
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,970
Handing me a pamphlet on
the resurgence of gonorrhea?

97
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:35,010
That's not what i'm talking about.

98
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:39,820
Think about it. Have you even
once asked if i was dating someone?

99
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,220
Well...

100
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,650
You see? You didn't really want to know.

101
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:46,350
That's why i didn't tell you.

102
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:52,110
Well, i want to know now, so that's why i'm
having you and alex over to dinner tomorrow night.

103
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:55,280
- What?
- Yes. If he's a part of your life, i want to get to know him.

104
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,690
I think i'll serve fish.

105
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:57,880
Actually, i said it wrong.

106
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,613
Um, i-i think it's kind of cool the
way that you ignore my love life.

107
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:03,760
Nice try. Tell alex we dress for dinner.

108
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,980
Mom, please don't.

109
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:10,560
Andrew, you can't criticize my parenting and
then deny me the chance to make up for it.

110
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,250
Orson and i will expect you at 8:00.

111
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,480
Okay.

112
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,170
Are you sure you want me there, too?
I mean, after all, i'm only a dentist.

113
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:25,440
Oh, for god sakes, orson. Let it go.

114
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,870
M.J.,hurry up. Your dad's here.

115
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:36,000
Hey, katherine. What are you doing here?

116
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:42,160
Well,i'm a big zoo fan, and when mike said he
was taking M.J., i asked if i could tag along.

117
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,820
- So is that okay?
- Of course. Why wouldn't it be okay?

118
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,220
I think it's...

119
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,480
Great.

120
00:06:52,743 --> 00:06:55,540
Really, really great.

121
00:06:57,705 --> 00:06:59,610
Sweetie, good news.

122
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:01,980
Katherine's gonna go
to the zoo with you.

123
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,020
Why doesshehave to go?

124
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:10,690
Well, she and your daddy are
friends, and the more, the merrier.

125
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:13,100
I just want daddy.

126
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,660
Oh, you got me, pal.

127
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,080
Hey, we're all gonna have a great time,

128
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,690
and we'll show katherine that
funny swing the monkey goes on.

129
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:24,290
Oh, that sounds so cool.
Will you show me that?

130
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:29,700
- I guess.
- Okay. Let's go.

131
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,470
Oh, don't forget his coat.

132
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,760
I'll find some way
to get him to like me.

133
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,350
I'm sure you will.

134
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:44,040
Boy, i'll bet the gift shop
at the zoo just loves divorce.

135
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,390
So... How you doing, son?

136
00:07:54,638 --> 00:07:56,300
Not so good.

137
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,320
Okay, well, don't worry.

138
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,750
Bob here has agreed to represent you.

139
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,380
And when we're done here,
i'm going to go to the d. A.

140
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,850
And we're going to
start talking about bail.

141
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:06,690
But first, i gotta ask
you a few questions.

142
00:08:06,858 --> 00:08:08,860
- Like why do the police have a witness?
- Lynette.

143
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:13,780
The d. A. says you were spotted coming out of
the storage room right before the fire started.

144
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,350
- What gives?
- I don't know what they're talking about.

145
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,830
- I have an alibi.
- You do?

146
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,430
G-great. Great.

147
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,296
Why haven't you told anyone this?

148
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,200
It's just... So embarrassing.

149
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:30,345
You are up for manslaughter, and
you're worried about being embarrassed?

150
00:08:30,507 --> 00:08:33,250
If we can verify your story, i can
probably get the charges dropped.

151
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:36,410
We wouldn't even need
bail. So where were you?

152
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:39,140
I was at edie britt's.

153
00:08:39,308 --> 00:08:43,980
Oh, please. Tell me you're
not having sex with her, too.

154
00:08:44,186 --> 00:08:46,440
- Dad.
- What is wrong with girls your own age?

155
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,670
Do you know what i would
give to date a 17-year-old?

156
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:55,610
Okay, we're gonna talk about
that later. You were saying?

157
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,020
I'm not having sex with edie.

158
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:03,400
After i left the club, i went to her house,
but only so i could break in and steal her gun.

159
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,590
Why would you do that?

160
00:09:06,752 --> 00:09:10,520
Mr. Schilling beat up anne
and then humiliated me.

161
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:16,330
I wanted to s-scare the hell out of him
just to wipe that smug look off his face.

162
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:18,620
But when i got back to
the club, it was on fire,

163
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:23,720
So i went home and hid
the gun in mom's flour jar.

164
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,450
Anywaythat's my alibi.

165
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:31,390
Think that'll help?

166
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:36,590
- Did anyone see you do this?
- No.

167
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,460
Then this is really not an alibi.

168
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,830
It's more a confession to another crime.

169
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:51,130
- Well, you missed it.
- Missed what?

170
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,950
Porter scavo got arrested today.

171
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:56,300
I knew he set that fire.

172
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,340
- Poor lynette.
- "poor lynette," my ass.

173
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:03,360
Poor seven people who
got burned to death. Boy.

174
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,020
I wouldn't wanna be in
lynette's shoes right now.

175
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:09,120
Can you imagine what
she's going through?

176
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,860
I mean, he is her son, so
she's kind of responsible.

177
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:18,500
God, the guilt she must be feeling.

178
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:24,240
Dave, what the hell?

179
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,190
You-you're bleeding.

180
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:32,860
Okay, come on. In the house. Let's
get this cleaned up. Come here.

181
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:47,930
You're just gonna sneak it back into
edie's house? What, are you crazy?

182
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:50,050
Tom, if you're gonna freak out,
can you do that in the other room?

183
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:51,560
I'm kind of busy here.

184
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,800
What has happened to us?

185
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,340
I mean, w-we're posting bail, returning
stolen guns... when did this become our life?

186
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,590
If edie reports this gun missing,

187
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:04,860
You don't have to be the sharpest cop on the
force to figure out where to start looking,

188
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,200
and that's the last
thing we need right now.

189
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:11,700
Thank god for you, lynette. You
always know what to do in a crisis.

190
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,100
Well, i try.

191
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,670
You're my rock. Lynette.
You know that, don't you?

192
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:23,070
Tom, your rock is trying to get
fingerprints off a weapon. You mind?

193
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:26,820
Thanks.

194
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:34,200
You're home kind of
early. Is everything okay?

195
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:39,180
Go up to your room. I'll come in in a
minute. We'll talk about what happened.

196
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,060
What did happen?

197
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:45,540
Well, M. J. threw his hot
fudge sundae at katherine.

198
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,820
Seriously?

199
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,850
That's terrible. Is she okay?

200
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:53,160
Well, she's got nuts and
whipped cream all in her hair,

201
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,900
And that little plastic coconut
bowl scratched her forehead.

202
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,780
- Susan.
- I'sorry.

203
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:04,370
The... the image in my mind is probably
way funnier than what actually happened.

204
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,800
Why did M. J. do that?

205
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,710
I don't know. Katherine and i were talking
about spending christmas in bermuda,

206
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:11,540
And she said she didn't want to go, 'cause she
thinks she doesn't look good in a bathing suit,

207
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:14,700
And i said she could be on the cover
of "sports illustrated," and bam!

208
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,600
M. J. throws his dessert.

209
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,910
That's the worst thing i've ever heard.

210
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,020
Well, he is only 5.

211
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,996
No, i'm talking about
that line you fed her.

212
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,220
"Sports illustrated"?

213
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:29,080
What's the issue about,
the senior olympics?

214
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,250
I'm going to talk to M.J.

215
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:36,030
I mean, i could see her on the
cover of "menopause monthly."

216
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,130
<i>Congratulations, Carlo</i>

217
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,700
Everything is still a little blurry.

218
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,760
I can only make out,
like, shapes and shadows.

219
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:55,340
But in a week or so, everything
should be clear as a bell.

220
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,280
The whole thing's like a miracle.

221
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,580
And gaby h been so patient
through all of this.

222
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,910
She's really been an angel.

223
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,860
Damn it, carlos. What are you, a ron?

224
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,430
Ah, i hear a little
voice from heaven now.

225
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,240
Why aren't you wearing
your blackout glasses?

226
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,550
The doctor says your eyes
can't be exposed to any light.

227
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:15,630
I can only handle my husband
going blind once per marriage.

228
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,730
- Whoops. Was that my baseball?
- Yeah. I got it.

229
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:22,180
What do you think? Pretty cool, huh?

230
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,700
Uh, yeah. It's... Round.

231
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:29,640
Look at it. It was signed by lou gehrig.

232
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:39,330
Oh, looky there. Lou gehrig.

233
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:44,310
It was a gift passed down from my
grandfather to my father then to me.

234
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,370
It was? I didn't know that.

235
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:48,340
I thought it was some
stupid collectors item.

236
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:53,543
No. That's why i wouldn't let you
sell it when we were low on cash.

237
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:59,000
Uh, carlos, i think it's time
to put your eyedrops in.

238
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,780
Why don't you go do that?

239
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,680
Excuse me, ladies.

240
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,680
Oh, don't look at me that way.

241
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,230
I did what i had to do.

242
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:12,260
Gaby, you never sell a
man's autographed baseball.

243
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,360
The car needed tires.

244
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,700
How was i supposed to know he
was gonna get his sight back?

245
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,950
I mean, of all the rotten luck.

246
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:19,730
Who did you sell the ball to?

247
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:22,820
I don't know. Some italian guy.

248
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,020
Hey, mike's into baseball.

249
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:29,530
He must know someone who can track down this
lou gehrig guy and get him to sign a new one.

250
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,930
What?

251
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,100
It's okay.

252
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,290
What's going on? Is there news?

253
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:40,840
The judge just set bail.

254
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,530
Oh, thank god. How much?

255
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:45,500
- 20000.
- That's high.

256
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,000
Where are we gonna
get that kind of money?

257
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,099
I guess we'll have to tap our emergency
fund. We've got 14 grand in there.

258
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:52,394
We've got another 800
more in the christmas club.

259
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,740
Look, we'll scrape it together.

260
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,870
Oh, god. G... i gotta
get to the restaurant.

261
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,950
Lynette, can you go to the
bank and take care of that?

262
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:02,360
- Oh, sure.
- Okay. Good.

263
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,490
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

264
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,840
Okay, well, i'll notify the judge
that you intend to post bail.

265
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,590
- Wait. Slow down.
- What?

266
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:15,550
You're my lawyer, so anything i
tell you is in confidence, right?

267
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:17,168
Well, technically, i'm
porter's lawyer, so don't...

268
00:15:17,329 --> 00:15:21,220
just go with me on this. There
is no emergency fund.

269
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:26,950
I gave that mone to anne schilling so
she'd leave town, and tom has no idea.

270
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:31,890
Okay, just so i have this straight, you paid
off a potential witness to get her to flee?

271
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,220
Hey. Whose lawyer are you anyway?

272
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,450
- Again, i'm porter's... -
what am i supposed to do?

273
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:39,020
Where am i gonna get that bail money?

274
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,694
You could go to a bail bondsman,
put up the house as collateral.

275
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,990
No. The house is mortgaged to the teeth.

276
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,570
Well, there is the restaurant.

277
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:51,320
I guess i have no other choice.

278
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,520
But again, this is all in
the strictest confidence.

279
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:58,890
Remember, you are my lawyer, not tom's.

280
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,030
- Actually, lynette, i'm...
- shut up!

281
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,840
So you see, it belonged to
my husband's grandfather,

282
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:13,930
And if i don't get it back, i am
telling you, i'm gonna be in the crapper.

283
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,738
What does that mean?

284
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:29,617
Means "no way." I'm sorry.

285
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,230
Oh, please. This is important.

286
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,650
Va bene. Va bene.

287
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,430
What? What's he saying?

288
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:55,570
- He'd like to watch you dance...
- What?

289
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:58,920
On the table.

290
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:07,200
Yeah, you know what? I'm gonna have
to call a big, fat... On that one.

291
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,140
Hi, lynette.

292
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,260
So sorry about porter.

293
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,220
If there's anything that we can do...

294
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:25,860
Well, actually, i wanted to borrow edie's
yellow sweater for the, uh, arraignment.

295
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,680
Yeah. Sorry. Edie's not here.

296
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:34,460
Well, is it okay if i go up and get it?

297
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:42,563
- Yeah. Sure. Go ahead.
- Thanks.

298
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:28,710
Please. You have to leave.

299
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:33,330
This isn't a good time, okay?

300
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:36,580
Fine. I'll... i'll
come see you tomorrow.

301
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:41,540
Just know that i still love
you, and that'll never change.

302
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,980
Never change.

303
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:01,460
Well, let me start by saying, it's so nice
to see you in a social setting, dr. Cominis.

304
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,830
Oh, please. I insist
you call me alex now.

305
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:06,370
All right then, alex.

306
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:11,590
Oh, look at you two, sitting
so far apart. Scootch over.

307
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:15,520
Uh, mom, w-we... we
don't need to scootch.

308
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,640
Well, i just want you to know,
if you need to scootch, alex,

309
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,500
I am okay with scootching and...

310
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,890
The rest of it.

311
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:27,550
Uh, look, mom, as much as we
appreciate your tolerance,

312
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:31,200
uh, we can wait until
we get home to make out.

313
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:36,330
Well, i just want you boys to know that
i am comfortable with your lifestyle.

314
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:40,340
Now who would like a
strawberry daiquiri?

315
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,670
Are... are you expecting someone?

316
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:49,750
Well, orson and i thought it would be nice to
share this special occasion with some dear friends.

317
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,310
Bob and lee? What, are
you sponsoring a float?

318
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:59,790
Bree, you handle the introductions,
and i will check on dinner.

319
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:04,914
Bob hunter, lee mcdermott, i would like you to
meet andrew's new life partner, dr. Alex cominis.

320
00:20:05,076 --> 00:20:07,910
- A doctor.
- He's a plastic surgeon.

321
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,840
You hear that, bob? I like
my eyes the way they are.

322
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,060
You're so touchy.

323
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,301
- Have we met?
- Not that i recall.

324
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,720
No, we have. I-i can't
think where, though.

325
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,480
I hear the gym is a
popular meeting place.

326
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,960
No, it's not that.

327
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:28,980
My mistake. I must... i must have
you confused with someone else.

328
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,930
Dinner's ready. Shall we?

329
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,690
- Not so fast. Do you know that guy?
- Yes.

330
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:42,730
Oh, my god. You're right. It is him.

331
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:54,810
Carlos, what's wrong?

332
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:56,770
- Gaby, i can see them.
- What?

333
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,790
I can make out colors and shapes.

334
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:00,330
Everything's starting
to come into focus.

335
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:03,200
Oh, my god. That's wonderful!

336
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,990
Look at all my girls.

337
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,840
- Oh, you're right. She does look like mama.
- Oh, i told you.

338
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,480
- Daddy, ow you can watch me dance.
- I know. I can't wait.

339
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,110
Oh, it's amazing. I can make
out almost everything...

340
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,380
the fireplace, our dining table.

341
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:23,510
Where's the painting
that we bought in greece?

342
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:28,498
I had to sell it a few months ago so
i could make the mortgage. I'm sorry.

343
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,380
I don't care about things. I can see
my family. That's what's important.

344
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,370
Really? That makes me
feel so much better.

345
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:38,640
You wouldn't believe all the stupid
things i've been worried about.

346
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,500
Like what?

347
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:43,030
Oh, it's silly. I sold
that baseball of yours.

348
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:47,070
But you're right. You can see,
and that's all that matters.

349
00:21:47,345 --> 00:21:50,070
You sold my lou gehrig baseball?

350
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,980
Yeah, but it's just a thing.

351
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,710
- We don't care about things.
- Right, right.

352
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:57,920
But it was my father's and
his father's before him.

353
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:01,330
Yeah, and i know that now, but...

354
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,690
Juanita, dance for your dad.

355
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,840
Juanita, actually, why don't you take your sister
and, uh, go to the kitchen and get some cookies?

356
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,600
I'll be there in a minute.

357
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:24,610
This is a very special day for
all of us, so i'm not gonna get mad.

358
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:28,830
Uh, i'm just gonna say that i don't know what
was going through that featherhead of yours,

359
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,120
But i want that baseball back.

360
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,560
Got it?

361
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,110
Hey, this featherhead kept this
family afloat for five years.

362
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,483
You have no idea what i had to do
to keep this roof over our heads.

363
00:22:37,645 --> 00:22:41,070
Look, there were two things that i asked
you not to sell... my baseball and my watch.

364
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,160
I didn't sell your watch.

365
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,120
Only because you couldn't get
it off my wrist, you little thief.

366
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,880
Gaby, you lied.

367
00:22:47,112 --> 00:22:50,410
I want that baseball
back, and you're gonna get it.

368
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:53,400
And you might want to
lower the middle finger.

369
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,940
I can see now, remember?

370
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:58,820
Right. Damn.

371
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:09,540
Bree, that was hands-down the best
dinner i've ever had in my life.

372
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,950
You are so sweet.

373
00:23:11,179 --> 00:23:13,854
You know, bree is the number
one caterer in fairview.

374
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:16,240
Oh, that's right.

375
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,210
Do you do weddings?

376
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:21,120
I wasn't gonna say anything.

377
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,290
Say anything about what?

378
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:25,300
Uh, nothing.

379
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,390
Nothing.

380
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:31,820
We're gonna have to tell them sometime.

381
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:36,150
Oh, my goodness, are you two...

382
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:38,250
Yes, yes. We're...

383
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:40,860
We're getting married.

384
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:43,758
And i hate you.

385
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:46,190
Oh, my god.

386
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,360
Congratulations.

387
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,030
Oh, my god.

388
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,540
See how excited they are?

389
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,130
Why would you wanna keep it a secret?

390
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:55,280
I am gonna handle
everything for this wedding.

391
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,313
That's why.

392
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,930
Now let me give my
new son-in-law a hug.

393
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,870
Butt out.

394
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:12,180
Well, if you'll excuse me, i am going to
go get a pie that you are going to love.

395
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,900
And you two are going to help me.

396
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:24,830
All right, you two, what is going on?

397
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:25,760
What are you talking about?

398
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,630
Don't give me that.

399
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,360
You've been whispering
to each other all night.

400
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,730
You obviously know alex.

401
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:31,100
How?

402
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,850
It's not important.

403
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:34,570
The man is going to marry my son.

404
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:40,680
If there is something about him i
should know, i want to hear it now, please.

405
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,980
We think we saw him in...

406
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,640
An adult movie.

407
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:51,030
By "adult," you mean
complex and sophisticated?

408
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:53,470
No, we mean gay porn.

409
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:54,470
What?

410
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:56,690
We saw this movie,"rear deployment."

411
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:57,900
All the actors played soldiers.

412
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,090
Bob likes uniforms, so...

413
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:00,610
Oh, thank you.

414
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:02,250
No, no, no. This can't possibly be true.

415
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:03,640
The man is a doctor.

416
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,140
Are you sure?

417
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,060
Well, we might be wrong.

418
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,350
No.

419
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:09,460
We rented it last month.

420
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:12,260
We paid the late charges.

421
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,500
Trust me. That's him.

422
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:24,960
*****guarantee if it's gonna
break after four months.

423
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:29,020
Or maybe you used your corkscrew as much in
four months as most people do in a lifetime.

424
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,850
Ever think of that?

425
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:34,580
Your mommy lashes out at
people prettier than she is.

426
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,440
You ever notice that?

427
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,910
Hey, katherine.

428
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:44,090
What a cute top.

429
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,620
So, uh, where you guys off to?

430
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,640
Bowling.

431
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,760
Come on, buddy. Let's get your jacket.

432
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,650
By the way, uh, i don't think
you're gonna have any problem.

433
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:58,600
I had a little talk with M.J.

434
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,410
Sure you did.

435
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:03,050
What is that supposed to mean?

436
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:05,600
It means things will be
a lot easier with M.J.

437
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,280
If you weren't talking trash
about me and mike dating.

438
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,710
What?

439
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:11,620
I don't do that.

440
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,680
Really?

441
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,890
M. J. always liked me before, and
then i start seeing mike,

442
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:19,020
And suddenly, i'm taking
incoming rocky road.

443
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:21,010
All right. Let's go
knock over some pins.

444
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:22,210
See you, ladies.

445
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,870
Bye.

446
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:29,680
What?

447
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,950
I have never said a negative
word about them dating ever.

448
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,095
I believe you.

449
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,880
It's just... you don't
have to say anything.

450
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,930
It's the way you act when she's around.

451
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:41,000
Kids pick up on that stuff.

452
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,700
What do you mean, the way i act?

453
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:45,856
"Oh, katherine, what a cute top."

454
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:51,520
Kid translation... "have a nice time
at the bowling alley with my ex, whore."

455
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,190
Okay.

456
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:56,600
It-it's a little
uncomfortable, is whole situation.

457
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,920
I mean,if M.J.'s picking up on
it,how am i supposed to fix that?

458
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,040
Well, i didn't say
anything about fixing it.

459
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,290
Two of my friends involved
in a nasty catfight...

460
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:07,610
I live for that stuff.

461
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,990
Thanks for the corkscrew.

462
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:21,950
There you go, eetie.

463
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:22,980
Is that tight enough?

464
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,210
I guess.

465
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,010
What is going on?

466
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:33,850
Why were you on the phone so long?

467
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:35,770
Um, susan's coming.

468
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:37,040
What? Why?

469
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,740
Well, she wants M. J. to see us
all having a good time together.

470
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,460
That way, he might be more
accepting of you and me.

471
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,720
I suppose it's not a terrible idea.

472
00:27:44,952 --> 00:27:46,380
Well, i think it's a good idea.

473
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:50,950
She feels like she's been sending the wrong
signals, and she wants to make up for it.

474
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:56,490
Well, it's nice of her to try, but just how
much of a show was she planning to put on for...

475
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:58,490
Hey, everybody!

476
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:02,720
Are we ready to have the best time ever?

477
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,930
Don't fall down, okay?

478
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:14,710
I'm not carrying you home.

479
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:15,430
I'm fine.

480
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:17,340
Stop worrying.

481
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,610
Look who just got bailed out.

482
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:36,670
You got a lot of balls, kid.

483
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:41,570
You nail my wife, you break up my
family, you burn down my business.

484
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:45,220
I didn't burn down your club.

485
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:49,090
And you can accuse me all you
want, but i'm not going to jail.

486
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,970
If i were you, i'd want to go there.

487
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:55,430
It's a hell of a lot safer.

488
00:28:55,650 --> 00:29:02,460
Otherwise, someday, you'll be walking home
from school or work or your buddy's house,

489
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:06,920
and you'll just... Disappear.

490
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,120
Poof!

491
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:14,290
And if they ask me about it, you
know what i'm gonna tell 'em?

492
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:18,290
I was at the movies.

493
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,950
Enjoy your freedom.

494
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,500
- Um, so right down the middle...
- Okay.

495
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:36,030
- No gutter balls.
- Right.

496
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:38,160
They're getting along great, huh?

497
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,750
You're welcome.

498
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:43,030
I admit it. You being here
does seem to be helping.

499
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:45,360
You're welcome.

500
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,240
Okay, let it go.

501
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:51,690
God, look at him.

502
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:55,450
Remember when he needed one of those little
kiddie balls the size of a cantaloupe?

503
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:56,800
He's getting so big.

504
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,440
I know.

505
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,093
You know, that colts jersey you
bought him doesn't fit anymore.

506
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,270
No. God.

507
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:04,460
I'm gonna try it.

508
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:11,710
How did that little peewee we brought back
from the hospital turn into this bruiser?

509
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:12,910
Mike, i need you.

510
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:14,730
I got another split.

511
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:17,290
What did i say about aiming the ball?

512
00:30:17,563 --> 00:30:18,220
I don't remember.

513
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:20,130
Come show me.

514
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,510
Um, be right there.

515
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,670
Hey there.

516
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,800
Do you have a second?

517
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,378
Now where did you get that?

518
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:21,060
A video store i will never return to.

519
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,870
Are you aware that one of
the stars of this film is...

520
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:26,420
Yes. I know about alex's movie, mom.

521
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,450
You do?

522
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:30,310
Yeah. He told me a long time ago.

523
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:33,600
He calls it the biggest
mistake he's ever ma.

524
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,100
Why would he...

525
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:37,680
well, he couldn't afford
the tuition to med school,

526
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:44,010
And he was approached by this
so-called director, and well, he...

527
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:48,550
Anyway, i would appreciate it if
you didn't let on that you know.

528
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:52,780
And you're okay with this?

529
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:59,880
Yeah. Well, you know, i mean, we both know that
i have sort of an interesting past myself.

530
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:02,860
So, you know, uh, glass houses, stones.

531
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:10,730
Not to mention the fact
that i-i love him...

532
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:12,730
Very much.

533
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:17,050
So...

534
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:18,950
He's the one?

535
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:23,640
Yes, mom.

536
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:28,750
Even with his sordid past, he's the one.

537
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:36,210
Why did you bring this here?

538
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:38,090
You're going to marry him.

539
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:39,630
I thought he wasn't
being honest with you.

540
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:44,089
I wanted to protect you, so i... so
you decided to meddle in my love life?

541
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:45,810
Yes.

542
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,280
You know what, mom?

543
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:56,340
This might be about the nicest
thing you've ever done for me.

544
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,820
Come here.

545
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:06,270
I mean, not every boy can say that his
mother's willing to rent gay porn for them.

546
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:09,460
Yes. Which reminds me, that needs
to be back by 3:00. Could you?

547
00:33:09,735 --> 00:33:10,480
Absolutely.

548
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,120
Uh, you gotta avoid those late fees.

549
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:20,126
Oh, you know, um, you know, i can have
alex autograph this for you if you want.

550
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:22,360
Just take it back.

551
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:33,260
Oh, mrs. Solis, may i
help you with something?

552
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:39,200
Get your boss.

553
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,370
There.

554
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:22,729
You got it back.

555
00:34:24,899 --> 00:34:26,320
Why are you limping?

556
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,180
Fell off a table.

557
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,150
Don't want to talk about it.

558
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:42,550
What took you so long?

559
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:45,160
I just wanted to coach porter a
little bit before the arraignment.

560
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,520
What's he doing?

561
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,690
He needed some time to himself.

562
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,215
I'll meet you inside.

563
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,600
You might want to give him a moment.

564
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,219
I think he's pretty nervous.

565
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:59,570
That's because he's preston.

566
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,000
What?Oh, crap!

567
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,050
Hey, mom, dad.

568
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:12,447
Hey, preston.

569
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,600
Aw, you know?

570
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,600
Of course we know.

571
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,570
What the hell is going on?

572
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:17,940
Where's porter?

573
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:18,994
He took off.

574
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:20,180
What?

575
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:21,860
He was scared out of his mind.

576
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:26,040
He didn't know what to do, so he left town and
asked me if i'd help him give him a head start.

577
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:28,940
Do you have any idea how bad this is?

578
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,230
We had to post bail.

579
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:33,520
If the judge finds out porter
skipped town, we're gonna lose...

580
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,660
A lot.

581
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:35,480
Guys.

582
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,940
Guys, they're calling us.

583
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:37,970
Well, you know what?

584
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:40,570
He's gonna find out right now, because
you are not going in there.

585
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:44,090
I'd rather forfeit the bail than
risk having two of my kids go to jail.

586
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:47,310
Tom... no, bob will just tell
the judge what happened.

587
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:50,200
We'll take the hit and we'll
go forward. It's just money.

588
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,830
It's not just money.

589
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,905
What are you talking about?

590
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:56,320
Hey. Come on.

591
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:57,400
We're up.

592
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:03,955
Okay, look...

593
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:11,280
You know how you're always saying
i know what to do in a crisis?

594
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:13,150
Yeah. Here's what we're gonna do.

595
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:14,759
You... no questions.

596
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:17,430
You... you're porter now.

597
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:19,820
Let's go in.

598
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:23,080
Come on. Come on.

599
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:42,860
You like it?

600
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,240
It's beautiful.

601
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,039
Where'd it come from?

602
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,291
I bought it today. It's yours.

603
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:49,420
What?

604
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:52,400
We can't afford this.

605
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:55,190
I sold the baseball.

606
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:01,660
You never told me
things had gotten so bad.

607
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:05,380
You were blind and depressed.

608
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:08,530
I didn't wanna add to it.

609
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,600
Thank you for taking
such good care of us.

610
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:22,000
I plan on spending the rest
of my life making it up to you.

611
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:36,920
First thing tomorrow i'm selling my watch so i
can buy you some new shoes to go with that dress.

612
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:39,343
You should know that
watch is a knockoff.

613
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,160
I sold the real one two years
ago to get the roof fixed.

614
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,350
So how is katherine's foot?

615
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:53,760
Well, she's kinda got a psychedelic
toenail, but she'll be fine...

616
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:58,770
Which doesn'excuse what you did, mister.

617
00:37:59,649 --> 00:38:00,890
What's going on?

618
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:05,350
Sweetie, if you're worried that i don't like
your daddy spending time with katherine, don't be.

619
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,760
I think it's great.

620
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,630
But they can't be together.

621
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:12,010
Why not?

622
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:15,587
'Cause you and mommy are
getting back together.

623
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,340
What?

624
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,230
That's what mommy said.

625
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:25,500
Hey, i've got an idea.

626
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:28,850
Why don't you go make a get
well card for katherine's foot?

627
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,590
- Okay.
- Okay.

628
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:39,300
I can totally explain this. I swear.

629
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:40,695
I'm listening.

630
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:44,960
It was... i don't know, uh, about
a month after you moved out.

631
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:45,790
It was bedtime.

632
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:48,590
I was trying to read to
him, but he only wanted you.

633
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:59,680
And he was crying so hard, and he kept asking me if you were
ever coming back, and so i finally... Said maybe you would.

634
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:03,240
I just didn't want him to be so sad.

635
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:04,090
Oh, susan.

636
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:05,640
I didn't even think he'd remembered it.

637
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,180
Of course he remembers it.

638
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,470
How could you say that to him?

639
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:15,606
Becausewehave never said it.

640
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:17,570
What?

641
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:23,870
We've never looked each other in the eye and said that
there is no chance we are ever getting back together.

642
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:27,440
O-okay.

643
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,480
Maybe we haven't, but we moved on.

644
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:31,329
Did we?

645
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:32,860
Susan, what are you doing?

646
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,000
You're with jackson now.

647
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,166
I'm with katherine.

648
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:39,879
What are you doing?

649
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:42,620
I don't know.

650
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,190
I...

651
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:48,346
You don't ever think about it?

652
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:05,060
I've gotta go check on katherine.

653
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:25,820
It's an awful thing to live in darkness, unable
to see what others take for granted.

654
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:37,830
But if we are lucky, the darkness lifts and we can
finally see the secret sacrifices made by our wives...

655
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:43,340
The surprising progress
made by our mothers...

656
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:53,140
Or the unintended consequences
of our own actions.

657
00:40:53,320 --> 00:41:02,770
But there are those who prefer the darkness, because
there, they see only what they choose to see.

658
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,340
I know it must seem like
i've forgotten aut you,

659
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:09,620
but you have to know, i
think about you every day.

660
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:14,520
I live for you, just like always.

661
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:19,580
But i have a plan, so i hope
you can wait a little longer.

662
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:28,470
I'll be with you soon, but first mike
delfino has to pay for taking you away fr me,

663
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:31,870
and i need just the
right moment to do it.

664
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:38,680
He destroyed what i loved the
most, and i want him to feel that hurt.

665
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:42,790
I want him to lose what i lost.
