Previously on...

00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:04,010
Porter's affair...

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,220
Your son loves me, and i love him.

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,470
Escalated into violence.

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,570
- Hey,warren.
- Yeah?

6
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,910
I don't care what it takes. You're dead.

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,510
But the full extent of
Dave's rage was realized...

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,670
Fire!

9
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,520
During the battle of the bands.

10
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,230
Mike!

11
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:34,180
And out of the tragedy came a hero.

12
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:35,830
Hang in there.

13
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,350
I'm not done with you yet.

14
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:48,030
Something awful happened
to gabrielle solis...

15
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:54,700
And she was reminded of this every
time she looked in a mirror...

16
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,170
Every time she glanced
at an old photo...

17
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:05,810
And every time she walked past a man.

18
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:12,420
Yes,gabrielle knew
she had lost her looks.

19
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:18,740
But she tried her best to
look on the bright side.

20
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:24,290
After all,what woman
needs to be beautiful...

21
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:28,430
When her husband is blind?

22
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,230
Hi,sweetie.

23
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,550
How's our patient?

24
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:34,870
Well,he took a pretty nasty
fall in the fire last night.

25
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,840
But,uh,the c.t.scan shows
no bleeding or swelling.

26
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:39,560
That's it? No concussion?

27
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,830
Actually,there is something.

28
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,340
Please tell me it's not my hearing.

29
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,070
I'm already down to four senses.

30
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:51,220
The scan revealed a tiny bone fragment that
may be putting pressure on the optic nerves.

31
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:54,630
And,what,you're afraid it's
gonna impair his vision?

32
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,050
I'm sorry. You were saying?

33
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,290
The bone fragment might be a remnant
from your injury five years ago.

34
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:08,720
Due to its small size, the
original scan might have missed it.

35
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:10,650
Mm,five years. Can't we just leave it?

36
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:16,600
Actually,there is a chance if we remove that
bone fragment, you could regain your sight.

37
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,590
- Are you serious?
- That's fantastic!

38
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,150
I'm not promising a slam dunk here.

39
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,750
I'm just saying it's possible.

40
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,350
Doc,two days ago,i spread
moisturizer on a cracker.

41
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,180
I'd kill for "possible."

42
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,620
I've spoken with ted daniels.

43
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,690
He's the best eye surgeon in the state.

44
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:34,350
He says he could fit you in
for surgery in about a month.

45
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,100
Oh,my god.

46
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,600
If this works, i'll finally be able to
see my little girls and my gorgeous wife.

47
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,950
This is unbelievable! Thank you.

48
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,140
Doctor, thank you very much.

49
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:51,360
Yes,gabrielle solis knew
she had lost her beauty.

50
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:56,740
She also knew the time
had come to get it back.

Their broken bones had been set.

Why?

68
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:57,680
We wanted to talk to you about
the fire at the white horse bar.

69
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:03,220
We've been interviewing everyone
who was there last night.

70
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,760
We were told by an...

71
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:09,050
Orson hodge that you were onstage
with the band when theire broke out.

72
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,880
Yeah. We had just started when...

73
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:15,930
Suddenly the curtains went up.

74
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,510
Everything happened
really fast after that.

75
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:21,740
That's okay. We know how
hard this has got to be.

76
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:25,340
So... Have they figured
out how the fire started?

77
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,960
We know it was arson.

78
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:28,970
Really?

79
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,850
It's looking like the point of origin
was the storage room off the back hallway.

80
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,850
And there was a body in there,too.

81
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,540
And you think that's the
person who started the fire?

82
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,860
No,we don't think so.

83
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:42,890
But this guy was pretty badly burned,
so it'll take us a while to identify him.

84
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,690
Anyway,if you,uh, remember
anything you think we should know,

85
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:50,200
Give a call at that
number there. All right?

in and saved that delfino guy?

00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:58,940
Yeah.

89
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,070
You're an honest to god hero.

90
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,200
You should be real proud of yourself.

91
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,230
If you say so.

92
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,560
I would've come sooner,
but i burnt the first batch,

93
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,360
And i wasn't sure you'd
appreciate the irony.

94
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:25,930
I'm so hungry, i wouldn't have noticed.

What if someone sees us?

98
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:34,250
What if they do?

99
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,800
You haven't told Susan we're dating yet.

100
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:41,830
I'm waiting for the right time.

101

Her friendship's very important to
me, and i want to ease her into this.

102
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,290
Okay. I get it.

103
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,520
See ya.

104
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:55,060
Just walk out slowly.

105
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:58,420
Give me something to live for.

106
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,480
Susan.

107
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,570
How's jackson?

108
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:10,610
Uh,he's fine, just getting
some stitches. How's...

109
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,960
Wait,who are you here to see?

110
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:16,950
You know... Everybody.

111
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,390
So many people in the
neighborhood were hurt in the fire.

112
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:23,060
I just thought it would be
nice to bring them... Gifts.

113
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:25,730
Crap! I didn't get anyone gifts.

114
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:31,160
But ididgive blood, so i'll just
remind everybody that i did that.

115
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,800
How you feeling? I just gave blood.

116
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:41,310
Uh,i'm fine,just a
little smoke inhalation.

117
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,480
How's jackson doing?

118
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:45,300
Oh,fine. He just needs some stitches.

119
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:49,450
Ooh,those cookies look
delicious. Where'd you get 'em?

120
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,960
A friend. Have one.

121
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:57,190
Oh,i shouldn't. They're yours.

122
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,760
You know you want to.

123
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:02,710
Well,i did just give blood.

124
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,200
Attractive.

125
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,560
Mm,i hate macadamia nuts.

126
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,730
You think they're white chocolate chips
until it's too late. Stupid hawaii.

127
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,920
Who made 'em?

128
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,420
Like i said, a friend.

129
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:21,100
Yeah. But what friend?

130
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,360
Wait. Is this a woman friend?

131
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:30,690
Um,don't you wanna throw
that macadamia nut away?

132
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:35,200
When i'm done. Don't change the
subject. Are you seeing someone?

133
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,580
Why doyoucare?

134
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,540
I care because you mean a lot to me,

135
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:43,060
And it makes me feel good knowing that
two people have found love and happiness.

136
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,550
So what's her name? Who am i happy for?

137
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,990
Susan,i'm not tellingou.

138
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,060
Why not?

139
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:51,110
Because she wants to tell you herself.

140
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:57,170
So... I know her?

141
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,190
Whoa,i think my meds just kicked in.

142
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,570
I don't know what i'm saying.

143
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,530
You're dating a friend of mine?

144
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,530
Don't be angry.

145
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:09,240
i'm not,but now you have
to tell me who she is.

146
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:13,230
Fine.

147
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,270
Have it your way.

148
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,090
Oh,if he ever needs a transfusion, you
are not allowed to give him my blood.

149
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,980
Hello,dr. Cominis.
How's my husband doing?

150
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,730
Well,the x-rays indicate
there was no concussion,

151
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,810
So i think we're gonna
release him today.

152
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,550
Wonderful. The house was
too quiet without him.

153
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,450
You'll have to wait to talk to him.

154
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,430
He's been in a lot of pain, so we
gave him something to help him sleep.

155
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,690
Oh,that's all right. I can wait.

156
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,180
Mmm,he looks so peaceful.

157
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,610
Goodness. I'm sure if orson were
awake, he'd apologize for that.

158
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,200
Has he always snored?

159
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:00,990
Occasionally, but
never quite this--

160
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:03,610
robustly.

161
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,200
Well,the injury to his
septum might've made it worse.

162
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:09,320
But it can be corrected with
a simple surgical procedure.

163
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:14,720
Well,if it's so simple,
what are we waiting for?

164
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:17,130
It'll take a few weeks to schedule.

165
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:20,680
So... Soon as he wakes
up, you can take him home.

166
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,650
Well... At least the house
won't be quiet anymore.

167
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,940
I ran into katherine.

168
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:42,980
She said you wanted to
see me about something.

169
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:45,180
Right. What was it?

170
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:48,670
Oh,yeah. Thanks for saving my life.

171
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:53,070
Yeah,well... We all did
what we had to do,right?

172
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,700
And you went back in for jackson.

173
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,530
Yeah,but i ended up
passed out on the floor,

174
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,540
Which,technically,makes
me an idiot and you a hero.

175
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,530
Yeah,people keep saying that.
I don't... Feel like one.

176
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:08,970
Well,i would've been dead without you.

177
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:13,370
So... How about free plumbing
for the rest of your life?

178
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:16,610
That sounds fair.

179
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:22,630
Seriously,you've,uh, you gotta
let me do something to thank you.

180
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:30,200
Well,ever since my brother
died,i haven't had a...

181
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:33,000
Really good friend.

182
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:35,350
Think you could handle that job?

183
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,490
I think i could.

184
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:51,210
The stitches are in. I'll need
to see you again in a few days.

185
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,850
Would you like some pills for the pain?

186
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,150
Nah,stitches never
bother me. I'll be fine.

187
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,420
Great. Then let me get another
bandage,and we'll be done.

188
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:01,050
Thank you.

189
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:03,230
Mr. And mrs. Scavo?

190
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,750
Can we ask you a few follow-up
questions about the fire?

191
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,630
We already told you
everything we can remember.

192
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,480
This will only take a moment.

193
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:12,050
It's come to our attention
that the owner of the club

194
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:15,770
And your son got into a fight
minutes before the fire broke out.

195
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,910
Now did you witness that?

196
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:20,440
I saw a grown man beating
up on my teenage boy.

197
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,920
What else do you want to know?

198
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:26,180
During the altercation, did your
son threaten to kill mr. Schilling?

199
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,260
No.

200
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,610
Really?

201
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:36,010
Well... I was right there,detective.

202
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:39,260
My son said no such thing.

203
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,810
You sure?

204
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:45,110
Absolutely.

205
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:51,920
Thank you for your time.

206
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,920
Maybe i'm being a little paranoid here,

207
00:11:55,930 --> 00:12:00,010
But i sort of got the feeling
that you were lying to the police.

208
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:07,000
Lynette,please, tell me that porter
did not threaten to kill mr. Schilling.

209
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:10,730
Got the bandage.

210
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,410
You might wanna go ahead and
give him those pain pills,doc.

211
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:16,130
He's gonna need 'em.

212
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,760
I don't understand.

213
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:25,650
Carlos might get his sight
back. You should be thrilled.

214
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,990
Oh,i know. It's just...

215
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,550
He's been through so much these past
five years, and he's never complained.

216
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:37,090
I just think he deserves to open his eyes to a
wife who doesn't tuck her boobs into her pants.

217
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:41,040
Oh,Gaby,please. Most women
would kill to look like you.

218
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:42,470
But i'm not most women.

219
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:46,400
I was an international fashion model,
and that's how carlos remembers me.

220
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:48,310
You are still beautiful.

221
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,830
So you've gained a
little weight. Who hasn't?

222
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,890
Don't go by me. I have
a weird metabolism.

223
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,360
Hey there!

224
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:00,490
I just heard the good news about carlos!

225
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:05,210
What's wrong?

226
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:09,490
Gaby thinks that carlos isn't gonna find
her attractive after he gets his sight back.

227
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,300
Yeah,that was my first thought,too.

228
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:14,650
- Edie!
- Oh,it's okay,it's okay. Let her talk.

229
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,840
At least she's being honest.

230
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:21,100
It's the kind of support and
friendship i need right now.

231
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:24,940
Fine. You're a pig.

232
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:27,210
Thank you.

233
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:30,020
God,what am i gonna do?

234
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,930
Well... You're gonna stop whining,for
one. You got a month,right?

235
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:38,210
That's pley of time to go on
a diet and start exercising.

236
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:42,510
By the time carlos gets his eyesight
back, you are gonna be looking hot...

237
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,520
Or hot-ish.

238
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:48,040
Really? I mean,do you
think i could pull this off?

239
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:53,290
Of course, even though i still think
you're beautiful just the way you are.

240
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,190
You gonna start that crap again?

241
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:00,020
I don't believe it.

242
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,780
Tom,i was 6 feet away.

243
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:05,060
Porter looked warren
schilling in the eye and said,

244
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,870
"you're dead.I don't care
what it takes. You're dead."

245
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,660
That doesn't prove a thing.

246
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,880
And--and--and i'm
sure he didn't mean it.

247
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,270
Maybe he didn't.

248
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,600
But ten minutes later,
that nightclub was on fire.

249
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:19,590
No. No!

250
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,200
I know porter. He wouldn't commit
arson just to get back at someone.

251
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:24,700
What about rick's restaurant?

252
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,930
Porter and his brother burned that down.

253
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,510
That was five years ago.

254
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,490
I mean,they--they were
trying to protectus.

255
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,320
They--they--nobody
got hurt.

256
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:35,630
The building was empty.

257
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:40,430
Yes,thattime, the building was empty.

258
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:44,880
This isinsane.

259
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:52,120
Lynette,are you actually telling
me that our son is a murderer?

260
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:57,810
I'm lling you i heard him
threaten warren schilling.

261
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:01,590
I don't know what happened next.

262
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:08,570
What if somebody saw him?

263
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:11,540
What if he left behind evidence?

264
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,440
What are we gonna do?

265
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,750
We're going to protect our son.

266
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,780
Even if he killed six people?

267
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:24,740
We're going to protect our son.

268
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,980
Okay.

269
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,170
Oh,boy!

270
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:38,100
Who knew healthy food
could look so tasty?

271
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:40,860
Okay,dig in.

272
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,470
What's wrong?

273
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,810
It smells like the beach that
time they wouldn't let us swim.

274
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,950
It's a recipe i got
from a diet magazine.

275
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,410
It's--it's fish
and broccoli.

276
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,500
Fish?

277
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:56,570
Yes. Not all fish is
shaped like a stick.

278
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:00,850
Now i know you're not used
to it,but give it a try.

279
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,150
You're gonna love it.

280
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,540
Yummy.

281
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:14,310
It's still in your mouth.

282
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,750
See? Delicious!

283
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,710
I want macaroni.

284
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,600
Hey,i'm not a short-order cook.

285
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:27,930
I don't have time to make
different meals for everyone.

286
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:31,030
It comes in a box. It's not that hard.

287
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,240
Okay,look.Mommy needs
to lose a few pounds,

288
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,140
and it's not easy eating healthy
with you two in front of me,

289
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:39,110
Scarfing down all the good stuff.

290
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,280
So what do you say? You want to
help mommy be beautiful again?

291
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,420
No.

292
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:48,900
You got a lot of nerve.

293
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:53,110
Part of the reason i'm on this diet is because
carrying you 2 brats for 18 months made mommy fat!

294
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,200
And you with the
head-- you ruined me!

295
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:57,850
So this is how it's gonna go down.

296
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:02,320
You're gonna eat fish with mommy
and you're gonna like it. Got it?

297
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,820
Thank you.

298
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:11,160
A spokesman from fairview memorial hospital
says this latest death raises the total to seven.

299
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:14,790
- Oh,come on. You're watching that again? - Authorities
estimate there may have been as many as 100--

300
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,550
Sorry.

301
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,070
Are you okay?

302
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,910
I just...

303
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:29,730
This fire--i still can't
believe it really happened.

304
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,470
I mean,they just said another
person died this afternoon.

305
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:36,580
That makes... Seven.

306
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:44,650
Well,if it makes you feel any better,
they think they know who did it.

307
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,920
Who?

308
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:52,150
Well,it's just a rumor, but i hear
they're looking at porter scavo.

309
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,790
Porter? Why would they think it's him?

310
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:01,980
I don't know. I guess there was a fight
between him and the guy who owns the club.

311
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:06,780
You know,i've known that kid since he was 6
years old, and i always thought he was trouble.

312
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:11,380
And trust me,i'm areallygood
judge of character.

313
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,560
You slept on the couch?

314
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,040
Why? It's so uncomfortable.

315
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:27,000
Yes,it is. Sit down. We need to talk.

316
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:29,070
What's wrong?

317
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:35,700
Orson,dear, because of the way your nose
was broken during the fire, you now snore.

318
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,080
Oh,didn't i snore before?

319
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:42,340
Good point. Snoring is too mild
a word for what you're doing.

320
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:47,800
Imagine a terrified
elephant summoning his herd.

321
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:52,350
You know,Bree, i can't help but
take issue with your sarcastic tone.

322
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:55,140
Snoring is not something
that i can help.

323
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:57,210
Not exactly true.

324
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:00,290
The doctor said there's
a very simple procedure--

325
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,400
Procedure?

326
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:04,100
Very routine and-- and
practically outpatient.

327
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,350
You mean surgery? No way.

328
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:11,060
I had an uncle who died during
an "outpatient procedure."

329
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:14,840
He went in for a broken wrist. They
put him under. He never woke up.

330
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,360
You don't have an uncle!

331
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:19,610
Fine. He was more of a family friend.

332
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:25,080
No,the point is, he's still dead, and
i am not having unnecessary surgery.

333
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:27,350
This is absolutely necessary.

334
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,300
I am going through a
very stressful time.

335
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:32,990
I have interviews,that cooking
demonstration at the mall.

336
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:36,140
If i don't get my rest,it could
affect the launch of my book.

337
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,620
Well, that's very reasonable.

338
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:40,750
Youget to be a best-selling author.

339
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:42,840
Iget to b an organ donor.

340
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:48,660
Orson,if we can't share a bed, it's going
to hurt the intimacy of our marriage.

341
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:52,410
My death will have the same effect.

342
00:19:55,330 --> 00:20:01,240
Oh,orson, i can't help but take
issue with yoursarcastictone.

343
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,070
I hear you're getting discharged today.

344
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:13,890
Are you going back home?

345
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,690
Home? Hmm,let's see...

346
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,430
Two cracked ribs, black eye...

347
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,560
Nope,got everything i need from there.

348
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:27,050
I'm sure you heard about
the nightclub burning down.

349
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,470
Yeah,i heard.

350
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,900
Your husband's blaming porter.

351
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,670
What?

352
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,200
Porter would never do anything li that.

353
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,950
What's this?

354
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,810
I'm helping you help me.

355
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:49,930
This way,you get to start a new life,

356
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:54,800
And i get to not have you around
while my son is going through all this.

357
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:57,990
What if i'm not ready to leave?

358
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,880
Well,then you can face statutory
rape charges without the money.

359
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:04,490
Your call.

360
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,310
I'll pick you up tonight.

361
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:14,770
I'll give you a ride to the bus station.

362
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:18,300
You can count it then.

363
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:28,670
Hey,do you wanna take a walk?

364
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:30,550
I need a little girlfriend time.

365
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:34,980
I've got something in the oven,
but you can come in if you want.

366
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:44,880
So... What's on your mind?

367
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:48,850
Well... It's about Mike.

368
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,070
- Mike?
- Yeah.

369
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,720
Can you imagine how upset i was when i
discovered he's dating a friend of mine?

370
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:59,800
Oh,Susan,i'm
so--

371
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:01,800
it's gotta be lisa wallace.

372
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:06,450
So shocked at lisa! How dare she?

373
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:09,680
You know,she has wanted to get
her hooks into Mike for years.

374
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:14,180
Every time she would have us over for a
barbecue, she always wore something booby.

375
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:20,480
Well,in lisa's defense, maybe
she thinks you're over Mike,

376
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:23,220
Which is something i've
heard you say more than once.

377
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,860
Well,it doesn't matter.

378
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:26,190
She's my friend.

379
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,910
She should've co to me
and discussed it first.

380
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,070
Well,you're not always available.

381
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,640
And besides...Maybe...

382
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:38,100
lisa was waiting to see
if this thing had a future.

383
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:42,780
All things we can discuss when i
knock her teeth out with a pool cue.

384
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:46,300
You know,it's sad when
you can't trust a friend.

385
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:51,660
Or maybe the lesson here is that she
wasn't really a friend to begin with then.

386
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,020
What's wrong?

387
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,650
Susan,i swear i was gonna tell y.

388
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,430
It's fine. It's... Fine.

389
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,130
I just didn't think it
would be such a big deal.

390
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,390
I mean, you're seeing jackson now.

391
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,890
Yes,i am. You're perfectly right.

392
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,320
And i've been so lonely lately.

393
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,450
Well,now you're not.

394
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:16,530
I know you're mad at me. Would you
just please yell at me or something?

395
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,290
Oh,damn it. I should've
listened to Bree.

396
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,760
- Bree?
- Yes. She told me weeks ago i should've told you.

397
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,500
- So Bree knew?
- Yes.

398
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:25,670
Okay. Well,have a nice day.

399
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:29,610
So... We're okay then?

400
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:35,460
You knew about katherine and Mike?

401
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:38,130
Oh,god,Susan. Can't this
wait till after my nap?

402
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,390
Why didn't you tell me?

403
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,500
I didn't think it was my place.

404
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:44,440
I thought katherine should tell you.

405
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:46,340
Well,she didn't.

406
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,750
I'm sorry.

407
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,690
Uh,not good enough.

408
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:53,160
Y-you had a million chances to
say something and you didn't.

409
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:56,830
That is just the same
as lying to my face.

410
00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:02,300
You know,i always thought that the one
thing i could depend on you for was honesty.

411
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:03,560
What happened to that?

412
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,530
You want honesty? Fine.

413
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,230
You didn't want to divorce Mike.

414
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:10,600
You hit a really bad patch after the
accident, but you never stopped loving him.

415
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,100
And why would you?

416
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,850
Your relationship didn't
have a natural end.

417
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,540
So face it. You're not mad
at me or Mike or katherine.

418
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:20,270
You're mad at yourself for
letting your marriage fall apart.

419
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:30,670
What am i supposed to do?

420
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:36,310
Either tell Mike how
you feel or move on,

421
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:41,050
Because that's what he's trying to
do, and it's not fair to stop him.

422
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,810
You need to make a decision, Susan.

423
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:49,880
And i need to get back to my nap.

424
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:56,680
I know ****not to get our hopes up...

425
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,830
But i can't help it. My hopes
are up. I am gonna see again!

426
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:03,770
I knew it. Ou're excited,too.
I can hear it in your voice.

427
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:06,020
Hi,dr. Bach! How are you?

428
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,040
Hi,mrs. Solis.

429
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,320
Hey,doc! We are still
reeling over the good news.

430
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:12,250
Well,i have even better news.

431
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:14,590
Dr. Daniels just had a cancellation.

432
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,650
He can fit you in next friday.

433
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,270
Friday?

434
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:20,480
But you said it would
be at least a month.

435
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,830
I mean,that's so soon.

436
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:25,160
So? Friday's great.

437
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:31,750
Okay,i didn't wanna have to say this, but
you should never have surgery on a friday.

438
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:35,060
The surgeons are thinking about
the weekend. They're all distracted.

439
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:39,570
Next thing you know,you come out of the
o.r.still blind and missing your right leg.

440
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,210
Why are you talking like this?

441
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,750
Also,the surgery is very expensive.

442
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,970
We need time to figure out
how we're gonna pay for it.

443
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:48,410
How about using our insurance?

444
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:50,620
That only covers 85%.

445
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:52,270
And we arebroke.

446
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:56,730
You know what? The hospital has a foundation
to help people in this exact situation.

447
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:59,110
No. We don't accept charity.

448
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,720
What? Wealwaysaccept charity!

449
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:03,380
Well,i have turned over a new leaf.

450
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,160
I'm sorry about the timing,
carlos,but it is what it is.

451
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:09,320
Gaby,we are doing this
friday. Now drop it.

452
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:14,480
So you say this guy's good, huh,doc?

453
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,920
Dr. Daniels is one of the
top guys in the country.

454
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:19,450
That's what i like to hear.

455
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:24,290
Bree...

456
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:26,010
Pleaselet me sleep in my bed.

457
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,440
No.

458
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,640
I promise not to snore.

459
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:34,210
And--and if i do, i will go down to
the sofa and stay as long as you say.

460
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,460
And how exactly are
you gonna stop snoring?

461
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,010
Well,i read somewhere that
chamomile tea helps prevent it.

462
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,340
That doesn sound right.

463
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,160
Well,it's worth a try, right?

464
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,750
Look,i'll-- i'll
brew you a cup,too.

465
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,000
Whatever.

466
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:10,450
There you go. Drink that up.

467
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,570
All right,but i think i'll
be too tired to finish it.

468
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,740
That pill i took really kicked in fast.

469
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,270
You took a pill? When did you do that?

470
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,510
When you were downstairs.

471
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:25,010
Uh,oh,well, then you shouldn't drink
this, because the chamomile actually,uh,

472
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,450
Counteracts the effect
of the sleeping pill.

473
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:29,260
Since when have you become
such an expert on chamomile?

474
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:31,590
Well,the point is, we shouldn't risk it.

475
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,960
Fine. I just know i
need my sleep tonight.

476
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:41,030
That's it.

477
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:44,190
We'll finish that thought Tomorrow.

478
00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:02,900
I,um,don't suppose you'd tell
porter something for me,would you?

479
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:10,180
I know this is probably the last
thing you want to hear, but...

480
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,060
Idolove your son.

481
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:17,580
He was very sweet to me.

482
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:21,260
Kindness has always...

483
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:24,150
Been a weakness of mine.

484
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:28,070
Good luck.

485
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:41,030
Anne?

486
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:44,170
When the baby comes,
you don't contact porter.

487
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:49,820
You can contact Tom or me, and we'll
do what we can for you from a distance.

488
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:53,680
Understood?

489
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:58,410
There's no baby. Never was.

490
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:12,790
Hello?

491
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:14,750
I just got a call from the
lady at the department store.

492
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,500
She said that mom's late.

493
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,810
Late for what?

494
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,450
For the cooking demonstration.

495
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,200
That's today?

496
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:24,670
Yeah. It was supposed
to start ten minutes ago.

497
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,080
Look,i'm in mt.Pleasant right
now buying some end tables

498
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,120
so you're gonna have to get her there.

499
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:30,750
Orson?

500
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:36,220
Bree,honey? Wake up. It's 9:15.

501
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:40,120
9:15? 9:15. I'm supposed
to be at the mall.

502
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:41,710
Did i forget to set the alarm?

503
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,890
We need to get dressed.
I'll get you some clothes.

504
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,390
I'm so thirsty.

505
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,500
Well,i'll bring you some juice.

506
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:49,300
That's all right. I'll
just drink this tea.

507
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:51,210
Bree.

508
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:53,980
What?

509
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:56,850
On second thought, you need coffee.

510
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,760
Almost there.

511
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:01,640
All right,coffee time.

512
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:04,660
Enough coffee. It's not
working,anyway. It must be decaf.

513
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,340
No,it's a triple espresso.

514
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:08,970
I just don't understand
why i feel so loopy.

515
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,450
Very mysterious.

516
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:14,000
Look,Bree,all you gotta do
is whip up a few pancakes,

517
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:17,350
Hand out some advance copies of
your book, and we're outta here.

518
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,280
Do you think you can handle that?

519
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:19,550
Of course i can.

520
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:23,670
You are such a nervous nellie,rex.

521
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:30,030
Oh,and here's the lady who's gonna teach us
how to make her traditional buckwheat pancakes--

522
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:33,350
Bree van de kamp.

523
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,370
Thank you for joining us.

524
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:40,830
Thank you for having
me to your lovely home.

525
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:46,200
Bree,um,your book is about so much
more than just recipes,isn't it?

526
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:51,550
Yes,my book is about food and families
and how food brings families together

527
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,190
when they make food.

528
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,890
It's mothers teaching
daughters how to cook.

529
00:30:56,910 --> 00:31:00,850
So i'm gonna cook
pancakes with my daughter,

530
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:04,980
Only she's not here 'cause
she grew up and stole my baby.

531
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:10,270
So... Who wants to be my daughter?

532
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:24,900
Hello?

533
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:29,390
It's me. I just wanted to tell you...

534
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:35,380
I've been thinking about it, and,um,
i'm okay with you dating Mike.

535
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,400
You are? You don't hate me?

536
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:41,500
No... And i think it's great.

537
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:43,730
Oh,Susan,thank you. I was so worried.

538
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:47,970
I just... I didn't know what
i'd do if i lost you as a friend.

539
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:52,020
Well,you haven't.

540
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:56,750
Just... Treat him well,
okay? He's a really good guy.

541
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,110
I will.

542
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:01,150
Hey,um,i was just about
to make a cappuccino.

543
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:03,310
You wanna come over?

544
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,850
No,thanks. I'm really busy.

545
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:10,130
I have a lot of things to do today.

546
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,990
Another time though,okay?

547
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:16,040
Bye.

548
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:25,920
Just call me back,okay?

549
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:29,240
I really need to talk to you.

550
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,650
Who's that?

551
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:37,070
Nobody. Just a kid at school.
I lent him my bus pass.

552
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:42,040
Listen,we need to talk.

553
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:44,940
What's up?

554
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:53,440
I have to ask you something, and it is
very important that you tell me the truth.

555
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:57,590
Okay.

556
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,780
Did you set that fire at the nightclub?

557
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:06,730
Before you answer, let
me say that if you did,

558
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:12,690
I promise,your father and i will stand behind you
and try and find some way out of this nightmare.

559
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:18,570
But if you lie to me, d i
find out later that you...

560
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:22,460
Killed... Those people...

561
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,950
Well,i will love you.That
will never change,

562
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:30,200
but i won't believe in
you anymore, and if i...

563
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:36,170
Don't believe in
you... I can't help you.

564
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:43,910
We have to tell each other
the truth from here on out.

565
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:52,040
Mom... I don't know who set
the fire, but it wasn't me.

566
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:00,570
Of course it wasn't. Of course.

567
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:06,850
Then we're gonna be okay, as
long as you keep telling thtruth.

568
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:10,010
Everything's gonna be fine.

569
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,330
Mom?

570
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:17,110
There is one thing i lied about.

571
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,220
What?

572
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:22,850
When you walked in, i was
leaving a message for anne.

573
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:28,530
She hasn't returned my calls, and
the hospital said she checked out.

574
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:31,930
Do you have any idea where she is?

575
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:37,510
No. Sweetie,i don't.

576
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:46,030
You know what i'm really excited about?

577
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,420
Christmas lights.

578
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:51,400
I might be able to see christmas
lights again and holiday derations.

579
00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:53,440
Man,i really miss that stuff.

580
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:56,730
Yeah,well,let's keep
Our fingers crossed.

581
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,690
You okay?

582
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:05,150
Yeah. It's my hamstring.
I've just been working out.

583
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,000
You want me to rub it?

584
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:08,830
No,no,you rest.

585
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:11,150
You're gonna have
surgery in a couple days.

586
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:13,870
I know. I can't wait.

587
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:20,460
You know,carlos, i know you're really excited
to see christmas decorations again, but...

588
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,920
I just want you to
be prepared because...

589
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:28,630
Well,so of those lights
may have lost their luster.

590
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,420
So should we buy new decorations?

591
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,830
No,i'm talking aboutme.
Imay have lost my luster.

592
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:40,220
Come on. I'm always gonna find
you beautiful. I told you that.

593
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:43,040
Yeah,that's when you thought
you were gonna be blind forever.

594
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:47,850
But if this operation works, i just
don't want you to be disappointed.

595
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:54,200
Oh,come here.

596
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:04,310
Did i ever tell you when i
knew i was gonna marry you?

597
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:06,240
First time you saw me on the runway.

598
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:09,520
No,that's when i knew i
was gonna sleep with you.

599
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:14,300
No,i knew i was gonna marry you the night
we went to that restaurant on third street.

600
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,660
Mmm,i remember that place.

601
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:22,130
You wore a white linen sundress.

602
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:27,270
And you ordered this
giant plate of ribs.

603
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:32,790
And you ate them with such gusto,
up to your elbows in barbecue sauce,

604
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:36,590
Meat hanging from your teeth
and grease in your hair.

605
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:42,250
And when it was all over, i
pointed out what a mess you were.

606
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:46,990
Well,you pulled out your
mirror, took a look at yourself

607
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:53,320
and just let out this huge,Happy,
totally unrestrained laugh.

608
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:59,200
The room completely filled with it...

609
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:04,970
And i thought to myself, nowthatis a
sound i'd like to hear the rest of my life.

610
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:14,500
That's why i proposed to you, and
it had nothing to do with your looks.

611
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:25,240
You know when i decided i
wanted to be with you forever?

612
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:27,960
No. When?

613
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:31,200
About two seconds ago.

614
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:39,980
Up until then, it was
pretty touch-and-go.

615
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,160
♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪

616
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:50,080
well,my husband has agreed to
the procedure you suggested.

617
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:51,590
Oh,the one to alleviate his snoring?

618
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,750
Yes,that's the one.

619
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:57,340
So anytime you wanna get in there and
start hacking away, he's ready for you.

620
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,440
Aren't you,love?

621
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:01,790
Yes,dear.

622
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:05,520
Well,how is two weeks from friday?

623
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:07,650
Well,fridays are when orson plays golf.

624
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:11,300
So friday's perfect. Right,orson?

625
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:13,720
Right... Dear.

626
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,950
I'm sorry,mr. Hodge. I'm sensing you're
a bit apprehensive about the surgery.

627
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,620
Oh,he's not apprehensive.
He's terrified.

628
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:28,220
And i don't care, because
he owes me one-- A big one.

629
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:30,500
Don't you,darling?

630
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:33,370
I sure do.

631
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:36,800
I'm sorry. What's going on here?

632
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:39,300
Are you married, dr. Cominis?

633
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:41,520
No,but i just moved in with someone.

634
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:45,410
Well,over time,you'll learn that there's
a balance of power in relationships,

635
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:49,050
And if your beloved ever pulls
a nasty trick on you, like say,

636
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:53,110
Drugging you into a stupor, then
the balance of power shifts to you,

637
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:58,760
And then you can demand they prove
their love by,say,undergoing surgery.

638
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:01,630
Do you understand?

639
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,130
Not really.

640
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,520
You will.

641
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:07,120
Come along,orson.

642
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:26,310
Hey,hon,listen, can you
promise me something?

643
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:31,350
Tell me we'll never grow into one of those insane
couples that just lives to make each other crazy.

644
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:35,660
Well,no worries there.
You already make me crazy.

645
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:40,180
Oh,hey,guess what? I,uh,i picked
up our new end tables today.

646
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:43,390
Yeah,hurry home. I want you to see 'em.

647
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,970
If you walk through
fairview memorial hospital,

648
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:57,030
You will encounter all sorts of
people doing their best to recover.

649
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:06,740
It might be a husband licking his
wounds after a marital battle...

650
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:14,600
Or two parents rallying
from an attack of doubt.

651
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:22,400
It might be a wife who's been
cured of low self-esteem...

652
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:30,550
Or a pair of lovers who find
honesty to be the best medicine.

653
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:39,100
Sadly,you will alsoind some poor
souls afflicted with a condition

654
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:41,800
they will never recover from.

655
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:45,160
Detectives,i heard you were
still here, interviewing people,

656
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:48,580
and i have...Something to tell you.

657
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:50,050
Okay.

658
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:52,260
The night of the fire...

659
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:54,940
I was back by the storage room.

660
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:57,460
Yes?

661
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:02,520
And i saw somebody come out--
a kid who lives on my block.

662
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:04,780
His name is porter scavo.

663
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:08,700
You asked me to tell you if
i remembered anything, and...

664
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:10,700
I remembered that.

IT'S BEAUTIFUL. WHERE'D IT COME FROM?

681
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,700
I BOUGHT IT TODAY. IT'S YOURS.

682
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,500
WHAT?

683
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,000
WE CAN'T AFFORD THIS.

684
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,100
I SOLD THE BASEBALL.

685
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,300
YOU NEVER TOLD ME
THINGS HAD GOTTEN SO BAD.

686
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,600
YOU WERE BLIND AND DEPRESSED.

687
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,400
I DIDN'T WANNA ADD TO IT.

688
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,000
THANK YOU FOR TAKING
SUCH GOOD CARE OF US.

689
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,900
I PLAN ON SPENDING THE REST OF
MY LIFE MAKING IT UP TO YOU.

690
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,300
MM.

691
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,000
FIRST THING TOMORROW I'M SELLING MY WATCH

692
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,500
SO I CAN BUY YOU SOME NEW
SHOES TO GO WITH THAT DRESS.

693
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,400
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT WATCH IS A KNOCKOFF.

694
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,800
I SOLD THE RL ONE TWO YEARS
AGO TO GET THE ROOF FIXED.

695
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,500
SO HOW IS KATHERINE'S FOOT?

696
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,300
WELL, SHE'S KINDA GOT A PSYCHEDELIC TOENAIL,

697
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,100
BUT SHE'LL BE FINE...

698
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,700
WHICH DOESN'EXCUSE WHAT YOU DID, MISTER.

699
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:00,500
WHAT'S GOING ON?

700
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,100
SWEETIE, IF YOU'RE WORRIED

701
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:05,400
THAT I DON'T LIKE YOUR DADDY SPENDING
TIME WITH KATHERINE, DON'T BE.

702
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,800
I THINK IT'S GREAT.

703
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,400
BUT THEY CAN'T BE TOGETHER.

704
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,900
WHY NOT?

705
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,900
'CAUSE YOU AND MOMMY ARE
GETTING BACK TOGETHER.

706
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,300
WHAT?

707
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,300
THAT'S WHAT MOMMY SAID.

708
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,600
UM... HEY, I'VE GOT AN IDEA.

709
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:29,400
WHY DON'T YOU GO MAKE A GET
WELL CARD FOR KATHERINE'S FOOT?

710
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,700
- OKAY.
- GOOD.

711
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,100
I CAN TOTALLY EXPLAIN THIS. I SWEAR.

712
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,800
I'M LISTENING.

713
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,000
IT WAS--I DON'T KNOW, UH, ABOUT
A MONTH AFTER YOU MOVED OUT.

714
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,900
IT WAS BEDTIME.

715
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,300
I WAS TRYING TO READ TO HIM,
BUT HE ONLY WANTED YOU.

716
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,500
AND HE WAS CRYING SO HARD,

717
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,400
AND HE KEPT ASKING ME
IF YOU WERE EVER COMING BACK,

718
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,700
AND SO I FINALLY...

719
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,400
SAID MAYBE YOU WOULD.

720
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,200
I JUST DIDN'T WANT HIM TO BE SO SAD.

721
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,500
- OH, SUSAN.
- I DIDN'T EVEN THINK HE'D REMEMBERED IT.

722
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,300
OF COURSE HE REMEMBERS IT.

723
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,900
HOW COULD YOU SAY THAT TO HIM?

724
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,000
BECAUSE WE HAVE NEVER SAID IT.>

725
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:17,600
WHAT?

726
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
WE'VE NEVER LOOKED EACH OTHER IN THE EYE

727
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,300
AND SAID THAT THERE IS NO CHANCE
WE ARE EVER GETTING BACK TOGETHER.

728
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,700
O-OKAY.

729
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,800
MAYBE WE HAVEN'T, BUT WE MOVED ON.

730
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,500
DID WE?

731
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,800
SUSAN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

732
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,200
YOU'RE WITH JACKSON NOW.
I'M WITH KATHERINE.

733
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,600
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

734
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,200
I DON'T KNOW. I...

735
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,000
YOU DON'T EVER THINK ABOUT IT?

736
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,400
I'VE GOTTA GO CHECK ON KATHERINE.

737
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,900
<i>IT'S AN AWFUL THING TO LIVE IN DARKNESS,</i>

738
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:25,400
<i>UNABLE TO SEE WHAT OTHERS TAKE FOR GRANTED.</i>

739
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,600
<i>BUT IF WE ARE LUCKY,
THE DARKNESS LIFTS</i>

740
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:36,600
<i>AND WE CAN FINALLY SEE THE SECRET
SACRIFICES MADE BY OUR WIVES...</i>

741
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:43,300
<i>THE SURPRISING PROGRESS
MADE BY OUR MOTHERS...</i>

742
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,800
<i>OR THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES
OF OUR OWN ACTIONS.</i>

743
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:56,200
<i>BUT THERE ARE THOSE
WHO PREFER THE DARKNESS,</i>

744
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:01,700
<i>BECAUSE THERE, THEY SEE
ONLY WHAT THEY CHOOSE TO SEE.</i>

745
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,500
I KNOW IT MUST SEEM LIKE
I'VE FORGOTTEN AUT YOU,

746
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:09,100
BUT YOU HAVE TO KNOW,
I THINK ABOUT YOU EVERY DAY.

747
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,000
I LIVE FOR YOU, JUST LIKE ALWAYS.

748
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,200
BUT I HAVE A PLAN,

749
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,500
SO I HOPE YOU CAN WAIT A LITTLE LONGER.

750
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,100
I'LL BE WITH YOU SOON,

751
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:28,200
BUT FIRST MIKE DELFINO HAS TO
PAY FOR TAKING YOU AWAY FR ME,

752
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:31,600
AND I NEED JUST THE RIGHT MOMENT TO DO IT.

753
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,200
HE DESTROYED WHAT I LOVED THE MOST,

754
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,500
AND I WANT HIM TO FEEL THAT HURT.

755
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,800
I WANT HIM TO LOSE WHAT I LOST.

756
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,900
