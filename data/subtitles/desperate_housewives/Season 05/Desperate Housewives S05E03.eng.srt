3
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,260
Previously on Desperate Housewives...

4
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,870
Susan's new boyfriend met the family...

5
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:05,810
Who are you?

6
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:06,680
Hi

7
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:08,450
I'm Mike. Her ex-husband.

8
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,560
Gaby's life was no long glamorous.

9
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,330
(Service Entrance Only)

10
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:13,930
Now it's official. I've lost everything.

11
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,830
First Our mOney, then my figure,

12
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,680
Now the last shreds of our social Standing.

13
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:21,320
Baby, we have a home, and we have two beautiful little girls...

14
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:24,130
Danielle's decision was devastating.

15
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:25,680
Please, just don't take him!

16
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,300
Benjamin's All I have!

17
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,100
You're just gonna have to find something else.

18
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,270
And Edie's new husband showed the dark side.

19
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,250
I would consider it a personal favor

20
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,630
If you'd apologize to Edie.

21
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,230
No.

22
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,190
And it seems to me

23
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,770
That a woman le you would like to keep

24
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:40,090
The few friends that she has left.

25
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:41,250
I think you'd better go.

26
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:42,790
Now why would you bring me flowers?

27
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,120
'cause you've got a computer,

28
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:47,310
And I need to find out some stuff about Edie's husband.

29
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,860
Benjamin Katz was 6 years old,

30
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:59,030
And there were a lot of things he didn't understand.

31
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,300
He wasn't sure why the woman you call "mommy"

32
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:06,080
Isn't Always your mother.

33
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:10,120
Or how the man who was Always there for him

34
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,640
Could suddenly be taken away.

35
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,150
Or why you could go for a ride...

36
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,250
And never come back home.

37
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,750
Yes, there were a lot of things

38
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,400
Benjamin Katz couldn't understand,

39
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:28,950
And no one seemed in a hurry

40
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,410
To explain them.

41
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,760
Here they come, finally.

42
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,940
You know, Bree, things will be a little strange at first,

43
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,670
So please, be on your best behavior.

44
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,200
I do not require lectures on tact.

45
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,310
I know. It's just that we've missed Benjy so much,

46
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,090
And it's taken so many olive branches

47
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,870
To get them to come back. I'm aware of what's at stake, Orson.

48
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,070
Good. So if you feel an impulse to criticize something,

49
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,890
You'll keep the thought to yourself.

50
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,260
Hi!

51
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,090
I've Already started.

52
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,300
Danielle! What a dightfully ethnic ensemble.

53
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,930
Hey, mom, Orson. Hi, Danielle.

54
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,980
Oh, I want to meet my husband Leo.

55
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,850
It's nice to finally meet both of you in person. Lovely to meet you, Leo.

56
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,680
Hey, who's this little linebacker?

57
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,690
Hi, Benjy. Remember me? I'm not sure.

58
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,140
That's okay. That's what this visit is for, right?

59
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,690
Getting to know each other.

60
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,260
Now we have you for the whole weekend, right?

61
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,390
Yep, whole three days.

62
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,650
Oh, good. 'cause we've made lots of plans.

63
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,180
We're gonna take you to the circus

64
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,770
If it's okay with your folks. Can I go, Danielle?

65
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,160
"danielle"? Did he just ca you "danielle"?

66
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,170
Well, it is my name.

67
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,180
Yes, I'm aware of that. I picked it.

68
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,760
I'm just concerned

69
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:44,520
People might view it as a sign of, um, disrespect.

70
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,460
By "people," you mean you?

71
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,150
Uh... Leo. Look at All the luggage you have here.

72
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,750
I'll give you a hand here. Okay. Oh, thanks.

73
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:55,250
Um... Let me be clear.

74
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,620
I do no want him calling me "bree."

75
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,450
Oh, don't worry. Td him to call you "granny."

76
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:07,010
Yes, Benjamin Katz was only 6 years old,

77
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,690
But even he could understand

78
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,690
This was going to be...

79
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,910
A long weekend.

80
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,020
Any child will tell you

81
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,070
That where you find a playground,

82
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,630
You will Also find...

83
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,090
Bullies--

84
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,830
Young tyrants who bring pain...

85
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,810
Intimidation...

86
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,110
And violence.

87
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:46,000
What can children do in the face of such torment?

88
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,210
Well, there is one obvious option,

89
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,380
But not every child is eager to go running home to mother.

90
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:56,850
Ugh. Hey. Hon.

91
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,280
How was the park? Wait. Hold on.

92
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,210
Mommy just found her first gray hair.

93
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,830
I need you to grab it, yank it and never speak of it again.

94
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,600
Oh. Look at your face.

95
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,360
It's scratched.

96
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,620
What happened?

97
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,110
Nothing.

98
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,060
And your shirt is ripped.

99
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,730
That's the second Time this week.

100
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,300
Is someone picking on you?

101
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,250
Who is it?

102
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,250
Is it Jeffrey Hixon, that weird kid who eats paper?

103
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,130
Is it Timmy Crowley?

104
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,440
His mom slept in her car last night.

105
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,050
Who knows what's going on there?

106
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,170
Is it that boy from your birthday,

107
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:42,980
The one who slugged the pony?

108
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,120
Oh, sweetie. I know you're upset,

109
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,020
But you'll feel better if you talk about it.

110
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,530
And there's nothing you can't tell me. I'm your mommy.

111
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,500
I wanna talk to daddy.

112
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,650
Okay.

113
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,240
We'll give him a call.

114
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,500
You're not gonna find another one in this condition.

115
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,600
I mean, the car is a classic.

116
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,830
Well, what do you think, Nabila?

117
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,480
Eh. I like it. I don't love it.

118
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,750
Tell you what.

119
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,120
Gaby and I want to find our car a nice home.

120
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,540
So I'm prepared to knock a grand off.

121
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:27,510
What do you say? I say knock off 5 grand, and we'll talk

122
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,100
Oh, come on. It's Already priced way below blue book,

123
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:32,790
Not to mention it's mint. This is not mint.

124
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,790
Hey,an you not see this ding in the bumper here?

125
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:40,390
Okay, this car goes zero to 60 in 5 seconds.

126
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,110
By the Time someone says, "wow, a ding,"

127
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,080
You're in the next county. 4 grand, you got yourself a deal.

128
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:46,690
Deal.

129
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,140
What? No! No, no deal!

130
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:52,080
The nondriving blind guy does not speak for me.

131
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,450
Would you excuse us?

132
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,100
Gaby, we've been trying to move this car for a month.

133
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,610
We need the cash.

134
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:01,110
God,sn't there any way we can keep it?

135
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,710
I mean, this car's the last thing I have

136
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,070
That tells the world, "i'm better than you."

137
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,000
Sorry, babe. We have to pay the mortgage.

138
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,930
We can't afford to be better than anyone.

139
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,230
Here.

140
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,520
Take good care of her.

141
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:25,080
Actually, it's not for us. It's for our nanny.

142
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,190
Okay, that one hurt.

143
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,410
So what'd you dig up on mr. X.?

144
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,830
You mean Dave? Yeah.

145
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,630
Nothing yet. It's been two days. What gives?

146
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,120
Well, for starters, when I search for "dave Williams,"

147
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,790
I get a million and a half hits.

148
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,830
To narrow it down, I'm gonna need more information,

149
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,530
Like where he was Born, where he went to school.

150
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,400
Did he serve Time in the military? Oh, believe me,

151
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,480
If he served Time, it was in the state pen.

152
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,830
Hey! Dave!

153
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,150
Morning, ladies.

154
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,520
Si bastard. How are you?

155
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,580
Hey, Katherine,

156
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,180
Your sprinkler system working okay now?

157
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,600
Like a charm. And thanks again.

158
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,630
I've never been able to get that to work. Oh, I hear ya.

159
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,320
To program those things, you need an engineering degree.

160
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,910
Oh, yeah? You got one of those?

161
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,170
Anyway... Really appreciate it.

162
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,070
Take care.

163
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,550
I just can't go through with this.

164
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,860
He--he just strikes me as so nice.

165
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,130
That's supposed to comfort me,

166
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,090
Given your track record with men?

167
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,260
Katherine, please.

168
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,270
The guy is bad news.

169
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,590
I can't prove it, but I feel it in my bones.

170
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,080
And I can't sit around doing nothing when I know

171
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:46,600
That Edie's waking up every morning next to him.

172
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,440
If anyone finds out we're doing this...

173
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,130
No one will know.

174
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,610
And when they do, they'll probably thank us.

175
00:07:56,450 --> 00:08:00,330
Because I'm telling ya, this guy is up to something.

176
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:07,160
Cleaning out the old garage-- my deepest sympathy.

177
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,640
Hey, Dave. You--you settling in okay?

178
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,220
Yeah. Yeah.

179
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,830
Well, they finally delivered my flat screen.

180
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:17,130
I was dying without it. I mean, it is 65 inches.

181
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:19,090
Wow. Sweet!

182
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:22,550
Hey, w--the play-offs are on. You should come check it out.

183
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,300
It's like being right on the field.

184
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,710
Yeah...

185
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,460
Um, Lynette's really busting my hump

186
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,340
About clearing this place out, so...

187
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,490
Well, Maybe later.

188
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,950
The game doesn't start for a couple hours.

189
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,950
We could order one of those giant

190
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,610
Sandwiches. Sorry, but, you know, check back with me

191
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,170
Make sure I survive this whole thing. Okay.

192
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,660
Hi, Dave.

193
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:40,960
Hi.

194
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,270
Hey, Tom?

195
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,350
Yeah?

196
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,430
Why are there two piles?

197
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:48,150
Well, that's the pile that I'm throwing away,

198
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,030
And, uh, this is the stuff I still need.

199
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,660
You need unopened mountain climbing equipment from 1986?

200
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,180
You don't climb mountains.

201
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,690
Not yet, but someday. I mean, you know... Who knows?

202
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,880
I know. You get winded just climbing out of the tub.

203
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,510
You're never gonna climb a mountain.

204
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,860
You know what else you're never gonna do?

205
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,990
Learn german, make your own beer or...

206
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,730
Have 8 minute abs.

207
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,760
Come on, not the ab-tastic. Toss it, and keep tossing

208
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:18,620
Until this 2-car garage can hold at least one car.

209
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,790
Please tell me you're not getting rid of your bass.

210
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,170
No point in hanging on to it.

211
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:31,660
I mean, being in a band is just one more thing I'll never do.

212
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,730
Before he moved, Mike and i,

213
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,950
We used to get together on saturdays and just... Jam.

214
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,390
Man, that was fun.

215
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,940
You know, I play the drums.

216
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,910
Maybe you and I should jam sometime.

217
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:48,970
I guess we could.

218
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,210
Maybe even later today? Just...

219
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,360
Yeah! Yeah, you know what? Just give me a couple hours.

220
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,610
I gotta stash these old "playboys." I'll see you later.

221
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:17,750
Now remember, you can't just start grilling Edie,

222
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,970
Or she'll get suspicious. We have to be subtle.

223
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,650
I'll just follow your lead.

224
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,290
Okay.

225
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,630
Sorry I'm late.

226
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,640
What a great idea!

227
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:33,990
I haven't done this in ages-- a fun lunch with the girls.

228
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,730
Yeah, it's fun.

229
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,850
Where was Dave Born?

230
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,590
What?

231
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,510
We were just wondering

232
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,330
Where he got his great... Manners.

233
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,010
He's got that gentle bearing

234
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,280
Of a... Southern gentleman.

235
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,730
No, he's from somewhere in the midwest.

236
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,480
"somewhere"?

237
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,540
You don't know where your husband grew up?

238
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,340
Well, he showed me a picture of his childhood home once.

239
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:01,310
It had a cow in it. I lost interest.

240
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,810
Honestly, Edie, how can you be married to a guy

241
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,340
And not know these things?

242
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,780
You know what? What?

243
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I think it's Time to order. Where's our waitress?

244
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,890
I'll be right with you, mrs. Mayfair.

245
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,340
Oh, no problem, Debbie. You take your Time.

246
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:16,600
She is such a sweet girl.

247
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,760
She's saving money for college.

248
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:23,030
Speaking of which... Where did Dave go to college?

249
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,950
Come on, Debbie! While we're young!

250
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,480
I don't know.

251
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:30,520
All right. What about high school?

252
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:32,190
Why are you asking me All these questions?

253
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,250
I just think it's odd that you're married to some guy--

254
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,730
You don't know anything about him.

255
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,920
Other than the fact that he's a lovely man.

256
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,000
He... Fixed my sprinkler.

257
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,710
I don't want to talk about this anymore.

258
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,240
I'm going to the ladies' room.

259
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:55,550
Well, your subtle approach got us nowhere.

260
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,800
I've been through a lot with this baby.

261
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,500
I hate to sell her, but, you know,

262
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,710
With my new sports car coming, I don't really need it.

263
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,900
Yeah. Here she is.

264
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,400
How's it look?

265
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,430
Be glad you're blind.

266
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,900
We have to be practical.

267
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:17,220
We just need something to get us from point "a" to point "b."

268
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,210
Now let's buy the thing. Okay, just let me handle this.

269
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,720
So... Do we have a sale?

270
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,630
I don't know, Andrew.

271
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:30,070
I mean... We like it. We don't love .

272
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,480
Yeah, well, no one buys a car like this and loves it.

273
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:35,810
It's All about the price. And you're not gonna do better.

274
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,210
Yeah, about that price--

275
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,250
You're gonna have to drop it. I mean, look at All these dents.

276
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,440
Yeah, it's Also missing three hubcaps,

277
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:45,470
And it's got a hanger for an antenna.

278
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,080
Full disclosure-- it's a piece of crap.

279
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:49,510
You want it or not?

280
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,050
Well, I'll tell you what.

281
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:54,480
Since your mom and I are dear friends,

282
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:56,950
I'll take it off your hands if you knock off $300.

283
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,590
And since my mom and you are dear friends,

284
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,740
I'll resist the urge to flip you the bird.

285
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,730
Andrew!

286
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,990
Unless you lower this price, we're walking... Right now.

287
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,860
See ya.

288
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,860
I mean it.

289
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,160
This is it.

290
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:13,060
Fine.

291
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:14,070
Fine.

292
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,010
Okay, fine. Knock off $200, and we'll give you cash.

293
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,070
No. $100.

294
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,870
No. Wh--

295
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,520
Will you at least have it washed?

296
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:34,620
I'll empty the ashtray. Final offer.

297
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:37,030
Damn you.

298
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:46,420
You beat me again!

299
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,870
Curse you and your diabolical checkers prowess.

300
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,990
All right, Orson.

301
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,940
Don't overexcite him on the upholstery.

302
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:58,400
So, Danielle, what would you like me to make as a side dish

303
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:00,110
For your welcome home party?

304
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:03,350
I can do anything so long as it complements beef tenderloin.

305
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,570
Actually, we don't eat meat. We're vegetarians.

306
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,470
Excuse me? So is Benjamin.

307
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:19,060
Oh. Well... Since when?

308
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:22,240
Since I realized that meat was a byproduct of murder.

309
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,020
Would it be more acceptable

310
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,500
If I shopped for a suicidal pork loin?

311
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,080
Bree, it's no big deal.

312
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,030
I'll just make a nice risotto.

313
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,040
This isn't about dinner.

314
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:35,230
This is about her nutty liberal politics

315
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,370
Getting in the way of our grandson's nutrition.

316
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:42,570
He gets All the protein he needs from cheese and beans d tofu.

317
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,730
Well, this isn't just about nutrition.

318
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:46,820
Do you want him to be teased at school

319
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:50,030
Every Time he pulls tofu out of his lunchbox?

320
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:53,260
Actually, that won't be an issue.

321
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,970
Danielle is homeschooling him.

322
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,780
Excuse me?

323
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,600
You're teaching him?

324
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,600
Yes. I take it you have an opinion?

325
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:05,120
So instead of sending him to a proper school,

326
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:06,300
You're gonna give him the benefit

327
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:08,880
Of your straight "c" average? Hey, he's only 6,

328
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:10,780
And he's Already reading at a third grade level.

329
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:13,110
Well, what happens next year when he overtakes you?

330
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,570
Uh, Bree... Ahem. Best behavior, remember?

331
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,240
I am sorry, but am I supposed to sit by

332
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,880
While she degrades his body and his mind?

333
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,070
Fine.

334
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,510
Cricize my parenting All you want.

335
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,270
I don't care,

336
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,640
Because you don't get to decide how he's raised anymore.

337
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,160
I'm his mother.

338
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,980
And by the way, Mark your calendars,

339
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,900
'cause seven years from next saturday--

340
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,030
Benjamin's bar mitzvah.

341
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:07,010
Isn't this cool? Dave brought his drums over so we could jam.

342
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,420
Your boy is pretty good. Yeah,

343
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:10,530
And we figured out we got bass, we got drums

344
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,570
Mike plays guitar. I think Orson plays keyboards.

345
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:17,100
You see where I am going with this? I do, but I'm hoping I'm wrong.

346
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,220
We're gonna start a garage band!

347
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,930
And I wasn't! Maybe if we get good enough,

348
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,540
We can even get, like, a couple of gigs.

349
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:27,070
How fun would that be? "gigs"? Did you just say "gigs"?

350
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:30,710
Now All's we need is a little Time to practice--

351
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,600
A few nights a week, some weekends.

352
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,110
What? Well, yeah,

353
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,560
Just until we get the rhythm section All diAled in.

354
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:41,510
Okay, I need to dial you in to some gigs you already have,

355
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,230
Which are running a restaurant, being a husband and a father.

356
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,760
And I thought you were the one who said

357
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,850
You wanted to spend more Time with your family.

358
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,760
But we could play clubs.

359
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:54,150
I mean, he's just having a little fun, Lynette.

360
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,730
Guys need to blow off steam.

361
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,130
Could you just... For a sec?

362
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:02,450
Come on. You know I'm right. You're far too busy for this.

363
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:12,070
You can't just decide for me like that.

364
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,330
I mean, if I wanna play bass,

365
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:17,130
I will play bass.

366
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,030
I'm not hurting anybody.

367
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,260
Those of us with hearing beg to differ.

368
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:22,620
Okay, you know what?

369
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:24,690
Please leave our rehearsal space.

370
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,620
Oh, come on, Tom. This is not your--

371
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,790
Guys, hey, knock it off back there.

372
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,340
Oh, god. What now?

373
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,880
Oh. Hey. What's up?

374
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,380
You sold me a lemon.

375
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:17,520
That's what's up.

376
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,100
What are you talking about?

377
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,120
Your car!

378
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:23,180
I took it to a mechanic, who told me the radiator's shot.

379
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:25,460
Oh. That. Yeah.

380
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,050
It's been giving me trouble for years. Just use the jug.

381
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,350
What jug?

382
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,650
Oh, it's in the trunk. You just keep it full of water,

383
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,850
And when the radiator overheats, you fill it up.

384
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,770
Oh, and, uh, try not going up hills

385
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,550
And stay in the shade as much as possible.

386
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:43,700
Okay, i-i can't drive around avoiding gravity and the sun.

387
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,130
Well, sorry.

388
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:48,250
If you want a car with no flaws, buy a new one.

389
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,270
Or I could get the radiator fixed,

390
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,250
Which is gonna cost $300, whichyouare paying for.

391
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,640
Remember full disclosure? Crap?

392
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,380
This is your car. It's your problem.

393
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,780
Okay, you know what? That's it. I wanna talk to your mother.

394
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:05,780
Uh, well, she's in a meeting right now.

395
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,450
Can I take a message? Damn it, Andrew.

396
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,550
You tell Bree to call me by the end of the day.

397
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:13,740
May I ask what it's regarding?

398
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,260
All right, we'll talk about it more later, buddy.

399
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,590
Why don't you go on outside and play for a while? Okay.

400
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,850
Well, what did he say? Well, he still won't tell me who's picking on him,

401
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,120
But he did ask me to teach him how to

402
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:33,410
Fight.He's only 5. I don't want him fighting

403
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,820
I'm sorry, b every boy

404
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:37,270
Has to learn how to throw a punch eventually. Ugh.

405
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:38,970
You know, if you wanna give him a leg up,

406
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:42,580
You could teach him a little capoeira. Capo-what?

407
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,410
Oh, it's a brazilian martial art

408
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,960
That incorporates dance.

409
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,690
Yeah, 'cause there's nothing scarier

410
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,750
Than a guy coming at ya with jazz hands. That's funny, but actually,

411
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,410
The dance part's to catch your opponent off guard.

412
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,660
Like that? No, there's a little more nuance to it.

413
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,140
Ooh! Like that.

414
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:01,500
Where's the "dance" part?

415
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:04,620
Oh! There it is, ginger!

416
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,670
You know what, boys? Not in the house.

417
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:12,030
Oh, my god!

418
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,450
Give it back! It's my ball! It's my ball now.

419
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,010
Hey! You leave him Alone.

420
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,440
Oh! Honey!

421
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:25,330
Is that who's been picking on you? Juanita Solis?

422
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:28,730
Well, she is going to get a big surprise,

423
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,770
Because your daddy

424
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,440
Is about to turn you into a killing machine.

425
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:35,860
Uh, m.J., can I talk to your mom for a second?

426
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,040
What?

427
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:44,130
I can't teach him to hit a girl.

428
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:47,170
That's not just any girl. You saw her.

429
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,090
She could take down a small deer.

430
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:50,510
It doesn't Matter.

431
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,430
If it wears a skirt, it's off-limits.

432
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,750
That is sexi.

433
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:56,580
If feminism means anything, it's that it's okay

434
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,880
For a big, mean girl to get her butt kicked.

435
00:20:58,890 --> 00:20:59,930
You, teach him

436
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:03,160
One of those brazilian kung fu cha-cha things.

437
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:05,220
I'm with Mike.

438
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,740
You can't hit girls.

439
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,790
Ah! Couple of wusses.

440
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,210
I'll handle it myself.

441
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,680
Oops! Didn't see that coming.

442
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:18,700
Just for that, I'm breaking my rule about not hitting girls.

443
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:23,060
Ga, we have a problem.

444
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,670
I just saw Juanita push m.J. Down.

445
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,110
Really?

446
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,040
Really.

447
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:30,340
It's not the first Time. Juanita's been bullying him.

448
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,850
Wow. I'm sorry. I'll talk to her.

449
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:34,990
Thank you.

450
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,640
And don't worry. No one will hear about this from me.

451
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,130
Hear what?

452
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:42,160
That m.J.'s getting beat up by a little girl.

453
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:43,740
Well...

454
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,730
A girl.

455
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,220
Are you suggesting

456
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:50,290
That Juanita is fat for her age?

457
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,910
Gaby, Juanita's fat for your age.

458
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,200
Yeah? Well, let's face it.

459
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:57,020
M.J. Could get beaten up by a kitten.

460
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:58,460
You know what?

461
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,340
Maybe you could teach your daughter

462
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:03,580
How to use her words and not her fists.

463
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:08,900
Yeah? Or Maybe you could teach your son to grow a pair!

464
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:19,880
What you looking at?

465
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:22,290
Oh, just some old pictures.

466
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:25,060
Can you guess who that little girl is?

467
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,660
That's your mom way back when she was your age.

468
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:33,120
What's she eating?

469
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,780
Oh! Uh, a hot dog.

470
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:37,310
No way.

471
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,980
Oh, yes. Your mother loved hot dogs.

472
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:41,810
Every day at lunchtime, she'd say to me,

473
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,310
"mommy, I want hot dog."

474
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,340
How come she doesn't eat them now?

475
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:48,820
Well, because she's All grown-up.

476
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,900
You see, hot dogs and hamburgers

477
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:52,490
Are what make little boys and girls

478
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,700
Grow up to be big and strong.

479
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:57,180
And now that she's grown-up, she doesn't need them anymore.

480
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,710
Doesn't mommy want me to be big and strong?

481
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,370
I've been asking myself that All day.

482
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:06,120
Maybe she's afraid if you get big,

483
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:09,100
You'll leave home and go play for the red sox.

484
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,680
But I want to get big. I want to play baseball.

485
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,030
Oh. Well...

486
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,280
In that case...

487
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:23,840
Can i?

488
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,340
You have to promise not to tell your mommy.

489
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:27,970
Okay.

490
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,620
Well, what do you think?

491
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:37,740
It's like tofu, only better.

492
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,820
Yes.

493
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,670
Yes, it is.

494
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,080
Two three four

495
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,820
When Tom Scavo through himself

496
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,700
Into his new hobby.

497
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,690
His wife told herself

498
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,980
It was a phase, and it would pass quickly.

499
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:05,600
But three hours later, she realized

500
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,560
It could not pass quickly enough.

501
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,300
So Lynette began to plot

502
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:17,910
Against her husband's instrument of torture.

503
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,330
Ooh! Careful, honey.

504
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,140
Sorry.

505
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:25,450
You could break your dad's guitar and...

506
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:28,650
It was at that moment her daughter

507
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:33,070
Provided her an idea for a... Simple accident...

508
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:38,760
And... A clean Alibi.

509
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,860
Damn it!

510
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,690
Hey, is everything All right? Oh, my!

511
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,750
It was lying in the middle of the floor!

512
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,140
How in the world did that happen? Has Penny been playing in here again?

513
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:59,750
I've told her a million Times!

514
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,710
Now I'm sure it was an accident, Tom. Please don't yell at her.

515
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,000
This was a $1,600 bass.

516
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:06,890
I can't afford to replace it.

517
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:09,040
Penny Lynn Scavo!

518
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,120
Where is she?

519
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,480
Oh, Tom!

520
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:15,580
She's up in her room.

521
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,970
I'm gonna go play outside.

522
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:27,210
Oh! Wait. Your forgot your whistle.

523
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,460
Okay, sweetie.

524
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,790
This is just to be on the safe side.

525
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,950
If Juanita comes around, you just blow it.

526
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,230
I'll be right there. Okay.

527
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,350
Good boy.

528
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:52,700
Hey, give me back my whistle!

529
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:57,710
Juanita Solis, don't you move! You are in big trouble!

530
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,930
What's on your head?

531
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,760
Never mind.

532
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:04,300
What did you do to m.J.?

533
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,040
He wouldn't let me blow his whistle.

534
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:09,480
So your solution was to push him down?

535
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:11,000
Do you think that's nice?

536
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,840
How would you feel if someone did that to you? I wouldn't care.

537
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:17,340
Oh, really? You don't think it would hurt?

538
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,580
Even if it did...

539
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:22,050
I'm not a crybaby like m.J.

540
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,440
I'm sorry.

541
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:33,360
Juanita, I just wanted you to see how it felt.

542
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:35,090
Are you okay?

543
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,000
Susan, I saw that!

544
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,320
Kids, get inside!

545
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:41,710
Okay, first off, it wasn't as bad as it looked.

546
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,290
Really? 'cause it looked like you body-slammed my daughter.

547
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,870
I barely tapped her. She was milking it.

548
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,750
That's your defense? You were only assaulting her "a little"?

549
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,550
I was trying to teach her not to be a bully--

550
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,810
Something she should have learned from her mother.

551
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:57,510
Well, I'm sorry. I was too busy trying to explain to her

552
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,190
Why m.J. Doesn't wear a dress like All the other little girls.

553
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,610
This conversation is over.

554
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:06,170
Tell BoB and Lee that I'll pay for the dent in their lawn.

555
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,370
You did not!

556
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,790
I did.

557
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:15,040
You know what?

558
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:18,350
We've both been incredibly childish here,

559
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,300
And it is Time one of us took the high road,

560
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:22,390
So I am now going to walk away.

561
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,390
Please take note of this conflict resolution

562
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,100
And try to pass the lesson on to your daughter.

563
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,270
You can dye that hair All you want,

564
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,220
But the gray's just gonna keep coming.

565
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:45,580
And they call me white trash.

566
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,520
You got a minute? Yeah. Sure. Come on in.

567
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,430
I, uh, I heard there was a little accident.

568
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,730
So...

569
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,230
I got this for Tom.

570
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:07,600
You bought Tom a new bass?

571
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:10,220
It's not as smooth as his old one, but it's good.

572
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:12,120
We can't accept this.

573
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:15,390
It's mostly selfish on my part. I was having too much fun.

574
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,630
Well, sorry.

575
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,390
But Maybe you could go skateboarding with Orson.

576
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,730
All right.

577
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,900
Forget about me.

578
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,690
Tom was having fun.

579
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:28,650
And from what I've seen, he needs it.

580
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:33,970
And what makes you think you know what my husband needs?

581
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,810
Just something that I saw the other day,

582
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:39,260
When you were making him get rid of All his things.

583
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:41,420
You mean his junk?

584
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:42,770
It May be junk to you,

585
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:43,930
But to Tom...

586
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,020
Well, that was stuff he was gonna get around to.

587
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,850
You know what a midlife crisis is?

588
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:56,270
I'm married to a 45-year-old man who has a red convertible.

589
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,730
Yeah, I think I know.

590
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:01,770
But you know how it happens? A man gets to a certain age,

591
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:05,810
And he realizes... He's gonna die someday.

592
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:08,280
Really die.

593
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:13,600
And what's worse is that he's everything he's ever gonna be.

594
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,120
He's never gonna be rich.

595
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,490
He's never gonna climb a mountain.

596
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:24,700
Now some guys do bad things

597
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:26,680
When they get those thoughts in their heads.

598
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,050
By comparison,

599
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:31,280
Playing in a garage band-- well...

600
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,340
It seems pretty harmless.

601
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:41,930
So... Now my marriage is in trouble,

602
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,960
And you're gonna save it by giving Tom a bass?

603
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:47,020
No. No. I'm not.

604
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,520
You are.

605
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,710
Most of the guys in my class went into corporate law,

606
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,180
But I wanted to do something

607
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:13,250
That would influence environmental policy.

608
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,330
That's how he ended up at the e.P.A.

609
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,080
So, Leo, where did you study law?

610
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:26,150
Cornell.

611
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,280
Now I'm jealous.

612
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:29,320
I Always wished that I'd gone to a school like cornell.

613
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:32,580
But... It just wasn't in the cards for me.

614
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,260
How about you, Dave?

615
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:37,230
Me? No. Wasn't in my cards, either.

616
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,610
So where did you go?

617
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,860
After listening to Leo, I'd be embarrassed to tell you.

618
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:43,310
So... E.P.A.

619
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:45,450
What's your opinion on global warming--

620
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,760
Fact or fiction?

621
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:48,480
Hold on, Darling.

622
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:50,590
Mrs. Mccluskey asked you a question.

623
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,880
Tell her where you went to school.

624
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:59,700
Oh, Edie, I think she was just making conversation. So--

625
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:01,660
Okay, then why don't you tell me where you went?

626
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,770
After All, I am your wife. Shouldn't I know?

627
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:16,550
Actually, I didn't go to college.

628
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,520
I took a job out of high school

629
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:24,670
Because my family was having a hard Time.

630
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:28,940
Not having a degree is something that has Always

631
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:30,330
Been embarrassing to me,

632
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:33,590
Especially when I'm with people who do.

633
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,480
So, my darling, is there anything else

634
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:42,270
You'd like to quiz me about in public?

635
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,560
My... Childhood stuttering?

636
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,270
My dad's drinking problems?

637
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:53,280
No. I'm... Good.

638
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,330
I came to say I'm sorry.

639
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:03,760
You attacked my child and then me.

640
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:05,500
Why should I even listen to you?

641
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,200
I brought booze.

642
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,760
Come on in.

643
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,090
Like, I have this rule--

644
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,900
No toy guns.

645
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:19,830
Except everything that m.J. Picks up--

646
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,110
Whether it's a hairbrush, a hanger, everything--

647
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:26,860
He pretends it's a gun. Well, what do you expect? He's a boy.

648
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,370
That's my point!

649
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,910
I know nothing about raising boys.

650
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,870
And I think m.J. Has figured this out,

651
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,310
So he goes straight to Mike whenever there's a problem.

652
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,490
But that's okay. Mike's a great dad.

653
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,520
Yeah, sure, on Alternate weekends.

654
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:42,990
That's fine...

655
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,920
Until... M.J. Needs his daddy,

656
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:47,440
And his daddy's not there.

657
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:50,590
San, it's not your fault.

658
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,190
Well, we split up,

659
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,580
So it's at least half my fault any way you slice it.

660
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,900
Well, if it's any consolation,

661
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:03,000
Carlos is a hands-on, full-time dad,

662
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:06,290
And I still feel like I'm not getting the job done,

663
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:09,190
Like... I'm not preparing them enough.

664
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:11,950
Preparing them for what?

665
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,610
For how hard life is.

666
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:14,990
I mean, I have to admit,

667
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,400
When you told me Juanita was bullying m.J.,

668
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:19,370
My first thought was, thank god!

669
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,320
Let her do the pushing,

670
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,240
Just as long as she's not a victim.

671
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,960
Well, I don't see any kid of yours being a victim.

672
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,270
You're the strongest person I know.

673
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,130
I used to be.

674
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,520
Look at my life, Susan.

675
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:39,750
I...

676
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,800
I've been beaten down.

677
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:48,100
Well, I thought I had you beaten today,

678
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:51,150
And next think i knew, I was eathing grass.

679
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:55,310
Today doesn't count. Today I was mad.

680
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:00,770
Maybe you need to get mad more often.

681
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:06,250
Maybe you're right.

682
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:09,090
This is nice.

683
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:10,980
We should rumble All the Time.

684
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:15,000
To Susan Mayer--

685
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:16,420
Good mom.

686
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:19,030
To Gabrielle Solis--

687
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,670
Another good mom.

688
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,000
Mommy, we're hungry!

689
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:27,960
So?! There's waffles in the freezer!

690
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,110
And get mommy some ice!

691
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,990
Isn't this nice?

692
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:37,320
For the first Time in years,

693
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:40,180
My family is All here under the same roof.

694
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:43,180
Here's to many more meals together.

695
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:45,560
Yes. Aw. Welcome home. Cheers.

696
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:48,990
I don't feel good, Danielle.

697
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:50,160
"danielle"?

698
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:55,000
I think I'm gonna be sick. Let's get you to the powder room.

699
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,150
Here we are--

700
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,120
Mushroom risotto.

701
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:07,640
There's an unfortunate coincidence.

702
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:09,900
I'm so sorry, mom. I'll clean it up.

703
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:12,980
No, um, you take Benjy upstairs. I'll get it.

704
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:15,750
Orson, could you get the mop, please?

705
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,350
Oh, my god. Is that meat?

706
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:22,270
No!

707
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,470
Of course not.

708
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,050
Does this look like meat to you?

709
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,710
It's... Hard to tell.

710
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:28,980
Just so we're clear,

711
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:31,580
What I'm about to throw up is a western omelet.

712
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,180
That is not meat.

713
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,150
That piece right there-- that's definitely meat!

714
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:38,140
Still waiting on that mop.

715
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,680
What did grandma give you to eat?

716
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:42,240
She said not to tell.

717
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,730
You gave him meat and then told him to lie?!

718
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,090
I gave him a hot dog, All right?

719
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,330
He liked it so much, he asked for another.

720
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,100
Two hot dogs?

721
00:35:58,270 --> 00:35:59,030
All right,

722
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,130
I'll concede the second one was clearly a mistake.

723
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:05,460
Come on, Leo. We're leaving.

724
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:08,160
No! Danielle, please. I'm sorry, Orson.

725
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:10,410
She's made it impossible for us to stay in this house.

726
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,350
Danielle, wait, wait.

727
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,950
Well, we can still drink, right?

728
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,050
Oh, yeah.

729
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:27,220
Well, I've apologized till I'm blue in the face,

730
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:29,130
But they're still leaving in the morning.

731
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,740
Now you're not speaking to me, either?

732
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,960
They're just mad.

733
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:41,720
Things will be better next Time.

734
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,050
You honestly think there'll be a next Time?

735
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:48,000
It took us three years to talk them into this visit.

736
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,430
It took you one day...

737
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,920
To ruin it.

738
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:53,270
Orson, I'm truly sorry.

739
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:56,330
It's just, seeing...

740
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:58,890
All these mistakes that she's making with Benjamin,

741
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,480
It's just so hard for me.

742
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,170
You know what hard for me?

743
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:06,240
When I left for prison,

744
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:09,640
Benjamin was in my house, he was in my life.

745
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,690
He called me "daddy."

746
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,160
And when I came home, he was gone.

747
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,220
And you think that's my fault?

748
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:23,300
Yes, I do.

749
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,810
Orson, you weren't here.

750
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:29,430
She came back. She was married to a lawyer.

751
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,790
And don't forget, she is his mother!

752
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,710
I tried to fight, but--

753
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,380
You should've fought harder.

754
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,910
I was on my knees. I was sobbing.

755
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,600
She said "no" and then ripped him out of my arms.

756
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:45,110
You have no right to say that to me.

757
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,400
You kind of blindsided me tonight.

758
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,170
I know. I am so sorry.

759
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:08,030
I was clearly uncomfortable.

760
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:11,110
I don't understand why you kept pressing me.

761
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:16,690
Honestly, it was All Karen Mccluskey's fault.

762
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,920
Really? How so?

763
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:23,250
Well, she kept asking me All this stuff about yr background

764
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,400
And why I don't know more about you, and...

765
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,230
I should've just never let her get to me.

766
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,220
It's okay, sweetie.

767
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,440
Now I understand.

768
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:43,620
Kind of sad when you think about it.

769
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:47,480
What do you mean? Oh... Maybe you guys don't notice

770
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:49,000
Because you're so used to her.

771
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,350
But her behavior reminds me of my grandmother,

772
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,980
When we first started to notice...

773
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:57,450
The dementia, that is.

774
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:00,130
You think Karen's going senile?

775
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:02,910
I remember my poor grandmother...

776
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,600
Started getting so paranoid.

777
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:10,420
She thought people were breaking into her house and...

778
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,800
Stealing her things.

779
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:16,480
We finally had to put her in a home.

780
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:21,800
I just hope that doesn't happen to Karen.

781
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,340
I want my 300 bucks.

782
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:42,810
I told you. It's your car. You deal with it.

783
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:44,810
That's it? No compassion?

784
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,440
No, "hey, let's split the bill and call it even"?

785
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:51,240
Look at it this way. You're not losing 300 bucks.

786
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:54,510
You're gaining a valuable lesson--buyer beware.

787
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:58,430
True. Now here's a valuable lesson for you.

788
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,270
What t hell is wrong with you?! Give me my money,

789
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,870
Or next Time we're trading paint. You're bluffing.

790
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,510
I am tired of being a victim, Andrew.

791
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,730
And trust me, that is no bluff.

792
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:20,850
Hey! You--you touch my car, and you're paying for it.

793
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:24,550
Luckily, I'm insured. Oh, wait. Our policy lapsed.

794
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:26,370
Hope you've got good coverage.

795
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:31,830
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait, wait.

796
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:33,930
I'll get my checkbook.

797
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,750
I prefer cash.

798
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:42,520
Bullies...

799
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,190
Any adult will tell you the playground

800
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,870
Is not the only place to find them.

801
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:54,060
Everywhere you look, you can find people unconcerned

802
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:57,170
Or unaware of the pain they inflict.

803
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,480
It might be a neighbor

804
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,390
Preying on the suspicions of her friend...

805
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,560
Or a daughter

806
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,550
Punishing the choices of her mother.

807
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,210
Or a housewife seeking justice

808
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,850
From the man who sold her a car.

809
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:22,950
Yes...

810
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,420
There are bullies everywhere.

811
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:29,940
And the worst are the ones who take advantage of you

812
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,530
Without you ever knowing

813
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,170
What they've done.
