1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,100
Does this relationship have a future?

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,000
Can't we just keep going the way we are?

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,600
Jackson left.

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,500
Orson's lying to me again.

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,700
Bree made a decision.

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,500
So I think I have to divorce him.

7
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,800
Karl signed up.

8
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,700
Karl, what are you doing here?

9
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,400
Well, I just enrolled Evan.
Wow.

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,000
And Susan confessed.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Mike and I got in a car accident.

12
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,100
Mike was driving, right?

13
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,100
That's what we said, but it wasn't true.

14
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,600
He took the blame for me.

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,200
On this street, the bargaining begins at sunrise...

16
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,900
an old woman offers a paperboy a generous tip

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,200
If he'll throw the paper onto her porch...

18
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,600
a wife tells her husband she'll make his favorite dinner

19
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,300
if he'll bring home roses...

20
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,300
a man tells his neighbor he'll take in his garbage cans

21
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,600
the day she finally mows her lawn.

22
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,900
Yes, on Wisteria Lane,

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,600
everyone knows how to bargain... 

24
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,500
absolutely everyone.

25
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,800
I don't want oatmeal. Can I have pancakes?

26
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,300
Katherine's not a short order cook, buddy.

27
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,400
If she made oatmeal for breakfast, we're having oatmeal.

28
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,300
I tell you what, M.J. if you finish just half of it,

29
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,000
I will make candied apples for your sleepover.

30
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,800
I love candy apples.

31
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,300
She's letting you off easy. You should thank her.

32
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,600
Thank you, Katherine.

33
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,400
You are so welcome, you sweet thing.

34
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,200
Dad, are you gonna marry Katherine?

35
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,100
Um...

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,700
that's, um...

37
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,900
I don't know.

38
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,700
Why not?

39
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,700
Oh, well,

40
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,000
Oh, because we haven't talked about marriage.

41
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,900
Why not?

42
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,900
M.J., you're being rude.

43
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,800
Oh, I'm not offended.

44
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,600
Don't you wanna marry Katherine?

45
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,200
Well...

46
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,700
I love her.

47
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,200
She's absolutely fantastic.

48
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,400
So why don't you marry her?

49
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,800
Can you help me out here?

50
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,500
Are you kidding?

51
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,100
Buddy, um, when it comes to marriage,

52
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,300
The truth is...

53
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,100
Wow. Would you look at the time?

54
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,600
I'm late for work.

55
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,900
We're gonna have to talk about this later.

56
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,900
Coward.

57
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,500
You got that right.

58
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,600
How'd I do?

59
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,100
You were great.

60
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,200
But he didn't answer me.

61
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,600
Doesn't matter.

62
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,700
Issue's on the table.

63
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,800
Yes, on this street,

64
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,800
the negotiating begins at sunrise,

65
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,400
and it doesn't end...

66
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,700
here's the ice cream I promised you.

67
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,900
Until someone gets exactly what they want.

70
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,000
Walter Bergen was a divorce lawyer,

71
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,600
And the women who hired him always had something to say

72
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,100
about the men they were divorcing.

73
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,700
He's always talking to his grandmother,

74
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,300
Who died six years ago.

75
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,800
He spends all his money on hookers,

76
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,900
who may or may not be women.

77
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,900
He says he needs more money for the children,

78
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,900
and by "children," I mean racehorses.

79
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,700
Yes, Walter Bergen thought he had heard it all

80
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,500
Until the day when one of his clients actually said...

81
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,500
my husband is a decent man, and I want to do right by him.

82
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,500
Women who seek my services rarely take that attitude.

83
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,500
Welli like to think of myself as a good person.

84
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,900
I'm sure you are.

85
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,200
And I wouldn't worry about your husband.

86
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,900
The income he'll derive from his half of
the catering business alone should... 

87
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,200
Wait. I'm not planning on giving him half.

88
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,400
It's my business.

89
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,200
Which you started after you were married.

90
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,800
That entitles him to half.

91
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,600
I... I may have overstated things when
I described my husband as a decent man.

92
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,500
He actually has a wide variety of psychological problems.

93
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,300
Mrs. Hodge, it's state law. What do you want me to say?

94
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,700
I want you to say that for $300 an hour,

95
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,800
you have some lawyer tricks up your
sleeve to help me protect my business.

96
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,800
Surely you're not asking me to do something criminal?

97
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,600
Mrs. Hodge, didn't you say You like
to think of yourself as a good person?

98
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:42,800
Well, clearly, I like to think of myself
as a rich person even more.

99
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,100
Oh! Full house. Bree takes the high. Gaby gets the low.

100
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,000
Split the pot.
Oh, I hate splitting the pot.

101
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,100
Well, that's the rule. There's nothing you can do about it.

102
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,800
So stop bitching.

103
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,600
Well, you can't talk to me like that.

104
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,900
I am the wife of Fairview's latino businessman of the year.

105
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,300
Hey!
So he finally won?

106
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,400
Yeah.

107
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,100
There's gonna be a huge dinner,

108
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,800
and we're taking a picture with the mayor and his wife.

109
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,400
Oh, not necessarily. I hear they're getting divorced,

110
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,000
and it's gonna get ugly.

111
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,500
Really? How do you know?

112
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,900
The wife hired the sleaziest,

113
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,300
most unethical divorce lawyer in town.

114
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,500
Oh. Who... who's that?

115
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,800
My ex-husband.

116
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,200
Oh, right. Karl's a divorce lawyer.

117
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,800
Yeah, and a total shark.

118
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,300
The worst thing about our divorce was
that I couldn't hire him to represent me.

119
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,500
But I thought you just split everything done the middle.

120
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,600
Oh, not with Karl.

121
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:40,100
By the time he's done finding loopholes and hiding assets,

122
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,300
there's nothing left to split.

123
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,300
You don't say.

124
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,700
Hey, ladies.

125
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,000
Uh, Lynette, ahem. It's getting kinda late.

126
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,100
Are you kicking us out, Tom?

127
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,400
Uh, no. No, just reminding Lynette
that it's, uh, ten minutes till midnight,

128
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,800
which means ten minutes till tomorrow.

129
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,000
I got it. I'll be right up.

130
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,000
What was that about?

131
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,000
Tom and I are reading this book that suggests couples make a pact

132
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,700
to have sex every night for a month.

133
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,500
Let me guess. Written by a guy?

134
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,000
Was his name Carlos Solis?

135
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,000
We've been having some problems,

136
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,300
so the theory is it creates intimacy and brings you closer.

137
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,200
Is it working?
I've gotta say it is.

138
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,700
You become more attuned to each
other's needs and more sensitive to... 

139
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:32,100
Lynette!
Jeez! Two seconds!

140
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,700
We... we should go.

141
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,600
No, we're in our third week. We got this down to a science.

142
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,000
Just deal me out a few hands.

143
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,900
Juanita, hurry up. The bus will be here any minute.

144
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,700
Be right down!

145
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,800
There's an extra piece of cinnamon toast on the table.

146
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,700
Not hungry. Bye!

147
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,600
Susan? It's Dave.

148
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,800
Hey, remember I was telling you about my
buddy that owns that boat on bass lake?

149
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,000
Yeah, well, he's not using it this weekend,

150
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,900
so I thought maybe I'd take you and M.J. fishing.

151
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,100
Yeah, I know it's short notice,

152
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,700
but I really wanted to do something to thank you.

153
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,200
You've been so good to me since Edie died.

154
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,300
Plus I know M.J. would love it.

155
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,800
Great. I'm really looking forward to it.

156
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,300
Bye.

157
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,900
Hello?

158
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,500
Oh, hi, principal Hardy. What's up?

159
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,200
She's wearing what?

160
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,100
Now march in there and wipe that stuff off!

161
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,300
You don't have to yell.

162
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,300
Yes, I do.

163
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,800
Do you have any idea how humiliating
it was for me to get that call today?

164
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:30,700
Now every parent in town is gonna think that
I let my 6-year-old wear makeup to school!

165
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,300
And I want my makeup back. Is it in here?

166
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,800
Why do you have this?

167
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,400
Juanita.

168
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,800
I was trying to look like you.

169
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,900
Why?

170
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,600
Some girls at school saw you pick me up yesterday and

171
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,800
told me I must be adopted.

172
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,500
They said I wasn't pretty enough to be your daughter.

173
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,000
How's it feeling, Mr. McCluskey?

174
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,100
I-It's really throbbing. Oh, please hurry.

175
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,400
Hi there.

176
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,700
Jackson, hey. You're back.

177
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,500
I needed to talk to you.

178
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,100
Why didn't you call?

179
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,400
I wanted to surprise you.

180
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,600
Well, you did.

181
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,000
Ahem.

182
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,700
Oh, uh, right.

183
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,800
Jackson, you remember Mrs. McCluskey, don't you?

184
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,900
Sure. How are you, Mrs. McCluskey?

185
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,900
Oh, I'm in agonizing pain. Thanks for asking.

186
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,700
I'm taking her to the doctor so he can perform a little procedure.

187
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,100
He's gonna lance a boil on my backside.

188
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,700
It may rupture any second.

189
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,500
Okay.

190
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,500
I just had my car detailed, so I should probably go.

191
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,900
No problem.

192
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,500
Uh, when can I see you?

193
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,800
Um...

194
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,600
how about dinner tomorrow night?

195
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,400
Sounds great.

196
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,300
If you two want to keep staring at each other,

197
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,900
I can just go lay down on the lawn and die.

198
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,900
I don't mind.

199
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,800
I'll see you tomorrow.

200
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,100
Karl.
Hey, Mike.

201
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,900
Heard M.J.'s having a sleepover.

202
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,300
I thought I'd hit you up for an invitation.

203
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,100
Aren't you a little old for sleepovers?

204
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,200
Cards on the table. I need your help.

205
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,500
Evan's one of the only boys in class who wasn't invited,

206
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,100
and he's really upset.

207
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,000
Okay, cards on the table. M.J. says Evan's a bully,

208
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,000
and he doesn't want him at his sleepover.

209
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,600
Well, what if I promise Evan will be on his best behavior?

210
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,300
I'm sorry. It's out of my hands.

211
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,900
M.J. finalized his guest list.

212
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,200
Well, I think if you check that list again,

213
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,100
you'll notice Evan's name's on there.

214
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,100
I'm M.J.'s dad,

215
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,100
not his bouncer.

216
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,700
But...

217
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,000
thanks.

218
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,000
Hey, honey. How's your day going?

219
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,700
Very exciting. Just got back from the grocery store.

220
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,700
It is double coupon day, sorta like the Oscars

221
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,900
and the super bowl all rolled into one.

222
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,300
Did you remember to get my, um...

223
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,100
my special deodorant?

224
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,300
I sure did.

225
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,200
Milady's armpits will be aluminum-free.

226
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,000
How is your day?

227
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,900
I'm totally slammed, which is why I'm calling.

228
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,700
It looks like I'm gonna be here late tonight,

229
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,300
and by "late," I mean past midnight.

230
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,200
Wait. W... what about our pact?

231
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,400
We'll... double up tomorrow.

232
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,800
Lynette, I have been looking forward to this all day.

233
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,100
I know, and I'm really sorry. Listen, I gotta go.

234
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,600
I will call you later. I love you. Bye.

235
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,600
Tom. What are you doing here? Is everything all right?

236
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,600
Everything's fine.

237
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,300
Well, then what are you doing...

238
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,700
here?

239
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,500
Oh, no.

240
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,200
Are you crazy?

241
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,800
Crazy about you, baby.

242
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,300
But I have so much to do,

243
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,200
and I'm not gonna be done till 2:00 a.m.

244
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,100
Possibly 3:00.

245
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,100
Whoo!
Come on.

246
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,300
This is important. Remember what the book said?

247
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,800
Every night, no matter what.

248
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:30,900
No, this is a really bad time for me.

249
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,600
Well, you did buy me that deodorant.

250
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,800
Ooh!

251
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,100
Lynette, I have Carlos on line two.

252
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,500
Uh, tell him I'll call right back.

253
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,400
He says it's really important.

254
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,500
Hello?

255
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,900
Hey, Lynette. I'm over here at capital consultants,

256
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,300
and the guys have a question.
I need you to pull up their account.

257
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,900
Now? I'm kind of busy!

258
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,500
Well, the ad has to be at the printer's by noon, so yeah, now.

259
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,100
Lynette?

260
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,900
Lynette!

261
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,000
Yes?

262
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,500
What's going on? You all right?

263
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,100
Sorry.

264
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,800
Just had the handyman in here, but he's finished.

265
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,300
Thank you, handyman.

266
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,600
You're welcome, ma'am.

267
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,200
So... Carlos...

268
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,600
where were we?

269
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,400
Could I get you something?

270
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,400
No, thanks, I don't drink.

271
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,000
Oh, that's right.

272
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,800
Glug glug. I remember now.

273
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,200
I'm bringing you business, Karl. Try not to insult me.

274
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,700
Sorry.

275
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,700
So you want to divorce Orson.

276
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,600
Yes, I know that comes as a surprise.

277
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,500
Not really. I've met him.

278
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,000
The guy's a stiff.

279
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,100
Karl, if we move forward,

280
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,600
I will insist you handle our divorce with dignity.

281
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,900
Are you sure?

282
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,400
I don't know of a dignified way to screw a spouse out of money

283
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,900
that they, by law, are entitled to.

284
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,100
That is why you're hiring me, right?

285
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,900
I just want to protect what is rightfully mine.

286
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,700
Can you help me?

287
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,600
Sure.

288
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:28,300
Lovely. I'll make out a check.
Yeah, not so fast.

289
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,100
Uh, I said I could do it, not that I would.

290
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,300
I need a favor.

291
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,600
Well, what kind of a favor?

292
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:42,300
M.J. Delfino is having a sleepover at his house in two days.

293
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,400
My son wasn't invited. Now his feelings are hurt.

294
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,600
So?

295
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,800
So I want you to get my son into that sleepover.

296
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,700
How would I go about doing that?

297
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,200
Gosh, I don't know.

298
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,900
How would I go about hiding your assets from Orson?

299
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,800
I need your help, Karl. I really do,

300
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,900
but I am not comfortable manipulating a 6-year-old.

301
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,100
Mm-hmm.

302
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,600
You know, I had this one client...

303
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,400
his wife had been with him since junior high.

304
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,200
She supported him through med school,

305
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,200
gave him three kids and the best years of her life.

306
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,900
Once I had done my particular brand of legal magic,

307
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,700
he ended up with 90% of the money,

308
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,300
and she ended up in a studio apartment...

309
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,400
with a roommate.

310
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,000
Then again...

311
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,900
M.J. does...

312
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,800
love my macaroons.

313
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,200
Sweetie don't listen to those kids, they are idiot.

314
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,900
You are a gorgeous little girl.

315
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,500
You have to say that. You're my dad.

316
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,800
No, it's the truth. You are naturally beautiful.

317
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,200
Makeup just covers that up.

318
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,200
He's right, sweetie. You don't
need all that gunk on your face.

319
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,200
Then why do you wear it?
Because I'm an adult.

320
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,900
And besides, I hardly wear any.

321
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,700
Come on, Gaby. Let's try to keep this real.

322
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,600
Are you gonna wear makeup when daddy gets his big award?

323
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,400
Well, it's a big, fancy dinner. Of course.

324
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,900
But that's not fair.
Sweetie, you're 6.

325
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,300
There's a lot of things I can do that you don't.

326
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,200
So you get to look pretty at daddy's party,

327
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,000
and I have to look like this?

328
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,600
Hey, I have a great idea.

329
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,800
Okay, see? Your daddy's got a great idea.

330
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,000
How about if neither one of you wears makeup to the dinner?

331
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,800
Okay.

332
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,000
No, no, no. Your daddy's just being silly.

333
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,100
Can I talk to you for a second, silly daddy?

334
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,600
Are you a lunatic?

335
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,400
I am not walking into a ballroom full of people without my face on.

336
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,300
Come on. This is to teach her that beauty's only skin deep.

337
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,500
Yeah, well, once you see this skin without foundation,

338
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,500
you may want to rethink that.

339
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,600
Gaby, your daughter is in pain.

340
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,300
And don't you love her enough to
put your vanity aside for one night?

341
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,400
I was in labor for 20 hours. She still owes me for that!

342
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,400
Fine.

343
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,800
I will make the ultimate sacrifice,

344
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,500
and I will be ugly for my daughter.

345
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
But if she ever needs a kidney...

346
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,500
Wow.

347
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,700
Wow. You're really going all out on this sleepover.

348
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,200
Although I'm not sure that tons of sugar
and whistles are a good combination.

349
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,100
Oh, good point.

350
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,500
I'll make us some goody bags filled with earplugs and vodka.

351
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,100
It's great. I'm sure M.J. will appreciate it.

352
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,700
I'm sure he will.

353
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,400
He's a great kid...

354
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,200
and funny.

355
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,900
That was hilarious the other day,

356
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,900
when he asked us when we're getting married.

357
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,800
I'm glad I was tap-dancing my ass off.

358
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,900
No, you were great.

359
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,600
Although...

360
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,100
someday you'll probably have to answer the question.

361
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,600
I'm sure he's forgotten by now.

362
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,200
You know kids.

363
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,800
Kids are like that.

364
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,400
Grown-ups on the other hand...

365
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,900
not so much.

366
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,100
We're not talking about M.J. anymore, are we?

367
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,000
Oh, you want to go run and get your tap shoes?

368
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,800
No. No. I'll be completely honest here.

369
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,900
Moving in with you is ine of the best decisions I ever made.

370
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,100
You make me really, really happy.

371
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,100
But?

372
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,400
I've been married before,

373
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,000
and I just don't see myself getting married again.

374
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,300
Okay.

375
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,200
Probably not what you wanted to hear.

376
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,700
I wanted the truth.

377
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,200
It's not your fault the truth sucks.

378
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,000
So could you get the streamers out of the car?

379
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,200
Sure.

380
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,100
Oh, by the way,

381
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,600
for what it's worth,

382
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,100
I do love you.

383
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,100
I've only been working there two months, but I love it.

384
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,800
And the kids are so cute.

385
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,800
And I get to see M.J. during the day, which is nice.

386
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,100
Uh, you know, uh,

387
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:24,600
for a guy that just had to see me so bad, you...

388
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,600
you seem awfully far away.

389
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,900
I'm sorry.

390
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,300
I'm just a little nervous.

391
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,400
I have something...

392
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,500
to ask you, and I don't know how you're gonna react.

393
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,900
What is it?

394
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,100
Oh.

395
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,900
This is gonna come out of nowhere, but...

396
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,100
I want you to marry me.

397
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,800
A... and here's how I came to this. The other day...

398
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,100
What are you doing?

399
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,800
I have to go upstairs.

400
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,200
Now?

401
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,800
Susan, are you okay?
I'm fine.

402
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,100
I just didn't want you to see me crying.

403
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,900
Honey, you didn't let me finish.

404
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,400
Oh, I'm sorry.

405
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,000
Just, um,

406
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,700
all these months,

407
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,500
I've been telling myself that I didn't really care about you,

408
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
which was easy to do because you left so suddenly.

409
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,100
But I am so lonely.

410
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,600
And as much as I tell myself

411
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:47,600
that I like being the strong, single woman on her own,

412
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,200
the truth is,

413
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,400
I think about you all the time.

414
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,300
And I wanted to call you,

415
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,100
but I thought You'd gotten over me.

416
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,200
And to hear that you still love me...

417
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
that is just something

418
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,700
that I really needed to hear right now.

419
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,900
And I want you to know... 

420
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,400
Oh, God. I want you to know I love you, too.

421
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,000
Jackson...

422
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,200
I love you.

423
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,500
Jackson?

424
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,400
Oh, God.

425
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,400
I really wish you'd let me finish.

426
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,800
Finish what?

427
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,400
Susan, I need you to marry me so that immi-
gration doesn't deport me back to Canada.

428
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,000
The one thing I didn't tell you is that

429
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,100
I'm here on a student visa that expired six years ago,

430
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,400
and I got a call from the authorities,

431
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,000
so unless I can find somebody that will marry me,

432
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I'm gonna be in really big trouble.

433
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,000
Susan?

434
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,100
Susan, did you hear me?

435
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,600
I heard.

436
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,500
So...

437
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,200
what do you say?

438
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,900
Okay. Okay, it was a bad idea.

439
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,000
Get out or I will kick your ass back to the Canadian border!

440
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,400
Ow!

441
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,700
Took a shower, brushed my teeth.

442
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,900
We are good to go.

443
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,600
Lynette.

444
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,000
What are you doing?

445
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,800
You know, the pact.

446
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,000
Oh.

447
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,000
Didn't we already do it tonight?

448
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
No.

449
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,500
Oh, they're all starting to blur.

450
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,600
Look, I worked till 3:00 a.m last night.

451
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,800
I'm exhausted. How about we take a rain check?

452
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,000
A rain check?
Mm.

453
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,900
This isn't baseball.

454
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,900
Every night for 30 days... that's the law.

455
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,800
Tom, I have a 7:00 a.m meeting.

456
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,500
How about I take a long lunch,

457
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,600
and you do me twice at work tomorrow?

458
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,600
Come on.

459
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,100
This is important.

460
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,700
Okay.

461
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,500
Okay.

462
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,600
We'll have sex.

463
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,200
But can you make it quick?

464
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,000
Lynette, please.

465
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,100
You can't rush an artist.

466
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,700
Morning. Oh, sorry. I don't have time for breakfast.

467
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,700
Good.

468
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,700
I didn't make you any.

469
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:01,300
Oh, okay. Uh, coffee will be fine.

470
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,100
Beans are right there. Grab a handful and grind.

471
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,700
Is there a problem?

472
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,800
You don't remember?

473
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,100
Last night, we were having sex?

474
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,500
You fell asleep?

475
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,400
After?

476
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,700
During.

477
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,100
Oh.

478
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,200
Was it good?

479
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,000
I didn't finish.

480
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,600
God, you ruined our streak, Lynette.

481
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,500
I'm sorry. I was exhausted.

482
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,800
It's not like I was asking you to scrub a floor.

483
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,700
All you had to do was lie there, like you usually do.

484
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,800
Oh, okay. I'm gonna let that one go, 'cause you're upset.

485
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,300
Well, it's true. With you being so tired from work lately,

486
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,100
I'm the one doing all the heavy lifting.

487
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,000
Tom, you're being completely irrational.

488
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
We've had sex 23 days straight.

489
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,200
I've seen re ceiling than Michelangelo.

490
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,900
We made a commitment, Lynette.

491
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,800
The book says...
Oh, would you stop with the book?

492
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,400
You bought it at a car wash along
with a pack of gum and an air freshener.

493
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,000
You're right. It's stupid. All my ideas are stupid

494
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,200
I should just stick to doing chores.

495
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,900
Don't just walk away.

496
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,800
You better get to work, Lynette. You're gonna be late.

497
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,000
Hey. Haven't seen you boys in a while.

498
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,400
There's been a break in the club fire case, Mr. Williams.

499
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,900
You got a minute?

500
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,300
Do you know this guy?

501
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,400
No. Who is he?

502
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,900
Dr. Samuel Heller, psychiatrist from Boston.

503
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,900
He's the guy who burned up in the fire.

504
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,900
What's a shrink from Boston doing in Fairview?

505
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,000
No idea, but we'd like to find out

506
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,700
if anyone knows him or what he was doing there.

507
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,300
Did you see him backstage?

508
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,500
No, I didn't see anybody.

509
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,100
Except porter Scavo.

510
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,500
Yeah, but I told you. That was a mistake.

511
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:00,400
Do you know a guy named Jackson
Braddock? He was backstage.

512
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,300
Was he?

513
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:05,200
Yeah, he got locked in the employee
men's room right before the fire started.

514
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,000
Well, I don't know anything about that

515
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,400
have you talked to him?

516
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,700
We've been trying, but he left town,

517
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,500
and we've been unable to find him.

518
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,800
That's a shame.

519
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,800
We'll figure it out. 
Thanks for your time.

520
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,000
You bet.

521
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,400
Hey, Susan. It's Dave.

522
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,600
You know, I was thinking I'd pick up you and M.J.

523
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,100
around 6:00 AM Saturday for the trip.

524
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:39,400
Yeah. I figured the earlier we get going, the better.

525
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,800
Okay.

526
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,600
Well, hello there, M.J.

527
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,500
I was baking this morning, and like an idiot,

528
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,600
I made too many macaroons.

529
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,200
Would you be willing to take one?

530
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,400
I would hate to see them go to waste.

531
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,000
Macaroons are my favorite.

532
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,600
Oh, really? What a delightful coincidence.

533
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,100
You know, I could bake these for you every week,

534
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:06,000
and all I'd need in return is just the tiniest of favors.

535
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,500
What kind of favor?

536
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,100
Invite Evan Mayer to your sleepover.

537
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,700
I don't like Evan. He's mean.

538
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,800
Oh, no.

539
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:18,600
Deep down, he's just a fragile little boy who wants to be liked.

540
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:22,000
He hit me with a dead squirrel.

541
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:25,600
Now, M.J., we can find faults with a our friends if we nitpick.

542
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,600
What do you say? Will you invite him?

543
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,800
Would you like some ice cream with your
macaroons? Because I could make that happen.

544
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,100
Bree?

545
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,200
I'm late for my golf game.

546
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,600
I don't have time to go to the ATM,

547
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,900
so I took the cash out of your wallet.

548
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,600
Bye.

549
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:57,900
M.J.,

550
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:06,200
there's someone in my life Who hits me
with a dead squirrel every single day.

551
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,600
And you are the only one who can help me.

552
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:13,800
Please, please invite Evan to your party.

553
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,000
Okay.

554
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,800
Thank you.

555
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,900
Oh, thank you, sweetheart.

556
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,400
Boy, the stuff I do for macaroons.

557
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,500
Go away! I... I don't want to talk to you.

558
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,000
Come on. Let me in.

559
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,600
Thanks, but I've reached my maximum
allowance for humiliation this week.

560
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,100
Listen, I'm sorry you thought it was a real proposal.

561
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,900
In retrospect I should have led with deportation

562
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,600
maximum allowance exceeded.

563
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,500
What do you want?

564
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,200
I wanted to apologize.

565
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,100
You have every right to be mad at me.

566
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,700
Oh, I'm not mad at you.

567
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,500
You know, I'm just disappointed in myself.

568
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,300
I was a little lonely and a little afraid and...

569
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,600
I just did what I always do... 

570
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,600
let some silly romantic fantasy take over.

571
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,500
I didn't know you still felt that way about me.

572
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,400
I don't.

573
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,900
This isn't about you.

574
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,600
Not really.

575
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,300
And besides, you moved on.

576
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,200
Well, I had to.

577
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,400
You pushed me away.

578
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,600
I had to... heal my heart and get over it.

579
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:03,600
This... I mean, this is really the only thing
you can do To stay here and do your work?

580
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,400
Yeah.

581
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,300
I'll help you.

582
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,100
Really?

583
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,800
Yeah.

584
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,600
I'll do it. But that's it.

585
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,400
No love, no sex, just...

586
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,500
marriage.

587
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,300
No sex?

588
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,500
You want people to think this is a real marriage, don't you?

589
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,600
Gaby, come on.

590
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:53,500
For God sakes, will you take those off? It's 8:00 at night.

591
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,000
Oh, fine.

592
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,600
As long as you don't mind people thinking

593
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,700
you're out on the town with your anemic lesbian sister.

594
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:03,000
There's our man of honor.

595
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,000
Gaby, this is Stephanie. She put this whole banquet together.

596
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,500
Hi. Nice to meet you.

597
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,800
You're probably wondering why I look like this.

598
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,100
Excuse me?

599
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,300
I'm not ill. I'm just not wearing any makeup

600
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:16,000
So I can teach my daughter that beauty's what's on the inside.

601
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,600
I don't actually look this hideous.

602
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,600
Okay.

603
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,400
Will you please stop explaining yourself?

604
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,300
I mean, it was bad enough when you did it with the valet.

605
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:33,300
I can't help it. I don't want people thinking I condone this face.

606
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,000
I'm gonna go find our table.

607
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,400
Champagne?
Oh, thank you.

608
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,800
I'm not ill. I'm just not wearing any makeup.

609
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,000
Gaby!

610
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,000
Gotta go.

611
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,400
Come on, guys. No running in the house.

612
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:59,000
These candy apples are great. Can
me and Evan have another one?

613
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,600
Well, I better ask Katherine.

614
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,600
Where is Katherine?

615
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:09,000
Hey. You're missing all the fun.

616
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,900
I just got a candied apple out of a kid's hair.

617
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,200
Sounds like you got everything under control.

618
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,500
No, come on down.

619
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,700
It's not as much fun without you.

620
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,100
Okay.

621
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,400
You were honest with me, so I'm gonna be honest with you.

622
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,500
I got scared.

623
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,600
Of what?

624
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,800
I was hosting a party with this amazing man

625
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,100
And his adorable son,

626
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:44,700
and we were like the perfect family, and then I realized...

627
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,200
we're not a family.

628
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,200
It could all go away in an instant.

629
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,000
Katherine, I'm not leaving.

630
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,700
But you're not committing either.

631
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,400
Why not, Mike?

632
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:04,600
Is it Susan? You still in love with her?

633
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,400
No.

634
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,600
No, I've told you that.

635
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,800
Then it must be me.

636
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:16,200
Katherine, I love having you in my life.

637
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,300
I'm just not ready.

638
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,000
I don't know what else to say.

639
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,800
I'm not trying to get you to say anything.

640
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:29,500
I just have to take care of myself.

641
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,600
I should probably go make sure the first floor is still there.

642
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,300
Excuse me. The mayor's about to leave,

643
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:51,000
And the newspaper wants a photo with him and your family.

644
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:54,500
Oh, that's so sweet. Tell him no way in hell.

645
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,800
Tell him we'll be right there.

646
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,800
The newspaper? Forget it.

647
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,900
Gaby, I do business with the city. I can't just blow off the mayor.

648
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,200
Seriously, we cannot allow this to be photographed

649
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,800
next time there's an epidemic, people
are gonna think I'm patient zero.

650
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,900
You're not getting out of this.

651
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,800
Fine.

652
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,800
But just so we're clear, you're also latino jerk of the year.

653
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,800
Come on. Let's go.

654
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,500
Oh, can I at least use the bathroom first?

655
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,700
Ladies! Attention, please.

656
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:33,000
I am in a jam, and I need lipstick and eyeliner.

657
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,600
Come on. Chop chop.

658
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,400
You can use my makeup.

659
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:43,300
Oh, that doesn't really go with my skin tone.

660
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,600
What do you mean? We have the same coloring.

661
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,700
Yeah, it doesn't really go with your skin tone either,

662
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,400
but I can only deal with one disaster at a time.

663
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,800
Ooh. Asian girl. Close enough.

664
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,400
Um, I don't think so.

665
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:59,300
Ugh. Was it the "chop chop" thing? Fine. I'm sorry.

666
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,700
Now can I borrow some blush?

667
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,100
I don't share cosmetics. I'm sort of a germ freak.

668
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,100
Oh, don't worry. I'm as healthy as a horse.

669
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,500
Really? You look sick.

670
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,900
That's 'cause I don't have any makeup!

671
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,900
I said no. Now leave me alone.

672
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:15,700
Okay, okay, look. I'm sorry. You're right.

673
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,800
I never should have asked.

674
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,000
Oh. Oh! Hey!

675
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,600
Come out now, or I'll call security!

676
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,000
You know, for a woman who has a purse fu of dinner rolls,

677
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,600
you sure have a lot of attitude.

678
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,900
Oh, good. We're all here.

679
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:39,100
By the way, Mrs. Solis, you look absolutely stunning.

680
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,400
Thank you.

681
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,000
Yeah, mom. You look great.

682
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,600
Okay, big smiles, everyone.

683
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:59,000
See this? My third espresso.

684
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,800
I'm wired. No way I'm falling asleep tonight.

685
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,600
Hey.

686
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,600
How about we throw a pizza on the front lawn,

687
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,400
And when the kids run out to get it,

688
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:19,300
we lock the door and do it in every room in the house?

689
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,600
Tom, I'm sorry.

690
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,500
I don't know what else to say.

691
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:33,100
If you wanna stay mad, I guess you're gonna stay mad.

692
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:39,400
I am not mad, Lynette.
Then what's wrong?

693
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,000
You're gonna think it's stupid.

694
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,400
Tell me.

695
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:49,400
You want to know why sex has become so important to me lately?

696
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:53,400
Because you are the only thing in my life

697
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,600
that I'm passionate about.

698
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,500
That is so sweet.

699
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,100
No. No, it's not good, Lynette... 

700
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:03,200
not for me, not for you. I...

701
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:07,300
I need something else to be excited about.

702
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,500
I thought you wanted to do this,
to take a break and stay home.

703
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:15,000
I did. You know, I figured, the kids are grown...

704
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,500
I can take care of the house and the
errands, and it'll be easy, and it is.

705
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:24,300
It's too damn easy. I am finished with my work by noon,

706
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:27,500
and then I just sit around,

707
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,000
waiting for you to come home.

708
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,200
So...

709
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,900
what do you want to do? Hmm?

710
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:36,300
What are you passionate about?

711
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,000
I don't know.

712
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,800
I'm a middle-aged guy,

713
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,400
and I don't know what I want to do with my life.

714
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,200
I told you it was stupid.

715
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,400
No

716
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,500
No.

717
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,000
Hey.

718
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,100
I know I disappointed you tonight, and I'm really sorry.

719
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:22,200
It's okay. I know why you did it.

720
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,200
I need makeup, too.

721
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:29,100
Honey, I know you think being pretty seems like

722
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,700
the most important thing in the world right now,

723
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,500
but believe me, it's not.

724
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,700
You were a model.

725
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:40,000
Yes, I was.

726
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,400
And my whole life,

727
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,100
people told me how pretty I was.

728
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,900
So you know what? I never... 

729
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,400
thought I had to work hard in school

730
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,400
or work on friendships

731
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,400
or my personality... none of it.

732
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,000
And then I stopped modeling,

733
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
and I realized I didn't have much on the inside.

734
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,000
And I don't want that for you.

735
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:10,700
I want you to be brave and funny and creative...

736
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,500
to be more than just a shell.

737
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,200
I want you to have the whole rich, gooey center.

738
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,400
Will you promise to do that for yourself?

739
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,000
Okay.

740
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,800
When do I get to wear makeup?

741
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,000
I tell you what.

742
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:44,100
You can wear makeup the day you realize you don't really need it.

743
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,500
Hey.

744
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,000
I bought M.J. a fishing pole.

745
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,700
I figure I'd teach the little guy how to cast Before we hit the water.

746
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:00,500
Oh, my God. We're not gonna be able to make it this weekend.

747
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,500
I'm kind of...

748
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,700
getting married.

749
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,000
What?

750
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,400
To who?

751
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,300
Dave Williams.

752
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,500
I thought I heard you out here.

753
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,000
Jackson.

754
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,800
Just when you thought I was out of the picture, I'm back.

755
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,700
Since you held up your end of the bargain,

756
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,500
I'm going to hold up mine.

757
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,800
I'm gonna make sure that you walk away from this marriage

758
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,800
with your business and your assets intact.

759
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,500
Now to accomplish this,

760
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,200
I may need you to lie, stonewall,

761
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:39,200
even resort to some outright trickery.

762
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,400
My question is...

763
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,400
will you be up for that?

764
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,800
I used to think of myself as a good person.

765
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,900
If I had a choice,

766
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,800
I would always choose the high road.

767
00:40:56,300 --> 00:41:00,300
Lately I've begun to realize that, um...

768
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:04,900
I'm capable of doing whatever needs to be done.

769
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,000
You know what that makes you?

770
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:12,000
The perfect client.

771
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,700
On this street,

772
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:23,200
the bargaining is finished by sundown...

773
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,700
a daughter agrees to go to bed early

774
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:31,700
if her mother lets her dress up in her old gowns...

775
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,500
A woman agrees to let her fiancÃ© spend the night.

776
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:40,000
If he'll agree to sleep on the sofa...

777
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,600
a man allows his lover to get close

778
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:48,200
as long as they don't discuss the future.

779
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:55,700
Yes, everyone knows how to bargain on Wisteria lane...

780
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,400
Hi.

781
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,000
What are you doing up so late?

782
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,500
Well, I have a proposition for you

783
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:07,000
I make you breakfast in the morning

784
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,800
if you make love to me tonight.

785
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,000
why not?

786
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,800
But sometimes...

787
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,600
they get more than they bargained for

788
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,400
