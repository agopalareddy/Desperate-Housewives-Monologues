1
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,930
So I'm driving my car the other night,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,930
and what do you think happens?

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,800
I crashed into a utility pole.

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,930
Then, to add insult to injury...

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,160
I was electrocuted.

6
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,630
What can I say?

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,930
It was one of those days.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,930
All my neighbors heard it happen,

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,160
so they quickly left their microwaved burritos...

10
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:34,700
and their expensive jars of moisturizer...

11
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,460
and their racy pay-per-view movies...

12
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:41,130
And they hurried outside,

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,100
excited to see what all the ruckus was about.

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,460
But then, when they saw it was me,

15
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,430
this weird thing happened.

16
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:55,500
For a moment, no one moved or said anything.

17
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,860
They just stared.

18
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,160
And then...

19
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:00,800
Oh, my god.

20
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,630
All hell broke loose.

21
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,460
Does anybody know C.P.R.?

22
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:05,900
There's been an accident.

23
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,430
Edie!

24
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,260
Can you hear me?

25
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:13,830
Yes, everyone suddenly became very concerned,

26
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,330
which was touching,

27
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,630
but ultimately pointless.

28
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,060
Moments before the ambulance finally arrived,

29
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,600
I heard someone whisper...

30
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,130
Don't worry, Edie.

31
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,100
You're gonna get through this. You're gonna be just fine.

32
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:34,000
Susan Mayer... wrong again.

33
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,430
Two seconds later, it happened.

34
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,260
With all of my neighbors surrounding me,

35
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:43,200
I took my last breath.

36
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,760
The good news?

37
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,960
I died just like I lived...

38
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:52,960
as the complete and utter center of attention.

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,330
Two days after I kicked the proverbial bucket,

40
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,130
My husband asked my neighbors to do me a favor.

41
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,530
You could tell from the looks on their faces

42
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,200
it wasn't something they... wanted to do,

43
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,600
But... They agreed to do it anyway.

44
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,200
So the next day, they piled into a car

45
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,930
with two thermoses filled with coffee,

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,500
a basket filled with baked goods

47
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,100
and an urn that was filled with... me.

48
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,630
I hate that we have to do this.

49
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,430
So you've said.
I mean, it really is the kind of thing a relative should do.

50
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,860
Maybe it is, but we're in the car, on our way there,

51
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:54,100
so stop your bitching.
Well, can you at least put the radio on?

52
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,060
I won't feel like bitching if I can sing along to something.

53
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,030
If you start singing, I'll start bitching,

54
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,400
and you don't want that.
It's a 4-hour drive.

55
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,760
We have to do something to pass the time.

56
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,860
Here's a thought. Why don't we talk about Edie?

57
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,730
And say what?

58
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,730
I don't know, but she is the reason we're on this trip.

59
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,130
Uh, maybe we could share memories or tell stories.

60
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,730
Why don't you start with the time

61
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,360
she tried to steal your comatose boyfriend?

62
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,360
That was fun.
Okay, I was thinking

63
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,830
of stories that put Edie in a positive light.

64
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:27,200
And after that five minute is up, then what do we do?

65
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,300
The woman is dead, people. Let's honor her memory.

66
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,930
Well, I'm all for saying a few nice things...

67
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,300
But you were never really friends.

68
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,460
You and Edie clashed right from the start.

69
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:42,500
Yeah.

70
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,900
That's what everybody thinks.

71
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,360
But the the first time we met,

72
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:52,460
it seemed like we'd end up being the best of friends.

73
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,930
Oh, that's disgusting.

74
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
No, it's okay.

75
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,330
It landed on the detergent box.

76
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,560
Here.

77
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,000
You go buy yourself a fresh doughnut

78
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,360
or booze, crack, whatever eases the pain.

79
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,900
Just move it along.

80
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:19,600
Uh, you think I'm homeless. Oh, no, no, no.

81
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,200
No, I live here.

82
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,160
I... I can prove it.

83
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,760
I know exactly what's in this garbage bag.

84
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:30,600
Um, empty carton of eggs, coffee grinds,

85
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,960
shampoo bottle...

86
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,900
Wart removal cream?

87
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:38,700
You're right. I'm homeless.

88
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,500
Susan Mayer. Oh.

89
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,330
It's all cleared up.

90
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,960
Mm. Edie Britt. I just moved in down the street.

91
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:52,600
Oh, yeah. I saw the moving van. Welcome.

92
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,130
Thanks.

93
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,300
So is it just you, or do you have a family?

94
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,730
I have a son. He lives with his dad.

95
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,800
It's a long story. I'll tell you one day over a margarita.

96
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,760
You wanna invite me in for a margarita?

97
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,700
How about coffee? I just put on a pot.

98
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,030
Great.

99
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,500
You can fill me in on all of the neighborhood gossip,

100
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,460
starting with the red head across the street

101
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:18,130
with the muffin basket. That's a robot, right?

102
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,860
Funny and likes to gossip.

103
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:22,900
We're gonna get along just fine.
Yes, we are.

104
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,330
Wait. Stop.

105
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,430
Could we just rest for a second?

106
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,500
We've only gone four blocks.

107
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,200
Okay, I lied.

108
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,660
I hate running.

109
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,660
Well, why didn't you say something?

110
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:44,130
We've been doing this for a week.
Because we were starting to become friends,

111
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,730
and you like to run, and I like to...

112
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,960
sit and...

113
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,930
One of us had to give.

114
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,730
Hi, Susan!
Oh, hi, Helen, Ed.

115
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,260
I would have introduced you,

116
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,400
but once Helen starts talking, she doesn't shut up.

117
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:01,160
Right. Ed told me that.
Oh, you met Ed?

118
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:04,500
Oh, yeah. I've gotten to know him quite well.

119
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,760
Yeah?

120
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,760
We're kinda...

121
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,200
doing it.

122
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,330
Doing what?

123
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,960
It.

124
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:16,830
Ed is married.

125
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,030
Yeah, I'm a naughty girl.

126
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,530
No, you're being immoral.

127
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,700
You're committing adultery.

128
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,360
Actually, Ed's committing adultery. I'm just getting laid.

129
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,630
You know, forget I ever mentioned it.

130
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,660
I can't forget something like this.

131
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:37,730
Helen is my very good friend.
I thought you just said that she was...

132
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,700
She is annoying, and I hide when she knocks on my door,

133
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,730
but she does not deserve for you to be wrecking her marriage.

134
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,230
Where are you going?

135
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,830
Home.

136
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,500
Oh, so you're not gonna be my friend anymore?

137
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,800
I don't think so.

138
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,300
I thought you didn't like running.

139
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,900
Well, it depends on what I'm running away from!

140
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:05,560
Hi. I'm the whore that lives down the street.

141
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,400
Could I borrow a cup of condoms?

142
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,760
A cup? Are you sure that'll be enough?

143
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,030
Look, I know that you don't like me,

144
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,160
but I am here to do you a favor anyway.

145
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,600
I was out to dinner last night,

146
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,560
and I saw your husband with another woman.
Really?

147
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,760
I feel bad saying it,

148
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:28,100
but if I were in your shoes, I would want to know.

149
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,700
You're welcome.

150
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,500
Oh, I get it.

151
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,500
So you feel I judged you, and for revenge,

152
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,960
you're trying to make me insecure about my marriage.

153
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,930
If I wanted revenge,

154
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,230
I would have joined them and made it a threesome.

155
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,200
You know, Karl would never cheat,

156
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:49,630
and the woman he was with... Brandi, his secretary,

157
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,900
and he took her out for her birthday.

158
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,860
Oh, the old "I'm taking my secretary

159
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,900
out for her birthday" routine.

160
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,260
Hmm. Nice tip of the hat to the classics.

161
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,600
Okay, well, since you're on this moral roll,

162
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,560
why don't we walk over to Helen's?

163
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,530
And I will introduce you. We can have some tea,

164
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,500
and then you two could swap stories

165
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,430
about Ed's favorite positions.

166
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,330
What I do and what Brandi's doing is completely different.

167
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,430
How?

168
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,830
I'm not looking to break up anyone's marriage.

169
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,030
I'm in it for a little fun, some free meals

170
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,000
and to help an unhappy man through his midlife crisis.

171
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:28,660
Wow. You're just a giver.

172
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,260
Fine.

173
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,530
Use all of your energy judging me

174
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,500
and ignore the real problem.

175
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,360
But let me tell you something.

176
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,330
This is my area of expertise,

177
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,330
and I saw the look in that woman's eyes.

178
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,000
She's not in it for the free meals. She's in it for keeps.

179
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,100
You should leave now.

180
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,030
You know, Susan,

181
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,600
I'm trying to help my neighbor out.

182
00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:00,260
I thought it was the moral thing to do.

183
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,000
Three weeks later, I found Brandi's bra

184
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,860
in Karl's glove compartment, and, well, you know the rest.

185
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:12,900
Say what you want about Edie, she really understood men.

186
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,600
I should hope so. After all those years of research...

187
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,900
I can't help thinking about

188
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,160
all the times Edie and I sniped at each other.

189
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,130
We could have been good friends.

190
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,430
Well, if she knew what you're about to do for her,

191
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,560
she'd forgive you for everything.

192
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:40,560
okay, my hour's up. Someone else hold Edie now.

193
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,600
Mm. I'll take her.

194
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,760
Kinda looks like cat litter.

195
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:53,160
Lynette, don't look at Edie.

196
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:56,630
Or what, I'll turn to stone? She's all rough and gritty.

197
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,560
Uh, Gaby, before we learn what Edie tastes like...

198
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,030
I got it.

199
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,660
I think a little more reverence for the dead is order.

200
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,660
Oh, please. We're talking about Edie.

201
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,330
A little more irreverence is what we need.

202
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,030
Give it.

203
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,530
Do you guys remember when you
took turns driving me to chemo?

204
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,600
Well, none of you did it like Edie.

205
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,460
Hey, Lynette.

206
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:29,960
Hey.

207
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,100
How you feelin'?

208
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,730
Eh, same.

209
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,430
Well, here's the DVD you asked for.

210
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,630
Thanks. I'll watch it during chemo if I'm  not too tired.

211
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,400
Here we go.

212
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,700
Oh, hi, Edie.

213
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,660
Hi, ugh. What is that?

214
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:48,000
It's a health shake of fermented brown rice,

215
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,530
and for her entry,

216
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,660
a salad of radish, burdock root and bok choy.

217
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:55,100
Mmm. What's for dessert, waterboarding?

218
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,900
Thanks.

219
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,200
I can't get comfortable.

220
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02,030
Could you fluff my pillows?
Of course.

221
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,700
Well, I've got errands to run,

222
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,200
and I'll be back to drive you to chemo.
Before you go, would you put my socks back on?

223
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,530
My feet are cold again.

224
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,260
Oh, of course.

225
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:18,030
Katherine, you have got stuff to do.

226
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,360
Why don't I take her to chemo?

227
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,030
It's fine.

228
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,530
Okay.

229
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,160
See you tomorrow then.

230
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,600
Bye.

231
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,130
Okay, where's your coat?

232
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,860
Why?
Chemo's not until 5:00.

233
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:39,000
Yeah, I've gotta make a little stop on the way.

234
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:47,900
Edie!
Whoo!

235
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,400
Been here before?

236
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,960
A couple of times. You're gonna love it. Hey!

237
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,930
Love it? I have cancer.

238
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,930
I probably shouldn't even use the ladies' room in this place.

239
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,300
Oh, there isn't a ladies' room, so that's not a problem.

240
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,230
Um, I...

241
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,460
Edie, I have chemo in half an hour.

242
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:08,360
Fine. Then we better start drinking.
I'm  not supposed to drink.

243
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:11,330
And they're not supposed to do tattoos in the kitchen,

244
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,300
but I have a bald eagle on my ass that says otherwise.

245
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,300
Two tequila shooters!

246
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,060
Hey, Edie!
Reggie! Oh, I thought you were in Florida.

247
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:23,060
Nah. That was just a body they identified as me.

248
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:26,260
Oh. Reggie, this is my friend Lynette.

249
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,660
I'm trying to cheer her up a little.

250
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:30,900
Right on. You wanna shoot some stick?

251
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,000
Uh...

252
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,500
No, thanks.

253
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,300
Oh, come on. You can totally take him.

254
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,960
No, I can't. Uh, see? Cancer.

255
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:42,600
Oh. No sweat.

256
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,700
I'll play you one-handed.

257
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,400
Can you excuse us for one second?

258
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,200
I need to go to chemo. I have...
Cancer. Yeah, I heard.

259
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,160
And what do you want from me?

260
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:07,930
I want you to fluff your own pillows.

261
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,300
You need to start fighting this thing.

262
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,200
I'm  doing the best I can.

263
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,700
Oh, not even close.

264
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,600
Hell, Lynette, you... you are the strongest person I know.

265
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:21,360
You're even stronger than me, and that's saying something.

266
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,460
Now...

267
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:29,960
I may be a little out of line bringing you here,

268
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:32,730
but you need to remember who you are.

269
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,430
Screw cancer.

270
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,330
You are Lynette Scavo.

271
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,760
Two tequilas.

272
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:03,560
Now... where's that one-armed friend of yours?

273
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:07,160
I'm... wanna shoot some stick.

274
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,400
Wow. It sounds like she gave you just what you needed.

275
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,830
Good for Edie.
She never let me forget it either.

276
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,530
She always insisted

277
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,730
it was the tequila shooters that killed the cancer.

278
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,960
Oh, what the hell is that?

279
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:29,300
Oh, not now. We have a flat.

280
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,660
Maybe it's a sign we're not supposed to do this today.

281
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:34,730
Nice try.

282
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,900
We don't have time for this.

283
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,330
Anybody know how to change a tire?

284
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,060
You want to hand me that cross wrench?
Do you wanna tell me what that is?

285
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,560
It's the t-shaped, idiot,

286
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:01,000
I'm gonna whack you with it if you don't hand it over.

287
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,000
You know, Edie used to live around here

288
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:06,130
when she moved away from Wisteria Lane.

289
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,200
You mean when you gals gave her the boot.
Less yakkin', more jackin'.

290
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:12,160
Bree, how did you know where she lived?

291
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:15,500
Um, I ran into her once, unexpectedly...

292
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:19,130
In a place I never thought I'd be.

293
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,060
Bree Hodge.

294
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,730
Follow me. I'll get you situated,

295
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,830
and I'll bring your husband in.

296
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,660
Is that the visitors' room?

297
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,460
Yeah. Why?

298
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:44,830
You don't happen to have a private room, do you?

299
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,500
You mean, like an upgrade,

300
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,930
something with a couch and softer lighting?

301
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,360
That would be lovely.

302
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:58,030
Oh. You were being sarcastic.

303
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,660
Yes, ma'am. Are you ready to...

304
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:03,560
Oh, not, uh, just yet.

305
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:07,230
It's not a bad idea, having an upgrade available.

306
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,230
I bet that's a perk people would be willing to pay for.

307
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,330
Ma'am, it's a prison.

308
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,760
The only perk we offer is a cavity search.

309
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:18,060
Um...

310
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:20,360
To be honest, I... I'm  not feeling up to this.

311
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:23,630
I'm gonna have to come back another day.

312
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,530
Fine. He's got another visitor scheduled anyway,

313
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,060
so I don't even have to tell him you were here.
Another visitor? Who?

314
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:31,500
Some lady. She visits him every week.

315
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,400
Every week? What's her name?

316
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,860
I can't give you that.

317
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:39,760
If she's visiting my husband, I think I have a right to know.

318
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:43,160
Ma'am, I'm sorry, but I cannot give you her name.

319
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,360
Really?

320
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:49,730
Because I would consider that a perk worth paying for.

321
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:59,060
Well, well.

322
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:01,030
What are you doing here?

323
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,300
I wanted to see you.

324
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,900
And you didn't bring muffins?

325
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,060
It isn't that kind of visit.

326
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:17,030
No muffins, no small talk.

327
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,060
Should I be scared or grateful?

328
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:22,860
I stopped by the prison today.

329
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:25,600
The guard tells me you've been visiting Orson...

330
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,360
sometimes twice a week, she said.

331
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:31,600
Oh. Who knew lady prison guards could be so chatty?

332
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,760
What are you up to, Edie?

333
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,930
I'm  not up to anything, you redheaded ice cube.

334
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,400
He's 15 minutes away.

335
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:41,600
And quite frankly, I feel sorry for him.

336
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,930
After all, I know what it's like to be exiled from suburbia.

337
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,930
So you're not...

338
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,960
trying to start up something?

339
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:54,130
He's in jail.

340
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,730
My boobs are impressive, but they can't bend iron bars.

341
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,200
Well...

342
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:03,730
Thank you for... checking in on him

343
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,930
and for answering my question.

344
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:13,160
I have a question.

345
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:16,000
Why aren't you visiting him?

346
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,260
Oh, well, my schedule is just unreal,

347
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,330
what with the catering company and looking after Benjamin.

348
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,960
Yeah, well, we're all busy.

349
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,960
Come on.

350
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:28,030
Why haven't you been to see him?

351
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,300
That jail is...

352
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,930
It's disgusting.

353
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,230
All those men in cages, like animals.

354
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,500
Even to step foot in that place is humiliating.

355
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:51,530
That man went to jail for you.

356
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,960
Do you have any idea how much he must love you?

357
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:58,830
I do.

358
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:03,000
Then why can't you suck it up once a month and go and say hi?

359
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:07,500
Try to help him get through this living nightmare.

360
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,530
Why can't you do that?

361
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,560
Now as I think about it,

362
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,130
don't visit him.

363
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,230
He can do so much better than you.

364
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:56,000
So... how are you doing?

365
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,600
How do you think?

366
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:05,160
You're right. I shouldn't have asked.

367
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:08,000
I know it's horrible here.

368
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:10,500
How would you know?

369
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,060
You've never been.

370
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,730
You have every right to hate me.

371
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:21,460
There's no need to be melodramatic.

372
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:23,760
I meant for asking you to come here,

373
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,930
for insisting you turn yourself in.

374
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:31,530
Oh. Now that I see this place, I don't know what I was thinking.

375
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,530
You were thinking

376
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,000
I needed to take responsibility for what I did,

377
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,460
and you were right.

378
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:41,330
But still, asking you to make this sacrifice and not...

379
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,000
Ever...

380
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,700
coming to see you...

381
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,800
How can you ever forgive me?

382
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,530
Just be there when I get out.

383
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:17,730
I never told you about that because... I was embarrassed.

384
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,700
Yeah, Edie Britt shamed you into being a better human being.

385
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,900
That is embarrassing.

386
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,260
All right, ladies, we're ready to ride.

387
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:28,260
Good. We got some ground to make up.

388
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:31,200
I was hoping we would be able to get there before dark.

389
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:34,230
How do you think he'll react when we tell him?
How do you think?

390
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:46,400
I never thought Edie would be cremated, I figured
she wanna be pumped chemicals and preserved

391
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:49,630
Isn't that what she did for the last 15 years?

392
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,960
My theory... Edie knew if she was buried,

393
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:54,930
her true date of birth would be carved into a tombstone

394
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,930
for all the world to see.
You really think she spent a lot of time

395
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,500
thinking about her death?

396
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:03,060
Yeah, I do.

397
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:06,960
I spent a night with her

398
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:11,460
right after Carlos and I got divorced. Is
this too red? I think I need something pinker.

399
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,960
It's fine. Hurry up.

400
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:17,400
I want to get to the club while this bikini wax is still fresh.

401
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,400
This is gonna be fun.

402
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:22,360
I can't believe we've never gone out on the town together.

403
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:24,330
Well, we've never been single together before.

404
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,300
Oh, I feel so sorry for all those other girls in the bar.

405
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,030
Oh, so do I.

406
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:34,200
To be fair, we should probably walk in backwards.

407
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:37,630
Oh, no, that won't work.

408
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,300
We're an unstoppable team.

409
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,330
Mm, the hottest chicks on Wisteria Lane.

410
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,330
Oh, be nice.

411
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,830
There are lots of attractive women on the street.

412
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,100
Like who?

413
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,800
How about Bree?

414
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:52,030
Uh, with that hair color,

415
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,030
you could stick a red nose on her,

416
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,000
and she could join the circus.

417
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,530
Lynette's beautiful.

418
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,200
Mm, for a baby factory.

419
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:02,130
And Susan?
We're the hottest, okay?

420
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,530
Wow.

421
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,360
Too much?

422
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:12,030
No, it's great.

423
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,060
All right. Come on. Let's go.

424
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,360
Wow! You were right about this place.

425
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:32,260
Told ya. A lot of hotties, very few "notties".

426
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:33,860
Ooh.

427
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:35,330
Ladies, this is

428
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,360
from the gentleman at the end of the bar.

429
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:40,430
Oh, and I just sat down.

430
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,800
Well, that's a personal best.

431
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,900
Actually, the drink's for her.

432
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,930
Oh.

433
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,300
Oh! It's pretty dark in here.

434
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,260
He probably didn't get a good look at me.

435
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:56,460
Oh, Edie, don't take it personally.

436
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:57,960
We're just different types.

437
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:01,000
You're right. Some like tall, blonde and sexy,

438
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,230
and some men like...

439
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,060
that.

440
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:07,160
Now, now, Edie. Don't be snarky.

441
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:09,760
We're both hot, remember?

442
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:12,660
Although, apparently, I'm  just a little bit hotter.

443
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:15,300
Well, one guy might think so.

444
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,260
One guy who's evidently intimidated

445
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:20,060
by full-sized womanly breasts.

446
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:23,460
Hmm. Yes, I guess I am a little on the small side.

447
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:26,530
That's the drawback to having ones that are real.

448
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,660
What are you talking about? These are real.

449
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:32,130
Oh, Edie, come on. When you jump up and down,

450
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,100
the room moves more than your boobs.

451
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,430
Well, someone obviously has a chip on her shoulder.

452
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:41,400
I'd reach down and knock it off,

453
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:44,000
but I can't go down that low.

454
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:47,560
Okay, you really think you're hotter than me?

455
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:52,100
Let's just say that I have more of what men want.

456
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,830
Yeah? Well, I have a Vodka Soda here that says otherwise.

457
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,800
Ooh! So he bought you one drink...

458
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,060
a well drink, I might add.

459
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:04,100
Well, it's one more than you got.

460
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,530
Are you saying that I can't get a man to buy me a Cocktail?

461
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:14,660
Sure, you can, just not as many as me.

462
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:16,800
One hour.

463
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:20,500
Whoever gets the most swizzle sticks by the end wins.

464
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,530
See ya in an hour, loser.

465
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:19,230
Count them and weep, Solis.

466
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:23,060
Well, I guess I could do that.

467
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:28,300
Or I could do this.

468
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,600
Ah.

469
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,560
I should make some kind of speech.

470
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,860
But I think it's enough. We both know I crushed you, right?

471
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:41,730
Now if you'll excuse me,

472
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:46,060
swizzle stick number 17 has a yacht and giant feet.

473
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,000
Whoo-hoo!

474
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,160
What the hell were you thinking,

475
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:07,330
abandoning me at a singles bar?

476
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,200
I'm sorry.

477
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:14,730
I just needed to be by myself for while.

478
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,330
Why?

479
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,300
Don't tell me you're depressed

480
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,260
because you lost some stupid game.

481
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:21,760
I'm not depressed.

482
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:24,500
I'm surprised.

483
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,030
It's going by so quickly.

484
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,560
What is?

485
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,660
My youth.

486
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:34,400
The harder I try to hold on to it,

487
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,360
the more it just...

488
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:38,860
slips through my fingers.

489
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:43,130
And all the makeup and dim lighting in the world

490
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,100
can't seem to stop it.

491
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,430
Oh, please. You're gorgeous.

492
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,700
And you are going to stay that way forever.

493
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,130
Hmm.

494
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,130
That's the tricky part.

495
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,430
I'm not gonna be old.

496
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,760
What?

497
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:02,530
Ever since I was a child,

498
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,330
I've known that I was never gonna see 50.

499
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,960
Oh, that's ridiculous.

500
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:09,100
No, it's true.

501
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,100
As far back as I can remember,

502
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:14,000
a voice in my head said, "live it up today,

503
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,930
beause you're not gonna have a lot of tomorrows".

504
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,430
You do realize

505
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:22,060
there's medication designed to get rid of those voices?

506
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:25,660
It's not a bad thing, Gaby.

507
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:29,060
It's actually a gift.

508
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:31,160
I...

509
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,630
appreciate my life

510
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:37,160
in a way that most people don't.

511
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:41,700
I just didn't expect it to go by this fast.

512
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,100
That's all.

513
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:47,860
Well, you know what?

514
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:52,160
I have a voice inside my head that says you're wrong.

515
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,430
It tells me that 50 years from now,

516
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,030
you and I will still be wearing dresses too tight

517
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,830
and walking in heels too high

518
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,730
and going to bars

519
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,500
where we'll meet old geezers who'll buy us drinks

520
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:09,730
with the last of their social security checks.

521
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,600
If you say so.

522
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:16,360
Now come on. Let's go to my house.

523
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:20,630
Let's pop open a bottle of wine and toast to our future.

524
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:24,730
Why not?

525
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:32,460
Isn't that weird?

526
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:35,160
She knew she was gonna die young.

527
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:41,960
What do you mean, you two were the hottest chicks on the lane?

528
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,930
She called me a baby factory?

529
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,600
Yeah, Gaby, in hindsight,

530
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:50,400
maybe you shouldn't have told that part of the story.
Oh, pfft.

531
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,460
I think we're here.

532
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:09,300
So are we ready for this?

533
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,700
I don't know.

534
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,160
Can you ever be ready to tell a boy that his mother is dead?

535
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,160
Hey, Travers.

536
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:32,160
Remember us?

537
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,900
Sure.

538
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,160
Wow. You brought the whole neighborhood with you.

539
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,660
Did my mom come with you?

540
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,160
We brought you some muffins.

541
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:50,200
You can share them with your roommates

542
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,260
or maybe a favorite teacher.

543
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,860
What's going on?

544
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:59,530
Is my mom in trouble or something?

545
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,360
Come here.

546
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:12,430
I'm afraid we have some bad news.

547
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,860
Your mom was in a very serious accident,

548
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:20,000
and I am so sorry...

549
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,960
but she passed away.

550
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:27,230
She died?

551
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,130
When?

552
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,860
A couple of days ago.

553
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:39,430
We've been trying to get in touch with your dad,

554
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,960
but he's still out of the country.

555
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:43,060
And your mom's new husband's never met you,

556
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:46,060
so he thought it would be best if we told you.

557
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:50,630
Wow.

558
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,230
If you'd like, we could give you a moment.

559
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,630
No.

560
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,630
I'm okay.

561
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,500
Well, I have a class.

562
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,730
Uh, I'm sure the school will understand

563
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,700
if you need to miss a few days.

564
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,530
I don't need to do that.

565
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,660
I mean, I'm sorry she's dead, but we weren't very close.

566
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:19,060
Still, she was your mother.

567
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:21,030
Technically.

568
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,060
But not a very good one.

569
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:25,600
Look, Travers, we're all moms here.

570
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,600
We've all made mistakes with our kids,

571
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,860
and what we count on is when they grow up,

572
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:33,560
they'll forgive us.
My mom didn't even try to raise me.

573
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:37,330
I mean, she just handed me to my father and walked away.

574
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,060
How do you expect me to forgive that?

575
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:41,760
Look, I'm sorry.

576
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:45,660
I don't mean to be rude, but I'm gonna be late.

577
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,360
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey. Wait a second.

578
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:50,560
Travers, you need to know something about your mom,

579
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:53,730
and I'm gonna tell you. Now sit down.

580
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,230
And I'd only known your mom about a year

581
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:59,230
when she came over to my house this one day.

582
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:04,630
Hey, Karen! Your porch light's on.

583
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:10,730
Whoa. Sitting in your bathrobe drinking,

584
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:11,800
and you didn't call me?

585
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,400
I kinda wanted to be alone.

586
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,260
Why?

587
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:23,600
It's the anniversary of my son's death.

588
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,760
Ohh.

589
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,530
I'm sorry.

590
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:32,300
Every year I think it'll get easier,

591
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,160
and it never does.

592
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:39,660
Nothing worse than losing a child.

593
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:44,600
In a way, you're kinda lucky you don't have any.

594
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:47,060
Actually, I do.

595
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:48,960
What?

596
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:51,200
Mm, I have a son.

597
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,860
You lived here a year. How do I not know this?

598
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:57,900
Because he lives with his father.

599
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:02,000
When I got divorced, I gave him full custody,

600
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,630
so I kinda know how you feel.

601
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,660
I mean, we've both lost kids.

602
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:12,290
No.

603
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:14,860
I lost a kid.

604
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:16,800
You gave yours away.

605
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:20,060
And you have the nerve to tell me you know how I feel?

606
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:22,500
I gave him up because I wanted to protect him.

607
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,330
From who?

608
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,860
From me.

609
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:29,230
You know, I tried to be a good mom. I really did.

610
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,860
But I know myself.

611
00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:33,660
And if he...

612
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:35,700
if he was gonna grow up normal,

613
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,800
he needed to get away from me.

614
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,400
What a cop-out.

615
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,630
I think you're just being selfish.

616
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,600
You know, trust me, Karen,

617
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,600
There is nothing that you could say

618
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,760
to make me think less about myself than I already do.

619
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:51,630
But if it gives him a chance, it's worth it.

620
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:54,900
Aren't you afraid he's gonna hate you?

621
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:01,000
I love him enough to let him hate me.

622
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:16,160
Well, I hope you're not making a big mistake.

623
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,500
Well...

624
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,260
Me too.

625
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:36,960
So I'm not defending everything she did, Travers,

626
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:40,360
but you have to know, she loved you,

627
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:43,600
more than you can imagine.

628
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,300
I really need to get to class.

629
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:00,830
Bup, bup, bup. I believe I called shotgun.

630
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,800
God, she is so good at that.

631
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,760
She should be. She's been doing it

632
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:08,230
since she rode shotgun on an actual stagecoach.
Hey. Hey.

633
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:14,460
I realized... I never thanked you

634
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,800
for coming all the way out here just to tell me.

635
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:20,330
That was really cool of you.

636
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:22,460
We felt we owed it to your mom.

637
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:25,030
Oh, my god. I can't believe we forgot.

638
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,860
What?

639
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,130
We, uh...

640
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,460
also came to give you your mom's ashes.

641
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,260
We thought you might wanna scatter them somewhere.

642
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,530
Unless that's a little...

643
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,260
weird for you.

644
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,230
Why don't you guys take 'em?

645
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:00,930
Are you sure?

646
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,660
Yeah.

647
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:06,500
You were her best friends.

648
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,300
I'm sure you could think of the perfect place to put her.

649
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,500
Okay, we're here.

650
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,630
Guys... Wake up.

651
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,700
Guys?

652
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,060
We're home. Get out.

653
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:37,730
Lord, Lynette. You nearly gave me a heart attack.

654
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,660
Yeah, I'd like to see Edie again, but not tonight.

655
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:42,630
Oh, I think my leg's asleep.

656
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:45,160
Actually, that's my leg. Get your hand off.

657
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,900
Lynette, thank you again for driving.

658
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,000
You bet.
Hold it.

659
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:54,460
We still gotta figure out where we're gonna spread the ashes.

660
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:59,160
Now it's gotta be someplace that was meaningful to Edie.

661
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:03,260
Well, Edie once told me she lost
her virginity in a cow pasture.

662
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:05,230
If we can find that exact field...

663
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,560
We'd find a lot of traumatized cows.

664
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,160
Do we really need to do this tonight? They're ashes.

665
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:14,560
It's not like they're gonna go bad.

666
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,230
Fine. We'll talk tomorrow.

667
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:35,000
Oh, Edie, what are we gonna do with you?

668
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,600
Subtle as always, I see.

669
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,460
This was a wonderful idea, Karen.

670
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:31,660
It wasn't exactly mine. Now be careful. You're spilling Edie.

671
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:34,560
Urn is empty.

672
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:36,030
Let's do it.

673
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,360
Shouldn't we say something first?

674
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:40,260
Like what?

675
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:42,200
I don't know.

676
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:45,060
A few words describing how we felt about her?

677
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:47,660
I don't think Edie would want us to get all sappy.

678
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:50,630
Well, I think if we're quick about it, she'd be fine.

679
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,130
Here's a thought...

680
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:55,360
We all say one word that sums up what we thought of her.

681
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:59,230
And then we dump her?
Then we dump her.

682
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:02,100
Just one word. This is hard.

683
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,200
Mm.

684
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:05,530
Okay, I got one. I'll go first.

685
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:09,260
Edie Britt was sexy.

686
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:13,130
Perceptive.

687
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,900
Strong.

688
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,460
Beautiful.
Mm-hmm.

689
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,060
I need four words.

690
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:23,860
Ay.

691
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:26,830
Okay. I want to do Edie justice, and for that to happen,

692
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:30,960
I need four words, okay?
Edie would so not be surprised you're ruining this moment.

693
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:34,360
Go ahead, Susan. What are your four words for Edie?

694
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:38,160
One of a kind.

695
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,760
Now it's time.

696
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,900
And that is

697
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:53,500
how wisteria lane came to be my final resting place.

698
00:40:56,530 --> 00:41:00,400
My ashes were spread over grass I had once walked on...

699
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:07,200
Beneath trees that had once given me shade...

700
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:14,000
On top of roses I once admired...

701
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:20,900
And beside fences I once gossiped over.

702
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,330
And after my friends had finished saying good-bye,

703
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:29,630
a wind came along and took what was left of me into the air.

704
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:33,960
As I looked down on the world,

705
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:36,760
I began to let go of it.

706
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:39,430
I let go of white picket fences

707
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,030
and cars in driveways,

708
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:45,800
coffee cups and vacuum caners.

709
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:49,630
I let go of all those things which seem so ordinary,

710
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:53,160
but when you put them together, they make up a life...

711
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:58,460
