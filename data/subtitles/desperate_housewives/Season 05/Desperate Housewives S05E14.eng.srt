1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,200
Previously on...

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:04,200
Porter Scavo, you are under arrest.

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,030
What?! Porter had nothing to do with that fire.

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,500
Apparently there is a witness that says otherwise.

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,360
A witness? What are they talking about?

6
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,530
Porter was accused but not convicted.

7
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,530
Katherine's love affair...

8
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,800
- I got the flowers.  - Became serious.

9
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,430
Mommy needs to lose a few pounds.

10
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,060
- You wanna help mommy be beautiful again?  - No.

11
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,930
As did Gaby's resolve.

12
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,760
Here's my cookbook.

13
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,830
And Bree's success came at a price.

14
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,160
You can be a little tough sometimes.

15
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,200
- It's only to be expected.  - I don't think I do that.

16
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:33,660
I know you don't.

17
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:43,500
People don't talk about money

18
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,360
In the suburbs...

19
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,030
Mostly because they don't need to.

20
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,930
The ones who have it

21
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,200
let you know with their brand-new clothes...

22
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:59,360
Their expensive appliances...

23
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,100
Those are good.

24
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,360
And their manicured lawns.

25
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,960
The ones who don'thave it

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,330
let you know with barbecues that need replacing...

27
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,030
Walls that need painting...

28
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,530
And classic cars...

29
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,130
that need to be sold.

30
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,260
- Hey you go, Walter. She's all yours.  - This is so awesome!

31
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,160
Where's Tom? I wanna thank him

32
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,160
- For making this the greatest day of my life.  - He's inside,

33
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,300
But between sobs, he wished you happy driving.

34
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,130
Where is that man going with Tom's car?

35
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,100
Oh, that man is Walter Brotski, and he just bought it.

36
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:42,760
Tom loves that car. Why would you sell it?

37
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,200
Sadly, we can no longer afford Tom's midlife crisis.

38
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,100
Okay, here's the deal. We're...

39
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,730
Sort of broke.

40
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,160
Oh.

41
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,400
Lynette.

42
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,530
Between Porter's legal fees

43
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,200
and that ghost town that we call a restaurant...

44
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:01,660
- I thought Scavo's was doing well.  - When times get tough,

45
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,060
People do without things like pizza and sports cars.

46
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,230
- I am so sorry. I had no idea.  - It's okay.

47
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:11,130
- Just keep it under your hat. It's a little embarrassing.  - You should not be embarrassed.

48
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,160
- This is a horrible economy. We're all in the same boat.  - Mm.

49
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,330
Hello, ladies. What do you think?

50
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,460
You bought a new car?

51
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,260
My book just made the "Times" best seller list.

52
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,030
Now they're talking 3-book deal, so I got the urge to splurge.

53
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,000
Oh!

54
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,330
And look what just blew on my windshield at the stop sign!

55
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,900
Ah!

56
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:40,830
Life is good.

57
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,360
Yes, people don't talk about money in the suburbs

58
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,360
Because when they do,

59
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,130
Other people get angry.

60
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,900
Whenever someone on Wisteria Lane

61
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,400
buys a new car,

62
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,930
a simple ritual is performed.

63
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,560
So how do you like my new car?

64
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,060
- It's gorgeous!  - I am so jealous.

65
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,060
I wish I had one.

66
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,060
But on this day,

67
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,930
One of the owner's friends

68
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,230
refused to participate in the ritual.

69
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,700
And even more surprisingly,

70
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:30,600
The owner of the car in question

71
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,300
didn't seem to notice.

72
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:34,830
Look, there's even a refrigerator.

73
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,630
The Lexus dealer said there's just enough room

74
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,060
for a split of champagne and two chilled glasses.

75
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,560
- Ooh.  - Ahh.

76
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,460
Mmm!

77
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,800
And the best thing is, it's a hybrid

78
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:48,760
So you can barely hear it. Let me show you.

79
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,100
Actually, I have to go to work.

80
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,530
But congratulations, Bree. It's a beauty.

81
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:01,760
Was it just me, or was that a little abrupt?

82
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,800
Eh, don't take it personally.

83
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,760
I think she's got other things on her mind.

84
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,060
Oh, dear. Is something wrong?

85
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,630
Well...

86
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,800
Apparently, she and Tom are having financial problems.

87
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:16,430
They just had to sell Tom's car.

88
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:19,360
And you know, I saw her at the recycling center.

89
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,500
She was turning her cans in for money.

90
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,230
Ohh. Yikes.

91
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,100
That's, like, a half a step away

92
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,100
From selling your eggs on the internet.

93
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:30,300
And here I am, rubbing my fabulous new car in her face.

94
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,230
I feel awful.

95
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,760
Oh, don't. How could you have known?

96
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,900
Thank god I didn't show her how the car parks itself.

97
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,560
But you're gonna show us, right?

98
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,130
Well, it is pretty amazing!

99
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,160
Well, it's nice to see you again, Mrs. Mayer.

100
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,230
Thank you for agreeing to see us, Mr. Hobson.

101
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,600
Running a school like Oakridge

102
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:03,430
Mustn't leave you with much...

103
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,960
Free time.

104
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,700
Happy to oblige.

105
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:11,060
So I heard through the grapevine

106
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,100
That there might be an opening for another student?

107
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:18,860
I assume you're referring to the Henderson boy's expulsion?

108
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,160
Yeah. He bit his teacher, huh?

109
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,560
They had that problem

110
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,430
With their older boy, Toby.

111
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:28,100
It's a family of biters.

112
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,230
Well, the whole situation was incredibly unfortunate.

113
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,760
But...

114
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,360
Mm.

115
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,130
We can't tolerate that kind of behavior.

116
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,260
Well, you wouldn't have to worry about that with M.J.

117
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,560
He's so well-behaved.

118
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,960
Look, I know how much you want your son at Oakridge.

119
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,130
You've called us every week for the past five months.

120
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,130
I've been too pushy. Oh, please don't take it out on M.J.

121
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,000
He is such a bright kid. Say something in Spanish.

122
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,200
I'm bored.

123
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,700
Be bored in Spanish.

124
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:04,360
Mrs. Mayer, you can relax.

125
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,230
We would love to have M.J. Join us here.

126
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,060
Seriously?

127
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,360
Yes.

128
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,100
As a matter of fact, his name was first on our waiting list.

129
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,830
Fantastic!

130
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,060
Oh!

131
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,960
Here's a schedule for you.

132
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,160
Here are some insurance forms you need to fill out.

133
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,760
And here's the tuition.

134
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,030
As you can see, it's gone up a tad.

135
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,300
Oh.

136
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:28,800
Yeah. That's quite a tad.

137
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:31,230
But we're starting in the middle of the year,

138
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,160
So we'd only pay half, right?

139
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,830
Yes. We've already prorated it. That is half.

140
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,160
Fantastic.

141
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,060
Hey, I just thought of a way

142
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,660
For us to celebrate our anniversary next week.

143
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,800
What do you think about dinner at the Palm?

144
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,160
The Palm?

145
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,830
As in,

146
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,730
"they don't even show the prices on the menu" the Palm?

147
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,830
Honey, we're still paying off credit card debt.

148
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:10,160
Not anymore. The deal closed. I got the bonus.

149
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,160
Oh, my god!

150
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,700
That's great!

151
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:15,700
Oh, why didn't you tell me this

152
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:18,800
When you were begging for sex this morning?

153
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:21,060
You would've closed that deal, too. Oh!

154
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,200
Oh. We're rich again! Hallelujah!

155
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:26,030
Well, we are not"lighting cigars with $5 bills" rich,

156
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,460
But we are headed in the right direction.

157
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,360
Oh! Honey, we're gonna be us again...

158
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,630
The old Carlos and Gaby.

159
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,860
You know what?

160
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,830
I'm gonna wear my dress from the night you proposed.

161
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,860
You still fit in that?

162
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,100
We're rich again! Hallelujah!

163
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,100
Have you not noticed me working my butt off?

164
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:49,830
I'm almost back to the weight I was when we got married!

165
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,230
All I meant was...

166
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,200
You don't have to wear an old dress.

167
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:56,100
I will buy you a new one.

168
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:59,100
No, no. This'll be way more romantic.

169
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:04,300
I'm one good colonic away from being the old me!

170
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:07,060
I'll call the restaurant.

171
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,060
They can write that on the cake.

172
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,500
Sorry. I know how much you loved that car.

173
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,730
This is all I have to remember her by.

174
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,700
I called her "Foxy." You wanna know why?

175
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:27,930
No.

176
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,560
Tom.

177
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,860
I just heard. You sold the car?

178
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,060
Yeah.

179
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:36,700
Well, we needed the money. The restaurant is dying.

180
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:38,600
Apparently, people don't wanna buy their pizza

181
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:42,760
- From parents of an alleged arsonist.  - Yeah, but Porter didn't do it.

182
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,500
Well, maybe people still think that he's guilty,

183
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:48,530
or maybe it's the economy.

184
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,630
Or maybe it's both. I don't know.

185
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:53,660
All I know is, I am driving a "dad car"

186
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,960
while some other guy is out rolling with Foxy.

187
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,100
Oh, buddy. I'm so sorry.

188
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:06,230
I wish there was something I could do.

189
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,000
We should get going.

190
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:12,060
But if we can help in any way, um, let us know.

191
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,000
- Okay?  - Thanks.

192
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:23,630
Okay, what just happened back there?

193
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,030
Nothing.

194
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,700
Oh, yeah. Like that's gonna work.

195
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:30,060
Why can't you ever remember who you're dealing with?

196
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:33,130
Bob? Bob? Bob? Bob... I can keep this up all day.

197
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,860
- Bob? B...  - Fine.

198
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,230
The day the case against Porter was dismissed,

199
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,730
I was going over the discovery materials that the DA sent me.

200
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,100
Okay? So?

201
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:45,060
The witness who put Porter in the storage room at the club,

202
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,800
the only one linking him directly to the arson...

203
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:51,160
Tom's helpful buddy there... Dave Williams.

204
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,530
- What?  - Yeah.

205
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,500
Porter wasn't even in the building.

206
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,600
What the hell is Dave doing?

207
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:01,000
- I don't know, but we have to tell Tom and Lynette.  - No, that'll just get ugly.

208
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,800
I'm okay with that.

209
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,760
Lee, the charges have been dropped.

210
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,460
It's no longer our business.

211
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,060
Besides, there's something about that Dave guy

212
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,830
that scares me.

213
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,900
Oh!

214
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:25,830
Oh, I don't get it!

215
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,860
I'm only a few pounds away from my runway weight.

216
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,960
- You want me to let it out?  - That would be cheating.

217
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,960
I'm gonna try to go pee again.

218
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,860
It's okay. You've had two children.

219
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,700
The weight redistributes. Give in to it! I did.

220
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:41,700
Jean, you didn't just give in to it.

221
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,860
You slapped a piece of cheese on it.

222
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,400
Yeah, I said it. Now just fix the hem.

223
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:49,230
And this time, try not to leave the edges frayed.

224
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,900
Ooh! Ooh!

225
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,700
Hey, Edie! Wait up!

226
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,100
Now don't forget, the clasp is broken.

227
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,930
Oh, I'll replace it.

228
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,960
It may not match exactly.

229
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,460
But, um, your hair will cover it.

230
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,660
Jean, Carlos is taking me to the Palm, not out for hoagies.

231
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,230
Make it perfect.

232
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,960
Huh. I see Jean is back.

233
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,930
- Ah, yeah.  - Times are good.

234
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,600
Not for her.

235
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,530
Hey, Mrs. Mccluskey said something

236
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,630
about you losing 5 pounds in one day.

237
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,860
How'd you do that?

238
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,800
I got drunk on Bourbon and threw up all over her lawn.

239
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:31,700
No, not that story. Something about a boot camp.

240
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,360
Oh, yeah. Just started.

241
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,730
Very military, very intense.

242
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,960
That's perfect. I'm trying to fit in an old dress.

243
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,500
- I need intense.  - Forget it. You can't get in without a recommendation,

244
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:44,860
- and I'm not recommending you.  - Why not?

245
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:48,030
Because you'd embarrass me. This is real exercise.

246
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,500
It's not the lotus position followed by a Mocha latte.

247
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:55,830
Oh, you're just afraid I'm gonna look better than you!

248
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,500
6:00 AM, the park. Prepare to die.

249
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:05,400
Jeez. This is the tuition?

250
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,830
We're gonna blow his college fund on first grade.

251
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,400
I know, I know. We may have to give up a few luxuries.

252
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,660
Yeah, like food and heat.

253
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,360
Okay, you know the problems they're having at his school.

254
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,330
And now with all the budget cutbacks...

255
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,460
I mean, this place is fabulous.

256
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,000
Yeah, I'm not saying it's not. I'd kill to send him there.

257
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:26,160
- But I just can't swing it.  - Well, we've gotta do something.

258
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,800
My editor just quit,

259
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:31,660
and my books are not exactly flying off the shelves.

260
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,530
- Could you pick up some extra shifts?  - Oh, yeah, I will...

261
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,030
as soon as they create a 30-hour day.

262
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:42,000
- I'm working around the clock.  - What about that big job you just did for the last three months?

263
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:44,430
What did you do with that money?

264
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,900
Susan, we're not married anymore.

265
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:49,860
And what I do with my money is none of your business.

266
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,700
Yeah, well, if we were still married, you'd...

267
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:57,800
Probably would've waited until I finished my sentence.

268
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:00,860
What's this?

269
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,500
A check.

270
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:05,700
I understand you and Tom are going through some rough times.

271
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:08,500
No. Oh!

272
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,860
Thank you, but I can't accept this.

273
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:17,560
However, I would like to know how much I'm not accepting.

274
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,130
$20,000?!

275
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,730
- How many cookbooks are you selling, woman?  - We just went to a second printing,

276
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,500
And now they're talking a 3-book deal.

277
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:28,530
So seriously, I am not gonna miss that money.

278
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,900
Wow!

279
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,300
That must be nice.

280
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:33,760
But... I can't accept it.

281
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:37,330
Why not? What's the point of success

282
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,630
If you can't share it with the people you love?

283
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,800
- Because the people that you love may not be able to pay you back,

284
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:45,860
And then you stop loving them.  - Then it's not a loan, it's a gift.

285
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:49,930
Don't you have a birthday coming up?

286
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,200
And so do you.

287
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,230
And I'm gonna feel real crappy

288
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,260
When you unwrap your lavender bath beads.

289
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,830
Come on, Lynette.

290
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,930
You can't tell me this money won't take the pressure off.

291
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,860
It would.

292
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:08,730
But I can't. I wouldn't want it to affect our friendship.

293
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,230
Okay.

294
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,730
Although...

295
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,200
How would you like to own

296
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,960
- A piece of an Italian restaurant?  - What?

297
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,930
It wouldn't be a loan or a gift.

298
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,800
It would be... An investment

299
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:26,800
That would buy you, say... 15% of Scavo's.

300
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,860
Oh! Well, that's an intriguing offer.

301
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,930
If we do well, you get a cut of the profits.

302
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:36,500
If we go belly-up, we liquidate, and you get the first $20,000.

303
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:39,900
And then, of course, my family moves in with you.

304
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:42,830
So... Do we have a deal?

305
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,660
We most certainly do...

306
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,860
Partner.

307
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,760
Some people think it's strange

308
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,730
I have a contract for my exercise class.

309
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,130
But I want people to understand

310
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,330
- The commitment I expect from them. I found in the past...  - Here you go.

311
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,900
- All signed.   - You didn't even read it.

312
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:03,660
Oh, no need. I'm up for anything.

313
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,860
Although I did just get a manicure,

314
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,560
So nothing that might chip a nail.

315
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,830
Mrs. Solis...

316
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,830
Let me tell you what I learn in the Israeli army.

317
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:16,430
A group without commitment is a group that will fail.

318
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,960
The women in my morning class are committed.

319
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I am starting to think

320
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:23,330
That you are not tough enough.

321
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,830
Not tough enough?

322
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,730
Let me tell you something, Mr. Iraqi army guy.

323
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,500
- Israeli.  - Whatever.

324
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:33,430
I used to be a model, and you don't know what war is

325
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,530
Until you've been in a dressing room

326
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,360
With a bunch of size zeroes reaching for the last rice cake.

327
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,960
- I am plenty tough.  - I'm not so sure.

328
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,900
Hey, I know some of those women in your exercise class.

329
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:47,100
- The most exercise they ever get is cutting a piece of cake.  - That's a lap!

330
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,800
- Excuse me?  - In the contract.

331
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:51,200
There are certain words I do not tolerate...

332
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,930
"cake," "tired,"

333
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,530
"can't," "doughnut."

334
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,730
If I hear them, you owe me a lap.

335
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,000
It's an exercise class. Why would anyone say "doughnut"?

336
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,800
That's another lap!

337
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,730
You know, maybe I should give this a little gander.

338
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,700
Come on, ladies!

339
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:18,730
When I was in the special forces,

340
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,700
We would do sit-ups in 115-degree weather.

341
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,130
I still have sand in my ass.

342
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,860
You people are weak! Let's go! Let's go!

343
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,360
Gaby, knock it off.

344
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,760
You're gonna get us all in trouble.

345
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,430
It's hard.

346
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:38,300
Of course it is. That's why it's called boot camp.

347
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,130
Just hang in there, Gaby. We all went through it.

348
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,800
Shut up, Mona. I'm puking air.

349
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,330
He's coming. Get crunching.

350
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:51,800
Hey! Did I hear talking?

351
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:54,360
Sorry, sir! She got a little nauseous.

352
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,460
I don't give a rat's ass what your problem is.

You retch on your own time.

354
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:03,260
Okay. We need to talk.

355
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,230
Gaby, no.

356
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,300
What the hell are you doing? Get your butt back down!

357
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:09,960
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.  - Time-out. Time-out?

358
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,100
Look, I appreciate this whole military commando act,

359
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:17,330
- But I'm new at this, and frankly, this is a bit much.  - A bit much?

360
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,230
Yeah. Are we gonna get a break soon?

361
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:23,160
Oh. Oh, we want a break.

362
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:27,000
Like, maybe some coffee, some pastry?

363
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:29,600
Oh, that sounds so yummy.

364
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:33,400
- You got any?  - No, I don't got any! Now get down or I'm gonna put you down!

365
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:37,460
- I said time-out!  - There is no time-out! You signed a contract! Now get down!

366
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,360
- Don't take that tone with me. I am paying.  - Do it! Do it!

367
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,530
- Aah!  - Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!

Mike said he can't afford to pay for M.J.'s private school.

447
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:50,000
Now I know why.

448
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,960
He wants to see his girlfriend wearing pearls

449
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,600

450
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:56,660
What? He wouldn't pay for M.J.'s school?

451
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,730
No. So I was going to take these

452

And sell them to try to pay for it,

453
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,660
And, yes, now that I'm saying it out loud,

456

Hey, Mrs. Mayfair.

457
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,400
It's nice to see you.

458
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,400
Perhaps we should discuss this later.

459
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:42,430
This can't be good.

460
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,960
So is this a "welcome home, we missed you" kind of thing

461
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,730
Or...

462
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,100
Oh.

463
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,460
Damn right, "oh." what happened to "I'm broke

464
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,800
- And can't afford to send M.J. To private school"?  - Don't get me wrong, Mike.

465
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:59,360
It was a wonderfully generous present.

466
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,460
But you can't go around blowing your kid's money

467
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,330
On jewelry for your girlfriend.

468
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,560
What did these cost you? $4,000, $5,000?

469
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,360
$129.

470
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,830
What?

471
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,030
They're fake, okay?

472
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,200
And I knew how badly you wanted pearls,

473
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:19,960
And I couldn't afford real ones.

474
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,630
And the salesman swore you'd never know the difference,

475
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,300
And she didn't.

476
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,760
Well...

477
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:31,200
At least you won't feel bad if you ever lose them.

478
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:36,500
I just wanted to get you a really nice gift,

479
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:38,130
And I don't know.

480
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,260
I... I guess I was embarrassed when I couldn't.

481
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,400
Mike, don't ever feel

482
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:45,900
Like you have to spend money to impress me.

483
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:47,400
Okay?

484
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:49,460
Trust me.

485
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,230
I'm already very impressed.

486
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:01,260
Ugh. Okay, okay. Point made.

487
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,830
Move along.

488
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:06,360
I'll go fix us some dinner.

489
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,530
How dare you.

490
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,000
I didn't know they were fake.

491
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:14,060
I mean how dare you think

492
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,760
That I would put jewelry for my girlfriend

493
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,860
Ahead of my son's education.

494
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,860
Okay, maybe I jumped to conclusions,

495
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,360
But this school is important for M.J.

496
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,400
I feel really bad that we're falling short.

497
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:28,560
Susan, I've been at work since 6:00 this morning,

498
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,530
And after I inhale a 5-minute dinner,

499
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,400
I'm going back out till midnight.

500
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:35,400
I am busting my ass to give our son the best,

501
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:39,830
So if we're falling short, it's not because of me.

502
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,430
What?

503
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:58,430
Where are you? You're late for training.

504
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,860
Oh, yeah, I quit that.

505
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,930
There is no quitting. It's in the contract.

506
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,460
Yeah, well, maybe you should take it up with my lawyer.

507
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,960
Here he is.

508
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,560
We are not leaving!

509
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,400
Oh.

510
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:22,530
Come on, ladies! Keep going!

511
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,700
Keep it moving!

512
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:28,200
What the hell do you think you're doing?

513
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:30,200
When you don't come to boot camp,

514
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:33,030
Boot camp comes to you. Fall in!

515
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:37,730
- Are you out of mind? I have two sleeping children.  - Oh, I know. I've seen the cellulite.

516
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,830
- Fall in!  - Do it, Gaby. There is no quitting.

517
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,800
Oh, don't get all holier than thou, Mona.

518
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:47,030
- I saw you pull into the doughnut shack yesterday.  - Doughnut... that's a lap!

519
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,700
Oh, really? Well, try this on for size.

520
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:52,800
I'm going back to bed, because I'm tired.

521
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:55,700
And when I wake up, maybe I'll have some cake,

522
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:58,560
And you can't stop me.

523
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,160
Gaby!

524
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,800
Where are you going?

525
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,860
If you don't get out there,

526
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,960
He is gonna take it out on the rest of us.

527
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,960
Well, frankly, some of them need it.

528
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,630
I just came for a little remodel,

529
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,460
And there are some real teardowns out there.

530
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,530
Wow. You are one spoiled, selfish, little brat.

531
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,560
Oh, for god sakes, Edie, it's a stupid exercise class.

532
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,100
I tried it. It sucked. I don't want to do it anymore.

533
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:31,060
- Lighten up.  - Well, that stupid little exercise class is filled

534
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:34,000
With women who bust their asses three times a week

535
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:36,360
While raising kids and holding down full-time jobs.

536
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,030
Well, they're crazy. He yells, and they jump.

537
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:42,030
He tells them to run all the way over here, and they do it.

538
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:45,630
He didn't make us come here. We agreed to.

539
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:48,530
What the hell for?

540
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,160
Because you told us

541
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:54,100
That it was important to you to get into that dress.

542
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,300
So we came here to support you.

543
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:01,300
You wanted the old Gaby back?

544
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:03,560
Well, congratulations. You got her...

545
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,100
A self-centered, obnoxious jerk.

546
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:11,600
Personally, I liked poor, paunchy Gaby better.

547
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:14,360
At least she had some humility.

548
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:40,060
Okay, time to stretch.

549
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,560
Not you!

550
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,330
You are 25 minutes late. Give me 50.

551
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:04,330
Oh, my god. You're her!

552
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,030
Well, technically, I'm she, but yes.

553
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:10,030
Your turkey tetrazzini saved my marriage.

554
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,400
Would you sign this for me?

555
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:14,360
Certainly.

556
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,130
I am so excited to be tasting your food tonight.

557
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,730
My food? What are you talking about?

558
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,300
Oh, well, it says here the chefs of Scavo's

559
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:25,700
- Are going to be making recipes from your book.  - They are?

560
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:28,760
I can't wait to try that four cheese pizza.

561
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,700
Well, you might have to.

562
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:32,500
Excuse me.

563
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:34,560
Lynette.

564
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,360
I understand you and your fellow chefs

565
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,030
Will be serving my four cheese pizza tonight.

566
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:42,730
Yep. Just adding the parmesan.

567
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:46,060
But that's commercial parmesan.

568
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,260
So?

569
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,560
So that's like the dust they sweep off the floor

570
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,400
Of a place that makes real cheese.

571
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:54,930
Oh, no. It's fine. We use it all the time.

572
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,560
Oh, perhaps you do, but my recipe specifies fresh grated.

573
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,460
Bree, no one will notice.

574
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,600
Parmesan is the fourth cheese in a four cheese pizza.

575
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:05,060
It's the ringo of these cheeses.

576
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:08,400
Hey, Mr. Scavo said the grease trap is overflowing again.

577
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:11,360
Oh, for pete's sake. I'll be right back.

578
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,600
Uh, take your time.

579
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:17,560
I'm sorry. We haven't been introduced.

580
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,760
I'm Bree Hodge, part owner.

581
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,130
- Hi. I'm Cindy.  - We'll chat later.

582
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,100
Roll out some dough and show me where the basil is.

583
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:27,430
We'll be serving three cheese pizza tonight.

584
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,960
But what about the pizzas that we just made?

585
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:44,830
Tom, I can't tell you how happy I am for you.

586
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:48,260
- This place is packed. It's packed!  - Yep. You know what? Bree really came through for us.

587
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,260
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Even if she hadn't,

588
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,560
You would have landed on your feet.

589
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,560
- I had total faith in you.  - And you have had three scotch and sodas.

590
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,600
Dude, this money goes right in your pocket.

591
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:00,160
Mm! I'm just supporting you.

592
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,830
Hey, I gotta go check on that grease trap.

593
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:05,900
Yeah, I gotta get back to Edie. She wanted me home by 10:00.

594
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,560
But, dude, congratulations.

595
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,860
I'm proud of you.

596
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,530
- See ya.  - You bet.

597
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,730
Hey, Tom?

598
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,060
Yeah?

599
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:16,560
Nothing. Never mind. You're busy. You know, wait.

600
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,630
I...

601
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:21,000
I just want you to know that...

602
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:23,860
- That guy's not your friend.  - Who? Dave?

603
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,330
Is there someplace we can talk?

604
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,100
Yeah.

605
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:38,730
Son of a...

606
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:45,260
If this doesn't stop your mother-in-law

607
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:48,560
From criticizing your cooking, I will give you a full refund.

608
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,530
Hey, can I borrow you a sec?

609
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,860
- Now? People are waiting.  - You'll still be a celebrity in five minutes. Come on.

610
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,130
Excuse me.

611
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,600
You want to explain this?

612
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:08,400
Oh, dear. I was hoping to spare your feelings,

613
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:11,630
But since you know, I wasn't comfortable having my recipe

614
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:14,100
Made with substandard ingredients.

615
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:16,300
We use that parmesan all the time.

616
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:19,600
You can't go changing things without asking me.

617
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:21,460
Hey, you made me partner.

618
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,630
I can change 15%, and I chose the parmesan.

619
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,460
And I don't know if you've heard,

620
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,530
but people are raving about my pizza.

621
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,960
Well, they probably would have loved my pizza, too,

622
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,560
but we'll never know,

623
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,560
because my partner threw it in the garbage. What a waste.

624
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,760
Fine. I'll reimburse you, if that'll make things right.

625
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,530
Oh, sure. It's only money, right?

626
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,300
What's that supposed to mean?

627
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:46,530
We all know how well you're doing, Bree.

628
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,430
You have made that very clear.

629
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,960
But you shouldn't be lording it over everybody

630
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,930
just 'cause you've caught a couple of breaks.

631
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,430
Caught a couple of breaks?

632
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:58,160
I've worked my ass off to get where I am.

633
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,200
I've worked my ass off, too. I just wasn't as lucky as you.

634
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:04,400
Well, I've always believed that we create our own luck.

635
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:06,600
Meaning that I've created my own failure?

636
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:11,060
Well, not completely, but let's face it. You do cut corners.

637
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,960
I mean, one of the things I can teach you

638
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,100
- is the importance of the attention to detail.  - Wow. Talk about luck.

639
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:19,100
When I offered to throw you this little thank-you party,

640
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:22,060
I never imagined that it would turn into an opportunity

641
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,460
for me to learn from the great Bree Hodge.

642
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,730
Well, I'm not the one who needed $20,000

643
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,600
to keep my business afloat.

644
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:33,260
- No, you're the one who's never gonna let me forget it.  - Where are you going?

645
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:36,460
Home. Tell me how the party I threw for you turns out.

646
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:40,330
Lynette, I... I... I don't understand why you're so upset.

647
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,800
I know you don't,

648
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,730
but five years ago, you would've.

649
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:48,400
My car!

650
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:53,160
You know that was an accident, right?

651
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:57,900
I did the best I could on the clasp, Mrs. Solis.

652
00:33:57,930 --> 00:34:01,330
I don't think you'll be able to tell the difference.

653
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,830
Okay, be honest.

654
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:05,260
Here I come.

655
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,360
So what do you think?

656
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,460
You are stunning.

657
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,530
Radiant.

658
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,400
Really?

659
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:25,600
Really.

660
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,300
You're back, Mrs. Solis,

661
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:30,000
exactly like you were before.

662
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:32,560
Oh, I think I've changed a little bit.

663
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,130
Not that I can see.

664
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:42,500
If there's nothing else, I'll be going.

665
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:43,900
Jean, wait.

666
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:45,900
What is it? Is there a problem?

667
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:48,600
No, no. It's perfect.

668
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,500
I just want to tell you

669
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:53,130
how helpful you've been to me over the years,

670
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,530
and I'm really grateful.

671
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,900
Thank you.

672
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:10,300
Hey, buddy. How was the rest of the...

673
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:11,730
Oh!

674
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,630
I know what you did.

675
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,700
- What?!  - Don't give me that!

676
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:21,430
- I know that you told the cops that Porter set that fire.  - I didn't say he set the fire.

677
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:24,200
I only said I saw him in the back hallway.

678
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:26,360
You couldn't have! He wasn't there!

679
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,500
Tom, the cops were really grilling me.

680
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:31,000
They wouldn't let up.

681
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:34,160
I had to tell them what I thought I saw.

682
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,060
Porter could have gone to jail.

683
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:40,030
You almost destroyed my family, destroyed our business.

684
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:43,060
I'll make it up to you. I swear.

685
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,900
I never meant to hurt you or Lynette.

686
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:48,830
Oh, Lynette doesn't know about this. I didn't tell her.

687
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:51,330
If I had, you'd be dead.

688
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,460
I am so sorry.

689
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:56,100
I never should have said anything to the cops.

690
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:59,460
It was dark. I'd been drinking. You've gotta believe me.

691
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,530
Stop.

692
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,800
Just stop.

693
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,100
Are you done?

694
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:10,860
Yeah.

695
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,530
This is crazy.

696
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:18,600
I mean, there's gotta be some way we can work this out.

697
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:21,100
We're friends.

698
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:23,930
That's what I thought, too.

699
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,460
But I don't know who you are.

700
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:36,400
Tom.

701
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:39,260
Tom.

702
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,500
Can I ask you something?

703
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:54,360
Go ahead. Shoot.

704
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,460
I've been thinking a lot

705
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,000
About your first wife.

706
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:00,430
Edie.

707
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:04,030
I know. Just one question, and then I'll shut it.

708
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:07,000
I don't like talking about her.

709
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:09,930
It has been weeks since I found out she even existed,

710
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,960
And I've never mentioned her once.

711
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,360
Come on. Look at this as my reward.

712
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,830
Okay.

713
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,360
One question.

714
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:27,600
Being married to her... Mm-hmm.

715
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:30,530
Or being married to me... Mm.

716
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,430
What's the biggest difference?

717
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:36,530
Honestly?

718
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,430
Our marriage is more real.

719
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,360
Really?

720
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,130
Mm.

721
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,060
In what way?

722
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:51,530
Well,with her, it was like...

723
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,130
A fairy tale.

724
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,430
I thought it would last forever.

725
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,600
It didn't.

726
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:00,900
What you and I have is more real

727
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:03,800
Because I know it's not forever.

728
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:06,530
When I hold you,

729
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,460
When I kiss you,

730
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,260
I try to remind myself to appreciate the moment,

731
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,500
Because tomorrow may never come.

732
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:16,330
Love...

733
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:21,530
Is just temporary.

734
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,300
The way the fairy tale ends...

735
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:26,060
Is death.

736
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,360
My first instinct

737
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,600
Was to ask you if she was prettier than me.

738
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:41,460
When will I learn to go with my gut?

739
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:52,560
I'm sorry. You can't afford the tuition?

740
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,730
No.

741
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,000
But I read in your brochure

742
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:58,560
That faculty members get a 50% discount,

743
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,860
So for your Art Department,

744
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,430
How would you like to hire

745
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:07,030
An award-winning children's book illustrator

746
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:11,200
Who is great with kids and has a face you can't say no to?

747
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,600
Unfortunately,

748
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:14,460
Our Art Department is fully staffed.

749
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,500
Can't say no.

750
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:20,560
Miss Mayer,

751
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,400
I appreciate your enthusiasm

752
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:25,000
And the face,

753
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:27,600
But I'm afraid it just won't work out.

754
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:29,300
I wish you the best of luck.

755
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:32,100
Yes.

756
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:35,430
Right.

757
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:41,200
No, wrong.

758
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:44,330
Miss Mayer, please, I'm so busy.

759
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:47,700
Look, I know I said that M.J. was a star student,

760
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:49,560
But the truth is,

761
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,530
He's one of those kids that needs extra attention.

762
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,200
The classes at his school are way too big,

763
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:58,400
And I see him getting lost in the shuffle.

764
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:01,360
And if he gets lost now...

765
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:05,730
My ex-husband is doing everything that he can,

766
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,500
And I need to know that I am, too.

767
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:12,560
I will serve lunches.

768
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,260
I will be a janitor.

769
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,500
Anything.

770
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:22,330
But I am not walking out on my son's future.

771
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:29,930
Well, one of our art teachers does need an assistant,

772
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,330
But you're completely overqualified.

773
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,500
I'll take it.

774
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:40,530
Congratulations on your new job.

775
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,800
Congratulations.

776
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:45,460
On getting me out of your office.

777
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,260
What's that?

778
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,530
A check for the damage to your car.

779
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:56,460
I can't afford to go through my insurance company.

780
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,860
Oh, Lynette, don't be silly. It's just the bumper.

781
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:02,330
You don't need to do that.

782
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,860
Yes, I do.

783
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,400
And the minute we're back on our feet,

784
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:08,560
I am gonna pay back your investment...

785
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,430
Every penny,

786
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:13,030
With interest.

787
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:16,560
Lynette, stop. Wait. Please. Don't be this way.

788
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,460
I don't want money to get in the way of our friendship.

789
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,130
Yeah...

790
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,530
I think it's a little late for that.

791
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,060
There's a lot you can do with money in the suburbs.

792
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:44,260
You can pay for a night on the town.

793
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,300
You can provide a private school education.

794
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:00,160
You can purchase a token of affection.

795
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:07,000
But the one thing you must never do with money

796
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:09,860
Is use it as a weapon,

797
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:13,030
Because someone...

798
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:16,460
Always gets hurt.
