5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,100
NO, IT WOULDN'T.

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,400
YOU WORK HERE?

7
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,400
I'M GREAT WITH FOOD.
I UNDERSTAND BUSINESS.

- A FEW.

HELEN SAID YOUR LAST RESERVATION
JUST CANCELED. DO YOU WANT A RIDE HOME?

25
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,300
THANKS, CLAY.
THAT'D BE GREAT.

26
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,900
UM... CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,700
HOW LONG YOU BEEN A MASSEUR?

28
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,400
14 YEARS.

29
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,000
OKAY.
AND IN ALL THOSE YEARS...

30
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,100
HAVE YOU EVER ACCIDENTALLY
GIVEN A WOMAN...

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
AN ORGASM?

32
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,800
- AN ORGASM?!
- KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN.
YOU WANT TO GET ME FIRED?

33
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,200
HOW DO YOU ACCIDENTALLY
GIVE A WOMAN AN ORGASM?

34
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,200
I DON'T KNOW.

35
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,100
<i>I CAN BARELY GIVE MY GIRLFRIEND ONE,</i>

36
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,400
AND I TRY REALLY HARD.

37
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,800
ALL I DID
WAS TOUCH HER BACK.

38
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,700
ARE YOU SURE? SOME OF THESE
OLD BROADS-- THEIR BODIES DROP.

39
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,000
NOT EVERYTHING'S
WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE.

40
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,000
I MAY BE BLIND, BUT MY SENSE
OF TOUCH IS JUST FINE.

41
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,700
WELL, THEN MAYBE SHE JUST
REALLY LIKED THE MASSAGE.

42
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,100

HOW MUCH SHE LEAVE ME?

48
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,200

147
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,400
BUT PROMISE YOU'LL AT LEAST
CONSIDER MY LITTLE PROPOSAL.

148
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,100
WHAT PROPOSAL?

149
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,900
I HATE TO STOP WHEN WE'RE
MAKING SO MUCH PROGRESS,

150
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,700

153
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,700
SEE? I TOLD YOU. IT'S TOO LONG,
AND GABY HAS THE GIRLS AND--

154
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,200
I KNOW IT'S A LOT TO ASK,

155
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,600

- I'LL LEAVE YOU TWO
TO DISCUSS IT.

160
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,100
WELL, UH, WHAT'S TO DISCUSS?
FOR THAT KIND OF MONEY,

161
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,200
YOU CAN LOCK HIM IN A CAGE
AND FEED HIM PEANUTS.

162
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,900
I'LL SEEI'OU TOMORROW, CARLOS.
EETING YOU, GABY.

163
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,200
CARLOS, DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT SAYING NO TO THIS!

164
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,900
SHE IS NOT MY ONLY CLIENT. I'LL BE
LETTING DOWN THE REST IF I GO.

165
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,500
MR. BANKS COULD EVEN FIRE ME.

166
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,400

167
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,400

- AND SO WHAT IF HE FIRES YOU?

168
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,700

LADY FRIENDS ABOUT WHAT YOU DID FOR HER,

169
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,200
THEY'LL BE LINING UP
AROUND THE BLOCK.

170
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,500
GREAT.

171
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,200
HEY, GREAT NEWS.

172
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,900
I JUST GOT A CALL FROM
MY OLD FRIEND, PETER HICKEY.

173
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,200
I DON'T RECALL EVER HEARING
THAT NAME BEFORE.

174
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,600
HE'S A FRIEND FROM COLLEGE. ANYWAY,

175
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,000
HE MENTIONED THAT HIS PARENTS'
50th ANNIVERSARY WAS NEXT MONTH,

176
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,400
AND I CONVINCED HIM TO LET US
CATER IT. DINNER FOR 80.

177
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,100
- 80?!
- HE SHOOTS, HE SCORES!

178
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,200
ORSON! YOU ARE AMAZING! OH!

179
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:07,100
ONE WEEK ON THE JOB, AND HE'S ALREADY
BRINGING IN HUGE ACCOUNTS.

180
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,700
THAT'S GREAT.

181
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,300
WELL, BETTER GO MARINATE THOSE
SCALLOPS FOR THE LUNCH TOMORROW.

182
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,700
OH, SCALLOPS? DONE.

183
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,900
- DONE?
- MM.

184
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,200
OH, I ALSO MADE
THE PESTO MAYONNAISE,

185
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,800
AND I PUT THE INDIVIDUAL
COBBLERS IN THEIR RAMEKINS.

186
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,700
OH. WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE
ALL SET UNTIL THE MORNING THEN.

187
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,400
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU, UH,
TAKE THE AFTERNOON OFF?

188
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,900
AND DO WHAT?

189
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:32,000
I DON'T KNOW--READ, RELAX,
GIVE YOURSELF A PEDICURE.

190
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,900
FINE.

191
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,100
WHAT DO YOU BET I TAKE MY SOCKS OFF
AND SEE ORSON'S ALREADY DONE IT FOR ME?

192
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,400
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

193
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,400
REFRIGERATOR NEEDS CLEANING.

194
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,000
NO, IT DOESN'T.

195
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,600
AND BESIDES, I GAVE YOU
THE DAY OFF. NOW GO HOME.

196
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,800
I'M THINKING ABOUT
MOVING TO MARYLAND.

197
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,900
MARYLAND?

198
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,441
MM-HMM. DYLAN'S THERE
WITH HER HUSBAND,

199
00:10:01,474 --> 00:10:02,949
AND THE BABY'S COMING SOON.

200
00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:05,193
MAYBE IT'S TIME FOR ME
TO GO INFLICT MYSELF ON THEM.

201
00:10:05,193 --> 00:10:07,795
YOU CAN'T JUST UP AND MOVE.
YOU HAVE A LIFE HERE.

202
00:10:07,795 --> 00:10:10,439
NO, I DON'T.
I HAVE A JOB--PERIOD.

203
00:10:10,439 --> 00:10:13,632
NO KIDS TO RAISE, NO HUSBAND,
NO BOYFRIEND.

204
00:10:13,632 --> 00:10:17,413
MIGHT AS WELL THROW IN THE TOWEL
AND... GO BE A GRANDMA.

205
00:10:17,725 --> 00:10:20,741
KATHERINE, YOU ARE A VIBRANT,
ATTRACTIVE WOMAN. YOU--

206
00:10:20,774 --> 00:10:23,227
WHO HASN'T HAD SEX
IN TWO YEARS.

207
00:10:23,227 --> 00:10:25,145
THAT SPELLS "GRANDMA" TO ME.

208
00:10:28,877 --> 00:10:31,650
I HAVEN'T MADE UP MY MIND YET.
JUST LET ME THINK ABOUT IT.

209
00:10:31,949 --> 00:10:33,976
AND HELP KEEP ME BUSY.

210
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:38,844
WHEN YOU'RE DONE WITH THAT,
THE OVEN COULD USE A REALLY GOOD SCRUBBING.

211
00:10:38,844 --> 00:10:40,210
BLESS YOU.

212
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:47,103
KAREN?

213
00:10:48,741 --> 00:10:51,967
OH. THOSE MUST'VE
SET YOU BACK A CHUNK.

214
00:10:51,967 --> 00:10:53,662
YES, THEY DID...

215
00:10:53,662 --> 00:10:56,006
NOT THAT YOU DESERVE THEM.

216
00:10:56,741 --> 00:10:58,819
I DON'T BLAME YOU
FOR BEING MAD.

217
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,616
I'M NOT MAD.

218
00:11:01,616 --> 00:11:04,022
I'M FURIOUS.

219
00:11:04,057 --> 00:11:06,127
NOW WHAT THE HELL
WERE YOU THINKING,

220
00:11:06,127 --> 00:11:08,249
COMING AT MY HUSBAND
WITH A BASEBALL BAT?

221
00:11:08,249 --> 00:11:11,042
I KNOW.
I'M REALLY SORRY, EDIE.

222
00:11:11,042 --> 00:11:14,391
THE DOCTOR HAD ME ON THESE
NEW MEDS, AND IT MADE ME LOOPY.

223
00:11:14,391 --> 00:11:15,941
I THOUGHT DAVE
WAS MESSING WITH MY HEAD,

224
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:18,949
AND ALL THE TIME,
IT WAS THE DAMN PILLS.

225
00:11:18,949 --> 00:11:20,864
WELL, I HOPE
YOU STOPPED TAKING THEM.

226
00:11:20,864 --> 00:11:21,943
YOU BET.

227
00:11:22,093 --> 00:11:24,284
I HAD TO GET
MY MARBLES BACK.

228
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:28,975
UH, LOOK, I KNOW YOU JUST GOT HERE,
BUT I AM SO SLEEPY AND...

229
00:11:29,008 --> 00:11:32,548
OF COURSE. I'LL SEE YOU
WHEN YOU GET HOME.

230
00:11:36,407 --> 00:11:40,151
ACTUALLY, I'M GONNA CALL MY SISTER
AND SEE IF I CAN STAY WITH R FOR A WHILE.

231
00:11:40,151 --> 00:11:42,914
I DON'T THINK I SHOULD
BE ON MY OWN JUST YET.

232
00:11:42,914 --> 00:11:46,519
OKAY. THEN I'LL
SEE YOU WHENEVER.

233
00:11:47,743 --> 00:11:50,750
OH, BE SURE AND TELL DAVE
HOW SORRY I AM.

234
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,289
HE WILL BE SO GLAD.

235
00:11:53,289 --> 00:11:55,354
HE'S REALLY FOND OF YOU,
YOU KNOW.

236
00:12:04,964 --> 00:12:06,728
OH, COME ON, COME ON,
COME ON, COME ON.

237
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,780
HEY, SIS. IT'S KAREN.

238
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:13,355
DO ME A FAVOR AND GET YOUR SORRY ASS OVER TO
FAIRVIEW MEMORIAL HOSPITAL A.S.A.P.

239
00:12:13,355 --> 00:12:15,616
I NEED YOU BIG-TIME, KIDDO.

240
00:12:19,901 --> 00:12:21,117
COME IN.

241
00:12:23,121 --> 00:12:26,040
HI. I'M LOOKING FOR ORSON HODGE.
I'M PETER HICKEY.

242
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,579
OH! YES, OF COURSE.
UH, I'M HIS WIFE BREE.

243
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:32,823
I'M AFRAID HE'S OUT RUNNING ERRANDS,
BUT HE'S TOLD ME ALL ABOUT YOU.

244
00:12:32,823 --> 00:12:37,041
- OH?
- YES. HE SAID YOU WERE ROOMMATES BACK IN COLLEGE.

245
00:12:37,295 --> 00:12:39,064
YES, WE WERE.

246
00:12:39,064 --> 00:12:40,006
HAVE A SEAT.

247
00:12:40,006 --> 00:12:42,793
ANYWAY, MY PARENTS'
50th ANNIVERSARY IS COMING UP,

248
00:12:42,793 --> 00:12:45,471
AND I THOUGHT I'D SURPRISE THEM
WITH A FAMILY REUNION.

249
00:12:45,636 --> 00:12:47,723
WHAT A THOUGHTFUL SON
YOU ARE.

250
00:12:54,788 --> 00:12:58,832
SO, UH, HAVE YOU GIVEN
ANY THOUGHT TO THE VENUE?

251
00:12:58,832 --> 00:13:01,044
UH, YES. I HAVE A SUMMER PLACE
UP IN LAKE PLEASANT.

252
00:13:01,044 --> 00:13:03,496
AH, PRETTY SURE THE TERRACE
FITS EIGHT TABLES OF TEN.

253
00:13:03,496 --> 00:13:05,845
MY, THAT'S A NICE LITTLE
TERRACE.

254
00:13:05,845 --> 00:13:11,396
WE, WE WILL THROW YOU A PARTY SO SPECIAL
THAT YOU'LL WANT US TO CATER YOUR ANNIVERSARY, TOO.

255
00:13:11,396 --> 00:13:13,227
UH, ACTUALLY,
I'M NOT MARRIED.

256
00:13:14,122 --> 00:13:15,454
OH.

257
00:13:17,075 --> 00:13:19,343
WELL, LET'S TALK ABOUT FOOD.

258
00:13:19,343 --> 00:13:22,882
WITH A NEW CLIENT, WHAT I USUALLY DO
IS DISCUSS POSSIBLE MENUS,

259
00:13:22,882 --> 00:13:27,435
AND THEN I HAVE MY VERY BEST CHEF
PREPARE A SAMPLE DINNER.

260
00:13:28,067 --> 00:13:30,198
"SAMPLE DINNER"?

261
00:13:30,198 --> 00:13:32,425
WE DON'T DO SAMPLE DINNERS.

262
00:13:32,425 --> 00:13:36,016
BUT THIS IS
ORSON'S COLLEGE ROOMMATE.

263
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:38,836
AND...
HE'S QUITE THE CATCH!

264
00:13:38,836 --> 00:13:40,185
OH, WAIT A MINUTE.

265
00:13:40,185 --> 00:13:42,560
IS THIS A SETUP?
BECAUSE I LOATHE BLIND DATES.

266
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,833
WELL, THAT'S WHAT'S
SO GREAT ABOUT IT.

267
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:45,640
TECHNICALLY,
IT'S A BUSINESS DINNER.

268
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:50,392
IT HAS ALL THE POTENTIAL UPSIDE OF A DATE
WHILE STILL BEING TAX-DEDUCTIBLE.

269
00:13:51,235 --> 00:13:53,781
FINE.
I WILL COOK FOR THE MAN.

270
00:13:53,781 --> 00:13:55,597
BUT I AM NOT
GOING TO GET DRESSED UP,

271
00:13:55,597 --> 00:13:59,172
I'M NOT GOING TO PUT ON MAKEUP,
AND I AM NOT GOING TO FLIRT.

272
00:13:59,654 --> 00:14:01,314
HE CAME WHILE ORSON WAS OUT.

273
00:14:01,314 --> 00:14:03,884
I LET HIM RECORD A MESSAGE
ON MY PHONE.

274
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,203
Orson,sorry I missed you,

275
00:14:09,203 --> 00:14:10,930
Catch you next time, okay?

276
00:14:12,287 --> 00:14:15,806
YOU REALIZE YOU COULD HAVE JUST LED WITH THIS
AND SAVED US THIS WHOLEISCUSSION?

277
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,194
JEEZ, ROBERTA!

278
00:14:24,668 --> 00:14:27,748
PUT THAT DAMN THING OUT.
YOU'RE NOT IN A CORNER SALOON.

279
00:14:27,748 --> 00:14:30,086
THEN HOW COME THERE'S BOURBON
IN MY COFFEE?

280
00:14:30,086 --> 00:14:31,736
DO I HAVE TO CALL A NURSE?

281
00:14:31,736 --> 00:14:33,971
FINE. I DROVE 80 MILES
TO SEE YOU, KAREN.

282
00:14:33,971 --> 00:14:36,162
YOU BETTER BE DYING,
OR YOU'RE GONNA PAY FOR MY GAS.

283
00:14:36,162 --> 00:14:39,215
I'M NOT DYING, BUT THERE'S
SOMEONE WHO SURE WISHES I WAS.

284
00:14:39,215 --> 00:14:41,279
SON OF A BITCH
LANDED ME IN HERE.

285
00:14:41,843 --> 00:14:44,868
YOU TELL ME WHERE TO FIND HIM.
I'LL CLEAN HIS DAMN CLOCK.

286
00:14:44,868 --> 00:14:46,774
NO, WE'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL
WITH THIS GUY.

287
00:14:46,774 --> 00:14:48,363
- MM.
- HE'S DANGEROUS.

288
00:14:48,933 --> 00:14:53,603
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT THAT BIKER IN FLORIDA
WHO NOW HAS TO PUREE ALL HIS FOOD.

289
00:14:54,486 --> 00:14:56,663
HMM, NEARLY FORGOT
ABOUT HIM.

290
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:58,919
THAT WAS A FUN VACATION.

291
00:15:00,648 --> 00:15:01,960
SO WHAT DO YOU NEED ME
TO DO?

292
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,874
LET ME COME STAY WITH YOU
WHEN I GET OUTTA HERE.

293
00:15:04,874 --> 00:15:07,489
THIS GUY THINKS I'M OUT OF COMMISSION,
AND I WANT TO KEEP IT THAT WAY.

294
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:09,531
AND YOU CAN HELP ME
DO SOME DIGGING.

295
00:15:09,531 --> 00:15:11,783
YOU STILL WORK FOR
THAT CELL PHONE COMPANY? THE...

296
00:15:11,898 --> 00:15:14,604
TELESHORE. YES, GOD HELP ME.

297
00:15:14,604 --> 00:15:17,741
GOOD. PULL HIS RECORDS
AND SEE WHAT TURNS UP.

298
00:15:17,741 --> 00:15:19,116
THE NAME IS
DAVE WILLIAMS.

299
00:15:19,116 --> 00:15:20,850
HOW DO YOU KNOW
HE'S WITH TELESHORE?

300
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,537
I WENT THROUGH HIS MAIL.

301
00:15:23,961 --> 00:15:26,647
GOD, YOU REMIND ME OF MOM.

302
00:15:29,302 --> 00:15:31,180
SO WHAT ELSE YOU NEED?

303
00:15:31,622 --> 00:15:33,891
COULD YOU
SMUGGLE ME IN A COLD BREWSKI?

304
00:15:38,929 --> 00:15:41,305
BOY, NO ONE KNOWS YOU
LIKE FAMILY.

305
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,618
JACKSON? IT'S ME.

306
00:15:58,971 --> 00:16:00,175
HELLO?

307
00:16:06,788 --> 00:16:08,384
THAT'LL WORK.

308
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,353
ARE YOU OKAY?

309
00:16:49,853 --> 00:16:51,218
I THINK SO.

310
00:16:52,153 --> 00:16:53,360
GOOD.

311
00:16:54,619 --> 00:16:56,149
SO WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

312
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:59,578
DARCY.
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

313
00:16:59,578 --> 00:17:02,003
SUSAN, JACKSON'S GIRLFRIEND.

314
00:17:02,003 --> 00:17:05,803
HE NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT A GIRLFRIEND
WHEN WE HOOKED UP AT THE CLUB.

315
00:17:05,803 --> 00:17:10,691
WELL, WHEN GUYS GOSLUT-HU
THEY TEND NOT TO PLAY THE GIRLFRIEND CARD.

316
00:17:11,476 --> 00:17:13,515
DID YOU JUST CALL ME
A SLUT?!

317
00:17:13,515 --> 00:17:15,387
YOU MET THE GUY TONIGHT.
NOW YOU'RE IN HIS SHOWER.

318
00:17:15,387 --> 00:17:16,710
I'M JUST DOING THE MATH.

319
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,102
GOT THE PIZZA.

320
00:17:18,422 --> 00:17:20,393
OH... CRAP.

321
00:17:20,428 --> 00:17:24,067
SO WE BREAK UP, AND 15 MINUTES LATER
YOU'RE WITH SOMEONE ELSE?

322
00:17:24,986 --> 00:17:26,717
YOU GOT OVER ME FAST.

323
00:17:26,717 --> 00:17:28,719
I'M SURPRISED IT TOOK
15 MINUTES.

324
00:17:28,719 --> 00:17:30,042
STAY OUT OF THIS.

325
00:17:30,042 --> 00:17:31,545
SUSAN, WHY ARE YOU HERE?

326
00:17:32,353 --> 00:17:34,712
I WANTED TO TALK
ABOUT OUR FUTURE.

327
00:17:35,094 --> 00:17:37,316
YOU--YOU SAID
YOU DIDN'T WANT A FUTURE.

328
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:40,334
WELL, I WAS STARTING
TO CHANGE MY MIND,

329
00:17:40,334 --> 00:17:44,980
AND THEN I SHOW UP AND FIND 5 FEET OF LIP GLOSS
IN THE SHOWER.

330
00:17:46,722 --> 00:17:49,454
I BROUGHT HOT WINGS.
YOU'RE NOT GETTING ANY.

331
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,896
HI. WHAT'S THAT FOR?

332
00:17:55,896 --> 00:17:59,129
WELL, I WAS GONNA USE IT TO WASH
DOWN A BOTTLE OF SLEEPING PILLS

333
00:17:59,129 --> 00:18:02,499
THE NEXT TIME YOUR HUSBAND'S "BAND"
DEFILED ANOTHER ROCK CLASSIC.

334
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:05,833
BUT SINCE YOU GOT THEM A REHEARSAL SPACE,
I THOUGHT WE COULD SHARE IT OVER ICE.

335
00:18:06,538 --> 00:18:07,944
COME ON IN.

336
00:18:10,153 --> 00:18:13,539
WE'RE TAKING OFF.
REMEMBER, I'M SPENDING THE NIGHT AT KIRBY'S HOUSE.

337
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:15,660
OH, RIGHT. AND, KIRBY,
TELL YOUR MOM THANKS.

338
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,786
THAT PLACE SHE FOUND FOR TOM
IS ALREADY PAYING OFF.

339
00:18:17,786 --> 00:18:20,898
YEAH, SHE SAID SHE WAS THERE YESTERDAY
AND SAID IT WAS LOOKING PRETTY COOL.

340
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,178
SH-SHE WAS THERE? WHY?

341
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:26,201
SHE WAS JUST DROPPING OFF SOME
OLD FURNITURE FOR MR. SCAVO--

342
00:18:26,201 --> 00:18:28,277
A COUPLE CHAIRS,
LAMP, FUTON.

343
00:18:29,764 --> 00:18:30,860
OH.

344
00:18:31,385 --> 00:18:33,109
WELL, SEE YOU TOMORROW.

345
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:35,194
OKAY. DRIVE SAFELY.

346
00:18:35,194 --> 00:18:36,353
YEAH.

347
00:18:37,337 --> 00:18:39,913
- UM... NEAT OR ROCKS?
- ROCKS.

348
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:45,106
SO WHY DOES TOM NEED A BED
IN HIS REHEARSAL SPACE?

349
00:18:45,106 --> 00:18:47,828
NOT A BED--A FUTON, LIKE A COUCH.

350
00:18:47,828 --> 00:18:49,536
THAT FOLDS OUT TO A BED.

351
00:18:49,571 --> 00:18:50,933
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

352
00:18:50,933 --> 00:18:53,976
WELL, IF IT'S JUST A COUCH, WHY
DIDN'T TOM TELL YOU ABOUT IT?

353
00:18:54,011 --> 00:18:57,565
- HOW DO YOU KNOW HE DIDN'T?
- I DON'T. DID HE?

354
00:18:59,153 --> 00:19:00,107
NO.

355
00:19:01,952 --> 00:19:03,751
WELL, GOOD FOR YOU.

356
00:19:03,753 --> 00:19:07,196
GOOD FOR YOU FOR NOT WORRYING ABOUT
YOUR HUSBAND'S BACHELOR PAD.

357
00:19:07,196 --> 00:19:10,857
YOU ARE NOT THE TEENIEST BIT
PARANOID, AND I SAY BRAVA.

358
00:19:12,512 --> 00:19:14,004
NOW WHY AREN'T WE DRINKING?

359
00:19:23,479 --> 00:19:26,477
NOT BAD! I MEAN,
WE WERE REALLY COOKIN' THERE.

360
00:19:26,477 --> 00:19:28,392
TOM, YOU GOT ANY BEER
IN THE FRIDGE?

361
00:19:28,392 --> 00:19:30,505
I GOT NOTHING BUT BEER
IN THE FRIDGE.

362
00:19:30,505 --> 00:19:32,236
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE,
GO GRAB A COLD ONE.

363
00:19:32,236 --> 00:19:34,730
YOU EARNED IT.
YOU SOUNDED GREAT.

364
00:19:36,053 --> 00:19:38,655
- OH, DO WE BLOW.
- OH, YEAH.

365
00:19:38,655 --> 00:19:40,115
NOT YOU, THOUGH. MAN,

366
00:19:40,115 --> 00:19:42,030
YOU GOT THE HEART
OF A REAL BLUES GUY.

367
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,377
AH, THAT'S WHAT FIVE YEARS
IN PRISON'LL DO TO YA.

368
00:19:44,377 --> 00:19:45,916
OH, YEAH. I HEARD ABOUT THAT.

369
00:19:46,725 --> 00:19:47,832
STILL...

370
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,297
IT'S FUN, ISN'T IT?

371
00:19:49,297 --> 00:19:50,681
HIGHLIGHT OF MY WEEK.

372
00:19:51,937 --> 00:19:52,919
YOU KNOW, UH...

373
00:19:53,439 --> 00:19:55,567
I WAS THINKING, MAYBE WE SHOULD
BUMP UP OUR REHEARSAL SCHEDULE,

374
00:19:55,567 --> 00:19:57,368
YOU KNOW, TO START
WORKING THE KINKS OUT.

375
00:19:57,368 --> 00:19:59,210
AH, TWICE A WEEK'S
ABOUT ALL I CAN HANDLE.

376
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:01,447
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
THAT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN THIS?

377
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,200
Well, let's see. My job, my son.

378
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,900
also, i just...

379
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,300
met this woman.

380
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,700
Oh, no, dude,
not blowing us off for a girl.

381
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,300
Buddy, i just started
seeing her, all right?

382
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,300
It's kind of important For the whole
"getting back on the horse" thing.

383
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,200
Right, what about saturday afternoon?

384
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,700
I mean, come on, man.

385
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,200
We gotta do this.

386
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,400
Why?

387
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,700
You're putting a lot of time and effort
Into a neighborhood garage band.

388
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,400
Why is it such a big deal to you?

389
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,200
It's not.

390
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,300
I'm--I'm just having a real good time.

391
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,300
All right, boys! What do you say?

392
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,500
We gonna drink beer or
we gonna play some rock 'n' roll?

393
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,200
Tom, where are you?

394
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,300
Hey, babe, we just really
got into a groove at rehearsal,

395
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,800
And i think we're gonna play
for a couple more hours.

396
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,900
Yeah?

397
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,400
Anyway, i just wanna say
don't wait up for me.

398
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,700
And i will, um,
i'll see you in the morning, okay?

399
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,700
Okay.

400
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Bye.

401
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,200
Oh, my god.

402
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,500
Lynette!

403
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,900
You said you were rehearsing.

404
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,400
I know. I know.

405
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,800
The guys--The guys left,
and i just figured i'd, uh...

406
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,500
Hang out for a little bit.

407
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,100
Why can't you do that at home?

408
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,900
What the hell is this?

409
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,200
You moving out on me?

410
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,200
Why would i move out?

411
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,500
So you can have your affair--

412
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,500
You know, the one
that follows the sports car

413
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:00,200
And the garage band
And wanting to quit your job,

414
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,100
The final stage of your midlife crisis.

415
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,300
Oh, and then...

416
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:09,100
When i hear anne schilling
has been dropping by--

417
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,800
Lynette! She had a bunch of old,
crappyurniture in her garage.

418
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,600
I bought it for 50 bucks.

419
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,000
You don't really think that...

420
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,800
Okay...

421
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,300
These past few months,

422
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,400
When we've been fighting about
the car and the road trip,

423
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,300
Part...

424
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,700
Part of me thought that you were
just complaining to complain,

425
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,800
Trying to ruin my fun.

426
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,700
But if it's affecting you like this,

427
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:40,600
If it's making you actually think
That i would hurt you in that way,

428
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,200
I'm done with all of this.

429
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,800
So you'll come home?

430
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,400
Of course.

431
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,800
Let me just square
all this stuff away, okay?

432
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,200
And then i will see you there.

433
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,200
Good.

434
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,500
Maybe when you come home,

435
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,000
<i>You could teach me
how to play that video game.</i>

436
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,800
That'd be great.

437
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,700
Okay.

438
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,800
Hey, clay. Is mr. Banks around?

439
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,500
he's not back from lunch yet.
What's up?

440
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:41,300
i need to sweet-Talk him
Into giving carlos two months off.

441
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,700
Oh, you two going away somewhere?

442
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,500
No, just carlos.

443
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,900
Mrs. Hildebrand is taking him to europe
As her personal massage therapist.

444
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,400
Personal massage therapist?

445
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,500
Paying him a fortune.

446
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,900
But he's worth it.

447
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,800
I mean, what he's done for that woman,
No one else has been able to do.

448
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,400
So...

449
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,000
he told you about that?

450
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,200
They both did.

451
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,400
You should have seen the woman,
Looking at carlos, gushing like crazy.

452
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,400
And you're okay with them
going away together?

453
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,100
Why should i be jealous?
The woman's, like, 60.

454
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:15,300
If she gets off on carlos'
magical touch, what do i care?

455
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,300
Yeah.

456
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,800
Well, you're broad-Minded.

457
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,000
You know, if my girlfriend knew

458
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,500
That my ssages were
giving a woman orgasms,

459
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,200
No matter how old she was--

460
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,600
Nobody used the "o" word.

461
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,500
He didn't mention that?

462
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,000
No! He's giving her orgasms?!

463
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,200
Nah, not deliberately!

464
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,200
Uh, he swears he's only been
doing his standard massage.

465
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,200
Oh, i bet he does!

466
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,000
Where is he? Is she here now?

467
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,100
Oh, no, no.

468
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,900
She prefers her place,
so she's been sending a car for him.

469
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,600
Where? Where does she live?

470
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,200
It's that big house
On the corner of lake and pinehurst.

471
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,400
I'm sorry, gaby.
Is there anything i can do?

472
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:58,800
Well, when the time comes,
an alibi would be nice.

473
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,600
We need to talk.

474
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,800
♪♪

475
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,200
I have the mailman upstairs in my tub.

476
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,400
You know what?

477
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,900
You have no right to be mad at me.

478
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,100
I don't?

479
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,200
I try to commit to you,
and you push me away.

480
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,100
I try to move on,
and i'm a shallow jerk,

481
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,500
What the hell are you doing?

482
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,100
Yeah, i have been married twice,

483
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:27,100
And both times that's imploded,
So really, i feel like...

484
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,200
Love is not my friend.

485
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,000
You know,

486
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,400
i-I wish that i could say
it was just rotten luck, But...

487
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,400
I just am thinking that...

488
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,400
I can't do this.

489
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,700
<i>You can't?</i>

490
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,800
I-I never even had a real girlfriend
before i met you. I didn't want one.

491
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,100
And the first time i try to commit,
bam! I get smacked.

492
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,500
Look, i don't even know
where we are anymore.

493
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:00,000
We really messed this up, didn't we?

494
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,000
Pretty much, yeah.

495
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,700
We just have so much baggage.

496
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,300
I wish we could start over.

497
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,500
<i>Can we start over?</i>

498
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,600

00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,700
Well, anyway,
i thought we really clicked,

506
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,800
So i was wondering if you might
want to have dinner with me.

507
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Okay.

508
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,400
When?

509
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,500
Tomorrow.

510
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,000
I know this great mexican--

511
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,100
French place.

512
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,600
Sounds great.

513
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,000
Pick me up at 7:00.

514
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,200
Great.

515
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,300
Where do you live?

516
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,600
May i help you?

517
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,300
Excuse me.

518
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,900
<i>I am gabrielle solis.</i>

519
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,900
Perhaps you know my husband?

520
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,100
He "rubs" your boss.

521
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,000
Where are they?

522
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:47,700
I am under strict instructions
not to disturb mrs. Hildebrand.

523
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,900
You can wait here.

524
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,200
Fine.

525
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:57,200
When the cops bust up this brothel,
I'm gonna tell them you're the madame.

526
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,300
yes. That's it, right there.

527
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,700
You sure this isn't too rough?

528
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,900
No way.

529
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,700
??Go deeper. I can take it.

530
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,100
Hold on.

531
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,900
I've got a crick. I...

532
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,400
Carlos,

533
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:44,400
i just remembered I had
an important business call to make.

534
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,800
Could you give me the room
for a minute?

535
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,900
Absolutely.

536
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,900
Mrs. Solis, what are you doing here?

537
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,000
I know what you've been up to,
and shame on you.

538
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,600
What are you talking about?

539
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,500
I know about... the big "o."

540
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,000
Oh, dear. He could tell?

541
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,600
I'm beyond mortified.

542
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:18,100
I understand your concern, But
i assure you it was only that one time.

543
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,700
It's never happened again.

544
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,700
And it never will,

545
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:24,500
because if you think I'm gonna let you
drag carlos off to europe, you're nuts.

546
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,600
I suppose i should be flattered

547
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,700
That a woman as young and beautiful
as you Should see me as a threat.

548
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,700
But it would be a shame
to let it end a friendship

549
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,000
That's come to mean so much to me.

550
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,900
Maybe a little too much.

551
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,900
Mrs. Solis, my husband's gone.
I'm estranged from my family.

552
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,100
If you live with loneliness long enough,

553
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:47,700
It becomes an ache inside you--
An actual physical pain.

554
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,400
I thought i'd live with that pain
the rest of my life.

555
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,300
Then your husband healed me.

556
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,900
Can you blame me for being grateful?

557
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,800
No, but i just think we should end things
Before they get any weirder.

558
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,100
Carlos tells me
you used to be a fashion model.

559
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,700
I've always had a passion for clothes.

560
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,000
The reason i'm going to europe

561
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,100
is To see the couture collections
in paris and milan.

562
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,300
Lucky you.

563
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,400
It's not so much fun going alone.

564
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:24,700
But if i had a knowledgeable
companion like you To be my guide...

565
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,800
In fact, you could
be my personal shopper.

566
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,900
That is, If you don't mind
being paid in dresses.

567
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,500
Gosh, that's a...

568
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,900
A hell of a sweet offer,

569
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,100
But i've...

570
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,500
got the girls, and, um...

571
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,000
We'll bring them along.

572
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:48,200
Think what fun we'll have
dressing them up.

573
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,900
What the hell? You're never
too young to see paris, right?

574
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,200
I'm so glad!

575
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,800
I can see we're
going to be great friends.

576
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,600
Carlos! I'm done with my call.

577
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,300
Hello!

578
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,700
Hey, hon. Check this out.

579
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,700
If it's the cat eating spaghetti,
I've already seen it.

580
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,300
It's our band logo.

581
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,100
We're thinking of
getting t-Shirts made up.

582
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,900
"Blue odyssey"?
Who came up with that?

583
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,300
This was the name of my brother's band
When he was in high school.

584
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,000
You have a brother?

585
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,800
<i>Had. He died.</i>

586
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,200
Well, you never told me about him.

587
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,600
What happened?

588
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,500
His name was steve.

589
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,000
He was a great guy...

590
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,000
Just kinda got caught up in drugs
and couldn't get out.

591
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,600
He went to prison,
and when he was there,

592
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,500
He was killed...

593
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
by another inmate.

594
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,900
And what happened to the guy
who killed him?

595
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,500
Oh, the court ruled it self-Defense,

596
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,900
So the guy finished his time,
and he got out.

597
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,300
I can't believe
you've never told me about him.

598
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,900
I mean, it might help you
to talk about stuff like that.

599
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,700
I have my own way of dealing with it.

600
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,300
Oh, sorry i'm late.

601
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,400
<i>That rehearsal was awesome.</i>

602
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:41,600
They're letting me sing lead vocal
On "hotel california."

603
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,400
Oh, that's nice.

604
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,100
Hey, was there a blue convertible
Parked in front of katherine's?

605
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,800
Yes, there was. Nice one.

606
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,600
My god, he's still there.

607
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,500
Who's still there?

608
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,600
Well, katherine's been lonely,
so i set her up with a client,

609
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,400
And he's been there
for over four hours,

610
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,200
So you know it's going well!

611
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,200
Good for you!
My clever little matchmaker.

612
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,400
Well, you deserve some credit, too.

613
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,400
I mean, you brought us
peter's business.

614
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,700
Peter?

615
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,000
Peter hickey?

616
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,200
Yes.

617
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,600
You set him up with katherine?

618
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,000
Is that bad?

619
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,300
Potentially.

620
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,900
Is he gay?

621
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,100
I knew he had too much product
in his hair.

622
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:20,100
No, it's just that when
i booked the anniversary party,

623
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,200
I didn't want you
to be uncomfortable around peter,

624
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,600
So i said we'd met in college,
which is not actually the case.

625
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,100
Well, where did you meet?

626
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,300
Prison.

627
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,600
Peter's a felon?

628
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,600
But he's so refined, so handsome.

629
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,200
Two qualities that did not
serve him well behind bars.

630
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,000
My god, orson.
What kind of criminal is he?

631
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,300
- A killer or a rapist?
- Oh, no, no, no, nothing like that.

632
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,800
They got him for organ trafficking.

633
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,800
What?!

634
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,900
He was a surgeon,

635
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,100
and it seems That when
the opportunity presented itself,

636
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:52,800
He'd harvest the odd liver or kidney
From a deceased patient

637
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,700
And then sell it on the black market.

638
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,300
Are you telling me

639
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:58,000
That i set katherine up
with a convicted graverobber?!

640
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,700
Well, you said yourself,
Women over 40 can only be so choosy.

641
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,300
That is not funny!

642
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,200
I have to go warn katherine.

643
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,500
- Hello?
- Katherine, hi!

644
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,600
Is everything all right over there?

645
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,500
Yes, everything's fine.

646
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,000
Then why are you whispering?

647
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,400
Peter just fell asleep.
I don't want to wake him.

648
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,000
Oh, my god.

649
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,800
You slept with him?

650
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,500
You can wag that finger all you like.

651
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,800
I've got just six words for you,
bree hodge...

652
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,600
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

653
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:44,000
i just really wish
you'd taken things more slowly.

654
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:47,500
Bree, you have given me
the most magical night i've had

655
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,900
Since i don't know when.

656
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Are you gonna
make me feel bad about it now?

657
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,200
No, i'm not.

658
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,600
He is just so wonderful.

659
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,800
I tell you, if i'm not careful,
this guy could steal my heart.

660
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,400
Well, if he tries,
just promise you'll call.

661
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,500
Sorry i'm late.

662
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,100
I was sleeping so soundly.

663
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,100
Peter didn't want to wake me.

664
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,000
What's this?

665
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,800
A cosmopolitan.

666
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,600
That's your favorite, isn't it?

667
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,900
It's 10:00 a.M. I don't want a drink.

668
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,100
You will.

669
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,700
But...

670
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,400
these homeless people
whose kidneys he bought--

671
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,800
He at least paid them well, right?

672
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:41,400
Oh, i am so, so sorry.

673
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,400
Oh, it's not your fault.
You didn't know.

674
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,900
I have no one but myself to blame.

675
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
That's it. I'm going to maryland.

676
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,700
You can't just move
because of one bad date.

677
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,100
You don't get it.

678
00:35:55,700 --> 00:36:00,000
When we started this,
you were just as lonely as i was--

679
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:03,000
Orson in jail, benjy gone.

680
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,600
And i felt bad for you,

681
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,400
But, boy, was it nice
to have somebody in the same boat.

682
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:11,100
And then orson got out,
and now he's here all the time.

683
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,300
And i feel like you're this...

684
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,500
Fun, happy power couple,

685
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:21,500
And i'm just this needy, pathetic idiot...

686
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:27,400
Who hops into bed With the
first pancreas thief who kisses her.

687
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,200
I should be with family.

688
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,200
And i'm not family?

689
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Katherine, all my life, i wanted a sister.

690
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,600
And now i feel like i finally have one.

691
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:52,300
But we're always fighting
and competing with each other.

692
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,600
Well, what could be more
sisterly than that?

693
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,800
I know i'm not the most...

694
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,500
Demonstrative person,

695
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,900
but i care about you deeply,

696
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:10,500
And if you were to just walk
out of my life, I would be very...

697
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,700
Very unhappy.

698
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,800
Well, i wouldn't want that.

699
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,800
Good.

700
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,200
Well, now that that's settled...

701
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,400
- Let's make some pies.
- Okay.

702
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,100
Can i have another cosmo?

703
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,100
No.

704
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,500
Hey, is porter still at kirby's?

705
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:42,600
Yeah.

706
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,900
What's wrong with you?
You've been antsy all night.

707
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,600
Nothing. No, i'm fine. I'm fine.

708
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,200
Okay, i know what it is.

709
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,400
I have had this nagging feeling
that i've forgotten something,

710
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,300
And then i just realized I think i left
the freezer door at scavo's open.

711
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,400
- You sure?
- No.

712
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,700
That's why it's gonna drive me crazy.

713
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,200
I better go down there and check.

714
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:07,800
Okay.

715
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,000
Hurry back.

716
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,300
I'm so glad
you were able to get away.

717
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,500
I didn't think you'd make it.

718
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:26,800
Yeah.

719
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,900
I'm glad my parents still think
i'm young enough for sleepovers.

720
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,500
Crap! It's my dad!

721
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,700
Dad, hi. I was just--I was just...

722
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,000
I know what you were "just."

723
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,600
When i found this, i thought,

724
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,600
Oh, great! One of the guys
in the band is having an affair.

725
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,800
And then it hit me--

726
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,500
Porter has a key.

727
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,200
Where is she?

728
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,200
♪♪

729
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:07,900
Dad.

730
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:09,400
Don't.

731
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,200
She isn't wearing anything, all right?

732
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,200
Who is she?

733
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,700
Just some girl from english class.
You--You don't know her.

734
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,900
I'm gonna go in the bathroom.

735
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,900
You got 60 seconds
to get her out of here.

736
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,100
Hey, mike.

737
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,900
Look at you all dressed up.

738
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:53,200
Oh, i was, um, kind of on a date.

739
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,400
How did it go?

740
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,100
Pretty bad.

741
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,400
Basically, she just grilled me
all through dinner--

742
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,600
What do i think about this?
What would i do if that?

743
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,400
I barely even know her.

744
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,400
I felt like
i was on trial for my life.

745
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,900
Oh, i'm sorry.

746
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,400
I just wanted somebody nice
to have a cup of coffee with.

747
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,400
I guess that's too much to ask.

748
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,400
Well, it's kinda late for coffee, but...

749
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,600
I do have lemonade.

750
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,300
I'd settle for lemonade.

751
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,700
Hey, you know,

752
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:33,200
I know it seems like
i am being hard on you,

753
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,000
But like i told you before,

754
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:39,000
I don't think That
you're emotionally ready for sex.

755
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,900
I know. You said.

756
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,400
Just making sure you heard me.

757
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Now go to bed.

758
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,500
It's late.

759
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,600
Want me to, uh,

760
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,700
Put the car cover on for you first?

761
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,200
Sure. Thanks.

762
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:15,600
You shouldn't be here.
Someone might recognize your car.

763
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,200
Is everything okay?

764
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,900
Yeah. My dad doesn't suspect anything.

765
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,700
I'm sorry if i got you in any trouble.

766
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,300
It's okay.

767
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,200
You're worth it.

768
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:31,400
<i>There are dangerous women
in this world.</i>

769
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,700
<i>Some are lovers,</i>

770
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:37,000
<i>Blind to the consequences
of their actions.</i>

771
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:44,900
<i>Some are wives enraged by
the betrayal Of those they trusted.</i>

772
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,600
<i>Others are predators,</i>

773
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:55,600
<i>Deviously setting traps
to get what they want.</i>

774
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:04,800
<i>If you're unlucky enough to come upon
One of these dangerous creatures,</i>

775
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,200
<i>The safest thing to do...</i>

776
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,900
I pulled those records you asked for.

777
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,800
Looks like your mr. Williams
is keeping a little secret.

778
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,100
<i>Is run the other way.</i>
