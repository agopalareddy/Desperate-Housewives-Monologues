1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:03,200
Previously on...

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:04,100
do you do weddings?

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:05,870
Oh, my goodness. Are you two...

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,530
yes. Yes, we're getting married.

5
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:08,370
Oh, my god! Congratulations.

6
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,470
Those in love made the
next step... or tried to.

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,950
I need more from you.

8
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,430
- gaby, I can see them.
- That's wonderful!

9
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,010
Eyes were opened in
more ways than one...

10
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,330
the key is this doctor guy.

11
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:23,320
Maybe we should just bite
the bullet and go to boston.

12
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,560
You break up my family.
You burn down my business.

13
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:26,970
I didn't burn down your club.

14
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:28,590
And a thre was made.

15
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:34,050
Someday, you'll be walking home from
school, and you'll just disappear. Poof!

16
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:43,750
there are important events in
the history of every famY...

17
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,920
joyous births...

18
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,300
tragic deaths...

19
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,650
sublime weddings.

20
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:59,530
But the one event every family dreads
is the moment when they finally meet...

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,480
the in-laws.

22
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,690
Mom, this is alex's mom melina cominis.

23
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,020
It's a pleasure to meet you.

24
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,940
Likewise, and thanks again
for letting me stay here.

25
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,580
I just can't afford a motel right now.

26
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,140
oh, alex mentioned that you
were laid f from your job.

27
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,460
I'm so sorry.

28
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:18,190
Oh, that's okay. You know what
they say-- in a bad economy,

29
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,580
the mature cocktail
waitress is the first to go.

30
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,910
Real? They say that?

31
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,480
Mom, we're gonna go get your luggage.
That way, you two can get acqunted.

32
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,940
Thank you again for making the
long drive down from oakdale.

33
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,840
It's high time our
families got together.

34
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,970
Absolutely.

35
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:41,000
Now speaking of family
get-togethers, that reminds me--

36
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,900
I call christmas.

37
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:44,580
What?

38
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:48,850
Now that the boys are getting hitched,
we're gonna ha to split the holidays, so...

39
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,940
I call christmas.

40
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,480
Wait, wait, wait. This is not how
we decide family get-togethers.

41
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,270
What's the problem? I'm
letting you have thanksgiving.

42
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,920
I'm a caterer. I oversee
events on thanksgiving.

43
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,450
It's the one holiday that I don't need.

44
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,030
Great. I call thanksgiving.

45
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,430
Stop that! You can't call
all the major holidays.

46
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,530
No one's called easter
yet. Going once...

47
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:11,440
- I am not bidding on time with my son.
- Going twice...

48
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,640
melina, this is childish!

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,650
- My hand's going up.
- Fine! I call easter.

50
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,550
That wasn't so hard, was it?

51
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:24,640
Look, I know it's very difficult for
two families to negotiate the holidays,

52
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,710
but I fe strongly that this is
not the best way to handle it,

53
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,750
and I'm sure that the
boys would agree with me.

54
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:38,030
I called christmas fair and square,
and I wanna spend it with my son.

55
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:41,190
So if you go to the boys
and try and screw me over,

56
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:45,950
I'll remember that for a
really long time. Got it?

57
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:51,570
Yes, there are important events
in the history of every family.

58
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,340
Meeting the in-laws is one.

59
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:57,790
Look at you two. Have I told you
how great you look together? Have I?

60
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,680
The moment you decide
to hate them is another.

64
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,210
There's a home for everyone in suburbia,

65
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:23,660
and a realtor eager to find
you exactly what you want.

66
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:27,240
Whether it's something warm and cozy...

67
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,970
or something dignified and elegant...

68
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,990
or perhaps something
affordable with a porch.

69
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,230
Yes, everyone wants a home
with a lovely exterior,

70
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:46,830
mostly so the neighbors will never
suspect the ugliness going on inside.

71
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,200
There you are!

72
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:54,840
I just got the listing
for the adams house.

73
00:03:54,870 --> 00:04:00,030
Ind I thk the best way to celebrate is
for my sexy husband to take me out dancing.

74
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,240
oh, babe. not tonight.

75
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,080
What's wrong? Are you sick?

76
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:09,280
No. No, uh... I'm good.

77
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,400
Really? 'Cause you look like hell.

78
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:17,270
I'm good, edie. I
just, uh... I-I just...

79
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,360
feel like staying in
tonight, that's all.

80
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:23,580
Ah, you're doing it again.

81
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,660
There is something upsetting you, and instead
of letting me help you, you're shutting me out.

82
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,470
I just don't like to
talk about my troubles.

83
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,690
and I don't like sitting at home
doing nothing when I feel like dancing.

84
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,000
Edie...

85
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:46,160
I am sorry you're unhappy.

86
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:49,250
There's something you
should know about me.

87
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:52,220
I don't stay unhappy for long.

88
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:00,450
hey, it's jackson, having
fun at the old alma mater.

89
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,620
We need to talk.

90
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,900
Only good news, I promise.

91
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,720
Did I mention miss you? Bye.

92
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,780
we moved here to get away from that.

93
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,710
i didn'T. I moved here for you.

94
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,210
I've got a deposition to prep for.

95
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,780
Well, then I will go
clubbing without you,

96
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,590
and I will be wearing my
"not coming home alone" jeans.

97
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,290
By "wearing," you mean "squeezing into"?

98
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,380
Damn you!

99
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:37,040
Miss anything? Need a juicy recap?

100
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,920
No. I'm good.

101
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:42,040
Boy, you just have to stick your
nose into other people's business.

102
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,500
I'm sorry. If you're
interested, I have dirt on bree.

103
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,560
Go on.

104
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,720
You're no better than I am.

105
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,270
- Nicely played, mayer.
- Thank you.

106
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,030
Can I go clubbing with you tonight?

107
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,320
Overplayed, mayer.

108
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,850
Oh, please! I'm bored.

109
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,600
Mike has M.J., Jackson's out of town, and
you're gonna need somebody to bitch about bob to.

110
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,410
You do realize I'm going to a gay club.

111
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,100
Yes, that's fine. Ys love me.

112
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,260
Name three.

113
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,010
You, bob, andrew.

114
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,570
Th's two.

115
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,220
- Come on.
- All right, all right!

116
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:22,720
Meet at my house at 9:00.

117
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:26,800
And you might wanna pile on the makeup.
Drag queens get their first drink free.

118
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,950
Okay, well, let's try something easier.

119
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:37,120
After you left mr. Schilling's
nightclub, where did you go first?

120
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,140
I don't recall.

121
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,690
Did you maybe drive somewhere?

122
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:51,520
okay, porter, when the D.A., O also has
this police report, asks you these questions,

123
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:55,960
and you suddenly "don't recall"
anything you said, that's bad.

124
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:59,930
Bob, you've been going at this for
over an hour. why don't we take a break?

125
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:05,180
Fine. Porter, go and chill. I need
to talk to your parents anyway.

126
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,770
- okay, what's going on here?
- Nothin'.

127
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,660
You know, porter's just nervous.

128
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,700
He was also nervous when I
first interviewed him in jail,

129
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,830
but he was still able to
keep his story straight.

130
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:22,290
- preston! Where's my cd player?
- what?

131
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,550
Parker saw you take it.

132
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:28,110
Mom, please tell preston
to stop taking my stuff.

133
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:31,320
Honey, that's porter.

134
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:34,070
No, it isn'T.

135
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:39,500
Right. Sorry.

136
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:46,140
You guys have something
you wanna tell me?

137
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,690
Gaby, you should've come.

138
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,480
You missed a beautiful walk in the park.

139
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:54,590
Mommy, look at what we found! A ladybug!

140
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,820
Neat!

141
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:59,800
Why don't you guys go
wash your hands for lunch?

142
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,840
Oh, look at her teeny black polka dots.

143
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,320
There's so many beautiful things I used
to take for granted before I lost my sight.

144
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:10,270
Yeah, pretty.

145
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,850
What? You're gonna be late for work.

146
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:18,920
- Yeah, about that... I should've told you before...
- what?

147
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:23,140
I don't want to give massages
anymore, so I quit the country club.

148
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,760
You quit? Why?

149
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:27,810
Okay, I know this is gonna sound bad...

150
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:31,250
when I was blind, I
never realized that...

151
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:35,510
naked people are gross, especially the
middle-aged slobs that belong to this country club.

152
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:39,130
Carlos, you don't just quit a job because
of a few moles and a little back fat.

153
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,500
But I can find other work.

154
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,840
Now that I have my vision
back, the world is my oyster.

155
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:48,510
In the meantime, I just wanna
spend a few days with my daughters

156
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:52,300
and smelling the roses,
soaking in nature.

157
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,920
Like that beautiful spider
right ther god's perfect design.

158
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,120
Isn't it amazing?

159
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:04,780
yeah, it sure is.

160
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:08,780
I'll get you the want ads.

161
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:12,970
what's all this?

162
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,550
Oh, andrew thought it would be nice
to have a formal dinner tomorrow night.

163
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,600
Well, if it's a formal dinner, why aren't
we using your grandmother's tablecloth?

164
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:22,400
For melina? She'd probably
blow her nose on it.

165
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:25,190
No, I will not let that
woman defile nana's lace.

166
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:29,790
I know melina isn't what
we hoped for, rely are.

167
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,670
Need I remind you of my mother?

168
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:37,020
Well, at least gloria had the good taste to have a
paralyzing stroke so we don't have to deal with her.

169
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:40,370
True. That was a merry christmas.

170
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:43,530
But melina appears to be
in tragically good health,

171
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:47,550
which means we've got quite a few
beer-drenched holidays ahead of us.

172
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,980
You have got to figure out
some way to be nice to her.

173
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:53,490
I don't know if I have it in
me. She's such a troglodyte.

174
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,620
Please.

175
00:09:54,670 --> 00:10:00,790
No one's better at plastering on a fake smile
and pretending to like someone than bree hodge.

176
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,300
You're sweet.

177
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:06,630
oh, all right. Get the lace tablecloth.

178
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,130
I will pretend to like this woman.

179
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,350
just like pretended to like nana.

180
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:19,590
Bob, we're so sorry. We meant
to tell you. We really did.

181
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,890
So where the hell is porter?

182
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:21,960
We don't know.

183
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:26,340
That's why we've been trying to get you to
postpone the hearing date until we could find him.

184
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:29,000
Oh, we have a much bigger
problem than the hearing date.

185
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:29,870
What do you mean?

186
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:33,750
Well, now that I'm aware of this, I
have a legalbligation to report it.

187
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:35,000
What? No, no,
no, you can't--

188
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,510
Now my hands are tied.

189
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:40,340
But if the judge finds out that porter's
gone, we have to forfeit the bail.

190
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,070
And since my genius wife used
our restaurant to post bond,

191
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,030
our only source of income will vanish.

192
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,800
I feel for you guys. I really do.

193
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:50,170
- But I'm not gettin disbarred over this.
- Bob...

194
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:54,310
please. We're desperate.

195
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,080
I'm not meeting with the
D.A. For another two days.

196
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:59,040
If you find porter by
then, I won't say anything.

197
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,950
thank you so much.We
are so sorry that we--

198
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,310
just find him.

199
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,530
Yeah, yeah. I'm comin'.

200
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,310
gabrielle solis?
Bradley scott. Remember?

201
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,610
Carlos and I did some business
back in his finance days.

202
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,960
Oh, right! How are you?

203
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:39,680
Good. Maria and i finally gomarried.
I started my own investment fund.

204
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:40,840
How about yourself?

205
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:44,050
Good, good. I don't know if you
heard-- carlos got his sight back.

206
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,760
Oh, my--my god.
I had no idea.

207
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,830
I know. Life is good.

208
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,190
now all we he to do is find him a job.

209
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,910
Well, your timing just
might be perfect here.

210
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,160
- Why? You need someone?
- As a matter of fac I dO.

211
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:56,840
Think he'd be interested?

212
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,860
I don't know. I-I
can't speak for carlos.

213
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:02,830
It's an upper-level position with lots of
perks and the salary's in the high six figures.

214
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:05,440
- I'm now speaking for carlos. He'll take it.
- Great.

215
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:08,240
I'd kill to have carlos on
my team. That man was a shark.

216
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,560
- Have him call me.
- Yeah.

217
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,340
so long, sucka.

218
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:26,300
Hello. Is dr. Heller in?

219
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,160
I'm sorry. He's not. Can I help you?

220
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:32,240
Not really. See, we ne to talk
to him about dave williams.

221
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,420
- Dave williams?
- Yeah. Dave is a patient of his.

222
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:38,940
I'm sure you know him-- blond hair,
ue eyes, creepier than all get-out.

223
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,310
I'm not in a position to confirm that.

224
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:44,260
And I don't think the doctor would
discuss his patients with you either.

225
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,670
Oh, he'll talk to us.

226
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:47,400
- Dave's been up to some pretty sick stuff...
- yeah.

227
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:52,220
And I-I'm bettin' dollars to doughnuts
dr. Heller would wanna know all about it.

228
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,360
So when does he get here?

229
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:55,990
I couldn't say.

230
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:59,250
We'll wait.

231
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,740
Is that a beer?

232
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,680
We're not in a position to confirm that.

233
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,000
your new shoes are pretty.

234
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:22,690
Aren't they? Daddy bought them for
mommy-- he doesn't know it yet--

235
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,720
because he has a wonderful new job.

236
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,840
He doesn't that yet either.

237
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,050
- good news!
- Me, too. Me first.

238
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,690
Remember bradley scott?

239
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,710
I ran into him today,
and he's giving you a job.

240
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,490
That'S... nice.

241
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,530
But that's what I wanted to tell you.

242
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:41,140
- I just got a job.
- fantastic!

243
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:43,020
Well, you didn't sign a
contract or anything, did you?

244
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,470
'Cause maybe we can get
them into a bidding war.

245
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,370
unlikely. It's at the counity center.

246
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,420
I'm gonna work with the blind.

247
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:53,890
Great.

248
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:57,220
And what's the signing bonus
for that--a cup of pencils?

249
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,350
I thought you were
gonna get a better job.

250
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,530
What happened to the
world being your oyster?

251
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,070
'S meaningful work.

252
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:05,170
Who cares? Bradley's offering perks.

253
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,220
What kind of perks is
this blind thing offering?

254
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,220
Hmm, let me think...

255
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:12,160
making the world a better
place, personal fulfillment.

256
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:14,750
Carlos, I've spent the last five
years working with the blind.

257
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,250
Trust me, it's not that fulfilling.

258
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:19,670
Look, when I lost my sight,
those people were there for me.

259
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,760
Ah, I just wanna give something back.

260
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:26,730
Not to mention... bradley scott?

261
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,290
Kind of an ass.

262
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,430
No way I'm working for that guy.

263
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:42,300
Hi, bradley, it's gaby solis.

264
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:45,370
I just talked to him,
and he's intrigued.

265
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:49,730
How would you like to come over
for dinner and seal the deal?

266
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,500
this is so fun! I
haven't been out in ages.

267
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:59,580
Tonight, I am
gonna...boogie-oogie-oogie

268
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,950
you really haven't been out in a while.

269
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,300
Go ahead. What do you want to drink?

270
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:05,580
Oh, I'll have what you're having.

271
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:08,120
Cirrhosis of the liver, coming right up.

272
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:13,160
hey, jackson. What?

273
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,790
Really?

274
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:23,430
Here you are.

275
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:25,620
yeah, just taking in the scenery.

276
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:30,900
You know, we actually have some very
comfortable patio furniture in the backyard...

277
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,170
along with a place to
put your recyclables.

278
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:36,880
No, I'm good here.

279
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,440
What have you two been up to?

280
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:42,280
Edie was shong us some houses.

281
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,130
I didn't know know you
two were house hunting.

282
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,390
Yes. We've got to get
out of that apartment.

283
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,010
Did edie show you the adams house?

284
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,990
She did, and it's fantastic.

285
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:53,290
And if we could figure out a way to
move it next to a toxic waste dump,

286
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,750
maybe we could afford it.

287
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,310
Holy moly, would you
look at these prices!

288
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,910
You know, for this kind of money, you could come
up to my town and get a 5-bedroom house on the lake.

289
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,030
I'm sure they could.

290
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,650
It's too bad your practice
is all the way down here.

291
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:16,280
It is now, but it's not like there
aren't sick people in oakdale.

292
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:20,970
Who, undoubtedly, already have doctors,
just like your patients in fairview have you.

293
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:27,110
Fine. Let them stay in
that teeny apartment.

294
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,260
Who cares if the other
doctors make fun of you?

295
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,260
You know, I think we
should talk about this.

296
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,740
You'd really like oakdale--
no traffic, fresh air.

297
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:43,390
Hey, I'm open. Maybe we can go up
there this weekend and look around.

298
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:48,190
what are you doing?

299
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,210
Just helping the boys
live the american dream.

300
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,720
I'll tell you what.

301
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:57,800
If the guymove up near me,
you can ha 'em for christmas.

302
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,480
I just wish there was some
way I could get back at bob.

303
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,080
I'm so sick of his smug attitude.

304
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,890
"I'm the provider. I
bring home the bacon."

305
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,470
Well, you know what? I contribute, too.

306
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,330
I handle the bills. I clean the house.

307
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:17,040
I thought you had a housekeeper.

308
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:20,050
Jeez, you're an ugly drunk.

309
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:24,270
Come on. It's a joke.
What's with the face?

310
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:28,000
I just... jackson called
earlier, and, um...

311
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:34,210
you know, he went to riverton to visit his
old art professor, and she offered him a job.

312
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,020
That's cool.

313
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:40,030
And he wants me to move there with him.

314
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:43,580
You gonna go?

315
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,110
Well... I wanna be with him, so...

316
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,680
I think I have to.

317
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,350
You're that serious about this guy?

318
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:56,130
Yeah. Sure. why not?

319
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,130
you sure you're not just
waiting for closing time?

320
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,230
What does that mean?

321
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,040
You know, 2:00 A.M., Bar's closing.

322
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:09,440
You haven't found the perfect guy, so
you settle for... something like that.

323
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,840
Oh, crap. Look away.
Look away. Look away.

324
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:16,060
Lee, that is not what I'm
doing. Is jackson perfect? No.

325
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:20,970
But I don't think there is such a thing, and
I have a history of sabotaging relationships.

326
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,450
no, I'm doing this. M moving.

327
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:28,490
Well, congratulations to you.

328
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,920
Scary guy's coming over.

329
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:38,040
I have to throw him off the scent. Do
you mind if I grab one of your boobs?

330
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:41,210
Knock yourself out.

331
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,750
Jazz!

332
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:37,590
Oh, my god! why didn't you wake me?

333
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,090
Bob is going to kill me.

334
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:42,840
But that was, uh, fun last night.

335
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:46,570
different, but fun. see ya.

336
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:55,520
*****In his english class,
the entire debate team.

337
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:58,400
Porter hasn't contacted any of them.

338
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:02,890
Well, hurry home. We gotta
decide what our next move .

339
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,180
All right. I love you. Bye.

340
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:18,500
- preston, why didn't you pick up when I called you?
- What?

341
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,580
I called you, like, five times.

342
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,810
- No, you didn'T.
- Yeah

343
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:25,350
see?You're not even on my callog.

344
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:33,000
hey, dude. Is mom still there?

345
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:37,180
Porter, it's mom. Where are you? Porter!

346
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:40,310
- you know where he is!
- I don'T. He won't tell me.

347
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,360
But you have been talking to
him. What the hell, preston?

348
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:45,060
- I want my phone back.
- Fine.

349
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,230
You know what you're
going to do with it?

350
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,720
You are going to call your
brother and tell him to come home.

351
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,330
He's not coming home.

352
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,070
Mr. Schilling threatened to kill him.

353
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,400
What? What?

354
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,420
That's why he ran away?

355
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,910
I thought he was
afraid of going to jail.

356
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,550
Well, I'm sure warren schilling
was just tryinto scare h.

357
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:03,510
It worked! Rter's terrified!

358
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,880
Okay, we'll get a--we'll
get a restraining order.

359
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,540
I don't think that's
gonna stop this guy.

360
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,610
I can handle warren schilling.

361
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,190
But if porter doesn't show up for
court, we're gonna lose our restaurant!

362
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:17,600
A guy threatens to kill your son,
and that's what you're worried about?

363
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:22,670
No, I'm not gonna let my brother risk
his life so you and dad can sell pizza.

364
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,360
how do you sleep with
someone and not remember?

365
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,770
I don't know. I was drunk.

366
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:34,380
Okay, let's skip to the
important part--who was it?

367
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,490
Just a friend.

368
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:43,020
Oh, gaby, do you think I did this subconsciously
just to sabotage my relationship with jackson?

369
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,310
It was tom scavo, wasn't it?

370
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,560
Will you stop guessing? Oh, god!

371
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:48,990
Why won't I just let myself be happy?

372
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:50,520
Was it lou?

373
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:53,110
My mechanic? Are you crazy?

374
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,250
Come on. You were with a
plumber and a housepainter.

375
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:59,050
I mean, let's face it-- you
like your service providers.

376
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:01,220
- susan, you home?
- Bob!

377
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:04,460
uh, what are you doing here?

378
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:07,270
Well... it's about lee.

379
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,130
He told me he took you out last night.

380
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:13,370
Yes. Uh, we had a very
nice, uneventful evening.

381
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:17,200
Why? what did he say?

382
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:23,250
'Cause he was pretty drunk, so he
was... probably making stuff up.

383
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:28,650
Well, he didn't come home. He
claims he spent the night here.

384
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,480
oh, my god.

385
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,270
Oh, hi, gaby. I didn't
know you were here.

386
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,440
Never mind her. She was just leaving.

387
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:37,810
No. I think I should
stay and clean this up.

388
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:41,450
It's A... huge mess.

389
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,670
Uh, bob... uh, lee did
stay here last night.

390
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,640
he slept on the couch...
in the guest room.

391
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:51,420
So you have nothing to worry about.

392
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:53,210
Oh, thank god.

393
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:57,030
I just had this awful feeling that
he spent the night with another man.

394
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:02,420
wolee uldn't do that. He loves you.

395
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:06,000
I know he does, but he's
got a few drinks in him,

396
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:09,280
he'll bang anything with
a pulse and facial hair.

397
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:23,270
You still haven't heard from him?

398
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,040
For the 17th time... no.

399
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:29,660
Where does she get off
having all that attitude?

400
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,830
She's young and pretty, and we're not.

401
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:33,930
She's not that pretty.

402
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,500
I can hear every word you're saying.

403
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:39,790
From all the way over
there? Boy, she is young.

404
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:43,540
look, I'm very tired, so
I'm going to break the rules.

405
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,420
Dr. Heller went on some sort of trip.

406
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,220
He should've been back a week
ago, and I don't know where he is.

407
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:51,080
Why didn't you tell us
that in the first place?

408
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:54,350
Because it's none of your business!

409
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,220
hello? Dr. Heller's office.

410
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:02,610
Uh, hey. It's david dash. Is he in?

411
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,950
Did you hear that? He should've
been back by now. Why isn't he back?

412
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,810
I'm sorry, mr. Dash.
Dr. Heller's out of town.

413
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:09,470
What are you saying?

414
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,570
You think dave has something to do
with heller being late from vacation?

415
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,250
Don't ask me why, but I got a
feeling there's a connection.

416
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,530
Well, can I still get
a prescription refilled?

417
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:22,070
Re. Dr. Lybrand's on call.

418
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,630
Could you see him tomorrow ound 2:00?

419
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:27,220
Actually, I've moved.

420
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,110
- You know what?
- What?

421
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,170
I'm done.

422
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,270
Meaning what?

423
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,780
I'm sure we can work it
out. What's your new adess?

424
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:38,680
What, you're just gonna abandon me?

425
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:41,180
I went on this wild goose
chase as far as I could.

426
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,190
Oh, don't--please don't go,
roberta. I need your help.

427
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,710
Then get somebody else. I'm tapped out.

428
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,680
Roberta, wait!

429
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:58,190
"Wisteria lane." What a lovely name.

430
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:05,390
bree, you sure there isn't
anything I can do to help?

431
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,770
I'm just standing here
with my thumb up my butt.

432
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:12,690
Uh, no help needed. Certainly
nothing that would ruire your thumb.

433
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:16,480
Uh, sorry we're late. We
got hung up at the realtors.

434
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:18,960
Actually, you're right on
time. We're just about to eat.

435
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:21,350
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

436
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:26,170
Excuse... excuse me,
melina. That's my chair.

437
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:29,420
I just wanted to sit next to the boys.

438
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:33,280
Well, did it occur to you I might
want to sit next to the boys?

439
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:36,870
Did it occur to you
that I already called it?

440
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:40,350
She did. She called it.

441
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,460
Why don't you sit re, bree?

442
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:48,380
guess who just called
the burnt lamb chop?

443
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:53,410
I just wanted to see the look on your
faces when you heard my good news.

444
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,940
Really? What is it?

445
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:58,800
Well, I told dr. Hardy
you're moving to oakdale.

446
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:02,040
Uh, thinking about it. They're
thinking about moving to oakdale.

447
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:04,300
Not after they hear this.

448
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:09,750
Anyway, he's retiring next month, and he thinks
you'd be perfect to take over his practice.

449
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,170
Are you serious?

450
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,860
Wow, this could be a
good opportunity for us.

451
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:18,890
Yes. A good opportunity for andrew
to commute ve hours to his job.

452
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,770
I don't know, alex. This is
all happening pretty fast.

453
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,600
But it's the only way we're
gonna be able to afford a house,

454
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:27,060
- and if we're gonna have kids...
- you're gonna have kids?

455
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:31,910
Oh, this is perfect! I can
look after them for you!

456
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:36,940
Let's toast to seal the
deal. Here's to oakdale.

457
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:47,470
I bought you the adams house!

458
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,140
- What?
- What?

459
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,610
What?

460
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:53,100
It was going to be a surprise,
you know, for your wedding.

461
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:58,350
Unfortunately, this whole silly oakdale
thing has forced me to show my hand.

462
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:01,750
Mom, that's too generous.

463
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,680
Yes, that's, uh... that's way too
generous. You shouldn't do that.

464
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:10,070
Oh, it's nothing you wouldn't do.

465
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:14,540
Bree, I don't know
what to say, except...

466
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:17,180
thank you so much.

467
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,350
- I really love you for this.
- Oh, and I love you, too.

468
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:26,230
Orson, dear, would you pour
melina another glass of wine?

469
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,210
- calling edie, are you?
- you know it.

470
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,990
hi, honey.

471
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:35,420
You remember bradley and his wife maria.

472
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,840
They dropped by for dinner.

473
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:39,650
How fun.

474
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:43,120
Can I ask you something
about the trash cans?

475
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:46,510
Excuse me.

476
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,560
what is that miserable S.O.B.Doing here?

477
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:53,530
I already took the job
at the community center.

478
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:56,260
I know. Just listen to
what bradley has to say,

479
00:27:56,270 --> 00:28:02,140
and if at the end of the evening you're still
not interested, I support you completely. Deal?

480
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,320
If it'll get you off my back... deal.

481
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:13,200
After I got concessions from the union,
I laid off a third of the workforce,

482
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:14,930
outsourced another third.

483
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:17,900
A year later, I sold the company
for twice what I paid for it.

484
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,990
Impressive. Huh, carlos?

485
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,870
Very. It'll be a great story to
tell all the other C.E.O.S in hell.

486
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,700
- Carlos, be nice.
- No, it's fine.

487
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:30,000
Just taking care of my kids.

488
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:33,000
Yeah. I've got a picture
of them in my purse.

489
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:35,580
Wanna see how many you can name?

490
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,920
More wine, maria?

491
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:44,410
So, bradley, if carlos were to come work
for you, what would a typical week look like?

492
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:47,660
Oh, lots of high-end deal
making, uh, international travel.

493
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:51,040
oh, yeah. We travel all
over the world together.

494
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:55,430
It is so fun sitting
alone in a five-star hotel

495
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,580
while your husband is out crushing the
third world under the heel of his jackboot.

496
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:05,580
You hear that, carlos?
Five-star hotels.

497
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:10,980
Listen, bradley, really appreciate
the offer, but I told you--

498
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,570
I already have a job.

499
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,920
Why can't you do your work
with the deaf on the weekends?

500
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:18,080
First of all, because they're blind.

501
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,360
You tell him.

502
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:21,760
um, honey, bradley's right.

503
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:24,430
You could take this job and do
your charity work in your free time.

504
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,920
No, don't listen to her.

505
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:29,740
You are a good man, and you
are going to help people.

506
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,780
And even if you never
end up making a penny,

507
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:34,660
you'll be worth more than
this soulless bastard.

508
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:38,970
I work very hard to provide for you and
the kids, and I would like a little respect.

509
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,920
We, you know what i would like?

510
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:43,580
A big divorce.

511
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,670
so...

512
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,910
is eye care included in the health plan?

513
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:54,320
'Cause that's obviously
a big issue for carlos.

514
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,090
daddy misses you so much.

515
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:17,170
I'm so sorry. okay? Bye-bye!

516
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:21,970
I miss you two so
much. very soon, honey.

517
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:25,180
It's just a little teeny bit longer.

518
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:30,230
Oh, my little girl.
You look so beautiful.

519
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,630
I've missed you so much.
We're gonna be together soon.

520
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,330
I promise you. Just a teeny
little bit. It'll be fine.

521
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,770
Dave?

522
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:44,770
I'm sorry. You scared me.

523
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,640
Who were you talking to?

524
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:51,070
No one.

525
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:54,400
I heard you.

526
00:30:54,410 --> 00:31:00,640
Edie, please, j--
I'm not feeling well.

527
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,600
Who the hell were you talking to?

528
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:06,870
leave me alone.

529
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:21,430
why did you turn down here?

530
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:31,930
I thght we were going to the store.

531
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:39,430
mom, what is this place?

532
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:45,460
Before I became a mother,

533
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:50,850
I didn't know it was possible to love
another human being so completely,

534
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:55,340
and with that love comes
this need to protect you.

535
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:59,610
It wasn't a decisiit'S... pral.

536
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,930
It's just something in my D.N.A.

537
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:06,470
Whatever it is, it makes
me not care about myself,

538
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:11,440
and it reminds me that my
reason for being on this planet

539
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:14,990
is to look after you kids.

540
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,630
Why are you telling me this?

541
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:26,400
Yesterday, you said warren schilling
will kill porter if he gets the chance.

542
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:33,020
I will never let that happen.

543
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,550
Mom, where are we?

544
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,380
You see that bar?

545
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:43,810
Warren schilling goes there every night.

546
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:48,000
Tonight, when he leaves...

547
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:53,980
I'm gonna do what I have to,
to make sure my family is safe.

548
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:59,840
So...

549
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:07,310
I need you to get out now.

550
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,710
You can't be in the
car when this happens.

551
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:14,700
Are you serious?

552
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:19,230
You're gonna run him over?

553
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:23,330
Like I said, it's in my D.N.A.

554
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,760
that could be him.

555
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:32,780
Get out.

556
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:38,000
- Get out! Get out!
- Okay! Stop it! I get it!

557
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:41,800
I'll call porter and tell him he doesn't
have to worry about mr. Schilling.

558
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:47,650
And you will convince
him to come back home.

559
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,270
Shut the door.

560
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:14,060
so... remember how you said
I just had to hear bradley out,

561
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:16,980
and then whatever I
decided, you'd support me?

562
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,280
Well, you may be surprised, but
I am ready to render my decision.

563
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,300
Let me lay it
out for you--

564
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:30,660
either I do something fulfilling where I
help other people and feel good out myself,

565
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:35,760
or I take a job I hate where I make a lot of
money, but it eats my life and crushes my soul.

566
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:40,100
Hang on. Before you do that,
let me lay it out for you.

567
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:46,380
Either you let your family continue to
sacrifice so you can feel good about yourself,

568
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:51,610
or you grow up and make real money

569
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:55,700
and look after us like we've been
looking after you for the past five years.

570
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:58,120
You know what these jobs are like, gaby.

571
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,640
I'd never be home.

572
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:02,390
And when I was, I'd
be tired or irritated.

573
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:04,010
It will take a toll on all of us.

574
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:07,270
It took a toll on us when we
couldn't pay the s bill, carlos.

575
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:11,650
It took a toll on us when juanita was sent
home from day care because the check bounced.

576
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:16,130
But I handled it, and now
it's your turn to handle it.

577
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:19,360
Gaby, please don't make me do this.

578
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:41,140
bradley? Hey, it's carlos.

579
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:46,600
Well, I've, uh, done some
thinking, and I actually...

580
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,610
I wa that job, if it's
still on the table.

581
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,540
yeah. I was surprised, too.

582
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:05,490
sounds great.

583
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,420
See you monday.

584
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,670
hey, susan. I just made tea. Come on in.

585
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,050
Lee, um...

586
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:25,570
well, there's just no
graceful way to ask this, so...

587
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:28,310
I'm just gonna say it straight out.

588
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,590
When you spent the
night, did we get it on?

589
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:40,990
ye gods, no. Are you insane?

590
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,430
So... nothing happened between us?

591
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,380
Hello? Gay! Listening
to opera in a kimono.

592
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:49,220
What more do you need to know?

593
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:51,030
oh, thank god.

594
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:54,880
You know, when I woke up next to you
yesterday, I just didn't know what to think.

595
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:56,670
But why would you think that?

596
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:57,860
'Cause you were mad at bob,

597
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:01,540
and I told you about how I
sometimes sabotage my relationships.

598
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:05,440
Well, u didn'T. Not this time, anyway.

599
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:07,930
Yay.

600
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:11,980
now I can move in with jackson
with a clear conscience.

601
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,630
- good. Good. -
Wait, so I just--

602
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:19,760
I have to ask.Why exactly are
you moving in with jackson?

603
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:23,300
Because... he loves me.

604
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,660
Do you love him?

605
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:29,320
I'm getting there.

606
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:33,960
Don't you think maybe you
should... wait until you've arrived?

607
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:39,150
Mike and I will never get
back together. I know that now.

608
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:43,800
And i really need to
move on with my life.

609
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,770
You know moving on doesn't
have to mean moving in.

610
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,460
Jackson has made it pretty clear that he
doesn't do good with long-distance relationships.

611
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:52,710
- I could lose him.
- So lose him.

612
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,450
I'm not good alone.
I ne a man in my life.

613
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:58,790
But why? We're so useless.

614
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,210
But you are fun to dance with.

615
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:10,840
I think you should tell
jackson you're not ready.

616
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:14,720
Anif he ends up leaving, then,
hell, i will dance with you.

617
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:18,130
At least until someone better
comes along. How does that sound?

618
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:23,770
If this is your attempt at
bedding me again, miss mayer,

619
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:27,070
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

620
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:38,970
mom really wants to talk to
you, just for five seconds.

621
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:41,860
Do it for me, okay?

622
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,160
- Sweetie, where are you?
- I don't want to tell you.

623
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:50,430
Porter... you have got to come home.
Everything will be fine. I promise.

624
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,970
How? Either warren schilling
kills me, or I end up in jail.

625
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:57,450
We can get a restraining
order to protect you,

626
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,410
and bob thinks there's a good
shot at getting the case dismissed.

627
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,540
You know, I've been reading
the fairview papers online.

628
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:03,970
Everybody thinks I did it.

629
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:05,930
There is not a shred
of evidence against you.

630
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:10,260
When people see that, they will
be on your side just like we are.

631
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:13,350
Sweetie, you have to trust me.

632
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:15,520
I do trust
you.It's just I--

633
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:17,590
don't fall for it, kiddo.

634
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:21,510
I trusted her once, and
look where it got me.

635
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:29,440
- Good morning.
- Is it?

636
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:32,440
I didn't get a lot of sleep.

637
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:36,800
Okay, about last night, I'm sorry.

638
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,720
Let me stop you right there.

639
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:42,340
I don't need an apology.
I need an explanation.

640
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:48,390
and... if you can't give me one...

641
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,510
I'm thinking we're finished.

642
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:54,460
Look, I'm just stressed out.

643
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:58,890
Stress doesn't make you talk
to people who aren't there.

644
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,250
What is going on?

645
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,110
Okay.

646
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:12,710
Before we met, I was
married to someone else.

647
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,940
But she died.

648
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:19,390
And last night she was...

649
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:22,120
sort of on my mind.

650
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:26,020
You were married before?

651
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:29,140
She's dead, edie. What does it matter?

652
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:32,190
Oh, it matters.

653
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:43,200
You have until tonight to
get your things together.

654
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:46,370
Then I want you out of my house.

655
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:55,990
Everyone needs a
lovely home in suburbia,

656
00:40:56,020 --> 00:41:02,150
mostly so the neighbors will never
suspect what's going on inside.

657
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:08,610
Behind these freshly painted
walls you will find...

658
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,950
parents wracked with guilt...

659
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:18,110
wives tired of struggling...

660
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:25,070
lovers who have been lied to...

661
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:35,230
yes, everybody needs a
lovely home in suburbia...

662
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:43,420
if for no other reason
than to have a place...

663
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:46,530
to come home to.

664
