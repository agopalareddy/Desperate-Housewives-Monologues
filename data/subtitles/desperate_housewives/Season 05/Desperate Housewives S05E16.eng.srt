1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
<i>Previously on...</i>

2
00:00:02,312 --> 00:00:03,312
<i>Dave got caught...</i>

3
00:00:04,017 --> 00:00:06,007
<i>...changing your name and
living near your family,</i>

4
00:00:06,018 --> 00:00:07,518
it's not healthy or safe.

5
00:00:08,219 --> 00:00:09,838
<i>Gaby got leverage.</i>

6
00:00:09,906 --> 00:00:11,863
I'm getting
that bonus after all.

7
00:00:11,932 --> 00:00:14,935
So, Brad, what sort of bonus
are we looking at?

8
00:00:15,004 --> 00:00:17,264
<i>Katherine dropped a bomb.
- Mike's moving in here.</i>

9
00:00:17,332 --> 00:00:19,491
<i>What?
- Tom called it quits.</i>

10
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,348
If we're gonna sell
this place,

11
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:24,186
We should probably know
exactly how much it's worth.

12
00:00:24,187 --> 00:00:25,702
<i>And Bree got honest...</i>

13
00:00:25,771 --> 00:00:28,571
You're paid based on your contribution.
- You're saying I'm worthless.

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,677
No, I'm just saying
you're worth... less.

15
00:00:31,745 --> 00:00:34,883
<i>Which resulted
in some strange behavior.</i>

16
00:00:41,433 --> 00:00:43,895
<i>Everyone who met Orson Hodge</i>

17
00:00:43,964 --> 00:00:47,743
<i>knew he believed
in being polite.</i>

18
00:00:47,812 --> 00:00:50,714
<i>He greeted his neighbors
each day with a sunny...</i>

19
00:00:50,782 --> 00:00:53,717
Good morning.

20
00:00:53,786 --> 00:00:56,621
<i>He opened doors for young women
with a gallant...</i>

21
00:00:56,688 --> 00:00:58,442
Allow me.

22
00:01:00,301 --> 00:01:03,032
<i>If he bumped into a stranger
on the street...</i>

23
00:01:03,033 --> 00:01:03,169
Oh!

24
00:01:03,237 --> 00:01:06,712
<i>He'd cheerfully say...
- I beg your pardon.</i>

25
00:01:06,781 --> 00:01:11,100
<i>And if one of his friends
was having a hard time,</i>

26
00:01:11,169 --> 00:01:14,780
<i>Orson was the first to say...
- You need some help there?</i>

27
00:01:14,848 --> 00:01:18,189
<i>Whether his friend
wanted his help or not.</i>

28
00:01:18,257 --> 00:01:19,640
Orson.

29
00:01:19,708 --> 00:01:21,936
What are you doing here?

30
00:01:22,003 --> 00:01:24,298
Well, I heard about
your going out of business sale,

31
00:01:24,366 --> 00:01:26,526
and I thought
you could use a hand.

32
00:01:26,594 --> 00:01:28,247
I'm good. Thanks.

33
00:01:30,679 --> 00:01:34,458
Oh!
Wow. This is charming.

34
00:01:34,526 --> 00:01:36,989
Oh, it's a salt shaker
my grandfather gave me.

35
00:01:37,058 --> 00:01:39,183
Used to display it
on the shelf.

36
00:01:39,252 --> 00:01:41,310
How much you want for it?

37
00:01:41,378 --> 00:01:42,829
It's not for sale.

38
00:01:42,897 --> 00:01:45,394
Everything in that box is
stuff I'm taking with me.

39
00:01:45,462 --> 00:01:46,845
Oh. Okay.

40
00:01:46,914 --> 00:01:48,803
Just trying to help out.

41
00:01:48,871 --> 00:01:51,503
Know it's a difficult day,

42
00:01:51,572 --> 00:01:53,495
And I think I, of all people,

43
00:01:53,563 --> 00:01:56,330
understand what it is
you're going through.

44
00:01:56,398 --> 00:01:58,895
Why you "of all people"?

45
00:01:58,964 --> 00:02:00,887
Well, I know what it's like

46
00:02:00,956 --> 00:02:03,013
to have your livelihood
suddenly vanish.

47
00:02:03,082 --> 00:02:05,005
Remember,
I used to be a dentist.

48
00:02:05,073 --> 00:02:07,165
Oh. Right.

49
00:02:07,234 --> 00:02:08,988
Right.

50
00:02:09,056 --> 00:02:14,253
<i>Of course, it's not
really the same, is it?</i>

51
00:02:14,322 --> 00:02:14,919
What's not?

52
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,067
My business started going
south because of a bad economy.

53
00:02:18,135 --> 00:02:20,092
It got worse when my son

54
00:02:20,161 --> 00:02:22,084
was accused of a crime
that he didn't commit,

55
00:02:22,152 --> 00:02:24,548
but you lost your license
because you went to prison

56
00:02:24,617 --> 00:02:27,551
<i>for a crime you did commit.</i>

57
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,016
Why are you being this way?

58
00:02:30,084 --> 00:02:32,783
Because what's happening
to me is unfair.

59
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:35,585
What happened to you was...
- Justice?

60
00:02:35,653 --> 00:02:37,611
Yeah, and to compare
my situation with yours,

61
00:02:37,678 --> 00:02:39,601
on a day like this,

62
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:42,606
well, I gotta tell you,
it's a little insulting.

63
00:02:42,675 --> 00:02:44,969
Then I apologize.

64
00:02:45,037 --> 00:02:47,466
My intention was
never to insult you.

65
00:02:47,535 --> 00:02:50,639
I wanted to support you
in your--in your hour of need.

66
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:54,116
Uh-huh. Um, vultures
are starting to arrive.

67
00:02:54,184 --> 00:02:56,479
I'll leave you to it, then.

68
00:02:59,315 --> 00:03:02,554
<i>Yes,
everyone who met Orson Hodge</i>

69
00:03:02,622 --> 00:03:05,929

70
00:03:05,998 --> 00:03:08,157
<i>What they didn't know is</i>

71
00:03:08,225 --> 00:03:10,621
<i>that he also believed</i>

72
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,287

<i>moved in

81
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:47,243
<i>But from the moment the first
invitation was delivered,</i>

82
00:03:47,312 --> 00:03:51,058
<i>her friends
began making assumptions</i>

83
00:03:51,126 --> 00:03:55,041
<i>about those
who had been invited...</i>

84
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:57,404
<i>and about those who hadn't.</i>

85
00:03:57,471 --> 00:04:00,407
I know it's late notice,
but I do hope

86
00:04:00,476 --> 00:04:03,783
you'll all be able to make it.
- Now does this really mean no gifts,

87
00:04:03,852 --> 00:04:06,213
or is it like
when Gaby says "no gifts"

88
00:04:06,281 --> 00:04:10,061
<i>And she means no cheap gifts?
- You know, Katherine, if you need any help,</i>

89
00:04:10,129 --> 00:04:12,795
I would be happy to make my fam--
- Shh!

90
00:04:12,863 --> 00:04:16,237
Hey, guys.
What are we talking about?

91
00:04:16,306 --> 00:04:19,040
The federal deficit.

92
00:04:19,107 --> 00:04:21,335
Whoo! That sucker's big!

93
00:04:22,821 --> 00:04:26,937
Actually, Susan, we were talking
about my hsewarming party.

94
00:04:27,006 --> 00:04:30,717
Oh, yeah. I'm so excited.
You got my R.S.V.P., right?

95
00:04:30,786 --> 00:04:33,553
Yes. I'm so glad you're coming.
Oh, um, by the way,

96
00:04:33,622 --> 00:04:36,962
can you bring your blue punch bowl?
- Absolutely. Anything else you need?

97
00:04:37,031 --> 00:04:39,562
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's happening here?

98
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:41,755
Why isn't hair being pulled?

99
00:04:41,824 --> 00:04:43,747
Why would we do that?

100
00:04:43,815 --> 00:04:46,582
Um, let's see.
She's shacking up with your ex?

101
00:04:46,651 --> 00:04:49,586
Something which, when I do it,
I get an angry mob

102
00:04:49,654 --> 00:04:52,658
on my front lawn.
- I mean, let's be honest, Susan.

103
00:04:52,727 --> 00:04:54,649
You weren't exactly
over the moon

104
00:04:54,717 --> 00:04:56,207
when you heard they
were gonna live together.

105
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,497
Well, yes, I was upset at first.

106
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:02,176
But, you know, Mike was gonna
be with someone eventually,

107
00:05:02,245 --> 00:05:05,045
and I consider myself lucky
that it was someone, who,

108
00:05:05,113 --> 00:05:08,555
after all is said and done,
has always been my true friend.

109
00:05:08,624 --> 00:05:10,952
Susan, that's very sweet.

110
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,268
And admirable.

111
00:05:12,337 --> 00:05:15,069
And abnormal.

112
00:05:15,138 --> 00:05:18,142
Hey, Gaby, remember when I was with Carlos?
- Shut it, bitch.

113
00:05:18,209 --> 00:05:21,213
<i>See? That's normal.</i>

114
00:05:29,011 --> 00:05:32,217
I'll give you...
$6,000 for it.

115
00:05:32,285 --> 00:05:34,478
What?
It's a $12,000 oven.

116
00:05:34,547 --> 00:05:36,503
There's a dent in the door.

117
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:39,170
Not a dent. A fist print.

118
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:41,667
My husband's been
a little frustrated lately.

119
00:05:41,736 --> 00:05:43,187
On the plus side,

120
00:05:43,254 --> 00:05:45,515
it matches the shoe print
on the dishwasher.

121
00:05:45,584 --> 00:05:47,743
$6,200--take it or leave it.

122
00:05:47,812 --> 00:05:50,240
Yi, Yi, Yi, Yi.

123
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:52,097
Fine. Congratulations.

124
00:05:52,165 --> 00:05:55,033
You just stole a pizza oven.

125
00:05:55,102 --> 00:05:58,139
Hey.
- Hey. I got $6,200 for the oven.

126
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:00,164
What?! That guy is
ripping us off.

127
00:06:00,233 --> 00:06:02,493
Yeah, well, putting
an "everything must go" sign

128
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:04,991
kind of eroded
our bargaining position.

129
00:06:05,059 --> 00:06:06,982
How are we doing
on the other stuff?

130
00:06:07,051 --> 00:06:09,007
Well, by the end of the day,

131
00:06:09,076 --> 00:06:11,336
we should be able
to pay off our creditors,

132
00:06:11,405 --> 00:06:14,341
give Bree back
the $20,000 that we owe her

133
00:06:14,409 --> 00:06:16,704
and have enough
to live on for...

134
00:06:16,772 --> 00:06:18,628
45 minutes.

135
00:06:18,695 --> 00:06:21,339
Forget I asked.
I don't want to talk about it now.

136
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:21,598
Ohh.

137
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:22,148
Just...

138
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:25,040
Look, I know this is
a crappy day for you,

139
00:06:25,109 --> 00:06:27,065
but we need to start thinking

140
00:06:27,134 --> 00:06:30,913
About what our plans are going to be.
- I told you, I'm gonna get a job.

141
00:06:30,982 --> 00:06:32,905
And that is so great.

142
00:06:32,974 --> 00:06:35,009
So when do you think that
great thing might happen?

143
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:35,909
<i>Lynette, don't.</i>

144
00:06:35,977 --> 00:06:38,945
It's taken everything I got
not to lose it right now.

145
00:06:38,946 --> 00:06:39,824
Sorry.

146
00:06:39,893 --> 00:06:41,816
You honestly think
you're gonna get $200

147
00:06:41,884 --> 00:06:44,077
for that cappuccino machine?
I'll give you $50.

148
00:06:44,146 --> 00:06:48,330
50 bucks?! Are you--
- You--ah. Hey.

149
00:06:48,365 --> 00:06:51,368
I think you better stop
with the bargain hunting

150
00:06:51,437 --> 00:06:53,360
unless you want your face

151
00:06:53,428 --> 00:06:56,094
to match the oven
and the dishwasher.

152
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,224
Hey, guys!

153
00:07:01,292 --> 00:07:03,215
What the hell
are they doing here?

154
00:07:03,284 --> 00:07:05,241
They had theater tickets,
and their sitter canceled.

155
00:07:05,309 --> 00:07:07,542
We're only gonna watch their
kids for a couple hours.

156
00:07:07,543 --> 00:07:08,245
Good idea, Gaby.

157
00:07:08,313 --> 00:07:10,574
We're helping the slimeball
cheat on his wife.

158
00:07:10,643 --> 00:07:12,700
Why not babysit for him, too?
- Shh. Hi!

159
00:07:12,769 --> 00:07:15,198
Oh, you guys are angels
for doing this.

160
00:07:15,267 --> 00:07:18,134
Well, what are friends for?
Speaking of which,

161
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:20,329
thanks for hooking Brad up
with his new girl.

162
00:07:20,397 --> 00:07:22,692
Uh, Shayla, right?

163
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:25,155
You know, that hairstylist
you recommended--

164
00:07:25,224 --> 00:07:27,586
Uh, I was at the mall
making an appointment,

165
00:07:27,654 --> 00:07:29,543
and Maria walked by.

166
00:07:29,612 --> 00:07:31,287
<i>Oh, that Shayla.</i>

167
00:07:31,288 --> 00:07:33,357
How many shaylas do
you know?

168
00:07:33,426 --> 00:07:35,113
Two. Two.

169
00:07:35,181 --> 00:07:37,104
There's, uh,
Shayla the hairstylist

170
00:07:37,173 --> 00:07:39,264
and then there's
this other Shayla I know

171
00:07:39,332 --> 00:07:42,167
who's a home-wrecking whore.

172
00:07:42,236 --> 00:07:45,171
Hey, Carlos. Uh, why don't you
take, uh, Maria and the kids

173
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,141
Inside and introduce them to the girls?
- Come on, guys.

174
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,997
Come on in.
- All right. Let's go.

175
00:07:52,665 --> 00:07:55,229
You're using me
as an alibi now?

176
00:07:55,298 --> 00:07:57,795
I paid you 30 grand.
I want my money's worth.

177
00:07:57,864 --> 00:08:00,934
And by the way, your tennis game
with Maria tomorrow--

178
00:08:01,003 --> 00:08:02,293
You need to move it to noon.

179
00:08:02,294 --> 00:08:04,275
Why? So you can go
get another "haircut"?

180
00:08:04,344 --> 00:08:06,773
Shayla's got
a couple hours off,

181
00:08:06,841 --> 00:08:09,744
and I want to spend 'em with her.
- Well, Bradley, we all want things.

182
00:08:09,811 --> 00:08:11,769
For instance,
I would like Carlos

183
00:08:11,837 --> 00:08:13,349
to have a week off next month.

184
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,515
Impossible.
It's our busiest time.

185
00:08:15,584 --> 00:08:19,127
Come on, Brad.
We don't want to be late.

186
00:08:19,195 --> 00:08:22,401
Oh, Gaby, we're still on
for tennis tomorrow, right?

187
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:23,413
4:00?

188
00:08:23,482 --> 00:08:27,464
4:00? Let me think. Uh...

189
00:08:27,532 --> 00:08:30,299
Um...

190
00:08:33,777 --> 00:08:37,354
Actually, noon would be better
for me, could you do noon?

191
00:08:37,422 --> 00:08:40,392
Oh, I was supposed
to have lunch with Brad.

192
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,842
Do you mind, sweetie?

193
00:08:41,911 --> 00:08:43,834
Well, I was really
looking forward to it,

194
00:08:43,903 --> 00:08:45,961
but, uh... go ahead.
You girls have fun.

195
00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:49,235
Listen to him.
Can you believe this guy?

196
00:08:49,303 --> 00:08:52,273
Nope.
He is not to be believed.

197
00:09:03,108 --> 00:09:05,031
My, what an interesting
coat hanger.

198
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,056
It's shaped like a sofa.

199
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,352
Please put it in the closet.

200
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,343
Sorry, darling.

201
00:09:17,926 --> 00:09:19,748
Orson?

202
00:09:19,816 --> 00:09:23,528
Why do you have a salt shaker
from Scavo's Pizzeria?

203
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:25,149
Oh.

204
00:09:25,217 --> 00:09:27,883
I stopped by to express
my sympathies with Tom,

205
00:09:27,951 --> 00:09:29,671
and I-I remember
l-looking at it,

206
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:33,216
and I-I guess I absentmindedly
put it in my pocket.

207
00:09:33,284 --> 00:09:35,376
Well, take it back now.
They're liquidating,

208
00:09:35,445 --> 00:09:37,469
And they're gonna need
every penny they can get.

209
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:38,548
Ma...

210
00:09:38,617 --> 00:09:40,573
I want to stay here
with you.

211
00:09:40,642 --> 00:09:43,274
Me no like-a the Scavos
so much-a.

212
00:09:44,861 --> 00:09:45,805
No?

213
00:09:45,874 --> 00:09:46,818
No.

214
00:09:46,887 --> 00:09:49,148
Oh. Very well.

215
00:09:49,215 --> 00:09:50,767
Though I'm not looking forward
to going down there again.

216
00:09:50,768 --> 00:09:51,368
Really?

217
00:09:51,389 --> 00:09:54,155
Yes. I only went down there
to commiserate,

218
00:09:54,224 --> 00:09:55,978
and he was very dismissive.

219
00:09:55,979 --> 00:09:57,733
Tom has a lot on his mind.
I'm sure he didn't mean it.

220
00:09:58,801 --> 00:10:02,345
You weren't there, Bree.
He was downright rude.

221
00:10:02,413 --> 00:10:05,450
You know, it would serve him
right if I kept this.

222
00:10:05,518 --> 00:10:06,935
Don't be ridiculous.

223
00:10:07,004 --> 00:10:09,635
Tom's rudeness does not
give you license to steal.

224
00:10:09,704 --> 00:10:11,155
Return it immediately.

225
00:10:11,222 --> 00:10:13,686
Ma, you--
you such a pretty girl.

226
00:10:13,754 --> 00:10:16,690
I wanna live-a here with you.
Mwah. Mwah.

227
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:18,142
Hmm?

228
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:24,251
Hey.

229
00:10:24,319 --> 00:10:26,309
Oh, great.
You found the punch bowl.

230
00:10:26,378 --> 00:10:28,200
Washed, cleaned, ready to go.

231
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:31,642
Sorry about the mess.
Mike's still unpacking.

232
00:10:31,711 --> 00:10:35,086
Hey, did you manage to keep that
antler chandelier out of here?

233
00:10:35,154 --> 00:10:37,077
Yeah. That went
right to the garage.

234
00:10:37,145 --> 00:10:39,102
The tough one
was the framed towel

235
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:41,161
with some football guy's sweat
on it.

236
00:10:41,229 --> 00:10:43,895
That "football guy" is
Peyton Manning.

237
00:10:43,964 --> 00:10:46,730
You would do well to learn that name.
- Ah.

238
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:50,174
Oh. Wow.

239
00:10:50,241 --> 00:10:52,570
Oh, now that I really love.

240
00:10:52,638 --> 00:10:55,134
I almost couldn't believe
he had something that nice.

241
00:10:55,203 --> 00:10:58,038
Thank you.
- For what?

242
00:10:58,107 --> 00:11:00,164
I painted it.
It was a gift for him.

243
00:11:00,266 --> 00:11:02,763
Really?

244
00:11:04,283 --> 00:11:07,455
You painted that.
He didn't mention it.

245
00:11:07,523 --> 00:11:11,269
Yeah. It was a little beach
we went to for our honeymoon.

246
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,273
Uh, I mean, you know how much
Mike loves the ocean.

247
00:11:14,342 --> 00:11:16,669
Yeah.

248
00:11:16,738 --> 00:11:20,214
Now I can see it every day.

249
00:11:20,283 --> 00:11:22,340
Anyway, um, can't wait
for the party.

250
00:11:22,409 --> 00:11:24,770
It's gonna be fun.

251
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:26,357
Yep.

252
00:11:37,302 --> 00:11:39,933
I'm sorry you have to go through
this. It must be so hard.

253
00:11:40,002 --> 00:11:42,937
The hard part was when my friend
tried  help me with a loan,

254
00:11:43,006 --> 00:11:45,266
and I thanked her
by becoming a lunatic

255
00:11:45,335 --> 00:11:46,785
and denting her car.

256
00:11:46,854 --> 00:11:48,811
Now that you brought it up,

257
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:51,275
Lynette, I've been feeling
just awful about the way

258
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:53,300
I took over your restaurant
and insulted you

259
00:11:53,368 --> 00:11:55,662
and...
what can I say?

260
00:11:55,731 --> 00:11:57,654
I think we have
the kind of friendship

261
00:11:57,723 --> 00:11:59,646
where you don't have
to say anything.

262
00:11:59,714 --> 00:12:02,480
Let's just hug and move on.

263
00:12:02,549 --> 00:12:05,316
Okay?

264
00:12:05,384 --> 00:12:09,535
Oh. How's Tom holding up?

265
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:11,290
He's doing great.

266
00:12:13,721 --> 00:12:15,104
Isn't it noon?

267
00:12:15,173 --> 00:12:17,197
Yeah. He's up early today.

268
00:12:19,493 --> 00:12:22,462
He just doesn't know
what he's doing next.

269
00:12:22,531 --> 00:12:24,454
Maybe I can help.

270
00:12:24,523 --> 00:12:27,458
My publisher is thinking about
doing his advertising in-house,

271
00:12:27,526 --> 00:12:29,686
and he's been looking
for someone.

272
00:12:29,755 --> 00:12:31,576
Seriously?
- Yeah.

273
00:12:31,644 --> 00:12:33,567
Oh, my God.
That would be great.

274
00:12:33,636 --> 00:12:36,471
And if he gets the job,
you can actually cash the check.

275
00:12:36,538 --> 00:12:37,989
I tell you what.

276
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:39,981
I will invite Bruce
over for dinner,

277
00:12:40,049 --> 00:12:42,006
you and Tom can join us,
and we'll turn it

278
00:12:42,074 --> 00:12:44,098
into a low pressure job interview.

279
00:12:44,099 --> 00:12:46,123
Thank you.
This will really cheer Tom up.

280
00:12:46,192 --> 00:12:49,263
Great. I'll call Bruce
this afternoon.

281
00:12:54,057 --> 00:12:57,735
Could you call him now?

282
00:13:00,706 --> 00:13:02,629
Hey, Mike.

283
00:13:02,697 --> 00:13:05,261
Oh, I'm looking forward to one
of your world-famous martinis.

284
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:07,928
So was Mrs. Mccluskey.
She got here early.

285
00:13:09,719 --> 00:13:10,286
Ah.

286
00:13:10,287 --> 00:13:12,654
Yeah, but don't panic. I
sent Edie out for more booze.

287
00:13:12,722 --> 00:13:15,827
Ah. So you sent the mouse
to buy the cheese. Well done.

288
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:17,447
Well, look who's here.

289
00:13:17,515 --> 00:13:19,978
Somebody owes me $20.
How about we let it ride?

290
00:13:20,047 --> 00:13:22,746
Double or nothing--McCluskey
slugs someone by 5:00.

291
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,480
Katherine and I told you guys
we were taking the high road.

292
00:13:25,549 --> 00:13:28,450
Why won't you believe us?
- Because I vividly remember yesterday,

293
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:30,442
and I wasn't born during it.

294
00:13:30,511 --> 00:13:31,960
Okay, you know what?

295
00:13:32,029 --> 00:13:34,931
Let me show you something
I think might change your mind.

296
00:13:34,999 --> 00:13:37,260
So Katherine has a picture
that I painted for Mike

297
00:13:37,329 --> 00:13:39,927
hanging over her mantelpiece.
- Does she know you painted it?

298
00:13:39,995 --> 00:13:42,829
Yes, and we talked all about it.
She loves it.

299
00:13:46,746 --> 00:13:48,702
You painted that?
Wow. You're good.

300
00:13:48,771 --> 00:13:52,280
What? Where the hell is it?
- Bye-bye, high road.

301
00:13:52,349 --> 00:13:54,136
What's with the puss?

302
00:13:54,205 --> 00:13:56,027
Katherine hung one of
Mike's paintings over the mantel

303
00:13:56,096 --> 00:13:58,997
till she found out
Susan painted it.

304
00:13:59,066 --> 00:14:00,015
Then she took it down.

305
00:14:00,016 --> 00:14:02,474
Ooh. Something tells me
this party's about to get good.

306
00:14:02,543 --> 00:14:04,567
You know, there could be

307
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:07,300
A perfectly innocent explanation.
- Hey, Kathy.

308
00:14:07,369 --> 00:14:10,474
What happened
to Susan's painting?

309
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:13,477
Oh! I am such a klutz.

310
00:14:13,546 --> 00:14:15,030
I was dusting yesterday,

311
00:14:15,099 --> 00:14:17,731
and, well, it just fell.

312
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:21,072
The glass shattered, and ugh.

313
00:14:21,141 --> 00:14:24,413
It took it to the framer.
It'll be back in a jiffy.

314
00:14:24,482 --> 00:14:25,628
Mm.

315
00:14:25,697 --> 00:14:27,383
Oh! Excuse me.

316
00:14:28,904 --> 00:14:32,008
See a peectly innocent...

317
00:14:32,076 --> 00:14:34,269
bald-faced lie.

318
00:14:34,338 --> 00:14:36,329
It is possible.

319
00:14:36,397 --> 00:14:38,387
I just drained
a pitcher of martinis.

320
00:14:38,456 --> 00:14:40,041
I'm not buying it.

321
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:42,067
Really, Susan,
there's not a woman in the world

322
00:14:42,135 --> 00:14:44,226
who doesn't know what
"I broke it dusting" means.

323
00:14:44,227 --> 00:14:45,104
That's how I got rid

324
00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:48,344
of Tom's last bottle
of "musk, the cologne for men."

325
00:14:48,413 --> 00:14:50,370
All right,
you guys think what you want.

326
00:14:50,438 --> 00:14:52,530
I'm gonna choose to believe her.

327
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,174
All right, so we have
whiskey and bourbon.

328
00:15:20,243 --> 00:15:22,166
What else does Mike want?

329
00:15:22,234 --> 00:15:24,191
Bup, bup, bup.
We need a system.

330
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:26,182
Let's start
over there in Scotland,

331
00:15:26,251 --> 00:15:28,718
Head over to Russia and work
our way around the globe.

332
00:15:29,255 --> 00:15:32,190
Wow. It's crowded in here.
- They're all buying lottery tickets.

333
00:15:32,259 --> 00:15:34,452
The jackpot's $100 million.

334
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,139
Look. There's a priest.

335
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:39,143
I knew that vow of poverty
was a crock.

336
00:15:42,756 --> 00:15:44,881
Hello!

337
00:15:46,435 --> 00:15:48,560
You remember me.

338
00:15:48,629 --> 00:15:50,148
Father Drance.

339
00:15:51,904 --> 00:15:54,805
I-I didn't know you'd moved back
to the area.

340
00:15:54,874 --> 00:15:58,349
Oh, I just remembered.
Mike wants vermouth.

341
00:15:58,417 --> 00:16:00,948
Can you grab that
before we forget?

342
00:16:01,017 --> 00:16:02,433
Sure.

343
00:16:02,502 --> 00:16:04,087
Right away.

344
00:16:05,607 --> 00:16:08,475
It's wonderful to see you
looking so well. I--

345
00:16:08,543 --> 00:16:10,567
Shut up.

346
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,201
I'm only gonna say this once.
I've moved on.

347
00:16:16,138 --> 00:16:18,061
I've remarried,
I have a new life,

348
00:16:18,129 --> 00:16:21,065
and that's the way
I want it to stay--new.

349
00:16:21,134 --> 00:16:23,225
Of course.

350
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,203
So, uh, what was that about?

351
00:16:32,272 --> 00:16:35,208
Oh. He said we sat together
once on an airplane.

352
00:16:35,277 --> 00:16:37,705
Apparently he's less memorable
than he thinks he is.

353
00:16:37,774 --> 00:16:40,034
Come on. Don't want
to miss the party.

354
00:16:48,093 --> 00:16:49,093
Fine

355
00:16:49,594 --> 00:16:52,158
Fine.

356
00:16:52,227 --> 00:16:54,656
Fine. I will do it,
but you owe me.

357
00:16:54,725 --> 00:16:56,749
I gotta go.

358
00:16:56,817 --> 00:16:58,943
Let me guess. Brad.

359
00:16:59,011 --> 00:17:00,801
Yes, he wants me to take
Maria shopping tomorrow.

360
00:17:00,802 --> 00:17:01,946
Yeah, so he can grab a quickie.

361
00:17:02,015 --> 00:17:03,938
You know,
this whole thing is disgusting.

362
00:17:04,007 --> 00:17:06,942
I can't take it anymore.
- I know. Just keep reminding yourself

363
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:09,305
that we're getting things
out of it, too.

364
00:17:09,373 --> 00:17:13,186
Things I don't want.
Things I haven't earned.

365
00:17:13,255 --> 00:17:15,211
No, I'm gonna tell Bradley
we're out.

366
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,203
What? You can't do that.

367
00:17:17,272 --> 00:17:20,680
You'll lose your job and all that money.
- I don't care about the money.

368
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,165
I do...

369
00:17:22,234 --> 00:17:25,473
And so does my personal shopper
and pilates instructor.

370
00:17:25,542 --> 00:17:28,544
Gaby, no.
We're doing the right thing.

371
00:17:28,613 --> 00:17:31,650
<i>Or we can...</i>

372
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:33,844
make someone else
do the right thing.

373
00:17:33,912 --> 00:17:36,172
Gaby, what does that mean?

374
00:17:36,241 --> 00:17:38,434
It means...

375
00:17:38,502 --> 00:17:40,460
tomorrow
I'm going to the mall

376
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:43,463
to get my hair cut by a slut.

377
00:17:43,532 --> 00:17:46,501
Mm.

378
00:17:51,329 --> 00:17:53,947
Hey. Uh, look at what I
found--  my beach painting.

379
00:17:54,434 --> 00:17:56,695
Oh, yeah.
Katherine told me it broke.

380
00:17:56,763 --> 00:17:58,213
Sorry about that.

381
00:17:58,282 --> 00:18:00,712
Yeah, that's
what she told me, too,

382
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:03,614
Only, uh, it didn't.

383
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:11,209
That's weird.
Why would she...

384
00:18:11,277 --> 00:18:12,828
I don't know.

385
00:18:12,897 --> 00:18:16,103
She seemed to love
the painting...

386
00:18:16,172 --> 00:18:19,748
until I told her
that I painted it.

387
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:23,123
Excuse me just a minute.

388
00:18:26,601 --> 00:18:29,232
I'm not making a big deal.

389
00:18:29,301 --> 00:18:32,237
I just want to know why you lied.
Mike, please, not now.

390
00:18:32,306 --> 00:18:35,511
We have a house full of guests.
- No, we'll talk about this now.

391
00:18:35,579 --> 00:18:38,110
What are you doing?
- Uh, nothing.

392
00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:40,405
Susan showed me
the painting.

393
00:18:40,474 --> 00:18:42,565
There's not a scratch on it.
She what?!

394
00:18:42,634 --> 00:18:44,253
You didn't.

395
00:18:44,321 --> 00:18:47,156
Susan!

396
00:18:53,063 --> 00:18:56,168
I hope you enjoyed that.
- I didn't.

397
00:19:00,928 --> 00:19:03,054
I didn't. Uh...

398
00:19:05,552 --> 00:19:08,387
So what are we thinking?

399
00:19:08,455 --> 00:19:11,019
Well, Shayla--
it is Shayla, right?

400
00:19:11,088 --> 00:19:12,370
Mm-hmm.

401
00:19:12,438 --> 00:19:14,733
I need a fresh look.
- Mm.

402
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,218
I've been going through

403
00:19:16,286 --> 00:19:18,311
some pretty intense
personal stuff lately.

404
00:19:18,378 --> 00:19:19,559
Oh. Really?

405
00:19:19,628 --> 00:19:22,799
Fine. I'll tell you.

406
00:19:22,868 --> 00:19:26,309
I have been having an affair
with a married man,

407
00:19:26,378 --> 00:19:28,369
and it's come to that point

408
00:19:28,438 --> 00:19:31,407
where I can't even look
at myself in the mirror.

409
00:19:31,475 --> 00:19:34,377
So I want a new style that says
I'm not a giant turd of sin.

410
00:19:34,445 --> 00:19:36,402
Well, it's not your fault

411
00:19:36,471 --> 00:19:39,440
that you fell in love with a married man.
- Yeah, that's what I thought at first,

412
00:19:39,508 --> 00:19:41,432
and then I realized
that's stupid.

413
00:19:41,499 --> 00:19:43,490
I mean, what about
his poor wife?

414
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:45,549
Well, maybe she doesn't
love him enough.

415
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:48,452
Oh, no. She does.
She loves him plenty.

416
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:51,253
So you want to take the bangs up
a little bit?

417
00:19:51,322 --> 00:19:53,684
And he has kids--
two adorable little kids.

418
00:19:53,753 --> 00:19:55,202
That's sad,

419
00:19:55,271 --> 00:19:58,207
but sometimes you just have
to look out for yourself.

420
00:19:58,275 --> 00:20:01,211
Well, maybe I am tired of being
that kind of selfish bitch.

421
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:03,202
Have you ever considered,
uh, highlights?

422
00:20:03,271 --> 00:20:05,194
Focus, Shayla!
We are talking about

423
00:20:05,263 --> 00:20:07,557
how I'm ruining
innocent people's lives.

424
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:11,100
Gaby, you seem like
a lovely, warm person.

425
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:12,653
Stop beating yourself up.

426
00:20:12,722 --> 00:20:15,555
Oh, for God sakes,
you bleached blonde twit.

427
00:20:15,624 --> 00:20:18,256
I'm not talking about me. I'm
talking about you and Bradley.

428
00:20:18,324 --> 00:20:21,733
What? What--what is this?
Who--who are you?

429
00:20:21,801 --> 00:20:23,724
I'm a friend of Maria's,
who, by the way,

430
00:20:23,793 --> 00:20:25,850
happens to be
a warm and lovely person.

431
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,315
Well, maybe she is,
but Brad doesn't love her.

432
00:20:28,383 --> 00:20:30,306
He says
he's gonna leave her.

433
00:20:30,374 --> 00:20:33,512
Oh, Shayla, he's lying.
She's pregnant.

434
00:20:33,581 --> 00:20:36,415
That's impossible. They haven't
had sex in over a year.

435
00:20:36,484 --> 00:20:38,103
Well, call the Vatican,

436
00:20:38,172 --> 00:20:41,107
'cause we're gonna need
a manger and some hay.

437
00:20:41,176 --> 00:20:44,516
Get out.
- I'm just trying to protect you here.

438
00:20:44,585 --> 00:20:47,317
I said get out now.

439
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:52,279
Okay, let's just take
a deep breath here--

440
00:20:52,348 --> 00:20:55,317
Let's not do anything
we're gonna regret.

441
00:20:55,386 --> 00:20:58,389
Now.

442
00:21:05,276 --> 00:21:09,359
This is why people should never
get their hair cut in a mall!

443
00:21:16,705 --> 00:21:19,606
Mwah. Ohh.
You couldn't shave?

444
00:21:21,329 --> 00:21:23,522
Come on, Tom.
You need to look nice.

445
00:21:23,589 --> 00:21:26,492
Bree's going to a lot of trouble
for this dinner.

446
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,023
What, is she debuting
a new salmon puff?

447
00:21:29,091 --> 00:21:31,116
Okay. I was going to wait

448
00:21:31,184 --> 00:21:33,613
to tell you this
when you were in a good mood,

449
00:21:33,682 --> 00:21:35,740
but I realize
that's not gonna happen,

450
00:21:35,808 --> 00:21:38,042
so Bree has a special guest
tonight, her publisher...

451
00:21:38,043 --> 00:21:38,373
- Mm-hmm.

452
00:21:38,442 --> 00:21:40,330
And as luck would have it,

453
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:42,963
he's looking to hire
a new marketing executive.

454
00:21:43,032 --> 00:21:44,955
Oh, my God. What are you--

455
00:21:45,023 --> 00:21:47,183
are you tricking me
into a job interview?

456
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:50,186
I'll find something, okay?
I just need some time.

457
00:21:50,255 --> 00:21:52,178
You're grieving. I get it.

458
00:21:52,247 --> 00:21:55,216
But this sounds like
a fantastic job.

459
00:21:55,285 --> 00:21:58,693
Please just hear the guy out
and make a nice...

460
00:21:58,761 --> 00:21:59,739
impression.

461
00:21:59,807 --> 00:22:02,000
Fine. I'll shave.

462
00:22:02,068 --> 00:22:04,464
And brush your teeth.
My eyes are watering.

463
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:06,726
Oh.

464
00:22:06,794 --> 00:22:09,493
And don't just wet
the toothbrush.

465
00:22:09,562 --> 00:22:12,498
I can tell.

466
00:22:17,257 --> 00:22:18,640
Bruce.
- Hello.

467
00:22:18,709 --> 00:22:20,632
Hi. Come on in.
- Hi.

468
00:22:20,701 --> 00:22:20,968
Hi.

469
00:22:20,969 --> 00:22:23,636
Thank you so much
for joining us tonight.

470
00:22:23,704 --> 00:22:25,256
May I take your coat?

471
00:22:25,325 --> 00:22:26,910
Sure.
Let me.

472
00:22:26,979 --> 00:22:29,576
Oh, wait. Let me get
my "brain" out of there.

473
00:22:29,645 --> 00:22:31,636
I never go anywhere
without this.

474
00:22:31,704 --> 00:22:33,661
That way, when I get
a bright idea--

475
00:22:33,729 --> 00:22:35,821
wham! Right into
the tape recorder.

476
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:38,555
Huh. Sounds like quite a handy gizmo.
- Thank you, Orville.

477
00:22:38,624 --> 00:22:40,074
It's Orson.

478
00:22:40,142 --> 00:22:43,213
Orville, Orson--either way,
he came home from the playground

479
00:22:43,281 --> 00:22:46,419
covered in bruises.
Am I right?

480
00:22:46,488 --> 00:22:47,904
Idea for children's book--

481
00:22:47,973 --> 00:22:50,065
kid who gets the crap
kicked out of him

482
00:22:50,134 --> 00:22:52,401
'cause he has a goofy name.
Could be "Orson."

483
00:22:53,137 --> 00:22:55,094
Oh, that's them.
Wait till you meet Tom.

484
00:22:55,163 --> 00:22:57,592
You'll be so glad
you had that tape recorder.

485
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:00,090
He's just bursting
with ideas.

486
00:23:00,158 --> 00:23:02,081
Hi.
- Lynette, Tom, hi.

487
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:02,717
Hey.

488
00:23:02,718 --> 00:23:05,085
I'd like you to meet
my publisher, Bruce.

489
00:23:05,154 --> 00:23:07,381
It's nice to meet you.

490
00:23:07,449 --> 00:23:11,026
Hey. Bree, I'm getting a beer,
if you don't mind.

491
00:23:15,111 --> 00:23:17,878
Hey, Katherine.

492
00:23:17,947 --> 00:23:19,903
Mike is standing
across the street

493
00:23:19,972 --> 00:23:21,895
watching to make sure
I apologize,

494
00:23:21,963 --> 00:23:24,898
even though it's clear to me
you're the one who should

495
00:23:24,967 --> 00:23:26,890
be apologizing for the way
you ruined my party.

496
00:23:26,959 --> 00:23:28,443
One, two, three.

497
00:23:28,511 --> 00:23:31,211
Well, that should
be long enough, so here.

498
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:33,471
Kiss my ass. Bye.

499
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,125
Hold on.

500
00:23:36,984 --> 00:23:39,176
I'm sorry.

501
00:23:39,245 --> 00:23:42,990
But neither of us exactly gets
a gold star for model behavior.

502
00:23:43,059 --> 00:23:44,644
It's not the same.

503
00:23:44,712 --> 00:23:47,446
Why not? I mean,
you loved that painting

504
00:23:47,514 --> 00:23:49,809
until you found out
that I did it,

505
00:23:49,877 --> 00:23:51,799
and then you acted
totally petty.

506
00:23:51,868 --> 00:23:54,365
So why am I
the only bad guy here?

507
00:23:59,733 --> 00:24:02,533
Let me ask you something,
okay?

508
00:24:02,602 --> 00:24:05,167
Didn't it give you
just the tiniest little thrill

509
00:24:05,234 --> 00:24:06,652
to tell me that

510
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,925
that painting that I was
so happy about was yours?

511
00:24:09,994 --> 00:24:12,119
That I had
something in my house

512
00:24:12,188 --> 00:24:14,617
that represented the love
between you and Mike?

513
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:16,372
No.

514
00:24:16,441 --> 00:24:19,275
Then what are you doing,
Susan?

515
00:24:19,344 --> 00:24:22,043
Can't you see
how hard this is for me?

516
00:24:22,112 --> 00:24:24,305
You live
right across the street.

517
00:24:24,373 --> 00:24:26,768
You guys share a kid.

518
00:24:26,837 --> 00:24:29,806
Do I have to have a painting
of your honeymoon, too?

519
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,992
Look, I knew
I wasn't going to get

520
00:24:34,061 --> 00:24:36,219
a clean slate with Mike,
okay?

521
00:24:36,288 --> 00:24:39,831
I just wanted
a clean mantelpiece.

522
00:24:49,924 --> 00:24:52,252
Oh.

523
00:24:52,321 --> 00:24:55,526
Fantastic dinner, Bree.
This was a great idea.

524
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:58,530
Well, I just wanted to get you
together with Tom here.

525
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:00,555
I thought you two
might hit it off.

526
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:04,335
Yeah. Tom, Bree says you used
to be quite the ad wiz.

527
00:25:04,404 --> 00:25:06,597
Oh, I don't know.

528
00:25:06,666 --> 00:25:09,770
He's being modest.
He was the best.

529
00:25:09,838 --> 00:25:11,322
Good, because I'm looking

530
00:25:11,391 --> 00:25:13,820
for someone to head up
a new division.

531
00:25:13,889 --> 00:25:16,014
I'm going to put
some coffee on.

532
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:18,883
Orson,
would you give me a hand?

533
00:25:18,952 --> 00:25:20,571
Let these three chat.

534
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:26,241
So do you think
you have any interest

535
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:28,369
in getting back
in the game?

536
00:25:28,437 --> 00:25:29,854
I don't know.

537
00:25:29,922 --> 00:25:32,385
The timing's a little weird.

538
00:25:32,454 --> 00:25:34,174
How so?

539
00:25:34,242 --> 00:25:35,659
I don't know.

540
00:25:35,727 --> 00:25:39,609
Well, Tom was just running
a very successful restaurant,

541
00:25:39,676 --> 00:25:42,376
and he just sold it
at a handsome profit.

542
00:25:42,444 --> 00:25:45,852
So he's waiting
for the right opportunity.

543
00:25:45,921 --> 00:25:49,430
You might have to do
a little selling here, Bruce.

544
00:25:49,499 --> 00:25:52,603
Huh. I guess the good ones are
always the hardest to land.

545
00:25:52,672 --> 00:25:53,684
Yeah

546
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:55,709
Let me give it a shot.

547
00:25:55,777 --> 00:25:57,565
We represent a small stable

548
00:25:57,633 --> 00:25:59,556
of elite nonfiction authors
from all over the world.

549
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:02,088
So you'd be working closely
with those writers

550
00:26:02,157 --> 00:26:03,606
to come up with

551
00:26:03,675 --> 00:26:05,767
creative approaches
to selling their books.

552
00:26:05,836 --> 00:26:08,906
That sounds... amazing.

553
00:26:08,975 --> 00:26:10,830
I don't know.

554
00:26:10,899 --> 00:26:12,484
Are there more potatoes?

555
00:26:12,552 --> 00:26:16,129
You can have mine.

556
00:26:16,198 --> 00:26:18,323
Stop saying,
"I don't know."

557
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:21,462
Mm.

558
00:26:21,531 --> 00:26:23,487
Sounds like
there's a lot of traveling.

559
00:26:23,556 --> 00:26:26,830
I'm not, you know, really big
on living out of a suitcase.

560
00:26:26,897 --> 00:26:29,226
Even to do two weeks
at the book fair in Paris.

561
00:26:29,294 --> 00:26:31,689
While you stay
at a five-star hotel?

562
00:26:31,758 --> 00:26:33,242
Paris?

563
00:26:33,311 --> 00:26:34,761
Like France?

564
00:26:34,829 --> 00:26:37,428
Yes, like the greatest city
in the world.

565
00:26:37,496 --> 00:26:40,229
Gee, I'm getting
Lynette excited.

566
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:43,132
<i>Too bad you don't have
any advertising experience.</i>

567
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,989
Oh.

568
00:26:48,533 --> 00:26:51,976
Actually, I have
12 years of experience.

569
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:53,630
Really?

570
00:26:53,697 --> 00:26:54,709
Yeah.

571
00:26:54,778 --> 00:26:57,140
I was account executive
for eight years,

572
00:26:57,209 --> 00:26:59,907
V.P. for four more after that,

573
00:26:59,976 --> 00:27:02,067
and by the way,
I wrote my graduate thesis

574
00:27:02,136 --> 00:27:05,410
on the rise
of the nonfiction novel.

575
00:27:05,477 --> 00:27:06,895
W-wow.

576
00:27:06,963 --> 00:27:10,539
I know. So what kind of starting
salary are we talking about?

577
00:27:10,608 --> 00:27:13,847
Lynette, can I see you for a sec?

578
00:27:13,916 --> 00:27:16,311
Okay. Bruce,
could you hold that thought?

579
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,248
I'm gonna be right back.

580
00:27:21,105 --> 00:27:23,197
Well,
we're on pins and needles.

581
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:26,066
How's it going?

582
00:27:26,135 --> 00:27:29,407
What the hell are you doing?
- I'm getting this job. That's what I'm doing.

583
00:27:29,476 --> 00:27:30,645
<i>I thought it was my job.</i>

584
00:27:30,646 --> 00:27:33,020
Well, you're not acting like
you want it very much, mister...

585
00:27:33,088 --> 00:27:35,349
"uh, I don't know.

586
00:27:35,417 --> 00:27:37,880
Are there any more potatoes?"
- It's not that I don't want it.

587
00:27:37,948 --> 00:27:40,310
It's just that
it's all happening so fast.

588
00:27:40,379 --> 00:27:44,192
I need a little time to lick my wounds.
- Okay, you lick. I'm going to Paris.

589
00:27:44,261 --> 00:27:46,926
You're not taking my job.

590
00:27:46,994 --> 00:27:49,424
<i>Your job? The one you're
magically gonna get by sulking</i>

591
00:27:49,493 --> 00:27:52,563
and acting like a brat?
You had a shot. You blew it.

592
00:27:52,632 --> 00:27:54,250
Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

593
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:58,335
You just messed with the bull,
sister.

594
00:27:58,403 --> 00:28:00,798
Prepare to get the horns.

595
00:28:02,386 --> 00:28:04,646
I... ugh!

596
00:28:04,715 --> 00:28:07,043
Maybe we should slice the tart
in here.

597
00:28:07,111 --> 00:28:10,013
I don't want to bring
a large knife into this.

598
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:18,758
Bruce...

599
00:28:18,827 --> 00:28:20,750
I was just saying to Lynette,

600
00:28:20,819 --> 00:28:23,754
I gave you my "I don't really
care about this job" thing

601
00:28:23,822 --> 00:28:26,116
to see if you really care
about this job,

602
00:28:26,185 --> 00:28:29,255
and you do, and I like that.

603
00:28:29,324 --> 00:28:31,078
Clever.

604
00:28:31,147 --> 00:28:33,205
Now we haven't talked
compensation package yet,

605
00:28:33,273 --> 00:28:35,230
but I got a good feeling--

606
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:38,234
You know, Tom, you're right.
Bruce does care about this job.

607
00:28:38,303 --> 00:28:40,596
That's why he wants
to make sure

608
00:28:40,665 --> 00:28:43,061
he gets the perfect person
for it.

609
00:28:43,129 --> 00:28:45,558
Well, Lynette, you yourself
said I was the best.

610
00:28:45,627 --> 00:28:49,305
Oh, you were. You were the best
person who ever worked for me.

611
00:28:49,374 --> 00:28:52,646
I used to be his boss.

612
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:57,709
This is not what I had in mind.
- I don't know

613
00:28:57,778 --> 00:29:00,361
why either one of them wants
to work for that jackass.

614
00:29:00,362 --> 00:29:02,098
Now, now.
He's been very good to me.

615
00:29:02,166 --> 00:29:04,089
Well, of course he has,

616
00:29:04,157 --> 00:29:06,115
because he knows
you make him a lot of money.

617
00:29:06,182 --> 00:29:09,085
Me, on the other hand, he sees
as an insignificant little man,

618
00:29:09,154 --> 00:29:10,603
barely worth mentioning

619
00:29:10,672 --> 00:29:15,127
as he talks into his annoying,
penis-shaped tape recorder.

620
00:29:15,195 --> 00:29:16,814
So I said to him,

621
00:29:16,883 --> 00:29:20,527
<i>"je crois que c'est l'homme
qui fait Les chez d'oeuvres."</i>

622
00:29:20,596 --> 00:29:23,092
<i>And he said to me,
"non, Lynette.</i>

623
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:26,771
<i>Ce sont Les chez d'oeuvres
qui font l'homme."</i>

624
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:30,214
Great story...
I assume.

625
00:29:30,283 --> 00:29:33,286
I don't speak another language,
but I've had ad campaigns

626
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:35,379
translated
into 12 different ones,

627
00:29:35,447 --> 00:29:37,910
including Professor Crispy's
potato chips.

628
00:29:37,979 --> 00:29:39,969
I love that campaign.
You did that?

629
00:29:40,037 --> 00:29:41,319
I did.

630
00:29:41,388 --> 00:29:44,155
Yes. Tom was very good
at his job,

631
00:29:44,223 --> 00:29:47,665
right up until he got fired.

632
00:29:47,734 --> 00:29:50,973
Well, actually,
I was relieved to get fired.

633
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:52,998
My boss was
kind of a ballbuster.

634
00:29:53,067 --> 00:29:55,766
Oops. She's right here.

635
00:29:55,834 --> 00:29:58,601
<i>Je regrette.</i>

636
00:30:01,774 --> 00:30:03,934
Oh. Would anyone care
for something sweet?

637
00:30:04,003 --> 00:30:06,027
<i>I know I would.</i>

638
00:30:13,993 --> 00:30:17,705
Well, we've all had our troubles
as bosses, haven't we, Tom?

639
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:19,730
I was sort of sugarcoating it

640
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:22,295
when I said his restaurant
was very successful.

641
00:30:22,364 --> 00:30:24,793
The truth is,
he mismanaged that pizza joint

642
00:30:24,862 --> 00:30:26,583
right into the ground.

643
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:29,654
Let me be very clear.

644
00:30:29,723 --> 00:30:31,747
I think
Lynette is fantastic.

645
00:30:31,816 --> 00:30:34,042
She is a great manager,

646
00:30:34,111 --> 00:30:36,033
She's got
terrific people skills

647
00:30:36,102 --> 00:30:37,755
and is very reliable...

648
00:30:37,823 --> 00:30:41,130
As long as the cancer
doesn't flare up again.

649
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:48,759
You know what?

650
00:30:48,826 --> 00:30:50,345
It's getting late.

651
00:30:50,414 --> 00:30:54,057
I should probably hit the road.

652
00:30:54,126 --> 00:30:56,758
But what about the job?

653
00:30:56,826 --> 00:30:58,243
Yeah...

654
00:30:58,311 --> 00:31:01,450
I just started looking. I'm sure
it's gonna be a long process,

655
00:31:01,518 --> 00:31:05,095
but trust me, you've certainly
made an impression.

656
00:31:07,222 --> 00:31:09,821
I'll get your coat.

657
00:31:11,577 --> 00:31:13,769
Oh, it's a shame
you can't stay for dessert.

658
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,322
I've made Tarte Tatin.

659
00:31:15,391 --> 00:31:17,584
Idea for novel--

660
00:31:17,653 --> 00:31:21,769
woman who's married to a gay man
and doesn't know it.

661
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,630
Well, thanks again.

662
00:31:28,049 --> 00:31:31,051
I don't know when I've had
such an interesting evening.

663
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,853
I'll call you tomorrow.
We'll talk about your friends.

664
00:31:36,622 --> 00:31:38,409
Uh, Bruce,

665
00:31:38,478 --> 00:31:41,867
why don't I wrap up a
piece of that tart to go?

666
00:31:41,868 --> 00:31:42,291
Yeah.

667
00:31:45,465 --> 00:31:47,388
Give it.

668
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:49,852
Give what?
- Bruce's tape recorder.

669
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,384
I don't know what--
- You took it. I saw you.

670
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:55,219
Hey. Has anybody seen
my tape recorder?

671
00:31:55,287 --> 00:31:58,189
It was right here.
- I'll look.

672
00:31:58,258 --> 00:32:00,417
Hey.

673
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:01,936
Ah.

674
00:32:02,004 --> 00:32:03,489
Stop.

675
00:32:03,557 --> 00:32:06,762
I don't have it.
- Ooh! What do you call this?

676
00:32:06,831 --> 00:32:09,192
Uh, Bruce is looking for, uh...

677
00:32:12,501 --> 00:32:15,032
Never mind.

678
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:18,914
We will talk
about this later.

679
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:26,103
Oh. Look what got brought in
with the dirty napkins.

680
00:32:26,172 --> 00:32:27,791
Thanks.

681
00:32:36,467 --> 00:32:39,638
Hello, Gaby.
- Ooh!

682
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:41,698
Jeez, Bradley, you scared me!

683
00:32:41,765 --> 00:32:45,309
You talked to Shayla.
- Yeah, she's a real gem.

684
00:32:45,378 --> 00:32:47,671
You shouldn't have done that.
We have a deal.

685
00:32:47,706 --> 00:32:49,663
Well, I'm tired of the deal,

686
00:32:49,732 --> 00:32:52,633
And what you're doing to Maria
is despicable.

687
00:32:52,702 --> 00:32:54,625
Hey. You're in no position
to judge me.

688
00:32:54,693 --> 00:32:58,000
Don't forget, I was working with
Carlos when you cheated on him.

689
00:32:58,068 --> 00:33:00,970
Yeah, well,
I'm not that person anymore.

690
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:02,455
I've changed.

691
00:33:02,524 --> 00:33:04,177
Right. You're worse.

692
00:33:04,246 --> 00:33:06,506
You're so worried about Maria

693
00:33:06,575 --> 00:33:08,768
until there's money
or vacation time at stake.

694
00:33:08,835 --> 00:33:11,299
Then you're only worried
about Gaby.

695
00:33:11,367 --> 00:33:13,627
You know what?
You're right.

696
00:33:13,696 --> 00:33:15,788
I'm out.

697
00:33:15,857 --> 00:33:17,982
What do you mean?
- Deal's over.

698
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:20,344
I'm not covering for your
stupid little fling anymore.

699
00:33:20,413 --> 00:33:22,336
It's not a fling.
I love her.

700
00:33:22,405 --> 00:33:25,306
She's the most incredible woman
I've ever met.

701
00:33:25,375 --> 00:33:27,298
Shayla?
She has a Hello Kitty tip jar.

702
00:33:27,367 --> 00:33:30,235
Well, she makes me happy.
I can't give her up.

703
00:33:30,303 --> 00:33:33,374
Well, at least be
man enough to tell Maria,

704
00:33:33,442 --> 00:33:35,702
because if you don't,
I will.

705
00:33:37,526 --> 00:33:38,977
All right, fine.

706
00:33:39,046 --> 00:33:40,732
I will tell Maria.

707
00:33:40,801 --> 00:33:42,825
And you can tell Carlos

708
00:33:42,893 --> 00:33:47,517
to bring a box to work on Monday
'cause he's fired.

709
00:33:58,656 --> 00:34:00,511
So dinner...

710
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,089
<i>Wow.</i>

711
00:34:04,157 --> 00:34:07,093
Lynette, I will regret
for the rest of my life

712
00:34:07,162 --> 00:34:08,612
what I said tonight.

713
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:11,312
I... I don't know
what's going on with me.

714
00:34:11,381 --> 00:34:13,709
I do, and it's okay.

715
00:34:13,777 --> 00:34:16,882
<i>Besides, did you hear
what came out of my mouth?</i>

716
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:19,312
<i>Like I said... wow.</i>

717
00:34:19,381 --> 00:34:22,451
Wouldn't you love to hear
what Bruce said

718
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,151
into his tape recorder
on the ride home?

719
00:34:26,638 --> 00:34:28,729
"Idea--
check local mental hospital

720
00:34:28,798 --> 00:34:30,484
for escaped married couple."

721
00:34:41,827 --> 00:34:43,581
So...

722
00:34:43,649 --> 00:34:47,361
were you serious about
wanting to go back to work?

723
00:34:51,277 --> 00:34:53,470
I was talking about
that job tonight

724
00:34:53,539 --> 00:34:55,833
and trying to convince Bruce
I was good,

725
00:34:55,901 --> 00:34:58,634
and I remembered something.
I am good.

726
00:34:58,703 --> 00:35:02,988
And I would like
another chance to prove it.

727
00:35:03,057 --> 00:35:05,824
Okay.

728
00:35:05,893 --> 00:35:07,950
Really?

729
00:35:08,019 --> 00:35:12,204
Yeah. We did my thing
for seven years.

730
00:35:12,272 --> 00:35:13,790
Now it's your turn.

731
00:35:15,478 --> 00:35:16,861
Oh! Mwah.

732
00:35:19,428 --> 00:35:22,194
Do you know how embarrassed
I would have been

733
00:35:22,263 --> 00:35:24,220
if Bruce
had seen you take it?

734
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,853
He deserved it.
He insulted me.

735
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,586
So say something.
Stand up to him. But stealing?

736
00:35:29,655 --> 00:35:32,557
Honestly, Orson, why would
you do something like that?

737
00:35:32,625 --> 00:35:35,290
I don't know, Bree.

738
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:38,295
I don't.
Here's something I do know--

739
00:35:38,364 --> 00:35:40,287
When I was
a successful dentist,

740
00:35:40,354 --> 00:35:43,628
no one spoke to me
the way they do now.

741
00:35:43,697 --> 00:35:46,193
When I lost my practice,
I lost people's respect.

742
00:35:46,262 --> 00:35:49,130
And you hope to earn it back
through larceny?

743
00:35:49,198 --> 00:35:51,121
You haven't walked
in my shoes.

744
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:54,395
Tom lost his job.
Everyone jumped to his rescue.

745
00:35:54,464 --> 00:35:56,150
Even you--

746
00:35:56,219 --> 00:35:59,120
bending over backwards
trying to get him a job.

747
00:35:59,189 --> 00:36:01,483
I don't need to walk
in your shoes, Orson.

748
00:36:01,552 --> 00:36:04,453
What you did was embarrassing
and childish,

749
00:36:04,522 --> 00:36:06,884
and it's never
gonna happen again.

750
00:36:06,952 --> 00:36:08,875
Understood?

751
00:36:43,845 --> 00:36:46,172
See you. Thank you.

752
00:36:46,241 --> 00:36:49,210
Father?
- Yes. Can I help you?

753
00:36:49,279 --> 00:36:52,215
Oh, I hope so.
I, uh, saw you the other night

754
00:36:52,283 --> 00:36:54,206
when you were
buying your lottery ticket.

755
00:36:54,274 --> 00:36:56,232
I was with my husband Dave.

756
00:36:56,299 --> 00:36:58,222
Ah.

757
00:36:58,291 --> 00:37:01,091
Yes. He said that
you barely know each other,

758
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,421
but it didn't seem that way
to me.

759
00:37:03,489 --> 00:37:05,750
And, well,

760
00:37:05,818 --> 00:37:09,091
he refuses to talk
about his past,

761
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,230
so if there is anything that
you could tell me about him--

762
00:37:12,299 --> 00:37:15,336
I'm not sure I can do that.

763
00:37:15,404 --> 00:37:18,474
<i>Please.
He has so many secrets,</i>

764
00:37:18,543 --> 00:37:20,601
and I don't have anyone else
to turn to.

765
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:24,179
I wish I could help you,
but...

766
00:37:24,248 --> 00:37:27,352
this is something you need
to discuss with your husband.

767
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,984
Well, if it was that easy,

768
00:37:30,053 --> 00:37:33,866
do you think that I would be here?
- I'm sorry.

769
00:37:33,935 --> 00:37:38,727
Please know that my thoughts
are with you both, Mrs. Dash.

770
00:37:38,795 --> 00:37:41,595
It's Williams.

771
00:37:41,664 --> 00:37:43,824
I'm too old-school
for my own good.

772
00:37:43,892 --> 00:37:47,536
I shouldn't just assume that
you took your husband's name.

773
00:37:47,605 --> 00:37:49,629
Anyway...

774
00:37:49,697 --> 00:37:52,599
Good luck, Mrs. Williams.

775
00:38:01,715 --> 00:38:04,650
Hey, Susan. I thought
I had M.J. till 7:00.

776
00:38:04,718 --> 00:38:07,587
Uh, you do. I am here
to take my painting back.

777
00:38:07,655 --> 00:38:09,881
But you gave it to me.
It's mine.

778
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:12,380
Well, now I'm ungiving it.
Try to keep up.

779
00:38:12,448 --> 00:38:15,890
Okay, if this is about what
happened at the housewarming...

780
00:38:15,958 --> 00:38:17,375
<i>It is, actually,</i>

781
00:38:17,444 --> 00:38:19,704
<i>because that is
when I decided</i>

782
00:38:19,773 --> 00:38:24,160
that I don't want this piece
of art that I slaved over

783
00:38:24,228 --> 00:38:26,455
hanging in the house
you are sharing

784
00:38:26,523 --> 00:38:28,514
<i>with your new girlfriend.
Capisce?</i>

785
00:38:28,582 --> 00:38:30,673
Okay, so the other night
you were mad

786
00:38:30,742 --> 00:38:33,678
because it wasn't hanging up,
but now you want to take it?

787
00:38:33,747 --> 00:38:36,682
Yep. I'm complicated like that.
Aren't you glad you divorced me?

788
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:39,956
If you two want a painting
so bad, paint your own.

789
00:38:40,025 --> 00:38:41,542
Susan--
- Mayfair.

790
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,850
Stay out of this.

791
00:38:47,855 --> 00:38:51,230
This is
between me and my ex.

792
00:38:51,298 --> 00:38:52,816
Got it?

793
00:39:09,964 --> 00:39:11,346
Unbelievable.

794
00:39:15,499 --> 00:39:18,401
Anyway, I'm thinking a brighter
color for the baby's room.

795
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:20,763
Now I know
it's a bit of a stretch,

796
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:23,329
But how do you feel
about turquoise?

797
00:39:26,638 --> 00:39:28,291
Sweetheart?

798
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:32,274
We need to talk.

799
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:52,154
What you reading?

800
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,281
The want ads.

801
00:39:54,349 --> 00:39:57,352
Can't decide if I should be
a data entry operator

802
00:39:57,421 --> 00:39:59,242
or join the Marines.

803
00:40:00,763 --> 00:40:02,179
I'm so sorry.

804
00:40:02,248 --> 00:40:05,183
Don't be. I told you, I hated
working for that jackass.

805
00:40:05,252 --> 00:40:08,188
You did the right thing.
I should have done it sooner.

806
00:40:08,255 --> 00:40:09,706
But you did it,

807
00:40:09,775 --> 00:40:12,710
Even though you knew you were
gonna lose a lot of money.

808
00:40:12,779 --> 00:40:15,714
You're a good person, babe.
I'm very proud of you.

809
00:40:15,783 --> 00:40:19,191
Well, that means a lot, coming
from a United States marine.

810
00:40:19,259 --> 00:40:22,938
Mm.

811
00:40:24,727 --> 00:40:26,414
Hello?

812
00:40:26,482 --> 00:40:28,473
Maria.

813
00:40:28,542 --> 00:40:29,857
Calm down.

814
00:40:29,926 --> 00:40:31,814
Calm down.

815
00:40:33,638 --> 00:40:36,203
Okay, we're coming over.

816
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:39,949
I guess Bradley told her.

817
00:40:45,249 --> 00:40:47,679
Thanks for coming.

818
00:40:47,747 --> 00:40:49,839
I didn't know who else
to call.

819
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,910
It was horrible.

820
00:40:52,979 --> 00:40:55,138
He just kept telling me
he loves her.

821
00:40:55,206 --> 00:40:57,771
She's the best thing
that ever happened to him.

822
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:01,281
He finally understands
what love means.

823
00:41:09,316 --> 00:41:12,048
I just wanted him
to stop talking.

824
00:41:21,703 --> 00:41:23,964
<i>You should never be
too impressed</i>

825
00:41:24,033 --> 00:41:26,664
<i>by people with good manners.</i>

826
00:41:26,732 --> 00:41:29,870
<i>They're the ones
who will give a friendly wave</i>

827
00:41:29,939 --> 00:41:33,178
<i>even when
they've stolen from you...</i>

828
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,174
<i>they're the type
to sweetly welcome you...</i>

829
00:41:38,242 --> 00:41:41,988
<i>even as they try to uncover
your secrets...</i>

830
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:50,291
<i>They're the kind
to offer you coffee,</i>

831
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:54,814
<i>even as they report you
to the police.</i>

832
00:41:57,954 --> 00:42:03,961
<i>And don't be too offended
by someone who's openly rude...</i>

833
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:06,628
<i>because they may be that way</i>

834
00:42:06,696 --> 00:42:10,341
<i>for the nicest of reasons.</i>

835
