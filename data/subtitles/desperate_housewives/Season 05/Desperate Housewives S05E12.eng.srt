1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,870
Previously on...

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,090
a call was made.

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:04,880
Sweetie, where are you?

4
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:05,940
I don't wanna tell you.

5
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,220
And if porter doesn't show up for
court, we're gonna lose our restaurant!

6
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,100
A guy threatens to kill your son,
and that's what you're worried about?

7
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:15,680
And as one love affair
blossomed, another...

8
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,660
you were married before?

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,580
She's dead.

10
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,070
I want you out of my house.

11
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,610
Withered on the vine.

12
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:25,050
Mike delfino has to pay
for taking you away from me.

13
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:28,500
I want him to lose what I lost.

14
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:37,790
it had been a long
journey for david williams,

15
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:43,100
and though it began years ago,
he remembered every step of it...

16
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:50,860
walking outside his front door to find
a policeman with news of a car crash...

17
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:59,260
running into the hospital only to be
told his wife and daughter had died...

18
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:01,740
no! No! Let go of me!

19
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:06,680
being dragged into a psychiatric
facility after his mental breakdown...

20
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,890
no!

21
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,920
Strolling into a hotel
weeks after being released

22
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,030
and bumping into a beautiful blonde...

23
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,060
marcng down the aisle with a
woman who, as it turned out,

24
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:27,430
once lived on the same street with
the man who had killed his family.

25
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,630
But his bride was now unhappy,

26
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:38,640
and dave williams was worried that his
dream of revenge had been destroyed.

27
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:45,500
Luckily for dave, fate was about
to take some steps of its own.

28
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:48,290
Hey, dave! What's going on?

29
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,670
Edie and I had a fight.

30
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,760
I take it you're giving
her time to calm down?

31
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,250
No, I think I'm looking for a place to
stay while she's looking for a lawyer.

32
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:00,190
Oh, man, I...

33
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,210
wanna say something helpful,
but all I got is "that sucks."

34
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,570
That it does.

35
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,570
So where are you headed?

36
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,030
Oh, it's such a nice night, I thought
I'd walk to at motel on the interstate.

37
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,230
Might as well enjoy the stars
while my life falls apart.

38
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,030
it's getting late, and so, uh...

39
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:24,580
hey, why don't you stay with me?

40
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,290
Really? I, uh...

41
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,030
I wouldn't want to impose.

42
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,130
Dave, you saved my life.

43
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,080
I owe ya.

44
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:40,910
Well, now that you
mention it, I guess you do.

45
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,250
come on in.

46
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:50,260
And just like that, dave's
dream of revenge was salvaged...

47
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,560
lead the way, roomie.

48
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:57,750
And he started to feel his
long journey would soon be over.

52
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,150
At 9:02 the next morning...

53
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:17,710
edie williams began calling her friends to let
them know something humiliating had happened to her.

54
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:23,500
By 9:06, her friends
had begun to arrive,

55
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,480
just so they could
hear the juicy details.

56
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:28,940
So he was married before.

57
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,580
You don't kick a man out for that.

58
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,230
no. but you do for never mentioning it.

59
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,190
And especially when I
laid out mentire past.

60
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:42,500
Emphasis on the word "laid."

61
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,640
Exactly. Gaby gets it.

62
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:48,820
Well, maybe they were only together a short
time, and she didn't mean anything to him.

63
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,790
I doubt it, since he walks
around muttering to her ghost.

64
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,970
You know what would lift your spirits?
We should all do a spa weekend.

65
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,850
Yeah! Let's do that.

66
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:04,340
Oh, I appreciate the offer, but I think
I'm better off gettinlost in my work.

67
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,280
Well, maybe I can help you.

68
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,340
Think you can rent my house out?

69
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,260
What?

70
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:16,150
Jackson got a teaching job at
the college in riverton, and...

71
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,340
I'm going with him.

72
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,310
Uh, wait, you're moving?

73
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,540
I know it's sudden, but I
feel really good about this.

74
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:28,550
And it's only two hours away, so it'll
still be like we're practically next door.

75
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:31,690
I am so happy for you,
but we're gonna miss you.

76
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,280
Oh, don't worry about
us. Jackson is so great.

77
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:38,210
You are making the right choice.

78
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,410
Absolutely. Come here, you!

79
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:49,240
I can't believe you're leaving.

80
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,410
When you're done here,
you wanna come do my lawn?

81
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:01,290
Well, I figure since mike's letting me
crash here, it's the least I could do.

82
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,290
Well, that's very nice... and brave.

83
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,750
- Mike takes a lot of pride in his yard.
- Yeah.

84
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,110
Look at his roses.

85
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,590
Every time I walk by here,
I just want to steal one.

86
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,510
- Here, let me cut you one.
- Oh, no. Couldn'T.

87
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,300
He wouldn't like that.

88
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:18,290
Hey, you. What's up?

89
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,700
Not much. Got a call from dylan.

90
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:26,520
Hehusband's traveling more for his business, and
she doesn't have anybody to help her with the baby.

91
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:29,770
She's trying to pushe
to move out to baltimore.

92
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:32,410
So, uh, what'd you say?

93
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,930
Oh, just that I'd think about it.

94
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,260
What do you think I should do?

95
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,400
Well, she really needs your help.

96
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,020
I guess you should help her.

97
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,970
Well, I don't know that
she need it. Honestly?

98
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,050
I think she's just lonely.

99
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,160
of course... it would
be nice to be closer.

100
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:57,450
But is that a good enough reason
to uproot my whole life here?

101
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:02,070
What do you think?

102
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:06,380
I'm not sure. It's up to you.

103
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:11,010
I know. I just... thought
you might have an opinion.

104
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:15,800
oh, shoot. I'm, uh, expecting
a call from a supplier.

105
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:18,380
I'll, uh, I'll talk to you later.

106
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:33,170
on second thought, I'm sure
he won't even notice it's gone.

107
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:42,920
Of will require an updated irrigation
system, which I'm happy to take care of.

108
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,440
Bree, you bought us a house. We
can't let you do all this, too.

109
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:48,520
Nonsense! It's a small price to pay
to make your home more beautiful.

110
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:51,110
- I insist.
-yes!

111
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,330
It's gonna be here tomorrow.

112
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,300
Orson, take it easy!

113
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,360
impossible.

114
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:00,340
Soon, I, the grillmaster, will
christen a brand-new barbecue.

115
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,360
You're pretty excited about a grill.

116
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,110
Oh, it's so much more
than that, young man.

117
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,280
This is the prairiefire turbo.

118
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:10,940
It's 122,000 btus of charbroiling power.

119
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,830
Look out, cattle!

120
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,970
You think you're excited? Just imagine
the salesman who overcharged you.

121
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,080
Well, bree, I got a very good deal.

122
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:24,530
He only thinks he got a good deal because the
salesman threw in one of those "kiss the cook" hats.

123
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,860
And the temperature-sensing
rbecue fork.

124
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,790
- Well, that sounds good.
- Yeah.

125
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,960
Don't encourage him!

126
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:34,320
Orson is a horrible negotiator.

127
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,190
He's never met a sticker
price he didn't like.

128
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,870
- Oh, no, bree,
that's-- - it's true.

129
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:43,560
There's a reason the local car dealers send
you a fruit basket every christmas. W hush.

130
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,190
bree, could you please not do that?

131
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,340
Do... do what?

132
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,700
It's just...

133
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:56,140
when you talk to your husband that
way, it really pushes a button for me.

134
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,700
My mom used to do that, and it, uh...

135
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,950
drove my dad away.

136
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:04,500
I think he was tired
of being emasculated.

137
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,660
Did I mention it has a
rear-mounted rotisserie rack?

138
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,550
what exactly are you saying, alex?

139
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:18,740
I'm saying, if you're gonna be rude to your
husband, could you just not do it in front of me?

140
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,060
So rotisserie, huh?

141
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,470
Yeah. Good for chicken,
rolled roasts, legs of lamb.

142
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:35,280
This thing is so advanced, I
could obably use it to make soup.

143
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,900
I'm sorry. Daddy has to work.

144
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:42,900
Carlos, what is going on?
You're gonna miss your plane.

145
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:45,500
They're upset. They're
not used to me being away.

146
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:48,200
Oh, for god sakes, girls. It's
not like he's going off to war.

147
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:50,810
He's gonna be back tomorrow.

148
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,730
Why can't daddy work here?

149
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,300
Because daddy has a new job
that's gonna make us lots of money.

150
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,230
We don't need lots of money.

151
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,350
Hey, what did I say about
that kind of language?

152
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,480
Look, gis...

153
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,000
Daddy's gonna be home
tomorrow in time for dinner.

154
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,620
You can call me whenever youant. Okay?

155
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:16,660
And the best part is you get to
spend a whole day with just mommy!

156
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,210
heoh, llo, mr. Fishmanan.

157
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,230
I'm coming in. Watch the wheels.

158
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,230
Boy, you just had to
put a rug here, huh?

159
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,910
Uh, is everything okay?

160
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:38,030
It's about your damn son.

161
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,500
- Porter?
- How the hell do I know?

162
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:46,620
He's got red hair and he's got a face you just
wanna slap, and he's driving my sister crazy!

163
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,890
What are you talking about?

164
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:49,350
The retirement home.

165
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:52,110
Your kid has been staying
in your mom's room.

166
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,320
What?

167
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:57,530
Muriel thought he was just visiting,
but he's been there for a week.

168
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:05,570
Now the rules clearly state...
no visiting after dark.

169
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,150
Tom, I know where porter is.
He's hiding at my mother'S.

170
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,230
Oh, hiding, my ass. He's not
hiding. He's living there.

171
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,380
He even stole my sister's orange juice.

172
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,170
I'll take re of it. Thank you.

173
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,600
Call bob. Tell him we can
make the hearing tomorrow.

174
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:22,380
Nobodyan sleep there because he's
got that tv blaring all night long.

175
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:25,240
Look, tom, I can't
talk now. Just call bob.

176
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,400
I'm going over there now. Okay. Bye.

177
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:28,720
parker, I'm gonna be back in an hour.

178
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,600
Mr. Fishman, thank you so much.

179
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,310
well, don't just stand there.

180
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:42,000
Make me a sandwich!

181
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,650
Uh, one more thing. Could you see
about having the basement cleared out?

182
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:53,190
Yeah, e last time we went down there,
it was filled with mildewed boxes.

183
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,160
Oh, I'll take care of that.

184
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,280
There's nothing worse than
having old junk around.

185
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,340
Edie!

186
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,770
Case in point.

187
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,190
edie?

188
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,820
edie! Do you not hear me?

189
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,900
Yeah, I heard you.

190
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,280
Why do you think I kept walking?

191
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,990
Looks like the mailman switched
our mail again. Do you have mine?

192
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,260
Yep. T's in my garbag come by
and grab it at your convenience.

193
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,200
What is wrong with you?

194
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:36,320
I asked everyone over this morning because I had
this huge thing to share about kicking my husband out,

195
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:41,490
and you prance in with your, "me and
jackson are moving to a fairy castle."

196
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,580
I'm sorry.

197
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:47,220
I thought we gave your latest breakup
the three seconds of shock it deserved.

198
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,910
Get the hell out of here.

199
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:51,030
Gladly.

200
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:56,830
- what have you done?
- nothing. It's locked.

201
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,180
do you have a key?

202
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:01,490
In my purse.

203
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,510
Which I left in the kitchen.

204
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,490
Does anyone know you're here?

205
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,080
No.

206
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:13,440
- Help!Get me out of here!
- Somebody help me!

207
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,590
juanita, it's time for your bath.

208
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,020
I'm watching my movie.

209
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,330
You've seen it a hundred times.

210
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,340
She loses her shoe, the prince
finds it--end of story. Let's go.

211
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:26,230
I'll go when I'm ready.

212
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,690
- hey, it's not finished!
- It is for you. Now move!

213
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,940
Juanita solis, I am not kidding.

214
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,860
Okay. That does it. Juanita.

215
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:50,600
If you think I'm not gonna drag you
to the throom, you are sadly mistaken!

216
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,120
You're never gonna make it.

217
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,260
Oh, yes, I will.

218
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,580
My rage is fueling me in
ways you can't imagine.

219
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,520
what's wrong?

220
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,670
My rage just needs to catch its breath.

221
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:14,790
okay. Okay.

222
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:19,860
I am willing to forget this entire incident
if you just go jump in that bathtub right now.

223
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,690
What do you say?

224
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:29,400
I am gonna scrub that smug
look right off your face.

225
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:36,630
Oh, my back!

226
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,160
where is he?

227
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,340
I'm sorry. Have we met?

228
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,960
wait...

229
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:09,500
you're the girl who stuck
me here three years ago.

230
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,550
You come by every christmas
and look at yo watch

231
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:17,080
while I unwrap the socks you
bought me on the drive over.

232
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,930
Do you know what's going on with
porter? The fire? The arrest?

233
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,490
Yes. I read the newspapers.

234
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,060
Everybody's ying for
that poor kid's blood.

235
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,250
No, no. We have this great lawyer.

236
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,140
He thinks he can get
the case thrown out.

237
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:34,390
Oh, really? I didn't realize that.

238
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,650
porter! Come out from under the bed!

239
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,810
Mommy is here to take care of you!

240
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:42,200
Just like she took care of me.

241
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,420
Okay. I know you're mad.

242
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:46,660
I know we have a lot
to hash out between us.

243
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:50,100
But don't take your hate
for me out on your grandson.

244
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,790
Now where is he?

245
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,410
He's safe.

246
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:59,620
I heard muriel fishman
rat me out to her brother,

247
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:03,070
so I-I made sure that
porter cleared out.

248
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:07,790
Mom... this is wrong. Please.

249
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,800
Sucks to feel powerless,
doesn't it, lynette?

250
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:18,080
Please, help!

251
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,860
Please!

252
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:28,600
I'm getng a really unpleasant picture
of what u're like in the ol' sackarooni.

253
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:32,350
Face it, mer. We're stuck.

254
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,220
Gotta get out.

255
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,130
I'm supposed to be
meeting the moving company.

256
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:41,390
what?

257
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:45,180
Keep talking about how you're going
to move away and be with jackson.

258
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:48,550
I ar stupidi makes time go faster.

259
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,490
So now me wanting to be with
the man I love is stupid?

260
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:56,830
And needy and pathetic
and... kinda hilarious.

261
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,180
But there's one thing it's not, mayer.

262
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:01,520
That's "unexpected."

263
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,260
What are you getting at?

264
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:06,490
Have you ever in your
life been without a man?

265
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,250
- Of course I have.
- When?

266
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,790
I don't know. I'm not sure.

267
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,200
What are you doing?

268
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:21,060
- making a calendar.
- Edie...

269
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:26,030
oh, come on. We've got nothing but time,
and I assume you don't wanna make out, so...

270
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,530
first boyfriend?

271
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:38,430
Todd shaffer. I was 14.

272
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:43,690
And why did you and hot toddy break up?

273
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:46,450
He dumped me during math class.

274
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:50,170
And how long did it take you
to start dating somebody else?

275
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,340
This is a stupid
exercise.I refuse to--

276
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:56,280
- when was it?
- Lunch. It was lunch.

277
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,500
You know, I'm feeling
a bit randy tonight.

278
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,710
What do you say we make a little love?

279
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:09,550
Well, we've got 15 minutes
till the news is on. Why not?

280
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:17,110
I still can't get over the
way alex behaved this morning.

281
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,970
"Emasculating." I' never
heard such nonsense.

282
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,970
Don't you think so?

283
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:28,890
Well, I thought the matter in which
alex made his point was inappropriate.

284
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,440
But?

285
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:33,610
Well, I wouldn't say it was nonsense.

286
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:36,070
You can be a little tough sometimes.

287
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,750
"Tough"? That's not a word I
would use to describe myself.

288
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,230
Nobody blames you, bree. You run a
business. You have to be formidable.

289
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,580
Sometimes, if that frame of mind
carries over into your personal life,

290
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:48,940
it's only to be expected.

291
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,250
I don't think I do that.

292
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,470
I know you don'T.

293
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,830
It's not worth getting upset about.

294
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:59,820
Andrew and I are used to it, and I'm sure
in time, alex will get used to it, too.

295
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:03,620
Now... on to more pleasant things.

296
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:07,880
Even though it's my turn, I
don't mind if you're on top.

297
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:18,790
I think we forgot one.

298
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:23,080
Didn't you date somebody after
you stole karl away from me?

299
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:25,300
Ron. Dr. Ron.

300
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,830
- Are we done?
- Yep.

301
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,710
Here it is--the history
of your love life.

302
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,400
Proof that you can't
be happy without a man.

303
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:33,860
This is not proof of anything.

304
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:38,470
Seven boyfriends through high
school and college-- only...

305
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:41,380
41 days single.

306
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,540
What does that tell you?

307
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,960
My grades sucked?

308
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:47,590
It's a cry for help, mayer.

309
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,250
and it doesn't get much better into
the many decades of your adulthood.

310
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:57,980
Hey, I was single for several
months after karl and after mike.

311
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:02,330
But that wasn't of your
choosing. They dumped you.

312
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:08,060
I know. It's hard to look in the mirror.

313
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:10,480
Have you ever looked
in your mirror, edie?

314
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:13,290
You're famous for the number
of men you've conquered.

315
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,390
- Thank you.
- It's not a compliment, you tramp!

316
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,760
Okay, i am not gonna take relationship
tips from a woman who has hooked up with...

317
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,980
what is it? Over a thousand men?

318
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,890
Okay, that's tE.I enjoyed the '80s

319
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:29,860
but the difference is, I go
after men because I want them.

320
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,140
You go after them because you need them.

321
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,760
That is not much of a distinction.

322
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,000
Yes, it is.

323
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:39,760
You have holes in your heart that can
only be filled by a pair of trousers.

324
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:43,940
Face it, mayer. You're weak.

325
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:54,100
porter wasn't there, and she
won't tell me where he is.

326
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,970
did you tell her that
he could end up in jail?

327
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:58,170
Of course I did.

328
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:01,710
Lynette, you're really upset.
Just hang up and come home.

329
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,920
She's so angry at me.

330
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:07,040
She's never gonna tell us where he is.

331
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:12,740
lynette? Lynette?

332
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,200
uh, we need to find lynette scavo.

333
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,500
Let me check.

334
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,800
This is all my fault.

335
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,140
She was so worked up
when she left my room.

336
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,020
I'm not finding a lynette scavo.

337
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,510
Oh, my god. Does that mean she's dead?

338
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,590
No. No.

339
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,600
It means she outsmarted her mom.

340
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:38,160
Oh, my god, porter,
we missed you so much.

341
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,590
I-I don't understand. I
thought you were in an accident.

342
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,990
No, sweetie. I was driving home last
night, talking with your dad on the phone,

343
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,150
and two cars in front
of me had an accident.

344
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,560
And I thought, damn, that could be me.

345
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:53,630
And then I thought, that could be me.

346
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,370
You scared the hell out of me.

347
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:58,250
We are sorry, but we had to get you
back. You've gotta be in court by 5:00.

348
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,720
I don't want to go to jail.

349
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:01,970
Porter, listen to me.
Bob talked to the judge.

350
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:05,110
He thinks he can get
them to drop the charges.

351
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,350
I don't know if I should believe you.

352
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,560
You're gonna have to.

353
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:18,640
- Okay.
- great. Come on. Let's go.

354
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:22,860
That was a rotten
thing you did, lynette.

355
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,630
I thought you were dead.

356
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,100
Yeah, well, what can I tell
ya? I learned from the best.

357
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,980
celia! Juanita!

358
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:44,000
I am not gonna ask you again
to pick up these clothes!

359
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,140
You've got till the count of three!

360
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:51,870
One... two... three!

361
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:55,510
You can hear me, right?

362
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,610
yeah!

363
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:00,150
All right, that's it!
I'm calling your father!

364
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,790
You are gonna get it now!

365
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,820
He is gonna tear into you!
It is gonna be a bloodbath!

366
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:12,920
hey, babe. What's up?

367
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:16,190
- It's your children. They've run amok.
- What?

368
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,690
Now that you've gone back to
work, they won't listen to me.

369
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:21,860
They know you're not in the next room,
ready to drop the hammer. Help me!

370
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:24,600
How? I'm in a meeting.

371
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:28,080
O-okay. I'm gonna put you on speer,
and I want you to rip 'em a new one.

372
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:30,510
I'm with clients. I
don't have time for this.

373
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,710
- But-- -
I gotta go!

374
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,410
Carlos? Carlos!

375
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:40,610
I think he hung up, mommy.
Can you bring us a lemonade?

376
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:45,370
hi, mike.

377
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,460
- Hey, sorry I'm late.
- Where's katherine?

378
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:49,870
Ah, headache. She ses her regrets.

379
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,540
you mind if I grab a beer?

380
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:54,190
Uh, yeah. In the test kitchen.

381
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,180
Uh, beer sounds good. I think
I'll grab one, too. Excuse me.

382
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:05,320
So... katherine not feeling well, huh?

383
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:10,480
Yeah. Yeah, I think she also
might be a little miffed with me.

384
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:14,570
this about baltimore?

385
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:18,910
it's not that I want her
to go, 'cause I don'T.

386
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:22,450
They why don't you tell her?

387
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:26,950
I don't wanna be the guy that comes between her
and her daughter, not to mention a grandchild.

388
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:33,850
I thought this was
because... I don't know.

389
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:36,950
Maybe you're still
hung up on your ex-wife.

390
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:41,550
Susan? No. No, that's over.

391
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,690
You sure?

392
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:50,490
And most guys I talk to, they say
they only really fall in love once.

393
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:56,060
And even if it doesn't work, they spend the rest of
their lives thinking about the one that they lost.

394
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:59,970
I always wondered if that's
how you felt about susan.

395
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,940
Why would you wonder
about something like that?

396
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:07,220
Oh, I don't know. You're
my friend. I care about you.

397
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,250
well, no.

398
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:14,480
In fact, dave, I think I might
be falling in love with katherine.

399
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:20,080
Did you just use the "l" word?

400
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:24,090
See, I-I didn't realize
it was that serious.

401
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:29,450
Ll, to be honest, it didn't really
hit me until she said she might leave.

402
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,540
Where are our guests?
The food's gonna get cold.

403
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,630
Oh, I'll go find them.

404
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,270
And bring some steak sauce.

405
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:48,130
Oh, you're not gonna need
any sauce with these babies.

406
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,400
They are seasoned to perfection.

407
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,400
bring it.

408
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:55,330
Well, there's no sense
in waiting. Dig in.

409
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:02,850
Oh, dear. Are they overcooked?

410
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:06,090
No, they're well-done.
That's the way I like them.

411
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,990
Bree, what do you think?

412
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:10,110
Oh, I really couldn't say.

413
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,480
You couldn't say if
your meat is overcooked?

414
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:16,160
No. I wouldn't want to upset anyone.

415
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:20,530
Well, don't rrY. You won't upset me.

416
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:26,040
I don't think she was referring to you.

417
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,870
Well, it's just that grilling
is suca manly pastime.

418
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:34,360
If I suggested that orson somehow
failed to produce the perfect steak,

419
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:37,200
you might see it as another
example emasculation.

420
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,720
I see. You're not gonna
let that go, are you?

421
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:44,600
Well, for all I know, telling orson his steak
tastes like charcoal might be deballing him.

422
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,960
You know, bree, you can make
your point and still be nice.

423
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:51,260
You know what else would be nice, alex?

424
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,670
Showing gratitude when people
have been generous with you.

425
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,220
Don't listen to her,
alex. She's not mad at you.

426
00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:00,860
She's mad at me... and the meat.

427
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:04,450
Gratitude? What do you mean by that?

428
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,060
I mean I bought you a house.

429
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,410
You'd think you'd show
me a little respect.

430
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,300
seriously? You're bringing up the house?

431
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:13,600
Well, why not? It was a fairly
grand gesture on my part.

432
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:16,640
Yes, and one that apparently
comes with strings.

433
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:21,820
If by "strings," you mean I won't let you
be rude to me in my own house, then yes.

434
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,830
You know wha I think I'm going to
have to decline your grand gesture.

435
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,550
Keep the hse.

436
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,520
What's wrong?

437
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:42,430
Orson burnt the steaks.

438
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:51,460
Susan, how can you tell
if pickles have botulism?

439
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:54,930
Ah, what the hell? I shoot
this stuff into my forehead.

440
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:00,680
Forget it. I'd rather
starv for a day or two.

441
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:05,280
By then, you'll be dead, and I can use
your remains as a source of protein.

442
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:10,050
Oh, come on. That was funny.

443
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:16,460
You know... maybe i do feel
incomplete without a man.

444
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:21,810
But I... wouldn't trade places with
you for anything. You wanna know why?

445
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:25,020
No, but I'm trapped,
so knock yourself out.

446
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:29,070
It's the way you are with
men-- they're like tissues.

447
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:32,850
You use one and then toss it awa
and then you're on to the next one.

448
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:36,730
At least I'm looking for something al.

449
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:41,560
so you think this happy ending
crap that you believe in is real?

450
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:45,740
Please. I know what men are really like.

451
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:48,050
Really?

452
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:53,140
Well, when I was 16, my dad had an affair
with this woman who had a 10-year-old daughter.

453
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:58,200
And one day, he told my mom and
me that he was leaving us for them.

454
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,350
Oh, my god.

455
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,440
No talking.

456
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:05,970
A week later, he comes to
the house to get his stuff,

457
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:09,970
and my mom didn't want to see
him, so we went to the movies.

458
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:14,480
Now I had this, uh,
horse figurine collection.

459
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:18,470
Plastic, glass, ceramic--
hundreds of them.

460
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:23,740
Anyway, we come back from the movies,
and my dad had taken all his stuff.

461
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:29,440
So... I go into my bedroom,
and something seems different.

462
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:34,430
And then I realize all
of mhorses were gone.

463
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:41,270
My mom called my dad and
screamed and all he said was,

464
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:47,860
I was too old for th and that his girlfriend's
daughter would appreciate them more.

465
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,140
can you believe that? What a fungus.

466
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:02,620
oh, god. Are you crying?

467
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,910
it's just... now I get it.

468
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,940
Get what?

469
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:13,040
All these years, I
have judged you, and...

470
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:16,620
it is not your fault. Oh, come here.

471
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:21,060
you are the way you are
because of your father.

472
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,090
Edie, what the hell?

473
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,370
Don't psychoanalyze me, you simp!

474
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:31,160
I was just trying to tell
you how selfish men are.

475
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:37,480
And I was just trying to be nice and give
you a free pass for being such a big slut!

476
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:44,020
Edie!

477
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:48,130
Okay, girls. Pick up your toys and
put 'em in the basket before dinner.

478
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:51,790
Dinner's not for two hours.

479
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,490
I've had enough of your
crap. Now pick up these toys!

480
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,030
No!

481
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:03,360
Okay, juanita. What is going on
here? Why are you being so difficult?

482
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:06,100
When daddy asks you to do
something, you just do it.

483
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:09,130
That's because I love daddy mo.

484
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:17,020
Fine.

485
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,850
everything okay, mrs. Solis?

486
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:37,620
Yeah. just my kids.

487
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:40,500
They really know how push my buttons.

488
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:44,150
Oh, yeah. I got a couple
monsters at home, too.

489
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:47,240
The key is, you gotta
be the bigger monster.

490
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:51,010
Well, unfortunately,
they're not afraid of me.

491
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:55,730
Ooh, that's bad. Fear is the
foundation of all good parenting.

492
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,800
You gotta practice your big voice.

493
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:00,060
finish that broccoli now!

494
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,710
you see how that works?

495
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:04,140
Yeah. It's very effective.

496
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:06,250
well...

497
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:10,220
hey, you got an extra 15 minutes?

498
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:13,910
do it! Faster! Faster! Faster!

499
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,960
I wanna see this place sparkle!

500
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:18,820
Mommy...

501
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:20,020
it's out of my hands, girls.

502
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,270
Word got out that you were
disobeying, and they sent reggie over.

503
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,360
Who sent reggie over?

504
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:28,790
Well, I know how much
you love him, but...

505
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,400
it was your daddy.

506
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:34,560
Enough chatter. Ke moving!

507
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:40,770
when they're done, you
want me to make them vacuum?

508
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:43,320
- If you wouldn't mind.
- Nah.

509
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,050
Gues

510
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:51,580
- aw, come on, edie. I said I was sorry.
- Guess

511
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:53,650
July?

512
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,130
Wrong. March!

513
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,900
Man, you're bad at this.

514
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,070
Guess.

515
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:04,170
oh, hey, mrs. Williams. I
didn't know you were down here.

516
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:07,980
Oh, thank god! We've been
locked in here all night.

517
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:11,550
Really? Good thing I came by
to check the rat traps then.

518
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:14,920
I'm glad I forgot about those until now.

519
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:16,780
uh, mayer?

520
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:22,830
I, uh, would appreciate it if you
wouldn't talk about what we talked about.

521
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,850
I wasn't planning to.

522
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:28,620
Good, because I'll deny it if you do.

523
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:30,340
I won'T.

524
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,840
And... I'll kill you.

525
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:35,370
Good-bye, edie.

526
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,770
oh, I'll bring your mail
over when I get home.

527
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:41,990
Thks.

528
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:46,610
Hey, mom.

529
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,750
I just came by to tell you that the judge
threw out porter's case for lack of evidence.

530
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,220
Isn't that great?

531
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:58,150
Mom...

532
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:01,390
I did not put you in here to punish you.

533
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:04,840
I didn't have a choice.

534
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:07,260
- You had a choice.
- No, I didn'T.

535
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:11,040
From the moment glen died,
u were out of control.

536
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:13,920
It's true you lost all
that money in vegas.

537
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,480
You started drinking again.

538
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:17,410
D how many times did I go to your condo,

539
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:21,580
only to finyou asleep on the sofa
with a cigarette in your mouth?

540
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,460
No, I won't apologize
for bringing you here.

541
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:26,880
I did it because I love you.

542
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:29,390
Then why don't you come visit me?

543
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:32,080
It's not a very pleasant experience.

544
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,770
So I yell a little.

545
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:37,790
So I toss a few curse
words your way. Big deal!

546
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,110
Last time I came, you
threw pudding at me.

547
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:43,240
I'm an angry old woman,
lynette! What do you expect?

548
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:45,510
Here's a thought--
stop being angry.

549
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,050
How?

550
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:52,260
I can't make a friend in this place without having
them drop dead of a stroke five minutes later.

551
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:56,810
I-I feel like hell. Every time I
look in the mirror, I wanna scream.

552
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:00,850
My anger is all I've got left, baby.

553
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:05,890
If I let go of that,
it's over. I know it.

554
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,470
The ball game will be over.

555
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:14,450
The ball game is going to end
whether you like it or not.

556
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:20,390
I would like to be here with you
for whatever time you have left.

557
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:25,900
But for that to happen,
things have to change.

558
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:34,690
Would you come visit me more often?

559
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:38,950
At least twice a week, and
sometimes I'd bring the kids.

560
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:50,210
I'd like that. You know,
they turned out really good.

561
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:55,790
How'd you learn how
to be such a good mom?

562
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:00,360
I have no idea.

563
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:08,150
Well, now that you're here, why don't
you stay, and we can talk a while?

564
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,460
I--and get my flask
out of the drawer.

565
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:16,710
Hey, I can't be nice, forgiving
and sober all at the same time.

566
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:26,550
- Daddy!
- daddy!

567
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:29,560
Missed you guys.

568
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:32,730
You're really helping
mommy, huh? That's great.

569
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:36,170
The scary man told us we had to.

570
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:42,010
We don't even know the guy.
He left a flier in our mailbox.

571
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,430
You left him do your parenting?

572
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,720
Hey, you're the one who
told me to get creative.

573
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:47,660
This wasn't what I meant!

574
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,620
Easy for you to say.

575
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:52,230
They told me they love you more than me.

576
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:56,610
And when I was running things,
they said they loved you more.

577
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,340
Really?

578
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,440
So don't get your feelings hurt, and stop
asking strangers to discipline our kids.

579
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:08,330
Well, I wouldn't have
to if you would do it.

580
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:14,670
so you want me to go twork all
day, go out on business trips,

581
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:18,540
and what little time I have here with the
girls, you want me to spend screaming at them?

582
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:21,170
Just for the first 15 minutes
after you walk in the door.

583
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,640
Then it's carlos time.

584
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:26,470
Forget it! This was the arrangement
you wanted. You made me take this job.

585
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,450
I just wanted us to have a normal life.

586
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:32,330
Well, guess what, sweetie?
Dad's unhappy at work.

587
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:36,180
Mom's home with the
screaming kids. You got one.

588
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,600
Oh, good. You're back.

589
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,600
Can we talk?

590
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,470
If it's about work, yes.

591
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:54,010
If it's about what happened
at the barbecue, no.

592
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,570
Fine.Then as my employee,

593
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:59,090
I authorize a 5-minute break so we
can talk about my son's boyfriend

594
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:02,240
and his absurd
overreaction this afternoon.

595
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:03,560
Th's it. I'm out of here.

596
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:06,410
Andrew, please. You were there.
Alex started the whole thing.

597
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:09,520
You need to tell him
to stop criticizing me.

598
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,490
I'm--I'm not getting
in the middle of this.

599
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,910
If you have a problem
with alex, you tell him.

600
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:16,300
I tried. He won't listen to me.

601
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:18,940
Don't you mean obey?

602
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:23,580
He's not your son. He's not your
husband. He's not your employee.

603
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:26,760
Not everyone has to listen to you.

604
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:31,660
I'll--I'll do
this tomorrow.

605
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,900
I got the flowers.

606
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:02,870
They were from you, right?

607
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,150
Oh, yeah.

608
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:25,130
I just have a minute, and I don't want
to get into a whole thing with you.

609
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:27,210
This won't take long.

610
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:31,030
I don't want to fight anymore.
Please, just take the house.

611
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:37,760
I don't know how else to say this.

612
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:40,710
What happened yesterday
is gonna happen again.

613
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:44,470
It's not gonna be the last time
we fight, 'cause that's who we are.

614
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:50,000
Let's not make it worse by
living on top of each other.

615
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:55,050
Alex...

616
00:38:55,610 --> 00:39:01,620
I'm gonna tell you something I haven't told
anybody-- not orson, not andrew, just you.

617
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:14,170
I know that I've changed since my business
took off, but I didn't want to admit it.

618
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:19,890
I've watched myself become
selfish, impatient, rude.

619
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:26,310
I was never thtype to suffer fools gladly,
but now I seem to find fools everywhere.

620
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,960
And I don't want to be that way.

621
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:34,480
I need someone who isn't
afraid to speak out,

622
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:38,200
to call me out when I cross those lines,

623
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:41,890
and I would love it if
you would be that person.

624
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:49,000
Did my mother-in-law just give
me permission to criticize her?

625
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:51,440
Yes, I did.

626
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:58,260
I'm a lucky guy.

627
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:06,780
Edie.

628
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,580
Listen, um...

629
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:15,460
I'm not happy about you lying to me,
but I think what we have is real, A...

630
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:19,960
I'm not ready to throw it away.

631
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:23,250
Really?

632
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,950
And don't tell anyone, but
I'm at the point in my life

633
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:31,830
where I could use a happy ending.

634
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:36,000
I'll get my stuff.

635
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:50,990
hello?

636
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:53,110
Jackson, hi. Do you have a sec?

637
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,700
Sure. Is something wrong?

638
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:57,540
Uh, no, nothing's wrong. Just...

639
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:01,930
we need to talk about this move.

640
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:06,890
At 5:15 that afternoon,

641
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:10,750
edie williams began calling
her friends to inform them

642
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,930
that her husband had come home.

643
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:18,610
Sadly, she never got
through to any of them.

644
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,210
gabrielle never picked up.

645
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:26,690
She was too busy watching her children
being told they had to obey their mother...

646
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,940
and trying not to smile.

647
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:34,730
Lynette wasn't home when edie called.

648
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:40,930
she was with her mother, laughing and
sharing stories about the old days...

649
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,580
and enjoying every minute of it.

650
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:50,530
Bree was outside showing her
future son-in-law color samples

651
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:53,350
for the home she had bought him...

652
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:57,270
and smiling politely
when they disagreed.

653
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:01,900
And susan-- well,
she didn't answer

654
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:06,300
because she was sittinin her
favorite chair with a cup of tea...

655
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:10,910
learning to enjoy, for
the first time in her life,

656
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:15,040
what it was like to be alone.
