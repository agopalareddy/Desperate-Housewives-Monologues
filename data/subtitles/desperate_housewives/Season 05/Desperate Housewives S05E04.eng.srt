3
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,140
Previously on Desperate Housewives...

4
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:06,330
Bree's husband felt rejected. I think it's strange to see my wife billed

5
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,610
As "mrs. Van de kamp." it's how I'm known.

6
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,740
Is there a mr. Van de kamp? No, uh, mr. Van de kamp is deceased.

7
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,690
Would it have killed you to have mentioned me?

8
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:18,310
It's because I went to jail, isn't it? Lynette's husband was excited.

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,220
We're gonna start a garage band!

10
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,590
I thought you were the one who said you wanted

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,620
To spend more Time with your family. Guys need to blow off steam.

12
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:28,060
Edie's new husband had a past... You've been here six weeks,

13
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,170
And you don't seem any closer to coming to terms

14
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,210
With your rage. I've come to terms with it,

15
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,450
And I like it just the way it is. ...Which remained a mystery.

16
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,220
I just think it's odd that you're married to some guy.

17
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,970
You don't know anything about him. Well, she kept asking me All this Stuff

18
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,440
About your background.

19
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,380
And Susan tried to move on.

20
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,300
Well, I sort of started seeing someone. Good for you.

21
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,650
Every year, ms. Elenora BuTTers

22
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,640
Would ask her kindergarten class

23
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,740
To draw a picture of their families

24
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,550
Which she would then display on "meet the teacher" night.

25
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,920
That's how Ty Richmond's parents

26
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:09,980
Saw his depiction of their fighting...

27
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:13,990
And Amy Hines' parents

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,480
Saw her portrayal of their drinking.

29
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,130
And Jason Monte's parents

30
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:23,110
Saw his illustration of their hygiene.

31
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,000
You see, ms. Butters felt it was important

32
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:32,800
For parents to see themselves through their children's eyes.

33
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,700
She knew the experience...

34
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,500
Ed, he's got me vacuuming in my bra.

35
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,610
Do I do that?

36
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,700
Could be very Educational.

37
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,520
I know, I know.

38
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,060
Did I not say 7:00? You missed their little show.

39
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:52,250
M.J. Was tooth decay. Well, crosstown traffic killed me.

40
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,620
And I told you to videotape it.

41
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,610
Well, did you tell me to take off the lens cap?

42
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:59,760
Next Time, be more specific. Mr. Delfino, glad you made it.

43
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,250
Uh, did you get to see m.J.'s artwork?

44
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,070
No, not yet. Can't wait. Oh.

45
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,390
Oh, hey, look at that.

46
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,650
There we are, Standing in front of the house.

47
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,450
Look what he did with my hair.

48
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,210
I kind of like the bangs. Yeah, look, he put a wrench in my pocket.

49
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,910
And see how big my muscles are? Which is a good thing,

50
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,400
'cause there's a shark attacking the house.

51
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,220
Hey, daddy.

52
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,640
Hey, buddy. Your mommy and i

53
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,260
Were just looking at your wonderful painting.

54
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,070
You like it?

55
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,740
I love it, especially how big and strong you made me look.

56
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,240
That's not you. That's Jackson.

57
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,660
See the paintbrush in his pocket?

58
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,040
Oh, who's Jackson?

59
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,180
He paints our house...

60
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,640
Until my mom makes him drink wine and have a sleepover.

61
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,710
Because...

62
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,830
Mike and I are divorced, so that's why...

63
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,940
It was supposed to be a picture of the family,

64
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,980
So you should've put your daddy in it.

65
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,300
Did.

66
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:08,720
Oh, the... The bug with the little hat?

67
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,910
That's you,

68
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,750
'cause you're Always so far away.

69
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,330
Oh, yeah, that's, um...

70
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:16,990
Now I see me.

71
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,040
Yes... Every year,

72
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:23,830
Ms. Elenora BuTTers would ask her class

73
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,230
To draw a picture of their families,

74
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:29,240
Even though she knew the portraits...

75
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,500
Might not be that flattering.

76
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:49,820
If you look closely into the faces of your friends,

77
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,130
You'll see it.

78
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,420
Congratulations! Hi!

79
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:56,390
Come on in!

80
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:58,410
Right behind their smiles,

81
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,670
You will see a certain Green-eyed monster,

82
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,620
And then you'll understand

83
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:07,810
How envious they are of your well-kept home...

84
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,130
Your delious recipes...

85
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,360
And yourasteful ssessions.

86
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,940
Here's my cookbook.

87
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:22,450
But you'll have to work hard to see the jealousy,

88
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:26,590
Because good friends Always work hard

89
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,200
To hide it.

90
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,820
Look at you, right on the cover!

91
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,510
These are advanced copies.

92
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,350
I wanted you to be the first to have them.

93
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,930
Oh, and look, you signed it-- "to Lynette,

94
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,690
The sweetest, most wonderful friend I've ever known."

95
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,840
"to Susan, the sweetest, most--"

96
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,980
We don't have to read them out Loud.

97
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,790
Don't mind me, ladies.

98
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,620
I'm just grabbing a kiss on my way to the

99
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,670
Salt mines. Mmm. Oh. Mmm. You have a good day

100
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,160
Thanks, babe. Oh, did you show thethe

101
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,910
Ad? Yeah. Oh, I Almost forgot. Uh, bye

102
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,560
Isn't this nice?

103
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,860
They're running it next month in "woman's day."

104
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,060
You're gonna be in magazines, too?

105
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:07,080
They've come up with this whole Marketing plan--

106
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:09,500
Radio, print, book signings.

107
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,840
Wow! Isn't it fantastic? No, it's horrible!

108
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,660
She's gonna become this famous author

109
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,140
And have no Time at All for us.

110
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,730
No, come on, Gaby. You know that Bree

111
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,950
Will never change. Thank you, Katherine

112
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,170
I will never become Stuck-up and full of myself.

113
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,640
I didn't say that. I said you'd never change.

114
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,950
Very funny.

115
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,350
I hardly think you have to worry about me becoming famous.

116
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,090
You have a Marketing plan.

117
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,870
You wanna see my Marketing plan?

118
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,790
"milk, bread, vodka, condoms--"

119
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:42,380
Could I see that? I'd love to read it. Why?

120
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:45,430
Well, back before I consecrated my life to mozzarella,

121
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,210
Marketing was sort of what I did.

122
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,290
Oh, right! Of course.

123
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,960
I would, uh, love to hear your thoughts.

124
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,130
So you're still gonna

125
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,560
Wanna hang out with us, even when you're totally fabulous,

126
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:57,120
And we're still nobodies?

127
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,700
Girls, you are making way too much of this.

128
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:03,080
I am not a bit more fabulous than any one of you.

129
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,180
Excuse me.

130
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:08,540
What is it, Andrew? I hope you're free for lunch on the 12th,

131
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,130
'cause the chamber of commerce

132
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,270
Just named you businesswoman of the year.

133
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,200
Oh, my god! That is so amazing!

134
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,430
The, uh, dry cleaner just, um...

135
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,900
Found my sweater.

136
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:30,410
Girls, catch up with you later!

137
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,280
Orson, I have amazing news.

138
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:42,040
The chamber of commerce just called. Oh? What about?

139
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,700
I wanna buy you lunch and tell you in person.

140
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,880
I will be at your office in two minutes.

141
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:48,680
Uh, no! No, don't come to my office.

142
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:51,870
You know, I can't have lunch now. Um, I'm in a meeting.

143
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,390
Well, I'll wait in reception until it's over.

144
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,180
No, it'll take hours.

145
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,590
It's a very urgent, high-level Stuff.

146
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,400
What kind of meeting is it?

147
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,940
George, hey!

148
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,980
Turn that radio down!

149
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,230
Where are you? I told you, I'm in a meeting.

150
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:17,520
I gotta go.

151
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:18,600
I'll see you soon.

152
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:22,610
Yes, you will.

153
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,600
Mike! What's going on?

154
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,370
Daddy got me a bike.

155
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,310
Yes, I see. And here,

156
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,580
Mommy thought we'd agreed to wait till your birthday.

157
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,800
Crazy mommy. Can you teach me to ride it?

158
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:42,200
No, not today. I gotta go install a water heater.

159
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:43,930
But, uh, you keep practicing,

160
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,000
And the next afternoon I have free, we'll bust off

161
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:49,320
Those training wheels and go kick up some dirt. Okay? Okay.

162
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:50,230
All right.

163
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,010
Oh, my god.

164
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,260
This is about m.J.'s drawing, isn't it?

165
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,120
Wh?

166
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:59,510
He does not love Jackson more than you.

167
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,740
He knows who his father is. I know that.

168
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,080
Can't a guy get his kid a bike without being psychoanalyzed?

169
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,530
So you're totally fine with that drawing?

170
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:11,100
Well, I won't go sticking it on my fridge anytime soon,

171
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,170
But yeah.

172
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,460
Look, I'm glad you're dating a nice guy.

173
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,560
I'm glad he likes my kid, and my kid likes him.

174
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,890
Here's a bike. That's All it is.

175
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,090
Hey, guys.

176
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,940
Jackson, look at my new bike!

177
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:28,900
Pretty cool.

178
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:34,140
Uh, that's a custom titanium frame.

179
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,020
Make sure m.J.Nows that.

180
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,990
So, Wendy, I gotta know about the weather.

181
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,630
Mommy, can Bethany go home now?

182
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,390
Honey, she's only been here 20 minutes.

183
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,420
We invited her over to play, so go play.

184
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,290
But All she does is spin.

185
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,010
...Somewhat across the reach of the state,

186
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,580
Knocking temperatures down I would say a few degrees...

187
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:56,590
Honey, we want Bethany to be our friend,

188
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,430
So if she wants to spin, just suck it up and spin.

189
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,450
Why are you shoving that little weirdo down Juanita's throat?

190
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:08,720
That little weirdo is the key to you and I having more sex.

191
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,270
I know I should ask a few questions, but I'm in.

192
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:15,680
Bethany's mom hosts a weekly playdate.

193
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,380
I'm trying to get Juanita an invitation.

194
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:21,180
How does that lead to quality Time with your boobs?

195
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,920
Carlos, the only Time you and I have to ourselves

196
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:27,050
Is late at night, but by that Time, we're too exhausted.

197
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:29,380
And now that we have Celia in afternoon preschool,

198
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:32,060
All we have to do is unload Juanita,

199
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:34,320
And then we can get back to doing the nasty.

200
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,650
This doesn't seem right.

201
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,000
I mean, dumping our kid off on some unsuspecting woman

202
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:40,560
So that we can have sex?

203
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:42,760
Wake up! Playdates were invented by mothers

204
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,180
For this exact purpose.

205
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:47,320
Shopping, sex, drinking in the afternoon--

206
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:49,030
Playdates make All these things possible.

207
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,060
I-i don't know.

208
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,640
I feel bad making my kid playing with someone

209
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:56,060
That she obviously doesn't like.

210
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:59,240
Bethany's mom will take Juanita once a week for two whole hours.

211
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,760
That is sex and a nap.

212
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,950
Juanita!

213
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,990
I don't hear you spinning!

214
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:11,470
I don't understand. You said the job was going so well.

215
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,570
It was. Then three weeks ago,

216
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,260
My parole officer left me a message at work.

217
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,840
That's when they found out I lied on my application

218
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,850
When I said I didn't have a criminal record.

219
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:24,350
So you've been pretending to go to work for three weeks?

220
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,070
I know you're angry.

221
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:27,220
Honey...

222
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,420
I'm not angry.

223
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:33,260
I'm hurt that you didn't feel like you could tell me.

224
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:34,890
I was embarrassed.

225
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,620
Bree, when we married, I was the breadwinner.

226
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,690
Now you--you have your company and you have your book.

227
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,850
I-i'm a felon who can't hold on to a job.

228
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:48,210
Orson, we're partners. We share everything.

229
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,410
Any success I have

230
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,560
Is just as much yours as it is mine.

231
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,660
Thank you, darling.

232
00:10:58,990 --> 00:10:59,800
So...

233
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:01,530
Why did the chamr of commerce call?

234
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:07,020
Apparently, we've been named businesswoman of the year.

235
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,770
Is that good enough?!

236
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,960
Wow! You'd be killer in our band.

237
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:34,050
I mean, wouldn't he be killer, Dave? Uh,

238
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,570
Donald, why don't you let us talk it over

239
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,110
And we'll get back to you? No problem.

240
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,490
I have to get back to the office anyway.

241
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,710
Quarterly tax Time has got me swamped.

242
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,040
Well, we'll--we'll definitely call you today

243
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,120
Thanks, gentlemen.

244
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,440
Don't you think he crushed it?

245
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,440
He was good... You know, technically.

246
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:54,240
He didn't really have heart. What do you mean?

247
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,230
When he played "voodoo child," it was like Hendrix has risen.

248
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:01,350
Hey, what about Mike? I thought that's who we were gonna get.

249
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,790
Well, I asked, but he said he's too busy.

250
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,550
Too busy to live a little? Not gonna fly.

251
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,910
Call him. Give him my number.

252
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,820
I'll talk to him. Okay, sure. But--but what about Donald

253
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,510
I mean, 'cause if we don't get Mike, I wanna make s--

254
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,470
Tom, Donald's out, all right?

255
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,000
Have Mike call me.

256
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,040
What a rehearsal.

257
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:35,430
Dave and I were smokin'.

258
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,470
Did you hear us?

259
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,850
Lynette?

260
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:42,430
Lynette.

261
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44,190
I'm sorry. What?

262
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,080
Never mind.

263
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,550
What are you working on? What, is this Bree's ad Stuff?

264
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,680
Oh, god, no. Her agency really whiffed... Hmm?

265
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:53,920
So I'm coming up with a whole new campaign.

266
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,710
I was looking through my old portfolio

267
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,430
For inspiration. Mm-hmm.

268
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,230
Oh! I remember this one.

269
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:02,600
"feet? Meet your new best friends." it was a classic.

270
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,270
You know, it been years since I looked through this Stuff.

271
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,270
I'd forgotten I was... Kinda great.

272
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,250
You were awesome!

273
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,710
I mean, come on. How lucky is Bree

274
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,960
To have a neighbor that used to be a big advertising hotshot?

275
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,530
Well, Maybe I'm the lucky one.

276
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,110
This could be a perfect way for me

277
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,340
To stick my toe back in the business.

278
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:24,570
Nothing big, Maybe just pick up some freelance work.

279
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,760
But, honey, if you do that, where you gonna find the Time

280
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:30,430
For the family and the restaurant? Well, gee, I don't know.

281
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,580
I gus the same place that you find Time for your garage band.

282
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,360
Lynette, I'm just saying that if--if you...

283
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:46,370
Okay, I dropped off Celia at preschool,

284
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,710
And Juanita's at her playdate.

285
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,730
Drop trou.

286
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,370
Why don't you put on that sexy red Teddy?

287
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:54,240
Can I ask why? I mean, you can't see it.

288
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,620
Yeah, but I can feel it,

289
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,430
And I love the sensation of sliding silk off your body.

290
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,360
What's it like, Carlos?

291
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,100
What?

292
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:08,950
Sex as a blind man.

293
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:11,870
I mean, you used to be so visual.

294
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,830
Is it still as good?

295
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,960
Oh, it's better.

296
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,040
I mean, having to rely on

297
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:18,620
Your senses of touch and taste and smell...

298
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:20,200
It's actually way more intense.

299
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:24,400
Really? You're so lucky.

300
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,020
What, you want blind sex?

301
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,620
I think I can arrange that.

302
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:33,950
Hey there.

303
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:39,160
Looks like somebody's job interview went well.

304
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,110
Nope. They turned me down flat.

305
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,790
Aw. But as I was driving home, it suddenly hit me.

306
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:47,200
I May be persona non grata at every company in this town,

307
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:49,290
But there's at least one employer I know

308
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,360
Who would love to hire me.

309
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:51,690
Oh. Who?

310
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:54,960
You.

311
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,900
You wanna work here?

312
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,170
Why not?

313
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:03,000
I'm great with food. I understand business.

314
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,510
I can't beat the commute.

315
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:08,480
Well, that's certainly an intriguing notion.

316
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,170
But wouldn't it be awkward having me as your boss?

317
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,400
Absolutely.

318
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,630
But as you said in the park,

319
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,470
We share everything.

320
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,850
So I would be more of a... Partner.

321
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,910
Partners? Oh.

322
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:24,380
Well-- Bree, would you give me a hand with this arrangement?

323
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,240
Just give me a sec.

324
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,060
I think the lilies need their own vase.

325
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,280
If you hire him,

326
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:33,860
I will cut you with these scissors!

327
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:35,770
I don't think we need to do that.

328
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,710
I think they're crowding the irises out.

329
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,920
Just like he's trying to crowd me out.

330
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,870
You Already have a partner, remember?

331
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,600
Oh, well, I think the irises and the lilies

332
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:49,090
Could work together. Nope. One of them has to go.

333
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,360
If I May offer an opinion-- not a good Time, Orson.

334
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,800
Tell him now,

335
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:57,110
Or I will walk.

336
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:02,560
Orson, you really don't wanna work with me.

337
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:03,950
I mean, you only see me at home.

338
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,590
But at work, when the pressure's on, I can be a bit of a handful.

339
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:11,260
Kathine's seen how I get. Oh, yes. Bitchy, Tyrannical, shrill--

340
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,030
He gets it, dear.

341
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,210
Honey, you're my partner in life.

342
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,840
But if we want to keep it that way,

343
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:22,100
We shouldn't mix marriage and business.

344
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,010
But no one else will hire me

345
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,390
Well, you've only been looking for a few weeks.

346
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,230
I mean, give it another... Say, month or two,

347
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,760
And  you still haven't found anything,

348
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:33,830
Then we'll revisit the idea. Okay?

349
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:37,010
Okay.

350
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:38,960
It was just a thought.

351
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:50,390
Oh, so what'd you think?

352
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:52,230
Oh, my god, you were right.

353
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,010
Blind sex is incredible.

354
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,540
Ahh, give me ten more minutes and an energy bar,

355
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,860
And we can go one more Time.

356
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,520
No, I think we're done.

357
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,030
Honey!

358
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,780
What are you doing home? I thought you were at Bethany's.

359
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,890
I got a tummyache. Her mom brought me back.

360
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:19,500
Well, how long have you been Standing there?

361
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,540
I don't know. What were you two doing?

362
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,210
Um, we were, uh...

363
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,430
We were wrestling. Wrestling.

364
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,550
Did daddy hurt you? You were making Loud noises.

365
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:34,200
No! No, that wasn't real.

366
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,960
Sometimes I fake it when I wrestle with daddy.

367
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,170
Please don't wrestle th mommy.

368
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,580
You're too big. You could hurt her.

369
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,360
Yeah, Carlos, stop that.

370
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:47,590
Okay, go to your room,

371
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,540
And I'm gonna bring you something for your tummy.

372
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,530
I think she bought it.

373
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,870
You mean the story of how daddy beats up mommy?

374
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,560
Relax. I told her I was fine. Look, I could hear the worry in her voice.

375
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:02,010
Why don't we just tell her the truth?

376
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,550
What, that sometimes mommy rides daddy

377
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,450
Like a mechanical bull to get jewelry?

378
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,070
She's 5. She's too young to understand

379
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,120
Either half of that. It's the facts of life

380
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,410
She's gonna learn 'em eventually,

381
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,420
And it's the most natural thing in the world.

382
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,300
Carlos, if she was Standing there

383
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,960
Any longer than five minutes,

384
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,090
There was nothing natural about what she saw.

385
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,090
By the way, thank you for that.

386
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,150
Hello?

387
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,820
Hey, it's me. Listen,

388
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:32,390
I've got some free Time,

389
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:33,420
So I thought I'd come over

390
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:37,000
And teach m.J. How to ride his new bike. Great. He's so excited to learn.

391
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:40,810
Are you sure he's ready to go without training wheels?

392
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,460
Oh, he'll probably have to take a few spills,

393
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:44,980
But luckily, he'll have his old man there to pick him up.

394
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,690
Yeah. He's been asking when you're coming.

395
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:50,500
I can't wait to tell him. I know he'll be just...

396
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,650
All right!

397
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,010
What's the Matter?

398
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,870
Spider. Big one. Gotta go!

399
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,020
Mommy, look, no traing wheels.

400
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,160
I know! You did great!

401
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:07,060
Jackson, can I see you a sec?

402
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,950
That was amazing! He learned so fast.

403
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,300
Yeah. You know what I learned? Mike is on his way over here

404
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:15,090
To teach his son how to ride the bike he bought--

405
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,880
Something he was looking forward to until you ruined it.

406
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,510
W-why didn't you tell me that? I didn't know

407
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,200
I had to tell you not to steal a father's precious moment.

408
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:24,090
M.J.--he just kept asking me.

409
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:26,350
He--he made me do it. You could've walked away

410
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,400
No, I couldn't!

411
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,600
He said, "pwease!"

412
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,440
Damn it.

413
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:34,670
As you can see, the graphic works just as well

414
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,630
On a free-standing display unit. Neat, huh?

415
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:40,000
Goodness, Lynette.

416
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:41,960
When you offered to share your thoughts on my campaign,

417
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:44,880
I wasn't expecting anything quite so... Elaborate.

418
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:47,670
Well, who knew your Marketing guys were such lame-os?

419
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,550
What they came up with is so...

420
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:51,730
Tepid.

421
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,120
Um, I think "understated" was what they were going for.

422
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:59,110
Well, they overshot and wound up in "bland,"

423
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,520
Right on the border of "sucky."

424
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:03,640
You need to grab your audience, just grab 'em.

425
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:05,450
I've gone for jazzier colors,

426
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,770
Bolder fonts.

427
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,780
Oh, I have really played up the whole nostalgia angle.

428
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,680
"let mrs. Van de kamp

429
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:15,000
Turn your oven into a Time machine."

430
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:17,450
I see women really responding to that.

431
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:19,720
Do you?

432
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,840
Because I see children

433
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:25,930
Crawling into ovens, hoping to see dinosaurs.

434
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:29,040
Okay. Well...

435
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,060
I've got a whole bunch of Alternatives.

436
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:33,640
Oh, Lynette, I appreciate everything you've done.

437
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,530
But I've actually approved the old campaign,

438
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,920
And I can't just tell them I've changed my mind.

439
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,960
You don't have to. I'll be the bad guy.

440
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,200
Just tell 'em you've hired me,

441
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:43,410
And I'll go in there, six-guns ablazing.

442
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,340
So... Do we have a deal?

443
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:48,570
Just give me the word.

444
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,090
No.

445
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,280
No?

446
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:55,000
Sorry, but I prefer their campaign.

447
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,170
But mine is better.

448
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:01,200
Well, you're... Entitled to think so, but I don't.

449
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,710
Look, Bree...

450
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:07,320
I think I know a little more about Marketing than you do.

451
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:09,340
When I was in it, I owned this town.

452
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,650
I had every big account.

453
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:14,840
Hell, I was even named businesswoman of the year.

454
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:17,650
Oh. Well, I'm familiar with that award.

455
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,080
In fact, I'm this year's recipient.

456
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,880
Really? Yes.

457
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:26,330
There's a luncheon on the 12th. I do hope you can make it. Oh.

458
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:29,610
By the way,

459
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,170
You're right about those colors.

460
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,180
Very... Jazzy.

461
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,330
Come on, m.J. Your daddy's waiting.

462
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,050
Mommy, I don't wanna fall.

463
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,020
Oh, honey.

464
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,110
You know how you like to push the button

465
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,320
When we go on the elevator,

466
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:58,550
And if somebody else pushes it first,

467
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,660
It makes you sad? But I don't wanna fall

468
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:04,590
Just listen. Daddy really wanted to be the one

469
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,290
To teach you to ride your bike, and if you can Already do it,

470
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,100
It's gonna make him sad.

471
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:12,100
So just let daddy push the button. Understand?

472
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,360
Oh, man.

473
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,860
Wow, he's really picking it up fast.

474
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:28,450
Yeah. I think it's just beginner's luck. Uh-huh.

475
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,090
Are you sure he hasn't been practicing?

476
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,950
No. He was absolutely waiting for you

477
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,810
You know, I think I'm gonna go check his helmet.

478
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,840
What are you doing? We talked about this.

479
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:43,980
You're supposed to be new at it. I don't want to fall. I'm scared.

480
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:47,290
Oh! Of what? You're 3 inches off the ground.

481
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:50,570
You're completely padded. So just do what I say--

482
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,380
Wobble, wobble. "daddy, look at me!" crash.

483
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:58,640
Boy...

484
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,590
He was just telling me

485
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,850
How glad he is to have his dad here. Really?

486
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:06,940
'cause I Almost feel like he doesn't even need me. Oh, that's just silly.

487
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:25,640
Whoops-a-daisy! Oh, it's a good thing your dad's here

488
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:28,710
To teach you how to do it right. Oh, looking good, buddy, but remember,

489
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,280
When you stop, you gotta put your foot down first.

490
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:33,250
Okay? Ow!

491
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:36,020
Oh, what, does that hurt right there, buddy? Oh, he's fine.

492
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,500
No, mommy. It hurts.

493
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:46,790
This is All my fault. Oh, will you stop?

494
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,430
The doctor said it was just a sprain.

495
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,530
I know, but still, I shouldn't have pushed it.

496
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:53,400
You know, why look for blame? Kids fall.

497
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:54,780
If you have to find fault,

498
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:56,950
Blame the pavement, not yourself...

499
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,430
Or me.

500
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:01,590
Mommy!

501
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,280
He should have his pitching arm back in no Time.

502
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:09,600
Oh, thank you. But I did wanna ask--m.J. Said that he fell on purpose,

503
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:11,040
Something about you telling him

504
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:13,160
To "let daddy push the elevator button"?

505
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,530
You told him to fall?

506
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,410
Remember, it's the pavement you're mad at.

507
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,640
What the hell, Susan? Why would you do something like that?

508
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,810
Jason taught him to ride the bike.

509
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,820
Jackson.

510
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,210
Who's Jackson?

511
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:32,720
He does sleepovers with mommy.

512
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:34,470
They drink lots of wine.

513
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:39,420
Hey, doc. Uh, don't you hand out lollipops to brave little boys?

514
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:46,850
I'm sorry. M.J. Was excited about the bike,

515
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,880
So Jackson took off the training wheels

516
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:50,450
And taught him. He didn't know.

517
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,950
He didn't know I'd wanna be the one

518
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,460
To teach my own kid how to ride a bike? Okay, you know what?

519
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:58,060
This is not Jackson's fault.

520
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,970
You can't give a 5-year-old a bike

521
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:03,140
And expect him to wait to ride it until you have Time.

522
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:08,180
You know, this is what it means to be divorced.

523
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:11,180
It means that sometimes you won't be there.

524
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,690
I know.

525
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,290
It's...

526
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,490
Just harder

527
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,950
Than I thought it would be.

528
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:25,540
Well, it's hard for me, too.

529
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,050
I miss things when he's with you.

530
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,970
And i...

531
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:34,360
Am trying to come to terms with my guilt, because...

532
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:37,570
I have to.

533
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,330
So do you.

534
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:45,550
There's nothing else you can do.

535
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,110
Has Mike called?

536
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,050
Hi, honey. You're home.

537
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:00,740
Sorry, hon.

538
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,960
So did he call?

539
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,690
No.

540
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,270
Hey, listen to this.

541
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:11,640
Mrs. Hudson's putting her house up for sale.

542
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:13,090
I think we should buy it.

543
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:14,870
Why?

544
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,810
As an investment. I-i mean, it's fantastic.

545
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:21,060
My friend Mary Alice blew her brains out in this house,

546
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:23,030
And All I'd have to do is let that slip,

547
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:27,710
And we'd get it for a song. Yeah. I don't think so.

548
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:29,410
Well, why not? We'll rent it out.

549
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:33,110
We could make some serious money. Last thing I wanna be is a landlord,

550
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,960
Get a phone call every Time a toilet overflows.

551
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,260
That's why we hire a management company-- damn it, Edie, I said no!

552
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:48,930
Why are you yelling at me?

553
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:52,500
I don't know.

554
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:56,330
I'm sorry. I just got a lot on my mind.

555
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,230
I'm sorry.

556
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:35,040
Hi, Bethany.

557
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:37,200
I'm here to pick up Juanita. Is she around?

558
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,990
Boys have sperm.

559
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,240
Excuse me?

560
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:43,510
We need to talk.

561
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:50,520
So apparently, after we had our little chat with Juanita,

562
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:51,610
She went straight to Bethany

563
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:54,400
And passed on the facts of life in excruciating detail.

564
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:56,180
Well, did you explain to Peggy why we had

565
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:58,060
The little chat? She didn't wanna hear it

566
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,680
Not with Bethany running around the house,

567
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:02,240
Screaming "intercourse!" at the top of her lungs.

568
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,460
So we're out of the playdate? Oh, yeah. Way out.

569
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:11,370
Well, I guess it's back to the old schedule

570
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,410
Of ten minutes of grope 'n snore at midnight.

571
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,100
I'm not going back, Carlos. I can't.

572
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,510
If Juanita doesn't get her playdate,

573
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:21,220
You're not getting yours. Fine. I will fix it. I just don't know why

574
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:23,300
Peggy's making such a big deal out of this.

575
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,860
Sperm!

576
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,670
Juanita! Stop talking to your sister!

577
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,520
Orson, what are you doing in the guest bedroom?

578
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:38,010
Oh, I couldn't sleep.

579
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,970
You were snoring too Loudly.

580
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,520
Me? Snoring?

581
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:45,530
Mm, like a donkey with a head cold.

582
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,670
Honey, I don't snore.

583
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,600
Oh, you can't Always hear yourself.

584
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:50,930
But I hear you...

585
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,020
Loud and clear.

586
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,050
Oh, for heaven sakes, come back to bed.

587
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:00,040
No.

588
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,630
I'm good here.

589
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,280
Dave Williams

590
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:13,740
Look, hate to bother you,

591
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,930
But I got a busted pipe outside the house.

592
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:18,360
Probably some kids playing a prank. No problem.

593
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:19,960
I'm across town finishing up on another job.

594
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:21,720
So depending on traffic, give me...

595
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:24,450
Say an hour? Oh, thanks. I really appreciate it

596
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:41,840
So when Juanita thought that I might be hurting her mother,

597
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:44,460
We decided it was best that she knew the truth.

598
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:47,200
It just seemed like the right thing to do at the Time.

599
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:48,880
See, honey?

600
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:51,670
I-i knew there had to be a rational explanation.

601
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,180
Well...

602
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:55,820
I guess under the circumstances,

603
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,770
You didn't have y other choice.

604
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,750
So... Do you think there's any chance

605
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,050
Juanita could rejoin your playdate? We've talked to her.

606
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,900
She will never discuss sex ever again.

607
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:10,060
Not if she wants to see her favorite dolly Alive.

608
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:14,070
Gaby, we don't need to let them know

609
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,570
All of our parenting secrets.

610
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:18,150
I... Think that'd be okay.

611
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,320
I probably overreacted.

612
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,340
We just wanna keep Bethany's innocence as long as we can.

613
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,920
Oh, we totally agree.

614
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:27,710
Kids are forced to grow up way too fast these days. No kidding.

615
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,560
I want my girls to believe in santa claus as long as possible.

616
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:33,060
They're gonna find out soon enough that it's All a lie.

617
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,000
What?

618
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,210
There's no santa claus?!

619
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:46,640
So...

620
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:48,560
Next playdate's monday at 1:00?

621
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:52,130
Wow, whoever did this really went to town.

622
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:54,570
Yeah, I know. Damn kids.

623
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,130
By the way,

624
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:58,040
Did you put any more thought into joining the band?

625
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:00,140
Oh, man. I'm sorry. I've been meaning to get back to you.

626
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,160
I appreciate the offer,

627
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:03,090
But I'm really stretched thin these days.

628
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,250
Oh, come on. Every man's got Time for a little music.

629
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,120
Believe me, I'd love to play with you guys,

630
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:10,900
But, uh, I live 30 minutes away--an hour in traffic.

631
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,850
Whatever Time I've got left's for my son. Yeah, I hear ya.

632
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,940
Hey, you ever look into living a little closer by?

633
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:18,920
With the rent prices in this neighborhood?

634
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,030
I might play guitar like a rock star,

635
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:24,200
But I don't earn like one. Yeah. Sorry.

636
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,360
I wasn't thinking. Oh, it's All right.

637
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,650
Uh, appreciate you trying to help.

638
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,980
Believe me, I wish I could do more.

639
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:41,790
I've never seen Bree so happy. She's glowing.

640
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:46,110
She won't be glowing when that agency sinks her book. Lynette...

641
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:49,080
I'm telling you, the only thing staler than that ad campaign

642
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:52,440
Is this dinner roll. Yeah, and the water was as flat as the ad campaign.

643
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:55,400
Your Martini was as dry as the ad campaign. Let it go.

644
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:58,610
Hi, everybody! You having a good Time? Hi!

645
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,670
Hey, beautiful!

646
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:01,400
Um ,this is-- Stu!

647
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,250
Lynette Scavo. I thought that might be you. Hey!

648
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:08,720
Everyone, this is my old assistant,

649
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,920
Stu, um... Durber. Durber.

650
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:14,290
Hey! Well, this was one great guy.

651
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,830
He would schlep All the way across town

652
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,210
Just to get me my chinese food.

653
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,430
So...

654
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:22,250
What are you up to?

655
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:25,650
Actually, Stu's company is doing all my advertising.

656
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:31,260
Your company? You have a company?

657
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:33,130
Three years now. Huh.

658
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:35,620
How about you? Are you still at, uh, Parcher & Murphy?

659
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:38,770
No, i... Also went into business for myself.

660
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,860
Her place makes the best pizza in town.

661
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,210
You own a pizzeria?

662
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,920
Well, it's really my husband's.

663
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:47,090
And I'm still doing some freelance Stuff.

664
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,240
Well, that's great. You know, we're Always working late. Mm-hmm. Oh.

665
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:52,770

Bree, let me introduce you to some people. Yeah, mm. Great.

670
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,310
There's my beautiful wife.

671
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,370
What are you up to?

672
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,500
Why? Looking for a reason to scream at me?

673
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:26,100
You're right. I was awful the other day.

674
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,740
How about I make it up to you

675
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:30,230
By buying you mrs. Hudson's house?

676
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:33,540
Seriously? Well, I thought about it, and I agree.

677
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:35,380
It's a good investment opportunity.

678
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:37,540
Oh! Thank you!

679
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:41,360
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Thank you. Thank you.

680
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:46,550
And I promise that we'll rent that place out for top dollar.

681
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,290
Oh, I'm not worried about that.

682
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,920
But first... I want to do someone a favor.

683
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,870
Where are you? It's after 2:00.

684
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,820
I'm getting ready for my job interview.

685
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:05,190
Oh, that's not until 4:00.

686
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:07,420
I'm reading the company's annual reports.

687
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:08,590
I want to be prepared.

688
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:11,400
Oh, honey. Everybody's asking about you.

689
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:14,720
I want you to be here. It's my big day.

690
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:16,770
Well...

691
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,320
Enjoy it.

692
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:19,880
You've earned it.

693
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,320
You know what this tastes like? More.

694
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:35,540
It would seem

695
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:38,070
Somebody's taking their designated driver position...

696
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,670
A little lightly. Stu?

697
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:44,750
Stu is doing Bree's ad campaign?

698
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:47,590
I rode in his hatchback once.

699
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,900
It smelled like mu shu.

700
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:52,180
I gotta warn her. Oh, wait! No, honey.

701
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:54,010
Why don't you wait till after the ceremony?

702
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,590
Yeah, just until you can blink both eyes at the same Time.

703
00:34:56,970 --> 00:35:01,250
Guys, I am just gonna offer her a little advice. Geesh.

704
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,790
Whoop. Still waiting.

705
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,130
The great thing about the internet is that

706
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,400
With a minimal investment, you actually can reach

707
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:13,500
All your specific target audience-- coupons.

708
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:15,420
Coupons?

709
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:19,610
Do a cross-promotion with some of the major food companies.

710
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:22,200
Knock off 20%

711
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:25,900
On some of the items featured in your recipes,

712
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:27,950
Then they do the same

713
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,760
Towards the purchase of your cookbook.

714
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:33,050
Yeah, our research shows, you know,

715
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,640
People aren't so hot on gimmicks-- zip it, Stewie.

716
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:37,630
Would you excuse us, please?

717
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,830
Lynette, you're drunk.

718
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,070
Yeah, that's immaterial.

719
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:46,040
What do you think of the coupons?

720
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:49,280
Lynette, I am really not able to deal with that right now.

721
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,230
Oh. I know.

722
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:54,450
You've got your book and--and your big fancy award,

723
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,910
And I'm just a housewife.

724
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,570
I never said that.

725
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:00,880
You know, when I had a high-powered career,

726
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:04,700
And you were just a housewife, I never looked down on you.

727
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:07,510
If you could All please take your seats,

728
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,650
It's Time to present our award.

729
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:13,810
You need to leave now.

730
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,600
Fine. And don't worry.

731
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:20,900
Even though I'd like to, I'm not gonna make some big, ugly scene.

732
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,490
Hey. I, um, I bought m.J. So stilts,

733
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,010
Thought I'd teach him how to use 'em.

734
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:43,770
Har har. Uh, actually, he's at Juanita's watching a dvd.

735
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,790
Do you want me to call him?

736
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,820
No. No, it's cool. I just wanted to tell him about my new place.

737
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,720
You're moving again?

738
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,930
How far are you gonna be away now?

739
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,900
The Hudson house? Yeah, she sold it.

740
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:01,000
And Edie told me the new owner wants to rent it,

741
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,830
So now I'll have a fighting chance

742
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,980
Of being around when m.J. Hits his milestones.

743
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:08,810
Is this okay with you?

744
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:12,300
Yeah. It's great.

745
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,550
Uh, we'll be like...

746
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:18,260
One big, happy, divorced family.

747
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,060
You sure?

748
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,220
It's a little weird.

749
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:26,010
I--i but, you know, m.J. Will be thrilled, and...

750
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:27,920
Yeah, I'm fine with it.

751
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:29,980
Good.

752
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:31,670
So, um...

753
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,920
I'll see you around, neighbor.

754
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,550
I still think it's strange

755
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,600
You won't let me tell Mike that we're the new owners.

756
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:46,150
Well, the man's got a lot of pride.

757
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:49,180
I want him to feel like I'm his neighbor, not his landlord.

758
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:52,450
Landlord? Hell, with the rent we're charging him,

759
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,780
You're his fairy godmother.

760
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:57,730
All right, consider it an investment in good karma. Screw karma.

761
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,020
I finally do something nice in this neighbhood,

762
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:01,360
And I can't even brag about it?

763
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:06,010
The man who is silent in his good deeds

764
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,690
Is the man who reaps the greatest reward.

765
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:20,710
So...

766
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:21,930
Give me some guidance.

767
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:25,590
Do I grovel, send flowers, or...

768
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,350
Just move?

769
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,140
I'm not angry with you.

770
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,420
I'm just sorry that you felt so--

771
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:33,580
Drunk? Jealous?

772
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,890
You have nothing to be jealous of.

773
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,260
Don't give me that.

774
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:41,110
You are having the kind of success

775
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,840
I only dreamed of back in my ad days.

776
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:45,720
But that doesn't mean I look down on you.

777
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:50,030
No. But watching you, I look down on me.

778
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:53,890
When I held your book in my hands,

779
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:57,830
I felt so jealous my stomach hurt.

780
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:01,650
And I thought, if I could just hitch a ride,

781
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,180
Have a piece of it,

782
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:06,550
I wouldn't feel so bad about your success.

783
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,890
For god sakes, Lynette, stop calling me a success.

784
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,190
There's nothing successful about me.

785
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:17,950
My friends think I'm gonna drop them,

786
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,550
My partner resents me,

787
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,760
And my husband...

788
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,350
Has moved into the guest bedroom.

789
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:32,290
Everything I gain comes at some horrible price,

790
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:35,330
And I'm starting to wonder if any of it's even worth it.

791
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,380
It is.

792
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:42,920
You're at the start of an incredible journey,

793
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:46,450
And I am going to be there every step of the way,

794
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,410
Cheering you on,

795
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,500
Telling anyone who will listen

796
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:54,470
That the Bree Van De Kamp is my friend.

797
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,570
Thanks.

798
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:59,250
And the rest of the Stuff...

799
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,490
You'll find a wayto fix it.

800
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:08,140
Just know that All your friends are very proud of you.

801
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:13,230
Bitterly jealous, but proud.

802
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,550
If you look closely

803
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,950
Into the faces of those around you,

804
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:31,010
You will catch a glimpse

805
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:33,320
Of a certain Green-eyed monster.

806
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:41,730
And then you'll see they envy your career...

807
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:49,240
Your love life...

808
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:59,900
The Time you spend with their child...

809
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:10,190
How do you deal with such jealousy?

810
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,490
There are many ways.

811
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,610
But the best...

812
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:25,010
Is to simply share

813
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,550
What you have.

814
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,490
Thank you.

815
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:40,150
Promise me you'll never leave our bed again.

816
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,880
I promise...

817
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:44,520
Partner.
