00:00:00,859 --> 00:00:03,331
<i>Previously on...</i>

2
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:05,838
He's in your band.
- This is too dangerous.

3
00:00:05,906 --> 00:00:09,225
<i>There were victims</i>
<i>of both violence</i>

4
00:00:09,294 --> 00:00:12,037
<i>and hard times.</i>
- We're sort of broke.

5
00:00:12,106 --> 00:00:14,747
I thought Scavo's was doing well.
- When times get tough,

6
00:00:14,816 --> 00:00:16,847
people do without things
like pizza.

7
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:18,203
<i>And beneficiaries...</i>

8
00:00:18,271 --> 00:00:21,115
The deal closed. I got the bonus.
<i>- and good work...</i>

9
00:00:21,184 --> 00:00:22,674
<i>and perseverance.</i>

10
00:00:22,743 --> 00:00:25,007
Congratulations on your new job.

11
00:00:25,419 --> 00:00:27,857
Congratulations on getting me
out of your office.

12
00:00:32,838 --> 00:00:34,768
<i> It's not hard</i>

13
00:00:34,837 --> 00:00:37,545
<i>to spot a mother</i>
<i>who works outside the home.</i>

14
00:00:37,614 --> 00:00:41,848
<i>Just look for someone</i>
<i>who dresses in a hurry...</i>

15
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:46,421
<i>eats her breakfast</i>
<i>while rushing to her car...</i>

16
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:50,351
<i>and applies her makeup</i>
<i>as she drives away.</i>

17
00:00:50,419 --> 00:00:52,383
<i>But the surest way</i>

18
00:00:52,451 --> 00:00:55,737
<i>to spot a mother</i>
<i>who works outside the home?</i>

19
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:59,463
<i>Just look for a child...</i>
- M.J., why aren't you dressed?

20
00:00:59,532 --> 00:01:01,698
We're gonna be late
for our first day of school.

21
00:01:04,511 --> 00:01:08,372
<i>who gets sick</i>
<i>at the worst possible moment.</i>

22
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,709
Hey, guys. How you doing?

23
00:01:12,777 --> 00:01:14,910
He's sick. I'm late.
- Thanks for helping.

24
00:01:14,979 --> 00:01:17,654
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I gotta work.
- So do I,

25
00:01:17,723 --> 00:01:19,991
and it's my first day
at a new job. I win.

26
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,177
What...

27
00:01:21,246 --> 00:01:23,412
Look, I'd really like
to help you out...

28
00:01:23,482 --> 00:01:25,480
and spend some time
with my best bud, but, uh,

29
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:27,783
Ms. Nelson's septic tank
is expecting me at 9:00.

30
00:01:27,851 --> 00:01:30,629
You're a plumber. Ms. Nelson
is <i>not</i> expecting you on time.

31
00:01:30,697 --> 00:01:33,474
In fact, if you show up before
dinner, she'll turn cartwheels.

32
00:01:33,543 --> 00:01:36,591
I'm a teacher.
It's different.

33
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,538
Wait, I thought you were
just a teacher's assistant.

34
00:01:39,607 --> 00:01:41,164
Well...

35
00:01:44,214 --> 00:01:45,703
Listen to me.

36
00:01:45,771 --> 00:01:48,684
The whole reason I went back to
work is so we could both afford

37
00:01:48,753 --> 00:01:51,563
to give M.J. The things
we felt he needed.

38
00:01:51,633 --> 00:01:55,019
Now I'm doing my part.
It's time you do yours.

39
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:01,557
I'll reschedule Ms. Nelson.

40
00:02:04,946 --> 00:02:06,571
I gotta go.

41
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:09,585
You get lots of rest and drink
plenty of fluids, okay?

42
00:02:09,654 --> 00:02:12,330
You never left me
when I'm sick before.

43
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:14,836
Oh, I know, Honey.

44
00:02:14,905 --> 00:02:17,377
But mommy has a job now.

45
00:02:17,445 --> 00:02:21,002
Come on. We talked about this.
You understand, right?

46
00:02:22,357 --> 00:02:23,745
Don't be sad.

47
00:02:23,814 --> 00:02:27,235
I am gonna pick you both up
at 6:00.

48
00:02:29,167 --> 00:02:31,130
<i>Yes, it's not hard</i>

49
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:34,077
<i>to spot a mother</i>
<i>who works outside the home.</i>

50
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,770
<i>Just look for a woman</i>

51
00:02:37,839 --> 00:02:40,108
<i>who leaves her house</i>
<i>every morning</i>

52
00:02:40,176 --> 00:02:43,867
<i>feeling incredibly guilty.</i>

53
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:57,215
<i>It begins just after sundown,</i>

54
00:02:57,283 --> 00:02:59,451
<i>after a long day at the office,</i>

55
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,007
<i>exhausted people</i>
<i>start coming home.</i>

56
00:03:04,736 --> 00:03:08,564
<i>Some are met by faithful pets...</i>

57
00:03:08,632 --> 00:03:13,035
<i>Some are welcomed</i>
<i>with dry martinis.</i>

58
00:03:13,104 --> 00:03:18,218
<i>Others are greeted</i>
<i>with dinner on the table.</i>

59
00:03:20,861 --> 00:03:22,316
<i>Then there are those</i>

60
00:03:22,385 --> 00:03:25,671
<i>who return</i>
<i>from a long day at work...</i>

61
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,854
<i>only to discover...</i>

62
00:03:31,024 --> 00:03:33,563
<i>unpleasant surprises.</i>

63
00:03:37,325 --> 00:03:40,236
Oh! Good. You got my note.
Come on in.

64
00:03:40,306 --> 00:03:42,371
<i>Okay,</i> Sure.
Uh, where's M.J.?

65
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,539
Here I am, Mommy.

66
00:03:44,608 --> 00:03:48,503
Oh, hey, baby. How's my boy?

67
00:03:48,572 --> 00:03:51,551
I missed you so much.

68
00:03:51,621 --> 00:03:53,245
Are you feeling better?

69
00:03:53,314 --> 00:03:56,260
Yeah.
Katherine made me soup

70
00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:58,293
and read me a story

71
00:03:58,362 --> 00:04:01,578
and showed me
how to play blackjack.

72
00:04:01,647 --> 00:04:03,950
What are
you gonna remember?

73
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:07,303
Always double down
on a pair of aces.

74
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,472
That's cute.

75
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:10,962
Where's Mike?

76
00:04:11,031 --> 00:04:12,486
Plumbing emergency.

77
00:04:12,555 --> 00:04:14,519
Ms. Nelson's toilet
began erupting,

78
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:17,331
and I wasn't busy, so...

79
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,686
Uh-huh.

80
00:04:18,754 --> 00:04:21,837
Well, uh, thank you very much
for helping us out.

81
00:04:21,905 --> 00:04:24,242
Come on, M.J.
It's time to go.

82
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:31,728
thank you.

83
00:04:33,931 --> 00:04:36,775
We already thanked her,
buddy.

84
00:04:36,844 --> 00:04:39,012
Let's not
make her uncomfortable.

85
00:04:41,282 --> 00:04:43,686
Thank you
for having us over.

86
00:04:43,755 --> 00:04:45,685
We are so honored

87
00:04:45,754 --> 00:04:47,683
to be the first guests
in your new home.

88
00:04:47,752 --> 00:04:50,427
Your <i>stunning</i> new home.
I can't believe this.

89
00:04:50,496 --> 00:04:53,174
The theme of my first place
was Early American beanbag.

90
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:55,475
Well, it's all Andrew.

91
00:04:55,543 --> 00:04:57,744
He's the one with the taste.
Please.

92
00:04:57,813 --> 00:05:00,488
Uh, he's running late.

93
00:05:00,557 --> 00:05:02,724
Um, do you know why?

94
00:05:02,793 --> 00:05:05,265
Ah, he's cleaning up
a little mess.

95
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,263
Someone didn't know
you couldn't serve

96
00:05:07,332 --> 00:05:09,397
bacon-wrapped shrimp puffs
at a Bar Mitzvah.

97
00:05:09,466 --> 00:05:12,040
I knew. I just thought
if they'd tasted mine,

98
00:05:12,109 --> 00:05:14,039
they might change the rules.

99
00:05:14,107 --> 00:05:17,257
So would you like something
to nibble on before dinner?

100
00:05:17,325 --> 00:05:19,594
Is that cut crystal?

101
00:05:19,663 --> 00:05:21,424
It's exquisite.

102
00:05:21,492 --> 00:05:23,422
Andrew again.
He's got expensive taste.

103
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:25,489
Thank God he brings in
the big bucks.

104
00:05:25,557 --> 00:05:27,318
He does?

105
00:05:27,387 --> 00:05:30,943
Well, he does now, ever since
you gave him that raise.

106
00:05:31,011 --> 00:05:33,992
That is a delicious snack.

107
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,855
Did you make this?

108
00:05:35,924 --> 00:05:37,853
Uh, yeah. It's just...

109
00:05:37,922 --> 00:05:39,208
party mix.

110
00:05:39,277 --> 00:05:40,936
Oh.

111
00:05:41,005 --> 00:05:44,053
You gave Andrew a raise?
- A tiny salary bump.

112
00:05:44,121 --> 00:05:46,898
"Tiny" is not the word for
your extraordinary generosity.

113
00:05:48,966 --> 00:05:52,453
Oh, look!
There's pretzels and cereal.

114
00:05:52,522 --> 00:05:54,723
I can see why
they call it "party mix."

115
00:05:54,792 --> 00:05:56,722
It's like a party in a bowl.

116
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,958
When you say "extraordinary"--
He's exaggerating.

117
00:05:59,027 --> 00:06:00,550
They're children.

118
00:06:00,619 --> 00:06:02,616
It just looks like
a lot of money to them.

119
00:06:07,292 --> 00:06:10,205
My God!
Is this a... '96 Latour?

120
00:06:10,273 --> 00:06:13,321
I know. Andrew bought
a case of it at a wine auction

121
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:16,167
to celebrate that huge raise.

122
00:06:16,236 --> 00:06:18,673
Once you've had
a few glasses of this,

123
00:06:18,742 --> 00:06:21,417
you're not going to remember
this evening at all.

124
00:06:22,739 --> 00:06:24,229
We'll see.

125
00:06:26,195 --> 00:06:29,683
Boy,
dinner without the kids...

126
00:06:29,752 --> 00:06:32,698
It's nice to eat without
having macaroni thrown at you.

127
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,188
Yes.

128
00:06:34,257 --> 00:06:36,187
Well, we, uh, we really
wanted to find a way

129
00:06:36,256 --> 00:06:38,185
to thank you both.
- Thank us for what?

130
00:06:38,254 --> 00:06:40,184
Saving our marriage.

131
00:06:40,253 --> 00:06:43,978
Please. It was our pleasure.
How did we do that again?

132
00:06:44,047 --> 00:06:46,418
Well, Bradley had been
working around the clock,

133
00:06:46,521 --> 00:06:48,383
and I was feeling neglected.

134
00:06:48,452 --> 00:06:50,415
But things are different
now that he has Carlos.

135
00:06:50,484 --> 00:06:52,413
We have never felt closer.

136
00:06:52,482 --> 00:06:55,327
And, Gaby, I know I've been
relying on Carlos a lot.

137
00:06:55,396 --> 00:06:57,393
I-I hope it's not a problem, his
being away from home so much.

138
00:06:57,462 --> 00:06:59,392
Oh, I'll be
more willing to forgive

139
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:01,391
once his bonus check comes in.
- And the only person

140
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:04,372
more excited than Gaby
about that bonus is her jeweler.

141
00:07:06,101 --> 00:07:08,031
Brad, don't.
It's been such a nice night.

142
00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:10,165
He's gonna hear it tomorrow anyway.

143
00:07:10,233 --> 00:07:12,333
Hear what?

144
00:07:12,402 --> 00:07:14,129
Look, I'm sorry,

145
00:07:14,197 --> 00:07:16,127
but we're forgoing bonuses
this year.

146
00:07:16,196 --> 00:07:19,006
Can I get anyone dessert?

147
00:07:19,075 --> 00:07:21,512
Beat it. What?

148
00:07:21,581 --> 00:07:23,071
It's the economy.

149
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,374
Um, our C.F.O. feels we need
to do some belt tightening.

150
00:07:25,444 --> 00:07:28,593
But do you know how much
overtime Carlos has pulled?

151
00:07:28,662 --> 00:07:31,845
How many trips he's taken?
He's killed himself.

152
00:07:31,914 --> 00:07:34,521
For God sakes,
don't do this to my jeweler.

153
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:38,484
But, Gaby, no one's getting
a bonus, not even Brad.

154
00:07:38,554 --> 00:07:42,007
So <i>this</i> was his bonus? A salad
and a stuffed chicken breast?

155
00:07:42,076 --> 00:07:44,853
Look, hopefully next year
will be better.

156
00:07:46,684 --> 00:07:48,682
We're ready for dessert now.

157
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,087
Wrap up ten lobsters to go.

158
00:07:53,831 --> 00:07:56,709
Ahem.

159
00:07:56,778 --> 00:08:00,199
Tom?

160
00:08:00,268 --> 00:08:01,791
Come here.

161
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,806
We haven't had a customer
in about a half an hour,

162
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:06,805
so maybe we should just...

163
00:08:06,873 --> 00:08:08,532
close up early.

164
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:15,273
No. I got an idea.

165
00:08:15,342 --> 00:08:17,780
Hey, everybody, hey,
take off your aprons

166
00:08:17,849 --> 00:08:20,321
and come sit near the window.

167
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:23,065
What is this?
- It's called psychology.

168
00:08:23,133 --> 00:08:26,385
Come on! Hey! Guys...

169
00:08:26,453 --> 00:08:29,536
Nobody wants to eat
in an empty restaurant, right?

170
00:08:29,604 --> 00:08:32,212
So, guys, this is
what we are gonna do.

171
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,379
As soon as you see
someone go by,

172
00:08:34,448 --> 00:08:36,548
you laugh, act like
you're having a great time.

173
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:39,055
It'll draw them in.

174
00:08:39,123 --> 00:08:41,053
So now we have
pretend customers?

175
00:08:41,122 --> 00:08:43,052
Gee, let's think
of something to do

176
00:08:43,121 --> 00:08:44,101
with all the pretend money
we're gonna make.

177
00:08:44,171 --> 00:08:46,236
Trust me. This is gonna work.

178
00:08:46,305 --> 00:08:47,895
Okay, hey, you guys,

179
00:08:47,965 --> 00:08:49,928
you're a group
of old high school buddies.

180
00:08:49,997 --> 00:08:51,995
You haven't seen each other
since the big game.

181
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:53,993
And you two--
you're on a hot date, okay?

182
00:08:54,062 --> 00:08:55,653
All right.

183
00:08:55,722 --> 00:08:58,161
Hey, look! There's somebody!
Laugh! Have a great time.

184
00:09:02,192 --> 00:09:05,004
Awesome. Just like that.

185
00:09:05,072 --> 00:09:08,390
<i>Okay...</i>

186
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:10,897
As much as I love
Tommy Scavo's improv theater,

187
00:09:10,966 --> 00:09:13,879
we need to face some facts here.
- It's a slump.

188
00:09:13,947 --> 00:09:16,148
We--we--we--we'll ride it out.
We've done it before.

189
00:09:16,217 --> 00:09:17,842
We--
- It's not a slump.

190
00:09:17,911 --> 00:09:20,146
In this economy, people aren't
eating out as much.

191
00:09:20,214 --> 00:09:22,653
Between that
and Porter's legal bills

192
00:09:22,721 --> 00:09:24,143
and paying Bree back,

193
00:09:24,212 --> 00:09:26,683
we are about a week away
from going bankrupt.

194
00:09:28,751 --> 00:09:30,918
Honey, please, have a little faith.

195
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,951
I did, for seven years.

196
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:36,406
Now I'm gonna be a realist,
and I need you to be one, too.

197
00:09:36,474 --> 00:09:39,455
Okay, I understand.
You're worried. I am, too.

198
00:09:39,523 --> 00:09:42,436
But we can make it.
We just have to be creative.

199
00:09:42,505 --> 00:09:44,469
But--
if we sell this place now,

200
00:09:44,538 --> 00:09:46,535
We can escape with some dignity
and maybe even some money.

201
00:09:46,604 --> 00:09:49,041
But if we keep on going
like we are,

202
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,904
We're gonna lose everything.

203
00:09:50,973 --> 00:09:53,886
No!

204
00:09:53,954 --> 00:09:57,002
No.

205
00:09:57,071 --> 00:09:59,170
I am not going out
like this.

206
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,170
I am not gonna be
a failure.

207
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:09,604
Please tell me they just saw a customer.

208
00:10:10,405 --> 00:10:12,335
So with all the calories
we just burned,

209
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:15,858
I say we deserve a huge lunch
at a fancy restaurant.

210
00:10:15,927 --> 00:10:17,857
You do like to live well, Honey.

211
00:10:17,926 --> 00:10:20,838
Well, why not? Life is brief
and mostly sucks.

212
00:10:20,907 --> 00:10:22,837
Gotta grab
all the good you can

213
00:10:22,906 --> 00:10:24,836
while you're
on this side of the dirt.

214
00:10:24,904 --> 00:10:26,360
That was very poetic.

215
00:10:26,429 --> 00:10:29,781
But sure,
we'll go any place you want.

216
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,780
Mmm! That was easy.

217
00:10:31,848 --> 00:10:34,287
Well, since I'm on a roll,
how about this?

218
00:10:34,356 --> 00:10:36,286
Let's go away this weekend--

219
00:10:36,354 --> 00:10:40,520
pick a five-star hotel with
a great spa and just live it up.

220
00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:42,281
I don't know about that.

221
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,296
I've got a lot of stuff
I need to do.

222
00:10:45,365 --> 00:10:46,956
Oh, come on.

223
00:10:47,025 --> 00:10:50,107
Big fluffy robes,
long massages.

224
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,969
Do you hear that?

225
00:10:54,038 --> 00:10:56,577
That buzzing.

226
00:10:58,001 --> 00:10:59,694
Uh... No, I don't hear anything.

227
00:10:59,763 --> 00:11:01,693
Oh, maybe it--it's--
- Shh! Shh!

228
00:11:03,218 --> 00:11:05,148
I hear it up here sometimes.

229
00:11:07,215 --> 00:11:10,432
What the hell is it?

230
00:11:10,501 --> 00:11:13,413
Hey, you know what?

231
00:11:13,482 --> 00:11:15,412
I kind of like that hotel idea.

232
00:11:15,481 --> 00:11:17,376
Really?

233
00:11:17,446 --> 00:11:20,154
Yeah. You were right.
Life is brief.

234
00:11:20,223 --> 00:11:23,339
Why don't you go call the travel
agent and see what's available?

235
00:11:23,408 --> 00:11:26,896
You know, you're kinda sexy
when you buckle.

236
00:11:26,965 --> 00:11:29,402
I'm gonna call right now.

237
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:49,322
Dr. Heller?
Listen, I got your latest text,

238
00:11:49,391 --> 00:11:51,828
but you know,
it's been a few weeks now,

239
00:11:51,897 --> 00:11:54,809
and people are freaking out
about you being gone so long.

240
00:11:54,878 --> 00:11:56,842
So now there's a staff meeting
on the 15th,

241
00:11:56,911 --> 00:11:59,044
and if you're not back by then,
I'm just gonna

242
00:11:59,113 --> 00:12:01,550
have to tell people
that I don't know where you are.

243
00:12:01,619 --> 00:12:03,617
So will you please just call me?

244
00:12:09,072 --> 00:12:11,816
Hey, Mike. How's it going?

245
00:12:11,884 --> 00:12:13,882
Well, so far, I've broken off

246
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,846
three of these stupid
plastic sprinkler heads.

247
00:12:15,915 --> 00:12:18,015
But other than that, I'm great.

248
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:20,047
Well, good.
Look, I was coming over to ask,

249
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:22,905
what would you and Katherine
think about going camping?

250
00:12:22,906 --> 00:12:24,450
Oh, man, I love camping. When?

251
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:26,449
Well, my schedule
gets busy on the 15th,

252
00:12:26,518 --> 00:12:28,482
so it would have to be
before then.

253
00:12:28,551 --> 00:12:31,497
I don't know, this weekend?
- Oh, I'm definitely up for it.

254
00:12:31,565 --> 00:12:33,936
Uh, I'm not sure
if Katherine will be.

255
00:12:34,005 --> 00:12:36,985
Well, if she doesn't go,
then Edie won't go, and...

256
00:12:37,054 --> 00:12:39,694
Well, I guess if Katherine
knows another girl's coming,

257
00:12:39,763 --> 00:12:41,070
maybe I can convince her.

258
00:12:41,071 --> 00:12:43,997
Good. Tell her the menfolk
will do all the hard work--

259
00:12:44,066 --> 00:12:45,995
Build the fires,
dig the latrines.

260
00:12:46,064 --> 00:12:48,028
Hey, I wouldn't mention
that, uh, latrine part

261
00:12:48,097 --> 00:12:50,230
until we're actually
<i>at</i> the campsite.

262
00:12:50,299 --> 00:12:51,991
That's a good point.

263
00:12:52,094 --> 00:12:55,346
I'll, uh, dig my gear out
tonight. It's gonna be fun.

264
00:12:55,414 --> 00:12:57,344
Yeah.

265
00:12:57,413 --> 00:13:00,189
This <i>is</i> gonna be fun.

266
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:04,526
My, that's a beautiful pen

267
00:13:04,595 --> 00:13:06,558
Is it a Montblanc?

268
00:13:06,627 --> 00:13:09,573
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I've always wanted one.
- Ah.

269
00:13:09,641 --> 00:13:13,062
Well, I guess you can afford it
now with your new raise.

270
00:13:13,131 --> 00:13:16,213
Oh, you heard about that?
- I sure did.

271
00:13:17,265 --> 00:13:19,058
Well, the Chamber of
Commerce just called.

272
00:13:19,127 --> 00:13:21,125
They've added 40 people
to their guest list.

273
00:13:21,193 --> 00:13:23,632
Damn it.
I only planned for a hundred.

274
00:13:23,701 --> 00:13:26,646
W-we're gonna need tables.
- Relax. They always pull this crap.

275
00:13:26,715 --> 00:13:28,678
So I called the rental company

276
00:13:28,748 --> 00:13:31,626
and had 'em put a few extras
on the truck. We'll be fine.

277
00:13:31,695 --> 00:13:33,625
Oh, thank God.
- But you know what?

278
00:13:33,694 --> 00:13:35,624
We can tell the Chamber people

279
00:13:35,692 --> 00:13:37,622
That because it was
so last-minute,

280
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:41,111
we had to bump our fee by 30%.
- I like the way you think.

281
00:13:41,214 --> 00:13:43,788
Ohh. What would we do
without him?

282
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:47,277
Hmm, yes. He's worth
every penny you pay him.

283
00:13:47,346 --> 00:13:50,833
By the way...
how many pennies is that?

284
00:13:50,902 --> 00:13:53,205
I'm not discussing
Andrew's salary with you.

285
00:13:53,274 --> 00:13:55,136
It's none of your business.

286
00:13:55,205 --> 00:13:57,202
You're right. It's not.

287
00:13:57,271 --> 00:13:58,862
So... How much?

288
00:13:58,931 --> 00:14:00,861
Andrew moved into a new home.

289
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:03,842
I simply gave him
a cost of living increase.

290
00:14:03,911 --> 00:14:05,841
The cost of living in a home

291
00:14:05,909 --> 00:14:08,313
with silver pens
and rare French wines?

292
00:14:08,382 --> 00:14:10,888
Honey, please don't do this.

293
00:14:10,957 --> 00:14:13,835
Oh, my God.
Is he making more than me?

294
00:14:13,904 --> 00:14:15,325
Orson, drop it.

295
00:14:15,394 --> 00:14:18,849
I am not telling you
how much Andrew makes.

296
00:14:21,492 --> 00:14:23,931
I'd be happy to give you
that information, sir.

297
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:26,640
Am I speaking
to the account holder?

298
00:14:26,709 --> 00:14:29,689
No, I'm her...
business partner.

299
00:14:29,758 --> 00:14:31,687
Very well. Account number?

300
00:14:31,756 --> 00:14:34,736
Yes. Um, 8-5-9-7-3.

301
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:37,887
Name on the account?

302
00:14:37,955 --> 00:14:40,428
Van de Kamp's
old-fashioned foods.

303
00:14:40,497 --> 00:14:42,596
And the password?

304
00:14:42,664 --> 00:14:44,087
Password?

305
00:14:44,155 --> 00:14:46,221
For security purses.

306
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,982
Um...

307
00:14:48,051 --> 00:14:51,878
Oh. Yes. Of course.
It's, um...

308
00:14:51,947 --> 00:14:53,707
Uh, you know...

309
00:14:53,776 --> 00:14:55,841
Uh, it's--it's completely
slipped my mind.

310
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:59,331
It's the name
of her childhood pet.

311
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,600
Oh. Right.

312
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:03,497
Uh...

313
00:15:03,566 --> 00:15:04,852
Fluffy.

314
00:15:04,921 --> 00:15:06,512
Nope. That's not it.

315
00:15:06,581 --> 00:15:07,630
Fido?

316
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:08,985
No.

317
00:15:09,054 --> 00:15:10,814
Spot? Rover?

318
00:15:10,883 --> 00:15:12,000
Mittens?

319
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:13,186
Sorry, sir.

320
00:15:13,254 --> 00:15:14,676
Uh, Marmaduke.

321
00:15:14,745 --> 00:15:16,403
Old Yeller.

322
00:15:16,472 --> 00:15:18,402
I cannot give out
you information

323
00:15:18,471 --> 00:15:21,689
without the password,
which you obviously don't know.

324
00:15:21,757 --> 00:15:23,687
Then ask me
a different question.

325
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,600
How about her date of birth?
Her social security number?

326
00:15:26,669 --> 00:15:27,582
Good-bye, sir.

327
00:15:27,651 --> 00:15:29,615
How about
her real hair color?

328
00:15:29,684 --> 00:15:32,122
Trust me, it's not
what you think it is.

329
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:40,456
If you're looking to get fed,
it's gonna be a while.

330
00:15:40,525 --> 00:15:42,454
No, Dad called a family meeting.

331
00:15:42,523 --> 00:15:45,367
Yeah, Mom, he said
it's about the restaurant.

332
00:15:45,436 --> 00:15:50,144
Oh, boy. I think I know
what this is about.

333
00:15:50,212 --> 00:15:51,939
Listen, kids,

334
00:15:52,008 --> 00:15:55,327
things have been tough
down at the restaurant,

335
00:15:55,396 --> 00:15:58,612
and i think your dad
has finally decided to sell it.

336
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,425
Wow.

337
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:02,814
I know.

338
00:16:02,883 --> 00:16:04,846
Is he gonna be okay?

339
00:16:04,915 --> 00:16:07,860
I don't know. That's why we all
have to be really supportive.

340
00:16:07,929 --> 00:16:10,944
Are you with me?

341
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:12,434
Hey, guys.

342
00:16:12,503 --> 00:16:14,433
Good. You're all here.

343
00:16:14,501 --> 00:16:16,431
I love you, Daddy.

344
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,498
Not yet.

345
00:16:18,566 --> 00:16:23,037
So... I wanted to talk
to you all about our pizzeria.

346
00:16:23,106 --> 00:16:25,104
Just know we're 100% behind you.

347
00:16:25,173 --> 00:16:26,492
That means a lot,

348
00:16:26,561 --> 00:16:29,846
'cause this was
a really rough day for me.

349
00:16:29,915 --> 00:16:32,624
I had to let
all our employees go.

350
00:16:32,693 --> 00:16:36,046
So starting tomorrow...

351
00:16:36,114 --> 00:16:39,331
you kids are my new waitstaff.

352
00:16:46,955 --> 00:16:49,867
Tom, what the hell
are you talking about?

353
00:16:49,936 --> 00:16:52,847
I got it all worked out.
You and I will handle the days,

354
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:56,438
and the kids will join us after
school and on the weekends.

355
00:16:56,507 --> 00:16:59,420
Um, at the risk
of sounding spoiled... no.

356
00:16:59,488 --> 00:17:02,739
Come on! It'll be fantastic.
We'll love working together.

357
00:17:02,808 --> 00:17:05,111
Why? We don't even like
<i>living</i> together.

358
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,279
Look,
labor is our number one cost.

359
00:17:07,347 --> 00:17:10,395
If we can eliminate it, we'll
start making a profit again.

360
00:17:10,464 --> 00:17:12,394
What, you're not even
gonna pay us?

361
00:17:12,463 --> 00:17:14,969
I'm 9! Is that even legal?

362
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:16,629
I think so.

363
00:17:16,698 --> 00:17:19,746
But just to be safe,
you're now 15. Happy birthday!

364
00:17:19,814 --> 00:17:22,421
Mom, <i>please</i> do something.

365
00:17:29,502 --> 00:17:31,432
I ought maybe
after our conversation today,

366
00:17:31,501 --> 00:17:33,431
you'd realize
it's time to pack it in.

367
00:17:33,499 --> 00:17:36,446
I have got to do this. I can't
walk away from that place

368
00:17:36,515 --> 00:17:39,461
until I have done everything
that I can possibly think of.

369
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:42,476
But having the kids work there?
- You said that you were behind me 100%.

370
00:17:42,544 --> 00:17:44,745
Really?
That doesn't sound like me.

371
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:46,066
Lynette...

372
00:17:46,135 --> 00:17:47,693
Okay. Fine.

373
00:17:52,267 --> 00:17:55,179
Kids, we are going
to support your father

374
00:17:55,248 --> 00:17:57,822
by working
in his restaurant.

375
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,836
You've got to be kidding me.

376
00:18:00,905 --> 00:18:03,851
Just so you know,
30 years from now,

377
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,867
when you and Dad are old and feeble--
- You're putting us

378
00:18:06,935 --> 00:18:09,272
in the cheapest nursing home
you can find.

379
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,864
Yeah, I got it.

380
00:18:17,132 --> 00:18:19,536
Mrs. Solis,
I didn't realize you were here.

381
00:18:19,604 --> 00:18:21,569
I've got your bracelet
I polished

382
00:18:21,637 --> 00:18:24,075
and ready for a night
on the town.

383
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:26,615
Oh, put it on
and have a good time.

384
00:18:26,684 --> 00:18:30,444
Turns out I'm not gonna be
able to afford it right now...

385
00:18:30,512 --> 00:18:32,442
unless you can help me out
on the price.

386
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:35,085
What did you have in mind?

387
00:18:35,154 --> 00:18:37,084
You give it to me,

388
00:18:37,152 --> 00:18:40,776
and then call your insurance
and say it was stolen?

389
00:18:42,606 --> 00:18:44,536
I didn't think so.

390
00:18:44,605 --> 00:18:48,059
I'm really sorry about
the bracelet, Mrs. Solis.

391
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:50,668
Perhaps I can show you something
a bit less expensive.

392
00:18:50,736 --> 00:18:54,360
Maybe some, uh, earrings--
- Oh, will you excuse me a minute?

393
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,798
Ah!

394
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:18,539
Carlos! Get in Here!

395
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,244
I got a real shockeroo
for you!

396
00:19:22,313 --> 00:19:25,328
You are not gonna
believe this!

397
00:19:27,564 --> 00:19:30,341
Brad! Hi.

398
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,001
Uh, what's going on?

399
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,507
He just stopped by
with great news.

400
00:19:34,577 --> 00:19:36,540
I'm getting that bonus
after all.

401
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:38,945
Really?

402
00:19:39,014 --> 00:19:40,978
Well, I went to our C.F.O.,

403
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:42,977
And I told him
it just didn't seem fair

404
00:19:43,045 --> 00:19:45,415
that my right-hand man
should go unrewarded.

405
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:47,922
Isn't that great?
What kind of guy does that?

406
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:52,868
Oh, I think I know the kind.

407
00:19:54,631 --> 00:19:56,154
So, Brad...

408
00:19:56,223 --> 00:19:58,966
What sort of bonus
are we looking at?

409
00:19:59,034 --> 00:20:01,947
How does 20 grand sound?

410
00:20:02,016 --> 00:20:04,656
Like a great jumping off point.

411
00:20:04,726 --> 00:20:06,588
Gaby.

412
00:20:06,657 --> 00:20:09,230
Oh, honey, you heard Maria
the other night.

413
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:12,990
Your hard work is what's
brought them <i>so much</i> closer.

414
00:20:16,447 --> 00:20:18,377
Pay no attention to my wife.

415
00:20:18,446 --> 00:20:21,154
20 grand is a fantastic bonus.

416
00:20:21,223 --> 00:20:23,796
You know, now that I hear
the number out loud,

417
00:20:23,865 --> 00:20:27,184
it does seem a little low,
after all you've done.

418
00:20:27,253 --> 00:20:29,521
25 is probably more fair.

419
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:32,977
Oh, Brad. Come on.
Saving a marriage?

420
00:20:33,046 --> 00:20:34,975
You can't put price on that...

421
00:20:35,044 --> 00:20:37,076
at least not a small one.

422
00:20:37,145 --> 00:20:39,955
Gaby, will you knock it off?

423
00:20:40,024 --> 00:20:41,548
You're being rude.

424
00:20:41,616 --> 00:20:43,682
You're right. I'm sorry.

425
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,595
It's just--I really wanted
to buy this bracelet I saw today

426
00:20:46,664 --> 00:20:48,729
downtown in this little jewelry shop.

427
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:50,694
You know the place, honey.

428
00:20:50,762 --> 00:20:53,031
It's right next to the,
um...

429
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,623
<i>Lexington hotel.</i>

430
00:20:54,692 --> 00:20:57,842
30!

431
00:20:57,911 --> 00:20:59,264
$30,000.

432
00:21:03,974 --> 00:21:05,904
Are you sure?

433
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:09,122
Yes! You deserve it.
You both do.

434
00:21:10,682 --> 00:21:12,883
I don't know what to say.

435
00:21:14,374 --> 00:21:16,304
You're the only one
getting a bonus,

436
00:21:16,373 --> 00:21:18,641
so what I think
might be best is

437
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:22,435
if we all agreed
not to say anything.

438
00:21:22,504 --> 00:21:24,095
Do we all agree?

439
00:21:24,164 --> 00:21:26,128
Absolutely.

440
00:21:28,534 --> 00:21:31,480
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'll leave you two to business.

441
00:21:31,549 --> 00:21:34,329
All this negotiating just
goes right over my head.

442
00:21:44,016 --> 00:21:45,538
Ha!

443
00:21:45,607 --> 00:21:48,655
Thunder McFadden.
What a hoot.

444
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,349
What's that?

445
00:21:50,418 --> 00:21:53,093
Oh, it's my porn name.

446
00:21:53,162 --> 00:21:55,397
Friend sent me an e-mail.

447
00:21:55,466 --> 00:21:57,361
You take the name
of your childhood pet

448
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:59,394
and the street you grew up on,
and voilà!

449
00:21:59,463 --> 00:22:02,409
That's the name you'd use
if you were a porn star.

450
00:22:02,478 --> 00:22:04,238
So I'm Thunder McFadden.

451
00:22:04,306 --> 00:22:06,439
My buddy here is
Snoop Windemere.

452
00:22:06,508 --> 00:22:08,710
Mm.

453
00:22:08,779 --> 00:22:11,386
Hey, who would you be?

454
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,621
Orson, I'm preparing
a buffet for 200.

455
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,654
I don't have time to explore

456
00:22:15,723 --> 00:22:18,466
my hypothetical career
in the adult film industry.

457
00:22:18,534 --> 00:22:21,142
Fine.

458
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:24,123
But you should know that's
why people find you so rigid,

459
00:22:24,192 --> 00:22:29,306
because you can never
just let go and have fun.

460
00:22:31,238 --> 00:22:34,015
Coco Saugatuck. Happy now?

461
00:22:34,084 --> 00:22:36,793
Sure am.

462
00:22:36,862 --> 00:22:39,841
Thanks, hon.

463
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:42,952
Of course it could just
easily be Munchy Cedarhurst.

464
00:22:42,953 --> 00:22:43,296
What?

465
00:22:43,365 --> 00:22:45,430
Or Taffy Swallow.

466
00:22:45,499 --> 00:22:48,649
We moved around lot
and had three dogs.

467
00:22:48,718 --> 00:22:50,716
Bree, focus.

468
00:22:50,784 --> 00:22:52,951
It has to be your favorite pet.

469
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,560
Like if I asked you,
"what's your childhood pet?"

470
00:22:55,629 --> 00:22:59,354
This is the one you'd say.
- Well, I didn't really have a favorite.

471
00:22:59,423 --> 00:23:00,539
I loved them all equally.

472
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,504
Oh, please. If Coco,
Taffy and Munchy were

473
00:23:02,573 --> 00:23:05,074
in a burning building and
you could only save one...

474
00:23:05,075 --> 00:23:06,772
Orson, why are
you being so morbid?

475
00:23:06,841 --> 00:23:09,516
No. I-I just want
to know your porn name.

476
00:23:09,585 --> 00:23:11,041
Okay, fine.

477
00:23:11,109 --> 00:23:14,395
If I had to pick a favorite,
I guess it would be Munchy.

478
00:23:14,464 --> 00:23:16,901
She was a bit rambunctious.

479
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:19,882
Father sent her to a farm
so she'd have room to run.

480
00:23:19,951 --> 00:23:22,287
I cried for weeks and weeks.

481
00:23:22,356 --> 00:23:25,201
Munchy, huh? This was fun.

482
00:23:28,048 --> 00:23:30,858
All right, that's
a large mushroom pepperoni pizza

483
00:23:30,927 --> 00:23:32,959
and two salads.
I'll get that started.

484
00:23:33,028 --> 00:23:34,145
Tom, I got
need a large--

485
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:36,380
Large pep/mush at table nine.
I'm way ahead of you.

486
00:23:36,449 --> 00:23:38,819
Thanks. And do you have
the calzones for table three?

487
00:23:38,888 --> 00:23:42,444
Oh, crap.
Setie, I need two dinner salads.

488
00:23:42,512 --> 00:23:43,609
What's the matter?

489
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:46,780
Parker said the only
reason you had me make salads

490
00:23:46,848 --> 00:23:48,813
is because
it's a job for babies.

491
00:23:48,881 --> 00:23:51,624
Well, clearly, that's not true
because you're not a baby.

492
00:23:51,693 --> 00:23:55,656
You're <i>15,</i> remember?
- Also, I can't find my band-aid.

493
00:23:55,724 --> 00:23:59,212
Okay, you fill water glasses.
I'll make the salads.

494
00:23:59,281 --> 00:24:01,448
Hey, Mom?
- Yeah?

495
00:24:01,517 --> 00:24:03,209
This is for table five.

496
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:04,802
Oh, thanks.

497
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:05,987
Yeah.

498
00:24:06,056 --> 00:24:09,679
Uh... you didn't give them
enough change.

499
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:11,678
Yeah, I know.
I figured this out.

500
00:24:11,747 --> 00:24:14,456
You can short people 1%,
and they won't even notice.

501
00:24:14,525 --> 00:24:15,978
If they got a buzz on, 3%.

502
00:24:15,979 --> 00:24:18,995
Okay, you make the salads.
I'll handle the register.

503
00:24:19,064 --> 00:24:21,943
Dude, back off.
That's my table.

504
00:24:22,012 --> 00:24:24,416
Not anymore. You can take
the 4-top of old farts.

505
00:24:24,485 --> 00:24:26,448
No way. I--
- What's going on?

506
00:24:26,517 --> 00:24:27,394
He took my table.

507
00:24:27,395 --> 00:24:29,768
So? Take another one.
What's the difference?

508
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:37,594
Well, since I'm the only one
here who can wait on that table

509
00:24:37,662 --> 00:24:40,235
without knocking over a glass
with my pants,

510
00:24:40,305 --> 00:24:42,268
how about I take it?

511
00:24:42,337 --> 00:24:45,385
You handle the cash register.
You bus tables. Go on.

512
00:24:45,454 --> 00:24:47,485
Well, look at this.

513
00:24:47,553 --> 00:24:49,585
Everybody's happy.

514
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:51,110
Things are running smoothly.

515
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:54,734
Don't worry. I'm not gonna say,
"I told you so."

516
00:24:59,411 --> 00:25:01,848
Hey. Katherine said
you wanted to talk to me.

517
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:04,084
Yeah. Come on in.

518
00:25:04,153 --> 00:25:06,083
You know, you could have
just called.

519
00:25:06,152 --> 00:25:08,793
You don't have to use her
as an intermediary.

520
00:25:08,862 --> 00:25:10,792
Really? I thought
we were using Katherine

521
00:25:10,861 --> 00:25:12,926
for all sorts of things--
sending messages,

522
00:25:12,995 --> 00:25:14,958
raising our kid.

523
00:25:15,027 --> 00:25:16,957
I don't see
what the big deal is.

524
00:25:17,025 --> 00:25:19,667
I have to work,
and she has some free time.

525
00:25:19,736 --> 00:25:22,310
It's better for everybody.
Well, it's not better for me,

526
00:25:22,378 --> 00:25:24,782
especially when
I'm not even told about it.

527
00:25:24,851 --> 00:25:27,153
Fine. Here I am telling you.

528
00:25:27,223 --> 00:25:29,186
I have to work Friday,

529
00:25:29,255 --> 00:25:32,404
so Katherine will be
picking M.J. up from school.

530
00:25:32,473 --> 00:25:34,572
No.

531
00:25:34,641 --> 00:25:37,350
What do you mean, "no"?

532
00:25:37,419 --> 00:25:40,060
Let me remind you,
I have custody on Fridays.

533
00:25:40,128 --> 00:25:42,025
Hey, thanks.
Let me remind you

534
00:25:42,094 --> 00:25:44,057
that the reason
I agreed to custody is

535
00:25:44,127 --> 00:25:46,564
so our son could spend time
with his father.

536
00:25:46,633 --> 00:25:49,037
You have a problem with Katherine?

537
00:25:49,106 --> 00:25:50,561
No, she's a peach,

538
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:53,068
but she's not the one
that dragged me to court

539
00:25:53,137 --> 00:25:55,473
to hammer out
some custody agreement.

540
00:25:55,542 --> 00:25:57,743
Now if you'd like,
we can go back,

541
00:25:57,812 --> 00:25:59,742
and the judge can explain to you

542
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:02,203
the difference between
you and your girlfriend.

543
00:26:02,204 --> 00:26:03,400
Okay, you listen to me.

544
00:26:03,469 --> 00:26:05,467
Mommy?

545
00:26:05,535 --> 00:26:07,330
Are you guys fighting?

546
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,701
No, sweetie.

547
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:13,834
We are just trying to figure out
what is best for you.

548
00:26:13,903 --> 00:26:16,781
Aren't we?

549
00:26:20,001 --> 00:26:21,931
I'll see you Friday, buddy.

550
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,454
Looks like I'll be
picking you up from school.

551
00:26:30,713 --> 00:26:33,185
Andrew makes twice as much as me?

552
00:26:33,254 --> 00:26:35,455
Who told you that?

553
00:26:35,524 --> 00:26:36,979
A little bird

554
00:26:37,048 --> 00:26:40,705
or should I say
a little dog named Munchy?

555
00:26:40,774 --> 00:26:43,992
That's why you wanted to know
the names of my pets?

556
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:46,159
Orson Hodge,
you are shameful.

557
00:26:46,228 --> 00:26:48,463
What's shameful is
how much you're paying him.

558
00:26:48,532 --> 00:26:51,478
Andrew has been with me
since I launched the company.

559
00:26:51,547 --> 00:26:53,511
He runs every aspect
of the business.

560
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,840
He deserves what he's making.

561
00:26:54,841 --> 00:26:56,796
But I am your husband,
for crying out loud.

562
00:26:56,865 --> 00:27:00,591
Yes, Orson, we're all aware
of how you got the job.

563
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:02,589
You know
what the real travesty is?

564
00:27:02,658 --> 00:27:05,333
I'm more educated
than the lot of you.

565
00:27:05,403 --> 00:27:08,416
I went to grad school. I'm a dentist.
- No, you <i>were</i> a dentist.

566
00:27:08,485 --> 00:27:10,719
Now you're a caterer,
and you're paid fairly

567
00:27:10,788 --> 00:27:12,955
based on your expertise
and contribution.

568
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:15,699
Oh, this is not about money,
Bree. It's about value.

569
00:27:15,768 --> 00:27:17,732
And you're saying I'm worthless.

570
00:27:17,801 --> 00:27:20,747
No, I'm just saying
you're worth... less.

571
00:27:20,815 --> 00:27:23,084
I'm sorry, Honey.

572
00:27:23,153 --> 00:27:25,456
I'm just being honest.

573
00:27:26,947 --> 00:27:28,673
Very well.

574
00:27:30,334 --> 00:27:34,195
Oh, since we're being honest,
Munchy didn't go to any farm.

575
00:27:34,264 --> 00:27:36,228
That's what parents
tell their kids

576
00:27:36,297 --> 00:27:38,531
When they just had their pets
gassed.

577
00:27:44,156 --> 00:27:46,119
Hey.

578
00:27:46,188 --> 00:27:50,117
Hi. You got a minute? I have
a really big favor to ask you.

579
00:27:50,185 --> 00:27:52,014
Uh, sure.

580
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:55,164
I need
a little detective work done.

581
00:27:55,233 --> 00:27:56,892
It's about Bradley.

582
00:27:58,926 --> 00:28:01,127
So...

583
00:28:01,195 --> 00:28:03,702
What's going on?

584
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:06,005
I'm gonna buy a golf club.

585
00:28:06,073 --> 00:28:09,731
A baseball bat would be cheaper.

586
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,509
Maybe I should let you finish.

587
00:28:12,578 --> 00:28:14,846
See, I don't know anything
about golf clubs,

588
00:28:14,915 --> 00:28:16,709
But I know Carlos does,

589
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,708
so I was hoping you guys
could snoop around

590
00:28:18,777 --> 00:28:21,858
and find out
what kind of driver Brad wants.

591
00:28:21,927 --> 00:28:23,721
Oh, it's a gift.

592
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,212
Sure, yeah.

593
00:28:25,281 --> 00:28:27,923
We'd love to help out.

594
00:28:27,992 --> 00:28:30,260
So what's the occasion?
- No occasion.

595
00:28:30,329 --> 00:28:33,139
I just want to thank him
for being a wonderful husband.

596
00:28:33,208 --> 00:28:37,577
Well, don't spend to much.

597
00:28:37,646 --> 00:28:39,779
Why don't you
just get him a card?

598
00:28:39,848 --> 00:28:42,726
So our marriage counselor said
we should get each other

599
00:28:42,795 --> 00:28:45,233
little gifts now and then
to keep things spontaneous.

600
00:28:45,302 --> 00:28:47,672
Oh, you're in counseling.
That's great.

601
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:50,687
We were, but we stopped.
We don't need it anymore.

602
00:28:50,756 --> 00:28:54,040
Are you sure about that?
- Yeah. Brad and I are solid.

603
00:28:54,109 --> 00:28:56,581
Well, ice is solid, too,

604
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:59,765
until it cracks and you're
drowning in freezing water.

605
00:28:59,834 --> 00:29:02,306
I'd stay in counseling
if I were you.

606
00:29:02,375 --> 00:29:05,287
Gaby, I'm home! Can you come
in here for a minute?

607
00:29:08,676 --> 00:29:11,114
Brad gives me a huge bonus
and you repay him

608
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:14,129
by telling his wife that
they need marriage counseling?

609
00:29:14,198 --> 00:29:16,229
I'm sorry. I think they do.

610
00:29:16,297 --> 00:29:18,227
Their marriage is
none of your business.

611
00:29:18,296 --> 00:29:20,382
Besides, I think they're
a very happy couple.

612
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:21,243
Who? Him and Maria

613
00:29:21,312 --> 00:29:25,138
or him and the blonde I
saw him kissing yesterday?

614
00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:26,188
What? No way!

615
00:29:26,257 --> 00:29:28,323
Yeah. And Brad saw me.

616
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:30,559
Why do you think
your bonus jumped

617
00:29:30,627 --> 00:29:33,573
from a stuffed chicken breast
to 30 grand in a day?

618
00:29:41,095 --> 00:29:43,431
Oh, my God.

619
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,294
This is illegal.

620
00:29:45,363 --> 00:29:48,444
I'm getting a bonus no one else
is getting based on blackmail.

621
00:29:48,514 --> 00:29:49,698
You're welcome.

622
00:29:49,767 --> 00:29:53,289
I can't believe you did this.

623
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:55,864
Well, thank God
you came to your senses.

624
00:29:55,932 --> 00:29:58,235
All right, let's get in there
and tell her.

625
00:29:58,304 --> 00:30:01,419
No, we can't tell her. We'd have
to give the money back.

626
00:30:01,488 --> 00:30:04,502
Don't we have a moral
responsibility <i>to</i> tell her?

627
00:30:04,571 --> 00:30:06,027
It's like you said--

628
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:08,126
Their marriage is
none of our business.

629
00:30:08,195 --> 00:30:10,024
He's the one who's cheating.

630
00:30:10,093 --> 00:30:13,479
If we say anything,
it'll just make things worse.

631
00:30:13,548 --> 00:30:15,511
We're the good guys here,
Carlos.

632
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,493
Really? 'cause it sure
doesn't feel like it.

633
00:30:25,133 --> 00:30:28,114
It's open.

634
00:30:28,182 --> 00:30:31,128
Susan, you got our message.

635
00:30:31,197 --> 00:30:33,160
Yes, and imagine my surprise,

636
00:30:33,229 --> 00:30:35,159
'cause the last time
I talked to Mike,

637
00:30:35,228 --> 00:30:38,073
he promised me he was
picking up M.J. from school.

638
00:30:38,141 --> 00:30:40,071
Oh, Mrs. Nelson had
another plumbing emergency.

639
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,883
Apparently this
new oat bran diet she's on--

640
00:30:42,952 --> 00:30:45,830
I don't need the details.
I had a long day.

641
00:30:45,899 --> 00:30:47,829
I just want to pick up my kid.

642
00:30:47,898 --> 00:30:51,826
Mommy, we had paninis
for dinner. You want one?

643
00:30:51,895 --> 00:30:54,537
No, thank you. Let's go.

644
00:30:54,605 --> 00:30:57,043
But we were gonna make brownies
for dessert.

645
00:30:57,112 --> 00:30:59,076
But we can make brownies
at home.

646
00:30:59,145 --> 00:31:03,480
The box kind? Katherine says
those aren't real brownies.

647
00:31:03,548 --> 00:31:08,392
Except when your mommy
makes them with love.

648
00:31:10,188 --> 00:31:12,219
Good save.

649
00:31:12,288 --> 00:31:13,710
Let's go.

650
00:31:16,252 --> 00:31:17,470
Susan?

651
00:31:17,539 --> 00:31:19,875
Look,

652
00:31:19,944 --> 00:31:22,856
I know you were surprised
to find M.J. here again today,

653
00:31:22,925 --> 00:31:25,532
But I really was trying
to do you a favor.

654
00:31:25,601 --> 00:31:27,531
Well, I don't need you
to do me any favors.

655
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,783
What I need is for everyone
to just stick to the plan.

656
00:31:30,852 --> 00:31:32,782
Monday, Wednesday, Friday--
Mike watches his son.

657
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:35,831
He doesn't pawn him off
on his girlfriend.

658
00:31:37,526 --> 00:31:41,725
I had a really fun time.

659
00:31:59,409 --> 00:32:02,863
Big group coming in. It is
now officially Saturday night.

660
00:32:02,932 --> 00:32:04,591
Finally.

661
00:32:07,235 --> 00:32:08,927
Oh, great. They're kids.

662
00:32:08,996 --> 00:32:10,948
1 plate of spaghetti and
15 baskets of free bread.

663
00:32:10,949 --> 00:32:11,943
Stop being such a downer.

664
00:32:12,011 --> 00:32:14,245
We're finally making a go
of this place.

665
00:32:14,314 --> 00:32:16,956
All you want to do is complain.

666
00:32:17,025 --> 00:32:20,411
We're taking a break. N-not now.
- We just got a big party.

667
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,054
Good luck with that.
We're outta here.

668
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:29,151
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What's going on here?

669
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:32,641
Those kids go our school.
- And you know who that big guy is?

670
00:32:32,709 --> 00:32:35,622
Kevin McDermott. The guy
called me "Jesus" for a year

671
00:32:35,691 --> 00:32:37,247
'cause I wore sandals <i>one</i> day.

672
00:32:37,316 --> 00:32:40,703
If he sees me wearing this,
I'll never hear the end of it.

673
00:32:40,772 --> 00:32:43,311
Fine. Don't wear that apron. That's...
- No, I'm not waiting

674
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:46,123
on a kid who's gonna make fun
of me on Monday morning.

675
00:32:46,191 --> 00:32:48,083
It's humiliating enough
having to work here.

676
00:32:48,084 --> 00:32:48,630
Humiliating?

677
00:32:48,698 --> 00:32:51,170
Guys, easy.
- No, you're-- you're not humiliated

678
00:32:51,239 --> 00:32:53,169
when you use the money
that we make here

679
00:32:53,238 --> 00:32:56,150
to buy your clothes.
- Tom, it's fine. I'll take the table.

680
00:32:56,219 --> 00:32:58,454
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Your mother can't wait

681
00:32:58,523 --> 00:33:01,469
on this whole restaurant by herself.
- Well, then <i>you</i> do it.

682
00:33:01,537 --> 00:33:03,840
Porter, I'm your father
and your boss,

683
00:33:03,909 --> 00:33:08,312
and I'm telling you right now
to go take that table.

684
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:11,157
Or what, you're gonna fire me?
Go for it.

685
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:15,832
You think this is a joke?
This is my life!

686
00:33:15,901 --> 00:33:18,678
Tom!
- You worry about being embarrassed?

687
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:20,877
I have put everything I
have into this restaurant!

688
00:33:20,878 --> 00:33:21,963
All right, that's enough!

689
00:33:22,032 --> 00:33:26,131
Let go of him! Let go of him!
Let go of him!

690
00:33:26,199 --> 00:33:28,366
Guys?

691
00:33:30,535 --> 00:33:34,429
I just sat a 12-top.
Who's taking it?

692
00:33:38,123 --> 00:33:39,680
I will.

693
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:04,693
I started getting our accounts
in order.

694
00:34:04,762 --> 00:34:06,759
If we're gonna sell
this place,

695
00:34:06,828 --> 00:34:09,673
We should probably know exactly
how much it's worth.

696
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:41,753
I think this can all wait
until morning.

697
00:34:41,822 --> 00:34:43,481
Don't you?

698
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:11,394
Hey. I just booked us
into the Brunswick Inn

699
00:35:11,463 --> 00:35:13,392
For this weekend.

700
00:35:13,461 --> 00:35:14,646
Great.

701
00:35:14,715 --> 00:35:16,814
Prepare to be pampered!

702
00:35:16,883 --> 00:35:18,440
Oh, shoot.

703
00:35:18,509 --> 00:35:20,439
This weekend isn't gonna work.

704
00:35:20,507 --> 00:35:22,946
Mike really wants us
to do that camping trip

705
00:35:23,015 --> 00:35:24,945
that we've
been talking about.

706
00:35:25,013 --> 00:35:27,756
Camping? Have you <i>met</i> me?

707
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:29,755
I figured
you were gonna say that.

708
00:35:29,823 --> 00:35:31,753
I just can't blow him off.

709
00:35:31,822 --> 00:35:34,632
This is the only weekend
that works for him.

710
00:35:34,701 --> 00:35:36,631
Then you're on your own.

711
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:40,086
Have fun wiping with leaves.
- Oh, Edie?

712
00:35:40,155 --> 00:35:43,441
Please don't tell Katherine
that you're not coming.

713
00:35:43,509 --> 00:35:45,643
All right?
Mike really wants her there,

714
00:35:45,711 --> 00:35:48,758
and if she hears that you're
not going, she won't either.

715
00:35:48,828 --> 00:35:50,927
Will you take me

716
00:35:50,995 --> 00:35:52,925
to the Brunswick Inn
next weekend?

717
00:35:52,994 --> 00:35:55,094
Yes.

718
00:35:55,163 --> 00:35:58,888
Then I won't say a word
to Katherine.

719
00:36:21,044 --> 00:36:23,549
Hey.
When did you two get here?

720
00:36:23,618 --> 00:36:25,243
Just a minute ago.

721
00:36:25,312 --> 00:36:27,242
They said they have
something personal

722
00:36:27,311 --> 00:36:29,240
they want to talk to us about.

723
00:36:29,309 --> 00:36:31,916
Oh, really? What is it?

724
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:35,304
We're pregnant.

725
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,251
Oh, wow.

726
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,419
Yay!

727
00:36:40,488 --> 00:36:42,621
I know. We are so happy.

728
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:44,755
But that's not all.

729
00:36:47,365 --> 00:36:49,701
See, even though

730
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:52,208
we've only known each other
for a short time,

731
00:36:52,277 --> 00:36:54,207
your friendship
has meant a lot to us,

732
00:36:54,275 --> 00:36:56,205
which is why Maria feels strongly

733
00:36:56,274 --> 00:37:00,270
that you should be
the baby's godparents.

734
00:37:00,339 --> 00:37:03,319
Do you hear that, Carlos?

735
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:05,521
Godparents.

736
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,622
Yay!

737
00:37:07,691 --> 00:37:10,095
You are such good people,
so kindhearted and decent,

738
00:37:10,163 --> 00:37:12,093
and that is
the kind of influence

739
00:37:12,162 --> 00:37:15,684
that we want in our baby's life.

740
00:37:15,753 --> 00:37:18,089
How could we say no?

741
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,307
Oh!

742
00:37:21,376 --> 00:37:23,712
Oh!

743
00:37:23,781 --> 00:37:26,592
Oh. I see you got your bracelet
after all.

744
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,218
Oh, yeah.

745
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:32,283
Uh, but I'm not enjoying it
as much as I thought I would.

746
00:37:35,109 --> 00:37:36,109
Ok, watching a movie.

747
00:37:36,468 --> 00:37:38,298
You are one lucky boy.

748
00:37:39,161 --> 00:37:41,083
I'm gonna take
a quick shower.

749
00:37:41,152 --> 00:37:44,560
Try not to get any crumbs
on the couch.

750
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:46,080
What's wrong?

751
00:37:46,148 --> 00:37:48,106
It's peanut butter,
no crusts--

752
00:37:48,174 --> 00:37:50,030
your favorite.

753
00:37:50,098 --> 00:37:51,920
I want a panini.

754
00:37:51,988 --> 00:37:55,296
I don't know
how to make paninis.

755
00:37:55,365 --> 00:37:57,287
It's just turkey and cheese.

756
00:37:57,356 --> 00:37:59,347
Do we have any provolone?

757
00:37:59,416 --> 00:38:04,005
No, we do not have
any provolone.

758
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:06,369
Can we borrow some
from Katherine?

759
00:38:06,437 --> 00:38:09,035
Absolutely not.

760
00:38:09,104 --> 00:38:11,804
In this house, we do not eat
pretentious cheeses.

761
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:14,031
We eat
honest American peanut butter.

762
00:38:14,101 --> 00:38:16,259
Now watch your movie,

763
00:38:16,328 --> 00:38:18,961
and I'll be back in a minute.

764
00:38:26,591 --> 00:38:28,480
Will you make me a panini?

765
00:38:28,549 --> 00:38:31,316
Uh, well, sure, sweetie.

766
00:38:31,385 --> 00:38:33,477
Does your mommy know you're here?

767
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:38,540
Hey, sweetie.
How was your sandwich?

768
00:38:40,263 --> 00:38:41,646
M.J.?

769
00:38:41,715 --> 00:38:45,293
M.J., Honey, where are you?

770
00:38:45,361 --> 00:38:49,783
M.J., where are you?!

771
00:38:49,851 --> 00:38:53,259
M.J.!

772
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,040
M.J.!

773
00:39:08,924 --> 00:39:11,354
What is he doing here?

774
00:39:11,423 --> 00:39:13,683
He wanted panini,
said you knew.

775
00:39:13,752 --> 00:39:16,552
M.J., go wait
outside on the porch.

776
00:39:16,621 --> 00:39:18,612
I need to talk to Katherine.

777
00:39:22,528 --> 00:39:24,249
You can take the sandwich.

778
00:39:27,661 --> 00:39:30,326
Look, he showed up
on my doorstep.

779
00:39:30,395 --> 00:39:31,845
He seemed hungry.

780
00:39:31,914 --> 00:39:34,175
You think I don't feed my kid?

781
00:39:34,243 --> 00:39:37,584
Okay, well, maybe he just
wanted to come see <i>me.</i>

782
00:39:37,653 --> 00:39:40,285
Yeah, 'cause you make it
like Disneyland over here,

783
00:39:40,354 --> 00:39:42,581
with your paninis
and your blackjack.

784
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:45,146
You're trying
to do everything you can

785
00:39:45,215 --> 00:39:48,686
to make him think that
you're the other mommy.

786
00:39:48,687 --> 00:39:49,129
What?

787
00:39:49,198 --> 00:39:51,627
You're trying to get your hooks
deeper into Mike

788
00:39:51,696 --> 00:39:53,587
by showing him how
much his son loves you.

789
00:39:53,588 --> 00:39:54,599
Susan, I am being nice

790
00:39:54,667 --> 00:39:56,962
to the child of the man I'm dating.

791
00:39:57,031 --> 00:40:00,709
How does that make me evil?
- No, not evil. Devious.

792
00:40:00,778 --> 00:40:03,410
Well, you know,
I hate to tell you,

793
00:40:03,478 --> 00:40:05,402
but your big plan is
not gonna work,

794
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:08,945
'cause from now on, M.J. is
either at my house or Mike's.

795
00:40:09,014 --> 00:40:12,423
He is no longer allowed to be here.
- Yeah, uh, that's gonna be tricky.

796
00:40:12,492 --> 00:40:15,732
Well, that's the way it's gonna
be, whether you like it or not.

797
00:40:15,801 --> 00:40:19,006
No, it's gonna be tricky
because Mike's moving in here.

798
00:40:19,074 --> 00:40:21,403
What?

799
00:40:21,471 --> 00:40:22,888
First of the month,

800
00:40:22,957 --> 00:40:25,893
he's giving up his place
and moving in with me.

801
00:40:25,961 --> 00:40:30,214
So M.J. is going to be
spending a lot of time here,

802
00:40:30,282 --> 00:40:32,645
whether <i>you</i> like it or not.

803
00:40:39,464 --> 00:40:41,388
Orson, I'm glad you're here.

804
00:40:41,457 --> 00:40:43,379
I was doing a recount
of the goblets

805
00:40:43,448 --> 00:40:45,371
for the Hopkins
wedding reception,

806
00:40:45,441 --> 00:40:47,364
and we're short by about 30...
- Oh.

807
00:40:47,432 --> 00:40:49,996
So I have to run over
to the supplier

808
00:40:50,065 --> 00:40:52,677
and pick up the rest.
Could you hold down the fort for me?

809
00:40:52,678 --> 00:40:53,474
Sure. No problem.

810
00:40:53,543 --> 00:40:53,854
Thanks.

811
00:40:53,855 --> 00:40:56,478
Hey, you know, Andrew? It
never would have occurred to me

812
00:40:56,546 --> 00:40:58,470
to do a recount of the goblets.

813
00:40:58,538 --> 00:40:59,989
Bree's lucky to have

814
00:41:00,058 --> 00:41:03,298
someone as conscientious
as you working here.

815
00:41:03,366 --> 00:41:05,289
Wow.
Thank you, Orson.

816
00:41:05,358 --> 00:41:08,766
That--
that means a lot to me.

817
00:41:27,774 --> 00:41:31,891
<i>It begins just after sunrise.</i>

818
00:41:31,959 --> 00:41:34,052
<i>After a good night's sleep,</i>

819
00:41:34,121 --> 00:41:38,305
<i>people leave their homes</i>
<i>to go to work.</i>

820
00:41:38,374 --> 00:41:40,702
<i>They do this</i>
<i>so they can provide</i>

821
00:41:40,771 --> 00:41:44,651
<i>a better life</i>
<i>for their families...</i>

822
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:49,648
<i>afford to buy nice things...</i>

823
00:41:49,717 --> 00:41:53,665
<i>and have a reason</i>
<i>to get up in the morning.</i>

824
00:41:57,008 --> 00:42:00,079
<i>And when their exhausting work</i>
<i>is done,</i>

825
00:42:00,148 --> 00:42:02,611
<i>people come back home again...</i>

826
00:42:04,976 --> 00:42:07,912
<i>and some</i>
<i>begin counting the days...</i>

827
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:13,718
<i>till their next vacation.</i>
