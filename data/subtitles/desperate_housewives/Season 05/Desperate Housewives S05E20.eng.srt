1
00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:02,634
Previously on desperate housewives...

2
00:00:02,634 --> 00:00:05,501
Lynette went back to work, and Tom filled his days...

3
00:00:05,501 --> 00:00:07,933
- You're good at this girl talk thing.  - Well, thanks.

4
00:00:07,933 --> 00:00:11,167
- Do you at least know why he steals?  - I steal to hurt you.

5
00:00:11,167 --> 00:00:14,134
Bree struggled to understand her husband's problem,

6
00:00:14,134 --> 00:00:16,234
While down the street,

7
00:00:16,234 --> 00:00:20,334
- Edie finally figured out her husband's plan...  - You married me

8
00:00:20,334 --> 00:00:23,567
- So you could get close to the man who killed your family.  - He was never punished.

9
00:00:23,567 --> 00:00:25,934
Aah! 

10
00:00:37,067 --> 00:00:38,600
Aah! 

11
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:44,568
Rose Kemper was a survivor.

12
00:00:44,568 --> 00:00:48,468
You could see that by looking into her eyes.

13
00:00:48,468 --> 00:00:51,434
She had buried one husband,

14
00:00:51,434 --> 00:00:54,034
Given birth to five children,

15
00:00:54,034 --> 00:00:56,633
Survived illness, bankruptcy,

16
00:00:56,633 --> 00:00:59,967
Even the loss of her teeth...

17
00:00:59,967 --> 00:01:01,633
As a result,

18
00:01:01,633 --> 00:01:06,067
Rose Kemper was no longer afraid of anything.

19
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:11,334
Sadly, the man who climbed into her window that night

20
00:01:11,334 --> 00:01:13,967
Was unaware this...

21
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:19,601
But Rose was more than happy

22
00:01:19,601 --> 00:01:22,134
To explain it to him.

23
00:01:26,334 --> 00:01:29,267
Get out of here! Just get the hell out!

24
00:01:29,267 --> 00:01:33,001
I'm calling the police. Do you hear me?!

25
00:01:48,534 --> 00:01:52,567
Mrs. Kemper?

26
00:01:54,534 --> 00:01:57,867
Katherine! What are you doing here?

27
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,867
Oh, I heard you weren't feeling well,

28
00:01:59,867 --> 00:02:01,801
- So I brought you some flowers.  - Ohh.

29
00:02:01,801 --> 00:02:04,334
The doctors tell me you had a mild heart attack.

30
00:02:04,334 --> 00:02:08,101
Did they tell you why?

31
00:02:08,134 --> 00:02:10,867
It was death.

32
00:02:10,867 --> 00:02:12,833
He came for me.

33
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,934
Death came for you?

34
00:02:15,967 --> 00:02:20,000
But I chased him out with my baseball bat.

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,100
I gave him a good whack, too, right on the old noggin.

36
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,267
How much morphine do they have you on?

37
00:02:27,267 --> 00:02:31,367
You know that shelf where I keep my knickknacks?

38
00:02:31,367 --> 00:02:33,334
He tried to take one.

39
00:02:33,334 --> 00:02:36,100
Death collects knickknacks.

40
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,334
And when he couldn't get me, he went after that other lady...

41
00:02:39,334 --> 00:02:41,534
The one who crashed.

42
00:02:41,534 --> 00:02:43,467
Edie Britt?

43
00:02:43,467 --> 00:02:46,868
Oh, yes, and I saw everything.

44
00:02:46,901 --> 00:02:50,000
Death just staggered out into the street,

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,234
And he raised his hands

46
00:02:52,234 --> 00:02:56,333
And he made her run into that light pole.

47
00:02:58,733 --> 00:03:00,601
Katherine...

48
00:03:00,601 --> 00:03:02,967
You believe me, don't you?

49
00:03:02,967 --> 00:03:06,501
Oh, I would never make anything like this up.

50
00:03:06,501 --> 00:03:09,334
I know you wouldn't, sweetheart.

51
00:03:09,334 --> 00:03:11,900
Listen, I'll stop by tomorrow.

52
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,133
You just get your rest, okay?

53
00:03:16,534 --> 00:03:18,700
Uh, Katherine?

54
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,568
If you see death lurking in the hall,

55
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:24,534
You tell him he better not come around here,

56
00:03:24,534 --> 00:03:27,734
'Cause I am not afraid of him.

57
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:34,634
No, Rose Kemper was not afraid of anything...

58
00:03:34,634 --> 00:03:39,234
But the man who had broken into her home...

59
00:03:39,234 --> 00:03:44,534
Was now very afraid of rose kemper.

60
00:03:54,733 --> 00:03:58,301
The fact is everyone does it...

61
00:03:58,301 --> 00:04:02,501
Sometimes with the help of an overturned cushion...

62
00:04:04,668 --> 00:04:09,734
Sometimes by means of a large potted plant...

63
00:04:11,567 --> 00:04:15,734
Other times using the top button of a shirt.

64
00:04:17,834 --> 00:04:19,934
Yes, everyone has something

65
00:04:19,934 --> 00:04:23,034
They want to keep hidden from prying eyes...

66
00:04:23,034 --> 00:04:26,267
It's hard to believe you got this bump just by falling.

67
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:29,367
But some people are better at cover-ups than others.

68
00:04:29,367 --> 00:04:31,568
I know, but that's what happened.

69
00:04:31,568 --> 00:04:34,568
I went for a walk, tripped, and I hit my head on the curb.

70
00:04:34,568 --> 00:04:38,034
Okay, well, everything's looking much better.

71
00:04:38,034 --> 00:04:41,034
I see no reason why he shouldn't be released this weekend.

72
00:04:41,034 --> 00:04:43,367
Really? That soon?

73
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:46,201
You can pick him up in the afternoon.

74
00:04:46,201 --> 00:04:49,801
Orson, I'll check in one more time before you go.

75
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,234
Well, you don't seem all that thrilled

76
00:04:56,234 --> 00:04:59,034
About the prospect of me coming home.

77
00:04:59,034 --> 00:05:01,301
Honey, I don't mean to be negative.

78
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,468
It's just...

79
00:05:03,468 --> 00:05:05,434
What's gonna happen?

80
00:05:05,434 --> 00:05:08,900
Will you keep stealing and lying to me?

81
00:05:11,134 --> 00:05:14,000
I love you, but I just can't put up with that anymore.

82
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,501
Don't worry. Things are gonna be different.

83
00:05:16,501 --> 00:05:19,900
- How?  - Well, I've been doing a lot of thinking lately,

84
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,900
And I've decided...

85
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,568
Finally, to be happy.

86
00:05:24,568 --> 00:05:28,434
How can you just decide something like that?

87
00:05:28,434 --> 00:05:30,201
Look...

88
00:05:30,201 --> 00:05:34,401
There are things that I don't like about my life,

89
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:37,434
But there is so much that is good.

90
00:05:37,434 --> 00:05:42,434
Do I really wanna risk losing everything?

91
00:05:42,434 --> 00:05:46,000
I mean, if I can decide to be resentful and jealous,

92
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,967
I Can damn well decide to be happy...

93
00:05:48,967 --> 00:05:54,067
And be the kind of husband that you deserve.

94
00:05:55,267 --> 00:05:58,101
Do you really mean that?

95
00:05:58,101 --> 00:06:00,101
I do.

96
00:06:00,101 --> 00:06:03,867
I hope so, because I just cannot take any more lying.

97
00:06:03,867 --> 00:06:06,768
You won't have to.

98
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,100
I can promise you that.

99
00:06:16,468 --> 00:06:18,501
Dave?

100
00:06:18,501 --> 00:06:21,401
Hello?

101
00:06:21,401 --> 00:06:23,601
Dave?

102
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,900
- He didn't answer.  - Okay, now I'm starting to get worried.

103
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,900
Yeah, I left that casserole three days ago,

104
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,767
And it's still there. 

105
00:06:33,767 --> 00:06:40,200
- Anybody seen any dead squirrels around here?  - Even if Dave wants to be alone,

106
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,500
We have to make sure he's taken care of. We owe it to Edie.

107
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,701
- I say we keep showing up here until he lets us help him.  - We need to be annoying and persistent.

108
00:06:46,701 --> 00:06:49,567
- We're good at that.  - So who can come by later and check on him?

109
00:06:49,567 --> 00:06:51,567
I'd do it, but I'm working late.

110
00:06:51,567 --> 00:06:54,467
I'm in the classroom all day, and I have meetings after.

111
00:06:54,467 --> 00:06:58,267
- I have a rehearsal dinner to cater.  - Ugh, and I have a garden club meeting.

112
00:06:59,834 --> 00:07:01,967
You're in a garden club?

113
00:07:01,967 --> 00:07:04,434
Yeah, I just joined.

114
00:07:04,434 --> 00:07:06,634
Wait. There wouldn't happen to be actual gardeners

115
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:09,834
- In this club, would they?  - Hot shirtless gardeners

116
00:07:09,834 --> 00:07:12,267
With great abs and learner's permits?

117
00:07:12,267 --> 00:07:15,534
Gee, this bit just gets funnier and funnier.

118
00:07:15,534 --> 00:07:17,567
Oh, we tease because we love.

119
00:07:17,567 --> 00:07:20,333
Now back to Dave. I'll ask Mike to check in on him.

120
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:23,400
That'd be great. Remember to tell him "annoying and persistent."

121
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,600
- And I can make another casserole.  - Yeah, 'cause he hasn't suffered enough.

122
00:07:27,701 --> 00:07:31,700
That's a bit that I never get tired of.

123
00:07:32,634 --> 00:07:34,867
Dave? Hello?

124
00:07:34,867 --> 00:07:36,734
It's Mike.

125
00:07:40,134 --> 00:07:41,333
Dave?

126
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,234
Dave?

127
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,634
Yeah, I'm, uh, sorry to barge in.

128
00:07:50,634 --> 00:07:53,067
I just want to make sure you are ok

129
00:08:02,101 --> 00:08:04,734
Katherine made you lasagna.

130
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,800
Thought It'd be a good idea to eat something.

131
00:08:10,934 --> 00:08:13,600
Want me to get you a plate?

132
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,267
I'm good.

133
00:08:19,634 --> 00:08:21,300
You'll get through this.

134
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,834
Buddy, you will.

135
00:08:22,834 --> 00:08:24,767
Look, I have gone through some really...

136
00:08:24,767 --> 00:08:26,767
You've gone through nothing.

137
00:08:26,767 --> 00:08:28,734
And if you stand there

138
00:08:28,734 --> 00:08:31,667
And try to tell me you understand how I feel,

139
00:08:31,667 --> 00:08:34,500
I swear to god, I'm gonna lose my mind.

140
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,967
I'm just trying to help.

141
00:08:35,967 --> 00:08:38,567
You can't, okay?

142
00:08:38,567 --> 00:08:40,534
So why don't you go back to Katherine

143
00:08:40,534 --> 00:08:43,467
And your happy little life and leave me the hell alone?

144
00:08:43,467 --> 00:08:45,200
You're right.

145
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,800
I don't have any idea what you're going through.

146
00:09:02,134 --> 00:09:05,234
Sweetie, I'm home.

147
00:09:09,734 --> 00:09:11,134
Hey.

148
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:12,233
Hey.

149
00:09:12,233 --> 00:09:14,400
Don't make plans on tuesday.

150
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,567
We're having dinner at the solis' and...

151
00:09:18,567 --> 00:09:20,534
What's that look on your face?

152
00:09:20,534 --> 00:09:23,168
You didn't eat dairy again, did you?

153
00:09:23,168 --> 00:09:24,667
No. I've been working out.

154
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:26,300
Oh.

155
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,267
If you're good, I'll let you cop a feel.

156
00:09:29,267 --> 00:09:32,434
Hmm. That's okay. I can see it from here.

157
00:09:32,434 --> 00:09:33,667
Thrilling.

158
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:38,901
Mwah.  You smell good.

159
00:09:38,901 --> 00:09:40,834
Mm. I just took a shower,

160
00:09:40,834 --> 00:09:43,801
And I know where you're going with this... Mm.

161
00:09:43,801 --> 00:09:46,701
- But I am exhausted.  - Oh, come on, Lynette. Please?

162
00:09:46,701 --> 00:09:49,434
Ooh. Whining... that's hot.

163
00:09:52,501 --> 00:09:54,834
Fine.

164
00:09:54,834 --> 00:09:57,134
Let's have sex.

165
00:09:57,134 --> 00:09:59,601
But I warn you, I'm just gonna lie here,

166
00:09:59,601 --> 00:10:01,601
Resenting you the whole time,

167
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,900
Waiting for this hell to be over.

168
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,234
Okay. If you're sure.

169
00:10:06,234 --> 00:10:07,734
Tom! Mmm.

170
00:10:07,734 --> 00:10:12,168
- Come on!  - All right, all right. Okay, forget it.

171
00:10:14,034 --> 00:10:15,500
Wait. Y...

172
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,467
You just took a shower? Where?

173
00:10:17,467 --> 00:10:19,600
At work.

174
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,300
I didn't know you had a shower there.

175
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,600
I don't. Carlos does.

176
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,867
So you went into Carlos' office,

177
00:10:27,867 --> 00:10:30,368
Stripped naked and took a shower?

178
00:10:30,368 --> 00:10:32,468
No, I went into Carlos' bathroom,

179
00:10:32,468 --> 00:10:35,667
Closed the door, then stripped naked and took a shower.

180
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:38,201
I'm not comfortable with this. What if he walked in?

181
00:10:38,201 --> 00:10:41,401
- Then maybe I'd get that raise I've been asking for.  - This isn't funny.

182
00:10:41,401 --> 00:10:44,101
You already spend 16 hours a day with the guy,

183
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:47,034
And now I find out that some of those hours,You are naked and wet.

184
00:10:47,034 --> 00:10:49,001
Hours? It was two minutes.

185
00:10:49,001 --> 00:10:51,134
It's not like I'm lighting candles

186
00:10:51,134 --> 00:10:54,634
- And putting on Barry White.  - I don't care. I want it to stop.

187
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,367
Fine.

188
00:11:03,468 --> 00:11:07,601
I should've just had sex. I'd be asleep by now.

189
00:11:15,101 --> 00:11:18,567
Oh, and, ladies, we have been asked by the city council

190
00:11:18,567 --> 00:11:21,067
To beautify the center divider on main street.

191
00:11:21,067 --> 00:11:24,834
So make sure your calendars are clear next tuesday.

192
00:11:24,834 --> 00:11:27,334
I know I'm new here at the garden club,

193
00:11:27,334 --> 00:11:29,301
But what's with all the gardening?

194
00:11:29,301 --> 00:11:31,734
I thought this was just an excuse

195
00:11:31,734 --> 00:11:34,934
- To get together for bitchin' and boozin'.  - Blame Edna, the flower fascist.

196
00:11:34,934 --> 00:11:36,734
Yeah, when we first joined,

197
00:11:36,734 --> 00:11:39,401
We used to sit around in wicker chairs,

198
00:11:39,401 --> 00:11:41,700
- Drinking margaritas and just looked at the flowers.  - Oh, I'd kill for a margarita.

199
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,867
Don't cluster, ladies. Vary the colors.

200
00:11:44,867 --> 00:11:46,800
And she's the one I'd kill.

201
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,567
I mean, really, who died and left her in charge?

202
00:11:49,567 --> 00:11:52,633
Alice Koontz. Grand mal seizure while driving.

203
00:11:52,633 --> 00:11:54,634
Oh.

204
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,334
Well, this Edna has got to be stopped.

205
00:11:59,334 --> 00:12:01,667
How?

206
00:12:01,667 --> 00:12:04,700
Oh, my god. You're planning a coup, aren't you? I'm in.

207
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,034
Me, too.

208
00:12:07,034 --> 00:12:10,000
Well, that's three. Who else can we get?

209
00:12:11,434 --> 00:12:12,934
Definitely Judy.

210
00:12:12,934 --> 00:12:14,900
And Terry's allergic to everything.

211
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,967
One bee sting, and she blows up like...

212
00:12:16,967 --> 00:12:18,567
Well, like, Judy.

213
00:12:18,567 --> 00:12:20,533
How about the woman in the overalls?

214
00:12:20,533 --> 00:12:22,633
Phyllis? She just got her second d.u.i.

215
00:12:22,633 --> 00:12:24,533
If there's cocktails, she's in. 

216
00:12:24,533 --> 00:12:27,067
Okay, so the lush gives us six.

217
00:12:27,067 --> 00:12:30,934
What about them? No way. They're all friends of Edna's.

218
00:12:30,934 --> 00:12:33,867
Mm. All right, so they have six, and we have six.

219
00:12:33,867 --> 00:12:36,734
We're gonna need a tiebreaker.

220
00:12:42,767 --> 00:12:46,101
Hey, uh, are men allowed to join the group?

221
00:12:46,101 --> 00:12:49,067
I don't knowhy they wouldn't be.

222
00:12:49,067 --> 00:12:52,267
Ladies, start your blenders.

223
00:12:52,267 --> 00:12:55,434
Orson, I heard you wanted to see me.

224
00:12:55,434 --> 00:12:57,667
Yes, dr. Kagen.

225
00:12:57,667 --> 00:13:00,633
I heard you're treating a lady acrs the hall.

226
00:13:00,633 --> 00:13:03,334
- Uh, you mean Rose Kemper?  - Yeah, she's actually my neighbor.

227
00:13:03,334 --> 00:13:06,533
- I wanted to know how she's doing.  - Sorry. I can't discuss her condition

228
00:13:06,533 --> 00:13:08,500
With anyone she's not related to.

229
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,500
Oh. Well, that's a problem.

230
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,201
See, she has no family or friends, for that matter.

231
00:13:15,201 --> 00:13:18,001
And, uh, because of her dementia...

232
00:13:18,001 --> 00:13:20,001
Who said she has dementia?

233
00:13:20,001 --> 00:13:22,834
Well, certainly you've heard some of her bizarre ramblings.

234
00:13:22,834 --> 00:13:24,834
If she doesn't have dementia,

235
00:13:24,834 --> 00:13:26,834
It's something just as troubling.

236
00:13:26,834 --> 00:13:30,201
She has been saying some very disturbing things.

237
00:13:30,201 --> 00:13:32,667
But I wasn't aware it was an ongoing situation.

238
00:13:32,667 --> 00:13:35,301
Oh, yes, it is.

239
00:13:35,301 --> 00:13:38,468
And I'm so worried about her going back to that big house

240
00:13:38,468 --> 00:13:40,734
With no one to look after her.

241
00:13:40,734 --> 00:13:43,800
Hmm. I hate to get social services involved.

242
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,434
They'd probably just stick her in some state-run facility.

243
00:13:46,434 --> 00:13:48,667
Oh, that would be a shame.

244
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:52,867
But what if she ends up hurting herself or someone else?

245
00:13:52,867 --> 00:13:54,867
I mean, I'm not a lawyer,

246
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:57,301
But wouldn't the hospital be liable?

247
00:14:12,367 --> 00:14:15,634
Hey, penny. Aren't you gonna be late for school?

248
00:14:15,634 --> 00:14:18,733
My stupid brothers hid my homework. Real mature.

249
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:20,501
Is your mom ready?

250
00:14:20,501 --> 00:14:22,267
She's in the shower.

251
00:14:22,267 --> 00:14:24,167
What?

252
00:14:26,301 --> 00:14:29,334
Lynette!

253
00:14:29,334 --> 00:14:33,134
Carlos, you're early!

254
00:14:33,134 --> 00:14:35,434
Didn't you get my text? The meeting got moved up.

255
00:14:35,434 --> 00:14:37,934
Oh, crap. I'll be right there!

256
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,334
Aah! 

257
00:14:40,334 --> 00:14:42,834
Lynette, you okay?

258
00:14:43,568 --> 00:14:45,568
Lynette?

259
00:14:45,568 --> 00:14:47,434
Are you all right?

260
00:14:49,267 --> 00:14:52,100
If you don't answer me, I'm coming in there.

261
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,900
Oh, my god.

262
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,668
All right, doctor. Thank you. Bye.

263
00:15:03,668 --> 00:15:06,100
He says that since you weren't out very long,

264
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,067
You should be fine. And don't worry about the meeting.

265
00:15:09,067 --> 00:15:12,733
- I pushed it to lunch, and I can handle it alone.  - No, I'm fine. I-I want to go.

266
00:15:12,733 --> 00:15:14,301
- You sure?  - Mm-hmm.

267
00:15:14,301 --> 00:15:16,367
Okay, I'll let you get dressed.

268
00:15:16,367 --> 00:15:19,501
Hey, Carlos, quicquestion for ya.

269
00:15:19,934 --> 00:15:22,867
Last thing I remember, I was in the shower, naked,

270
00:15:22,867 --> 00:15:24,433
Reaching for the soap.

271
00:15:24,433 --> 00:15:30,167
Then I was here on the bed, under a blanket...

272
00:15:30,167 --> 00:15:31,600
Still naked.

273
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,201
And my question is,

274
00:15:33,201 --> 00:15:37,001
How did I get from there to here?

275
00:15:37,001 --> 00:15:39,067
Well...

276
00:15:39,067 --> 00:15:40,600
I carried you.

277
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,800
Uh-huh.

278
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,700
Which means you saw me...

279
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,800
Lynette, the only thing I was thinking about

280
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,101
Was were you gonna be all right?

281
00:15:50,101 --> 00:15:53,800
Oh, well, I appreciate that. (laugh)

282
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,800
And here's something else I'd appreciate...

283
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,234
Could we not tell anyone else about this?

284
00:15:58,234 --> 00:16:00,634
Not tell anyone? I'm a first-time hero.

285
00:16:00,634 --> 00:16:03,600
This was gonna be my lead item in this year's christmas letter.

286
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,734
If Tom finds out, he'll freak.

287
00:16:05,734 --> 00:16:07,700
He has this weird thing

288
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,934
About being the only guy who gets to see me naked.

289
00:16:10,934 --> 00:16:16,067
You got it. Now get dressed. We gotta go.

290
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,901
Could u maybe step outside?

291
00:16:18,901 --> 00:16:20,934
I only do one show a day.

292
00:16:20,934 --> 00:16:23,568
Sorry.

293
00:16:27,134 --> 00:16:30,401
Here you go!

294
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:33,600
Edna, here's your diet soda.

295
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,567
Try to keep your pants on.

296
00:16:35,567 --> 00:16:37,734
You know, I don't mean to be a killjoy,

297
00:16:37,734 --> 00:16:41,368
But are we gonna do any planting today?

298
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:45,167
There's some seeds in this. Knock yourself out.

299
00:16:55,967 --> 00:16:59,800
Patty, do you mind if I steal Tom for a sec?

300
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,067
Okay, but only a sec.

301
00:17:02,067 --> 00:17:03,567
Okay.

302
00:17:03,567 --> 00:17:06,467
What's up?

303
00:17:06,801 --> 00:17:10,033
First of all, you're a real prince for coming today.

304
00:17:10,033 --> 00:17:12,267
Thanks to you, our coup is complete.

305
00:17:12,267 --> 00:17:14,367
No problem.

306
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,767
Anyway, I know you must be bored silly,

307
00:17:16,767 --> 00:17:19,000
So go ahead and make your escape.

308
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,968
Actually, I'm thinking of staying.

309
00:17:20,968 --> 00:17:23,834
I'm having a great time, meeting some nice people.

310
00:17:24,067 --> 00:17:27,600
Yeah, about that... I gotta warn you.

311
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,067
Patty's kinda got a thing for married men.

312
00:17:30,067 --> 00:17:33,067
Oh, patty? No! No, no. She's just being nice.

313
00:17:33,067 --> 00:17:36,434
Yes, she's like that. She'll give you the bra off her back.

314
00:17:36,434 --> 00:17:38,900
We're just talking.

315
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,800
"Oh, Tom, what big arms you have"...

316
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,401
That kind of talking?

317
00:17:44,401 --> 00:17:46,500
Oh, that. Okay, fine.

318
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,301
Fine. Point taken.

319
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:50,533
Okay, great. Now if you'll excuse me

320
00:17:50,533 --> 00:17:53,034
Have to get back to my gardening.

321
00:17:57,734 --> 00:18:01,001
So Orson's decided to be happy.

322
00:18:01,001 --> 00:18:02,500
Isn't that great?

323
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,434
He sounded very sincere.

324
00:18:05,434 --> 00:18:07,100
I'll bet.

325
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,601
So just how happy is he going to be?

326
00:18:09,601 --> 00:18:11,601
Will he whistle while he works

327
00:18:11,601 --> 00:18:14,167
Or will he just skip around the house occasionally?

328
00:18:14,167 --> 00:18:16,100
I did not raise you to be bitchy.

329
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,867
No, you raised me to be passive-aggressive.

330
00:18:18,867 --> 00:18:20,968
My bitchiness... that was self-taught.

331
00:18:20,968 --> 00:18:24,267
Well, save it for those karaoke parties at Bob and Lee's.

332
00:18:24,267 --> 00:18:26,334
I am not amused.

333
00:18:26,334 --> 00:18:29,267
Mom, your b.s. Meter might be broken,

334
00:18:29,267 --> 00:18:31,133
But mine works just fine.

335
00:18:31,133 --> 00:18:32,734
Orson's up to something.

336
00:18:32,734 --> 00:18:36,100
Well, I can understand why you're a bit cynical,

337
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,034
But I'm giving him another chance.

338
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:40,433
He's my husband, and I still love him.

339
00:18:42,367 --> 00:18:45,133
He's been stealing stuff from your friends.

340
00:18:45,133 --> 00:18:47,534
He tried to get you to sell your business.

341
00:18:47,534 --> 00:18:50,867
I know.

342
00:18:50,867 --> 00:18:52,567
Fine.

343
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,933
Go ahead. Take him back.

344
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:58,367
But while you're watching Orson skip and sing,

345
00:18:58,367 --> 00:19:01,700
I'll be looking up divorce lawyers, just in case.

346
00:19:08,167 --> 00:19:09,667
Susan, you here?

347
00:19:09,667 --> 00:19:11,800
In the kitchen.

348
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:17,801
Why are you mopping the ceiling?

349
00:19:17,801 --> 00:19:20,567
I was cooking, all right?

350
00:19:20,567 --> 00:19:22,001
Lids.

351
00:19:22,001 --> 00:19:24,801
Susan, you really gotta start using lids.

352
00:19:24,801 --> 00:19:27,801
Sometimes it's the stove's fault.

353
00:19:27,801 --> 00:19:30,368
So I, uh, saw Dave last night.

354
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,667
How'd that go?

355
00:19:32,667 --> 00:19:34,567
Not good. He's in a really dark place.

356
00:19:34,567 --> 00:19:37,133
He kinda lashed out at me.

357
00:19:37,133 --> 00:19:39,834
At you? Why?

358
00:19:39,834 --> 00:19:42,334
I don't know. It's like all of a sudden,

359
00:19:42,334 --> 00:19:44,434
He resents my happiness with katherine.

360
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:47,867
- That's weird  - Maybe not. When your wife dies,

361
00:19:47,867 --> 00:19:49,434
It must be depressing

362
00:19:49,434 --> 00:19:51,400
To see other people in a loving relationship.

363
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,934
Hey, maybe you could look in on him.

364
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,567
Yeah, yeah, that didn't come out right.

365
00:19:58,567 --> 00:20:01,233
I know what you meant.

366
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,500
I'll stop by tomorrow and see him.

367
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,901
Thanks.

368
00:20:06,801 --> 00:20:09,701
You know, this whole thing with Edie...

369
00:20:09,701 --> 00:20:12,967
I mean, seeing her lying in the street that night...

370
00:20:14,901 --> 00:20:16,901
Oh, it just brought up

371
00:20:16,901 --> 00:20:20,034
All those awful memories from our accident.

372
00:20:22,233 --> 00:20:24,101
Susan.

373
00:20:25,367 --> 00:20:27,567
We did what we had to do.

374
00:20:27,567 --> 00:20:30,734
Yeah.

375
00:20:31,901 --> 00:20:34,700
Look what it did to us.

376
00:20:37,334 --> 00:20:39,334
Daddy!

377
00:20:39,334 --> 00:20:41,267
Hey, buddy.

378
00:20:41,267 --> 00:20:42,901
Hey, you hungry?

379
00:20:42,901 --> 00:20:45,600
No mommy made spaghetti.

380
00:20:48,567 --> 00:20:52,167
All right, I'll, uh, I'll have him back before school.

381
00:20:57,634 --> 00:20:59,467
You take care.

382
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:01,867
You, too.

383
00:21:12,167 --> 00:21:14,134
Hey. I'm on my way to work,

384
00:21:14,134 --> 00:21:16,068
But I just wanted to bring you these.

385
00:21:16,068 --> 00:21:19,034
Uh, chicken salad sandwiches, which I did not make.

386
00:21:19,034 --> 00:21:21,801
I bought. I learned my lesson from the casserole.

387
00:21:23,134 --> 00:21:24,934
Uh, thanks. 

388
00:21:24,934 --> 00:21:26,367
Uh, wait.

389
00:21:26,367 --> 00:21:29,800
Could you maybe have one right now

390
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,134
So that I know that you actually ate something?

391
00:21:33,134 --> 00:21:36,467
I'm not hungry, but again, thanks.

392
00:21:36,601 --> 00:21:39,801
Dave, I know that you're going through hell,

393
00:21:39,801 --> 00:21:43,267
But edie was my friend, so please, let me help you.

394
00:21:43,267 --> 00:21:45,667
Just a little

395
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,601
You sure you don't want one? It's really good.

396
00:22:04,601 --> 00:22:07,134
Still not hungry.

397
00:22:10,967 --> 00:22:14,501
So... Have you thought about what you're gonna do now?

398
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:16,767
I'm gonna sell the house.

399
00:22:16,767 --> 00:22:18,900
You're kidding. So soon?

400
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,167
I've got a realtor coming by today.

401
00:22:21,167 --> 00:22:24,367
I'm gonna put the money in a trust for Travers.

402
00:22:24,601 --> 00:22:27,234
It's, uh, it's what Edie would have wanted.

403
00:22:28,801 --> 00:22:31,234
Okay, well...

404
00:22:33,001 --> 00:22:36,267
At least you're making plans for the future.

405
00:22:36,267 --> 00:22:40,367
Everything that ever mattered to me is gone.

406
00:22:40,367 --> 00:22:44,634
The future's the last thing I'm thinking about.

407
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:48,867
Uh, well, I should

408
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:51,667
Probably... Put these away

409
00:22:51,667 --> 00:22:55,567
Before I finish them off.

410
00:22:57,334 --> 00:23:01,533
Are you sure there's nothing I can do to help you?

411
00:23:01,767 --> 00:23:03,600
A load of laundry?

412
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,667
No, thanks.

413
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:07,633
How about a pot of coffee?

414
00:23:07,633 --> 00:23:10,267
Or I could just...

415
00:23:10,267 --> 00:23:12,367
Straighten up in here?

416
00:23:12,367 --> 00:23:16,000
Susan, please. I need to be alone.

417
00:23:21,934 --> 00:23:23,501
Oh.

418
00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:26,900
Uh... Okay.

419
00:23:29,401 --> 00:23:31,701
Sure.

420
00:23:40,733 --> 00:23:45,567
Do you know what is a great cure for the blues?

421
00:23:45,801 --> 00:23:47,667
Cribbage.

422
00:23:47,667 --> 00:23:49,867
Do you have a cribbage set?

423
00:23:49,867 --> 00:23:52,400
I thought you had to go to work.

424
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,967
I'll call in sick, take the day off.

425
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:57,734
Susan...

426
00:23:57,734 --> 00:24:01,568
I really don't want to be rude, but you need to leave.

427
00:24:03,667 --> 00:24:05,234
Okay.

428
00:24:05,234 --> 00:24:07,634
You have a realtor coming, right?

429
00:24:07,634 --> 00:24:10,867
You cannot let him see the house in this condition.

430
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:14,534
So just let me clean up a little.

431
00:24:14,534 --> 00:24:17,234
You won't even know I'm here.

432
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,600
All right.

433
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:53,667
I will be back after work to check on you.

434
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,634
But until then,

435
00:24:55,634 --> 00:24:59,568
Here's the phone, in case you wanna order chinese

436
00:24:59,568 --> 00:25:01,900
Or...

437
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,734
Call a hotline or something.

438
00:25:15,568 --> 00:25:18,534
Hey, katherine, can you call me back as soon as you can?

439
00:25:18,534 --> 00:25:21,401
I just left Dave, and he's in bad shape. 

440
00:25:21,401 --> 00:25:23,401
I actually think that he might be...

441
00:25:23,401 --> 00:25:26,167
Oh, crap. I gotta go.

442
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,834
- Yes, officer?  - License and registration, please.

443
00:25:33,834 --> 00:25:36,034
Oh, okay. Uh, what did I do?

444
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,500
It's against the law to talk on a cell phone

445
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,834
Without using a hands-free device while driving,

446
00:25:40,834 --> 00:25:42,100
Asf january 1st.

447
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:45,000
Right. I know that. I just was worried about a friend

448
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,233
So I forgot. I'm sorry.

449
00:25:47,767 --> 00:25:50,201
Step out of the car slowly.

450
00:25:50,201 --> 00:25:52,934
- Uh, what? You don't want the license?  - Out of the car.

451
00:25:55,733 --> 00:25:57,067
Oh!

452
00:25:57,067 --> 00:25:59,501
You think that I'm dangerous.
 

453
00:25:59,501 --> 00:26:02,833
- No, I totally have an explanation for those.  - Stop talking.

454
00:26:02,833 --> 00:26:06,867
- You're gonna feel really silly when you hear what it is.  - Get out of the car now!

455
00:26:06,867 --> 00:26:08,534
Okay.

456
00:26:08,534 --> 00:26:11,634
- On the ground!  - Oh, yes, sir!

457
00:26:11,634 --> 00:26:15,000
Hey, susan. I just got your message about Dave.

458
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,867
I'm on my way to the hospital, but if you want me to, I...

459
00:26:19,867 --> 00:26:24,534
You know, why don't we talk later?

460
00:26:38,568 --> 00:26:40,234
Hey, Tom.

461
00:26:40,234 --> 00:26:41,934
Hey.

462
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:43,767
Was that Patty Rizzo?

463
00:26:43,767 --> 00:26:46,733
Yeah. I had some car trouble, so she followed me

464
00:26:46,733 --> 00:26:49,733
Over to the garage and gave me a lift back.

465
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:52,700
Patty lives six blocks away. I live down the street.

466
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,301
Why didn't you ask me to take you?

467
00:26:55,301 --> 00:26:57,501
Are you going somewhere with this?

468
00:26:57,501 --> 00:27:00,467
All right, look, Tom, I'm sorry, but I got a responsibility here.

469
00:27:00,467 --> 00:27:01,834
I brought you into the club.

470
00:27:01,834 --> 00:27:05,968
I introduced you to the horny homemaker.

471
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:11,000
- I just don't want you to...  - What, Gaby, cheat on my wife?

472
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,967
I was gonna say "die of gonorrhea,"

473
00:27:12,967 --> 00:27:14,668
But that's close enough.

474
00:27:14,668 --> 00:27:18,234
Okay, um, I really appreciate your concern,

475
00:27:18,234 --> 00:27:20,934
But how can I put this?

476
00:27:20,934 --> 00:27:22,267
Butt out.

477
00:27:22,267 --> 00:27:24,733
All right, Tom, you leave me no choice.

478
00:27:24,733 --> 00:27:26,867
You are no longer allowed to see Patty.

479
00:27:26,867 --> 00:27:30,100
"allowed"? Who are you, my mother?

480
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:33,334
I trump your mother. I am garden club president.

481
00:27:33,334 --> 00:27:35,568
This is ridiculous.

482
00:27:35,568 --> 00:27:38,568
- I thought you were my friend.  - Look, I love you, Tom,

483
00:27:38,568 --> 00:27:40,634
But you're my friend with a small "f."

484
00:27:40,634 --> 00:27:43,501
My friend with the big "f" is Lynette.

485
00:27:43,501 --> 00:27:46,267
So if I see something that could hurt her,

486
00:27:46,267 --> 00:27:50,733
- You bet your ass I'm gonna do something about it.  - A neighbor offered me a ride.

487
00:27:50,733 --> 00:27:51,733
If you want to hurt Lynette

488
00:27:51,733 --> 00:27:56,267
And twist it into something that it isn't, screw you.

489
00:27:56,267 --> 00:27:59,801
And that's with a big "f."

490
00:28:02,601 --> 00:28:05,000
Hello, my love.

491
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,100
Oh, hello, darling. Please tell me you're here to spring me.

492
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,534
Not that I haven't enjoyed every moment Of your poking and prodding.

493
00:28:11,534 --> 00:28:13,567
I'm just taking one last look at your husband.

494
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:15,568
Are you sure he wasn't in some sort of bar fight?

495
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:17,000
It looks like he got smacked over the head

496
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,134
- With a pool cue or something.  - Orson's not exactly the bar-fight type.

497
00:28:20,134 --> 00:28:25,568
- He's more of a raised voices at-a-cheese-tasting type.  - While I'm finishing up here,

498
00:28:25,568 --> 00:28:28,034
Do you wanna go sign the discharge papers?

499
00:28:28,034 --> 00:28:30,868
Great. Be back in a minute. 

500
00:28:34,867 --> 00:28:36,800
Bree?

501
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,034
Katherine. Hi. What are you doing here?

502
00:28:39,034 --> 00:28:41,201
Oh, I came to see Rose Kemper.

503
00:28:41,201 --> 00:28:43,201
Oh, right. I heard she was here.

504
00:28:43,201 --> 00:28:45,668
Yeah, it's so sad. I'm here to help her pack.

505
00:28:45,668 --> 00:28:48,267
Social services is coming this afternoon

506
00:28:48,267 --> 00:28:51,100
To take her to some nursing home. I'm surprised. I knew she was a bit dotty,

507
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:54,733
- But didn't think it was that serious.  - Oh, yes. She's been telling people this story

508
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,334
About how death broke into her house.

509
00:28:57,334 --> 00:28:58,501
- Death?  - Mm-hmm.

510
00:28:58,501 --> 00:28:59,767
Oh, dear.

511
00:28:59,767 --> 00:29:02,100
Apparently he climbed in through a window

512
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:05,033
And then tried to steal one of her knickknacks.

513
00:29:06,401 --> 00:29:08,568
Well, that's odd.

514
00:29:08,568 --> 00:29:11,067
Yeah. Then she whacked him across the head

515
00:29:11,067 --> 00:29:12,568
With a baseball bat.

516
00:29:12,568 --> 00:29:14,367
A bat?

517
00:29:14,367 --> 00:29:16,367
Which is what I would do

518
00:29:16,367 --> 00:29:19,234
If death were ever to steal one of my knickknacks.

519
00:29:19,234 --> 00:29:21,467
So did she get a good look at... Death?

520
00:29:21,467 --> 00:29:24,834
No. She said he was wearing some sort of mask.

521
00:29:24,834 --> 00:29:27,033
She tells the story so convincingly,

522
00:29:27,033 --> 00:29:30,000
You almost believe her. 

523
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,200
Oh, there's the social worker.

524
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,100
I wanna be there when she talks to Rose.

525
00:29:40,301 --> 00:29:42,468
He's all yours, Bree.

526
00:29:42,468 --> 00:29:44,668
Wonderful.

527
00:29:51,167 --> 00:29:53,533
This dinner is delicious.

528
00:29:53,533 --> 00:29:56,334
- You really didn't have to do this.  - With the long hours you've been putting in,

529
00:29:56,334 --> 00:29:59,334
- I just wanted to do something special to say thank you.  - And by "do something,"

530
00:29:59,334 --> 00:30:02,667
He means having me slave over a rack of lamb all day. 

531
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:04,667
I would like to propose a toast.

532
00:30:04,667 --> 00:30:06,767
Who says that friendship and business don't mix?

533
00:30:06,767 --> 00:30:09,967
- To friendship.  - Hear, hear. To friendship.

534
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,867
So I want to hear more about the garden club.

535
00:30:16,867 --> 00:30:19,401
Tom says he's meeting all kinds of nice people.

536
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:21,401
Really?

537
00:30:21,401 --> 00:30:23,001
Any favorites, Tom?

538
00:30:23,001 --> 00:30:24,867
They're all great gals.

539
00:30:24,867 --> 00:30:26,834
One's sort of a pain in the ass.

540
00:30:26,834 --> 00:30:29,468
Other than her, I'm having a great time.

541
00:30:29,468 --> 00:30:33,368
Although I keep telling Tom how dangerous gardens can be.

542
00:30:33,368 --> 00:30:35,067
Everywhere you step,

543
00:30:35,067 --> 00:30:39,000
There are shovels and rakes and hoes.

544
00:30:43,401 --> 00:30:46,767
You know, Lynette and I should really be toasting you two.

545
00:30:46,767 --> 00:30:48,368
- Mm.  - Us?

546
00:30:48,368 --> 00:30:49,834
Yeah, for putting up

547
00:30:49,834 --> 00:30:51,867
With all the long hours we've been keeping.

548
00:30:51,867 --> 00:30:54,834
Hey, I didn't mind the long hours. 

549
00:30:54,834 --> 00:30:58,667
- I wasn't so crazy about the whole shower thing, but...  - Oh, so Lynette told you about that?

550
00:30:58,667 --> 00:31:02,034
Yeah, she thought I was nuts for getting weird about it.

551
00:31:02,034 --> 00:31:03,533
I get it.

552
00:31:03,533 --> 00:31:06,401
A guy carries your unconscious, naked wife to your bed...

553
00:31:06,401 --> 00:31:09,434
What are you talking about?

554
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,468
Hey, is this gorgonzola?

555
00:31:15,468 --> 00:31:17,934
The other day when she fell in your shower.

556
00:31:17,934 --> 00:31:21,034
- What are you talking about?  - When she took a shower in your office.

557
00:31:21,034 --> 00:31:23,967
- You took a shower in my office?   - What's going on here?

558
00:31:23,967 --> 00:31:25,767
Lynette was taking a shower

559
00:31:25,767 --> 00:31:28,368
And Carlos came by to drive her to work.

560
00:31:28,368 --> 00:31:32,101
- She slipped and fell, and he helped her.  - You told her? I asked you not to.

561
00:31:32,101 --> 00:31:35,800
- She's my wife. I tell her everything.  - Oh, you hear that, Lynette? They tell each other everything.

562
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,834
- That way they know that they're not hiding anything.  - I was just afraid you'd overreact,

563
00:31:38,834 --> 00:31:41,667
- Like you're doing... Right now.  - Full disclosure, Lynette... that's what a marriage is about.

564
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:43,700
So I assume you fully disclosed

565
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,301
Your little "friendship" with Patty Rizzo.

566
00:31:52,001 --> 00:31:54,134
What little friendship?

567
00:31:54,134 --> 00:31:56,667
You know what? I think this is gorgonzola.

568
00:31:56,667 --> 00:31:58,234
Tom?

569
00:31:58,234 --> 00:32:00,234
Well, Patty gave me a ride home,

570
00:32:00,234 --> 00:32:02,734
And for some reason, Gaby's making a big deal about it.

571
00:32:02,734 --> 00:32:05,434
Cause it's Patty Rizzo. She's a total slut.

572
00:32:05,434 --> 00:32:08,900
You should be on antibiotics just for sitting in her car.

573
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,267
Exactly.

574
00:32:10,267 --> 00:32:12,800
Stay out of this, Gaby. You've done enough damage.

575
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,267
Hey, don't snap at me. Lynette's my friend.

576
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:18,167
- I was just watching her back.  - While your husband was watching her front.

577
00:32:18,167 --> 00:32:19,667
Drop it, Tom.

578
00:32:19,667 --> 00:32:22,534
We'll continue this at home.

579
00:32:27,967 --> 00:32:29,934
If you have a shower at the office,

580
00:32:29,934 --> 00:32:32,800
How can you come home smelling so bad?

581
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,401
I don't know.

582
00:32:34,401 --> 00:32:37,134
Why does the lamb taste like sawdust?

583
00:32:40,001 --> 00:32:43,633
Oh, thank you, darling.

584
00:32:43,633 --> 00:32:46,700
I can't tell you how nice it is to be home again.

585
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,967
Well, it's wonderful to have you home.

586
00:32:49,967 --> 00:32:51,434
How's your head?

587
00:32:51,434 --> 00:32:53,867
Mm, it still hurts.

588
00:32:53,867 --> 00:32:55,700
Well, that'll teach you

589
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,368
To go out walking in the middle of the night. 

590
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:01,800
You know, I still don't know why you were out so late.

591
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,067
Well, I told you.

592
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:08,301
We had a little spat, and I wanted to clear my head.

593
00:33:08,534 --> 00:33:12,701
Oh. And then you bumped it on that nasty curb.

594
00:33:12,701 --> 00:33:16,268
Well, that'll teach me to fight with my lovely wife.

595
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,167
Hmm.

596
00:33:18,167 --> 00:33:20,167
And that's all you were doing,

597
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:22,467
just going out for a walk?

598
00:33:23,667 --> 00:33:25,601
That's all.

599
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:33,468
Oh, you know, I just remembered

600
00:33:33,468 --> 00:33:36,533
- some business I have to discuss with Andrew.  - Mm.

601
00:33:36,533 --> 00:33:38,634
Enjoy your tea.

602
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,201
Hey, mom. What's wrong?

603
00:33:46,201 --> 00:33:51,034
Orson's lying to me again.

604
00:33:51,034 --> 00:33:54,267
So I think I have to divorce him.

605
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:59,567
Just, uh, tell me how I can help.

606
00:34:03,801 --> 00:34:06,567
You okay?

607
00:34:06,567 --> 00:34:09,567
I just keep thinking about Dave.

608
00:34:09,567 --> 00:34:11,534
His life was so great.

609
00:34:11,534 --> 00:34:13,100
He had everything.

610
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:16,834
Then one day, boom! All gone.

611
00:34:16,867 --> 00:34:20,867
Yeah, I know.

612
00:34:20,867 --> 00:34:23,467
Life can turn on a dime...

613
00:34:23,467 --> 00:34:26,700
Dave, Edie,

614
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:29,801
Rose Kemper...

615
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:33,534
The one thing it's made me realize is...

616
00:34:33,534 --> 00:34:35,800
I don't want to live with regrets.

617
00:34:35,834 --> 00:34:39,167
Me neither.

618
00:34:42,101 --> 00:34:45,001
I've been wanting to tell you this for some time.

619
00:34:45,001 --> 00:34:49,267
Remember when I suggested moving in together?

620
00:34:49,267 --> 00:34:52,333
It wasn't just about saving rent.

621
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:56,333
I was trying to pull you closer,

622
00:34:56,333 --> 00:34:59,834
Manipulate some kind of commitment out of you.

623
00:34:59,834 --> 00:35:02,834
And that's not who I am, so I want you to know that I'm sorry,

624
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:04,967
and it won't happen again.

625
00:35:04,967 --> 00:35:09,301
From now on, no hidden agendas.

626
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,801
I like that policy.

627
00:35:15,067 --> 00:35:18,501
I'm always gonna be honest with you.

628
00:35:19,967 --> 00:35:21,501
After all,

629
00:35:21,501 --> 00:35:24,768
you're the guy I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with.

630
00:35:34,568 --> 00:35:36,967
Ah, more sandwiches.

631
00:35:36,967 --> 00:35:39,034
Or is my gun in there?

632
00:35:39,034 --> 00:35:41,367
It's just your belts and ties.

633
00:35:41,367 --> 00:35:43,367
The police kept the rest.

634
00:35:43,367 --> 00:35:46,067
I know. They called.

635
00:35:46,067 --> 00:35:48,134
You told them I was suicidal.

636
00:35:48,134 --> 00:35:49,800
I'm sorry.

637
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,568
It's just... the things you said...

638
00:35:52,568 --> 00:35:54,568
I'm worried about you.

639
00:35:54,568 --> 00:35:56,034
Don't be.

640
00:35:56,034 --> 00:35:58,634
I told you, I'm fine.

641
00:36:02,301 --> 00:36:03,767
You are not fine.

642
00:36:03,767 --> 00:36:05,900
How could you be?

643
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,700
You have suffered a horrible loss.

644
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:12,000
And you are allowed to feel any way you want.

645
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,667
But I know that you are not fine.

646
00:36:20,867 --> 00:36:24,934
Okay, well, I'm sorry for ransacking your house.

647
00:36:24,934 --> 00:36:28,434
I'll stop bugging you.

648
00:36:31,367 --> 00:36:34,534
Edie and I had a fight.

649
00:36:34,534 --> 00:36:37,401
That night.

650
00:36:37,401 --> 00:36:39,534
A bad one.

651
00:36:45,234 --> 00:36:47,034
I came home.

652
00:36:47,034 --> 00:36:49,534
We argued.

653
00:36:49,534 --> 00:36:52,434
She stormed out, got in her car and died.

654
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,134
Oh, Dave...

655
00:37:00,934 --> 00:37:03,201
That does not make it your fault.

656
00:37:03,201 --> 00:37:05,468
Doesn't it?

657
00:37:05,468 --> 00:37:08,700
If things had been different, if I...

658
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,000
Had been different, she'd still be alive

659
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,967
You can't think that way.

660
00:37:12,967 --> 00:37:14,900
I mean, what happened is bad enough.

661
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,600
Y... you can't blame yourself for it, too.

662
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,234
If you do that,

663
00:37:19,234 --> 00:37:22,234
You will destroy everything you have left that's good.

664
00:37:22,234 --> 00:37:24,700
Trust me. I know.

665
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:28,801
Trust me. You don't.

666
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:37,267
A few years ago, Mike and I got in a car accident.

667
00:37:38,933 --> 00:37:42,967
A woman and her daughter... Died.

668
00:37:44,134 --> 00:37:46,734
Yeah, I... I heard about that. 

669
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,567
Mike was driving, right? 

670
00:37:53,033 --> 00:37:55,267
That's what we said...

671
00:37:56,967 --> 00:37:59,701
But it wasn't true.

672
00:38:02,234 --> 00:38:06,967
After the crash,

673
00:38:06,967 --> 00:38:08,967
I couldn't find my license.

674
00:38:08,967 --> 00:38:10,933
I had switched purses that night,

675
00:38:10,933 --> 00:38:13,933
and I had left it at home, and so...

676
00:38:13,933 --> 00:38:18,100
Mike... Told them that he was driving.

677
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:21,501
He took the blame for me.

678
00:38:21,501 --> 00:38:22,933
So...

679
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:25,901
I understand guilt.

680
00:38:26,134 --> 00:38:29,533
And I want you to understand

681
00:38:29,533 --> 00:38:34,067
that Edie's death was an awful tragedy.

682
00:38:34,067 --> 00:38:36,301
It was not your fault.

683
00:38:39,834 --> 00:38:41,667
Maybe you're right.

684
00:38:41,667 --> 00:38:44,100
Thank you for telling me.

685
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,101
Heck of a dinner party, huh?

686
00:38:58,101 --> 00:39:01,834
It's amazing how fast you can eat in total silence.

687
00:39:01,834 --> 00:39:04,800
It's my fault. I should have just told Tom the truth,

688
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,101
although it turned out to be kind of a wash

689
00:39:07,101 --> 00:39:09,067
with the whole Patty Rizzo thing.

690
00:39:09,067 --> 00:39:11,268
You know what I think is cool?

691
00:39:11,268 --> 00:39:13,034
You guys have been married a long time,

692
00:39:13,034 --> 00:39:15,034
And you still get jealous.

693
00:39:15,034 --> 00:39:18,401
Yeah. But just to be on the safe side,

694
00:39:18,401 --> 00:39:21,800
If I fall in my tub again, let me die there.

695
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,267
Okay. Back to work.

696
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,533
Yes. And we shall never speak of this again.

697
00:39:27,533 --> 00:39:29,800
I am embarrassed enough.

698
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,567
Lynette?

699
00:39:32,567 --> 00:39:35,400
I saw you without your towel.

700
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:39,934
You got nothing to be embarrassed about.

701
00:39:48,634 --> 00:39:50,001
Hey.

702
00:39:50,001 --> 00:39:52,067
Hey.

703
00:39:53,934 --> 00:39:56,467
How's the garden club today?

704
00:39:56,467 --> 00:39:59,800
Oh, Yllis got tanked on cosmos and threw up on Edna...

705
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:03,134
So now we're back to planting crap.

706
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,101
Look, I'm really sorry for sticking my nose

707
00:40:08,101 --> 00:40:10,200
into that whole Patty rizzo thing.

708
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,834
It's okay. I...

709
00:40:12,834 --> 00:40:16,001
The truth is, is I knew she was coming on to me.

710
00:40:16,001 --> 00:40:19,667
Then why did you keep hanging out with her?

711
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,801
Lynette has been so swamped with work lately,

712
00:40:24,801 --> 00:40:26,667
That she doesn't...

713
00:40:28,434 --> 00:40:31,701
It's just nice having a woman notice me again.

714
00:40:31,701 --> 00:40:33,300
Is that terrible?

715
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,434
No. I get it.

716
00:40:35,434 --> 00:40:37,434
When we first moved here,

717
00:40:37,434 --> 00:40:39,434
Carlos was working round the clock,

718
00:40:39,434 --> 00:40:42,367
- and he'd come home and barely say hello to me.  - Hmm.

719
00:40:42,367 --> 00:40:44,434
It was like I was invisible.

720
00:40:44,434 --> 00:40:48,001
Invisible... that's the word.

721
00:40:50,467 --> 00:40:54,600
So when he didn't see me, I found someone who did.

722
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,333
Y... you know I'd never do that to Lynette.

723
00:40:57,333 --> 00:40:59,734
I never thought I'd do it to Carlos.

724
00:40:59,734 --> 00:41:02,534
Well...

725
00:41:02,534 --> 00:41:04,534
Then it's a good thing

726
00:41:04,534 --> 00:41:07,467
I've got a friend around to keep an eye on me,

727
00:41:07,467 --> 00:41:09,434
even if it's one with a small "f".

728
00:41:09,434 --> 00:41:13,600
Well, for the record, you're growing on me.

729
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,567
You know what? I'm thirsty.

730
00:41:15,567 --> 00:41:18,034
Let's start a book club.

731
00:41:21,667 --> 00:41:26,334
The fact is everyone does it.

732
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:31,067
Everyone tries to cover up what they don't want others to see.

733
00:41:33,267 --> 00:41:37,801
Women hide their need for commitment...

734
00:41:39,234 --> 00:41:43,133
Men disguise their gring insecurity...

735
00:41:45,134 --> 00:41:50,234
Wives mask their intense disdain.

736
00:41:50,234 --> 00:41:52,234
How can ordinary people

737
00:41:52,234 --> 00:41:55,634
hide the truth of their feelings so successfully?

738
00:41:56,367 --> 00:42:00,501
All it takes is a friendly gesture...

739
00:42:00,501 --> 00:42:03,301
You can't play in the street, M.J.

740
00:42:03,301 --> 00:42:04,800
You could get hurt,

741
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,601
and that would really tear your mom apart.

742
00:42:09,668 --> 00:42:12,234
And a plan.

743
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,000
