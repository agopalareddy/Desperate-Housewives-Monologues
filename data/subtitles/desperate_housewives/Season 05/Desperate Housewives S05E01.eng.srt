1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:03,290
5 years ago,

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:09,200
Susan Delfino gave birth to a son
in delivery room A in hospital.

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:12,610
Moments later,

4
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,930
Lelar Dash gave birth to a
daughter in delivery room B

5
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:21,520
Around 10 ten at next morning,

6
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,140
As the two new mothers
were leaving the hospital.

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,040
They nearly ran into each other.

8
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,900
Of course, they never knew this.

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,290
In fact, Susan and Lelar would
have been surprised to know

10
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,130
How often their pasts
would cross over the years.

11
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,680
They Almost met in
the locAl coffee shop

12
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,210
And another Time at
their veterinarian office.

13
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,040
And again in the bleacher
of Fairview flyers.

14
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:03,150
But despite these close calls,
Susan and Lelar never met.

15
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:08,290
Until one Tuesday,

16
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:12,030
When Susan decided to take her
husband to a fancy restaurant

17
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,490
For their anniversary.

18
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:15,790
At the same Time,

19
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,450
Lelar decided to take her
daughter to buy some ice-cream.

20
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:25,160
That was the night that
Susan Delfino and Lelar Dash.

21
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,380
Finally, ran into each other.

22
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,280
Mike.

23
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,920
It will happen to
All of us eventuAlly.

24
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,190
The moment will come
when we ask ourselves...

25
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,680
Where did the Time go?

26
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,940
How did the children
I once cradled...

27
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,730
Grow up so very quickly?

28
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,330
How did the life I dreamt of...

29
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:49,370
Turn into a career I never expected?

30
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:56,130
And how did that woman I
saw each day in the mirror...

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,840
Become someone I
don't even recognize?

32
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,880
Juanita, this dress is awfully tight.

33
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,230
I don't think you can get into it.

34
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,640
No, it's pretty. I can do it.

35
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,580
How's that one fit? Oh, I think
we're gonna need the next size up.

36
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:22,150
Uh, there is no next size up.

37
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,850
They don't make princess
dresses for girls over 7.

38
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,520
She's only 4 1/2.

39
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,440
Look, my daughter was
invited to a princess party,

40
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:33,770
So I can't let her

41
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,820
Be the only girl there
without a princess dress.

42
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,540
Did you try the costume section?

43
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,950
I bet they'd have a mrs.
Shrek dress that would fit her.

44
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,810
Juanita, take off the
dress! We're going.

45
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,490
No! I can do it.

46
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,830
Look, I feel for you.

47
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,250
My niece Also has a weight problem.

48
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,010
My daughter does not
have a weight problem

49
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,100
She has a little
baby fat, that's All.

50
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,420
In fact, the only problem she has

51
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,780
Is this store being
completely unprepared

52
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,410
For a perfectly
average 4-year-old girl.

53
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,880
Just ring it up.

54
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,090
No, no, no!

55
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,140
Oh, for god sakes. What's wrong now?

56
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,120
Once again,

57
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:21,020
The concept is, sweetie,

58
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,480
You're taking the
pie out of the oven,

59
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,480
Your face aglow with surprise.

60
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,570
Why am I surprised? Because
it turned out so perfectly.

61
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,170
Well, that's no surprise.
My pies are Always perfect.

62
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:36,160
All right. It's your best pie ever.

63
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:37,690
You've topped yourself. Hmm?

64
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,620
Mm. And I know this
before I've tasted it?

65
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,930
Sweetie, just make
whatever face you want.

66
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,030
I just think you'll
sell more cookbooks

67
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,020
If you don't look like

68
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:49,770
You just made love to an ice cube.

69
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,930
Andrew, dear, I'm going
to take a little break.

70
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,650
Would you please tell this gentleman

71
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,680
That if he calls me
"sweetie" one more Time,

72
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:02,110
I'm gonna grab his camera
and take picture of his colon

73
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,620
You got that, right?

74
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:13,090
Katherine, hi. What are you doing
here? The waiters need to be paid,

75
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,490
And you took the key
to the cashbox... Again.

76
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:20,470
Oh. Sorry. Paid for what? The
armenian wedding? Lunch for 300?

77
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:23,370
It was right after the
breakfast for the garden club,

78
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,910
Which you Also missed.
Look, I'm sorry.

79
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,550
I didn't know a photo
shoot would take this long.

80
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,700
I mean, who knew it'd be this
hard to pose for a book cover?

81
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,400
Oh, you'll be fine.

82
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,990
If there's one thing
you're really good at,

83
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,240
It's posing as a
chef. Okay, Katherine.

84
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,140
I know this book has
been monopolizing my Time,

85
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,880
And you feel overworked
and undervalued.

86
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:44,790
But I do appreciate you. In
fact, I have a gift for you.

87
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,400
It's the galleys of my new book.

88
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:48,920
Read page 2.

89
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,240
"for Katherine
Mayfair--

90
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,600
"a wonderful cook

91
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,630
And an even better friend."

92
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,930
You dedicated it to me?

93
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:03,340
Well, you make this All possible.

94
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,590
It's the least I could do.

95
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,220
Ahem! Excuse me.

96
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:10,300
Time is money. Chop-chop, sweetie.

97
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,840
Andrew... Do we have a backup pie?

98
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,290
Yes. Yes, we do.

99
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,450
Good.

100
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:32,840
And the big blind...

101
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:36,250
Catches a jack on the river.

102
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:40,660
Preston?

103
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,690
Mom!

104
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,870
What the hell's going
on here? Don't freak out.

105
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,570
We're just playing cards. Oh,
yeah? Why didn't you play at home?

106
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,040
Why did you have to sneak in here?

107
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,470
Tequila shots! 5 bucks!

108
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,120
Asked and answered.

109
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,640
Okay, that's it!
Everybody out. Game's over.

110
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,330
Can I have your chair for a second?

111
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,170
Hey! Look up here!
Mom's here. Party's over.

112
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,430
Door's open. Out you go. Go on. Shoo!

113
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,330
You guys have pulled
a lot of stupid stunts.

114
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,470
But this?

115
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,870
This?

116
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,490
Risking our liquor
license, our livelihood?

117
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,410
Who's going to find out?

118
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,920
I mean, we've been running this
game for a month, and nobody--

119
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,770
Unbelievable. You guys
are grounded for two weeks.

120
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,740
But we have mecoming.

121
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,540
Yeah, yeah! Keep complaining.
I'd love to make it a year.

122
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,780
Now clean this place up. Now!

123
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,650
Wow. That was fantastic.

124
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,310
Amazing.

125
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,700
Whew. You were incredible.

126
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,150
So were you.

127
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,270
Oh. And...

128
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,060
Time to go.

129
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,240
Susan?

130
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,990
So it's been, what, four months?

131
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,190
Are you ever gonna
let me spend the night?

132
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,640
I don't know. Come on, zippy, zippy.

133
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:16,220
Okay. It's just, you know...

134
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,260
Girls usually beg me
to spend the night.

135
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:20,220
Well, good, then you
shouldn't have any problem

136
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:23,390
Finding a place to sleep.
Fine. I know the drill.

137
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,640
I can't spend the night.
I can't meet your friends.

138
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:28,660
I can't meet your son.
I'm just wondering--

139
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:32,160
Is this ever gonna turn into something
normal? You know, you're a guy,

140
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:34,040
And we just had hot sex,

141
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,830
And I didn't force you to cuddle.

142
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,300
So run! Go! Brag to your friends.

143
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,620
Look...

144
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,820
I like you, and I know you like me.

145
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:45,810
So why can't we be a couple?

146
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,800
'cause I'm... Not ready for that.

147
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,480
And what we've got--
that's All I can handle.

148
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,650
Go.

149
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,030
Okay, but that's
only gonna work, like,

150
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,640
500 or 600 more Times.

151
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,940
Good evening. Can I help you?

152
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:20,080
Wrong question. The
question is, can I help you?

153
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,010
Look, if you're trying
to sell me something,

154
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,650
I don't have any money.

155
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,510
You do now.

156
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,680
I don't understand.

157
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,730
I'm here to buy you
out of your lease.

158
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:32,730
What?

159
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,380
I know. It's sudden.

160
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,920
But there's something
about this house that...

161
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,000
Well, it just feels like home to me.

162
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,500
So I'd like to move in... Tonight.

163
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,510
Tonight? Areou crazy?

164
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,580
A little bit.

165
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,300
Okay, here.

166
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:50,130
I will more than cover
your moving expenses.

167
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:54,040
Look, uh... I-i'm All set up here.

168
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:56,650
Besides, my landlady
would never Allow it.

169
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,770
Why don't you let me worry about her?

170
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:02,320
Mm, no. I-i don't have
anywhere else to go.

171
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,580
I think you should leave.

172
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,490
Look, Raymond...

173
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,810
How do you know my name?

174
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,910
I made you a very generous offer,

175
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:16,220
And I just know you're going
to make the right decision.

176
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,790
Five.

177
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,860
Five what? What are
you talking about?

178
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,420
Four.

179
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:23,310
Are you-- I
don't understand.

180
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,370
Three. O-okay. Hang on for a second.

181
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,820
Two.

182
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,430
Well, Raymond, thank you very much.

183
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,990
Here you go. Take care.

184
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:47,120
All taken care of... Mrs. Williams.

185
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:52,080
Thank you... Mr. Williams.

186
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,530
The next morning,

187
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:01,090
Edie Britt decided to announce
her return to Wisteria Lane

188
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,290
In a way... That was guaranteed...

189
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,350
To make a big splash.

190
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:25,450
Okay, you're not gonna
believe this, but...

191
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,100
She's back.

192
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,230
Edie? Is that really you?

193
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,180
You know someone else my
age with a body like this?

194
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,000
So you're back?

195
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,740
What happened to your tenant?

196
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,390
He, uh, came into some
money and decided to move.

197
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:57,130
We thought, what the
heck? Let's move back!

198
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,700
"we"?

199
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:01,740
Oh, you don't know.
I have a husband now.

200
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,950
Really? Whose?

201
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:08,590
So I'm in vegas talking to
this real estate convention.

202
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,390
I do a little motivational speaking.

203
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,810
And there-- sixth
row, center aisle,

204
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,380
Is the most beautiful
woman I have ever seen.

205
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,930
So after I finish,

206
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,670
I walk into the audience
and I ask this goddess out.

207
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,750
His seminar was called
"getting what you want,"

208
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:25,290
And he did...

209
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:28,380
Three Times. Hmm. Before dinner.

210
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,180
Well, it's certainly
nice to meet you, Dave,

211
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,680
And let us be the first to
welcome you to Wisteria Lane.

212
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,590
Oh, you know what? We should
have a dinner or something.

213
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,030
Oh, let's make it a party.

214
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,720
We could do it at my
restaurant. We'd be honored

215
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:40,970
Thank you.

216
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,090
So, Gaby, I have to ask.

217
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:46,670
What the hell happened to
you? I mean, look at you.

218
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,120
Your--your clothes,
your--your hair.

219
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:54,290
Carlos might be blind, but the rest
of us aren't. I had two children.

220
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,850
For what? Breakfast?

221
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:59,720
Edie? On your first day
back in the neighborhood?

222
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,590
You're right.

223
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,640
I'm sorry, Gaby.

224
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,610
It was rude and insensitive,
and it won't happen again.

225
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,620
Really?

226
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,890
Are you okay.

227
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,060
Now shouldn't we offer your
friends something to eat?

228
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:22,420
Ooh! I baked some muffins.

229
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,980
Please don't take this
the wrong way, but...

230
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,560
We love you.

231
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,800
Mijita! Lunch is ready.
Go get your sister.

232
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,780
Carlos, what's with All the cheese?

233
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,910
You know how Juanita feels
about brussels sprouts.

234
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,990
I'm just trying to make vegetables
more fun. Well, next Time,

235
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,060
Give her a carrot and put
her on a roller coaster.

236
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,540
Have you tried to lift her lately?

237
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:59,560
I know she's gotten chubby.
She'll grow out of it

238
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:01,060
Ha! We can only hope

239
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:04,970
With your d.N.A. Running through her
veins. Hey, I do not have fat d.N.A.

240
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:07,940
Oh, don't make me pull out
the Solis family photo Album.

241
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:10,400
It's like a bunch of sea
lions posing on a rock.

242
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,980
Well, I'm sorry my
relatives don't measure up to

243
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,820
Thgroup of stick-thin
drunks that you come from.

244
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,080
All I'm sang is that our
daughter has a weight problem,

245
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:21,280
And the sooner we admit it,
the better. She's only 4.

246
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,530
But, you know, you want her
to develop a weight problem?

247
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,830
Go ahead. Nag, criticize,
make her feel self-conscious.

248
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,640
See what happens.

249
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:36,200
And obviously I am not
getting through to the twins,

250
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,870
Because no Matter what I say,
they keep pulling this crap,

251
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,400
And I am sick of it.
Honey, could you...

252
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,780
Sorry.

253
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:46,630
Yeah.  So you-- you
want me to talk to them?

254
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,510
You have to. I am tired
of being the bad cop.

255
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,860
You walk the beat for a while.
Fine. You know, boys this age,

256
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,550
They're more likely to
listen to their dads anyway.

257
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,210
I-i can handle this.

258
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,920
I really appreciate it.

259
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:01,190
Honey, you know what I'd
appreciate? Could you...

260
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,400
Sorry.

261
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:12,830
So Kirby has aces
in the hole... Yeah.

262
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,990
Whicmeans that Bobby

263
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,690
Will have to wear a dress to
school on monday. Oh! Oh, my! Okay.

264
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,530
You've got to get a picture of that!

265
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:25,350
Tom? Can I talk to you a sec?

266
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,730
Yeah.

267
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:28,560
Don't you think

268
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:30,550
You were kind of sending
the wrong message in there?

269
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,150
I know we don't approve
of what they did,

270
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,340
But you--you
gotta admit.

271
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,700
Come on. Starting their own
casino is kind of creative.

272
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:39,740
Yeah? "creative" like selling
fake i.D.S was creative.

273
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,690
And hot-wiring Mccluskey's
car-- that was a work of art.

274
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,230
Honey, honey, this
is nothing like that.

275
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,580
I mean, look, the whole school

276
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:48,300
Is talking about their card game.

277
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:49,830
Do you realize it was, like,

278
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,240
The place to be on a monday night?

279
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:55,310
Oh, my god.

280
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,430
What?

281
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,260
You think they're cool.

282
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,370
Well... Yeah.

283
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,340
No, I mean you think they're cool

284
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:04,920
In that you wanna
be them. Oh, please.

285
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:08,250
You do! This is Tom,
former high school Nerd,

286
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:11,520
Living vicarusly through
his awesome-ass kids.

287
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:14,470
Hey, I was plenty
cool in high school.

288
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,480
Are we redefining "cool"

289
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:19,220
To include playing trombone
in the marching band?

290
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,960
You're overreacting.

291
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,780
You're a little high-spirited,
but I trust them.

292
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:30,180
So I've decided to unground
them for the homecoming dance.

293
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,930
But I told them they couldn't go.

294
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:35,010
And you told me to
handle it, and I just did.

295
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,080
Oh, by the way, it wasn't a trombone.

296
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,460
It was a tuba.

297
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,670
Know your brass.

298
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,640
Juanita!

299
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,890
You said I could have cake.

300
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,170
I know, but so much?

301
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,170
You could've gone back
for a second piece.

302
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,160
This is my second piece.

303
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,740
And it's not Juanita's fault.

304
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,980
In this kind of situation,
I blame the parents.

305
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:19,620
Look, my kid would eat sugar
All day long if I let her.

306
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:22,640
Gaby's obviously one of those
moms who just can't say no.

307
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:26,540
It's a shame, too. Juanita
has such a pretty face.

308
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,150
I'm back.

309
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,580
You want something cold?

310
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,290
Well, actually,

311
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,530
I'm in the mood for something hot.

312
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,620
You know...

313
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,250
This is why it's taking four months

314
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,590
To get my house painted.

315
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,480
Haven't you ever
heard that expression,

316
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,180
"you can have it done fast,
or you can have it done right"?

317
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:59,770
I think I'll have it done right now.

318
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,200
Hey, Susan?

319
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,350
Mm. Uh, Lynette, it's
not really a good Time.

320
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,620
I just need five seconds
to bitch about Tom,

321
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,190
And then I'll--
oh, my god.

322
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,500
Your painter isn't done yet?

323
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,120
Yeah. He--he's hard
to keep track of.

324
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,880
Well, anyway, Tom
refuses to acknowledge

325
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,970
That the twins are turning
into juvenile delinquents.

326
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:30,370
Just the other day, I was-- oh,
you poor thing! You need a hug.

327
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,420
Have you been drinking?

328
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,680
Sorry to have barged in,

329
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,180
And thanks for letting
me get that off my chest.

330
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:53,330
Hey, anytime that you need to
talk, you just ring my bell...

331
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:54,960
And wait.

332
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:57,950
Okay, new rule.

333
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,110
From now on, sex only happens
in the bedroom, door closed,

334
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,750
Between the hours of 7:00
and 10:00 p.M. You know what?

335
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,080
It'd be a hell of a lot easier
for me to follow the rules

336
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:09,570
If I knew why they existed. I
just don't want my friends to know.

337
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,590
Why? You--you
ashamed of me?

338
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,750
No, of course not.

339
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,420
It's just... Complicated.

340
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,330
I'm just a simple guy,

341
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,770
So I can't be your
dirty little secret.

342
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,730
I need more from you.

343
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,870
I'm sorry. I can't give that to you.

344
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:35,010
Honey, I know you wanna go
home and watch your cartoons,

345
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,290
But you had a lot of cake,

346
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,530
So I was thinking I'd
take you to the park.

347
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:42,980
That way, you could run around
and get some nice, fun exercise.

348
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,250
No.

349
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,620
You sure?

350
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,650
Running around in
the sun and fresh air

351
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,000
Would make you feel good.

352
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:52,440
Mm... No.

353
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:54,930
Okay.

354
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,740
Why don't you go throw
that in the trash?

355
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,340
And I'm gonna get the car started.

356
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:13,370
He Juanita.

357
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,590
You wanna play a new
game on the way home?

358
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:20,640
Winner gets a new doll. Okay.

359
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,620
Well, come on, then!

360
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,840
Mommy, what are you doing?

361
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:40,770
It's a new game I invented,
and you're winning 1 to nothing!

362
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,170
Katherine! Fantastic news.

363
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,460
"what's cookin' Fairview?"

364
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,880
Is sending out a camera crew Tomorrow

365
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:59,970
To do a piece on me and the book. Oh,
which I just finished this morning.

366
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,720
You read it ready? Yes.
I couldn't put it down.

367
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:05,720
But I have to tell you,
at least a dozen recipes

368
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:08,120
Are missing a pretty
crucial ingredient.

369
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,680
Really?

370
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,040
What?

371
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,310
My name.

372
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,190
Excuse me? Bree, your
book is filled with recipes

373
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,380
That we developed together,

374
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:20,030
And--and some of them are
flat-out mine. Oh, don't be silly.

375
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,650
I May have based a
few on your recipes,

376
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,520
But I Always changed someing.

377
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:24,800
Like what? The font?

378
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:28,080
Name one difference between
this meatloaf recipe and mine.

379
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:30,370
Well, yours calls for
minced curly leaf parsley.

380
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,380
Mine calls for minced flat leaf.

381
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,840
It's minced! Who can
tell the difference?

382
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,430
Bree, you have recipes in
here you can't even make.

383
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,440
Never heard anything so absurd.

384
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:42,400
The croquembouche cake
with the spun sugar netting?

385
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:45,140
I've never once seen you
work with molten sugar.

386
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:47,050
I Always make that
cake. ReAlly, Katherine.

387
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:50,180
Just because I let you execute
a few eye-catching garnishes

388
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:52,070
That gratify your need to show off,

389
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,240
Doesn't mean that I can't
do them just as well myself.

390
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,870
You let me?

391
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:00,150
I thought we were partners.

392
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,180
We are.

393
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:05,280
That's why your name is
on the dedication page.

394
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,990
You were right about
the dedication, Bree.

395
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,740
It really was theleastyou could do.

396
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,820
18 to zero!

397
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:24,150
2 more points, and
you'll break the record.

398
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,100
Mommy, I'm tired!

399
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:28,020
Really?

400
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,540
Well, I thought running
through that guy's sprinkler

401
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:32,320
Would've refreshed you. Now come on!

402
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:33,540
No.

403
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:38,590
Looks like mommy's gonna
score her first 2 points.

404
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,670
Come on, Juanita.

405
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,180
Show mommy what a winner you are.

406
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:54,560
Juanita!

407
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,210
What are you doing?!

408
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,930
Juanita, stop!

409
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:14,240
Juanita! Juanita!

410
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,950
And while I thought

411
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,030
Grounding you was an
appropriate punishment,

412
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,510
Your dad convinced me

413
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,770
I was being a little too
hard on you guys. Absolutely.

414
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,430
And so we have decided

415
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,240
To let you go to the
homecoming dance tonight...

416
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:27,950
That's right!

417
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,500
In your father's convertible.

418
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:34,540
Um, um, h-h-hold
on. What? Wh--

419
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,500
Come on, Tom. I mean,
we trust them, right?

420
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,640
Yes, yes.

421
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:38,840
I-i would trust them more if they

422
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:42,830
Were driving your
car. No! You don't wan

423
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,400
Two cool kids pulling up
to homecoming in a mom car,

424
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:48,620
Especially with that big dent
they put in it last month.

425
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:51,030
Dude! Thanks! Thanks!

426
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,400
Don't thank me. Thank
your father. Thanks, dad!

427
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:56,380
You rock! Uh, you--whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa! Here--some ground rules.

428
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:59,200
N-no muddy shoes on
my floor mats. No--

429
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:01,000
Tom, relax!

430
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:05,190
You high-spirited kids do
whatever it takes to have fun.

431
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,100
And in three, two, one.

432
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:15,760
Welcome back to "what's
cookin' Fairview?"

433
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:17,510
We're talking with Bree Van De Kamp,

434
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,820
Fairview's premier caterer,

435
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:21,240
Who's about to publish
her very first cookbook.

436
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:23,100
Bree, could you show us inside?

437
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:25,520
This is my kitchen,

438
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:28,000
And this is
my staff--

439
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:31,510
The most gifted, hardworking team

440
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,900
A cook could ever have hoped for.

441
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:36,170
I cannot say enough
good things about them.

442
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,660
So which one of you has
worked with Bree the longest?

443
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:40,520
That would be me.

444
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:43,610
So tell me, what's it really
like working with Bree?

445
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,790
It's inspiring.

446
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,930
There is absolutely
nothing she can't do.

447
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,790
Katherine, I'm blushing.

448
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,430
Working with her has been...

449
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,770
Such an education

450
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,860
That
i--aah!

451
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,740
Ah! Oh, god. Are you All right?

452
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,520
I think I strained my
wrist. God, it hurts.

453
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:10,100
Oh, you poor dear. Could someone
please get some ice? Oh, no.

454
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:14,260
Oh, and I was just about to
put the spun sugar netting

455
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:16,520
On our famous croquembouche.

456
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,600
Would you mind doing it?

457
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:23,600
Katherine,

458
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:26,490
I'm sure your wrist is just fine.

459
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,990
No, it's really throbbing.

460
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,760
Okay, it looks like
Bree to the rescue.

461
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,360
Be sure you get this.

462
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:36,040
Really something to see.

463
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,950
The secret to spinning sugar

464
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,670
Is this special whisk

465
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,340
That makes lovely gossamer threads.

466
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,330
Careful, dear.

467
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,660
You're clumping. I can see that.

468
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:03,270
That stuff's hot!

469
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,660
Sorry.

470
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,820
Oops!

471
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,110
So that's your idea of exercise?
Having her run after a car?

472
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,850
Carlos, our daughter sucked
down half a sheet cake,

473
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,000
And afterwards, no one
could find the candles.

474
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:23,670
Wake up! We have got a problem!

475
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:27,000
I just don't think the
solution is to humiliate her.

476
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:28,370
Now even if she's... Heavy,

477
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,340
Doesn't she have the right
to feel good about herself?

478
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:34,350
Hey, I'm protecting her. She
doesn't know the truth yet.

479
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,250
Women only have five seconds
to be young d beautiful,

480
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,730
And then it's gone.

481
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:42,080
And then before you know it,
we're old and fat and married

482
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,450
And wondering where our beauty went.

483
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,140
Gaby...

484
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,900
No, Carlos. I mean...

485
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:50,880
Sometimes I'm glad you can't see me.

486
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:52,640
Five years and two kids

487
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:54,150
And no Time for facials or the gym.

488
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:57,270
It just... Takes a toll.

489
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,360
And when Edie same the other day,

490
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:05,420
It was like she didn't
even recognize me.

491
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:08,330
Listen to me.

492
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:13,890
Nobody knows your
face better than I do.

493
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,970
And I see it every Time I kiss you.

494
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:17,870
In 5 years or 50,

495
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,830
You will Always be beautiful.

496
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,680
Hear me?

497
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:30,240
And now to finish,

498
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,830
You simply transfer your spun sugar

499
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,400
To the croquembouche

500
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:37,610
And gracefully drape it around

501
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:40,880
In a delicate swirl.

502
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,440
Did I meion that you...

503
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:49,150
Probably shouldn't be wearing jewelry

504
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,770
While working with spun sugar? Um...

505
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,970
Well, there's no law that says
it has to be a delicate veil.

506
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,610
I mean, it could really
just be a beautiful, um,

507
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,560
Little, uh, white...

508
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,580
Ribbon.

509
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:11,710
Turn off the damn camera.

510
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,150
Ah, actually, my wrist is
feeling a little better.

511
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,230
Why don't I give it a shot?

512
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,420
Whatcha doing?

513
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:30,830
Okay, where are they? It's
30 minutes past curfew.

514
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,050
Actually, it's 32.

515
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,200
If there is a single
scratch on that car--

516
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:38,550
I mean, after All the Time that
I spent restoring that thing...

517
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,790
Yeah. Remember when you spent
the entire day on the internet

518
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,150
Trying to find a new gearshift knob?

519
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,190
Worst anniversary ever.

520
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,340
I cannot believe that
you did this to me.

521
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,470
I know.

522
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,410
That car is your baby.

523
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:59,590
If only there was something
I felt that intensely about.

524
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,510
Oh, wait! There is--
my actual babies.

525
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:05,490
You think I don't
care about our boys?

526
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,580
I know you love them,

527
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:10,410
But sometimes you find them
so cool and entertaining,

528
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,980
You forget to parent them.

529
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:14,750
Lynette--
no, listen.

530
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,730
This is important.

531
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:20,380
When they were little
and they'd act out,

532
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:23,010
And we'd Always say,
"relax! They're young.

533
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,500
When they're older, they'll get it."

534
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:27,040
Well, Tom, they're 16 now.

535
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:30,230
Not getting it.

536
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:34,130
We have a lot of work to
do in a very short Time,

537
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,920
And if you and I aren't in sync,

538
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:38,240
I'm afraid it's not gonna happen.

539
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:55,100
Hey, sorry we're late. Yeah. But,
dad, you have to hear this story.

540
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:57,270
We just pulled up at an intersection,

541
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,870
And there were these two hot
girls-- I don't want to hear it.

542
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:03,200
You ever hear of a thing
called a cell phone?

543
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:05,210
We're only, like, 35 minutes late.

544
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,390
Yeah, 35 minutes, during which Time

545
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,890
Your mother and I
have been worried ck.

546
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,510
But,
dad--

547
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,380
You broke the rules.
There are consequences.

548
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,910
You're both grounded for a month.

549
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:21,120
This sucks! You're only doing this

550
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:22,730
'cause you were worried
about your precious car.

551
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,800
You think? Get out of the way.

552
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:35,670
Any other opinions
you'd like to share?

553
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:50,390
Thank you.

554
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:52,980
But you didn't have to...

555
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,470
That mirror was scratched.

556
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:59,690
I Already ordered a new one.

557
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,730
Mrs. Mccluskey! You're still Alive!

558
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,720
Oh, it's nice to see you, too, Edie.

559
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,980
This is my husband, Dave Williams.

560
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,350
So how did you two meet?

561
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,150
You run a free clinic or something?

562
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,450
I'm sorry. Who are
you? Karen Mccluskey,

563
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,070
Edie's best friend on the street.

564
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,340
Well, it's a real
pleasure to meet you.

565
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,190
What are you doing here?

566
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,760
Um, I just need to talk to you.

567
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:40,870
Not here. Go home. I'll call you.

568
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,080
When?

569
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:44,720
I don't know. Later. Just go.

570
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,430
I have to say, ladies,

571
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,970
This is quite a shindig.

572
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,990
Oh, I'm glad you're
enjoying yourself.

573
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,810
Yeah, I mean, there's
really not a lot of people

574
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:04,160
Who go to this much trouble to
say they're sorry. Excuse me?

575
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:07,850
Well, the party. It's just
a beautiful way to apologize.

576
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:11,770
Edie, this is not a
"we're sorry" party.

577
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:14,160
This is a "we forgive you" party.

578
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,730
You forgive me?

579
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,510
Well, I think what Gaby means is

580
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,490
You were fairly awful to
us right before you left,

581
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,940
And this is our way
of welcoming you back

582
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:27,620
To hopefully not do it again.

583
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:29,680
You gotta be kidding.

584
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:33,230
You froze me out.

585
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,820
You threatened to ruin my business,

586
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,830
And you ran me out of town.

587
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:41,310
Now it's taken me five
years to stop hating you.

588
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:43,900
Great party, ladies.

589
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:45,580
Thank you very much.

590
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:47,810
Now... Mind if I steal my wife?

591
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:49,450
Sweetheart?

592
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:58,940
Isn't that your painter?

593
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:04,210
Is it? I can't tell.

594
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:15,340
Ooh! Excuse me. It's okay.

595
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,170
Didn't they pay the bill?

596
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:30,200
All right. Calm down.
I'll take care of it.

597
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,620
You, come with me.

598
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,920
Why would you humiliate
me in front of my friends?

599
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:38,390
Are you a lunatic?

600
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,680
I-i'm just trying to
get through to you.

601
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:44,290
And, yeah, it's
making me kinda crazy.

602
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,240
Susan... Why can't
I meet your friends?

603
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:51,290
I mean, am I really that horrible?

604
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,990
No, of course not. My
friends would love you.

605
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,660
Then what is the problem?

606
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,940
The problem is,

607
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:59,410
If you meet my friends,
then we're in a relationship,

608
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,580
And I can't be in a
relationship right now.

609
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:05,010
But i-i promise, I'll
make you very happy.

610
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,830
Well, Maybe I don't
deserve to be happy.

611
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,850
A few years ago...

612
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,050
There was this car accident...

613
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:30,700
A bad one.

614
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,130
Take the high road?

615
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:36,120
Did you hear what those
smug bitches said to me?

616
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:38,120
Edie, it's important
these people like us.

617
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:39,340
It's our home now.

618
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:41,960
I never should've let you
talk me into moving back here.

619
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:45,210
Why? Why were you so
gung ho on Wisteria Lane?

620
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,850
Listen to your husband.
We can be happy here,

621
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:51,890
But we need these people to like us.

622
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:53,560
Why?

623
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:58,010
It'll just make everything easier.

624
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:02,510
That was an accident.

625
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,400
Susan, you can't
feel guilty about it.

626
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:06,190
You know what, Jackson?
You're not gonna say anything

627
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,240
I haven't Already
heard a million Times.

628
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:10,850
I-i only told you because i...

629
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,970
I just want you to understand

630
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,060
Why I can't let you in my life.

631
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:18,890
Well...

632
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:24,360
Do you mind if I hang out
for the next few months

633
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,330
And see if you change your mind?

634
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:32,190
Yeah, I guess I could handle that.

635
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:40,290
Well, why don't you...

636
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,430
Go have fun with your friends?

637
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:44,720
And just call me when you're free.

638
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:45,940
Okay.

639
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,360
Please, Danielle. You
have no right to take him.

640
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,790
I have every right. He's my kid.

641
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:14,780
Danielle, we agreed
I would raise him.

642
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:16,230
We agreed it would be best!

643
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,090
You said it would be best!
I've had no say in anything!

644
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,800
But I am married now,
and Leo's a lawyer.

645
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:24,450
So do yourself a favor and
don't try to fight this!

646
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:28,200
Please, Danielle, we can
have any arrangement you like.

647
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:30,100
Please, just don't take him!

648
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:32,740
For god sakes, Orson's gone.

649
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:35,220
You kids are grown.
Benjamin's All I have!

650
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,510
You're just gonna have
tfind something else.

651
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:45,160
Honey, come to bed. It's after 2:00.

652
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:51,410
The cooking show agreed
to redo my segment.

653
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,440
I wanna make sure
it's perfect this Time.

654
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,040
Well, I won't tell you
how to run your business.

655
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,540
It's your baby.

656
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:04,560
Yes, it is.

657
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:45,740
Hey. Um, m.J. Ready?

658
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:47,770
Yeah, he's upstairs waiting for you.

659
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,520
I told you the brakes were squeaking.

660
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:58,170
I asked you to get them
checked. And I checked 'em!

661
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,760
I meant a mechanic...

662
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:02,830
Not you. It was not
the brakes, Susan.

663
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,560
If it had been, it
wouldn't have Mattered.

664
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:07,490
They crashed into us!
And we killed them, Mike!

665
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,560
We didn't kill them! They died.

666
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:11,940
They were a mother and a child.

667
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:13,850
She was a mother, just like me...

668
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,800
With a child just like ours.

669
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:18,120
And if it weren't for us,
they would still be Alive.

670
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:20,480
Yeah, we have been over
and over this, Susan.

671
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:24,310
It's--it's like you want to suffer.
It's like you don't care at All,

672
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,930
Like you feel nothing
for those people.

673
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:28,960
I can't do this again! I just can't!

674
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:39,440
Hey. Did you pack your dinosaur book

675
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:41,820
So you can read it with
your daddy? Sure did.

676
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:43,970
Oh, good. Mmm.

677
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,680
Okay, you have fun, sweetie.

678
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:50,890
So, um, I'll probably bring him
back sunday around 6:00 or so.

679
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,230
Fine.

680
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,320
Well, have a good weekend.
Doing anything special?

681
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:02,080
Well, I've sort of
starteseeing someone.

682
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:06,670
So I might do something with him.

683
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,680
Good for you.

684
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:25,530
It goes by so quickly.

685
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,760
In a flash,

686
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:31,220
The life we knew is gone forever.

687
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,790
And we're left to ask ourselves...

688
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:38,190
How could he have left me?

689
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:46,140
When did my beauty start to fade?

690
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:52,510
Why has my friend changed?

691
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:59,590
Was I the best mother
I could have been?

692
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,860
Of course, there are some people

693
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:08,040
Who understand how
quickly Time passes.

694
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,310
That's why they're so determined

695
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,980
To get what they want

696
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:19,530
Before it's too late.

697
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,460
Oh, dr. Heller. I've
been meaning to call you.

698
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:27,770
Yeah, I was getting concerned.

699
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,940
You're required to
check in once a month.

700
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:32,290
It was a condition of your release.

701
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:34,410
Oh, come on. That was a year ago.

702
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:36,170
But to be honest, the
meds are working so well,

703
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:38,320
I kinda forgot about you. No offense.

704
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:42,520
Dave, once a month. Not optional.

705
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,180
Message received, doc.

706
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:47,740
But seriously, you don't need
to worry about me. I'm great.

707
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,670
I'll talk to you in a month.

708
00:40:58,290 --> 00:40:59,190
Just tell me.

709
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,160
What are the magic
words that I've gotta say

710
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:04,120
So you will let me out of here?
Dave, you've been here six weeks,

711
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:05,400
And you don't seem any closer

712
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:09,560
To coming to terms with your
rage. I've come to terms with it,

713
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:11,650
And I like it just the way it is.

714
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:14,350
The charges were dropped
because you agreed

715
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,410
To put yourself in a doctor's care.

716
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:18,320
I'm not going to
authorize your release

717
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:19,900
Until I see some real progress.

718
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:22,660
Wh-what's progress supposed
to look like to you, doc?

719
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:25,670
I mean, should I just plaster
some fake smile on my face

720
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,540
And pretend this--this
thing that's inside me

721
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:28,510
Isn't eatin' me Alive?

722
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,500
'cause I can do that if you
want. I need to make sure

723
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:32,540
You're not a danger to
yourself or to others.

724
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:37,330
Listen, I've never
been a danger to myself.

725
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:40,200
And as far as the
others are concerned,

726
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:43,770
There's only one person
who should be worried.
