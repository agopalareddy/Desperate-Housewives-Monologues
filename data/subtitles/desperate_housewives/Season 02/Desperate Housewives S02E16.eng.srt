previously on...

3
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,798
you put my kids in danger,
and then you lied about it.

4
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:08,759
Do you have some kind of problem with alcohol?

5
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:10,469
<i>Lynette asked a loaded question.</i></i>

6
00:00:10,636 --> 00:00:13,055
I'm the one who was sleeping with your son,

7
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,139
but it's over now.

8
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:17,643
No, you're wrong.
It's not even close to being over.

9
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:19,144
<i>Gabrielle confessed...</i></i>

10
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:20,270
here's your mail.

11
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:22,356
<i>While noah's search for Zach...</i></i>

12
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:23,815
I worry for that boy.

13
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,360
What kind of people
would buy a baby from a junkie?

14
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:28,695
<i>...Played perfectly into Felicia's plot...</i></i>

15
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:32,824
see that Paul young
has a toy chest of his very own.

16
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:34,576
<i>...for revenge.</i></i>

17
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,831
<i>What made my husband Paul young
such a good investor</i></i>

18
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:43,502
<i>was his uncanny ability
to anticipate the future...</i></i>

19
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:46,338
Zach, how did you do this?

20
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:49,424
<i>He foresaw the necessity of the Velcro shoe.</i></i>

21
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:54,721
<i>He predicted the advent
of the $3 cup of coffee.</i></i>

22
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:59,560
<i>He even anticipated
the surprising boom in bottled water.</i></i>

23
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:01,979
<i>Yeah, it's Paul young.</i></i>

24
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:05,065
I've been reading about
the election results in brazil.

25
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:06,567
It's time to buy sugar.

26
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:14,867
<i>but the crystal ball
that served Paul so well in the stock market</i></i>

27
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:18,579
<i>sometimes failed him closer to home.</i></i>

28
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,497
- Paul young?
- Yeah.

29
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:21,748
Detective Sullivan.

30
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:23,542
You need to come downtown for questioning.

31
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:24,543
About what?

32
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,212
We're investigating reports
of credit card fraud,

33
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,965
and your name has been linked with several of the victims.

34
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:32,217
Well, it must be some mistake.

35
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:33,218
Could be.

36
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:35,721
But we still need to go downtown
and straighten it out.

37
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:37,347
All right.

38
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:39,141
Well...

39
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:40,559
how long is this gonna take?

40
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:42,769
Don't worry about it. It's just a mix-up.

41
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:53,614
Let's go.

42
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:03,290
What's going on? I thought
you just wanted to ask me some questions.

43
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:06,251
- That's after you're booked. Booked?
- Booked for what?

44
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:09,046
You can't book him here anyhow, detective.

45
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:10,839
Computers are down.

46
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:12,674
We're all full up.

47
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,051
You gotta take him down to county.

48
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,844
What is going on? This is crazy.

49
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,471
I wanna call my lawyer.

50
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:20,557
What the hell do you guys think
you're doing anyway? Huh?

51
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:23,894
This is ridiculous.

52
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:30,108
I get a phone call!

53
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,278
Yes, in the world of investments,

54
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:37,491
<i>my husband had
a remarkable ability to see the future.</i></i>

55
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:40,536
Got a message for you, Paul young.

56
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:45,958
Deirdre's father said to give you his regards.

57
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:48,627
Aah!

58
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:52,756
<i>But sadly,
Paul didn't see this one coming at all.</i></i>

59
00:02:57,553 --> 00:02:59,888
Season 2 Episode 16:
There is No Other Way

60
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:01,390
<i>Bree van de kamp</i></i>

61
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:05,936
<i>had a weekly routine
she'd been following for years.</i></i>

62
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,315
<i>She cleaned on Tuesdays.</i></i>

63
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:14,111
<i>She paid her bills on Wednesdays.</i></i>

64
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:18,240
<i>She did her laundry on Thursdays.</i></i>

65
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:21,285
<i>And after these daily chores were completed,</i></i>

66
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:25,038
<i>she would reward herself
with a little drink.</i></i>

67
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:28,292
<i>What bree didn't know
was this latest addition to her routine</i></i>

68
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:31,461
<i>had been noticed by her friends.</i></i>

69
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:36,383
<i>And it had now become
part of their routine to discuss it.</i></i>

70
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:40,470
So apparently bree had a few too many
and passed out.

71
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:43,348
Next thing I know, I get a call at work

72
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:45,267
someone found my kids wandering the street.

73
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:46,602
Oh, my god!

74
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,228
Have you seen bree since?

75
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,147
No. I'm worried about her,

76
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,858
but I don't know how I'm gonna
get over what she did.

77
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:03,160
hey, bree.

78
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:04,036
How you doing today?

79
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:06,205
I'm really well.

80
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:10,167
Um, I just saw you all talking
before Lynette went off to work.

81
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:11,835
What were you all talking about?

82
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,462
Oh, nothing, really.

83
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:16,256
Carlos and I are gonna go
see the adoption counselor today.

84
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,508
I'm checking myself into the hospital.

85
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,051
I'm finally gonna get that surgery.

86
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,637
Oh. Good for you.

87
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:26,058
Did Lynette mention the little tiff we had?

88
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:27,142
Just in passing.

89
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:28,852
She barely mentioned it.

90
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:30,145
Because what happened was,

91
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:33,899
I accidentally mixed
my antihistamine medication with,

92
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:36,151
you know, a little glass of wine I was having,
and I-

93
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,612
I fell asleep, you know, while I was...

94
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,489
watching her kids.

95
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:43,408
I mean, I like a little wine with dinner,

96
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,869
I mean, now and then. You know, who doesn't?

97
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,704
But, uh, I mean,

98
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,998
you know, to trash my entire reputation

99
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:53,877
oh, bree, she didn't trash you. Honest.

100
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,547
Well, good. I mean, I just--

101
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,299
I really wouldn't want you
to get the wrong impression.

102
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,009
Well, I'm--I'm going to the mall.

103
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:02,177
They're having a white sale today.

104
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:04,221
I think I'm gonna get a new bath mat.

105
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:06,181
Oh, does anyone need one?

106
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:09,810
- No, I'm good.
- Okay, take care.

107
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:16,400
Wow, did you smell the alcohol on her breath?

108
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:18,527
I sure did.

109
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:19,653
Oh.

110
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,948
Then our Eskimo turns in the camera and says,

111
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,492
"polar fresh mints will give your breath

112
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,120
an 'a'-plus, too."

113
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:32,583
So what do you think?

114
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,043
It feels a little familiar.

115
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:37,546
Really? I don't think so.

116
00:05:37,713 --> 00:05:39,631
No, I'm pretty sure
the Lowell group used Eskimos

117
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,758
in a deodorant commercial they had last month.
Remember?

118
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:42,801
Oh, this is completely different.

119
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:45,429
Those were jock Eskimos
competing in the Iditarod.

120
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:46,847
Our Eskimo's trying to, you know,

121
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:47,890
patch things up with his wife.

122
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:50,559
Yeah. No, I get the subtle distinction.

123
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:53,979
I think we can do better.

124
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:56,356
Okay? So, Sally, you're up.

125
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,859
What do you got for me?

126
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:04,740
Hey.

127
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:05,657
Hey.

128
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,868
"I got the subtle distinction"?

129
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,036
What was that about?

130
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:11,413
If you really wanna do this now,
shut the door.

131
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:13,624
Okay, sure, I was a little bitchy.

132
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:15,751
But you know why?
You did a half-ass job in there.

133
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:17,169
Hey, you may not like my idea,

134
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:19,046
but you can't say I didn't work hard.

135
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:20,881
Oh, please.

136
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,299
I live with you.

137
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:24,801
Last night, when you should've been trying
to make that pitch work,

138
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:25,844
you were watching the game.

139
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:27,221
I wasn't watching the game.

140
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,472
I saw you!

141
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:30,599
What, okay, now I can't check the score?

142
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:33,519
Are you saying you gave your heart
and soul to that Eskimo pitch?

143
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:36,230
I worked really hard on that pitch.

144
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:38,774
Did you give it 100%?

145
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:40,984
Well, exactly. So? Big deal.

146
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,403
Go work up some new ideas,

147
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,073
and then we'll go over it during lunch.

148
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:47,658
Okay?

149
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,828
You're the boss.

150
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,665
Yes, I am.

151
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,001
Hey.

152
00:06:58,168 --> 00:06:59,419
Susan.

153
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:00,712
Good to see you again.

154
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,090
I'm really looking forward to your surgery.

155
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:04,883
And I'm really hoping you're a lefty.

156
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:06,677
Nope. I can't even write my name.

157
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:10,597
But that's what I get for
throwing my kid a roller-skating party.

158
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,141
Funny. So what about my surgery?

159
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:15,143
Oh, I'll still do it.

160
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:17,312
With dr. Ron's help, of course.

161
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,231
Dr. Cunningham will be standing
right beside me.

162
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,524
With my hands and his brain,

163
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:22,192
you got the best parts of both of us.

164
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:23,944
Then I'm on board.

165
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:25,612
We're keeping you under observation, so,

166
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,031
hopefully, we'll operate tomorrow.

167
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:29,616
Uh, if you don't mind,

168
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,577
I'd like a minute
to consult with my patient.

169
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:36,039
Oh! Right, your, um, little thing.

170
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,042
What "little thing"?

171
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:42,921
Um, well, it was--
it was gonna be a surprise, but...

172
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:46,758
Oh, my god,

173
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,428
they're beautiful.

174
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:53,891
Um, look, I've been thinking about us

175
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,475
a lot lately--

176
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:58,478
about putting this operation behind us
and where we'll go from there.

177
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,230
Our future...

178
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,524
together.

179
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,736
And I really suck at putting my emotions
into words, which is, um,

180
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:08,113
it's why I wrote it all down.

181
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,615
There's a card.

182
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:10,699
Oh.

183
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,659
Uh, but you can't read it.

184
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:13,744
Not--not while I'm here anyway.

185
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:15,787
It's way, way too stressful.

186
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:19,208
Um, I am going to go now.

187
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:29,218
Wow.

188
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:32,846
Wow.

189
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:37,643
Oh, he's so romantic.

190
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:39,811
May I?

191
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:43,273
Oh, it's sort of private.

192
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:45,484
Well, I did help him pick out the flowers.

193
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:47,444
Oh. Um...

194
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:51,031
okay.

195
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:57,955
There's more on the back.

196
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:06,004
so how does this work?

197
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:07,965
Do we flip through a catalog or something?

198
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,716
I wish it was that easy.

199
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:11,760
You have to understand, for every baby,

200
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,512
there are ten couples who want it.

201
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:17,099
You don't choose your child.
The birth mother chooses you.

202
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:18,517
Really?

203
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:20,519
So what do you think our chances are?

204
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:22,771
We will do anything that we need to do.

205
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,816
Well, your typical birth mother
is usually a young girl,

206
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:28,068
and she'll just wanna make sure
you're quality people.

207
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:29,069
Now to show her that,

208
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,655
you'll be putting together
a parent portfolio.

209
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,406
What's that?

210
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:34,825
Family pictures, character references,

211
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:36,285
that kind of stuff.

212
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:40,289
So, um, we're auditioning to be parents?

213
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:41,832
I guess you could say that.

214
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:43,041
So just to be clear,

215
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,420
some slutty cheerleader
gets knocked up by the soccer coach

216
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:52,467
behind the local gas'n gulp, and she is going
to make sure we're quality people?

217
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:56,763
you don't need to answer that.

218
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:06,023
You know, you don't have to hide it from me.

219
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,065
Hmm?

220
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:09,568
Drinking. It doesn't bother me.

221
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:11,612
Ohio wasn't hiding anything.

222
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,530
I was simply...

223
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:15,616
enjoying the day.

224
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:16,325
What you want?

225
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:19,494
Well, um, mason was my ride to school.

226
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,914
And his dad's moving them to Tucson so...

227
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,209
oh, well, if you need a ride to school,
I'm happy to drive you.

228
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:28,170
No, that's not what I want. I want a car.

229
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:30,255
Well, then I suggest you get a job.

230
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,050
Why should I go work my ass off
at some fast food place

231
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:35,928
when I can already afford what I want?

232
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,805
Andrew, we're not touching your trust fund.

233
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,933
- It's my money.
- Not until you're 21.

234
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:43,977
And if I had my way, you wouldn't get
your hands-on it until you're 50.

235
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:47,689
I mean, we both know
you're gonna waste every penny of it.

236
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:50,025
Why are you being like this?

237
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,528
Because, sweetheart,

238
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:55,864
it is my job to teach you
about responsibility,

239
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:59,660
setting goals, delayed gratification.

240
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:02,246
What do you know about delayed gratification?

241
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:05,707
It's not even noon, yet
you're already on your third glass of wine.

242
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:08,377
You know, on second thought,
I won't be driving you to school.

243
00:11:08,544 --> 00:11:10,128
The walk will do you good.

244
00:11:10,254 --> 00:11:11,755
Mom, I'm not kidding around.

245
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,714
I want my money.

246
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,300
The answer is no.

247
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:16,802
Well, aren't we a mean old drunk?

248
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:23,141
Whatever that was supposed to teach me,

249
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:26,103
consider the lesson learned.

250
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,112
oh. Whoo.

251
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:36,905
What are you doing here?

252
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:39,658
I'm just enjoying the silky
smooth moves of dr. Ron.

253
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:41,869
Or should I say, "dr. Love"?

254
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,288
- Give me that. Aah!
- This is my favorite--

255
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:46,331
"I can't wait to be in the operating room with you

256
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:48,500
"so I can touch your heart,

257
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:51,295
"because you've already touched mine so deeply."

258
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,672
Okay, that part sounds better
when you don't read it out loud.

259
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:55,132
And what are you doing reading it anyway?

260
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:57,176
Those are dr. Ron's private thoughts.

261
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:58,343
Yeah, I got that.

262
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:01,138
You know,
I sense that he really likes you, Susie.

263
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:01,847
So?

264
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:03,765
So do you really like him?

265
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:04,850
Of course I do.

266
00:12:05,017 --> 00:12:08,395
He's smart and funny and kind.

267
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:09,855
Smart, funny, kind.

268
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:11,523
I don't hear the word "love" in there.

269
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,817
Well, that's a big word.

270
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:16,236
We just started dating,
and we have a connection,

271
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:18,864
and I'm gonna follow it through
and see where it goes.

272
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:22,743
Oh, I get it. You're gonna string him along
till you feel something you don't

273
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,245
and waste the next five years of your life.

274
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,915
As opposed to the 12I wasted on you?

275
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,374
Why are we talking about this?

276
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,960
I don't recall asking you your opinion.

277
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,671
Because we're married
and I have certain rights,

278
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,632
and one of them is the right to badger you.

279
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:38,509
Okay, you know, you can leave now.

280
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:40,719
I wish I could M.R.I. Your soul--

281
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:42,596
out!

282
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:45,474
it's not funny.

283
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:50,854
hey, watch out for my wife. She's on a tear.

284
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:56,193
Oh, here's one we took on vacation.

285
00:12:57,903 --> 00:13:00,239
Hmm. Gaby,
these pictures have to be wholesome.

286
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:01,990
They gotta say...

287
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:05,410
"these people will do a great job
raising a child."

288
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:06,662
So?

289
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:08,330
So you're topless.

290
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:10,165
Yeah, but it's st. Barts,

291
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:13,210
and your hands are covering
my naughty parts.

292
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:15,504
Do you mean the hand that's holding
the tequila shot,

293
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:18,090
or the one that's holding the Cuban cigar?

294
00:13:18,257 --> 00:13:20,259
Yeah, that was a good trip.

295
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:21,760
Gaby!

296
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:24,888
- Fine. We won't use it.
- We can't use any of 'em.

297
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:26,181
Every single picture of the two of us,

298
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,725
we're either drinking or smoking or naked.

299
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:31,103
So we like to have fun.
I mean, who doesn't understand that

300
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:34,565
better than an unwed, knocked-up teenager?

301
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:35,649
This is serious.

302
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:38,443
If we can't sell ourselves as good people...

303
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:45,868
well, then we'll just have to find someone
who can do it for us.

304
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,328
So you want me to, uh...

305
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:49,997
pitch you as parents?

306
00:13:50,164 --> 00:13:51,999
You're in advertising. You can do it.

307
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:56,003
Just write us a character reference
saying we're great with kids.

308
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,213
Oh, this is for you.

309
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,965
Oh. Well, you don't have to bribe me.

310
00:14:00,132 --> 00:14:02,092
We're all friends here.

311
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:06,597
keeping that in mind, would it also be okay
if we were your kids' godparents?

312
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:09,057
Oh! Uh... I guess.

313
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:11,685
Great, and can we take
some fake pictures to document it?

314
00:14:14,146 --> 00:14:16,773
I don't suppose you brought a corkscrew?

315
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,650
You didn't have a warrant,
and if you don't arrest him,

316
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:21,361
then you gotta tell me what he wants.

317
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,988
Hello, mike.

318
00:14:23,155 --> 00:14:24,489
Felicia, what are you doing here?

319
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:26,283
Ohio left in such a rush.

320
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:29,244
There was a lot of old business
I forgot to wrap up.

321
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,371
Well, it must be pretty important business,

322
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:34,291
gets you to move back in next door
to the man you think murdered your sister.

323
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,376
It's funny you should mention Paul.

324
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,546
You know, the police came
and took him away last night.

325
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,423
The police?

326
00:14:41,757 --> 00:14:43,800
And from the way they were manhandling him,

327
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:46,345
oh, I don't think he'll be back anytime soon.

328
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:51,350
(Zach) no, I just wanna talk to him, that's all...

329
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:56,897
what the hell's going on?

330
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:58,857
It's none of your concern, mike.

331
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:01,235
You listen to me,
if anything happens to Paul young

332
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,737
it already happened.

333
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:06,490
Hours ago.

334
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:08,742
He's dead?

335
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:10,077
Like I said,

336
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:12,037
it's none of your concern.

337
00:15:12,204 --> 00:15:14,915
Maybe you don't get it, Noah.
You screwed up.

338
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:18,001
You just killed the most important person
in your grandson's life.

339
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:21,004
Do you think he's gonna have anything
to do with you once he finds out?

340
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,589
And believe me,

341
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:24,925
I'll make sure he finds out.

342
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:38,605
So, honey, the meat loaf--it's, um,
it's a little burnt.

343
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,482
Oh, right, I was talking
to Susan on the phone,

344
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:43,819
and I left it in a little longer
than I should've. Sorry.

345
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:46,405
It's okay.

346
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:49,241
is it that bad?

347
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:51,660
No. No, not bad at all.

348
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:52,703
Oh, good.

349
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:55,914
Parker, don't put your elbows on the table.
Come on.

350
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:58,250
But you'd agree it wasn't your best effort.

351
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,501
Huh?

352
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:02,045
The meal, the task you agreed to take on.

353
00:16:02,254 --> 00:16:05,465
You'd agree that you didn't give it 100%,
right?

354
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:07,176
Tom, if you're gonna make a point,

355
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:10,012
why don't you do it now
before I hurl the plate at you?

356
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:12,264
Nobody gives 100% of his effort
all the time because they can't.

357
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:13,515
It is impossible.

358
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,435
You do the best you can
with the time and energy you have.

359
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,062
Stop right there. This is meat loaf.

360
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:21,732
your presentation was business.

361
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:26,069
You're saying the client deserves
more effort than your own family?

362
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:32,910
Okay.

363
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:36,663
So if I apologize for upsetting you at work,

364
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,208
can we get past it and enjoy our meal?

365
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,460
Absolutely.

366
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:45,881
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I am sorry.

367
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:47,382
Thanks.

368
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:53,305
So, boys, how do you enjoy the meat loaf?

369
00:16:53,472 --> 00:16:54,765
It's a little salty.

370
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:55,974
yeah.

371
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:58,852
Just eat it.

372
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:04,107
there.

373
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:06,568
Perfect.

374
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:10,072
All right.

375
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:26,255
all right, one more time.

376
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,172
What?

377
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:28,006
Yeah.

378
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:30,133
Dude, I don't wanna mess up your face.

379
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:32,135
Do you love me?

380
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:35,931
Then do what I tell you.

381
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:45,065
Rough day.

382
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:46,608
Yeah.

383
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:52,781
I wonder if there's any way
that we can turn it around still.

384
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:56,702
Good question.

385
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:58,620
But what to do? What to do?

386
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:00,706
Yeah.

387
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:18,807
Hi! What's up?

388
00:18:18,974 --> 00:18:20,309
Why do you keep trying to do that?

389
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:21,935
- What?
- Trying to get on top.

390
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:23,270
Of you? No, I'm not.

391
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,439
You were pushing on me
like you were trying to sack me.

392
00:18:25,564 --> 00:18:26,440
I felt it.

393
00:18:26,565 --> 00:18:27,983
Are you serious?

394
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:31,403
Tom, I wasn't doing anything.
I was just going for it.

395
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:34,948
I was just lost in the moment. Oh, come on!

396
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:38,535
Come on, this is silly. I don't wanna argue.

397
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,497
I mean, unless it turns you on.

398
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:45,083
Does it? 'Cause then I'm all about it, baby.

399
00:18:51,423 --> 00:18:52,424
What--what was that?

400
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:53,884
What--what was what?

401
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:55,093
You were bracing.

402
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,470
You were bracing with your leg.

403
00:18:56,595 --> 00:18:57,763
I was trying to lie on top of you,

404
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:59,848
and you were bracing yourself
against the mattress

405
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:01,600
so you didn't have to get on your back.

406
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:03,727
Try and deny it. Try and deny it. You can't.

407
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:07,022
Okay, okay, can I just mention
you're talking like a crazy person?

408
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:08,982
You can't give it up for a second, can you?

409
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:11,276
You always have to call the shots. Always.

410
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:14,488
Is this about me being boss again?

411
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:16,949
You gotta get over it.

412
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:20,327
That's exactly my point.

413
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:21,703
Exactly.

414
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:24,081
You are not just my boss at the office.

415
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:25,374
You're my boss everywhere.

416
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:27,292
Oh, that's ridiculous.

417
00:19:27,793 --> 00:19:29,127
You run the show.

418
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:30,754
You run the show,
and I'm along for the ride.

419
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:32,548
I just push the little shopping cart,

420
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:34,424
let the woman do all the driving.

421
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:37,427
- Tom...
- I'm the caddy husband.

422
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:41,056
I carry your clubs.

423
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,101
I am so sorry you feel that way,

424
00:19:44,268 --> 00:19:47,229
but you cannot put that on me.

425
00:19:47,396 --> 00:19:49,147
This is your life.

426
00:19:49,273 --> 00:19:50,399
You wanna run it?

427
00:19:50,566 --> 00:19:52,484
Then step on up.

428
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:54,194
You wanna drive?

429
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:55,904
Grab the steering wheel.

430
00:19:55,988 --> 00:20:00,117
I mean-- what else am I supposed to say?

431
00:20:01,577 --> 00:20:04,580
I'm gonna check on the kids.

432
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:15,716
Time to check your blood pressure.

433
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:17,968
Oh, sure.

434
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:23,265
Oh, that's a little tight.
Does it have to be that tight?

435
00:20:23,432 --> 00:20:25,517
- Yes.
- Oh.

436
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:35,235
okay. Ow,ow.
That's actually starting to be painful.

437
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,487
Really? That surprises me.

438
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:39,406
I just assumed you were dead inside.

439
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:41,992
Ow! Ow! What the hell are you doing?

440
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,536
I told myself to stay out of this,
but I can't.

441
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:45,996
I know that you're married.

442
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:47,206
I am not!

443
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:52,294
Really? Hmm, 'cause that man that came
to see you yesterday, he said you're his wife.

444
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:53,837
Oh! Yeah, oh...

445
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:56,215
no, no, he just said that 'cause
we used to be married.

446
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,299
It's just a force of habit.

447
00:20:57,424 --> 00:20:58,926
Oh, that explains everything.

448
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:01,470
Except that I checked your insurance forms,
and you're still married.

449
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:04,556
So that makes you a lying, adulterous skank.

450
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:06,517
Oh, no. No, no. No, no, nurse Hisel.

451
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:10,938
Ow,ow,ow,ow!Ow, nurse hisel!

452
00:21:11,522 --> 00:21:13,148
Ugh! Nurse--oh!

453
00:21:18,654 --> 00:21:20,989
Nurse hisel, I can explain.

454
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:22,241
Can you, skank?

455
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:24,535
Yes. Okay.

456
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:27,955
I am married, but it's only because
my insurance ran out.

457
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,123
My ex-husband has a really good
coverage plan,

458
00:21:30,249 --> 00:21:32,167
so he said that he would remarry me

459
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:33,877
so I could get my operation.

460
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:35,128
Only I didn't wanna tell dr. Ron

461
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:39,216
'cause I didn't want him
to be an accomplice to fraud.

462
00:21:39,383 --> 00:21:41,343
So you're what...

463
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,928
protecting him?

464
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:45,931
Yeah. It--yes, I am.

465
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:49,351
Okay.

466
00:21:49,518 --> 00:21:51,854
As long as you're not two-timing him.

467
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,605
He feels so strongly about you.

468
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:55,983
I know. I read the card.

469
00:21:56,108 --> 00:21:58,235
But did you read between the lines?

470
00:21:58,402 --> 00:21:59,444
What do you mean?

471
00:21:59,611 --> 00:22:01,738
Okay, I shouldn't be telling you this,

472
00:22:01,864 --> 00:22:03,949
but when we were picking out
the flowers for you,

473
00:22:04,366 --> 00:22:08,996
he said that he was working up the courage to say he loves you.

474
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:09,830
Really?

475
00:22:09,955 --> 00:22:11,540
Yes!

476
00:22:11,665 --> 00:22:13,417
But you have to act surprised, okay?

477
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,211
Oh, yeah, I'll be surprised.

478
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:19,590
So I guess we have the whole insurance
thing worked out.

479
00:22:19,756 --> 00:22:22,968
Oh! Pfft. Don't worry about that. Please.

480
00:22:23,135 --> 00:22:24,928
Who am I to cast stones?

481
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:26,346
I mean, heck...

482
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:29,057
I didn't pass my nurse's exam.

483
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:32,853
They didn't even ask me!

484
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:44,406
Andrew, did I hear the bell?

485
00:22:44,573 --> 00:22:45,491
Oh, hello.

486
00:22:45,657 --> 00:22:47,826
I'm Samuel Bormanis. I'm here to see Andrew.

487
00:22:47,993 --> 00:22:50,329
Oh, okay. Are you a friend of Andrew's?

488
00:22:50,412 --> 00:22:51,497
I'm his lawyer.

489
00:22:51,622 --> 00:22:54,750
His lawyer? Well, why on earth
would Andrew need a lawyer?

490
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:56,543
Here you go, Sam.

491
00:22:58,754 --> 00:23:03,008
honey, what happened to-- to your face?

492
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:04,426
I...

493
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:06,053
you hit me.

494
00:23:06,178 --> 00:23:09,306
Don't you remember?

495
00:23:10,766 --> 00:23:12,809
For the record, I did not punch my son.

496
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:15,395
I slapped him with an open palm.

497
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:17,189
Yeah, but, mom, the thing is,

498
00:23:17,356 --> 00:23:20,150
when you drink,
you don't know your own strength.

499
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:21,610
This is ridiculous.

500
00:23:21,777 --> 00:23:23,320
Can't you see this is a performance?

501
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:25,322
Mrs. Van de kamp, I've heard enough.

502
00:23:25,489 --> 00:23:28,200
Clearly, this environment is a highly
dysfunctional one.

503
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:33,288
Andrew has retained my services in order
to pursue a healthier living situation.

504
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:34,623
And what might that be?

505
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:37,376
I, um, I wanna be emancipated.

506
00:23:37,543 --> 00:23:39,002
Emancipated?

507
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:42,339
As an emancipated minor,
Andrew would be able to live on his own.

508
00:23:42,506 --> 00:23:43,715
He'd still go to school, of course,

509
00:23:43,882 --> 00:23:47,553
but he'd be released
from all adult supervision.

510
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:50,722
Well, that's the silliest thing
I've ever heard of.

511
00:23:50,848 --> 00:23:52,599
How would he support himself?

512
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:57,938
Well, he'd be in complete control
of his own finances.

513
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:02,568
So that's what this is about--your trust fund?

514
00:24:02,734 --> 00:24:06,989
Obviously,
we'd all prefer not to go to family court,

515
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:10,826
but with the violence and your D.U.I. Charge,

516
00:24:10,993 --> 00:24:13,537
it could get ugly.

517
00:24:14,037 --> 00:24:15,038
Uh, mr. Bormanis,

518
00:24:15,205 --> 00:24:17,791
I'll need a little time to think about this.

519
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:20,836
You have 24 hours.

520
00:24:29,178 --> 00:24:31,597
boy, it really looks like
we're having a good time.

521
00:24:31,763 --> 00:24:33,599
I sure hope this works.

522
00:24:33,765 --> 00:24:35,350
Well, as long as they don't
make me play guitar,

523
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:38,228
I think we're home free.

524
00:24:39,271 --> 00:24:42,566
Mr. And Mrs. Solis, Rhoda can see you now.

525
00:24:53,785 --> 00:24:55,579
Wow!

526
00:24:55,746 --> 00:24:58,457
It looks like you spend lots
of time with these kids.

527
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:00,792
Oh, we take our roles
as godparents very seriously.

528
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:03,128
- Don't we, honey?
- Mm-hmm. Yes.

529
00:25:03,629 --> 00:25:07,174
Oh, they're precious. What are their names?

530
00:25:08,342 --> 00:25:11,220
Parker and, uh...

531
00:25:11,637 --> 00:25:13,847
porter, uh...

532
00:25:14,306 --> 00:25:16,975
and, uh...

533
00:25:17,726 --> 00:25:21,271
well, they're all p's. It is super cute.

534
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:24,024
One sec. Do you need me, Helen?

535
00:25:24,316 --> 00:25:26,276
Hello, Gabrielle.

536
00:25:26,443 --> 00:25:28,487
Carlos.

537
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:33,033
I didn't know you were adopting.

538
00:25:34,827 --> 00:25:35,911
Preston!

539
00:25:36,036 --> 00:25:39,164
The other one's name is Preston.

540
00:25:39,331 --> 00:25:41,458
Helen, you work here?

541
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:43,001
You all know each other?

542
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,629
What a small world. It sure is.

543
00:25:45,796 --> 00:25:48,966
Mrs. Solis hired my son to do her yard work.

544
00:25:49,132 --> 00:25:52,636
And also, she would rape him.

545
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:54,513
Okay, first of all, it was statutory,

546
00:25:54,638 --> 00:25:56,723
and it happened so long ago.

547
00:25:56,849 --> 00:25:59,309
Was it?
I think it was only about a year ago.

548
00:25:59,518 --> 00:26:01,019
No, it was a year,

549
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:06,692
because it was right before your husband
went to prison on slave labor charges.

550
00:26:06,817 --> 00:26:08,360
Rhoda, if you don't mind,

551
00:26:08,527 --> 00:26:10,779
I think I'll handle the Solis case myself.

552
00:26:10,946 --> 00:26:13,407
I'd like to make it my top priority. Okay.

553
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:16,910
Oh, and, um, gabrielle,
don't bother trying to contact

554
00:26:17,077 --> 00:26:19,329
any other adoption agencies in the area.

555
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:25,210
I'll make sure they know all about you.

556
00:26:29,882 --> 00:26:31,884
I think I have to break up with dr. Ron.

557
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,677
What? Why?

558
00:26:33,886 --> 00:26:35,721
Because he's a gem.

559
00:26:35,888 --> 00:26:38,056
And apparently he loves me.

560
00:26:38,515 --> 00:26:40,017
I'm sorry. I'm not following.

561
00:26:40,184 --> 00:26:41,727
Lynette, he is everything

562
00:26:41,894 --> 00:26:43,478
I could possibly want in a boyfriend,

563
00:26:43,687 --> 00:26:47,024
and I just don't know if I feel that...

564
00:26:47,191 --> 00:26:48,859
spark.

565
00:26:48,984 --> 00:26:50,444
You know, and I really want to.

566
00:26:50,569 --> 00:26:51,486
Aw, sweetie.

567
00:26:51,612 --> 00:26:53,113
And he keeps telling me how special I am

568
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,698
and how much I mean to him...

569
00:26:54,865 --> 00:26:58,452
how he wants to hold my beating heart
in his hand.

570
00:27:01,121 --> 00:27:04,708
Maybe it's because I just haven't felt
that thunderbolt yet.

571
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:07,544
You know, with mike, it hit me.
With Karl, it hit me.

572
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:08,795
I didn't have to worry about how I felt

573
00:27:08,921 --> 00:27:11,590
because the thunderbolt told me.

574
00:27:11,757 --> 00:27:14,801
Yeah, yeah. Gotta love the thunderbolt.

575
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:17,012
Do I, though? I mean, I do

576
00:27:17,137 --> 00:27:18,764
But I don't trust it anymore.

577
00:27:18,931 --> 00:27:20,933
You know, those relationships turned out
to be disasters.

578
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:23,310
Maybe I should stick it out with dr. Ron,

579
00:27:23,477 --> 00:27:28,023
and I should try heading down a road
that's growing and slower

580
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:32,444
into a sort of kind of love that would
sustain itself for 50 years. Right?

581
00:27:32,569 --> 00:27:35,697
Stability, comfort, endurance-I deserve that.

582
00:27:35,864 --> 00:27:40,577
Oh, yes! Of course you do.

583
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,747
Still, you gotta love the thunderbolt.

584
00:27:43,872 --> 00:27:45,165
That's not helpful.

585
00:27:45,332 --> 00:27:46,959
Sorry.

586
00:27:48,168 --> 00:27:49,253
Ah, this is a sign.

587
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:50,379
Will you shut up?

588
00:27:50,546 --> 00:27:52,881
We lost a baby, found out
we can't conceive another one,

589
00:27:53,048 --> 00:27:56,468
and ran into Helen Rowland at an adoption agency.

590
00:27:56,635 --> 00:27:58,762
God is obviously trying to tell us something.

591
00:27:58,887 --> 00:28:00,222
Carlos, we're Catholics, okay?

592
00:28:00,347 --> 00:28:03,350
God is pretty Johnny one note
on the whole subject of procreation.

593
00:28:03,517 --> 00:28:06,019
Hey, and will you stop
with this defeatist attitude?

594
00:28:06,186 --> 00:28:07,646
Okay, do you want a baby or not?

595
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:09,231
I think it's time that we faced reality--

596
00:28:09,356 --> 00:28:12,568
we're bad people, and we probably
don't even deserve to be parents.

597
00:28:12,818 --> 00:28:14,778
Well, then who the hell does?

598
00:28:14,945 --> 00:28:17,364
I mean, look at all the idiots popping kids.

599
00:28:17,531 --> 00:28:20,659
Okay, they're not any more
qualified than we are.

600
00:28:20,826 --> 00:28:21,869
I don't know.

601
00:28:22,035 --> 00:28:24,079
Look, Carlos...

602
00:28:24,288 --> 00:28:26,707
it doesn't matter
what we've done in our past.

603
00:28:26,832 --> 00:28:28,584
Being a parent means rising to the occasion,

604
00:28:28,709 --> 00:28:33,463
and that's exactly what we're gonna do
when we bring our baby home.

605
00:28:33,714 --> 00:28:38,969
This is the first time I really felt like
you wanted to have a baby.

606
00:28:39,887 --> 00:28:44,725
Well, this is the first time
someone told me I couldn't have one.

607
00:28:48,061 --> 00:28:50,606
Okay, so what are we gonna do?

608
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:54,234
I mean, no adoption agencies
gonna touch us now.

609
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:56,945
There are ways to get babies, Carlos.

610
00:28:56,987 --> 00:28:59,781
It just might cost us.

611
00:29:03,118 --> 00:29:05,412
I have some contacts
in the police department.

612
00:29:05,537 --> 00:29:08,499
I've been making calls, but I can't seem
to get a straight answer about your dad.

613
00:29:08,665 --> 00:29:10,626
I don't understand.
How do they just lose somebody?

614
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:13,337
They don't, not by accident.

615
00:29:13,712 --> 00:29:16,340
But I don't think what happened
to your dad was an accident.

616
00:29:16,507 --> 00:29:18,091
What's that supposed to mean?

617
00:29:19,468 --> 00:29:20,719
Zach!

618
00:29:22,721 --> 00:29:23,597
Mrs. Tillman.

619
00:29:23,805 --> 00:29:27,434
Hello, zachary. You look terrible.

620
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:30,437
Oh, Mr. Delfino.

621
00:29:30,604 --> 00:29:32,648
Isn't this just a picture?

622
00:29:32,773 --> 00:29:34,316
Felicia, why are you here?

623
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:39,029
Young Zachary and I
didn't exactly part on the best of terms.

624
00:29:39,696 --> 00:29:41,865
In fact, when the weather's damp,

625
00:29:42,032 --> 00:29:44,827
I'm still reminded of our last good-bye.

626
00:29:44,993 --> 00:29:48,288
But forgive and forget. That's my motto.

627
00:29:48,455 --> 00:29:51,375
Macaroon?

628
00:30:27,703 --> 00:30:29,163
dad!

629
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,332
You all right?

630
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,973
now how did you know I love macaroons?

631
00:30:56,231 --> 00:30:58,984
it won't end here, you know.
Noah Taylor doesn't give up.

632
00:30:59,109 --> 00:31:01,236
Look, don't worry about us.
We'll be gone by morning.

633
00:31:01,403 --> 00:31:02,779
No, it's too late for that now.

634
00:31:03,113 --> 00:31:05,032
I guarantee he's got people watching you.

635
00:31:05,157 --> 00:31:06,658
What is it with you anyway?

636
00:31:06,825 --> 00:31:07,534
First, you want me to run.

637
00:31:07,701 --> 00:31:10,120
Now you want us to stick around
like sitting ducks for this maniac.

638
00:31:10,287 --> 00:31:13,957
Go ahead, run.
Noah's got the cops in his pocket.

639
00:31:14,124 --> 00:31:15,709
What do you think's gonna happen
the first time you try to buy gas

640
00:31:15,876 --> 00:31:19,796
with a credit card
or open a new bank account?

641
00:31:22,007 --> 00:31:24,051
So I'm a dead man.

642
00:31:25,135 --> 00:31:26,595
Maybe not.

643
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,515
Not if we use what leverage we have.

644
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,724
No way.

645
00:31:30,891 --> 00:31:34,478
The old man's gonna be dead
in a couple of months, maybe less.

646
00:31:34,645 --> 00:31:35,854
Let him meet Zach,

647
00:31:35,979 --> 00:31:38,607
- play the doting grandfather--
- I said forget it.

648
00:31:38,732 --> 00:31:40,526
I'll do it.

649
00:31:42,861 --> 00:31:44,738
If it means he'll leave us alone,

650
00:31:44,863 --> 00:31:48,534
I'm ready to be leveraged.

651
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:55,707
Nicholson will be coming in
in about 15 minutes with a pitch,

652
00:31:55,833 --> 00:32:00,379
so let's grab everybody and make sure
we're all on the same page.

653
00:32:03,298 --> 00:32:06,260
Hang on a second.

654
00:32:08,303 --> 00:32:09,847
What's going on?

655
00:32:10,389 --> 00:32:11,807
I need to say this.

656
00:32:11,974 --> 00:32:13,475
Ah, yeah...

657
00:32:14,768 --> 00:32:17,729
I have been giving you a lot of grief lately
about being the boss.

658
00:32:17,813 --> 00:32:20,148
But it's just hard for a guy to feel like

659
00:32:20,274 --> 00:32:22,317
he's not in charge of any part of his life.

660
00:32:22,484 --> 00:32:24,319
But, honey, it goes back and forth.

661
00:32:24,486 --> 00:32:27,573
I know. But it just feels
a little one-sided lately,

662
00:32:27,698 --> 00:32:31,160
and sometimes I need to drive the train.

663
00:32:31,451 --> 00:32:33,787
But, look, I know it is my issue.

664
00:32:33,954 --> 00:32:35,080
It's my issue,

665
00:32:35,247 --> 00:32:39,668
and I will step up and deal with it.

666
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:46,592
Mmm.

667
00:32:47,384 --> 00:32:49,136
Whoa. Hello.

668
00:32:49,261 --> 00:32:51,013
What's going on, huh?

669
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,307
I'm picking up where we left off.

670
00:32:53,432 --> 00:32:54,391
Last night.

671
00:32:54,516 --> 00:32:56,685
Ohio get it. I get it.

672
00:32:56,894 --> 00:33:00,522
Ooh! This is your idea of driving the train.

673
00:33:00,731 --> 00:33:04,359
And it's very manly and really impressive,

674
00:33:04,484 --> 00:33:08,655
but it's really, really bad timing.

675
00:33:10,032 --> 00:33:12,993
You can't be serious.

676
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:15,829
Mmm. We're gonna--we're gonna be late.

677
00:33:16,038 --> 00:33:22,002
Yeah, we are going to be late.

678
00:33:24,421 --> 00:33:25,214
Okay.

679
00:33:26,465 --> 00:33:28,550
There is nothing more important than family.

680
00:33:28,717 --> 00:33:32,387
And I think it's so unfair some are denied
their god-given right to parent

681
00:33:32,513 --> 00:33:36,058
just because of a few sordid
incidents in their past.

682
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,643
Now

683
00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:41,146
I may have to explore some unconventional
paths to find your child.

684
00:33:41,271 --> 00:33:45,317
I might even have to take action
some might view as unsavory.

685
00:33:45,442 --> 00:33:48,111
But before I do...

686
00:33:48,278 --> 00:33:51,573
I need proof that the two of you
are prepared

687
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:55,744
to face the challenges ahead.

688
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:03,085
$20,000.

689
00:34:03,252 --> 00:34:05,879
Is that proof enough for you?

690
00:34:07,422 --> 00:34:09,842
Yes, it is.

691
00:34:24,857 --> 00:34:27,025
Nice to meet you, young man.

692
00:34:27,192 --> 00:34:28,861
I'm not gonna hug you.

693
00:34:29,027 --> 00:34:30,237
I don't care if you are my grandfather.

694
00:34:30,404 --> 00:34:35,200
Ah. That's okay.
Hugging's not really my thing.

695
00:34:35,367 --> 00:34:37,244
Mike, could you wait outside?

696
00:34:37,411 --> 00:34:39,621
I'd like to be alone with Zachary.

697
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,040
Not a chance.

698
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:44,376
Just curious...

699
00:34:44,543 --> 00:34:46,795
why was it so important you see me?

700
00:34:46,962 --> 00:34:48,672
You're my grandson.

701
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:50,674
My flesh and blood.

702
00:34:51,466 --> 00:34:54,970
Isn't it only natural
I'd want a relationship with you?

703
00:34:55,137 --> 00:34:59,766
What kind of relationship can we have
when I know you tried to kill my dad?

704
00:34:59,933 --> 00:35:03,812
Surely, you can understand the rage
I must feel towards your father.

705
00:35:03,937 --> 00:35:06,106
Go ahead. Feel all the rage you wanna feel.

706
00:35:06,231 --> 00:35:07,774
But if anything happens to him,

707
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:11,153
I swear to god you are never
gonna see me again.

708
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,405
You only met matzo minutes ago,

709
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:14,907
and here you are,

710
00:35:15,073 --> 00:35:17,993
already blackmailing me.

711
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,329
I couldn't be prouder.

712
00:35:20,496 --> 00:35:21,663
I'm serious.

713
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:24,416
I want you to swear
you're not gonna do anything to my dad.

714
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:26,293
Which dad?

715
00:35:26,668 --> 00:35:29,505
You have two of 'em.

716
00:35:35,052 --> 00:35:36,470
You know who I'm talking about--

717
00:35:36,553 --> 00:35:38,263
my dad, the man who raised me,

718
00:35:38,472 --> 00:35:41,308
the only man I'm ever gonna care about.

719
00:35:42,935 --> 00:35:44,937
So swear.

720
00:35:45,521 --> 00:35:46,813
I swear.

721
00:35:47,022 --> 00:35:50,067
Well, now that the ground rules have been set,

722
00:35:50,192 --> 00:35:54,988
who's up for some meaningless small talk?

723
00:36:08,252 --> 00:36:10,379
well, if it isn't the plumber.

724
00:36:10,504 --> 00:36:11,672
You here to see Susan?

725
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:14,383
Uh, yeah, I just wanted to talk
to her before her operation.

726
00:36:14,633 --> 00:36:16,051
Oh? You're cutting it kinda close.

727
00:36:16,218 --> 00:36:18,720
She's just about to be wheeled into surgery.

728
00:36:19,012 --> 00:36:21,515
You know, she's dating her surgeon.

729
00:36:21,765 --> 00:36:23,433
Yeah, she told me.

730
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:25,644
You met him?

731
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:27,145
Yeah.

732
00:36:27,312 --> 00:36:29,523
He's like 6 years old.

733
00:36:29,773 --> 00:36:31,567
those for her?

734
00:36:31,733 --> 00:36:35,112
Yeah. The florist
was having a sale on lilacs.

735
00:36:35,612 --> 00:36:39,908
Dr. Ron just bought her the biggest bouquet
of roses you've ever seen.

736
00:36:40,033 --> 00:36:41,076
It was disgusting.

737
00:36:41,243 --> 00:36:43,829
And the note that went with it
made my teeth hurt, it was so saccharin.

738
00:36:43,996 --> 00:36:48,333
He used words like "soul mate" and "eternity."

739
00:36:48,542 --> 00:36:50,586
I almost puked in the vase.

740
00:36:50,794 --> 00:36:54,673
What'd Susan think about that?

741
00:36:55,048 --> 00:36:58,969
Well, she seemed to be really into it.

742
00:37:02,514 --> 00:37:03,348
Mike!

743
00:37:03,515 --> 00:37:05,434
Oh, wait, stop! Go back!

744
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:07,436
Stop! Stop a second.

745
00:37:07,644 --> 00:37:11,231
Hey! What are you doing here?

746
00:37:11,356 --> 00:37:14,151
I just, uh, wanted to wish you luck
before your surgery.

747
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:17,779
Aw, that's so sweet.

748
00:37:17,946 --> 00:37:21,158
You came all the way down here just for me.

749
00:37:21,283 --> 00:37:23,785
Yep. That's why I came.

750
00:37:23,994 --> 00:37:28,207
Oh, it means a lot to me that you came.

751
00:37:28,373 --> 00:37:29,541
Well, you take care, Susan.

752
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:31,960
Okay.

753
00:37:32,961 --> 00:37:35,255
Bye.

754
00:37:37,382 --> 00:37:39,968
You forgot to give her your flowers.

755
00:37:40,344 --> 00:37:43,889
Ah, it's no big deal.

756
00:37:48,769 --> 00:37:49,895
Hi, susan.

757
00:37:50,062 --> 00:37:52,272
How are those drugs working for you?
You feeling good?

758
00:37:52,439 --> 00:37:55,484
Super-duper. How you feeling?

759
00:37:55,734 --> 00:37:58,278
Well, um, you know I want you to know,

760
00:37:58,403 --> 00:37:59,988
what I said the other day--

761
00:38:00,155 --> 00:38:03,951
that corny stuff about me holding
your heart in my hands--

762
00:38:04,117 --> 00:38:06,411
well, what I meant to say was,

763
00:38:06,537 --> 00:38:09,081
my feelings for you--they keep growing,

764
00:38:09,206 --> 00:38:11,583
and, uh, I think--

765
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:14,795
well, I hope that you feel
the same way about me. Mm.

766
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,339
Ah, hell, susan.

767
00:38:17,464 --> 00:38:19,675
I love you.

768
00:38:19,842 --> 00:38:23,220
Aw, thank you.

769
00:38:23,345 --> 00:38:26,890
I love mike.

770
00:38:27,558 --> 00:38:29,101
Mike?

771
00:38:29,268 --> 00:38:30,894
Susan, who's mike?

772
00:38:31,061 --> 00:38:35,941
Mike is love. Mmm.

773
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,486
Who the hell is mike?

774
00:38:40,028 --> 00:38:42,114
I don't know,
but she's married to a guy named Karl.

775
00:38:42,281 --> 00:38:45,033
I'm so, so sorry.
I should've told you, dr. Ron.

776
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,619
Mmm, mike, mike, mike...

777
00:38:47,786 --> 00:38:51,415
oh, why are you always falling in love
with skanks?

778
00:38:51,582 --> 00:38:53,625
You beautiful, beautiful man!

779
00:38:53,792 --> 00:38:55,627
Oh!

780
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,429
okay, we ready to go here?

781
00:39:05,596 --> 00:39:07,890
Yeah. Sure.

782
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,477
Let's cut this bitch open.

783
00:39:19,818 --> 00:39:20,986
what are you doing?

784
00:39:21,111 --> 00:39:23,530
Your lawyer left a message on my machine.

785
00:39:23,655 --> 00:39:26,074
It seems we have a hearing in four weeks,

786
00:39:26,241 --> 00:39:28,076
and I wanna be ready.

787
00:39:28,702 --> 00:39:29,495
Ohio get it.

788
00:39:29,661 --> 00:39:32,789
So, uh, so you're gonna pretend
to be sober for the judge?

789
00:39:32,956 --> 00:39:34,583
Oh, there's no pretending.

790
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:39,046
I am going to my first A.A. Meeting tomorrow.

791
00:39:39,171 --> 00:39:40,923
Of course, I picked one
in the worst part of town

792
00:39:41,089 --> 00:39:43,217
so I won't run into anybody I know.

793
00:39:43,383 --> 00:39:45,177
Which, of course, means I will.

794
00:39:45,511 --> 00:39:48,013
All right, so what is that gonna prove?

795
00:39:49,181 --> 00:39:51,183
Perception is reality, Andrew.

796
00:39:51,308 --> 00:39:53,477
And if people perceive me
to have a drinking problem,

797
00:39:53,644 --> 00:39:54,561
then I do.

798
00:39:54,728 --> 00:39:57,189
And I certainly don't want
some idiotic judge

799
00:39:57,314 --> 00:40:00,442
using my hobby
as an excuse to make you rich.

800
00:40:00,609 --> 00:40:03,612
So I'm simply going to give up my wine

801
00:40:03,779 --> 00:40:07,783
and become a recovering alcoholic.

802
00:40:08,951 --> 00:40:11,411
Good plan, but it'll never work.

803
00:40:11,578 --> 00:40:15,374
See, I'll bet you still end up
coming to court hammered.

804
00:40:15,791 --> 00:40:18,335
oh, andrew, you don't think
I love you enough to

805
00:40:18,502 --> 00:40:21,213
give up alcohol?

806
00:40:21,755 --> 00:40:23,715
Look, I'm 17,all right?

807
00:40:23,882 --> 00:40:27,094
So you can only keep me here for another year.

808
00:40:27,261 --> 00:40:28,971
Why not just let me go?

809
00:40:29,137 --> 00:40:31,473
Because I'm not done with you yet.

810
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,808
It's my job to teach you,

811
00:40:32,933 --> 00:40:36,103
and you are not half the man
I know you can be.

812
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:38,355
Yeah, well, I got news for you

813
00:40:38,522 --> 00:40:39,481
this is as good as I'm gonna get.

814
00:40:39,606 --> 00:40:40,649
If I really thought that,

815
00:40:40,816 --> 00:40:42,943
I'd get a gun right now and kill us both.

816
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:45,362
Mom, we're both so unhappy.

817
00:40:45,487 --> 00:40:47,239
Why not just let me take my trust fund,

818
00:40:47,406 --> 00:40:49,449
and I'll get out of your hair forever?

819
00:40:49,616 --> 00:40:51,702
Please.

820
00:40:55,914 --> 00:40:59,251
You're a stone cold bitch, you know that?

821
00:41:07,801 --> 00:41:13,140
I'm sorry. I didn't quite catch that.

822
00:41:14,224 --> 00:41:16,143
I hate you.

823
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:19,479
You know, the opposite of love isn't hate.

824
00:41:19,646 --> 00:41:21,273
It's indifference.

825
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,192
And if you hate me,

826
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:25,486
that means you still care,

827
00:41:25,611 --> 00:41:27,488
and we're still connected,

828
00:41:27,654 --> 00:41:32,910
and I still have a chance to set you right.

829
00:41:38,415 --> 00:41:40,459
<i>This is how bree van de kamp</i></i>

830
00:41:40,626 --> 00:41:44,254
<i>finally came to change her weekly routine.</i></i>

831
00:41:44,379 --> 00:41:47,466
<i>She still cleaned on Tuesdays...</i></i>

832
00:41:47,633 --> 00:41:50,844
<i>paid her bills on Wednesdays...</i></i>

833
00:41:51,011 --> 00:41:54,556
<i>and did her laundry on Thursdays.</i></i>

834
00:41:54,723 --> 00:41:56,183
<i>But her Fridays</i></i>

835
00:41:56,308 --> 00:42:00,521
<i>were now reserved for a meeting...</i></i>

836
00:42:00,938 --> 00:42:02,189
<i>a special meeting</i></i>

837
00:42:02,356 --> 00:42:05,776
<i>where she stood in front of people

838
00:42:05,901 --> 00:42:07,861
my name is bree,

839
00:42:07,986 --> 00:42:10,364
and I am an alcoholic.

840
00:42:10,489 --> 00:42:14,660
<i>And said things she didn't believe.</i></i>

841
00:42:16,537 --> 00:42:19,331
<i>And afterwards, bree would come home</i>

842
00:42:19,498 --> 00:42:22,251
