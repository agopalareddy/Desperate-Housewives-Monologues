Previously on "Desperate Housewives"

3
00:00:04,796 --> 00:00:07,257
until the adoption is legally finalized,

4
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:10,594
the birth mother can still change her mind,
and she has.

5
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:12,179
Warrants were issued...

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,096
I'm going to fire tom.

7
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:16,558
If you just fire him,he'll sue you,
and I'll back him up.You need cause.

8
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:18,227
Well,I guess i'll have to find cause.

9
00:00:18,227 --> 00:00:19,561
Decisions were made...

10
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:21,647
I'm going to do something so awful.

11
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:24,149
it is going to rock her world.

12
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,734
Threats were spoken...

13
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:27,611
so what the hell are we gonna do?

14
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,738
And plans...

15
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:31,615
phenobarbital?

16
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:34,368
It's time to give your bther
the peace he deserves.

17
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:36,703
...Were put into action.

18
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,376
the most successful private
investigator in fairview

19
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:45,420
was a man named oliver weston.

20
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,922
Try though he might,

21
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:51,510
oliver couldn't remember the exact
moment he stopped believing in love.

22
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:56,598
Was it the night he caught an
executive cheating with his secretary?

23
00:00:57,474 --> 00:01:01,895
or was it the day he saw a housewife
cheating with her delivery boy?

24
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,984
or was it the time he caught the girl next door

25
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:10,946
cheating with the couple
who lived across the street?

26
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:12,990
whenever the moment,

27
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,410
oliver weston was now officially a cynic

28
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:20,581
who only believed in betrayal and suspicion.

29
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:24,251
Luckily for oliver,
that's what paid his bills.

30
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:26,503
okay,you forgot fighting.

31
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:28,505
What are you doing?

32
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:32,843
Oh. Sorry,man.
Are these your bushes?

33
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:35,512
I'll clean that all up when I'm done.
It'll be like i was not here.

34
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:38,223
-You're done now.
-Whoa,easy,big fella.

35
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,559
I'm just a P.I. Doing a domestic surveillance job.

36
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:42,186
For who?

37
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:44,354
The blonde ly at the end of the street.

38
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:47,149
-Edie britt?
-Yeah. That's her fianc?

39
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:49,902
Apparently,he dumped her for another woman,

40
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:51,862
and I just figured out who.

41
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:53,238
San?

42
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:56,491
there's nothing going on there.
They used to be married.

43
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,452
She's only talking to him because
they have a kid together.

44
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,495
From what I heard,they're on their
way to kid number two.

45
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,039
Well,you don't know what you're talking about.

46
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:03,916
Yeah,and you don't know these
soccer moms like I do.

47
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:06,210
By day,they bake cookie and carpool.

48
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,172
But dim the lights and bam--
they turn into total pigs.

49
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:13,592
-she's not like that.
-Oh,please. Look at her.

50
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:17,304
That woman clearly knows her
way around a mattress.

51
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:24,561
Yes,oliver weston had become a cynic,

52
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:30,108
which is why he cldn't recognize
a man who was still in love.

53
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:35,447
proudly presents
Desperate Housewives

54
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:42,120
Every family has a way of hiding
what it doesn't want seen...

55
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:47,376
whether it's with a picture
that covers a stain on the wall...

56
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:53,382
orith a closet door that
conceals the chaos inside...

57
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:59,888
or with artificial smiles that
mask years of pain and heartache,

58
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:05,519
every family goes to great
lengths to hide ugly truths.

59
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:09,773
Some,of course,
go further than others.

60
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:19,449
So are you gonna do this tonight?

61
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:22,744
No,the ice cream is for tomorrow.

62
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,999
I'm taking caleb on a picnic to rockwater lake.

63
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:29,668
I'm preparing all of his favorite foods.

64
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:32,462
So when you're done,
you're just gonna...

65
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,299
leave him lying there?

66
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:38,969
No.

67
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,433
I'll call 9-1-1 anonymously,

68
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:48,478
but I will be watching
from a distance to make sure

69
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:52,107
that... that they pick up his body.

70
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:56,361
You know,mom,
you don't have to do this.

71
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,280
I won't let him hurt another girl,

72
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,869
and I will not turn him over to people
who will mock and abuse him.I just won'T.

73
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:14,505
His last day on this earth
is going to be a perfect one.

74
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:22,471
oh,no,thanks,xiao-mei.

75
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,891
The poor thing.
She was so attached to lily.

76
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:27,434
Where'd all this food come from?

77
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,895
The people from carlos' church.

78
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:32,648
So you think you and carlos will
try for another adoption?

79
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:35,275
I don't think I could go through that pain again.

80
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:39,696
I did freeze some of my eggs,so we might
do the surrogacy thing,but I don't know.

81
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,698
Honey,you've got to eat something.

82
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,450
I don't have an appetite.

83
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,161
In fact,this is all gonna go to waste.
You guys should take something.

84
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:49,206
-No,no,you should keep it.
-I'll take a couple.

85
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,627
What?

86
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:57,548
Karl dumped me,so I'm alone.
Food fills the void.

87
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:05,013
xiao-mei,I appreciate your grief,but,really,you're
bringing everybody down.Will you pull it together?

88
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,099
Mrs. Solis...

89
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,146
I don't understand.
It's from the government.

90
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,523
Let me see.

91
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,609
Gaby,
she's being deported.

92
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:20,612
Xiao-mei,is this the first
letter like this you've received?

93
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:29,454
oh,my...
this can't be happening.

94
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,623
I can't go home!

95
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:33,709
My unclewill sell me again.

96
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,295
Oh,no,no,xiao-mei,
you're not going anywhere.

97
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:38,338
Hey,you're much too iortant
to carlos and me.

98
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,507
We're gonna fight this and we're gonna win.

99
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,926
Gaby,you can't promise her that.

100
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:48,265
Bree,you heard what she said.I can't let this
poor kid go back to china and become someone's slave.

101
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:50,392
Thank you.

102
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,479
All right.
Look,my friends wanna take some of this to go,

103
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,441
so pack it up,and we're a little low on coffee.

104
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:06,491
you're actually gonna let me eat this?

105
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:10,287
Well,you've been working so hard,
off on business trips all the time.

106
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:14,291
Tonight,we throw caution
and cholesterol to the wind.

107
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,919
you deserve a little comfort food.

108
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,172
Oh,no,you're pregnant.

109
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:23,425
God,your mind goes to dark places.

110
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:27,012
Honey,you just served me
a plate of full-fat gouda.

111
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:28,472
What's up?

112
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:30,891
Okay,well...

113
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:35,354
remember I was helping ed
spark up his love life?

114
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:37,731
Yeah,you sent his wife those sexy I.M.S. Why?

115
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:42,736
Well,fran found out that ed didn't send them,
and she blew her top.

116
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,531
She wants the responsible party fired,

117
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:48,492
and ed lied and told her...

118
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:51,411
that you sent them.

119
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,330
But--but it wasn't me.
It was you.

120
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,748
I know.

121
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,292
Oh,oh,but ed couldn't possibly lose you.

122
00:06:57,292 --> 00:07:00,045
No,no,no,
I'm the expendable one.

123
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:04,091
Look,I know it's ridiculous,
but ed is not a rational person.

124
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:09,263
Fran has him whipped,and a whipped husband
is someone we must take very seriously.

125
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,683
Okay.

126
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:16,895
-How do we handle this?
-You're under contract.

127
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:19,898
Ed can't fire you unless he has just cause.

128
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:23,610
So until this blows over,
you have to be a model employee.

129
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,613
Show up on time,
no more 3-martini lunches,

130
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:29,992
d above all,
have ready all your presentations.

131
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:32,828
I can't believe i'm being victimized like this.

132
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:34,872
Well,honey,
in all fairness...

133
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:37,916
those are all things you should be doing anyway.

134
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,085
Fine!

135
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:53,390
Andrew,I am having peter
over for dinner tomorrow night,

136
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,476
and I was wondering
if you would like to invite justin?

137
00:07:56,894 --> 00:08:00,105
Yeah. Um,thanks.
I'll--I'll call him tonight.

138
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:03,650
Since you two are having your boyfriends over,
can I invite matthew?

139
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,236
-Out of the question.
-So let me get this straight--

140
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:11,200
you can date a lush,and he can bring over his
gay lover,but god forbid i date a hot black guy.

141
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,369
Until they lock caleb up,
I don't want you anywhere near that family.

142
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:18,999
His brother tried to rape you,and his mother
keeps the guy locked up in a basement.

143
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:22,169
I mean,let's face it,danielle,
even you could do better.

144
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,630
Since when do you take mom's side over mine?

145
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:28,091
Your brother and I had a talk,
and we've come to a détente of sorts.

146
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:31,136
Really? Even after she screwed
you out of your trust fund?

147
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:34,306
Well,he did falsely accuse me of child abuse.

148
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:36,975
I would say we're even.
Wouldn't you,andrew?

149
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:39,645
Sure,mom. We're even.

150
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:46,944
you can stop smiling now.
I know your face is tired.

151
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:49,321
-What?
-I'm not stupid.

152
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:51,406
I know you hate her now as much as ever.

153
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:54,743
Mom and I are in a good place right now.
Why can't you believe that?

154
00:08:57,788 --> 00:09:00,541
Hi. I got your message.
What's up?

155
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,292
Come on in.

156
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:05,420
This is oliver weston.

157
00:09:05,838 --> 00:09:07,840
He's a P.I. Edie hired.

158
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,217
Edie hired A... P.I.?

159
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:12,636
Yeah. He's been spying on you and karl.

160
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:13,929
How you doing?

161
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:15,681
He thinks you two
have been having an affair.

162
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:17,558
Me and karl?

163
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:20,519
Why would you think that?

164
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:24,648
come on,suze. You know we're
meant to be together.

165
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:26,775
karl,just stop.

166
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:31,864
Well...
that is karl being nostalgic.

167
00:09:31,864 --> 00:09:36,159
you said yourself,
the sex last week was the best you ever had.

168
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:39,204
okay,um...

169
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:43,292
first of all,
it was not the best sex I ever had.

170
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:45,377
I just said that to make him feel better.

171
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:48,046
obviously,you were the best sex I ever had.

172
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:50,215
That explains the punch in the face.

173
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:53,343
-I'm gonna hit you again if you don't shut up.
-I know that this looks bad--

174
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:56,471
you were actually
fooling around with karl behind edie's back.

175
00:09:56,471 --> 00:10:00,434
No,no,no!No,karl lied to me.
He told me that he and edie had split up before--

176
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:02,144
you know what?
I don't even care.

177
00:10:02,144 --> 00:10:03,729
-Mike...
-are we done here?

178
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:05,814
yeah.

179
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,734
Good night,susan.

180
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:13,405
hey! Hey,you,
wait,wait,wait. Um...

181
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,950
okay,you cannot tell edie about this.

182
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,077
Whatever she's paying you,
I'll pay you double.

183
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:21,622
She paid a 2-grand retainer plus expenses.

184
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:23,415
$2,000?

185
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:26,502
Jeez! I gotta get into real estate.

186
00:10:26,502 --> 00:10:29,171
Okay,I don't have that kind of cash.

187
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:32,216
Well,then,I guess i take the tape to miss britt.

188
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:37,304
I have a copy!

189
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,648
okay,
let's try this another way.

190
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:51,401
You are about to unleash a nuclear explosion.

191
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:54,488
Lives are going to be ruined.

192
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:58,200
I'll tell you what.I'll hold off
till monday to report to ms. Britt.

193
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,411
That'll give you some time to
scrape together a little cash.

194
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,455
What if I can't?

195
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:20,013
I'm sorry,but xiao-mei missed
all of her appeal deadlines.

196
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:23,267
So tt's it? You're just gonna
send her back to china?

197
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:25,018
My hands are tied.

198
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,729
If your maid were married to
an american citizen,

199
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:30,899
or had a child who was an american citizen,

200
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,110
or if she were a well-known entertainer...

201
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:37,990
what if she was pregnant
with an american citizen?

202
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,705
Uh,xiao-mei?

203
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:48,333
we spoke to homeland security,

204
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,918
and we have good news!

205
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:51,795
I can stay?

206
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:53,922
Oh! thank you!

207
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:55,716
-Oh! Okay.
-Thank you!

208
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,511
Uh... well,
there's just one little thing...

209
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:03,182
the immigration laws have gotten
really tough in this country,

210
00:12:03,182 --> 00:12:05,517
so we're a little behind
the eight ball going in.

211
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:08,979
But we pled your case,
and we fought tooth and nail,

212
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:11,732
and the law says you can stay...

213
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:14,234
but only if you have our baby.

214
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,861
what?

215
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:21,074
The agent said that if you were...
pregnant with an american citizen,

216
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,160
then they couldn't deport you.

217
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,998
So we thought,you need a baby in your belly,
we need a surrogate...

218
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:30,584
win-win-win.

219
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,587
"sur-ro-gate"?

220
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:36,298
Oh,well,
it would be our baby.

221
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:39,718
It would just be growing inside of you.

222
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:41,637
I...

223
00:12:41,637 --> 00:12:43,972
okay,uh... well...

224
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,016
Okay,it's like this...

225
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:49,603
the three of us are making
your famous szechuan dumplings,

226
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:52,272
and I'm the dough,

227
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:55,317
and carlos is the pork,

228
00:12:55,317 --> 00:12:57,861
and you're the oven.

229
00:13:01,365 --> 00:13:03,617
-I have baby?!
-Okay,we take care of everything.

230
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:08,705
You know,uh,hospital bills
and maternity clothes and lamaze classes.

231
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:11,375
And,of course,you wouldn't have to do any work.

232
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:15,546
well,uh,maybe just a little light dusting.
Nothing major.

233
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,258
-No!
-No,xiao-mei,you don't have a choice.

234
00:13:19,258 --> 00:13:21,802
It's either this or go back to china.

235
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:24,429
No to baby!
No!

236
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:33,063
had to push the dusting,
didn't you?

237
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:37,860
peter,I don't think i'm
being unreasonable here.

238
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,946
It's not like I'gonna advertise
my addiction history,

239
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:44,616
but if your kids ask a direct question,
I'm not gonna lie to them.

240
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:48,954
Right! Uh-huh. Good point.

241
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:53,917
listen,I don't expect
you to lie about the alcoholism.

242
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:57,421
I mean,they know that's how we met.
It's just...you know,the other thing.

243
00:13:57,421 --> 00:14:00,174
Oh! The other thing.

244
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:04,011
They're just getting to know you,and so I
want them to focus on your good qualities.

245
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:08,473
I just don't know how they'll react
if they find out that you're a sex addict.

246
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,979
What are you so happy about?

247
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:17,816
You know how you were mad at mom
about not letting matthew come to dinner?

248
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:19,193
Yeah?

249
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:22,988
I just figured out the funniest
way for you to get back at her.

250
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:26,950
Okay,what's on the schedule for today?

251
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,536
I have got the boston
toy presentation ready to go.

252
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:33,707
Actually,I don't have time for a full pitch,
so just give me the gist.

253
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:39,505
-Excuse me?
-You know,boil it down.Give me one line.

254
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:45,260
Okay,basically,
it's "toys are fun."

255
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,220
I hate it.

256
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,805
How can you hate it?
I only gave you three words.

257
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:53,018
It's three words I hate.Okay,
I'm gonna take over the ston toy company account.

258
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:55,062
-No,you cannot take over--
-in the meantime,

259
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:57,189
you should all be aware i don't like the way

260
00:14:57,189 --> 00:15:00,108
you people have been filing
your expense reports.

261
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:04,112
There's been a lot of padding meanwhile,
this company is hemorrhaging money.

262
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:06,406
I'm gonna put a stop to it,

263
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:09,326
so I have hired a forensic accountant.

264
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:11,537
He's gonna go through them,
make sure everything's kosher.

265
00:15:11,537 --> 00:15:15,249
And I find one receipt,
one bar tab that's fishy,

266
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:18,669
it's grounds for dismissal.

267
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:21,213
Oh,scavo?

268
00:15:21,213 --> 00:15:23,423
He's gonna start with you.

269
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:28,178
I can't believe that son of
a bitch hired a forensic accountant.

270
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:30,430
He's more whipped than I thought.

271
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,642
Well,he's tragically underestimated us.
The gloves are coming off.

272
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:35,978
You know,
maybe I should just quit.

273
00:15:35,978 --> 00:15:39,356
What? Yesterday you were up in arms.
Now you're ready to cave?

274
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:42,901
If ed is determined to get me,sooner or later,
he's gonna get me.It's just a matter of time.

275
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:45,654
No,no!
We are not backing down.

276
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:47,364
I'm gonna walk over to ed's office right now,

277
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:50,576
and I'm gonna make very clear that
if you're out the door,I'm right behind ya.

278
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:52,619
We can't both be unemployed.

279
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:56,790
Oh,it'll never happen.He knows this place
will go down like a house of cards without me.

280
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:00,085
-Honey,wait. Just wait!
-What,what?

281
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:03,422
I'm not gonna hide behind my wife's skirt.

282
00:16:03,422 --> 00:16:05,632
We're a team.
I'm just lending support.

283
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:08,177
That's not the way it's gonna
look to everybody else out there.

284
00:16:08,177 --> 00:16:12,055
Look,let me talk to him,
man to man.

285
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:15,434
If my way doesn't work,
then we'll do it your way.

286
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,354
Okay,go get him.

287
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:50,677
oh,my god!
Oh,my god!

288
00:16:50,928 --> 00:16:52,888
Tom,what happened?

289
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:55,933
I think i gave him just cause.

290
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:08,862
Susan knew she couldn't afford to keep the P.I.

291
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:11,740
From revealing her affair with karl,

292
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:15,202
and since edie would learn the truth anyway,

293
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:19,122
susan felt it would be better
if it came from her...

294
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:24,753
which is how she came to write
a letter begging edie for forgiveness.

295
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:29,591
Her words were so sincere and heartfelt,
from the moment she mailed it,

296
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:31,426
susan knew...

297
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:35,347
she was a dead woman.

298
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,396
You know,caleb...

299
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:45,774
since the day you were born,

300
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:49,027
I've always thought of you as a blessing.

301
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:52,072
You do know that,right?

302
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:55,242
I guess.

303
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:00,330
How come matty's not here?

304
00:18:00,873 --> 00:18:03,667
Because this is our special day,

305
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:06,211
just you and me.

306
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:10,090
Is he mad at me?
'Cause of danielle?

307
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:14,261
No. He knows that you didn't
mean to scare her.

308
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:17,222
'Cause he said it was okay for
me to kiss her.

309
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:20,601
What did you say?

310
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:25,272
He said danielle liked me and that
she wouldn't fight me if I gave her a kiss.

311
00:18:26,315 --> 00:18:28,859
Ur brother told you that?

312
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:33,739
Matty said that she was waiting for me
and that she wanted a really big kiss.

313
00:18:38,327 --> 00:18:41,413
What else did your brother tell you?

314
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:45,751
Xiao-mei?

315
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:50,547
I made you some hot cocoa.

316
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:55,844
I guess the baby thing didn't
really appeal to you,huh?

317
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:01,099
I know it's a lot to ask,it's just,
carlos and i think of you as family.

318
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,852
Don't you think of us as family?

319
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:05,896
Oh,yes!

320
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:09,483
You are like mother to me.

321
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:15,989
Well,if we are so friggin' close,
what's the big deal?

322
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:18,200
It's nine months out of your life.

323
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,744
I will be ruined.

324
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:22,871
"Ruined"?

325
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:26,667
Down there.

326
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:30,128
Wait.

327
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:32,130
Are you a virgin?

328
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:38,262
If I have baby,
I will be shamed.

329
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:43,350
are you kidding?
No one cares about virginity in this country.

330
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:47,271
It went out of style in the '50s,and trust me,
honey,it ain't making a comeback.

331
00:19:49,273 --> 00:19:51,733
seriously,no one cares.

332
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:56,280
Husband would care.
No man want me if I ruined.

333
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,908
I want husband so much.

334
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:04,496
Well,what kind of husband do you want?

335
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:06,957
Do you want a rich husband?

336
00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:09,835
Well,then,rich men don't marry
virgins for the same reasons

337
00:20:09,835 --> 00:20:12,546
they don't hire chauffeurs who can't drive--

338
00:20:12,546 --> 00:20:15,257
they value experience.

339
00:20:15,257 --> 00:20:17,384
Really?

340
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:19,887
Would I lie to family?

341
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:26,268
Here are the numbers you wanted.

342
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:28,228
Lynette,wait.

343
00:20:28,729 --> 00:20:30,272
Have you heard from tom?

344
00:20:30,272 --> 00:20:33,317
He's not answering his cell phone.
But you don't have to worry,okay?

345
00:20:33,317 --> 00:20:35,694
You got what you wanted.
He's out of the building.

346
00:20:35,694 --> 00:20:38,447
Come in here and close the door.

347
00:20:38,447 --> 00:20:40,782
You sure?
I might punch you,too.

348
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:43,118
I'll take my chances.

349
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:47,831
If this is where you want
me to apologize for my husband,

350
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:49,500
I'm not gonna do it.

351
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,710
Maybe he shouldn't have hit you,
but you provoked him.

352
00:20:51,752 --> 00:20:53,670
-Now wait a minute--
-no! I'm sorry,

353
00:20:54,171 --> 00:20:57,716
tom gets punished beuse you can't
deal with your screwed-up marriage.

354
00:20:57,716 --> 00:20:59,551
It is pathetic,ed.

355
00:20:59,551 --> 00:21:02,554
If you had stood up to your wife
in the first place,none of this--what?

356
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:03,889
I love it.

357
00:21:03,889 --> 00:21:07,059
You're giving me crap about my marriage.

358
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:09,436
You know what? Here!

359
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:13,565
Oh,the forensic accountant found some
interesting stuff in tom's expense reports.

360
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:15,651
Yeah,it seems on his last three trips east,

361
00:21:15,651 --> 00:21:19,613
he cashed in his first-class ticket
and took a detour to atlantic city.

362
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:22,074
-What? That can't be right.
-Well,it's all there--

363
00:21:22,157 --> 00:21:24,701
hotels,bar tabs.

364
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:28,997
Oh,and on this page...
two tickets to a show.

365
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:33,544
And flowers.

366
00:21:36,547 --> 00:21:40,384
That doesn't make any sense.There's gotta
be some kind of an explanation for this.

367
00:21:40,843 --> 00:21:43,804
Before you pass judgment
on someone else's marriage,

368
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:47,432
I'd clean up my own house first.

369
00:21:53,105 --> 00:21:56,525
Sorry,I don't know what's taking
danielle so long to get dressed.

370
00:21:56,525 --> 00:21:59,903
Just give her a break,mom.I'm sure she's
just trying to look nice for ourompany.

371
00:21:59,903 --> 00:22:03,615
Well,I hope she doesn't get too dressed up.
I like people to be comfortable.

372
00:22:03,615 --> 00:22:06,285
Oh,I'm comfortable.

373
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:09,663
Honey,what are you wearing?

374
00:22:09,663 --> 00:22:11,999
You got me this for christmas.
Don't you remember?

375
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:14,585
Yes,I just--I'm worried you might
be a little cold.

376
00:22:14,585 --> 00:22:17,004
Ohi think it's plenty warm in here.

377
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:19,381
Don't you,mr. Mcmillan?

378
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:22,843
sure.

379
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:29,349
Well,uh,we should probably start eating.
We don't want our frittatas to get cold.

380
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:33,437
Right. Good. Um,sorry.
Everybody,dig in.

381
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:40,027
Does anybody else think this
salsa's a little too spicy?

382
00:22:41,195 --> 00:22:44,823
I always say,he hotter,the better."

383
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:51,830
So,mr. Mcmillan,
I hear you went to perkins college.

384
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:54,625
I'm thinking about
going there after I graduate.

385
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:57,211
Uh,perkins,huh?

386
00:22:57,211 --> 00:23:02,174
I was there.Yeah,I made it to every party,
and I went to classes in my spare time.

387
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:06,845
no,actually,it's a great college.
I think you'd like it.

388
00:23:07,513 --> 00:23:11,975
Isn't this wonderful?
Good food,pleasant conversation...

389
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:15,938
this really is a very special night.

390
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:20,359
I feel the same way.

391
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:26,907
So,peter,is it growing?

392
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,910
What?

393
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:33,831
Uh,the campus. Has it grown at
all since you've been there?

394
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:41,338
yeah,it's,uh...it's grown...
con-considerably.

395
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:44,883
I would just love to get
my hands on a brochure.

396
00:23:45,884 --> 00:23:49,888
The alumni association is always
sending me stuff,you know.

397
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:52,391
I'll--I'll get you something!

398
00:23:52,391 --> 00:23:55,644
Oh,my god,are you okay?

399
00:23:58,021 --> 00:24:02,609
I just remembered,you know,this guy I'm sponsoring--
he said he needed to see me tonight,so I should go to him.

400
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:04,236
Well,I gues
that's important,so--

401
00:24:04,236 --> 00:24:07,781
yeah,so ihould go.
No need to show me out.

402
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,916
what a shame.I really wanted him to
have a chance to get to know you guys.

403
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:21,837
Don't worry,I...
I think we made an impression.

404
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,679
Hey. Hey!

405
00:24:31,305 --> 00:24:34,141
I didn't know if you were coming back.

406
00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:37,060
I waited until the parking lot clead.

407
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,896
So,um...

408
00:24:40,689 --> 00:24:43,358
what happened?You said you were
just gonna go in there and talk to him.

409
00:24:43,358 --> 00:24:46,069
I know,I know.
I know I shouldn't have hit him.

410
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:49,156
but...
what's done is done.

411
00:24:51,492 --> 00:24:53,577
Anything else going on?

412
00:24:53,577 --> 00:24:56,038
-Like what?
-I don't know.

413
00:24:56,497 --> 00:24:58,749
Anything you wanna talk about?

414
00:24:58,749 --> 00:25:01,251
'Cause there's nothing you couldn't tell me.

415
00:25:01,251 --> 00:25:03,962
-I would understand.
-No,I feel good about this.

416
00:25:03,962 --> 00:25:08,091
It's okay,'cause I didn't fit in around here anyway.
I'm gonna get another job someplace else.

417
00:25:08,091 --> 00:25:10,135
Everything's good.

418
00:25:10,135 --> 00:25:12,679
And you,I love.

419
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:15,516
I love you,too.

420
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:20,229
You know what's weird?

421
00:25:20,229 --> 00:25:22,689
No,what?

422
00:25:22,689 --> 00:25:25,567
In all the years we have been married,

423
00:25:25,567 --> 00:25:30,155
I have never seen you lead with your fists.

424
00:25:30,906 --> 00:25:33,075
well...

425
00:25:33,075 --> 00:25:37,287
maybe I still got some surprises in me.

426
00:25:37,955 --> 00:25:40,874
Maybe you do.

427
00:25:45,629 --> 00:25:47,422
Is it done?

428
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:56,765
We can mourn your brotherater.Right now
there are things that still need to be done.

429
00:25:57,307 --> 00:25:59,810
We need to get rid of everything...

430
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:03,355
mattress,clothes,
all of it.

431
00:26:14,658 --> 00:26:16,910
mom,the--the door's locked.

432
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,829
I know.

433
00:26:19,997 --> 00:26:23,041
Mom,you need to open this door right now!

434
00:26:26,628 --> 00:26:28,964
mom!

435
00:26:48,775 --> 00:26:50,819
Honey,
why aren't you dressed yet?

436
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:53,822
We have to be at the fertility
clinic in 40 minutes!

437
00:26:53,822 --> 00:26:55,866
Aw,shoot! Is that today?

438
00:26:55,866 --> 00:26:59,661
And,uh,give xiao-mei a kick in the pants.
I haven't seen her all morning.

439
00:27:03,123 --> 00:27:04,875
hey.

440
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,669
Today's the,uh,big day.

441
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:11,215
You ready to,uh,make a baby?

442
00:27:13,258 --> 00:27:15,511
Ready.

443
00:27:26,522 --> 00:27:28,190
Please...

444
00:27:28,941 --> 00:27:31,318
be gentle.

445
00:27:37,282 --> 00:27:40,202
Honey,come on.
We're gonna be late.

446
00:27:45,749 --> 00:27:50,379
I think she's confused as to
how we're gonna make this baby happen.

447
00:27:51,463 --> 00:27:54,925
Oh. And were you planning on
setting her straight?

448
00:27:56,093 --> 00:27:58,679
Next thing out of my mouth.

449
00:28:01,974 --> 00:28:04,142
Come on!
The guy's ready to explode.

450
00:28:04,142 --> 00:28:06,436
I don't care. I'm not sleeping
with mom's boyfriend.

451
00:28:06,436 --> 00:28:08,647
You can't back out now.
You were great the other night.

452
00:28:08,647 --> 00:28:10,607
You got peter on the hook.
He's primed.

453
00:28:10,607 --> 00:28:13,110
I was just messing with his
head to get back at mom.That's all.

454
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:17,489
Yeah,but why stop there?She's keeping you
from matthew.Now,come on,she deserves this.

455
00:28:17,489 --> 00:28:20,576
I'm not that stupid.
Go grind your own ax.

456
00:28:20,993 --> 00:28:23,996
that's him.I don't have time for this crap.
Now strip down to your bra and panties now.

457
00:28:23,996 --> 00:28:26,874
Get out of my room,
you psycho!

458
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:33,505
Um,my mom won't be back for a while,
so you probably don't wanna wait around.

459
00:28:33,505 --> 00:28:37,009
Well,that's okay.I just wanted to make
sure you got the perkins catalog.

460
00:28:37,009 --> 00:28:40,387
Uh,your mom told me that you're
going on a tour there tomorrow.

461
00:28:40,387 --> 00:28:42,055
-Yeah.
-You're gonna love it.

462
00:28:42,055 --> 00:28:47,311
The campus is beautiful,the teachers are amazing,
and the student body is such a great mix.

463
00:28:47,311 --> 00:28:50,147
You know,
they're all about diversity.

464
00:28:50,147 --> 00:28:54,109
Whatever.All right,well,
I'll let my mom know you stopped by.

465
00:28:54,776 --> 00:28:56,653
Okay.

466
00:28:59,031 --> 00:29:04,077
Andrew...I also wanted to apologize
for leaving so fast the other night.

467
00:29:04,077 --> 00:29:06,205
I...

468
00:29:06,205 --> 00:29:10,292
I started to get the feeling that your sister
was coming on to me,which was upsetting because--

469
00:29:10,292 --> 00:29:12,753
you're a sex addict?

470
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:16,590
-Your mom told you about that?
-Let's just say the word's out.

471
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:20,010
But,m,I'm curious.

472
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:23,805
Back in the day,what kind of
stuff were you into?

473
00:29:25,098 --> 00:29:27,059
I don't know that i wanna talk about that.

474
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:29,937
Well,I just wanna make sure
you're not into anything too freaky.

475
00:29:29,937 --> 00:29:33,232
You know,I mean,you are dating my mom,
and I'm kinda protective of her.

476
00:29:33,232 --> 00:29:36,818
Well,you can relax.I mean,
I wasn't some sort of pervert,you know.

477
00:29:36,818 --> 00:29:42,282
All I can say is...I went through a dark period,
and I slept with a whole lot of people.

478
00:29:45,035 --> 00:29:46,745
People?

479
00:29:46,745 --> 00:29:48,413
What's wrong?

480
00:29:48,413 --> 00:29:54,294
No,it's just that when most guys
discuss their conquests,they don't say "people."

481
00:29:56,463 --> 00:29:58,757
-oh,well...
-no,it's okay.

482
00:30:00,384 --> 00:30:03,470
I appreciate the fact that you value...

483
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:06,181
diversity.

484
00:30:12,855 --> 00:30:15,023
-who is it?
-Mike.

485
00:30:19,152 --> 00:30:21,446
-Susan?
-Hi. Sorry.

486
00:30:21,572 --> 00:30:23,740
I'm just on the lookout for edie.

487
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:26,702
Oh,well,you can relax.
Edie won't be coming after you.

488
00:30:26,702 --> 00:30:27,494
Why?

489
00:30:27,494 --> 00:30:30,414
I talked to the P.I.,
And he's not gonna tell her anything.

490
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,750
-What did you say?
-I paid him off,

491
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:37,254
so it's over.
I just thought you should know.

492
00:30:37,254 --> 00:30:39,673
Well,wait.

493
00:30:39,673 --> 00:30:42,009
Why would you do that?

494
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:44,928
People will just get hurt if it gets out.

495
00:30:44,928 --> 00:30:47,848
I didn't see the point.

496
00:31:13,999 --> 00:31:15,959
come on,come on,come on.

497
00:31:20,088 --> 00:31:23,550
Hey there.
You look thirsty.

498
00:31:24,176 --> 00:31:26,512
This is really nice of you,
mrs. Mayer.

499
00:31:26,512 --> 00:31:29,431
To be honest with you,
I wasn't even sure that you liked me.

500
00:31:29,431 --> 00:31:33,477
And you know why? Because we're
all so busy and detached from each other.

501
00:31:33,477 --> 00:31:36,104
You're at my house every day,
and sure,

502
00:31:36,104 --> 00:31:40,025
we wave and we say hello,
but we barely even know each other.

503
00:31:40,025 --> 00:31:43,529
How long have you been delivering my mail,
for god's sake?

504
00:31:43,529 --> 00:31:45,948
Three and a half weeks.

505
00:31:45,948 --> 00:31:47,616
Really?

506
00:31:47,616 --> 00:31:50,619
It seems like forever.
let me top you off.

507
00:31:50,619 --> 00:31:53,455
Oh,no,I couldn'T.
This is my third glass. I...

508
00:31:53,455 --> 00:31:56,458
seriously,I'm sloshin'.

509
00:31:56,834 --> 00:31:59,419
well,you probably wanna
use the bathroom before you leave,huh?

510
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:01,755
-No,I'm good.
-Are you sure?

511
00:32:01,755 --> 00:32:06,134
Uh,I mean,you have such a long route,
and that ice tea's gonna go right through ya.

512
00:32:06,134 --> 00:32:10,055
It's better here than mrs. Mccluskey's hydrangeas.

513
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:13,475
Well,you know,uh...
maybe I will use your bathroom.

514
00:32:13,475 --> 00:32:18,313
Great! Oh,the one down here is broken.Why don't
you use the one upstairs?It's right off my bedroom.

515
00:32:20,232 --> 00:32:23,068
Yeah.
Okay.

516
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:26,655
Got it.

517
00:32:53,682 --> 00:32:55,809
I still can't believe it.

518
00:32:55,809 --> 00:32:59,021
I mean,why would xiao-mei
just offer herself up to me like that?

519
00:32:59,021 --> 00:33:03,108
well,honey,she's a virgin.
Who knows why virgins do anything?

520
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,402
She's a viin?

521
00:33:05,402 --> 00:33:07,237
Are you serious?

522
00:33:07,237 --> 00:33:11,200
Yeah. I wouldn't just slam her for no reason.

523
00:33:13,118 --> 00:33:15,996
Mr. Solis?
It's time to collect your N.A.

524
00:33:16,788 --> 00:33:20,125
Oh! Okay,honey,
only good swimmers now.

525
00:33:23,295 --> 00:33:27,341
if you like,we have a variety of
magazines and videos available.

526
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:33,597
I think I'm good.

527
00:33:40,854 --> 00:33:44,149
Gus? Are you okay up there?

528
00:33:49,655 --> 00:33:51,240
gus!

529
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,284
Uh,do you want me to keep the hat on?

530
00:33:54,284 --> 00:33:57,871
I know it's a fantasy for some women.

531
00:34:03,502 --> 00:34:05,379
mom?

532
00:34:08,131 --> 00:34:10,801
Is the mailman here?

533
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,930
That's my daughter.
Get dressed!

534
00:34:15,472 --> 00:34:17,224
mom?

535
00:34:17,224 --> 00:34:21,353
Yes,honey!Gus the mailman is here!
He's using the bathroom.

536
00:34:21,353 --> 00:34:23,981
He'll be down in a minute.

537
00:34:23,981 --> 00:34:28,902
Oh! darn it.
Guess we'll have to take a rain check,huh?

538
00:34:28,902 --> 00:34:31,446
I can come back on tuesday.

539
00:34:32,322 --> 00:34:36,493
tu-tuesday?No,no,tuesday's not good,
'cause tuesday's the day I,um...

540
00:34:37,578 --> 00:34:40,038
become a lesbian.

541
00:34:56,763 --> 00:34:58,682
andrew?

542
00:34:58,682 --> 00:35:02,853
Honey,where are you?I got your message.
What's the emergency?

543
00:35:03,604 --> 00:35:05,314
Andrew?

544
00:35:06,148 --> 00:35:08,025
Andrew?

545
00:35:09,109 --> 00:35:11,195
Andrew?

546
00:35:11,737 --> 00:35:14,573
Honey,what are you doing in my bed?

547
00:35:14,573 --> 00:35:17,451
Have you seen my pants?
I can't--

548
00:35:22,623 --> 00:35:24,750
now we're even.

549
00:35:31,757 --> 00:35:36,011
Did you forget that we're supposed
to take that tour of perkins college today?

550
00:35:37,054 --> 00:35:38,889
Seriously?

551
00:35:38,889 --> 00:35:44,144
After last night,I didn't exactly think you'd be too
keen on sitting next to me in a car for three hours.

552
00:35:44,144 --> 00:35:49,441
Consider me a cheerleader for anything that
expedites me getting you out from under my roof.

553
00:35:51,819 --> 00:35:54,780
Glad we can come to an understanding.

554
00:36:15,384 --> 00:36:18,220
Why'd we stop here?
We have half a tank left.

555
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:21,515
There's so many things
i wanna say to you,andrew.

556
00:36:22,474 --> 00:36:26,645
But mostly,I just want you
to know how sorry I am.

557
00:36:26,645 --> 00:36:29,022
Sorry for what?

558
00:36:29,022 --> 00:36:32,484
Every child deserves to be loved
unconditionally,

559
00:36:33,235 --> 00:36:36,738
and I thought that was the
kind of love that I had for you.

560
00:36:39,074 --> 00:36:42,244
Maybe if I had,
it would've been different.

561
00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:48,792
why do i suddenly get the feeling we're not
gonna make it out to perkins college today?

562
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,261
-What are you doing?
-I packed up some of your things.

563
00:36:59,261 --> 00:37:02,556
There's also,um,an envelope
in here with some money,

564
00:37:02,556 --> 00:37:06,059
and that should tide you
over until you get a job.

565
00:37:06,894 --> 00:37:10,230
What,you're gonna leave me out
here in the middle of nowhere?

566
00:37:11,481 --> 00:37:15,527
I noticed a bus stop about a mile back.

567
00:37:16,111 --> 00:37:18,447
You can go anywhere you want.

568
00:37:18,447 --> 00:37:21,533
Mama,mom,
please don't do this.

569
00:37:22,367 --> 00:37:24,703
I have to.

570
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:30,125
I can't be around you anymore.
I'm just not strong enough.

571
00:37:34,755 --> 00:37:37,549
You know what the good news is?

572
00:37:37,549 --> 00:37:39,468
I win.

573
00:37:40,886 --> 00:37:43,055
You win?

574
00:37:44,056 --> 00:37:47,392
I remember the look in your eyes
when I told you I was gay,

575
00:37:47,768 --> 00:37:51,980
and I knew that one day,
you would stop loving me.

576
00:37:55,192 --> 00:37:57,569
So here we are.

577
00:37:57,569 --> 00:38:01,990
I was righ and I... I win.

578
00:38:05,619 --> 00:38:08,330
Well,good for you.

579
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:01,425
Hi. I made you a thank-you pie,

580
00:39:01,425 --> 00:39:04,136
and by "made,"
I mean "bought."

581
00:39:43,467 --> 00:39:46,512
so what exactly are you thanking me for?

582
00:39:47,262 --> 00:39:50,390
For keeping edie from smashing my face in.

583
00:39:51,767 --> 00:39:54,394
That's the nicest thing anybody ever did for me.

584
00:39:54,394 --> 00:39:57,898
Just... trying to keep peace on the lane.

585
00:39:58,315 --> 00:40:00,526
Well,you keep telling yourself that.

586
00:40:00,526 --> 00:40:03,195
I know why you really paid that guy off.

587
00:40:04,655 --> 00:40:06,865
You still care about me.

588
00:40:07,366 --> 00:40:08,617
What?

589
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:13,288
you're always worried about julie and me,

590
00:40:13,288 --> 00:40:16,291
and you beat upnmy new boyfriend.

591
00:40:16,708 --> 00:40:19,545
and now you're protecting me from edie.

592
00:40:20,003 --> 00:40:22,589
Do you know what all that means?

593
00:40:23,173 --> 00:40:25,759
That you're high maintenance?

594
00:40:28,512 --> 00:40:31,849
all right,
you go ahead a be coy. Fine.

595
00:40:32,683 --> 00:40:35,435
I'll be the one to break the ice.

596
00:40:36,436 --> 00:40:39,565
I've never stopped caring about you.

597
00:40:40,899 --> 00:40:43,652
Is that why you jumped in bed with karl?

598
00:40:43,652 --> 00:40:48,657
I would've never even gone there if
I had thought there was a chance with us.

599
00:40:48,657 --> 00:40:52,578
You just closed the door so completely,I...

600
00:40:53,954 --> 00:40:56,623
ugh,can we just not talk about him?

601
00:40:57,749 --> 00:40:59,835
Have some more pie.

602
00:41:00,127 --> 00:41:02,880
I know you like pie.

603
00:41:04,506 --> 00:41:07,301
I know you like me.

604
00:41:09,344 --> 00:41:11,180
Listen...

605
00:41:12,181 --> 00:41:15,309
I'm not asking for us to get back together.

606
00:41:15,309 --> 00:41:18,687
I just want us to be friends.

607
00:41:19,188 --> 00:41:22,316
-Susan?
-Yes?

608
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:25,819
Your house is on fire.

609
00:41:30,532 --> 00:41:33,202
my whole house is... on fire!

610
00:41:33,202 --> 00:41:37,498
When the truth is ugly,
people try to keep it hidden,

611
00:41:37,498 --> 00:41:42,419
because they know if revealed,
the damage it will do.

612
00:41:43,545 --> 00:41:46,840
So they conceal it within sturdy walls...

613
00:41:48,091 --> 00:41:51,678
or they place it behind closed doors...

614
00:41:52,971 --> 00:41:56,683
or they obscure it with clever disguises...

615
00:41:57,893 --> 00:42:02,105
but truth,no matter how ugly,
always emerges...

616
00:42:08,695 --> 00:42:13,575
and someone we care about always ends up getting hurt...

617
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:24,002
and someone else will revel in their pain,

618
00:42:24,503 --> 00:42:28,090
and that's the ugliest truth of all.
