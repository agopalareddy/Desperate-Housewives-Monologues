00:00:02,878 --> 00:00:04,963
<i>Previously on "Desperate Housewives", ...</i>

3
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:06,882
She packed up the kids and the puppy and left.

4
00:00:06,882 --> 00:00:07,883
Packed them up? Why?

5
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:11,261
She followed you to Atlantic City.
She knows about your other woman.

6
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:12,679
<i>...things went from bad...</i>

7
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,181
Put your hands where I can see them.

8
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,558
<i>...to considerably worse.</i>

9
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:18,185
Man, she's good.

10
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:19,978
Looks like the insemination was successful.

11
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:21,188
Oh!
- Oh my god!

12
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:22,397
<i>And even the good news...</i>

13
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:24,566
She's the priority now!
She's the mother of my child!

14
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:25,859
<i>...came with a catch.</i>

15
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,694
Given any thought to staying at my place?

16
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,279
I think I'm gonna have to pass.

17
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,698
No, I'm stronger than people give me credit for.

18
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:35,160
<i>But sometimes,
once you accept the truth,</i>

19
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,162
<i>you discover that you're capable...</i>

20
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:38,163
Let's just get out of here!

21
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:39,289
<i>...of accomplishing...</i>

22
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,875
I'd like to admit myself for psychiatric observation.

23
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,795
I'm about to have a nervous breakdown.

24
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:48,882
<i>...almost anything.</i>

25
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,969
<i>It's a fact of life in every neighborhood:</i>

26
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:55,389
<i>People move in,
and people move out.</i>

27
00:00:55,389 --> 00:01:00,394
<i>Although very few of them
pack up and leave at 2am.</i>

28
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,772
<i>But it wasn't the first time</i>

29
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:07,693
<i>that Betty Applewhite had
tried to leave in the middle of the night.</i>

30
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:12,698
<i>It had happened once before,
in Chicago.</i>

31
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:18,370
<i>The same night one of her sons
tried to break up with his girlfriend,...</i>

32
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:23,375
<i>...a young woman named Melanie Foster.</i>

33
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:25,961
Are you kidding?
You cannot dump me!

34
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:27,087
I do not get dumped!

35
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,964
If anyone is getting dumped here, it's you.

36
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:30,757
However you want to spell it,
it's fine. OK?

37
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,886
I just want out.
I just want out!

38
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:35,679
OK. Matthew--

39
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:40,684
maybe I am a bitch sometimes,
but there are advantages to dating someone like me.

40
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:44,062
And I know that you know what I'm talking about.

41
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:49,067
Melanie, my mother is in the other room.
Are you crazy?

42
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,863
Clearly, we can't have a serious discussion here.

43
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:55,365
Why don't you meet me at the lumber yard at nine?

44
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,784
Melanie, it's over.

45
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,787
Well, even more reason for you to show up.

46
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:05,792
No one can say goodbye better than I do.

47
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:33,195
Oh, it's about time.

48
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:34,279
Caleb!

49
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,073
What are you doing here?
Where's Matthew?

50
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:39,576
I got here first.
I know a shortcut.

51
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,662
Does Matthew know that you're here?

52
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:44,873
No.

53
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:48,168
He--he doesn't want to be with you anymore.

54
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,670
What does that have to do with you?

55
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,965
See, I thought--

56
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:56,468
maybe I could be your boyfriend now.

57
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:59,471
What?

58
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:01,181
I love you.

59
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:05,394
Oh God, please tell me
someone put you up to this! No?

60
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:07,980
Could you be serious?

61
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,775
It's too pathetic!

62
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:16,572
What the hell are you doing?

63
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:21,577
Get off of me, you--

64
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:37,176
Melanie?

65
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:10,959
<i>Yes, a year had come and gone
since the Applewhites had left Chicago.</i>

66
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:16,798
<i>And Betty thought they could again
slip away in the middle of the night.</i>

67
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:20,969
Once we move,
how's Matthew goin' find us?

68
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:25,974
Caleb, I think this is going to be you and me from now on.

69
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,272
Up with your hands!
Put your hands up!

70
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,691
<i>But as she soon discovered,</i>

71
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:38,779
<i>it's not that easy
to slip away in the suburbs.</i>

72
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:43,784
<i>Because in Suburbia,
once the neighbors hear you going,</i>

73
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:48,372
<i>they all insist on showing up</i>

74
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:53,377
<i>to say goodbye.</i>

75
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:43,468
<i>Everyone must choose
the road they will take in life.</i>

76
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:48,473
<i>And for a special few,
that road would lead to Wisteria Lane.</i>

77
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:54,563
<i>They all arrive the exact same way:</i>

78
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:58,859
<i>driving up in their overloaded trucks,</i>

79
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:01,778
<i>bringing with them their expensive antiques</i>

80
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:06,783
<i>and ordinary dreams.</i>

81
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:11,788
<i>I remember the first moment I saw each of them.</i>

82
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:15,792
<i>I met Susan Mayer the day she moved to Wisteria Lane.</i>

83
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,879
Ah! OK, break time's over.

84
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,173
She seemed to delightfully confident,

85
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:26,178
I couldn't help but feel intimidated.

86
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:29,097
Oh! Oh! Oh!

87
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:32,392
That feeling quickly passed.

88
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,896
Help! Can anybody hear me?

89
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:39,483
Julie? I need you to try to unlock the door!

90
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:41,193
Oh, what am I thinking, she's too...

91
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:44,363
OK-- I need you to unbuckle yourself

92
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:47,366
and try to find a neighbor!

93
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:48,992
But don't cross the street!

94
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:53,664
Just tell the neighbor
that your Mommie's stuck in a big truck!

95
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:57,960
Oh, yes!
My God, I have a genius baby!

96
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,879
Hi.

97
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,298
I have a normal baby.

98
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,175
I'm Mary Alice.
I live across the street.

99
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:08,095
Susan Mayer. Thank you so much!

100
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:12,891
If my husband had had to rescue me,
I would have never heard the end of it.

101
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:13,141
He thinks I'm a total klutz.

102
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,227
Oh, please,
that's what neighbors are for.

103
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:18,647
Well,
welcome to Wisteria Lane.

104
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:20,649
When you're
finished unpacking,

105
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:23,151
why don't you come over
for a cup of coffee?

106
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:25,153
Oh, wow!

107
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:29,783
I have a neighbor who just
asked me over for coffee.

108
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:33,161
I'm sorry.
You must think I'm a lunatic.

109
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:36,999
Oh, no, no, I don't.
I think you're charming.

110
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:39,251
And your baby looks
like a genius to me.

111
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:41,420
Oh, she is.

112
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,006
And we're gonna be
so happy here.

113
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:47,217
Look at your new home.

114
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,640
You're not gonna walk me
into a wall, are you?

115
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:56,643
Of course not, but when
you see it for the first time,

116
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:59,229
I want you to get
the whole impact.

117
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:01,231
Ta-da!

118
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:04,902
Okay, now I know
it's a little more cramped

119
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:07,362
than we're used to, but we
can't stay at Bree's forever.

120
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:09,781
She's gonna be coming back
from that spa vacation soon.

121
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:12,075
Besides, it's gonna be fun.
Why are you doing this to me?

122
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:14,286
I get good grades.
I don't do drugs.

123
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:16,663
I've never come home
pregnant.

124
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:20,125
Honey, I am trying my hardest
to stand on my own two feet.

125
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,669
All right, I've got six
book proposals in the works.

126
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:26,048
I'm gonna try to supervise
the rebuilding of this house,

127
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:28,550
But you know, I can't do it
without your support.

128
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:32,262
And I want you
to be proud of me.

129
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:38,018
Fine.
Let's take a look inside.

130
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:40,479
Ohh! That's my girl.

131
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:43,899
So... is there anything
you should prepare me for?

132
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:46,318
No! No. it's all good.

133
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,028
Oh! But you should know

134
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,696
that your bed doubles

135
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,491
and the toilet's
in the shower.

136
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,495
Honey, look. I bought us
matching golf outfits

137
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:58,288
for our lessons tomorrow.

138
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,790
Yeah, about that--
I can't go.

139
00:08:59,832 --> 00:09:01,792
I gotta pick up trash
on the freeway.

140
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:03,252
I'm sorry?

141
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:04,628
I have to do
my community service.

142
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,630
It's part of my parole,
remember?

143
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,132
Oh, okay, well, I'll just
call the country club

144
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:11,093
and cancel our lessons.
No, no, no.

145
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,929
I can't, I paid already.
Might as well go without me.

146
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:16,807
I don't wanna go alone.
It was your idea in the first place.

147
00:09:16,849 --> 00:09:18,809
And I'd love to be there
with you, too,

148
00:09:18,851 --> 00:09:21,019
if I didn't have to scrape
slushies and condoms

149
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,021
off route 57.
Look, what's the big deal?

150
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,523
Just go take the stupid lesson.

151
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:27,192
Fine, if you feel that way about it.
- Hey, I'm sorry.

152
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,905
Oh, would you look
at this crap?

153
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:33,949
He has been doing that all day.

154
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,331
Ralph has a little crush.
So?

155
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:43,333
So can't I get a gardener

156
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,836
Who isn't trying to sleep
with someone in my house?

157
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:49,506
You pay 6 bucks an hour.
It's all about the perks, honey.

158
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:57,681
Susan,
have you talked to Lynette?

159
00:09:57,723 --> 00:10:00,392
Uh, no.
Have you tried her cell?

160
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:03,228
Yeah, she isn't picking up.
Do you know where she is?

161
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:05,564
Uh, no, I'm sorry.

162
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:08,358
Susan, I think you do.

163
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,195
I really don't, Tom.

164
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:12,696
Is everything okay?

165
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:14,448
Yeah. Yeah,
we just had a fight.

166
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,783
Listen, if you talk to her,

167
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:19,828
will you please ask her
to call me?

168
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:22,915
Thank you.

169
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:32,966
Hello?

170
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:35,636
He was just here.

171
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:37,596
I think you should call him.

172
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:42,601
I can't. I can't.
I'm sorry. I just can't.

173
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:44,311
Mom!
Yeah. Hang on.

174
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:47,105
I'll call you later.
Okay. Bye.

175
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,398
Yeah?

176
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,318
When is Daddy coming?
I wanna show him my dive.

177
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,613
He's not coming, sweetheart.

178
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:59,076
But you could show me.

179
00:11:08,627 --> 00:11:10,587
You have to talk to Noah.

180
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:13,131
But he creeps me out.
Who cares?

181
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,633
This is my life
we're talking about.

182
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:16,677
I need a big-time lawyer
in my corner,

183
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:19,179
and where else are we gonna
get that kind of money?

184
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:22,099
Noah's not gonna give me a dime
if he knows it's for you.

185
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,142
He hates your guts.
Tell him it's for you.

186
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,853
Tell him you want a car.

187
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:28,397
Tell him you're ready for him
to buy your love. Trust me.

188
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:30,607
Dying men are nothing
if not sentimental.

189
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:32,609
Why do you need so much,
anyway?

190
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:36,113
I thought only guilty men
needed expensive lawyers.

191
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:38,699
Felicia has obviously been
planning this for months.

192
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,827
Who knows what other kind
of evidence she's planted?

193
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:44,621
with my luck, they'll open up
the Martha Huber murder again,

194
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:46,623
try to nail me
with some DNA.

195
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:51,378
You swore to me that you had
nothing to do with that.

196
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:53,422
I didn't.

197
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,883
Look, why are we arguing?

198
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:59,344
I'm your father.
Do what I'm telling you to do.

199
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:03,223
You're not my real father.

200
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:06,560
You ungrateful little...

201
00:12:06,602 --> 00:12:08,896
I rescue you
from that miserable junkie.

202
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:10,898
I give you a home,
a life worth living,

203
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:18,405
I need the money, Zach.

204
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:20,407
If you won't do it for me,

205
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:22,618
at least do it
for your mother.

206
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:27,956
After all, she killed herself
trying to protect you.

207
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:44,973
<i>I met Bree Van De Kamp</i></i>

208
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:47,476
<i>the first day she moved</i>
<i>to Wisteria Lane.</i></i>

209
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:49,937
<i>there are certain people,</i>
<i>who, when you meet them,</i></i>

210
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:53,398
<i>can't help but make</i>
<i>a delightful first impression.</i></i>

211
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,984
Hello. I'm Bree Van De Kamp,
your new neighbor.

212
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:57,486
Is this your frog?

213
00:12:57,528 --> 00:12:59,863
<i>Bree was not one of them.</i></i>

214
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:01,198
Yes. Why?

215
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,536
Well, it seems that my son
stole it from your yard.

216
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:07,246
Oh, well, I don't mind.

217
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,790
If he likes it so much,
he's welcome to keep it.

218
00:13:09,832 --> 00:13:11,792
Well, don't tell him that.

219
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:14,294
If he doesn't feel guilty,
he'll never learn shame.

220
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:16,255
Hey, what's going on?

221
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,841
Oh. Um, this I
our new neighbor.

222
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:21,343
It seems her son accidentally
took my garden frog.

223
00:13:21,385 --> 00:13:22,970
Oh.

224
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,972
Please don't make excuses
for him.

225
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:27,808
That is exactly what
his father does. Rex!

226
00:13:32,271 --> 00:13:34,064
This is my husband Rex.

227
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:37,067
Hi. We're not weird.
We just seem like we are.

228
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:40,612
And this is my son...

229
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:41,822
the criminal.

230
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:44,491
Go on.

231
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:47,828
I'm sorry I stole from you.

232
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:51,415
Just so you know, my Mom
did teach me right from wrong,

233
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:53,333
so my actions should in no way

234
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:56,670
influence your opinion
of her as a parent.

235
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:02,843
Wow.
Well, is there anything
you'd like to say to my son?

236
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:04,928
Feel free to be harsh.

237
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:09,850
No, I'm... I'm good.

238
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:12,728
Well, now that we've finished
with all this unpleasantness,

239
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,730
I want to assure you

240
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,732
that we are going to be
good neighbors,

241
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:19,651
and I hope in time,
great friends.

242
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:22,154
That sounds... lovely.

243
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:24,990
Come on.

244
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:26,992
Oh, wait.
I'm--I'm sorry.

245
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:30,412
It was Rex, Andrew and...
what was your name again?

246
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:33,832
Bree?

247
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:34,917
What?

248
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,919
You're Bree Van De Kamp,
right?

249
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,420
Do I know you?

250
00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:41,924
Orson Hodge.
Uh, Susan's dentist friend.

251
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:43,926
We met after her house
burned down.

252
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:47,054
Oh. I'm so sorry.
I didn't recognize you.

253
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:49,056
Small word, huh?

254
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:52,059
Yes. Uh, excruciatingly so.

255
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:53,185
Ah.

256
00:14:53,227 --> 00:14:55,521
What are you doing here?

257
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:59,024
Well, three or four times
a week, I visit my--my friend.

258
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,860
What about you?

259
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,863
Oh, I just thought id be
a lovely place

260
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,865
to take a nice, long rest.

261
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:08,492
Ah.

262
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:09,785
Um, listen,

263
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:12,913
I told my friends that
I was, um, I was at a spa,

264
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:15,666
so if you run into Susan,
I--
your secret is safe.

265
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:16,875
And seriously...

266
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:19,670
I am not
like these other people.

267
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:22,339
Oh, I can tell.

268
00:15:22,381 --> 00:15:24,383
A real lady always
stands out in a crowd.

269
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:27,761
Well, that was...
very sweet.

270
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:31,723
Enjoy your rest,
Bree Van De Kamp.

271
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:41,149
Boy, do I feel for you.

272
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:44,069
Trying to convince your friends
that you're still normal,

273
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:46,071
and you're surrounded
by a bunch of loons.

274
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:47,656
You, too?

275
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:49,575
Oh, please.

276
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:52,536
Dr. Barr goes out of his way
to make me feel

277
00:15:52,578 --> 00:15:54,037
like a complete psychopath.

278
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,957
I think he's crazier
than the patients, actually.

279
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,629
You know that, um,
that woman in the wheelchair?

280
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:05,424
What's her story?
Yeah, she's a kooky one.

281
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,426
She hasn't spoken a word
since she got here.

282
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:08,927
She just sits there
all day long

283
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:11,138
waiting for your friend
to come and visit.

284
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,098
He talks to her for hours,

285
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,851
but I don't even think
she can hear him.

286
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:27,321
Oh, hi.

287
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:30,532
You said to stop by
for coffee sometime.

288
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:33,619
I got coffee.

289
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,788
So I can't believe
you caught me spraying for ants.

290
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:38,790
I must look like a wreck.

291
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,792
Actually,
you look kinda sexy.

292
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,294
You've gotta be kidding.

293
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:44,880
Oh, the way you're taking
charge--it's impressive.

294
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:47,257
They're just ants,
and they're tiny.

295
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:49,259
Of course,
they do outnumber me.

296
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:51,762
Oh, you said you wanted
to handle things yourself,

297
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:54,264
and you're making it happen.
It's good to see.

298
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:56,725
Thanks.

299
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:58,727
Even if it does mean

300
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:01,480
you're not in the market
for a relationship right now.

301
00:17:01,522 --> 00:17:04,191
Oh. Did I say that?

302
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:06,818
You certainly implied it.

303
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:10,322
Well, sometimes I say things
I don't mean.

304
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:14,952
I blame it on my frequent
exposure to ant spray.

305
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:17,329
What the hell is this?

306
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:20,249
Karl. What do you want?

307
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,376
Well, I can't believe
you're forcing our daughter

308
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:24,378
to live in a house
with wheels.

309
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:26,380
I think we need
to talk about this.

310
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:27,464
It's temporary,

311
00:17:27,506 --> 00:17:29,967
and if you don't mind,
I'm having coffee.

312
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:31,927
Oh, it's okay, Susan.

313
00:17:31,927 --> 00:17:35,180
Hey, sorry. I don't mean
to chase you out, buddy,

314
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:37,599
but, uh, this is really
a family thing.

315
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:39,643
Oh, no, I understand.

316
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:40,936
Cool.

317
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:44,940
Mmm.

318
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:51,113
I'll call you later.

319
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:00,205
You've got a great swing.

320
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:02,708
You just need a little help
around the greens.

321
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,710
You know what they say--

322
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:07,212
drive for show,
putt for dough. Am I right?

323
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:09,214
That is so true.

324
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:11,216
All right.
I'll see you out there.
Okay.

325
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:13,468
Make me something strong.

326
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:15,846
I have nine more holes
with that guy.

327
00:18:15,888 --> 00:18:19,016
<i>Jim, it was just an hour ago</i>
<i>that the road crew</i></i>

328
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:20,851
<i>working here on route 57</i></i>

329
00:18:20,893 --> 00:18:23,979
<i>saw a member of their own</i>
<i>killed by oncoming traffic.</i></i>

330
00:18:24,021 --> 00:18:26,982
<i>the victim was a Hispanic male</i>
<i>in his early 40s</i></i>

331
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:29,985
<i>who, for years, was a prominent</i>
<i>businessman in the area.</i></i>

332
00:18:30,027 --> 00:18:31,987
<i>police aren't releasing a name</i></i>

333
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:34,239

334
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:36,241
<i>we, of course,</i>
<i>will keep you updated...</i>
</i>

335
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:38,243
<i>on any late-breaking</i>
<i>developments</i></i>

336
00:18:38,285 --> 00:18:39,745

</i>

337
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:42,247
<i>reporting live from route 57,</i>
<i>this is Craig Siyumina.</i></i>

338
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:44,666
<i>back to you.</i></i>

339
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:57,596
Mrs. Solis!
Why you home?

340
00:18:57,638 --> 00:19:01,767
Carlos is dead, Xiao-mei.

341
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:03,852
No, please don't kill him.

342
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:06,730
No, you don't understand.
He's already dead.

343
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,440
There was an accident.

344
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:11,568
He's all over the highway.

345
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:13,737
No...

346
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:15,781
he in kitchen.

347
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:27,042
Hey, babe.
Why you home so early?

348
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:30,212
Oh, honey!
Oh, you're not dead!

349
00:19:30,254 --> 00:19:32,256
Who said I was dead?

350
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:35,717
The police. They called me.
- What are you talking about?

351
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:37,719
Honey, they didn't know
all the details,

352
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:39,721
but a witness said
that they saw you

353
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:42,724
run into the carpool lane
to pick up a lawn chair

354
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:44,226
that had fallen
off some truck,

355
00:19:44,268 --> 00:19:46,979
and then a bus hit you
right in front of the road crew.

356
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:50,941
Why aren't you at the road crew?
- I paid Ralph to go in my place.

357
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:52,401
What?

358
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:55,487
Well, Carlos,
they had your name.

359
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:58,365
Oh, no. poor Ralph.

360
00:19:58,365 --> 00:20:00,075
Oh!

361
00:20:00,117 --> 00:20:02,035
Why is your back
all sweaty?

362
00:20:02,077 --> 00:20:04,288
I was working out
on the treadmill.

363
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:06,206
Barefoot?

364
00:20:06,248 --> 00:20:08,709
For God sakes,
Gabrielle, Ralph just died,

365
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,711
and you're worried
about my feet?

366
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:14,590
I mean, what the hell
is wrong with you?

367
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:17,426
My fault.
Sorry.

368
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:32,900
You must find that
very peaceful.

369
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:35,235
Why would you assume that?

370
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:38,238
Because that's all you've been
doing for three sessions.

371
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,324
I still don't know
anything about you,

372
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:42,910
except that you rake
in remarkably straight lines.

373
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:44,369
Is that what you're doing,

374
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:46,330
asking me all those
ridiculous questions

375
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:48,832
about my childhood,
trying to get to know me?

376
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:50,792
Well, here's a clue.
I'm not crazy.

377
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:54,296
I just have a few issues.
- And psychotherapy is how we
help you deal with those issues.

378
00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:59,134
What kind of treatment did you
think you were going to get?
- Honestly, I was hoping

379
00:20:59,134 --> 00:21:00,844
that you'd medicate
the hell out of me.

380
00:21:00,886 --> 00:21:02,513
You don't need
anything stronger

381
00:21:02,513 --> 00:21:03,847
than what I've already
prescribed for you.

382
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:06,892
I have aspirin at home
that packs more of a punch.

383
00:21:06,934 --> 00:21:08,685
It says here
your husband died,

384
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:11,104
you had a boyfriend
who killed himself,

385
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:14,149
and you suffer
from alcoholism.

386
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:17,861
That's a lot of trauma
for one year.

387
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:21,782
What about your kids?

388
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:25,118
Oh, they're fine.

389
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,538
Andrew is backpacking
through Europe,

390
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:30,833
and Danielle is away
at cheerleading camp.

391
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:32,668
What's your relationship
with them like?

392
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,380
What do you mean?

393
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,881
Are you close?

394
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:40,676
Do they share things
with you?

395
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:42,761
What do you feel
about them?

396
00:21:45,264 --> 00:21:48,267
You know, I really don't
have time for this nonsense.

397
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:51,270
Are you going to give me
some serious drugs or not?

398
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:53,480
No.

399
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,315
Fine. Then I'm going back
to my room.

400
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:57,860
You know, Bree, I can't
force you to open up to me,

401
00:21:57,901 --> 00:22:01,488
but I can make it easier for
you to focus on your problems.

402
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:03,323
And how are you
going to do that?

403
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:05,409
I'm going
to tell the orderlies

404
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:07,411
to confiscate
all your personal items.

405
00:22:07,452 --> 00:22:09,580
I committed myself
voluntarily.

406
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,582
When you signed
those pars,

407
00:22:11,582 --> 00:22:13,750
I became responsible
for your well-being,

408
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:17,754
and I will help you
in any way I see fit.
- I don't need that much help,

409
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:20,257
because I am not like
your other patients.
- Oh, sure, you are.

410
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:22,509
You just don't know it yet.

411
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:38,066
Your son confessed to murder.
We've got it on tape.

412
00:22:38,108 --> 00:22:41,028
My son has the mind
of a child, detective.

413
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:43,197
He'd confess to sinking
the Titanic.

414
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:47,826
This letter was sent
some months ago

415
00:22:47,868 --> 00:22:51,163
to the Chicago police,
saying the person they arrested

416
00:22:51,205 --> 00:22:53,248
for the Melanie Foster murder
was innocent.

417
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:54,666
We have a hunch
you wrote it.

418
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:57,711
Really? I didn't know hunches
were considered evidence

419
00:22:57,753 --> 00:22:59,379
in a court of law.

420
00:22:59,421 --> 00:23:01,465
They aren't.

421
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,304
But this is.

422
00:23:07,346 --> 00:23:09,806
We found some of
the assailant's DNA.

423
00:23:09,848 --> 00:23:11,642
On this jacket.

424
00:23:11,683 --> 00:23:15,604
Now all we need
is a matching sample.

425
00:23:15,646 --> 00:23:18,815
You, by any chance,
recognize the jacket?

426
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:22,778
It's not Caleb's.

427
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:27,449
You can try and deny it,
but...

428
00:23:27,449 --> 00:23:29,785
No.

429
00:23:29,785 --> 00:23:31,620
You don't understand.

430
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:37,292
That jacket belongs
to my other son.

431
00:24:01,984 --> 00:24:05,904
And out of nowhere,
he just attacked me.

432
00:24:05,946 --> 00:24:08,073
My brother's
never been violent.

433
00:24:08,115 --> 00:24:10,576
I'm sure he didn't mean
to hurt you.

434
00:24:10,617 --> 00:24:13,036
But he did.

435
00:24:15,122 --> 00:24:17,291
Let me just take you home.

436
00:24:22,087 --> 00:24:24,548
This has been
pretty traumatic for me.

437
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:27,551
I-I-I think that you should
come over for the next few days

438
00:24:27,593 --> 00:24:29,553
So we can talk it out.

439
00:24:29,595 --> 00:24:32,639
We broke up, Mel. It is not
my job to hold your hand.

440
00:24:34,808 --> 00:24:37,352
Well, maybe I shouldn't
go home right away.

441
00:24:39,396 --> 00:24:41,648
Maybe I should go
to the cops first.

442
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:42,900
The cops?

443
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:44,818
I was attacked.

444
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:47,863
It's my civic duty to report it,
don't you think?

445
00:24:47,905 --> 00:24:49,865
Mel, I just told you

446
00:24:49,907 --> 00:24:52,951
that Caleb did not mean
to do what he did, okay?

447
00:24:52,951 --> 00:24:54,453
Melanie, please.
- Screw you.

448
00:24:54,453 --> 00:24:56,747
no, you cannot tell anybody
about this!

449
00:24:56,788 --> 00:25:00,292
I can tell who I want! Get your hands off of me!
We're talking about my brother here!

450
00:25:00,334 --> 00:25:03,295
Your brother is going to go
to jail for the next ten years,

451
00:25:03,337 --> 00:25:06,048
so I say let go!

452
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,093
Hey, Melanie!

453
00:25:10,135 --> 00:25:11,386
What?!

454
00:25:12,513 --> 00:25:16,350
You leave my family alone!
Uhh!

455
00:25:54,263 --> 00:25:56,265
<i>we all met Lynette Scavo</i></i>

456
00:25:56,306 --> 00:25:58,267
<i>the day</i>
<i>she moved onto Wisteria Lane.</i></i>

457
00:25:58,308 --> 00:26:01,812
<i>we quickly decided</i>
<i>she would be our friend,</i></i>

458
00:26:01,854 --> 00:26:05,899
<i>mostly because we were</i>
<i>afraid to have her as an enemy.</i></i>

459
00:26:05,941 --> 00:26:09,611
...playing Russian roulette with my ovaries and--
- Lynette!

460
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,198
Hi.
- Hi.

461
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,200
Hi. Uh, we just
wanted to come

462
00:26:15,242 --> 00:26:17,202
welcome you
to the neighborhood.

463
00:26:17,244 --> 00:26:20,706
Um, but we could
come back later.
- Yeah.

464
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:23,041
No, wait. Actually, wait.
This is perfect.

465
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:25,586
You know why? Because we need
some impartial judges.
- Lynette...

466
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:28,130
Let's suppose your husband
begged you to get pregnant--

467
00:26:28,172 --> 00:26:30,090
begged you--and out
of the goodness of your heart,

468
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:32,676
you agreed, even though
it might derail your career.

469
00:26:32,718 --> 00:26:34,678
You agreed to a baby.
<i>A</i> baby, singular.</i>

470
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,638
Lynette, we've just met
these people.

471
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,849
Then--then you go in
for an ultrasound,

472
00:26:38,891 --> 00:26:40,851
and you hear
two heartbeats.

473
00:26:40,893 --> 00:26:43,353
Then and only then does
your husband tell you

474
00:26:43,395 --> 00:26:45,355
that twins run
in his family.

475
00:26:45,397 --> 00:26:47,524
I didn't think
it was that big a deal!

476
00:26:47,566 --> 00:26:49,526
Your family had
eight sets of twins

477
00:26:49,568 --> 00:26:50,986
over three generations,

478
00:26:50,986 --> 00:26:52,946
not to mention your relatives
in Kentucky with triplets!

479
00:26:52,988 --> 00:26:55,240
Triplets! So I ask you,

480
00:26:55,282 --> 00:26:58,619
do I not deserve to punish
this man severely?

481
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,120
Well, actually, I think

482
00:27:00,162 --> 00:27:03,916
that twins are genetically
determined by the mother.

483
00:27:03,957 --> 00:27:05,959
What are you,
a scientist?

484
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:09,588
No. No,
I write children's books.

485
00:27:09,588 --> 00:27:12,758
Um, we, uh, just came over
to introduce ourselves,

486
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,969
but we can, um,
do that at another time.

487
00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:17,763
No, wait. Please stay.
It's okay.

488
00:27:17,804 --> 00:27:19,765
We're okay.
We're okay, right?

489
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:23,519
Honey, we don't wanna
freak out the new neighbors.

490
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,021
I'm sorry that you saw
my panic attack.

491
00:27:26,021 --> 00:27:28,649
I won't
let it happen again,

492
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:31,151
especially since this is
my last pregnancy.

493
00:27:31,193 --> 00:27:34,613
Right. You're the boss.
I'm just your love slave.

494
00:27:34,655 --> 00:27:36,698
Aw.

495
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,200
Well, don't encourage him.

496
00:27:38,242 --> 00:27:40,702
Honey, clearly, our new neighbors consent

497
00:27:40,744 --> 00:27:45,374
that you have been gifted
with a phenomenal husband.

498
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:48,544
Cannonball!

499
00:27:48,585 --> 00:27:49,878
Guys?

500
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,839
Could you come here
for a second?

501
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,508
We need to have
a serious talk.

502
00:27:58,053 --> 00:28:03,308
Okay, we have had
a great... vacation,

503
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,686
but tomorrow
we're going home.

504
00:28:05,686 --> 00:28:10,482
Except we're not going
to <i>our</i> home.</i>

505
00:28:10,524 --> 00:28:13,485
We're gonna go stay
with grandma.

506
00:28:13,527 --> 00:28:16,655
Is Dad
gonna be there?

507
00:28:16,655 --> 00:28:18,657
No, Dad is not
gonna be there,

508
00:28:18,657 --> 00:28:23,412
but he--he is gonna come
and see you guys all the time.

509
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:26,915
We are still
gonna be a family.

510
00:28:26,915 --> 00:28:30,252
It's just...

511
00:28:30,252 --> 00:28:34,965
We won't be living
in the same place anymore.

512
00:28:35,007 --> 00:28:38,802
So...

513
00:28:38,844 --> 00:28:41,680
Is there any questions
you wanna ask me?

514
00:28:44,349 --> 00:28:46,185
Can we go
swimming now?

515
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:53,775
Cannonball!

516
00:29:15,923 --> 00:29:17,591
Mike, what a surprise.

517
00:29:17,633 --> 00:29:20,469
Yeah. How's it goin'?

518
00:29:20,511 --> 00:29:22,137
Good, good. I'm...

519
00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:27,142
just came in to get
a new battery for my watch.

520
00:29:27,184 --> 00:29:30,187
So... Whatcha doin'?

521
00:29:30,229 --> 00:29:32,189
Oh, just buying something
for my grandma.

522
00:29:32,231 --> 00:29:33,690
It's her 90th birthday.

523
00:29:33,732 --> 00:29:35,025
Here we go.

524
00:29:35,067 --> 00:29:37,110
This will sweep her
right off her feet.

525
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:41,907
It's elegant, and she can
build on it for anniversaries.

526
00:29:41,949 --> 00:29:44,785
Lucky grandma.

527
00:29:44,785 --> 00:29:47,788
You dog. You're gonna ask
Susan to marry you, aren't you?

528
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:50,082
I didn't say that.
- Man, I'm cool.

529
00:29:50,123 --> 00:29:53,043
As far as I'm concerned,
Susan's old news, so...

530
00:29:53,085 --> 00:29:54,586
Mazel tov.

531
00:29:54,586 --> 00:29:56,588
I don't suppose
there's any hope

532
00:29:56,588 --> 00:29:59,383
of you keeping your mouth shut
about this, is there?

533
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:02,386
I wanted to surprise her.
- Oh, trust me, brother.
She'll be surprised,

534
00:30:02,427 --> 00:30:05,722
and not just
by how small that rock is.

535
00:30:12,104 --> 00:30:14,356
look, I-I know
it's an expensive car,

536
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:17,818
but I need one,
so can I get the money?

537
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,823
You're a lousy liar, kid.
I read the papers.

538
00:30:22,865 --> 00:30:25,826
I know what happened
to your father.

539
00:30:25,868 --> 00:30:30,497
My guess is he's in the market
for a fancy lawyer

540
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:33,917
to get him
some rich man's justice.

541
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:35,627
Please.

542
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:39,464
Paul Young put Deirdre

543
00:30:39,464 --> 00:30:43,468
544
00:30:32,537 --> 00:30:34,638
My daughter. Your mother.

544
00:30:43,468 --> 00:30:45,220
So we're clear,

545
00:30:45,262 --> 00:30:48,682
I don't write checks
to monsters.

546
00:30:48,724 --> 00:30:51,602
Why can't you
just give me the money?

547
00:30:51,643 --> 00:30:53,937
You're dying.
You don't need it. I do.

548
00:30:53,979 --> 00:30:57,065
Don't cry, Zach.
It pisses me off.

549
00:30:57,107 --> 00:31:00,194
Well, you said all of this
was gonna be mine,

550
00:31:00,235 --> 00:31:02,321
so when do I get it?!

551
00:31:02,321 --> 00:31:04,323
"Empire" is
a highfalutin word,

552
00:31:04,323 --> 00:31:06,783
but that's what I've built.

553
00:31:06,825 --> 00:31:09,203
Unfortunately...

554
00:31:09,244 --> 00:31:14,875
an empire can only be ruled
by an iron fist

555
00:31:14,917 --> 00:31:18,045
and a strong gut.

556
00:31:18,086 --> 00:31:21,131
I wanted to give it to you,
Zach,

557
00:31:21,173 --> 00:31:24,218
But I'm starting to have
my doubts about you.

558
00:31:24,218 --> 00:31:28,222
So what?

559
00:31:28,263 --> 00:31:29,932
Are you cutting me off?

560
00:31:29,973 --> 00:31:33,769
I don't have any use
for weakness.

561
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,357
Get out.

562
00:32:21,024 --> 00:32:23,151
What, are you gonna kill me?

563
00:32:24,611 --> 00:32:27,489
Prove you're a tough guy?

564
00:32:30,534 --> 00:32:32,661
See?
That's why I can't give you

565
00:32:32,703 --> 00:32:34,705
the keys to the kingdom,
kid.

566
00:32:36,957 --> 00:32:39,418
No balls.

567
00:33:17,706 --> 00:33:22,544
<i>we met Gabrielle Solis the day</i>
<i>she moved to Wisteria Lane.</i></i>

568
00:33:22,586 --> 00:33:25,047
<i>we were all excited</i>
<i>to get a glimpse</i></i>

569
00:33:25,088 --> 00:33:28,008
<i>of a successful new york model.</i></i>

570
00:33:29,301 --> 00:33:30,302
Hello?

571
00:33:30,302 --> 00:33:32,095
<i>we saw more...</i></i>

572
00:33:32,137 --> 00:33:34,139
Hi there.

573
00:33:34,139 --> 00:33:36,934
<i>than we bargained for.</i></i>

574
00:33:38,936 --> 00:33:40,479
I'm Mary Alice.

575
00:33:40,521 --> 00:33:41,563
Hi.

576
00:33:41,605 --> 00:33:43,941
This is Susan,
uh, Lynette and Bree.

577
00:33:43,982 --> 00:33:45,901
Welcome
to the neighborhood.

578
00:33:45,943 --> 00:33:47,736
Well, I am Gabrielle Solis.

579
00:33:47,736 --> 00:33:51,240
Would it be better
if we came back at another time?

580
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,575
Oh! No, no. I was...

581
00:33:53,617 --> 00:33:56,245
just changing
out of my sweaty clothes.

582
00:33:56,286 --> 00:33:59,706
I didn't realize
moving was such great cardio.

583
00:33:59,748 --> 00:34:04,086
Hey, babe, we haven't tried it
in the kitchen yet.

584
00:34:06,213 --> 00:34:09,758
Honey, uh, I think it's time
to unpack the pants.

585
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,553
Right.

586
00:34:12,594 --> 00:34:14,596
It's nice to meet you ladies.

587
00:34:16,306 --> 00:34:19,184
Let me guess--newlyweds?

588
00:34:19,226 --> 00:34:20,644
Four months,

589
00:34:20,686 --> 00:34:24,940
and I've dressed like this
for two of 'em.

590
00:34:24,982 --> 00:34:27,067
He's insatiable.

591
00:34:37,995 --> 00:34:39,955
Hey, what are you doing?

592
00:34:41,999 --> 00:34:44,168
Now?
Babe, it's kind of late.

593
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:47,880
You don't wanna have sex
with me?

594
00:34:47,921 --> 00:34:49,965
You always wanna have sex
with me.

595
00:34:49,965 --> 00:34:51,967
You wanted to have sex
with me

596
00:34:51,967 --> 00:34:53,969
an hour
after your hernia operation.

597
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:56,388
I'm a little preoccupied.

598
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:59,099
A good man died today.

599
00:34:59,141 --> 00:35:01,268
Don't take it personally.

600
00:35:10,777 --> 00:35:14,740
Xiao-mei said
the strangest thing to me.

601
00:35:14,781 --> 00:35:16,742
When I told her
you were dead,

602
00:35:16,783 --> 00:35:19,286
she said,
"Please don't kill him."

603
00:35:21,955 --> 00:35:24,458
That poor kid.

604
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:28,629
Oh. We really need to get her
some English lessons.

605
00:35:39,223 --> 00:35:41,892
Julie,
what are you doing?

606
00:35:41,934 --> 00:35:43,644
I'm trying to sleep.

607
00:35:43,685 --> 00:35:45,479
Morning, ladies.

608
00:35:45,521 --> 00:35:48,524
Karl! What are you doing?

609
00:35:48,565 --> 00:35:51,527
I've got a little surprise
planned for my girls.

610
00:35:51,568 --> 00:35:55,072
So just sit back and relax.
We'll be there shortly.

611
00:35:58,951 --> 00:36:02,913
No, no, no, no.
No, turn my house around.

612
00:36:02,955 --> 00:36:05,082
Latte?

613
00:36:11,004 --> 00:36:13,006
out to the right,
ladies.

614
00:36:17,135 --> 00:36:18,637
My gift to you.

615
00:36:20,347 --> 00:36:22,015
You bought us a house?

616
00:36:22,057 --> 00:36:25,310
Let's have a look around.
There's three bedrooms,

617
00:36:25,352 --> 00:36:27,312
a gourmet kitchen...
for what it's worth.

618
00:36:27,354 --> 00:36:29,314
There's a guest house
in the back

619
00:36:29,356 --> 00:36:31,775
that you could use as a studio.
There's a pool.

620
00:36:31,817 --> 00:36:33,277
A pool? Really? Aah!

621
00:36:35,195 --> 00:36:36,655
What's the catch?

622
00:36:36,697 --> 00:36:38,824
There's no catch.
It's yours, Susie.

623
00:36:38,866 --> 00:36:42,244
Yours and Julie's,
no strings attached.

624
00:36:42,286 --> 00:36:45,080
I can't accept this.

625
00:36:45,122 --> 00:36:47,916
I just--I gotta get out
of this mess on my own.

626
00:36:47,958 --> 00:36:50,002
This is not charity.

627
00:36:50,002 --> 00:36:51,962
I owe you...

628
00:36:52,004 --> 00:36:54,464
for everything I've done
over the years,

629
00:36:54,506 --> 00:36:57,885
for all the heartache
I've inflicted on you.

630
00:36:57,926 --> 00:36:59,803
Consider it payback.

631
00:36:59,803 --> 00:37:02,556
Mom!

632
00:37:02,598 --> 00:37:04,725
There's a pool <i>and</i> a jacuzzi!</i>

633
00:37:04,766 --> 00:37:07,227
At least no one
can drive off with it

634
00:37:07,269 --> 00:37:09,855
while you're sleeping, huh?

635
00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:15,360
<i>hey, it's Susan.</i></i>

636
00:37:15,402 --> 00:37:18,363
<i>just wanted you to know I let</i>
<i>the electrician in your house.</i></i>

637
00:37:18,405 --> 00:37:20,866
<i>I hope you're having</i>
<i>a great time at the spa.</i></i>

638
00:37:22,284 --> 00:37:23,744
<i>Bree, hi. It's Betty.</i></i>

639
00:37:23,785 --> 00:37:26,246
<i>I'm--I'm sorry to leave this</i>
<i>on the machine,</i></i>

640
00:37:26,288 --> 00:37:28,749
<i>but the police have evidence</i>
<i>that implicates Matthew</i></i>

641
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:30,751
<i>in the murder</i>
<i>of Melanie foster.</i></i>

642
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:32,753
<i>we have to find them, Bree.</i></i>

643
00:37:32,794 --> 00:37:35,672
<i>we have to find them</i>
<i>and get Danielle back.</i></i>

644
00:37:41,845 --> 00:37:44,306
you let go of me
right now!
- Hey, hey!

645
00:37:44,306 --> 00:37:48,060
What's going on here?
- I am trying to leave,
and these morons won't let me.

646
00:37:48,101 --> 00:37:50,812
Do you know that you can be
arrested for kidnapping,

647
00:37:50,854 --> 00:37:53,482
for detaining someone?!
- Why do you need to leave?

648
00:37:53,524 --> 00:37:56,401
Because my daughter is in danger.
Something happened at cheerleading camp.

649
00:37:56,443 --> 00:37:58,403
Okay, there's no camp.
That was a fib on my part.

650
00:37:58,445 --> 00:38:00,697
I found out that she ran away
with a boy,

651
00:38:00,739 --> 00:38:03,408
and the boy is a murderer.
A murderer?

652
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:06,203
I can tell by your tone
that you don't believe me.

653
00:38:06,245 --> 00:38:09,164
Bree, let's talk about this
in my office.

654
00:38:09,206 --> 00:38:10,999
I don't have time for therapy,
you quack!

655
00:38:11,041 --> 00:38:13,502
Now let me out of here!
Let go of me!

656
00:38:13,544 --> 00:38:15,504
You idiot, let go of me!

657
00:38:15,546 --> 00:38:17,506
You know that I
committed myself voluntarily!

658
00:38:17,548 --> 00:38:20,092
You can't do this to me!
No!

659
00:38:20,133 --> 00:38:21,927
Bree, please, don't struggle.

660
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:28,600
If anything happens
to my daughter,

661
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,102
so help me God...

662
00:38:30,102 --> 00:38:33,438
We're only trying to help.

663
00:38:48,704 --> 00:38:52,499
Mr. Young, you'll need
to come up to the house

664
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:53,667
to sign
some legal documents.

665
00:38:53,667 --> 00:38:55,002
What for?

666
00:38:55,002 --> 00:38:57,546
Noah Taylor's will called
for an immediate transference

667
00:38:57,588 --> 00:39:00,257
of his entire estate to you
upon his death.

668
00:39:03,343 --> 00:39:05,304
So everything's mine?

669
00:39:05,345 --> 00:39:07,055
That's correct.

670
00:39:14,813 --> 00:39:16,106
Hi, Dad.

671
00:39:16,106 --> 00:39:19,067
so, did you have
any luck with your grandfather?

672
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:21,069
Yeah, I talked to Noah.

673
00:39:21,111 --> 00:39:23,071
He's not gonna give us
the money.

674
00:39:23,113 --> 00:39:24,573
Damn it, Zach!
Sorry?

675
00:39:24,615 --> 00:39:26,575
Go back and talk to him.

676
00:39:26,617 --> 00:39:29,077
No, I-I don't think
he's gonna change his mind.

677
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:31,079
Terrific.
Am I gonna see you tomorrow?

678
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:33,081
No, I-I can't come tomorrow.

679
00:39:33,123 --> 00:39:34,583
What about Monday?

680
00:39:34,625 --> 00:39:36,585
Uh, next week's bad for me,
too.

681
00:39:36,627 --> 00:39:39,129
I'll--I'll call you
when I know.
- Zach? Zach!

682
00:39:39,171 --> 00:39:41,465
Is there anything I can do?

683
00:39:41,507 --> 00:39:45,219
Yeah, get me a new phone
with a different number.

684
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:50,349
And fill in
this stupid lake.

685
00:40:13,497 --> 00:40:14,957
Careful with those.

686
00:40:14,957 --> 00:40:17,626
The last of the crystal.
- Okay.

687
00:40:17,626 --> 00:40:19,795
Hey, what's going on?

688
00:40:19,837 --> 00:40:22,214
Oh, hi.
Um, we're just moving.

689
00:40:22,256 --> 00:40:24,258
Hey! It's the plumber.

690
00:40:24,299 --> 00:40:27,803
You come over to help Susie
move into her new house?

691
00:40:27,803 --> 00:40:29,137
New house?

692
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:32,224
Oh, she didn't tell you?
I bought a place for my girls.

693
00:40:32,266 --> 00:40:34,226
You let him buy you
a house?

694
00:40:34,226 --> 00:40:36,144
Uh, well,
he's not moving in with us.

695
00:40:36,395 --> 00:40:38,981
After that speech about
wanting to go it alone,

696
00:40:39,022 --> 00:40:41,942
and after I offered
to let you stay with me?

697
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:44,444
To be fair,
you just had a spare room,

698
00:40:44,444 --> 00:40:46,155
and this is a whole house.

699
00:40:46,196 --> 00:40:47,656
Hey, no offense,

700
00:40:47,698 --> 00:40:50,784
if you're not using your back,
you're just in the way.

701
00:40:50,826 --> 00:40:53,078
You saw me
buying that ring,

702
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,205
and you just had
to cut me off.

703
00:40:55,247 --> 00:40:57,249
You bought me a ring?

704
00:40:57,291 --> 00:40:59,209
Suze, let me handle this.

705
00:40:59,251 --> 00:41:01,628
A man's gotta protect
his family.

706
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:04,256
Uh, Mike, about that ring...
- Put that box down.

707
00:41:04,298 --> 00:41:07,426
What, you gonna hit me,
huh?

708
00:41:07,467 --> 00:41:09,094
stop it! Oh, my...

709
00:41:10,554 --> 00:41:13,390
What are you--
just stop it! Oh, that's enough!

710
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:17,728
Just get off! Get off! Go! Go!
Oh, my God.

711
00:41:17,769 --> 00:41:20,981
What? Stop! That's enough.
Enough, enough. Back up.

712
00:41:20,981 --> 00:41:25,360
And that ring--
that was for me, right?
- Not now.

713
00:41:25,402 --> 00:41:27,196
oh, my...

714
00:41:27,237 --> 00:41:28,739
Ohh!

715
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:31,909
Karl, are you okay?

716
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:34,286
Are you okay? Let me see.

717
00:41:34,286 --> 00:41:36,455
Oh, my God.

718
00:41:38,457 --> 00:41:40,167
Whew.

719
00:41:40,209 --> 00:41:42,878
can you sit up?

720
00:41:48,425 --> 00:41:50,427
whew.

721
00:41:53,096 --> 00:41:55,849
Xiao-mei,
do you have a second?

722
00:41:55,891 --> 00:41:58,852
This is probably silly,
but it's been bothering me.

723
00:41:58,894 --> 00:42:01,104
When you said,
"Please don't kill him,"

724
00:42:01,104 --> 00:42:02,564
did you mean Carlos?

725
00:42:02,606 --> 00:42:06,360
Ralph dead, not Mr. Solis.

726
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:10,197
I know. It's just,
you said "kill," not "dead."

727
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:13,367
And I'd have to do be
pretty angry to kill someone,

728
00:42:13,408 --> 00:42:15,369
so I guess my question is,

729
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:18,330
do I have a reason
to be angry at Mr. Solis?

730
00:42:20,582 --> 00:42:23,126
Please, so much laundry.

731
00:42:27,422 --> 00:42:28,715
Xiao-mei...

732
00:42:30,509 --> 00:42:33,679
how did you rip
your panties?

733
00:42:38,058 --> 00:42:40,561
I fall down.

734
00:42:42,354 --> 00:42:44,815
Says here Dr. Bader
examined Xiao-mei last week,

735
00:42:44,815 --> 00:42:46,942
and everything was fine.

736
00:42:46,984 --> 00:42:48,443
Yeah, I know.

737
00:42:48,443 --> 00:42:50,904
It's just, she's been
having pain... down there.

738
00:42:50,946 --> 00:42:52,948
So if you could take a peek,

739
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:54,950
it'd make me feel
so much better.

740
00:42:54,992 --> 00:42:55,951
Of course.

741
00:42:55,993 --> 00:42:57,953
Um, and, Doctor, uh,

742
00:42:57,995 --> 00:42:59,454
while you're down there,

743
00:42:59,454 --> 00:43:01,456
could you check
if she's still a virgin?

744
00:43:01,456 --> 00:43:03,375
I'm sorry?

745
00:43:03,417 --> 00:43:05,586
You don't even have
to say it out loud.

746
00:43:05,627 --> 00:43:08,255
If you see hymen,
just give me a thumbs up.

747
00:43:49,338 --> 00:43:50,797
What's this now?

748
00:43:50,839 --> 00:43:52,299
I wanna swim.

749
00:43:52,341 --> 00:43:54,801
Well, we already swam.
Now it's time to pack.

750
00:43:54,843 --> 00:43:57,971
Hey, hey, hey!
What's going on?

751
00:43:58,013 --> 00:44:00,098
Dad would let me swim.

752
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:02,100
Well, Dad's not here,

753
00:44:02,142 --> 00:44:06,271
so I decide,
and I decide no.

754
00:44:09,983 --> 00:44:11,944
Oh, Porter,
what are you doing?

755
00:44:11,985 --> 00:44:13,153
Hey!

756
00:44:13,153 --> 00:44:15,739
Hey, get down off that
right now. I mean it!

757
00:44:15,781 --> 00:44:18,408
Okay! Okay, okay, Porter,
just stop, all right?

758
00:44:18,408 --> 00:44:21,662
Just come on inside, and we'll
forget the whole thing.

759
00:44:21,703 --> 00:44:23,914
Aah!
Aah! No!

760
00:44:32,464 --> 00:44:33,674
Daddy!

761
00:44:33,715 --> 00:44:35,050
Daddy!
Daddy!

762
00:44:35,092 --> 00:44:39,847
Hey, guys. God! Ooh, God,
I've missed you so much.

763
00:44:39,888 --> 00:44:42,432
Oh, you, too, munchkin.

764
00:44:47,187 --> 00:44:49,147
Where's Porter?
Is he okay?

765
00:44:49,147 --> 00:44:51,775
He broke his arm.
They took him up to X-ray.

766
00:44:51,817 --> 00:44:55,737
Hey, guys, why don't you look
after your sister for me, okay?

767
00:44:55,737 --> 00:44:57,739
Mommy and Daddy
need to talk.

768
00:45:00,242 --> 00:45:02,703
I've got nothing to say
to you.

769
00:45:02,744 --> 00:45:04,705
I just called
because I had to.

770
00:45:04,746 --> 00:45:06,748
Honey, whatever you saw,
I can explain it.

771
00:45:06,748 --> 00:45:08,208
I am not interested,

772
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:10,210
and if you wanna
keep those fingers,

773
00:45:10,252 --> 00:45:12,754
I would move 'em away from my b

774
00:45:14,089 --> 00:45:16,341
Lynette,
I am not cheating on you.

775
00:45:16,383 --> 00:45:18,927
I never have,
and I never will.

776
00:45:18,969 --> 00:45:21,388
I saw you
with that woman.

777
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:24,391
Her name is Nora. I met her 12 years ago.
- I don't care what her name is.

778
00:45:24,433 --> 00:45:27,477
I met her before you. She was
a dancer on a cruise ship.

779
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:29,354
We had a one night stand.

780
00:45:29,396 --> 00:45:32,065
I haven't thought about her in years.
- Then why are you
going to Atlantic City

781
00:45:32,107 --> 00:45:35,527
every other weekend to visit her?
-

782
00:45:35,527 --> 00:45:39,698
I have another child,
Lynette.

783
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:42,451
What?

784
00:45:42,451 --> 00:45:44,578
She got pregnant
from the one night stand.

785
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:46,914
Nora raised the kid
without ever telling me.

786
00:45:46,955 --> 00:45:48,916
I only just found out
about it.

787
00:45:48,957 --> 00:45:51,335
That is why I have been
going back and forth.

788
00:45:51,376 --> 00:45:53,337
I am not having an affair.

789
00:45:56,089 --> 00:45:58,008
Uhh!

790
00:46:08,936 --> 00:46:10,896
The little girl's name
is Kayla.

791
00:46:10,896 --> 00:46:13,190
She's 11 years old.

792
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:16,151
I know I should've told you
about this sooner.

793
00:46:16,151 --> 00:46:19,112
It's just that I wanted to take
a paternity test to be sure,

794
00:46:19,154 --> 00:46:21,240
and I'm definitely the Dad.

795
00:46:24,576 --> 00:46:27,329
Why did she wait so long
to contact you?

796
00:46:27,371 --> 00:46:29,832
She said she wanted
to raise the kid alone,

797
00:46:29,873 --> 00:46:34,127
and I... I guess
she's changed her mind, honey.

798
00:46:34,169 --> 00:46:38,131
Baby, I am so sorry.

799
00:46:38,173 --> 00:46:40,133
Not ready for that yet.

800
00:46:40,175 --> 00:46:41,468
Okay.

801
00:46:43,136 --> 00:46:46,640
You have no idea how badly
you scared me.

802
00:46:48,475 --> 00:46:49,935
I am so sorry.

803
00:46:49,977 --> 00:46:52,604
I had already let you go.

804
00:46:57,985 --> 00:47:00,737
Dad! I got a blue cast.

805
00:47:00,779 --> 00:47:04,658
Hey, buddy. You sure did.
That's pretty cool.

806
00:47:09,329 --> 00:47:12,207
Hey.

807
00:47:12,249 --> 00:47:15,335
It itches.
Can we go home now?

808
00:47:23,093 --> 00:47:25,888
Yeah. We're going home.

809
00:47:38,358 --> 00:47:40,277
Have they rung up
your prescription yet?

810
00:47:40,652 --> 00:47:41,403
No, they're getting it
right now.

811
00:47:41,403 --> 00:47:42,863
Good. Add that on.

812
00:47:43,739 --> 00:47:46,200
You're dying your hair
honey wheat blond?

813
00:47:46,241 --> 00:47:48,327
Oh, it's not for me.

814
00:47:48,368 --> 00:47:51,246
It's for Danielle.

815
00:47:51,246 --> 00:47:54,666
That hair is going back
to the color God intended.

816
00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:56,919
You actually think
she's gonna sit still

817
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,921
as you towel this
through her hair?

818
00:47:58,962 --> 00:48:01,423
Oh, I will tie her down
if necessary.

819
00:48:01,465 --> 00:48:04,009
I'm also thinking of checking
her body for piercings

820
00:48:04,051 --> 00:48:05,677
While I'm at it.
- You're overreacting.

821
00:48:05,719 --> 00:48:07,721
She's just going through
a phase.

822
00:48:07,721 --> 00:48:09,681
That's what
girls her age do.

823
00:48:09,723 --> 00:48:12,226
They also get pregnant
and become drug addicts.

824
00:48:12,267 --> 00:48:14,978
And that color hair
is the gateway.

825
00:48:16,605 --> 00:48:19,483
Would you please, uh,
add that to our bill?

826
00:48:19,525 --> 00:48:20,984
I'm telling you, Bree,

827
00:48:21,026 --> 00:48:23,028
You're gonna have to
stop riding 'em so hard.

828
00:48:23,028 --> 00:48:26,907
I am trying to ensure that they
turn into responsible adults.

829
00:48:26,949 --> 00:48:29,409
Trust me, Rex,
in the end,

830
00:48:29,409 --> 00:48:31,370
we will be rewarded.

831
00:48:31,411 --> 00:48:33,956
How can you be so damn sure
of yourself all the time?

832
00:48:33,997 --> 00:48:35,874
Why is my certainty a flaw?

833
00:48:35,916 --> 00:48:38,377
I know what I'm about,
I know my values,

834
00:48:38,418 --> 00:48:40,045
and I know what's right.

835
00:48:40,087 --> 00:48:42,047
Why shouldn't I stay
the course?

836
00:48:42,089 --> 00:48:44,591
Am I right,
Mr. Williams?

837
00:48:44,633 --> 00:48:47,177
My mother always took
a firm hand with me,

838
00:48:47,219 --> 00:48:49,179
and I thank her for it.

839
00:48:49,221 --> 00:48:52,140
Exactly, and look how well
you turned out.

840
00:48:55,435 --> 00:48:58,647
Look, you're a good mother,
but there's a limit.

841
00:48:58,689 --> 00:49:01,150
You have got to relinquish
some control,

842
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:03,152
or else
you're gonna regret it.

843
00:49:21,003 --> 00:49:24,131
Excuse me.
Do you have the time?

844
00:49:24,173 --> 00:49:27,301
Yeah, it's just after 8:00.
- Oh, I was afraid of that.

845
00:49:27,342 --> 00:49:28,802
Afraid of what?

846
00:49:28,802 --> 00:49:31,763
Well, I'm only supposed
to be restrained until 7:00.

847
00:49:31,805 --> 00:49:34,141
You see, I have a problem
with sleepwalking.

848
00:49:34,183 --> 00:49:36,518
They just tie me up
so that I don't wander off

849
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,020
and hurt myself.

850
00:49:38,061 --> 00:49:40,939
Yeah, well, I'm sure a nurse
will be in here soon.

851
00:49:40,939 --> 00:49:42,441
One can only hope.

852
00:49:42,441 --> 00:49:44,860
Of course, if a doctor
gets here first

853
00:49:44,902 --> 00:49:48,405
and sees that someone
forgot to release me,

854
00:49:48,447 --> 00:49:51,074
I'm sure they'd get
in a lot of trouble.

855
00:49:51,116 --> 00:49:53,744
Lady, I can't let you
out of your restraints.

856
00:49:53,785 --> 00:49:55,245
I'd get fired.

857
00:49:55,245 --> 00:49:57,998
Oh. Well, I certainly would not
want that to happen.

858
00:50:02,044 --> 00:50:03,504
What's your name?

859
00:50:03,545 --> 00:50:04,755
Alfred.

860
00:50:04,796 --> 00:50:06,673
Oh! Does anybody ever
call you "Alfie"?

861
00:50:06,715 --> 00:50:08,258
No.

862
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:11,678
And why should they?

863
00:50:13,931 --> 00:50:15,974
So, um, Alfred,

864
00:50:16,016 --> 00:50:19,520
I was wondering if you could
maybe loosen my restraints.

865
00:50:19,561 --> 00:50:21,313
They're incredibly tight,

866
00:50:21,355 --> 00:50:23,816
and I'm sure
there are no rules

867
00:50:23,857 --> 00:50:25,859
against making me
more comfortable.

868
00:50:30,781 --> 00:50:33,325
Do you think I'm stupid?

869
00:50:33,367 --> 00:50:35,035
I beg your pardon?

870
00:50:35,077 --> 00:50:37,538
Two seconds after I loosen
these little restraints,

871
00:50:37,579 --> 00:50:39,665
you'll try to scratch
my eyes out

872
00:50:39,665 --> 00:50:41,375
and make a run for it.

873
00:50:41,416 --> 00:50:44,127
Well, I'm not falling for it,
you psycho little bitch.

874
00:50:44,169 --> 00:50:46,547
In fact, I hope they keep you
tied up for the next month.

875
00:50:46,588 --> 00:50:49,049
'cause I'd get a real kick
out of watching

876
00:50:49,091 --> 00:50:51,051
a prissy little whack job
like you

877
00:50:51,093 --> 00:50:53,053
lying in your own filth.

878
00:50:53,095 --> 00:50:54,596
Know what I mean?

879
00:50:58,725 --> 00:51:00,727
Oh. Are you all right?

880
00:51:00,727 --> 00:51:05,065
Uh, yeah. A little hopped up
on pain medicine, but, um,

881
00:51:05,107 --> 00:51:07,568
I chipped my tooth
on the salad shooter.

882
00:51:07,609 --> 00:51:09,570
Oh. Oh, you know,
you should, um,

883
00:51:09,611 --> 00:51:11,738
call my friend Orson.

884
00:51:11,738 --> 00:51:13,198
He's a dentist.

885
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:16,160
I'm sure he'll see you right away.
- Thanks.

886
00:51:16,201 --> 00:51:18,328
So...

887
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:20,998
about that ring you bought--

888
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:24,751
Is there anything particular
you'd like to ask me?

889
00:51:24,793 --> 00:51:26,920
Nope,
not as long Karl's got you

890
00:51:26,962 --> 00:51:28,422
wrapped around his finger.

891
00:51:28,463 --> 00:51:30,090
Okay, that's ridiculous.

892
00:51:30,132 --> 00:51:32,467
Karl doesn't have me
wrapped around anything.

893
00:51:32,467 --> 00:51:35,679
You accepted a house from him,
and you're nuts if you believe

894
00:51:35,721 --> 00:51:37,681
he doesn't have
an ulterior motive.

895
00:51:37,723 --> 00:51:39,683
He's Karl.
He's playing me.

896
00:51:39,683 --> 00:51:42,144
But that house is gonna be
a great place

897
00:51:42,186 --> 00:51:44,688
for my daughter to live.

898
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:46,690
And when he makes his move,

899
00:51:46,732 --> 00:51:50,611
he's gonna realize that
<i>I</i> was really playing <i>him.</i></i>

900
00:51:51,069 --> 00:51:54,698
So... about that ring...

901
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:57,159
I... I just don't want
to get deeper into this

902
00:51:57,201 --> 00:51:59,661
and suddenly realize
your heart's somewhere else.

903
00:51:59,661 --> 00:52:04,374
Mike, my heart is
in the exact right place.

904
00:52:04,416 --> 00:52:06,668
Ugh. I can't have this conversation

905
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:09,046
now my tooth is throbbing.

906
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:11,757
Of course.

907
00:52:11,798 --> 00:52:13,300
Okay.

908
00:52:15,093 --> 00:52:18,472
You don't even wanna know
what my answer would have been?

909
00:52:28,065 --> 00:52:30,025
Can we please
get out of here?

910
00:52:30,067 --> 00:52:31,527
This place is gross.

911
00:52:31,568 --> 00:52:33,487
And, God, I'm starving.

912
00:52:33,529 --> 00:52:35,906
Yeah, I know, but we don't
have any money, remember?

913
00:52:35,948 --> 00:52:37,908
That's why we should
go to my house.

914
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:39,952
I know the combination
to my Mom's safe.

915
00:52:39,952 --> 00:52:41,954
Okay, I've told you
a thousand times,

916
00:52:41,995 --> 00:52:44,456
It's way too risky. No.
- Something you should know before we embark

917
00:52:44,498 --> 00:52:45,958
on this little adventure--

918
00:52:45,999 --> 00:52:48,460
I can get pretty bitchy
when I'm not fed.

919
00:52:55,509 --> 00:52:57,636
Listen, I hope
I'm not out of line here,

920
00:52:57,678 --> 00:53:00,430
but did you ever spend
any time in prison?

921
00:53:00,472 --> 00:53:03,225
What, you can tell
from my teeth?

922
00:53:03,267 --> 00:53:07,020
Jailhouse dentistry--
unmistakable and not pretty.

923
00:53:07,062 --> 00:53:10,023
Yeah, I did a little time
in Kansas a few years back.

924
00:53:10,065 --> 00:53:12,025
Were you a prison dentist?

925
00:53:12,025 --> 00:53:15,821
Uh, during dental school,
we did freebie work

926
00:53:15,821 --> 00:53:18,740
on some of the poor guinea pigs
behind bars. No offense.

927
00:53:18,782 --> 00:53:21,743
You know, I had the feeling
when I first saw you

928
00:53:21,743 --> 00:53:24,580
In the movie theater
that we'd met before.
- I don't think so.

929
00:53:24,621 --> 00:53:27,082
Oh, I'm pretty sure.
I think I know you.

930
00:53:27,124 --> 00:53:29,877
Any chance I was
one of your guinea pigs?

931
00:53:29,918 --> 00:53:33,547
No. the only prison work
I did was back in Virginia.

932
00:53:36,466 --> 00:53:39,011
Diploma says you graduated
from Minnesota.

933
00:53:39,011 --> 00:53:42,931
I'm licensed
in three states.

934
00:53:42,973 --> 00:53:45,475
Open wide, please.

935
00:53:45,517 --> 00:53:48,854
Don't talk.
I wouldn't want to hurt you.

936
00:53:54,818 --> 00:53:57,529
Carlos, you promised
you'd come home today.

937
00:53:57,571 --> 00:53:59,823
Well, I don't care
what Tanaka wants!

938
00:53:59,865 --> 00:54:02,284
Rattling around
this stupid house all by myself

939
00:54:02,326 --> 00:54:04,286
is not what I signed up for!

940
00:54:04,328 --> 00:54:08,040
No, no, no, don't hang up on me.
I'm not done yelling at you!

941
00:54:33,023 --> 00:54:35,651
Mrs. Solis.

942
00:54:35,692 --> 00:54:37,152
How are you?

943
00:54:37,194 --> 00:54:40,113
The best you've ever had.

944
00:54:51,959 --> 00:54:54,378
What's so funny?

945
00:54:54,419 --> 00:54:56,880
Me and my friend Justin
had this bet.

946
00:54:56,922 --> 00:54:58,924
See who could lose
their virginity first

947
00:54:58,924 --> 00:55:00,884
this summer at bible camp.

948
00:55:00,926 --> 00:55:03,345
Guess I beat him
to the punch.

949
00:55:05,097 --> 00:55:06,557
You were a virgin?

950
00:55:06,598 --> 00:55:08,851
So it didn't show?

951
00:55:08,892 --> 00:55:10,602
Uh, no.

952
00:55:10,644 --> 00:55:13,105
No, I mean, I guess it was,
well, weird when

953
00:55:13,147 --> 00:55:16,316
you started naming the American
presidents in order.

954
00:55:16,358 --> 00:55:18,443
Ah, I wish you hadn't
heard that.

955
00:55:18,485 --> 00:55:20,445
I was just trying to...

956
00:55:20,445 --> 00:55:23,073
No, no, you were good.

957
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:27,953
Just, if it comes up in school,
Paul Revere was never president.

958
00:55:27,995 --> 00:55:31,623
Oh. Thanks.

959
00:55:31,623 --> 00:55:35,586
I, uh, had a really
awesome time, Mrs. Solis.

960
00:55:35,627 --> 00:55:37,421
Well, good. I'm glad,

961
00:55:37,462 --> 00:55:39,673
because this can
never happen again.

962
00:55:39,673 --> 00:55:40,674
Why?

963
00:55:40,674 --> 00:55:42,467
The only reason I did this

964
00:55:42,467 --> 00:55:44,636
was because I was angry
at Carlos.

965
00:55:44,636 --> 00:55:47,306
Now, thanks to you,
I'm not angry anymore.

966
00:55:47,347 --> 00:55:49,975
Well, you should be.
I mean, the guy's never around.

967
00:55:50,017 --> 00:55:52,644
Hell, he's probably off having
his own affair right now.

968
00:55:52,686 --> 00:55:55,814
Oh. 
I seriously doubt that.

969
00:55:55,856 --> 00:55:57,816
How do you know?

970
00:55:57,858 --> 00:56:00,819
Because Carlos doesn't have
an adulterous bone in his body.

971
00:56:00,861 --> 00:56:02,821
What we just did
he could never do.

972
00:56:02,863 --> 00:56:08,243
For him, sex isn't just sex.
It's a sign of intimacy.

973
00:56:08,285 --> 00:56:11,371
It's the way he shows love.

974
00:56:11,413 --> 00:56:15,000
You know, instead of
talking and listening

975
00:56:15,042 --> 00:56:17,794
and spending time with me.

976
00:56:21,632 --> 00:56:23,926
What was that for?

977
00:56:23,967 --> 00:56:26,720
Thought you needed a kiss.

978
00:56:29,181 --> 00:56:32,100
Well, since this is
our last time,

979
00:56:32,142 --> 00:56:34,603
I guess we can make
the most of it.

980
00:56:40,526 --> 00:56:44,655
So... you really trust him,
huh?

981
00:56:44,655 --> 00:56:46,156
Completely.

982
00:56:48,534 --> 00:56:50,536
<i>Like all good mothers,</i></i>

983
00:56:50,536 --> 00:56:56,124
<i>Gabrielle had purchased several</i>
<i>top-of-the-line baby monitors.</i></i>

984
00:56:56,124 --> 00:56:59,253
<i>She had planned to use them</i>
<i>to keep a close watch</i></i>

985
00:56:59,253 --> 00:57:01,880
<i>on her newborn child.</i></i>

986
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:06,426
<i>That plan was about to change.</i></i>

987
00:57:12,391 --> 00:57:14,393
So I'm gonna go shopping

988
00:57:14,393 --> 00:57:16,186
and then I'm gonna see
my trainer,

989
00:57:16,186 --> 00:57:18,647
and I'll definitely be gone
for, like, three hours.

990
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:24,778
Okay. Well, I gotta go.
Have fun.

991
00:57:33,453 --> 00:57:34,913
<i> not later, Penny.</i></i>

992
00:57:34,955 --> 00:57:37,583
<i>Mommy's gotta change you now</i>
<i>'cause you stink.</i></i>

993
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,715
<i> </i>
<i>Here, taste this.</i></i>

994
00:57:44,756 --> 00:57:46,425
<i> Oh, man!</i></i>

995
00:57:46,425 --> 00:57:48,302
<i>Xiao-mei,</i>
<i>that is amazing.</i></i>

996
00:57:48,343 --> 00:57:49,636
<i>You like?</i></i>

997
00:57:49,678 --> 00:57:52,264
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>
<i>Sorry if I'm making a mess.</i></i>

998
00:57:52,306 --> 00:57:56,727
<i>It's okay. Mu shun pork</i>
<i>supposed to be messy.</i></i>

999
00:57:56,768 --> 00:57:58,729
<i>I wish Gabrielle could</i>
<i>cook like this.</i></i>

1000
00:57:58,770 --> 00:58:00,731
<i>Have you ever tried</i>
<i>her enchiladas?</i></i>

1001
00:58:00,731 --> 00:58:03,901
<i>One time</i>
<i>they make me sick.</i></i>

1002
00:58:12,576 --> 00:58:14,578
Ugh. He will,
and he'll meet you

1003
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:17,039
for a romantic
motor home rendezvous,

1004
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:19,041
and you'll propose,
he'll accept,

1005
00:58:19,082 --> 00:58:21,585
and you'll both live
happily ever after.

1006
00:58:21,627 --> 00:58:24,004
You really think
that's what's gonna happen?

1007
00:58:24,046 --> 00:58:26,089
It's my deepest hope.

1008
00:58:26,131 --> 00:58:28,425
Oh, there he is.

1009
00:58:52,407 --> 00:58:54,243
We're in.

1010
00:58:58,914 --> 00:59:00,332
POLLY? THAT'S A GOOD NAME.

1011
00:59:00,332 --> 00:59:01,333
NO WAY.

1012
00:59:01,333 --> 00:59:01,834
PAMELA.

1013
00:59:01,834 --> 00:59:03,836
I said I wanted Penny.

1014
00:59:04,253 --> 00:59:05,254
Oh, Lynette...

1015
00:59:05,254 --> 00:59:08,131
eight hours
of grueling labor.

1016
00:59:09,007 --> 00:59:10,467
That's not fair.

1017
00:59:10,509 --> 00:59:12,970
Neither are stretch marks,
but what are you gonna do?

1018
00:59:13,011 --> 00:59:16,014
I've only known one Penny
in my whole life,

1019
00:59:16,056 --> 00:59:18,267
And she was a slut.
- Isn't your aunt named Penny?

1020
00:59:18,308 --> 00:59:19,935
Yeah, that's her.

1021
00:59:19,977 --> 00:59:23,480
Our daughter
is officially named.

1022
00:59:23,522 --> 00:59:25,023
You may go now.

1023
00:59:25,023 --> 00:59:27,693
All right,
I'll let you win this one,

1024
00:59:27,734 --> 00:59:30,195
but I get to name
the next one.

1025
00:59:30,237 --> 00:59:33,323
You promised me
we'd stop at four.

1026
00:59:33,323 --> 00:59:35,284
Remember?
You wanted four kids,

1027
00:59:35,325 --> 00:59:38,871
I wanted one, and somehow
we compromised on four.

1028
00:59:38,912 --> 00:59:40,873
Can we please stop now?

1029
00:59:40,914 --> 00:59:42,541
Lynette, you're hurting me.

1030
00:59:42,583 --> 00:59:45,377
I will stop
as soon as you promise.

1031
00:59:45,419 --> 00:59:47,671
Okay, I promise.

1032
00:59:47,713 --> 00:59:50,299
Okay.

1033
00:59:52,384 --> 00:59:54,803
Honey, I...
I didn't mean to upset ya.

1034
00:59:54,845 --> 00:59:56,054
It's just...

1035
00:59:56,054 --> 00:59:57,639
We've been so happy.

1036
00:59:57,681 --> 00:59:59,683
Sweetie, sometimes when
you're at work,

1037
00:59:59,683 --> 01:00:02,186
and I'm home alone
with three young boys,

1038
01:00:02,186 --> 01:00:04,188
I'm not so happy,

1039
01:00:04,229 --> 01:00:07,232
and now I'm gonna be alone
with four kids.

1040
01:00:07,274 --> 01:00:09,818
Each one is a blessing,
yes,

1041
01:00:09,818 --> 01:00:14,615
but I don't think I can
take any more... blessings.

1042
01:00:14,656 --> 01:00:18,160
More blessings could make me
lose my mind.

1043
01:00:18,202 --> 01:00:19,953
Do you understand?

1044
01:00:19,953 --> 01:00:21,330
Yeah.

1045
01:00:21,371 --> 01:00:23,665
Thank you.

1046
01:00:25,584 --> 01:00:27,920
Honey, that really hurt.

1047
01:00:27,961 --> 01:00:30,005
Did it hurt for eight hours?

1048
01:00:30,047 --> 01:00:31,798
No.

1049
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,550
Okay, then.

1050
01:00:40,766 --> 01:00:43,227
I must have been crazy,
agreeing to this.

1051
01:00:43,268 --> 01:00:45,229
Honey, you're gonna feel
differently

1052
01:00:45,270 --> 01:00:46,730
once you meet Kayla.

1053
01:00:46,772 --> 01:00:48,732
She is sweet,
smart little girl,

1054
01:00:48,774 --> 01:00:51,735
plus it'll help you get past
your resentment of Nora.

1055
01:00:51,777 --> 01:00:52,778
I don't...

1056
01:00:52,778 --> 01:00:54,655
Well, here goes.

1057
01:00:59,076 --> 01:01:00,536
Hey, you!

1058
01:01:13,715 --> 01:01:16,760
You must be Lynette.
And you must be Nora.

1059
01:01:16,802 --> 01:01:18,762
I guess it'd be weird
if we hugged.

1060
01:01:18,804 --> 01:01:21,139
Probably.

1061
01:01:21,181 --> 01:01:23,267
Wh-where's Kayla?

1062
01:01:23,308 --> 01:01:24,726
Oh, she didn't come.

1063
01:01:24,768 --> 01:01:27,312
We got into this huge fight,
and I was, like...

1064
01:01:27,312 --> 01:01:29,773
I just couldn't stand
to look at her face

1065
01:01:29,815 --> 01:01:32,776
on that long plane trip, so I
dumped her at the neighbors'.

1066
01:01:32,776 --> 01:01:34,903
But, hey, come on,
you got me.

1067
01:01:44,288 --> 01:01:46,665
So, anyway,
Kayla is doing great.

1068
01:01:46,707 --> 01:01:49,334
She's so pretty.
She's so smart.

1069
01:01:49,376 --> 01:01:52,421
She's practically a star
on her soccer team.

1070
01:01:52,462 --> 01:01:54,506
I have the cutest picture.

1071
01:01:54,548 --> 01:01:56,508
You know,
we wouldn't need a picture

1072
01:01:56,508 --> 01:01:59,511
if you had actually
brought her like you promised.

1073
01:02:00,804 --> 01:02:02,890
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.

1074
01:02:02,931 --> 01:02:05,392
You know, but I just
haven't had much time

1075
01:02:05,434 --> 01:02:08,103
to get away on my own since,
um, I've been taking care

1076
01:02:08,145 --> 01:02:10,606
of your kid for
the past 11 years, Superdad!

1077
01:02:10,647 --> 01:02:12,649
Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

1078
01:02:12,649 --> 01:02:15,944
I know it's been hard.
You've done an amazing job.

1079
01:02:15,986 --> 01:02:18,864
Thank you. I think, so, too.
Apology accepted.

1080
01:02:18,906 --> 01:02:21,200
Anyway, I wasn't sure
that I wanted Kayla here

1081
01:02:21,241 --> 01:02:23,243
if we were gonna talk
about business.

1082
01:02:25,412 --> 01:02:26,788
Business?

1083
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:31,710
I was hoping that we could
talk about child support

1084
01:02:31,710 --> 01:02:35,214
Since I've got, like,
11 years coming to me, right?

1085
01:02:35,214 --> 01:02:37,257
You never told me
I had a daughter.

1086
01:02:37,299 --> 01:02:39,843
My lawyer thinks
that I have a very good case.

1087
01:02:39,843 --> 01:02:42,346
We can't afford this.
We have four kids.

1088
01:02:42,346 --> 01:02:45,432
Tom just lost his job.
That'd bankrupt us.

1089
01:02:45,474 --> 01:02:47,976
I'm the bad guy now
when he's the one

1090
01:02:47,976 --> 01:02:50,896
that knocked me up
and abandoned his child?

1091
01:02:50,938 --> 01:02:54,149
How could he abandon her if
he didn't even know she existed?

1092
01:02:54,149 --> 01:02:56,276
That doesn't let him
off the hook.

1093
01:02:56,318 --> 01:02:59,071
You know, you better do right
by me unless, of course,

1094
01:02:59,112 --> 01:03:01,073
you wanna be known
as Mrs. Deadbeat Dad!

1095
01:03:01,114 --> 01:03:03,158
Just take it easy.

1096
01:03:07,162 --> 01:03:08,914
Are we just gonna keep
talking louder?

1097
01:03:08,914 --> 01:03:10,249
Is that the plan?

1098
01:03:10,249 --> 01:03:12,209
You wanna just keep
raising your voice

1099
01:03:12,251 --> 01:03:14,378
'cause that's how you get
what you want, right?

1100
01:03:14,378 --> 01:03:16,129
You make a scene,
you throw a tantrum,

1101
01:03:16,171 --> 01:03:18,131
and everyone gets scared
and backs off.

1102
01:03:18,173 --> 01:03:19,716
Well, I don't work that way,
lady.

1103
01:03:19,758 --> 01:03:22,219
I don't care that my husband
was so phenomenally stupid

1104
01:03:22,261 --> 01:03:24,012
and/or drunk to actually
have sex with you.

1105
01:03:24,054 --> 01:03:26,515
I'm not gonna let it ruin
my life.

1106
01:03:26,515 --> 01:03:28,475
Am I talking loud enough

1107
01:03:28,517 --> 01:03:31,228
for that to get through to you?

1108
01:03:34,815 --> 01:03:38,068
I'm just gonna pay
the bill.

1109
01:03:40,529 --> 01:03:42,489
Karl, we've been through
a lot together.

1110
01:03:42,531 --> 01:03:44,950
We will always be connected
by Julie,

1111
01:03:44,950 --> 01:03:47,452
but... I know why
you bought me that house,

1112
01:03:47,494 --> 01:03:49,454
And I'm not moving into it.

1113
01:03:49,496 --> 01:03:51,290
Susie, come on, I--

1114
01:03:51,331 --> 01:03:53,250
Karl, we are not
getting back together.

1115
01:03:53,292 --> 01:03:59,089
Not ever. You need to just stop
and realize that it's over.

1116
01:03:59,131 --> 01:04:00,966
I'm gonna marry Mike.

1117
01:04:01,008 --> 01:04:04,178
So I need you
to sign these

1118
01:04:04,178 --> 01:04:06,847
because I have to be
divorced first.

1119
01:04:08,515 --> 01:04:10,100
Mike popped the question

1120
01:04:10,142 --> 01:04:12,895
No. He was going to, but then
you clocked him in the mouth

1121
01:04:12,936 --> 01:04:15,230
with a salad shooter,
remember?

1122
01:04:15,272 --> 01:04:18,942
Actually, I'm going to pop
the question to him

1123
01:04:18,942 --> 01:04:20,611
tomorrow night.

1124
01:04:22,779 --> 01:04:24,656
Guess it cuts down
on the suspense

1125
01:04:24,698 --> 01:04:26,700
knowing he bought you
a ring.

1126
01:04:26,742 --> 01:04:31,955
You would think so,
but, no, it doesn't.

1127
01:04:31,997 --> 01:04:34,374
This is a lot to ask

1128
01:04:34,416 --> 01:04:36,877
for a man
who still loves you, Susie.

1129
01:04:36,877 --> 01:04:39,296
I know.

1130
01:04:39,338 --> 01:04:43,217
But if you really do...
love me,

1131
01:04:43,258 --> 01:04:44,927
you'll let me go.

1132
01:04:51,266 --> 01:04:53,811
Okay, Susie.
I can do that.

1133
01:04:55,771 --> 01:04:58,732
Well, you know where to find me
if it doesn't work out.

1134
01:04:58,774 --> 01:05:01,318
Oh, shut up.

1135
01:05:03,612 --> 01:05:06,114
I don't see another way
to make this work.

1136
01:05:06,114 --> 01:05:08,075
We've gotta dip
into the pensions.

1137
01:05:08,116 --> 01:05:10,077
Oh, I don't like
the sound of that.

1138
01:05:10,118 --> 01:05:12,329
Well, it's that
or the kids' college fund.

1139
01:05:12,371 --> 01:05:14,414
We'll write Nora
one big check,

1140
01:05:14,414 --> 01:05:16,875
and in return,
she'll sign away her claim

1141
01:05:16,917 --> 01:05:18,877
for the back child support.

1142
01:05:18,919 --> 01:05:21,880
If we're lucky, she'll take
the bird in the hand.

1143
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:23,966
Okay, what are we
talking about? How much?

1144
01:05:24,007 --> 01:05:27,344
Well, we need to show her
we're serious.

1145
01:05:27,386 --> 01:05:28,929
$30,000?

1146
01:05:28,971 --> 01:05:31,181
Are you kidding? $30,000?
If she takes you to court,

1147
01:05:31,223 --> 01:05:33,225
we'll lose
and end up paying

1148
01:05:33,267 --> 01:05:35,144
11 years of child support
all at once.

1149
01:05:35,185 --> 01:05:37,146
We could lose the house.

1150
01:05:37,187 --> 01:05:40,315
Oh, we are screwed.
We are just plain screwed.
- Tom!

1151
01:05:42,192 --> 01:05:45,154
I am trying very hard
to be strong right now,

1152
01:05:45,195 --> 01:05:47,656
and you melting down
is not helping me.

1153
01:05:47,698 --> 01:05:50,576
I'm sorry.

1154
01:05:50,576 --> 01:05:53,579
I know we're using up
a huge chunk of our savings,

1155
01:05:53,579 --> 01:05:56,707
but if it keeps that crazy woman
out of our life,

1156
01:05:56,748 --> 01:05:59,459
it is the best money
we have ever spent.

1157
01:05:59,501 --> 01:06:02,421
We will be okay.

1158
01:06:03,881 --> 01:06:06,842
Hey there.

1159
01:06:06,842 --> 01:06:09,428
I was surprised to hear
you wanted a session.

1160
01:06:09,469 --> 01:06:11,930
Well, there's nothing like
being tied to a bed

1161
01:06:11,972 --> 01:06:14,516
to change a girl's mind.

1162
01:06:14,558 --> 01:06:17,394
What do you wanna
talk about?

1163
01:06:17,436 --> 01:06:18,896
Anything at all.

1164
01:06:18,937 --> 01:06:22,983
As you said, I...
I have a lot of issues.

1165
01:06:23,025 --> 01:06:24,943
Well, I assumed as much

1166
01:06:24,943 --> 01:06:26,945
when you told
the ridiculous story

1167
01:06:26,945 --> 01:06:29,823
about your daughter
running off with a murderer.

1168
01:06:29,865 --> 01:06:32,326
Saw right through that,
did ya?

1169
01:06:32,367 --> 01:06:34,828
Well, I'm a trained
professional, Bree.

1170
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:38,665
The human mind
is my playground.

1171
01:06:38,707 --> 01:06:41,043
Well, I'm glad
that you're having fun.

1172
01:06:41,043 --> 01:06:43,045
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to be flip.

1173
01:06:43,045 --> 01:06:46,882
But you came here
because you were troubled,

1174
01:06:46,882 --> 01:06:50,511
and then you refuse
any help we give you.

1175
01:06:50,552 --> 01:06:53,806
Things were falling apart
at home, and I just...

1176
01:06:53,847 --> 01:06:57,434
I just needed a place
to rest, that's all.

1177
01:06:57,476 --> 01:07:00,145
I think there's more to it
than that.

1178
01:07:00,145 --> 01:07:01,146
Do you?

1179
01:07:01,146 --> 01:07:03,482
I think it has to do
with your kids.

1180
01:07:03,482 --> 01:07:06,693
You don't want to talk
about them.

1181
01:07:06,735 --> 01:07:08,195
Why is that?

1182
01:07:08,237 --> 01:07:12,574
Probably because
I'm ashamed.

1183
01:07:12,616 --> 01:07:14,576
Ashamed?

1184
01:07:14,576 --> 01:07:16,578
My children were my life.

1185
01:07:16,578 --> 01:07:19,164
They were the reason that
I got up in the morning,

1186
01:07:19,206 --> 01:07:21,166
So to have failed them
as a parent...

1187
01:07:21,208 --> 01:07:22,918
You think you failed them
as a parent?

1188
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:24,378
Well, my son is a sociopath,

1189
01:07:24,419 --> 01:07:27,381
and my daughter hates me enough
to have run away from home.

1190
01:07:27,381 --> 01:07:29,132
I'm certainly not gonna get

1191
01:07:29,174 --> 01:07:32,427
"Mother of the Year" anytime soon.
- If your kids were here right now,

1192
01:07:32,469 --> 01:07:35,430
what would you tell them?
- I would beg my son Andrew
for forgiveness

1193
01:07:35,472 --> 01:07:37,432
for having given up on him,

1194
01:07:37,474 --> 01:07:39,935
and I would tell my daughter
not to worry,

1195
01:07:39,977 --> 01:07:41,979
that I have a plan
to protect her.

1196
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:45,649
And just what is that plan?

1197
01:08:26,398 --> 01:08:28,358
I've got everything
ready to go--

1198
01:08:28,358 --> 01:08:30,861
flowers, candles,
Elvis Costello CD all cued up.

1199
01:08:30,861 --> 01:08:32,362
But who has the ring?
- He does.

1200
01:08:32,362 --> 01:08:34,490
So, wait, you're gonna get
down on one knee,

1201
01:08:34,531 --> 01:08:36,658
pop the question,
and while you're down there,

1202
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:38,660
dig in his pocket?

1203
01:08:38,702 --> 01:08:41,622
Then I'm gonna have to find
a way to force it on my finger.

1204
01:08:41,622 --> 01:08:43,832
<i> Oh, Xiao-mei, where'd</i>
<i>you learn to kiss like that?</i></i>

1205
01:08:43,874 --> 01:08:45,792
Sorry,
that's Penny's baby monitor.

1206
01:08:45,834 --> 01:08:48,462
It's always picking up weird frequencies.
- No, no, no! Don't turn it off.

1207
01:08:48,462 --> 01:08:52,674
<i>Ohh! move over.</i>
<i>My knees hit the dashboard.</i></i>

1208
01:08:52,883 --> 01:08:56,762
<i> </i>
<i>I move seat back. Better?</i></i>

1209
01:08:57,012 --> 01:08:59,097
<i>Oh, yeah.</i></i>

1210
01:09:38,345 --> 01:09:40,848
Are you done
with my husband?

1211
01:09:43,142 --> 01:09:44,643
Good.

1212
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:50,983
I have a little project
for you.

1213
01:09:51,024 --> 01:09:53,777
Okay, Gaby, can we please
talk about this?!

1214
01:09:53,777 --> 01:09:56,738
You're the one that gave me
permission, remember?

1215
01:09:56,780 --> 01:09:58,574
You said, "Go have sex with somebody"!

1216
01:09:58,574 --> 01:10:00,284
To have meaningless sex,
Carlos,

1217
01:10:00,325 --> 01:10:02,786
not to sleep with the woman
who's carrying our child!

1218
01:10:02,828 --> 01:10:05,122
What is the matter?!
Look, we're even!

1219
01:10:05,164 --> 01:10:07,416
You had an affair,
and I had an affair!

1220
01:10:07,457 --> 01:10:09,918
I had a reason to.
You were never here!

1221
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:11,461
I've been here, Carlos.

1222
01:10:11,503 --> 01:10:14,381
I have tried so hard
to not be selfish

1223
01:10:14,423 --> 01:10:16,383
and to put your needs
above mine.

1224
01:10:16,425 --> 01:10:18,343
I mean, for God sakes,
look at me!

1225
01:10:18,385 --> 01:10:20,804
I have agreed to be
a mother for you!

1226
01:10:20,846 --> 01:10:23,307
Look, Gaby, you have
every right to be mad at me.

1227
01:10:23,348 --> 01:10:26,185
So I'm gonna go
and check into a hotel room

1228
01:10:26,226 --> 01:10:29,146
and let you cool down, but we
<i>are</i> going to work this out.</i>

1229
01:10:29,188 --> 01:10:31,690
Forget the hotel, Carlos.
Get a lease.

1230
01:10:40,574 --> 01:10:42,493
I can go now, too?

1231
01:10:42,534 --> 01:10:45,078
No, you can start dinner.

1232
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:46,163
What?!

1233
01:10:46,205 --> 01:10:49,541
You're not going anywhere,

1234
01:10:49,541 --> 01:10:52,711
not as long as you have
my baby in your belly.

1235
01:10:59,635 --> 01:11:02,596
I don't know what that meant,
but I didn't like the tone.

1236
01:11:02,638 --> 01:11:05,098
So just remember,
am the boss of you,

1237
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:07,100
or else
I'm gonna make this

1238
01:11:07,142 --> 01:11:09,812
the worst nine months
of your life.

1239
01:11:16,902 --> 01:11:18,529
Hi.
- Hi.

1240
01:11:18,570 --> 01:11:20,823
Did you get the check?

1241
01:11:20,864 --> 01:11:23,325
Yeah, I wanted to talk
to you about that.

1242
01:11:23,367 --> 01:11:25,369
Do you have a minute?

1243
01:11:25,410 --> 01:11:27,371
Tom?!

1244
01:11:27,412 --> 01:11:29,373
I'm not the type of person

1245
01:11:29,414 --> 01:11:33,043
that can keep things
bottled up inside.

1246
01:11:33,085 --> 01:11:36,672
Really?
- So I'm just gonna have
to get this off my chest.

1247
01:11:36,713 --> 01:11:39,174
You made me feel really bad
about myself

1248
01:11:39,174 --> 01:11:41,468
yesterday at the restaurant.

1249
01:11:41,510 --> 01:11:44,513
My sincerest apologies.

1250
01:11:44,555 --> 01:11:47,015
You treated me
like some sort of mercenary,

1251
01:11:47,057 --> 01:11:49,017
like the only reason
I came here

1252
01:11:49,059 --> 01:11:50,686
was to extort money from you.

1253
01:11:50,727 --> 01:11:53,147
Well, to be honest,
first, we bought you pie,

1254
01:11:53,188 --> 01:11:55,357
then you tried
to extort money from us.

1255
01:11:55,399 --> 01:11:59,778
See? There it is again,
Lynette--that mean streak.

1256
01:11:59,778 --> 01:12:01,989
All I want is what's best for my child,

1257
01:12:02,030 --> 01:12:04,241
for Tom's child.

1258
01:12:04,241 --> 01:12:06,743
As the mother of 80%
of Tom's children,

1259
01:12:06,743 --> 01:12:09,246
I don't think
it's in their best interest

1260
01:12:09,246 --> 01:12:12,040
for you to drive us
into bankruptcy.
- Of course it isn't.

1261
01:12:15,043 --> 01:12:16,712
Here.

1262
01:12:16,753 --> 01:12:18,338
I signed the waiver

1263
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:21,008
that the lawyer sent over
with the check.

1264
01:12:23,051 --> 01:12:27,264
And I'm not even asking
for any back child support.

1265
01:12:27,306 --> 01:12:29,475
That's--that's--that's great.
Thank you.

1266
01:12:29,516 --> 01:12:32,644
See, Lynette? See?
It's not all about money.

1267
01:12:32,686 --> 01:12:36,273
It's not even a little bit
about money. It's about family.

1268
01:12:36,315 --> 01:12:39,443
'cause we're all
a big family now.

1269
01:12:39,485 --> 01:12:41,820
Sort of.

1270
01:12:41,862 --> 01:12:45,073
Which is why I took
all the money that you gave me,

1271
01:12:45,115 --> 01:12:47,075
and I put it all down

1272
01:12:47,117 --> 01:12:49,578
on the sweetest little
2-bedroom house

1273
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:53,457
over on Arden Drive.

1274
01:12:53,499 --> 01:12:55,459
Ar-Arden Drive over--
over by the mall?

1275
01:12:55,501 --> 01:12:58,712
Like, five minutes
from here Arden Drive?

1276
01:13:00,589 --> 01:13:03,050
It's perfect. I could drop
Kayla off here anytime

1277
01:13:03,091 --> 01:13:05,427
so she can play
with her new siblings.

1278
01:13:05,469 --> 01:13:07,346
She can spend time
with her Dad.

1279
01:13:07,387 --> 01:13:11,308
Well, to be clear,
how are you going to live?

1280
01:13:11,308 --> 01:13:13,644
How are you going to pay
the mortgage?

1281
01:13:13,644 --> 01:13:16,855
You don't have a job here.
- What is your problem
with me, lady?!

1282
01:13:16,897 --> 01:13:19,608
I don't understand!
You don't know me.

1283
01:13:19,608 --> 01:13:21,360
You don't know what I can do.

1284
01:13:21,401 --> 01:13:24,112
And yet you just always,
just...

1285
01:13:24,154 --> 01:13:26,949
just--just...

1286
01:13:26,990 --> 01:13:30,410
Always on the attack. It's ugly,
and you should work on that.

1287
01:13:32,704 --> 01:13:34,706
Here's what I think.

1288
01:13:34,706 --> 01:13:36,625
I think that we should
all work on this,

1289
01:13:36,667 --> 01:13:39,628
because I don't want
every Christmas to turn ugly

1290
01:13:39,670 --> 01:13:42,631
just because you and I
don't get along.

1291
01:13:42,673 --> 01:13:46,343
Yeah, that would be a shame.

1292
01:14:35,642 --> 01:14:37,644
See, I told you
she wasn't home.

1293
01:14:37,644 --> 01:14:40,272
Her car's not even here.

1294
01:14:40,314 --> 01:14:42,816
And you said the safe
was upstairs?

1295
01:14:49,573 --> 01:14:53,035
Damn it, my mother must have
changed the combination.

1296
01:14:54,912 --> 01:14:59,374
Okay. Wait here.
I'll be right back.

1297
01:15:12,221 --> 01:15:14,723
You did it.

1298
01:15:20,437 --> 01:15:22,105
You killed Melanie.

1299
01:15:22,147 --> 01:15:24,775
You put your jacket
on her body.

1300
01:15:24,817 --> 01:15:28,570
I saw it, Matthew.

1301
01:15:28,612 --> 01:15:31,240
The police showed me
the pictures.

1302
01:15:31,281 --> 01:15:33,909
Now you weren't there.
You don't know what happened.

1303
01:15:33,951 --> 01:15:35,118
Oh, God.

1304
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:37,412
Caleb hurt her,

1305
01:15:37,412 --> 01:15:40,249
and Melanie threatened to bring
us all down because of that.

1306
01:15:40,290 --> 01:15:42,626
So your solution was to make
your brother think

1307
01:15:42,668 --> 01:15:45,045
he murdered a girl
and to make <i>me</i> think it?</i>

1308
01:15:45,087 --> 01:15:46,630
What other choice did I have?

1309
01:15:46,672 --> 01:15:49,383
I knew that you wouldn't
had Caleb over to the police.

1310
01:15:49,424 --> 01:15:51,385
I knew that
you would protect him.

1311
01:15:51,426 --> 01:15:52,928
I would have protected you.

1312
01:15:52,970 --> 01:15:54,847
Well, I really couldn't
count on that.

1313
01:15:54,847 --> 01:15:56,306
Matthew...

1314
01:15:56,306 --> 01:15:59,685
you don't love me
as much as you love Caleb.

1315
01:15:59,726 --> 01:16:01,228
You never have.

1316
01:16:03,564 --> 01:16:05,524
Perhaps.

1317
01:16:05,566 --> 01:16:08,318
But it's because
he's needed me more.

1318
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:11,488
You are always going to
find love in the world.

1319
01:16:11,530 --> 01:16:13,282
Don't you understand?

1320
01:16:13,323 --> 01:16:16,743
He was only ever
going to get it from me.

1321
01:16:16,743 --> 01:16:19,121
You know,
I know you believe that.

1322
01:16:21,582 --> 01:16:24,042
That's why I've tried
so hard to forgive you.

1323
01:16:25,919 --> 01:16:27,379
And who knows?

1324
01:16:27,421 --> 01:16:31,258
Maybe one day I will.

1325
01:16:46,398 --> 01:16:49,610
9-1-1.
- What is your emergency?

1326
01:16:49,651 --> 01:16:52,279
I need the police.

1327
01:16:58,410 --> 01:17:00,579
See, I told you
she had cash.

1328
01:17:22,768 --> 01:17:25,229
Danielle, I don't know
what you're planning,

1329
01:17:25,270 --> 01:17:28,148
but I need to talk to you
right now.

1330
01:17:28,190 --> 01:17:30,108
Give it up, Mom.
We're leaving.

1331
01:17:30,108 --> 01:17:31,735
I'm calling the police.

1332
01:17:36,615 --> 01:17:39,451
Do you remember
that girl Melanie Foster?

1333
01:17:39,493 --> 01:17:43,288
Matthew is the one
who killed her.

1334
01:17:43,330 --> 01:17:45,791
I know you don't want us
to be together,

1335
01:17:45,833 --> 01:17:49,086
but that's the lamest thing
I've ever heard.

1336
01:17:49,127 --> 01:17:51,839
His mother told me
what happened. It's true.

1337
01:17:56,260 --> 01:17:57,928
Let's go, Danielle.

1338
01:18:06,979 --> 01:18:08,856
Mom, please move.

1339
01:18:08,897 --> 01:18:10,858
No.
I gave up on your brother,

1340
01:18:10,899 --> 01:18:13,694
and I'm not gonna make
that mistake with you.

1341
01:18:13,735 --> 01:18:17,114
We don't have time for this.

1342
01:18:17,156 --> 01:18:20,868
Where did you get that?
What are you doing?!

1343
01:18:20,909 --> 01:18:22,369
Move away!

1344
01:18:22,411 --> 01:18:23,996
Danielle...

1345
01:18:25,706 --> 01:18:28,125
I want you to get out
of the house now.

1346
01:18:28,167 --> 01:18:30,127
He's a killer.
- Shut up!

1347
01:18:30,169 --> 01:18:31,753
Don't point that
at my mother!

1348
01:18:31,795 --> 01:18:33,380
Danielle!

1349
01:18:33,422 --> 01:18:35,007
I'm serious. Go.

1350
01:18:35,048 --> 01:18:36,508
What's wrong with you?!

1351
01:18:36,508 --> 01:18:38,177
I'm gonna shoot you!

1352
01:18:38,218 --> 01:18:40,971
Matthew, stop it!

1353
01:18:46,393 --> 01:18:49,104
If that's what it takes...

1354
01:18:51,148 --> 01:18:52,608
to get my daughter...

1355
01:18:52,649 --> 01:18:55,652
Stop it!
- To see who you really are...

1356
01:18:55,694 --> 01:18:58,322
Stop pointing that
at my mother!

1357
01:18:58,363 --> 01:18:59,615
Then fine.

1358
01:19:01,408 --> 01:19:04,328
What are you doing?!
Do it.

1359
01:19:04,369 --> 01:19:06,079
Stop!

1360
01:19:44,117 --> 01:19:45,828
It's okay, baby.

1361
01:20:50,559 --> 01:20:53,395
Hey, it's just me again.
Um...

1362
01:20:53,437 --> 01:20:55,397
When you got the invitation,

1363
01:20:55,439 --> 01:20:57,900
I thought that you gave me
the thumbs up,

1364
01:20:57,941 --> 01:21:01,570
but I guess
if that was actually...

1365
01:21:01,612 --> 01:21:05,240
some other type
of finger gesture, uh...

1366
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:08,744
well, I apologize for leaving
you all these messages

1367
01:21:08,744 --> 01:21:12,164
and wasting your time.

1368
01:21:55,374 --> 01:21:58,585
<i>This is the street</i>
<i>where I used to live...</i></i>

1369
01:22:00,087 --> 01:22:05,384
<i>and these were the people</i>
<i>with whom I shared my life.</i></i>

1370
01:22:05,425 --> 01:22:08,428
<i>I met them the day</i>
<i>they moved in.</i></i>

1371
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:15,018
<i>And I saw</i>
<i>what they brought with them...</i></i>

1372
01:22:18,147 --> 01:22:21,984
<i>beautiful dreams</i>
<i>for the future.</i></i>

1373
01:22:22,025 --> 01:22:26,780
<i>And quiet hopes</i>
<i>for a better life...</i></i>

1374
01:22:29,241 --> 01:22:34,413
<i>not just for themselves,</i>
<i>but for their children, too.</i></i>

1375
01:22:36,039 --> 01:22:40,711
<i>If I could, would I tell them</i>
<i>what lies ahead?</i></i>

1376
01:22:40,711 --> 01:22:43,672
<i>Would I warn them
of the sorrow and betrayal</i>

1377
01:22:43,714 --> 01:22:47,176
<i>that lie in store?</i></i>

1378
01:22:47,217 --> 01:22:50,596
<i>No. From where I stand now,</i></i>

1379
01:22:50,637 --> 01:22:53,098
<i>I see enough of the road</i>
<i>to understand</i></i>

1380
01:22:53,140 --> 01:22:57,144
<i>how it must be traveled.</i></i>

1381
01:22:57,144 --> 01:23:01,148
<i>The trip</i>
<i>is to keep moving forward,</i></i>

1382
01:23:01,190 --> 01:23:03,692
<i>to let go of the fear</i>
<i>and the regret</i></i>

1383
01:23:03,734 --> 01:23:05,360
<i>that slow us down</i></i>

1384
01:23:05,402 --> 01:23:07,821
<i>and keep us from enjoying</i>
<i>a journey</i></i>

1385
01:23:07,863 --> 01:23:10,741
<i>that will be over too soon.</i></i>

1386
01:23:12,743 --> 01:23:18,081
<i>Yes, there will be</i>
<i>unexpected bends in the road,</i></i>

1387
01:23:18,123 --> 01:23:22,753
<i>shocking surprises</i>
<i>we didn't see coming,</i></i>

1388
01:23:22,794 --> 01:23:25,714
<i>but that's really the point...</i></i>

1389
01:23:25,756 --> 01:23:27,216
<i>don't ya think?</i></i>

1390
01:23:27,257 --> 01:23:29,009
Orson.
- Oh, hey.

1391
01:23:29,051 --> 01:23:31,512
I wanted to come by
and see how you were doing

1392
01:23:31,553 --> 01:23:34,556
after your great escape,
and, uh, these are for you.

1393
01:23:34,598 --> 01:23:39,144
How sweet
and... unexpected.

1394
01:23:42,898 --> 01:23:44,942
Do you wanna come in?

1395
01:23:44,942 --> 01:23:47,277
I'd love to.

1396
01:24:00,541 --> 01:24:03,502
