<i>Previously on Desperate Housewives:</i></i>

3
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:06,757
My husband died thinking that I murdered him!

4
00:00:06,757 --> 00:00:09,635
<i>Bree put the past behind her,</i></i>

5
00:00:09,635 --> 00:00:11,553
If you keep me on as your lawyer, your wife's off limits.

6
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:12,763
He's my lawyer.

7
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:14,932
<i>while Carlos gambled with his future,</i></i>

8
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:16,934
How much money do you think you need to get to Utah?

9
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:21,980
<i>Susan interfered with a family reunion.</i></i>

10
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:27,236
<i>George Williams had never been lucky in love.</i></i>

11
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:30,531
<i>It seemed that the women he dated always invented reasons</i></i>

12
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:34,868
<i>not to consummate their relationship.</i></i>

13
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,161
Um...

14
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:41,166
I'm afraid we'd wake my roommate.

15
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:46,463
Uh, I have to get up really early for work.

16
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:53,637
I'm, uh -- saving myself -- for -- marriage.

17
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:59,268
<i>Sadly for George, it was one unoriginal excuse after another.</i></i>

18
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:07,150
<i>But since he'd started seeing Bree Van De Kamp,</i></i>

19
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,736
<i>George couldn't help but feel:</i></i>

20
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:10,779
Hi!

21
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:14,032
Kids are gone. We have the house all to ourselves tonight.

22
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:19,037
<i>His luck was about to change.</i></i>

23
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,831
I thought the duck turned out well.

24
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:22,791
Although that sauce was a little bit thick;

25
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:27,713
but judging by how many helpings you had, I think I got away with it.

26
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,845
What are you thinking about?

27
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:39,183
Your hair.

28
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:41,351
Would you mind if I --?

29
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,352
Uh, no.

30
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:47,316
Go ahead.

31
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:56,033
That better?

32
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:11,048
That was nice.

33
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,637
It's OK that I'm doing this, right?

34
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,639
Well, I thought we were going to let the duck digest a bit more,

35
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:23,644
but -- what the heck!

36
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,854
Oh!
- What's wrong?

37
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,147
I don't know. I felt something weird.

38
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:27,731
Och.

39
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:30,651
That was my tongue. It extends farther than most. I should have warned you.

40
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:35,656
No, it wasn't your kiss. I felt something weird on my neck.

41
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,036
What are you doing?

42
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:46,041
I don't know, I'm just really starting to itch.

43
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,336
What is it?

44
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:54,383
You -- you got a huge rash!

45
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:01,557
It's starting to spread to my face!

46
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:03,642
Are you allergic to something you ate?

47
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:06,937
I don't think so. I made Duck Ã  l'Orange a thousand times.

48
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:11,066
Something is causing that rash.

49
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,776
Bree. Bree, please don't.

50
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:14,653
I'm sorry, George, but you have to go.

51
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:15,988
But the kids are away!

52
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:18,115
I was sort of hoping we could make love tonight.

53
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:23,161
How are we going to do that, George? You have just given me hives!

54
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:27,749
<i>Though painful to hear, George had to admit:</i></i>

55
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:31,837
<i>At least this excuse was original.</i></i>

56
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:36,842
<i>season 2 episode 6
"I Wish I Could Forget You"</i></i>

57
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:18,759
<i>It's a fad that little girls dream of big white weddings.</i></i>

58
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:25,432
<i>Of course, the exact same thing can be said for big girls,</i></i>

59
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:30,354
<i>some of whom can get incredibly anxious</i></i>

60
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:35,317
<i>waiting for the boys in their lives
to make those dreams come true.</i></i>

61
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:38,362
Watch it, Suzie!

62
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:40,781
Mom, why don't you just go see a dressmaker?

63
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:43,158
Wait. I have the perfect idea.

64
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:44,535
You get in the dress,

65
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:46,662
and I'll pin it.

66
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:48,038
We wear the same size.

67
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,039
Since when?

68
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,458
Since forever!

69
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,669
You have to leave, though. You can't stay.

70
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:56,380
You can't see Suzie in a wedding dress.

71
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,549
Not until your big day!

72
00:04:58,549 --> 00:04:59,258
Mom!

73
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:01,260
No, it's not a problem.

74
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,345
I can see her in it.

75
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:04,388
You can?

76
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:05,347
You can?

77
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:09,059
I assume you want to pick out your own wedding dress when we get married, right?

78
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:12,771
Oh! That sounds like a proposal!

79
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,147
Did it?

80
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,983
Yeah, it did.

81
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:17,067
Huh, what do you know.

82
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:21,071
Are you planning to pop the question?

83
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:24,449
If she knows it's coming, the question won't really pop, will it?

84
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,742
He's right, Mom.

85
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,244
No, I want to do it just like you do.

86
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:30,664
You know, on your own terms, and you get down on one knee, and the whole production.

87
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:31,748
That's a plan.

88
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:35,043
Well, then I can wait. I can wait. I'm a good waiter.

89
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,545
Good.

90
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:37,045
Just wondering --

91
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,631
if there's a ballpark of how long I will have to wait.

92
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:41,466
A week? A month? After lunch?

93
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,844
Again, you're not waiting for the pop.

94
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,763
Right. I'm sorry.

95
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,932
Get down on one knee!

96
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:51,727
Mom.

97
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:55,189
So the hives occurred right after you kissed George?

98
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:58,358
Yes, it was the strangest thing.

99
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,236
And so inconvenient.

100
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:04,948
To be honest, I think we were -- about to make love for the first time.

101
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,533
Bree, have you considered the idea

102
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:11,580
that your subconscious mind was trying to sabotage your evening with George?

103
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,791
Actually, I have not considered that, because that's --

104
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,043
idiotic.

105
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:19,254
You don't think being with George made you feel a bit guilty?

106
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:20,631
Why should I feel guilty?

107
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:23,342
Perhaps you felt you were about to commit adultery.

108
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:25,552
Dr Goldfine, Rex is dead.

109
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:30,432
You can't cheat on a corpse.

110
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:33,352
Maybe that's not how you really feel deep down.

111
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:35,729
Oh, so you think I'm crazy?

112
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,524
You say you got a case of hives for no reason.

113
00:06:38,524 --> 00:06:42,528
I think there is a reason, and it's probably a psychosomatic one.

114
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:43,654
You can think whatever you want,

115
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:46,782
but to be honest, I don't believe in the subconscious.

116
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:49,243
Everytime you've said "Rex" in this session,

117
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:51,578
you stroked the placed where your wedding ring used to be.

118
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:56,542
Why did you do that?

119
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,837
Let's talk about Monday.

120
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:01,964
We are re-pitching to the Kamaroff people.

121
00:07:01,964 --> 00:07:03,340
Lynette, you'll be on point.

122
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,259
Great. No problem.

123
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:10,264
And can you do me a favor and maybe not wear the green suit?

124
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,391
Umm --

125
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:16,854
I -- wasn't planning to, but -- why?

126
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:17,563
The fabric.

127
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:19,982
It just has this quality to it,

128
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:24,945
like you could -- I don't know -- wipe it clean with a damp cloth.

129
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,866
I'll just wear a different suit then.

130
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:29,992
Great.

131
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:31,743
Like what, you think?

132
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:34,454
Another suit. I have other suits.

133
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,833
And if by other suits you mean the grey one,

134
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:40,043
then of course you do.

135
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:43,714
No, actually I have quite a few others, uh --

136
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:47,467
the blue one, and, uh --

137
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,052
What's wrong with the blue suit?

138
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:50,470
Stu!

139
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:55,434
Would you like to tell Lynette what's wrong with the blue suit?

140
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:56,643
No. It's cool.

141
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,563
Stu! Come on.

142
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:03,233
Do the thing. The thing that you did at lunch.

143
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,235
"Look at me, I'm Lynette!"

144
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:08,780
"Oh, got food stains everywhere!"

145
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,323
All right.

146
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:13,952
So if I get my blue suit dry-cleaned, would that be acceptable to everyone?

147
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:18,916
The pants also have a split seam in the back.

148
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:26,757
Excuse me.

149
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:29,635
Hello David.

150
00:08:29,635 --> 00:08:32,513
What the hell is this? I thought I told you to dress maternal.

151
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:35,265
Yes you did, and I considered it for about a second.

152
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:36,433
What happened?

153
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,769
David, I know you're the lawyer and all, but if you ask me:

154
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:41,438
It's never a smart strategy to cover this up.

155
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:43,857
We've got 40 minutes before the pre-trial hearing.

156
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:44,942
Let's go home and get you changed.

157
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:46,235
What?

158
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:47,986
You want to get your husband out fo jail?

159
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:51,240
Got to dress like a pregnant, suffering wife, not the cover of Vogue.

160
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:51,990
David.

161
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,742
Louis. What are you doing here?

162
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:55,327
I need a favor, David.

163
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:58,664
If this has to do with lifting my client's restraining order, the answer's the same as last week.

164
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:01,750
You don't understand. I'd love Crystal.

165
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,044
We all love the pretty ladies to stop and shop,

166
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,922
but now you've got to love her from 50 yards away.

167
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:08,757
You turned her against me!

168
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,259
If it wasn't for you, we'd be together.

169
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:13,178
Louis, Crystal hired me to keep you away from her.

170
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:14,471
She doesn't want to see you.

171
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:17,057
Oh yeah? Then why did she ask for my phone number?

172
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:20,853
She's a cashier. You paid by check. It doesn't make you special.

173
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:23,313
Don't walk away from me! We're having a conversation!

174
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:25,732
Louis, this is your problem:

175
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,318
You're creepy. Nobody likes you.

176
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:31,321
What you call a conversation, the rest of us call harassment.

177
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:36,326
You want a friend? Get a hamster.

178
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:41,331
David!

179
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:43,584
He's got a weapon!

180
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:44,543
Call the police!

181
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:49,590
Stay there!

182
00:09:57,848 --> 00:09:59,641
That's right, you'd better run!

183
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:02,186
I'm going to get some b*** come after you!

184
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:03,562
Freeze!

185
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:08,525
Hey. Everything's cool.

186
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:17,159
Are you OK?

187
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:26,752
<i>Weeds are a common annoyance of life in Suburbia;</i></i>

188
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:31,423
<i>and no matter how hard we try to get rid of them,</i></i>

189
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:36,470
<i>they always tend to crop back up.</i></i>

190
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,848
Are you seeing this?!

191
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:42,559
I don't believe him! He is so brazen!

192
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,687
Just mowing the lawn, like nothing ever happened!

193
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:47,940
What should we do? Should we call the police?

194
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:52,152
Well, Susan did say that he murdered Mrs Huber. So my vote would be, yes.

195
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:57,157
Oh my God, Susan's home.

196
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:06,166
Has she seen Paul yet?

197
00:11:09,545 --> 00:11:14,550
I think so.

198
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:21,139
Hello Susan.

199
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:23,559
Oh my God. Paul.

200
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:26,562
Need some help with those bags?

201
00:11:26,562 --> 00:11:29,815
Why -- what are you doing here?

202
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:31,358
This is where I live.

203
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:35,153
I came home to find my son.

204
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:35,946
Here you go.

205
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:37,281
Don't come near me!

206
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:38,615
I'm just giving you back your pie filling.

207
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:39,825
I don't want my pie filling!

208
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:41,034
Oh come on, just take it.

209
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,619
No! Stop!

210
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:44,872
Put that pie filling down!

211
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:47,166
Slowly!

212
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,167
I'm calling 911.

213
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:49,168
You don't want to do that.

214
00:11:49,168 --> 00:11:52,171
Oh, I think I do. You're a cold-blooded murderer.

215
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:57,134
Susan, how can you believe that? We've been neighbors for years.

216
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,220
Ladies, good to see you.

217
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,472
Paul, we've called the police.

218
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,057
You didn't really need to do that.

219
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:06,643
We know what you did to Mrs Huber.

220
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:07,853
Wonderful.

221
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:12,858
I see you've all turned into Susan while I've been gone.

222
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:18,614
Oh, thank God they're here.

223
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:23,452
What's going on?

224
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:27,539
Meyer's convinced that Paul Young murdered Martha Huber.

225
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:28,874
I live right behind him!

226
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:33,253
I know. I gave him my house keys to feed my cat!

227
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:37,257
I win. I made out with him.

228
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,217
Here, mister.

229
00:12:38,217 --> 00:12:40,344
There's no warrant here for Paul Young.

230
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:43,013
Why don't you ask Mike? He overheard everything, right?

231
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:43,847
Who's Mike?

232
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:47,267
He's my boyfriend. He told me that Paul confessed everything to him.

233
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:51,355
And Mike has Martha's journals, which clearly prove that Paul had a motive.

234
00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:53,148
Where do I find this Mike guy?

235
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:54,942
He's -- follow me.

236
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:58,570
Do you mind if I stay here? I've got a lot of raking to do.

237
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:03,534
Let's go.

238
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:11,959
Hey.

239
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:12,876
What's going on?

240
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:14,086
Mike --

241
00:13:14,086 --> 00:13:15,754
Paul Young is back.

242
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:20,759
Look.

243
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:30,644
Your girlfriend said Mr Young confessed a murder to you?

244
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:34,064
Um --

245
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:36,650
No. Not to me.

246
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:40,863
And I don't suppose you have a journal that belonged to a Martha Huber?

247
00:13:40,863 --> 00:13:43,448
No. I hardly knew her.

248
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:46,618
Besides, have you ever known a woman who'd loan out her diary?

249
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:48,370
Mike, what are you doing?

250
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:52,457
I'm sorry, Susan, I don't know what you're talking about.

251
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,334
But I've got a job to get to. Is there anything else?

252
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:59,339
No, that pretty much covers it.

253
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:15,772
Well, someone might as well say it.

254
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:20,736
Susan, what the hell have you been smoking?

255
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:27,367
OK.

256
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:32,164
Wow! Nice!

257
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:33,373
Oh my God.

258
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,542
<i>Don't be distracted by that. Look at me.</i></i>

259
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:39,421
Here I am (tomorrow), making my presentation.

260
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:40,547
You see?

261
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:43,050
You see how it moves with me?

262
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,260
That's where the magic is!

263
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,679
Nine -- hundred -- dollars.

264
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:50,891
Well, this one was the most expensive. The other one's aren't as nice.

265
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:51,433
But look!

266
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:53,852
Look at me! Watch.

267
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:58,857
I don't walk in it. I glide.

268
00:14:59,358 --> 00:15:03,445
Honey, there's got to be like $3,000 worth of clothes here!

269
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:06,073
Well, I haven't bought a new suit in six years.

270
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:06,949
So?

271
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:10,160
When I was working, you don't think I would have loved to have a designer suit?

272
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,453
I wore Wash'n'Wear.

273
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:12,871
So that we can live in a nice neighborhood.

274
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:14,957
So we could take the kids on vacation every summer.

275
00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:17,042
I mean, I made sacrifices.

276
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:19,169
I'm willing to make sacrifices.

277
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:22,172
Great. Let's start here. Because --

278
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:24,091
this should cover a math tutor for Parker.

279
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:25,551
Whoa, hold on a sec.

280
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:28,053
Six months of pre-school for Penny.

281
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:29,346
Now you're being ridiculous.

282
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:31,557
And the twins, they're going to need braces.

283
00:15:31,557 --> 00:15:33,767
That ought to make a dent.

284
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:38,355
Oh, no. Come on, Tom, not this one.

285
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:40,148
Strip.

286
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:42,067
You saw the walk, right?

287
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:45,362
You want to see the walk again?

288
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:47,739
I'll tutor Parker myself!

289
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:52,744
That'd be great. Are you also going to take up on dentistry?

290
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:05,966
Fine, I'll take them back.

291
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:10,137
Could you step out for a minute, please?

292
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:15,142
I want to be alone with it for a little while.

293
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:32,492
Hi, it's Bree!

294
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:33,952
Hi.

295
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:35,037
I was thinking about calling you.

296
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:40,083
I just got some new antihistamines in at the store, I think they will help with your rash.

297
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:41,543
Well, great. Um --

298
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:46,548
How would you think about the two of us checking in to a romantic hotel tomorrow?

299
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:48,467
What? Uh --

300
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:50,135
I'd like that very much.

301
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:51,970
I will let you make all the arrangements.

302
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:55,349
Something out of town would be nice.

303
00:16:55,349 --> 00:17:00,354
Good night!

304
00:17:12,241 --> 00:17:13,825
We need to talk.

305
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:15,452
Where did you come from?

306
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:16,453
I'm sorry, I've been waiting for you.

307
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:19,289
I'm just a little upset, because everybody thinks I'm crazy.

308
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:21,416
Can I at least get out of the truck first?

309
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:22,876
Yes.

310
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:26,630
I can understand why you wouldn't want the cops to know that you kidnapped Paul.

311
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,423
That definitely looks bad.

312
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:30,759
Since I was on probation --

313
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:32,886
Right, there's that.

314
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:35,430
and in possession of a gun --
- Well, OK.

315
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,057
which I held to his head.

316
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:41,770
So I violated my probation, committed a felony, and coerced a confession.

317
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:46,733
If the cops found out about that, I'd be looking at 10-15 years.

318
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:49,736
But why don't you want them to know about Martha Huber's journal?

319
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:53,365
She says right in there that she was blackmailing Paul's wife!

320
00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:58,370
She also says right in there that she was blackmailing you, for burning down Edie's house.

321
00:17:58,871 --> 00:18:03,834
Oh. I forgot about that.

322
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:08,630
Just can't believe it!

323
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:11,967
There he is, a murderer, living right on our street.

324
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:13,260
And there's nothing we can do about it,

325
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,971
because you're a convicted felon, and I've burned down that stupid house.

326
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:16,972
It's not fair.

327
00:18:16,972 --> 00:18:19,558
I want Paul Young gone as badly as you do.

328
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:21,059
And he will be.

329
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:23,061
But I also want to find Zach.

330
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:28,066
Once Zach finds out Paul's here, I got the feeling he'll be back.

331
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:34,948
It's comforting to know there's this silver lining.

332
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:45,667
Hi.

333
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:46,752
What are you doing here?

334
00:18:46,752 --> 00:18:48,587
Well, you protected me from the hail of gunfire,

335
00:18:48,587 --> 00:18:53,050
so I thought I'd stop by and give you a card.

336
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,468
You're my first visitor.

337
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:56,762
What do you mean, I'm your first visitor? You've been here two days.

338
00:18:56,762 --> 00:19:01,767
My office sent me flowers.

339
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:03,560
Oh.

340
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:08,565
"Dear David. Who knew you could actually bleed? Sincerely, your stunned co-workers."

341
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:14,363
Well, I'm a lawyer who got shot. Everybody's cracking wise.

342
00:19:14,363 --> 00:19:16,490
You're not going to eat?

343
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:20,285
Uh -- can't really cut yet.

344
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:23,038
Well, I'm not going to let you starve to death.

345
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:28,085
Besides, you're going to need your strength to get my husband out of jail.

346
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:37,636
You know, when I was waiting for the ambulance the other day,

347
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:41,974
I felt like I was going to die.

348
00:19:41,974 --> 00:19:45,060
I was scared.

349
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:48,272
Of course you were.

350
00:19:48,272 --> 00:19:50,983
Thanks.

351
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:52,067
For what?

352
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:56,488
For not making any jokes.

353
00:19:56,488 --> 00:19:57,781
Sure.

354
00:19:57,781 --> 00:20:02,786
Now, open up.

355
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:09,751
Here.
- Thank you.

356
00:20:17,843 --> 00:20:22,890
Just follow this hallway, straight down there, and make yourselves comfortable.

357
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:27,853
<i>For the good of their family, Lynette had made a promise to her husband.</i></i>

358
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:34,359
<i>And within ten days from the date of purchase, she intended to keep it.</i></i>

359
00:20:42,784 --> 00:20:44,786
Oh! That's a fantastic suit.

360
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:46,163
Hm, thanks!

361
00:20:46,163 --> 00:20:47,372
I'm flattered, really.

362
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:50,501
I mean, who knew you cared so much about what I think.

363
00:20:50,501 --> 00:20:51,835
I don't follow you?

364
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:56,882
I make a few innocent comments, and you go out and buy yourself a gorgeous new suit.

365
00:20:57,633 --> 00:20:59,176
Dance, puppet, dance!

366
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:02,387
Well, actually, this was already in my closet. I just forgot about it.

367
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:03,555
Forgot?

368
00:21:03,555 --> 00:21:08,560
<i>You forgot that you had that suit?</i></i>

369
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,563
Good morning!
- Good morning.

370
00:21:11,563 --> 00:21:13,440
Hi! I'm Lynette Scavo.

371
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,278
Now, is everyone taken care of, in terms of coffee and whatever else they may like?

372
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:20,280
Great! Well, then let's get started.

373
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:25,285
I will show you how Kamaroff vodka can expand its customer mindshare

374
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:29,665
while still holding the line on marketing costs.

375
00:21:29,665 --> 00:21:34,628
It's something we here at Parcher & Murphy like to call "persuasive engineering".

376
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,047
Lynette.

377
00:21:37,047 --> 00:21:42,094
Hold on one second.

378
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:45,973
You have a --

379
00:21:45,973 --> 00:21:48,892
They put the price tags on the skirts these days too.

380
00:21:48,892 --> 00:21:51,645
Just so you know.

381
00:21:51,645 --> 00:21:52,896
Look at that, everybody.

382
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:56,900
Lynette just bought herself a beautiful, brand new suit.

383
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:01,864
Doesn't she look great?

384
00:22:02,573 --> 00:22:04,491
Go on.

385
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:07,369
OK.

386
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:10,873
You may be seated.

387
00:22:10,873 --> 00:22:14,668
Good to see you back on your feet, Mr Bradley.

388
00:22:14,668 --> 00:22:17,671
Whenever you're ready.

389
00:22:17,671 --> 00:22:21,049
Thank you, Your Honor.

390
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:26,096
The defence moves to dismiss this case immediately on the grounds that the defendant --

391
00:22:33,979 --> 00:22:38,984
Are you all right, Mr Bradley?

392
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:45,574
I'm sorry, Your Honor, I just can't.

393
00:22:47,284 --> 00:22:48,869
I just can't.

394
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:53,832
Mr Bradley, do you need a recess?

395
00:22:53,957 --> 00:22:57,044
What the hell's going on?

396
00:22:57,044 --> 00:22:58,629
David, where are you going?!

397
00:22:58,629 --> 00:23:00,088
I'm sorry. I quit.

398
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:01,840
You can't just quit in the middle of a hearing!

399
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,177
I'd love to get your idiot husband out of jail, but I just can't do it, sorry.

400
00:23:05,177 --> 00:23:06,637
Why not?

401
00:23:06,637 --> 00:23:08,180
Because I'm in love with you.

402
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,306
What?

403
00:23:09,306 --> 00:23:10,182
The other day in the hospital,

404
00:23:10,182 --> 00:23:14,645
I started to feel something that maybe was there all along.

405
00:23:14,645 --> 00:23:18,565
When I look into your eyes I know you feel it too.

406
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:22,069
We belong together.

407
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:27,032
David, if you don't get back in there right now, I will go get a gun and shoot you myself.

408
00:23:27,783 --> 00:23:29,827
I can't.

409
00:23:29,827 --> 00:23:34,873
I'm sorry.

410
00:23:41,672 --> 00:23:45,384
Come in!

411
00:23:45,384 --> 00:23:49,137
We need to talk.

412
00:23:49,137 --> 00:23:49,930
Paul!

413
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:52,266
You can't just walk into people's houses!

414
00:23:52,266 --> 00:23:54,184
Susan, you told me to come in.

415
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:56,854
That's 'cause I asssumed you were someone I would let into my house.

416
00:23:56,854 --> 00:23:57,938
What do you want?

417
00:23:57,938 --> 00:24:02,067
I was looking through my mail, and I found this.

418
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:06,280
I was surprised to discover that you were looking for my son.

419
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:09,867
You didn't happen to find anything out about where Zach might be, did you?

420
00:24:09,867 --> 00:24:12,870
No, I didn't.

421
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:15,080
Sorry I can't help you out.

422
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:20,085
I'm asking because, if you remember, Zach hid here in this house before.

423
00:24:20,085 --> 00:24:22,254
And now I learn that you'd been searching for him.

424
00:24:22,254 --> 00:24:24,590
Well, he's not here.

425
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:25,883
Hm.

426
00:24:25,883 --> 00:24:28,343
Or maybe we should doublecheck?

427
00:24:28,343 --> 00:24:31,680
He's not here! I swear!

428
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,975
What are you grabbing for?

429
00:24:34,975 --> 00:24:37,853
A knife.

430
00:24:37,853 --> 00:24:42,858
I just want to slice some tomatoes.

431
00:24:49,865 --> 00:24:54,745
I don't know how I know this, but I think that he's in Utah.

432
00:24:54,745 --> 00:24:59,791
He took a bus to Bountiful. You have family there, right?

433
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:06,590
OK, I gave him the bus fare.

434
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:20,062
You might want to be careful with that.

435
00:25:20,062 --> 00:25:25,067
You seem a little jittery.

436
00:25:30,656 --> 00:25:33,158
Look, I know the timing is bad.

437
00:25:33,158 --> 00:25:34,076
Pretty bad.

438
00:25:34,076 --> 00:25:35,661
I feel terrible!

439
00:25:35,661 --> 00:25:36,578
How was I supposed to know

440
00:25:36,578 --> 00:25:40,749
tat he would take the bullet, and suddenly realize he's in love with me?

441
00:25:40,749 --> 00:25:44,169
I know I pushed you into hiring that creep.

442
00:25:44,169 --> 00:25:48,674
But I promise I will do anything I can to fix this.

443
00:25:48,674 --> 00:25:51,802
All right, go have sex with Bradley.

444
00:25:51,802 --> 00:25:52,594
What?

445
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:54,680
That's what you want me to say, isn't it?

446
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,682
God, you guys are good.

447
00:25:56,682 --> 00:25:58,600
You set me up perfectly.

448
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,395
You think David and I planned this so we could sleep together?

449
00:26:01,395 --> 00:26:04,356
Let's see. The guy tells me to my face that he wants to get in your pants.

450
00:26:04,356 --> 00:26:05,649
That's a week before my trial.

451
00:26:05,649 --> 00:26:10,195
And now you can't wait to do anything to get him back?

452
00:26:10,195 --> 00:26:11,947
Yeah.

453
00:26:11,947 --> 00:26:13,866
I'd like to go back to jail now!

454
00:26:13,866 --> 00:26:15,450
How dare you think that of me?

455
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:18,996
I have been nothing but faithful to you!

456
00:26:18,996 --> 00:26:20,205
... since you've been in here.

457
00:26:20,205 --> 00:26:21,290
Save it.

458
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:22,457
I know when I've been outfoxed.

459
00:26:22,457 --> 00:26:25,544
And please don't pretend that you're doing this for me.

460
00:26:25,544 --> 00:26:26,879
'Cause I'd rather rot in here.

461
00:26:26,879 --> 00:26:29,256
And you know what, a lesser woman would let you rot in here.

462
00:26:29,256 --> 00:26:31,884
But I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to give you the satisfaction.

463
00:26:31,884 --> 00:26:35,262
So you better start packing up your shanks, or whatever you people make in here.

464
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:40,267
Because you're coming on with me!

465
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:48,483
I don't have any shanks.

466
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:50,736
Good afternoon.

467
00:26:50,736 --> 00:26:52,070
Checking in?
- Yes.

468
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:55,073
The reservation's in the name of Williams, George Williams.

469
00:26:55,073 --> 00:26:56,200
Let me get your paperwork.

470
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,868
So what do you want to do first?

471
00:26:57,868 --> 00:27:01,288
I don't know, I thought maybe we could go antiquing.

472
00:27:01,288 --> 00:27:05,083
I hear you have some lovely museums nearby. Do you have any brochures?

473
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:07,002
Right over there, Mrs Williams.

474
00:27:07,002 --> 00:27:09,087
Oh, uh -- she's not my wife.

475
00:27:09,087 --> 00:27:14,051
I'm so sorry.

476
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:20,974
So I hear they have that terrific farmers' market nearby. We should pick up some nectarines.

477
00:27:21,808 --> 00:27:23,685
George --

478
00:27:23,685 --> 00:27:25,145
I can't.
- What?

479
00:27:25,145 --> 00:27:27,564
I can't stay in the hotel room with you.

480
00:27:27,564 --> 00:27:28,607
Why not?

481
00:27:28,607 --> 00:27:30,484
Because I'm starting to get that rash again.

482
00:27:30,484 --> 00:27:32,069
Well, I brought the antihistamines!

483
00:27:32,069 --> 00:27:33,779
Oh please. It's not going to help, George.

484
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:36,198
Clearly, this is psychosomatic.

485
00:27:36,198 --> 00:27:37,658
We need to go home.

486
00:27:37,658 --> 00:27:40,077
Bree, we just drove 3 hours to get here.

487
00:27:40,077 --> 00:27:41,954
I know, and you have every right to be mad,

488
00:27:41,954 --> 00:27:45,290
but George, I'm really starting to itch!

489
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:46,667
Is there a problem?

490
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:50,587
Uh, no, there's no problem, everything is fine.

491
00:27:50,587 --> 00:27:53,090
OK. I'll get you your own room.

492
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:53,674
George.

493
00:27:53,674 --> 00:27:57,970
No. We can still have a nice weekend. We'll just shift the focus to antiquing.

494
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:00,597
Please. Clearly, you didn't come here to shop.

495
00:28:00,597 --> 00:28:04,768
No, I came to spend time with you. Time that does not need to be spent in a bed.

496
00:28:04,768 --> 00:28:08,188
Really? You mean that? You wouldn't mind?

497
00:28:08,188 --> 00:28:08,981
No.

498
00:28:08,981 --> 00:28:11,859
No, George, we're going to have a great time.

499
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:16,363
There's tons of fun stuff we can do that doesn't involve sex.

500
00:28:16,363 --> 00:28:17,865
You betcha.

501
00:28:17,865 --> 00:28:20,367
I'll take care of this. Why don't you go get those brochures.

502
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:22,995
OK.

503
00:28:22,995 --> 00:28:25,873
George! You won't believe it!

504
00:28:25,873 --> 00:28:27,541
It just stopped itching!

505
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:32,588
How about that!

506
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,052
Nice suit.

507
00:28:39,052 --> 00:28:39,803
Just hear me out.

508
00:28:39,803 --> 00:28:41,930
I was going to take it back, I swear it.

509
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:42,681
But?

510
00:28:42,681 --> 00:28:44,766
But then I started thinking about it, and you know what?

511
00:28:44,766 --> 00:28:47,769
I'll be damned if I'm going to pitch to a roomful of people

512
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:50,355
who are all wearing Armani and Vera Wang,

513
00:28:50,355 --> 00:28:53,567
while I'm standing there with two-year-old breast milk crusted on my lapel!

514
00:28:53,567 --> 00:28:55,485
Lynette!
- And you know what else?

515
00:28:55,485 --> 00:28:59,656
I kicked ass in that meeting because of this suit!

516
00:28:59,656 --> 00:29:02,993
Lynette, it is a suit! Why are you so obsessed with it?

517
00:29:02,993 --> 00:29:07,164
You can't explain obsession, Tom. It just is.

518
00:29:07,164 --> 00:29:10,334
Look. We are parents. We can't afford the luxury of obsessions.

519
00:29:10,334 --> 00:29:15,380
See, that's where I think we have been making a terrible, terrible mistake.

520
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:21,386
What is this?!

521
00:29:21,386 --> 00:29:26,266
Sometimes we just need to get something that makes us happy.

522
00:29:26,266 --> 00:29:28,477
I know that sounds selfish, but I've been thinking:

523
00:29:28,477 --> 00:29:31,063
It might make us better people.

524
00:29:31,063 --> 00:29:35,150
And maybe even better parents.

525
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:35,859
No.

526
00:29:35,859 --> 00:29:36,985
No, Lynette, no.

527
00:29:36,985 --> 00:29:41,949
This is wrong.

528
00:29:42,991 --> 00:29:47,955
Carbon fiber shaft.

529
00:30:07,057 --> 00:30:09,059
Wow!

530
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:14,064
I feel like a better parent already.

531
00:30:14,606 --> 00:30:16,733
Oh yeah.

532
00:30:16,733 --> 00:30:18,193
So I was talking to one of the bellmen,

533
00:30:18,193 --> 00:30:22,281
and he said there's a place not far from here where we could go horseback-riding.

534
00:30:22,281 --> 00:30:25,450
Doesn't that sound like fun?

535
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,953
George?

536
00:30:27,953 --> 00:30:29,788
What? I--I'm sorry.

537
00:30:29,788 --> 00:30:32,875
I was saying, I think we should go horseback-riding.

538
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:37,880
Oh. Sure, that--that'd be great.

539
00:30:38,255 --> 00:30:39,089
What's wrong?

540
00:30:39,089 --> 00:30:44,052
Nothing, I just don't think that we should risk you getting another rash.

541
00:30:44,052 --> 00:30:46,180
I'm not going to get a rash just by holding your hand.

542
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:49,057
You never know.

543
00:30:49,057 --> 00:30:54,062
Oh. Well, OK.

544
00:30:57,941 --> 00:30:59,484
Hey, uh --

545
00:30:59,484 --> 00:31:01,486
I brought those antihistamines with me.

546
00:31:01,486 --> 00:31:04,740
Maybe you should take a couple, just to see if it works.

547
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:09,786
Oh. I'm drinking wine. I don't think you're supposed to mix pills with alcohol.

548
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:12,873
That's for people who are about to use heavy machinery.

549
00:31:12,873 --> 00:31:17,794
You don't plan on operating a forklift tonight, do you?

550
00:31:17,794 --> 00:31:21,089
You're the pharmacist. If you think it's OK --

551
00:31:21,089 --> 00:31:26,053
I do.

552
00:31:43,487 --> 00:31:44,988
George, I can't feel my legs!

553
00:31:44,988 --> 00:31:46,281
I know, sweetheart. Don't you worry.

554
00:31:46,281 --> 00:31:49,535
I'm not taking you around. I'm going to get you into bed.

555
00:31:49,535 --> 00:31:50,744
Is she going to be OK?

556
00:31:50,744 --> 00:31:53,664
Yes. She's just had a little too much wine.

557
00:31:53,664 --> 00:31:58,669
I don't thinggit was the wine, George, I thinggit was the annyhistamines.

558
00:31:59,253 --> 00:32:01,547
She doesn't know what she's --

559
00:32:01,547 --> 00:32:06,593
We're good, thank you.

560
00:32:12,349 --> 00:32:13,851
No, no, no.

561
00:32:13,851 --> 00:32:18,856
I'll get those. You just relax.

562
00:32:23,944 --> 00:32:26,363
I love you very much, Bree. You know that, right?

563
00:32:26,363 --> 00:32:31,410
Uh-huh. I know.

564
00:32:35,873 --> 00:32:40,460
And I want -- more than anything --

565
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:43,463
if you could love me back.

566
00:32:43,463 --> 00:32:46,758
You understand what I'm saying?

567
00:32:46,758 --> 00:32:51,805
Bree?

568
00:33:14,912 --> 00:33:18,040
Hey there.

569
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:22,336
How are you feeling?

570
00:33:22,336 --> 00:33:24,630
O--K.

571
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:27,216
Have you been sitting there all this time?

572
00:33:27,216 --> 00:33:29,134
I wanted to make sure you were OK.

573
00:33:29,134 --> 00:33:31,428
So I stayed and watched you sleep.

574
00:33:31,428 --> 00:33:34,806
Did I do anything embarrassing? Sometimes I snore.

575
00:33:34,806 --> 00:33:39,228
No. You slept like an angel.

576
00:33:39,228 --> 00:33:44,233
In fact, you were so beautiful and peaceful I actually started to feel guilty.

577
00:33:44,233 --> 00:33:46,485
Guilty?

578
00:33:46,485 --> 00:33:51,240
Well, you know, 'cause I told you to take those pills.

579
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,743
That chair looks so uncomfortable. Why didn't you sleep next to me?

580
00:33:54,743 --> 00:33:59,706
No. You made it pretty clear that you don't want me in your bed.

581
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:05,546
George.

582
00:34:05,546 --> 00:34:06,839
I know what you want from me,

583
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:09,716
and I -- thought I wanted the same thing,

584
00:34:09,716 --> 00:34:14,763
but I keep getting those rashes, because --

585
00:34:15,556 --> 00:34:20,018
I still feel married.

586
00:34:20,018 --> 00:34:23,146
That makes sense, I guess.

587
00:34:23,146 --> 00:34:26,525
Can't you just be patient?

588
00:34:26,525 --> 00:34:29,027
Can't you wait just a little bit longer?

589
00:34:29,027 --> 00:34:32,364
I've already waited my whole life for you.

590
00:34:32,364 --> 00:34:35,409
And I can wait a little more.

591
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:38,120
But let's be honest:

592
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:43,125
There's no guarantee that you'll ever be ready.

593
00:34:43,125 --> 00:34:48,088
There's only so much rejection I can take.

594
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,552
So I'll do my best, --

595
00:34:53,552 --> 00:34:58,515
but don't be surprised if one of these days, you wake up and I'm not here.

596
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:05,564
Now I should get back to my room, try to get a little sleep.

597
00:35:05,564 --> 00:35:10,486
The antique stores open at 10.

598
00:35:11,945 --> 00:35:15,699
George, wait!

599
00:35:15,699 --> 00:35:20,746
Please don't go.

600
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:31,215
Stay here with me.

601
00:35:38,013 --> 00:35:40,891
But what if you get another rash?

602
00:35:40,891 --> 00:35:45,938
Well, I'll just have to get over it, won't I?

603
00:36:32,818 --> 00:36:34,903
Gabrielle?

604
00:36:34,903 --> 00:36:39,950
I got your call.

605
00:36:40,742 --> 00:36:42,244
Wow.

606
00:36:42,244 --> 00:36:43,620
Does this mean what I think it means?

607
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:46,915
There are some ground rules first:

608
00:36:46,915 --> 00:36:50,210
I'm not leaving my husband.

609
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:55,215
Carlos is looking at spending 8 years in jail, because of my lapse of judgment with the gardener.

610
00:36:55,549 --> 00:36:59,553
I can't let him rot in there. I'd be filled with guilt.

611
00:36:59,553 --> 00:37:01,722
You could get him out and then divorce him.

612
00:37:01,722 --> 00:37:06,435
Not an option. I'm catholic. Hence the guilt.

613
00:37:06,435 --> 00:37:10,022
So, what are our options?

614
00:37:10,022 --> 00:37:12,107
This; our stolen moments;

615
00:37:12,107 --> 00:37:17,112
seeing each other whenever we can: Carlos never needs to know.

616
00:37:18,739 --> 00:37:22,034
No.

617
00:37:22,034 --> 00:37:24,912
I thought this is what you wanted.

618
00:37:24,912 --> 00:37:27,956
I want all of you.

619
00:37:27,956 --> 00:37:29,625
All or nothing.

620
00:37:29,625 --> 00:37:34,630
Then it's nothing.

621
00:37:36,089 --> 00:37:40,427
So you won't get a divorce, but you'll have an affair.

622
00:37:40,427 --> 00:37:44,515
I said I was catholic, not a fanatic.

623
00:37:44,515 --> 00:37:48,352
You know, David, you could tell me to stop.

624
00:37:48,352 --> 00:37:51,605
Just tell me to stop, and I will.

625
00:37:51,605 --> 00:37:56,610
Or you can have me right now -- on my terms.

626
00:38:00,113 --> 00:38:05,118
All right.

627
00:38:06,036 --> 00:38:06,620
What are you doing?

628
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,497
Making my point:

629
00:38:08,497 --> 00:38:10,499
You don't love me!

630
00:38:10,499 --> 00:38:12,125
Yes. I do.

631
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:14,503
No! You just agreed to an affair.

632
00:38:14,503 --> 00:38:17,548
A cheap illicit affair with the woman you love?

633
00:38:17,548 --> 00:38:19,925
Carlos would never share me!

634
00:38:19,925 --> 00:38:21,426
He's looking at 8 years in prison

635
00:38:21,426 --> 00:38:24,096
because the mere thought of it sent him into a violent rage.

636
00:38:24,096 --> 00:38:25,931
That is love!

637
00:38:25,931 --> 00:38:30,644
This is just lust, mixed with post-traumatic stress.

638
00:38:30,644 --> 00:38:33,689
I will see you in court tomorrow 10 a.m..

639
00:38:33,689 --> 00:38:34,898
And don't be late.

640
00:38:34,898 --> 00:38:39,945
Or else, I'll have you disbarred for sexual harassment.

641
00:38:50,706 --> 00:38:55,669
I'd take it easy with that snail poison. It's hell on your agapanthus.

642
00:38:56,378 --> 00:38:58,881
Thanks, I'll keep that in mind.

643
00:38:58,881 --> 00:39:03,510
Is that why you stopped by, for a few gardening tips?

644
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:06,305
Nobody wants you here, Paul.

645
00:39:06,305 --> 00:39:07,973
Especially me.

646
00:39:07,973 --> 00:39:10,392
I'm just a father looking for his son.

647
00:39:10,392 --> 00:39:15,189
Oh, I know what you are.

648
00:39:15,189 --> 00:39:16,982
First your girlfriend tries to run me off,

649
00:39:16,982 --> 00:39:20,319
with some crazy story about sending Zach to Utah.

650
00:39:20,319 --> 00:39:23,489
Now you're here trying to scare me away.

651
00:39:23,489 --> 00:39:28,202
So much for "love thy neighbor".

652
00:39:28,202 --> 00:39:30,871
Anyway, thanks for the advice.

653
00:39:30,871 --> 00:39:35,876
About my agapanthus, I mean. I'll make sure I'll send you some.

654
00:39:37,169 --> 00:39:42,174
What did Susan tell you?

655
00:39:43,175 --> 00:39:46,845
You are beautiful!

656
00:39:46,845 --> 00:39:50,599
You should really consider wearing this when you marry Mike.

657
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:52,601
We can make it a family tradition.

658
00:39:52,601 --> 00:39:57,564
Why don't we both stop getting divorced? That would be a nice family tradition.

659
00:39:59,107 --> 00:40:00,317
Hey!

660
00:40:00,317 --> 00:40:02,986
I need to ask you something important.

661
00:40:02,986 --> 00:40:04,112
My God!

662
00:40:04,112 --> 00:40:06,990
Oh! This is it!

663
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:08,200
Let me get my camera!

664
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,578
No, Mom! Stop!

665
00:40:11,578 --> 00:40:12,871
What is it?

666
00:40:12,871 --> 00:40:17,876
Did you give Zach money to go to Utah?

667
00:40:18,001 --> 00:40:19,962
What?

668
00:40:19,962 --> 00:40:24,800
Yes or no?

669
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,096
He was talking so much about Julie.

670
00:40:29,096 --> 00:40:32,766
I tried to get him to come home with me, I mean, to you --

671
00:40:32,766 --> 00:40:37,396
but he just kept going on and on about her, and I got scared.

672
00:40:37,396 --> 00:40:40,858
Yes or no?

673
00:40:40,858 --> 00:40:44,570
Yes.

674
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:46,113
Mike!

675
00:40:46,113 --> 00:40:49,366
Mike, I didn't do it to hurt you! You got to believe me!

676
00:40:49,366 --> 00:40:52,452
I should've told you rightaway, I know that.

677
00:40:52,452 --> 00:40:55,372
But you know now, so can we please talk about it?

678
00:40:55,372 --> 00:40:56,290
No.

679
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:57,166
Wait, stop!

680
00:40:57,166 --> 00:40:57,875
Susan --

681
00:40:57,875 --> 00:41:00,586
You said you wanted to help me, and I believed you.

682
00:41:00,586 --> 00:41:02,880
That's it. We're done.

683
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,509
No!

684
00:41:07,509 --> 00:41:10,387
No, no!

685
00:41:10,387 --> 00:41:12,598
I screwed up, OK.

686
00:41:12,598 --> 00:41:17,603
I want to fix it! Please let me fix it. Talk me out of it.

687
00:41:20,689 --> 00:41:25,652
I love you.

688
00:41:25,986 --> 00:41:30,991
Please, no! Please!

689
00:41:33,577 --> 00:41:40,459
Come back!

690
00:42:17,996 --> 00:42:23,001
<i>Yes, every little girl dreams of a big white wedding.</i></i>

691
00:42:23,168 --> 00:42:28,173
<i>But some dreams just don't come true.</i></i>
