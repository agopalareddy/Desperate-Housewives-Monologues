previously on...desperate housewives

5
00:00:05,047 --> 00:00:08,675
it seems on his last three trips east,he cashed in his first-class ticket

6
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:10,719
and took a detour to atlantic city.

7
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:12,971
Lynette received some disturbing news...

8
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:14,806
he said it was okay for me to kiss her.

9
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,433
What else did your brother tell you?

10
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:18,727
Caleb revealed a secret...

11
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:23,190
susan made a first class confession...

12
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,609
you're going to leave me out here in the middle of nowhere?

13
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:28,612
I can't be around you anymore.I'm just not strong enough.

14
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:34,201
And bree made the most difficult decision of her life.

15
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:43,001
susan mayer had always believed the one good thing about hard times

16
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:47,047
is that you get to find out who your friends really are.

17
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:52,719
When her grandmother died, it was bree who brought homemade cookies.

18
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:54,888
When the critics panned her third book,

19
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:58,725
it was gabrielle who hired the handsome masseur.

20
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:04,982
When her divorce became final, it was lynette who poured the scotch.

21
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:10,696
Sadly, susan's life had been shattered once again...

22
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:16,076
but as always, her friends had come to help pick up the pieces.

23
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:22,624
Susan? We've all been talking. We've decided you and julie should stay with bree.

24
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:25,419
Oh, thanks. No, that's okay. We'll stay at a motel.

25
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:26,670
Absolutely not.

26
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:30,424
Just give me an hour or two to straighten up andrew's room,and then you can bring your...

27
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:33,051
selves over.

28
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:34,970
I don't deserve friends like you.

29
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,972
We're aware of that.

30
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:43,145
susan, you're running low on trash bags. I'm going to run to the store.

31
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:45,480
Thanks, orson.Thanks for coming.

32
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,274
You know,you didn't have to do this.

33
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,109
Hey, it's my pleasure.

34
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:55,490
Mrs. Mayer!

35
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:02,789
Hi. Bud penrod,town and country insurance--the "can-do" people.

36
00:02:02,915 --> 00:02:04,374
Oh, it's nice to meet you.

37
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:07,169
Yeah. Look at that.

38
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:09,713
Well, that's no fun at all,is it?

39
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,673
No. No, it isn'T.

40
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:13,383
So when am I gonna get the check?

41
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:16,303
'Cause I have a lot of rebuilding to do.I need to get started.

42
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,055
Yeah, well, I'm afraid that's going to be a while.

43
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:22,059
You see, the fire department has ruled that this was arson.

44
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,895
Arson?

45
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:28,065
Yeah. So we can't give you any money until we finish our investigation.

46
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,983
Who would wanna burn down my house?

47
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:32,986
I don't know.Do you have any enemies?

48
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:38,534
No. No, look it.The whole neighborhood turned out to help.

49
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,202
I'm very popular.

50
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:43,747
And there's no one among them that wishes you ill?

51
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:47,251
Oh, no, no.Everybody's been very helpful.

52
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:51,046
Um, everybody likes me.Absolutely...

53
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:54,633
everyone.

54
00:02:54,716 --> 00:03:03,267
Yes, hard times were what susan used to distinguish who was a friend and who wasn'T.

55
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:15,571
Not everyone enjoys being a small part of a large community.

56
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:21,743
Indeed, some yearn to leave the stress and noise of constant companionship behind them

57
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:24,121
so they strike out on their own,

58
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:28,208
hoping their solitude will bring a little peace and quiet.

59
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:33,172
It's only then they discover how dangerous it is...

60
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:36,466
to be alone in the world.

61
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,708
zach, did you get the trash?

62
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,253
How'd you get in here?

63
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:13,962
Hiya, paul.

64
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:17,549
I stood at the back door shouting and shouting.Were you in the little boys room?

65
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:18,675
I'm calling the police.

66
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,928
No need. I just needed to borrow some flour.

67
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:24,515
I'm a little bit psychic,and I predict fresh-baked cookies in your future.

68
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,391
Zachary.

69
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:28,560
What'd she want?

70
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:29,937
She was in the cupboard.

71
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:33,273
Get a trash bag.We're throwing everything away.

72
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,150
You think she was trying to poison us?

73
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:38,362
All I know is we're eating out tonight.

74
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,245
What do you want?

75
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:53,085
this is a little awkward,and I apologize in advance for how this is gonna sound,but

76
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:58,757
um...by any chance,did... you burn down my house?

77
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:00,968
Yes.

78
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:02,219
What?

79
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,514
Yes, I burnt down your house,you sleazy little whore.

80
00:05:05,556 --> 00:05:06,515
Edie!

81
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:08,725
Why would you do that?!

82
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:13,021
Can you blame me,after sending me that acid letter?

83
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:15,524
Letter? What letter?

84
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:20,279
From one where you admitted to stabbing me in the back by sleeping with karl.

85
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,947
You weren't supposed to get that.

86
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,782
I stole that back from the mailman.

87
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:26,201
So you were trying to hide the truth from me?

88
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:29,329
This is not what we should focus on right now.The point is,

89
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:32,124
you maliciously set fire to my house.

90
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:35,961
Look, I admit I might have...overreacted a tad.

91
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,797
A tad?Edie, I have no roof!

92
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:41,925
You can't just go around burning down people's homes.

93
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,594
Why not?You burnt down my home.

94
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:46,263
You stole mike from me.You slept with my fianc?

95
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,848
That's the trifecta.

96
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:49,808
You're lucky I didn't torch your car.

97
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:50,726
That's it.

98
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:53,270
I'm going to the police,and I'm telling them what you did.

99
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,732
Did what?I didn't do anything.

100
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,859
What? You just confessed.

101
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,027
No, I didn'T.

102
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:03,447
Did anyone else hear me confess?

103
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:06,783
hello?Hello?

104
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:09,244
no witnesses.

105
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:12,539
No evidence, no confession.

106
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:14,082
I guess we're done here.

107
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,834
You can go home now.

108
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,628
Oh, wait. That's right.

109
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,339
You don't have one.

110
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:34,311
no, no, xiao-mei,I've told you a million times.No red meat for mr. Solis.

111
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,230
My triglycerides are through the roof.

112
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:39,107
Sweetie,I need some more cream.

113
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:47,616
Xiao-mei, what's wrong?

114
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:51,328
She smell.

115
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,330
Who smells? Gaby?

116
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:55,332
excuse me. What?

117
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:59,253
Her perfume...make me sick.

118
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:00,921
Honey, it's 100 bucks an ounce.

119
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:03,715
That tends to make everyone a little nauseous.

120
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:07,511
Xiao-mei, your boobs--are they tender?

121
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:11,181
Carlos! Her boobs are none of your business.

122
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:17,437
Gaby, think. She's sensitive to smell,nauseous and has swollen breasts.

123
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:31,451
well, I just ran her blood work.

124
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:33,954
It looks like the insemination was successful.

125
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:35,372
Oh!Oh, my god.

126
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,999
We're gonna have a baby!

127
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:40,836
Now, you should know,since she's experiencing early symptoms,

128
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,297
this might be a tough pregnancy for her.

129
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:46,842
Not a problem. We are gonna treat her like a queen!

130
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,344
Absolutely. You have nothing to worry about here.

131
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:54,057
oh, mrs. Solis,you smell.

132
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:56,351
Oh, yeah. Okay. Sorry.

133
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:05,861
I think it's gonna be a kick having susan and julie stay with us.

134
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:10,866
It'll be like living in a sorority.We'll stay up late and we'll gossip and make s'mores.

135
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:12,910
Doesn't that sound like fun?

136
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:16,246
Why are you pretending to be happy?

137
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:21,418
I heard you walking around your room all night long...crying.

138
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:24,004
I don't want to talk about it.

139
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:26,715
Look, I know why you're worried,but

140
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:28,675
andrew can take care of himself,

141
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:31,178
and if he can't he shouldn't have run away in the first place.

142
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:34,306
You know what? Maybe andrew leaving will be good for us.

143
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:40,312
You are all I have left,and I am gonna be the best mother that I can be.

144
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:43,357
There's definitely room for improvement.

145
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:46,527
It's just...

146
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:50,155
you kinda forgot my birthday.

147
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:52,491
What?

148
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:56,036
Yeah. It was six weeks ago.

149
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,748
Oh, my god, danielle.I am so sorry.

150
00:08:59,832 --> 00:09:01,959
It's okay.You had a lot going on.

151
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:07,047
I mean,andrew was suing you,and you were pretty wasted that month.

152
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,216
Honey, you've gotta let me make it up to you.

153
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:14,179
I-I'm gonna throw you a birthday party with all your friends, okay?

154
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:16,014
That could be cool.

155
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,684
You know what else I'd like?

156
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:20,644
Name it. It's yours.

157
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:23,564
I want andrew's room.

158
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:29,111
You said he's probably not coming back,and I could really use the extra closet space.

159
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:32,906
But, sweetheart, this is--this is his room.

160
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:35,617
Mom, you forgot my birthday.

161
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,995
You're really in no position to negotiate.

162
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:40,789
Honey, where am I gonna putall of his things?

163
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:43,792
And, you know, he might come back at some point.

164
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:49,923
He won'T.Like you said,I'm all you have left.

165
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:54,303
Atlantic city?

166
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:58,348
Yeah, it's last minute,but jerry got a great deal ona suite at one of the casinos,

167
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,893
and a bunch of the old gangis coming in from new york,

168
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:05,189
and god, it's been foreversince I have been,so how could I turn that down?

169
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:06,982
Yeah, how, indeed?

170
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:08,901
What?

171
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:10,152
I didn't say anything.

172
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,988
No, but you have that look.

173
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:16,033
Is something wrong?--No!

174
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:22,706
except that I know you've been to atlantic city three times

175
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,541
in the last month without telling me.

176
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:27,085
Ed found the receipts when he did the office audit.

177
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:30,130
Other than that,no, nothing's wrong.

178
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,967
tom, it would be better for your general well-being

179
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:36,178
if you did not laughat this moment in time.

180
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:40,557
Am I gonna have to ruin the surprise?Becauseit's a really good surprise.

181
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:42,935
I'm thinking, yeah, ruin it.

182
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,604
I have been going to atlantic city for business.

183
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:49,191
I am up for a top spotwith jerry's firm,huffington promotions.

184
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:52,236
And if you don'tbelieve me...

185
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:56,990
you can call the C.E.O. Himself.

186
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:03,664
I am... so happy and I'm so relieved.

187
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:06,542
Did you think I was cheating?

188
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,669
No! Absolutely not.Lynette...

189
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:10,712
no! Okay, a little bit.

190
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:12,548
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

191
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:17,886
Ed found receipts for flowers and theater tickets.I mean, by the way, did you--

192
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:21,849
jerry and I went to a show,and the flowers were for milt's wife.

193
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:25,894
I knew that. You didn'thave to tell me that.Why did you buy flowers for milt's wife?

194
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:26,687
Lynette...

195
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:30,440
sorry. Stop. Done talking.That's fantastic.

196
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:32,067
I love you!

197
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,194
I love you.

198
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:52,629
carlos...

199
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:56,633
what's going on?

200
00:11:57,092 --> 00:12:00,470
Xiao-mei is feeling under the weather,so I took up the vacuuming.

201
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:02,556
Oh, well,I'm sorry to hear that.

202
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,768
So, uh, did you move my beauty products?They're not in the bathroom.

203
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:12,065
Why in the hell?

204
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:13,734
I forgot to tell you.

205
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:15,944
Uh, youcan't use that stuff anymore.

206
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:18,030
It really triggers xiao-mei's morning sickness.

207
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:21,575
All of it?Even my hair pomade?

208
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,994
Gives me stomachache.

209
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:27,039
Yeah, well,it gives me volume,so I guess we're both gonna have a problem.

210
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:29,082
Do you have to be so high-maintenance?

211
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:32,169
You're not a model, carlos.Maintenance is my only skill.

212
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,588
Please, no fight.

213
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:39,760
If mrs. Solis smell bad,I be okay.

214
00:12:42,054 --> 00:12:45,641
fine. I'll learn to live without product.

215
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:50,395
But when my hairstarts smelling like hair,I don't wanna hear a word.

216
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:55,609
Surprise!

217
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,444
What the hell is that?

218
00:12:57,486 --> 00:12:59,029
Isn't it darling?

219
00:12:59,071 --> 00:13:00,656
I made it for your party.

220
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:04,493
It's a big "1"and a big "7"...for "17."

221
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:06,662
Were you up all night making that thing?

222
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:10,374
Yeah. I just wasn't tired.Oh, I wanna show you what else I've planned.

223
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,377
I think you're gonna love it.

224
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:16,255
You got a fajita barand a juggler?

225
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:18,006
No, relax.He's a very hip juggler.

226
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:22,219
He only performs to beatles songs,and I saw the video,and it's absolutely thrilling.

227
00:13:22,261 --> 00:13:25,305
Mom, I don't want any of this stuff.It's not even my real birthday.

228
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:30,310
Danielle, I just want you to have the best party you have ever hadin your entire life.

229
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,980
I just want a few friends to come over and hang out.

230
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:36,608
You can make a cake,but giant balloon numbers?

231
00:13:36,692 --> 00:13:40,445
I mean, come on.They would all make fun of me.

232
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:42,823
Oh.

233
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,910
Okay.

234
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,836
Is that really necessary?

235
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:59,590
Honey, I can't possibly put it in the garbage as is.

236
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:06,471
It's just another morning with the van de kamps.

237
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:08,682
Oh, susan,did I wake you?

238
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:11,685
Uh, no. No, I was up.

239
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:13,604
Well,I'm sorry about the noise.

240
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:18,400
It's just that danielle doesn't want balloons,and I'm kind of pressed for time.

241
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:22,654
Bree... are you okay?

242
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:26,408
She said she doesn't want balloons.

243
00:14:26,742 --> 00:14:28,368
I'm fine.

244
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,465
mom?

245
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:45,427
Look, I know you're out there.Please, just talk to me.

246
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:50,307
Mom, I need something to drink.Just some water, some juice.Something, anything. Please.

247
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:52,601
Mom!

248
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:01,235
You want me to say that I set caleb up?

249
00:15:01,527 --> 00:15:03,695
Yeah, I did it.

250
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:08,200
I started thinking about all those years--

251
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:11,286
years that we had to take care of him, and...

252
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,289
I just thought maybe once he was gone,

253
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,667
we could have a normal life.

254
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:19,837
and I'm sorry.

255
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:24,508
But, mom, you have gotto let me out of here now.

256
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:26,343
Damn you!

257
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:32,182
You were willing to stand by and let me murder your brother without reason.

258
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:35,936
That's an unforgivable betrayal.

259
00:15:35,978 --> 00:15:38,355
I am so consumed with rage.

260
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:44,236
It's best you stay in there,because if I let you out,I don't know what I might do to you.

261
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,539
hello?

262
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,708
I need edie to spillher guts.

263
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:00,043
What do you know about wearing a wire?

264
00:16:00,836 --> 00:16:02,588
So you see the little red light?

265
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:06,049
It's all voice-activated,so if the light's on,you're recording.

266
00:16:06,175 --> 00:16:08,468
Uh, let me show you how to tape it on.

267
00:16:08,594 --> 00:16:10,262
Oh, okay.

268
00:16:10,888 --> 00:16:13,056
Sorry if my hands are cold.

269
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,476
Um... no, that's okay.They're fine.

270
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:22,983
So you sure you wanna do this?

271
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,569
Yeah. I'm sort of up against the wall.

272
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:28,322
The insurance company needs proof fast,

273
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:32,993
and things are sort of weirdat bree'S.I don't wanna over stay my welcome.

274
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,997
Well, if things get tough,you can always stay here.

275
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,749
Testing, testing.

276
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:42,836
I'm sorry. Did you just invite me to move in with you?

277
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,881
Well, you and julie in the spare bedroom.

278
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:48,342
You've...

279
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:52,221
you've been saying how you want to be friends again,

280
00:16:52,304 --> 00:16:53,764
and you're right.

281
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:57,059
There's no reason we can't be friends.

282
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,771
You sure that won't put a crimpin your, uh, dating life?

283
00:17:00,896 --> 00:17:03,273
You know, that girl you were at the movies with?

284
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:06,193
No. That was a one-time thing.

285
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:08,987
But what about that guy,though? Orson.

286
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:12,699
Yeah, he just heard about the fire and came over to help.We're friends.

287
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:17,871
Oh. So... neither of us is dating anybody.

288
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:20,249
Guess not.

289
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:26,880
I got my boarding pass.

290
00:17:26,922 --> 00:17:30,384
Do what you need to do and don't worry about the kids.I'll keep 'em out of trouble.

291
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:32,219
Is this crazy?

292
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:35,514
Following tom across the country just to spy on him?

293
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:37,307
If he knewI was doing this...

294
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:39,935
god, I don't thinkI can go through with this.

295
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:43,272
Now, look, there's probably nothing going on,

296
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:45,190
but you need to know the truth.

297
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:47,693
Do I? I'm happy.I mean, I was.

298
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:51,196
Why don't ijust look the other way and pretend nothing's wrong?Lots of women can do that.

299
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,116
But we both knowyou're not one of them.

300
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:57,244
And what if I see him with another woman?

301
00:17:57,369 --> 00:17:59,121
What then?

302
00:18:01,582 --> 00:18:04,001
I own a gun.

303
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:23,187
you okay here?

304
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,938
I'm fine. Why?

305
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:28,567
It's just, people have been asking about the cake,and you've been

306
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:30,068
icing it for over an hour.

307
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:33,572
Well,I just keep messing it up.I don't know what's wrong with me.

308
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:35,449
You're probably just tired.

309
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:37,951
My mom and I heard you up all night.

310
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:41,121
it just keeps coming out too thick.

311
00:18:45,501 --> 00:18:49,046
You know,people aren't gonna care if the icing isn't perfect.

312
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:52,674
People care about details.

313
00:18:52,758 --> 00:18:56,678
Someday when danielle looks back,I want her to remember

314
00:18:56,762 --> 00:19:01,433
just how perfect her cake looked and how hard her mother worked to make her happy.

315
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,562
This cake is a symbolof my love.

316
00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:10,526
Well, it looks delicious.

317
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:17,282
happy birthday to you

318
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:21,411
happy birthday to you

319
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:26,291
happy birthday dear danielle

320
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:30,462
stop!One of the candles went out.

321
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:34,258
Um, we're gonna have to do this all over again.I'm sorry. I'll be right back.

322
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:35,342
Mom, it's all right.

323
00:19:35,384 --> 00:19:39,179
Sweetheart,this is your special day.All of your candless hould be lit.

324
00:19:39,263 --> 00:19:41,390
It'll just take me two seconds.

325
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,183
Is she serious?

326
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:45,936
Welcometo my own private hell.

327
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:52,025
That is some serious frosting.

328
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:53,735
all righty.

329
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:13,046
who touched this?

330
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:15,632
Mom, what is the matter?It's just a little frosting.

331
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:19,052
Somebody ruined your cake,and I wanna know who could be that thoughtless.

332
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:23,182
Was it you? Or you?!Who was it?

333
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:25,017
Mom, please,you're embarrassing me.

334
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,270
You. You look like a girlwho enjoys her frosting.

335
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:31,356
No! No, I didn't touch it.

336
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,318
It's just a cake, for god sakes.Will you please just cut it?

337
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:35,736
Mrs. Van de kamp--

338
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:37,279
open your mouth.I wanna smell your breath.

339
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:40,574
It wasn't me!It was barbie.

340
00:20:40,616 --> 00:20:41,992
Barbie!

341
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:46,079
what the hellis wrong with you?!

342
00:20:46,163 --> 00:20:49,458
Now it's ruined!Everything is ruined!

343
00:21:00,177 --> 00:21:07,726
you can just...leave that there,and I'll, um...clean it up later.

344
00:21:13,524 --> 00:21:16,527
Xiao-mei, what are you doing in our bed?

345
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,987
I said she could sleepin there from now on.

346
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:20,822
It's got the bathroom,

347
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:23,408
you know, in case she gets sickin the middle of the night.

348
00:21:23,492 --> 00:21:25,327
Well, what's wrong with the guest bathroom?

349
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:26,995
It's too far away.

350
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:28,247
It's right down the hall.

351
00:21:28,372 --> 00:21:29,957
Gaby, she needs her rest.

352
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,168
And besides, that bed is much more comfortable than the one in the guest room.

353
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:37,256
Yeah, I know.That's why I had the movers put it in here, where we sleep.

354
00:21:40,217 --> 00:21:42,678
Maybe I go to my bed.

355
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:44,805
Yes, xiao-mei,that would be good.

356
00:21:52,396 --> 00:21:56,066
Fine.You can use our toilet.

357
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:03,115
ow! Stop kicking me.

358
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:04,324
I'm just tryingto get comfortable.

359
00:22:04,408 --> 00:22:06,285
Yeah, in a twin?Good luck.

360
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:10,497
God, I want my bed back.

361
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:13,750
We'll go buy a nice big onetomorrow and put it in here, okay?

362
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:15,335
That is not the point.

363
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:19,214
We area week into this pregnancy,and you're already puttingxiao-mei's needs before mine.

364
00:22:19,298 --> 00:22:22,176
Well, she's the priority now.She's the mother of my child.

365
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:26,889
Like hell she is.That is my egg.

366
00:22:26,972 --> 00:22:29,474
You know what I mean.She's the...

367
00:22:29,516 --> 00:22:33,562
oven, carlos. The oven.A well-cared-for,well-paid oven.

368
00:22:33,645 --> 00:22:37,316
It came out wrong.I'm sorry, okay?Now can we justget some sleep?

369
00:22:42,613 --> 00:22:46,450
Babe, I'm sorry.I swear.I swear I didn't mean to.My leg just cramped up.

370
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:50,162
Where are you going?That's my pillow!

371
00:22:50,996 --> 00:22:53,081
Good night.

372
00:22:57,711 --> 00:22:59,254
matthew!

373
00:23:17,356 --> 00:23:18,982
mom, come on.

374
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:21,193
Oh, my god.What are you doing in there?

375
00:23:21,276 --> 00:23:22,736
Danielle, is that you?

376
00:23:22,903 --> 00:23:26,114
My mom found out what we did to caleb.She flipped out and locked me in here.

377
00:23:26,156 --> 00:23:27,991
Don't worry. I'll get you out.

378
00:23:28,116 --> 00:23:31,203
Be really careful, okay?Please, okay?I've never seen her like this before.

379
00:23:31,286 --> 00:23:32,663
She's seriously lost it this time.

380
00:23:32,704 --> 00:23:37,793
I know a little something about psycho moms.Trust me, I'll be fine.

381
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,343
hey.

382
00:23:47,344 --> 00:23:50,264
Cleaning up after the big party?

383
00:23:50,347 --> 00:23:51,765
Yeah.

384
00:23:54,852 --> 00:23:56,478
You know, it's late.

385
00:23:56,562 --> 00:23:58,438
Why don't you, uh,go to bed and,

386
00:23:58,522 --> 00:24:00,691
you know,let julie and I help you with that in the morning?

387
00:24:00,774 --> 00:24:03,735
Oh, that's okay.I can't sleep anyway.

388
00:24:05,863 --> 00:24:08,490
Are you... okay?

389
00:24:08,866 --> 00:24:11,243
I take it you heard what happened.

390
00:24:11,326 --> 00:24:16,623
Yeah, when you flip out in front of the pep squad,word travels fast.

391
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:21,879
It was the oddest sensation.I was fine,

392
00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:26,008
and everything was fine,and then suddenly I was on the outside of my body

393
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:31,972
watching a woman who looked like me becoming a raving maniac.

394
00:24:32,764 --> 00:24:35,309
Bree, I'm worried about you.Do...

395
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:38,061
do you think that you should see someone?

396
00:24:38,103 --> 00:24:40,731
Oh, no, I'm fine.I'm just tired, that's all.

397
00:24:40,814 --> 00:24:43,275
I just need a long rest,and then I'm gonna beas good as new.

398
00:24:43,358 --> 00:24:48,488
Okay, well, then why don't you stop and go to bed?

399
00:24:48,572 --> 00:24:52,534
Because, um, I can't sleep just yet.

400
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:53,952
Why not?

401
00:24:54,036 --> 00:24:55,412
Because when I sleep,I dream,

402
00:24:55,537 --> 00:24:59,166
and when I dream,I keep seeing andrew's face in that rearview mirror.

403
00:24:59,291 --> 00:25:01,919
Okay, what are you talking about?

404
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:07,382
Andrew, didn't run away.

405
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:14,598
I, dropped him offin the middle of nowhere,

406
00:25:15,766 --> 00:25:19,520
told him that I couldn'tbe around him anymore,and then...

407
00:25:21,063 --> 00:25:23,607
I drove off.

408
00:25:27,986 --> 00:25:33,700
So I just need a little time to forget what I've done,and then I can sleep again.

409
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,038
Hey.

410
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:45,295
You know,I am not even tired.

411
00:25:45,504 --> 00:25:51,134
So... why don't I stay up and help you?

412
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:54,888
That would be nice.

413
00:26:27,671 --> 00:26:28,589
hello?

414
00:26:28,672 --> 00:26:30,591
Hey, you.How you doing?

415
00:26:30,674 --> 00:26:33,844
Hey! Great.

416
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:37,890
Great. How's atlantic city?Are you, um, winning some money?

417
00:26:37,973 --> 00:26:39,892
Oh, I'm about even.

418
00:26:39,975 --> 00:26:42,936
Actually, I'm heading backinto the casino right nowto try my luck again.

419
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:46,148
Yeah?You're quite a gambler.

420
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:48,692
where's jerry?

421
00:26:50,652 --> 00:26:55,616
Uh, jerry?He--he's right here.Hey, honey, how are the kids?

422
00:26:55,699 --> 00:26:58,785
Great. Great.They're in the day care room.

423
00:26:58,869 --> 00:27:01,163
I'M... looking at 'em right now.

424
00:27:01,246 --> 00:27:05,042
hey, why don't youwalk in there and, put 'em on the phone with meso I can say hi?

425
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:07,544
Okay. Sure.

426
00:27:07,878 --> 00:27:10,047
First,can I talk to jerry?

427
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:12,132
Why do you wanna talk to jerry?

428
00:27:12,174 --> 00:27:15,177
Well, just, you know, say hello.It's been a long time.

429
00:27:21,308 --> 00:27:24,144
wow, man, that is weird.

430
00:27:24,228 --> 00:27:26,230
Can you hear--do you hear that car alarm?

431
00:27:26,313 --> 00:27:29,191
Uh... no.

432
00:27:30,442 --> 00:27:34,154
It's strange,because I can hear it here and through the phone.

433
00:27:34,238 --> 00:27:38,116
Whoa. That's weird kind of feedback, you know?

434
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,203
physics can be spookythat way.Listen, I gotta go.I gotta go.

435
00:27:41,286 --> 00:27:44,498
Ed is talking to me,and, um,I'll call you back later?

436
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:46,124
Um, okay.

437
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:47,918
Okay, bye.

438
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:49,545
Bye, honey.

439
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:04,768
9-1-1.Is this an emergency?

440
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:05,894
I think so.

441
00:28:05,936 --> 00:28:09,439
My neighbor, paul young,has been threatening me.

442
00:28:09,481 --> 00:28:10,858
Is he there right now?

443
00:28:10,941 --> 00:28:11,733
No.

444
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:14,945
Ma'am, until he actuallydoes something,there's nothingwe can do.

445
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:17,197
Well, I won't live in fear anymore.

446
00:28:17,239 --> 00:28:19,825
If you people refuse to confront him,

447
00:28:19,908 --> 00:28:23,036
I guess I'll just have to do it myself.

448
00:28:42,347 --> 00:28:43,390
no, edie, wait.

449
00:28:43,473 --> 00:28:45,350
Um, I don't wanna fight.

450
00:28:45,434 --> 00:28:50,022
I know that we've hadour differences,but, you know, we hada friendship going there,

451
00:28:50,105 --> 00:28:54,109
and I just think we owe itto ourselves to talk about what happened.

452
00:28:54,193 --> 00:28:57,237
What's there to talk about?It happened.

453
00:28:57,362 --> 00:28:59,490
I walked down to your house...

454
00:28:59,573 --> 00:29:00,991
I had a watering can...

455
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:01,867
what?

456
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,285
filled it with gasoline and...

457
00:29:03,619 --> 00:29:06,872
boom!Laughed my ass off.

458
00:29:06,955 --> 00:29:08,540
Okay, wait.Could you just swallow?

459
00:29:08,665 --> 00:29:10,292
'Cause I couldn't really...what you were saying--

460
00:29:10,334 --> 00:29:11,919
and that was basically it.

461
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:14,254
One of the best days of my life.

462
00:29:14,338 --> 00:29:17,633
Well, see, you were chewing,and so I didn't really hear what you said.

463
00:29:17,716 --> 00:29:19,718
Could you just say it again?

464
00:29:20,093 --> 00:29:22,638
I burnt your house down.It was great. What do you want?

465
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:25,557
So, uh, y-you then a-admit

466
00:29:25,641 --> 00:29:29,311
burning down my house on purpose?

467
00:29:36,985 --> 00:29:39,696
You're wearing a wire,aren't you?

468
00:29:39,822 --> 00:29:40,739
Huh?

469
00:29:40,781 --> 00:29:43,075
Open that blouse.What?

470
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,993
Open that blouse!

471
00:29:47,329 --> 00:29:51,708
you can't outrun me, mayer!I'm in the best shapeof my life!

472
00:29:51,792 --> 00:29:55,462
Well, good, then you'll be prime meat picking when you go to jail!

473
00:29:55,546 --> 00:29:56,004
You give it!

474
00:29:56,088 --> 00:29:57,422
bite me!

475
00:30:01,176 --> 00:30:03,303
No! No!

476
00:30:10,143 --> 00:30:12,229
what the hell? Huh.

477
00:31:54,623 --> 00:32:00,003
Nine months of long nights on the couch loomed before gabrielle...

478
00:32:02,047 --> 00:32:06,134
and she had decided she would not take it lying down.

479
00:32:06,885 --> 00:32:11,014
So she dipped into her supply of forbidden perfumes...

480
00:32:12,182 --> 00:32:15,310
determined that in this battle...

481
00:32:16,645 --> 00:32:20,899
she would be the one to come out smelling like a rose.

482
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,903
I think I take nap now.

483
00:32:25,028 --> 00:32:27,823
Yeah, sure,knock yourself out.

484
00:32:32,536 --> 00:32:35,664
Aah!

485
00:32:45,382 --> 00:32:46,842
honey?

486
00:32:52,472 --> 00:32:54,183
Boys?

487
00:32:58,604 --> 00:33:00,606
Anybody home?

488
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:07,488
Hey, mrs. Mccluskey,excuse me.You haven't seenlynette around, have you?

489
00:33:07,988 --> 00:33:10,324
She's not home. She's not answering her cell phone.

490
00:33:10,991 --> 00:33:13,577
She packed up the kids and the puppy and left.

491
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,245
Packed 'em up? Why?

492
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:18,957
She followed you to atlantic city.She knows about your other woman.

493
00:33:19,291 --> 00:33:22,794
Boy, you're just lucky you're not my husband.

494
00:33:31,345 --> 00:33:32,554
Hi.

495
00:33:41,438 --> 00:33:46,735
okay, first, let me say,I'm really sorryabout the yellowjackets.

496
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:52,616
And... also, no matter how mad I am about what you did,

497
00:33:52,699 --> 00:33:54,743
I don't want to see you go to prison.

498
00:33:54,827 --> 00:33:57,871
So I came with a solution.

499
00:33:58,247 --> 00:34:01,333
Why don't you just come forward and tell the police that

500
00:34:01,625 --> 00:34:06,880
you saw some vagrant lurking by my garage with a can of gasoline?

501
00:34:07,548 --> 00:34:11,635
And if you do that,then I'll destroy the tape.

502
00:34:11,718 --> 00:34:15,472
And then the insurance company will pay the claim.Nobody gets hurt.

503
00:34:15,556 --> 00:34:17,641
Does that sound good?

504
00:34:19,142 --> 00:34:21,687
come closer.

505
00:34:29,695 --> 00:34:33,407
take your stinking deal and shove it.

506
00:34:33,574 --> 00:34:34,408
Edie...

507
00:34:34,491 --> 00:34:37,953
every time something bad happens to me,you're standing nearby.

508
00:34:38,036 --> 00:34:43,959
Well, I've had it.No more pretending to be friends.When I get outta here,

509
00:34:44,042 --> 00:34:46,086
I'm gonna destroy you.

510
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:50,340
Okay, I'm just gonna think that this is the meds talking,

511
00:34:50,424 --> 00:34:52,759
and I'll come back tomorrow.

512
00:34:52,885 --> 00:34:54,636
Don't bother.

513
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,472
Okay, edie,I'm in trouble here.

514
00:34:57,556 --> 00:35:01,518
Oh, I'm sure you'll turn on the waterworks,and the whole neighborhood will come running.

515
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,437
They always do.

516
00:35:03,562 --> 00:35:04,646
That's not true.

517
00:35:04,771 --> 00:35:05,647
Sure, it is.

518
00:35:05,731 --> 00:35:08,692
You never miss an opportunity to play the victim,

519
00:35:08,817 --> 00:35:13,530
and you think just because everybody always comes to your rescue,

520
00:35:13,614 --> 00:35:16,074
it means that you're loved.

521
00:35:16,158 --> 00:35:18,243
Well, it doesn'T.

522
00:35:18,327 --> 00:35:20,704
It means that you're helpless.

523
00:35:20,913 --> 00:35:22,998
Now get out.

524
00:35:23,624 --> 00:35:26,585
Just get out.

525
00:35:35,844 --> 00:35:36,762
Hey there.

526
00:35:36,845 --> 00:35:37,888
Hi.

527
00:35:38,931 --> 00:35:42,059
So you given any thought to staying at my place?

528
00:35:42,142 --> 00:35:44,728
Oh, yeah, that. Um...

529
00:35:45,354 --> 00:35:49,608
look, I really appreciatethe offer,but I think I'm gonna have to pass.

530
00:35:49,691 --> 00:35:51,652
Really?--Yeah.

531
00:35:51,735 --> 00:35:53,320
I think it's best.

532
00:35:53,403 --> 00:35:56,114
I don't wanna get a rep around here for being a charity case,you know?

533
00:35:56,156 --> 00:36:00,494
Well, I didn't mean it that way--just one friend helping out another.

534
00:36:01,245 --> 00:36:05,123
I know, but I can figure this out on my own.

535
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:07,459
At least I'm gonna try.

536
00:36:08,293 --> 00:36:11,046
You know, I'm stronger than people give me credit for.

537
00:36:11,129 --> 00:36:12,548
I really am.

538
00:36:13,048 --> 00:36:16,343
Well, if there's anything I can do...

539
00:36:18,345 --> 00:36:20,264
you know what would be nice?

540
00:36:20,389 --> 00:36:24,476
Why don't you just stop over for coffee sometime?

541
00:36:24,726 --> 00:36:25,727
Okay.

542
00:36:25,853 --> 00:36:29,815
I mean, that is after I get running water and electricity again...

543
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:32,484
and a coffeemaker.

544
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:41,076
I hope you're happy.That poor girl

545
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,079
can hardly even come upstairs now because of you.

546
00:36:44,204 --> 00:36:47,541
Carlos, stop with the dance.It's already in the wallpaper.

547
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:50,502
Now I swear, if anything happens to that kid because of you...

548
00:36:50,586 --> 00:36:52,963
oh, it's perfume,not toxic gas.

549
00:36:52,963 --> 00:36:54,965
Why are you acting this way?

550
00:36:55,048 --> 00:36:59,052
Because I seethe writing on the wall,and it scares the hell out of me.

551
00:36:59,261 --> 00:37:00,387
Meaning what?

552
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:02,890
From the second xiao-mei got pregnant,you have found a million

553
00:37:02,973 --> 00:37:05,851
and oneways to tell me that that baby is more important to you than me.

554
00:37:05,934 --> 00:37:07,936
Oh, come on, gaby.

555
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:11,982
No! Men can't help it.When they become fathers,they become lousy husbands,

556
00:37:12,482 --> 00:37:16,361
and some wives don't mind,but you didn't marryone of those women.

557
00:37:16,737 --> 00:37:18,655
I don't think I can sleepin here tonight.

558
00:37:18,739 --> 00:37:21,783
The air's just a little too toxic.

559
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:32,044
she kick you out, too?

560
00:37:33,545 --> 00:37:37,174
Marriage is complicated,xiao-mei.You'll find that out someday.

561
00:37:37,216 --> 00:37:41,011
You feel like watching some trashy american tv?

562
00:37:44,014 --> 00:37:47,809
I make you sandwich.Roast beef.

563
00:37:48,268 --> 00:37:53,357
oh, man.Gaby's got meon this health kick thing.She'll kill meif I eat red meat.

564
00:37:54,316 --> 00:37:57,277
I will not tell.

565
00:38:05,118 --> 00:38:07,579
Taste good?

566
00:38:08,872 --> 00:38:10,374
Real good.

567
00:38:12,584 --> 00:38:15,838
Matthew, wake up.I have your breakfast.

568
00:38:16,672 --> 00:38:20,884
I might be furious with you,but never let it be saidthat I'm cruel.

569
00:38:21,552 --> 00:38:28,267
I advise you not to charge this door,because I am not in the mood for any unpleasantness.

570
00:38:29,268 --> 00:38:32,771
Matthew?Matthew?

571
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:44,533
jeez, danielle! I thought you were just gonna steal the key.

572
00:38:44,575 --> 00:38:46,785
Let's just get out of here.

573
00:39:00,799 --> 00:39:05,220
mother, matthew and i are running away together, and we're never coming back.

574
00:39:05,304 --> 00:39:08,765
If you want me to be happy, you won't try to find us.

575
00:39:09,016 --> 00:39:12,561
Living in that house with you was like being in a prison.

576
00:39:12,686 --> 00:39:15,856
You drove me to do this, so i hope you'll blame yourself.

577
00:39:15,981 --> 00:39:18,525
Have a nice life. Danielle.

578
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,991
Hello.

579
00:39:26,074 --> 00:39:31,580
My name is bree van de kamp,and I'd like to admit myself for psychiatric observation.

580
00:39:31,663 --> 00:39:33,624
All right,what seems to be the problem?

581
00:39:33,916 --> 00:39:38,545
I think I'm about to have a nervous breakdown.

582
00:39:45,636 --> 00:39:47,346
Damn it!

583
00:39:52,935 --> 00:39:54,686
what the hell?

584
00:40:01,777 --> 00:40:04,947
That psychotic bitch.

585
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,773
there was no confrontation.

586
00:40:39,857 --> 00:40:42,985
Felicia tillman's the one who made the call.She's the anonymous tip.

587
00:40:43,068 --> 00:40:44,528
Let's just go over there right now.

588
00:40:44,611 --> 00:40:48,198
I guarantee you,the woman is having a cocktail,laughing her ass off.

589
00:40:48,574 --> 00:40:51,076
We're not going anywhere yet, sir.

590
00:40:53,453 --> 00:40:55,831
yes, I know there's blood everywhere.

591
00:40:56,081 --> 00:41:00,043
She probably got it from a pig so she can vandalize everything I own.

592
00:41:03,005 --> 00:41:04,381
Sergeant...

593
00:41:06,008 --> 00:41:07,509
what is it?

594
00:41:07,593 --> 00:41:10,053
Put your hands where I can see 'em.

595
00:41:16,602 --> 00:41:19,021
Oh, man, she's good.

596
00:41:21,565 --> 00:41:25,235
It's a shocking moment for each of us,

597
00:41:25,402 --> 00:41:29,740
that moment we realize we are all alone in this world.

598
00:41:30,908 --> 00:41:36,371
The family we take for granted could one day abandon us.

599
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:44,796
The husband we trust so implicitly might betray us...

600
00:41:45,964 --> 00:41:51,929
the daughter we love so deeply perhaps won't return to us.

601
00:41:52,304 --> 00:41:56,475
And then we could end up all by ourselves.

602
00:41:58,852 --> 00:42:03,524
Of course, some see great value in going it alone.

603
00:42:04,274 --> 00:42:06,235
For example...

604
00:42:06,735 --> 00:42:09,029
sorry about the dust,mrs. Huber.

605
00:42:09,071 --> 00:42:11,698
We don't get too many tourists this far up the mountain.

606
00:42:11,782 --> 00:42:15,035
First snows come,and this placeis completely cut off.

607
00:42:15,077 --> 00:42:19,998
Dropping off the face of the earth--now that's what I call a vacation.

608
00:42:21,041 --> 00:42:22,793
I'm sorry.

609
00:42:26,421 --> 00:42:29,716
Sometimes I'm just all thumbs.
