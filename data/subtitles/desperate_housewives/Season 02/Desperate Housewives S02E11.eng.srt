2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,382
George paid for what he did to your father.

3
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:08,759
Bree confessed...

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,886
Did you give Zach money to go to Utah?

5
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:12,304
Susan betrayed mike...

6
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:13,722
What kind of friend is he?

7
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:15,098
The real good kind.

8
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,351
Andrew pushed the boundaries...

9
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:19,728
Zach's come home. Is there anything I can do?

10
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,104
Paul put his foot down...

11
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:22,439
you can leave us alone.

12
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:23,941
So when do I tell people you'll be back?

13
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:25,651
Couple, maybe three days.

14
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:30,906
And a stranger finally caught up with Caleb.

15
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:35,702
Kisses are such simple things,

16
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:37,871
we hardly notice them.

17
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:39,873
But if we paid more attention,

18
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:44,336
we'd see that each kiss conveys a meaning all its own.

19
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:45,587
For example,

20
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:49,299
some can say, "I'm so happy to see you."

21
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:54,388
Or, "I didn't realize you'd be here."

22
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:56,431
Bye.

23
00:00:56,473 --> 00:01:00,686
Or, "honey, it's time to stop drinking."

24
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:04,731
The trick is in knowing how to tell the difference.

25
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,609
So I finally said, if I'm head cheerleader,

26
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:09,069
then nobody wears panties.

27
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,072
Yeah!

28
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,074
I just want you to knowas a former member

29
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:16,994
of my high school marching band, I would've appreciated that.

30
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,579
Wait a second, you were a band geek?

31
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,955
Oh, I don't believe it.

32
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:20,831
What did you play?

33
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:23,917
He played the tuba. I have pictures.

34
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,210
The tuba, huh?

35
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:27,129
Yeah, go ahead, come on, come on, get your licks in, go ahead.

36
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:28,881
No, no, not at all. As a matter of fact,

37
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,633
all of my secret crushes were on the band geeks.

38
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:33,969
Come on, I know you cheerleader types.

39
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:35,804
You wouldn't have said "boo" to guys like me.

40
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:37,723
No, you were more interested in the guys like- like this. Now,

41
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:41,143
I take it you didn't play the tuba.

42
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:43,395
No, I didn'T.

43
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,773
All I know is, I was a lonely, insecure tuba player.

44
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:49,651
Girls like Gabrielle would justrip my heart out.

45
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:50,402
Aw.

46
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,988
I didn't even had my first kiss until I was 18.

47
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,948
-18?
- Pathetic, I know.

48
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,075
Poor baby. I would've kissed you.

49
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,161
No, you wouldn't have. Yes, I would have.

50
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:01,163
No, you wouldn't have. And it's okay, Gaby.

51
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:03,415
Those scars healed a long time ago.

52
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,417
Oh, for God sakes, come here.

53
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:08,754
Now on behalf of all the cheerleaders in the world,

54
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,839
forgive us.

55
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:12,883
Oh, yeah! Whoo!

56
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:18,472
Yes, kisses mean different things to different people.

57
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:22,392
Ultimately, the meaning depends

58
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:25,062
on the one who does the kissing...

59
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,355
Wowie.

60
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:29,775
Cheers.

61
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,569
And the who sees it happen.

62
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:45,833
After every party

63
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,918
comes the time for cleaning.

64
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,962
We attend to the champagne

65
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,089
that was spilled,

66
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:56,176
the knickknacks that got broken,

67
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:59,471
the food that went uneaten.

68
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,934
Oh, here, let me take that.

69
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:07,271
And whatever other messes need cleaning up.

70
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,398
So, uh, Gaby...

71
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,483
you know that thing

72
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:13,277
you and Tom did tonight?

73
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,028
The- the kiss?

74
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,239
Was that hysterical?

75
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:19,408
The look on Tom's face!

76
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:21,451
Yeah.

77
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,752
I know this sounds silly,

78
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,546
but...

79
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:34,798
it kind of bugged me.

80
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,050
You're not serious.

81
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:38,427
Yeah, I am.

82
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,720
I don't-

83
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,346
I don't want to make a big deal out of it,

84
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,806
but, uh,

85
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:45,142
could you maybe

86
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:47,436
not do that again?

87
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,313
Okay.

88
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,064
Thanks.

89
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:52,733
Okay.

90
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,026
Hey, what happened to the Applewhites?

91
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,319
I thought you were gonna invite them.

92
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,031
I did. Betty never R.S.V.P.'d.

93
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,949
What do you guys think about the Applewhites?

94
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:01,992
I like 'em, very nice.

95
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:03,202
Very...

96
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,077
interesting.

97
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,287
Right, interesting.

98
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:07,748
Hmm, they weird me out, too.

99
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,708
Well, that's not what we're saying.

100
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,669
not exactly, anyway.

101
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:14,087
You know, we were just having fun,

102
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:15,756
entertaining the crowd.

103
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,299
Oh, sure, but...

104
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:20,385
but maybe next time you could try juggling instead.

105
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:21,887
What's going on?

106
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,680
Nothing.

107
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:25,641
Really?

108
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,684
I sense a little tension.

109
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:29,895
No, no tension.

110
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:34,650
What?

111
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,193
You make it sound like...

112
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:38,820
I was making a pass at your husband.

113
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:41,406
And that's just a little bit insulting.

114
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,617
I just said it bugged me.

115
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:45,619
Why is that a problem?

116
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:47,621
Is this about that kiss?

117
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:48,580
What kiss?

118
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,082
Oh, you were in the living room.

119
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,917
Gaby planted a big, wet kiss

120
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,335
on Tom... as a joke.

121
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:55,170
It was hilarious.

122
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:55,838
You see?

123
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,464
Yeah, but to be fair to Lynette,

124
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:58,715
you are an ex-model.

125
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:01,343
And surely it must have dawned on you that some women

126
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:03,971
might prefer it if you didn't kiss their husbands.

127
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,722
That's all I'm saying.

128
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:06,890
Oh, you guys, we're all friends.

129
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:09,351
This isn't something to get worked up over.

130
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:11,562
I'm not worked up.

131
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:14,231
Me neither.

132
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:16,483
Hey, everyone,

133
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,694
did you see what Kathy Lewis was wearing tonight?

134
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,737
And whoever told her that she could get away

135
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,781
with those vertical stripes should be shot.

136
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:23,532
Oh.

137
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:26,326
Bye, sweetie.

138
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:53,729
Zach is back!

139
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:55,814
Yeah, yeah, I know.

140
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,316
You do?

141
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,943
Yeah, he's been back for a couple of days now.

142
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:01,987
Well, that's great, isn't it?

143
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,323
Yeah.

144
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,741
I thought you'd be happy about it.

145
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,075
I thought that's what you wanted.

146
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:09,036
I was hoping that I'd slowly establish

147
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,162
a relationship with Zach

148
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:11,705
and then when we were comfortable,

149
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,165
I'd tell him I was his real dad.

150
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:14,333
But now paul's back.

151
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,336
And he doesn't want you anywhere near him.

152
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,754
He's threatened to tell the police

153
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:20,380
everything that happened in the desert-

154
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:22,174
that I held a gun to his head.

155
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:23,884
Well, it's your word against his.

156
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:27,888
But he doesn't have a record, and I do.

157
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,474
You know, despite what I did-

158
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:31,850
sending Zach away,

159
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,519
I want you two to connect.

160
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,812
I hope you know that.

161
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,981
I do.

162
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:40,025
And on the bright side,

163
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:44,238
I don't have to wonder where he is anymore.

164
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:51,453
It says that you can do a report on anything

165
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:53,080
from the suggested reading list,

166
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,165
which includes "the old man and the sea,"

167
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:56,124
"the pearl,"

168
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,751
"much ado about nothing. "

169
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,211
Hmm.

170
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:01,547
That sounds good. What do you like?

171
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,674
I don't care.

172
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,844
Let's start with "the pearl. "

173
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:08,762
It's got a sad ending, but it's good.

174
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,597
We'll start with that.

175
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:14,601
You know,

176
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:16,603
it's not gonna be so bad.

177
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:21,191
but maybe next time you could try juggling instead.

178
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:22,860
Okay,

179
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:25,195
I know this isn't what you want.

180
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:27,489
But I need to keep you close to me

181
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:29,032
just for a while.

182
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:30,909
There are people in this neighborhood

183
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,744
who aren't thrilled that we're back.

184
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,873
People I don't trust.

185
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:39,918
People like... Mike Delfino?

186
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,503
Why would you say that?

187
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:43,005
When you disappeared,

188
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:47,467
Mrs. Tillman said that Mike took you somewhere to kill you.

189
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:50,053
That's ridiculous. Why would mike wanna kill me?

190
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:53,724
Because you murdered Mrs. Huber?

191
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:54,683
What did you say?

192
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:57,561
Well, Mrs. Tillman said that you murdered Mrs. Huber

193
00:07:57,603 --> 00:08:00,063
because she was blackmailing mom.

194
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:01,356
And you believed her?

195
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,275
No, not exactly.

196
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:05,819
I mean, why? Should I?

197
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,655
Zach, you know me

198
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:11,408
better than anyone.

199
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:16,705
Do you honestly believe that I am capable of murder?

200
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:18,248
No.

201
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:21,293
All right, then.

202
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:23,795
Of course...

203
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:28,008
I didn't think mom was capable of suicide, either.

204
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:30,928
On second thought,

205
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:34,473
why don't we start with "much ado about nothing"?

206
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:37,935
I think we could use a few laughs around here.

207
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,396
Yeah, man...

208
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:44,274
yeah, he sure is. I just...

209
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:46,985
- Probably.
- Yeah.

210
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:00,833
Hey.

211
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:03,252
Get over here. Now.

212
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:06,338
Somebody's angry.

213
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,882
Did one of your soufflés fall?

214
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,843
I saw what you did with your friend.

215
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:14,096
Oh, and you didn't turn into a pillar of salt. Good for you.

216
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:15,806
This is not a joke, Andrew.

217
00:09:15,806 --> 00:09:17,808
What if the neighbors had seen you?

218
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:20,936
Well, I'd hope they'd think that I'd landed a hottie.

219
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:22,229
I may not be able to control

220
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:23,522
what you do outside of this home,

221
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:24,815
but while you are under this roof,

222
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:26,942
you will not mock my values.

223
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:29,319
If you so much as smile at that boy,

224
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:31,822
so help me, I will ship you off to Camp Hennessey

225
00:09:31,864 --> 00:09:34,283
and I will not pick you up again until you are 18.

226
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:37,494
Do I make myself clear?

227
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,957
Aren't you forgetting something?

228
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:45,878
I know you like to knock a few back before bedtime.

229
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,881
Go on, take it. It's okay.

230
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,842
We both know that of the two of us,

231
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:54,761
I'm the one that doesn't judge.

232
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:10,777
Please. I don't wanna stay down here.

233
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,155
I- I know.

234
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:15,616
I'm sorry, K.

235
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:18,035
I'm sorry.

236
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,082
Matthew, I think we might have termites.

237
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,876
You need to take a look at those steps

238
00:10:25,918 --> 00:10:29,213
before one of us breaks our neck.

239
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:31,131
What's the matter? Is your brother okay?

240
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:33,675
No, he's not. He hates it down here.

241
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:36,845
He wants to be with us. You're being cruel.

242
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:38,722
If you are so concerned about him,

243
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:41,308
you should spend less time on your computer

244
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,936
and more time down here keeping him company.

245
00:10:43,936 --> 00:10:45,479
We're bringing him up,

246
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:49,274
but not until I am sure that it's safe.

247
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:53,070
there's been a load of compromising

248
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:57,991
on the road to my horizon.

249
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:05,749
Hey, you!

250
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:09,711
Like a rhinestone cowboy

251
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,589
yeah?

252
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:14,216
What's the deal?

253
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:16,718
You've been parked on our street for two hours.

254
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,971
Oh, I'm doing a property appraisal.

255
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,431
Some neighbors of your sare thinking about moving.

256
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:23,016
The Applewhites?

257
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:24,977
I'm not really allowed to say.

258
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:28,647
I sold them that house. You know, this is my turf!

259
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:29,898
Who do you work for?

260
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,191
Geist realty?

261
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:33,902
Ah, westside properties.

262
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:35,529
Yeah, well, whoever it is, you go back

263
00:11:35,571 --> 00:11:38,115
and you tell your bosses that nobody, and I mean, nobody,

264
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:40,367
buys or sells properties in this neighborhood

265
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:42,619
without going through Edie Britt, you got that?

266
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:44,413
Look, lady, I just go where I'm told.

267
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:47,124
You look, you cross me,

268
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:51,295
and I will be your worst nightmare.

269
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:56,383
I'm a dangerous woman. You don't wanna mess with me.

270
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:59,428
You got it.

271
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,816
Ms. Mayer?

272
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:14,401
Zach. May I talk to you?

273
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:17,154
I have some things that I need to say.

274
00:12:17,196 --> 00:12:18,113
Okay.

275
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:20,741
I- I know that I did a lot of bad stuff-

276
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,410
stuff that I'm not gonna be able to take back.

277
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:26,038
Ms. Mayer, I'm-I'm really sorry.

278
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,831
But when I was living on the streets, you know,

279
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:30,918
I had a lot of time to-to just sit and think to myself

280
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,961
and clear my head and...

281
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:35,255
I've grown up, you know? I don't want you to worry.

282
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:38,467
I'm not gonna be bothering you anymore.

283
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:41,762
Either of you.

284
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:45,933
Well, thanks. We appreciate that.

285
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:49,686
Please don't tell my dad that I talked to you.

286
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:52,147
He's just-he's been really...

287
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:56,151
intense lately.

288
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:02,199
Well, what do you think?

289
00:13:02,241 --> 00:13:04,243
He seems different.

290
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:05,661
I believe him.

291
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,120
Yeah, I can't believe I'm about to say this,

292
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:09,289
but I feel sorry for him.

293
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:11,416
It's like he's so fragile.

294
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:14,711
I know, and he's locked in that house with mr. Creepy 24/7.

295
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:18,340
Did you know that he's homeschooling Zach now?

296
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:20,717
I think he should spend some time

297
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:23,095
with a decent role model, don't you?

298
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:29,935
Hi!

299
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:31,854
Hey, you're out early.

300
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:32,855
Oh, I just wanted to pick up

301
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:34,857
some fresh croissants for breakfast.

302
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:37,609
Oh, cool. Listen, I just wanted you to know

303
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:40,320
I appreciated youbacking me up last night,

304
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:43,323
you know, with the kiss thing.

305
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:45,576
To be honest, I don't think I would've liked it, either.

306
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:48,078
Yeah, but I probably should've just gone with it.

307
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:50,747
Gaby was just being Gaby-having fun.

308
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:55,210
No, I wouldn't be so hard on yourself, given her history.

309
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:56,336
What do you mean?

310
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:57,671
You know, the affair.

311
00:13:57,713 --> 00:13:59,381
Gaby had an affair?

312
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,341
- You didn't know?
- No!

313
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,218
I thought everybody knew.

314
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,762
Oh, I feel awful.

315
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:08,307
Oh, Ida Greenberg's behind you.

316
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:11,185
Ida, just a second.

317
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:12,811
I am stunned.

318
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:14,396
Who was it with?

319
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:16,565
I shouldn'thave said anything.

320
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:18,734
Bree, come on, just tell me.

321
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:23,322
her gardener.

322
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:25,866
Oh, you're kidding!

323
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:29,244
No, no, not him. Helen Rowland's son, John.

324
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:31,622
The teenager?

325
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:34,374
Ida, wait, or go around!

326
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:37,127
Does Gaby know that you know?

327
00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:38,337
Absolutely not.

328
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,379
I think the best thing to do

329
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:43,383
is just smile and pretend you don't know anything.

330
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:00,192
Hi.

331
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:02,945
Oh, sorry!

332
00:15:02,945 --> 00:15:05,614
Are you okay?

333
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:07,574
Yeah.

334
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:09,409
I'm all right.

335
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:11,161
What's up?

336
00:15:11,203 --> 00:15:14,498
We have an idea how to bring you and Zach together.

337
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,792
Bowling.

338
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:18,585
- Bowling?
- Yeah, I e-mailed Zach,

339
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:20,379
and he said he's gonna meet us there.

340
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,505
You can come, too.

341
00:15:21,547 --> 00:15:22,798
Does paul know about this?

342
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,927
No, and we're not planning on telling him.

343
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:30,973
I don't think that's a good idea, Susan.

344
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:34,309
Mike, I'm part of the reason things got so screwed up.

345
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:36,895
I just want a chance to make things right.

346
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:39,439
And you're okay with this-being around Zach?

347
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:42,568
We talked to him. He's changed.

348
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:48,448
Well, I guess we're going bowling.

349
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:51,326
Wake up, sleepyhead.

350
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:54,872
I brought fresh croissants for breakfast!

351
00:16:02,588 --> 00:16:05,215
Uh, hi, mrs. van de Kamp.

352
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:09,469
I'm just in, Andrew's lab partner...

353
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:11,305
from school.

354
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:13,140
Dude, wake up.

355
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:15,225
Andrew...

356
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:18,937
I want you downstairs... now.

357
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:30,199
Okay, first of all, I want you to march back upstairs

358
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,285
and tell your friend he is no longer welcome in this house.

359
00:16:33,285 --> 00:16:34,244
But we haven't even had breakfast yet!

360
00:16:34,286 --> 00:16:35,412
I am serious, Andrew.

361
00:16:35,454 --> 00:16:37,039
You tell himto get out of here this second

362
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,707
or I will call the police,

363
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:40,334
and I will have him removed!

364
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:42,169
Well, go ahead, call 'em.

365
00:16:42,211 --> 00:16:43,962
Oh, you think I won't?

366
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:45,672
I just wonder how they'll react

367
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:48,884
when they find out that you killed George Williams.

368
00:16:50,594 --> 00:16:52,638
I didn't kill George.

369
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,848
Well, no, but you sat there and let him die,

370
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:57,017
which, I'm no lawyer, but I'm pretty sure

371
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:58,977
there's a crime in there somewhere.

372
00:16:59,019 --> 00:16:59,978
Andrew...

373
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,648
Don't get me wrong. I mean, I'm glad you did it.

374
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:06,735
But when the cops get here, my official position will be,

375
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:10,822
uh, "oh, my God, I'm being raised by a homicidal maniac."

376
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:13,784
I think I might even throw in a few tears.

377
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:15,494
You would actually let the police

378
00:17:15,536 --> 00:17:17,246
arrest your own mother?

379
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:22,042
Hey, we all gotta cut the apron strings at some point.

380
00:17:29,967 --> 00:17:33,720
Come on, penny. Let's get those groceries in there.

381
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:36,932
Come on. Here we go. Get this one...

382
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:40,060
and this one, and daddy-uh-oh! Whoa!

383
00:17:40,853 --> 00:17:41,854
Oh!

384
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:44,273
Oh, it looks like you could use a hand.

385
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:47,025
Bless you. Here, Gaby.

386
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,902
And Penny!

387
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:51,697
Oh, come here, you sweet little thing.

388
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:54,449
Well, thank you so much, Gaby. Come on in.

389
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:56,702
Oh, God, um, Tom?

390
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,662
Yeah?

391
00:17:58,704 --> 00:18:00,747
Uh, I think she got sick.

392
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:02,457
Oh, I'm so sorry.

393
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:06,086
Usually, she only throws up on immediate family.

394
00:18:06,128 --> 00:18:07,838
I'm honored.

395
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,925
oh, um, do you mind just putting her in the playpen there?

396
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:14,887
Hello.

397
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:17,681
Guess what? Ed loved the pitch. I got off early!

398
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:19,266
You're kidding! That's great!

399
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:20,601
Hey, I'm right by the supermarket.

400
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:22,019
You want me to pick up anything?

401
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,770
Um, actually, I just came from there.

402
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:25,439
Except, you know what? I forgot bread.

403
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,982
- Would you mind?
- Not at all.

404
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:29,193
Tom, I need to wipe up. Do you have a towel?

405
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:31,486
Sure, hold on.

406
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:41,246
Hey!

407
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:42,998
Hey, honey.

408
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,124
Hey, did you get the bread?

409
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,460
Oh, yeah, they were out.

410
00:18:46,502 --> 00:18:47,252
Of bread?

411
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:49,254
Yeah. Hey, Gaby.

412
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:50,964
A surprise seeing you here.

413
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:52,633
Well, I saw that Tom was overwhelmed,

414
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:55,886
so I thoughtI'd give him a hand.

415
00:18:55,928 --> 00:18:59,097
Really? Wow, that was nice of you.

416
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:01,600
Is there a problem?

417
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,644
No.

418
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:07,731
Really?

419
00:19:07,773 --> 00:19:09,191
Because I sense that you're annoyed

420
00:19:09,233 --> 00:19:12,945
you found me here when you weren't home. Am I wrong?

421
00:19:15,531 --> 00:19:18,116
Lynette?

422
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:20,661
Okay. yeah.

423
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:24,206
So exactly what are you doing here helping out?

424
00:19:24,248 --> 00:19:26,333
Damn it, Lynette, if this has to do with that stupid kiss

425
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,418
the other night, I'm gonna lose it!

426
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,420
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what's going on?

427
00:19:30,462 --> 00:19:32,881
Lynette thinks I was hitting on you at Bree's party.

428
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:34,258
that's ridiculous.

429
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:35,551
I never said that.

430
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:37,803
What I said was that it made me uncomfortable

431
00:19:37,845 --> 00:19:38,929
when you kissed him.

432
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:40,639
It's obviously an issue for me.

433
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:44,059
And yet, here you are, alone in my kitchen with my husband.

434
00:19:44,101 --> 00:19:46,270
So you tell me, are you hitting on him?

435
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,229
Lynette.

436
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:49,147
I can't believe you. I have done nothing

437
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:51,441
to deserve this kind of mistrust.

438
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:53,694
Well, that's not entirely true.

439
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:54,736
What does that mean?

440
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:56,572
Come on, Gaby.

441
00:19:56,613 --> 00:20:00,075
It's a small town. People talk.

442
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,998
Okay, what's going on here?

443
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:08,250
I'll tell you.

444
00:20:08,292 --> 00:20:10,043
Your wife doesn't trust me around you

445
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:14,464
because I had an affair with my teenage gardener.

446
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:20,846
Oh.

447
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:25,392
So I know Susan Mayer would never tell.

448
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:27,060
It must've been Helen Rowland.

449
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:29,229
She probably blabbed to all the girls at the salon.

450
00:20:29,271 --> 00:20:31,064
And Ida Greenberg goes to that salon.

451
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:32,816
So if Ida knows, the whole town knows.

452
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:36,195
And we're just gonna have to move. That's all there is to it.

453
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:38,864
Carlos, can you stop putting for two seconds

454
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:40,657
and show me some support?

455
00:20:40,699 --> 00:20:42,951
What do you expect me to do? You brought this on yourself.

456
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:44,620
It was a harmless little kiss!

457
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:47,206
Why is everybody making a big deal about this?

458
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:50,042
Because you had an affair with an underage gardener.

459
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:51,668
People don't think you're harmless.

460
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:54,087
They see you as a predator.

461
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:55,547
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

462
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:58,675
Punishing me, dangling the affair over my head?

463
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:01,762
Well, I won't tolerate it.

464
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:04,973
Really?

465
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:08,602
So just what are you gonna do about it?

466
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:14,316
I'm gonna let you even the score.

467
00:21:14,358 --> 00:21:16,151
Carlos, go have an affair.

468
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:17,110
What?

469
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:18,612
I had my little indiscretion.

470
00:21:18,654 --> 00:21:20,739
So you go have yours. Get it out of your system.

471
00:21:20,781 --> 00:21:22,950
- I know you want to.
- I do not.

472
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:25,077
Sure you do. Knock yourself out.

473
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:29,039
Call up an old college flame. Rent a call girl.

474
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,249
Fly to Africa

475
00:21:30,249 --> 00:21:33,836
and nail that little nun you've been drooling over.

476
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:35,045
I don't care!

477
00:21:35,087 --> 00:21:36,964
You're crazy.

478
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:38,799
No, I'm pragmatic.

479
00:21:38,841 --> 00:21:40,676
Because once you finish your fling,

480
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:42,177
we'll be equals again.

481
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:44,638
And then you won'tbe able to judge me.

482
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,597
And we can go back to being

483
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:48,016
a boring, average married couple.

484
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:52,646
Oh, just do me a favor. Don't bring back any diseases.

485
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:58,861
Are you sure you're not overreacting

486
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:01,029
to this whole Gabrielle thing?

487
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:03,073
Maybe.

488
00:22:03,115 --> 00:22:05,075
Yes.

489
00:22:05,117 --> 00:22:09,121
But Gaby doesn't think she did anything wrong.

490
00:22:09,121 --> 00:22:11,915
That's not right, either.

491
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:13,792
I guess.

492
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:15,210
You're an attractive man.

493
00:22:15,252 --> 00:22:19,339
There is a primal need fora woman to protect what is hers.

494
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:22,801
My initial impulse was justified.

495
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:27,055
So you really think she's into me?

496
00:22:27,097 --> 00:22:29,516
I don't know.

497
00:22:29,558 --> 00:22:32,895
Because you're right. I am an attractive man.

498
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:34,605
You know what? I've never told you this,

499
00:22:34,605 --> 00:22:36,982
but sometimes when I bend down to pick up the morning paper,

500
00:22:37,024 --> 00:22:40,611
I catch Bree van de Kamp checking me out.

501
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:42,029
You're kidding.

502
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,405
No, scout's honor.

503
00:22:43,447 --> 00:22:46,158
I've always exuded a certain sexual magnetism,

504
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,534
and as I get older,

505
00:22:47,576 --> 00:22:50,245
I think it's only becoming more intense.

506
00:22:50,287 --> 00:22:51,538
Are you drunk?

507
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:53,832
Oh, I'm a hot guy living in a neighborhood

508
00:22:53,874 --> 00:22:56,126
filled with nothing but lonely ladies.

509
00:22:56,168 --> 00:22:56,627
Oh.

510
00:22:56,668 --> 00:23:01,423
They can't help themselves. I'm like... catnip.

511
00:23:01,757 --> 00:23:03,926
Come here.

512
00:23:04,676 --> 00:23:05,511
What was that for?

513
00:23:05,552 --> 00:23:07,137
Thank you. Thank you for reminding me

514
00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:09,389
that I am the only woman in the whole world

515
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:14,228
who could love an idiot like you.

516
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:17,314
- I'll talk to Gaby.
- I'm telling you,

517
00:23:17,314 --> 00:23:19,024
- these women want me.
- Oh, yeah.

518
00:23:19,024 --> 00:23:21,527
They see the rippling muscle sunderneath this t-shirt...

519
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:23,111
Good night, Tom.

520
00:23:23,153 --> 00:23:24,863
They cannot resist me.

521
00:23:24,905 --> 00:23:26,615
Shut up and go to sleep.

522
00:23:26,657 --> 00:23:28,033
Aah!

523
00:24:24,006 --> 00:24:26,216
Son of a bitch.

524
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:39,062
You gotta be kidding me.

525
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:42,608
Whoa, whoa.

526
00:24:42,608 --> 00:24:45,652
I'm here to help you, Caleb.

527
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:47,946
All right?

528
00:24:51,074 --> 00:24:53,160
Mama's gon' be mad.

529
00:24:53,202 --> 00:24:56,163
Don't you worry about that.

530
00:24:57,456 --> 00:25:00,042
Moms love me.

531
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:04,296
All right, let's go.

532
00:25:04,338 --> 00:25:05,464
No!

533
00:25:10,219 --> 00:25:13,388
Okay, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have talked to you like that.

534
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:16,850
Let's start over.

535
00:25:16,892 --> 00:25:17,935
Aah!

536
00:25:31,615 --> 00:25:33,867
Let's go.

537
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:37,746
I'm warning you, pinhead,

538
00:25:37,746 --> 00:25:41,458
don't you make me come down there after you.

539
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,002
Come on.

540
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:46,463
Come on!

541
00:25:48,632 --> 00:25:50,717
All right, you asked for it.

542
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:53,428
I'm gonna beat the stupid right out of you.

543
00:26:13,991 --> 00:26:17,119
This hit the spot.

544
00:26:25,586 --> 00:26:27,546
Caleb?

545
00:26:27,588 --> 00:26:30,048
I didn't do it.

546
00:26:42,227 --> 00:26:44,188
Oh, dear.

547
00:26:53,822 --> 00:26:55,407
Well, hey there.

548
00:26:55,449 --> 00:26:56,992
Hi, Karl. Oh!

549
00:26:58,076 --> 00:27:00,245
Oh, um, quick question-

550
00:27:00,287 --> 00:27:02,956
when someone discusses a sensitive situation

551
00:27:02,998 --> 00:27:05,667
with a lawyer such as yourself,

552
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:09,004
when does attorney/client confidentiality kick in?

553
00:27:09,046 --> 00:27:11,381
From the moment the lawyer's been hired. Why?

554
00:27:11,423 --> 00:27:12,466
Here's a check for $100.

555
00:27:12,466 --> 00:27:15,302
That's enough for a retainer, right?

556
00:27:15,886 --> 00:27:17,262
Well, I guess. What's going on, Bree?

557
00:27:17,304 --> 00:27:19,348
My son is trying to blackmail me.

558
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:22,059
And I want you to stop the little S.O.B.

559
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:25,229
Do you think you could do that?

560
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:29,858
He has an Illinois license.

561
00:27:29,858 --> 00:27:32,611
It says here his name is Munroe.

562
00:27:32,611 --> 00:27:36,573
Does that name mean anything to you?

563
00:27:36,615 --> 00:27:40,494
No, but at leas the wasn't a policeman.

564
00:27:43,247 --> 00:27:44,540
Poor man.

565
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:47,584
I hope he didn't suffer too much.

566
00:27:48,544 --> 00:27:52,214
Mom, are we looking at the same body?

567
00:28:10,524 --> 00:28:13,026
What is it?

568
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,453
As soon as it gets dark,

569
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:25,706
we get rid of that body.

570
00:28:29,835 --> 00:28:31,295
Hey.

571
00:28:31,461 --> 00:28:33,505
Um...

572
00:28:33,505 --> 00:28:36,633
I hope it's okay. Carlos let me in.

573
00:28:36,675 --> 00:28:38,302
Actually, I'm right in the middle of something,

574
00:28:38,343 --> 00:28:41,430
and I don't know when I'll be done.

575
00:28:44,016 --> 00:28:47,853
I'm just here to say I am sorry,

576
00:28:47,853 --> 00:28:51,648
and I have been a complete idiot.

577
00:28:54,568 --> 00:28:56,195
All done.

578
00:29:00,991 --> 00:29:03,869
So cute. 'Cause it's beautiful!

579
00:29:03,911 --> 00:29:05,370
Is the coast clear?

580
00:29:05,412 --> 00:29:07,206
Yes, it is. We worked it out.

581
00:29:07,247 --> 00:29:09,208
No kidding. How'd you manage that one?

582
00:29:09,249 --> 00:29:13,170
Simple. Lynette admitted she was wrong, and I agreed.

583
00:29:13,545 --> 00:29:15,797
Well, 99% wrong.

584
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:18,008
Oh, whatever, close enough.

585
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:20,969
Anyway, Tom's probably got dinner ready by now.

586
00:29:21,011 --> 00:29:22,763
So I should get goin'.

587
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:23,847
Okay.

588
00:29:23,889 --> 00:29:27,017
Good night. Bye! Mwah!

589
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,773
You know what the 1% is, right?

590
00:29:32,814 --> 00:29:34,691
No, not really.

591
00:29:34,733 --> 00:29:36,276
Does it matter?

592
00:29:36,318 --> 00:29:37,819
It kinda does.

593
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:41,824
I wanna get it clear for our friendship.

594
00:29:41,824 --> 00:29:43,617
Okay.

595
00:29:43,617 --> 00:29:45,661
What's the 1%?

596
00:29:45,702 --> 00:29:47,621
Well, well...

597
00:29:47,663 --> 00:29:49,373
Yes, I overreacted.

598
00:29:49,414 --> 00:29:51,041
I think you can see

599
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:54,211
how even thoughI was somewhat off base,

600
00:29:54,253 --> 00:29:57,548
you were a little wrong, right?

601
00:29:57,589 --> 00:30:00,592
No. I kissed Tom, and it was a harmless joke.

602
00:30:00,634 --> 00:30:03,637
I think if I had kissed anybody else's husband,

603
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:04,429
they would've laughed

604
00:30:04,471 --> 00:30:07,349
and then forgot about it ten seconds later.

605
00:30:07,391 --> 00:30:11,812
Okay, let's test that theory.

606
00:30:16,483 --> 00:30:18,735
See? I don't care.

607
00:30:19,611 --> 00:30:24,575
That's... just a waste of time...

608
00:30:24,616 --> 00:30:28,078
and spit.

609
00:30:30,622 --> 00:30:31,790
Oh. Okay.

610
00:30:31,832 --> 00:30:33,625
Okay, okay, okay.

611
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:35,252
Okay! Okay!

612
00:30:36,336 --> 00:30:37,713
I get your point.

613
00:30:37,713 --> 00:30:40,132
All righty, then, my work here is done.

614
00:30:40,174 --> 00:30:42,426
Carlos, Gaby.

615
00:30:50,434 --> 00:30:52,311
Go!

616
00:30:52,352 --> 00:30:54,438
Not bad.

617
00:30:55,105 --> 00:30:57,482
Hey, there he is.

618
00:30:57,524 --> 00:30:59,943
Zach, I'm glad you could make it.

619
00:30:59,985 --> 00:31:01,528
Hey, Zach.

620
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:04,448
Mr. Delfino, I didn't know you were gonna be here.

621
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:07,451
Yeah, I was just bowling a few frames and ran into these guys.

622
00:31:07,493 --> 00:31:10,245
I thought I might join you. Is, uh, that okay?

623
00:31:10,287 --> 00:31:12,831
Yeah, I guess.

624
00:31:17,002 --> 00:31:18,086
Oh!

625
00:31:18,837 --> 00:31:21,006
Okay, write that down-nine!

626
00:31:21,048 --> 00:31:22,174
Wise guy.

627
00:31:22,883 --> 00:31:25,844
All right, just roll it in there nice and easy.

628
00:31:35,896 --> 00:31:36,647
Sorry.

629
00:31:36,688 --> 00:31:38,357
It's okay. We're still close.

630
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:40,609
Anyway, Julie's totally gonna choke.

631
00:31:40,651 --> 00:31:43,111
Just for that, I am not bringing you back a hot dog.

632
00:31:43,153 --> 00:31:44,613
Zach, do you want one?

633
00:31:44,655 --> 00:31:46,240
Okay.

634
00:31:56,834 --> 00:31:58,085
You okay?

635
00:31:58,126 --> 00:32:00,796
Yeah, I'm fine, it's just...

636
00:32:00,838 --> 00:32:03,423
I don't understand what you're doing.

637
00:32:03,423 --> 00:32:04,591
What do you mean?

638
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:07,761
Well, I don't understand why you're being so nice to me.

639
00:32:07,803 --> 00:32:10,889
I mean, I pointed a gun at you guys. You should hate me.

640
00:32:13,267 --> 00:32:14,810
We don't hate you, Zach.

641
00:32:14,852 --> 00:32:17,229
You had an incredibly hard year.

642
00:32:17,271 --> 00:32:18,730
And you shouldn't have done what you did,

643
00:32:18,772 --> 00:32:22,150
but we just wanna help you move on.

644
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:23,610
Look, um...

645
00:32:24,444 --> 00:32:25,362
when I was young,

646
00:32:25,404 --> 00:32:27,281
I got mixed upin some really bad stuff.

647
00:32:27,322 --> 00:32:28,991
I even did some time in prison.

648
00:32:29,032 --> 00:32:30,659
- Really?
- Yeah, but when I got out,

649
00:32:30,701 --> 00:32:32,995
people were willing to forgive me.

650
00:32:33,036 --> 00:32:35,289
Everybody deserves a second chance.

651
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:36,623
Thanks.

652
00:32:38,458 --> 00:32:40,836
You know, I'm gonna go, uh, help Julie with the food.

653
00:32:40,878 --> 00:32:44,131
So you guys just keep talking and bowling.

654
00:32:44,173 --> 00:32:45,716
Talk and bowl.

655
00:32:45,757 --> 00:32:47,301
Bowl and talk.

656
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,928
Here, let me show you something.

657
00:32:50,637 --> 00:32:52,264
See the arrows right in the middle?

658
00:32:52,306 --> 00:32:54,558
Just roll it straight over the one in the center. Okay.

659
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,684
You don't have to spin itor anything.

660
00:32:55,726 --> 00:32:57,686
Just right down the middle.

661
00:33:01,899 --> 00:33:04,276
Look at that!

662
00:33:04,818 --> 00:33:06,695
Good job.

663
00:33:12,451 --> 00:33:13,368
Hurry up!

664
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:16,121
I am hurrying up, okay?

665
00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:18,832
Wait, no! No! No!

666
00:33:18,874 --> 00:33:20,959
- What?
- I dropped the keys.

667
00:33:21,001 --> 00:33:23,045
I don't have 'em. They're in here!

668
00:33:35,182 --> 00:33:38,393
sometimes you just have to laugh.

669
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,741
Andrew?

670
00:33:52,783 --> 00:33:55,118
Would you mind turning off your video game?

671
00:33:55,118 --> 00:33:58,872
My lawyer would like to have a little chat with you.

672
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:04,294
So even though your mother did witness George Williams' suicide,

673
00:34:04,336 --> 00:34:06,255
there's no affirmative duty to intervene.

674
00:34:06,296 --> 00:34:07,840
Therefore, no crime was committed.

675
00:34:07,881 --> 00:34:09,675
Even if the police find out,

676
00:34:09,716 --> 00:34:13,303
your mom will never see the inside of a courtroom.

677
00:34:13,345 --> 00:34:16,431
Well, maybe I got the story wrong.

678
00:34:16,473 --> 00:34:20,853
What if she went over there to help him commit suicide?

679
00:34:20,853 --> 00:34:23,063
If you wanna lie to the police, go right ahead.

680
00:34:23,105 --> 00:34:25,816
But please know that I will sue you.

681
00:34:25,816 --> 00:34:26,567
For what?

682
00:34:26,567 --> 00:34:27,901
Abuse of process.

683
00:34:27,943 --> 00:34:30,070
It's when a person tries to exploit the legal system

684
00:34:30,112 --> 00:34:33,323
for an improper purpose-like blackmail.

685
00:34:33,365 --> 00:34:36,535
You guys can't sue me. I'm just a kid.

686
00:34:36,577 --> 00:34:37,119
Oh, don't worry.

687
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:40,539
I won't start garnishing your wages until you turn 18.

688
00:34:40,581 --> 00:34:44,501
Your mom- is she a peach or what?

689
00:34:45,127 --> 00:34:47,462
If the cops don't give a damn, I'm sure your friends will.

690
00:34:47,504 --> 00:34:52,050
How does a little public humiliation sound?

691
00:34:53,343 --> 00:34:56,471
Bree, can I get a refill on this?

692
00:35:02,936 --> 00:35:04,479
What are you doing?!

693
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:06,023
Your father was a friend of mine.

694
00:35:06,064 --> 00:35:09,026
And if he were around to see what a nasty little turd

695
00:35:09,026 --> 00:35:11,987
you've turned into, he'd knock the hell out of you.

696
00:35:11,987 --> 00:35:15,699
Yeah, well, he's not here now, is he?

697
00:35:15,741 --> 00:35:18,619
No, he isn't, but if you don't get your act together

698
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:21,497
and start treating your mother with some respect,

699
00:35:21,538 --> 00:35:24,666
I'll take care of you myself.

700
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:27,628
Do you understand what I'm saying?

701
00:35:28,212 --> 00:35:30,380
Yeah.

702
00:35:30,422 --> 00:35:32,508
Good.

703
00:35:39,723 --> 00:35:41,433
Hey, neighbor.

704
00:35:41,475 --> 00:35:43,143
Oh, hey, Carlos.

705
00:35:43,185 --> 00:35:44,019
Hi.

706
00:35:44,019 --> 00:35:47,314
I just wanted to thank you for patching things up with Gaby.

707
00:35:47,356 --> 00:35:49,608
Well, sure, no problem.

708
00:35:49,608 --> 00:35:51,568
It's been really tough on her-

709
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:53,111
everybody finding out about the affair.

710
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:57,199
Yeah, I can imagine.

711
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:59,576
I don't mind telling you, it's, uh...

712
00:35:59,618 --> 00:36:01,829
it's been pretty tough on us the past couple months.

713
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:03,872
Oh, well, I'm not surprised,

714
00:36:03,914 --> 00:36:06,166
and I really, really hope you can work it out.

715
00:36:06,208 --> 00:36:08,877
Yeah, we're trying. You know...

716
00:36:08,919 --> 00:36:11,547
Mm-hmm? Yeah?

717
00:36:11,588 --> 00:36:13,841
Gaby had an interesting suggestion.

718
00:36:13,841 --> 00:36:15,425
Oh?

719
00:36:16,677 --> 00:36:18,303
She told me that I should go out

720
00:36:18,345 --> 00:36:19,471
and have an affair of my own.

721
00:36:19,513 --> 00:36:20,597
She thinks it's the only way

722
00:36:20,597 --> 00:36:23,725
I'll be able to get over what she did to me

723
00:36:23,767 --> 00:36:26,812
and that it just might help our marriage.

724
00:36:26,854 --> 00:36:28,814
Why are you telling me this?

725
00:36:28,856 --> 00:36:29,648
Uh...

726
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:32,818
I guess I just, uh...

727
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:37,906
wanted to know if you had any thoughts on the subject?

728
00:36:38,365 --> 00:36:41,076
I... don't.

729
00:36:41,118 --> 00:36:43,787
I really don't.

730
00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:48,834
Well, if you ever do, let me know.

731
00:36:49,585 --> 00:36:51,003
By the way...

732
00:36:51,044 --> 00:36:53,088
Mm-hmm?

733
00:36:53,505 --> 00:36:56,717
That was one hell of a kiss you gave me.

734
00:36:56,758 --> 00:37:00,012
You can't fake chemistry like that.

735
00:37:33,045 --> 00:37:35,714
What the hell is this?

736
00:37:47,351 --> 00:37:48,477
Delfino?

737
00:37:51,271 --> 00:37:53,273
Stay away from my son!

738
00:38:04,368 --> 00:38:06,537
Oh, my God!

739
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:15,671
Dad!

740
00:38:19,883 --> 00:38:21,176
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

741
00:38:21,218 --> 00:38:23,095
Aah!

742
00:38:44,908 --> 00:38:46,618
So I squirm to avoid hitting his car

743
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,662
and I hit Parker instead

744
00:38:48,662 --> 00:38:50,664
and that's from the trunk top open

745
00:38:50,706 --> 00:38:51,290
when we got out

746
00:38:51,331 --> 00:38:54,710
we found this dead body.

747
00:38:59,548 --> 00:39:02,009
Are you worried now

748
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:03,677
'cause I am.

749
00:39:04,678 --> 00:39:06,096
Not yet

750
00:39:06,138 --> 00:39:09,433
Let's be patient, see what will happens.

751
00:39:10,684 --> 00:39:12,019
How'd go.

752
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,604
Well I told them everything I know.

753
00:39:13,645 --> 00:39:15,772
which wasn't much

754
00:39:15,814 --> 00:39:17,482
so we thinking this is Paul.

755
00:39:17,524 --> 00:39:19,902
Well he's our friendly neighborhood murderer.

756
00:39:19,902 --> 00:39:21,195
Yes it seems obvious.

757
00:39:21,236 --> 00:39:22,321
I dont know.

758
00:39:22,362 --> 00:39:24,364
I saw his face when he looked into the trunk

759
00:39:24,406 --> 00:39:27,075
and he looked just as shocked as I was.

760
00:39:27,117 --> 00:39:29,745
I'm thinking it was the Applewhites.

761
00:39:30,287 --> 00:39:31,246
I talked to the dead guy.

762
00:39:31,288 --> 00:39:34,082
He said he was doing appraisal on their house.

763
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:35,584
I got a little cheesed

764
00:39:35,626 --> 00:39:37,836
so i called all the realtors in town.

765
00:39:37,878 --> 00:39:39,963
Nobody had even heard of him.

766
00:39:39,963 --> 00:39:42,007
That doesn't mean Betty knew him.

767
00:39:42,049 --> 00:39:43,717
Please.

768
00:39:43,717 --> 00:39:45,385
Those two were fishy

769
00:39:45,427 --> 00:39:47,596
They bought that house sightn unseen

770
00:39:47,638 --> 00:39:50,599
and they did move in the middle of the night

771
00:39:50,641 --> 00:39:53,352
and there were noises.

772
00:39:53,352 --> 00:39:54,603
What noises?

773
00:39:55,145 --> 00:39:56,688
A couple weeks ago

774
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:58,398
I heard some noises coming

775
00:39:58,398 --> 00:39:59,942
from the basement like cleaning.

776
00:39:59,942 --> 00:40:01,735
I asked betty about it.

777
00:40:01,777 --> 00:40:03,529
Ahe lied right to my face.

778
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:05,280
What's that about?

779
00:40:05,322 --> 00:40:07,866
I dont know.

780
00:40:17,376 --> 00:40:19,586
Now I am worried.

781
00:40:37,563 --> 00:40:39,648
Julie.

782
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,239
Hi.

783
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:49,283
Well my dad found out about us bowling.

784
00:40:49,324 --> 00:40:51,326
I cannot be able to do that anytime soon.

785
00:40:51,368 --> 00:40:54,371
Oh, sorry.

786
00:40:54,413 --> 00:40:55,789
No no I'm glad we did.

787
00:40:55,831 --> 00:40:59,459
I haven't felt like a part of a family in a long time.

788
00:40:59,501 --> 00:41:01,420
Thanks.

789
00:41:04,298 --> 00:41:06,925
I'd better go back inside.

790
00:41:09,219 --> 00:41:12,347
The act itself never varies,

791
00:41:12,389 --> 00:41:17,686
but each kiss carries a with it a meaning all it's own.

792
00:41:17,728 --> 00:41:23,192
It can convey a husband's eternal devotion

793
00:41:23,192 --> 00:41:27,488
or a wife's enormous regret.

794
00:41:30,616 --> 00:41:35,579
It can symbolize a mother's growing concern

795
00:41:38,373 --> 00:41:42,377
or a lover's growing passion,

796
00:41:43,754 --> 00:41:45,964
but whatever its meaning

797
00:41:46,006 --> 00:41:49,718
each kiss

798
00:41:49,718 --> 00:41:53,055
reflects a basic human need.

799
00:41:57,309 --> 00:42:03,148
The needs to connect to another human being.

800
00:42:04,775 --> 00:42:08,320
This desire is so strong

801
00:42:08,612 --> 00:42:11,990
it's always amazing when some people

802
00:42:13,158 --> 00:42:14,701
dont understand it.
