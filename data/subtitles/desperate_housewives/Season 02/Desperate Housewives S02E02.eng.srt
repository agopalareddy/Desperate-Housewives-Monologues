<i>The remarkable thing about Danny
Farrell was that he had only
been a paperboy for 6 months,</i>

20
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:59,852

had become the enemy of every

00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,033
Hey Suzie-cue.

What are you doing?

38
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:58,243
Just getting the paper.

39
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:01,455
That's Edie's paper. And this is Edie's house.

40
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:04,124
Do you have to do this now?
I haven't had my coffee yet.

41
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:08,128
Did you spend the night with Edie?!

42
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:10,839
Oh my God.

43
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,257
Suzie, just calm down.

44
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:16,261
You are forbidden from ever seeing her
again. You hear me? Forbidden!

45
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:20,224
We're divorced. You can't
tell me who I can date.

46
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:23,727
I live on this street.
Your daughter lives on this street.

47
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:27,022
I will not have you flaunting your
sexcapades in front of us!

48
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:29,650
Sexcapades?
- Forbidden!

49
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,945
I would love to continue this,
but it's time for breakfast.

50
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:36,949
And Edie is making me a frutada.

51
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:41,161
Well I just bet she is!

52
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,335
Mrs Meyer, I gotta talk to you.

53
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:49,920
Now's not a good time, Danny.

54
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,839
You're a month behing your payment.

55
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:53,632
I'll take care of it, I promise.

56

My dad says if you read
something you don't pay for,
that's the same as stealing.

57

Hi, Ida!

58
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,429
Can we talk about this later?

59
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:03,058
I just found out my ex is dating my neighbor,
and I'm really kicked off.

60
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:04,351
Same me!

61
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:08,355
I provide you with a service,
and I deserve to be paid for that service!

Don't worry. I have a system.

Really?

85
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:01,134
Yeah. Every two days, I clean.

86
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,928
Two days.

87
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:05,222
Yeah. Let the mess accumulate for two days,

88
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:07,224
and then I clean until it's sparkling,

89
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:10,352
and then the cycle starts all over again.

90
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:14,356
And why have I never seen the sparkling part?

91
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:18,026
'Cause by the time you get home from work,
the boys have messed everything up again.

92
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:22,030
See, that's what I would
call a flaw in the system.

93
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,949
What are you doing?

94
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:25,534
I think I'm asking you to clean the house.

95
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:27,828

How many times did I come home to a mess,
and I never said a word!

100
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:45,929
Please don't take this the wrong way.
I think you are doing a terrific job.

101
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:49,558
But let's be clear: When you came home,
it was just -

102
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:50,934
cluttered.

103
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:54,354
I mean, come on. This is -

104
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:58,358
more than that.

105
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:07,826
Look at him. Just chatting away.
So inconsiderate.

106
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:11,038
Phyllis, we've only been waiting
here for 2 minutes.

107
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,333
Told you when we left the house
that I needed to eat.

108
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,251
I have low blood sugar.

109
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:17,753
You wanna see me keel over?

110
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:19,046
No.

111
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:23,050
In theory.

112
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:28,138
By the way, Mrs van de Kamp -

113
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:30,432
I heard about your husband's passing.

114
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:31,934
I'm so sorry.

115
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:34,728
Dr van de Kamp was one of my favorite
customers. Truly.

116
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,522
That's very sweet of you, thank you.

117
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:39,024
I'm not just being polite, Mrs van de Kamp.

118
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:41,527
How are you feeling?

119
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:42,653
Well, Mr Pashmutt -

120
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:46,657
We are holding up as best we
can under the circumstances.

121
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:52,246
I'm sorry, this is Rex's mother, Phyllis.

122
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:53,956
I'm so sorry about your son.

123
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:55,123
Thank you.

124
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:58,460
You know, the hardest thing is to lose a child.

125
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,045
I can't even imagine.

126
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:02,047
Come on, Phyllis,
let's get you something to eat.

127
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:06,051
We had no warning. I was doing
dishes when I got the call.

128
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:08,428
Really?

129
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:12,432
Phyllis, there are people waiting, so -

130
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,561
Excuse me, I'm so sorry, but -

131
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:18,146
My son just passed away.

132
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,940
Oh, I'm so sorry!

133
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,735
Thank you. I was telling Mr Pashmutt here -

134
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:27,739
My life is - is over!

135
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:32,536
My life is over!

136
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:36,248
This is ridiculous, you know that?

137
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:37,332
Pen.

138
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:40,836
Don't you think I have better
things to do than to bring you your
checks every day?

139
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:43,422
Checks that I could be signing at home.

140
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:45,632
This one's dry.

141
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:49,261
You know, taking away my access to
our account, that's just vindictive.

142
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:50,637
Thank you.

143
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,348
You know how long it takes me to
schlepp out here to this hellhole?

144
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:56,560
Exactly. It's the only way I
can guarantee you come and visit me.

145
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,436
That's ridiculous.

146
00:07:57,436 --> 00:08:00,731
You're my husband, I love you.
Obviously I would come visit.

147
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:04,026
I thought it was obvious that
when you loved someone,
you wouldn't have an affair.

148
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:06,320
I was wrong, wasn't I?

149
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,323
I'm geting really tired of this song, Carlos.

150
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:11,033
Isn't it about time you forgave me?

151
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:13,327
You want my forgiveness, you got it.

152
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:15,037
My trust -

153
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:16,246
that you gonna have to earn.

154
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:17,539
Be careful, Carlos.

155
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:20,834
Up until now, I've been really
lonely in that big bed of ours.

156
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,921
But when you're rude to me,
it makes me wanna be not so lonely.

157
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:27,758
Comments like that are exactly why
you'll never again have access to my money.

158
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:29,426
Why are all rich men jerks?

159
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:33,430
Same reason all beautiful women are bitches.

160
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:38,143
So, same time tomorrow?

161
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:42,147
Sure, baby.

162
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:48,820
What do you mean, you know?
- I mean, I know.

163
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,822
What are you saying?
That your father actually told you

164
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:53,742
he was gonna be having a one night
stand with Edie Britt?

165
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:55,536
Uh Mom, this wasn't a one night stand.

166
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:58,121
He's been going out with Mrs Britt for
a few months now.

167
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,456
What?

168
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:01,250
How could you not tell me that?

169
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,837
We share everything, that's what we're
known for! That's our thing!

170
00:09:04,837 --> 00:09:06,755
Because I knew you'd wig out!

171
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:10,050
Besides, haven't you always told me to
respect people's privacy?

172
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,637
I'd never apply that concept to your
father's sex life, and you know it.

173
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:15,222
Are you done?
- No!

174
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:18,725
I have not even begun ripping
into Edie Britt yet!

175
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,645
Och, that peroxide vulture!

176
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:24,022
I just know, as sure as I am standing here,

177
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:27,442
that she went after your father
just to tick me off.

178
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,820
Wrong again.
- What?

179
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,030
He asked her out.
- You lie.

180
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,658
It's true.
He called her for a date 6 months ago.

181
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:37,661
The day after my birthday party.

182
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:39,538
The one at the piano bar?

183
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:42,249
Yeah.

184
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:43,625
What is it?

185
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:49,631
Oh, uh - your father just came over
that day and - told me some stuff.

186
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:54,428
Some stuff that I haven't - that I can't
tell you.

187
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:57,723
Wait. Whatever happened to you,
we share everything.

188
00:09:57,723 --> 00:10:01,560
Ain't that "our thing"? "What we're known for"?

189
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,230
Uhm - actually, I think what we're
known for is sharing clothes.

190
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:09,234
Yeah. I think that's our thing.

191
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:29,755
Why does he keep doing that?

192
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:32,257
He knows it's annoying.

193
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:34,635
He's just trying to get to us.

194
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:38,639
That one is working.

195
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:46,230
Knock it off down there,
do you hear what I'm saying?

196
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:50,234
Matthew. Matthew!

197
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:55,739
Sit down!

198
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:04,540
You know we don't talk to him.
That's part of his punishment.

199
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:10,629
How can you just sit here, hour after hour,
and listen to that?

200
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:16,552
Well, that's part of mine.

201
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:29,940
Carlos, what is this big emergency?

202
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,944
I had to cancel my hair appointment
with Eduardo today.

203
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:38,156
What is it?

204
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:40,242
I'm completely freaked out.

205
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:44,538
Why?

206
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:47,916
There's this guy, his name's Ritchie,

207
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,544
and he's been saying some stuff to me,

208
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:52,629
and I'm gone worried.

209
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,923
Honey, you and your macho pride.

210
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:58,218
Just tell him you're flattered,
but you don't swing that way.

211
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:01,722
He's not hitting on me, you idiot,
he's threatening me!

212
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:04,224
Really? How?

213
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:08,145
He said he's gonna beat me up unless
I come up with some money.

214
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:09,646
How much money?

215
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:10,522
$7,000.

216
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:11,815
$7,000?

217
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:13,525
Keep your voice down!

218
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:15,736
Why would he think you have that kind of money?

219
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:21,575
Because yesterday, in a visiting
room filled with criminals,
my wife referred to me as "a rich man".

220
00:12:21,617 --> 00:12:24,745
Oh, really? Sorry.

221
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:26,538
That's why I needed you to bring the checkbook.

222
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:30,209
He's actually willing to take a check?

223
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:35,547
No! You're gonna take the money to
his girlfriend,
and if she doesn't get it by tomorrow,

224
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:36,840
I'm screwed.

225
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,634
Honey, I think this is a mistake.

226
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:42,638
If we give in to extorsion,
the guy's just gonna keep coming
back for more money.

227
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:44,223
What choice do I have?

228
00:12:44,223 --> 00:12:45,807
You're a strong guy.

229
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:49,520
You went to college on an athletic
scholarship, for God's sakes.

230
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,524
Yeah, it was for golf!

231
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:03,617
You have all my pants.

232
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:07,120
Yeah, I know. Come on in.

233
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,124
I thought when I took my stuff
back to my house I got everything, but -

234
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:15,712
That's fine. They're in the garage.

235
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:22,135
So how've you been doing?
- Good, um -

236
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:26,723
Good.

237
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,308
I have a question for you.

238
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,434
Sure, what is it?

239
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:30,644
Where are we now?

240
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:31,645
Where are we?

241
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:32,312
Yeah.

242
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:36,316
We're not moving in together,
and we're not broken up, so -

243
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:41,738
where are we?

244
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:45,534
I don't know.

245
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:49,538
Since the guy who held me hostage
turned out to be your son,

246
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:53,834
logic dictates that I should move on...

247
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:55,711
Problem is -

248
00:13:55,711 --> 00:13:58,839
I'm crazy about you.

249
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:00,340
So...

250
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,844
So I'm thinking we should keep it casual.

251
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:06,513
Casual.

252
00:14:06,722 --> 00:14:10,726
What the hell does that mean, exactly, casual?

253
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:14,646
Uh, well -

254
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:18,650
I don't think there is anything wrong
with us seeing a movie once in a while.

255
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:23,447
Movie? OK. Is that it?

256
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:27,743
Jogging?

257
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:31,622
There's no law against jogging.

258
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:33,832
Anything else?

259
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:35,042
Shopping.

260
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:38,045
That's casual. That's fun.

261
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:39,755
Anything else we can do?

262
00:14:39,755 --> 00:14:43,717
Anything at all?

263
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:48,555
Mmmm, brunch. Brunch would be nice.

264
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,524
Sounds good to me.

265
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:08,951
Oh, I can do this. Take it one day at a time.

266
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:13,121
Yes. Oh, oh, OK.

267
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:19,419
Thanks so much for calling.

268
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:21,922
Who's that?

269
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:25,926
Oh, someone named Alan Henley.

270
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:28,345
My electrician?

271
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:30,639
How are you on the phone
sobbing to my electrician?

272
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,142
Oh, he called to offer you his condolences.

273
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:36,144
Then why didn't you put me on?

274
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:40,148
Oh, well, we got to talking,
and then he had to go.

275
00:15:40,232 --> 00:15:44,236
He had some very beautiful
things to say about Rex.

276
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:50,325
For God's sakes, Phyllis.
Don't you ever worry about dehydration?

277
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:53,245
Are you saying that I am too emotional?

278
00:15:53,245 --> 00:15:56,456
I am saying that even Italians
take a break now and again.

279
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:59,334
My son is dead!

280
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:00,752
I'm grieving!

281
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:02,421
So am I.

282
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:05,632
But no one would never know it with
your insistent caterwauling!

283
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,050
Bree!

284
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,720
People want to know how I'm doing,
but the minute they ask you,

285
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,724
you jump into the spotlight and they
forget all about me!

286
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:18,937
I need consoling too, Phyllis.
Have you ever thought of that?

287
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:22,733
I'm sorry.

288
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:25,235
It won't happen again.
- Thank you.

289
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:29,156
Of course, if you didn't constantly
suppress your emotions,

290
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:32,451
people wouldn't forget to console you.

291
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:33,744
Excuse me?

292
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:37,039
It's true. You're stolid to
the point of being cold.

293
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:39,416
I am not cold. I just -

294
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,919
I don't like public displays of emotion.

295
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:45,923
That's fine. But people wonder why they
haven't seen you cry.

296
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:52,554
Some people actually
wonder if you truly mourn Rex.

297
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,017
People have said that?

298
00:16:57,017 --> 00:17:01,021
A few, yes.

299
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:15,118
Excuse me, I'm looking for Rita Rivera?

300
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,042
Hi, are you Rita?

301
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:23,836
Yeah, who are you?

302
00:17:23,836 --> 00:17:26,839
I'm Gabrielle Solís.

303
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:30,843
Our husbands are roommates at the prison.

304
00:17:30,843 --> 00:17:32,928
Ritchie and I aren't married.

305
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:35,430
Oh, I see. Well,

306
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:39,351
your boyfriend asked my husband
to give this to you.

307
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:43,355
It's a - a sort of favor.

308
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:45,816
It's all there. $7,000.

309
00:17:45,816 --> 00:17:49,820
Son of a bitch!

310
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:58,245
Oh, don't even think about it.

311
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:03,917
Um - hello! Is there a problem?

312
00:18:06,712 --> 00:18:09,631
I want to ask you a question.
- OK.

313
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:11,216
This might seem kinda weird.

314
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:13,635
What do you think of my breasts?

315
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:14,219
Excuse me?

316
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:17,514
How do they look to you?

317
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:19,725
They're - they're nice.

318
00:18:19,725 --> 00:18:23,729
Thank you. I like them too.

319
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:29,443
You're right, that was weird.

320
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:32,446
You have no idea what this money is for,
do you?

321
00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:36,408
No. You seem to have - everything you need...

322
00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:39,745
Ritchie wants me to get a boob job.

323
00:18:39,745 --> 00:18:41,830
He wants 'em bigger.

324
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:45,834
He's obsessed with huge breasts.

325
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,216
So are you gonna do it?

326
00:18:52,216 --> 00:18:53,926
I told him if he came up with cash I would.

327
00:18:53,926 --> 00:18:57,930
I just never thought the moron would
actually come up with it.

328
00:19:00,516 --> 00:19:02,643
Not that it's any of my business, but -

329
00:19:02,643 --> 00:19:03,936
it's your body.

330
00:19:03,936 --> 00:19:06,939
I wouldn't change anything
unless I really wanted to.

331
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:08,732
If I don't do it, he'll leave me.

332
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:12,236
Honey, he's in jail. How far is he gonna go?

333
00:19:12,236 --> 00:19:14,530
Maybe it's time you stood up for yourself.

334
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:17,741
Tell him you don't need the surgery.

335
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:19,535
It's worth a shot.

336
00:19:19,535 --> 00:19:20,911
There you go.

337
00:19:20,911 --> 00:19:24,915
I'm so proud of you.

338
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:33,257
<i>When Lynette went back to work,</i>

339
00:19:33,257 --> 00:19:37,261
<i>she was aware her new job would be demanding.</i>

340
00:19:37,261 --> 00:19:41,265
<i>What she hadn't anticipated</i>

341
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:45,352
<i>was the nightshift.</i>

342
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:54,444
Hey, how are you.

343
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:56,864
Thought I heard you coming about an hour ago?

344
00:19:56,864 --> 00:20:00,659
I did. I had to load the dishwasher.

345
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:02,536
You didn't have to do that.

346
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:05,664
Yeah, I sort of did.

347
00:20:05,664 --> 00:20:08,458
I'm sorry. I've just fallen
behind with my housework.

348
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:12,129
I just had so many errands to run today.

349
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:15,549
I'll make up for it tomorrow, OK? I promise.

350
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:19,344
That's the beauty of my system. It's flexible.

351
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:23,348
You know, for the sake of our marriage,
please don't mention the system again.

352
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:24,933
I said I'm sorry.

353
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:26,143
What in the world -?

354
00:20:26,143 --> 00:20:28,937
Don't touch it. Penny had a little -

355
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:30,647
um, spitty up here on the sheet.

356
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:31,732
And you didn't change them?

357
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:33,358
The towel's very clean.

358
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:34,568
That's disgusting.

359
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:37,446
No, it's just a little milk
spit-up on the sheet.

360
00:20:37,446 --> 00:20:39,865
Please, I made a judgment call.
Please respect that.

361
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:42,159
No, I can't respect that, and do you know why?

362
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,744
It's stupid.

363
00:20:43,744 --> 00:20:45,454
I'm gonna get new sheets.

364
00:20:45,454 --> 00:20:49,041
We're not changing the sheets.

365
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,167
Why are you yelling at me?

366
00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:52,753
I'm not yelling at you,
and this is not about spit-up.

367
00:20:52,753 --> 00:20:53,337
Of course it is.

368
00:20:53,337 --> 00:20:55,130
No it isn't. It's about control.

369
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:58,467
And as you and I both know,
you have some issues in this area.

370
00:20:58,467 --> 00:21:01,637
Why are you fighting so hard
to sleep on baby vomit?

371
00:21:01,637 --> 00:21:03,931
I'm fighting for a principle.

372
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:07,059
Being too lazy to change the sheets
is not a principle.

373
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:08,936
You know what? You're not gonna win this one.

374
00:21:08,936 --> 00:21:12,940
So you better just crawl back into bed.
Let's go to sleep.

375
00:21:24,243 --> 00:21:28,247
No! Come on!

376
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,961
No, you come on! Just get off!

377
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:37,965
Mine! Mine! Mine!

378
00:21:55,357 --> 00:22:02,364
<i>Normally, Lynette would have
spent a sleepless night telling
herself she didn't have control issues.</i>

379
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:08,453
<i>But she couldn't.</i>

380
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:12,457
<i>She was too busy figuring out how
to bend Tom to her will.</i>

381
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:22,342
Hello?

382
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:26,346
Hi!

383
00:22:29,141 --> 00:22:32,060
Welcome to the promised land.

384
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:36,064
Go on! There.

385
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:40,360
Good job!

386
00:22:48,243 --> 00:22:50,746
Uh, Betty? Betty!

387
00:22:50,746 --> 00:22:54,333
Betty, can I ask you a question?

388
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:56,043
Of course.

389
00:22:56,043 --> 00:22:58,253
It's Susan, right?
- Yes, hi.

390
00:22:58,253 --> 00:23:01,757
I was just wondering, are you having
some remodeling done on your
house or something?

391
00:23:01,757 --> 00:23:05,761
No. Why?

392
00:23:05,844 --> 00:23:09,848
Well - I work at home, so I'm home a lot,

393
00:23:10,933 --> 00:23:13,435
and I just keep hearing these noises lately.

394
00:23:13,435 --> 00:23:16,438
It's hard to concentrate.

395
00:23:16,438 --> 00:23:18,440
Well, I haven't noticed anything.

396
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,734
Really?

397
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:23,028
It sounds like it's coming from your house.

398
00:23:23,028 --> 00:23:25,239
It's like a clanging, clanging -

399
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:29,243
There, that was it! Did you hear it?

400
00:23:29,243 --> 00:23:31,662
Oh. Yes.

401
00:23:31,662 --> 00:23:35,332
Matthew is very handy. He's always doing
part jobs around the house.

402
00:23:35,332 --> 00:23:37,835
I guess I just don't notice the noise anymore.

403
00:23:37,835 --> 00:23:41,630
Even at 2 o'clock in the morning?
Cause that's kinda hard to miss.

404
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,757
I'm so sorry.

405
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:46,051
Matthew is something of an insomniac, Susan.

406
00:23:46,051 --> 00:23:50,055
But I will talk to him,
and we'll put a stop to it.

407
00:23:50,848 --> 00:23:52,140
Good afternoon, Mrs Meyer.

408
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:56,144
Hi, Matthew.

409
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:02,234
Well, it was nice chatting with you, Susan.

410
00:24:06,738 --> 00:24:10,659
This is my 3rd phone call, Mr Flannery,
and if someone doesn't call me back soon,

411
00:24:10,659 --> 00:24:14,454
I'm going to be irritated.

412
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:16,165
Is everything all right?

413
00:24:16,165 --> 00:24:20,169
That darned insurance
company is dragging its heels on paying
Rex's policy, and I don't understand why.

414
00:24:20,836 --> 00:24:23,338
Well, he died unexpectedly.

415
00:24:23,338 --> 00:24:27,342
And that brings up a lot of questions.

416
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:31,430
It's probably easier when
people are just diseased.

417
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:36,560
Probably.

418
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,354
Hi. Hi.
- Hi, Lynette.

419
00:24:39,354 --> 00:24:40,439
I'm sorry. Am I interrupting?

420
00:24:40,439 --> 00:24:41,732
No, not at all.

421
00:24:41,732 --> 00:24:45,736
I saw you walk in,
and I've been meaning to call
since the service, but work's

422
00:24:47,863 --> 00:24:49,448
How are you doing?

423
00:24:49,448 --> 00:24:53,452
Uhm, I'm all right.

424
00:24:56,038 --> 00:25:00,042
Well, you look amazing.
- Do I?

425
00:25:00,042 --> 00:25:04,046
Absolutely.

426
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:09,343
Well, I can't imagine what
you're going through.

427
00:25:12,846 --> 00:25:15,557
Phyllis?

428
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:17,434
You're going to have to stop that.

429
00:25:17,434 --> 00:25:19,728
I can't help it.

430
00:25:19,728 --> 00:25:23,732
When people talk about Rex,
I-I just get emotional.

431
00:25:26,068 --> 00:25:28,737
Well, I'm very sorry for your loss too,
Phyllis.

432
00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:31,448
He was my firstborn.

433
00:25:31,448 --> 00:25:35,452
I don't know what I will do without him.

434
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:39,456
Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Oh! Oh!

435
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:44,545
Is she gonna be OK?

436
00:25:44,545 --> 00:25:47,130
Um - yeah! Sure!

437
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:51,134
Hold on a second.

438
00:25:58,642 --> 00:26:02,646
Here we go. Feel better?

439
00:26:02,938 --> 00:26:05,357
Lynette, you were saying?

440
00:26:05,357 --> 00:26:06,358
I forgot.

441
00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:10,362
That's all right. It was really
sweet of you to stop by.

442
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:14,741
OK.

443
00:26:17,035 --> 00:26:21,039
So, are we ready to order or do
you need a little more time?

444
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:28,463
I've been in the insurance industry for
15 years. I've never recieved a phone
call like this.

445
00:26:29,548 --> 00:26:33,135
I'm having second thoughts about Rex's death.

446
00:26:33,135 --> 00:26:37,139
I've known Rex and Bree for nearly 20 years,

447
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:41,435
and I've never had any reason to suspect
they were anything but a happy, loving couple.

448
00:26:43,437 --> 00:26:47,441
But just why this seems so strange?

449
00:26:49,568 --> 00:26:53,155
I found it in Rex's room after he called in.

450
00:26:53,155 --> 00:26:57,159
"I forgive you".

451
00:27:28,982 --> 00:27:31,485
George! What are you doing here?

452
00:27:31,485 --> 00:27:34,279
I'm here to kidnap you.

453
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:35,155
What?

454
00:27:35,155 --> 00:27:37,074
Get your purse.

455
00:27:37,074 --> 00:27:39,868
I'm gonna take you balling.

456
00:27:39,868 --> 00:27:42,871
I-I don't know how to ball.

457
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:46,875
Or to the movies, or for a frozen yoghurt.
Whatever you want.

458
00:27:48,252 --> 00:27:50,671
Thank you, but I just couldn't.

459
00:27:50,671 --> 00:27:52,756
Bree. I'm sure you haven't
gone anywhere in weeks.

460
00:27:52,756 --> 00:27:55,467
You gotta get out, do things.
It'll help, trust me.

461
00:27:55,467 --> 00:27:59,471
I do. I'm just not ready yet.

462
00:28:00,055 --> 00:28:02,558
But it was very sweet of you to think of me.

463
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:05,686
Uh, you know. I tried.

464
00:28:05,686 --> 00:28:09,690
And I appreciate that.

465
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:16,154
It's all right. Let it out.

466
00:28:31,587 --> 00:28:33,672
You want me to die in here, don't you?

467
00:28:33,672 --> 00:28:35,382
Carlos, what happened?

468
00:28:35,382 --> 00:28:36,466
What do you mean, what happened?

469
00:28:36,466 --> 00:28:38,886
You talked Rita out of taking the money.

470
00:28:38,886 --> 00:28:40,470
Is that what Ritchie said?

471
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:43,348
Yeah, the subject came up in between
kidney punches.

472
00:28:43,348 --> 00:28:45,350
Well, it's not my fault.
She didn't want the money.

473
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:47,269
Why wouldn't she want $7,000?

474
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:49,688
Because it's for a boob job.

475
00:28:49,688 --> 00:28:52,858
So?
- So, her boobs are fine.

476
00:28:52,858 --> 00:28:55,861
And honestly, what he's
doing to her self-esteem is just cruel.

477
00:28:55,861 --> 00:28:57,154
I feel sorry for her.

478
00:28:57,154 --> 00:29:00,949
Please. You don't care about her
self-esteem any more than I do!

479
00:29:00,949 --> 00:29:02,868
You just didn't want to give up all that money!

480
00:29:02,868 --> 00:29:06,580
Well, I do think it's silly to give
someone $7,000 if they don't want it.

481
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,373
Listen to me.

482
00:29:08,373 --> 00:29:10,375
You're gonna go back there.

483
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:13,962
You're gonna put that money in Rita's hands,
and you're gonna convince her

484
00:29:13,962 --> 00:29:17,758
that life is not worth living
unless she has jugs the size of Texas,

485
00:29:17,758 --> 00:29:21,762
do I make myself clear?

486
00:29:21,887 --> 00:29:25,849
I just realized Rita and I
have a lot in common.

487
00:29:26,183 --> 00:29:28,769
Please don't tell me you have low self-esteem.

488
00:29:28,769 --> 00:29:32,773
Cause if I laugh now,
I'm gonna
crack the one good rib that I have left.

489
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:34,566
We're both controlled by our husbands,

490
00:29:34,566 --> 00:29:37,069
which is idiotic because they're
both behind bars.

491
00:29:37,069 --> 00:29:38,278
We should have all he power.

492
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:41,573
I'm not trying to control you!
I just don't want to end up in the morgue.

493
00:29:41,573 --> 00:29:42,866
This isn't about that.

494
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:46,870
Gabrielle, the morphine's wearing off.
I really don't have time for this.

495
00:29:47,371 --> 00:29:48,455
Me either, Carlos.

496
00:29:48,455 --> 00:29:52,459
And if you expect me to go
back and sweet-talk her into
getting the operation -

497
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:54,586
I can't show up empty-handed.

498
00:29:54,586 --> 00:29:58,549
Fine. Bring me the checkbook,
I'll make out a check for some cash.

499
00:29:59,758 --> 00:30:03,762
See, I was thinking I'd be writing the checks.

500
00:30:07,349 --> 00:30:07,683
Gabrielle -

501
00:30:07,683 --> 00:30:11,687
Careful, Carlos.
You're not in a position to argue.

502
00:30:18,277 --> 00:30:20,863
Yoohoo! Susan!

503
00:30:20,863 --> 00:30:23,073
Hey, Edie.

504
00:30:23,073 --> 00:30:26,869
So, whee! How much do you hate me?

505
00:30:26,869 --> 00:30:27,661
What?

506
00:30:27,661 --> 00:30:30,789
Oh, Karl said that you know all about
our dirty little secret.

507
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:32,249
Yess. Yes I do.

508
00:30:32,249 --> 00:30:33,667
Well, I feel awful.

509
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:37,087
I should've told you that I was doing your ex.

510
00:30:37,087 --> 00:30:39,173
It would've been the classy thing to do.

511
00:30:39,173 --> 00:30:41,675
Well, etiquette is a lost art for
a lot of people.

512
00:30:41,675 --> 00:30:45,679
You've got to believe me,
I never ever thought anything
would happen with us.

513
00:30:46,388 --> 00:30:50,350
But on our first date,
Karl took me to a Mexican restaurant.

514
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,352
You know what I get like when I drink tequila.

515
00:30:52,352 --> 00:30:55,189
Couple of shooters, and my bra unhooks itself.

516
00:30:55,189 --> 00:30:57,482
Circumstances beyond your control, I get it.

517
00:30:57,482 --> 00:31:00,068
So, if you'll excuse me.

518
00:31:00,068 --> 00:31:02,779
Hey!

519
00:31:02,779 --> 00:31:05,157
I am offering you an opportunity here!

520
00:31:05,157 --> 00:31:08,577
Go ahead. Vent. Let me have it.

521
00:31:08,577 --> 00:31:10,078
Come on, tell me what a bitch I am.

522
00:31:10,078 --> 00:31:13,373
Yeah, for snacking on your leftovers,
I deserve a... Come on, bring it on!

523
00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:15,959
Honestly, Edie, I don't mind.

524
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:19,963
You can skate off into the sunset
with Karl. Be my guest.

525
00:31:20,964 --> 00:31:23,175
That's good to know.

526
00:31:23,175 --> 00:31:26,970
I probably shouldn't tell you this, but -

527
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:30,182
we were in my jacuzzi last night -

528
00:31:30,182 --> 00:31:34,186
uhhhh! Karl
said it was the best sex he's ever had.

529
00:31:34,853 --> 00:31:38,857
Bar none.

530
00:31:39,358 --> 00:31:42,069
Actually, I'm glad that you shared that,
because

531
00:31:42,069 --> 00:31:43,779
here's a tidbit for you:

532
00:31:43,779 --> 00:31:47,783
Karl said he's still in love with me.

533
00:32:19,356 --> 00:32:20,649
Edie, what are you doing?

534
00:32:20,649 --> 00:32:22,359
You are a lying liar.

535
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:24,361
We're in the middle of the street.
Would you get out of here?

536
00:32:24,361 --> 00:32:25,863
Karl never said that!

537
00:32:25,863 --> 00:32:29,366
Karl asked me to get back
together the day after Julie's birthday.

538
00:32:29,366 --> 00:32:31,785
I said no, which I'm guessing is the reason for

539
00:32:31,785 --> 00:32:34,580
the now legendary tequila bra-popping incident.

540
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,081
Please let go.
- Oh no.

541
00:32:36,081 --> 00:32:37,374
We're not finished here.

542
00:32:37,374 --> 00:32:39,168
Yes we are. I'm gonna go.

543
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:40,586
You don't have the guts!

544
00:32:40,586 --> 00:32:44,590
In 5 seconds, I'm gonna punch it!
- Yeah? I'll kill your car!

545
00:32:44,756 --> 00:32:46,967
Not if you're sucking my exhaust, you won't!

546
00:32:46,967 --> 00:32:48,677
Take back what you said!
- No I won't!

547
00:32:48,677 --> 00:32:51,054
Admit it you'd do anything to
destroy my happiness!

548
00:32:51,054 --> 00:32:52,556
Edie, for God's sake.

549
00:32:52,556 --> 00:32:55,475
Why would I care if you went out with
a man I despise?

550
00:32:55,475 --> 00:32:57,269
Cause you and Mike are finished.

551
00:32:57,269 --> 00:32:59,479
Yup. Word's out.

552
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:03,483
And now that you can't be happy,
you don't want anyone else to be. Period.

553
00:33:08,071 --> 00:33:12,075
Edie, come back here! We're not finished yet!

554
00:33:22,961 --> 00:33:26,465
It was an accident, Karl.
Edie knows it was an accident, right?

555
00:33:26,465 --> 00:33:28,467
She knows you could have killed her.

556
00:33:28,467 --> 00:33:30,761
As it is, she's got a shattered tibia.

557
00:33:30,761 --> 00:33:34,097
Oh my God. I'm so sorry.

558
00:33:34,097 --> 00:33:35,974
I sent roses. Did she get the roses?

559
00:33:35,974 --> 00:33:38,769
Yep. She cut herself on the thorns.

560
00:33:38,769 --> 00:33:42,689
Oh my God.

561
00:33:42,689 --> 00:33:45,859
Why did you tell Edie
about our little conversation?

562
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:49,863
She was gloating about sleeping with you,
and I just wanted to shut her up.

563
00:33:50,989 --> 00:33:54,660
Oh. So you were jealous?

564
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:58,288
No! No.

565
00:33:58,288 --> 00:33:59,665
We were married.

566
00:33:59,665 --> 00:34:03,669
And she's trying to make that tawdry
little affair you guys have
going on par with that.

567
00:34:03,877 --> 00:34:07,798
I got mad.

568
00:34:07,798 --> 00:34:11,760
Susan, you remember the morning you saw
me with Edie's paper?

569
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:17,683
Well, the night before I had asked her
if she'd like to live together.

570
00:34:17,975 --> 00:34:21,979
And she said yes.

571
00:34:24,189 --> 00:34:26,483
Susan?

572
00:34:26,483 --> 00:34:30,487
Just give me a moment.
I'm asking God to kill me.

573
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:36,994
Look. She's fun, she goes with the flow.

574
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:41,373
At this time in my life, I need that.

575
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:45,586
Are you in love with her?

576
00:34:45,586 --> 00:34:49,590
Would you care if I were?

577
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:55,262
I want you to be happy.
I even sort of want Edie to be happy, but -

578
00:34:56,597 --> 00:34:57,389
But what?

579
00:34:57,389 --> 00:35:00,559
I want to be happy first.

580
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:03,979
Mike and I were supposed to move in together.

581
00:35:03,979 --> 00:35:07,983
This was supposed to be my time.

582
00:35:07,983 --> 00:35:11,278
I heard you and the plumber
were having problems.

583
00:35:11,278 --> 00:35:14,865
Is it over?

584
00:35:14,865 --> 00:35:18,869
I don't know.

585
00:35:20,871 --> 00:35:24,583
It's really complicated.

586
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:28,587
You never answered my question: Are you
in love with her?

587
00:35:30,797 --> 00:35:34,760
I don't know.

588
00:35:34,968 --> 00:35:37,387
But I can promise you this much:

589
00:35:37,387 --> 00:35:41,391
I've never loved another
woman the way I loved you.

590
00:35:41,391 --> 00:35:43,560
You walked out on me.

591
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,772
Yeah. But look how far I got.

592
00:35:46,772 --> 00:35:50,776
I'm just up the street.

593
00:36:05,791 --> 00:36:07,876
Mommy, Mommy, thank God you're home!

594
00:36:07,876 --> 00:36:09,586
Hey sweetie!

595
00:36:09,586 --> 00:36:11,964
Why? What's wrong?

596
00:36:11,964 --> 00:36:14,466
Daddy caught a rat.

597
00:36:14,466 --> 00:36:18,470
Wow. Did he, now?

598
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,684
Honey?

599
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:29,064
I'm home!

600
00:36:29,064 --> 00:36:30,774
Hey, babe.
- Hey!

601
00:36:30,774 --> 00:36:32,484
Hi. How was your day?

602
00:36:32,484 --> 00:36:33,861
It was good.

603
00:36:33,861 --> 00:36:37,865
But more importantly, how was yours?

604
00:36:38,198 --> 00:36:39,992
Parker told you about the rat, huh?

605
00:36:39,992 --> 00:36:41,076
Yyyup.

606
00:36:41,076 --> 00:36:44,371
My God, it was so disgusting.

607
00:36:44,371 --> 00:36:45,664
I can't understand.

608
00:36:45,664 --> 00:36:49,668
There it was sitting on the counter,
eating a leftover grilled cheese sandwich.

609
00:36:51,295 --> 00:36:53,463
The sandwiches from yesterday?

610
00:36:53,463 --> 00:36:55,090
OK, yes, the house has been too messy.

611
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:57,676
Obviously, my system has some kinks in it.

612
00:36:57,676 --> 00:37:01,096
But check it out, I got my act together.
- Wow!

613
00:37:01,096 --> 00:37:04,099
So I take it you took the rat outside?

614
00:37:04,099 --> 00:37:04,766
Oh no.

615
00:37:04,766 --> 00:37:07,895
I smashed it with the shovel.

616
00:37:07,895 --> 00:37:09,688
You killed it?

617
00:37:09,688 --> 00:37:13,692
Not at the first blow.

618
00:37:14,276 --> 00:37:18,280
Disgusting.

619
00:37:35,464 --> 00:37:39,468
Hey, little guy.

620
00:37:39,885 --> 00:37:43,889
I just wanted to say I'm really
sorry about what happened.

621
00:37:45,182 --> 00:37:47,267
With the shovel.

622
00:37:47,267 --> 00:37:50,395
Neither one of us saw that coming.

623
00:37:50,395 --> 00:37:54,399
I know it's not much consolation,
but you really helped my marriage.

624
00:37:55,984 --> 00:37:59,988
That's a lot for a little rat to
accomplish in one lifetime.

625
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:04,284
Well, it's getting late, so -

626
00:38:04,576 --> 00:38:08,580
Hats off to you.

627
00:38:13,961 --> 00:38:17,965
So you'd say the abuse started a
few years into your marriage?

628
00:38:19,174 --> 00:38:23,178
It started so slowly I didn't
realize what was happening.

629
00:38:24,763 --> 00:38:28,058
When he slapped me, that was a little problem.

630
00:38:28,058 --> 00:38:30,352
But he'd always apologize.

631
00:38:30,352 --> 00:38:34,356
Then it got worse, and one day, 8 years ago,

632
00:38:34,857 --> 00:38:38,861
my son spilt soda on our new carpet.

633
00:38:39,278 --> 00:38:41,446
Before I could move to protect him,

634
00:38:41,446 --> 00:38:43,949
Virgil had knocked him on the ground

635
00:38:43,949 --> 00:38:46,785
and began kicking him.

636
00:38:46,785 --> 00:38:50,747
I went to protect my baby,
but I didn't get there in time.

637
00:38:51,373 --> 00:38:55,169
What happened to your son?

638
00:38:55,169 --> 00:38:57,671
He died.

639
00:38:57,671 --> 00:39:00,674
I came across Monty's baby
pictures last weekend,

640
00:39:00,674 --> 00:39:03,969
and that's when the nightmare started again.

641
00:39:03,969 --> 00:39:10,058
The last doctor I saw said that I needed
to let go of my guilt and start living again.

642
00:39:11,351 --> 00:39:14,146
Of course, that's easier said than done.

643
00:39:14,146 --> 00:39:18,150
And I am getting so tired.

644
00:39:20,486 --> 00:39:24,198
I want you to start on Nitrozepam.

645
00:39:24,198 --> 00:39:28,202
That should do the trick.
- Thank you.

646
00:39:28,994 --> 00:39:31,872
I certainly hope your
husband was punished for what he did.

647
00:39:31,872 --> 00:39:35,876
Yeah. He got his retribution.
I made sure of that.

648
00:39:53,101 --> 00:39:54,394
Where are you off to?

649
00:39:54,394 --> 00:39:56,271
I'm - I'm going to see Rex's lawyer.

650
00:39:56,271 --> 00:40:00,275
We're going to go over some details
involving Rex's will.

651
00:40:03,278 --> 00:40:04,988
Phyllis -

652
00:40:04,988 --> 00:40:08,992
Obviously, I'm just mortified
over slapping you.

653
00:40:09,284 --> 00:40:16,291
I've just been in a weird place since
Rex's death, but that's no excuse.

654
00:40:18,502 --> 00:40:21,588
I'm very, very sorry.

655
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:23,465
No need to apologize.

656
00:40:23,465 --> 00:40:27,469
Your family - all's forgiven.

657
00:40:28,387 --> 00:40:29,888
Really?

658
00:40:29,888 --> 00:40:33,600
It's been a difficult time for all of us.

659
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,894
I totally understand.

660
00:40:35,894 --> 00:40:39,898
Now go. Don't want to be late for your
meeting about Rex's will.

661
00:41:04,673 --> 00:41:06,383
Claims, this is Joe Flannery.

662
00:41:06,383 --> 00:41:13,390
Hello. Could I speak to someone
about the death
benefits for Rex van de Kamp, please?

663
00:41:14,183 --> 00:41:16,185
This is his mother.

664
00:41:16,185 --> 00:41:22,191
Yes. We'd already spoken to his wife
several times.
We are moving as quickly as we can.

665
00:41:23,066 --> 00:41:27,070
Are you aware
that my daughter-in-law has a boyfriend?

666
00:41:30,073 --> 00:41:33,494
I'm listening.

667
00:41:33,494 --> 00:41:35,496
<i>Control.</i>

668
00:41:35,496 --> 00:41:39,500
<i>It's extraordinary the tactics
people employ to obtain it.</i>

669
00:41:42,377 --> 00:41:46,381
<i>Some rely on deception,</i>

670
00:41:47,299 --> 00:41:51,303
<i>while others engage in outright trickery.</i>

671
00:41:52,804 --> 00:41:56,767
<i>Then there are those who resort to extorsion.</i>

672
00:41:57,768 --> 00:42:01,772
<i>Why do we fight so hard for control?</i>

673
00:42:02,189 --> 00:42:05,400
<i>Because we know: To lose it</i>

674
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:09,404
<i>is to put our fate in the hands of others.</i>

675
00:42:12,074 --> 00:42:16,078
<i>And what could be more dangerous?</i>
