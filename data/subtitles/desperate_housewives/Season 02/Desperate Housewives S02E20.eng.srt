<i>karl mayer didn't pray often,</i>
<i>but when he did,</i></i>

14
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:34,284
<i>it was usually to ask</i>
<i>for god's help</i></i>

15
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:36,286
<i>in breaking up with a woman</i></i>

16

<i>that usually accompanied</i></i>

18
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:44,711
<i>such callous</i>
<i>and unexpected departures.</i></i>

94
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,770

12 months of hard work,

not giving in
to your urges.

96
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:16,275

good.

101
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:39,423
then tell
the pretty lady good-bye

102
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:42,885
and that you can't
socialize with her anymore.

103
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:45,637
and do it quick.

104
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:46,972

109
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,402
why don't we start
tomorrow?

110
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:03,155
but how would that help ed avoid
his marital problems?
what?

111
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:06,074
oh, he's right. i hear ed
fighting with fran on the phone

112
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:09,077

123
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:38,982
jerry, i didn't know
you had a kid.

124
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:42,110
y-yeah, um, out of wedlock.

125
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:43,987

i'm sorry i'm late.

128
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:57,543
what's going on?
karl broke up with edie.

129
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,795
oh, my god.

130
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:02,089
yeah, apparently,
he was seeing someone.

131
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,258
really?

132
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:05,592
did he say who it was?

133
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:08,011
i know who she is.

134
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:10,973
she's a man-eating,
scum-sucking ho-bag.

135
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:13,141
no, he did not say.

136
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:15,769
you know,
when karl dumped you,

137
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:18,272
i thought
that it was all your fault.

138
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:21,275
yeah, i figured that...
you were a nag or bad in bed.

139
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:25,195
but now i... now i see that
you were just a victim, too.

140
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:27,865
we have a bond, susan.

141
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:30,534
it's like we're sisters.

142
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:34,413
(chuckles) there's even
a pretty one and an ugly one.

143
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,706
edie!

144
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:38,125
no, i'm just saying
that karl screwed us both.

145
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:40,377
yes, like you
wouldn't believe.

146
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:42,421
guys, i'm all for bashing exes,
but let's save

147
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,882
a little of our hate
for his partner in crime--

148
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,717
the other woman.
mm-hmm.

149
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,385
yeah! you know, they're always
coming up with these excuses

150
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:50,721
to justify
being a home-wrecker.

151
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,556
exactly! like,
"he wouldn't have been with me

152
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:54,474
if he was gettin' it
at home."

153
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,435
yeah, "honey,
you're the love of my life.

154
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,103
she's just the runner-up."

155
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:00,439
oh, look, the baby's
doing something really cute.

156
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,527
she's sleeping.

157
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:07,112
like an angel.

158
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:10,282
look, i think we all know
that karl is a dog.
mm.

159
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:12,534
i mean, but let's face it--
if these tramps

160
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:14,745
weren't laying out the buffet,
he wouldn't be chowing down.

161
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,705
well, every situation
is different,

162
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:19,541
and it's hard to judge
until we know all the details.

163
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:20,918
which...

164
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,545
obviously i don't know,
because how would i know?

165
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:28,467
she's a slutty, slutty whore.
absolutely.

166
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:30,636
yeah.

167
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:37,142
are you sure she needs that?
i just put sunscreen on her.

168
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:39,811
yes, she needs the bonnet.
it completes the outfit.

169
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,730
oh, for god's sakes, gaby.

170
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:44,066
she's never too young
to start accessorizing.

171
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,318
besides, all the neighbors
are out today,

172
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,530
and i want them to see how happy
we are and wish they were us.

173
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:57,538
hey.

174
00:08:57,538 --> 00:08:59,414
uh, the baby's a beauty.

175
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:02,209
we think so,
but we're a little biased.

176
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:05,587
oh, wow,
she's got my eyes.

177
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:07,464
huh?

178
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:09,967
oh, i'm dale.

179
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:12,928
dale helm.
i'm the baby's birth father.

180
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:18,058
uh, well, hi, dale.

181
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,977
(chuckles)
nice to meet you.

182
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:21,979
a lot of people
have been looking for you.

183
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,606
yeah, i know,
lawyers and stuff.

184
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:27,276
i got kinda held up in florida
longer than i thought.

185
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,902
spring break, right?

186
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:32,239
yeah. oh, man,
we were wasted 24/7.

187
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:34,491
then i got the message
and just thought

188
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:37,911
my friends were messing with me.
those buttwads!

189
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:40,164
ahem.

190
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:42,291
well, it's a good thing
he's here.

191
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,418
we can take him
to the lawyer's office,

192
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,420
and you can sign over
full custody to us.

193
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,130
(chuckles) okay.

194
00:09:48,172 --> 00:09:51,466
yeah, uh,
the thing about that is,

195
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,844
i'm gonna want the baby.

196
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:05,439
come on, you guys.
we don't have to make this ugly.

197
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,442
you're trying to take our baby!
how is it not gonna be ugly?

198
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,235
just keep walking, gaby.
don't engage him.

199
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:11,570
listen, mr. solis...

200
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:14,448
no, you listen!
we were granted custody.

201
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:16,909
if you want her,
you talk to the judge.

202
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:21,079
hey, what is the holdup?
they told me
i gotta talk to a judge.

203
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:24,124
what the hell are you doing here, frank?
it's his baby.give it to him!

204
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,376
like hell!
(julie) hey, mrs. solis,can i see the baby?

205
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,962
(both) no!
dale, just do it already!

206
00:10:29,505 --> 00:10:31,840
i'm not just gonna kidnap it.
why not? they did!

207
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:35,385
it is your baby.
just take it!

208
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:37,971
try it.

209
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:39,556
frank?

210
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:44,353
(groans)
get in, you moron.

211
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:45,896
anyways, it looks like

212
00:10:45,938 --> 00:10:47,648
you're doing a good job with her.
dumb-ass!

213
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:49,441
she seems clean.

214
00:11:00,953 --> 00:11:03,956
(betty) and like i said,
we have been very happy here,

215
00:11:03,956 --> 00:11:05,624
and i'm sure you will be, too.

216
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:07,668
(man)
well, we just love it.
(woman) yeah.

217
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:11,547
once the stairs are repaired,
i'll show you the basement.

218
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:13,757
what's going on?

219
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:15,259
the house just sold.

220
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:17,845
start packing.

221
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:20,848
(danielle) why don't you just
put caleb in an institution?

222
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:24,726
it's where he belongs anyway.
my mom would never let strangers take care of him.

223
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,356
then it's not <i>up</i> to her.
if i call the police,</i>

224
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:31,567
my mom and i go to jail
<i>with</i> caleb.</i>

225
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,819
we've been hiding a murderer.
now, look, if we--

226
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:36,196
if we <i>do</i> move, i promise
i will call you every day.</i>

227
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,657
i don't need a phone buddy.
i need a boyfriend!

228
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:41,869
would you calm down,
please?
don't tell me what to do!

229
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,121
you know, i could
go to the police myself!
danielle...

230
00:11:44,163 --> 00:11:46,165
i just...
i love you so much.

231
00:11:46,165 --> 00:11:48,500
i would do anything
to keep you here.

232
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,795
yeah, i see that now.

233
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:55,674
you can't leave me alone here.
you have to think of something.

234
00:11:59,303 --> 00:12:01,972
don't worry.

235
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:03,515
i will.

236
00:12:58,237 --> 00:13:00,447
(gasps) oh, my god!

237
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,534
(i.m. chimes)

238
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,835
ed? hey, i'm so sorry,

239
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:16,588
but obviously that was just
meant for tom's eyes only.

240
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,674
honest mistake.
don't even worry about it.

241
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,509
okay.

242
00:13:20,551 --> 00:13:23,053
thanks. well, i'm gonna
go back in my office

243
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:26,306
and continue to feel like
a huge pervert.

244
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:29,142
at least you and tom
<i>have</i> a love life.</i>

245
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:32,646
well, we do the best we can
given the circumstances.

246
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:35,649
better than fran and i.
we're dead in that department.

247
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:38,569
i don't wanna
bore you with the details.

248
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,112
i appreciate that.

249
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:45,158
you know, ed...

250
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,703
i don't wanna pry
into your personal business,

251
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:50,914
but if you are having
problems in that area,

252
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:53,417
you don't have
to be resigned to it.

253
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,253
what are you suggesting,
hookers?

254
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:58,297
no, ed ferrara
doesn't pay for sex.

255
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:03,135
i mean, you and fran
could spice it up a bit.

256
00:14:03,135 --> 00:14:06,889
you know, get the old juices
flowing again.

257
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,390
oh, i see.

258
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:10,392
kinda like, uh...

259
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:12,936
"i'd like to lick you
from head to foot."

260
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:14,980
(chuckles) okay, well,
that wasn't my best work,

261
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:16,940
but you can't deny results.

262
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:20,194
i.m.ing works,
and when i go home tonight,

263
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:23,906
tom and i are going to...

264
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:25,908
okay, well,
i'm gonna be exhausted,

265
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:28,994
so i'll probably just lay there.
but trust ,

266
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:31,705
<i>tom</i> is gonna go to town.</i>

267
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:33,707
it's something to think about,
lord knows.

268
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:35,709
you know what
the sad truth is?

269
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:38,587
i <i>have</i> been thinking
about hookers.</i>

270
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:40,506
okay!

271
00:14:40,506 --> 00:14:42,633
uh, well,
i hope that helped.

272
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:45,385
and i'm just gonna
go back and finish

273
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:48,847
so we can all get
out of here. (chuckles)

274
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:57,356
let me guess.
you're not here for a bear claw.

275
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,441
(chuckles) no, i'm not.

276
00:14:59,483 --> 00:15:01,693
you're wasting your time.

277
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:03,779
look, you don't have
to worry about peter,

278
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,781
not while he's with me.

279
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,241
yeah? why is that?

280
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:09,701
because when it comes
to sex,

281
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:12,246
i have
an unwavering moral compass.

282
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:15,123
truly. a man could
beg and plead all day long,

283
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:18,085
and it wouldn't make
any difference.

284
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:20,212
so since i have
such strong self-control,

285
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:22,589
there's really no reason
for us to end our friendship.

286
00:15:22,631 --> 00:15:24,591
the guy's a ticking bomb.

287
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:26,093
you have no idea

288
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:28,804
the kind of depravity
that comes with this disease.

289
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:31,056
waking up in a stranger's bed
every morning...

290
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:32,558
cruising the park at night,

291
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,434
looking for somebody
to get off with,

292
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:37,271
compulsive masturbation
every chance you get!

293
00:15:42,526 --> 00:15:46,405
look, for guys like
peter and me,

294
00:15:46,405 --> 00:15:48,532
there's no beauty
in the sex.

295
00:15:48,574 --> 00:15:51,159
it's an empty and ugly
compulsion.

296
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:52,786
well, i am sorry,

297
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:55,372
but the peter i know
has a little more s--

298
00:15:55,414 --> 00:15:56,456
hold up.

299
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:03,505
claude, i need some--
i need some help.

300
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:06,258
what are you doing here?
are you using?

301
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,677
no, but i bought a bag.

302
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:11,471
you're an embarrassmento me.
give.

303
00:16:13,432 --> 00:16:17,311
there's a meeting over
on 10th street. you go there.

304
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:18,937
you call me after.

305
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:19,938
i'm sorry.

306
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,982
get the hell out of my shop.

307
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:28,071
i'm also a sponsor
at cocaine anonymous.

308
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:30,699
well, aren't you
the renaissance man.

309
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:32,534
are we done here,
princess?

310
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:34,786
not yet. you obviously have
an encyclopedic grasp

311
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:36,330
of everything deaved.

312
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:38,790
but clearly, you don't have
the slightest idea

313
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:40,918
about the power
of a loving relationship.

314
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:45,255
this is all you are
to peter--

315
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:47,382
something to satisfy
his addiction.

316
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:49,885
well, i think peter is
a better man than you do,

317
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:52,596
and i am not gonna
let you keep us apart.
try and stop me.

318
00:16:52,638 --> 00:16:55,098
peter does everything
i tell him to do.

319
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:59,603
that's the one thing
you can depend on with addicts--

320
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:02,064
they're weak. (laughs)

321
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:10,239
(sighs) excuse me.

322
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:14,660
excuse me.

323
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,286
may i ask you something?

324
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:18,705
yes, ma'am?

325
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:22,084
if a citizen,
an ordinary citizen like myself,

326
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:26,380
knew of someone holding
a significant amount of drugs,

327
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:28,382
what would
my responsibilities be,

328
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:30,384
you know, under the law?

329
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:45,566
what's all this?

330
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:47,568
and this one,
i ran out and got

331
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:49,778
the day i found out karl
was doing it with his secretary.

332
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,572
i think you'll find this
particularly helpful.

333
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:53,574
it's got a chapter called,

334
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:55,951
"revenge: you're only hurting
yourself."
yeah, you know,

335
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:58,620
i'm just really not
into the whole reading thing.

336
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,498
oh. well, um, why don't
we get you out of here?

337
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,500
let's go see
a feel-good movie.

338
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:06,253
why are you
being so nice to me?

339
00:18:06,295 --> 00:18:09,256
well, i just wanna help.
so how about that movie?

340
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:11,675
you know
how i like to heal?

341
00:18:11,717 --> 00:18:14,136
i get hammered.

342
00:18:14,178 --> 00:18:16,471
uh... well, um...

343
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:20,184
then i should just go and let
you get started with that.

344
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:22,519
do you really wanna
help me? good.

345
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:24,521
'cause i'm gonna need
a designated driver.

346
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:26,231
oh! uh...

347
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:28,233
okay.

348
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:32,946
how could he be arrested
for cocaine possession?

349
00:18:32,988 --> 00:18:34,239
claude swore he was clean.

350
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:36,200
it's just awful, isn't it?

351
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:38,243
i mean, you never know
what people are doing

352
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:39,953
behind your back.

353
00:18:39,995 --> 00:18:42,873
would you like some milk
with your cookies?

354
00:18:42,915 --> 00:18:44,249
thanks.

355
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,918
it's just, you know...

356
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:47,920
was he best sponsor
i've ever had,

357
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,255
and i don't know
what i'm gonna do now.

358
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:52,841
well, i have been doing
some thinking and...

359
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:56,261
here's a thought--
why don't i be your sponsor?

360
00:18:56,303 --> 00:18:58,889
(laughs)
you gotta be kidding.

361
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:00,891
you don't know squat
about sex addiction.

362
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:02,559
well, cravings are cravings,

363
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,895
and all you really need
is a friend to call

364
00:19:04,937 --> 00:19:07,189
when you start having
inappropriate thoughts,

365
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:09,191
and i can be that friend.

366
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:11,818
well, there's more
to it than that.

367
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,279
claude rescued me from
some pretty nasty sces

368
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:15,739
over the years.

369
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:18,534
well, if you were in trouble,
i could handle it.

370
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:21,495
how can you be so sure?

371
00:19:21,537 --> 00:19:23,789
because
i can be very strong

372
00:19:23,831 --> 00:19:26,667
for those people
that i really care about.

373
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:32,631
how can you have
any feelings for me at all?

374
00:19:32,673 --> 00:19:35,634
i mean, you've only known me
for a few weeks.

375
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:37,678
yes, and in that time,

376
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:41,849
i've come to learn that
you're good and kind and smart.

377
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,226
and, yes,
you have a little problem

378
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:46,395
that you need
some help with,

379
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:49,147
but i'm willing
to be there for you.

380
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:51,191
so what's the big deal?

381
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:55,153
if you saw me at my worst,

382
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:57,447
you might not like me
so much.

383
00:19:57,489 --> 00:20:00,909
peter,
let me be your rock.

384
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:04,830
taking care of people
is what i do best.

385
00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:08,625
drink your milk.

386
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:14,673
(indistinct conversations,
laughter)

387
00:20:20,012 --> 00:20:21,555
ah-ah-ah. mnh-mnh.

388
00:20:21,555 --> 00:20:23,557
i asked for <i>extra</i> spicy.</i>

389
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:25,767
i'm pretty sure
you said medium.

390
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:28,228
are you? well,
maybe if you'd written it down,

391
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,813
you would've spared yourself

392
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:32,065
the walk of shame
back to the kitchen.

393
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:36,820
edie, why are you
torturing that girl?

394
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:40,199
that is <i>her.</i> that is the one
that karl is in love with.</i>

395
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,075
we have been here
a million times,

396
00:20:42,117 --> 00:20:44,244
and you should see the way
that she flirts with him,

397
00:20:44,286 --> 00:20:47,581
and when she comes back here,
i am gonna shove this pitcher

398
00:20:47,623 --> 00:20:49,958
in her perky little mug,
and when she's--

399
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,252
okay, let's not make a scene.
it's not worth it.

400
00:20:52,294 --> 00:20:53,921
for the sake of argument,

401
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:56,006
let's--let's--let's say
that it's someone else.

402
00:20:56,048 --> 00:20:58,759
you know, probably it would be
a vulnerable, lonely woman

403
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:00,719
who karl
just took advantage of,

404
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:02,471
and what if...

405
00:21:02,513 --> 00:21:06,558
this poor, confused soul
begged your forgiveness?

406
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:08,227
what would you say?

407
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:13,148
i'd say...

408
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,609
"too little,
too late, bitch,"

409
00:21:15,651 --> 00:21:18,153
and then i'd kick her.

410
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:19,363
oh.

411
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:21,740
yeah, but you don't have
to worry about that,

412
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:24,618
because i'm positive it's her.
i mean, who else could it be?
yeah.

413
00:21:24,618 --> 00:21:27,621
karl's office is all guys,
and then the only women he sees

414
00:21:27,663 --> 00:21:29,414
are me, julie,

415
00:21:29,456 --> 00:21:32,334
that--that lesbian that does
his taxes and you.

416
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,338
you know what?

417
00:21:37,673 --> 00:21:38,924
it <i>is</i> her.</i>

418
00:21:38,966 --> 00:21:42,010
really? why?

419
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:44,263
she just...
spit in your wings.

420
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:47,641
you got my back?

421
00:21:47,683 --> 00:21:49,685
uh... sure?

422
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,063
here you go, extra spicy.

423
00:21:53,105 --> 00:21:54,439
aah!

424
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:01,697
you did that on purpose.
(grunts)

425
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:03,824
ugh!

426
00:22:06,952 --> 00:22:08,495
you are going to pay!
(whistle blows)

427
00:22:08,537 --> 00:22:10,122
(edie) oh!
(woman) whoa!

428
00:22:10,122 --> 00:22:11,623
fight, fight!

429
00:22:11,623 --> 00:22:13,542
(edie) get off me, you!
get off me!

430
00:22:13,584 --> 00:22:16,128
mayer! four on one!

431
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:19,423
a little help!

432
00:22:28,182 --> 00:22:30,726
so, uh, when we leave...

433
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:32,728
who you gonna miss
the most?

434
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:35,814
i don't know.

435
00:22:35,856 --> 00:22:37,482
yeah, you .

436
00:22:37,524 --> 00:22:39,484
you said good-bye
to her yet?

437
00:22:39,484 --> 00:22:41,653
no.

438
00:22:41,695 --> 00:22:44,656
look, man, it's...
it's okay if you like her.

439
00:22:44,656 --> 00:22:46,825
you know, i think danielle
really likes you, too.

440
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:48,869
really?

441
00:22:48,911 --> 00:22:50,871
yeah, she told me
she'd be really sad

442
00:22:50,913 --> 00:22:53,081
if you left
and didn't say good-bye.

443
00:22:53,123 --> 00:22:55,459
you know, i think that

444
00:22:55,501 --> 00:22:58,337
she might even want you
to give her a little kiss.

445
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:02,090
but danielle doesn't even
like me in her room.

446
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,759
she gets mad.

447
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:07,596
yeah.

448
00:23:07,638 --> 00:23:11,016
i talked to her about that.
she feels really bad.

449
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:16,647
if you come in her room again,
she won't get mad.

450
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:26,281
and, caleb,

451
00:23:26,323 --> 00:23:30,536
she's gonna act like she
doesn't want you to kiss her...

452
00:23:30,577 --> 00:23:32,162
but she does.

453
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:44,800
<i>dale helm,</i></i>

454
00:23:44,842 --> 00:23:47,469
<i>like all the students</i>
<i>at parsons christian academy,</i></i>

455
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:51,306
<i>was taught that his future</i>
<i>was safely in god's hands.</i></i>

456
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:55,018
<i>what he didn't know</i></i>

457
00:23:55,018 --> 00:24:01,316
<i>was that gabrielle solis</i>
<i>was about to force a fumble.</i></i>

458
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:04,945
(crowd cheering loudly)

459
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,414
(man) all right, guys,

460
00:24:15,414 --> 00:24:18,292
you all know next week
we're playing the falcons!

461
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:22,171
and we're gonna fry up
those birdies for dinner,

462
00:24:22,212 --> 00:24:25,090
'cause we're the huskies!
(mouths words)

463
00:24:25,132 --> 00:24:26,633
and who are the huskies?

464
00:24:26,675 --> 00:24:30,345
(all) god's team! god's team!
god's team!

465
00:24:30,345 --> 00:24:31,847
god's team! god's team!

466
00:24:31,889 --> 00:24:34,766
god's team! god's team!
god's team!

467
00:24:34,808 --> 00:24:37,352
god's team! god's team!

468
00:24:37,352 --> 00:24:39,646
what are you doing?
you can't be here.

469
00:24:39,646 --> 00:24:41,190
let's talk turkey.

470
00:24:41,231 --> 00:24:43,984
what is it gonna take
for you to give up the baby?

471
00:24:44,026 --> 00:24:46,195
it's not gonna happen, okay?
i gotta get back.

472
00:24:46,236 --> 00:24:48,197
i'm the quarterback.
it doesn't look right.

473
00:24:48,238 --> 00:24:50,240
okay, no, no!
wait, what about a car?

474
00:24:50,282 --> 00:24:52,284
or college?
tuition's a killer these days.

475
00:24:52,326 --> 00:24:53,785
i could help you out.

476
00:24:53,827 --> 00:24:55,287
i don't need help.

477
00:24:55,329 --> 00:24:57,414
you hear those cheers?
those are for me.

478
00:24:57,414 --> 00:24:59,458
last game,
i threw 246 yards.

479
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:03,128
with stats like that, i can get
into the college of my choice.

480
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:05,589
so why do you
want to be a dad?

481
00:25:05,631 --> 00:25:08,550
these are your glory days.
a baby would ruin your life.
oh, i know. but frank said

482
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:11,720
once i get the baby,
he's gonna take it off my hands.

483
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,555
but it's not even his.
libby dumped him.

484
00:25:13,597 --> 00:25:15,557
he thinks that
if he has the baby

485
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:18,018
and she sees him
acting all mature,

486
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:20,145
she'll take him back.
no, no, no.

487
00:25:20,187 --> 00:25:22,814
i am not letting that idiot use
my baby as a bargaining chip.

488
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:25,359
hey, it's out of my hands!

489
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,904
no, it doesn't have to be, okay?
just do the right thing

490
00:25:28,946 --> 00:25:31,949
and sign the release form.
look, i'm really sorry.

491
00:25:43,877 --> 00:25:45,420
before we adjourn today,

492
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:48,715
let's take a moment
to bow our heads.

493
00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:10,696
(microphone feedback whines)
hello, everyone.

494
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:15,200
i'm gaby solis,
class of '94. whoo-hoo!

495
00:26:18,996 --> 00:26:22,082
i just wanted to give god
a big shout out

496
00:26:22,082 --> 00:26:23,959
for this amazing season.

497
00:26:25,586 --> 00:26:28,046
the man upstairs has definitely
been on your side.

498
00:26:28,088 --> 00:26:31,717
and you wanna know why?
because you boys live clean.

499
00:26:31,758 --> 00:26:34,469
you keep your noses up,
you stay out of trouble,

500
00:26:34,511 --> 00:26:37,639
and you don't go around
getting strippers pregnant.

501
00:26:37,681 --> 00:26:39,975
and that's a good thing,

502
00:26:40,017 --> 00:26:42,060
'cause if one of you
caused a scandal like that,

503
00:26:42,102 --> 00:26:44,479
not only would that guy
get kicked off the team

504
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:46,440
<i>and</i> lose
all of his scholarships,</i>

505
00:26:46,481 --> 00:26:49,484
but god would drop
your school colors so fast,

506
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:51,486
it'd make your head spin!

507
00:26:51,528 --> 00:26:54,531
and then the football season
would go to hell.

508
00:26:54,573 --> 00:26:56,867
no pun intended. (chuckles)

509
00:26:56,909 --> 00:26:58,368
so my point is,

510
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:01,455
do the right thing,
and no one gets hurt.

511
00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:09,171
signed, sealed, delivered.

512
00:27:09,213 --> 00:27:12,549
lily's ours.

513
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:15,177
so what do you think?
are you staying late again,

514
00:27:15,219 --> 00:27:18,180
or can i finally have dinner
at home with my wife?

515
00:27:18,222 --> 00:27:20,933
god, i don't know.
i'm gonna go check with ed.

516
00:27:20,974 --> 00:27:22,476
okay.

517
00:27:22,518 --> 00:27:25,771
hey, any luck
with that i.m.ing thing?

518
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:27,314
no, not really.

519
00:27:27,314 --> 00:27:29,483
i was online chatting
with fran a while ago,

520
00:27:29,483 --> 00:27:31,485
and i asked her
what she was wearing,

521
00:27:31,485 --> 00:27:33,487
and she said,
"a yellow blouse."

522
00:27:33,487 --> 00:27:35,447
okay, that's good.
then what?

523
00:27:35,489 --> 00:27:38,867
then... yeah, that's it.
i just kinda blocked.

524
00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:41,161
you blocked?
yeah, i didn't know
what else to say.

525
00:27:41,203 --> 00:27:43,330
you're an award-winning
copywriter, ed.

526
00:27:43,372 --> 00:27:44,915
you get paid to write.

527
00:27:44,915 --> 00:27:46,792
yeah, jingles for oatmeal,
not soft-core porn.

528
00:27:46,834 --> 00:27:48,794
for god's sakes,
it's not brain surgery.

529
00:27:48,836 --> 00:27:51,046
is she still online?
yeah, i think so.

530
00:27:51,088 --> 00:27:52,381
ugh.

531
00:27:54,675 --> 00:28:00,848
"i love the way that blouse
clings to your body."

532
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:05,018
"are you joking?"

533
00:28:05,018 --> 00:28:06,520
mnh-mnh-mnh.

534
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:11,191
"nothing funny about
those beautiful breasts."

535
00:28:11,233 --> 00:28:12,526
(i.m. chimes)

536
00:28:12,568 --> 00:28:16,572
"yeah? what did you want
to do to me?"

537
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:18,115
uh...

538
00:28:22,786 --> 00:28:25,247
ed, your conference call's
ready.

539
00:28:25,289 --> 00:28:27,249
oh, god, i almt forgot
about that.

540
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:29,251
okay,
i gotta go take this,

541
00:28:29,293 --> 00:28:31,545
but you keep going,
'cause you're doing great.

542
00:28:31,587 --> 00:28:33,463
no, ed, i'm not
doing this for you!

543
00:28:33,505 --> 00:28:34,548
just...
what?

544
00:28:47,227 --> 00:28:48,604
ahem.

545
00:28:48,645 --> 00:28:52,733
"touch every inch of your body

546
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:56,403
until you're trembling."

547
00:29:00,115 --> 00:29:04,786
"oh, yeah.
i'll bite you good."

548
00:29:08,957 --> 00:29:10,250
"hell, yeah.

549
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:16,465
first, i want you
to touch yourself."

550
00:29:19,092 --> 00:29:21,553
"oh, yeah!"

551
00:29:27,851 --> 00:29:30,395
"i'm on my way."

552
00:29:38,195 --> 00:29:39,655
<i>(dance music playing</i>
<i>over telephone)</i></i>

553
00:29:39,696 --> 00:29:41,323
hello?

554
00:29:41,365 --> 00:29:43,784
bree, it's peter...

555
00:29:43,784 --> 00:29:45,786
and i'm in trouble.

556
00:29:47,579 --> 00:29:50,582
(indistinct conversations
in distance)

557
00:29:52,918 --> 00:29:55,003
<i>(dance music playing)</i></i>

558
00:29:55,045 --> 00:29:59,758
hi, i'm--i'm looking for,
um, peter mcmillan.

559
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,760
i'm not sure i know him.

560
00:30:01,802 --> 00:30:04,137
you should ask my wife.
she organized the party.

561
00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:06,306
hey, judy, get over here
and act like a hostess!

562
00:30:06,348 --> 00:30:08,851
come on in!
come on, come on, come on.

563
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:19,361
(singsong voice)
hey there.

564
00:30:19,403 --> 00:30:21,405
things areust
getting started.

565
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:24,616
after you take off your clothes,
feel free to jump right in.

566
00:30:24,658 --> 00:30:26,118
no, no, i'm--i'm good.

567
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,620
i'm just, um, here
to pick up my friend peter.

568
00:30:28,662 --> 00:30:31,290
he's locked himself
in your bathroom,

569
00:30:31,331 --> 00:30:33,292
and i'm here
to take him home.

570
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:34,459
oh, yeah, that guy.
we were wondering about him.

571
00:30:34,459 --> 00:30:36,128
the bathroom's over there.

572
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:38,714
hey, is that
your natural color?

573
00:30:38,964 --> 00:30:41,300
yes, it is.

574
00:30:41,341 --> 00:30:43,177
beautiful.
i wish mine would do that.

575
00:30:43,218 --> 00:30:45,179
this is out of a bottle.

576
00:30:46,263 --> 00:30:49,725
yes, i'm aware of that.

577
00:30:53,979 --> 00:30:55,564
peter?

578
00:30:55,564 --> 00:30:58,358
peter, it's bree.
are you in there?

579
00:31:00,861 --> 00:31:02,446
what are you doing here?

580
00:31:02,446 --> 00:31:03,947
i'm a sex addict.
what do you think?

581
00:31:03,947 --> 00:31:06,783
you can't possibly be turned on
by what's going on out there.

582
00:31:06,825 --> 00:31:11,121
disgusting, isn't it?
yes. why would you wanna
come to a place like this?

583
00:31:11,163 --> 00:31:13,999
i didn't.
i wanted <i>you</i> to come.</i>

584
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:17,002
i can't make you
not have feelings for me,

585
00:31:17,044 --> 00:31:20,839
but i can show you who i was,
what my life was like.

586
00:31:20,881 --> 00:31:22,299
well, that's not
your life anymore.

587
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:22,716
but it could be.

588
00:31:22,883 --> 00:31:24,968
if i slip again, this is exactly
where you could find me,

589
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:26,303
or someplace worse.

590
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:29,264
then what would you
think of me?

591
00:31:29,306 --> 00:31:30,766
peter--
bree...

592
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:32,768
it's dangerousto care

593
00:31:32,768 --> 00:31:34,770
a lot of people have
over the years,

594
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:36,772
and they all end up
getting hurt.

595
00:31:39,024 --> 00:31:40,984
rex said
he'd always be faithful.

596
00:31:41,026 --> 00:31:42,986
george said
he'd never hurt me.

597
00:31:43,028 --> 00:31:45,864
and as it turned out,
they were both liars.

598
00:31:46,031 --> 00:31:48,534
so as long
as you're honest with me,

599
00:31:48,534 --> 00:31:51,995
you'd be amazed
at what i can put up with.

600
00:31:53,664 --> 00:31:55,249
now let's go home.

601
00:32:09,096 --> 00:32:11,265
hey there.
did you have a late night?

602
00:32:11,265 --> 00:32:12,766
i hope.

603
00:32:12,766 --> 00:32:14,434
it was horrible.

604
00:32:14,476 --> 00:32:17,729
the whole thing
blew up in my face.

605
00:32:17,771 --> 00:32:21,608
why would you tell my wife
to bite my nipple off?

606
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:23,652
i didn't!

607
00:32:23,694 --> 00:32:26,155
i didn't.
why would she--oh!

608
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:28,073
the honeymoon thing.

609
00:32:28,115 --> 00:32:30,534
yeah, and it hurt
like hell then, too.

610
00:32:30,534 --> 00:32:33,036
and it didn't take her long
to figure out

611
00:32:33,036 --> 00:32:35,038
that i let a stranger
seduce her online.

612
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,415
oh, god!

613
00:32:36,456 --> 00:32:38,917
she was so mad, she locked
herself in the bathroom

614
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:40,419
and called
a divorce lawyer.

615
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,504
you're getting divorced?

616
00:32:42,546 --> 00:32:45,507
i spent two hours pleading with
her through the bathroom door,

617
00:32:45,549 --> 00:32:47,968
begging her
not to leave me, and...

618
00:32:47,968 --> 00:32:50,554
we finally managed
to come to terms.

619
00:32:50,596 --> 00:32:54,308
what kind of terms?
i promised her i would
fire the person who did it.

620
00:32:54,349 --> 00:32:56,476
you're gonna fire me?

621
00:32:56,518 --> 00:32:59,313
no, of course not.
you're too important here.

622
00:32:59,354 --> 00:33:01,773
i'm gonna fire tom.

623
00:33:01,815 --> 00:33:04,026
i told her it was him
that sent the i.m.s.

624
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:07,237
what?!
i told her that he had
a problem with boundarie

625
00:33:07,237 --> 00:33:09,948
i'm sorry.
i didn't wanna do this,

626
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,950
but my marriage
was on the line.

627
00:33:11,992 --> 00:33:15,454
you can't make my husband
your scapegoat.

628
00:33:15,496 --> 00:33:16,997
i won't let you.

629
00:33:16,997 --> 00:33:18,874
i don't have a damn choice.

630
00:33:18,916 --> 00:33:20,959
i can't be divorced,
lynette.

631
00:33:21,001 --> 00:33:22,336
i can't.

632
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:26,590
he's under contract.

633
00:33:26,632 --> 00:33:28,592
if you just fire him,

634
00:33:28,634 --> 00:33:31,261
he'll sue you, and i'll back
him up. you need cause.

635
00:33:31,303 --> 00:33:33,764
well...

636
00:33:33,805 --> 00:33:35,974
i guess
i'll have to find cause.

637
00:33:38,101 --> 00:33:41,313
it shouldn't be too difficult
if i look hard enough.

638
00:33:56,954 --> 00:33:58,956
hey, how's the eye?

639
00:33:58,997 --> 00:34:00,958
oh, it's still
a little red,

640
00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:03,126
bui think i got
all the hot sauce out.

641
00:34:03,168 --> 00:34:04,336
that's good.

642
00:34:04,378 --> 00:34:06,964
so, um...
you know the other day

643
00:34:06,964 --> 00:34:09,466
when i said that thing
about us being sisters?

644
00:34:09,466 --> 00:34:12,094
well, when i said it
i really didn't mean it.

645
00:34:12,135 --> 00:34:14,054
yeah,
i kind of figured that.

646
00:34:14,096 --> 00:34:17,766
no, i mean, i <i>really</i>
didn't mean it. but, um...</i>

647
00:34:17,766 --> 00:34:19,351
now i do.

648
00:34:19,393 --> 00:34:22,229

thank you for having my back.

649
00:34:27,985 --> 00:34:31,572

private detectives in town.

657
00:34:57,389 --> 00:34:58,849
i do what i can.

658
00:34:58,891 --> 00:35:00,893
well, come on in.
let's talk.

659
00:35:00,934 --> 00:35:04,646
um... basically, i just
want you to trail my ex.

660
00:35:04,688 --> 00:35:08,692
he, uh... left me
for another woman,

661
00:35:08,734 --> 00:35:11,236
and i wanna nail that ho
to the wall.

662
00:35:22,164 --> 00:35:23,165
caleb?

663
00:35:23,165 --> 00:35:25,667
hey, come on, buddy,
wake up.

664
00:35:25,667 --> 00:35:27,753
caleb?

665
00:35:27,794 --> 00:35:29,296
it's time.

666
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:55,197
(danielle screams, clatter)

667
00:35:55,197 --> 00:35:57,199
get away from me!

668
00:36:08,961 --> 00:36:10,838
get away from her!

669
00:36:10,879 --> 00:36:15,509
danielle, i want you to pick up
the phone and call the police.

670
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:20,848
no!
what?

671
00:36:20,848 --> 00:36:23,308
matthew and his mother
have been protecting caleb.

672
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:25,310
they're in as much trouble
as he is!

673
00:36:25,352 --> 00:36:26,937
i don't care.

674
00:36:26,979 --> 00:36:28,939
mom, please! i love him.

675
00:36:28,981 --> 00:36:31,191
(crying) please.

676
00:36:36,488 --> 00:36:38,448
if i hadn't been
in the house,

677
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:41,535
he could've raped her...
or worse.

678
00:36:41,577 --> 00:36:44,538
he's locked
in his room now, so...

679
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,999
needless to say,
the agreement between us is off.

680
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,376
caleb is dangerous,
and i want him put away.

681
00:36:49,418 --> 00:36:52,254
if he is not gone by tomorrow,
i am calling the police.

682
00:36:52,296 --> 00:36:54,256
(matthew)
he will be. i promise you.

683
00:36:54,298 --> 00:36:56,216
can i go check on danielle?

684
00:36:56,216 --> 00:36:57,926
yes.

685
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:05,851
betty, i am serious.

686
00:37:05,893 --> 00:37:08,478
either you do something,
or i will.

687
00:37:11,899 --> 00:37:14,735
bree, stop worrying.

688
00:37:14,776 --> 00:37:17,821
i understand
what needs to happen now.

689
00:37:23,368 --> 00:37:24,870
danielle?

690
00:37:33,629 --> 00:37:35,714
did it work?

691
00:37:35,756 --> 00:37:38,091
perfectly.

692
00:37:38,133 --> 00:37:39,718
you did great.

693
00:37:48,268 --> 00:37:49,603
um, so i got some rates

694
00:37:49,645 --> 00:37:51,313
on some mental hospitals
around here,

695
00:37:51,313 --> 00:37:52,606
and there's one called
silvercrest

696
00:37:52,648 --> 00:37:54,107
which actually seems okay.

697
00:37:54,149 --> 00:37:56,109
put this ham in the fridge,
will you?

698
00:37:56,151 --> 00:37:58,111
i think i'll make it
for dinner.

699
00:37:59,196 --> 00:38:01,949
uh, mom, i know you don't wanna
talk about this, but we have to.

700
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:04,409
mrs. van de kamp
is gonna call the police.

701
00:38:04,451 --> 00:38:07,454
i promised myself i would never
institutionalize your other.

702
00:38:07,496 --> 00:38:10,249
mom...
how long do you think
it'd be before he'd act out,

703
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:11,917
maybe even hurt somebody?

704
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:14,628
a couple of days? a week?

705
00:38:14,628 --> 00:38:16,588
then they'd throw him
in a straitjacket

706
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,882
and drug away
what's left of his mind.

707
00:38:18,924 --> 00:38:21,927
he'd spend the rest of his life
at the mercy of strangers.

708
00:38:21,927 --> 00:38:23,428
but if we don't send him
to a hospital,

709
00:38:23,428 --> 00:38:25,013
he's gonna end up in prison,

710
00:38:25,013 --> 00:38:27,850
and don't you think
that's worse?
yes, of course i do.

711
00:38:28,267 --> 00:38:30,811
so what the hell
are we gonna do?

712
00:38:35,941 --> 00:38:38,610
phenobarbital?

713
00:38:38,652 --> 00:38:40,445
it's easy.

714
00:38:40,487 --> 00:38:41,989
it's painless.

715
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:46,618
it's just a few extra drops.
he simply falls asleep.

716
00:38:50,289 --> 00:38:53,208
caleb was meant for a better
world than this, matthew.

717
00:38:55,544 --> 00:38:59,798
it's time to give your brother
the peace he deserves.

718
00:39:13,353 --> 00:39:14,813
who's the pretty girl?

719
00:39:14,813 --> 00:39:16,315
(doorbell rings)

720
00:39:16,356 --> 00:39:18,483
oh, looks like
it's daddy's turn.

721
00:39:18,525 --> 00:39:19,985
(whispering)
i got her.
yes.

722
00:39:20,027 --> 00:39:21,528
oh, yes.

723
00:39:23,822 --> 00:39:26,366
mrs. solis?
yes?

724
00:39:26,408 --> 00:39:29,203
we have a court order to take
the collins baby into custody.

725
00:39:29,244 --> 00:39:31,830
no, no, no,
that's a mistake.

726
00:39:31,872 --> 00:39:33,499
no, we--
we have the paperwork.

727
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,334
the birth father
signed away his rights.

728
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:37,419
it's the birth mother
who's protesting.

729
00:39:37,461 --> 00:39:38,629
what?

730
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:41,215
until the adoption
is legally finalized,

731
00:39:41,215 --> 00:39:43,884
the birth mother
can still change her mind,

732
00:39:43,884 --> 00:39:45,677
and... she has.

733
00:39:55,729 --> 00:39:58,815
no, no,
no, no, no, no!

734
00:39:58,815 --> 00:40:00,567
(clos) gaby, wait.

735
00:40:00,609 --> 00:40:03,070
<i>you?</i> you don't even
wanna be a mother!</i>

736
00:40:03,111 --> 00:40:06,615
(libby) well, look, frank quit
usin', anduh, he got

737
00:40:06,657 --> 00:40:09,827
a good job down at the plant.
he's really stepped up.

738
00:40:09,868 --> 00:40:11,620
so?!

739
00:40:11,662 --> 00:40:15,249
well, so we're gonna give
the whole family thing a shot.

740
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:18,252
well, i'll totally give you
all your money back.

741
00:40:18,252 --> 00:40:21,463
i don't <i>want</i> my money back.
i want my baby!</i>

742
00:40:24,716 --> 00:40:26,218
co on, let's go.

743
00:40:26,218 --> 00:40:27,553
carlos!

744
00:40:27,594 --> 00:40:30,055
no!
carlos, what's happening?

745
00:40:30,097 --> 00:40:32,224
no, no, no, ma'am,
you don't understand.

746
00:40:32,266 --> 00:40:34,351
you don't understand,
this is <i>our</i> baby!</i>

747
00:40:34,351 --> 00:40:37,271
no, we've been--we've been
feeding her, and we--

748
00:40:37,312 --> 00:40:39,064
we've been bathing her,

749
00:40:39,106 --> 00:40:41,692
and we wake up in the middle
of the night and we rock her,

750
00:40:41,733 --> 00:40:43,193
which is crazy,

751
00:40:43,235 --> 00:40:45,195
'cause if you knew me,
i don't do that.

752
00:40:45,237 --> 00:40:46,780
i don't do that.

753
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:49,366
and--and my husband--
my husband, he sings to her.

754
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:52,619
(crying) he sings,
so you can't take her away.

755
00:40:52,661 --> 00:40:55,998
it's too late. we've already
fallen in love with her!

756
00:41:00,752 --> 00:41:03,881
(sobbing)

757
00:41:03,922 --> 00:41:05,883
carlos, do something!

758
00:41:05,924 --> 00:41:10,804
no, you can't go!
you can't--you can't take her!

759
00:41:10,846 --> 00:41:12,556
you can't take her!

760
00:41:12,598 --> 00:41:14,558
(sobbing) no!

761
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,102
she's our baby!

762
00:41:17,144 --> 00:41:19,855
she's our...

763
00:41:19,897 --> 00:41:22,107
no!

764
00:41:22,149 --> 00:41:23,650
please!

765
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:27,112
<i>there is a prayer intended</i>
<i>to give strength to people</i></i>

766
00:41:27,154 --> 00:41:32,326
<i>faced with circumstances</i>
<i>they don't want to accept.</i></i>

767
00:41:32,367 --> 00:41:34,328
<i>the power of the prayer</i></i>

768
00:41:34,369 --> 00:41:36,788
<i>comes from its insight</i>
<i>into human nature...</i></i>

769
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:39,875
we ask god
to grant us the serenity

770
00:41:39,917 --> 00:41:42,085
to accept the things
we cannot change...

771
00:41:42,127 --> 00:41:44,087
<i>because so many of us</i></i>

772
00:41:44,129 --> 00:41:48,383
<i>rage against the hand</i>
<i>that life has dealt us...</i></i>

773

the courage
to change the things we can...

774
00:41:52,429 --> 00:41:55,474
<i>because so many of us</i>
<i>are cowardly</i></i>

775

<i>and afraid to stand up</i>
<i>for what is right...</i></i>

776
00:42:01,813 --> 00:42:04,858

to know the difference.

777

779

<i>the good news</i>

780
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:22,251
<i>is that god will hear you</i>

781
00:42:24,336 --> 00:42:28,715

<i>the answer is no.</i></i>
