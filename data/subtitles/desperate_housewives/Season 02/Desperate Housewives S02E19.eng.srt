Previously on... Desperate housewives

3
00:00:04,463 --> 00:00:07,132
sounds to me as if someone'slet go of his rage.

4
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:09,593
- Maybe I have.
- Well,i haven'T.

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,262
Felicia took matters into her own hands.

6
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:13,889
You want me to call offthe wedding,I'll do it.

7
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,015
I'll do whatever you want.

8
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:17,267
Karl put the ball in susan's court...

9
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:20,229
with your D.U.I. Charge,it could get ugly.

10
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:22,397
While andrew tried to take bree to court...

11
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:24,441
- there's a father.
- He's a kid!

12
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:26,443
Gabrielle and carlos took the baby...

13
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:27,778
the papers aren't valid anymore.

14
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:29,738
Do you really wanna leave this beautiful little girl

15
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,448
with that white trash freak show?

16
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,408
And ran with it.

17
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,790
louisa pate believed in the power of shame.

18
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:44,169
As a teacher,she had found that the best way to control unruly students

19
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:47,172
was to instill a strong sense of shame...

20
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:48,882
in their parents.

21
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:54,054
I left trisha alonewith the school hamster for only five minutes.

22
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:59,351
In this boxis all that's left of patches.

23
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:02,938
For show and tell,timmy decidedto bring in something

24
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:08,151
from your husband's collection of nazi memorabilia.

25
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:12,281
Billy's been threateningto beat up the other kids for their milk money.

26
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:16,535
We found the proceedsin his cubby.

27
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:21,331
Of course,mrs. Pate also knew when it came to unruly children,

28
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:24,877
some parents had more reason to be ashamed...

29
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,378
than others.

30
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:28,422
So,um...

31
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:33,010
your message saidthat parker had been involved in 
some sortof serious incident.

32
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:35,179
What--what kindof incident?

33
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:36,471
Yesterday afternoon,

34
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:41,560
parker offered a cookieto cindy lou peeples 
if she wouldshow him her vagina.

35
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:44,521
What kind of cookie?

36
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:45,856
What does that matter?

37
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,232
Oh,it doesn'T.

38
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:48,233
I'm just stalling

39
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,736
becauseI am completely mortified.

40
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,029
The kids were in a broom closet.

41
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:55,365
Our janitor walked in on them just as cindy was lifting up her pinafore.

42
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,075
Oh,my goodness.

43
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,703
I'm sure you've noticedhow obsessive parker can be.

44
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,496
A certain subjectwill catch his interest,

45
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,373
and that's all he'll talk aboutfor weeks and weeks.

46
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:04,917
Oh,right.That happened with dinosaurs.

47
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,920
Oh,yes,we all rememberhis dinosaur phase.

48
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:10,339
More fondly now than ever.

49
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,593
so you thinkthat now he's obsessed with...

50
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,137
what's underneaththe pinafore. Yes.

51
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:22,518
Look,I thinkhe's just developed a normal curiosityabout the human body.

52
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:23,810
You need to talk to him.

53
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:27,064
Remind him what's appropriateand what isn'T.

54
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,024
Of course.I will talk to him.

55
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,859
I'll talk to himtill I'm blue in the face.

56
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:32,528
I promise.

57
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:33,445
Take care.

58
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:37,366
Yes,louisa pate believed in the power of shame.

59
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:40,452
She always believed,when someone has that power...

60
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,621
so,mrs. Peeples,

61
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:46,792
you'll never guess what your daughter is willingto do for a gingersnap.

62
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,711
It's a shame not to use it.

Desperate housewives
Season 2 Episode 19

66
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,340
It had been six weeks

67
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:38,218
since andrew van de kamp had declared war

68
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,470
on his mother bree.

69
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:45,142
The final battle was about to be waged at the fairview county courthouse.

70
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:48,478
Bree knew it was about to get bloody.

71
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,814
What she didn't know was...

72
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,526
the calvary was on its way...

73
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,277
bree?

74
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:57,863
Whether she wanted them there or not.

75
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:58,530
Eleanor!

76
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,324
Oh,thank god I found you.

77
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,950
This place is a maze.

78
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:03,619
What are you doing here?

79
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:06,622
Well,your father and I got a call last night from danielle,

80
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:09,791
and she said that andrew was taking you to court.

81
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:13,587
I mean,to say that we were shocked would be an understatement.

82
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,881
Hello,I'm eleanor mason,

83
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,090
bree's stepmother.

84
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:18,634
You're the lawyer? We should talk.

85
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,719
Uh,no,I'm not her lawyer.

86
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,138
Good. The hair had me worried.

87
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:25,390
Peter is mom's sponsor from A.A.

88
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:27,601
Oh,sweetie!

89
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:29,937
since when are you in A.A.?

90
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:32,231
It's a recent development. Where's dad?

91
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:34,274
In chambers with the judge.

92
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:36,485
What?! Why?

93
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,237
Everything is fine.

94
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:40,072
The judge agreed to a postponement.

95
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:41,532
Oh,thank god!

96
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:42,658
Luckily,he remembered me.

97
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,243
I spoke once at his law school.

98
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:45,452
Pardon me,sir,

99
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:46,912
I'm your daughter's lawyer.

100
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:50,374
Just so you know,we've been waiting for this hearing for weeks,

101
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,918
son,I've been an attorney for 45 years.

102
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:57,381
You and I both know how these cases can turn into public spectacles.

103
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:01,134
Our family is perfectly capable of handling this

104
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:03,136
- ...in house. 
- Dad,you don't understand.

105
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:04,847
This has gotten really ugly.

106
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:06,265
That's why we're here.

107
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,434
We're gonna put this family back together.

108
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,521
Whatever it takes.

109
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,278
and that's when mr. And mrs. Solis,

110
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:22,406
fearing for the welfare of this helpless child,

111
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:23,740
fled the hospital.

112
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:26,368
You mean,they kidnapped her.

113
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,079
Well,technically,that's true,but

114
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:31,206
given the situation that led up to the rescue...

115
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,041
kidnapping.

116
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,044
Your honor,yes,

117
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,840
in retrospect,the plan was a little bit rash,not entirely well thought out.

118
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:41,216
Idiotic.

119
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,968
can we object to that?

120
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:45,596
But the child is safe,your honor.

121
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:49,391
And all we ask the court is to allow baby lily

122
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:53,395
a lifetime of the care and love she has been receiving

123
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,356
from the solises.

124
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:00,110
As much as your story tugs at my heart,

125
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:02,654
there is the issue of parental rights.

126
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,990
What does the state have to say about this?

127
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:09,369
We have located the biological father-- mr. Dale helm.

128
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:12,915
Unfortunately,uh,circumstances require that he be out of town.

129
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,583
He's in fort lauderdale today.

130
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,084
On business?

131
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:18,128
Spring break,actually.

132
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:20,255
Mr. Helm is a high school student.

133
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:21,381
Charming.

134
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:22,799
In between keg stands,

135
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:26,261
did the father happen to mention if he plans to waive parental rights?

136
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,305
I've left a number of voice mails,

137
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,642
but the only response I've gotten is a text message

138
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,477
that says

139
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,898
this "blows his mind" and he's extremely "bummed out."

140
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,654
All right...

141
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:46,156
mr. And mrs. Solis,

142
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:48,075
since you actually want lily,

143
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,953
it seems you're the lesser of two evils.

144
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:53,789
I'm granting you temporary custody until

145
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:56,375
we can get a straight answer from the birth father.

146
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,417
Thank you,

147
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:58,293
uh,your honor.

148
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:01,755
In the meantime,try not to steal any more babies.

149
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:04,049
Oh,we just needed the one.

150
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,266
sweetie?

151
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:15,561
Um,could you put the crayons down for a second?

152
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:17,020
We need to talk.

153
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,147
So I spoke to your teacher today,

154
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:21,483
and she told me about the...

155
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:26,154
cookie deal you made with cindy lou.

156
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,407
Oh. Are you mad?

157
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:30,492
no,not exactly.

158
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:31,702
I'm just...

159
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:34,496
I'm trying to understand why you...

160
00:07:35,164 --> 00:07:36,081
did that.

161
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:39,001
Tommy keenan told me babies come from down there.

162
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:41,253
It doesn't sound right to me.

163
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:42,629
Well...

164
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,674
actually,he's kinda right. He's got the concept down.

165
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:47,176
That's weird.

166
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:49,720
How's a baby get in there?

167
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:59,062
Daddy will be home from his business trip in a few days.

168
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:00,814
Why don't you wait for him?

169
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:03,358
- Okay. - Okay.

170
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,737
Or I can ask tommy's brother.

171
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:07,821
He's 14,

172
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:09,865
and he knows everything.

173
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:14,703
And then the mommy and the daddy,

174
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:16,914
because they love each other so much,

175
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:18,665
they hug.

176
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,375
Real tight.

177
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:24,588
And,uh,a seed is magically implanted.

178
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,340
and nine months later...

179
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:28,842
a baby is born. Here.

180
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,469
What kind of seed?

181
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:33,680
Oh,that's not important.

182
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:36,141
I don't believe you.

183
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:38,143
Parker,I'm your mother.

184
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,896
Mothers don't lie to their sons.

185
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:46,777
Now go wash your hands or santa's not gonna bring youanything for christmas.

186
00:08:52,074 --> 00:08:53,033
I just saw edie drive off.

187
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:54,326
How long is she gonna be gone?

188
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:56,161
I don't know.She just went to show a house.

189
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:57,412
Move.

190
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:00,541
What's the problem?

191
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:03,168
You mauled mein edie's bed last night.

192
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:05,504
I think that deservesa conversation.

193
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:08,257
Well,what's there to talkabout? I'm just a fool in love.

194
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,134
Oh,no!You don't mean that.

195
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:12,845
Yes,I do.

196
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,013
Look,I realizemy timing's a little off.

197
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,139
a little?

198
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:17,307
Ugh...

199
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:21,645
the helium hasn't evengone out of the balloons from your engagement party.

200
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,021
okay...

201
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:24,523
when are you gonna tell edie?

202
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:25,357
Tell her what?

203
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,900
- That the wedding's off.
- Is it?

204
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:29,027
- Well,isn't it?
- It's up to you.

205
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,363
Are... are you saying...

206
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:33,740
that you're gonnago through with this wedding...

207
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:35,409
unless I tell you not to?

208
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,035
Just give me a commitment,susie Q.,

209
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,412
And I'll put a bullet in edie.

210
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,664
This is insane!

211
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:42,374
Come on.

212
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,627
All thiscan be yours again.

213
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:47,796
Just say the word...

214
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:49,131
and I let go.

215
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:51,758
Oh,no!No,don't you dare!

216
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:55,137
You know you want me to.Just say it,susie Q.

217
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:57,431
You're...

218
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,600
sick!

219
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:04,021
zach,I'm going to the drugstore.

220
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,398
I'll be back in 20 minutes.

221
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,110
Whoa! Oh!

222
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:26,126
paul?!

223
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:30,422
I was making cookies,and iheard the most sickening thud.

224
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:32,341
Are you okay?

225
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:33,592
There'S...

226
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:35,969
shortening on my doorstep.

227
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:37,304
Shortening?

228
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:40,807
That's the last thingyou'd want on your front porch.

229
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:43,602
It's meant for baking.

230
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,323
She's so adorable

231
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:58,534
and I just love the name Lily

232
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,035
it wasmy grandmother's name.

233
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:02,329
So how you holding up?You must be exhausted.

234
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:04,790
You know,I'm a little tired, but it's not too bad.

235
00:11:04,957 --> 00:11:07,042
Oh,wait a couple months. She'll startsleeping through the night.

236
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:09,127
Oh,honey,please.Do I look like a masochist?

237
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:11,964
Firs thing tomorrow,I'm hiringa nanny and a night nurse.

238
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:13,632
No,we're not.

239
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:16,844
my husband,the comedian.

240
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:19,471
I'm serious. I don't wantsome stranger raising our baby.

241
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:23,267
Well,you guys are busy.We should go.

242
00:11:23,392 --> 00:11:25,727
No,it's okay.I'll win this battle later.

243
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:29,398
We are not gonna besome yuppie couple pawning off our kid on otherpeople.

244
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:31,149
- End of discussion. - Yeah,you should go.

245
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:34,403
Yeah.Okay,bye.

246
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,321
Good luck.

247
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:43,245
put down the burrito.

248
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:47,082
What is all this crapabout me not getting help?

249
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,459
Look,a brand-new babyneeds to bond with its mother.

250
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:52,171
The church knows it,scienceknows it,nature knows it.

251
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:55,090
We have the money. What is wrongwith getting a little help?

252
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:56,842
Then I'll be ableto relax once in a while,

253
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:58,719
and I'll be ableto be a better mother.

254
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:00,304
You wanna bea better mother?

255
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:01,180
Do what my mam* did--

256
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:02,681
make sacrifices.

257
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:05,100
My mam* worked her fingers to the bone for me.

258
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:08,270
And that's what put herin an early grave!

259
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:13,901
Well,thatand the hit-and-run thing.

260
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:23,660
look,I don't know whyyou want to be emancipated,

261
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:26,371
and I don't know what you'vebeen doing to drive him crazy.

262
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:27,706
Bottom line--

263
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:28,832
it's over.

264
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:32,461
It's now time for you twoto kiss and make up.

265
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:37,674
And just howare we supposed to do that?

266
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:39,426
Here's a thought...

267
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:42,095
just look each otherin the eye and say,

268
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:44,389
"I forgive you."

269
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,602
that's your solution?

270
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:51,980
It's actuallya technique invented by this dutch therapist.

271
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:53,482
I saw him on tv.

272
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:55,734
He says,if you verbalize forgiveness,

273
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:59,613
the brain can trick the heartinto letting go of resentment.

274
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:03,075
It really works. I did itwith our cleaning lady.

275
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:06,870
Um,I'm sorry,dad,but I thinkmy relationship with andrew

276
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:12,084
- is just a bit more complicatedthan--
- would it kill youto at least try?

277
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:13,585
I'll do it...

278
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:14,795
for you,grandpa.

279
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:16,547
That's my boy.

280
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,423
Bree?

281
00:13:21,385 --> 00:13:22,344
Fine!

282
00:13:22,553 --> 00:13:23,720
Yes,um...

283
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:26,098
so,um,who goes first?

284
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:28,267
Either or.Doesn't matter.

285
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:32,229
Mom,

286
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:34,064
I forgive you.

287
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,482
Andrew,

288
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:38,068
I forgive you.

289
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,446
That wasn't so hard,was it?

290
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,824
Now don't expectto feel differently right away.

291
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:45,617
It takes a while.

292
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,911
It took me a weekto forgive esperanza.

293
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:49,872
But now she's like family again.

294
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:51,707
Family who stole from us.

295
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,709
So let's get backto the way we were,

296
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:58,172
and forget all this nonsenseabout emancipation.

297
00:13:59,548 --> 00:14:01,341
Um...

298
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:06,722
well,grandpa,I'm--I'm stillgonna need my trust fund.

299
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:09,099
You see,I-I can't live in a place where I...

300
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:11,059
I don't feel safe.

301
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,229
What are you talking about?

302
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:17,524
Well,could you livewith a woman who hits you?

303
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,904
- Bree! 
- I slapped him once,and he deserved it.

304
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:24,114
Well,I just asked herto stop drinking.

305
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:25,199
You were drinking?

306
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:28,076
She's in A.A.Her sponsor has long hair.

307
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:30,204
Andrew,I find your concern ironic,

308
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:34,458
given how tanked you werewhen you ran over our neighbor's motherwith your car.

309
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:35,584
Is she okay?

310
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:38,045
She's dead!

311
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:38,837
Well...

312
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:42,090
mom watched as her boyfriendcommitted suicide.

313
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:44,510
And he was the same guy who killed dad!

314
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:48,388
Andrew falsely accused meof molestation...

315
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:51,308
in a mall!

316
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:58,732
You know,the technique works best if you don't talk right away.

317
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,195
Okay,let's go.

318
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,613
I don't wannabe late for the movie.

319
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:07,282
Oh,those are pretty.Who sent those?

320
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,285
What?

321
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:14,331
"Say the word and I'm yours.Love,karl."

322
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,667
Mom,I knew this would happen when you started hanging around together,

323
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,293
all of your old feeling sresurfacing.

324
00:15:18,377 --> 00:15:19,419
No,his feelings.

325
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:22,381
He's the one with the feelings,not me.

326
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:23,048
Uh-huh.

327
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:26,552
Okay,don't "uh-huh" me. You'renot old enough to do that.

328
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,136
Oh,no?Well,how do you like this--

329
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,805
I'm not gonna go to the movies with you.

330
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:31,431
You're gonna make mego by myself?

331
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:32,891
Well,you could alwaysask dad to go.

332
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:35,352
In fact,if you love him so much, why don't you marry him?

333
00:15:35,394 --> 00:15:39,106
Oh,wait,you already did. Twice.

334
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:09,595
Oh,you know what? I think we're gonna needsome napkins with this.

335
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:11,305
Oh,okay,I'll go back.

336
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:12,556
Thanks.

337
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:15,142
My ex-boyfriend's here.If he sees me alone,I'll die.

338
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:17,394
I'm begging you,please,act like you know me.

339
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:19,771
Susan? Hey!

340
00:16:19,855 --> 00:16:22,566

341
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,902

343
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:31,867
Um,mike,I-I want you to meet...

344
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:35,787

345
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,123
Nice to meet you,mike.

346
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:43,462
Wow,I can't believe I'm finally seeingthe man himself in the flesh.

347
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:47,716
So... how'd you two meet?

348
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:51,094
Oh,god,I've beenher dentist for years.

349
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,847
but last week,I was looking in her mouth

350
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:55,724
and decidedto stick my tongue in it.

351
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:03,273
I'll see ya,susan.

352
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:07,402
thank you so muchfor helping me out.

353
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:09,905
Hey,I'm great in a crisis.

354
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:12,741
well,I definitely pickedthe right person to sit next to.

355
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,080
Actually,is this seat taken?

356
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:21,166
- No. 
- Okay,you can sharemy popcorn.

357
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:24,962
Um,susan...

358
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:26,755
this is becky.

359
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:29,675
I'll probably be sharing her popcorn.

360
00:17:32,344 --> 00:17:35,848
I'll just waittill the lights go out, and then I'll...

361
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:45,023
while I get this going,can you bring out the buns?

362
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:46,108
Uh,yeah.

363
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:52,489
- what the hell?- You all right?

364
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,913
This isn't lighter fluid.It's gasoline.

365
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:01,415
What?

366
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:03,417
How'd that get in there?

367
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:06,628
How do you think?

368
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:13,177
Something smells goodover there.

369
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:16,513
Well,I don't understand.

370
00:18:16,555 --> 00:18:18,015
Is she trying to kill you?

371
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:20,642
No,she's tryingto piss me off.

372
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:21,852
Why?

373
00:18:21,894 --> 00:18:23,562
I'm not sure yet,

374
00:18:23,896 --> 00:18:26,607
but I do knowI'm not gonna play along.

375
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:29,776
We got plenty of burgersif you want to pop over.

376
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,404
And bring your appetite.

377
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:43,373
gaby,the baby.

378
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:49,046
No,I got up twice already.It's your turn.

379
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:52,883
Gaby,I have severaljob interviews tomorrow. I need my sleep.

380
00:18:53,675 --> 00:18:55,802
What about my sleep?

381
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:01,475
You sleepwhen the baby sleeps.

382
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:04,436
Every 40 minutes? When am I supposedto have a life?

383
00:19:05,938 --> 00:19:07,356
What are you whining about?

384
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:09,441
You know,xiao-mei doesall the housework around here.

385
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:11,235
All you have to dois take care of the baby.

386
00:19:11,235 --> 00:19:13,987
Fine,fine,fine!

387
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:20,160
xiao-mei.

388
00:19:20,911 --> 00:19:22,204
wake up.

389
00:19:22,246 --> 00:19:24,122
Mrs. Solis?

390
00:19:24,832 --> 00:19:25,707
Something wrong?

391
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:28,418
the baby won't stop crying, and I haven't sleptfor two days.

392
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:30,879
Will you please take lily for a while?

393
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,758
oh,come on. I won't make youdo windows tomorrow.

394
00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:37,553
Okay.

395
00:19:37,845 --> 00:19:39,096
What do I do?

396
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,348
Well,she's a baby.You hold her.

397
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,561
You bounce her and, I don't know,maybe sing a little something.

398
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,980
Ahh.

399
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:49,857
Oh,and xiao-mei,

400
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:52,192
mr. Solis does not need to know about this,okay?

401
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:54,528
- Okay. - Okay.

402
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:02,619
yeah,honey,can youtake that downstairs?

403
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:04,371
Thank you.

404
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:14,047
Eleanor,I thought you'd gone to bed.

405
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:16,633
Oh,no,not yet.I had to do my hair now.

406
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:19,011
There's never enough timein the morning.

407
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:20,721
Uh,sit.

408
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:23,265
There's somethingI have to discuss with you.

409
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:28,937
Your father and ihave decided to take andrew back to rhode islandwith us.

410
00:20:29,021 --> 00:20:30,272
Really?

411
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:32,399
And whose idea was that?

412
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:34,026
Andrew'S.

413
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:37,529
But henry and I feelit's the right thing to do.

414
00:20:39,281 --> 00:20:41,283
Absolutely not.

415
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:45,871
If we leave him here,

416
00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:48,165
the two of youwill wind up in court,

417
00:20:48,332 --> 00:20:50,250
and I'm notgoing to allow that.

418
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:55,255
Do you really think that I am enjoying airingmy dirty laundry in public?

419
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:58,425
This whole situationis mortifying.

420
00:20:58,592 --> 00:21:00,844
But I can't back downbecause he is my son,

421
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:03,514
and I need more timeto get through to him.

422
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:05,474
You never give up.

423
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:10,270
I've always admired thatabout you.

424
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:11,021
When you were a kid,

425
00:21:11,188 --> 00:21:15,901
you used to makethese peanut butter cookies that were god-awful.

426
00:21:16,068 --> 00:21:17,528
But you kept baking them,

427
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:21,240
and you kept forcing everyoneto eat them.

428
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:25,536
you were so determinedto get them right.

429
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:28,455
My mother didn't thinkthey were awful.

430
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:30,749
When I made those same cookiesfor her,

431
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,376
she loved them.

432
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:36,547
Well,some peoplepraise children even whenthey don't deserve it.

433
00:21:36,672 --> 00:21:38,549
Oh,but not you.

434
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:41,802
With you,I had to work forevery kind word I ever got.

435
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:44,972
Well,you always resented mebecause of my high standards.

436
00:21:45,055 --> 00:21:46,431
No.

437
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:51,395
I resented you because those were kick-asspeanut butter cookies.

438
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:55,858
We're taking andrew.

439
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:57,985
Eleanor,please...

440
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:00,153
he hates you,bree.

441
00:22:00,237 --> 00:22:03,073
Your own son.

442
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:06,702
You know,part of being an adult is admitting

443
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:10,497
that you've failed, and then moving on...

444
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:13,876
with grace.

445
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:20,048
Do you really think that I ama failure as a parent?

446
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:22,718
well,I'd love to lieand say something supportive,

447
00:22:22,843 --> 00:22:24,636
but as you pointed out,

448
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,806
that was moreyour mother's thing.

449
00:22:38,192 --> 00:22:40,235
Xiao-mei?

450
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:43,030
So sorry.I just take break.

451
00:22:43,113 --> 00:22:44,364
Oh,no,xiao-mei,that's okay.

452
00:22:44,615 --> 00:22:46,742
That's okay. I know you were up all nightwith the baby,

453
00:22:46,825 --> 00:22:48,702
and I reallyappreciate it.

454
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:52,122
You know,I'm very grateful for everythingyou've been doing for lily.

455
00:22:52,206 --> 00:22:55,751
So to thank you,I bought youa gift certificate to my spa.

456
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:58,962
And you can take a whole day offand just really pamper yourself.

457
00:22:59,213 --> 00:23:00,464
- Really?- Mm-hmm.

458
00:23:00,881 --> 00:23:01,924
Thank you!

459
00:23:02,216 --> 00:23:03,175
Oh,thank you!

460
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:04,426
Oh,you're welcome.

461
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:06,720
All right,lily needsto be bathed and put to bed.

462
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:08,722
I don't wanna missmy yoga class.

463
00:23:08,889 --> 00:23:11,683
Hi. Hi,pretty girl.

464
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:14,353
Oh,yes,mommy has to go.

465
00:23:14,478 --> 00:23:15,812
Mommy has to go,

466
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:20,025
so she can stay pretty and thinand you can be proud of her.

467
00:23:21,902 --> 00:23:23,779
motherhoodis such a blessing.

468
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:27,199
I hope you getto experience it one day.

469
00:23:32,663 --> 00:23:33,747
becauseit's not a big deal!

470
00:23:33,914 --> 00:23:35,833
- "it's not a big deal"? Okay! 
- It's not that far away.

471
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:39,002
- Right. Oh,it's notthat far away? 
- Dude,it--whatever,okay?

472
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:42,464
You didn't even care to tell me before?Bye.

473
00:23:46,301 --> 00:23:48,011
justin,what happened?

474
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:51,431
Andrew just told me he'smoving in with his grandparents.

475
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:54,852
They live so far away, I'm never gonnasee him anymore.

476
00:23:54,977 --> 00:23:58,063
I'm so sorry. I know that you're good friends.

477
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:02,651
We're more than friends,mrs. Van de kamp.

478
00:24:03,944 --> 00:24:06,321
I love him.

479
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:08,657
Oh.

480
00:24:09,825 --> 00:24:11,577
Why?

481
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,536
Why?

482
00:24:12,661 --> 00:24:17,374
Yes.I'd be curious to know just what it isyou see in him.

483
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:22,129
Well,when my parentsfirst heard I was gay, they kicked me out.

484
00:24:22,504 --> 00:24:25,340
They said I had debasedthe entire family

485
00:24:25,424 --> 00:24:29,136
and that they couldn'tlove me anymore until I changed.

486
00:24:29,845 --> 00:24:30,804
But andrew--

487
00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:33,682
he said that i should be ashamed of them,

488
00:24:33,765 --> 00:24:36,894
'cause they were too stupidto know how great I was.

489
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:39,646
That's the thingabout andrew.

490
00:24:40,022 --> 00:24:44,193
He doesn't take crapfrom anyone. How can you notlove someone like that?

491
00:24:46,028 --> 00:24:47,946
You know,it never ceases to amaze me

492
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:50,949
how people can turn their backson their own family.

493
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:53,535
I mean--but it happensevery day,doesn't it?

494
00:24:53,744 --> 00:24:55,245
I guess.

495
00:24:56,121 --> 00:24:58,415
You know,justin,if youwould be willing to help,

496
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:02,419
I'm pretty sure that I could find a wayto keep andrew from moving.

497
00:25:02,503 --> 00:25:05,005
What do you say?

498
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:10,886
I'm home.

499
00:25:10,928 --> 00:25:13,347
- Oh,hi. - Hey,mrs. Mccluskey.

500
00:25:14,389 --> 00:25:16,683
So how did everything go?

501
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,185
Fine.

502
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,645
Penny fussed a bit.

503
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:21,271
I think her molars are coming in.

504
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:22,314
Oh.

505
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:25,025
And the twinsfought over the remote. There's nothing new there.

506
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,151
No.

507
00:25:26,318 --> 00:25:26,902
here's the big news--

508
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:30,989
parker offered me a fudgsicleif I would show him my vagina.

509
00:25:35,202 --> 00:25:37,120
Oh,good god,lynette,relax.I didn't do it.

510
00:25:37,287 --> 00:25:39,456
I just got thisout of the freezer a second ago.

511
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:41,083
Uh,yeah. Of course.No,sorry.

512
00:25:41,208 --> 00:25:43,794
Apparently,parker wanted to puta sunflower seed inside me

513
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,420
and see if a baby would grow.

514
00:25:45,504 --> 00:25:47,548
Where do kids get this stuff?

515
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:49,883
Oh... that was me.

516
00:25:49,967 --> 00:25:52,719
He was asking aboutthe birds and the bees, and I

517
00:25:52,886 --> 00:25:55,430
fudgeda few of the details.

518
00:25:56,557 --> 00:25:58,976
Well,he's only 7 years old.

519
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:01,436
I don't think he needsto know everything yet.

520
00:26:01,562 --> 00:26:04,106
I don't wanna rob himof his innocence.

521
00:26:04,231 --> 00:26:06,275
Well,now,that's where you're wrong.

522
00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:08,402
You get 'emwhen they're young.

523
00:26:08,527 --> 00:26:10,821
Give themall the gory details.

524
00:26:10,946 --> 00:26:14,074
And then when they're goodand disgusted,you shame 'em.

525
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:15,576
Excuse me?

526
00:26:15,784 --> 00:26:19,413
You tell themsex is dirty and wrong and he shouldn'ttalk about it,

527
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:21,665
and if he does,he's going straight to hell.

528
00:26:22,291 --> 00:26:24,793
that is ridiculous.

529
00:26:24,877 --> 00:26:26,628
Spoken likea true liberal idiot.

530
00:26:26,712 --> 00:26:29,006
No,I'm notgonna shame my son.

531
00:26:29,548 --> 00:26:32,050
Mm,I'm telling ya,it works.

532
00:26:32,134 --> 00:26:33,802
It keeps peoplein their place,

533
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:36,221
it keeps parentsfrom being humiliated,

534
00:26:36,388 --> 00:26:41,351
and it keeps me fromhaving to spend the afternoon talking about my woo-woo.

535
00:26:49,943 --> 00:26:52,779
In your haste to duck out beforethe credits rolled,you...

536
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:56,950
oh,my god!Oh,thank you so much.

537
00:26:57,284 --> 00:26:58,243
I stuck a card in there,

538
00:26:58,368 --> 00:27:02,414
just in case you ever wanted to purposely sit next to meat a movie,so...

539
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:06,043
orson,I'm flattered.Uh,really.

540
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,295
you--you don't wanna date me.

541
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:11,507
I-I mean,my love life is justso complicated right now.

542
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:15,177
Well... no,I won't bore youwith the details.

543
00:27:15,886 --> 00:27:19,056
So the ex-boyfriend has no ideayou're secretly married to the ex-husband,

544
00:27:19,097 --> 00:27:20,390
who still loves you,

545
00:27:20,474 --> 00:27:22,684
but unless you give hima reason not to,

546
00:27:22,768 --> 00:27:24,853
is gonna marrythe neighborhood slut?

547
00:27:24,895 --> 00:27:26,355
Did I call edie a slut?

548
00:27:26,897 --> 00:27:28,607
Well,that's overstating it.Edie's not a slut.

549
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:31,944
She's just... popularwith indiscriminate men.

550
00:27:32,069 --> 00:27:33,237
Anyway...

551
00:27:33,445 --> 00:27:34,947
yes,those arethe relevant players.

552
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:35,739
Okay.

553
00:27:35,864 --> 00:27:38,200
Now I'm absolutelyhorrified that I'm about to saywhat I'm about to say,

554
00:27:38,325 --> 00:27:40,869
but there's nobody else I cantalk to who won't judge me.

555
00:27:40,953 --> 00:27:43,121
And sinceyou're a complete stranger, I'll probablynever see you again

556
00:27:43,205 --> 00:27:44,915
unless I randomlyrun into you on the street,

557
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,377
in which case,you'll ignore me'cause you know how crazy I am.

558
00:27:49,503 --> 00:27:51,547
So here goes...

559
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:56,134
I'm having feelingsfor karl again.

560
00:27:57,344 --> 00:27:59,805
does that make mea terrible person?

561
00:28:00,681 --> 00:28:03,183
You wantmy unvarnished opinion?

562
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,018
Lay it on me.

563
00:28:05,102 --> 00:28:06,603
It doesn't make youa terrible person,

564
00:28:06,645 --> 00:28:08,480
but it does make you A...

565
00:28:08,981 --> 00:28:11,358
well... a sucker.

566
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,151
This karl's a coward.

567
00:28:13,151 --> 00:28:15,863
He wants you to be the heavyand take all the responsibility.

568
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:18,365
If you're having feelingsfor a guy like that, I say run

569
00:28:18,448 --> 00:28:19,992
...far,far away.

570
00:28:20,117 --> 00:28:22,202
He lives three houses down.

571
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:25,414
Hmm.Well,good luck to you,then.

572
00:28:28,417 --> 00:28:31,920
but like I said,if you'reinterested in a tooth whitening,

573
00:28:32,045 --> 00:28:34,715
my card'sstill in your wallet.

574
00:28:40,137 --> 00:28:42,097
Xiao-mei?

575
00:28:43,557 --> 00:28:44,975
Xiao-mei?

576
00:28:45,142 --> 00:28:47,269
I'm late to meetmrs. Van de kamp.

577
00:28:47,394 --> 00:28:49,479
I'll be backin a little while.

578
00:28:57,196 --> 00:28:58,906
bree...I'm so sorry I'm late.

579
00:28:58,947 --> 00:29:00,532
Oh,honey,it's all right.

580
00:29:00,532 --> 00:29:04,161
I mean,with the new baby at home, I'm surprisedyou made it at all.

581
00:29:04,536 --> 00:29:07,706
Ooh,I'll have a drink.Anything with an umbrella.

582
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:11,418
So tell me,how are you doing?

583
00:29:11,543 --> 00:29:14,713
I mean,your entire worldmust be turned upside down.

584
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,715
You must be exhausted.

585
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:20,511
You know,it's been challenging,but I-I soldier on. (Chuckles)

586
00:29:20,594 --> 00:29:22,513
so what about you?You look so rested.

587
00:29:22,554 --> 00:29:24,848
I just got a massageat misty spring.

588
00:29:24,848 --> 00:29:28,435
Things have beena little tense at home, and I needed an hourto relax.

589
00:29:28,602 --> 00:29:30,896
Good for you.I love that spa.

590
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,316
oh,by the way,while I was there, I saw your,uh,

591
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:35,484
your housekeeper.

592
00:29:35,651 --> 00:29:36,985
Xiao-mei?

593
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:40,864
Oh,no,you must be mistaken. I just left her.

594
00:29:40,948 --> 00:29:42,241
She's at home working.

595
00:29:42,282 --> 00:29:45,911
Are you sure? I was talkingto her in the steam room for about 20 minutes.

596
00:29:46,036 --> 00:29:46,703
- What? - Yeah,

597
00:29:46,829 --> 00:29:49,665
apparently you gave hera gift certificate.

598
00:29:58,674 --> 00:29:59,550
lily?

599
00:29:59,591 --> 00:30:02,386
Lily,mommy's coming!

600
00:30:03,428 --> 00:30:07,641
Oh,thank god!Oh,honey,I'm so sorry.

601
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:11,645
I'm never gonnaleave you again. Oh!

602
00:30:12,729 --> 00:30:14,481
Yes. Yes.

603
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:17,276
I'm home!

604
00:30:18,443 --> 00:30:20,070
My interview got canceled.

605
00:30:20,529 --> 00:30:23,532
oh,that's my little girl.

606
00:30:23,657 --> 00:30:26,577
Your chakra lining up nicefor mommy?

607
00:30:28,287 --> 00:30:29,997
That's my girl.

608
00:30:31,248 --> 00:30:33,333
hey,let me take her off your chest so you can do your yoga.

609
00:30:33,417 --> 00:30:36,712
No! No,no,no.We're doing just fine.

610
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,547
Aren't we,lily?

611
00:30:51,727 --> 00:30:53,854
bridezilla's got meauditioning wedding bands,

612
00:30:53,896 --> 00:30:56,398
and I'm clueless aboutedie's taste in music.

613
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,025
What do you thinkof these guys?

614
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:59,818
That's why you brought me down here?

615
00:30:59,902 --> 00:31:02,112
Karl,you made it sound likeit was an emergency.

616
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:04,448
It is! I need to have somebodyto dance with

617
00:31:04,573 --> 00:31:08,702
so I can see if these guys have the powerto help me get my groove on.

618
00:31:08,869 --> 00:31:10,913
Karl...uh-oh!

619
00:31:12,122 --> 00:31:12,789
Oh,that's right.

620
00:31:12,915 --> 00:31:15,083
You like it laid-backand romantic,don't you?

621
00:31:15,209 --> 00:31:16,960
Guys,can we playsomething mellow?

622
00:31:17,169 --> 00:31:19,254
No,don't bother,'cause I'm going.

623
00:31:19,463 --> 00:31:22,090
two...

624
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:27,638
- you are so beautiful... 
- that was nota coincidence.

625
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:33,393
This was playingthe night we first kissed.

626
00:31:33,602 --> 00:31:35,521
it's our song. Remember?

627
00:31:35,687 --> 00:31:37,231
I remember.

628
00:31:37,397 --> 00:31:40,359
I also remember that you are planningon marrying someone else.

629
00:31:40,484 --> 00:31:42,152
Not if you don'twant me to.

630
00:31:43,612 --> 00:31:45,280
Come on,susie Q.

631
00:31:45,322 --> 00:31:47,032
I can see you stillhave feelings for me,

632
00:31:47,032 --> 00:31:50,702
and I know I havenever stopped loving you.

633
00:31:50,786 --> 00:31:51,745
Okay,you want the truth?

634
00:31:51,787 --> 00:31:53,497
I don't knowhow I feel about you,

635
00:31:53,539 --> 00:31:54,832
but I keep looking at you,

636
00:31:54,873 --> 00:31:57,793
trying to see if you've changed,if you've grown up.

637
00:31:57,876 --> 00:31:59,837
You know what I see?

638
00:32:00,295 --> 00:32:04,383
I see the same weak coward that walked out on methree years ago.

639
00:32:04,466 --> 00:32:06,718
Of course I've changed.

640
00:32:07,261 --> 00:32:09,346
I don't think so.

641
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:16,770
so I think you shouldprobably stay with edie.

642
00:32:17,771 --> 00:32:19,648
and the band is good.

643
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:22,359
You should hire 'em.

644
00:32:54,057 --> 00:32:55,642
what the hell?

645
00:32:58,687 --> 00:32:59,897
For god's sakes...

646
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,106
what the hellare you doing in there?!

647
00:33:01,231 --> 00:33:03,066
This is my house.What are you doing?

648
00:33:03,108 --> 00:33:05,152
We're tenting for termites.We got a work order.

649
00:33:05,235 --> 00:33:06,361
Signed by who?

650
00:33:06,612 --> 00:33:08,447
Paul...

651
00:33:08,572 --> 00:33:11,533
I've never been so embarrassedin my whole life.

652
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:13,702
They're supposedto be tenting my house.

653
00:33:13,827 --> 00:33:16,580
I must've writtenthe address down wrong.

654
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:20,667
muchachos,mi casa est* aqu?

655
00:33:20,792 --> 00:33:22,503
You've taken it too farthis time.

656
00:33:22,544 --> 00:33:24,087
These little mind gamesare gonna stop

657
00:33:24,171 --> 00:33:25,714
right now!

658
00:33:27,257 --> 00:33:29,635
and ifthey don't,whatcha gonna do?

659
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,346
Blow out your brainslike your wife did?

660
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:34,890
- ahh! 
- hey,hey!

661
00:33:35,849 --> 00:33:38,185
- Hey,you okay?
- Did you hear that?

662
00:33:38,769 --> 00:33:41,271
He assaulted mefor an honest mistake.

663
00:33:41,313 --> 00:33:43,815
God knows what would've happenedif you hadn't been here.

664
00:33:43,857 --> 00:33:44,525
Let go!

665
00:33:44,691 --> 00:33:46,693
Dad,dad,dad.Come on.

666
00:33:46,777 --> 00:33:49,404
Come on.Come on,okay?

667
00:33:55,577 --> 00:33:58,789
I talked to mrs. Mccluskey,and for god's sakes,parker,

668
00:33:58,956 --> 00:34:01,416
you can't ask people things like that.

669
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,376
Why?

670
00:34:02,543 --> 00:34:04,503
Because...

671
00:34:04,837 --> 00:34:05,963
it's rude.

672
00:34:06,171 --> 00:34:07,130
I said "please."

673
00:34:07,297 --> 00:34:09,258
Well,that doesn't matter!

674
00:34:09,341 --> 00:34:12,761
You gotta quit talkingto people about their bodies,

675
00:34:12,803 --> 00:34:15,931
and about where,you know,babies come from.

676
00:34:16,014 --> 00:34:20,394
- Why?
- because it's notan appropriate subject.

677
00:34:20,561 --> 00:34:21,520
Why?

678
00:34:21,603 --> 00:34:23,605
Because it's not.

679
00:34:23,981 --> 00:34:24,940
- Why? - Ugh!

680
00:34:25,023 --> 00:34:28,694
Because it's dirty and wrong, and I'll wash your mouth outwith soap! That's why.

681
00:34:30,988 --> 00:34:32,072
In that moment,

682
00:34:32,114 --> 00:34:36,952
lynette saw a look on her son's face she had never seen before...

683
00:34:37,035 --> 00:34:39,163
and she thought of the look he had on his face

684
00:34:39,288 --> 00:34:42,332
when he had become obsessed with dinosaurs...

685
00:34:42,457 --> 00:34:44,626
obsessed with baseball

686
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:47,045
and obsessed with trains.

687
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:48,839
And it occurred to lynette

688
00:34:49,006 --> 00:34:51,633
she didn't need to shame her son.

689
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:55,762
All he needed was a brand-new obsession.

690
00:34:56,763 --> 00:34:58,932
But I thought you saidwe couldn't have a puppy.

691
00:34:59,016 --> 00:35:00,767
Well...

692
00:35:01,143 --> 00:35:03,187
it turns outwe really needed one.

693
00:35:03,312 --> 00:35:04,813
You can go and play.

694
00:35:05,105 --> 00:35:07,399
And though she didn't know it at the time,

695
00:35:07,482 --> 00:35:09,651
it would be another three years

696
00:35:09,776 --> 00:35:15,032
before parker scavo would ever ask about sex again.

697
00:35:17,826 --> 00:35:19,453
Karl. What's going on?

698
00:35:20,162 --> 00:35:21,872
Uh,I'm on my wayto a motel.

699
00:35:22,289 --> 00:35:24,875
I-I just wanted to let you knowthat the wedding is off.

700
00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:26,460
It is?

701
00:35:26,502 --> 00:35:28,295
I told edieI wasn't in love with her--

702
00:35:28,629 --> 00:35:31,590
at least,not in the waythat she deserves.

703
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:33,509
Wow.

704
00:35:35,302 --> 00:35:36,512
Why did you changeyour mind?

705
00:35:36,595 --> 00:35:38,138
I mean,I hope it wasn't because of me,because I told you--

706
00:35:38,222 --> 00:35:40,265
it wasn't for you.

707
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:42,518
No?

708
00:35:43,268 --> 00:35:44,853
You were right.

709
00:35:45,354 --> 00:35:46,688
I have been a coward.

710
00:35:46,855 --> 00:35:48,190
I was a coward three years ago

711
00:35:48,232 --> 00:35:51,401
when I walked out on the two most important peoplein my life.

712
00:35:51,443 --> 00:35:54,363
And I was being a cowardwith edie.

713
00:35:54,655 --> 00:35:57,741
I mean,to even consider marrying her

714
00:35:57,825 --> 00:36:03,622
when I know what real passionand real love feels like.

715
00:36:05,457 --> 00:36:09,253
Anyway,I-I-I just thoughtI'd let you know.

716
00:36:10,462 --> 00:36:12,548
Karl...

717
00:36:15,092 --> 00:36:17,636
you look pretty beat up.

718
00:36:18,804 --> 00:36:21,515
why--why don't you...why don't you come in and...

719
00:36:21,598 --> 00:36:23,267
we'll crack opena bottle of wine.

720
00:36:23,433 --> 00:36:25,018
Come on.

721
00:36:30,649 --> 00:36:31,859
All right,here we go.

722
00:36:31,984 --> 00:36:33,443
This is the lastof andrew's things.

723
00:36:33,485 --> 00:36:36,572
Once we tape up these boxes,we can start loading the car.

724
00:36:36,613 --> 00:36:37,948
I'm proud of you,bree.

725
00:36:38,031 --> 00:36:39,950
You're being awfully bigabout this.

726
00:36:40,033 --> 00:36:43,412
Well,I have to admit,I was a bit upset at first.

727
00:36:43,453 --> 00:36:44,872
But then it hit me.

728
00:36:44,913 --> 00:36:47,666
You're his grandparents. You should bond,

729
00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:50,252
get to know the real andrew.

730
00:36:50,586 --> 00:36:52,171
oh,dad,I-I forgot to warn you.

731
00:36:52,254 --> 00:36:54,047
These are someof andrew's adult videos.

732
00:36:54,173 --> 00:36:57,259
I don't approve,but boys will be boys.

733
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,890
Oh,henry,stop looking at that filth.

734
00:37:03,473 --> 00:37:05,100
I don't get it.

735
00:37:05,642 --> 00:37:07,269
Where are the women?

736
00:37:07,811 --> 00:37:09,146
What are you talking about?

737
00:37:09,188 --> 00:37:11,481
This is all just a bunch of...

738
00:37:11,523 --> 00:37:12,983
naked men.

739
00:37:13,066 --> 00:37:16,111
Sweet mother of god.What the hell are they doing?

740
00:37:16,278 --> 00:37:19,031
I don't know,and I don'teven know what I'm looking at.

741
00:37:19,031 --> 00:37:22,701
Henry,this is pornographyfor ho-homosexuals.

742
00:37:23,035 --> 00:37:25,370
Oh,shoot! I wish youhadn't gone through that.

743
00:37:25,454 --> 00:37:27,581
Now we have to havean unpleasant conversation,

744
00:37:27,623 --> 00:37:29,875
and we were havingsuch a nice time.

745
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:31,293
Bree,is...

746
00:37:31,752 --> 00:37:33,837
is andrew... gay?

747
00:37:33,879 --> 00:37:35,964
Oh,dad,andrew hates labels.

748
00:37:36,048 --> 00:37:37,216
I'm sure it's just a phase.

749
00:37:37,299 --> 00:37:38,759
Excuse me,

750
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,803
but he has a magazine titled"leather daddies in love."

751
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:43,847
That does not sound likea phase to me.

752
00:37:44,014 --> 00:37:49,102
Maybe not,but it's no longer my concern now that he'll be livingwith you.

753
00:37:51,688 --> 00:37:54,483
We have to havea serious talk.

754
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,777
Let's don't freak outabout this.

755
00:37:57,319 --> 00:37:58,737
The dutch therapist says--

756
00:37:58,862 --> 00:38:02,699
forget the dutch therapist!In the kitchen!

757
00:38:02,741 --> 00:38:04,660
now!

758
00:38:12,835 --> 00:38:14,086
hey,where's grandma and grandpa?

759
00:38:14,169 --> 00:38:15,838
I need to startloading up my stuff.

760
00:38:15,921 --> 00:38:18,382
Oh,they,uh,they already left.

761
00:38:18,715 --> 00:38:20,551
Wait... they left?

762
00:38:20,801 --> 00:38:21,635
Without me?

763
00:38:21,635 --> 00:38:23,887
Uh,yeah,they wrote you a letter.

764
00:38:29,434 --> 00:38:32,729
It seems they came acrosssome personal items of yours that, um,

765
00:38:33,021 --> 00:38:33,981
upset them.

766
00:38:34,064 --> 00:38:36,066
They're taking awaymy trust fund?

767
00:38:36,191 --> 00:38:37,234
They can't do that!

768
00:38:37,317 --> 00:38:38,819
Well,actually they can.

769
00:38:38,902 --> 00:38:43,031
I mean,it's their money todispense with as they see fit.

770
00:38:43,699 --> 00:38:45,325
I knowit doesn't seem fair,but--

771
00:38:45,325 --> 00:38:48,579
no,it's really unfair. In fact,it sucks.

772
00:38:49,454 --> 00:38:51,123
What--what am I supposedto do now?

773
00:38:51,206 --> 00:38:53,750
Well,now that you can't affordto become emancipated,

774
00:38:53,792 --> 00:38:56,336
I guess you're gonnahave to stay here with me.

775
00:38:57,713 --> 00:39:00,507
Andrew,we can make this work.

776
00:39:00,924 --> 00:39:03,385
We just haveto let go of our anger.

777
00:39:04,636 --> 00:39:06,346
No.

778
00:39:09,683 --> 00:39:13,478
Oh,I,um,had a chance to have a nice chatwith justin the other day.

779
00:39:13,645 --> 00:39:15,439
He really seems very sweet.

780
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:19,776
I've invited him overfor dinner tonight. I hope you don't mind.

781
00:39:28,327 --> 00:39:31,872
Now I wish I hadn'ttorched our wedding photos.

782
00:39:33,916 --> 00:39:36,084
who would've thought, after everythingthat's happened,

783
00:39:36,126 --> 00:39:38,545
that we would'veended up back here again?

784
00:39:38,712 --> 00:39:40,756
It's beenone hell of a ride,huh?

785
00:39:40,964 --> 00:39:43,133
Yeah.

786
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:46,303
so how do you feel now?

787
00:39:46,637 --> 00:39:48,096
About us?

788
00:39:49,181 --> 00:39:51,892
I feel good.

789
00:39:52,434 --> 00:39:53,810
I feel happy.

790
00:39:53,852 --> 00:39:55,854
You're not havingsecond thoughts?

791
00:39:56,897 --> 00:39:59,483
I can't believe you actuallywant to talk about feelings.

792
00:39:59,608 --> 00:40:00,901
You really have changed.

793
00:40:00,984 --> 00:40:03,153
Hey,this is the new karl,baby.

794
00:40:03,153 --> 00:40:05,364
He's not afraid to cry.

795
00:40:09,701 --> 00:40:10,828
hello?

796
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,831
oh,hi,edie.

797
00:40:14,081 --> 00:40:15,290
Uh...

798
00:40:15,541 --> 00:40:17,167
yeah,he's here.

799
00:40:17,292 --> 00:40:18,043
Hold on.

800
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:19,753
how doesshe know you're here?

801
00:40:20,003 --> 00:40:21,338
I don't know.

802
00:40:22,923 --> 00:40:24,174
hi. Ahem.

803
00:40:25,634 --> 00:40:29,263
Yeah,I just came by to helpjulie with her civics homework.

804
00:40:29,805 --> 00:40:31,265
Uh-huh.

805
00:40:31,598 --> 00:40:34,685
Okay,I'll take care of it.What kind of juice do you want?

806
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,854
Right. Bye,bye.

807
00:40:37,354 --> 00:40:39,648
Are you getting juicefor her?

808
00:40:39,773 --> 00:40:41,191
Yeah,just one carton.

809
00:40:41,775 --> 00:40:43,318
You rippedthe woman's heart out.

810
00:40:43,443 --> 00:40:45,195
Why would she want juicefrom you?

811
00:40:45,237 --> 00:40:47,823
Okay. now don't freak out,

812
00:40:47,865 --> 00:40:50,826
but this breakup issort of a work in progress.

813
00:40:50,868 --> 00:40:52,202
She doesn't know?

814
00:40:52,286 --> 00:40:53,912
Will you calm down?I can explain.

815
00:40:54,037 --> 00:40:58,083
So if edie doesn't know,then that means that you just cheatedon her...

816
00:40:58,167 --> 00:40:59,168
with me!

817
00:40:59,251 --> 00:41:00,794
You made me the other woman!

818
00:41:00,836 --> 00:41:01,879
Please don't be angry.

819
00:41:01,962 --> 00:41:03,213
I tried to break up with her,

820
00:41:03,255 --> 00:41:05,174
but because I wasn't sureyou wanted me back,

821
00:41:05,299 --> 00:41:07,050
the words just wouldn'tcome out of my mouth.

822
00:41:07,092 --> 00:41:09,219
Now that I know thatyou want me and love me again,

823
00:41:09,303 --> 00:41:10,637
it's a done deal.

824
00:41:10,888 --> 00:41:14,266
get out of my house,you miserable son of a bitch!

825
00:41:14,349 --> 00:41:15,434
can't we talk about this?

826
00:41:15,517 --> 00:41:17,853
No,just get out!Get out!

827
00:41:17,978 --> 00:41:18,896
Susie,susie!

828
00:41:19,021 --> 00:41:20,689
Our marriage was garbage!

829
00:41:20,814 --> 00:41:23,400
- Stupid,disgusting pile of garbage!
- No,no,don't say that.

830
00:41:23,442 --> 00:41:26,028
And I regret everything that came of it!Don't do this right now.

831
00:41:26,069 --> 00:41:27,946
Ugh! Except you,honey.You're my rock.

832
00:41:28,113 --> 00:41:30,032
Ooh,out! Get out!

833
00:41:30,115 --> 00:41:32,034
I...ugh!

834
00:41:32,242 --> 00:41:34,870
I promise you I'm gonna break upwith edie and make this right.

835
00:41:34,953 --> 00:41:36,371
I'll call you when it's done.

836
00:41:36,413 --> 00:41:38,332
Don't bother!I won't pick up.

837
00:41:46,757 --> 00:41:51,845
we've all done something in our lives we're ashamed of.

838
00:41:52,054 --> 00:41:56,725
Some of us have fallen for the wrong man.

839
00:41:56,892 --> 00:42:01,563
Some have let go of the right woman.

840
00:42:01,688 --> 00:42:07,945
There are those who have humiliated their parents...

841
00:42:08,028 --> 00:42:12,866
and those who have failed their children.

842
00:42:13,075 --> 00:42:16,703
Yes, we've all made mistakes that diminish us

843
00:42:16,829 --> 00:42:19,665
and those we love.

844
00:42:19,748 --> 00:42:21,500
But there is redemption

845
00:42:21,667 --> 00:42:24,837
if we try to learn from those mistakes...
