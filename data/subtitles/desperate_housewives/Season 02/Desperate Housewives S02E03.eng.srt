00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:04,713
Previously on "desperate housewives,"

3
00:00:04,755 --> 00:00:05,881
as one affair ends...

4
00:00:05,923 --> 00:00:07,508
we don't have to sneak around anymore.

5
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:09,259
We can have a real relationship.

6
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:10,802
Another begins. Edie!

7
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,971
I had asked her if she'd like to live together,

8
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:13,722
and she said yes.

9
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:14,556
And yet another...

10
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:16,225
this is rex's mother phyllis.

11
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:17,267
Claims. This is joe flannery.

12
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:20,521
Are you aware that my daughter-in-law has a boyfriend?

13
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:21,688
Is exposed.

14
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,608
It's not going to break your heart to leave those sad,little faces behind?

15
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,694
And while some people can't wait to get out of the house,

16
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,321
others are being kept there,

17
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:31,907
against their will.

18
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:42,501
Now which one is rex's headstone?

19
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:44,127
I always forget.

20
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:46,088
It's right down this row.

21
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:48,382
Oh. Oh, yes.

22
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:49,967
That's right.

23
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:54,513
Over the years, bree van de kamp had grown increasingly concerned

24
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:57,266
over her mother-in-law's forgetfulness.

25
00:00:57,307 --> 00:01:01,353
Oh, honey, did I forget to take the pins out of that dress?

26
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:04,523
Her lapses had become more frequent...

27
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:08,735
sweetie, didn't I tell you I was going to paint that chair?

28
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:10,946
More glaring...

29
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:15,701
oh,dear. Didn't I mention I waxed the floor?

30
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,787
And more dangerous.

31
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:23,500
Yes, bree was worried about phyllis' faulty memory,

32
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:26,545
but she was more than happy to remind her,

33
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:30,007
especially when it came to the important things.

34
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:34,178
So have you given any thought to when you might be ending your visit?

35
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:38,557
- What?
- Have I become a burden?

36
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,058
Is that what you're saying?

37
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,687
I was simply asking when you were planning to leave.

38
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:46,523
There was no agenda behind the question.

39
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:50,736
Oh. I-I don't know.

40
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:55,240
Why don't we play it by ear?

41
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:57,951
Yes, let's.

42
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,456
What on earth?

43
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,124
Oh,my god.

44
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:06,126
What happened?

45
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,670
It looks like someone dug rex up.

46
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:11,131
Well, I got that, but why?

47
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:13,133
Why would they do that?

48
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,094
I don't know.

49
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,639
Unless...

50
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,599
unless what?

51
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:25,646
Maybe this has something to do with that insurance investigator.

52
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,397
Insurance investigator?

53
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,692
He came by asking all sorts of questions.

54
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,903
I don't know what you're talking about, phyllis.

55
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:34,655
Maybe you were at the store.

56
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:38,575
Anyway, he was very suspicious.

57
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:39,743
Suspicious?

58
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:44,665
Oh,yes. He has a theory that rex didn't die of a heart attack.

59
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,875
He thinks he was poisoned.

60
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:51,129
It was in that moment bree could finally see the truth.

61
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,549
Did I not mention that?

62
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,885
Her mother-in-law's memory was fine.

63
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,430
It was her soul that was faulty.

65
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:49,229
The parties took place on the front lawn of 4347 wisteria lane

66
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:52,357
every sunday afternoon.

67
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:55,611
Chloe pendergast would bring the tea set,

68
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,070
which was appropriate,

69
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,115
since she was the hostess.

70
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:05,746
Brittany chries provided formal attire from her mother's closet.

71
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:11,126
And marissa anne mckay invited the additional guests,

72
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:15,506
some of whom hadn't been to a party in years.

73
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:19,343
Of course, it never occurred to the three young girls

74
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:23,055
that while they were busy playing out their fantasy,

75
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:25,724
one of the older girls in the neighborhood

76
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:30,145
was engaging in a fantasy of her own.

77
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:04,179
- hey...
- oh, hi, mrs. Solis.

78
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,473
- Ralph.
- Off to the mall again?

79
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:07,891
You know me.

80
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:13,480
There was nothing gabrielle enjoyed as much as shopping.

81
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:19,278
And even when she couldn't afford to take anything home,

82
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:22,865
she took satisfaction in looking...

83
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:25,951
at the merchandise.

84
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:51,602
Hey, susan.

85
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:52,728
What's goin' on?

86
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:54,730
It's karl's weekend to have julie,

87
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:55,898
and they're always back by 6.

88
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:56,982
That's our custody agreement,

89
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:58,984
back by 6, and it's after 6.

90
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:00,152
It's like 6:15.

91
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:02,279
Well, see? There you go.

92
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:03,989
I'm sure they just forgot.

93
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,282
Well, I have a court order.

94
00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:07,034
It's out of my hands.

95
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:09,828
Yeah, it'd still be nice if you gave him a grace period.

96
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:11,205
Oh, I'm being nice.

97
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:12,706
I could have him arrested.

98
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:13,832
I mean, don't get me wrong.

99
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:16,043
I am all for julie spending time with karl.

100
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,544
He is still her dad,

101
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:18,795
and she loves him.

102
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:19,463
But...

103
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:21,173
but he's with edie.

104
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:23,884
I mean, she's not exactly the maternal type.

105
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:25,928
I wouldn't be a good mother if I wasn't concerned.

106
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:28,680
I mean, who knows what passes for a kid-friendly,

107
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:29,681
good time in there?

108
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:33,602
Drugs? Porn? Smoking?

109
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:40,317
doesn't sound like they're having an orgy in there.

110
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:52,913
obviously, they saw us coming.

111
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:59,169
whoo! That's a strike!

112
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:00,128
Hey, guys!

113
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:03,340
Hey! Look who's here!

114
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,384
Parker, guess what I got.

115
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,176
What?

116
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:07,386
School supplies.

117
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,679
School supplies?!

118
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:17,396
Yeah, and the best part of it is I got you a really cool backpack.

119
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,939
Whoa, look at that.

120
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:20,399
Pretty neat, huh?

121
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,067
Wow. Thanks.

122
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:23,694
So on your first day of school,

123
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:27,239
you and your dad can find your cubby and you can hang it up.

124
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,074
You're not taking me?

125
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,493
Actually, your dad's going to take you to school on your first day.

126
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:33,203
Yeah, just me and you, big guy.

127
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:34,746
I'll be right there to hold your hand.

128
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,498
But I thought mommy was taking me.

129
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,917
Yeah, well, honey, I have to work.

130
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:42,212
Mommy's boss is a mean, mean lady and if I miss work,

131
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:46,133
I'll lose my job and then we won't have any money to buy food.

132
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,636
Honey, you gotta believe me,

133
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:53,140
if I could be there, you know that I would.

134
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:05,944
all right, I didn't know it was that important to you.

135
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,822
I will talk to my boss and I will see what I can do.

136
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:10,991
Thank you, mommy.

137
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,870
Wow, I don't want to rain on your parade,

138
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:18,332
but he just totally manipulated you.

139
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:22,169
Well, hey, when a kid's that good,you gotta give him his due.

140
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:24,755
An autopsy?

141
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:27,174
Detective, rex died of a heart attack.

142
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:31,094
Well, there were some anomalies in the doctor's report.

143
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:32,804
Anomalies? What anomalies?

144
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:38,185
Ma'am, I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to discuss this any further with you.

145
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:40,562
Am I a suspect?

146
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:42,397
I didn't say that.

147
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,858
Well, if I am, you're wasting your time.

148
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,152
I loved rex and anyone who knows me will tell you

149
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:49,780
that I was incapable of hurting him.

150
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:52,908
You sure about that?

151
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,828
You talked to phyllis.

152
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:59,039
Again, I can't discuss the case.

153
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:00,582
She's my mother-in-law.

154
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:02,793
Of course she said horrible things about me.

155
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:03,335
Ma'am, lower your voice.

156
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:05,921
She blamed me for every problem that rex and I ever had.

157
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:07,464
So there were problems with the marriage?

158
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:10,133
Well, it was a marriage. Of course there were problems.

159
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:12,219
May I record this just so there's no confusion

160
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:13,303
over your statement?

161
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:15,264
No, you may not record this.

162
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:16,640
So you refuse to make a statement?

163
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:17,641
I'm not refusing anything.

164
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:19,810
All I'm saying is stay away from phyllis.

165
00:09:19,852 --> 00:09:21,895
She's a--she's a raving loon.

166
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:25,732
Ma'am, perhaps you'd be more comfortable with an attorney present.

167
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:30,737
You want a statement? Fine, I'll give you a statement.

168
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:34,658
My husband died of a heart attack.

169
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,368
I loved him very deeply,

170
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:39,496
and your mother did a lousy job.

171
00:09:55,888 --> 00:09:57,848
To bree's way of thinking,

172
00:09:57,848 --> 00:10:01,393
there were two kinds of people in the world--

173
00:10:01,894 --> 00:10:05,939
those who were useless before their morning coffee...

174
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:10,527
and those who weren't.

175
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,993
What's going on?

176
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:21,413
Don't rush me, bree!

177
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:25,584
I'm an old woman! Don't rush me.

178
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,712
Get her out of here.

179
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:29,838
I will tell you one thing--

180
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,924
you wouldn't be acting this way

181
00:10:31,924 --> 00:10:36,094
if you didn't feel guilty about something!

182
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:46,730
what's the occasion?

183
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:49,233
Uh, our anniversary?

184
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:50,817
Oh, right.

185
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:52,778
How could you forget our anniversary?

186
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:55,447
You sit in a cell all day long staring at a calendar.

187
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:57,115
What's the big deal?

188
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,450
Our marriage was a sham anyway.

189
00:10:58,492 --> 00:10:59,576
Oh,we're not doing this again.

190
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:01,954
In real marriages, wives are faithful.

191
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:04,289
Yeah, and husbands remember anniversaries,

192
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:05,791
so I guess we're even.

193
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,836
Are you equating forgetting our anniversary with cheating on me?

194
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:12,172
You are clearly determined to ruin this special day for us.

195
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,758
What is wrong with you that you don't feel guilty?

196
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,844
I feel tons of guilt, so back off.

197
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:18,554
You never even apologized.

198
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:20,556
I apologized a million times.

199
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:23,058
Yeah, but you always followed it up with an excuse.

200
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,435
"I was lonely, you weren't home enough,

201
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:26,812
a woman needs to be loved."

202
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:28,522
A woman does need to be loved,

203
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:29,565
and since you didn't give it to me,

204
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:32,359
I had to find it elsewhere.

205
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:36,864
So that's what the teenager was doing in our bedroom--

206
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:39,491
filling you with love.

207
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,326
Say what you want,

208
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,829
but john rowland loved me like no one ever has.

209
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:47,374
Not as a trophy or as a possession, but for me.

210
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,376
He loved me.

211
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:53,630
no, he really did.

212
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:56,466
Let me count the ways.

213
00:11:56,633 --> 00:12:01,096
Um, gently, savagely,

214
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:04,641
frequently, upside down...

215
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,269
is there a problem here?

216
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:10,772
No, it's our anniversary.

217
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:13,942
We're just reliving the good times.

218
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,537
That's an amazing car. Aston martin, right?

219
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:27,748
Uh-huh. Brand-new. Limited edition.

220
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:30,292
A little anniversary present from my husband.

221
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:32,169
He's very generous.

222
00:12:32,211 --> 00:12:34,421
More than he knows.

223
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:35,672
I'm sorry. What?

224
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:38,258
I'm singing at church for the family follies.

225
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,052
Edie's going to accompany me on guitar.

226
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,929
She's really good.

227
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,516
So you and edie are going to be an act.

228
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:46,975
Is that a problem?

229
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:54,900
No. No. I mean, I'm a little surprised that you didn't ask me to accompany you first.

230
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:56,693
On what?

231
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:58,320
You don't play an instrument.

232
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,280
I play the piano. You know that.

233
00:13:00,364 --> 00:13:02,824
How would I know that? I've never seen you play.

234
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:04,868
Well, I played in high school.

235
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,996
So the last time you tickled the ivories was sometime in the late '70s?

236
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:10,374
It was the early '80s.

237
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:13,377
Well, I'm not going to argue with you.

238
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:15,254
You want to do the show with edie,

239
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,673
and I think that's super.

240
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:21,635
So she's really good, huh?

241
00:13:21,677 --> 00:13:23,220
She knows her guitar.

242
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:25,889
Apparently, there are a lot of musicians in her family,

243
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:28,225
sort of like the von trapps.

244
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:31,478
Except, you know, her brother o'D.

245
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:35,941
All I'm asking you is to go out and play a little bit of ball.

246
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:37,150
Is that such a big deal?

247
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:39,319
Matthew, you are such an excellent player, darling,

248
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:41,947
that people will want to be your friend.

249
00:13:41,947 --> 00:13:43,240
Then next thing you know,

250
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,994
god knows who will be wanting to drop by and calling.

251
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:49,163
Sweetie, we need to keep a low profile.

252
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:49,705
Yeah, I know,

253
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:51,540
but I have got to get out of this house sometime.

254
00:13:51,582 --> 00:13:53,917
I'm going crazy here, okay?

255
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:31,288
What is it?

256
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:34,374
Oh, my daughter is singing a song at church

257
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:37,794
and I want to accompany her on the piano
and I haven't played in years.

258
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:40,672
Oh, you were just so amazing at rex's funeral the other day,

259
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:43,842
- I was wondering...
- I don't give lessons.

260
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:47,638
Oh. Oh, okay.

261
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:52,976
Oh. You have a little, uh, on your...

262
00:14:56,188 --> 00:14:59,900
I'm baking cherry pie. Excuse me.

263
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:10,786
What happened to maintaining a low profile?

264
00:15:10,953 --> 00:15:12,037
You keep being rude to everybody,

265
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,706
they're gonna start whispering about us.

266
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,625
You're right.

267
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:19,294
We do want to fit in.

268
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:28,470
Lynette, check it out.

269
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:33,225
Jason's mouth.

270
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:38,105
Stu,isn't that the new video conference setup?

271
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:41,441
Yeah. Isn't the resolution fantastic?

272
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:47,865
Hey, nina. Mm-hmm?

273
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:50,450
Uh, about tomorrow morning...

274
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:51,994
mm-hmm?

275
00:15:52,077 --> 00:15:55,956
You know how the first hour of the morning meeting is always so slow?

276
00:15:55,998 --> 00:15:57,374
'Cause I've got this thing...

277
00:15:57,416 --> 00:16:01,837
good god, this is not about your kids again, is it?

278
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:04,006
I know, I promised I wouldn't do this,

279
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:08,719
but parker really needs me to be there on his first day of kindergarden.

280
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,845
He's so freaked out I can't be there.

281
00:16:09,887 --> 00:16:13,390
I'm sorry. How is this my problem?

282
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:17,352
Because we can't escape the fact that I have kids.

283
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:19,479
I love my job, but to be fair,

284
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:20,981
there's gotta be some balance.

285
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:24,860
Okay, how about the people that don't have the kids?

286
00:16:24,902 --> 00:16:28,071
Did you ever consider that they might need a little more balance in their lives, hmm?

287
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:30,199
Like, maybe they want to go see a matinee

288
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,117
or perhaps they want to come in a little late

289
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,660
after a big crazy night out

290
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:35,829
or maybe they just want to get a hair cut,

291
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:38,707
which I, myself, have not been able to do for two months.

292
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:44,713
So, no, this is about fairness to the people who are childless by choice, okay?

293
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:47,216
Okay. Good point.

294
00:16:51,762 --> 00:16:54,556
And I'm sorry about your hair.

295
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:56,934
I can see why you're upset.

296
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:00,562
Open wide.

297
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:02,564
Not now, stu.

298
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,777
Hang on a sec.

299
00:17:07,653 --> 00:17:09,196
I don't understand.

300
00:17:09,238 --> 00:17:14,326
This system is gonna let mommy be with you on your first day of school.

301
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,873
The resolution is fantastic.

302
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:27,339
The next day,

303
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:30,634
gabrielle decided to cheer herself up

304
00:17:30,676 --> 00:17:34,012
with another round of window shopping.

305
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,977
But this time, she was taken a back

306
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:42,855
by what was on display.

307
00:18:55,511 --> 00:18:58,055
Mrs. Tilman. Mr. Delfino.

308
00:18:58,096 --> 00:19:00,265
I, uh, heard you were back from the hospital,

309
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:02,059
so I brought you these.

310
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,727
Oh, I can't tell you how long it's been

311
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:06,021
since I got flowers from a handsome man.

312
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:10,817
I mean, I could, but I don't want your pity.

313
00:19:13,946 --> 00:19:15,614
Where are you off to?

314
00:19:15,656 --> 00:19:17,741
I'm going back to utah for a few weeks.

315
00:19:17,783 --> 00:19:21,036
The recuperation'staking longer than the doctors anticipated.

316
00:19:21,078 --> 00:19:23,080
Speaking of my attack,

317
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:25,749
have they caught young zachary yet?

318
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:28,460
No, actually, that's why I'm here.

319
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:31,672
So the flowers were just a ruse.

320
00:19:31,713 --> 00:19:35,050
Figures. I'm trying to find zach before he gets in any more trouble.

321
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:36,927
Do you know any friends that he might have,

322
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:38,804
anywhere he might be holed up?

323
00:19:38,804 --> 00:19:40,639
I know you were close to him.

324
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:43,433
Funny thing, since he beat me and threw me down the stairs,

325
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:46,812
we just don't stay in touch like we should.

326
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:51,275
Since when do you care so much about zach young?

327
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:53,235
It's complicated.

328
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:55,529
I'll bet.

329
00:19:56,196 --> 00:20:00,284
I'm sure he's out there somewhere trying to find his father,

330
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:03,704
which I trust you made impossible.

331
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:06,206
No, I let paul go.

332
00:20:06,248 --> 00:20:08,959
I couldn't go through with it.

333
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:12,838
That was a mistake.

334
00:20:13,255 --> 00:20:15,632
He will spend the rest of his life running from the police.

335
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:18,302
I think that's punishment enough.

336
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:22,306
Zach is the only connection that paul has with his dead wife.

337
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:26,476
At some point, he will run back here looking for him.

338
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:30,522
I don't like to be negative,

339
00:20:31,023 --> 00:20:34,526
but you really should have killed him.

340
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:45,162
At the risk of ruining a lovely evening,

341
00:20:45,204 --> 00:20:48,290
I have some unpleasant news.

342
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:52,920
The police dug up your father today.

343
00:20:53,212 --> 00:20:55,047
- What? 
- Why?

344
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:58,300
Well, apparently, they want to do an autopsy.

345
00:20:58,342 --> 00:21:00,010
They don't think that he had a heart attack.

346
00:21:00,052 --> 00:21:02,095
They think that somebody was poisoning him.

347
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:04,014
Who would have poisoned daddy?

348
00:21:04,056 --> 00:21:07,226
Well, apparently, I'm a suspect.

349
00:21:10,062 --> 00:21:12,105
Well, they always look at spouses first.

350
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:14,900
It has something to do with statistics.

351
00:21:15,484 --> 00:21:19,655
It's just a formality. I'll be cleared in no time.

352
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:22,491
Would you two please stop looking at me like that?

353
00:21:22,533 --> 00:21:24,284
Obviously, I did not kill your father.

354
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:25,911
I loved him deeply.

355
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:27,955
Yeah, but you and dad had a lot of problems.

356
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:29,248
Everyone knows that.

357
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:32,084
Yes, we had issues, but I would never have hurt him.

358
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,670
What about the night daddy had his second heart attack?

359
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:37,798
You must have loved him a lot to make the bed before taking him to the hospital.

360
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,927
I was in shock, danielle. You know that.

361
00:21:43,387 --> 00:21:46,723
Andrew, surely you don't think I murdered your father.

362
00:21:46,765 --> 00:21:48,809
I know you didn't.

363
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:50,727
You're not capable of murder.

364
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:52,437
Thank you.

365
00:21:52,521 --> 00:21:55,023
That wasn't a compliment.

366
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:58,652
It takes guts to kill somebody.

367
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:04,658
Thank you so much for changing your mind about helping me.

368
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,451
I really appreciate it.

369
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:08,287
I'm happy to help...

370
00:22:08,704 --> 00:22:12,207
and I'm sorry if I seemed rude before.

371
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:14,960
I-I was having a bad day.

372
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:21,633
That's good.

373
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:23,051
That's really good.

374
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:26,221
You might want to lay off the pedal.

375
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:27,514
Really?

376
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:29,975
Oh, I thought it made it sound more professional.

377
00:22:30,017 --> 00:22:31,977
It doesn't.

378
00:22:36,815 --> 00:22:40,360
boy, your son really likes to play his hip-hop music loud.

379
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:45,741
The good news is it drowns out the sound of the dryer.

380
00:22:48,702 --> 00:22:51,455
arch your fingers, susan.

381
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,897
hi. I'm sorry to interrupt.

382
00:23:16,939 --> 00:23:19,525
I knocked, but I guess you guys didn't hear me.

383
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:20,400
No, we heard you.

384
00:23:20,442 --> 00:23:24,154
We were just hoping that who ever it was would go away.

385
00:23:24,196 --> 00:23:25,948
I'm still hoping that'll happen.

386
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:28,200
What's up, mom?

387
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,785
Well, I have good news.

388
00:23:29,827 --> 00:23:32,704
Um,I've been taking piano lessons with betty applewhite,

389
00:23:32,746 --> 00:23:36,166
and, uh, well, I just thought maybe I could join you guys.

390
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:38,836
You know, like a trio. Doesn't that sound fun?

391
00:23:38,877 --> 00:23:42,631
I don't do trios, but thanks anyway.

392
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:44,591
Well, I don't mean to be technical here,

393
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:46,051
but this show,

394
00:23:46,051 --> 00:23:48,470
I mean, it really is supposed to be a family thing,

395
00:23:48,512 --> 00:23:51,139
and I hate to point out you're not family.

396
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:53,183
No, but I have talent,

397
00:23:53,183 --> 00:23:56,687
and to most audiences, talent trumps family.

398
00:23:56,728 --> 00:24:00,274
Well, what makes you so sure I don't have talent?

399
00:24:00,649 --> 00:24:03,569
Hmm, just a hunch.

400
00:24:03,819 --> 00:24:06,280
Yeah, well, we've all seen your talent,

401
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:07,573
which is a nice way of telling you

402
00:24:07,573 --> 00:24:09,449
why don't you put some curtains on your bedroom window?

403
00:24:09,491 --> 00:24:11,160
- Guys...
- Oh, come on, be honest.

404
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,452
You didn't want any part of this

405
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:14,079
until you found out that I was involved.

406
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:16,707
That is so not true! Oh,yes, it is.

407
00:24:16,748 --> 00:24:19,877
It burns you that your own daughter picked me over you.

408
00:24:19,918 --> 00:24:21,420
She did not pick you.

409
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,547
It just didn't occur to her that I would agree to do it.

410
00:24:23,589 --> 00:24:24,715
Well, now she knows,

411
00:24:24,756 --> 00:24:26,675
and if she had it to do over again,she'd pick me.

412
00:24:26,717 --> 00:24:28,010
No, she wouldn't.

413
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:29,803
Well, why don't we put it to a test?

414
00:24:29,845 --> 00:24:31,889
Julie, who would you rather have play with you?

415
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:34,600
- Oh, no, no, no, no. 
- No, it's okay, honey.

416
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:36,185
Who do you want to be with you

417
00:24:36,185 --> 00:24:38,312
in the family talent show?

418
00:24:38,353 --> 00:24:40,397
Yes,who do you want with you

419
00:24:40,439 --> 00:24:43,066
in front of all of those people?

420
00:24:43,108 --> 00:24:44,359
And remember, it's a church.

421
00:24:44,401 --> 00:24:47,446
They are goin to be judging you.

422
00:24:49,615 --> 00:24:51,909
Ohh... okay.

423
00:24:51,992 --> 00:24:54,495
Well, first of all, you both suck,

424
00:24:54,536 --> 00:24:57,789
but if I had to choose...

425
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:02,794
I guess I'd pick my mom.

426
00:25:02,836 --> 00:25:04,546
Sorry, edie.

427
00:25:04,588 --> 00:25:06,757
Fair enough.

428
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:10,385
I'd like my pitch pipe back, please.

429
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:18,101
it was you, wasn't it?

430
00:25:18,143 --> 00:25:18,977
Hello, john.

431
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:20,479
Long time, no see.

432
00:25:20,521 --> 00:25:23,899
One of the neighbors saw an aston martin driving away,

433
00:25:23,941 --> 00:25:25,400
and what do you know?

434
00:25:25,442 --> 00:25:27,319
Well, someone had to tend to the yard.

435
00:25:27,402 --> 00:25:29,780
You were busy elsewhere.

436
00:25:30,405 --> 00:25:31,198
You saw us?

437
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,409
Yes, and I have to say she's old enough to be your mother.

438
00:25:34,451 --> 00:25:35,786
Hell, she's old enough to be my mother.

439
00:25:35,828 --> 00:25:37,037
Joan's only 41.

440
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,038
Joan?!

441
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,498
You're calling her joan?!

442
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,958
Why shouldn't I? She's my friend.

443
00:25:40,999 --> 00:25:42,042
I know your friends,

444
00:25:42,084 --> 00:25:43,502
and I have a hunch you don't do to your friends

445
00:25:43,544 --> 00:25:46,296
what I saw you doing to that wrinkly old lady.

446
00:25:46,338 --> 00:25:49,341
Okay, so you caught me doing it with somebody else.

447
00:25:49,383 --> 00:25:50,133
What's the big deal?

448
00:25:50,175 --> 00:25:52,469
You're supposed to be in love with me.

449
00:25:52,553 --> 00:25:53,178
What?

450
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,388
How many times did you say it?

451
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:55,848
How many times did you whisper in my ear,

452
00:25:55,889 --> 00:25:57,266
"you're the only woman I'll ever love"?

453
00:25:57,307 --> 00:25:59,142
I don't know. A bunch.

454
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:00,227
So were you lying to me?

455
00:26:00,269 --> 00:26:01,478
Were you just trying to get me into bed?

456
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,313
No, of course not.

457
00:26:03,355 --> 00:26:05,148
I loved you, but we broke up.

458
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,859
Yeah, like five minutes ago!

459
00:26:06,859 --> 00:26:08,986
Haven't you ever heard of a mourning period?

460
00:26:09,027 --> 00:26:13,282
I know it seems quick, but I have feelings for her.

461
00:26:13,365 --> 00:26:16,368
In fact, I think I may be in love with her.

462
00:26:20,122 --> 00:26:21,290
Oh, my god.

463
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:23,500
What's the matter? Is it the baby?

464
00:26:23,542 --> 00:26:25,169
No.

465
00:26:26,503 --> 00:26:29,590
Oh, no, no. It's me.

466
00:26:29,923 --> 00:26:32,968
I am beyond stupid.

467
00:26:34,428 --> 00:26:35,554
You're not stupid.

468
00:26:35,596 --> 00:26:37,347
Oh, no, I am.

469
00:26:37,556 --> 00:26:41,518
Yesterday, I was still fantasizing that it could work with you,

470
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,854
that a one-bedroom apartment might be cozy.

471
00:26:43,896 --> 00:26:44,897
Mrs. Solis, please.

472
00:26:44,938 --> 00:26:50,694
Oh, my god. I almost left my husband for someone who calls me mrs. Solis.

473
00:26:57,326 --> 00:27:00,662
So are you upset because you want to get back together?

474
00:27:00,704 --> 00:27:03,707
Because I can break up with joan.

475
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:07,794
That's okay, sweetie. I'm good.

476
00:27:17,012 --> 00:27:19,806
So this is it for us?

477
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:22,726
'Cause I really feel like we should end it better than this.

478
00:27:22,768 --> 00:27:26,104
Actually, john, given how stupid both of us have been,

479
00:27:26,855 --> 00:27:30,234
this is an entirely appropriate ending.

480
00:27:44,706 --> 00:27:45,958
mrs. Van de kamp.

481
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:47,042
What can I do for you?

482
00:27:47,084 --> 00:27:49,711
I would like to submit myself to a lie detector test

483
00:27:49,753 --> 00:27:51,421
to eliminate any uncertainty

484
00:27:51,463 --> 00:27:53,507
about what happened with my husband.

485
00:27:53,507 --> 00:27:55,467
Are you sure you don't want a lawyer present?

486
00:27:55,509 --> 00:27:56,635
I'll waive all that.

487
00:27:56,677 --> 00:27:59,096
My only stipulation is that I want my children

488
00:27:59,137 --> 00:28:02,182
to be able to see me answer the questions.

489
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:05,477
I think we can accommodate you.

490
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:07,688
Is your name bree van de kamp?

491
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:09,314
Yes.

492
00:28:09,356 --> 00:28:12,109
Were you married to rex van de kamp?

493
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:13,652
yes.

494
00:28:13,819 --> 00:28:17,156
Did you and your husbandt emporarily separate last year?

495
00:28:17,197 --> 00:28:18,657
Yes.

496
00:28:18,699 --> 00:28:20,284
Did you kill your husband?

497
00:28:20,325 --> 00:28:22,244
No.

498
00:28:26,081 --> 00:28:30,627
Do you know a man named george williams?

499
00:28:30,878 --> 00:28:32,296
Yes.

500
00:28:32,337 --> 00:28:35,090
During your separation from your husband,

501
00:28:35,132 --> 00:28:37,384
did you have a relationship with mr. Williams?

502
00:28:37,426 --> 00:28:40,053
What does that have to do with anything?

503
00:28:40,137 --> 00:28:42,389
Just yes or no responses, please.

504
00:28:42,431 --> 00:28:46,560
Well, I'm not gonna respond to something that's none of your business.

505
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:48,812
Mrs. Van de kamp,

506
00:28:48,812 --> 00:28:51,190
if you want us to take this polygraph seriously,

507
00:28:51,231 --> 00:28:54,693
answer the questions we ask,okay?

508
00:28:57,821 --> 00:28:59,573
Who's george williams?

509
00:28:59,615 --> 00:29:02,159
He's our pharmacist.

510
00:29:02,201 --> 00:29:04,411
During your separation, did you have a relationship

511
00:29:04,453 --> 00:29:06,622
with mr. Williams?

512
00:29:06,663 --> 00:29:08,499
Yes.

513
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:11,835
Are you in love with mr. Williams?

514
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:12,836
What?

515
00:29:12,878 --> 00:29:16,423
Are you in love with mr. Williams?

516
00:29:16,507 --> 00:29:18,592
No.

517
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:25,849
Um,I-I was thinking of something else just then,

518
00:29:25,891 --> 00:29:29,353
so why don't you ask me the question again?

519
00:29:29,978 --> 00:29:32,272
Are you in love with mr. Williams?

520
00:29:32,314 --> 00:29:34,358
No.

521
00:29:39,363 --> 00:29:41,365
Did you see that?

522
00:29:42,115 --> 00:29:45,077
Yeah,I saw it.

523
00:29:57,714 --> 00:29:59,424
Hello, susan.

524
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:01,051
Are you ready for your lesson?

525
00:30:01,093 --> 00:30:02,636
Yep, I am.

526
00:30:02,636 --> 00:30:04,888
I think I'm going to make another push for using that pedal.

527
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:07,349
I think it adds grandeur.

528
00:30:09,643 --> 00:30:11,228
I want to talk to you!

529
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,437
I'm busy now.

530
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:13,564
I cannot believe

531
00:30:13,605 --> 00:30:16,108
you kicked edie out of julie's performance!

532
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:18,068
I did not kick edie out.

533
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,194
Julie made that call.

534
00:30:19,194 --> 00:30:21,071
Because you played the mom card.

535
00:30:21,113 --> 00:30:24,533
Well, it is a family recital, and edie is not family.

536
00:30:24,575 --> 00:30:25,576
One day, she could be.

537
00:30:25,617 --> 00:30:27,327
Ohh, don't even joke like that.

538
00:30:27,369 --> 00:30:30,831
H-how about your plumber/convicted murderer, huh?

539
00:30:30,873 --> 00:30:33,584
He seems to keep popping up at "family" events.

540
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:35,669
It was not murder, it was manslaughter,

541
00:30:35,711 --> 00:30:36,753
and that's totally different.

542
00:30:36,753 --> 00:30:38,046
Mike and I aren't even living together,

543
00:30:38,046 --> 00:30:39,256
and he cares about julie.

544
00:30:39,298 --> 00:30:40,549
Well, so does edie, huh?

545
00:30:40,591 --> 00:30:42,926
She was really looking forward to performing with julie.

546
00:30:42,968 --> 00:30:46,555
If you think edie britt cares about anybody other than herself,

547
00:30:46,555 --> 00:30:48,515
you are living in a fool's paradise.

548
00:30:48,557 --> 00:30:50,058
You don't know her the way I do,

549
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,102
and the only reason she's interested in julie

550
00:30:52,144 --> 00:30:55,022
is to mess with my head.

551
00:30:55,814 --> 00:30:58,734
hey, that's both crazy and self-absorbed.

552
00:30:58,734 --> 00:31:01,778
That's a twofer! Way to go!

553
00:31:03,489 --> 00:31:05,657
Whether you choose to believe it or not,

554
00:31:05,699 --> 00:31:06,909
they're both great together,

555
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:10,412
and if you don't believe me, ask julie.

556
00:31:20,672 --> 00:31:23,425
I'm sorry you had to witness that.

557
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:26,762
Oh, that's okay, hon.

558
00:31:27,387 --> 00:31:30,724
I have lived my share of family knock-down drag-outs.

559
00:31:30,766 --> 00:31:34,061
Well, I hope it wasn't as ugly as me and karl.

560
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,188
You'd be surprised.

561
00:31:36,355 --> 00:31:39,525
Parker, honey,can you hear me?

562
00:31:39,608 --> 00:31:41,318
Tom, why isn't he talking?

563
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,861
Um, honey, there are a lot of kids here.

564
00:31:42,903 --> 00:31:44,029
He's a little stressed.

565
00:31:44,071 --> 00:31:46,240
Parker, say hi, say hi. Mommy?

566
00:31:46,281 --> 00:31:50,494
Oh, hey, honey, this is so exciting.

567
00:31:50,536 --> 00:31:52,162
Your first day of school.

568
00:31:52,204 --> 00:31:54,581
You're going to make so many friends.

569
00:31:54,623 --> 00:31:57,209
Lynette, staff meeting, now.

570
00:31:57,251 --> 00:31:59,920
Uh, right, yeah. I'm going to be right there.

571
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,006
Now. Now, now, now!

572
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:06,301
Stu, this coffee, it's cold.

573
00:32:06,885 --> 00:32:09,388
Honey, I'm going to be right back.

574
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:11,265
Mommy? Where are you going?

575
00:32:11,265 --> 00:32:12,850
Right back.

576
00:32:12,933 --> 00:32:15,143
Mommy, come back!

577
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:19,064
Okay, let's turn to page five.

578
00:32:19,398 --> 00:32:22,609
Damn. I forgot my prospectus. Any extra copies?

579
00:32:22,651 --> 00:32:24,862
No? Oh, I'll be right back.

580
00:32:27,072 --> 00:32:29,491
Hi, I'm back. How's he doing?

581
00:32:29,533 --> 00:32:31,118
Um, um, honey, he's upset

582
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,412
because he wanted to show you his cubby. You left.

583
00:32:33,453 --> 00:32:35,205
Oh, honey, I'm here. I'm here.

584
00:32:35,247 --> 00:32:36,790
You can show me your cubby now.

585
00:32:36,832 --> 00:32:39,918
Nina found extra copies. She wants you back now.

586
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,589
Okay. I'll be back in two seconds for you.

587
00:32:43,672 --> 00:32:46,341
Mommy! Mommy! Don't go!

588
00:32:46,466 --> 00:32:49,803
So the big issue here is second-quarter billing.

589
00:32:49,845 --> 00:32:52,014
Where are you going? Ladies' room.

590
00:32:52,014 --> 00:32:53,974
No. Nina, nature is calling.

591
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:56,059
Lynette, hold it for ten minutes.

592
00:32:56,101 --> 00:32:58,770
We have to get through this.

593
00:33:07,446 --> 00:33:10,449
What I'd like to do is trade out the invoicing structure.

594
00:33:10,449 --> 00:33:14,244
Let's take a look at our graphs on page ten, please.

595
00:33:14,244 --> 00:33:17,414
Lynette had been struggling to balance her career

596
00:33:17,414 --> 00:33:19,374
and her family.

597
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:22,711
She finally saw an opportunity

598
00:33:22,753 --> 00:33:25,547
to tip the scales in her favor.

599
00:33:25,589 --> 00:33:26,715
Instead of badgering clients with invoices

600
00:33:26,757 --> 00:33:30,260
on the shorter term campaigns, I say we bill on delivery.

601
00:33:30,302 --> 00:33:31,720
Yes!

602
00:33:31,762 --> 00:33:34,515
Bill on delivery, yes!

603
00:33:34,765 --> 00:33:36,725
are you having a seizure?

604
00:33:36,767 --> 00:33:39,937
No, no, I'm just--I'm very excited.

605
00:33:39,978 --> 00:33:42,731
It's a really good plan.

606
00:33:42,981 --> 00:33:45,192
Yeah, mmm.

607
00:33:45,275 --> 00:33:47,569
Now, what happened on the burman account

608
00:33:47,569 --> 00:33:49,404
is that they were sent duplicate bills

609
00:33:49,404 --> 00:33:51,990
by tina and ron in accounting

610
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,116
and I'm not pointing any fingers,

611
00:33:53,158 --> 00:33:55,202
but tina, ron,

612
00:33:55,244 --> 00:33:57,663
about walking in and seeing all my lines lit up

613
00:33:57,704 --> 00:34:00,874
with disgrunt led--aah! Ohh! Hot! Hot!

614
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,544
Help.

615
00:34:03,627 --> 00:34:06,129
Stu! Aah! Aah!

616
00:34:06,171 --> 00:34:08,006
And that's why we packed you extra cookies

617
00:34:08,048 --> 00:34:10,717
so you could share with all your new friends, remember?

618
00:34:10,759 --> 00:34:11,552
Uh-huh.

619
00:34:11,593 --> 00:34:13,846
I think we're good to go now, honey.

620
00:34:14,221 --> 00:34:16,056
You're going to be great, parker.

621
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:17,599
I love you.

622
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,643
I love you, too, mommy.

623
00:34:34,867 --> 00:34:36,910
Bree, hi. What can I do for you?

624
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:39,037
Well, for starters ,you can help me prove to the police

625
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:42,457
that we didn't conspire to kill my husband.

626
00:34:43,125 --> 00:34:44,293
Okay.

627
00:34:44,376 --> 00:34:46,503
So because of the anomalies in rex's blood,

628
00:34:46,503 --> 00:34:49,089
the police started to wonder if I'd been poisoning rex.

629
00:34:49,131 --> 00:34:50,007
That's absurd.

630
00:34:50,048 --> 00:34:51,967
Lots of things can cause high potassium levels--

631
00:34:51,967 --> 00:34:53,468
renal failure, low sodium.

632
00:34:53,552 --> 00:34:54,803
Well, that's why I took the polygraph,

633
00:34:54,845 --> 00:34:56,805
to prove to them that I was innocent.

634
00:34:56,847 --> 00:34:59,349
Obviously, you passed.

635
00:35:00,225 --> 00:35:02,311
Sort of.

636
00:35:02,352 --> 00:35:04,313
Well, I think the police now have a different theory,

637
00:35:04,354 --> 00:35:07,357
which is if I wasn't poisoning rex on my own,

638
00:35:07,399 --> 00:35:12,070
then maybe you were helping me.

639
00:35:12,488 --> 00:35:13,322
You're kidding.

640
00:35:13,322 --> 00:35:17,034
No, that's why I need you to take the polygraph, too.

641
00:35:18,202 --> 00:35:19,161
W-what?

642
00:35:19,203 --> 00:35:20,829
It's the quickest way to prove to the police

643
00:35:20,913 --> 00:35:22,080
that they're wrong.

644
00:35:22,122 --> 00:35:24,791
I-I don't understand. We're just friends.

645
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:26,043
Why would the police assume

646
00:35:26,084 --> 00:35:28,462
that people in a platonic relationship

647
00:35:28,545 --> 00:35:31,423
would want to murder someone?

648
00:35:35,594 --> 00:35:38,639
um, during the test, they asked me some questions

649
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,308
about you and, um, us

650
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:42,434
and whether we had a relationship

651
00:35:42,476 --> 00:35:45,646
and I said yes,because it's true.

652
00:35:45,687 --> 00:35:47,898
And then they asked me something else,

653
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,901
something I hadn't considered.

654
00:35:51,193 --> 00:35:52,986
Which was?

655
00:35:53,028 --> 00:35:56,365
They asked me if I loved you.

656
00:35:57,866 --> 00:36:00,494
What did you say?

657
00:36:00,786 --> 00:36:03,664
I said no.

658
00:36:04,331 --> 00:36:05,374
Oh.

659
00:36:05,415 --> 00:36:07,251
But according to the polygraph,

660
00:36:07,292 --> 00:36:10,379
that wasn't exactly true.

661
00:36:13,048 --> 00:36:16,134
Well, I don't--I don't know if that means anything.

662
00:36:16,176 --> 00:36:19,638
Polygraphs aren't completely reliable.

663
00:36:19,721 --> 00:36:23,600
I think perhaps the machine picked up on something,

664
00:36:23,642 --> 00:36:28,313
something that I wasn't aware of.

665
00:36:30,232 --> 00:36:31,191
Wow.

666
00:36:31,233 --> 00:36:32,776
What's why I need you to take the test

667
00:36:32,818 --> 00:36:34,486
and answer the detective's questions,

668
00:36:34,528 --> 00:36:36,780
because I'm not going to know exactly how I feel

669
00:36:36,822 --> 00:36:39,324
until we put this behind us, but then, once we do...

670
00:36:39,366 --> 00:36:41,785
we can move on.

671
00:36:48,083 --> 00:36:51,170
can those chicorelli sisters dance or what?

672
00:36:51,211 --> 00:36:53,172
Wow, look out, broadway!

673
00:36:53,213 --> 00:36:56,091
Now don't forget that we will have cookies and juice

674
00:36:56,091 --> 00:36:57,968
set up in the basement after we're done here.

675
00:36:57,968 --> 00:37:01,180
We want to see you all there. And for our next act,

676
00:37:01,221 --> 00:37:03,348
please welcome the musical stylings

677
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:06,602
of julie and susan mayer.

678
00:37:34,379 --> 00:37:36,048
I'll be right back.

679
00:37:36,089 --> 00:37:39,426
Oh, um, I'm just gonna need a couple of seconds,

680
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:42,679
so feel free to pray.

681
00:37:45,224 --> 00:37:48,101
Edie, the other day when I saw you making music with my family,

682
00:37:48,143 --> 00:37:50,187
I got a little jealous and I went a little crazy

683
00:37:50,229 --> 00:37:53,315
and I pushed you out.

684
00:37:53,357 --> 00:37:56,193
Seeing you sitting here today,

685
00:37:56,235 --> 00:37:59,696
well, I can see how much you care about julie,

686
00:38:00,155 --> 00:38:02,991
and she comes first,

687
00:38:03,075 --> 00:38:06,578
and it should be you up there playing with her, not me.

688
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:09,206
So I'm sorry.

689
00:38:09,248 --> 00:38:11,542
Thank you, susan.

690
00:38:17,923 --> 00:38:20,092
How convenient that you decided this

691
00:38:20,133 --> 00:38:23,428
after I showed up without my guitar.

692
00:38:24,638 --> 00:38:27,307
Well, like I said, I'm sorry.

693
00:38:27,349 --> 00:38:29,309
I wish it could be you up there.

694
00:38:29,393 --> 00:38:32,104
You know, I play piano.

695
00:38:34,147 --> 00:38:36,191
And so let's all welcome julie mayer

696
00:38:36,233 --> 00:38:38,819
and her aunt edie.

697
00:38:44,241 --> 00:38:46,702
You did a good thing.

698
00:39:13,604 --> 00:39:14,813
Yeah, well, I try.

699
00:39:14,897 --> 00:39:17,774
This thing has, like, 90 flats in it.

700
00:39:19,026 --> 00:39:20,694
poor julie.

701
00:39:20,736 --> 00:39:23,739
Stop it. You're loving this.

702
00:39:23,906 --> 00:39:26,825
No, not at all

703
00:39:49,473 --> 00:39:53,143
so they said you needed to see me.

704
00:39:53,185 --> 00:39:55,979
What is it? What's goin' on?

705
00:39:59,691 --> 00:40:02,903
Um, I've been thinking...

706
00:40:02,903 --> 00:40:05,697
you know, about, um...

707
00:40:06,573 --> 00:40:08,909
everything that happened with john...

708
00:40:08,951 --> 00:40:10,994
and...

709
00:40:12,246 --> 00:40:14,331
and, um...

710
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:21,505
I was really selfish and stupid.

711
00:40:24,842 --> 00:40:27,177
And I'm sorry.

712
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:32,182
I really am sorry.

713
00:40:43,986 --> 00:40:47,948
That's all I had to say, really.

714
00:40:50,033 --> 00:40:52,536
You know what?

715
00:40:52,661 --> 00:40:56,248
That is the best anniversary gift

716
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:59,126
that you've ever given me.

717
00:40:59,376 --> 00:41:00,627
Really?

718
00:41:00,794 --> 00:41:02,880
Yeah.

719
00:41:05,215 --> 00:41:09,511
Actually, the one you gave me is really nice, too.

720
00:41:14,224 --> 00:41:17,811
Everyone enjoys a game of make-believe now and then.

721
00:41:17,853 --> 00:41:22,399
Of course, the ways in which we play can vary greatly.

722
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:26,737
Sometimes we tell ourselves work won't interfere

723
00:41:26,778 --> 00:41:28,489
with our family life.

724
00:41:28,572 --> 00:41:29,907
lynette, staff meeting, now.

725
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:31,492
Yeah.

726
00:41:33,535 --> 00:41:36,497
Sometimes, we imagine certain relationships

727
00:41:36,538 --> 00:41:40,834
to be more meaningful than they really are.

728
00:41:44,838 --> 00:41:47,591
Occasionally, we put on a show,

729
00:41:47,633 --> 00:41:50,552
as if to convince ourselves our secrets

730
00:41:50,594 --> 00:41:53,764
aren't really all that terrible.

731
00:41:54,681 --> 00:41:59,061
Yes,the game of make-believe is a simple one.

732
00:41:59,102 --> 00:42:01,605
Did you know rex van de kamp?

733
00:42:01,647 --> 00:42:03,315
Yes.

734
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,194
Did mrs. Van de kamp ask you to poison her husband?

735
00:42:07,236 --> 00:42:09,238
No.

736
00:42:09,863 --> 00:42:12,032
Did you poison rex van de kamp?

737
00:42:12,074 --> 00:42:14,910
You start by lying to yourself...

738
00:42:14,952 --> 00:42:16,954
no.

739
00:42:19,915 --> 00:42:24,628
And if you can get others to believe those lies...

740
00:42:24,711 --> 00:42:26,338
you win.
