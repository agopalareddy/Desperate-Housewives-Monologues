00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,046
Previously on "desperate housewives"...

3
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,006
the police dug upyour father today.

4
00:00:06,048 --> 00:00:08,425
They think that somebodywas poisoning him.

5
00:00:08,467 --> 00:00:09,760
Apparently,I'm a suspect.

6
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:11,803
Bree felt threatened by the past.

7
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:13,805
- Get the damn lawyer.
- Are you hitting on me?

8
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,391
Gabrielle was threatened by seduction.

9
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,227
Do you mean julie?

10
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:20,062
If I come back with you,then I can make it up to her.

11
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:22,147
You should find your fatherfirst. Let me help.

12
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:24,399
And while some threats...

13
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,030
Were kept under control...

14
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:31,823
let's get this over with.

15
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:35,869
Some were left free to return.

16
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,749
Since her first day on the job,

17
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:44,211
it had been clear to lynette scavo

18
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:48,632
that her new boss nina was unusually tense.

19
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:50,884
To help relieve her tension,

20
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:53,887
lynette tried giving her boss thoughtful gifts--

21
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:56,515
a soothing wave machine...

22
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:01,603
aromatherapy candles...

23
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:07,818
even meditative chi balls.

24
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,029
But nothing seemed to ease nina's tension.

25
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:14,575
"Distilledthe old-fashioned way."

26
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:17,035
You know,it actually hurts my teeth

27
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,037
to say that out loud.

28
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:22,666
You folks are going to toddleback to your little holes

29
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:25,586
and you are gonna come upwith a decent slogan

30
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:29,131
or I will can all your assesthe old-fashioned way.

31
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:34,887
Until one day when it occurred to lynette

32
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,598
there was one form of relaxation

33
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:41,101
she had yet to try.

34
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:44,021
It's a gimlet.You'll love it.

35
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:46,273
What exactlyis your plan here,

36
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:49,276
to get me all liquored upso I buy the revised pitch?

37
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:51,320
Don't be ridiculous.

38
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:54,615
Could we get a trough of these,please?

39
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:57,618
I can't remember the last timeI was in a bar.

40
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,037
Must have been the last timeI had a boyfriend,

41
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,538
which was...

42
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,790
oh,god,I'm a nun.

43
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:07,002
So why don't you go outand get in the game?

44
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:08,504
Believe it or not,

45
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:13,175
when it comes to meeting men,I am... shy.

46
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:15,219
Well,I'm not.

47
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:17,554
So,uh...

48
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,265
what about that guyover there?

49
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,643
He's been checking you outsince we walked in.

50
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,770
He's cute.

51
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,271
So go over there.

52
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:28,190
no.

53
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:30,651
Oh,for god's sakes.

54
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,986
Where are you going?Lynette,sit--

55
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:38,283
hey,stretch,

56
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,452
see my friend over there?

57
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,496
She thinks you're cute.

58
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:48,210
Why don't youbuy her a drink?

59
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:53,841
Hey,everybody. Hi.

60
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,134
Oh,it's a beautiful morning,isn't it?

61
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,636
Thank you,sweetie.

62
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:00,806
Oh,hey,lynette,I readthe new vodka proposal.

63
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:03,642
Oh,you guys hit itout of the park.

64
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,144
I love that color.

65
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,188
Thanks. Hey,nina.

66
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,731
Yeah?

67
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:12,693
And although it had come about in an unexpected manner...

68
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:16,029
aren't those the same clothes
you were wearing last nightin the bar?

69
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,531
Yep.

70
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:20,576
Nina's tension had finally been released...

71
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:25,163
the old-fashioned way.

Proudly Presents

73
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:10,584
Everyone in this world

74
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:12,586
needs someone they can depend upon,

75
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:15,923
be it a faithful companion,

76
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:19,718
trusted confidant...

77
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,347
or loyal friend.

78
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:26,475
For susan mayer,that dependable someone

79
00:04:26,517 --> 00:04:31,146
was her book agent lonny moon.

80
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:32,648
It was lonny

81
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,609
who helped susan promote her first children's book.

82
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:38,612
It was lonny who rushed susan to the hospital

83
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:41,031
the night julie was born.

84
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:43,617
It was lonny who took susan's mind

85
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:45,536
off her painful divorce

86
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,746
with a fun vacation.

87
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:52,459
Yes,lonny was susan's rock.

88
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:54,711
Sadly for susan,

89
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:57,631
her rock was about to crumble.

90
00:04:57,673 --> 00:04:59,633
for those of you just joining us,

91
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:02,344
we have a new development in the melanie foster case...

92
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:05,180
lonny,what are you doing here?
It's past noon.

93
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:08,559
Which means it's nowsocially acceptable

94
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,101
to begin drinking.

95
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,186
I can't believe I let youtalk me into this.

96
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:12,855
I am so behind in my work.

97
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:15,023
But I'm glad I came.This is fun.

98
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:17,067
I've gotta be honest.

99
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:19,361
I had an ulterior motive.

100
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:23,448
I've decided to startmy own agency.

101
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,950
You're leaving muir and hunt?

102
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:26,702
You helped build that place.

103
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,705
I know,but I just feelit's time.

104
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:33,542
And now the question is,will you come with me?

105
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:35,794
Well... of course.

106
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:37,796
Okay!

107
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,716
To the future.

108
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,217
I'll just call the agency,

109
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,344
and I'll let them knowI'm going with you.

110
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,389
Oh,I don't thinkthat's necessary.

111
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:49,099
Really?

112
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:53,187
Yeah,I thinkit might be rude not to.

113
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:54,938
Lonny...

114
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,191
what's going on?

115
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:59,484
Okay.

116
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:02,738
There's been some bad bloodbetween me and the partners.

117
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,531
Why?

118
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,533
I got into this thingwhere I had to move

119
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,535
a little client moneyaround temporarily

120
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:10,329
to cover some expenses.

121
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,457
You had to "move money"?What does that mean?

122
00:06:13,499 --> 00:06:16,960
I took a little from here,and I moved it there.

123
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:19,296
It was no big deal.

124
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:20,797
Really?

125
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,799
'Cause it sort of soundslike embezzlement.

126
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:25,511
Why do peoplekeep using that word?!

127
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:27,804
Who else is usingthat word?

128
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:28,972
Nobody.

129
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:32,142
The partnersand their forensic accountant.

130
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:34,144
Oh,my god.

131
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:37,022
Lonny,did you "move"some of my money?

132
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:39,691
Absolutely not.I swear!

133
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,402
Susan,don't look at methat way.

134
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:44,363
I know what I didwas wrong,

135
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,865
and I feel likea complete idiot for doing it,

136
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,284
but please,please don't hate me.

137
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,537
Well,I don't hate you.

138
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:54,373
I couldn't hate you.You're my lonny.

139
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:58,335
So...

140
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:01,421
will you stillcome with me?

141
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,302
You know what?

142
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:09,304
This is one of those times

143
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:11,807
when you find outwho your real friends are,

144
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:13,892
so,yeah.

145
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,853
Oh,thank you!Thank you!

146
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:21,233
You are one special lady,susan mayer.

147
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,278
Is that the baby's head?

148
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,071
No,that's his foot.

149
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:30,075
That looks likea head to me.

150
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:32,244
Well,that settles it.

151
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:33,704
When this baby's born,

152
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:35,914
I'll be in chargeof putting on the socks.

153
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:39,418
You're glowing today,you know that?

154
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:41,420
Pregnancy agrees with you.Yeah?

155
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,381
Well,if you don't mindthe hemorrhoids and the nausea,

156
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:45,757
it's quite the party.

157
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,969
I wonder where david is.He should've been here by now.

158
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:51,096
So this new lawyer's good?

159
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:53,098
He's quite the shark.You're gonna love him.

160
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,017
He hasn't lost a casein six years.

161
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,519
He argued in front ofthe state supreme court,

162
00:07:57,561 --> 00:08:00,731
and he made our conjugal visithappen pretty damn fast.

163
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,983
Well,hey,I'm a fan already.

164
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:05,277
Sorry I'm late.

165
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,695
Oh,david.

166
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:09,281
Good to see you,gaby.Carlos,I'm david.

167
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:27,424
I don't think so.

168
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:30,010
What the hellare you doing?

169
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:32,513
That guy's not gonna bemy lawyer.

170
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:34,348
Find a new one.

171
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,894
You haven't fileda single charge.

172
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:41,730
Either determine a homicideor release the body.

173
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:43,690
We've got a court orderwhich says,

174
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:45,734
until we're done with it,the corpse is ours.

175
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:47,653
He is not a corpse.

176
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,571
He is a mannamed rex van de kamp.

177
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:53,200
He was a loving husband,a devoted father
and a successful doctor.

178
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:56,245
So successful,in fact,that he left me enough money

179
00:08:56,245 --> 00:08:58,831
to sue the city,this precinct

180
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,457
and you two gentlemenpersonally

181
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:02,584
just for the fun of it.

182
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:05,045
Mrs. Van de kamp,we don'trespond well to threats,

183
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:07,714
so if I--release the body.

184
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:09,758
What?

185
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,718
The evidence we haveis minimal at best.

186
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,428
Mrs. Van de kampwas gracious enough

187
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,097
to come down hereand take that lie detector test.

188
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:17,057
I think it's the leastwe can do for her.

189
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:18,767
Thank you.

190
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,020
So,uh,what will happen now?

191
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,648
Obviously,we'll putmr. Van de kamp back

192
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:25,941
just like we found him.

193
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:27,985
Yes,and I'm sureyou will bury him

194
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:29,987
with all the dignityof a dead hamster.

195
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:32,030
No,I want rex released to me

196
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,783
and I will makeall the arrangements.

197
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:36,535
Fine.

198
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:39,496
And,of course,you'll bepaying all the costs.

199
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:41,665
Of course.

200
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:44,293
Detective barton,

201
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:47,087
you are clearly a gentleman.

202
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:56,638
people have gathered at attenborough high school,

203
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,140
where melanie attended...

204
00:09:58,182 --> 00:10:00,642
no,it's fine. I'll pick 'em upon my way home.

205
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:02,686
Okay,so what do you want?

206
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:05,689
Oh,parker hates pepperoni.Um,how about sausage?

207
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:07,441
Yeah,and a small cheese.

208
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:10,068
Okay,perfect. Love you.

209
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,612
Hey,you.

210
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:12,905
Hey.

211
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,907
You wanna hit o'donnell's?I owe you a beer.

212
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,910
Actually,I owe youso much more than that.

213
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:21,246
You're welcome,but I really need to get home.

214
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:23,248
Oh,come on. I had sucha good time last night.

215
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,752
Um,why don't you ask trudy?She loves going out.

216
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:29,755
Trudy? Are you kidding?I don't need the competition.

217
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:32,674
Have you seen trudywithout her jacket? She's hot.

218
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:34,426
Oh,is she now?

219
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:36,803
Oh,I-I didn't meanthat you're not... hot.

220
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:39,097
I just--you're married.

221
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,100
You know,you're off the market.

222
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,895
I don't have to worryabout fighting you for guys.

223
00:10:44,937 --> 00:10:47,397
Come on,lynette.Just one quick little drink.

224
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:49,399
I was actuallystarting to think

225
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:51,777
that you and iwere becoming pals.

226
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:54,947
Pals? 'Cause sometimesit's hard to tell.

227
00:10:54,947 --> 00:10:57,157
You know,I wasn't feelingthe love today

228
00:10:57,199 --> 00:11:00,160
when you mocked my campaignin front of the clients.

229
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:03,789
That was justputting on a show for work.

230
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:08,585
In the future,always assumethat I am winking inside.

231
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:12,756
Come on.I hate to go to a bar alone.

232
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:14,800
I feel like such a loser.

233
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:17,803
Okay. One drink.

234
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:19,596
Yeah! One or two.

235
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:21,473
No.

236
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:47,416
Thank you so muchfor bringing my mail over.

237
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:50,419
You know,I have someof yours in the kitchen.

238
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,088
Well,that's the fourth time.What's up with this postman?

239
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:56,216
Oh,I know.He used to be great.

240
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:58,802
Then he had this stroke,and,well,

241
00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:01,930
now we're lucky if hedoesn't drool on the coupons.

242
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:04,975
But feel free to snoop around.I'll be right back.

243
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:22,242
now for those of you just joining us,

244
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:25,245
families in chicago breathed a sigh of relief today

245
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:28,248
as an arrest was finally made in the brutal attack

246
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:31,251
on local high school student melanie foster.

247
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:35,339
But word of the suspect's capture
comes as small comfort
to the foster family...

248
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,381
betty?

249
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,217
...Who lost their 17-year-old daughter

250
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,718
almost four months ago. Betty?

251
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,386
The victim's body was discovered in a local park

252
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,096
less than a mile from attenborough high.

253
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:53,440
Did you see the news?They've arrested somebody.

254
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,859
Yeah. Looks likewe're in the clear.

255
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:05,369
Well,I have some good news.

256
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,371
The police have finally releasedrex's body.

257
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,164
About time.You must be so relieved.

258
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:10,749
You know,mostly I'm just annoyed

259
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,001
that the whole thinghappened in the first place.

260
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:16,004
I mean,how in the world couldanybody accuse me of murder?

261
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:18,423
Well,you are wound pretty tight.

262
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:24,012
What? The supermom is alwaysthe first to snap.

263
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:26,014
They've done studies.

264
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:27,516
Anyway,I was hoping

265
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:30,060
that you were all freefriday morning,

266
00:13:30,102 --> 00:13:33,647
because that's when I'm goingto be hosting the reburial.

267
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:35,065
The what?

268
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:37,067
Look,I know it's an imposition,

269
00:13:37,109 --> 00:13:39,069
but danielle is awayon a class trip,

270
00:13:39,111 --> 00:13:40,737
and andrew is backat camp hennessey

271
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:42,739
for a little refresher course.

272
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,741
Well,it's just gonna be

273
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,743
a very briefand dignified ceremony,

274
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:49,454
and I was hoping thatyou could say a few words,

275
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,498
and,um,I'm gonna read a poem.

276
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:56,086
We would love to come.Absolutely.

277
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:02,092
I'm busy. Sorry.

278
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:04,094
(Whispers) edie!

279
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:06,346
(Whispers)she's going to read a poem.

280
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:11,018
Fine. Yes,yes,we'd all love to come.

281
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:14,146
Well,thank you.

282
00:14:14,188 --> 00:14:18,734
You don't know how muchthis means to me.

283
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:21,737
I realize looking backthat I was still in shock

284
00:14:21,737 --> 00:14:24,281
during rex's first funeral.

285
00:14:24,323 --> 00:14:27,910
I don't think it had quitehit me yet what had happened,

286
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,913
so that's why this smallceremony means so much to me,

287
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:32,915
because I realize now that...

288
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:38,295
this is the last chanceI'm gonna have to say good-bye.

289
00:14:43,342 --> 00:14:46,470
Unless,of course,they dig him up again.

290
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:52,559
Sure,there was times when

291
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:54,853
lisa was rude and obnoxious,

292
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:57,481
but I know now thatthat was no excuse

293
00:14:57,523 --> 00:14:59,858
to always be beatin' on her.

294
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,445
Oh,baby,I'm so sorry.

295
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:09,910
Good job,you two.

296
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:13,163
This is an example of how to useincarceration to your benefit.

297
00:15:13,205 --> 00:15:16,208
It's a chance for peopleto take a step back

298
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,586
and observe the obstaclesthey face in their marriage.

299
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:22,589
Can I go now?'Cause I have a lot to say

300
00:15:22,631 --> 00:15:25,092
about the obstacles I'm facingin my marriage.

301
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:27,094
We don't got any obstacles.

302
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:29,054
Yes,we do,lamar.We got big ones.

303
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:30,556
Okay,hold on,you two.

304
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:33,267
I think that it'scarlos and gabrielle's turn.

305
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:35,269
Thanks,but we're good.

306
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:39,898
this isyour third group session,

307
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,900
but you have yetto share anything.

308
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:46,446
Come on. Talk to us.How's your marriage?

309
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:50,242
Shaky at best.And why is that?

310
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:52,744
I don't know.I hired a brilliant lawyer

311
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:54,246
to get my husbandout of this hellhole,

312
00:15:54,246 --> 00:15:56,290
and he fired himfor no reason at all.

313
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:58,667
Carlos?

314
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:00,419
I just didn't like him.

315
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,421
Why not? He's experienced,he's intelligent,

316
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,256
he's successful.Exactly.

317
00:16:04,256 --> 00:16:06,633
I'd prefer an attorney youdidn't find so damn appealing.

318
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:09,928
Oh,my god. You fired himbecause you're jealous?

319
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,306
Don't I have the right to?
You know,she cheated on me.

320
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:16,643
-oh,bob,you beat your wife
You are so not allowed to gasp.
-Don't you talk that wayto him.

321
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:19,605
One more word out of you,lisa,and I will backhand you myself.

322
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:22,482
Okay,calm down.
Thousands of fat,bald attorneysout there in the world,

323
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:24,735
and she's gotta get the one thatlooks like an underwear model.

324
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:26,695
I'm not discussing thisanymore.

325
00:16:26,737 --> 00:16:29,364
You can rot in herefor all I care.

326
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:32,951
So,um...

327
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:34,953
mona,what do you feel

328
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:36,955
are the biggest problemsin your marriage?

329
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:38,874
By the way,he was wearing a suit.

330
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:40,542
How do you knowhe had a good body?

331
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:42,377
- Do you know?
- No!

332
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:44,129
I bet he's hot.

333
00:16:47,174 --> 00:16:50,385
Do I need to say whatour biggest problem is,

334
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:53,847
or can everybody figure it outfor themselves?

335
00:16:57,893 --> 00:16:59,853
Why are you readingthat contract?

336
00:16:59,895 --> 00:17:02,940
I told you. Lonny wants meto sign with this new agency.

337
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:04,441
But you didn't say

338
00:17:04,483 --> 00:17:06,693
you were seriously thinkingabout going with him.

339
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:09,863
I know,I know.

340
00:17:09,905 --> 00:17:11,365
Just lonny's family.

341
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:13,784
You know,he's alwaysbeen there for me.

342
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:16,286
He paid my rentwhen I was waiting

343
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:18,080
for my first royalty check.

344
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:19,873
He called me every daywhen karl left.

345
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:21,542
I mean,I just owe himso much.

346
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,043
Susan,he committed a felony.

347
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:24,461
Okay,who in this room

348
00:17:24,503 --> 00:17:27,297
has not committed a felony?Raise your hand.

349
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:29,091
Ah-ah-ah,not so fast.

350
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:30,592
Your agent represents you.

351
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:32,427
You've gotta be ableto trust him.

352
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:34,429
How is that gonna bepossible now?

353
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:38,559
Well,it's possible becauseI have faith in people.

354
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,060
I mean,lonny knowshe messed up,

355
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:42,020
and he's sorry.He's making restitution.

356
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:45,482
What,you don't believe peopledeserve second chances?

357
00:17:45,524 --> 00:17:47,985
Not when they messed upthis much,no.

358
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:51,321
Really? So that's it with you?You just get one shot,

359
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:53,824
and you screw up,and you're out?

360
00:17:53,866 --> 00:17:55,993
I didn't knowyou were such a cynic.

361
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:58,036
Hey,I'm sorry,all right?

362
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:00,289
I guess it's justthe way I'm wired.

363
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:03,792
I got a jobover in greenwood,

364
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:07,004
so I'll call youlater tonight.

365
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:16,972
You okay?

366
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:20,392
julie...

367
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:25,397
I did something bad,something really,really bad.

368
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:30,485
Aren't you gonna ask mewhat it was?

369
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:33,030
Do I ever have to?

370
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:35,782
Last week when mike and iwent to the park

371
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:38,785
searching for zach,

372
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:40,204
I sort of found him.

373
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:41,538
No!

374
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,541
Yes,and I gave him moneyand I sent him away,

375
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,460
and I didn't tell mike.

376
00:18:46,502 --> 00:18:49,129
Holy crap.What are you gonna do?

377
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:51,965
I don't know. What would you doif this happened to you?

378
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:53,967
See,this would neverhappen to me.

379
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:55,969
This kind of thingonly happens to you.

380
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:58,430
Will you stop judgingand help me?

381
00:18:58,472 --> 00:19:00,599
Well,obviously,you're gonna have to tell him.

382
00:19:00,641 --> 00:19:02,434
Well,I can't do that.

383
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:04,436
You heard what he saidabout his wiring.
I betrayed him.

384
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:06,897
He'll never forgive me.Okay. Don't tell him.

385
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:08,941
Well,how can I not?I feel so guilty,

386
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:12,110
I can barely look him in the eyewhen he talks about zach.

387
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,446
So where do you thinkzach went?

388
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:17,658
Utah.

389
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:22,788
Oh,lord.Why did I do this?

390
00:19:22,788 --> 00:19:25,582
I have a feelingyou did it for me.

391
00:19:46,937 --> 00:19:49,898
Hey,girl. I hope you arein the mood for margaritas

392
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:53,235

393
00:19:53,277 --> 00:19:56,572
Oh,fun. But I can't go tonightbecause I promised the twins

394
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:58,949
that I would help themfinish their science project.

395
00:19:58,949 --> 00:20:03,120
Lynette,if the late hours

396
00:20:03,162 --> 00:20:05,455
are going to be an issuefor you,

397
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:07,457
we probably shouldtalk about finding you

398
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:10,127
a less demanding account.

399
00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:12,129
You're gonnatake me off kamarov

400
00:20:12,171 --> 00:20:14,214

00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:22,139
Thank you.

405
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:24,308
I mean,for me,the client comes first.

406
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:26,768
Me being a perfectionistis my own neurotic issue,

407
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:29,646
and I know that I reallyneed to work on that.

408
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:31,648
But trust me,I will never sleep again

412
00:20:40,449 --> 00:20:42,326

413
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:45,454

414
00:20:45,496 --> 00:20:47,998

415
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,291

It's time we talked about her,caleb.

427
00:22:04,283 --> 00:22:06,285
Until you start acceptingresponsibility

428
00:22:06,285 --> 00:22:07,786

429
00:22:07,786 --> 00:22:11,665

430
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:22,009

What were you gonna do with this?
Don'T.

437
00:22:44,156 --> 00:22:46,116
"I know who really killedmelanie foster.

438
00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:47,784
"You've arrestedthe wrong man"?

439
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:49,286
What are you thinking?

440
00:22:49,286 --> 00:22:51,038
The police need to knowthe truth.

441
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:52,873
The hell they do!This is our chance.

442
00:22:52,915 --> 00:22:54,958
We are good people.

443
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:58,045
We can't letan innocent man go to jail.

444
00:22:58,086 --> 00:22:59,963
Okay,you wanna dothe right thing?

445
00:22:59,963 --> 00:23:01,965
Well,then call 9-1-1and tell 'em

446

you got a killerlocked up in the basement.

447
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:05,969
He is not a killer.He was confused.

448
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:07,971
He didn't knowwhat he was doing.

449
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:10,390
He knows a lot more thanyou give him credit for.

450
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:11,975
I'm mailing the letter.

451
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:13,644
Do you realizewhat's gonna happen?

452
00:23:13,644 --> 00:23:17,523
Mom,are youthinking it through?

453
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:19,149
I'm mailing the letter.

454
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:22,444
If you do,you'd better hopeto god they don't find us.

455
00:23:26,448 --> 00:23:29,284
'Cause they're not gonna carehow slow caleb is.

456
00:23:29,284 --> 00:23:32,079
They'll just execute him.

457
00:23:58,355 --> 00:24:00,774
Lonny?

458
00:24:00,816 --> 00:24:03,193

Susan?

461
00:24:06,738 --> 00:24:08,574
What are you doing here?

462
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:11,243
Well,I just came overto give you the contracts.

463
00:24:11,285 --> 00:24:12,744
Your door was open.

464
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:15,372
Oh. Great.

465
00:24:15,414 --> 00:24:17,374
Sorry this placeis such a mess.

466
00:24:17,416 --> 00:24:21,795
I've been working here tillwe get the new offices painted.

467
00:24:21,795 --> 00:24:23,797
Wait till you see them.

468
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:26,300
They're gonna bereally beautiful.

469
00:24:28,135 --> 00:24:29,344
Where's jeannie?

470
00:24:29,386 --> 00:24:31,346
She's with the kidsup in minnesota

471
00:24:31,388 --> 00:24:32,848
visiting her mom.

472
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:35,392
They love it up there.

473
00:24:35,434 --> 00:24:38,312
Keep changing the dateon dear old dad.

474
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,860
There's no electricity.

475
00:24:44,902 --> 00:24:46,445
There isn't?

476
00:24:46,445 --> 00:24:49,615
Oh,I'm such a dummy.

477
00:24:49,656 --> 00:24:50,949
I've been...

478
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:52,451
I've been so swamped,

479
00:24:52,493 --> 00:24:55,621
I must have forgottento pay the electric bill.

480
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:57,706
Lonny...

481
00:24:57,748 --> 00:25:01,293
how much financial troubleare you really in?

482
00:25:03,837 --> 00:25:05,172
I'm fine.

483
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,634
You know what it is?

484
00:25:08,634 --> 00:25:10,886
I had to pay all those peopleback at the same time--

485
00:25:10,928 --> 00:25:12,387
restitution plus interest.

486
00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:14,765
It's not somethingI'd recommend.

487
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:16,725
It sucks you dry.

488
00:25:16,767 --> 00:25:18,769
I've gonna ask youa question,

489
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:21,605
and I want youto tell me the truth.

490
00:25:21,647 --> 00:25:23,774
Did you steal from me?

491
00:25:23,815 --> 00:25:25,484
Absolutely not.

492
00:25:25,526 --> 00:25:29,112
Please don't lie.Just tell me.

493
00:25:29,112 --> 00:25:31,114
Is that what you wantto hear?

494
00:25:31,114 --> 00:25:35,410
Do I have to say itso that we can move on?

495
00:25:37,454 --> 00:25:39,873
Fine. I did it.

496
00:25:39,915 --> 00:25:42,543
But yours wasthe first money I paid back,

497
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:44,545
so the slate'sbeen wiped clean.

498
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:46,797
Let's just move past it.

499
00:25:46,797 --> 00:25:49,800
Suze?

500
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,970
I'm sorry. I just can'ttrust you anymore.

501
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:54,763
Yes,you can!No,I can'T.

502
00:25:54,805 --> 00:25:56,139
You can.Can'T.

503
00:25:56,139 --> 00:25:57,891
Give me the contract!

504
00:25:57,933 --> 00:26:00,477
No!

505
00:26:00,477 --> 00:26:04,022
okay,okay,fine.

506
00:26:04,064 --> 00:26:06,817
Aah! What are you doing?!

507
00:26:06,817 --> 00:26:09,987
Are you tryingto take me down with you?!

508
00:26:10,028 --> 00:26:12,489
I am not going down!

509
00:26:12,531 --> 00:26:14,950
My life is great!

510
00:26:14,992 --> 00:26:17,286
I have never been happier,

511
00:26:17,286 --> 00:26:19,496
and I've never been thinner!

512
00:26:19,538 --> 00:26:22,624
Get off me,you amazon!

513
00:26:34,636 --> 00:26:36,638
what are you doing here?

514
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:40,017
You left me a message.You said you wanted to talk.

515
00:26:40,058 --> 00:26:43,145
Yeah,I thought you'd schedulean appointment later.

516
00:26:43,187 --> 00:26:45,981
Right now I'm sort ofdisgusting and sweaty.

517
00:26:45,981 --> 00:26:49,443
I'm a criminal lawyer.I've seen worse.

518
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:01,413
So did you find a new lawyerfor mr. Charming?

519
00:27:01,455 --> 00:27:03,415
I don't want a new lawyer.I want you.

520
00:27:03,457 --> 00:27:06,335
So does carlos.He just doesn't realize it yet.

521
00:27:06,376 --> 00:27:10,255
A 1988 romanée-conti la tche.I'm impressed.

522
00:27:10,297 --> 00:27:13,425
Look,to be honest,carlos isa little threatened by you.

523
00:27:13,467 --> 00:27:15,928
He thinks if we spendtoo much time together,

524
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:18,805
that something...might happen.

525
00:27:18,805 --> 00:27:21,642
Somebody's gotan active imagination.

526
00:27:21,642 --> 00:27:23,727
Corkscrew?

527
00:27:23,769 --> 00:27:26,146
David,we're not hereto drink wine,okay?

528
00:27:26,188 --> 00:27:27,648
This is business.

529
00:27:27,689 --> 00:27:32,361
Now you have to convincecarlos that he can trust you.

530
00:27:32,402 --> 00:27:34,696
How am I gonna do that?

531
00:27:34,738 --> 00:27:39,660
I don't know. Tell him you'rehappily married or--or gay.

532
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:43,664
yeah,right.
You're a lawyer. You lieto juries all the time.

533
00:27:43,664 --> 00:27:46,416
Can't you just make something up?
I'm past the pointin my career

534
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:48,919
where I have to beg for work.I'm sorry.

535
00:27:48,961 --> 00:27:52,422
Okay,david,I'm holdingmy marriage together
by my fingernails.

536
00:27:52,464 --> 00:27:53,924
If carlos serveshis full sentence,

537
00:27:53,966 --> 00:27:57,344
I don't think we're gonnamake it,so please,I need you.

538
00:27:57,386 --> 00:28:02,516
I'll say this much for carlos.He's got excellent taste...

539
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:06,895
in wine. Montrachet.It's good stuff.

540
00:28:06,937 --> 00:28:09,481
Are you gonna help meor not?

541
00:28:09,523 --> 00:28:12,693
We'll go see carlos tomorrow.I'll turn him around for you.

542
00:28:12,734 --> 00:28:15,320
Really?What are you gonna say?

543
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,657
Play it by ear. I don't wannasound too over-rehearsed.

544
00:28:20,284 --> 00:28:22,244
Hey,that's my wine.

545
00:28:22,286 --> 00:28:25,164
Deduct it from my bill.

546
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:31,378
It all started withbad real estate investments.

547
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,797
You should have justcome clean.

548
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:38,510
Yeah,well,you tell one lie,the second one comes easy.

549
00:28:38,552 --> 00:28:41,763
Then you're making up new liesto cover up the old ones.

550
00:28:41,805 --> 00:28:45,142
Pretty soon,you can't turn back,you know?

551
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,894
I do.

552
00:28:46,935 --> 00:28:51,190
When jeannie finally caught on,she took the kids.

553
00:28:51,231 --> 00:28:53,525
She took the furniture.

554
00:28:53,567 --> 00:28:57,404
The bank locked meout of my own house.

555
00:29:00,824 --> 00:29:04,828
That's why I can't lose youas a client.

556
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:08,373
Well,I'm sorry,but you have.

557
00:29:08,415 --> 00:29:09,875
I don't blame you.

558
00:29:09,917 --> 00:29:13,170
You'll never losemy friendship,though.

559
00:29:13,212 --> 00:29:14,922
I mean that.

560
00:29:14,922 --> 00:29:15,923
Really?

561
00:29:15,923 --> 00:29:18,800
Of course.You're my lonny.

562
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,929
and you're my susie.

563
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:25,349
you're my susie.

564
00:29:28,602 --> 00:29:32,397
Oh! What the hellis wrong with you?!

565
00:29:32,397 --> 00:29:33,899
I'm your lonny.That's what you said.

566
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:36,443
Not like that.
But I thought...

567
00:29:36,485 --> 00:29:38,654
I mean,there's alwaysbeen this magnetism.

568
00:29:38,695 --> 00:29:41,740
No,there has not been,and there never will be!

569
00:29:41,782 --> 00:29:43,867
Oh,my god!

570
00:29:43,909 --> 00:29:46,578
But I was just coming clean!

571
00:29:50,207 --> 00:29:52,876
Hey,morgan!

572
00:29:52,918 --> 00:29:54,878
Got a letterfrom some guy

573
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,964
claiming he attackedmelanie foster.

574
00:29:57,005 --> 00:29:58,966
You ran me down for that?

575
00:29:59,007 --> 00:30:01,176
I got dozens of kookscoming out of the woodwork,

576
00:30:01,218 --> 00:30:03,178
all saying we arrestedthe wrong guy.

577
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,305
This one knowsabout the ax.

578
00:30:24,366 --> 00:30:26,618
Here you go,mrs. Van de kamp.

579
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,620
Thank you.The hearse is right outside,

580
00:30:28,662 --> 00:30:31,331
so if you'll justfollow me...

581
00:30:31,373 --> 00:30:34,001
oh,shoot. There's a formI need you to sign.
I think I left itback in the office.

582
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:36,003
That's all right.

583
00:30:36,044 --> 00:30:38,630
I'll wait.Okay.

584
00:30:44,052 --> 00:30:46,889
I'm here,sweetheart,

585
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:49,433
and I'm gonna take careof everything.

586
00:30:49,433 --> 00:30:51,393
But you knew that,didn't you?

587
00:30:51,435 --> 00:30:55,105
You've always knownthat you can count on me.

588
00:30:55,147 --> 00:30:56,607
Mrs. Van de kamp.

589
00:30:56,648 --> 00:30:59,526
Detective barton,what are you doing here?

590
00:30:59,568 --> 00:31:02,446
Oh,just taking careof some business.

591
00:31:02,488 --> 00:31:04,114
Is this...

592
00:31:04,156 --> 00:31:07,743
yes. This is rex.

593
00:31:07,784 --> 00:31:11,205
I-I wanna thank you againfor what you did.

594
00:31:11,246 --> 00:31:14,416
It was so refreshingto be treated with kindness

595
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:17,461
after weeks of justludicrous accusations.

596
00:31:17,503 --> 00:31:20,589
The doctor doesn't thinkthey're ludicrous.

597
00:31:20,631 --> 00:31:22,591
Well,I know,but rex died in his care.

598
00:31:22,633 --> 00:31:25,302
I mean,of course he'd liketo blame someone else.

599
00:31:25,344 --> 00:31:26,720
But the tests he did,uh...

600
00:31:26,762 --> 00:31:28,722
oh,please don't talk to meabout tests.

601
00:31:28,764 --> 00:31:30,224
Rex was not poisoned,

602
00:31:30,265 --> 00:31:32,726
and no one I knowbelieves that he was.

603
00:31:32,768 --> 00:31:34,478
Rex did.

604
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,313
What?

605
00:31:36,355 --> 00:31:38,815
Well,the doctor told rexhe was being poisoned,

606
00:31:38,857 --> 00:31:40,359
and rex believed him.

607
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,194
How would you know that?

608
00:31:52,454 --> 00:31:53,914
Where did you get this?

609
00:31:53,956 --> 00:31:56,250
We found that in rex's bedafter he died.

610
00:31:56,291 --> 00:31:58,460
That is his handwriting,isn't it?

611
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:10,097
You know what I think?

612
00:32:10,097 --> 00:32:15,561
Rex felt guiltyfor the way he treated you.

613
00:32:15,602 --> 00:32:19,398
The adultery,the public humiliations.

614
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:23,026
That's why he forgave you.He understood why you did it.

615
00:32:23,068 --> 00:32:26,446
How couldhe have believed this?

616
00:32:26,446 --> 00:32:28,407
Look,my wife cheated on me,too.

617
00:32:28,448 --> 00:32:32,244
I know how much it hurts.

618
00:32:32,286 --> 00:32:35,080
And so will a judge.

619
00:32:35,122 --> 00:32:38,917
Everyone understandscrimes of passion.

620
00:32:38,917 --> 00:32:42,087
But every daythat you stonewall

621
00:32:42,087 --> 00:32:44,089
makes you lookmore and more

622
00:32:44,089 --> 00:32:47,301
like a cold,calculating killer.

623
00:32:47,301 --> 00:32:50,512
We both knowthat's not you.

624
00:32:50,554 --> 00:32:54,474
But I can't help you unlessyou start telling the truth.

625
00:33:04,902 --> 00:33:07,779
I'm sorry,but I-I,um,I have to go.

626
00:33:07,821 --> 00:33:11,033
I have some thingsthat I need to take care of.

627
00:33:16,914 --> 00:33:19,917
Bree,it is obvious your husbandloved you very much.

628
00:33:19,917 --> 00:33:22,503
Don't you think you owe to himto admit the truth?

629
00:33:22,544 --> 00:33:24,755
Detective,I know exactlywhat my husband deserves.

630
00:33:24,796 --> 00:33:26,798
Now would you be a dear?

631
00:33:31,386 --> 00:33:33,722
Thank you.

632
00:33:49,196 --> 00:33:51,156
What's he doing here?

633
00:33:51,198 --> 00:33:54,618
I have a pitch for you.

634
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,829
I wanna explain to you

635
00:33:56,870 --> 00:34:00,165
why I think it's in your bestinterest for you to allow me
to represent you.

636
00:34:00,207 --> 00:34:03,001
Oh,for pete's sake,carlos,at least listen to the man.

637
00:34:05,254 --> 00:34:08,215
I guess it beatssitting in my cell.

638
00:34:09,258 --> 00:34:13,387
Now I don't think you havea problem with me as a lawyer.

639
00:34:13,387 --> 00:34:14,596
Clearly,I'm the real deal.

640
00:34:14,721 --> 00:34:17,015
I sense your problemwith me is more personal.

641
00:34:17,057 --> 00:34:18,684
You sense right.

642
00:34:18,851 --> 00:34:22,020
You wanna know if I'm interestedin sleeping with your wife.

643
00:34:22,271 --> 00:34:26,817
And the answer is yes.

644
00:34:32,156 --> 00:34:34,366
he--carlos,he's kidding.

645
00:34:36,034 --> 00:34:37,369
tell him you're kidding.

646
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:39,037
Shut it.

647
00:34:39,454 --> 00:34:40,706
Now clearly,

648
00:34:40,706 --> 00:34:44,376
gabrielle's willful,self-centered and manipulative.

649
00:34:44,418 --> 00:34:47,671
She's also beautiful enoughto be worth the trouble.

650
00:34:47,713 --> 00:34:49,882
So the minutewe leave this room,

651
00:34:49,923 --> 00:34:50,883
I'm going to aggressivelypursue her,

652
00:34:50,883 --> 00:34:52,801
and when I succeed,which I will,

653
00:34:52,801 --> 00:34:55,012
we're gonna flyto my chateau in chamonix
and have dinnerin a local bistro.

654
00:34:55,012 --> 00:34:56,889
They make the best raclettein all of europe.

655
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:59,892
We'll make love by the fireand afterwards

656
00:35:01,226 --> 00:35:03,312
do a little midnight skiing.You ski,don't you?

657
00:35:03,353 --> 00:35:06,315
You're athletic.You'll learn.

658
00:35:06,356 --> 00:35:10,527
Anyway,all of thisonly happens if you fire me.

659
00:35:10,569 --> 00:35:13,572
If you keep me onas your lawyer,
your wife's off-limits.

660
00:35:13,655 --> 00:35:18,535
I'd get disbarred for sleepingwith a client's wife,
and nobody's worth that,not even her.

661
00:35:19,495 --> 00:35:21,622
So that's my pitch.

662
00:35:21,663 --> 00:35:23,665
I'll let you think about it.

663
00:35:28,504 --> 00:35:30,631
Honey,I am so sorry.

664
00:35:30,881 --> 00:35:32,883
Honestly,that guy's insane.

665
00:35:32,925 --> 00:35:36,220
Boy,you just can't wait,can you?

666
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,679
What?

667
00:35:38,055 --> 00:35:41,391
He's my lawyer.But,carlos--

668
00:35:41,433 --> 00:35:44,686
and that's allthere is to it.

669
00:35:53,111 --> 00:35:54,571
How about a dance?

670
00:35:54,613 --> 00:35:56,073
How about it? Yes.

671
00:35:56,114 --> 00:35:59,368
Well,you guys have fun.

672
00:35:59,409 --> 00:36:01,119
This is the fifth nightin a row

673
00:36:01,161 --> 00:36:03,622
I haven't been hometo tuck in my kids,

674
00:36:03,664 --> 00:36:05,082
so I'm gonna go.

675
00:36:05,123 --> 00:36:07,000
No. You're gonna stay put.It is friday night,

676
00:36:07,042 --> 00:36:09,711
and you have all weekendto play with your kids.

677
00:36:09,753 --> 00:36:11,255
Watch my purse.

678
00:36:25,727 --> 00:36:26,728
Hey.

679
00:36:26,728 --> 00:36:28,480
I'm chuck.

680
00:36:28,522 --> 00:36:31,233
Chuck,I'm gonna stop youright there.

681
00:36:31,233 --> 00:36:32,734
Happily married.

682
00:36:32,734 --> 00:36:34,945
Well...

683
00:36:34,987 --> 00:36:39,449
looks like we have gotsomething in common.

684
00:36:42,995 --> 00:36:44,705
Chuck?

685
00:36:44,746 --> 00:36:46,748
Get your handoff my thigh.

686
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:51,211
No,not up my thigh.Off it.

687
00:36:51,253 --> 00:36:53,922
Come on!What's the matter with you?

688
00:36:53,964 --> 00:36:56,216
I'm not available.And I'm not that easy!

689
00:36:56,258 --> 00:36:58,844
Well,what are you doing ina pick-up bar at 10:30 at night?

690
00:36:58,886 --> 00:37:02,222
Well,I don't usuallydo this.

691
00:37:02,264 --> 00:37:04,224
Oh,come on,honey,who are you kidding?

692
00:37:04,266 --> 00:37:07,019
I've seen you here every nightthis week. You're a regular.

693
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:09,938
At that moment it occurred to lynette

694
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,732
that chuck,though inebriated,

695
00:37:11,773 --> 00:37:13,233
had a valid point.

696
00:37:13,275 --> 00:37:15,819
The time had come to declare

697
00:37:15,861 --> 00:37:17,946
a war of independence.

698
00:37:17,988 --> 00:37:20,407
And the surest path to victory

699
00:37:20,407 --> 00:37:22,576
would require an aggressive campaign

700
00:37:22,618 --> 00:37:28,290
of shock...
and awe.

701
00:38:31,687 --> 00:38:34,565
it's crazy here tonight.

702
00:38:34,606 --> 00:38:36,066
Don't you wantto dance?

703
00:38:36,066 --> 00:38:40,571
No,thanks. I thinkI'll sit this one out.

704
00:38:40,612 --> 00:38:42,739
Lynette savored her victory

705
00:38:42,781 --> 00:38:45,701
confident that she would never again

706
00:38:45,742 --> 00:38:48,495
have to engage her opponent on this particular battlefield.

707
00:38:48,537 --> 00:38:50,497
Ooh! I love this song.

708
00:38:50,539 --> 00:38:52,916
Here,hold my purse.

709
00:39:05,971 --> 00:39:08,807
Bree,where have you been?We were starting to get worried.

710
00:39:08,807 --> 00:39:10,058
Oh,I'm sorry.

711
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,060
I was just attendingto some last minute details.

712
00:39:12,102 --> 00:39:14,563
Right this way.Where are we going?

713
00:39:14,605 --> 00:39:16,565
To rex's gravesite.

714
00:39:16,607 --> 00:39:18,567
Well,I thought thatthis was his gravesite.

715
00:39:18,609 --> 00:39:20,068
I'm changing it.Why?

716
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:22,070
Well,he did something toupset me,and I want him gone.

717
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:23,739
What did he do?

718
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,407
You know,it's so unpleasant.I'd rather not get into it.

719
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:28,494
Have you seen these gravestones?Some are from the 1800s.

720
00:39:28,535 --> 00:39:30,245
Just fascinating.

721
00:39:30,287 --> 00:39:32,247
Bree,wait,you're gonnahave to explain.

722
00:39:32,289 --> 00:39:34,917
Rex is dead. What couldhe have done to upset you?

723
00:39:38,795 --> 00:39:42,674
My husband,the man I spentmy life with for 18 years,

724
00:39:42,716 --> 00:39:44,760
died thinkingthat I murdered him.

725
00:39:44,801 --> 00:39:46,345
What?

726
00:39:46,345 --> 00:39:48,555
Yes,the cardiologist sharedthis moronic theory with rex.

727
00:39:48,597 --> 00:39:50,474
And rex believed him!

728
00:39:50,474 --> 00:39:51,934
Are you sure?

729
00:39:51,975 --> 00:39:54,937
Yes,because he left a noteand it said,and I quote,

730
00:39:54,978 --> 00:39:58,941
"bree,I understand.And I forgive you."

731
00:40:01,193 --> 00:40:05,155
I spent 18 years of my lifewith this man.

732
00:40:05,197 --> 00:40:07,157
How could he not know me?

733
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:10,118
Well,maybe he was forgiving youfor something else.

734
00:40:14,122 --> 00:40:18,001
I have done nothing to be forgiven for!

735
00:40:18,001 --> 00:40:21,421
I was a fantastic wife!

736
00:40:21,463 --> 00:40:22,840
When he was sick,I nursed him.

737
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,967
When we were low on money,I stayed within a budget.

738
00:40:25,008 --> 00:40:27,427
I cooked his meals.I mended his clothes.

739
00:40:27,469 --> 00:40:30,013
For the love of god,I usedto check his back for acne.

740
00:40:31,557 --> 00:40:34,977
And that miserableson of a bitch

741
00:40:35,018 --> 00:40:37,980
has the nerve to understandand forgive me?

742
00:40:38,021 --> 00:40:39,982
Well,the joke's on him,

743
00:40:40,023 --> 00:40:42,901
because I do not understand,and I do not forgive.

744
00:40:46,738 --> 00:40:50,576
Hi. We're--we're just going to a funeral.

745
00:40:51,869 --> 00:40:54,037
Right this way.

746
00:41:05,132 --> 00:41:06,466
Honey,I know you're hurt,but are you sure

747
00:41:06,508 --> 00:41:09,219
you're not gonnachange your mind?

748
00:41:09,261 --> 00:41:11,847
I mean,there's noturning back after this.

749
00:41:11,889 --> 00:41:14,683
If you think I'm gonnalay next to someone for eternity

750
00:41:14,683 --> 00:41:15,976
who thinks I'm a murderer,you're crazy.

751
00:41:16,018 --> 00:41:21,648
As far as I'm concerned,
let him decomposewith strangers.

752
00:41:36,413 --> 00:41:41,877
Everyone in the world needs someone they can depend on,

753
00:41:41,919 --> 00:41:46,465
be they faithful friends,

754
00:41:46,507 --> 00:41:49,343
determined advocates...

755
00:41:52,846 --> 00:41:57,184
or a loving family.

756
00:41:57,184 --> 00:41:59,478
But occasionally in life,

757
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:03,941
the people we thought would always be there for us leave.

758
00:42:06,777 --> 00:42:08,946
And if that happens,

759
00:42:10,489 --> 00:42:12,950
it's amazing the lengths we'll go to...

760
00:42:13,992 --> 00:42:15,953
to get them back.
