2
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:05,547
Previously on "desperate housewives"...

3
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:07,716
you're not taking me?Dad's gonna take you.

4
00:00:07,758 --> 00:00:09,885
Lynette's new job came with a price.

5
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:12,888
If this charge sticks,I get sent awayfor eight years.

6
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:15,140
And carlos paid for his mistakes.

7
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:16,725
Are you in lovewith mr. Williams?

8
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:17,559
No.

9
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:19,520
I think the machinepicked up on something

10
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:20,771
that I wasn't aware of.

11
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:22,397
While bree detected feelings

12
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:23,232
she'd never known.

13
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:26,276
You come within 10 feet of her,I will have you arrested.

14
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:27,486
Now get out. Susan discovered something...

15
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:29,404
zach is your son,isn't he?

16
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:31,990
Too close to home.

17
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,036
The residents of the fairview county jail

18
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:38,455
looked forward to every tuesday.

19
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:40,624
That was the day that gabrielle solis

20
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:42,709
came to visit her husband.

21
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:46,046
The inmates went out of their way to give her compliments

22
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:48,799
whether she wanted them to or not.

23
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:51,927
With each visit,these accolades became

24
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:54,471
increasingly inventive.

25
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,850
Still,gabrielle was not flattered.

26
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:03,480
In fact,gabrielle started to dread this special attention.

27
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:07,734
Until one day,when...

28
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:10,696
I don't think a conjugal visitis such a ridiculous request.

29
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,155
With all due respect,mrs. Solis,

30
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,491
let's just get throughthe discovery phase first,okay?

31
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:15,826
But I don't thinkI can wait that long.

32
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,287
I am trying to get your husbandout of jail.

33
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,788
Do you want me to juststop everything

34
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,290
so you can havea booty call?

35
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,500
Excuse me,we are husband and wife.

36
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,044
We make love.It is a very sacred covenant.

37
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:28,797
Okay,look,all we need is 20 minutes.

38
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:30,966
I said no.You can't tell me no.

39
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:32,301
You work for me.

40
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,760
You will make it happen.

41
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:35,637
You can't force meto do anything.

42
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:38,724
I am not your maidor your gardener.

43
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:42,269
I can have youarrested for that.

44
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:44,521
Oh,really?And how about for this?

45
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,357
You crazy bitch!

46
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:51,528
Hey,apologize to the lady.

47
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:54,907
Big mistake,pal.I play golf with the warden.

48
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,825
You're gonna rot--

49
00:01:57,326 --> 00:01:59,578
You heard him.Apologize.

50
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,287
Look,fellas,

51
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,040
I am just trying to do my job.This is all her fault!

52
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,751
If she weren't so damn horny--ow!

53
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:08,879
All right! All right!

54
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:10,464
come on!

55
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:16,220
It was at that moment it occurred to gabrielle...

56
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:17,387
apologize!

57
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:22,559
This was the nicest compliment she had ever received.

58
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:04,351
Desperate Houswives
S2 E04

59
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:12,401
There was one thing all the fathers on wisteria lane had in common--

60
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:17,030
they could return home from a hard day's work to the family they'd left behind

61
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:22,035
and not feel at all guilty about the precious moments they had missed.

62
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:29,459
Sadly,the same could not be said for the working mothers.

63
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:50,189
Hey,honey,I held dinner for as long as I could.

64
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:51,064
It just got...

65
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:52,649
too late for them.

66
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,735
You couldn't have given 'em coffee or something?

67
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:58,488
I just feel like I'm missing out on their lives entirely.

68
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:02,951
Hey,you sit,eat,and I will fill you in.

69
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:05,454
Oh,don't eat that. That's been sitting out for hours.

70
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:07,039
That's for mrs. Mulberry.

71
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:07,956
This...

72
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,626
is for you.

73
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,252
I'm sorry. Who?

74
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:14,338
Oh,mrs. Mulberry.

75
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,256
Parker has an imaginary friend.

76
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,133
Um,british nanny.

77
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:22,012
I think he really locked into the whole "mary poppins" thing.

78
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:23,805
Is that why he's sleeping with an umbrella?

79
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,266
He carries it with him everywhere.

80
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,851
It's a security blanket.

81
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,770
When did this start?

82
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:31,271
About a week ago,I guess.

83
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:33,941
And you don't find it odd that parker's new nanny

84
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,568
made her appearance right at the time I went back to work?

85
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,986
Kids have imaginary friends.

86
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:38,862
It's no big deal.

87
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:40,155
I'll agree with you to a point,

88
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:42,491
when they're flying kangaroos or giant robots,

89
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:44,493
not surrogate mommies.

90
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:45,744
Hey...

91
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,164
parker is having a little trouble adjusting.

92
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:50,499
That's all.

93
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,251
Apparently,so are you.

94
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:53,877
Honey,don't be so sensitive.

95
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,712
I hope you're right.

96
00:04:57,256 --> 00:05:00,384
At the risk of sounding too sensitive,

97
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:03,095
how come she gets a bigger portion?

98
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:11,937
That's it?

99
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:14,606
You're the one who said you wanted things to be casual between us.

100
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:15,148
Yeah,

101
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,943
but that doesn't mean we have to act like brother and sister.

102
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:21,738
I mean,you bought me ribs.I have gratitude to express.

103
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,204
What's wrong?

104
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:30,289
I can't do this.

105
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,707
This casual thing--

106
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,084
it's--it's weird.

107
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:36,545
No! No! It's not.

108
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:40,174
We're just gonna pretend like it was when we first started dating.

109
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:42,092
We just see each other occasionally,

110
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:46,138
you know,until we get the zach thing resolved.

111
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,016
Yeah,well,we'll just be easy about it. No commitments.

112
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:49,975
Except,of course,

113
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,853
neither of us is allowed to date anybody else.

114
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:55,898
Look,I...

115
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,108
I know how you feel about zach.

116
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,401
And,look,

117
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:00,903
I don't blame you.

118
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:03,447
But he's part of the package right now,

119
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:07,618
and either you can accept that or you can'T.

120
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,251
Well,anyway...

121
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:24,051
mike,wait!

122
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,596
I accept.

123
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:29,056
Are you sure?

124
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,724
Zach's your son.

125
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:31,808
And I have julie,

126
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,602
and you've totally accepted her.

127
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:35,896
I mean,granted,she's been the model child so far.

128
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:39,066
But she's almost 15. She's going to turn on me any minute.

129
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:42,236
And you better be there to help me when it gets ugly.

130
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:44,112
I will.

131
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:51,578
Good night.

132
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,247
- Uh,susan?
- Yeah?

133
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:58,502
Technically,we don't have to be casual anymore.

134
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:01,421
I can be naked in 20 seconds.

135
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:03,298
That includes travel time.

136
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,842
Carlos,will you calm down?

137
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:06,802
You incited a prison riot.

138
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:07,761
It wasn't a riot.

139
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:09,471
It was more of a melee.

140
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:10,722
Who's going to defend me now?

141
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:11,723
Doyle knew my case.

142
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,809
He knew the judge.He called me a bitch.

143
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:15,602
Well,were you actinglike one?

144
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:18,981
He refused to help meget a conjugal visit.

145
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:21,316
Hold it.

146
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:24,152
My lawyer's in tractionbecause you wanted sex?

147
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:27,114
Not just for me,for us.

148
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,866
In case you haven't noticed,carlos,

149
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:31,410
our marriage is stillon shaky ground.

150
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,704
And you thought a conjugal visit would fix it?

151
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:35,330
It couldn't hurt.

152
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,040
Ever since you've been in here,all we do is bicker.

153
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,835
That's all we ever did whenI was out. That's what we do!

154
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:41,420
Yeah,but whenwe would finish arguing,

155
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,672
we would have this great sex.Now all we do is fight,

156
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:45,215
and there's no payoff,and it sucks!

157
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:47,968
You and I needto get laid!

158
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:51,388
Oh,don't judge me.

159
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:54,766
You're not in here becauseyou got caught helping the poor.

160
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:57,477
See,we'd be enjoyingthis argument more

161
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,979
if we had somethingto look forward to.

162
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:03,108
Fine. Get the damn lawyer.

163
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:06,904
And make it quick.

164
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,953
I take it that wasmy good night kiss.

165
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,872
George,you're a very special friend.

166
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:19,166
You are,but rexhasn't been dead four weeks,

167
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,792
so I think kissingon the lips is--

168
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:23,128
further thanyou want to go.

169
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,297
Exactly.I hope you don't mind.

170
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:31,470
Andrew,what are you doing?

171
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:32,721
Taking out the garbage.

172
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:36,141
Of course.You remember mr. Williams.

173
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:37,684
Hi,andrew.

174
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:39,478
George.

175
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:43,190
Uh,well,it's getting late,so...

176
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:46,652
yeah. So let me know if you wantto go out to dinner again soon.

177
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:48,862
There's a couple new restaurantsI'd like to try.

178
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,739
You know,we've been eating outa lot lately.

179
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:53,742
Why don't you come over fridayfor a home-cooked meal?

180
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:56,912
Wouldn't that be nice?Oh,I would love that.

181
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:02,584
So you leavingor what?

182
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:04,211
We're not donetalking.

183
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:05,587
She saidit was getting late.

184
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:07,506
In case you missed that,that was a hint.

185
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:08,924
Andrew...

186
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:10,884
that wasn't a hint.

187
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:14,221
I'll gowhen I'm ready.

188
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:21,562
Actually,it is getting late,and I am tired so...

189
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:22,938
see? You heard the lady.Now...

190
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:23,897
take off.

191
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:24,898
Andrew.

192
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,276
It's okay.He's not really that tough.

193
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,653
He knows I would neverhit a child.

194
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,738
Andrew!

195
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:33,615
George!

196
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:37,911
Stop it,the two of you,this instant!

197
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:41,331
This wasa perfectly lovely evening,

198
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:43,876
and now the both of youhave ruined it.

199
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,086
I will not toleratethis kind of behavior.

200
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:48,088
Do you understand?

201
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:54,344
All right,then.

202
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:58,432
George,we'll see you fridayfor dinner.

203
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:01,310
I'll be serving fish.

204
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:10,611
Hey,buddy.

205
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:14,531
Hey,wake up,sleepyhead.Parker.

206
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:16,033
Hi. Hiya,pal.

207
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,201
Hey,what do you say

208
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:19,745
you and me go getsome doughnuts,okay,

209
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,455
before mommyhas to go to work?

210
00:10:21,497 --> 00:10:24,500
Yeah? Come on.Come on. Come on. Come on.

211
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:28,045
All right. Oh.

212
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:32,799
So what do you thinkyou're gonna have,huh? Jelly?

213
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:35,886
'Cause I thinkI'm gonna have a bear claw.

214
00:10:35,928 --> 00:10:37,387
Stop!

215
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,182
I forgot mrs. Mulberry.

216
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:41,350
What?

217
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:46,230
Oh,um,well,since I'm here,

218
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:50,317
maybe she could just relaxin the house for awhile,okay?

219
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:52,903
No,I need her!

220
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,863
Okay.

221
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:00,661
Hello,mrs. Mulberry.

222
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:03,747
Don't forget to buckle up.

223
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:07,292
Here we go.

224
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:08,710
Wait!

225
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:10,838
You forgot her umbrella.

226
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:12,798
Well,parker,we don't have time.

227
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,258
No!

228
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:16,969
she needs it.

229
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:25,769
Hi.

230
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:27,145
Hey,what are youstill doing here?

231
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,147
I'm lookingfor parker's umbrella.

232
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:32,025
Have you seen it?No. Nope. Sorry.

233
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:33,318
Hey,honey,you better hurry.

234
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,529
You're gonna be late for work.

235
00:11:35,571 --> 00:11:37,614
Thank you for that.

236
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:48,625
I couldn't findmrs. Mulberry's umbrella,

237
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:51,253
so I brought herher sun hat instead,

238
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:52,379
all right?

239
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:54,965
And here we go.It's in the shower.

240
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:55,799
What?

241
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:59,303
Mrs. Mulberry saysshe left it in the shower.

242
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:03,682
Well,why didn'tmrs. 
Mulberryvolunteer that information

243
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:06,602
before I turned your roomupside down
looking for it,hmm?

244
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:07,769
Are you going to go get it?

245
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:11,148
No,I'm not gonna getthe damn umbrella!

246
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:17,863
I'm so sorry,sweetie.I am not mad at you.

247
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,990
What are you doing?

248
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:29,583
we don't want doughnuts.

249
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:45,015
Andrew,you are notleaving the house dressed like that.

250
00:12:45,057 --> 00:12:47,059
I'm just going to meetsome of the guys at the swim club.

251
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,312
I don't care.Put this on.

252
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,023
Every timeyou leave this house,

253
00:12:53,065 --> 00:12:54,149
you represent this family,

254
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:57,277
and the least you can dois not humiliate us.

255
00:12:57,319 --> 00:12:59,029
A ripped t-shirtis just a look.

256
00:12:59,071 --> 00:13:01,949
Yes,a bad one.

257
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:05,786
I hope you haven't made plansfor tomorrow night.

258
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:09,414
Look,if you thinkI'm having dinner
with the pharmacist,you're crazy.

259
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,041
Part of the reasonI'm having him over

260
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,584
is so that youcan get to know him.

261
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:15,212
Yeah,well,I don't wantto get to know him.

262
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:20,592
Honey,the feelingsthat you're having
are perfectly normal.

263
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:23,262
But george isn't tryingto take your father's place.

264
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:25,138
He's--well,he's just a friend.

265
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:27,599
Really? Just a friend?

266
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:29,184
So you're not planningon getting more serious

267
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:31,228
with this guyin the future?

268
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:34,731
You know,I haven't eventhought about it.

269
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:38,151
You're so transparent,it's pathetic.

270
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:41,905
You're worried abouta ripped t-shirt
humiliating this family?

271
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:44,408
Wait till people see thatyou're dating the town nerd

272
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:47,411
less than a month afteryour husband's funeral.

273
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:49,413
I'll be serving dinnertomorrow night at 7.

274
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:50,414
Please don't be late.

275
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:53,208
I'm sorry,but I already have plans.

276
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,961
Andrew,don't you havea meet at the swim club?

277
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:57,796
Yeah,so?

278
00:13:58,422 --> 00:14:01,675
Doesn't it requirea large entrance fee,

279
00:14:01,717 --> 00:14:05,470
one that you can't affordby yourself?

280
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:10,058
Are you blackmailing meinto coming to dinner?

281
00:14:10,142 --> 00:14:14,188
Oh,you don't knowthe lengths I'd go to for even seating.

282
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:21,778
Mayer,is this yours?

283
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,238
Blew into my front yard.

284
00:14:23,322 --> 00:14:26,366
Oh,sorry.I'm helping mike find zach.

285
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:29,244
You know,so we can allrest easy at night.

286
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:31,663
Uh-huh.And put him in jail?

287
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:35,250
I don't think mike
would do thatto his own son.

288
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,084
You know?

289
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:40,255
That mike's zach'sreal father? Yes.

290
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,841
Oh. Julie told karl,karl told me,

291
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:47,554
and I,well,sent outa few e-mails.

292
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:50,390
Well,thanksfor your discretion.

293
00:14:50,474 --> 00:14:54,686
Boy,you would do anything to get mike delfinoto love you.

294
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:57,147
So what's gonna happento little creepy when he gets here?

295
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:59,441
Are you gonna betucking him in at night?

296
00:14:59,483 --> 00:15:01,818
Making him breakfastin the morning?

297
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,072
Careful to bob and weave as hetries to blow your head off?

298
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:07,407
You know,edie,could you just back off?

299
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,952
I mean,the truth is,we're probably nevergonna find zach anyway.

300
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:11,620
It's a needle in a haystack.

301
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:13,831
Oh,I see.

302
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:18,377
And then you'll still come offas little miss perfect,self-sacrificing girlfriend,

303
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:22,214
putting his needs
ahead of yours.

304
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:27,261
Oh,why,you connivinglittle shrew.

305
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:32,099
I don't know whywe're not closer.

306
00:15:39,398 --> 00:15:42,067
There was a reason david bradley

307
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:46,405
was the most successful lawyer in all of fairview.

308
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:48,866
His arguments were persuasive...

309
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:51,159
no one ever has to know.

310
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,079
His manner was forceful...

311
00:15:54,163 --> 00:15:56,498
take it off.Take it off.

312
00:15:56,623 --> 00:16:00,085
And he tended to win on appeal.

313
00:16:00,252 --> 00:16:02,087
Please.

314
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:09,011
And when it came to the more challenging cases,

315
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,680
he knew it was to his advantage

316
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:14,224
to raise the first objection.

317
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:16,602
I'm not gonna takeyour case.

318
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:18,187
What?

319
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:18,854
yes.

320
00:16:18,854 --> 00:16:20,105
sorry to interrupt,mr. Bradley.

321
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:22,608
Your dinner just canceled.Want me to pull the reservation?

322
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:25,611
No,I still have to eat.I'm sorry,where were we?

323
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,946
You were about to turn me down,and then you reconsidered

324
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:30,908
once you realized I was gonnathrow a ton of money at you,

325
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:32,910
which I am.

326
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:38,165
Ah. It's not about the moneyfor me anymore,mrs. Solis.

327
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:40,459
The fact is,if I don't feelpassionately about a client,

328
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:42,127
if I don't feelthat fire in my belly,

329
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:43,295
I don't bringmy a-game to court,

330
00:16:43,295 --> 00:16:45,756
and from what I've read,it'll take my a-gameto save your husband.

331
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:47,382
Is this aboutthe gay bashing thing?

332
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:48,842
He's innocent.

333
00:16:48,884 --> 00:16:50,761
He went berserkand attacked a man in court.

334
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:52,429
Yeah,but that wasa jealousy thing.

335
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:54,431
The man that my husbandwas trying to kill in court

336
00:16:54,473 --> 00:16:58,227
is not the least bit gay,trust me.

337
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:02,397
Your file also saysyou're seeking conjugal visits.

338
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:04,816
Trying to keepthe old marriage alive,huh?

339
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:09,112
Why does everybodyhave a problem with me having sexwith my husband?

340
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:11,198
Can I be frank?

341
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:13,909
Only if it ends with megetting what I want.

342
00:17:13,951 --> 00:17:15,661
Your marriage is doomed.

343
00:17:15,661 --> 00:17:16,453
Excuse me?

344
00:17:16,495 --> 00:17:18,664
I've been doing thisfor a long time,mrs. Solis.

345
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:21,542
I know what incarcerationcan do to a relationship.

346
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,168
Marriage is hard enough,

347
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,295
but when you throw incement walls,

348
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:26,713
armed guards,iron bars,

349
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:31,677
it tends to go downhillrather quickly.

350
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:34,513
Conjugal visitsnotwithstanding.

351
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:34,972
But I--

352
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:37,266
listen,you want my advice?

353
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:39,268
Walk away.

354
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:41,979
You're young.

355
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:45,023
You made a mistake.You learn from it.

356
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:48,235
Maybe next timeyou'll marry smarter.

357
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:51,989
Now if you'll excuse me,I have dinner reservations.

358
00:17:52,573 --> 00:17:54,408
Reservation.

359
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:56,451
You're eating alone,remember?

360
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:59,538
And I have a feelingit's not the first time.

361
00:18:06,128 --> 00:18:08,463
I'm so sorryI couldn't get here sooner.

362
00:18:08,547 --> 00:18:11,258
I forgot my husbandhad to take our youngest

363
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:12,509
to the pediatricianand...

364
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:14,803
it's all right,mrs. Scavo.

365
00:18:15,304 --> 00:18:17,931
So...what did parker do?

366
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:21,935
Are you aware that your sonhas an imaginary friend,

367
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:23,270
a mrs. Mulberry?

368
00:18:23,312 --> 00:18:25,689
Yes. We've met.

369
00:18:25,731 --> 00:18:29,651
Well,um,yesterday,
parker demanded that

370
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:33,780
mrs. Mulberry get her own easelduring art,which was fine.

371
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,157
But today it was a desk.

372
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:38,744
And unfortunately,we didn't have an extra desk.

373
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:42,331
That must have been ugly.

374
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:43,916
It was.

375
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:48,712
Patty was rammed
with this.

376
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:52,925
Oh. I am so sorry.

377
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:55,093
Mrs. Scavo,

378
00:18:55,219 --> 00:18:58,388
have you experienceda death in your family recently?

379
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,098
No. No. Why?

380
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,143
Imaginary friends are oftencreated as a coping mechanism

381
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:05,187
to--to deal with loss.

382
00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:05,771
Uh-huh.

383
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:10,817
Or it might occur as the resultof some major change
or extensive alterationin their lives.

384
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:11,527
Exactly.

385
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:14,780
A manifestation ofsome deep-seated unhappiness.

386
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:15,864
Can you think of anything

387
00:19:15,906 --> 00:19:21,286
that might sheda little bit of light
on this for us?

388
00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:27,209
Mrs. Scavo?

389
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:37,636
thank you.

390
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:45,811
And I'm thinking,it's the golden gate bridge.

391
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:48,355
What a great place to geta picture of the sunset.

392
00:19:48,397 --> 00:19:51,149
So I lean out way over the rail to get the shot.

393
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:53,485
Next thing I know,the police arrive.

394
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:56,071
People had called 9-1-1from their cell phones.

395
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:58,115
Thought I was suicidal.

396
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:09,251
I can't believe how wellthose two are getting along.

397
00:20:09,293 --> 00:20:10,669
Yeah,it's freaky.

398
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:14,756
Andrew is beingpolite and engaging.

399
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:17,426
He's even laughingat george's jokes.

400
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:18,427
That's whyit's freaky.

401
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:20,429
George's jokesaren't funny.

402
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:24,975
so,george,can I ask you a question?

403
00:20:25,017 --> 00:20:26,185
And it's kind of personal.

404
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:27,603
Sure.

405
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:31,732
Have you ever actuallybeen with a woman?

406
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:33,692
Excuse me?

407
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:37,321
Well,let's be honest.I think it's obvious

408
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:38,739
by the waythat you talk and act

409
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,823
that you're not a player,

410
00:20:39,907 --> 00:20:40,991
so I was just curiousto find out

411
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:43,785
if you had ever actuallygotten in the game.

412
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:46,747
My experience with womenis none of your business.

413
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:47,873
Oh,I think it is.

414
00:20:47,915 --> 00:20:49,458
I mean,you're dating my mom.

415
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,168
And we both knowthat at your age,

416
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:55,130
dating's a little morethan just holding hands.

417
00:20:55,339 --> 00:20:57,758
We're not dating exactly.

418
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:58,467
Oh,sure you are.

419
00:20:58,467 --> 00:21:00,177
And you know what?I think it's great.

420
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:02,262
But I wanna make suremy mom's happy,

421
00:21:02,346 --> 00:21:04,264
you know,and it wouldreally set my mind at ease

422
00:21:04,348 --> 00:21:07,726
to know that she's with a guythat knows how to please a lady.

423
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:09,603
This is inappropriate.

424
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:13,607
You know,my parentshad a great sex life.

425
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:17,653
Man,I heard 'em throughthe wall of my bedroom once.

426
00:21:17,736 --> 00:21:19,196
Please shut up.

427
00:21:19,238 --> 00:21:20,447
You should've heardmy mom,too.

428
00:21:20,489 --> 00:21:22,616
She had this--this weird moan.

429
00:21:22,658 --> 00:21:28,747
It was kind of like,um... mmm.

430
00:21:29,414 --> 00:21:30,874
Isn't that bizarre?

431
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:34,461
That's the soundmy mom makes
when she climaxes.

432
00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:38,715
Okay. Time for cobbler.

433
00:21:38,757 --> 00:21:41,385
Sorry,one of the dessert platesdoesn't match.

434
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:44,388
I tried to replace it,but it's spode florence.

435
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:45,889
It's a rare pattern.

436
00:21:45,931 --> 00:21:47,015
It belongedto my grandmother.

437
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:48,642
But hopefully onceyou taste the dessert,

438
00:21:48,684 --> 00:21:50,853
you'll forget all about it.

439
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:52,229
I'm not hungry.

440
00:21:52,271 --> 00:21:56,525
George,you have to have this.It's absolutely scrumptious.

441
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:05,617
(Mouths words)

442
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:08,287
go to your room!

443
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:08,871
George!

444
00:22:08,954 --> 00:22:12,374
You heard me.Go to your room.

445
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,877
Mr. Williams,what's wrong?

446
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:17,337
Did I say something wrong?

447
00:22:17,421 --> 00:22:20,048
Bree,please back me up.

448
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:22,384
Well,what did he say?

449
00:22:22,426 --> 00:22:26,513
I can't say. It's too sordid.But he said it!

450
00:22:27,181 --> 00:22:28,682
Are you gonnaback me up or what?

451
00:22:28,724 --> 00:22:30,934
George,I can't allow youto discipline my child

452
00:22:30,976 --> 00:22:34,229
if you won't even tell mewhat he did.

453
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:39,860
George.

454
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:42,029
George!

455
00:22:52,998 --> 00:22:55,167
mrs. Solis,david bradley.

456
00:22:55,501 --> 00:22:58,295
Look,I feel really bad about the tone of our meeting,

457
00:22:58,295 --> 00:23:00,464
so to make up for it,I'm gonna do you a favor.

458
00:23:00,506 --> 00:23:01,215
The more I think of it,

459
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:03,967
the more I'm convinced your marriage is a train wreck--

460
00:23:04,051 --> 00:23:07,054
the gnarly type,you know,mass casualties.

461
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:08,680
Anyway,I'm passing on the name

462
00:23:08,722 --> 00:23:11,141
of a great divorce lawyer,kir--

463
00:23:15,854 --> 00:23:16,980
you have some nerve,

464
00:23:17,022 --> 00:23:19,024
leaving that messageon my machine.

465
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:21,109
You realize this isentirely inappropriate?

466
00:23:21,151 --> 00:23:22,903
I will tell youwhat is inappropriate.

467
00:23:22,945 --> 00:23:26,365
You making sweeping assumptions about the state of my marriage.

468
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:27,491
Care for a drink?

469
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:28,784
No!

470
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:31,954
I like to keep a clear headwhen I'm telling people off.

471
00:23:31,995 --> 00:23:35,541
What makes you think you knowanything about me or my husband?

472
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:37,709
Well,your husband's recordspeaks for itself.

473
00:23:37,751 --> 00:23:40,379
With you,I had to relyon my instincts.

474
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,173
Would those bethe same instincts
that picked outthat cologne?

475
00:23:43,215 --> 00:23:46,677
You're privileged.You're pampered.

476
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:47,845
You're spoiled.

477
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:50,138
You want what you wantwhen you want it.

478
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,974
You want excitement.

479
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:53,934
A quickie every five monthsin a prison trailer

480
00:23:53,976 --> 00:23:56,436
isn't gonna scratchthat itch.

481
00:23:56,562 --> 00:23:58,689
With all due respect,I will decide for myself

482
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,858
what needs to be scratchedand when.

483
00:24:00,941 --> 00:24:04,027
Mrs. Solis,you are a beautiful,

484
00:24:04,278 --> 00:24:06,530
desirable woman.

485
00:24:06,572 --> 00:24:08,490
Now your husbandis a dimwit,

486
00:24:08,574 --> 00:24:10,159
corrupt,violent criminal.

487
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,787
You could do...so much better.

488
00:24:13,871 --> 00:24:15,873
Are you hitting on me?

489
00:24:15,914 --> 00:24:17,541
What would you sayif I were?

490
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:20,544
I'd say I'm pregnant.

491
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:29,178
So I see,you're stuck.

492
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:30,929
I'm not stuck,mr. Bradley.

493
00:24:31,013 --> 00:24:34,183
Believe it or not,I love my husband.

494
00:24:35,434 --> 00:24:37,978
I charge $700 an hour,

495
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,104
plus xeroxing.

496
00:24:39,146 --> 00:24:39,813
I'll pay you 6,

497
00:24:39,855 --> 00:24:42,900
and I expect a conjugal visittomorrow by noon.

498
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:45,068
Aren't you demanding?

499
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,403
Like you said...

500
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:49,907
I want what I wantwhen I want it.

501
00:24:52,576 --> 00:24:54,328
So a womanI talked to at social services

502
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:57,414
said a lot of runawayshang out here.

503
00:24:57,998 --> 00:24:59,374
What?

504
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:01,376
Just happy to bespending the day with you.

505
00:25:02,294 --> 00:25:05,923
At homeless sheltersand bus stations?

506
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:09,301
I'm gonna go ask these guysif they've seen zach.

507
00:25:09,343 --> 00:25:11,845
I think we'll covermore ground if we split up.

508
00:25:11,929 --> 00:25:13,388
Okay.

509
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:21,438
Thanks.

510
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:28,153
Have you seen this boy?

511
00:25:28,445 --> 00:25:30,906
Uh,missing kid. Anyone?

512
00:25:30,948 --> 00:25:32,199
Going once...

513
00:25:32,366 --> 00:25:34,159
going twice?

514
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,750
Oh,do you mind keeping those

515
00:25:41,792 --> 00:25:45,295
and passing them outwhen people get their ice cream?

516
00:25:47,005 --> 00:25:47,840
What?

517
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:51,009
Well,isn't that him,over there?

518
00:25:53,762 --> 00:25:56,473
Zach! Zach!

519
00:25:56,557 --> 00:25:57,891
Oh,no,no,no,no.

520
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,395
Don't,don't,don't,don'T.Zach!

521
00:26:01,436 --> 00:26:04,022
Don't,don'T.Zach,don't run away!

522
00:26:04,106 --> 00:26:06,108
Wait! Come on!

523
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:08,819
Just--would youget back here?!

524
00:26:08,861 --> 00:26:12,114
Come on,really!Let's just talk!

525
00:26:12,948 --> 00:26:14,992
Damn it,zach!

526
00:26:15,284 --> 00:26:16,910
It's enough already.

527
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:28,505
nobody herehas seen zach.

528
00:26:28,547 --> 00:26:32,342
But there's a halfway house
on the westsideI want to check... out.

529
00:26:33,886 --> 00:26:35,971
Are you okay?

530
00:26:39,308 --> 00:26:41,894
I got you some ice cream.

531
00:26:41,935 --> 00:26:42,978
You did?

532
00:26:43,145 --> 00:26:46,481
But then I got hungry.

533
00:26:48,025 --> 00:26:51,570
So then I just threwmy ice cream at him and ran.

534
00:26:55,032 --> 00:26:56,783
Well,somebody say something.

535
00:26:56,825 --> 00:26:58,494
Thank godyou were in flats.

536
00:26:58,535 --> 00:27:02,414
I'm still recovering frommike is zach's real father.

537
00:27:03,123 --> 00:27:05,167
I should've told mikeI saw zach.

538
00:27:05,209 --> 00:27:06,835
I'm a horrible person,right?

539
00:27:06,877 --> 00:27:08,253
Oh,susan,come on.

540
00:27:08,295 --> 00:27:11,381
Zach attacked felicia.He blew up your kitchen.

541
00:27:11,423 --> 00:27:12,925
Evidently,he tried to kill mike.

542
00:27:13,008 --> 00:27:16,678
I think we can all agreethis kid's a freak.

543
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:23,018
What do you think,bree?

544
00:27:23,769 --> 00:27:26,313
Well,I think given everythingthat's happened,

545
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:30,817
it's perfectly justified thatyou'd be frightened of zach.

546
00:27:31,068 --> 00:27:32,945
But...

547
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,407
but zachis mary alice's son.

548
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:39,618
He grew up playingin our yards.

549
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,745
If he has any hopeof surviving,

550
00:27:41,829 --> 00:27:45,958
I have to believe he's betteroff here than on the streets.

551
00:27:52,256 --> 00:27:53,131
I couldn't have imagined

552
00:27:53,173 --> 00:27:55,592
how much going back to workwould upset parker.

553
00:27:55,634 --> 00:27:59,513
Look,he's going to be fine.He's just gotta get used

554
00:27:59,555 --> 00:28:02,266
to daddy providingall the love.

555
00:28:02,307 --> 00:28:03,684
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

556
00:28:03,725 --> 00:28:04,935
I am kidding.

557
00:28:04,977 --> 00:28:07,437
Look,kids are resilient.He will adapt.

558
00:28:07,437 --> 00:28:09,606
Tom,he attacked a teacherwith an umbrella.

559
00:28:09,648 --> 00:28:11,400
It was a poke.He poked her.

560
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:12,568
I don't know.

561
00:28:12,609 --> 00:28:14,736
Maybe I shouldn'tbe working.

562
00:28:14,778 --> 00:28:17,781
The kids wouldcertainly benefit
from havingtwo stay-at-home parents,

563
00:28:17,865 --> 00:28:20,284
although buying foodmight become an issue.

564
00:28:20,325 --> 00:28:22,035
Maybe I could changemy work schedule,

565
00:28:22,077 --> 00:28:23,871
try and get some flex time.

566
00:28:23,954 --> 00:28:25,164
Would nina go for that?

567
00:28:25,205 --> 00:28:28,542
No. No.

568
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:29,793
No,no,no!

569
00:28:29,835 --> 00:28:31,461
No,no,no!

570
00:28:32,254 --> 00:28:35,799
It would help if youcame up with some ideas.

571
00:28:36,133 --> 00:28:37,301
How about hugs?

572
00:28:37,342 --> 00:28:37,885
Hugs?

573
00:28:37,968 --> 00:28:39,386
Yeah,I read inone of those family magazines

574
00:28:39,469 --> 00:28:41,638
the kids are supposedto get,like,ten hugs a day.

575
00:28:41,638 --> 00:28:43,348
It makes 'em feelmore secure.

576
00:28:43,348 --> 00:28:45,392
I say pile on the hugs.

577
00:28:45,434 --> 00:28:47,060
That'll fix everything?Hugs?

578
00:28:47,102 --> 00:28:50,981
Yeah. Come here.

579
00:28:52,524 --> 00:28:54,776
come here.

580
00:28:55,194 --> 00:28:56,695
Hey.

581
00:28:57,654 --> 00:28:59,531
Hi.

582
00:29:01,158 --> 00:29:02,493
It's working,isn't it?

583
00:29:02,534 --> 00:29:04,286
Shut up.

584
00:29:14,129 --> 00:29:17,090
Hey,buddy,you busy?

585
00:29:17,174 --> 00:29:19,968
Yes. Mrs. Mulberry'sreading to me.

586
00:29:20,052 --> 00:29:21,512
Well,isn't she nice?

587
00:29:21,553 --> 00:29:25,182
But it's time for bed,so I'mgonna tuck you in,okay?

588
00:29:25,224 --> 00:29:26,350
I'll take that.

589
00:29:26,391 --> 00:29:27,976
No!

590
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:38,278
I know thingshave been hard for you

591
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,780
since I started backto work,

592
00:29:39,822 --> 00:29:43,116
but it is just as hard for meto be away from you.

593
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:48,497
And you just haveto remember
that even whenI'm not around,

594
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:51,166
my love for you is real.

595
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:53,669
You may not be ableto see it,

596
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:56,296
but it's not imaginarylike mrs. Mulberry.

597
00:29:56,338 --> 00:29:58,882
It's real.

598
00:30:00,342 --> 00:30:02,052
Okay,honey?

599
00:30:02,094 --> 00:30:04,304
Mrs. Mulberry is real,

600
00:30:04,346 --> 00:30:06,849
and she said you're a liar.

601
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,892
Parker.

602
00:30:14,106 --> 00:30:14,815
Parker.

603
00:30:14,857 --> 00:30:17,359
We're reading.

604
00:30:27,953 --> 00:30:30,038
I don't understand.

605
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,748
Why can't we see each otheranymore?

606
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:35,127
Because ever since I found outwhat andrew said to you,

607
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:36,795
I've been doingsome soul searching,

608
00:30:36,879 --> 00:30:40,757
and I realize thateverything's that happened
is completely my fault.

609
00:30:40,841 --> 00:30:41,425
No,no,no,

610
00:30:41,466 --> 00:30:43,760
that's ridiculous.No,it's not.

611
00:30:43,802 --> 00:30:47,347
All the thingsthat andrew's been saying
and the wayhe's been acting,

612
00:30:47,347 --> 00:30:49,183
it's all connectedto his father's death.

613
00:30:49,224 --> 00:30:50,100
And it's clear to me

614
00:30:50,142 --> 00:30:54,396
that I need to spend more timefocusing on him and his needs.

615
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:56,190
You know...

616
00:30:56,273 --> 00:30:59,776
you're right. You do needto focus on andrew.

617
00:30:59,818 --> 00:31:02,654
Thank you,george,for being so understanding.

618
00:31:02,696 --> 00:31:04,406
Of course.

619
00:31:07,701 --> 00:31:10,996
So have you thoughtabout counseling?

620
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:13,040
That placeyou sent him to--

621
00:31:13,081 --> 00:31:14,458
that behavioralmodification camp--

622
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,876
he got counseling there,right?

623
00:31:15,918 --> 00:31:17,920
But I only sent him there

624
00:31:17,961 --> 00:31:21,507
because his behavior at the timewas so completely out of bounds.

625
00:31:21,548 --> 00:31:25,844
You don't think that whathe said to me was out of bounds?

626
00:31:25,886 --> 00:31:29,056
I just think if I spenta lot of time with him,

627
00:31:29,097 --> 00:31:30,265
it'll really help.Why not do both?

628
00:31:30,307 --> 00:31:32,392
Let him spend a few monthswith some caring professionals,

629
00:31:32,434 --> 00:31:33,268
and then bring him home.

630
00:31:33,268 --> 00:31:35,646
You know,what he saidto you was horribly rude,

631
00:31:35,729 --> 00:31:38,524
but that camp,it's extreme,

632
00:31:38,565 --> 00:31:41,902
and,I mean,unless I feltlike andrew was getting

633
00:31:41,944 --> 00:31:44,863
really out of control,then...

634
00:31:46,281 --> 00:31:50,077
well,let's hopeit doesn't come to that.

635
00:31:51,036 --> 00:31:53,080
You know,in spite ofeverything that's happened,

636
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:55,374
I really like andrew.

637
00:31:55,791 --> 00:31:57,167
Oh,george,really?

638
00:31:57,209 --> 00:32:00,420
Yeah. The truth is...

639
00:32:00,546 --> 00:32:03,048
he reminds me of me.

640
00:32:04,591 --> 00:32:06,969
The conjugal visit rules areyou got 45 minutes.

641
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:09,555
We call every 15 minutesto make sure you're still here.

642
00:32:09,596 --> 00:32:10,472
You understand?

643
00:32:10,514 --> 00:32:11,640
Yes,we got it.

644
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,184
Uh,we interrupt our lovemakingto answer the phone,

645
00:32:14,184 --> 00:32:16,979
or you call out the dogs.Okay!

646
00:32:17,062 --> 00:32:19,690
I'm ready whenever you...

647
00:32:19,815 --> 00:32:21,900
obviously are.

648
00:32:31,827 --> 00:32:34,705
Carlos,are we gonna make it?

649
00:32:34,955 --> 00:32:39,459
We just did.You want to go again?

650
00:32:40,294 --> 00:32:43,172
No,I'm talkingabout us--

651
00:32:43,213 --> 00:32:45,841
our relationship,our marriage.

652
00:32:46,758 --> 00:32:49,720
Carlos,you're goingto be a father.

653
00:32:49,761 --> 00:32:52,097
And when you get outta here,you're gonna need to get a job

654
00:32:52,139 --> 00:32:55,726
and make an honest livingfor me and our child.

655
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:58,645
Babe,I've learned my lesson.

656
00:32:58,729 --> 00:33:01,732
Okay,when I get out of here,everything's gonna be different.

657
00:33:01,773 --> 00:33:05,319
We're going to start over witha new life and a great family,

658
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,615
and nothing is going toget in the way of that.

659
00:33:14,953 --> 00:33:17,206
Hey,so you never told me--

660
00:33:17,414 --> 00:33:20,417
how's the new lawyer?You like him?

661
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:28,175
yeah.

662
00:33:28,383 --> 00:33:30,969
Yeah,I'm still here.

663
00:33:33,722 --> 00:33:38,185
Okay,enough chitchat.We only have 30 minutes left,

664
00:33:38,227 --> 00:33:41,104
and I want to makethe most of it.

665
00:33:55,202 --> 00:33:57,162
Okay,please--please don't run.

666
00:33:57,204 --> 00:33:59,289
I can'T. I hurt my foot.

667
00:33:59,331 --> 00:34:00,707
How?

668
00:34:00,749 --> 00:34:04,419
I landed on it funny whenI was running away from you.

669
00:34:05,879 --> 00:34:06,922
What do you want?

670
00:34:07,005 --> 00:34:08,549
To talk to you.

671
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:09,550
Why?

672
00:34:09,591 --> 00:34:11,552
'Cause I havea lot of things to say.

673
00:34:11,593 --> 00:34:14,888
So you can just listen.I'll buy you some food.

674
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:18,100
When was the last timeyou ate?

675
00:34:23,981 --> 00:34:26,859
My dad's alive?Where is he?

676
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,111
I don't know.He disappeared.

677
00:34:29,153 --> 00:34:31,905
But mike did not kill him.I mean,he's alive,you swear?

678
00:34:31,947 --> 00:34:34,741
I swear.Maybe he's in utah.

679
00:34:34,783 --> 00:34:37,619
I know that he used tohave a life there--

680
00:34:37,661 --> 00:34:39,329
before me.

681
00:34:39,413 --> 00:34:40,497
I don't know.I just--I just--

682
00:34:40,539 --> 00:34:42,708
I need to get some moneyand find him.

683
00:34:42,749 --> 00:34:44,877
Zach,you know what I think?

684
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:47,296
I think you should come back with me.Why?

685
00:34:47,337 --> 00:34:49,590
Because there are still peopleat home that care about you.

686
00:34:49,631 --> 00:34:52,885
And there's thingsthat you need to know.

687
00:34:52,968 --> 00:34:54,887
Like what?

688
00:34:56,013 --> 00:34:57,431
Well,I can't tell you.

689
00:34:57,472 --> 00:34:59,558
You know,you messed upa lot of people's lives,zach.

690
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,768
You can't run awayfrom that.

691
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:03,854
Do you mean julie?

692
00:35:04,271 --> 00:35:05,898
What?

693
00:35:07,524 --> 00:35:09,568
I know that I messed upher life,

694
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:12,905
but I didn't mean to.

695
00:35:12,988 --> 00:35:15,824
I really miss herout here.

696
00:35:15,908 --> 00:35:18,243
I think about herall the time.

697
00:35:18,243 --> 00:35:20,162
Yeah,well,julie'sa really special girl.

698
00:35:20,204 --> 00:35:22,664
Has she said anythingabout me?

699
00:35:22,748 --> 00:35:26,919
Because if she has,then I mightstill have a chance with her.

700
00:35:27,586 --> 00:35:28,378
If I come backwith you,

701
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:31,715
then I-I couldmake it up to her.

702
00:35:34,092 --> 00:35:36,637
Do you know what I think?

703
00:35:38,013 --> 00:35:40,390
I think you were right.

704
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:43,936
I think you shouldtry to find your father first.

705
00:35:43,977 --> 00:35:46,021
Yeah?Yeah.

706
00:35:47,481 --> 00:35:49,942
I mean,now that you know he's okay,

707
00:35:49,983 --> 00:35:52,236
you should go to him.

708
00:35:52,277 --> 00:35:54,738
He'll want totake care of you.

709
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:57,908
That's what parents do.

710
00:36:00,828 --> 00:36:03,080
Let me help.

711
00:36:03,914 --> 00:36:08,085
How much money do you thinkyou'll need to get to utah?

712
00:37:00,429 --> 00:37:03,724
Daddy,I can't findmrs. Mulberry's umbrella.

713
00:37:03,765 --> 00:37:04,558
Where is it?

714
00:37:04,558 --> 00:37:07,227
Oh,I don't know,sport. Honey,have you seen the umbrella?

715
00:37:07,269 --> 00:37:10,397
No,can't say that I have.

716
00:37:10,439 --> 00:37:12,149
Okay,listen,don't worry about it.

717
00:37:12,191 --> 00:37:14,443
I'm sure mrs. Mulberry'saround here somewhere.

718
00:37:14,526 --> 00:37:18,155
Or,uh,maybe she's not.

719
00:37:19,072 --> 00:37:23,410
She could've left.You know...

720
00:37:23,577 --> 00:37:26,914
maybe she had someother little boy
that she needed to help.

721
00:37:26,955 --> 00:37:27,664
Like who?

722
00:37:27,706 --> 00:37:31,210
I don't know. It could bea little boy in,uh...

723
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:32,252
england...

724
00:37:33,045 --> 00:37:35,923
named... spencer.

725
00:37:37,174 --> 00:37:37,799
Lynette?

726
00:37:37,841 --> 00:37:40,469
I mean,this isconjecture on my part.

727
00:37:40,511 --> 00:37:45,516
But it is possible thatsomeone like little spencer

728
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:50,479
needs mrs. Mulberry more,'cause he doesn't have a daddy

729
00:37:50,562 --> 00:37:52,898
and a mommy who love him.

730
00:37:52,981 --> 00:37:54,399
Yeah,that's it.

731
00:37:54,441 --> 00:37:56,777
He's an orphan...

732
00:37:57,277 --> 00:38:00,155
with no hands.

733
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:02,241
Okay?

734
00:38:02,449 --> 00:38:05,536
You're so sweet. Come here.I love you. You all right?

735
00:38:05,577 --> 00:38:07,746
Okay,go get dressed.

736
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:11,583
What have you doneto mrs. Mulberry?

737
00:38:11,667 --> 00:38:15,546
Until there's a body,there's no evidence of a crime.

738
00:38:18,799 --> 00:38:20,342
Mrs. Mulberry!

739
00:38:20,384 --> 00:38:22,427
She's back!

740
00:38:24,179 --> 00:38:24,805
Goodie.

741
00:38:24,847 --> 00:38:27,140
Mrs. Mulberry's back!

742
00:38:41,905 --> 00:38:44,199
She got ran over.She's dead.

743
00:38:44,241 --> 00:38:46,201

00:39:16,231 --> 00:39:18,150

I thought about what you said,and you're right.

750
00:39:24,323 --> 00:39:26,200
Andrew needs his space.

751
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,076
Well,thank you,george.

752
00:39:28,118 --> 00:39:30,787

754
00:39:32,498 --> 00:39:34,833

757
00:39:47,346 --> 00:39:49,306
It's my pattern!Where did you find it?

758
00:39:49,348 --> 00:39:52,017
I got luckyon an online auction.

759
00:39:55,437 --> 00:39:57,940
I love it! Thank you! Oh!

760
00:39:59,107 --> 00:40:00,400

761
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,907
Oh,george!

762
00:40:07,032 --> 00:40:08,325
George.

763
00:40:08,408 --> 00:40:10,160
George.

764
00:40:15,916 --> 00:40:17,668
Andrew,what are you doing?!

765
00:40:20,254 --> 00:40:21,588
Andrew!

766
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,966
Get off of him,andrew!

767
00:40:26,552 --> 00:40:28,303
Stop it!

768
00:40:28,345 --> 00:40:30,180
Knock it off!

769
00:40:30,764 --> 00:40:33,308
Did you see him?!He was kissing her!

770
00:40:33,308 --> 00:40:35,853
Oh,my god,you're bleeding.

771
00:40:35,894 --> 00:40:36,979
That freak was kissing her!

772
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:40,440
I don't care.You gotta calm down now.

773
00:40:53,162 --> 00:40:56,707
The world is filled with good fathers.

774
00:40:56,748 --> 00:40:59,293
How do we recognize them?

775
00:40:59,376 --> 00:41:03,088
They're the ones who are missed so terribly

776
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:07,467
that everything falls apart in their absence.

777
00:41:10,762 --> 00:41:13,557
They're the ones who love us

778
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:17,436
long before we've even arrived.

779
00:41:18,812 --> 00:41:23,275
They're the ones who come looking for us

780
00:41:23,317 --> 00:41:27,112
when we can't find our way home.

781
00:41:32,951 --> 00:41:35,621
hey,what's wrong?

782
00:41:37,122 --> 00:41:43,462
Because of me,
my son's imaginary friendgot crushed by a garbage truck.

783
00:41:47,674 --> 00:41:51,428
I am the worst personin the world.

784
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:55,516
Yes,the world is filled with good fathers...

785
00:41:55,516 --> 00:42:00,604
honey,he is going to getover this in no time. Trust me.

786
00:42:00,646 --> 00:42:03,398
And one daywhen he is all grown up,

787
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,444
you and parker are going tolaugh hysterically about this.

788
00:42:07,486 --> 00:42:09,696
You really think so?Really?

789
00:42:09,738 --> 00:42:11,156
And the best

790
00:42:11,198 --> 00:42:14,743
are the ones who make the women in their lives...

791
00:42:14,785 --> 00:42:16,870
I promise.

792
00:42:16,954 --> 00:42:20,958
Feel like good mothers.
