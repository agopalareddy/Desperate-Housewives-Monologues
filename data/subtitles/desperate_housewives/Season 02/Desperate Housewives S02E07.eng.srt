<i>Gabrielle got pregnant.</i></i>

5
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:08,509
You walked out on me.

6
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:11,595
Yeah. But look how far I got.

7
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:12,721
I'm just up the street.

00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,183
Being with George made you feel a bit guilty.

10
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:18,268
Well, I just have to get over it, won't I?

11
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:19,978

Call 911 and tell them you got the killer locked up in the basement!

15
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:28,195
He is not a killer.

<i>...got what they deserved.</i></i>

17
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:39,665
<i>It is often said that Necessity is the mother of Invention.</i></i>

18
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:43,877
<i>This is how mothers came to invent play dates,</i></i>

19
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:47,589
<i>so occasionally they could have a little time for themselves.</i></i>

20
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:49,466
If you need me, I'll be at the salon.

21

<i>who was no longer able to rest on weekends</i></i>

25

<i>because her twins no longer received play date invitations</i></i>

26
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:07,985
<i>ever since they had convinced Sasha Eden's boy</i></i>

27
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:12,990
<i>that a pair of magic wings would allow him to fly;</i></i>

28
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:17,369

<i>"Toss The Brick".</i></i>

32

<i>The Scavo twins had become personae non gratae,</i></i>

Hey, hey! Porter, Preston, knock it off!

37
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:49,568
Did you hear me? I said, stop it!

38
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:52,279
Stand up!

39
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,697
Come here!

40
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:56,366
I'm so sorry. Did my son beat you up?

41
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,785
No, we were beating them up.

42
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,495
Is that true? Did they beat you up?

43
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,581
Nah, it didn't hurt that much.

44
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:05,792
Jimmy? PJ? What are you doing?

45
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,587
What have I told you about ganging up on people?

46
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:09,713
I am so sorry.

47
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:11,048
I don't -- it's OK.

48
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:13,592
Believe me, my boys can take care of themselves.

49
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:16,261
If they got hurt at all, I'll pay for the doctor bills.

50
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,054
No, don't worry.

51
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:22,100
I got the feeling they were sort of enjoying themselves.

52
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:27,856
Really?

53
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,983
What would you say to bringing your boys over to my house

54
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,903
and letting them hang out with mine some time?

55
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:36,698

00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:43,789
<i>And play dates for her kids.</i></i>

58

I'm sorry, but

59
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:48,585
my boys decided to have a rock fight with your boys.

60
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,046
It was fun!

62
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:54,675

<i>Images that tell us more about ourselves than we realize.</i></i>

70
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:21,326

How am I supposed to eat with a uterus staring me in the face?

00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:41,305
Oh Gabby, I didn't know you got a sonogram. Let me see it.

77
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:44,099
Honey, you need to put that in a frame or something.

78
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,309
I don't think so.

79
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:47,769
Oh come on, that's a picture of your baby!

80
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,105
You can't tell me you're not a little bit excited.

81
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:50,647
Fine.

82
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,317
"I'm pregnant! Weee!"

83
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:54,902
Now, come on.

84
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:56,653
We're supposed to be cheering up Susan.

85
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:57,696
This is a time of crisis,

86
00:03:57,696 --> 00:04:00,991
and I think you need another scoop of mint-chocolate chip.

87
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:01,700
Thanks.

88
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,370
Susan, why are you so eerily calm?

89
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,997
Mike Delfino just dumped you.

90
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:11,001
The Susan Meyer I know would be a blubbering mess right now.

91
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,879
Come on, thrush her on out. She's fun to watch.

92
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:17,174
Actually, I think I'm starting to feel pretty Zen about the whole thing.

93
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:20,511
I think Mike will calm down in a couple of days and come to his senses.

94
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:20,969
No.

95
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,388
I came between the man and his son.

96
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,806
That was a huge betrayal.

97
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,392
I can't even blame him for hating me.

98
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,770
But Zach was starting to obsess with Julie again.

99
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,604
Exactly.

100
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:34,566
You're a mother trying to protect her child. It's a natural impulse.

101
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:38,779
Over the past couple of days, I gave myself a long hard look in the mirror,

102
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:41,073
and I did not like what I saw.

103
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:42,366
I'm with you.

104
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:43,450
Carry on.

105
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,787
I just think if I start acting like an adult for once,

106
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:51,792
maybe somewhere down the line, Mike and I at least can be friends.

107
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:54,670
All right, you're not Zen.

108
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,796
You're numb.

109
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:59,049
I'm fine!

110
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:00,592
D'you got any pie?

111
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:03,470
Not unless we make some.

112
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:08,517
I can wait.

113
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:15,691
So if you need us, we'll be at home, having a quiet evening.

114
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:20,487
Funny, we're expecting quite the opposite.

115
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,114
Well, don't forget, next week it's our turn.

116
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:23,323
We'll be taking Porter and...

117
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,992
Preston.
- ...Preston off your hands all weekend.

118
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:27,995
Rest assured, we have not forgotten it.

119
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,371
See ya!

120
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:34,376
Bye!
- Don't worry!

121
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:35,586
Whoa, guys!

122
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:37,588
Why aren't you upstairs with PJ and Jimmy?

123
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:39,798
They're watching this dumb video they brought.

124
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:40,924
It's boring.

125
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:45,846
Well, you should be polite and watch it too. They're your guests.

126
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:50,767
Guys!

127
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,854
Hey guys! We got snacks!

128
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:57,065
I'll just reconnect the works. Good to go?

129
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:59,067
OK, ready?
- OK.

130
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,320
Hang on now, just a moment. I'm just getting up.

131
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,071
Guys, what is this?

132
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:06,575
A movie.
- Mommy and Daddy made it.

133
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:08,493
Peek, peekaboo...
- Wow, what's under there?

134
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,495
Peekaboo...

135
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:11,788
Peekaboo!

136
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:15,167
Oh my God! Where's the off button?

137
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:16,668
It's underneath the panel thing!

138
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:20,380
It's stuck! Get the remote!
- Peekaboo!

139
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,510
What's wrong?

140
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:29,473
I found it!

141
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:36,396
So can we have the cocoa now?

142
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:42,903
Well, what do you think?

143
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,447
It is glorious. I have to have it.

144
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:47,699
How much do you deserve Dolce & Gabbana?

145
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,576
Verne...
- You never call. You never write.

146
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,286
I know I haven't been in the store lately.

147
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:53,705
But I've been a little busy, getting my husband out of jail.

148
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,791
That's such a white trash thing to say.

149
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,252
Luckily the judge dropped the hate crime charge.

150
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:02,089
Now all Carlos has to do is serve out the slave labor thing.

151
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:03,590
He'll be out in six months.

152
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,093
If he's still in the hoosegow, why do you need a fancy party dress?

153
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:09,847
Because some of my model friends are coming down from New York on Friday.

154
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:11,306
So I have to look better than ever.

155
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:14,893
I can't have them thinking that I moved to this suburb and I shop at strip malls.

156
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:18,647
When they see this dress, they will crumple to the floor like the botoxed hags they are.

157
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:20,649
Good.

158
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:22,901
You know, it's a little snug.

159
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,194
Yeah, I see that.

160
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:27,406
I have the same thing in a 0, why not go up a size?

161
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:29,449
Because I wear 00, you twerp!

162
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,492
Why are you getting snappy?

163
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:31,451
Because you just called me fat!

164
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:35,998
Honey, you're pregnant. Your body's changing.

165
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:39,459
But I'm only 3 months pregnant! Women don't show at 3 months.

166
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,170
Is that what women do?

167
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:45,007
Do you want the larger size or not?

168
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:48,385
I'm just not going to eat for 2 days.

169
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:53,390
OK, you totally deserve to wear Dolce & Gabbana.

170
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:57,186
I want an explanation from you! Do you hear me?

171
00:07:57,186 --> 00:08:00,981
Edie, you just better get the hell off my back!

172
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:04,401
Oh, what are you going to do? I'd like to hear this! Big man! Big dreck!

173
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:09,406
Back off! Back the hell off!

174
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:13,702
Hi.

175
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:16,997
OK, so I got the boxes that you left on my porch.

176
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,374
Yeah, I figured you'd want your stuff back.

177
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:21,168
Thanks, that's great.

178
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:26,173
'Cause if you'd decided to hang on to my Joni Mitchell CDs, I'd have had to come after you with a club.

179
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:31,303
OK, it's not funny.

180
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:36,266
Actually, I wanted to see if you were aware that you gave me back the Valentine's Day card.

181
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,896
I was aware, yeah.

182
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:43,649
Oh. Well --

183
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:48,654
When two people split up, normally they don't give things back like Valentine's Day cards.

184
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:51,573
If you don't want it, you can throw it away.

185
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:54,993
Just please don't give it back to me. It's tacky.

186
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,578
I'm sorry.

187
00:08:56,578 --> 00:09:00,123
That's OK, people make...

188
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:01,500
mistakes.

189
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,586
Anything else?

190
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:05,504
Look.

191
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:07,589
Are you sure this is what you want to do?

192
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:12,511
I understand that you don't want our relationship to continue. You have made that clear.

193
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:17,516
But I sort of thought, down the long corridors of time, maybe you and I could be friends.

194
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:18,976
And if you keep acting like this --

195
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:21,854
Susan, it's over. On every level.

196
00:09:21,854 --> 00:09:25,315
I moved on. You should do the same.

197
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:29,570
Miserable son of a bitch!

198
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:34,575
`

199
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:39,079
I'll say one thing for us:

200
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:44,126
Even with all our problems, at least we're not acting like that.

201
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:51,884
OK, I'm starting to get the feeling that we're not going to a yard sale.

202
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:54,887
That was just a clever ruse to get you into my car.

203
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:59,850
Are you ready for your surprise?

204
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:02,603
Oh!

205
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:06,899
George, this is just an empty house. Why is this a surprise?

206
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:09,651
I just bought it.

207
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:12,196
Oh my God! Congratulations!

208
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:13,989
Oh George, I didn't even know you were looking!

209
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:17,367
Hurry, Ceal, they're here!
- I'm coming!

210
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,077
Hey, Georgie!

211
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:20,996
Bree, I'd like you to meet my mother.

212
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:24,124
George never introduces me to anyone.

213
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:27,294
So I knew you were special.

214
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:31,673
And this is Ceal, my mother's friend and the real estate agent who sold me the house.

215
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,675
Hi!
- Hi.

216
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:38,680
Well, we're going to go in the back, so George can -- you know.

217
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:47,064
So?

218
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:48,398
You really like it?

219
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,776
I do. I really do.

220
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:55,781
Good, 'cause I was sort of hoping that you might like to live here.

221
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:02,913
Bree --

222
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:07,167
will you marry me?

223
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,919
Huh?

224
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:12,005
I love you. And I think I know how you feel about me.

225
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,799
So why wait?

226
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:16,677
George, Rex hasn't even been dead for two months!

227
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:21,473
Yes, but if his death has taught us anything, it's that life is short.

228
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:23,475
It's dumb to play it safe.

229
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:28,272
If we see a chance for happiness, we should grab it and hold on tight.

230
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:32,109
See, I thought we were going to a yard sale.

231
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:34,278
Please.

232
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:39,074
Just say the word, and you'll make me the happiest guy on earth.

233
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:43,704
Congratulations, you two!
- Mazzel tov!

234
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:46,999
Guys, wait. She hasn't said yes yet.

235
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:47,875
Oh.

236
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:52,921
I told you we should wait.

237
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,591
So -- Bree --

238
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:57,718
What do you say?

239
00:11:57,718 --> 00:11:59,386
See, George.

240
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:04,391
The thing is --

241
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:14,109
OK.

242
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:15,569
You will?

243
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:16,987
You'll marry me?

244
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:21,992
OK.

245
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:30,918
Oh, my baby!

246
00:12:42,054 --> 00:12:43,472
Who is it?

247
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:45,974
Your ex-husband.

248
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:48,393
Karl --

249
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:49,853
What do you want?

250
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:53,190
Uh, Edie and I just broke up.

251
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,442
Oh.

252
00:12:55,442 --> 00:13:00,447
Come on in.

253
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:04,785
Sorry to come over at such short notice, but I couldn't face going to a motel.

254
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:05,869
That's OK.

255
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:08,664
Julie's staying at her friend's tonight. You can sleep in her room.

256
00:13:08,664 --> 00:13:13,669
On the sofa is fine, but thanks.

257
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:16,255
So am I allowed to ask what happened?

258
00:13:16,255 --> 00:13:18,549
You could ask, but I won't tell.

259
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:19,591
Why not?

260
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:21,718
'Cause it's embarrassing.

261
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,262
Karl, did you cheat again?

262
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:24,555
No.

263
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:26,056
Did she cheat?

264
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:26,765
No.

265
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:28,475
You finally saw her without her makeup.

266
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:29,268
Susan!

267
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:32,938
I'm sorry.

268
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:34,064
Are you OK?

269
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:35,274
Yeah.

270
00:13:35,274 --> 00:13:39,987
Haven't been working for quite a while. This was inevitable.

271
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:44,533
Well, these days anybody going through a breakup gets my sympathy.

272
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:47,327
That's right, I heard you made the plumber angry?

273
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:50,372
No, I made the plumber furious.

274
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:54,835
That is definitely over.

275
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:58,255
So there will be no gloating from me.

276
00:13:58,255 --> 00:14:03,260
Here's to no gloating.

277
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:07,264
Actually, I'm trying to keep a positive outlook on the whole thing.

278
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:09,850
Last night, I started writing, and --

279
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,435
well, I think there's a book in there.

280
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:12,144
A book?
- Yeah.

281
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:13,353
Like one of your children's books?

282
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,272
No, this one's for adults.

283
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:18,275
About all my failed relationships.

284
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:19,860
You're not writing about me, are you?

285
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,655
You're like the first 14 chapters.

286
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:25,073
Are you going to be fair?

287
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:26,658
I'm going to be honest.

288
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:31,330
I was afraid of that.

289
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:33,749
It was just awful.

290
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:37,252
George had a ring. His mother and her friend were there with champagne.

291
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:40,464
If I had said no, it would have devastated him.

292
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:43,258
So you agreed to marry him just to be polite?

293
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:47,262
Well, obviously there is a downside to having good manners.

294
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:50,474
So, when will you tell him how you really feel?

295
00:14:50,474 --> 00:14:51,642
That's why I wanted to talk to you.

296
00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:55,646
Part of me keeps thinking, maybe I should just do it.

297
00:14:55,646 --> 00:14:58,941
Do it? You mean actually marry him?

298
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:00,859
I know it sounds rash, but --

299
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:03,862
well, there's something comforting about George.

300
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:06,365
We share the same tastes and interests.

301
00:15:06,365 --> 00:15:09,076
Oh, and best of all: he loves the opera.

302
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:10,035
The opera?

303
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:13,664
Yes, we saw Aida last week, and we both cried buckets.

304
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:16,250
It was fun.

305
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:20,379
George loves art, poetry and music...

306
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:25,342
It would be nice to be married to someone who looks for beauty in the world, like I do.

307
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:32,391
I don't know.

308
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:36,520
That's why I'm here. I don't know what to do, Dr Goldfine.

309
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:40,148
Bree, you've said many times how comfortable you are with George.

310
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:44,361
But you don't feel for him the way you felt for Rex.

311
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:49,324
No.

312
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:53,162
True love is great.

313
00:15:53,162 --> 00:15:56,123
But at this point in my life --

314
00:15:56,123 --> 00:16:01,170
I think I'd rather just go to the opera.

315
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:03,463
Give me your glass.
- Oh, no, wait.

316
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,841
Got to finish off this --
- No, wait.

317
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:07,968
Four glasses is my limit.

318
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:12,931
If you help me finish off this bottle, I'll tell you what happened between me and Edie.

319
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:19,354
Hit me.

320
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:25,652
Edie was making the bed

321
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:30,115
and found a picture I kept under the matress.

322
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:33,660
A picture I didn't want her to see.

323
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,788
What was it?

324
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:40,250
It was a picture of you.

325
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,335
Why would you --?

326
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:45,964
Because it's something I like to take a look at, every now and then.

327
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:50,928
Wow!

328
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:59,061
What the hell was that?

329
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:01,730
That was something I've been wanting to do for quite some time.

330
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:05,192
Oh, that's just you rebounding from Edie.

331
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:10,155
So you're on the rebound from the plumber. No harm, no foul.

332
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:12,658
Karl. Don't be so weird.

333
00:17:12,658 --> 00:17:15,869
Two old friends suddenly find themselves single.

334
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:20,874
There's nothing weird about us helping each other out to be --

335
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:26,672
a little less lonely.

336
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,842
Thanks so much for taking care of the boys.

337
00:17:29,842 --> 00:17:31,927
I'll be back on Friday to pick your guys up.

338
00:17:31,927 --> 00:17:34,555
Leonard and I are going to take them out to the water park.

339
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:37,057
Yeah, um, before that happens --

340
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:42,062
I would we'd be able to take Penny sweet out! She's gotten sooo big!

341
00:17:43,272 --> 00:17:47,860
Peekaboo!

342
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,362
OK, enough of that!

343
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:51,572
Is there something wrong?

344
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:53,866
Actually, yes.

345
00:17:53,866 --> 00:17:57,953
We've agonized whether to tell you this, Norma, but --

346
00:17:57,953 --> 00:18:02,916
One of your private videos made its way into Jimmy and PJ's bag.

347
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:14,469
Please tell me the kids didn't see it.

348
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:16,263
Oh no, don't worry. I caught it.

349
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:21,185
Right before you took off your bra.

350
00:18:21,185 --> 00:18:22,853
I have to go.

351
00:18:22,853 --> 00:18:26,356
Norma, we just thought you needed to know what happened.

352
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:29,193
Seriously, we're cool with this, as long as you keep it away from the kids --

353
00:18:29,193 --> 00:18:32,070
I told Leonard this was going to happen!

354
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:36,116
Jimmy! PJ! Close the door! Hurry up!

355
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:37,326
`

356
00:18:37,326 --> 00:18:39,453
Norma, wait!

357
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:41,163
We're scheduled for next week!

358
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:42,581
Norma!

359
00:18:42,581 --> 00:18:47,586
The water park! Right?

360
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:01,475
Mum!

361
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,271
Mum?

362
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:11,276
Mum, are you up?

363
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:13,946
Oh my God.

364
00:19:13,946 --> 00:19:15,364
Oh, Julie!

365
00:19:15,364 --> 00:19:16,949
I thought you were going straight to school.

366
00:19:16,949 --> 00:19:18,742
I -- I needed money for lunch.

367
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:20,160
There's a 20 in my pants.

368
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,662
If you can find them.

369
00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:24,665
Julie --

370
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:29,670
Honey --

371
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:33,257
OK. There is a good explanation for what happened.

372
00:19:33,257 --> 00:19:34,591
I doubt that.

373
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:38,720
You probably don't know that your father and Edie broke up last night.

374
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,390
You slept with him the same night he broke up with her.

375
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:45,394
I said it was a good explanation, not a great one.

376
00:19:45,394 --> 00:19:46,728
Julie --

377
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:50,732
Hey pumpkin.
- Don't even finish.

378
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:53,652
I feel really awful.

379
00:19:53,652 --> 00:19:55,070
Me too.

380
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,573
We should not have done what we did.

381
00:19:57,573 --> 00:20:02,578
I know, I know.

382
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:04,454
But I gotta tell you --

383
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:06,748
Last night was the best sex ever.

384
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:09,126
Was it though? You were fantastic.

385
00:20:09,126 --> 00:20:13,046
Yeah, I'm just trying to keep up with you.

386
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:15,674
Why do you think we got so good all of a sudden?

387
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:19,386
Because we've been angry at each other for so long.

388
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:22,472
We finally found the way to channel it.

389
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:25,142
Maybe.

390
00:20:25,142 --> 00:20:26,643
So what happens next?

391
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:28,353
Well, I'm going to take a shower.

392
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:30,439
No, I mean with us.

393
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:32,649
Us? What do you mean? There is no us.

394
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:37,446
You can't tell me you can just walk away from this chemistry we got going.

395
00:20:37,446 --> 00:20:40,324
I mean, what happened last night was --

396
00:20:40,324 --> 00:20:41,450
explosive!

397
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:41,950
Karl!

398
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:45,787
Last night was two old friends helping each other through a rough patch. That's it.

399
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:47,789
Suzie-cue.
- Karl --

400
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:52,169
I want to move on. I don't want to go backwards. I'm sorry.

401
00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:57,132
But thank you for the explosion. I really needed it.

402
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:07,267
<i>After 48 hours of crash dieting, Gabrielle prepared to savor the fruit of her labor.</i></i>

403
00:21:08,936 --> 00:21:13,941
<i>But she was dismayed to discover that she herself had ripened considerably.</i></i>

404
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,244
Ralph!

405
00:21:25,244 --> 00:21:30,249
I need help getting dressed! Get in here!

406
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:35,671
Now!

407
00:21:35,671 --> 00:21:39,675
I have to fit in this, so for God's sakes, put some muscle into it!

408
00:21:39,675 --> 00:21:41,593
I'm trying.

409
00:21:41,593 --> 00:21:42,594
It won't zip.

410
00:21:42,594 --> 00:21:45,264
Well try harder!

411
00:21:45,264 --> 00:21:46,932
God, how my hands hurt.

412
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:51,270
I'm sorry, Ms Solís, but I can't get you into this dress. It's just too small.

413
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:56,275
Get me into this dress, and I will pay you $10 more a week!

414
00:21:56,859 --> 00:21:59,653
I think I got it, hold on!
- Hold still!

415
00:21:59,653 --> 00:22:00,863
Here we go!

416
00:22:00,863 --> 00:22:03,156
One --

417
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:04,324
two --

418
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:07,244
three!

419
00:22:07,244 --> 00:22:12,249
Thank God.

420
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:24,178
We brought you some ice cream.

421
00:22:24,178 --> 00:22:29,141
I know how long it's been since you had any.

422
00:22:30,642 --> 00:22:35,147
We'll have that in a minute, sweetheart.

423
00:22:35,147 --> 00:22:40,194
First, I want you to talk to me about what happened.

424
00:22:40,986 --> 00:22:42,446
About Melanie.

425
00:22:42,446 --> 00:22:44,156
I don't want to talk about her.

426
00:22:44,156 --> 00:22:47,659
You know it breaks my heart to keep you down here like this.

427
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:49,244
But I can't let you out,

428
00:22:49,244 --> 00:22:53,916
until I am positive that you will never hurt anyone else again.

429
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:57,794
And the first step is for you to show me

430
00:22:57,794 --> 00:23:01,381
that you understand that what you did was wrong.

431
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:05,636
She was a bad person.

432
00:23:05,636 --> 00:23:08,722
She deserved it.

433
00:23:08,722 --> 00:23:13,143
No one deserves to die like that, Caleb.

434
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:18,190
Don't you agree?

435
00:23:24,988 --> 00:23:29,243
Very well.

436
00:23:29,243 --> 00:23:34,248
If that's how it's going to be --

437
00:23:34,248 --> 00:23:39,253
this is how it's going to be.

438
00:24:11,076 --> 00:24:12,703
I can't believe we're doing this.

439
00:24:12,703 --> 00:24:16,623
If Leonard and Norma want to cut ties with us, who are we to stop them?

440
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:21,503
They need to know we don't judge them for what they do in the privacy of their own home.

441
00:24:21,503 --> 00:24:25,090
And, well, it's not unheard of to tape yourself while you're having sex.

442
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:27,301
Obviously, they were so embarrassed they don't want anything to do with us.

443
00:24:27,301 --> 00:24:29,469
Maybe we need to respect that.

444
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:34,099
I need these play dates.

445
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:36,268
Tom, we need these play dates.

446
00:24:36,268 --> 00:24:39,897
Right, fine. But you do all the talking.

447
00:24:39,897 --> 00:24:42,482
OK.

448
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:43,692
Norma --

449
00:24:43,692 --> 00:24:46,069
Wait!

450
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:47,946
Let's go.
- No!

451
00:24:47,946 --> 00:24:51,575
Hey, Scavos! What are you guys doing here?

452
00:24:51,575 --> 00:24:56,205
Hi. Sorry for just showing up unannounced, but --

453
00:24:56,205 --> 00:24:59,416
could we talk to you for a minute?
- Sure, come on in.

454
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:01,502
So, um --

455
00:25:01,502 --> 00:25:06,381
we've been trying to contact you, but you weren't returning any of our messages.

456
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:08,091
And we really hope it isn't because of the porno video.

457
00:25:08,091 --> 00:25:10,469
Home -- movies.

458
00:25:10,469 --> 00:25:13,472
The fact is, we really don't care.

459
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:17,392
And it's certainly no reason to keep our boys apart.

460
00:25:17,392 --> 00:25:19,478
We just don't know how they found it.

461
00:25:19,478 --> 00:25:21,271
But you know boys, they get into everything.

462
00:25:21,271 --> 00:25:23,148
But seriously, it's not a big deal.

463
00:25:23,148 --> 00:25:25,275
I mean, as long as you make sure it never happens again.

464
00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:26,610
It's the new millennium.

465
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,195
We're hip.

466
00:25:28,195 --> 00:25:30,864
What we're saying is, we get it.

467
00:25:30,864 --> 00:25:35,869
You're just having fun. It's nothing to be ashamed of.

468
00:25:36,078 --> 00:25:37,871
I'm just so relieved this all worked out.

469
00:25:37,871 --> 00:25:41,416
At one point, we actually talked about selling the house and moving.

470
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:44,670
Oh, no!

471
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:47,464
Thank you for being so open-minded.

472
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:51,802
Please. We're all adults. It's --

473
00:25:51,802 --> 00:25:54,888
I gotta tell you, the most embarrassing part of that video is how poorly it was shot.

474
00:25:54,888 --> 00:25:58,892
The production values are caca.

475
00:25:58,892 --> 00:26:03,272
Well, from a lay perspective, it looked very professional.

476
00:26:03,272 --> 00:26:06,608
What you saw was an example of my earlier work.

477
00:26:06,608 --> 00:26:09,069
Since then, I've become much more adept at --

478
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:11,154
production.

479
00:26:11,154 --> 00:26:12,698
You know, editing and lighting.

480
00:26:12,698 --> 00:26:17,703
Leonard has always dreamed of directing movies.

481
00:26:17,953 --> 00:26:23,000
Ironic, isn't it? I finally get my wish, and no one gets to see my work.

482
00:26:23,167 --> 00:26:27,004
That is a damn shame.

483
00:26:27,004 --> 00:26:28,755
I don't know, what do you think?

484
00:26:28,755 --> 00:26:32,217
Should we show them the room?

485
00:26:32,217 --> 00:26:37,181
Let's show them the room, huh?

486
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:39,683
Check out this baby.

487
00:26:39,683 --> 00:26:43,687
3-chip high depth. 1280 by 700 lines of resolution.

488
00:26:43,687 --> 00:26:47,274
Balanced lighting and dark sheets, so you don't get a kick off the pillows.

489
00:26:47,274 --> 00:26:50,194
Took me a while to learn that little trick.

490
00:26:50,194 --> 00:26:52,196
These walls are completely soundproof.

491
00:26:52,196 --> 00:26:55,491
You could scream your lungs out in here, and nobody'd hear you.

492
00:26:55,491 --> 00:26:58,202
It's true.

493
00:26:58,202 --> 00:27:00,287
So --

494
00:27:00,287 --> 00:27:03,165
Anytime you want to set up a shoot, just let me know.

495
00:27:03,165 --> 00:27:05,000
You guys would love it.

496
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,963
Once you get in front of that camera, you feel like a star.

497
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:15,969
Good night.
- Good night!

498
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:17,179
I'm taking no more play dates.

499
00:27:17,179 --> 00:27:22,184
Not a one.

500
00:27:24,186 --> 00:27:25,103
Hey.

501
00:27:25,103 --> 00:27:27,022
We'd better hurry. The movie starts in 20 minutes.

502
00:27:27,022 --> 00:27:28,607
There's been a slight change of plans.

503
00:27:28,607 --> 00:27:30,984
My mother had a couple of friends who really wanted to meet you,

504
00:27:30,984 --> 00:27:33,862
and I thought, what the heck, could be fun. Do you mind?

505
00:27:33,862 --> 00:27:37,282
No, I guess not.

506
00:27:37,282 --> 00:27:42,287
Hey everybody, this is Bree.

507
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:49,419
And this is my uncle Sid --

508
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:50,212
Hi.
- Hi.

509
00:27:50,212 --> 00:27:51,880
Rosalee --
- Hello.

510
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,008
Oh, and this is Stan Grazi. He does my mum's taxes.

511
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,760
She's a knockout, George!

512
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,972
I guess I owe you an apology.

513
00:27:59,972 --> 00:28:03,892
Since I was single all these years, Stan kept telling my mum I was gay.

514
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:05,686
I'm still going to need some proof.

515
00:28:05,686 --> 00:28:08,480
I guess I'll be getting that in about 9 months, hey, Bree?

516
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,691
What -- what happens in 9 months?

517
00:28:10,691 --> 00:28:13,277
It's just Stan's little joke about when we're going to start our own family.

518
00:28:13,277 --> 00:28:17,698
No, just so you know, Stan, it's going to be a while before we even think about kids.

519
00:28:17,698 --> 00:28:19,867
I want Bree all by myself for a while.

520
00:28:19,867 --> 00:28:24,496
Well, I wouldn't wait too long. After 40, the eggs don't get any fresher.

521
00:28:24,496 --> 00:28:29,501
Am I right, Bree?

522
00:28:29,501 --> 00:28:31,170
If you'll excuse me, I --

523
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:36,216
I have to go.

524
00:28:37,301 --> 00:28:38,093
Bree!

525
00:28:38,093 --> 00:28:39,303
Bree, where are you going?

526
00:28:39,303 --> 00:28:42,264
Taking my champagne and my aging eggs, and I'm going home!

527
00:28:42,264 --> 00:28:44,266
What's wrong?

528
00:28:44,266 --> 00:28:48,896
George, I'm starting to think that we made a mistake rushing into this engagement.

529
00:28:48,896 --> 00:28:49,479
What?

530
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:52,191
And I'm not the only one who thinks that. Other people have said the same thing.

531
00:28:52,191 --> 00:28:53,901
What others? Andrew?

532
00:28:53,901 --> 00:28:57,404
No. Dr Goldfine, my therapist.

533
00:28:57,404 --> 00:28:59,072
Your therapist? He doesn't know me.

534
00:28:59,072 --> 00:29:02,284
<i>He knows me. And certainly better than you do.</i></i>

535
00:29:02,284 --> 00:29:03,494
How can you say that?

536
00:29:03,494 --> 00:29:07,581
Well, for starters, he knows the last thing I'd ever want to do is have more children.

537
00:29:07,581 --> 00:29:08,999
Really?

538
00:29:08,999 --> 00:29:10,501
Well, I didn't know.

539
00:29:10,501 --> 00:29:11,877
But you should know that.

540
00:29:11,877 --> 00:29:16,882
That's the kind of thing that people who are engaged are supposed to know about each other.

541
00:29:17,174 --> 00:29:20,093
It doesn't matter. I don't need children.

542
00:29:20,093 --> 00:29:21,553
It's not just that, George.

543
00:29:21,553 --> 00:29:26,600
Dr Goldfine has other concerns about us being together, and I'm starting to think he's right.

544
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:29,978
Look --

545
00:29:29,978 --> 00:29:33,023
I'll agree with Dr Goldfine on one thing.

546
00:29:33,023 --> 00:29:35,901
We should slow things down.

547
00:29:35,901 --> 00:29:36,902
Really?

548
00:29:36,902 --> 00:29:37,277
Yes.

549
00:29:37,277 --> 00:29:42,282
Just because 2 people are engaged, doesn't mean they have to get married any time soon.

550
00:29:45,494 --> 00:29:47,871
I'll talk to Dr Goldfine about it tomorrow.

551
00:29:47,871 --> 00:29:52,876
Take whatever time you need.

552
00:30:05,556 --> 00:30:09,017
How many times am I going to have to ask you to fix this step?

553
00:30:09,017 --> 00:30:10,269
Matthew?

554
00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:11,478
You didn't answer me.

555
00:30:11,478 --> 00:30:16,483
Did you leave the door open?

556
00:30:41,884 --> 00:30:43,051
How do you do?

557
00:30:43,051 --> 00:30:46,430
Not good. People are going to start coming home from work soon.

558
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:49,141
OK. We can't panic.

559
00:30:49,141 --> 00:30:50,559
Caleb is scared.

560
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,436
He doesn't know the area.

561
00:30:52,436 --> 00:30:54,563
So he's going to be close by.

562
00:30:54,563 --> 00:30:59,568
Which yards haven't you checked yet?

563
00:31:06,533 --> 00:31:09,953
Bree! I desperately need your help.

564
00:31:09,953 --> 00:31:12,039
Dear, what's wrong?

565
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:15,542
How do you get your hydrangeas to look so stunning?

566
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:18,253
I'm systematically slaughtering my own garden.

567
00:31:18,253 --> 00:31:19,755
Do you really want to know my secret?

568
00:31:19,755 --> 00:31:21,340
Yes!

569
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,342
Horse manure. I have it delivered.

570
00:31:23,342 --> 00:31:28,347
Susan makes fun of me. But the proof is in the pudding.

571
00:31:42,361 --> 00:31:44,279
Hello.

572
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:48,742
Hey.

573
00:31:48,742 --> 00:31:51,620
Looking for something?

574
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,455
Uh --

575
00:31:53,455 --> 00:31:55,958
Yeah, actually -- I'm looking for you.

576
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:58,669
Me?

577
00:31:58,669 --> 00:32:00,546
You're looking for me?

578
00:32:00,546 --> 00:32:01,630
Yeah.

579
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:02,548
I've been thinking about you.

580
00:32:02,548 --> 00:32:05,092
That time we met I thought you were really cool.

581
00:32:05,092 --> 00:32:10,013
So you came to ask me out?

582
00:32:15,227 --> 00:32:20,274
'Cause I'll say yes.

583
00:32:22,442 --> 00:32:27,489
Thank you.

584
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:34,288
Anything?

585
00:32:34,288 --> 00:32:36,290
That was a waste of time.

586
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:41,170
Pretty much.

587
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:43,547
Did you hear the big news?

588
00:32:43,547 --> 00:32:44,965
Uh, the big news?

589
00:32:44,965 --> 00:32:47,217
Karl and I are back together.

590
00:32:47,217 --> 00:32:48,427
What?

591
00:32:48,427 --> 00:32:50,971
And I know that he stayed at your place last night.

592
00:32:50,971 --> 00:32:53,765
Which leads me to why I'm here.

593
00:32:53,765 --> 00:32:56,935
There's some stuff that I have to say, and it's not going to be pleasant.

594
00:32:56,935 --> 00:32:58,437
Edie, uh --

595
00:32:58,437 --> 00:33:01,064
Whatever it was you said to him --

596
00:33:01,064 --> 00:33:04,026
really helped.

597
00:33:04,026 --> 00:33:07,237
He showed up with flowers, and he apologized for everything.

598
00:33:07,237 --> 00:33:11,867
So --

599
00:33:11,867 --> 00:33:14,536
Thank you.

600
00:33:14,536 --> 00:33:16,163
I'm sorry, what?

601
00:33:16,163 --> 00:33:19,082
Well, I'm not going to say it again. It hurt my teeth the first time.

602
00:33:19,082 --> 00:33:20,417
No, Edie --

603
00:33:20,417 --> 00:33:23,962
This is so unexpected on so many levels. I don't know what to say.

604
00:33:23,962 --> 00:33:25,339
Then say nothing.

605
00:33:25,339 --> 00:33:28,133
Oh, and here --

606
00:33:28,133 --> 00:33:30,844
is the photo of you I found in our bed.

607
00:33:30,844 --> 00:33:33,555
I know he told you about it.

608
00:33:33,555 --> 00:33:36,767
Why are you giving it to me?

609
00:33:36,767 --> 00:33:40,562
Look, I appreciate whatever it was that you did last night.

610
00:33:40,562 --> 00:33:43,148
But it's still important for you to understand that --

611
00:33:43,148 --> 00:33:46,443
I won.

612
00:33:46,443 --> 00:33:48,153
You won?

613
00:33:48,153 --> 00:33:51,949
Yeah. Whatever little hold you had on Karl, is officially over.

614
00:33:51,949 --> 00:33:56,954
So you can stop feeling all smug and superiour that he kept that thing.

615
00:33:57,371 --> 00:33:59,623
Believe me, I don't feel superior.

616
00:33:59,623 --> 00:34:01,250
Good. 'Cause you shouldn't.

617
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:05,212
He made his choice. And it's not you.

618
00:34:05,212 --> 00:34:07,464
You're right.

619
00:34:07,464 --> 00:34:12,427
He made his choice.

620
00:34:21,854 --> 00:34:24,565
Bree, it's still too easy to breathe, you gotta make it tighter!

621
00:34:24,565 --> 00:34:27,234
Gabby, if I make it any tighter, you won't be able to sit down.

622
00:34:27,234 --> 00:34:31,155
I don't care! Can't have any of these girls thinking that I'm pregnant.

623
00:34:31,155 --> 00:34:33,532
Do you actually think they're going to make fun of you?

624
00:34:33,532 --> 00:34:37,161
Trust me, they're merciless.

625
00:34:37,161 --> 00:34:40,956
But why? I mean, surely they have friends who have children.

626
00:34:40,956 --> 00:34:43,542
When I decided to marry Carlos, I told these girls

627
00:34:43,542 --> 00:34:48,338
I would spend the rest of my days being rich and in love and childless.

628
00:34:48,338 --> 00:34:49,548
And they laughed at me,

629
00:34:49,548 --> 00:34:53,218
and they said I would just end up being another fat hausfrau,

630
00:34:53,218 --> 00:34:56,555
living a life that I didn't plan.

631
00:34:56,555 --> 00:34:59,057
I'm not going to give them the satisfaction of knowing they were right.

632
00:34:59,057 --> 00:35:01,435
Well, maybe they'll just be happy for you.

633
00:35:01,435 --> 00:35:05,731
Bree, my friends are models. They're never happy for anyone.

634
00:35:05,731 --> 00:35:07,941
Do you ever think you might like it?

635
00:35:07,941 --> 00:35:09,151
What?

636
00:35:09,151 --> 00:35:11,445
Motherhood.

637
00:35:11,445 --> 00:35:12,362
No.

638
00:35:12,362 --> 00:35:14,948
Come on. You don't think you're going to love your own baby?

639
00:35:14,948 --> 00:35:17,367
I'm not saying that I'm not going to grow attached to the little bugger,

640
00:35:17,367 --> 00:35:20,412
I just don't have the motherhood gene.

641
00:35:20,412 --> 00:35:23,749
I wish I did, but I don't.

642
00:35:23,749 --> 00:35:24,750
What?

643
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:26,043
I'm just smiling because,

644
00:35:26,043 --> 00:35:28,170
I think a few months from now you're going to come to me

645
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:31,882
and tell me how madly in love you are with your new little baby,

646
00:35:31,882 --> 00:35:35,135
and I'm going to have to resist the urge to say, "I told you so".

647
00:35:35,135 --> 00:35:38,013
Maybe. But I doubt it.

648
00:35:38,013 --> 00:35:43,060
There you go! All done.

649
00:35:43,227 --> 00:35:44,353
How do I look?

650
00:35:44,353 --> 00:35:47,356
Positively glowing!

651
00:35:47,356 --> 00:35:52,361
Bree.

652
00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:52,754
I'll get the champagne.

653
00:36:54,214 --> 00:36:57,801
Hi! Helloo!

654
00:36:57,801 --> 00:37:00,095
Oh my God!

655
00:37:00,095 --> 00:37:05,100
You're pregnant!

656
00:37:07,394 --> 00:37:09,313
Bree? It's Gabby!

657
00:37:09,313 --> 00:37:14,276
Honey, it's open. Come on in.

658
00:37:16,361 --> 00:37:17,905
Hi.

659
00:37:17,905 --> 00:37:20,491
My -- friends just left,

660
00:37:20,491 --> 00:37:23,702
and I was hoping you could come over and cut me out of this thing.

661
00:37:23,702 --> 00:37:25,954
How was your little reunion?

662
00:37:25,954 --> 00:37:28,707
It was, um --

663
00:37:28,707 --> 00:37:29,708
weird.

664
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:31,293
Weird?

665
00:37:31,293 --> 00:37:35,422
Well, Allison's mad because she's losing jobs for 14-year-olds,

666
00:37:35,422 --> 00:37:38,383
Holly is on a strict diet of cruciferous vegetables,

667
00:37:38,383 --> 00:37:42,679
and Yazmin is undergoing a new embryonic facial treatment

668
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:46,475
that probably causes short-term-memory loss.

669
00:37:46,475 --> 00:37:51,480
I just stood there the whole night, trying to remember why we were ever friends.

670
00:37:53,106 --> 00:37:54,775
And I couldn't --

671
00:37:54,775 --> 00:37:56,693
You know, honey --

672
00:37:56,693 --> 00:37:58,362
People change.

673
00:37:58,362 --> 00:38:00,280
Yeah, but that's the thing: they haven't changed.

674
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,699
That's who they've always been.

675
00:38:02,699 --> 00:38:04,701
I have changed.

676
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:06,954
And I honestly don't know how.

677
00:38:06,954 --> 00:38:08,705
Well --

678
00:38:08,705 --> 00:38:13,502
Maybe Susan, Lynette and I have had a good influence on you.

679
00:38:13,502 --> 00:38:17,422
I doubt that.

680
00:38:17,422 --> 00:38:18,882
Come on.

681
00:38:18,882 --> 00:38:23,679
When I finish up here, I'll come over with my sewing kit and cut you out of that.

682
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:24,388
All right.

683
00:38:24,388 --> 00:38:29,434
But hurry up, because I've been having to pee since the hors d'uvres.

684
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:35,983
Are you free to go shopping tomorrow?

685
00:38:35,983 --> 00:38:40,612
I figured it's probably time I bought some clothes that actually fit.

686
00:38:40,612 --> 00:38:44,783
Well, I know a store that carries maternity clothes with designer labels.

687
00:38:44,783 --> 00:38:48,370
I like the sound of that.

688
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:53,417
Thanks.

689
00:40:24,383 --> 00:40:26,218
Thank you.

690
00:40:26,218 --> 00:40:31,223
<i>Yes, cameras are tools designed to capture images.</i></i>

691
00:40:31,682 --> 00:40:36,603
Wait.

692
00:40:36,603 --> 00:40:39,690
She needs me to get something for her. I will be right back.

693
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:44,695
<i>But in truth, they can capture so much more.</i></i>

694
00:40:44,778 --> 00:40:47,698
<i>They can uncover hidden longing</i></i>

695
00:40:47,698 --> 00:40:52,703
<i>of men who should no longer care.</i></i>

696
00:40:53,495 --> 00:40:57,499
<i>They can reveal the extraordinary secrets</i></i>

697
00:40:57,499 --> 00:41:02,504
<i>of the most ordinary marriages.</i></i>

698
00:41:03,422 --> 00:41:05,424
<i>Most amazing of all,</i></i>

699
00:41:05,424 --> 00:41:10,387
<i>cameras can quietly and clearly reveal to us our dreams.</i></i>

700
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:16,685
<i>Dreams we didn't even know we had.</i></i>
