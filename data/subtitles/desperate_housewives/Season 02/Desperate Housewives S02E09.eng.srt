00:00:02,753 --> 00:00:04,796
Previously on "Desperate Housewives"

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,591
All this time my father has been right across town

4
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:09,176
running the feed store?

5
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:11,053
Susan found her real father

6
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:13,138
Ed wants to make the final decision

7
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:14,932
Ed Furarer, Lynette Scoval

8
00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:16,725
Lynette met her new boss

9
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:19,478
I've learned my lesson. Ok, when I get out of here

10
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:20,938
Everything's gotta be different

11
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:23,690
Carlos promised to change his old ways

12
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:26,151
Dr. Goldfine has concerns about us being together

13
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:27,778
and I'm starting to thinking he's right

14
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:31,114
While Bree discovered George's true colours

15
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:31,990
George, I don't want to!

16
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,284
We are engaged! You have to wear it!

17
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:35,911
I don't think we are any more

18
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:41,750
Anyone who'd ever been to a party of Bree van de Kamp's

19
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,419
thought of her as the perfect hostes

20
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:47,881
Because Bree knew how to take care of her guests

21
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:52,261
Her dinners will always served properly

22
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:56,390
Her licer always flow freely

23
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:01,270
And her anicdoses were always enjoyable

24
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:04,648
But on this night, the perfect hostess

25
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:07,150
was about to find herself...

26
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:12,030
Where's that music coming from?

27
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:16,201
in a very imperfect predicament.

28
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:19,830
Uh, I'm not sure.

29
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:25,002
Don't give upon us, baby

30
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:28,297
we're still worth one more try

31
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:31,383
um, if you'll excuse me for just one minute.

32
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:36,513
I know we put our last one by

33
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,640
just for a rainy evening

34
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,058
George!

35
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,351
I have guests.

36
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,687
- What do you think you're doing?
- We had a tiff. I upset you.

37
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,480
And now I'm just trying to make things right again.

38
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:46,815
It was not a tiff

39
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:48,775
We broke up. It's over.

40
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:51,737
- We can still come through
- I am not kidding.

41
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:54,072
If you do not knock it off, I am gonna call the police.

42
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:54,823
All right, go ahead.

43
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,618
I really lost my head last night

44
00:01:57,743 --> 00:01:59,286
call the police. If they drag me away,

45
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:00,579
I'm just gonna come right back here.

46
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:02,331
I want you to hear the whole medley

47
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:04,249
Come on!

48
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:10,297
Why don't you all take your seats?

49
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:13,884
dessert is about to be served.

50
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:33,529
I really lost my head last night

51
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:35,447
you've got a right

52
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:36,490
to...

53
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:45,415
yes, Bree knew how to take care of her guests,

54
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:49,670
especially those who weren't invited.

55
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:54,633
Desperate Housewives
Season 2 Episode 9

56
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,930
Good guys wear white hats,

57
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:02,266
and bad guys wear black.

58
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:04,268
This is how children distinguish

59
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:07,563
between good and evil.

60
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,523
But they soon learn that bad guys

61
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:11,525
don't always look so bad.

62
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,402
In fact, sometimes

63
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:15,904
they even seem down right friendly.

64
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,823
That is, until you get to know them

65
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:19,533
a little bit better.

66
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,702
Hey, fancy seeing you here.

67
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:22,786
I was just out for a little ride.

68
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,246
Don't lie to me, George.

69
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:27,416
You've been riding up and down this street
for the last hour.

70
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:28,500
I don't want to do this, Bree,

71
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,918
but you won't return any of my phone calls.

72
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:33,797
So stalking me is plan "b"?

73
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:36,967
Bree, I know I messed up.

74
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:39,469
I know I got some issues to work on,

75
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:40,971
but I'd be willing to see a therapist

76
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:42,514
if that's what you want.

77
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,891
I'll do anything, but

78
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:45,434
how can I show you that I can--

79
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:48,228
I can change if you don't give me a second chance?

80
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,479
Come on.

81
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:51,899
You know I'm not a bad person.

82
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:53,025
I do know that,

83
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,820
but I'm just not sure you're a good one, either.

84
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:05,495
and we integrated the corporate logo

85
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:06,914
into the jungle background,

86
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,082
creating not only an ad for the clothing,

87
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:12,294
but for the company itself.

88
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,841
I don't get it.

89
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,177
What, um, don't you get?

90
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:23,680
The whole idea just kind a makes my head hurt.

91
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:24,681
Is it just me?

92
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,016
No, nuh-unh.

93
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:27,809
You're right. It stinks.

94
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,937
Sorry, guys. Back to the drawing board.

95
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:32,523
Well, I got tickets to a game.

96
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:33,690
Nina, you do whatever you have to do

97
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,150
to keep us afloat here.

98
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,652
You got it.

99
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,696
Looks like it's gonna be another late night at the office.

100
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:40,822
Nice work, everybody.

101
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:41,990
Thank you.

102
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:45,160
Could you can the attitude, Nina?

103
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,662
I'm sorry. What did you just say?

104
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:47,746
You're being rude.

105
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:49,122
And it's totally out of line.

106
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:51,458
You know how hard we all worked on this.

107
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,293
Yeah, I do.

108
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,754
Nina, I think I speak for everyone here

109
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:59,132
when I say we are sick and tired of your abuse.

110
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:02,052
Frankly, you owe us an apology.

111
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:03,887
Is--is this true?

112
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,472
I mean, I would be mortified

113
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:09,059
if I thought that I'd hurt any of you.

114
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,521
I mean, If anybody feels like I owe them an apology,

115
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:17,442
please, speak up.

116
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:19,528
You? You?

117
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:21,196
You?

118
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:22,573
Gee, Lynette.

119
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:24,783
I guess you were mistaken.

120
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,077
All right, let's recap, shall we?

121
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:32,791
Stinky pitch ,workin' late, no apologies.

122
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:35,794
Guys!

123
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:36,920
We talked about this.

124
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,214
What happened to standing up for ourselves?

125
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,299
Hot muffins.

126
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:41,258
Any takers?

127
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:45,804
No, Stu. These people don't deserve muffins.

128
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:52,394
hello?

129
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:54,104
hello. My name is mark Martinez.

130
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:56,565
I'm the assistant warden down at Fairvew county jail.

131
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:57,941
Is Mrs. Solis available?

132
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,068
Uh, yeah, this is her.

133
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:01,737
Did somethin' happen with Carlos?

134
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,280
At 7:43 this morning,

135
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:05,199
your husband held two guards at gunpoint

136
00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:07,075
and successfully escaped.

137
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:08,452
He what?!

138
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:10,287
I take it you had no prior knowledge

139
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:11,413
he had planned to do this?

140
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,040
No, of course not.

141
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:14,333
He's a moron!

142
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:15,751
We have every reason to believe

143
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:18,921
your husband may come to find you.

144
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,215
We believe him to be armed...

145
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,759
and very, very horny.

146
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:25,594
What?

147
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:27,513
Surprise, baby.

148
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,432
I got paroled early.

149
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,352
It's so good to see you!

150
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:34,728
What happened?

151
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:35,729
Well, there's this church group

152
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,356
that helps out catholic prisoners.

153
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,441
And they really, really stepped up for me.

154
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:40,651
Well ,what did they do?

155
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:43,737
They lobbied the parole board and it worked.

156
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:47,491
I guess I owe the pope a thank-you note.

157
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:49,326
Less talking,

158
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:51,870
more stripping.

159
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,380
Prudy's feed store.

160
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:03,841
Apparently, he owns the place.

161
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:05,217
How are you gonna do it?

162
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,844
What do you mean?

163
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:09,555
I mean, how are you gonna tell him you're his daughter?

164
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:11,431
Oh, I'm not.

165
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:14,017
Julie, the man abandoned me before I was born.

166
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:17,479
I don't have a desire to have a relationship with him.

167
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:19,231
Okay, then I'm really confused

168
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:21,108
why we're here spying on him.

169
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:23,527
Well, I just wanna see what he's like

170
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:25,904
and satisfy my curiosity and

171
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:28,448
get it out of my system.

172
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,875
Well, here you go.

173
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,959
Now you tell Charlie that

174
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:41,211
Addison Prudy says drop in some time.

175
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:43,172
I miss that ugly mug of his around here

176
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,090
I will.

177
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:52,431
I bet I know what you're here for.

178
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:53,640
Oh?

179
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,517
You heard about the giveaway.

180
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,728
Well, I got the cowboy hats right here.

181
00:07:57,853 --> 00:07:59,313
Oh, oh no, that's okay.

182
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:01,231
You don't have to give me anything, really.

183
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:03,609
Relax. This is a promotional item.

184
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:06,111
Didn't cost me a dime.

185
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,993
There you go.

186
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:16,163
Pretty as a picture.

187
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:26,006
I have a dad.

188
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:27,132
He's great!

189
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:29,218
He gave me a hat.

190
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:37,518
That biting thing at the end...

191
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:40,354
Totally blew my mind.

192
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:43,065
Please tell me you didn't learn that in prison.

193
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:45,192
Yeah.

194
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:49,947
Wait. I'm not done with you yet.

195
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:52,699
Just give me ten minutes, please.

196
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,409
What is wrong with you?

197
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:57,162
You are totally useless after sex.

198
00:08:57,371 --> 00:09:01,166
I know. I should probably get my thyroid
checked out.

199
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:12,261
who's sister Mary Bernard?

200
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:14,429
those are private. Give me--

201
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:16,682
she's this nun, okay?

202
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,392
She visited me in prison a couple times.

203
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,060
She's part of the group that got me early release.

204
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:22,187
Now can I please have them back?

205
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:23,981
"When you walk with god every day,

206
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:26,316
"you learn that truth is understood in the mind

207
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:29,778
but faith burns in the heart"?

208
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,240
You don't know what it was like in there.

209
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:37,369
All right? 20 hours a day,8x10 cell.

210
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:40,080
Just you and your mind.

211
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:43,250
So pretty much just you.

212
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,462
It forces you to reexamine everything.

213
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:49,840
I was a very bad person for a very long time,

214
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:51,800
but now all that is gonna change

215
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,303
because I'm on a new path.

216
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:57,264
A new path?

217
00:09:57,264 --> 00:10:00,100
I am going to live a virtuous life.

218
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:01,977
I wanna do right by you,

219
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,937
by my mama

220
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:06,356
and by my god.

221
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:12,487
What the hell did they do to you in that prison?

222
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,950
All right, this is my last hand,

223
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,285
and then I gotta go.

224
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,369
Already?

225
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:21,413
I left a proposal on my desk at work.

226
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,165
I have to go over it tonight, or

227
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,917
you-know-who is gonna have my head.

228
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:27,085
Nina.

229
00:10:27,503 --> 00:10:28,921
You know, this gainful employment thing

230
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:31,131
is really starting to cut into our social life.

231
00:10:31,215 --> 00:10:33,550
Well, If one of you would just agree to raise my kids,

232
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:36,303
I wouldn't need a job. Any takers?

233
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:39,097
- Ha ha.
- No, I didn't think so.

234
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:40,682
Ante up.

235
00:10:41,225 --> 00:10:42,976
Speaking of child abandonment,

236
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:44,144
when are you gonna tell your father

237
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:47,064
that he has a bouncing, middle-aged baby girl?

238
00:10:47,231 --> 00:10:49,316
Soon. I don't wanna ambush him.

239
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:50,651
I'm gonna ease into it.

240
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:53,570
How do you ease into, "Hi. I'm your illegitimate daughter"?

241
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:55,322
Well, actually, there's a "help wanted" sign

242
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:57,658
in the window, so I was thinking about
getting a job there.

243
00:10:57,783 --> 00:10:59,368
And you know, he would get to know me,

244
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:02,788
and I'm sure he would like me and
I would like him, and...

245
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:04,498
then one day, he'd say,

246
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:06,124
"you're like the daughter I never had,"

247
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:11,088
and I'd say, "well, actually, now that you mention it..."

248
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:16,510
okay, I'll go first.

249
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:19,179
That is the most idiotic plan I've ever heard of.

250
00:11:19,388 --> 00:11:20,472
Why?

251
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,017
Because it all hinges on him responding
to your personality.

252
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:27,229
And let's face it, you are an acquired taste.

253
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:30,816
Edie, I am sure Susan's father will like her just fine.

254
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:31,525
Thank you.

255
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:34,069
I just hope you don't expect too much from this relationship.

256
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:35,946
I mean, aside from D.N.A., You might find

257
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:37,531
that you don't have that much in common.

258
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:41,618
I know, but I gotta find out if there's something there.

259
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,495
I've always wanted a dad.

260
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:45,831
I mean, I know not having one affected me.

261
00:11:45,998 --> 00:11:47,249
Well, of course it did.

262
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,210
Everyone needs a strong male role model.

263
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:51,378
No, they don't.

264
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:55,132
I grew up without a father, and it didn't affect me one bit.

265
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:59,219
Edie, how old were you when you lost your virginity?

266
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:02,181
Point well taken.

267
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:18,071
Hey.

268
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:22,075
Look what I found in Ed's fridge.

269
00:12:46,058 --> 00:12:48,393
hey, Stu.

270
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:53,524
and Nina!

271
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,318
Hey, Lynette, can I see you for a sec?

272
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:58,237
Sure.

273
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,199
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

274
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,700
Having sex with the support staff--

275
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:04,826
that's a big no-no.

276
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:08,247
Ed's been known to fire people for that sort of thing.

277
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:09,706
Lynette,

278
00:13:09,832 --> 00:13:13,293
I know that we've had our little differences.

279
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:15,546
But at the core,

280
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:19,049
I believe that we're both good people,

281
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:23,095
both smart women who are just trying to make it

282
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:26,265
in this vicious male-dominated jungle--

283
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,641
okay, what do you want?

284
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:29,309
Do you want a raise?

285
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:31,061
You want a better office?

286
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:33,272
My demands are simple.

287
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:36,984
I want you to be nicer.

288
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,318
What?

289
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:39,528
No more belittling,

290
00:13:39,695 --> 00:13:40,737
berating,

291
00:13:40,863 --> 00:13:42,865
rude sarcasm.

292
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,158
And in exchange I get your silence?

293
00:13:45,284 --> 00:13:47,619
Yeah. Pretty sweet deal, don't you think?

294
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:50,372
Um...

295
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:53,208
I'll see what I can do.

296
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,878
Great. Okay.

297
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:58,755
And I'm gonna take your parking space.

298
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:01,925
I kid the Nina.

299
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:11,602
you're up early.

300
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:13,228
I'm going to mass.

301
00:14:13,312 --> 00:14:15,439
- Huh? - Yeah.

302
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:17,482
But it's not even Sunday.

303
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:19,610
They have mass every day of the week.

304
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:23,071
Really? When did they start doing that?

305
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:25,365
that's sister Mary Bernard.

306
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,076
Did you see where I put my bible?

307
00:14:52,518 --> 00:14:54,853
- What?- I saw your nun.

308
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:56,647
So? So she's hot.

309
00:14:56,772 --> 00:14:59,858
She's a hot nun.

310
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:02,653
you can't seriously be jealous.

311
00:15:02,778 --> 00:15:05,489
You mean to tell me that this
miraculous conversion of yours

312
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:07,032
has nothing to do with the fact

313
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:11,078
that the woman standing outside is a knockout?

314
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:15,624
That's what I'm telling you.

315
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,439
Um, who are you here to see?

316
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:42,025
I'm Lynette Scavo

317
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:43,694
I work here

318
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:44,528
Who are you?

319
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:46,613
Pat. It's my first day.

320
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:49,032
Oh. Well, welcome.

321
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:50,659
What happened to Stu?

322
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:53,579
You fired Stu?

323
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,664
Oh, Lynette, hey. Come on in.

324
00:15:55,831 --> 00:15:58,917
I can't believe you would sink so low.

325
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:00,127
I'm going to ed.

326
00:16:00,252 --> 00:16:05,883
Ed knows. This is Stu's employee evaluation file right here.

327
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:08,218
This thing is full of black marks.

328
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:11,180
Come on, Nina. We both know why you got rid of him.

329
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,765
Well, good luck proving it.

330
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:17,603
Oh, and on a completely unrelated topic,

331
00:16:17,728 --> 00:16:19,438
there's going to be another round of firings

332
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:20,939
coming down the pike.

333
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:23,150
Ed's been after me to trim the fat.

334
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:25,819
- You threatening me?
- No, no. Unh-unh.

335
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:27,779
It's just that it's gonna be my job

336
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:30,115
to evaluate those who are team players

337
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,783
and those who are not.

338
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:35,037
Just a little heads up.

339
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,956
Just trying to be nice.

340
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:44,880
I don't know. You seem kind a overqualified.

341
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:46,298
Why, 'cause I went to college?

342
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:49,885
No, because you finished high school.

343
00:16:50,469 --> 00:16:53,388
well, I just wanna change my life, and...

344
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:54,473
ever since I was a little girl,

345
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:57,851
I've always liked horses and the outdoors, and...

346
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:00,604
well, I'm just fascinated with...

347
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:02,606
feed

348
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:06,985
Well, I suppose we could give you a try.

349
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:10,030
What?

350
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:12,115
Something on my nose?

351
00:17:12,241 --> 00:17:17,788
Oh, no. Um, I was just looking
at the color of your eyes.

352
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,039
You were?

353
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:22,000
Yeah. They're just like mine.

354
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,837
They're--they're nice.

355
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:27,673
Carol sent you to test me, didn't she?

356
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:29,341
What? Who's carol?

357
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:30,717
You go back and tell my wife

358
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:33,095
if a private detective couldn't fool me,

359
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,013
well, you're not gonna either.

360
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:36,181
I don't know what you're talking about.

361
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:38,475
- I just came in to get a little
- a cute little thing like you

362
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,353
struts in here, flirts with an old codger like me--

363
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:43,021
how dumb do you think I am?

364
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:46,149
Hey, look at you. Pretty hair. You got a sexy walk.

365
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:47,818
You got a tight little ass--

366
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:50,946
oh, I'm your daughter.

367
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:53,323
What?

368
00:17:54,533 --> 00:17:58,370
Back in the '60s,you had a brief...

369
00:17:58,495 --> 00:18:02,499
relationship with a young girl, Sophia Bremmer.

370
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:04,209
She got pregnant and had a baby,

371
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:07,254
and that baby was me,

372
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:10,966
which makes you my father.

373
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:13,427
Hi.

374
00:18:16,305 --> 00:18:17,306
Mr. Prudy, I'm sorry.

375
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:18,724
I didn't want to spring on you like this.

376
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:20,017
Where are you going?

377
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:21,852
You see, when I found out you were alive

378
00:18:21,977 --> 00:18:23,896
and that we both lived in the same city,

379
00:18:24,021 --> 00:18:26,773
I just wanted to meet you.

380
00:18:27,191 --> 00:18:29,234
Mr. Prudy?

381
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:32,487
Mr. Prudy.

382
00:18:32,988 --> 00:18:36,033
Hello?

383
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:39,411
hello?

384
00:18:51,507 --> 00:18:54,760
And knock wood, the doctors say I'll keep improving

385
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:57,679
slowly but surely.

386
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:00,057
So how are you?

387
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:02,392
Good, good. I'm seeing friends,

388
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:05,395
and I just started co-chairing a charity event

389
00:19:05,604 --> 00:19:08,273
for the junior league, and, um,

390
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:11,693
and I broke up with George.

391
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:13,070
Really?

392
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:17,157
Dr. Goldfine, do you ever really cure people,

393
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:19,368
I mean, even if they're really crazy?

394
00:19:19,535 --> 00:19:21,578
I'm not a big fan of that word.

395
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:24,957
People either have mental health or they don't.

396
00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:26,625
When they do have a problem,

397
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,378
you treat them as if they had any other disease,

398
00:19:29,503 --> 00:19:31,588
and sometimes they get better.

399
00:19:31,713 --> 00:19:33,215
Well, when I broke up with George,

400
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,260
I saw something in his eyes.

401
00:19:36,385 --> 00:19:39,263
It was a kind of malevolence,

402
00:19:39,388 --> 00:19:40,264
and it just didn't seem to me

403
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:42,641
to be the sort of thing that you could cure.

404
00:19:42,808 --> 00:19:44,351
I don't believe in evil either.

405
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:45,477
We're all just people.

406
00:19:45,644 --> 00:19:46,854
How can you not believe in evil?

407
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:49,815
A man just threw you off a bridge for no reason.

408
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,693
Exactly. He didn't know anything about me.

409
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:56,029
He just rode upon his little blue bike

410
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:57,072
and tried to hurt me.

411
00:19:57,197 --> 00:20:01,535
Do I think he's wicked? No. He's disturbed.

412
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:05,247
His problems probably stem from a chemical imbalance.

413
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:10,043
I believe with enough time and treatment,
I could help him.

414
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:13,672
Did you say a blue bike?

415
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:18,468
Black?

416
00:20:18,594 --> 00:20:20,429
Great.

417
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:22,848
I gotta say, Lynette,

418
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:24,600
I was surprised to get your call.

419
00:20:24,725 --> 00:20:26,810
I didn't even think you'd notice I was fired.

420
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:30,147
Of course I noticed. You are one of my favourites.

421
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:33,775
And I thought it was really unfair
how it all went down.

422
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:35,402
It wasn't that unfair,

423
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:37,154
I was late all those times

424
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:38,780
and I broke the copier.

425
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:40,824
And I stole all those paper clips.

426
00:20:40,908 --> 00:20:44,953
See, I don't think that's why you got fired.

427
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:48,081
Really? That's what Nina said.

428
00:20:48,207 --> 00:20:52,377
Word got out that you and Nina were...

429
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:54,296
shagging?

430
00:20:54,713 --> 00:20:56,006
being intimate.

431
00:20:56,173 --> 00:21:00,093
And Nina fired you to keep ed from finding out.

432
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:01,178
You're kidding.

433
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:02,971
And that wasn't right of her.

434
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:04,515
She shouldn't have been having sex with you.

435
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,892
She's upper management.

436
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:09,811
Technically, It's sexual harassment.

437
00:21:09,937 --> 00:21:12,397
But I was into it. I consented.

438
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:16,235
Stu, you're A... gofer.

439
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:19,321
You can't consent to anything.

440
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:24,201
So I think you should talk to ed about
getting your job back.

441
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:25,744
Why would he care?

442
00:21:25,828 --> 00:21:27,579
Oh, he'll care.

443
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:31,250
He doesn't want you suing him for millions of dollars.

444
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:34,419
Wow!

445
00:21:35,504 --> 00:21:37,506
So would Nina get in trouble?

446
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:39,132
Well, I'm not gonna lie to you.

447
00:21:39,258 --> 00:21:42,719
There is a possibility she'd get A...

448
00:21:42,928 --> 00:21:45,931
slap on the wrist.

449
00:21:46,223 --> 00:21:47,766
So...

450
00:21:47,933 --> 00:21:49,810
you'll think about talking to ed?

451
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:51,979
Definitely.

452
00:21:55,983 --> 00:21:58,235
The nurse told me you were waiting out there.

453
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,445
I just wanted to see if you were okay.

454
00:22:00,571 --> 00:22:04,575
Sorry if I spooked you. I've got a bad heart.

455
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,911
It's genetic, so you might wanna get that checked.

456
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,123
Oh. Okay.

457
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:15,419
Look, don't take this wrong, but I need you to clear out.

458
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:17,212
What? I just got here.

459
00:22:17,421 --> 00:22:19,047
My wife is on her way.

460
00:22:19,173 --> 00:22:20,591
The thing is, If carol finds out

461
00:22:20,716 --> 00:22:23,594
I've got an adult love child running around,

462
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:26,763
that's gonna be the straw that breaks the camel's back.

463
00:22:26,889 --> 00:22:32,227
I mean, It's not exactly the only time I've strayed.

464
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:33,478
Charming.

465
00:22:33,604 --> 00:22:34,897
But believe me

466
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:37,524
it was nice to finally get to meet you.

467
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:40,777
You're a lovely woman.

468
00:22:41,612 --> 00:22:46,909
Hon, you really need to leave now.

469
00:22:49,578 --> 00:22:52,039
It's Susan.

470
00:22:52,164 --> 00:22:53,624
My name is Susan. And

471
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:57,127
no, that's not good enough.

472
00:22:57,211 --> 00:22:58,253
Look, I'M...

473
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:02,090
I'm trying really hard to be nice about this,

474
00:23:02,132 --> 00:23:03,634
but you're backing me into a corner.

475
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:05,719
It's not like I want an invitation to thanksgiving.

476
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:10,474
I just wanna have coffee or lunch now and then.

477
00:23:10,516 --> 00:23:12,559
I can't start up something with you.

478
00:23:12,684 --> 00:23:14,144
It wouldn't be fair to my wife.

479
00:23:14,269 --> 00:23:15,187
Oh, that's funny.

480
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,688
So all the times you were cheating on her,

481
00:23:16,897 --> 00:23:18,815
that was okay, but having lunch with your daughter--

482
00:23:18,941 --> 00:23:21,401
that just crosses the line.

483
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:25,364
I just want a chance to get to know you.

484
00:23:25,781 --> 00:23:30,160
Well, I don't want to know you.

485
00:23:31,078 --> 00:23:34,331
I've already got a family.

486
00:23:34,748 --> 00:23:37,626
Years ago, your mother and I came to an understanding.

487
00:23:37,751 --> 00:23:39,461
I gave her a bunch of money,

488
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:43,674
and she agreed to keep things quiet.

489
00:23:44,007 --> 00:23:47,761
Well, I wasn't consulted on that little arrangement.

490
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:49,930
I don't think it's fair to punish me for

491
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:51,890
a mistake I made years ago.

492
00:23:51,932 --> 00:23:55,519
Is that what you think of me? I'm a mistake?

493
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:58,730
That's what you need to hear, yeah.

494
00:23:58,856 --> 00:24:02,234
That's what I think.

495
00:24:04,278 --> 00:24:06,280
Oh, Addy!

496
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:09,116
Addy! Oh!

497
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,577
Oh, are you okay?

498
00:24:11,827 --> 00:24:13,203
I'm good, baby.

499
00:24:13,495 --> 00:24:16,331
The kids are on their way over.

500
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:20,711
Hi. I'M... carol.

501
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:24,464
You are...

502
00:24:25,048 --> 00:24:28,010
do you wanna tell her, or should I?

503
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,519
I'm your husband's guardian angel.

504
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,730
Excuse me?

505
00:24:39,813 --> 00:24:41,857
My name's Susan.

506
00:24:42,024 --> 00:24:44,067
I was buying some horse feed when

507
00:24:44,193 --> 00:24:47,070
Mr. Prudy had an attack behind the counter.

508
00:24:47,154 --> 00:24:49,114
I gave him C.P.R., Called 9-1-1.

509
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:52,868
Oh! Thank you.

510
00:24:53,035 --> 00:24:55,245
Thank you.

511
00:24:55,996 --> 00:24:59,917
When I think what--what could have happened...

512
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:03,295
well, I'm gonna get out of here.

513
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,796
Mr. Prudy, I want you to hurry up

514
00:25:04,963 --> 00:25:07,549
and get back on your feet.

515
00:25:08,091 --> 00:25:10,344
I'm not giving up.

516
00:25:10,427 --> 00:25:12,054
I'm gonna be back in the store next week.

517
00:25:12,304 --> 00:25:15,974
I never got that darn horse feed.

518
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:19,019
I guess I'll put a bag aside for you.

519
00:25:19,144 --> 00:25:21,313
You do that.

520
00:25:44,545 --> 00:25:45,754
Bree, It's me.

521
00:25:45,879 --> 00:25:47,673
The police are at my house.
They're going through my stuff.

522
00:25:47,798 --> 00:25:49,508
What the hell is going on?

523
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:51,844
Look, I know you're there. Pick up!

524
00:25:51,969 --> 00:25:53,637
Did you have anything to do with this?

525
00:25:53,762 --> 00:25:56,849
Bree? Bree!

526
00:25:58,267 --> 00:26:02,479
George, I know what you did to dr. Goldfine,

527
00:26:02,604 --> 00:26:05,065
and I can see now just how sick you really are,

528
00:26:05,065 --> 00:26:07,568
so please just turn yourself in,

529
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:11,989
and that way you can get the help you really need.

530
00:26:12,656 --> 00:26:14,658
George?

531
00:26:35,596 --> 00:26:36,930
What's going on?

532
00:26:37,055 --> 00:26:40,517
Oh, I invited sister Mary Hotpants over for lunch.

533
00:26:40,684 --> 00:26:41,435
What?

534
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,477
You said she touched your soul,

535
00:26:42,561 --> 00:26:46,023
so I just want to make sure her hands are clean.

536
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:50,319
so, sister Mary, tell me,

537
00:26:50,444 --> 00:26:52,362
what's it like meeting men in prison?

538
00:26:52,571 --> 00:26:55,866
Do you bond with all convicts, or was Carlos just special?

539
00:26:55,991 --> 00:26:58,410
Well, of course, Carlos is special,

540
00:26:58,535 --> 00:27:01,914
but our mission does a ton of
evangelical work with several prisons.

541
00:27:02,164 --> 00:27:02,915
Oh, I get it.

542
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,293
Sort of like, today's convict is tomorrow's convert.

543
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:07,711
Something like that,

544
00:27:07,836 --> 00:27:09,796
but mostly I do charity work.

545
00:27:09,922 --> 00:27:12,090
Are you two involved in any charities?

546
00:27:12,174 --> 00:27:14,843
Currently? No.

547
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:17,930
But we should be. I mean, let's face it, Gaby.

548
00:27:18,055 --> 00:27:20,557
Buying more stuff isn't gonna make our lives any better.

549
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:22,017
Exactly.

550
00:27:22,184 --> 00:27:24,603
Money can't buy happiness.

551
00:27:24,728 --> 00:27:25,854
Well, sure it can.

552
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:27,022
That's just a lie we tell poor people

553
00:27:27,105 --> 00:27:29,149
to keep 'em from rioting.- Gaby!

554
00:27:29,358 --> 00:27:31,360
It's a joke. Lighten up.

555
00:27:31,527 --> 00:27:33,946
Can you believe this?
I'm married to a woman so selfish,

556
00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:36,573
she makes fun of the entire concept of charity.

557
00:27:36,698 --> 00:27:37,950
You are a hypocrite.

558
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,618
The money you spent to buy your sports car

559
00:27:39,743 --> 00:27:42,287
could buy a mud hut for every peasant in Ecuador.

560
00:27:42,412 --> 00:27:43,539
Okay, you're right.

561
00:27:43,622 --> 00:27:47,000
But I'm evolving, starting right now.

562
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:50,337
Sister, I would like to donate my car to your mission.

563
00:27:50,462 --> 00:27:51,171
What?

564
00:27:51,296 --> 00:27:54,466
- Carlos, are you sure?
- Absolutely.

565
00:27:54,591 --> 00:27:56,802
Gabrielle and I don't need two cars. We can share one.

566
00:27:56,927 --> 00:28:00,305
Share? What if you have the car,
and I need to go shopping?

567
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:02,599
We're gonna cut back on shopping, too.

568
00:28:02,808 --> 00:28:05,561
Okay, I think we should all just calm down a little bit.

569
00:28:05,686 --> 00:28:07,437
I'm gonna get you that pink slip right now.

570
00:28:07,604 --> 00:28:10,607
- Carlos...
- we're doing this.

571
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:15,070
I have to--ahem. Uh, here have some of this.

572
00:28:15,195 --> 00:28:17,614
No one needs to know.

573
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:24,746
Don't even bother. You're not talking me out of this.

574
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,915
I'm not here to talk you out of anything.

575
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,668
Check in this drawer.

576
00:28:32,171 --> 00:28:35,174
Carlos, I wanna apologize for the way I've been acting.

577
00:28:35,424 --> 00:28:38,010
I mean, here you are trying to turn your life around,

578
00:28:38,135 --> 00:28:42,514
and all I can think about are my stupid jealousy issues.

579
00:28:42,806 --> 00:28:44,850
Yeah, well, let's just get back down there.

580
00:28:44,975 --> 00:28:47,102
No, I mean it. I'm sorry.

581
00:28:47,227 --> 00:28:49,980
I wanna be a better person, too.

582
00:28:50,147 --> 00:28:53,609
I'm sick of being bad.

583
00:28:53,901 --> 00:28:56,570
Forgive me?

584
00:28:56,737 --> 00:28:57,863
You're not a bad person.

585
00:28:57,988 --> 00:28:59,907
Really?

586
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,952
No, of course not.

587
00:29:04,077 --> 00:29:06,538
That's so sweet.

588
00:29:06,663 --> 00:29:10,250
I feel so close to you right now.

589
00:29:11,335 --> 00:29:12,085
Gaby.

590
00:29:12,252 --> 00:29:17,508
I'm sorry. Guess I am bad.

591
00:29:17,633 --> 00:29:21,678
Look, we got a nun downstairs.

592
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:26,642
She can wait five minutes. We're giving her a car.

593
00:29:41,824 --> 00:29:42,825
Hey, Pat, what's going on?

594
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,284
I'm not sure.

595
00:29:44,451 --> 00:29:46,954
Ed keeps calling people into his office.

596
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:48,831
I think people are getting fired.

597
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:51,250
Lynette.

598
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:53,085
Yeah.

599
00:30:01,134 --> 00:30:02,636
Lynette...

600
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:04,263
Nina's out. You're in.

601
00:30:04,388 --> 00:30:06,515
You are our new V.P. Of accounts.

602
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,600
I... am?

603
00:30:08,725 --> 00:30:09,685
I just gave her the ax,

604
00:30:09,768 --> 00:30:11,478
along with a bunch of other people.

605
00:30:11,603 --> 00:30:13,272
Why? What happened?

606
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,691
Our old pal Stu just filed a sexual harassment

607
00:30:15,774 --> 00:30:17,901
suit against the company.

608
00:30:18,026 --> 00:30:19,653
He did what?

609
00:30:19,736 --> 00:30:21,697
He fired a fancy lawyer who threatened
to go to the press.

610
00:30:21,822 --> 00:30:23,532
I had no choice but to pay him off.

611
00:30:23,657 --> 00:30:28,162
He had a video of him and Nina together.

612
00:30:28,287 --> 00:30:32,207
Okay. I... get Nina, but

613
00:30:32,332 --> 00:30:34,459
why are you firing everybody else?

614
00:30:34,626 --> 00:30:36,128
Stu's taking us to the cleaners.

615
00:30:36,253 --> 00:30:37,629
If I don't cut back on staff,

616
00:30:37,754 --> 00:30:40,674
the next round of pay checks are gonna bounce.

617
00:30:40,757 --> 00:30:44,720
Oh, god, ed. I am so sorry.

618
00:30:44,887 --> 00:30:47,723
Well, it's not your fault. We'll get through this.

619
00:30:47,806 --> 00:30:52,144
You and me together.

620
00:30:52,436 --> 00:30:54,271
Oh, can you run down to the art department?

621
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:56,899
Someone's gotta can Jeff and Elizabeth.

622
00:30:57,024 --> 00:31:01,820
Yeah. Sure. I'm gonna go and take care of that.

623
00:31:02,988 --> 00:31:05,991
Hey. Congratulations.

624
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,078
This...is not what I wanted.

625
00:31:10,204 --> 00:31:12,289
I just wanted you to be nicer.

626
00:31:12,414 --> 00:31:16,752
You know what? I used to be nice. But

627
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,548
our boss--I'm sorry. Your boss...

628
00:31:21,673 --> 00:31:24,343
is incompetent and selfish

629
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:27,763
and has the attention span of a poodle.

630
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:30,974
I mean, from day one,
I have been the only one around here

631
00:31:31,058 --> 00:31:32,684
keeping this place from crumbling down

632
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:34,394
around his stupid ears.

633
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,313
Oh, Nina, come on.

634
00:31:36,438 --> 00:31:38,440
This is the truth here.

635
00:31:38,565 --> 00:31:42,194
Nice is a luxury that I gave up

636
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:46,782
along with vacations and relationships

637
00:31:46,907 --> 00:31:48,700
and eating at home.

638
00:31:48,826 --> 00:31:52,412
This job sucks you dry.

639
00:31:52,621 --> 00:31:55,624
So you better kiss those four little kiddies
of yours good-bye

640
00:31:55,749 --> 00:31:57,543
because you have just adopted

641
00:31:57,709 --> 00:32:02,172
the neediest little child in the world.

642
00:32:02,422 --> 00:32:03,340
Here.

643
00:32:03,465 --> 00:32:06,593
You're gonna need this more than I do.

644
00:32:18,313 --> 00:32:20,023
Hi.

645
00:32:20,148 --> 00:32:22,025
Carlos will be down in a little while.

646
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:24,778
We had an intense talk.

647
00:32:24,903 --> 00:32:26,446
He's resting.

648
00:32:26,572 --> 00:32:30,951
Yeah, I overheard some of your... talk.

649
00:32:31,076 --> 00:32:34,705
Sorry. He's such an animal

650
00:32:34,913 --> 00:32:36,165
but since we have a couple of minutes,

651
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:39,668
why don't we, uh, chat?

652
00:32:44,923 --> 00:32:46,842
Look, I don't mean any disrespect.

653
00:32:46,967 --> 00:32:49,261
It's just, now that Carlos is home,

654
00:32:49,386 --> 00:32:51,555
we need to get back on our routine,

655
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,932
and we can't do that if he keeps running off to church

656
00:32:54,099 --> 00:32:56,518
and charity bake sales.

657
00:32:56,643 --> 00:33:00,105
We need "us" time. Do you know what I mean?

658
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:01,148
I do.

659
00:33:01,273 --> 00:33:03,525
Oh, good. Good.

660
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:05,694
So it would really help our marriage

661
00:33:05,819 --> 00:33:11,575
if you just backed off for a while, okay?

662
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,285
No.

663
00:33:13,494 --> 00:33:15,078
Huh?

664
00:33:15,204 --> 00:33:17,122
I said no.

665
00:33:17,664 --> 00:33:21,251
I know what you said. I'm wondering why you said it.

666
00:33:21,376 --> 00:33:23,629
Carlos is a diamond in the rough,

667
00:33:23,754 --> 00:33:24,922
a flawed man to be sure,

668
00:33:25,047 --> 00:33:27,216
but someone who is desperately searching

669
00:33:27,341 --> 00:33:29,009
for something to believe in.

670
00:33:29,343 --> 00:33:31,970
To satisfy your materialism,
he ended up breaking the law.

671
00:33:32,095 --> 00:33:35,015
To deal with your adultery, he resorted to assault.

672
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,099
As long as he's with you,

673
00:33:36,225 --> 00:33:38,227
he will never find what he's looking for.

674
00:33:38,393 --> 00:33:39,895
Well, I guess he should have thought of that

675
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,855
before he married me.

676
00:33:41,939 --> 00:33:45,567
Some marriages are meant to be annulled.

677
00:33:45,692 --> 00:33:48,403
What the hell kind of nun are you?

678
00:33:48,487 --> 00:33:50,447
Look, if you try to come between me and my husband,

679
00:33:50,572 --> 00:33:52,699
I will take you down.

680
00:33:53,242 --> 00:33:55,661
I grew up on the south side of Chicago.

681
00:33:55,702 --> 00:33:56,453
If you wanna threaten me,

682
00:33:56,537 --> 00:33:58,580
you're gonna have to do a lot better than that.

683
00:33:58,747 --> 00:34:01,625
You listen to me, you little bitch.

684
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:04,878
You do not want to start a war with me.

685
00:34:05,879 --> 00:34:08,590
well, I have god on my side.

686
00:34:08,757 --> 00:34:12,636
Bring it on.

687
00:34:31,196 --> 00:34:32,156
you called for a bellman?

688
00:34:32,281 --> 00:34:34,658
There's a charity dinner taking place downstairs.

689
00:34:34,741 --> 00:34:37,786
My friend Bree van de Kamp is one of the co-chairs.

690
00:34:37,911 --> 00:34:40,289
Give her this note and walk away.

691
00:34:40,372 --> 00:34:44,376
If she comes up in the elevator, call me.

692
00:34:44,501 --> 00:34:46,628
You think you can do that?

693
00:34:46,753 --> 00:34:49,173
Yes, sir.

694
00:34:52,885 --> 00:34:54,511
- Excuse me, ma'am?
- Yes

695
00:34:54,636 --> 00:34:55,888
I was asked to give this to you.

696
00:34:56,013 --> 00:34:57,681
Oh, thank you.

697
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:13,780
Barton.

698
00:35:13,906 --> 00:35:15,365
Hello, detective Barton. This is Bree van de Kamp.

699
00:35:15,491 --> 00:35:16,783
I need to talk to you about George Williams.

700
00:35:16,909 --> 00:35:18,702
Yeah, I was just getting ready to call you,
Mrs. Van de Kamp.

701
00:35:19,828 --> 00:35:21,538
My men are at his house right now,

702
00:35:21,705 --> 00:35:24,666
and they've uncovered evidence that suggests

703
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:28,962
Mr. Williams was responsible
for your husband's death.

704
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,673
- What? - Yeah, we found

705
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,217
Rex's prescription bottles

706
00:35:33,342 --> 00:35:35,969
and doctored potassium pills

707
00:35:36,094 --> 00:35:41,975
as well as some disturbing diary entries.

708
00:35:43,352 --> 00:35:46,146
Mrs. Van de Kamp?

709
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:59,243
Hello, sir.

710
00:35:59,368 --> 00:36:03,038
Yes. She's, uh, on her way up.

711
00:36:03,163 --> 00:36:05,499
Thank you very much.

712
00:36:11,004 --> 00:36:13,257
She loves me.

713
00:36:14,675 --> 00:36:16,301
She loves me not.

714
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:27,688
She loves me.

715
00:36:31,817 --> 00:36:32,901
she loves me not.

716
00:36:41,201 --> 00:36:44,079
She loves me.

717
00:37:25,537 --> 00:37:27,748
operator,

718
00:37:27,873 --> 00:37:30,292
this is a bit embarrassing, but I've...

719
00:37:30,459 --> 00:37:32,419
I've swallowed some pills by mistake.

720
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:34,922
I think you need to call an ambulance.

721
00:37:36,215 --> 00:37:39,593
uh, uh, uh, they were--

722
00:37:39,718 --> 00:37:42,262
they were just vitamins

723
00:37:42,513 --> 00:37:45,974
see? False alarm. I'm fine.

724
00:37:46,475 --> 00:37:47,851
Door's open.

725
00:37:59,822 --> 00:38:01,532
Hey.

726
00:38:04,952 --> 00:38:08,539
What were you thinking, taking the pills?

727
00:38:08,664 --> 00:38:11,959
I didn't hurt dr. Goldfine.

728
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:14,044
And for you to...

729
00:38:14,294 --> 00:38:17,464
think me capable of...

730
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:20,384
that sort of...

731
00:38:22,678 --> 00:38:24,429
violence...

732
00:38:24,555 --> 00:38:26,640
George.

733
00:38:29,643 --> 00:38:31,562
George.

734
00:38:33,814 --> 00:38:36,483
I'm sorry. It's the pills.

735
00:38:36,692 --> 00:38:38,360
Why are you telling me this?

736
00:38:38,485 --> 00:38:41,238
Because maybe I don't have to die.

737
00:38:41,822 --> 00:38:44,032
I could face the police

738
00:38:44,158 --> 00:38:47,202
knowing that you would be there for me...

739
00:38:48,328 --> 00:38:50,873
that you'd stay my friend.

740
00:38:52,249 --> 00:38:55,294
Then I'll have something to live for.

741
00:38:55,419 --> 00:38:59,882
And then we'll call an ambulance
and they'll pump your stomach.

742
00:39:00,007 --> 00:39:02,467
Yes.

743
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:21,111
I want to help you,

744
00:39:21,487 --> 00:39:24,990
but in order to do that,
I need to forgive you, and...

745
00:39:25,782 --> 00:39:29,745
I can't do that until you admit what you've done.

746
00:39:31,413 --> 00:39:35,209
I didn't push gold fine.

747
00:39:35,542 --> 00:39:37,586
Yes, you did.

748
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,257
But that's not what I'm talking about.

749
00:39:43,926 --> 00:39:46,845
You killed Rex.

750
00:39:47,846 --> 00:39:49,932
But I know it wasn't totally your fault

751
00:39:50,057 --> 00:39:52,809
because you're not well.

752
00:39:53,143 --> 00:39:57,397
So if you'll just be honest with me,

753
00:39:57,648 --> 00:40:00,275
I can forgive you.

754
00:40:00,651 --> 00:40:02,611
It'll be the hardest thing I've ever done,

755
00:40:02,778 --> 00:40:05,280
but I'll do it.

756
00:40:05,447 --> 00:40:11,537
But you have to--you have to tell me the truth.

757
00:40:13,831 --> 00:40:17,084
look, I'm in trouble here.

758
00:40:17,209 --> 00:40:18,669
We need to call someone.

759
00:40:18,836 --> 00:40:22,256
Not until you admit what you've done.

760
00:40:24,466 --> 00:40:27,135
I love you.

761
00:40:28,262 --> 00:40:32,015
Anything I may have done, I did for you.

762
00:40:34,309 --> 00:40:36,770
Because you wanted me to.

763
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:43,569
You know you did.

764
00:41:00,586 --> 00:41:03,422
we need to call the ambulance.

765
00:41:06,717 --> 00:41:11,763
I... called them while you were asleep.

766
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:16,810
They're already on their way.

767
00:41:41,168 --> 00:41:44,087
It's not always that easy to distinguish

768
00:41:44,213 --> 00:41:47,633
the good guys from the bad guys.

769
00:41:47,758 --> 00:41:50,969
Sinners can surprise you.

770
00:41:51,929 --> 00:41:57,351
And the same is true for saints.

771
00:41:57,726 --> 00:42:03,815
Why do we try to define people
as simply good or simply evil?

772
00:42:04,233 --> 00:42:08,612
Because no one wants to admit that
compassion and cruelty

773
00:42:08,779 --> 00:42:13,742
can live side by side in one heart...

774
00:42:20,374 --> 00:42:26,380
and that anyone is capable of anything.
