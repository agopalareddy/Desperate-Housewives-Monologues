00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,088
previously on Desperate Housewives

3
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:06,173
I'm gonna die,

4
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:08,800
and I'd like to know
what happened to my daughterbefore I do.

5
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:10,802
When it comes to wisteria lane,

6
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:12,721
there are old crimes...

7
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:17,142
new crimes...

8
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:20,270
as soon as it gets dark,we get rid
of that body.

9
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,481
And crimes that are happening...

10
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,277
right under everyone's nose.

11
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,321
I'm thinkingit's the applewhites.

12
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:36,912
Jim halverson was aware
that he had little to offer a woman.

13
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:40,707
He was neither rich,nor smart,nor handsome.

14
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,751
Are you jim?I'm susan mayer.

15
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:47,548
So when his friend set him up on a blind date
with a beautiful stranger...

16
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:50,968
wow,you're so much hotterthan nikki said you'd be.

17
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:52,719
How old are you?

18
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:54,304
How olddo you think I am?

19
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:57,516
Jim made the tragic decision to try to be funny.

20
00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:59,768
Not a day over 50.

21
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:02,771
why don't weget our table?

22
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,606
Well,no,see,that was funny,

23
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,525
because you'reso obviously not 50.

24
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:08,402
That's why I said 50,'cause it's absurd.

25
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:12,155
Jim did everything he could to get
susan mayer to laugh.

26
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,199
He tried racial humor...

27
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:17,160
so guess what time chinesepeople
go to the dentist?

28
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:18,787
2:30.

29
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,125
uh,get it?"Tooth-hurty?"

30
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:25,002
Tooth-hurty.

31
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:26,587
I love that.

32
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:29,214
He tried to be engagingly risqu?..

33
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,258
rectum?Damn near killed him!

34
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:36,680
you know whata rectum is,right?

35
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:42,102
he even tried gentle teasing.

36
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:45,105
No,no,you see,by comparing you to a nazi,

37
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:48,483
I was making the pointthat you're
so not a nazi.

38
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,735
-You're like the--
-and just when jim

39
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:52,446
thought the date couldn't get any worse....

40
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,493
...It did.

41
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:01,371
Okay,jim,I need you to look up...

42
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,957
and down.

43
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,001
All right,so,how did this happen?

44
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:07,085
It was an accident.

45
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,337
Oh,I don't knowabout that.

46
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:11,423
In some cultureshead-butting is
a mating ritual.

47
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:15,886
Dr. Mccready,can italk to you
about my head?

48
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:19,306
Away from...the draft?

49
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,518
you can call medr. Ron. Everyone does.

50
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:24,061
dr. Ron...

51
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,023
I need you to pretendthere's something
wrong with me and admit me for the night.

52
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:28,941
I'm sorry?

53
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:31,109
This is the worst dateI have ever
been on in my life.

54
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:34,196
That man is the most obnoxious,
offensive,annoying human being.

55
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:35,948
And you're looking at melike
I'm crazy right now,

56
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:37,783
but I will be if I spendone more
second with him.

57
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:39,535
So you gotta help me.You gotta do something.

58
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:41,495
It's my mental health.My mental health!

59
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,080
You took an oath.

60
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,166
Could you let goof my lapel,please?

61
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:48,961
Oh,sorry.

62
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,130
Um,listen,I'm sorryyour date's
not going well.

63
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,383
But I can'tadmit you,susan.

64
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,094
Right. Right.

65
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,431
Jim,let's,uh,let's takea look at
those reflexes.

66
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,809
Okay,I got a jokefor you,doctor.

67
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:07,354
What's the correct medical term
for the circumcisionof a rabbit?

68
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,940
Hare cut.

69
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,652
I don't--I always--

70
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:17,322
jim,I'm gonna needto keep you here
for awhile,run some tests.

71
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,490
Really? I--

72
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,450
yeah,I'm still worried about
that bump on your head here.

73
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,994
That's still...

74
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,412
and,susan,

75
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,372
you're good to go.

76
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,499
And though it only lasted a moment,

77
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:31,461
jim caught the look that passed
between his date...

78
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,255
and his doctor.

79
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:35,841
Thank you so much,dr. Ron.

80
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:38,343
And he suddenly got the feeling

81
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:41,388
the joke was on him.

Desperate Housewives
Season 02 Episode 12

85
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:29,478
The annual blood drive was
a tradition on wisteria lane.

86
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,732
Most residents came to help
promote health and well-being,

87
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:38,237
but my friends turned up
for a different reason.

88
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,989
They were growing
increasingly concerned

89
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:45,911
that their street was infected
with a dangerous kind of sickness.

90
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:50,249
And they came to consult
with one another about a possible cure.

91
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,960
great,
she caught me staring.

92
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,587
Have you guys noticed
how friendly betty's been

93
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:57,548
since that body was found
in front of her house?

94
00:04:57,548 --> 00:04:59,049
I don't trust
friendly women.

95
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,176
That's okay.
They don't trust you,either.

96
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,513
I just know those two have
something to do with that dead body.

97
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,181
Do we even know
who he is?

98
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:09,184
Well,the paper said the police
are withholding the details.

99
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:11,937
Bree,maybe you should call in a favor
from your police detective pal,

100
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:12,688
have him poke around.

101
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:14,189
That's a great idea.

102
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:16,608
You could have him do a background
check on the applewhites.

103
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,610
I don't think
I can do that.

104
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,279
Why not?
You said he was nice.

105
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:24,366
Well,once he stopped suspecting me of
murdering rex he was delightful,but,um...

106
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,326
I don't really know him.

107
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,620
Well,somebody has to do something,
'cause I'm losing sleep.

108
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,038
Betty! Matthew.

109
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:32,207
Hello,everybody.

110
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:36,128
Susan,a little birdie told me
you're having a birthday soon.

111
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:38,338
We should all go out
and celebrate.

112
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:39,965
Super.

113
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:41,049
Sounds like a plan.

114
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,050
Count me in.

115
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:44,011
bye.

116
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,137
See ya.

117
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:48,140
So why are you everybody's
best friend all of a sudden?

118
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,350
If there was ever
a time to be neighborly,

119
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,727
this is it.

120
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:53,187
We're idiots for staying here.

121
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:56,565
I mean,we should've hit the road
as soon as they found monroe's body.

122
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:59,067
I mean,how do we know he didn't tell
foster where we're hiding?

123
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,486
Because if he had,foster
would've shown up by now.

124
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,031
And besides,if we take off,
what are we gonna live on?

125
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,908
I have all of our money
tied up in this house.

126
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:07,409
So why not
just sell it?

127
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:08,911
Patience,matthew.

128
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:10,287
If we take off right away,

129
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:11,788
it'll look suspicious.

130
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,583
Now what we need
is a story--

131
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,502
a reason for us to move.

132
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:22,841
Look at this,a-b negative.

133
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:25,427
Yeah,it's the rarest
of all blood types.

134
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:27,596
Well,there must be something
in the water around these parts.

135
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:29,598
You're my second
a-b negative today.

136
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:30,724
Seriously?

137
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:33,268
Uh,who was it?

138
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:35,437
That guy.

139
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:49,159
Hi,bree.

140
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,202
Oh,hi.

141
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:53,580
I just wanted to thank you
for your advice on my azaleas.

142
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,082
They're just thriving.

143
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,875
Oh,it was
no trouble at all.

144
00:06:57,042 --> 00:07:00,045
Such a shame I may not
be around to enjoy them.

145
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:03,257
Well,my mother has taken ill.

146
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:04,633
And matthew and I,

147
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:06,385
we'll probably go and visit her.

148
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:08,470
We may even be moving.

149
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,222
We just don't know yet.

150
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:13,183
Oh,well,
where does she live?

151
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:15,018
Oh,back in chicago.

152
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:17,771
Is it serious?

153
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:20,440
I-I don't know yet.

154
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,820
Well,obviously,I'll be
speaking with her doctor.

155
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,990
Oh,betty,if there's anything I can do,
anything at all...

156
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,408
thank you.

157
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:31,743
You've already
done so much.

158
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:34,162
Bye.

159
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:44,798
That dr. Ron called.

160
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,884
He needs to see you
for a follow-up appointment.

161
00:07:46,884 --> 00:07:49,094
He needs to see me
or he wants to see me?

162
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:51,096
Jeez,mom,how cute
is this guy?

163
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:52,514
Oh,he could be cuter...

164
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,725
but I don't know how.

165
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,268
So ask him out.

166
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,645
Oh,no,
I can't do that.

167
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,356
Mom,he's a cute surgeon.
What's the problem?

168
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:02,941
He's young.

169
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:04,359
Young?

170
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:05,944
Younger than me.

171
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:07,362
How much younger?

172
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:10,616
Let's just say if I was
a senior in high school,

173
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:13,493
I'd be saying,"wow,
you're a hot fifth grader."

174
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,163
Oh,well,of course it's gonna sound
gross if you say it that way.

175
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,999
But you're both adults.So why not
just ask him out?

176
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,335
'Cause the conversation
could go something like this,

177
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:23,921
"dr. Ron,I think you're hot."

178
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:25,672
"Oh,well,thank you,ma'am.

179
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:28,675
"Now I think it's time we talk
about your hip replacement."

180
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,678
Mom,you're hot

181
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,972
and funny and nice.

182
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:37,309
And... clearly desperate,
and guys are into that.

183
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,145
Play to your strengths.

184
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:51,949
Thank god you're home.

185
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:53,909
What's wrong? Pat said youtold
her it was an emergency!

186
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,994
The boys weresent home from school.

187
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:59,581
What? Why? I called.The machine kept picking up.

188
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,291
I know. I know.Look,I...

189
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:04,086
they've got chicken pox.

190
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:07,047
Chicken pox?That's the emergency?

191
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,674
They'retotally contagious.

192
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:09,883
Not to us.

193
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,718
They are to me!I've never had it.

194
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,220
Well,you nevertold me that.

195
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,806
You know,the point is,I can't go in there.

196
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:17,349
It's a hot zone.

197
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:20,477
Well,tom,somebody'sgotta take care
of our kids.

198
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:21,603
Exactly.

199
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,188
And since you're immune--

200
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:25,315
oh,you've gotta be kidding!I have
to get back to work!

201
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,192
Just for a couple of days,until
they're not contagious.

202
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:29,570
It is not the ebola virus.It's chicken pox.

203
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,405
You are being a baby.

204
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:32,781
Yes,I am.

205
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:33,699
Okay.

206
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:35,868
And if you thinkI'm being a baby now,

207
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:38,871
do I need to remind youof what
I'm like when I'm sick?

208
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,374
Remember that timeI had strep throat?

209
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:45,544
We wound upin marriage counseling.

210
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:48,714
I'll call the office.

211
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:53,135
Thanks,honey.

212
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,804
Uh,mrs. Solis,I gotta talk to you.

213
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:58,432
Ralph,if this is about luis
overwateringthe hydrangeas again,

214
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:01,435
I told you,
no one likes a tattletale.

215
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:02,769
My wife left me.

216
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:05,272
Oh,I'm sorry.

217
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:08,150
I didn't know you and bonitawere
having problems.

218
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,234
We weren't.

219
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:11,820
Uh,it was all of a sudden.
She just packed her bagsand left.

220
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,281
She said I have an illness,
and I need to get help.

221
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:16,241
Why?

222
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:19,870
There's nothingwrong with me.I just
like to look atpretty ladies on the internet.

223
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,540
And sure,they're not always dressed,

224
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,501
and sometimes,there's more than one.

225
00:10:25,918 --> 00:10:28,295
But I only go tothe classy web sites.

226
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:31,006
There's some really sick stuffout there,
mrs. Solis.

227
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:31,840
Ralph!

228
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,175
Make your point.

229
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:36,386
Um,last night,uh,I found this new web site.

230
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:38,764
And there wasa picture of a lady
sitting on a bearskin rug

231
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:42,100
with nothing on except for a little
pointyelf hat. It was very festive.

232
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:45,562
Uh,ralph,why are youtelling me this?

233
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,940
I'm sorry.It's just,um...

234
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,360
ahem. I think you reallyneed to see this.

235
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,240
Oh,my god!

236
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:58,617
The lighting looks greaton you,mrs. Solis.

237
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:01,912
I mean,most of the time,you have to squint
at the screen to see anything really good.

238
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:04,623
And not here,no,sir,that's good.

239
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:08,669
Well,um,thank you,ralph,
for bringing thisto my attention.

240
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:11,755
Uh,mrs. Solis,I was wondering...

241
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,715
would you sign that for me?

242
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:17,177
Oh,okay.

243
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:37,656
where have you been?

244
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:41,034
Why didn't you cometo see me?

245
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,287
I came every sunday.

246
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:45,706
You were just too out of it to
know I was here.

247
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:48,041
I think you're lying.

248
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:53,630
But then again,these days,
I think everyone'sbeen lying to me.

249
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,009
The thing is,you're here now.

250
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,680
So tell mewhat I wanna know.

251
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,934
Did you find the manwho killed my daughter?

252
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:18,280
It was a guy namedtodd forrest--

253
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:21,283
this lowlife drug dealer.

254
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:23,076
He got her hooked again.

255
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:26,079
She tried to steal from him,and he killed her.

256
00:12:27,623 --> 00:12:29,041
And I killed him.

257
00:12:36,632 --> 00:12:38,717
I thought hearing thatwould make you happy.

258
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,303
I thought it would,too.

259
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,056
But it doesn't.

260
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:49,478
I'm sorry.

261
00:12:50,229 --> 00:12:52,856
I wanna start your I.V.,But your
veins are kinda bad.

262
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:54,733
Well,here,let me help you.

263
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:58,237
What the hellare you doing?

264
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,447
You're crazy!

265
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,991
You're fired.Get out.

266
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,626
So I guesswe're done then?

267
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:14,962
Yeah.

268
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,467
You,uh...

269
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,971
you gonna come see me again?

270
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,100
You planning on havingan open casket?

271
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:48,328
Hey,guys.

272
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:49,997
Hi,lynette.

273
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:51,248
Hi,carlos.

274
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:53,959
All right! A reuben?How sweet is that?

275
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:56,086
Lunch brought rightto the golf course.

276
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:58,130
I hear you got somepretty
sick kids in there.

277
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,590
Oh,it's justchicken pox.

278
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:02,593
But braveheart here will onlycome
in to sleep and shower.

279
00:14:02,593 --> 00:14:03,927
I can't say I blame him.

280
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:05,470
I wouldn't want to beshooting blanks either.

281
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,639
Be well,my man,

282
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:08,557
Bye,lynette.

283
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:09,850
See you later.

284
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:13,562
I'm sorry,what did he mean,"shooting blanks"?

285
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:15,147
Oh,it's nothing.

286
00:14:15,147 --> 00:14:16,607
There's justa small chance

287
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:19,318
of sterility if a grown mangets
chicken pox,so...

288
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,154
we're not having any more kids.
Why would it matter?

289
00:14:22,154 --> 00:14:24,031
I don't know.You know,survival instinct?

290
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,035
So that if you're the last manto
survive a nuclear holocaust,

291
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:29,912
you could repopulatethe planet?

292
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:31,580
No,all I'm saying is that,

293
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,707
god forbid something wereto
happen to either one of us,

294
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:36,627
I'd want either one of usto have,you know,options.

295
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:42,883
So you're sayingthat if I died...

296
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:46,136
you would want a second wifeand a family?

297
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:48,055
Maybe.

298
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:51,642
I can't believe you'veactually
thought about this!

299
00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:52,809
Haven't you?

300
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,312
Thought about who I'd marryif you died?

301
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:56,730
Hmm. No.

302
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:59,816
Well,honey,it's a back-upplan.
I'm not gonna use it.

303
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,151
Then why have it?

304
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:03,195
Well,I don't know,because...

305
00:15:03,195 --> 00:15:05,781
it's like,there's this door,right?

306
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:08,617
And I'm not planning on
actuallygoing through it

307
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:11,328
because I'm so happyin the room
that I'm in.

308
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:14,957
But in case of fire or flood,

309
00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:18,126
it's comforting to knowthat
the door is unlocked.

310
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:20,838
Honey,I'm notthrough with that!

311
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:25,092
Yeah,well,why don't you have your
second wifemake you lunch,okay? Oops!

312
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:26,301
You...

313
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:30,681
bree,uh,

314
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:32,558
I have to say,I was,uh,

315
00:15:32,558 --> 00:15:34,434
I was very pleasedto get your call.

316
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:37,062
I mean,I'm surprised you'd wantto
have anything to do with me

317
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:39,439
given our recent history.

318
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:43,318
Oh,you mean your having suspected me
of murdering my husband?

319
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:46,029
Detective,that is allwater under
the bridge now.

320
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:48,866
I am very gladto hear you say that.

321
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:51,827
Although,I have to confess,I do
have an ulterior motive.

322
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:53,829
I need to ask you a favor.

323
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:56,748
Oh,well,shoot,whatever I can do.

324
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:59,168
We have these,um,new neighbors--
the applewhites.

325
00:15:59,168 --> 00:16:02,129
It's a mother and her son. They
just moved here from chicago.

326
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:04,339
And they seem very nice.
But there's--

327
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:06,466
there's something about themthat'S...

328
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:07,676
off.

329
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:08,760
They're...

330
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:10,387
odd.

331
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:11,305
Odd?

332
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:13,390
Yeah,they're secretiveand watchful.

333
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,767
And there was a dead bodyfound
in front of their house.

334
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:19,646
I can't run a background checkon
your neighbors for being odd.

335
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:25,110
Is that why youwanted to see me? To--

336
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:26,612
to ask me that?

337
00:16:26,612 --> 00:16:28,655
Yeah,why?

338
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:33,285
Well,I just--during the investigation,

339
00:16:33,285 --> 00:16:35,662
I just thought there wasa kind of a,um...

340
00:16:36,038 --> 00:16:37,748
spark between us.

341
00:16:37,748 --> 00:16:40,751
You know,I thoughtthis might be a date.

342
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:45,172
Uh,no.

343
00:16:45,756 --> 00:16:48,467
I just wanted to ask you a favor.

344
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:51,136
Fine,no harm done.

345
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:55,224
When do I ever getto have lunch
with sucha lovely lady anyway?

346
00:16:55,224 --> 00:16:57,017
Date or...

347
00:16:57,518 --> 00:16:59,478
no date.

348
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:02,648
Are you sure that you can'tcheck
on the applewhites?

349
00:17:02,648 --> 00:17:04,566
I mean,I just knowthat there's
something there.

350
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:07,653
And,you know,I havea sixth sense
about people.

351
00:17:07,653 --> 00:17:11,365
And yet,you got engaged to the man
who murdered your husband.

352
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:17,538
Well,your blood pressurelooks fine.

353
00:17:17,538 --> 00:17:19,373
You're free to go,mrs. Mayer.

354
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:21,959
You mean,I'm notgonna see dr. Ron?

355
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,544
Well,I do the follow-up exams.

356
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:25,879
Dr. Ron only comes inif there's a problem.

357
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:28,257
Oh,well,maybe I shouldgo ahead
and see him anyway,

358
00:17:28,257 --> 00:17:29,591
just to be safe.

359
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:30,425
I'm sorry.

360
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:32,886
Dr. Ron's scheduleis very tight today.

361
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:35,222
So unless you'rehaving a serious problem...

362
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:40,561
you're experiencing nausea,
chills and tingling,huh?

363
00:17:40,561 --> 00:17:41,520
Yeah,

364
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:42,855
but nowthat I think about it,

365
00:17:42,855 --> 00:17:44,398
I bet it's justall the coffee I drink.

366
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:46,358
I drink way too much coffee.

367
00:17:46,358 --> 00:17:48,443
Do you liketo drink coffee?

368
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,737
Uh,no.No.

369
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:53,073
So the tingling is inyour fingers
and your toes?

370
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:55,826
I should switch to juice.I know
the best juice place.

371
00:17:55,826 --> 00:17:58,245
You would love it.Do you drink juice?

372
00:17:59,955 --> 00:18:04,001
Susan,how oftenhave you been having
these involuntary muscle spasms?

373
00:18:04,877 --> 00:18:07,296
Oh,oh,not that often.

374
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:10,174
I probably just needa good massage.

375
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,718
Susan?

376
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:15,971
Yeah?

377
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:18,974
I wanna get you infor an M.R.I.

378
00:18:20,893 --> 00:18:22,895
no,I don't thinkthat's necessary.

379
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:24,021
Are you a doctor?

380
00:18:24,313 --> 00:18:27,566
I got high marksin math and science.

381
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30,694
I wanna get you infor an M.R.I.

382
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:39,870
No,no,no,I think giventhe misunderstanding

383
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,413
that I should get the bill.

384
00:18:41,413 --> 00:18:42,414
I won't hear of it.

385
00:18:42,414 --> 00:18:43,582
All right,

386
00:18:43,582 --> 00:18:45,125
we'll split it.

387
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,710
Fair enough.

388
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:51,215
You know what?

389
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:53,717
Let me,uh,let megive you a ride home.

390
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:59,264
Detective barton,is this somesort of high
school ployto get me back to your place?

391
00:19:00,057 --> 00:19:02,601
I just don't thinkyou should be
driving a car.You've been drinking.

392
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:04,645
I had two glasses of wine.

393
00:19:04,645 --> 00:19:07,523
Three,plus the tawny portwith dessert.

394
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:10,400
It's all here on the bill

395
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,027
if you wanna take a look.

396
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:13,070
You know what?

397
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,571
I politely rejected you,

398
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:17,199
and now you're getting your revenge
by embarrassing me.

399
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:19,660
You've had too much to drink.
Give me your keys.

400
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,995
I am not giving you anything.

401
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:25,541
Except the bill.

402
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:03,370
what do you thinkyou're doing?

403
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:05,664
I followed you to make sureyou were okay.

404
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:08,250
You were weaving.

405
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,127
Please step outof the car.

406
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:12,546
Oh,you can't be serious.

407
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:14,214
Out.

408
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:19,219
Detective,I am not drunk,and
I am not stupid.

409
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:21,847
I know exactlywhat this is all about.

410
00:20:21,847 --> 00:20:24,141
I'm gonna need you to takea sobriety test.

411
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:27,186
A sobriety test? I'm nottaking
any sobriety...

412
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:29,271
test.

413
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:34,943
This behavior stems fromthe hurt feelings
of a man withvery low self-esteem.

414
00:20:35,611 --> 00:20:37,070
The worldis a big place,

415
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:40,532
and I'm sure there isa woman out
there somewhere who'll respond to your

416
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:43,035
macho posturing.

417
00:20:44,286 --> 00:20:45,746
Well...

418
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:47,873
here's hoping.

419
00:20:56,715 --> 00:20:58,800
Baby,what you're about to see

420
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,595
will most likely shockand upset you.

421
00:21:02,054 --> 00:21:03,222
Okay.

422
00:21:03,722 --> 00:21:06,600
Remember scott,the photographer
I was dating when we met?

423
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,310
The one I dumped for you,

424
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,270
who never really got over it
and who I always said

425
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,605
was gonna get back at me?

426
00:21:15,234 --> 00:21:17,945
Oh,carlos,I love you so much.

427
00:21:17,945 --> 00:21:19,112
Move.

428
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:23,283
What is this?

429
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:24,993
Scott's web site,

430
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:27,579
with pictures of me on it.

431
00:21:32,084 --> 00:21:33,460
well,say something.

432
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:35,587
Oh,my god.

433
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:37,172
It wassupposed to be funny--

434
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:40,008
a naughty little christmas gift
for my boyfriend.

435
00:21:40,676 --> 00:21:42,219
Oh,my god!

436
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:46,765
I know,I was freakishlyflexible back then.

437
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:48,934
I'm sorry!

438
00:21:48,934 --> 00:21:50,978
Look,what are we gonna doabout this?

439
00:21:50,978 --> 00:21:53,021
I guessI'll call my lawyers.

440
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:55,941
I gave these pictures to himas a gift.
He owns them.

441
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:57,401
Then I guesswe're screwed.

442
00:21:57,401 --> 00:21:58,944
Not necessarily.

443
00:21:58,944 --> 00:22:00,320
See,here's what I'm thinking--

444
00:22:00,654 --> 00:22:02,197
scott's a coward,

445
00:22:02,197 --> 00:22:04,783
so you could totallyput the scare into him.

446
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:07,202
All you gotta dois go and rough him up,

447
00:22:07,202 --> 00:22:09,538
and he'll take my picturesoff
the web site like that.

448
00:22:09,538 --> 00:22:12,499
I'm sorry,but thisis your mistake.

449
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:14,376
You're gonna have tofix it yourself.

450
00:22:14,376 --> 00:22:15,460
And I would love to,

451
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,588
but I have the upper bodystrength
of a kitten.

452
00:22:17,588 --> 00:22:18,797
I need a brute!

453
00:22:18,797 --> 00:22:19,631
Gaby,

454
00:22:20,674 --> 00:22:23,886
I am just now starting
to get my rage issuesunder control.

455
00:22:24,887 --> 00:22:26,930
This brute doesn't swingthat way anymore,

456
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,223
so go find another.

457
00:22:29,808 --> 00:22:32,895
Well,when you left prison,
did they leave youa contact list?

458
00:22:43,197 --> 00:22:45,240
So is dr. Ron gonnabe here for this?

459
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,533
Oh,yeah,yeah,yeah.

460
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:48,243
Uh,there's a hookon the wall there

461
00:22:48,243 --> 00:22:49,828
so go aheadand get your stuff hung up

462
00:22:49,828 --> 00:22:52,539
and,uh,just get comfy. Dr. Ronshould
be here pretty soon.

463
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:53,749
Okay.Okay.

464
00:23:09,348 --> 00:23:11,225
is she tryingto put on the dust cover?

465
00:23:12,142 --> 00:23:12,935
yep.

466
00:23:18,649 --> 00:23:20,067
How long are we gonna let this go on?

467
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:21,777
Just a fewmore minutes.

468
00:23:22,861 --> 00:23:24,112
Hi,uh,susan?

469
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:25,614
It's dr. Ron.

470
00:23:27,658 --> 00:23:29,660
You don't have toget undressed for this.

471
00:23:30,911 --> 00:23:33,205
Oh,uh,I-I,uh...

472
00:23:33,205 --> 00:23:34,957
then why did youput out a gown?

473
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:38,043
No,no,it's not a gown.

474
00:23:38,043 --> 00:23:40,796
It's the dust coverfor the M.R.I. Machine.

475
00:23:45,092 --> 00:23:46,677
This should takeabout 45 minutes.

476
00:23:46,677 --> 00:23:49,263
Now I know it's really crampedand
uncomfortable in there,

477
00:23:49,263 --> 00:23:50,514
but try not to move.

478
00:23:51,557 --> 00:23:54,893
Susan,I realizethat this whole process
must be troubling for you.

479
00:23:55,561 --> 00:23:57,354
Yeah,it's prettytroubling.

480
00:23:58,105 --> 00:24:00,524
Well,we're gonna getto the bottom of this.

481
00:24:00,524 --> 00:24:02,317
And I'll be herefor you,okay?

482
00:24:05,654 --> 00:24:07,155
Hey,dr. Ron?

483
00:24:07,489 --> 00:24:10,367
I just have a feeling
that everything'sgonna turn out fine.

484
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:11,994
And when it does...

485
00:24:13,328 --> 00:24:15,038
I'd like to buy you dinner

486
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:16,999
to celebrate my health.

487
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:19,376
You know,I was thinkingmaybe italian?

488
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:21,128
Oh,what the heck,

489
00:24:21,128 --> 00:24:23,172
maybe we can call it a date.

490
00:24:23,589 --> 00:24:25,090
If you like.

491
00:24:30,012 --> 00:24:31,346
Dr. Ron?

492
00:24:32,306 --> 00:24:33,473
uh,he left awhile ago.

493
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:36,685
He got a phone callfrom his girlfriend.

494
00:24:40,522 --> 00:24:41,940
Okay.

495
00:24:43,192 --> 00:24:44,568
Thank you.

496
00:24:46,695 --> 00:24:48,655
I'd liketo get out now.

497
00:24:48,906 --> 00:24:50,908
Try not to move.

498
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:08,800
good morning,luis,ralph.

499
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,302
-good morning,mrs. Solis.
-good morning,mrs. Solis.

500
00:25:10,302 --> 00:25:11,887
Good morning,honey.

501
00:25:11,887 --> 00:25:13,931
Hey,you're talkingto me again.

502
00:25:13,931 --> 00:25:15,516
Well,I thoughtabout what you said--

503
00:25:15,516 --> 00:25:17,893
about the pictures--and you're right.

504
00:25:17,893 --> 00:25:19,353
It was my mistake

505
00:25:19,353 --> 00:25:21,813
and I have to live with it.

506
00:25:50,676 --> 00:25:52,135
What the hellare you doing?!

507
00:25:52,135 --> 00:25:53,846
I'm living with it!

508
00:25:56,598 --> 00:25:58,851
Hey,turn aroundand keep gardening!

509
00:25:58,851 --> 00:26:01,270
Aw,you're so mean.

510
00:26:01,895 --> 00:26:03,814
Put your clothes on right now.

511
00:26:03,814 --> 00:26:06,483
Why? You either careif men leer
at me or not.

512
00:26:06,483 --> 00:26:08,527
And you made it clear thatyou don't.
So what's the point?

513
00:26:08,527 --> 00:26:11,071
Gabrielle,I am not beatingthis
guy up for you!

514
00:26:11,071 --> 00:26:13,407
Then you better think of anotherway to
get my pictures back.

515
00:26:13,407 --> 00:26:17,286
Because if you don't,people on wisteria lane
are gonna be seeinga lot more of me!

516
00:26:17,286 --> 00:26:20,164
Ralph,luis,feast your eyes!

517
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:23,917
My finger!

518
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,129
I'll find it!

519
00:26:27,129 --> 00:26:28,422
Aah,my finger!

520
00:26:28,422 --> 00:26:29,506
It's gotta be here somewhere.

521
00:26:29,506 --> 00:26:30,507
I'll look for it,man.

522
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:31,133
Don't worry,man.

523
00:26:31,133 --> 00:26:32,801
-I'll find it.Oh,
-my finger!

524
00:26:35,053 --> 00:26:36,138
Hey,honey,

525
00:26:37,014 --> 00:26:37,973
good news.

526
00:26:38,432 --> 00:26:39,725
I checked on penny,

527
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:41,727
and she didn't scream.

528
00:26:42,352 --> 00:26:44,021
I think she's getting usedto the mask.

529
00:26:44,771 --> 00:26:47,149
I don't want youto have options,tom.

530
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:51,486
If I die,I wanna hearyour life would be over.

531
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:54,323
I want you to spendthe rest of
your life screaming,

532
00:26:54,323 --> 00:26:57,493
"it should've been meon that plane!"

533
00:26:58,577 --> 00:27:00,329
-Plane?
-I'm assuming there was a crash.

534
00:27:00,329 --> 00:27:01,580
It could've been something else.

535
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,456
Okay,wait,wait,wait,wait.

536
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:03,499
Do you have any idea

537
00:27:03,499 --> 00:27:07,920
how painful it is to hear about you
even thinkabout your next wife and kids?

538
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,213
I could never do that!

539
00:27:09,213 --> 00:27:11,632
I can't imagine my lifewithout you.

540
00:27:11,632 --> 00:27:13,592
You are my everything!

541
00:27:13,592 --> 00:27:14,968
Honey,you're my everything.

542
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:16,845
Okay,well,that's easy to say,

543
00:27:16,845 --> 00:27:18,722
but I need youto show me.

544
00:27:19,556 --> 00:27:20,265
How?

545
00:27:20,265 --> 00:27:22,184
With a vasec to me.

546
00:27:25,229 --> 00:27:26,772
Can't I justget you some flowers?

547
00:27:26,772 --> 00:27:27,898
Look,it makesperfect sense.

548
00:27:27,898 --> 00:27:29,733
We're not gonna haveany more kids.

549
00:27:29,733 --> 00:27:32,569
And the pill just makesme bloat.
It'll be great!

550
00:27:32,569 --> 00:27:33,487
No,okay,lynette,

551
00:27:33,487 --> 00:27:34,196
this is crazy.

552
00:27:34,196 --> 00:27:35,906
Oh,I know! I know!

553
00:27:35,906 --> 00:27:38,659
But it is whatmarried people do.

554
00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:42,955
They go out of their way to calmeach
other's irrational fears.

555
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:46,166
Oh,come on,tom.

556
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:48,085
I really need youto do this.

557
00:27:50,921 --> 00:27:52,172
Well,okay.

558
00:27:53,423 --> 00:27:54,800
Fine,yeah.

559
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:56,593
I'll make an appointment.

560
00:27:57,845 --> 00:27:59,304
Thank you.

561
00:28:17,531 --> 00:28:18,991
can I ask yousomethin'?

562
00:28:18,991 --> 00:28:20,701
I'd rather you didn'T.

563
00:28:23,954 --> 00:28:25,497
How'd you get started?

564
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,500
-Started?
-You know,

565
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,127
in the escort business?

566
00:28:30,627 --> 00:28:31,545
I beg your pardon.

567
00:28:31,545 --> 00:28:33,755
I bet the guys go crazywith
your whole...

568
00:28:33,755 --> 00:28:37,092
classy,repressed thingyou
got going on,huh?

569
00:28:37,551 --> 00:28:40,012
I mean,your skin has,like,
no pores.

570
00:28:41,138 --> 00:28:43,849
I am not sure,but I think there
wasa compliment in there somewhere,

571
00:28:43,849 --> 00:28:44,933
so thank you.

572
00:28:44,933 --> 00:28:47,311
But I am not an escort.

573
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,313
How much you chargea night?

574
00:28:49,313 --> 00:28:50,939
Look,I'M...

575
00:28:54,109 --> 00:28:55,569
$5,000.

576
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:01,074
What do you have to doexactly for 5 grand?

577
00:29:05,287 --> 00:29:06,663
All right.

578
00:29:07,372 --> 00:29:09,291
Your bail cleared.You're free to go.

579
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:10,959
Your car'sat the impound lot.

580
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:12,961
And you can pick it upin the morning.

581
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:15,088
Well,how am I supposed to get
home? I don't have any money.

582
00:29:15,422 --> 00:29:16,507
Call a friend.

583
00:29:16,507 --> 00:29:18,884
I have been through enoughhumiliation
for one day.

584
00:29:18,884 --> 00:29:21,178
I hope you have a bettersuggestion than that.

585
00:29:21,178 --> 00:29:23,972
Okay,well,let me think,um...

586
00:29:24,932 --> 00:29:26,225
walk.

587
00:29:37,569 --> 00:29:39,696
oh,for goodness sakes!

588
00:29:47,412 --> 00:29:48,330
bree?

589
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,833
Is everything okay?

590
00:29:50,833 --> 00:29:54,878
Oh,oh,I'm fine.I just,um,had a flat tire.

591
00:29:55,546 --> 00:29:56,713
It's your lucky day.

592
00:29:56,713 --> 00:29:59,341
I'm a whizat changing tires. Hop in.

593
00:29:59,341 --> 00:30:00,634
You know,thank you,

594
00:30:00,634 --> 00:30:02,803
but I think it's actuallysomething
more mechanical.

595
00:30:02,803 --> 00:30:05,514
My car has been makingjust a terrible noise.

596
00:30:05,931 --> 00:30:07,724
Well,I have auto club.

597
00:30:09,101 --> 00:30:10,060
Come on.

598
00:30:15,482 --> 00:30:16,567
Actually,

599
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:19,945
my car has beenimpounded by the police.

600
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:36,253
Thanks,betty,and,um...

601
00:30:36,545 --> 00:30:39,840
I'd appreciate itif you could keep
this little incidentto yourself.

602
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,925
I won't say a word.I swear.

603
00:30:41,925 --> 00:30:43,010
Well,that's good to hear,

604
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:44,845
because most people on thisstreet
couldn't keep a secret

605
00:30:44,845 --> 00:30:46,597
if their lives depended on it.

606
00:30:46,597 --> 00:30:47,890
Well,bree,

607
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:50,058
even if everyone does find out,

608
00:30:50,058 --> 00:30:51,560
it's no big deal.

609
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,478
I mean,lots of peoplehave D.U.I.S.

610
00:30:53,478 --> 00:30:57,357
Yes,but the difference ismost of those people
were actually drunkwhen they were arrested.

611
00:30:57,357 --> 00:30:58,859
I was not.

612
00:30:59,651 --> 00:31:00,652
Well,of course.

613
00:31:02,362 --> 00:31:04,615
You know,you sound likeyou
don't believe me.

614
00:31:05,365 --> 00:31:08,035
Well,um,it's just...

615
00:31:09,411 --> 00:31:11,705
I know you've gone througha lot lately--

616
00:31:11,705 --> 00:31:14,917
the death of your husband,problems
with your son.

617
00:31:15,209 --> 00:31:19,463
It would only be naturalif you
did self-medicate.

618
00:31:20,422 --> 00:31:24,259
I'm sorry,but sincewhen do you know
so much aboutmy personal life?

619
00:31:24,259 --> 00:31:25,385
Bree,

620
00:31:25,385 --> 00:31:26,970
it's like you said--

621
00:31:27,596 --> 00:31:31,099
the people on this street arenot
great at keeping secrets.

622
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:33,519
Except for you.

623
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,062
You're reallygood at it.

624
00:31:35,062 --> 00:31:36,271
I beg your pardon.

625
00:31:36,271 --> 00:31:38,899
Well,you moved into your housein
the middle of the night.

626
00:31:38,899 --> 00:31:42,319
God knowswhat you moved in
that you didn't wantanybody to see.

627
00:31:42,694 --> 00:31:46,323
People hear soundscoming at all
hours from there.

628
00:31:46,323 --> 00:31:48,450
And,oh,what was the last one?Oh,right--

629
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:51,161
they found a dead bodyin front of your home.

630
00:31:51,161 --> 00:31:52,746
Everybody talks aboutthe applewhites,

631
00:31:52,746 --> 00:31:55,666
but nobody can figure out
exactly what you peopleare hiding.

632
00:31:55,666 --> 00:31:57,209
So congratulations.

633
00:31:57,501 --> 00:31:59,419
Your secrets are safe...

634
00:32:00,254 --> 00:32:01,547
for now.

635
00:32:18,522 --> 00:32:19,481
Edie?

636
00:32:19,815 --> 00:32:21,692
Hi,it's betty applewhite.

637
00:32:22,192 --> 00:32:25,571
Yeah,I'm sorryto call you so late but,um...

638
00:32:26,113 --> 00:32:29,408
I really need to meet with
youfirst thing in the morning.

639
00:32:29,575 --> 00:32:30,617
Yes.

640
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,997
Well,I've decidedto sell my house.

641
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,128
Dr. Ron?

642
00:32:41,128 --> 00:32:42,296
What are you doing here?

643
00:32:42,296 --> 00:32:44,047
Uh,we need to talk.

644
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,593
And it's not the kind of talkwe
can have over the phone.

645
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,678
Oh,are you sure?

646
00:32:50,262 --> 00:32:53,432
Um,becauseI would look a lot better
over the phone right now.

647
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:57,728
Um,susan,your,uh,your test results came back.

648
00:33:00,439 --> 00:33:03,192
And for the life of me,I can't figure it out.

649
00:33:03,192 --> 00:33:05,402
Now based on the--on the symptoms
you were describing--

650
00:33:05,402 --> 00:33:06,445
symptoms?

651
00:33:06,445 --> 00:33:09,156
Yeah,the dizziness,the tingling,
the muscle spasms,

652
00:33:09,156 --> 00:33:11,074
the chills--it could be neurological.

653
00:33:11,074 --> 00:33:13,160
It also could be basedon an
autoimmune disorder.

654
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,746
I just--frankly,I'm stumped.

655
00:33:15,746 --> 00:33:17,122
Oh,no,no,no,no.

656
00:33:17,122 --> 00:33:19,833
Hey,listen,we're gonnaget through this,okay?

657
00:33:21,502 --> 00:33:23,629
I am so sorry.

658
00:33:24,087 --> 00:33:25,589
But I'm not sick.

659
00:33:26,423 --> 00:33:27,925
What are youtalking about?

660
00:33:28,884 --> 00:33:31,553
your nurse wouldn'tlet me see you,and I...

661
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:33,263
really wanted to see you,

662
00:33:33,263 --> 00:33:36,058
so I sort of fakedall my symptoms.

663
00:33:36,058 --> 00:33:38,894
The dizziness,the chills,you know,
all of it.

664
00:33:39,895 --> 00:33:41,772
Why--why would youdo something like that?

665
00:33:41,772 --> 00:33:43,065
What the hellis wrong with you?

666
00:33:43,065 --> 00:33:44,858
I know. I know.I feel really awful.

667
00:33:45,275 --> 00:33:47,569
I am just not the bestat meeting men.

668
00:33:47,569 --> 00:33:48,737
And I thought you were cute,

669
00:33:48,737 --> 00:33:50,948
and I sort of thought that maybe
you thoughtI was cute,

670
00:33:50,948 --> 00:33:52,741
and you're a doctor,and that's so sexy.

671
00:33:52,741 --> 00:33:55,160
So I was up all nightworried sick

672
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,411
digging through medical books,

673
00:33:56,411 --> 00:33:59,957
trying to figure outsome mysterious disease
that doesn't really exist?

674
00:33:59,957 --> 00:34:01,792
Really?You were up all night?

675
00:34:01,792 --> 00:34:02,918
Yes.

676
00:34:02,918 --> 00:34:05,379
I don't enjoytelling people
I thinkthey're going to die.

677
00:34:05,379 --> 00:34:07,339
Especially not
people I like.

678
00:34:07,339 --> 00:34:08,715
You like me?

679
00:34:08,882 --> 00:34:10,133
Yes.

680
00:34:10,133 --> 00:34:11,343
What about your girlfriend?

681
00:34:11,343 --> 00:34:13,971
-What girlfriend?
-The one who calledin the M.R.I. Room?

682
00:34:14,388 --> 00:34:17,140
We had one date. She wanteda
referral to a dermatologist.

683
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,851
She's got eczema.

684
00:34:23,856 --> 00:34:25,774
Maybe we couldgo out sometime?

685
00:34:32,197 --> 00:34:33,407
Do you like sushi?

686
00:34:34,658 --> 00:34:35,951
I love sushi.

687
00:34:35,951 --> 00:34:38,453
I'm available tomorrow night.

688
00:34:38,453 --> 00:34:40,914
No,no,no,tomorrow's no good.
I'll still be angry.

689
00:34:40,914 --> 00:34:42,332
I should be cooled downby friday.

690
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:45,377
Oh,uh,friday's good.

691
00:34:46,044 --> 00:34:47,337
Oh,there's one thing--

692
00:34:47,337 --> 00:34:51,133
your M.R.I. Showed that you
havea wandering spleen.

693
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,467
A what?

694
00:34:52,467 --> 00:34:54,511
It's a wandering spleen.
It's no big deal.

695
00:34:54,511 --> 00:34:56,471
Sometimes the thing just
moves around in there.

696
00:34:56,471 --> 00:34:58,640
But we'll keepan eye on it.

697
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:04,271
Wandering what?

698
00:35:09,318 --> 00:35:10,152
Okay,

699
00:35:10,152 --> 00:35:11,653
go get him,tiger.

700
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,407
I can't do it,gaby.

701
00:35:15,991 --> 00:35:16,825
What?

702
00:35:16,825 --> 00:35:19,620
I can't go in there.I thought I could,
but I can'T.

703
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,330
You promised!

704
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:23,165
Ever since I got outof prison,

705
00:35:23,165 --> 00:35:24,875
I've been tryingto lead a better life.

706
00:35:25,292 --> 00:35:27,127
And for the first time,I can honestly say

707
00:35:27,127 --> 00:35:29,630
that I'm a good catholic,
and I don't want to ruin that.

708
00:35:30,172 --> 00:35:34,301
So do this today and go toan
extra long mass tomorrow.

709
00:35:34,301 --> 00:35:36,136
It doesn't workthat way.

710
00:35:36,136 --> 00:35:36,970
Okay,

711
00:35:37,179 --> 00:35:41,433
look,I'm really trying
to understandyour moral dilemma here,I am.

712
00:35:41,433 --> 00:35:42,851
But if you don't getmy pictures back,

713
00:35:42,851 --> 00:35:44,436
I'm gonna be humiliated.

714
00:35:44,436 --> 00:35:48,232
You think our gardener
is the only local pervsurfing the web?

715
00:35:48,232 --> 00:35:50,275
I'm sorry,gabrielle.

716
00:35:50,275 --> 00:35:51,568
You used to go crazy

717
00:35:51,568 --> 00:35:54,571
when men would so muchas
look at me the wrong way--

718
00:35:54,947 --> 00:35:56,532
and that's whenI had clothes on.

719
00:35:56,532 --> 00:35:58,283
I'm trying to bebetter than that now.

720
00:35:58,283 --> 00:36:00,828
Or maybe you just don't love
meas much as you used to.

721
00:36:00,828 --> 00:36:03,080
Why can't you just let mebe a good person?

722
00:36:03,872 --> 00:36:05,249
You know,if you really loved me,

723
00:36:05,249 --> 00:36:07,042
you wouldn't even ask meto go in there.

724
00:36:07,042 --> 00:36:09,837
If you really loved me,
I wouldn't have to ask!

725
00:36:15,259 --> 00:36:16,927
fine,forget it.

726
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,930
Really?

727
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:21,348
Be a good person.

728
00:36:21,557 --> 00:36:23,600
Knock yourself out.

729
00:36:25,143 --> 00:36:26,854
It's not thatI don't love you. I--

730
00:36:26,854 --> 00:36:29,648
yeah,okay,look,let's just go home.

731
00:36:38,198 --> 00:36:39,616
What are you doing?

732
00:36:40,033 --> 00:36:41,827
I'm gettingyour pictures back.

733
00:36:42,703 --> 00:36:44,746
I'm not gonna hurt him.

734
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:47,457
I'll talk to him,

735
00:36:47,457 --> 00:36:49,334
appeal to his better nature.

736
00:37:02,264 --> 00:37:03,307
Can I help you?

737
00:37:03,724 --> 00:37:05,100
I'm carlos solis.

738
00:37:06,894 --> 00:37:09,730
You have,uh,naked picturesof
my wife on your web site.

739
00:37:12,524 --> 00:37:13,775
You're,uh...

740
00:37:14,943 --> 00:37:16,737
gabrielle's husband?

741
00:37:19,573 --> 00:37:22,075
well,you know what?
I was just aboutto take those off anyway.

742
00:37:24,828 --> 00:37:26,079
That's great.

743
00:37:31,001 --> 00:37:32,419
I reallyappreciate this,scott.

744
00:37:32,419 --> 00:37:33,879
Hey,no problem.

745
00:37:34,463 --> 00:37:38,050
To tell you the truth,gabrielle's pages
weren't exactly raking inthe big bucks for me.

746
00:37:38,383 --> 00:37:39,760
I find thathard to believe.

747
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,553
I'm not saying gabrielle's nota pretty girl.

748
00:37:41,553 --> 00:37:43,263
Of course she is.But,uh,

749
00:37:43,972 --> 00:37:46,183
she ain't exactlyinternet pretty,you know?

750
00:37:49,061 --> 00:37:50,354
What does that mean?

751
00:37:50,354 --> 00:37:52,397
The web's about fantasy,not fashion.

752
00:37:52,397 --> 00:37:53,649
I mean,guys surfingfor porn,

753
00:37:53,649 --> 00:37:55,442
they don't care how the clothesare
hanging off the body.

754
00:37:55,442 --> 00:37:56,985
They just wanna seethe goods. So,uh,

755
00:37:57,569 --> 00:37:59,738
if little miss nastyain't rocking
some curves...

756
00:37:59,738 --> 00:38:01,281
my wife has a perfect figure.

757
00:38:01,907 --> 00:38:03,033
Don't get me wrong.

758
00:38:03,534 --> 00:38:05,285
Our little gaby knows how to,uh...

759
00:38:05,786 --> 00:38:07,371
work a runway,but,uh,

760
00:38:07,371 --> 00:38:09,039
when it comesto cyber lovin'?

761
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:11,542
No real man's gonnawaste tissue on that.
There you go.

762
00:38:11,875 --> 00:38:13,335
That's all of 'em.

763
00:38:13,335 --> 00:38:15,754
So we cool now?

764
00:38:30,394 --> 00:38:32,396
now that's my guy.

765
00:38:44,908 --> 00:38:46,451
You're not limping.

766
00:38:47,161 --> 00:38:48,704
Did everything go okay?

767
00:38:51,165 --> 00:38:52,499
I couldn't do it.

768
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:54,877
What happened?

769
00:38:57,087 --> 00:38:58,881
I don't know.
I got there,I...

770
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,009
I put on the paper gownand I,uh...

771
00:39:04,595 --> 00:39:05,971
I just couldn't do it.

772
00:39:07,014 --> 00:39:08,140
Why not?

773
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:10,309
It felt likeI was being emasculated.

774
00:39:10,475 --> 00:39:11,894
Oh,please.

775
00:39:11,894 --> 00:39:12,561
I'm serious,lynette.

776
00:39:12,561 --> 00:39:14,396
I don't make the moneyaround here anymore.

777
00:39:14,396 --> 00:39:16,398
I don't providefor you and the kids.

778
00:39:16,398 --> 00:39:19,526
And i wasn't going to let them snip out the l
ast thing that make me feel a man

779
00:39:20,861 --> 00:39:25,115
Staying home and taking care of the kids
doesn't make you less of a man

780
00:39:25,115 --> 00:39:26,658
that's crazy

781
00:39:27,451 --> 00:39:30,120
you expect me to calm your rational fears,

782
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,705
i expect you to calm mine

783
00:39:42,799 --> 00:39:44,468
Are you saying you are not happy ?

784
00:39:47,513 --> 00:39:49,014
A little bit yeah

785
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,563
Well what we gonna do about that ?

786
00:39:57,397 --> 00:39:58,565
i don't know

787
00:39:59,691 --> 00:40:01,151
-can we just ?
-no,Lynette

788
00:40:03,821 --> 00:40:05,239
I don't know

789
00:40:25,467 --> 00:40:29,805
hi,it's detective barton,look i feel awful
about what happend the other day,

790
00:40:29,805 --> 00:40:31,390
I was the jerk

791
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,683
so to make it up to you

792
00:40:32,683 --> 00:40:34,476
I did some sniffing around about the dead man

793
00:40:34,476 --> 00:40:36,186
they found in front of your neigbours house

794
00:40:36,186 --> 00:40:39,606
I got some information his name is Curt Monroe

795
00:40:39,606 --> 00:40:42,151
A private detective who lost his license
a couple years ago

796
00:40:42,151 --> 00:40:43,694
Apparently he is from Chicago

797
00:40:43,694 --> 00:40:46,488
I don't if this is helpful but...

798
00:40:49,032 --> 00:40:50,909
years ago,he is apparently from Chicago

799
00:40:51,118 --> 00:40:53,620
I,I don't know if this is helpful but

800
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:56,540
I just feel terrible about what happened

801
00:40:57,958 --> 00:41:00,919
illness can take on many forms

802
00:41:00,919 --> 00:41:03,839
those of the body are easy to treat

803
00:41:04,464 --> 00:41:06,675
Much more difficult

804
00:41:06,675 --> 00:41:10,220
are the hidden maladies festering in our hearts

805
00:41:11,471 --> 00:41:14,516
the secret diction that consume our soul

806
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,104
and the disease we deny

807
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:21,356
which affect our judgement

808
00:41:26,778 --> 00:41:31,241
To survive we need to find that special
someone who can heal us

809
00:41:32,367 --> 00:41:34,995
I work so hard on my life,

810
00:41:35,913 --> 00:41:37,789
so hard

811
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:40,584
Now it's all nothing

812
00:41:42,878 --> 00:41:46,757
i got one daughter i hate who hates me

813
00:41:47,799 --> 00:41:50,344
before her time

814
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:54,640
No one left for me now

815
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,560
What did I do it for

816
00:42:02,814 --> 00:42:03,941
it was good i

817
00:42:05,275 --> 00:42:06,693
did't feel a thing

818
00:42:09,071 --> 00:42:10,531
XXXXX

819
00:42:11,657 --> 00:42:13,617
XXXXXXXX

820
00:42:13,617 --> 00:42:15,828
But we can never predict

821
00:42:15,828 --> 00:42:19,540
who have the cure for what ills us

822
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:23,210
XXXXXXXXXXXX

823
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:27,005
or when they'll show up

824
00:42:28,173 --> 00:42:30,342
But I think we can get along,

825
00:42:30,342 --> 00:42:31,927
just

826
00:42:34,513 --> 00:42:38,684
