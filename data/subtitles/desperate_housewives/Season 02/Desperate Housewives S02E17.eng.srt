my name is bree,

10
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:31,073
<i>and false pretenses</i>
 <i>became a way of life.</i></i>

11
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:37,579
<i>gabrielle solis had always been</i>
 <i>a demanding shopper.</i></i>

12
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:41,500
carlos, come on!
they're here!

13
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:43,877
<i>and whatever the purchase,</i></i>

14
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:47,381
<i>she always expected</i>
 <i>the very best.</i></i>

15
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:52,719
<i>whether it was exotic perfume</i>
 <i>shipd over from paris...</i></i>

16
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:58,767
<i>a high fashion gown straight</i>
 <i>from a runway in milan...</i></i>

<i>or designer shoes</i>
 <i>flown in from manhattan,</i></i>

18

<i>but on this day,</i></i>

19
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:10,070
<i>her expectations were</i>
 <i>going to be put to the test.</i></i>

20
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:13,782
<i>you see, gabrielle was now</i>
 <i>shopping for a baby,</i></i>

21
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:16,368
<i>and there was a problem...</i></i>

22
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,829
<i>with the manufacturer.</i></i>

23
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,835
mostly, i just wanna feel
like i'm giving my baby

24
00:01:24,877 --> 00:01:28,797
to people who have what it takes
to be really great parents.

25
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:30,799
well, you won't find
another couple

26
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,093
with more love for a child.
(chuckles)

27
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:36,930
isn't that right, honey?
honey?

28
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:38,974
right.
right, uh, lots of le.

29
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:42,436
honey, can i talk to you
for a second?

30
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,855
yeah.

31
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:50,611
okay.
okay, look, we have
to find another mother.

32
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:53,405
why?
okay, this isn't easy to say,
so i'm just gonna say it,

33
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:56,408
but have you taken
a good look at her?
oh, my god.

34
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,535
are you trying to say that
you don't want deana's baby

35
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,579
because she's plain?
no, plain i can handle.

36
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,581
carlos, since that woman
has walked into ou ihouse,

37
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,416
the clocks
have stopped working.

38
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,502
no one can predict what
a child is gonna look like.

39
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:09,129
for all you know, her kid could
end up winning beauty contests.

40
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:10,923
with <i>her</i> d.n.a.,</i>

41
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,300
the only thing that kid's gonna
be winning is best in show.

42
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:15,636
look, carlos, i am sorry,
but i want a pretty baby,

43
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,096
so let's find another mother.
mnh-mnh. i'm not gonna let

44
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,599
your shallow obsession
with looks screw this up.

45
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,893
i want a child--any child.

46
00:02:22,935 --> 00:02:25,395
fine. just know
that in a couple of days,

47
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:27,397
when that thing is born,

48
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,900
and you're gonna have
to cuddle and snuggle up

49
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,944
with something
with <i>that</i> face on it,</i>

50
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,987
don't come crying to me.

51
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:41,161
i'm sorry.

52
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:42,871
now where were we?

53
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,915
we were just talking about
the custody arrangement

54
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:46,416
once deana gives birth.

55
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,293
it's usually best
that the mother

56
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,504
doesn't see the child
at all.

57
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:53,799
so as soon as the doctors finish
giving their initial checkup...

58
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:07,020
...the baby
will be handed over you.

59
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:12,067
<i>yes, gabrielle had always been</i>
 <i>a demanding shopper.</i></i>

60
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:13,944
sorry.

61
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:19,867
<i>because she knew</i>
 <i>there are some purchases...</i></i>

62
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:23,370

i'm about to be released.

oh, that's terrific.
who's mike?

78

i...

79
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:50,290
why do you ask?

80
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:52,209
i don't know. no reason.

81
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:54,670
ah, it's jt,..

82
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,672
just before the operation,

83
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,633
just before you went under,
i said, "i love you,"

84
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:02,010
and you said,
"i love mike."

85
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:05,639
i did?

86
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:08,934
oh, is that why you han't been
in to see me since my surgery?

87
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:11,019
answer the question.

88
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,272
i don't even know
a mike.

89
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:18,443
everyone knows a mike.
yes, everyone does know
a mike.

90
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,946
actually, you're right.
i did know a mike in college.

91
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:23,615
we did this play together,
"pippin." it wasn't very good.

92
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,785
anyways, i never thought of him,
so you shouldn't be accusing me.

93
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,662
i was probably
just hallucinating.

94
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:30,747
fine, fine.

95
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:33,000
so... who's the guy
you're married to?

96
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,169
damn that nurse hisel!

97
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:38,380
or should i say, "who's the guy
you're cating on?"

98
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:40,382
okay, yes,
i did remarry my ex,

99
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:43,010
but it was only because
he has great health insurance.

100
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,304
did miss blabbermouth
tell you that, too?

101
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:48,056
you--you committed
insurance fraud?
only in the legal sense.

102
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:51,602
and i just didn't tell you
because i wanted to protect you.

103
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:53,604
susan--
okay, you know what?

104
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:56,440
you should come over to dinner
and meet karl, and you can see

105
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,734
that there is absolutely
nothing between us.

106
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:01,236
so wait,
once you're fully recovered

107
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:02,738
you're gonna divorce him?

108
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,823
oh, yeah, that's the plan.
i swear.

109
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:07,993
and you swear that you're not
in love with anyone named mike?

110
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,664
sure.

111
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,794
okay.

112
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,671
come here.

113
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:23,050
i believe you.

114
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,345
(man) next morning,
i woke up in an alley.

115
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,888
my wallet had been stolen.

116
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,474
i was lying in a pool
of my own vomit.

117
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:33,519
that's when i knew
i'd hit rock bottom.

118
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:40,025
okay, who's next?

119
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:41,068
bree.

120
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:45,906
oh! um, i couldn't
possibly top that.

121
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,407
thank you, though.

122
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:55,624
(indistinct conversations)

123
00:06:57,668 --> 00:06:59,837
hi. before coming
to these meetings,

124
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:03,799
i never realized how messy
substance abusers can be.

125
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:05,801
we usually leave
the doughnut crumbs

126
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:07,803
for the overeaters anonymous
group at meets after us.

127
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:10,222
you know,
just to mess with 'em.

128
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:12,015
you're awful.

129
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:14,601
so... tell me, bree,
how long have you been sober?

130
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:17,396
gosh, um...

131
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,439
i'm not exactly sure.

132
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:22,234
oh. is somebody
still drinking?

133
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:24,736
now why would you
say that?

134
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,738
never met
an alcoholic yet

135
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,409
who didn't know exactly how long
it'd been since his last drink.

136
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:36,373
okay, you got me.

137
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:38,375
i'm not really
an alcoholic.

138
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:40,002
you don't say.

139
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:42,504
it's true. i'm coming here
because of my son.

140
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:45,507
you see, he's--he's trying
to take me to court to become

141
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:49,011
an emancipated minor, and he's
planning on lying to the judge

142
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:51,513
and telling him that
i am some sort of dreadful lush.

143
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:54,016
so i'm coming to these meetings
to give the impression

144
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:57,019
that i have changed.
but you don't
really need to change

145
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,271
because you don't have
a problem with alcohol.

146
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:01,899
exactly.

147
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,400
i'll tell you what...

148
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:05,819
here's my card.

149
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:07,821
and if you ever
 <i>do</i> have a problem</i>

150
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:10,782
or you just feel like talking,
give me a call, okay?

151
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,910
i know you think
i'm kidding myself,

152
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:14,453
but i'm not.

153
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,663
i'm nothing like
you people.

154
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:19,708
i just don't have
a compulsive personality.

155
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:22,544
hmm.

156
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:31,678
word is out all over town
that you're unhappy at zimms,

157
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,307
so why not jump ship
and come to parcher & murphy?

158
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:37,726
i swear, veronica,
you would fit in so well here.

159
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:39,728
i do need
to make a change, lynette,

160
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:42,564
but the money
you're offering...

161
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:44,733
yeah, it sucks,
but there are other perks--

162
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:47,069
the expense account,
the corner office...
i don't know.

163
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,780
you're just gonna have to give
me some time to think about it.

164
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:52,658
fair enough, fair gh.
okay, what is your secret?

165
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,327
how can you eat like that
and keep your figure?

166
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:58,330
it's the breast-feeding.
it burns so many calories.

167
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:01,208
it's like having a treadmillstrap

168
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,836
i didn't know
you had a child.

169
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:06,672
yes, my son donovan.
he's the love of my life.

170
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:08,507
really, veronica?

171
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:11,176
well, you know, there's another
perk that i just thought of.

172
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:18,559
oh, my gosh,
this is fantastic!

173
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,561
they don't have
day care at zimms.

174
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:22,229
how can they not?

175
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:25,107
for working parents like
you and me, it's a necessity.

176
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:27,067
so is the pot
getting sweeter?

177
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,152
would people here be cool
about my breast-feeding donovan?

178
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:31,405
the guys at zimms
were real jerks about that.

179
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:33,699
parcher & murphy
is completely mother-friendly.

180
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,075
no one would say a word.

181
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:36,577
oh!

182
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:40,205
what the heck, i'm in.

183
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,457
yeah?
well, that's fantastic!

184
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:45,002
oh, my god,
whose kids are those?

185
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:48,130
(shouting and laughing)

186
00:09:48,172 --> 00:09:50,299
i have absolutely no idea.

187
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,968
let's go hammer out
the details.
okay.

188
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:56,597
(carlos) mm. ooh.

189
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:59,099
(gabrielle) these can't be
our only choices, mr. beale.

190
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:01,059
i mean, come <i>on.</i></i>

191
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,103
each girl is uglier
than the next.

192
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,355
look, finding a gorgeous
pregnant woman who's willing

193
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:07,900
to give her baby to a couple
with a criminal record

194
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,569
isn't exactly
a walk in the park.
i don't care if it's a walk in the sewer.

195
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:11,111
we are hemorrhaging money
into your bank account,

196
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:15,699
and i expect
to see results.
you know, mrs. solis,

197
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:18,160
you can catch more flies
with honey than with vinegar.

198
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:18,952
if i wanted to catch flies,

199
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,788
all i would have to do
is call up one of these girls.

200
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,249
trust me,
the flies would follow.

201
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,794
(intercom beeps)
(woman) excuse me, sir, there's
a libby collins here for you.

202
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:31,423
i'll be right out there.
uh, i took the liberty

203
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:33,675
of inviting this girl
down here to meet you.

204
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:35,928
now i wouldn't exactly say
she's a <i>quality</i> human being,</i>

205
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,721
but she is attractive.

206
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:41,058
if you don't respond to her,
i'm afraid i'm out of ideas.

207
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,893
(sighs)

208
00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:45,270
he's going to dump us
as clients

209
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,231
if you don't stop
being so damn picky.

210
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:49,233
we're gonna
have to stare at this face

211
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:50,859
for the next 18 years.

212
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:53,779
i don't think now
is the time to skimp on quality.

213
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,739
(mr. beale)
gabrielle, carlos...

214
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:58,283
i'd like you to meet libby.

215
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:08,794
well, now,
this i can work with.

216
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,549
so getting pregnant

217
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,759
was the worst thing that
could've ever happened to me,

218
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:18,846
'cause i went into debt
and i had to stop performing.

219
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:21,890
libby's a pole dancer
in a strip club.

220
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:23,392
oh!

221
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,811
wow, that--that sounds
like interesting work.

222
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:29,189
you'd think so,
but it gets old quickly.

223
00:11:29,231 --> 00:11:31,817
my big dream
is to become a choreographer.

224
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:33,777
really?
yeah.
i made up this one move.

225
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:35,946
it's called
"the serpent's tongue,"

226
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:38,782
and all the girls at the club
are doing it now. it's so cool.

227
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:40,826
if i had a pole
i could show you.

228
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:43,579
well, we'll have to go down
to the club and check that out.

229
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,082
we'll make a night of it.
yeah, we'll do that.

230
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:49,710
so, libby,
who's the father?

231
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,378
honesty, i don't know.

232
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,672
i mean, there's a lot of guys
who come into the club,

233
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:55,757
and they all buy me drinks,

234
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:59,094
and sometimes i get a little bit
more friendly than i intend to.

235
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:01,013
i hope you don't think
i'm a slut.

236
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:02,347
no!

237
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:04,349
no.
no, actually,
all we think about

238
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:07,853
when we look at you
is how pretty yoare.

239
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:09,855
well, i've heard enough,
mr. beale.

240
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:12,733
if libby here likes us as much
as much as we like her,

241
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:15,861
we should just go ahead
and move to adopt her baby girl.

242
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:19,448
first, we should probably talk
about how much money i want.

243
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:22,409
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
(chuckles)

244
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:24,369
nobody's buying a baby here.
that's illegal.

245
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:26,788
money can never
exchange hands.

246
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,790
libby, you'll make a list
of your expenses,

247
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:30,626
and the solises here will pay.

248
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:33,128
oh, but can't they also
buy me gifts?

249
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,672
i knew this one girl who gave up
her baby, and she got a harley.

250
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:39,718
well, i don't know that we can
afford a harley, but i'm sure

251
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,971
we'll find some way
to express our gratitude.

252
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:45,182
okay.

253
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:46,433
whatever.

254
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:49,019
well, my lunch break is over,

255
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:51,897
so i have get back
to the club.

256
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:54,816
till i get rid of this kid,
they got me slinging drinks.

257
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:58,111
it was really nice to meet you,
mr. and mrs. <i>soulless.</i></i>

258
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,072
oh, it'sctually
pronounced <i>solis.</i></i>

259
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,156
sorry.

260
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:02,616
so what kind of name is that?

261
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:04,326
uh, it's mexican.

262
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:06,370
both our families
come from guadalajara.

263
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:08,872
huh.

264
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:10,541
i figured you were italian.

265
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:13,043
nope. latino.
proud of it. (chuckles)

266
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:17,005
good for you.

267
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:25,180
wow, she's... gorgeous.

268
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,725
yeah. my little girl's gonna
inherit some wonderful genes.

269
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:30,727
is this
libby's real hair color?

270
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:32,229
yes, it's all natural,

271
00:13:32,271 --> 00:13:34,314
from her straight teeth
to her "c" cup.

272
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:36,650
and i know she's athletic
because she's a pole dancer,

273
00:13:36,692 --> 00:13:38,151
so i really hope

274
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,654
that my little girl
inherits that as well.

275
00:13:40,696 --> 00:13:43,907
no, the athletic gene,
not the pole dancing gene.

276
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:45,576
(chuckles)

277
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:48,412
(karl) susie, baby?

278
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:51,123
oh, i got your call, uh...
i thought i'd stop by.

279
00:13:51,165 --> 00:13:53,125
i didn't realize
you had company. hello, ladies.

280
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:55,961
um, we'll just be a second.
just wheel me.

281
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:57,504
be right back.

282
00:13:57,546 --> 00:13:59,756
just be a second.

283
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:01,925
did he just call her "baby"?

284
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:04,261
yeah. when did they
stop hating each other?

285
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:07,389
i need you to ditch edie
tomorrow night

286
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:09,183
and have dinner
with dr. ron and me.

287
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:10,976
now why would i do that?

288
00:14:10,976 --> 00:14:13,061
well, for starters, because you
banged your secretary,

289
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:15,439
and you owe me
for the rest of your life.

290
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,940
i'll bring the wine.

291
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:19,026
well, you know,
before mike came along,

292
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:22,237
i always just assumed
they'd get back together.
why?

293
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:24,448
i thought they always annoyed
the heck out of each other.

294
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,617
you didn't know them
during the good times.

295
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:29,411
i mean, there was such a spark
between them, so much passion.

296
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:32,414
they would always
make each other laugh.

297
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:35,083
you actually told dr. ron
that you still love mike?

298
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,920
okay, will you shut up?
it's not funny. i was drugged.

299
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:39,421
right. sorry, sorry.

300
00:14:39,463 --> 00:14:41,548
so how'd you
get out of that one?

301
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:44,676
(sighs) i lied and i told him
i didn't know a mike.

302
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:47,513
everyone knows a mike.
i am aware of that.

303
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:50,098
so why didn't you just--because

304
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,726
dr. ron hadn't come in
to see me since the operation

305
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:54,728
and i was feeling
insecure and...

306
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:57,731
(whispers) i just didn't
feel like the truth

307
00:14:57,773 --> 00:14:59,816
was a luxury i could afford.

308
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:02,194
(normal voice) ygo ahead.
you may resume laughing.

309
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,658
uh...

310
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:10,494
ladies, always a pleasure.
and you, i'll see you tomorrow.

311
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,126
what?

312
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:20,128
this is just
a preliminary sketch,

313
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,130
but you see what
i'm thinking of?

314
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:24,925
i love it. i just love it.
let get a copy to ed.

315
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:27,511
(cell phone rings), t,
i gotta take this one.

316
00:15:27,553 --> 00:15:30,138
i'm sorry. it's tom.
that's okay.
my nanny is here with my son.

317
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,141
i need
to go feed him anyway.
perfect! take your time.

318
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:35,269
hey, honey.
how's the big apple treating ya?

319
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:39,147
good. did those, uh,
snooty clients like yo pitch?

320
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:41,483
well, that's perfect.

321
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:44,111
excellent.

322
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:46,071
uh-huh.

323
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,451
um, i'm...

324
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:54,997
i'm, um... i'm gonna have--
i'm gonna call you back.

325
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:24,276
oh, my god!
(squeals)

326
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:28,488
hello there!

327
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:31,450
i thought you and your friend
might like some snacks.

328
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:34,495
he's my lawyer, and this is
privileged communication,

329
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:37,414
so get out.
andrew, there's no need
to be rude.

330
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:39,917
this is very kind of you,
mrs. van de kamp.

331
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:42,336
well, i'm still appalled
that you're helping my son

332
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:44,630
with this ridiculous
emancipation scheme,

333
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:47,549
but you are a guest in my house,
and guests get sandwiches.

334
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:51,887
you know, if you'd let me go
to his office, you wouldn't have

335
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:56,183
to pretend to be nice to him.
andrew, there may be
a judge out there

336
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:58,101
stupid enough
to emancipate you,

337
00:16:58,143 --> 00:17:00,312
but until you find him,
i retain all my parental rights,

338
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:04,066
one of which is to ground your
sorry behind until kingdom come.

339
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:07,528
mr. bormanis,
nice to see you again.

340
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:10,572
and, um, please don't
get crumbs on my carpet.

341
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:14,034
you have got
to get me out of here.

342
00:17:14,076 --> 00:17:15,953
that bitch
is driving me crazy.

343
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:17,955
this case
is not a slam dunk.

344
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:20,374
her drinking was supposed
to be our silver bullet,

345
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:22,793
but since
she joined a.a.--
we've gotta do something,

346
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:25,671
because if she wins,
she's gonna own me.
my advice?

347
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:28,674
convince her it's in her
best interest to let you go.

348
00:17:28,674 --> 00:17:31,844
you don't wanna see
the inside of a courtroom.
why?

349
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:35,180
in family court,
appearance means everything.

350
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:38,809
if she came off abusive
or stoned or even uncaring,

351
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:40,769
we'd be in good shape.

352
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:43,355
but if there's one thing
your mom understands...

353
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:45,941
it's presentation.

354
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:55,200
can i borrow $50?

355
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:56,577
purse.

356
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:03,834
(stops playing)
why do you want
so much money?

357
00:18:03,876 --> 00:18:07,045
i'm 19. sometimes i need money.
do i have to be interrogated?

358
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:09,006
you do if you want
a dime out of me.

359
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:11,008
what's it for?

360
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:13,051
danielle's having her birthday
next week.

361
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:15,971
i just wanna be sure
i can get her a decent present.

362
00:18:16,013 --> 00:18:18,891
write her a poem.
it's free.

363
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:22,019
(resumes playing piano)

364
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:25,355
is there
something else you want?

365
00:18:25,397 --> 00:18:28,108
do you think
i like to beg for money?

366
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:30,569
i do this because
you won't let me get a job.

367
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:32,821
looking after your brother
 <i>is</i> a full-time job</i>

368
00:18:32,863 --> 00:18:35,407
for both of us,
and you know that.
well, screw him!

369
00:18:35,407 --> 00:18:37,743
matthew!
no, i'm serious, mom,
because we have both

370
00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:40,579
put our entire lives on hold,
and for what?

371
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:43,457
it's been almost a year
and he hasn't gotten any better.
i see him improving!

372
00:18:43,499 --> 00:18:46,502
that's because you see
what you wanna see!

373
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:48,587
it is time
to put him away, mom.

374
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:51,423
just let some professionals
take care of him.

375
00:18:51,465 --> 00:18:55,552
we wouldn't have to move.
we could have our lives back.

376
00:18:55,594 --> 00:18:57,888
what's wrong?

377
00:19:00,224 --> 00:19:03,143
you fighting?

378
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:06,355
matthew's friend danielle
has a birthday coming up.

379
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:09,483
we were just talking about
what gift to give her.

380
00:19:09,525 --> 00:19:11,693
well,
i was thinking jewelry...

381
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:13,737
so 50 bucks should do it.

382
00:19:16,907 --> 00:19:20,035
why not $20?
you don't wanna spoil her.

383
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:32,756
on page 6 is an e of
the new print ad. check it out.

384
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:35,884
i'm thirsty.

385
00:19:35,926 --> 00:19:37,636
oh, shh, honey,
everyone's working.

386
00:19:37,678 --> 00:19:39,763
i'm sorry.
this will just take a sec.

387
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:47,521
is it just me,
or is that bizarre?

388
00:19:47,563 --> 00:19:50,399
it's bizarre.
totally birre.

389
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:57,239
we gotta make her stop this.
y, h,don't get me wrong

390
00:19:57,281 --> 00:19:59,449
i find that as bizarre
as you guys do.

391
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:02,953
but right now this firm needs
veronica more than she needs us.

392
00:20:02,995 --> 00:20:05,747
telling a mother how to raise
her kids is an act of war.

393
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:08,292
we willose her.
the kid is 5.
it's disgusting!

394
00:20:10,002 --> 00:20:11,962
yeah, weye,
we'll just ask her

395
00:20:12,004 --> 00:20:14,798
to keep the blinds
always drawn when she nurses.

396
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,927
and god forbid
a client sees her.

397
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:21,847
okay,so's gna tell her

398
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:29,980
you're a woman.
it's easier for you

399
00:20:30,022 --> 00:20:32,441
to talk to her about
milk and boobs and stuff.

400
00:20:32,441 --> 00:20:35,068
no! no, uh, please,
don't make me do it.

401
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:36,904
why don't you have
jerry tell her?

402
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:39,406
i made a pass at her yesterday.
it'd be weird.

403
00:20:39,448 --> 00:20:41,617
you could do it
without offending her.

404
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:44,620
come on, lynette.
take one for the team.

405
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:53,587
okay. but for the record,
the team is made up of wimps.

406
00:20:53,629 --> 00:20:56,465
well, the team's aware of that
and accepts your loathing.

407
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:03,472
yeah? hi. no. no, no.

408
00:21:03,472 --> 00:21:07,851
we were just out buying some
stuff for the baby. what's up?

409
00:21:07,893 --> 00:21:09,686
seriously?

410
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:12,064
okay.

411
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:13,774
thanks for calling.

412
00:21:15,651 --> 00:21:18,028
what is it?

413
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:21,031
that was our lawyer.
libby rejected us as parents.

414
00:21:21,073 --> 00:21:23,283
why?
because we're mexican.

415
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:25,702
what?! why, i--
that's discrimination.

416
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:28,914
it's illegal.
we could have her arrested.
it's her baby.

417
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:31,708
she can do whatever the hell
she wants to with it.

418
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:32,918
damn it.

419
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,337
no! no, you don't just
toss people aside

420
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:37,756
because of the color
of their skin.
we tossed those birth mothers aside

421
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:42,511
why?
becai've read
the constitution,

422
00:21:42,553 --> 00:21:44,763
and it does not
protect ugly people.

423
00:21:44,805 --> 00:21:46,807
let's not fight about it.
it's over.

424
00:21:46,849 --> 00:21:49,393
let's just move on
to the next one.
no. no, no, no.

425
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:52,604
i want <i>that</i> woman's baby,
and i'm gonna get it.</i>

426
00:21:54,773 --> 00:21:57,359
and just how are you
gonna go about doing that?

427
00:21:57,401 --> 00:21:59,987
well, first of all, i'm gonna
show her one of our tax returns.

428
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:02,030
once she sees
how much money we have,

429
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:04,992
i have a hunch we're gonna
look a whole lot whiter.

430
00:22:06,702 --> 00:22:09,538
hey, veronica.
hi, donovan!

431
00:22:09,538 --> 00:22:13,375
my, he's getting big.
how old is he?

432
00:22:13,417 --> 00:22:14,793
he just turned 5.

433
00:22:14,835 --> 00:22:17,462
oh, wow,
he's such a big boy.
yeah.

434
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:19,464
he you know,

435
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:21,633
breast-feeding on this schedule
must be a real hassle.

436
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:24,386
i remember i used to express
my milk into a bottle.

437
00:22:24,428 --> 00:22:27,389
made my maso much so

438
00:22:27,431 --> 00:22:30,225
is there a problem,
lynette?

439
00:22:30,267 --> 00:22:35,022
the people in ffice
feel a little...

440
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:36,607
concerned...

441
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:42,237
that you're nursing a boy
of donovan's age.

442
00:22:42,237 --> 00:22:44,406
do they know breast milk
boosts the immune system,

443
00:22:44,448 --> 00:22:46,742
it's loaded with vitamins,
and in the third world,

444
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:49,953
it's not unusual to nurse babies
up to the age of 6?

445
00:22:49,995 --> 00:22:52,247
yeah, well, in the third world,
they don't have juice xes.

446
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:54,208
this is donovan's decision.

447
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:57,127
he will tell me when
he's ready to stop nursing.

448
00:22:57,169 --> 00:23:00,005
come on, baby birds
don't jump out of the nest.

449
00:23:00,047 --> 00:23:02,382
they need to be pushed.

450
00:23:02,424 --> 00:23:03,967
did you also know

451
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:07,471
that breast milk is thought
to raise i.q. scores?

452
00:23:13,977 --> 00:23:17,439
yeah, maybe if you had
weaned your kids a bit later,

453
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:19,274
they'd be more civilized.

454
00:23:19,274 --> 00:23:21,360
ouch.

455
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:23,779
i will not be judged
by you or anyone else,

456
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,864
and if people don't like
my breast-feeding,

457
00:23:25,906 --> 00:23:28,450
they can talk
to my lawyer.

458
00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:35,082
(laughing) and then
she took the salad bowl--

459
00:23:35,499 --> 00:23:37,501
put it on the floor
and said,

460
00:23:37,501 --> 00:23:40,462
"if you wanna act like a pig,
you can eat like a pig."

461
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:46,885
you know, i never thought
i'd have such a good time

462
00:23:46,927 --> 00:23:48,887
hanging out with my girlfriend
and her husband.

463
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:51,473
yeah, well, believe me,
behind all the laughs,

464
00:23:51,515 --> 00:23:54,059
there's still plenty of
bitterness and resentment.
oh, really?

465
00:23:54,101 --> 00:23:56,019
yeah.
hey, what do you say
you and i clear the table

466
00:23:56,061 --> 00:23:57,563
and bring on dessert?
no, no. i got it, i got it.

467
00:23:57,563 --> 00:23:59,523
no, honey,
you're not gonna do anything.

468
00:23:59,565 --> 00:24:01,316
you're in a wheelchair
for a reason, okay?

469
00:24:01,316 --> 00:24:02,776
why don't you let karl and i
do the dishes?

470
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:05,028
all right, but if i catch you
guys in there talking about me,

471
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:07,573
you're gonna be the one
in a wheelchair.
oh, really?

472
00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:09,199
yeah. mmm.
yeah?

473
00:24:09,241 --> 00:24:11,910
well, i think maybe the dishes
can wait for a second.

474
00:24:11,952 --> 00:24:14,079
(whispers) just a second?
(whispers)
yeah, just a second.

475
00:24:56,413 --> 00:24:57,789
what the hell?

476
00:24:57,831 --> 00:25:00,000
what's the matter?

477
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,959
aah!

478
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:03,003
jeez, ah, we got a leak.

479
00:25:04,296 --> 00:25:06,256
oh.
i'll sop up the water.

480
00:25:06,298 --> 00:25:09,218
why don't you see go see
the guy across the street?

481
00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:10,844
he's a plumber,
in the gray house.

482
00:25:10,844 --> 00:25:13,138

i'll be right back.

483
00:25:13,138 --> 00:25:15,182

484
00:25:18,477 --> 00:25:20,103

00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:22,064

00:25:58,809 --> 00:26:00,644
oh, ah, okay.

501
00:26:00,686 --> 00:26:02,145
i made it.

502
00:26:02,187 --> 00:26:05,190
so... mike, have you, uh,
have you known susan long?

503
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:07,359
a year and a half.

504
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:09,403
ah! ooh!

505
00:26:09,444 --> 00:26:10,988
didn't she mention
we dated?

506
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:14,449
no, no, she didn't.
she... she didn't.

507
00:26:17,452 --> 00:26:18,537
oh!

508
00:26:19,872 --> 00:26:23,083
can you excuse me, please?
(clears throat)

509
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:24,960
that smarts! aah!

510
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:30,465
liar!

511
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:33,302
i take it you met mike.
yeah, i did.

512
00:26:33,343 --> 00:26:34,970
please,
please let me explain.

513
00:26:35,012 --> 00:26:38,140
no, just let go of me.
ohh!

514
00:26:38,182 --> 00:26:40,017
i'm sorry.
okay.

515
00:26:40,058 --> 00:26:42,102
here, come on,
let me help you.

516
00:26:42,144 --> 00:26:45,981
hey, get away from her!
are you okay?
i'm fine!

517
00:26:46,023 --> 00:26:48,192
what the hell
is the matter with you?
hey, that was an accident!

518
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:50,652
that didn't look
like an accident.

519
00:26:50,694 --> 00:26:53,113
okay, mike, just--it's okay.
just go home.

520
00:26:53,155 --> 00:26:55,324
yeah, go home, mike.

521
00:26:55,365 --> 00:26:58,785
you touch her like that again,
you're gonna be dealing with me.

522
00:26:58,827 --> 00:27:00,704
you might wanna
get out of my face.

523
00:27:00,746 --> 00:27:02,372
or what?

524
00:27:02,414 --> 00:27:04,082
(groans) okay.

525
00:27:09,713 --> 00:27:12,508
ron, what are you doing?

526
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:14,426
oh, my god!

527
00:27:14,468 --> 00:27:17,221
guys, stop it.
stop it, right now!
all right, all right.

528
00:27:17,262 --> 00:27:20,265
i can't believe
i wasted my time with you.

529
00:27:20,307 --> 00:27:22,643
you've just been
leading me on!

530
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:25,437
you're obviously
still in love with this guy.

531
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:27,523
all right, i'm done.
no, ron, don't go!

532
00:27:27,523 --> 00:27:29,358
don't call me.

533
00:27:29,358 --> 00:27:31,652
(engine starts)
(susan) oh, ron!

534
00:27:31,652 --> 00:27:33,403
oh!

535
00:27:35,113 --> 00:27:37,366
ugh!

536
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:39,368
what the hell
isrong with you?

537
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:41,370
i thought
he was hurting you.

538
00:27:41,411 --> 00:27:44,414
well, he wasn't!

539
00:27:44,456 --> 00:27:46,583
and now
my boyfriend is gone.

540
00:27:48,544 --> 00:27:51,255
thank you very much.

541
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:06,019
okay, but the pole
is your friend, okay?

542
00:28:06,061 --> 00:28:08,522
push your boobs
up against it.
oh, i can't. they're new.

543
00:28:08,564 --> 00:28:10,399
well, do something,
cecile.

544
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,776
i'm losing my wood
down here.

545
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:16,572
wow!
that's a kickin' outfit.

546
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:19,491
well, thank you, sweetie.

547
00:28:20,075 --> 00:28:22,411
i clean up well
for a wetback, don't i?

548
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:27,791
look, i'm not
some sort of racist.

549
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:30,836
i just want what's best
for my baby girl.

550
00:28:30,878 --> 00:28:33,463
i mean, why should i settle
for middle-class mexicans

551
00:28:33,505 --> 00:28:36,675
when i know i can find
rich white folks to adopt her?

552
00:28:36,717 --> 00:28:38,927
<i>please.</i> do i look
middle class to you?</i>

553
00:28:38,927 --> 00:28:42,055
well, you didn't seem all that
rich in mr. beale's office.

554
00:28:42,055 --> 00:28:44,558
i mean, when i brought up
the idea of gifts

555
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:46,310
to your husband,

556
00:28:46,351 --> 00:28:48,645
he acted like he couldn't
even afford a harley.

557
00:28:48,687 --> 00:28:50,981
so is that what it's gonna take
to change your mind--a gift?

558
00:28:51,023 --> 00:28:52,566
fine. what do you want?

559
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:55,194
i don't know.

560
00:28:58,614 --> 00:29:00,824
you like jewelry?

561
00:29:00,824 --> 00:29:01,992
well, here.

562
00:29:02,034 --> 00:29:03,869
are these real diamonds?

563
00:29:03,911 --> 00:29:06,830
honey, the one in the center
is 3 karats.

564
00:29:06,872 --> 00:29:09,208
i never touched
a real diamond before.

565
00:29:09,249 --> 00:29:11,627
well, my husband and i
can expose you

566
00:29:11,668 --> 00:29:14,546
to a lot of nice new things.
well, only if i let you have my baby.

567
00:29:16,173 --> 00:29:19,384
there's no such thing
as a free lunch.

568
00:29:22,721 --> 00:29:24,014
okay.

569
00:29:24,056 --> 00:29:25,682
really?

570
00:29:25,724 --> 00:29:27,184
just like that?

571
00:29:27,226 --> 00:29:29,353
just like that.

572
00:29:29,394 --> 00:29:31,355
of course, you probably
shouldn't tell the lawyer

573
00:29:31,355 --> 00:29:33,148
about our understanding,

574
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:35,734
because then we'll have to deal
with percentages and all that.

575
00:29:35,776 --> 00:29:37,444
i always hated math.

576
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:46,161
what's wrong?

577
00:29:46,203 --> 00:29:49,665
you never gave a crap
that we were mexican, did you?

578
00:29:49,706 --> 00:29:51,750
not really.

579
00:29:51,792 --> 00:29:53,794
so why put me through this?

580
00:29:53,794 --> 00:29:55,254
because i thought,

581
00:29:55,295 --> 00:29:57,756
if it looked like
you weren't gonna get my baby

582
00:29:57,798 --> 00:30:00,425
that you might be
just a bit more generous.

583
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:03,595
wow. you're a lot smarter
than i thought.

584
00:30:03,637 --> 00:30:06,223
i'm smarter
than everybody thinks.

585
00:30:12,229 --> 00:30:15,065
where's my mom?
i'm thirsty.

586
00:30:15,107 --> 00:30:17,109
oh, i'm sorry, honey.

587
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:21,238
your mom... is in her office
on a conference call,

588
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,533
and she's busy, so you're just
gonna have to wait, okay?

589
00:30:24,575 --> 00:30:25,993
what's that?

590
00:30:25,993 --> 00:30:28,620
that's chocolate milk.
i shouldn't be having it.

591
00:30:31,874 --> 00:30:33,959
have you ever had any?

592
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:35,752
mnh-mnh.

593
00:30:35,794 --> 00:30:38,213
follow me.

594
00:30:39,464 --> 00:30:42,009
here. go ahead, try it.

595
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:44,720
come on, you'll really like it.
i promise.

596
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,221
come on, yeah.

597
00:30:46,263 --> 00:30:48,724
all the grown-ups
are drinking it.

598
00:30:48,765 --> 00:30:50,350
yeah, that's good.

599
00:30:50,392 --> 00:30:52,978
just... chug it on down.

600
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,104
good.

601
00:30:54,146 --> 00:30:56,231
you like that?

602
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:01,028
would you like dessert
or another glass of wine?

603
00:31:01,069 --> 00:31:04,239
oh, no, thank you.
i have to run. just the check.

604
00:31:05,991 --> 00:31:07,993
i have a charity event
this weekend,

605
00:31:07,993 --> 00:31:09,953
and i have to find
a cocktail dress

606
00:31:09,995 --> 00:31:11,663
before the store closes.

607
00:31:11,705 --> 00:31:14,208
but everything
was just yummy.

608
00:31:15,626 --> 00:31:17,961
(andrew)
looks good on your ass.

609
00:31:18,003 --> 00:31:20,130
thank you.
yeah.

610
00:31:26,386 --> 00:31:29,223
uh, hey, mrs. van de kamp.

611
00:31:29,264 --> 00:31:32,059
what do you think you're doing?
you're supposed to be grounded.

612
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,311
i'm, uh, buying a belt.

613
00:31:34,353 --> 00:31:36,813
with what?
you don't have any money.

614
00:31:38,273 --> 00:31:41,443
you took that out of my purse.
give that back.

615
00:31:41,485 --> 00:31:43,946
we are going home. wait till
i tell the judge about

616
00:31:43,987 --> 00:31:46,156
you stealing my credit cards
and sneaking off.

617
00:31:46,156 --> 00:31:48,283
it's gonna do wonders for
your little emancipation case.

618
00:31:48,325 --> 00:31:50,369
i don't think you're gonna
let this get to the court.

619
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:52,120
oh, and why is that?

620
00:31:52,162 --> 00:31:54,957
because then i'd be forced
to testify about my childhood.

621
00:31:54,998 --> 00:31:57,835
so? you had one of the loveliest
childhoods i've ever known.

622
00:31:57,876 --> 00:31:59,378
you sure about that?

623
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:02,422
'cause i'm staing
to remember some abuse.

624
00:32:02,464 --> 00:32:04,925
andrew, the judge is not
seriously gonna believe

625
00:32:04,967 --> 00:32:06,760
that i beat you.

626
00:32:06,802 --> 00:32:09,429
oh, i'm not talking
about that kind of abuse.

627
00:32:09,471 --> 00:32:11,640
you know, it's funny...

628
00:32:11,682 --> 00:32:13,642
the angrier i get,

629
00:32:13,684 --> 00:32:15,644
the more these repressed
memories start to come up.

630
00:32:18,981 --> 00:32:20,816
you can't be serious.

631
00:32:20,858 --> 00:32:25,195
like, touching me in places
you shouldn't have...

632
00:32:27,489 --> 00:32:30,534
no one is ever gonna
believe a word of that.

633
00:32:30,576 --> 00:32:33,370
yeah, well,
you know how people are.

634
00:32:33,412 --> 00:32:35,789
they might say
that they believe you,

635
00:32:35,789 --> 00:32:38,792
but...
th'll always wonder.

636
00:32:40,711 --> 00:32:43,338
so if i were you...

637
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:46,216
i'd back the hell off.

638
00:32:46,258 --> 00:32:47,718
come on, justin.

639
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:50,888
i'm gonna buy you
something pretty.

640
00:32:54,224 --> 00:32:55,392
justin!

641
00:33:01,023 --> 00:33:02,524
on second thought,

642
00:33:02,524 --> 00:33:04,860
i will have
another glass of wine.

643
00:33:12,326 --> 00:33:14,828
you can leave the bottle.

644
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:10,027
yeah?

645
00:35:10,027 --> 00:35:13,947
hi, it's bree van de kamp.
i didn't know who else to call,

646
00:35:13,947 --> 00:35:23,582
and, well, i'm in a bit
of a situation.

647
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:25,918
well...

648
00:35:26,251 --> 00:35:28,045
(laughing) how did you
get stuck like that?

649
00:35:28,045 --> 00:35:30,547
i would rather
not discuss it right now.

650
00:35:30,756 --> 00:35:34,301
man, the other security guys
are not gonna believe this.

651
00:35:34,343 --> 00:35:35,802
do you mind?

652
00:35:37,721 --> 00:35:39,431
didn't.

653
00:35:39,473 --> 00:35:43,227
your son threatened you
with "repressed memories"?

654
00:35:43,227 --> 00:35:47,272
oh, my god,
he is <i>seriously</i> twisted.</i>

655
00:35:47,314 --> 00:35:49,066
i gotta meet this kid.

656
00:35:49,107 --> 00:35:51,109
you sound like
you're impressed.

657
00:35:51,151 --> 00:35:52,611
i sorta am.

658
00:35:55,781 --> 00:35:58,534
(scoffs) i'm raising a monster,
is what i'm raising.

659
00:35:58,575 --> 00:36:00,369
it's no wonder i drink.

660
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:05,207
i don't know why i said that.

661
00:36:05,249 --> 00:36:07,417
maybe it's true.

662
00:36:07,459 --> 00:36:10,420
no, it makes it und like
i think i have a problem,

663
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,422
and i don't.

664
00:36:12,422 --> 00:36:16,468
look, i don't wanna get
into a fight or anything,

665
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:19,596
but you passed out
in a department store,

666
00:36:19,638 --> 00:36:22,307
and in my way of thinking,

667
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:24,142
that <i>is</i> a problem.</i>

668
00:36:24,184 --> 00:36:27,688
tonight was
a very unusual situation.

669
00:36:42,494 --> 00:36:46,290
i wish you could've
known me when...

670
00:36:46,331 --> 00:36:48,792
rex was alive
and my kids were young,

671
00:36:48,792 --> 00:36:51,253
and everything was...

672
00:36:51,295 --> 00:36:53,255
the way
it was supposed to be.

673
00:36:56,216 --> 00:37:00,762
i think you really
would've liked me... so much.

674
00:37:00,804 --> 00:37:04,266
i like you just fine.

675
00:37:04,308 --> 00:37:06,435
really?

676
00:37:11,398 --> 00:37:13,775
because i don't.

677
00:37:27,372 --> 00:37:28,540
bye.

678
00:37:32,711 --> 00:37:33,712
mom?

679
00:37:35,547 --> 00:37:36,715
andrew?

680
00:38:02,449 --> 00:38:04,076
caleb?

681
00:38:04,117 --> 00:38:06,328
hey, danielle.

682
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:08,956
what are you doing here?

683
00:38:10,958 --> 00:38:12,626
happy birthday.

684
00:38:14,628 --> 00:38:16,588
you really
have to go home.

685
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:19,216
if my mom knew you were here,
she'd freak.

686
00:38:19,466 --> 00:38:22,386
don't you want to wear it?
no, i don't, now please leave

687
00:38:22,386 --> 00:38:56,378
i can help you with it.
no! didn't you hear me,you freak?! leave!

688
00:38:56,378 --> 00:38:58,505
what's wrong?

689
00:38:58,547 --> 00:39:02,426
you can tell everyone
in the office to relax.

690
00:39:02,426 --> 00:39:04,469
he won't
take my milk anymore.

691
00:39:04,511 --> 00:39:06,513
already? (gasps)

692
00:39:06,555 --> 00:39:08,807
i mean, i'm sorry.

693
00:39:08,849 --> 00:39:10,142
yeah, i bet.

694
00:39:10,184 --> 00:39:12,144
i mean, i'm not naive.

695
00:39:12,186 --> 00:39:14,646
i just didn't think
it would be so soon.

696
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:17,399
oh, sweetie...

697
00:39:17,441 --> 00:39:22,613
i know that we wanna keep them
young as long as we can,

698
00:39:22,654 --> 00:39:24,323
but kids grow up.

699
00:39:24,364 --> 00:39:25,866
they just do.

700
00:39:25,908 --> 00:39:28,410
i know.
if that's not bad enough,

701
00:39:28,452 --> 00:39:31,121
now i'm gonna get fat again.

702
00:39:31,121 --> 00:39:32,206
huh?

703
00:39:32,247 --> 00:39:34,208
breast-feeding
was the only thing

704
00:39:34,249 --> 00:39:36,210
that kept the weight off.

705
00:39:36,251 --> 00:39:39,588
every mealtime was like
doing 30 minutes of cardio.

706
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,924
now i'm gonna have
to join a gym!

707
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:46,220
wow, that is...

708
00:39:46,261 --> 00:39:47,888
really a bummer.

709
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:49,306
it is.

710
00:39:49,348 --> 00:39:52,226
it really is.

711
00:39:52,226 --> 00:39:55,729
(sobbing)

712
00:40:13,455 --> 00:40:16,750
hey, uh,
julie let me in.

713
00:40:16,792 --> 00:40:19,211
i can see that.

714
00:40:19,253 --> 00:40:21,797
so, what, did you run out
of strangers to beat up

715
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:24,591
on the street, and you're going
house to house now?

716
00:40:24,633 --> 00:40:26,468
i feel really awful
about what happened.

717
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:28,804
if you don't wanna be
my boyfriend, fine.

718
00:40:28,846 --> 00:40:31,849
don't beat up the only guy who
wants to volunteer for the job.

719
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:33,433
look,
i know i overreacted.

720
00:40:33,475 --> 00:40:35,853
but come on,
the way he was yelling at you?

721
00:40:35,894 --> 00:40:37,855
i deserved it, believe me.
after what i did...

722
00:40:37,855 --> 00:40:40,774
(sighs) god,
this is such a mess.

723
00:40:40,816 --> 00:40:43,110
he won't even
return my phone calls.

724
00:40:43,152 --> 00:40:45,654
what'd you do?

725
00:40:45,696 --> 00:40:48,490
i said something to dr. ron
before the operation,

726
00:40:48,532 --> 00:40:51,243
and it just...
devastated him.

727
00:40:51,285 --> 00:40:53,120
what?

728
00:40:53,162 --> 00:40:55,247
i can't tell you.

729
00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:57,249
yeah, you can.
you can tell me anything.

730
00:40:57,291 --> 00:40:58,917
you know that.

731
00:40:58,959 --> 00:41:00,752
mom, um, phone call.

732
00:41:00,794 --> 00:41:02,254
it's dr. ron.

733
00:41:02,296 --> 00:41:03,922
oh?

734
00:41:03,922 --> 00:41:06,383
um...

735
00:41:06,425 --> 00:41:08,218
i need to take this.

736
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,554
(sighs)

737
00:41:10,596 --> 00:41:13,599
you, um, you wanna
talk about this later?

738
00:41:16,351 --> 00:41:18,103
no.

739
00:41:18,145 --> 00:41:20,189
no, not really. um...

740
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:22,941
what's the point?

741
00:41:31,992 --> 00:41:33,327
(telephone beeps)

742
00:41:33,368 --> 00:41:34,703
hi.

743
00:41:36,747 --> 00:41:38,665
<i>at that precise moment,</i></i>

744
00:41:38,707 --> 00:41:42,544
<i>as dr. hanson mills was cutting</i>
 <i>yet another umbilical cord,</i></i>

745
00:41:42,586 --> 00:41:48,258
<i>other ties were being severed</i>
 <i>all over town...</i></i>

746
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,761
<i>like the one</i>
 <i>between a child and the mother</i></i>

747
00:41:50,802 --> 00:41:54,056
<i>who didn't want him</i>
 <i>to grow up so quickly...</i></i>

748
00:41:54,056 --> 00:41:57,267
<i>or the one</i>
 <i>between a case of fine wine</i></i>

749
00:41:57,309 --> 00:42:00,062
<i>and the housewife</i>
 <i>who hadn't wanted to admit</i></i>

750
00:42:00,103 --> 00:42:03,023
<i>that she had a problem...</i></i>

751
00:42:03,023 --> 00:42:06,193
<i>or the one between a woman</i>
 <i>and the boyfriend</i></i>

752
00:42:06,193 --> 00:42:08,862
<i>who couldn't forgive</i>
 <i>her betrayal.</i></i>

753
00:42:11,031 --> 00:42:13,826
<i>the choice to separate</i>
 <i>from what we love is painful...</i></i>

754
00:42:13,826 --> 00:42:17,996
hey. how's my girl today?

755
00:42:18,038 --> 00:42:19,998
how are <i>both</i> of my girls?</i>

756
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,000
<i>the only thing worse...</i></i>

757
00:42:22,042 --> 00:42:25,420
we're doing good.
we're doing real good.

758
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:28,924
<i>is when meone we've trusted</i>
 <i>makes the choice for us.</i></i>

759
00:42:28,924 --> 00:42:31,093
