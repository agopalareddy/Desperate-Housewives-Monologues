Previously on... "Desperate Housewives"

3
00:00:05,214 --> 00:00:06,381
did you leave the door open?

4
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:07,549
Call the police!

5
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:08,800
Is that the guy who broke into your house?

6
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:11,053
Arrests were made... yeah,that's him.

7
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:12,888
I just want a chance to get to know you.

8
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:14,431
Well,I don't want to know you.

9
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:15,807
Fathers were confronted...

10
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:17,518
who's sister mary bernard?

11
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:19,561
You do not want to start a war with me.

12
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:20,687
Bring it on.

13
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,189
Boundaries were drawn...

14
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:24,608
mr. Williams was responsible for your husband's death.

15
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:27,903
And everyone learned that sometimes justice is served...

16
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,446
we need to call an ambulance.

17
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:32,032
Without saying a word.

18
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:39,706
There were many ways to tell Bree van de kamp was a lady.

19
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:40,832
Thank you very much.

20
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:43,836
She was courteous to those around her,

21
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:47,005
she moved with elegance and grace

22
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:50,717
and she was very careful to never let others know

23
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:52,469
what she was thinking.

24
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:55,681
Mrs. Van de kamp,thank you for coming on such short notice.

25
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:57,182
So what's happened?

26
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:59,017
Have you had any luck finding george?

27
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,687
You see,like most well-bred women...

28
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:03,647
george is dead.

29
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,649
He committed suicide last night at a hotel.

30
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,818
Bree had something to hide.

31
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:11,071
Oh,um...

32
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:18,453
well,um,it was very good of you to tell me in person,truly.

33
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:23,000
Actually,uh,there's more.

34
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:25,169
More?

35
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,423
Do you recognize this?

36
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:33,302
Those are my panties.How did you...

37
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:35,846
we assume mr. Williams stole them.

38
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:37,014
Where did you find them?

39
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:43,312
Mr. Williams had a room filled with,um...unsavory items.

40
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:44,646
It was like a shrine.

41
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,441
"Unsavory items"?Well,what does that mean?

42
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,193
You don't want to know.

43
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:50,694
Just so you're aware,the "daily tribune"

44
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,362
is starting to sniff around this story.

45
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:53,697
The editor's a good friend of mine.

46
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:55,032
I'm pretty sure I can quash it,

47
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:57,034
but you might want to tell your family what's going on,

48
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,869
just in case.

49
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,581
What is that?

50
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,416
I am so sorry. You weren't supposed to see that.

51
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,834
Mudge,get that out of here.

52
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:10,172
No,wait!Is that supposed to be me?

53
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:12,925
Well...

54
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,220
it's hard to say.

55
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:17,596
I don't understand. I mean

56
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:22,184
what would george be doing with a life-size doll?

57
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:26,813
oh,dear lord.

58
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:28,649
- Go ahead. 
- Oh,hold it

59
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:29,900
What are you gonna do with that?

60
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:32,402
Well,until we close the file on mr. Williams,

61
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,112
she's considered evidence.

62
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:35,614
We'll have to take her back to the station.

63
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:38,492
I am so sorry about this,Mrs. Van de kamp.

64
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:41,495
I know how difficult all this must be.

65
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:47,334
Don't you worry about me,detective Barton.

66
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,419
I will be just fine.

67
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:53,882
Yes,there were many ways to tell that bree was a lady,

68
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:58,512
but the surest was to watch how she maintained her dignity

69
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:03,684
in even the most undignified of situations.

Desperate Housewives 
Season 2 Episode 10

73
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:15,153
It's a story as old as time itself--

74
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:19,116
the return of the prodigal son.

75
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:24,913
And no matter how many times it's repeated...

76
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:31,128
or how the details might vary...

77
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:34,381
or how the names might change...

78
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:39,344
the story always ends the same way...

79
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:44,766
in the tender embrace of a loving father.

80
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,311
Hi,dad.

81
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,945
Susan mayer told me she gave you some money to go to Utah.

82
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:59,239
Yeah,I had no idea where to look for you,though,

83
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,699
and the money started to run out,

84
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,576
so I thought that maybe you'd come back here.

85
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,578
You're a smart kid.

86
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,079
Can I ask you something?

87
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,415
Of course. Anything.

88
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:13,462
Well,when you left town,

89
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,632
Mrs. Tillman said that my real mother was

90
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:19,676
a junkie from Utah.

91
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,473
That's right.

92
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,808
So...

93
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:31,396
who's my dad?

94
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,817
I don't know.

95
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:39,196
It could have been anyone.

96
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,164
Thanks for the faucet.

97
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,458
This leak is driving me crazy.

98
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:52,334
What do I owe you?

99
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:53,126
Oh,it's no rush.

100
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,170
Just pay me when I install it.

101
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:58,090
Hey,there!

102
00:04:58,632 --> 00:04:59,883
Have you seen today's paper?

103
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,760
No,not yet.

104
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:04,888
Ohh. There's a follow-up on that guy you caught last week.

105
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:08,517
"Police seek help in identifying mystery vagrant."

106
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:09,977
They don't know the man's name yet?

107
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,104
They're not even sure that he knows how to talk.

108
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:13,647
Think they're going to hold him in the psych ward

109
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:16,191
until they figure out who he is

110
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,570
Well,I will certainly rest easier knowing that

111
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:21,613
he's not roaming around our neighborhood.

112
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,740
see you!

113
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:27,035
Thanks again for the faucet.

114
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,662
Sure.

115
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:35,919
What are we gonna do about Caleb?

116
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:40,424
Obviously,we are going to go and get him

117
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:53,812
- Where are my cuffs? 
- Bottom drawer.

118
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,814
Ah.

119
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,566
So when do I tell people you'll be back?

120
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:59,985
Couple,maybe three days.

121
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:06,074
What the hell's this?

122
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,242
It's the ball gag.

123
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:09,119
I thought you wanted it.

124
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:11,705
We do not recycle ball gags.

125
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,874
Take a look at the teeth marks.

126
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,293
it's gross.

127
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:20,714
I'd like to think that we're better than that.

128
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:22,841
Hey, Monroe?

129
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:24,134
You sure you don't want any help?

130
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:25,844
The guy's dangerous.

131
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,306
He's a half-wit,Jerry.

132
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:30,849
If I can handle you,

133
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:32,976
I can handle him.

134
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:38,482
So he poisoned Rex?

135
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:40,025
Sweet,little George Williams.

136
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:43,237
Well,it turns out he wasn't so sweet after all.

137
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,281
Anyway,there's a chance that some of this may wind up in the paper,

138
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,617
so I wanted you to hear it from me first.

139
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:50,619
Bree,I'm so sorry.

140
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:53,413
Yeah,like you haven't been through enough.

141
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:55,624
God,and he's our pharmacist.

142
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,334
It's enough to turn you holistic.

143
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:58,585
I know this sounds awful,

144
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,420
but I'm kind of glad the guy's dead.

145
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:03,799
Oh,I hope that little creep suffered.

146
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:06,426
Well,we'll never know.

147
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:13,725
That's Andrew back from camp hennessey.

148
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:14,726
I've got to go.

149
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,311
Does he know yet?

150
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:17,855
He hasn't got a clue.

151
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,274
How do you think he's gonna react?

152
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:22,860
All right,what the hell is going on?

153
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:26,196
I know you didn't take me out of kid jail for my health.

154
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,910
I'll get back to you later.

155
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,084
So are the police sure?

156
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:40,419
Yeah.

157
00:07:40,586 --> 00:07:44,131
They found data in George's personal computer

158
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:46,633
and also records at his pharmacy that

159
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,887
pretty much proves that he was poisoning your father.

160
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:53,432
Did they say why he killed him?

161
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:57,186
Well,the detective seems to think he was trying to

162
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:59,938
get your father out of the way so...

163
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:02,482
he could marry me.

164
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,486
Honey,please use your coaster.

165
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:07,613
That's gonna leave a ring.

166
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:10,282
My father was murdered because of you,

167
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:11,533
so as far as I'm concerned,

168
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,327
you no longer get to tell me what to do.

169
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:15,913
Andrew,that is not fair.

170
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,998
You brought that psycho into our house!

171
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:19,249
You sat him down at our table.

172
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,001
Just how fair do you expect me to be?

173
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:22,836
Andrew,George williams fooled a lot of people.

174
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,214
Yeah,well,he didn't fool me.

175
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,675
Andrew,I'm not trying to minimize my part in this.

176
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,762
Believe me,I hate myself for what's happened.

177
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:33,138
Good.

178
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,933
Now we have something in common.

179
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,643
Oh,by the way,

180
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,311
I'm gonna call my friend justin

181
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,271
and have him come over and spend the night tonight.

182
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:45,025
Justin? Is he a friend of yours from school or church?

183
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,611
What kind of friend is he?

184
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:52,282
The real good kind.

185
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:56,286
Andrew,it is inappropriate for you to have somebody over.

186
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,038
You just got home.

187
00:08:58,163 --> 00:08:59,498
Like I said,

188
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:03,252
you don't get to tell me what to do anymore.

189
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,969
You came.

190
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,095
Did I have a choice?

191
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,972
Well,sure.

192
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:16,932
Because at the hospital,you sounded like you were

193
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,559
fully prepared to blackmail me

194
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:21,061
into having some kind of a relationship with you.

195
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,688
That was just the heat of the moment,

196
00:09:22,855 --> 00:09:24,356
and once you get to know me,you'll understand that

197
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:27,901
I am not the kind of person who could ever,ever resort to blackmail.

198
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:30,320
Well,I wish you'd made that clear in the hospital.

199
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:33,156
Could have saved me a trip.

200
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:34,658
So are you coming in?

201
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:38,287
Well,I got a lunch hour to kill.

202
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,501
That was my first halloween.I was 2.

203
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:46,378
What do you think I am?

204
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:47,880
I don't know

205
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:49,548
Oh,come on,just guess.You can tell.

206
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:52,050
Uh,a homeless person?

207
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:54,595
No,Addison,I'm a chicken.

208
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:56,263
See? Those are feather shanging around.

209
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:00,517
Oh. I thought that was supposed to be trash.

210
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:02,978
Uh,look,are we done here?

211
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:05,814
You haven't even finished your coffee.

212
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:07,566
I got to get back to work.

213
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:10,527
Oh,well,we--we haven't even finished the high school years.

214
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:11,778
I wanted to show you this one.

215
00:10:11,904 --> 00:10:13,780
This was from the father-daughter dance.

216
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,950
I had to take my mother'shairstylist.

217
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,871
What do you want from me,susan?

218
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:26,168
Well,I-I just want to share more than our D.N.A. I...

219
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,295
I wanted to have a relationship with you.

220
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:32,257
None of this means anything to you?

221
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:34,885
I'll take the hobo picture.

222
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:39,389
Actually,it was...fine.

223
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:41,266
What's this?

224
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:43,685
Our company insurance policy.You ever bother to read it?

225
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:45,729
I'm going to say no,but don't tell.

226
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:48,398
We have day care, Ed, day care.

227
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:51,151
Do you realize that since we fired half the staff,

228
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,654
you and I have barely left the building?

229
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,113
My kids are forgetting who I am.

230
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:56,782
I hear you.I have 17-month-old

231
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:58,492
who I haven't actually seen awake in weeks.

232
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:02,704
See? All we need isa minimum participation

233
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:06,667
of,uh...16 kids.

234
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:08,544
My kids,your baby,

235
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:10,087
sally in accounting has three,

236
00:11:10,254 --> 00:11:12,172
that new guyin human resources has two

237
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,675
and we hit the mother lode with the mormon receptionist.

238
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:17,886
She just popped out number 6.There. 16.

239
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,429
15. My wife won't do it.

240
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:20,639
Well,maybe if I talkedto her.

241
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:23,809
No,I'm telling you,this day care thing is a non-starter.

242
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:25,936
Fran won't even let anyone else hold the baby.

243
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:28,689
Well,she won't just take sometime off for a couple of hours?

244
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:32,359
Lynette,if I hadn'tcut that umbilical cord with my own two hands,

245
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:35,904
I swear they would still be attached.

246
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,407
But if you want to try...

247
00:11:38,574 --> 00:11:41,451
more power to you.

248
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:52,296
You! What the hell did you do with my husband?!

249
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:53,672
Please restrain yourself,gabrielle.

250
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,007
You're in a house of god.

251
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:57,050
Tell me where he is!

252
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,303
Everywhere,of course.

253
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:02,097
Not god,my husband.

254
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,474
Gaby,what are you doing here?

255
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,476
I was just about to ask you the same thing.

256
00:12:06,602 --> 00:12:08,312
You were supposed to meet me at the spa.

257
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,814
I was just helping sister mary with the mailings for the fund-raiser.

258
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:13,192
The church is about to senda relief team to Botswana

259
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,152
to help with the drought.

260
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:16,778
That's your excuse?

261
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:18,947
We missed side-by-side water massages.

262
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:21,325
I had to book them weeks in advance.

263
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,160
Okay,you missed a massage.

264
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:26,413
It's unfortunate,but there are people dying in Botswana.

265
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,248
There are going to be people dying in this church

266
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:31,168
if you don't wipe that patronizing look off your face!

267
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,171
What is your problem?

268
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:37,299
Sister mary,will you excuse us,please?

269
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:39,510
Certainly.

270
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:44,389
We are supposed to be working on our marriage,carlos,

271
00:12:44,515 --> 00:12:47,684
but we can't do thatas long as our lady of perpetual stick-up-her-butt

272
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:50,646
has you worrying about thirsty orphans.

273
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:53,607
You're blaming sister mary for the tension in our marriage?

274
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:55,067
She wants us fighting.

275
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:56,443
She wants you to get tired of me

276
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:58,362
and walk out so she can have you all to herself.

277
00:12:58,487 --> 00:12:59,988
That's crazy. She's a nun.

278
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,990
She may wear a habit and the beads,

279
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:03,242
but at the end of the day,

280
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:05,327
she is still a woman,just like me,

281
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,496
and I know what I'm capable of.

282
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:09,498
She is a woman...

283
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:13,961
but she is nothing like you.

284
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,464
Carlos,where are you going?

285
00:13:19,258 --> 00:13:21,510
Carlos!

286
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:26,014
You look tense,gabrielle.

287
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:29,685
Perhaps you should think about getting a massage.

288
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,736
hi, Susan,it's Addison. Are you there?

289
00:13:39,862 --> 00:13:41,905
Hi. Hi,yeah,I'm here.

290
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:43,574
Good. You're home.

291
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:44,950
Uh-huh. What's up?

292
00:13:45,117 --> 00:13:47,578
You know you were saying you wanted to be part of my life?

293
00:13:47,703 --> 00:13:48,745
Yeah.

294
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:50,122
I'm at the police station.

295
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:52,499
I need you to come bail me out.

296
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:56,170
Solicitation? You were arrested for solicitation?

297
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:58,338
It was entrapment.I'm the victim here.

298
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:00,299
But you were with a prostitute.

299
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:01,967
Apparently not.

300
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:04,344
I asked her three times--"are you a cop?"

301
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:06,847
They got to tell you,but she didn't say "boo."

302
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:08,473
I thought this was America!

303
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:11,268
Addison,you just got caught paying for sex.

304
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:13,395
Now is not the time to wrap yourself in the flag.

305
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:14,605
Don't give me that look.

306
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:16,440
It wasn't my fault.I'm sorry.

307
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:19,484
How is trying to pick up a hooker not your fault?

308
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,945
I was at the store,I was working on my computer

309
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,906
and then,you know,they have these ads?

310
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:27,701
They pop up on the screen and they ask if you want to have a hot date.

311
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:29,995
Well,it gets a fellow worked up.

312
00:14:30,162 --> 00:14:33,874
Can't you just go home and have sex with your wife like a normal person?

313
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:36,210
She's a 68-year-old woman.

314
00:14:36,335 --> 00:14:38,295
That bell stopped ringing for me years ago.

315
00:14:38,337 --> 00:14:41,340
Oh,my god.Stop. Right now.

316
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:43,926
I'm gonna gopay this thing.

317
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:52,351
So am I off the hook now?

318
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:53,769
What?

319
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:56,230
This whole father-daughter thing,

320
00:14:56,355 --> 00:14:58,357
we're done,right?

321
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:02,152
Thursday,coffee at 2.Be on time.

322
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:05,280
Don't take this the wrong way,but are you dim?

323
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:09,660
Okay,I didn't exactly love what I found out about you today,

324
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:14,540
but the goal was to learn,not to judge.

325
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,459
I bring the coffee.

326
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:21,547
That crap you made burnt a hole in my stomach.

327
00:15:43,694 --> 00:15:45,279
This is tunde.

328
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:48,115
He lost both his parents to this drought.

329
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,868
In fact,water is always scarce in botswana.

330
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:53,537
The national currency is called the pula or raindrop...

331
00:15:53,537 --> 00:15:55,831
hello, Gabrielle. What brings you here?

332
00:15:55,998 --> 00:15:58,625
I'm concerned about the drought in Kenya.

333
00:15:58,876 --> 00:16:00,085
Botswana.

334
00:16:00,252 --> 00:16:02,421
Yeah,and you?

335
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:04,631
Well,I'm organizing this relief trip.

336
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:06,258
We leave in a week.

337
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,093
Well, Bon voyage,father.

338
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:09,761
I'm not going myself.

339
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:11,847
We had to scale back our relief efforts this year.

340
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:14,308
We even had to cut a few of the aid workers from the trip.

341
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:17,561
Sister Mary,sister Gret awere so disappointed.

342
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:19,855
If you just want to hand some of...

343
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:21,857
sister mary was going on the trip?

344
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:25,152
Well,sister mary always goes for at least a few months,

345
00:16:25,277 --> 00:16:26,820
but when our funding came up short,

346
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:29,239
she graciously offered to step aside,

347
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:32,326
said there's plenty of god's work to do here.

348
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:33,869
Thank you, Carlos. Appreciate it.

349
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:37,623
I bet she did.

350
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:42,085
How much cash are you short,father?

351
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,381
We plan to set up a modern system of irrigation.

352
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:47,925
I'm sorry to interrupt,sister mary,

353
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,801
but I have an announcement.

354
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:54,765
I have just received a donation of $8,000,

355
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:57,059
which means that sister Mary and sister Greta

356
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,395
will be able to join our relief trip to Botswana.

357
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:09,279
it just goes to show angels are everywhere.

358
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:22,459
Hey. I'm here to see Lynette Scavo.

359
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:24,586
Oh,hi. Excuse me. Hi.

360
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,296
I'm lynette.You must be Fran.

361
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:28,674
Hi. Ed said you needed to talk to me.

362
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,926
I couldn't imagine about what.

363
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:33,428
Oh,well,come on in my office.

364
00:17:34,847 --> 00:17:37,432
You want me to put my daughter in day care?

365
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:39,101
But I'm a stay-at-home mom.

366
00:17:39,268 --> 00:17:42,396
I'm not suggesting that you sign her up for all day.

367
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:45,732
Maybe just a couple of hours in the afternoon.

368
00:17:45,858 --> 00:17:47,067
Wouldn't that be great?

369
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:50,612
Have some time to yourself, relax, unwind?

370
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:54,575
I don't need to unwind. I love taking care of little Mindy.

371
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,536
Oh,of course,of course,

372
00:17:57,828 --> 00:18:01,331
but we all have days when we're starting to lose it.

373
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:03,834
Wouldn't it be nice to have some place to take her

374
00:18:04,001 --> 00:18:06,378
before you want to strangle her?

375
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:12,467
I cherish every moment I spend with her,truly.

376
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,179
Really?

377
00:18:16,305 --> 00:18:20,309
Yeah. Look,I'm gonna level with you.

378
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:23,312
Parcher and Murphy can't have a day care center

379
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:25,606
unless we haveat least 16 kids

380
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:28,734
and without little Mindy,we only have 15.

381
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:32,946
Well,that's not my problem.

382
00:18:33,572 --> 00:18:38,785
Okay. Okay. I just thought I'd give it a shot.

383
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:42,539
Well,I wish I could help you,but I can't.

384
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:44,791
Okay.

385
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:50,714
- Lynette 
- Yeah

386
00:18:50,881 --> 00:18:53,133
- Can I ask you something? 
- Yeah

387
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:57,262
Why did you have kids if you weren't gonna raise them?

388
00:18:57,721 --> 00:19:00,641
Excuse me? Well,I just don't understand who

389
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:02,392
say they want to be mothers,

390
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:07,022
but then hand their kids over to glorified babysitters.

391
00:19:08,232 --> 00:19:11,318
I work because my family needs me to.

392
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:15,572
Oh,dear,I've upset you, and that wasn't my intention.

393
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,783
I bet.

394
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:20,369
Make no mistake,I'm a good mother.

395
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:23,038
That's the difference between us--

396
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:25,374
I couldn't settle for being a good mother.

397
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:28,627
I want to be a great one.

398
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:30,712
Bye-bye.

399
00:19:30,838 --> 00:19:33,131
Bye-bye.

400
00:19:48,564 --> 00:19:50,274
Oh,hi,alberta.How are you?

401
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,151
Were you the one that sent out those neighborhood watch pamphlets?

402
00:19:53,235 --> 00:19:56,405
I was wondering if maybe you had any extra copies.

403
00:19:56,738 --> 00:20:01,285
Or I'll just borrow one from somebody else. Thanks.

404
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:16,633
Yep,looks like carol'spenmanship.

405
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:19,178
This is ridiculous. What does she think,we're having an affair?

406
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:21,680
Well,she probably saw you drop me off yesterday,

407
00:20:21,805 --> 00:20:23,223
and she assumed the worst.

408
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:24,933
Well,now you're gonna have to tell her the truth.

409
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:27,603
Oh,no,no,no. I'd catch holy hell.

410
00:20:27,728 --> 00:20:29,438
Oh,so you want me to catch it for you?

411
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:31,315
I mean, you, yourselfs aid she's crazy.

412
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,860
I don't want to wake up tomorrow morning and find my tires slashed.

413
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:38,822
All right. I'll talk to her.

414
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:49,708
Hello, Edie. Do you have something you'd like to say?

415
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:54,463
No. That pretty much says it all.

416
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:10,229
Sister Mary,what a lovely surprise.

417
00:21:10,354 --> 00:21:12,648
Well,I couldn't leave withoutsaying good-bye, Gabrielle.

418
00:21:12,773 --> 00:21:15,025
Oh,that's so sweet.

419
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:16,527
I'm really gonna miss you.

420
00:21:16,652 --> 00:21:20,364
I'm sure not half as much as you're gonna miss your husband.

421
00:21:20,531 --> 00:21:23,325
- Huh? 
- Don't freak out.

422
00:21:23,492 --> 00:21:25,536
- I'm going to botswana. 
- What?!

423
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:27,830
Sister Mary needs a companion.

424
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:30,165
What happened to sister Greta?!

425
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:33,085
I was gonna go with sister Greta,but the region is so volatile,

426
00:21:33,252 --> 00:21:36,338
I decided I'd feel much safer with a male companion.

427
00:21:36,505 --> 00:21:37,422
Carlos,you can't do this.

428
00:21:37,548 --> 00:21:40,133
You can't just goto Africa.

429
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:43,178
Honey,I'm only gonna be gone for two months.

430
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:45,806
This journey is important for me.

431
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:48,767
I want to be one of god's soldiers.

432
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:51,812
And you will be one, Carlos.

433
00:21:51,979 --> 00:21:53,188
After you see the devastation over there,

434
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:54,690
you're never the same.

435
00:21:54,815 --> 00:21:57,234
You see how selfish your old life is

436
00:21:57,401 --> 00:22:00,737
and you just want to get rid of everything that reminds you of it.

437
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:04,867
Oh, Gosh. I should get goingand start packing.

438
00:22:04,992 --> 00:22:06,118
We leave in less than a week.

439
00:22:06,243 --> 00:22:08,245
I should probably send a thankyou letter to my parole officer.

440
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,330
He's being a real mensch about this.

441
00:22:15,252 --> 00:22:19,965
I may be a catholic,but I am so not above slapping a nun.

442
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:23,135
Go ahead.

443
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,095
Do it.

444
00:22:26,138 --> 00:22:30,434
Just make sure you hit hard enough to leave a mark.

445
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:37,065
Yeah. I didn't think so.

446
00:22:40,402 --> 00:22:42,738
Kiss the kids good night and I'll see themin the morning

447
00:22:42,905 --> 00:22:47,242
Okay,yeah. I love you,too. Bye-bye.

448
00:22:49,244 --> 00:22:50,787
I'm sorry about the day care thing, Lynette,

449
00:22:50,996 --> 00:22:53,040
but Fran hardly ever lets me hold the kid.

450
00:22:53,123 --> 00:22:55,250
You know,since day one,all I ever got was,

451
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:57,211
"support the head,support the head."

452
00:22:57,336 --> 00:23:00,464
I think I know how to support a damn baby head.

453
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:06,011
Ohh,let's just--let's just do this.

454
00:23:06,136 --> 00:23:08,305
I don't want to be here all night.

455
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:13,185
you're Mindy's father.

456
00:23:13,352 --> 00:23:15,854
You have a right to spend time with her.

457
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,898
I know,but what can I do?

458
00:23:18,065 --> 00:23:19,858
You could stand up to Fran.

459
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:22,361
If you don't,you'll just become more resentful,

460
00:23:22,486 --> 00:23:24,780
she'll get nuttier.

461
00:23:24,947 --> 00:23:26,490
And without a father figure,

462
00:23:26,657 --> 00:23:29,785
poor mindy will grow up to be a stripper.

463
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,161
A stripper?

464
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,956
There's science to back that up.

465
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:39,378
You know what?

466
00:23:39,503 --> 00:23:41,755
You go ahead and push the button on this day care thing, Lynette,

467
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,007
and count Mindy in.

468
00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:46,343
Yeah,I'll handle Fran.

469
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:48,762
You're doing the right thing, Ed,

470
00:23:49,054 --> 00:23:51,139
for little Mindy.

471
00:23:58,647 --> 00:24:00,440
yeah.

472
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:06,738
dude,what if your mom walks in?

473
00:24:06,905 --> 00:24:08,115
She won't.

474
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,075
You don't know that.

475
00:24:10,617 --> 00:24:13,328
Just wait till everybody's asleep.

476
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:15,914
Seriously.

477
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:19,751
I'll make it worth your while.

478
00:24:21,336 --> 00:24:23,547
You better.

479
00:24:27,217 --> 00:24:29,428
I wish she would walk in on us,

480
00:24:29,553 --> 00:24:33,015
just to see the expression on her face.

481
00:24:34,266 --> 00:24:37,060
God,I hate her so much.

482
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:40,439
Still, though,she's your mother.

483
00:24:40,606 --> 00:24:43,692
Don't you sort of have to love her?

484
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:47,029
Last year,when she found out that I like guys,

485
00:24:47,154 --> 00:24:49,531
she freaked out.

486
00:24:49,698 --> 00:24:54,369
She said that if I didn't change, I'd be going straight to hell,

487
00:24:54,912 --> 00:24:58,081
so since I knew that I couldn't change,

488
00:24:58,207 --> 00:24:59,833
it suddenly hit me that

489
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:03,754
one day,my own mother was gonna stop loving me,

490
00:25:04,296 --> 00:25:07,799
so I decided to stop loving her first.

491
00:25:07,966 --> 00:25:10,427
That way,it wouldn't hurt so bad.

492
00:25:10,552 --> 00:25:13,180
She didn't know what she was saying.

493
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,599
Yes,she did,

494
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:18,644
so now she's gotto be punished.

495
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:21,230
How are you gonna punish her?

496
00:25:21,396 --> 00:25:23,982
One day,she'll slip up,

497
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:26,777
and I'll have something against her

498
00:25:27,277 --> 00:25:29,530
and when that happens,

499
00:25:30,197 --> 00:25:33,450
I'm gonna take her down so hard,she'll never get back up.

500
00:25:33,492 --> 00:25:36,328
It may take you a while to get something on her.

501
00:25:37,037 --> 00:25:38,622
That's Okay.

502
00:25:38,831 --> 00:25:42,334
I don't mind waiting for the things that I want.

503
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:57,724
Lynette,hey,hey.Look who's here.

504
00:25:57,891 --> 00:25:59,560
Hey!

505
00:25:59,726 --> 00:26:02,688
You know,the day care room won't be ready until next week at the earliest.

506
00:26:02,855 --> 00:26:05,065
If I had waited,I might have lost my nerve.

507
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,650
I had a window.

508
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:09,736
Fran was in the shower,so I just grabbed the baby and ran.

509
00:26:09,903 --> 00:26:12,489
You took the baby without telling Fran?

510
00:26:12,614 --> 00:26:15,367
I refuse to be bullied by that woman. You were right.

511
00:26:15,492 --> 00:26:17,870
Mindy is my daughter,I wanted to spend time with her.

512
00:26:18,036 --> 00:26:19,037
I have that right.

513
00:26:19,121 --> 00:26:23,000
Um,Ed,the lobby just called and your wife's on her way up

514
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:25,043
and she seems pretty angry.

515
00:26:25,127 --> 00:26:26,753
Oh,man.

516
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:29,923
- Here. Hold mindy.
- Oh.

517
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:31,425
Let me handle this.

518
00:26:31,592 --> 00:26:33,427
Oh,I was planning to.

519
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:40,350
I thought Mindy had been kidnapped!

520
00:26:40,434 --> 00:26:41,268
I left a sticky note.

521
00:26:41,393 --> 00:26:43,187
I wasn't looking fora sticky note,ed!

522
00:26:43,353 --> 00:26:44,938
I was looking for my missing child!

523
00:26:45,063 --> 00:26:47,149
She's my child,too,and she's staying here,

524
00:26:47,274 --> 00:26:48,901
just a few hours a day.

525
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:52,112
- You,give her to me. 
- No,I made a decision.

526
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:55,032
Yeah? Okay,watch me make a decision.

527
00:26:55,157 --> 00:26:56,408
I'm done with this marriage.

528
00:26:56,533 --> 00:26:58,827
I'm taking my baby and I'm getting on a plane to pittsburgh.

529
00:26:58,911 --> 00:27:01,371
- You wouldn't dare! 
- You think you miss mindy now,

530
00:27:01,497 --> 00:27:03,373
wait till we're livingwith my mother!

531
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,791
- I'll fight you on this.
- Yeah? Try...

532
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:10,172
as Lynette saw her dreams of day care about to board a plane to pittsburgh,

533
00:27:10,339 --> 00:27:12,883
- You're crazy,you know that?! 
- Yeah! I'm crazy to think...

534
00:27:13,008 --> 00:27:17,471
she decided this flight would have to be grounded.

535
00:27:17,596 --> 00:27:18,972
You don't scare me.

536
00:27:19,056 --> 00:27:20,474
Oh. Oh!

537
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:22,226
What the hell is she doing?!

538
00:27:22,392 --> 00:27:23,644
Open up! Give me my baby!

539
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,854
- Good thinking,lynette! 
- I am not on your side,ed

540
00:27:26,021 --> 00:27:28,524
- You're not? 
- No,I am on mindy's side.

541
00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:30,192
She is the one caught in the middle,

542
00:27:30,317 --> 00:27:33,362
and I'm not letting you two have her until you calm down.

543
00:27:33,487 --> 00:27:35,531
I want my damn child.

544
00:27:35,656 --> 00:27:38,200
Lynette,I have tom on line two.

545
00:27:38,325 --> 00:27:41,245
Pat, can you see here I'm holding a baby hostage?!

546
00:27:41,411 --> 00:27:43,497
I will call back!

547
00:27:43,664 --> 00:27:44,998
All right,that's it.

548
00:27:45,123 --> 00:27:47,376
- I'm calling the police. 
- Oh,for god's sakes!

549
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:48,836
Lynette'snot going to hurt the baby!

550
00:27:48,961 --> 00:27:51,213
No,and you're gonna get herback a whole lot faster

551
00:27:51,338 --> 00:27:54,007
if you will just listen to me,okay?

552
00:27:54,132 --> 00:27:56,844
Listen,and you?All right,good.

553
00:27:57,010 --> 00:28:01,139
So first of all, Ed,stealing the baby was really stupid.

554
00:28:01,265 --> 00:28:02,516
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

555
00:28:02,641 --> 00:28:05,853
You need to find a better way to communicate with your wife.

556
00:28:05,978 --> 00:28:09,523
And, Fran,I know what the pressure of trying to be

557
00:28:09,648 --> 00:28:11,608
a super parent does to your head.

558
00:28:11,775 --> 00:28:15,237
You can take a break and be a great mom.

559
00:28:15,362 --> 00:28:21,076
Doesn't this little sweetheart deserve a well-rested mommy?

560
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:26,790
Well,I guess the pressure does get to me a little.

561
00:28:26,915 --> 00:28:29,168
And it's Okay to admit that.

562
00:28:29,293 --> 00:28:33,964
This is communication. This is good.

563
00:28:34,131 --> 00:28:36,425
Why don't you guys go down to the lobby,

564
00:28:36,592 --> 00:28:38,760
talk it out over some coffee?

565
00:28:38,886 --> 00:28:41,263
Uh,what about Mindy?

566
00:28:41,388 --> 00:28:43,891
We've got day care!

567
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,939
We've got day care

568
00:29:11,126 --> 00:29:12,377
Hi.

569
00:29:12,503 --> 00:29:14,963
I called earlier from the spiritual outreach program?

570
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:17,341
Hi. Piano player,right?

571
00:29:17,466 --> 00:29:19,676
This is so generous of you.

572
00:29:19,843 --> 00:29:21,220
There it is.

573
00:29:21,345 --> 00:29:24,139
It's not exactly a concert grand.

574
00:29:24,264 --> 00:29:25,599
I should warn you,

575
00:29:25,766 --> 00:29:28,602
on the whole,our patients are generally unresponsive,

576
00:29:28,727 --> 00:29:31,647
so I hope you don't expect a lot of clapping.

577
00:29:32,314 --> 00:29:37,069
Miss Delaney, I find when the spiritual rewards are this great,

578
00:29:37,194 --> 00:29:39,780
who needs applause?

579
00:29:40,113 --> 00:29:41,949
Excuse me.

580
00:30:09,226 --> 00:30:12,187
Did Addison talk to you about me?

581
00:30:12,771 --> 00:30:15,315
Oh!I guess not.

582
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,025
He's a married man!

583
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:19,111
- What's wrong with you?!
- No,wait! Wait!

584
00:30:19,236 --> 00:30:23,031
- It's not what you think! 
- He hasn't touched me for three years

585
00:30:23,157 --> 00:30:25,492
because of sluts like you!

586
00:30:25,659 --> 00:30:28,495
Carol, if you would just stop throwing things at me, I'll explain!

587
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,956
How--how can you explain?!

588
00:30:31,081 --> 00:30:33,917
You're screwing my husband! No, I'm not screwing him!

589
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:36,879
He's my father!

590
00:30:40,883 --> 00:30:42,759
I'm so sorry.

591
00:30:42,885 --> 00:30:46,054
I thought you should know, but he didn't want to tell you.

592
00:30:46,763 --> 00:30:48,557
I want to die.

593
00:30:48,682 --> 00:30:50,350
- Oh,no.
- I do.

594
00:30:50,475 --> 00:30:51,643
Oh, Carol, you don't have to clean that up.

595
00:30:51,768 --> 00:30:53,979
They have clerks for that.

596
00:30:54,813 --> 00:30:56,273
How old are you?

597
00:30:56,398 --> 00:30:58,150
38.

598
00:31:00,235 --> 00:31:02,779
We've been married 39 years.

599
00:31:02,905 --> 00:31:05,782
It's been going on from the start.

600
00:31:06,283 --> 00:31:08,535
Believe me, I didn't want to hurt anyone. I just

601
00:31:08,702 --> 00:31:11,079
wanted to find my dad.

602
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:13,874
I'm glad you did,

603
00:31:13,999 --> 00:31:16,543
but you be careful,sweetheart.

604
00:31:17,544 --> 00:31:20,964
He's gonna break your heart.

605
00:31:32,351 --> 00:31:36,855
Andrew,I made an appointment with a therapist for you, me and Danielle.

606
00:31:37,064 --> 00:31:38,023
I don't think so.

607
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:41,401
This pain that you're feeling is completely natural,

608
00:31:41,527 --> 00:31:44,363
but it's not gonna go away until you deal with it.

609
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:46,198
Andrew,

610
00:31:46,406 --> 00:31:49,618
I want us to heal,I want us to be a family again.

611
00:31:49,743 --> 00:31:51,578
You know what I want?

612
00:31:51,745 --> 00:31:54,706
I want for George Williams to walk through that door

613
00:31:54,832 --> 00:31:58,919
so I can take a knife and plunge it into his heart.

614
00:31:59,044 --> 00:32:01,380
I want the pharmacist to pay for what he did to my father.

615
00:32:01,505 --> 00:32:04,800
Well,the good news is he's...he's dead.

616
00:32:04,967 --> 00:32:07,010
He committed suicide.

617
00:32:07,135 --> 00:32:08,971
His death was on his terms.

618
00:32:09,096 --> 00:32:11,431
That's not justice.

619
00:32:11,598 --> 00:32:14,184
So are you saying if he were

620
00:32:14,351 --> 00:32:18,355
executed that it would be easier for you to get past this?

621
00:32:18,522 --> 00:32:20,649
Of course.

622
00:32:30,325 --> 00:32:33,453
George...

623
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:37,749
didn't intend to commit suicide.

624
00:32:39,918 --> 00:32:43,255
He was trying to manipulate meinto taking him back,

625
00:32:44,506 --> 00:32:49,219
and he swallowed those pills hoping that I'd feel sorry for him.

626
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:53,599
He just assumed that I would call an ambulance.

627
00:32:54,141 --> 00:32:58,437
When I got there,he was already slipping away.

628
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:01,190
I tried to get him to

629
00:33:01,315 --> 00:33:04,860
accept responsibility for what he'd done...

630
00:33:07,446 --> 00:33:08,989
but he wouldn't.

631
00:33:09,823 --> 00:33:12,534
So what'd you do?

632
00:33:13,035 --> 00:33:15,996
Nothing.

633
00:33:17,748 --> 00:33:22,461
I just sat there and let him die.

634
00:33:23,253 --> 00:33:25,923
Oh,my god.

635
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:30,385
He didn't die on his terms,andrew.

636
00:33:31,053 --> 00:33:34,473
He paid for what he did to your father.

637
00:33:40,312 --> 00:33:43,440
Thank you for telling me this.

638
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,887
Hey, how you doin'?

639
00:35:36,178 --> 00:35:37,137
Yeah?

640
00:35:37,304 --> 00:35:38,847
Zach's come home.

641
00:35:38,931 --> 00:35:40,307
What?

642
00:35:40,682 --> 00:35:42,935
- Is he okay? 
- He's fine.

643
00:35:43,101 --> 00:35:44,478
Is there anything I can do?

644
00:35:44,645 --> 00:35:45,938
Thanks for asking.

645
00:35:46,063 --> 00:35:48,690
You can leave us alone.

646
00:35:49,441 --> 00:35:51,610
I spent a lot of time looking for zach,

647
00:35:51,735 --> 00:35:54,738
- and you know why. 
- Maybe I'm notmaking myself clear.

648
00:35:54,905 --> 00:35:57,032
You come near my son, I'll go to the police.

649
00:35:57,157 --> 00:35:59,743
I'll tell them what happened out in that quarry.

650
00:35:59,868 --> 00:36:01,912
You do that and we'll both go down.

651
00:36:02,037 --> 00:36:03,205
Well,

652
00:36:03,372 --> 00:36:07,292
you know I'm capable of almost anything.

653
00:36:07,709 --> 00:36:09,294
Hey,I thought you'd like to know

654
00:36:09,461 --> 00:36:11,296
zach and I are moving away.

655
00:36:11,421 --> 00:36:14,007
I want to give my son a shot at a normal life.

656
00:36:14,174 --> 00:36:16,426
I'm sure you'll agree it's for the best.

657
00:36:16,593 --> 00:36:19,346
Now see, this is where you and I don't see eye-to-eye.

658
00:36:19,555 --> 00:36:23,183
For zach's sake, I'll keep quiet, for now,

659
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:25,018
but you're not taking him away.

660
00:36:25,185 --> 00:36:27,312
If I see a "for sale" sign in front of that house,

661
00:36:27,437 --> 00:36:30,107
I'll call the police.

662
00:36:30,649 --> 00:36:34,486
I'm capable of pretty much anything myself.

663
00:36:46,498 --> 00:36:48,584
the doctor's going to give you a full work-up,

664
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,335
then we'll start the inoculations.

665
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,587
Make sure you fill out everything

666
00:36:51,712 --> 00:36:54,381
- and the nurse will take you back.
- Thank you.

667
00:36:55,507 --> 00:36:58,468
Boy,Sister Mary's done a number on you.

668
00:36:58,635 --> 00:37:01,013
- Right. 
- Yes,right.

669
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,640
She has you flying halfway across the world to help the poor

670
00:37:03,765 --> 00:37:06,268
and there'sperfectly good poor right here.

671
00:37:06,393 --> 00:37:08,687
For god's sakes, give a buck to a homeless guy.

672
00:37:08,812 --> 00:37:10,856
- It's not the same. 
- No,it's better

673
00:37:10,981 --> 00:37:12,774
because you can do it in the comfort of your own car.

674
00:37:12,941 --> 00:37:15,360
The point is not to be comfortable,gaby.

675
00:37:15,527 --> 00:37:17,988
It's about easing pain and suffering.

676
00:37:18,155 --> 00:37:20,532
Look,I'm trying to bea better person here.

677
00:37:20,657 --> 00:37:23,076
Now you can either help meor you can get out of the way,

678
00:37:23,202 --> 00:37:25,621
but you can't stop me.

679
00:37:25,787 --> 00:37:28,248
Carlos Solis?

680
00:37:28,373 --> 00:37:30,375
Come with me,please.

681
00:37:30,501 --> 00:37:32,628
Finish that for me.

682
00:37:38,717 --> 00:37:40,260
here.

683
00:37:40,385 --> 00:37:42,554
He didn't fill out the allergy section.

684
00:37:42,721 --> 00:37:45,015
Honey,he's going to a remote village in africa.

685
00:37:45,349 --> 00:37:47,518
Does it really matter that he's allergic to eggs?

686
00:37:47,643 --> 00:37:49,811
Actually,yes.Eggs are on the list.

687
00:37:49,895 --> 00:37:53,148
He could have a severe reaction to the yellow fever vaccine,

688
00:37:53,315 --> 00:37:56,610
and he won't be getting out of bed,let alone leaving the country.

689
00:37:56,777 --> 00:37:58,737
Really?

690
00:37:59,404 --> 00:38:00,614
Oh,don't write that down.

691
00:38:00,739 --> 00:38:03,200
I wasn't being specific.

692
00:38:03,367 --> 00:38:05,536
He's allergic to fish eggs.

693
00:38:05,661 --> 00:38:07,079
Fish eggs?

694
00:38:07,246 --> 00:38:09,623
Poor baby's gone his whole life without caviar.

695
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:11,583
Now that's suffering.

696
00:38:13,669 --> 00:38:16,964
All right, doc,give me all you got.

697
00:38:21,927 --> 00:38:23,929
It's so hot in this village.

698
00:38:24,096 --> 00:38:26,682
Baby,that's the fever talking.

699
00:38:26,807 --> 00:38:28,892
The doctor said you're having an allergic reaction,

700
00:38:29,017 --> 00:38:31,478
but you're gonna be fine,okay?

701
00:38:31,603 --> 00:38:33,564
Hold me.

702
00:38:33,689 --> 00:38:38,610
Ohh,honey. I'm so sorry.

703
00:38:39,653 --> 00:38:43,115
Ohh,maybe that stupid nun is right.

704
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,952
Maybe I am trying to stop you from becoming a better person.

705
00:38:47,077 --> 00:38:50,581
It's just that I love you the way you are--

706
00:38:51,373 --> 00:38:55,043
greedy, selfish and insensitive.

707
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:57,421
I'm just scared if you're not those things anymore,

708
00:38:57,588 --> 00:38:59,381
you're gonna wake up one day

709
00:38:59,506 --> 00:39:02,092
and realize I still am,

710
00:39:03,552 --> 00:39:05,554
and then you won't want me.

711
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:08,473
I want you. Just hold me.

712
00:39:11,018 --> 00:39:13,437
Ohh,Carlos.

713
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:17,691
Hold me...

714
00:39:19,693 --> 00:39:22,571
Sister Mary.

715
00:39:28,911 --> 00:39:30,746
Painting in the rain?

716
00:39:30,954 --> 00:39:32,080
Is that smart?

717
00:39:32,206 --> 00:39:33,749
Well,let me see,painting in the rain

718
00:39:33,916 --> 00:39:35,834
or letting the whole world think I'm a whore?

719
00:39:36,001 --> 00:39:38,170
I don't know.What do you think?

720
00:39:38,545 --> 00:39:40,547
Heard you ran into my wife.

721
00:39:40,672 --> 00:39:42,090
Yep.

722
00:39:42,257 --> 00:39:43,675
So?

723
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:49,056
So you are hereby released of any further obligation to be my dad.

724
00:39:49,723 --> 00:39:50,933
Okay.

725
00:39:51,058 --> 00:39:52,935
Just so you know,

726
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:56,772
I'm not actually proud of what I've done

727
00:39:56,897 --> 00:39:58,690
you know, my hobbies.

728
00:39:58,815 --> 00:40:00,859
Good for you.

729
00:40:01,026 --> 00:40:03,237
Bye.

730
00:40:03,612 --> 00:40:05,572
I have done things I'm proud of.

731
00:40:05,781 --> 00:40:09,243
I could give you five examples right now.

732
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:12,037
Okay,maybe three.

733
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:15,749
You don't have to do this.

734
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:18,293
I was a volunteer fireman.

735
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:23,006
I put out fires,I got kittens out of trees,the whole nine yards.

736
00:40:23,173 --> 00:40:25,467
Sweet.

737
00:40:25,801 --> 00:40:29,972
About 20 years ago,I started a foundation to

738
00:40:30,138 --> 00:40:32,891
protect wild horses. I probably saved hundreds of them.

739
00:40:33,058 --> 00:40:35,060
Really?

740
00:40:35,185 --> 00:40:38,188
I'm full of surprises.

741
00:40:39,398 --> 00:40:43,235
Okay,one more.

742
00:40:44,069 --> 00:40:48,824
I wasn't exactly thrilled when you walked back into my life.

743
00:40:48,991 --> 00:40:50,742
Now that I've met you,

744
00:40:51,994 --> 00:40:56,206
well,you gave me a third thing to be proud of.

745
00:40:56,874 --> 00:40:58,500
That was a good one.

746
00:40:59,334 --> 00:41:02,379
That's why I saved it for last.

747
00:41:05,257 --> 00:41:07,843
I have to spend some time working on my marriage.

748
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:09,553
When that's all sorted out,

749
00:41:09,678 --> 00:41:12,639
maybe we could continue with the

750
00:41:12,806 --> 00:41:14,975
catching up?

751
00:41:17,769 --> 00:41:20,939
I'll wait for your call.

752
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:34,411
The stories are as old as time itself...

753
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:37,414
the prodigal son who returns home

754
00:41:37,539 --> 00:41:41,752
to the father who forgives him...

755
00:41:42,461 --> 00:41:48,842
the jealous wife who tricks the husband who trust her...

756
00:41:50,511 --> 00:41:52,137
the desperate mother

757
00:41:52,262 --> 00:41:57,267
who risks everything for the child who needs her

758
00:41:58,268 --> 00:42:00,270
and the faithless husband

759
00:42:00,395 --> 00:42:04,983
who hurts the wife who loves him so deeply.

760
00:42:06,318 --> 00:42:09,780
Why do we listen again and again?

761
00:42:09,947 --> 00:42:13,116
Because these are the stories of family,

762
00:42:13,242 --> 00:42:18,997
and once we look past the fighting, pain and the resentment,

763
00:42:19,373 --> 00:42:23,710
we occasionally like to remind ourselves...

764
00:42:24,169 --> 00:42:30,217
There is absolutely nothing more important.

765
00:42:30,384 --> 00:42:32,219
Hi, bunny, bunny. Hi.
