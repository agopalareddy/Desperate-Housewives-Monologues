<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>

2
00:00:03,588 --> 00:00:06,840
Well, if Libby here likes
us as much as we like her,

3
00:00:06,882 --> 00:00:10,177
we should just go ahead and move to
adopt her baby girl. Who's the Father?

4
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:11,220
Honestly, I don't know.

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,222
Carlos and Gaby made a deal...

6
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:15,557
I did remarry my ex, but it was only because

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,976
he has great health insurance.
Susan made amends...

8
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,479
you know, I never thought
I'd have such a good time

9
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:22,564
hanging out with my girlfriend
and her husband.

10
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:24,858
And Mike... didn't she mention we dated?

11
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,444
Made a confession... liar! You've
just been leading me on!

12
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:29,738
You're obviously still in love with this guy!

13
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:31,240
Of his own.

14
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:35,327
On her first day of sobriety,

15
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:37,412
Bree van de Kamp found an old cork,

16
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:42,584
which reminded her just how
much she craved Chablis.

17
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:46,046
So she called her sponsor,
who came over with a DVD

18
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:50,676
which they watched till
her craving had passed.

19
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:54,429
Five days later, after she
developed a thirst for Merlot,

20
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:57,140
Peter arrived with a deck of cards.

21
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,643
The next week, he brought
over chinese takeout

22
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:01,645
because Bree had told him

23
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:06,024
she was consumed by thoughts
of vintage Chardonnay.

24
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:10,237
By her 20th day of sobriety,
Bree had stopped thinking

25
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:16,660
because her thoughts re
now centered elsewhere.

26
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:18,579
Hmm...

27
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,206
yeah, huh.

28
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:22,708
I'm curious, Peter.

29
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,960
What is the easiest way
to overcome addiction?

30
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:27,754
Oh, some folks try shock therapy.

31
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,756
Other use, uh, hypnosis.

32
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,758
But taking it one day at a time

33
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,760
still makes the most sense to me.

34
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:34,761
Why?

35
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,263
I don't know.

36
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:39,141
I guess I'm just impatient
to get on with my life.

37
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:44,188
What are you doing?

38
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:47,149
I was just giving you a little kiss.

39
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:48,817
Why?

40
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:51,320
Well, it's just my way of saying thank you

41
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:55,115
for everything you've done for
me over the past few weeks.

42
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:57,743
What's... wrong?

43
00:01:57,743 --> 00:02:00,746
This is gonna seem like it's
coming out of left field,

44
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:03,248
but in addition to being
a recovering alcoholic,

45
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,501
I'm also a member of S. A.

46
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:08,962
Sex addicts anonymous.

47
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:15,636
Oh. And that's A... a real thing?

48
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,847
Yes. Sex is as much an
addiction for me as booze.

49
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:21,350
That's why when you turn me on like that,

50
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:25,062
it's a bit of a problem. It
was just a peck on the cheek.

51
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,563
It doesn't matter.

52
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:28,690
The slightest touch gets my juices flowing.

53
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:32,361
So... how long has it been since you...

54
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,738
a year.

55
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,157
They have this rule... plant, pet, person.

56
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,451
If I can keep a plant alive, you know,

57
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,453
then I can move on to a pet.

58
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:44,414
And if I can make that work,
then I can start dating again.

59
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,708
(chuckles) so how are you doing?

60
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,544
I'm on my fourth ficus.

61
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,212
Oh.

62
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:00,556
(chuckles) see?

63
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,558
I think you can handle affection

64
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,601
better than you give yourself credit for.

65
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:11,733
Oh! Oh!

66
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,282
Oh!

67
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:20,242
Oh, oh!

68
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:21,326
I'm sorry.

69
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,328
Um... I think I should go.

70
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,663
Really? Yeah.

71
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:28,417
Peter! But... but... you forgot your shirt!

72
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,210
Keep it.

73
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:33,964
Though she didn't know it,

74
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:36,508
Bree had answered her own question.

75
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:40,971
The easiest way to overcome one addiction...

76
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:45,142
is to replace it with another.

77
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,317
Temptation...

78
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,694
it's the name of a well-known establishment

79
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,946
on the outskirts of fairview.

80
00:03:57,988 --> 00:04:01,366
Its clientele is devoted.

81
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,827
Everyone who goes there

82
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:06,914
wants to get their hands on something.

83
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:09,583
And when they cross a line...

84
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,335
hey! I warned you, pal.

85
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:14,087
They are punished...

86
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:17,090
as a certain married couple
were about to discover.

87
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:19,593
Hi.

88
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:21,094
You want a lap dance?

89
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:24,473
Uh...

90
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:26,642
no, thanks. No.

91
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,481
I sure hope Libby likes this camera.

92
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:35,150
Well, why wouldn't she? It's
exactly what she asked for,

93
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:37,152
the most expensive one in the store.

94
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,154
You know, I'm telling you, Carlos.

95
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,156
I'm getting really tired of kissing her ass.

96
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:43,158
The woman is giving us her baby.

97
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,327
We'll kiss whatever needs kissing.

98
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:47,621
What the hell are you guys doing here?

99
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:49,623
Uh, we brought you this gift,

100
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:53,252
and you said that you didn't
want us coming by your house...

101
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,295
thanks, but I'm working, so you gotta go.

102
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:57,297
Look, we spent a lot of money on that.

103
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,299
The least you can do is open it

104
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:01,844
so we can bask in your happy expression.

105
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,345
Is there a problem here?

106
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:05,639
No, we're just talking.
It's... everything's fine.

107
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:07,808
Carlos Solis. This is my wife, Gabrielle.

108
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,309
We're friends of Libby's.

109
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:12,646
Oh, hey, I'm Frank, Libby's boyfriend.

110
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:16,525
Libby, you didn't tell
us you had a boyfriend.

111
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:18,610
Didn't I? I thought I had.

112
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:21,321
What's that, a present for our baby?

113
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:26,076
I'm sorry, did you just say "our" baby?

114
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:30,038
Yeah. It's our first.

115
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,834
Hey!

116
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:35,335
What's for lunch?

117
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:37,421
Omelettes. You want me to make you one?

118
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,381
No, thank you. I'll just pick at yours.

119
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:41,842
I didn't know you still had a key, Dad.

120
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,343
Of course I do.

121
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,220
I have to watch out for
my two favorite ladies.

122
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:47,890
Try the cheese. That's the best part. Mmm.

123
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:50,809
You mean, two of your three favorite ladies.

124
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:53,562
You know, when you add in Edie.

125
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:55,480
Right! Of course.

126
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,734
And speaking of Edie, I have some big news.

127
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,528
I finally did it. I popped the question.

128
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,405
Oh! Congratulations, Dad!

129
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:05,157
Yeah... congratulations.

130
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,452
Um, what happened to waiting six months?

131
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:11,079
(chuckling) Edie and I aren't
getting married tomorrow.

132
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:14,958
It takes months to plan
a classy wedding, you know?

133
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,295
Remember ours, hmm? You had
to have it outdoors, huh?

134
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:20,714
Ugh. It poured.

135
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:22,424
I could have murdered that weatherman.

136
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:25,719
We were all crammed under
this little gazebo thing

137
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,721
it was hysterical.

138
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:29,973
I thought the whole wedding day was ruined.

139
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,975
I loved it! It felt spontaneous.

140
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:36,647
All our friends gathered
close around us, hmm?

141
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:39,274
Remember?

142
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:42,903
You said it was the happiest
day of your life.

143
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,159
Just like you marrying Edie

144
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:51,620
will be the happiest day of her life.

145
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:53,747
Yeah. Right.

146
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:56,208
Her, too.

147
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,043
Toodles.

148
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:04,341
Oh, hi.

149
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:05,592
Hello.

150
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:08,762
Andrew said it was all right
for me to get a cream soda.

151
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:11,098
Uh, sure. Help yourself.

152
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,308
There's also frosted glasses in the freezer.

153
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,477
Can is fine, but thank you.

154
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:18,146
Oh, and, uh, I left a list for you

155
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:20,858
of the witnesses we'll be deposing.

156
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:22,985
It's, uh, there on the counter.

157
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,622
Hi.

158
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:36,832
Hey.

159
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:42,171
I know that you're still
angry with me, and, um...

160
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:47,718
I wanted to tell you that I have, um...

161
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,554
joined a recovery program.

162
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:52,848
A. A.

163
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:55,934
I just wanted you to know that...

164
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,604
and to tell you I'm sorry.

165
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,606
You are...

166
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:03,066
a real friend, and I value your honesty.

167
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:07,696
Oh, I don't wanna be mad anymore.

168
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:09,698
And I'm so happy to hear all that,

169
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,367
and I am so proud of you. Oh, thanks,

170
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,369
but I'm not really out of the woods yet.

171
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:17,247
I still have this whole court
case hanging over my head.

172
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:18,749
I heard about that.

173
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:21,043
Andrew's asking to be emancipated?

174
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,045
Yes, and his lawyer is taking depositions now

175
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:25,422
to see if I am a fit parent.

176
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:26,965
Oy.

177
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,468
And considering that mishap
that I had with your kids,

178
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,095
I, uh, I imagine he'll
be anxious to talk to you.

179
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:34,139
Well, it makes sense, I guess.

180
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:35,516
Yeah.

181
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:38,060
Do you have any idea what you might say?

182
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:42,314
I, um...

183
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:49,112
I'll focus on your good qualities.

184
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:54,034
I could not ask for anything more.

185
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:55,702
Thanks.

186
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:58,413
See you around, I hope. All right.

187
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:02,167
That's... not why you
came to apologize, is it?

188
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:03,669
What do you mean?

189
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,964
To soften me up for the deposition.

190
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:09,383
Of course not.

191
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:15,514
Um...

192
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:19,101
I just want you to understand something.

193
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,770
Andrew is making accusations...

194
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:24,565
false accusations, saying that I abused him,

195
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:27,651
all because I wouldn't let
him have his trust fund early

196
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:29,653
so he could buy a car.

197
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:32,698
I mean, can you blame me for wanting to know

198
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,284
if I have your support?

199
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:37,077
And...

200
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:39,371
so... what,

201
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:42,291
you want me to lie? Make you look good?

202
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:48,255
I actually don't want anything of the sort.

203
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:51,133
Good.

204
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:53,135
Because when I give my deposition,

205
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:55,137
I'm going to tell the truth.

206
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:11,028
To what do I owe this pleasure?

207
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,071
I want you to look at something.

208
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:21,371
Myra Holt is talking to Paul Young,

209
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:24,458
chatting away with him as though
he were any other neighbor.

210
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,460
Now I told her he killed my Sister.

211
00:10:26,502 --> 00:10:28,795
I mentioned it to her six
months ago when we were

212
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:30,797
standing in the express line at the market.

213
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,799
But still, there she is, yakking away.

214
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:34,968
Oh, Mike.

215
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,971
I'm afraid people's memories
aren't what they used to be.

216
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:40,891
What do you want, Felicia?

217
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:43,268
I wanna see how good your memory is,

218
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,271
if you recall a certain
promise you made to me.

219
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:49,733
- I am not gonna kill him.
- Why not?
- Give me one good reason.

220
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:52,110
Because things have changed.

221
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,112
How? My Sister still lies
rotting in the ground.

222
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:57,199
So does Dierdre. No, I don't
see how anything's changed at all.

223
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:59,284
You're just gonna have to let this go.

224
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:02,746
Sounds to me as though someone's
let go of his rage.

225
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:05,707
Maybe I have.

226
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:08,293
Well, I haven't.

227
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:14,675
And that bitch of a stripper lied to us.

228
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:17,135
The Father's totally in the dark.

229
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:20,138
- He clearly wants to keep the baby.
- Mr. Solis, if the Father wants

230
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,641
to assert his rights here,
there's nothing we can do.

231
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:24,601
I'll find you another baby. I promise.

232
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:27,604
- I don't want another baby. I want this one!
- Oh, honey, he's right, okay.

233
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:30,232
That trashy girl has been
lying to us from the get-go.

234
00:11:30,274 --> 00:11:32,901
Let's just walk away while
we can. It's not worth it.

235
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:35,696
Look, don't get cold feet
now, Gaby, please. All right?

236
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:37,698
Let's just pay Frank the way we paid Libby

237
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:40,576
and then bring the baby home.
- Wait, wait, wait...

238
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:42,119
you paid Libby?

239
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,121
You said we could give her gifts.

240
00:11:44,163 --> 00:11:46,206
Everybody loves getting cash.

241
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:50,627
I could probably be disbarred
for even listening to this.

242
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:52,171
I cannot condone baby-buying!

243
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:55,174
And I sure as hell can't be part of it.

244
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,592
Oh, Mr. Beale, come on.

245
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,343
No, no, hear me out.

246
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:01,138
If you are determined to
go down this dark road,

247
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,599
and unbeknownst to me steal this...

248
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,893
paternal rights waiver
that's sitting on my desk,

249
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:08,937
and have this Frank guy sign
both sides and date the top,

250
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:12,357
I can't be part of that, either.

251
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:15,944
Hmm.

252
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:21,533
Okay, l-I'm gonna go to Dad's.

253
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:23,744
Oh, wait! Why don't you let me walk with you?

254
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:25,412
Uh, shouldn't you be resting?

255
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:26,914
No! I'm fine.

256
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:29,416
The Doctor said I should actually
keep my blood flowing.

257
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:32,419
Well, do you have to do it
while we walk over to Edie's?

258
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:36,256
I just... I don't wanna
risk you running into Dad.

259
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:37,758
Okay...

260
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,760
you guys have just been so chummy lately,

261
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:42,971
and... this whole flirting thing
is kind of freaking me out.

262
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:45,682
Wait a second, we're... we're not flirting.

263
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:48,185
Mom, you fed him eggs with your fork.

264
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:50,562
Okay, yes,

265
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:53,690
I am closer to your Father
than I have been in the past.

266
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:57,736
The bitter hatred's now settled
into a respectful disgust.

267
00:12:57,778 --> 00:12:59,238
That's the kind of thing

268
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,281
most children of divorce dream about.

269
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,205
Hey, Edie. What's all this stuff for?

270
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:10,958
Oh, hi! Don't tell anyone,

271
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:13,001
but I'm planning a huge surprise for Karl.

272
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:14,336
A surprise?

273
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:16,338
Yeah, I'm putting together
an engagement party

274
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,548
tomorrow afternoon.

275
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:18,841
Oh, cool.

276
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:21,301
But that's not the surprise.

277
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:24,137
Actually, it's gonna be a surprise wedding.

278
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:28,058
I know!

279
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,936
My Pilates teacher got ordained
over the internet.

280
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:33,772
The, uh, church of the
divine something or other.

281
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:36,233
I'm not sure. Anyway, it's all legal.

282
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:38,235
And, well, just one more day

283
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:41,655
before I make an honest
man out of your Daddy.

284
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:47,870
Oh! You're so sweet.

285
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:51,999
Thank you so much for your good wishes.

286
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,419
Oh. No, Edie, wait. Um, no, it's just that...

287
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,753
you know, I was married to Karl,

288
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:59,506
and I used to... try to surprise him,

289
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:03,594
and he would always, always, always say...

290
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:07,556
"no, usan. Don't surprise
me. I don't like it."

291
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:10,893
Whatever. I'm doing it,
so keep your trap shut.

292
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:13,145
Now if you'll excuse me,

293
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:16,273
I've gotta go and buy a wedding dress.

294
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:18,275
Oh, and by the way, I'll be wearing white,

295
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:21,904
so that'll be a surprise
for everybody. (laughs)

296
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:29,786
I don't know why I have
to get dragged into this.

297
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:31,288
What happened with my kids

298
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:33,957
has nothing to do with Bree's
situation with Andrew.

299
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:35,209
Sit.

300
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,169
Well, it's my understanding

301
00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:39,171
that real harm could have
come to your children

302
00:14:39,171 --> 00:14:41,882
as a direct result of your friend's behavior.

303
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:44,134
I'm sorry, Mr. Bormanis,
but I'm not gonna testify.

304
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:46,136
It just doesn't feel right to me.

305
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:50,682
Well, this isn't the first time
someone's felt the way you do.

306
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:54,478
So this isn't the first
time I've had to say that

307
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,648
if you refuse to give a deposition
of your own accord,

308
00:14:57,689 --> 00:14:59,316
I'll compel you to give one.

309
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:04,905
But I'm sure I won't have to.

310
00:15:14,206 --> 00:15:16,166
You're saying Bree did this?

311
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,835
While under the influence.

312
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:23,173
I understand your reluctance
to turn on a friend,

313
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:25,717
but this isn't about you.

314
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,719
It's about Andrew.

315
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:30,305
Don't you think he's suffered enough?

316
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:39,773
How much are you gonna give him?

317
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:41,775
I figured we could start with forty.

318
00:15:41,817 --> 00:15:43,235
Thousand?

319
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:46,613
He's a bouncer in a strip
club. Offer him eight.

320
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:49,283
He's not going to sell his baby for $8, 000.

321
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:51,451
Are we talking about the same idiot?

322
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:53,579
I think for $8, 000, you throw in a kidney.

323
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,372
I'm not gonna blow this by bargain hunting.

324
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:57,374
You know, that's your problem, Carlos.

325
00:15:57,374 --> 00:16:00,085
Remember when you bought
your car? You paid sticker.

326
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:02,921
Nobody pays sticker! Okay, and what's
the sticker price on a child, huh?

327
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:05,424
Tell me that. I'm thinking $12, 000.

328
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:09,845
Frank, you have to sign the paper.

329
00:16:09,887 --> 00:16:12,472
I made a deal with these people. A deal?

330
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:15,809
This isn't a used car we're
talking about. It's our baby.

331
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,311
Before you screw this up,

332
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:19,897
just remember that I can
go to the cops and tell them

333
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:22,774
about the pot farm you have
going on in our basement.

334
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:25,944
It's just a couple plants.

335
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:28,906
Yeah, I don't do it for profits.

336
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:30,449
Hobby, mostly.

337
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,410
Oh, come on, Frank. You know
you would be a lousy Father.

338
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:36,413
It's my kid! And I have a right
to mess her up if I want.

339
00:16:36,455 --> 00:16:39,500
And if you go near the
police, I'll tell 'em how

340
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:42,669
you've been stealing all
those tips from Sheila.

341
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,171
(gaby) okay, we're done.

342
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:47,216
Gaby, Gaby, no, just... hold on.

343
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:50,594
Now maybe there's a way that
we can work this out together.

344
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:52,596
There is nothing to work out.

345
00:16:52,638 --> 00:16:55,140
If Frank is not on board
with this, it's over.

346
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:58,101
Wait! Uh... it doesn't matter what he wants.

347
00:16:58,143 --> 00:17:00,020
Why not?

348
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:01,897
Because it's not your baby.

349
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:05,192
That's a lie.

350
00:17:05,234 --> 00:17:08,570
What if I took a paternity
test? Will that shut you up?

351
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:10,864
Wait, if it's not Frank's, then whose is it?

352
00:17:10,906 --> 00:17:13,575
I'm not sure.

353
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:15,077
All's I know is,

354
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:18,038
I got pregnant right after
I worked at the Calgary rodeo,

355
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,542
and I was very popular there.

356
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:24,211
So what are you saying, you
screwed a bunch of cowboys?

357
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:27,631
You have your hobbies...

358
00:17:27,673 --> 00:17:29,466
and I have mine.

359
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:35,305
You think this is funny?

360
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:37,683
Oh, don't you get it?

361
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:40,185
We just got our baby back.

362
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:47,359
Um...

363
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:52,823
well, you take care now.

364
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,827
Ahem. Yeah.

365
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:00,873
Hi.

366
00:18:00,873 --> 00:18:02,875
I got, uh, your message

367
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,669
that you wanted to see me
before the meeting started.

368
00:18:05,711 --> 00:18:09,506
Yeah, I did. Um, there's someone
I'd like to introduce you to.

369
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:14,011
Bree, this is Donna.

370
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:16,972
Donna, this is Bree. What's up?

371
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:18,056
Hi.

372
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:20,601
Donna is gonna be your new sponsor.

373
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:23,353
I, um, I don't want a new sponsor.

374
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:26,398
I'm... I'm very comfortable working with you.

375
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:32,237
Look, this was always just
a temporary arrangement.

376
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:34,239
And given what happened the other night,

377
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:36,909
I think it's best if we just end this now.

378
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,077
Peter, all we did was kiss.

379
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:46,960
We'd be kidding ourselves
if we didn't think that

380
00:18:47,002 --> 00:18:50,214
whatever's between us isn't
going to affect our recovery.

381
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:53,425
It's not a good time for
change in my life, Peter.

382
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:56,970
Terrible things are happening.
I'm headed to court.

383
00:18:57,012 --> 00:18:59,389
I need your support now more than ever.

384
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:01,350
You'll have support, Bree.

385
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:03,393
It just won't be mine.

386
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:04,770
But, Peter...

387
00:19:08,524 --> 00:19:10,943
oh, Bree could never have done that!

388
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:12,986
I'm just telling you what the lawyer said.

389
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:15,239
So you think Bree punched Andrew in the face?

390
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:16,740
'Cause I don't.

391
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:20,077
I don't either, but on the other hand,

392
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:23,080
she spanked my kids, she
lied about her drinking

393
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:26,500
and I once saw her bitch
slap her mother-in-law.

394
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:28,210
So I'm torn.

395
00:19:28,252 --> 00:19:30,546
Well, I'm siding with Bree.

396
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:33,715
How can you be so sure?

397
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:37,344
We have Andrew saying that it's
systematic physical abuse.

398
00:19:37,386 --> 00:19:39,346
And then we have Bree saying

399
00:19:39,388 --> 00:19:41,348
it's Andrew wanting to be emancipated

400
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:44,351
so he can get at his trust
fund so he can buy a car.

401
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:46,603
How are we supposed to know the real truth?

402
00:19:46,645 --> 00:19:48,772
Because I remember being 17.

403
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:51,608
And I would've done a hell of a lot more

404
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:54,486
than punch myself in the eye to get a car.

405
00:19:58,949 --> 00:20:00,742
Karl!

406
00:20:00,784 --> 00:20:02,744
Karl, stop! Stop!

407
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:04,830
Oh! It's an emergency.

408
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:06,832
Just calm down. What's going on?

409
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:09,877
- Edie is gonna marry you tomorrow.
- What?

410
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:11,879
She's planned this whole secret wedding.

411
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,297
It's a surprise.

412
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:15,841
God, I hate surprises!

413
00:20:15,883 --> 00:20:17,342
I know. I told her that.

414
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:20,053
I said: "he always, always hates surprises."

415
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,639
All right, don't get yourself
all worked up here.

416
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:26,059
Put our heads together. We'll
come up with something.

417
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:28,395
So the thing you gotta know about me

418
00:20:28,437 --> 00:20:30,189
is my style is proactive.

419
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,816
I don't hold your hand if you go on a bender.

420
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:34,985
I believe in behavior modification.

421
00:20:35,027 --> 00:20:37,362
Hmm. Some muffins?

422
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:40,365
Oh. Oh, that's okay. I-i'm not big on snacks.

423
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:42,534
You should also know...

424
00:20:42,576 --> 00:20:44,077
I'm not a lesbian.

425
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:47,664
Oh!

426
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:49,208
Well, good for you.

427
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:53,378
Well, see, if I was, the program
wouldn't let me be your sponsor.

428
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,880
Not great for your recovery

429
00:20:54,922 --> 00:20:57,424
if we get tangled up in a little somethin'.

430
00:20:57,466 --> 00:21:00,928
So, um, whatever vibe you might be getting,

431
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:02,471
that's all on you.

432
00:21:04,473 --> 00:21:06,433
Um, Donna...

433
00:21:08,644 --> 00:21:12,481
l-I really appreciate everything
that you've been doing for me,

434
00:21:12,523 --> 00:21:14,942
but I think I was really making some progress

435
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:16,944
with Peter as my sponsor.

436
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:18,278
And I was thinking...

437
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,988
all right, stop right there!

438
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,615
You're fixating on Peter.

439
00:21:21,657 --> 00:21:24,201
Well, I just really feel like
I'm jeopardizing my recovery

440
00:21:24,243 --> 00:21:26,620
by switching... you're making cuses.

441
00:21:26,662 --> 00:21:30,916
See, I have a 99% success rate as a sponsor

442
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:33,377
because I have 0% tolerance

443
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:35,587
for people who lie to themselves.

444
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:37,089
Now come on.

445
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,383
Come on? Where are we going?

446
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:42,678
Hiking. There's nothing like
it to take your mind off booze.

447
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:46,849
I got it!

448
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:49,393
I'll just be the woman. I'll
say I want a big wedding.

449
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:51,395
You know, the church, the big ballroom,

450
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:53,939
smushing cake in her face...
it'll take months to plan.

451
00:21:53,981 --> 00:21:56,567
That's great. And of course,
I'll have to tell her

452
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,569
you're the one who ruined the surprise.

453
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,904
You're gonna make me take the hit?

454
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:02,072
Yeah.

455
00:22:04,074 --> 00:22:06,952
Hey, guys. What you doing out here?

456
00:22:06,994 --> 00:22:09,037
Uh, just talking.

457
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:11,665
Oh, well, come on in. I've
got something to show you.

458
00:22:11,707 --> 00:22:13,750
Oh, no, that's okay.

459
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:15,586
Come on! You'll love this.

460
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:23,719
Wait until I leave to tell her,
'cause she's gonna kill me.

461
00:22:28,557 --> 00:22:31,059
Well, I should go.

462
00:22:32,561 --> 00:22:34,438
I'm not gonna scream or cry

463
00:22:34,438 --> 00:22:36,440
or pound your faces in with a mallet,

464
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,151
which, Lord knows, is my right.

465
00:22:39,193 --> 00:22:41,153
But what I will say is that you two

466
00:22:41,195 --> 00:22:44,072
are the most reprehensible
excuses for human beings

467
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:46,950
that I have ever met!

468
00:22:46,992 --> 00:22:49,786
Do you have anything to add?

469
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:58,212
Right. What the hell.

470
00:23:01,048 --> 00:23:02,883
Oh! Get out! Get...

471
00:23:24,613 --> 00:23:26,365
hey, Mrs. Scavo.

472
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:29,117
That's A... that's a sweet ride.

473
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:32,287
Yeah, you think so?

474
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:34,289
Why don't you come over here for a second?

475
00:23:34,331 --> 00:23:36,542
I'd like to pick your brain.

476
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:42,214
You're the demographic that
my client is interested in,

477
00:23:42,256 --> 00:23:44,216
so you'd actually be doing me a favor

478
00:23:44,258 --> 00:23:46,218
if you drove it around for a couple hours,

479
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:49,471
and tell me what you thought. Do you mind?

480
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:51,974
Are you kidding me?

481
00:23:51,974 --> 00:23:55,060
I can't believe you are old enough to drive.

482
00:23:55,102 --> 00:23:57,187
I still remember when you were 10 years old.

483
00:23:57,229 --> 00:23:59,439
I paid you a dollar to rake our leaves.

484
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:00,649
Yeah.

485
00:24:00,691 --> 00:24:02,442
Yeah, you were pretty cheap.

486
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,573
Is this set up for MP3?

487
00:24:07,573 --> 00:24:09,908
Uh, all the bells and whistles,

488
00:24:09,908 --> 00:24:11,660
but listen...

489
00:24:11,702 --> 00:24:14,496
I really wanted to tell you how sorry I am.

490
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:16,373
Hmm?

491
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:20,669
Your lawyer came to see me.

492
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:23,839
I'm going to be deposed.

493
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:27,092
It's going to be hard for me...

494
00:24:27,134 --> 00:24:30,679
yeah. Yeah, I know.

495
00:24:30,721 --> 00:24:33,265
You just have to remember

496
00:24:33,307 --> 00:24:36,018
she's a different person when she drinks.

497
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:37,936
She must be.

498
00:24:37,978 --> 00:24:40,480
It's hard for me to imagine the Bree I know

499
00:24:40,522 --> 00:24:42,357
capable of hurting you.

500
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:44,860
Yeah.

501
00:24:44,902 --> 00:24:46,361
Do you have the keys?

502
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:48,739
Oh. Sure.

503
00:24:48,739 --> 00:24:50,699
Anyway, I just...

504
00:24:50,741 --> 00:24:54,286
I feel so guilty that this
all went on in your house,

505
00:24:54,328 --> 00:24:56,705
right under our nose.

506
00:24:56,705 --> 00:25:00,250
So if there is anything
I can do to help you...

507
00:25:00,292 --> 00:25:02,711
well, can you get a discount on these?

508
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:07,257
Um...

509
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:10,219
actually, yeah. One of the perks.

510
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,429
Even so, it's a little out of the price range

511
00:25:12,471 --> 00:25:14,431
of a high school student.

512
00:25:14,473 --> 00:25:16,433
Well, if you tell my lawyer the truth,

513
00:25:16,475 --> 00:25:20,020
I don't think money's gonna be a problem.

514
00:25:24,274 --> 00:25:26,235
Hi. What's going on?

515
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:34,785
Edie wants to discuss
our little... deception.

516
00:25:34,827 --> 00:25:38,413
Exactly how ugly is this gonna get?

517
00:25:38,455 --> 00:25:42,751
(edie) how long does it take to shut a door?

518
00:25:42,793 --> 00:25:44,795
I can forgive your trickery.

519
00:25:44,837 --> 00:25:48,131
I can forgive the humiliation.

520
00:25:48,173 --> 00:25:49,633
But what I can't forgive

521
00:25:49,675 --> 00:25:52,302
is the complete and utter
lack of faith in me!

522
00:25:52,344 --> 00:25:56,139
I mean, having Susan get married
for insurance was my idea!

523
00:25:56,181 --> 00:25:58,141
Okay, so if I'd known that everything

524
00:25:58,183 --> 00:26:01,103
had gotten all screwed up,
of course I would've agreed.

525
00:26:01,144 --> 00:26:03,272
Look, Edie, in retrospect...

526
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:05,482
yes, we didn't think.

527
00:26:05,524 --> 00:26:09,736
We didn't handle this the way
mature adults should have.

528
00:26:09,778 --> 00:26:12,739
He's right. We behaved like children...

529
00:26:12,781 --> 00:26:15,409
naughty, stupid children.

530
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:19,538
Well, that makes me feel better
that you could admit that.

531
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:24,835
Because... when naughty children misbehave,

532
00:26:24,877 --> 00:26:27,421
they know that they're gonna
get punished. Don't they?

533
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:31,508
Punished?

534
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,302
Mm-hmm. At this point,

535
00:26:33,302 --> 00:26:36,889
I'd like to point out that,
uh, it was Karl who proposed.

536
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,640
Karl.

537
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,352
You are gonna throw me an elaborate wedding.

538
00:26:42,394 --> 00:26:45,147
Yes, of course.

539
00:26:45,189 --> 00:26:48,025
Anything, baby.

540
00:26:48,066 --> 00:26:50,569
How elaborate?

541
00:26:50,569 --> 00:26:54,156
Well, figure out exactly what
it is that you could afford,

542
00:26:54,198 --> 00:26:55,699
and triple it.

543
00:26:57,284 --> 00:27:00,913
As for you... okay, now remember, I'm broke.

544
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:03,248
I'm well aware of your church mouse status.

545
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:07,127
I don't intend to lift a finger

546
00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:09,296
during the planning and execution

547
00:27:09,338 --> 00:27:13,342
of this crushingly expensive wedding.

548
00:27:13,383 --> 00:27:15,344
No. No, of course not.

549
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:17,930
And anything I can do to help...

550
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:20,474
uh, you know, I would... I could help with

551
00:27:20,474 --> 00:27:21,600
how's that?

552
00:27:21,642 --> 00:27:25,354
Well, I wasn't planning on inviting you.

553
00:27:25,395 --> 00:27:27,064
But...

554
00:27:27,105 --> 00:27:28,774
I will need a bartender.

555
00:27:30,817 --> 00:27:32,319
Oh, oh, and, um...

556
00:27:32,361 --> 00:27:34,863
make sure you come in through the back door.

557
00:27:43,705 --> 00:27:46,250
You're just in time.

558
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:51,588
Mrs. Scavo has been sworn in,
so we're all ready to start.

559
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:52,589
Hey.

560
00:27:52,631 --> 00:27:54,675
Hi.

561
00:28:01,515 --> 00:28:03,809
All right, we are now on the record.

562
00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:06,103
Okay.

563
00:28:06,144 --> 00:28:09,231
Isn't it true that while your
children were in Bree's care,

564
00:28:09,273 --> 00:28:10,732
that she passed out drunk

565
00:28:10,774 --> 00:28:14,903
and allowed them to wander off
to a downtown business district?

566
00:28:19,199 --> 00:28:23,745
My kids don't wander. They scurry, like rats.

567
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:27,082
- Excuse me?
- Do you know a rat can fit through a hole

568
00:28:27,124 --> 00:28:28,584
the size of a quarter?

569
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:31,587
Anyway, my children have
that trick down, too.

570
00:28:31,628 --> 00:28:33,172
Mrs. Scavo, are you saying

571
00:28:33,213 --> 00:28:35,340
that you don't hold Mrs.
Van de Kamp responsible

572
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,342
for endangering your children?

573
00:28:37,384 --> 00:28:39,678
No, I don't hold her responsible.

574
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,140
Bree van de Kamp and I have
known each other a long time.

575
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,641
I trust her completely.

576
00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:46,768
She's a wonderful friend
and a fantastic mother.

577
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:49,771
She puts the rest of us to shame.

578
00:28:49,813 --> 00:28:52,816
She's lying! Are you gonna let
her get away with this crap?

579
00:28:52,858 --> 00:28:54,860
(bormanis) please.

580
00:28:56,361 --> 00:28:59,490
Do you consider Mrs. Van de
Kamp to have a drinking problem?

581
00:28:59,531 --> 00:29:02,493
No.

582
00:29:02,534 --> 00:29:04,995
Then why did you line empty wine bottles

583
00:29:05,037 --> 00:29:06,705
up on her front stoop?

584
00:29:06,747 --> 00:29:10,334
I was helping Bree with her recycling.

585
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:12,586
Do I need to remind you

586
00:29:12,628 --> 00:29:15,214
of the potential consequences of perjury?

587
00:29:15,255 --> 00:29:19,426
No, you don't. In fact, I hate liars.

588
00:29:39,321 --> 00:29:40,280
Hello?

589
00:29:40,322 --> 00:29:43,450
Peter. Hi, it's Bree.

590
00:29:43,492 --> 00:29:45,077
Hey, Bree.

591
00:29:45,118 --> 00:29:47,788
You know, um, if you feel like
you're gonna need a drink,

592
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,456
you should call Donna.

593
00:29:49,498 --> 00:29:52,459
No! No, l-I don't feel like I'm gonna drink.

594
00:29:52,501 --> 00:29:54,545
And if I did, I certainly would call Donna.

595
00:29:54,586 --> 00:29:58,048
I mean, she and I are just...
we're just really clicking.

596
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:00,217
Oh, that's good. So why are you calling?

597
00:30:00,259 --> 00:30:03,136
I know it's really late notice,
but a friend of mine, uh,

598
00:30:03,178 --> 00:30:05,138
got engaged and she's throwing a party,

599
00:30:05,138 --> 00:30:07,140
and I thought, um, maybe you'd like to come.

600
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,183
Bree...

601
00:30:08,225 --> 00:30:10,352
well, you're not my sponsor anymore,

602
00:30:10,394 --> 00:30:12,729
so I assume this is allowable.

603
00:30:12,771 --> 00:30:14,940
I mean, it's just a casual get-together.

604
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,860
And they're having sushi.
You do like sushi, don't you?

605
00:30:17,901 --> 00:30:18,861
Bree...

606
00:30:24,241 --> 00:30:27,911
okay, Peter, I just really...

607
00:30:27,911 --> 00:30:29,788
need us to be friends.

608
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,790
When I'm with you, I'm not myself,

609
00:30:31,832 --> 00:30:33,041
which is a good thing.

610
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:35,919
I can... I can relax when I'm with you

611
00:30:35,961 --> 00:30:39,423
in a way that I can't when
I'm with other people.

612
00:30:40,716 --> 00:30:43,719
With them, I have to pretend
that I have it all together,

613
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,138
but...

614
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:49,308
you know that I don't, so
it's just so much easier.

615
00:30:49,308 --> 00:30:51,560
Come on, it's just A...

616
00:30:51,602 --> 00:30:53,562
it's just a dumb old party.

617
00:30:53,604 --> 00:30:55,647
Bree...

618
00:30:55,689 --> 00:30:57,357
do not call me again.

619
00:31:03,489 --> 00:31:05,449
Oh!

620
00:31:05,491 --> 00:31:07,576
Paul! I am so glad you made it.

621
00:31:07,576 --> 00:31:09,661
I appreciate the invitation, Edie.

622
00:31:09,703 --> 00:31:11,830
Although, frankly, I'm a
little surprised to get it

623
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:14,208
considering how people in this
neighborhood feel about me.

624
00:31:14,249 --> 00:31:18,170
Oh. You know me. I like to be inclusive.

625
00:31:18,212 --> 00:31:19,671
Ooh! It's heavy.

626
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:24,343
Uh, unh-unh. This is flat.

627
00:31:24,343 --> 00:31:26,386
I think I'd like, um...

628
00:31:26,428 --> 00:31:27,888
a rusty nail.

629
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,556
A what now?

630
00:31:29,598 --> 00:31:30,766
It's a cocktail,

631
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:32,476
well, I'm not really sure what's in it.

632
00:31:32,518 --> 00:31:36,230
But it sounds obscure and
complicated, so chop-chop.

633
00:31:37,439 --> 00:31:39,316
(carlos) be right there.

634
00:31:39,358 --> 00:31:41,443
Hey, hey. Put that down. We gotta go.

635
00:31:41,443 --> 00:31:44,238
- Our birth mother just went into labor.
- What?

636
00:31:44,238 --> 00:31:47,783
- That's fantastic!
- Yeah, can you believe
it? We're gonna be parents.

637
00:31:47,825 --> 00:31:49,827
(laughs) I'll go get the car. Come on.

638
00:31:49,868 --> 00:31:51,787
We were supposed to have four weeks.

639
00:31:51,829 --> 00:31:54,832
She promised me the baby wasn't
due for four more weeks.

640
00:31:54,873 --> 00:31:57,292
We don't have anything! We don't...
we don't have diapers,

641
00:31:57,334 --> 00:31:59,628
and we don't have the stuff babies drink.

642
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:00,921
Formula.

643
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,175
You know, this is a total inconvenience.

644
00:32:05,217 --> 00:32:08,846
Welcome to parenthood. Come on.

645
00:32:08,887 --> 00:32:10,848
This is your Father's bartender bible.

646
00:32:10,889 --> 00:32:13,892
- See if you can find a
recipe for a rusty nail.
- Okay.

647
00:32:19,189 --> 00:32:20,274
Um, Mom?

648
00:32:23,068 --> 00:32:25,320
Where'd you find that?

649
00:32:25,362 --> 00:32:26,822
It was stuck in here

650
00:32:26,864 --> 00:32:29,575
between a pink squirrel and a pisco sour.

651
00:32:29,616 --> 00:32:31,994
Oh.

652
00:32:32,035 --> 00:32:35,497
Well, why is your Father keeping this?

653
00:32:35,539 --> 00:32:38,000
Why you think?

654
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:47,676
Hey, Susie.

655
00:32:47,718 --> 00:32:49,178
Karl, this marriage...

656
00:32:49,219 --> 00:32:50,679
our marriage, this fake marriage,

657
00:32:50,721 --> 00:32:52,931
that's what it is, right? Fake.

658
00:32:52,973 --> 00:32:54,474
What are you talking about?

659
00:32:54,516 --> 00:32:56,810
What's this?

660
00:32:56,852 --> 00:32:58,395
Nothing.

661
00:32:58,437 --> 00:33:00,772
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

662
00:33:00,814 --> 00:33:05,444
Okay, then, repeat after me.

663
00:33:05,485 --> 00:33:06,945
"Our marriage is fake,

664
00:33:06,987 --> 00:33:09,615
"and I'm going to marry
the woman I really love...

665
00:33:09,656 --> 00:33:10,991
Edie Britt."

666
00:33:11,033 --> 00:33:13,118
If that's what you want me to say.

667
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,996
No, no, no, no! It's not about
what I want you to say.

668
00:33:16,038 --> 00:33:21,460
You have to want to say that
you want to marry Edie.

669
00:33:21,502 --> 00:33:23,504
Don't worry about this, Susie.

670
00:33:23,504 --> 00:33:25,714
Why are you hanging on to that?

671
00:33:25,756 --> 00:33:28,050
I need to look at it from time to time.

672
00:33:28,091 --> 00:33:29,259
Why?

673
00:33:33,597 --> 00:33:36,308
Consider it my punishment.

674
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:40,020
For screwing up the best thing
that ever happened to me.

675
00:33:42,105 --> 00:33:46,985
Oh. Oh, no, no, no. This is not happening.

676
00:33:47,027 --> 00:33:49,738
No, wha... mmm. Mmm!

677
00:33:49,738 --> 00:33:52,282
Oh, Karl! Oh! Will you...

678
00:33:52,324 --> 00:33:54,910
- Are you crazy?!
- Just tell me what to do, Susie.

679
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:56,870
If you want me to marry Edie, I will.

680
00:33:56,912 --> 00:33:59,706
You want me to call off
the wedding, I'll do it.

681
00:33:59,748 --> 00:34:02,167
- I'll do whatever you want.
- I'm putty.

682
00:34:02,209 --> 00:34:04,044
(edie) Karl! Whoa!

683
00:34:06,672 --> 00:34:08,173
What are you doing?

684
00:34:08,173 --> 00:34:11,718
I'm, just, uh, putting away some coats.

685
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,095
Oh.

686
00:34:13,136 --> 00:34:15,305
Well, it's time to open my presents.

687
00:34:15,347 --> 00:34:16,348
Let's go.

688
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,242
Oh, hello.

689
00:34:35,242 --> 00:34:36,493
Hi.

690
00:34:36,535 --> 00:34:38,871
Hi. Um, I need some advice
from a professional.

691
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:40,873
I'd like to get stinking drunk.

692
00:34:40,873 --> 00:34:44,585
Do you have anything that can
accomplish that in a hurry?

693
00:34:48,714 --> 00:34:50,674
I forgot the lamaze book in my purse!

694
00:34:50,716 --> 00:34:53,218
Oh, forget it. Come on.
Let's go. We'll wing it.

695
00:34:56,555 --> 00:34:58,599
Oh, we missed it!

696
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,018
The kid just slipped right out.

697
00:35:01,059 --> 00:35:02,644
Are you family?

698
00:35:07,649 --> 00:35:09,151
They're the parents.

699
00:35:16,575 --> 00:35:19,536
Would you like to help?

700
00:35:19,536 --> 00:35:20,996
No, thanks.

701
00:35:21,038 --> 00:35:24,708
You guys look like you got it covered.

702
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:26,877
Oh, are you sure, honey?

703
00:35:26,919 --> 00:35:28,504
Come on, Gaby.

704
00:35:28,545 --> 00:35:30,672
I just, um...

705
00:35:30,714 --> 00:35:32,674
l-I don't wanna do anything to screw it up.

706
00:35:32,716 --> 00:35:34,885
She won't break.

707
00:35:34,927 --> 00:35:37,221
Here.

708
00:35:37,262 --> 00:35:38,388
Okay.

709
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,685
Hi.

710
00:35:43,727 --> 00:35:45,938
Hi.

711
00:35:49,107 --> 00:35:53,779
Oh, honey, you were right.

712
00:35:53,821 --> 00:35:55,364
About what?

713
00:35:59,618 --> 00:36:01,620
It was all worth it.

714
00:36:11,672 --> 00:36:14,591
- Serving bowls.
- Just what I needed, Lynette.

715
00:36:14,633 --> 00:36:17,553
There's a gift receipt taped
to the bottom of the box.

716
00:36:17,594 --> 00:36:19,346
Oh. Thank God!

717
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:24,393
Okay, the next one is from Felicia.

718
00:36:24,434 --> 00:36:26,854
I do hope you like it.

719
00:36:26,895 --> 00:36:28,856
Oh, you know what they say...

720
00:36:28,897 --> 00:36:32,568
good things come in small packages.

721
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,991
What is it?

722
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:42,578
Teeth?

723
00:36:42,578 --> 00:36:43,704
Dentures.

724
00:36:45,664 --> 00:36:48,542
They were my dear Sister Martha's.

725
00:36:48,584 --> 00:36:51,545
I'm sure none of you knew,
but she had orthodontic issues

726
00:36:51,587 --> 00:36:54,631
from the time she was a ild.

727
00:36:54,673 --> 00:36:57,968
Oh.

728
00:36:58,010 --> 00:36:59,303
Thank you.

729
00:36:59,344 --> 00:37:02,973
I know it's an unconventional
gift for an engagement party,

730
00:37:02,973 --> 00:37:05,184
but you and Martha were
such close friends, Edie.

731
00:37:05,225 --> 00:37:07,186
I wanted you to have something truly personal

732
00:37:07,227 --> 00:37:08,687
to remember her by,

733
00:37:08,729 --> 00:37:12,107
since she left us so... abruptly.

734
00:37:12,107 --> 00:37:13,609
You know,

735
00:37:13,609 --> 00:37:15,903
when Paul Young strangled
her, crushed her windpipe

736
00:37:15,944 --> 00:37:17,946
and buried her alive

737
00:37:17,988 --> 00:37:20,407
next to a garbage-strewn hiking trail.

738
00:37:20,407 --> 00:37:23,327
Felicia, uh... I think you've had enough.

739
00:37:25,037 --> 00:37:27,998
I do apologize if I've offended anyone,

740
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:31,460
but... while you all are chitchatting

741
00:37:31,502 --> 00:37:33,754
and eating these gummy hors d'oeuvres,

742
00:37:33,795 --> 00:37:35,339
just remember...

743
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:37,799
you're in the company of a murderer.

744
00:38:13,001 --> 00:38:15,379
Bree?

745
00:38:15,379 --> 00:38:16,380
Bree?

746
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:24,096
Why didn't you call Donna?

747
00:38:24,137 --> 00:38:27,349
Hmm.

748
00:38:27,391 --> 00:38:30,185
I don't need Donna.

749
00:38:30,227 --> 00:38:32,396
I need you.

750
00:38:49,121 --> 00:38:52,124
You know, I don't even like redheads.

751
00:38:55,919 --> 00:38:57,379
Okay, it's my turn.

752
00:38:57,421 --> 00:39:00,007
Shh. In a minute.

753
00:39:00,007 --> 00:39:03,260
Come on, you're hogging her.

754
00:39:03,302 --> 00:39:06,180
(frank) tell me! You tell
me who it is, Libby.

755
00:39:06,221 --> 00:39:07,681
(libby) are you drunk?

756
00:39:07,723 --> 00:39:09,641
Who is he, Libby? Hmm?

757
00:39:09,683 --> 00:39:11,768
I got to know.

758
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:14,313
I already told you, he's just some rodeo guy.

759
00:39:14,354 --> 00:39:16,690
- I don't even remember his name.
- Liar!

760
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:19,568
What are you doing?

761
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:21,320
I am gonna light myself on fire.

762
00:39:21,361 --> 00:39:24,531
He's gonna light himself
on fire with coffee liqueur?

763
00:39:24,573 --> 00:39:26,408
Would not have been my choice.

764
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:28,911
Tell me his name, or I'm gonna do it!

765
00:39:28,952 --> 00:39:30,662
Frank, you're being an idiot.

766
00:39:32,414 --> 00:39:34,124
It was Dale, okay? It was Dale.

767
00:39:34,166 --> 00:39:36,877
(woman over P. A.) security to maternity.

768
00:39:36,919 --> 00:39:41,006
My brother Dale? He's a kid!

769
00:39:41,006 --> 00:39:43,800
Well, he's 19, Frank.
He knows which end is up.

770
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:47,471
Wait, what is she saying?

771
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:49,890
There's a Father.

772
00:39:49,932 --> 00:39:51,099
Hey! Hey!

773
00:39:53,268 --> 00:39:54,895
No. (frank) leave me alone!

774
00:39:54,937 --> 00:39:56,563
I'm not giving up the baby.

775
00:39:56,605 --> 00:39:59,274
Let's get him out of here.

776
00:39:59,483 --> 00:40:01,235
No! No!

777
00:40:01,276 --> 00:40:03,111
Security to o-b. Security to o-b, stat.

778
00:40:03,946 --> 00:40:05,948
What the hell are you doing?

779
00:40:05,948 --> 00:40:07,449
Taking our baby home.

780
00:40:07,449 --> 00:40:09,409
She's not ours. The papers
aren't valid anymore.

781
00:40:09,451 --> 00:40:11,245
She has a Father.

782
00:40:11,286 --> 00:40:13,247
Do you really wanna leave
this beautiful little girl

783
00:40:13,288 --> 00:40:15,249
with that white trash freak show?!

784
00:40:15,249 --> 00:40:16,708
Huh?

785
00:40:16,708 --> 00:40:18,460
Well, come on, then.

786
00:40:25,634 --> 00:40:27,094
Where?

787
00:40:27,135 --> 00:40:28,762
Maternity. Maternity.

788
00:40:28,804 --> 00:40:30,389
All right.

789
00:40:34,601 --> 00:40:35,602
Hurry up!

790
00:40:35,644 --> 00:40:37,604
I'm hurrying.

791
00:40:39,773 --> 00:40:42,025
Man, there's a lot of straps on this thing!

792
00:40:42,067 --> 00:40:45,487
How does this thing go
in? Read the instructions!

793
00:40:45,529 --> 00:40:47,364
"Pass strap 'a' through strap 'b,'

794
00:40:47,406 --> 00:40:49,908
Making sure that the harness
clip is at the chest level."

795
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:52,911
- Well, which damn one is the harness clip?
- That is after the baby is in.

796
00:40:52,953 --> 00:40:54,872
You have to connect it to the car first!

797
00:40:54,913 --> 00:40:56,874
I told you we should've got an S. U. V.!

798
00:40:56,915 --> 00:40:59,793
Okay, stop yelling! This is very complicated.

799
00:40:59,793 --> 00:41:01,795
Oh, for God's sakes. Just take the baby.

800
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:09,052
Wow. We're good to go.

801
00:41:09,094 --> 00:41:12,097
Give me the baby.

802
00:41:14,933 --> 00:41:16,894
You know this isn't gonna end well.

803
00:41:16,935 --> 00:41:19,730
You know, they're just gonna
try and take her back.

804
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:23,859
Maybe. But we don't have
to make it easy for them.

805
00:41:23,901 --> 00:41:25,027
Gaby, I...

806
00:41:25,027 --> 00:41:27,696
look, just buckle up!

807
00:41:36,497 --> 00:41:39,291
Temptation comes to all of us.

808
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:41,293
Whether or not we succumb

809
00:41:41,293 --> 00:41:46,632
depends on our ability
to recognize its disguise.

810
00:41:46,632 --> 00:41:51,011
Sometimes it arrives in
the form of an old flame,

811
00:41:51,053 --> 00:41:53,722
flickering back to life.

812
00:41:55,432 --> 00:41:57,100
Or a new friend

813
00:41:57,142 --> 00:42:01,230
who could end up being so much more.

814
00:42:04,817 --> 00:42:06,693
Or a young child

815
00:42:06,693 --> 00:42:11,782
who awakens feelings we didn't know we had.

816
00:42:13,367 --> 00:42:17,162
And so we give in to temptation,

817
00:42:17,162 --> 00:42:21,500
all the while knowing come morning,

818
00:42:21,542 --> 00:42:23,961
we'll have to suffer the consequences.
