all in the name of love

14
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:38,830
If there is one thing Eddie Brit understood,it was nature of war

15
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:44,628
after two fail marriages and countless rocky romances

16
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,631
She had learned love was a battle field

17
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:53,762
it is the easiest way to survive the carnage was total surrender

18
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:59,309

34
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:09,087

the guest bedroom on the second floor of Whiteapples' house had the best view in all misteria lane

00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:09,565

00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:59,219
I'm saying god help those who help themselves

185
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:06,768
hey,i got great news

186
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:09,646
we just landed the black frozen yorghout account

187
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:11,857
really they love the pitch ?

188
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:14,067
The talking cows rocking their world

189
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,987
how do they like my bull clinton idea

190
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:21,074
well i rewrote some of stuff we work on

191
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:24,369
but you know essentially it'sthe same and they eat it up

192
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:26,997
that is fantastic

193
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:31,251
finally we can afford hire another executive

194
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:35,547
terrific,tell me did they like the promtion plan about a bounch of cow eating contest

195
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:39,510
the pitch was running long so we cut off a few things

196
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,303
I'm just glad they love my idea

197
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:42,638
to be fair

198
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:45,265
do they like the hugh play cows

199
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:48,560
they're calling in for meeting i gotta go

200
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:50,103
i love you bye

201
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:57,319
so this is your spleen

202
00:12:57,361 --> 00:13:01,865
normally it would over here because your missing ligament structure

203
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:04,409
it has wander under over there right next to the liver

204
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:06,286
we discuss about this aftermeaning

205
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:08,956
every one thinks you should remove it immediately

206
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:12,626
okay

207
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:18,966
i guess you guys have all sorts of new exciting technians you don't even cut open the body

208
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:20,467
no not really

209
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:22,386
no?

210
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:27,641
so we're talking surgery

211
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:30,477
well i guess i can handle that

212
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:32,521
people got cut open everyday

213
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:35,649
so i assume you will let me do the surgery

214
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:36,275
you ?

215
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:42,114
it seems natural i know the most about your case i promise you will be in very good hands

216
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,412
what?

217
00:13:50,122 --> 00:13:54,334
the first time you see me naked i will be on an operating table

218
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:57,671
i promise i will be a perfect gentleman my eyes will be strictly on the spleen

219
00:13:57,713 --> 00:14:00,382
docter mrs baker is here for her follow-up

220
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:05,095
we need to schedule susan for splenectomy,with me

221
00:14:05,721 --> 00:14:08,223
Oh,congratulations!

222
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:10,392
So I will call you later?

223
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:14,188
Oh,I am so happy for him.He's such a doll.

224
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:16,273
I'm curious. Um...

225
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:19,526
why were youso congratulatory?

226
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:21,320
Oh,the spleen surgery--

227
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,697
it'll be his first!

228
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:30,704
Hey,honey.

229
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,957
Can we talkabout something?

230
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:35,375
Sure.

231
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:40,464
So I've been thinkingabout the whole baby thing.

232
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:45,177
And how ever long it takes for you to feel ready,I am fine with.

233
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:46,887
Okay.

234
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:48,972
But here's the deal--

235
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:53,060
I need to knowthat this isn't a maybe.

236
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:57,439
I want a promisethat we will have children.

237
00:14:57,481 --> 00:15:00,901
I'm sorry.I can't promise that.

238
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:02,194
Why not?

239
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:05,322
Because I can't saythat I'm gonna wake up tomorrow

240
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:08,075
and suddenly wanna do somethingthat I swore my entire life

241
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:11,370
I would never do. "Maybe" isa very big step for me.

242
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:12,788
Yeah,well,it isn'tbig enough for me.

243
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,998
Well,I'm sorry,but you'rejust gonna have to accept it.

244
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,375
There's nothing else you can do.

245
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,460
That isn'tnecessarily true.

246
00:15:18,502 --> 00:15:19,962
Excuse me?

247
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:21,630
Annulments

248
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:27,928
You are threatening mewith an annulment?

249
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:32,558
That conniving little bitchput you up to this,didn't she?

250
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:33,267
Didn't she?

251
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:36,311
This fight could beover right now
if you'd justmake me a promise.

252
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:40,732
The only promiseI am making you
is that this isso not over.

253
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:45,821
hi!

254
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:46,947
Hey.

255
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:48,073
Hi.

256
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:52,494
How's the search coming forthe new ad exec? Any luck?

257
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:55,998
Oh,the pickings are slim.

258
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:59,793
So far none ofmy top choices are available.

259
00:15:59,835 --> 00:16:02,796
Hey,um,do you have someonefrom your old company

260
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:04,965
that you could,you know,maybe recommend?

261
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:05,966
Daddy!Well--

262
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:08,218
I can't find my toothbrush.

263
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:09,761
I'll be upin a second,buddy.

264
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:10,929
Hi.

265
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:13,390
As a matter of fact,

266
00:16:13,432 --> 00:16:15,184
there's this one guy who would be perfect.

267
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:16,059
Yeah?

268
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:19,396
Yeah,hard-working,smart as a whip. Total package.

269
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:22,191
Really? What's his name?

270
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:22,900
Tom.

271
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:24,484
Tom? Tom what?

272
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:26,153
Tom scavo.

273
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:30,699
no! No!

274
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:33,785
I do not think thatthat is a good idea.

275
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:35,704
Come on,honey,I mean,the other nightdoing those pitches--

276
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:36,955
it just gotthe old juices flowing.

277
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:39,166
I remembered how muchI miss having a real job.

278
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:43,170
You have a real job,right herestaying home with the kids.

279
00:16:43,212 --> 00:16:46,632
With two incomes,we couldafford a top-notch nanny.

280
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:47,841
What about penny?

281
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:50,511
You're the one who fought foroffice day care. Let's use it.

282
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:53,180
What about the two of us workingand living together?

283
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,641
I think that could bea recipe for disaster.

284
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:59,603
Why? The last timethat we worked together...

285
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:03,232
we fell in love.

286
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:05,442
Oh,it's just...

287
00:17:05,484 --> 00:17:07,152
I'M...

288
00:17:07,236 --> 00:17:12,866
I'm not sure that you would findthis job that satisfying.

289
00:17:12,908 --> 00:17:14,201
You don't thinkI'm good enough,do you?

290
00:17:14,243 --> 00:17:15,911
I'm not saying that.

291
00:17:15,953 --> 00:17:20,123
Daddy,I stillcan't find my toothbrush!

292
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:22,125
- I'll go.
- I got it.

293
00:17:23,252 --> 00:17:25,295
Come on,buddy.Let's hunt it down.

294
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,048
So who won the fight?

295
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:28,674
We weren't fighting.

296
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,884
Mommy's just lettingdaddy know where he stands.

297
00:17:30,926 --> 00:17:34,555
Oh,hey! Hey!

298
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:41,061
- thanks for coming in,mr. Gainey.
- We'll be in touch.

299
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:43,397
Thank you. Bye.

300
00:17:43,689 --> 00:17:44,398
What did you think?

301
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:45,858
Well,honestly,I wasn't blown away.

302
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:47,276
I know the pickingsare slim,

303
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:48,944
but we can't hold outmuch longer.

304
00:17:48,986 --> 00:17:50,153
We need to hiresomeone this week.

305
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:52,948
I know! I know! I know.

306
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:54,324
So who's up next?

307
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:56,577
Tom cavos.You ever heard of him?

308
00:17:58,871 --> 00:18:00,414
Just... uh...

309
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:05,002
could you excuse mefor just a minute?

310
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:06,170
Sure.

311
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:11,758
- Tom cavos?
- Yeah,it's an anagram.

312
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,385
It's deceptively simple,don't you think?

313
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:14,761
What do you think
you're doing?

314
00:18:14,845 --> 00:18:16,263
I'm going overyour head.

315
00:18:16,305 --> 00:18:17,472
I mean,you mightnot think I'm good enough,

316
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:19,391
but maybe ed will bea little more open-minded,

317
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:22,936
since,you know,he's notconstantly competing with me.

318
00:18:24,188 --> 00:18:25,439
You want the truth,tom?

319
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,483
I think you're good.You have moments of brilliance.

320
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:31,195
But I also thinksometimes you coast.

321
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:32,863
And I thinkif i were your boss

322
00:18:32,905 --> 00:18:34,656
and had to ride your assevery day,

323
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:38,035
you would come homeseething with resentment.

324
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:41,205
Come on! It's hard enoughkeeping a marriage together.

325
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:43,540
If you're at all concernedabout saving our marriage,

326
00:18:43,582 --> 00:18:45,584
you better let metake my shot.

327
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:46,460
What does that mean?

328
00:18:46,502 --> 00:18:49,963
It means that a little partof me has been hating you

329
00:18:50,005 --> 00:18:52,966
ever since you tankedmy promotion at petersen.

330
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:53,509
Tom...

331
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:57,721
but I could let it all go ifyou'll give me this one thing.

332
00:18:57,763 --> 00:19:00,307
Excuse me.Ed's waiting for you guys.

333
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:02,726
Great! Great!

334
00:19:02,935 --> 00:19:05,479
Just let my résuméspeak for itself.

335
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:08,148
Uh,just let your résuméspeak for itself?

336
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,107
Yes.

337
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:11,860
okay!

338
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,696
Oh! You workedthe poncer cheese accounts?

339
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,949
Those "angry mouse" spots?They were hilarious!

340
00:19:16,949 --> 00:19:18,659
I was on thatfrom the beginning.

341
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,494
warning,do not eat the cheese!

342
00:19:20,536 --> 00:19:22,329
The cheese is evil!

343
00:19:22,371 --> 00:19:23,455
I love that!

344
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:25,582
You've got a great résum?Thank you.

345
00:19:25,624 --> 00:19:28,126
Yeah,gosh,it is.It's quite impressive.

346
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:30,963
Oh,wow,I see you workedfor bellfore and barrasso.

347
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,798
That's a great shop.

348
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,299
Yeah,I put my time in.

349
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:35,676
Uh-huh,and when were you there?

350
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:40,264
Because you forgot to list your dates of employmentfor that one.

351
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:42,683
Um,that wasa few years back.

352
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:45,936
Uh-huh. And how longdid you stay?

353
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:48,313
Just about five months,actually.

354
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:50,399
What,did you getrecruited by another firm?

355
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,234
Did somebodycherry-pick ya?

356
00:19:52,276 --> 00:19:54,319
No,I was fired.

357
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:56,613
Yeah,but honestly,I was happy to leave

358
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:58,031
because they didn't getmy sense of humor.

359
00:19:58,073 --> 00:20:01,285
I actually pitched a version of the "cheese is evil"there first.

360
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:02,494
They hated it.

361
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:04,496
Idiots!Well,their loss,right?

362
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:07,249
Yep.And I see you won a clio for the thompson's salad dressing spot.

363
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:08,333
That was very cool.

364
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:11,044
So did you do that solo?

365
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:13,672
Actually,no. My wifehelped me on that one.

366
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:15,632
Um,she's inadvertising,too.

367
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:16,633
But if you were to ask her,

368
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:20,262
I'm sure she'd tell you she did the whole thing all by herself.

369
00:20:21,722 --> 00:20:24,600
credit hog,huh?I know the type.

370
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:28,478
You know what,tom?I like you.

371
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:29,521
Ed...

372
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:31,648
and I'm not usually onefor hiring in the room.

373
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:33,442
No,no,no,no,we never hire in the room.

374
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:36,195
But we're in a time crunch,and we need someone now.

375
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:38,197
I think you're the guy.

376
00:20:38,614 --> 00:20:40,449
Lynette,you got any issues?

377
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:41,867
Well...

378
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:44,828
um,let me just call ina few references

379
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:46,580
before we makeanything official.

380
00:20:46,622 --> 00:20:49,458
Sure! Sure!We'll be in touch,okay?

381
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,293
the cheese is evil!

382
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:53,003
Oh,god,I love that.

383
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:03,180
Oh,um,I'm lookingfor father crowley.

384
00:21:03,222 --> 00:21:04,097
Do you know where he is?

385
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:06,225
Um,he's inthe confessional.

386
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:12,356
How long has it beensince your last confession?

387
00:21:12,481 --> 00:21:13,941
Who cares?

388
00:21:13,941 --> 00:21:15,776
Father,it's me.

389
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:16,693
Gabrielle?

390
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:17,736
Yeah.

391
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:20,197
Look,I need youto do something for me.

392
00:21:20,197 --> 00:21:23,158
I need you to get rid ofsister mary bernard.

393
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:24,827
What? Why?

394
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:26,745
Because she's ruiningmy marriage.

395
00:21:26,787 --> 00:21:28,622
- Sister mary?
- Yes!

396
00:21:28,664 --> 00:21:31,124
At first it startedwith the love letters while he was in prison,

397
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,042
and the next thing I know,

398
00:21:32,084 --> 00:21:34,253
they're spendingday and night together--

399
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:37,047
sneaking offto private bible study,

400
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:40,509
- and one-on-onespiritual consultation.
- Gabrielle--

401
00:21:40,551 --> 00:21:45,055
and if that wasn't enough,he issaying her name in his sleep.

402
00:21:45,097 --> 00:21:47,850
"hold me,sister mary,hold me."

403
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:50,811
it's disgusting.He's like a lovesick puppy.

404
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:56,900
do you have reasonto believe that your husbandand sister mary are...

405
00:21:56,942 --> 00:21:59,653
having sex?

406
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,575
Speak from the heart,gabrielle.

407
00:22:04,616 --> 00:22:08,328
This is just betweenme,you and god.

408
00:22:15,711 --> 00:22:19,339
Yeah... yep.They're having sex.

409
00:22:19,423 --> 00:22:21,925
Carlos confessedeverything...

410
00:22:21,967 --> 00:22:25,345
right beforehe asked for an annulment.

411
00:22:46,658 --> 00:22:49,119
forgive me,father,for I have sinned.

412
00:22:49,161 --> 00:22:51,705
How long sinceyour last confession?

413
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:53,665
Mm,not that long ago.

414
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:56,585
Look,I sorta told a fib,so...

415
00:22:56,627 --> 00:22:59,296
how many "hail marys"is that gonna set me back?

416
00:23:09,932 --> 00:23:12,476
- oh,honey.
- Go away!

417
00:23:12,851 --> 00:23:15,521
Oh,honey,what happenedwasn't my fault.

418
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:19,149
There's no way I could'vepredicted how betty would react.

419
00:23:19,233 --> 00:23:22,194
Oh,please,you knewsomething bad would happen.

420
00:23:22,236 --> 00:23:24,863
You wanted all thisto blow up in my face.

421
00:23:24,905 --> 00:23:27,366
Oh,honey,why would I want that?

422
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:30,160
Because you're jealous thatmy life's just getting started

423
00:23:30,202 --> 00:23:32,204
and yours is over.

424
00:23:32,788 --> 00:23:35,707
Danielle,that's ridiculous,sweetheart.

425
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:36,917
Daddy's dead.

426
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:39,086
You drove your boyfriendto suicide.

427
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:40,462
You're getting olderby the minute,

428
00:23:40,504 --> 00:23:42,714
and soon you'll beso dried up and bitter

429
00:23:42,756 --> 00:23:46,260
that no man will ever wantto touch you ever again.

430
00:23:46,301 --> 00:23:47,135
Danielle...

431
00:23:47,177 --> 00:23:49,638
and now you're determinedto ruin my life

432
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,932
so I have to stay with you hereand keep you company

433
00:23:51,974 --> 00:23:54,977
while you turninto an old fossil.

434
00:23:55,102 --> 00:23:58,438
All I ever wanted wasfor you to be happy.

435
00:23:58,522 --> 00:24:01,817
Don't just want it.Make it happen.

436
00:24:15,998 --> 00:24:18,542
danielle,I don't feel muchlike cooking tonight.

437
00:24:18,584 --> 00:24:21,086
I'm thinkingof ordering a pizza.

438
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:23,380
I want canadian bacon.

439
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:24,798
Please.

440
00:24:25,007 --> 00:24:26,675
All right.

441
00:24:38,896 --> 00:24:41,565
He's mad at you'cause you hit him.

442
00:24:41,607 --> 00:24:44,401
Well,I feel bad about that.

443
00:24:44,401 --> 00:24:47,613
But when I considerthe risks he was taking...

444
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:50,365
it's a shamehe can't see that girl.

445
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:52,326
She's so pretty.

446
00:24:54,995 --> 00:24:57,456
What did you sayabout danielle?

447
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:01,001
I said that she...

448
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:08,008
you know I don't want youthinking about things like that.

449
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:10,844
I'm sorry.I didn'T. I'm sorry.

450
00:25:10,886 --> 00:25:13,263
It's okay. It's okay.

451
00:25:14,515 --> 00:25:16,642
Go on and run upto your room.

452
00:25:16,683 --> 00:25:18,852
Read the comics I got you.

453
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:20,729
And,caleb?

454
00:25:21,813 --> 00:25:25,275
If I ever catch you lookingat that van de kamp girl,

455
00:25:25,317 --> 00:25:28,445
I'll hit you twice as hardas I hit your brother,

456
00:25:28,487 --> 00:25:30,906
and I won't feel bad about it.

457
00:25:30,948 --> 00:25:32,074
Okay?

458
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:35,118
Okay.

459
00:25:46,088 --> 00:25:48,882
So this wholesplenectomy thing--

460
00:25:48,924 --> 00:25:51,468
you feelgood about it,huh?

461
00:25:51,677 --> 00:25:53,846
Yeah,yeah,I told you.It's a routine surgery.

462
00:25:53,887 --> 00:25:55,264
You're gonna be fine.

463
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,349
Right,right.

464
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:02,229
Actually,I sort of meant,um...

465
00:26:02,354 --> 00:26:05,440
do you personallyfeel confident?

466
00:26:05,482 --> 00:26:06,733
What do you mean?

467
00:26:08,068 --> 00:26:11,238
Well,you know,you're gonna be...

468
00:26:12,364 --> 00:26:13,615
hacking into me,

469
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:18,495
and I just wanted to make surethat you feel ready.

470
00:26:18,537 --> 00:26:20,581
I've never taken outa spleen before.

471
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:22,624
But believe me,it's no big deal.

472
00:26:22,666 --> 00:26:24,334
Spleen,gallbladder--it's all the same.

473
00:26:24,376 --> 00:26:26,587
Okay,red flag! See,I didn'tgo to medical school,

474
00:26:26,628 --> 00:26:28,672
but I'm thinking--not all the same.

475
00:26:28,714 --> 00:26:31,508
Susan,I know what I'm doing.You're gonna have to trust me.

476
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,886
I would like to.But I gotta be honest--

477
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:36,054
the fact that you can't evencut that steak isn't helping.

478
00:26:36,054 --> 00:26:37,347
That's not fair.You overcooked it,

479
00:26:37,389 --> 00:26:39,308
and,frankly,it's not the freshest meat.

480
00:26:39,349 --> 00:26:42,519
Well,neither am I.I've got 35 years on that cow.

481
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:46,690
Wait,susan,are you saying you don't want meto be your surgeon?

482
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:50,777
I'm sorry.

483
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:55,032
I don't mean this to soundthe wrong way. I just...

484
00:26:55,073 --> 00:26:58,785
I would be more comfortablewith an experienced surgeon.

485
00:26:58,994 --> 00:27:01,747
That's okay. I understand.

486
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:03,332
Thank you.

487
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:06,627
I should really be going.

488
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,794
What?

489
00:27:10,547 --> 00:27:12,174
I didn't evenserve dessert yet.

490
00:27:12,216 --> 00:27:13,509
You said you understood!

491
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:15,969
No,I do,I do.I respect your decision to see another doctor,

492
00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:16,386
but you know what?

493
00:27:16,428 --> 00:27:18,096
You need to respectthat my feelings are hurt.

494
00:27:18,138 --> 00:27:23,185
What? You want me to putmy life on the line to service your ego?

495
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:26,563
I save lives every day.I cut. I save. I cut. I save.

496
00:27:26,605 --> 00:27:28,690
That's what I do,and if that gives me an out-of-control ego,

497
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:31,902
well,maybe I need that to cut intoanother human being.

498
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,446
jim...

499
00:27:42,371 --> 00:27:44,122
hey.Hey.

500
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,667
Dinner's ready.

501
00:27:48,293 --> 00:27:52,422
So did you call around?Check on my references?

502
00:27:52,548 --> 00:27:54,424
I told edyou were my husband,

503
00:27:54,466 --> 00:27:55,884
and he was cool with that.

504
00:27:55,884 --> 00:27:58,637
He really wants to hire you.

505
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:01,932
So who am ito stand in the way?

506
00:28:02,224 --> 00:28:04,726
Really? So I got the job?

507
00:28:05,185 --> 00:28:07,187
On one condition.

508
00:28:09,815 --> 00:28:11,942
If you take this job,

509
00:28:11,984 --> 00:28:14,152
you are never allowedto bring up

510
00:28:14,194 --> 00:28:17,072
what happened beforewith your promotion.

511
00:28:17,114 --> 00:28:18,198
That's it? Deal.

512
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,909
No,it's not a deal.I need a solemn vow

513
00:28:20,951 --> 00:28:24,580
that you will never throwthat in my face ever again.

514
00:28:24,621 --> 00:28:27,207
Because if you do,you will unleash demons

515
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:29,376
that you do not wanna meet.

516
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,253
I get it.

517
00:28:31,753 --> 00:28:34,840
And what i really need from you...

518
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,969
is to be forgiven.

519
00:28:42,055 --> 00:28:44,600
Actually,I already haD.

520
00:29:01,325 --> 00:29:03,744
This dinner is really good.

521
00:29:03,785 --> 00:29:05,037
Thank you.

522
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:12,503
Thank you.

523
00:29:29,937 --> 00:29:31,939
- Hi,betty.
- Hello.

524
00:29:32,022 --> 00:29:35,526
I wanted to talk to youabout what happened the other day with the kids.

525
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:37,569
I told you,we will be moving soon.

526
00:29:37,653 --> 00:29:39,780
There's nothingto worry about.

527
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:43,075
Well,my fear is thatif we keep them apart,

528
00:29:43,116 --> 00:29:45,202
they'll try that much harderto be together.

529
00:29:45,244 --> 00:29:47,538
I mean,you knowhow teenagers can be,and,

530
00:29:47,579 --> 00:29:50,249
well,a lot can happenin a couple of weeks.

531
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:51,875
I'll make a deal with you.

532
00:29:51,917 --> 00:29:55,629
If you control yours,I will control mine.

533
00:29:56,797 --> 00:29:59,049
Well,how about someold-fashioned chaperoning?

534
00:29:59,091 --> 00:30:01,718
That way they can,um,still see each other,

535
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,680
and we won't have tobe the villains.

536
00:30:04,805 --> 00:30:06,974
When it comesto my son's best interests,

537
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:08,517
I'm not afraid of beingthe villain.

538
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:11,937
I assumed that you wouldfeel the same way,bree.

539
00:30:14,898 --> 00:30:16,567
Now that you mention it,I guess I do.

540
00:30:16,608 --> 00:30:20,529
I have to go. I have some,um,muffins in the oven.

541
00:30:37,337 --> 00:30:38,505
Mom,what's wrong?

542
00:30:38,547 --> 00:30:40,591
It's the applewhites. I don't want you to go near them.

543
00:30:40,632 --> 00:30:41,508
What?!

544
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:43,385
Do you remember the manthey arrested--

545
00:30:43,427 --> 00:30:45,095
the one that brokeinto gabrielle's

546
00:30:45,137 --> 00:30:47,389
and escapedfrom the mental hospital?

547
00:30:48,098 --> 00:30:49,433
He's there.

548
00:30:49,474 --> 00:30:52,060
I saw him in their window.They're hiding him.

549
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,353
You're kidding.No,I'm not.

550
00:30:53,395 --> 00:30:56,190
And I forbid youto go over there.

551
00:30:56,273 --> 00:30:59,276
Lynette,hi,it's bree.Uh,listen,

552
00:30:59,318 --> 00:31:00,360
call me when youget this message,

553
00:31:00,402 --> 00:31:01,737
and please cometo poker tonight.

554
00:31:01,778 --> 00:31:04,948
I have some big newsabout the applewhites.

555
00:31:06,325 --> 00:31:08,285
All right,bye.

556
00:31:09,244 --> 00:31:10,537
Who was that?

557
00:31:10,621 --> 00:31:12,206
Sister mary.

558
00:31:13,207 --> 00:31:16,877
They just transferred her toa parish in fairbanks,alaska.

559
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:18,795
You're kidding me. Why?

560
00:31:18,795 --> 00:31:20,380
She doesn't know.

561
00:31:20,422 --> 00:31:23,008
The diocese wouldn't evengive her a reason.

562
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:25,886
Ah,vatican politics.

563
00:31:29,932 --> 00:31:31,266
What's wrong?

564
00:31:31,517 --> 00:31:34,144
I think I'm just coming downwith a migraine.

565
00:31:34,186 --> 00:31:35,938
Oh,well,maybe youshould go lie down.

566
00:31:35,938 --> 00:31:38,106
I'm gonna be outfor a while.

567
00:31:38,649 --> 00:31:39,983
All right.

568
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:49,243
Uh,I'll see you there.

569
00:31:49,326 --> 00:31:51,912
Susan?What are you doing here?

570
00:31:51,954 --> 00:31:53,205
We need to talk.

571
00:31:53,288 --> 00:31:54,998
Okay,all right,but,look,I just got out of surgery.

572
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,793
I've been waitingfor three hours.

573
00:32:00,671 --> 00:32:02,381
After you stormed outthe other night,

574
00:32:02,422 --> 00:32:03,966
I started to doubt myself.

575
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:04,800
I started to think,

576
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,095
"gee,you know,maybe I shouldjust ignore my better instincts,

577
00:32:08,136 --> 00:32:10,597
and I should let dr. Ron gut me like a fish."

578
00:32:10,597 --> 00:32:11,598
- Susan--
- I mean,why not?

579
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,599
'Cause all my life,

580
00:32:12,641 --> 00:32:15,310
I have jumped through hoopsto keep men from leaving.

581
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:18,438
But I'm not doing it anymore.So tough luck,pally.

582
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,774
You just missed outon a good thing.

583
00:32:20,858 --> 00:32:22,025
Susan...

584
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,152
you've been herefor three hours?

585
00:32:24,194 --> 00:32:25,654
Yeah.Well,two hours ago,

586
00:32:25,696 --> 00:32:29,700
flowers,champagneand an apology note were deliveredto your doorstep.

587
00:32:30,492 --> 00:32:31,034
Really?

588
00:32:31,076 --> 00:32:33,370
Look,I put our relationshipat risk,all right?

589
00:32:33,412 --> 00:32:35,080
And it was stupid.

590
00:32:36,415 --> 00:32:41,461
I haven't felt this wayabout somebody in a long time.

591
00:32:42,254 --> 00:32:46,091
Susan,I really like you.

592
00:32:46,175 --> 00:32:48,260
And because of that,I...

593
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,679
I can't be your doctor,let alone,your surgeon.

594
00:32:50,721 --> 00:32:54,099
I mean,there's a pretty good reason why they make those rules.

595
00:32:54,391 --> 00:32:56,143
Listen,I hopeyou forgive me,all right?

596
00:32:56,185 --> 00:32:59,104
Because I'll hate myselfif I lose you.

597
00:33:04,193 --> 00:33:06,487
I wouldn't want youto hate yourself.

598
00:33:06,528 --> 00:33:07,362
No.

599
00:33:11,825 --> 00:33:15,120
And I am so sorryabout that... snap thing.

600
00:33:15,162 --> 00:33:18,415
I was just tryingto be theatrical.

601
00:33:25,172 --> 00:33:27,716
I got your note.What's going on?

602
00:33:27,758 --> 00:33:30,427
Are you hidingsomeone in your house?

603
00:33:31,803 --> 00:33:32,596
What?

604
00:33:32,638 --> 00:33:34,890
My mom saw someone inyour second-story window.

605
00:33:34,932 --> 00:33:37,768
She thinks it's the guywho broke into mrs. Solis'.

606
00:33:37,768 --> 00:33:38,894
Damn it,caleb.

607
00:33:38,894 --> 00:33:40,395
Is that his name?

608
00:33:40,437 --> 00:33:41,855
Has she told anybody else?

609
00:33:41,897 --> 00:33:43,857
She left messageson her friends' machines.

610
00:33:43,899 --> 00:33:45,776
They're coming oversoon to get details.

611
00:33:45,817 --> 00:33:46,985
We're gonna have to leave tonight.

612
00:33:47,027 --> 00:33:48,612
- This is--
- why? What's going on?

613
00:33:48,654 --> 00:33:51,698
I would loveto tell you,believe me,I would.

614
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,659
But I can'T.

615
00:33:53,784 --> 00:33:56,495
If you trust me,I could help you.

616
00:33:57,371 --> 00:33:59,748
My familyhas secrets,too.

617
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,458
What my brother did--

618
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:03,710
it's bad.

619
00:34:04,711 --> 00:34:06,922
Last year my brotherdid something really awful,

620
00:34:06,964 --> 00:34:09,091
and my parentscovered it up for him.

621
00:34:09,174 --> 00:34:10,926
If anyone were toever find out,

622
00:34:10,968 --> 00:34:13,554
andrew and my momcould go to jail.

623
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:17,558
So you don't have to worryabout me judging you.

624
00:34:17,683 --> 00:34:20,561
Tell me your secrets.I'll understand.

625
00:34:28,151 --> 00:34:29,736
Okay.

626
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,824
But you tell meyours first.

627
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,377
What are you doing here?

628
00:34:45,502 --> 00:34:49,381
I heard you werebeing transferred so I cameto say good-bye.

629
00:34:49,506 --> 00:34:51,592
Come to gloatis more like it.

630
00:34:51,633 --> 00:34:53,177
No,we've hadour differences,

631
00:34:53,218 --> 00:34:58,265
but that doesn't meanI'm happy to see you shipped off to alaska.

632
00:34:58,724 --> 00:35:00,809
Brr.

633
00:35:00,893 --> 00:35:02,895
You had something to dowith this,didn't you?

634
00:35:02,936 --> 00:35:05,981
Me? Oh,I'm justa humble sinner.

635
00:35:06,023 --> 00:35:08,525
You're the one withall the power around here--

636
00:35:08,525 --> 00:35:12,070
all the... annulment mojo.

637
00:35:12,112 --> 00:35:14,364
Is that why you did it?

638
00:35:16,366 --> 00:35:20,621
Well,getting rid of meisn't gonna change anything.

639
00:35:20,913 --> 00:35:23,123
Carlos will do what he wants.

640
00:35:23,165 --> 00:35:25,751
The problems in your marriagearen't going away.

641
00:35:25,792 --> 00:35:27,252
Maybe not...

642
00:35:28,462 --> 00:35:30,589
but you certainly are.

643
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:34,426
You missed a spot.

644
00:35:41,558 --> 00:35:43,519
That was a mistake.

645
00:35:48,398 --> 00:35:52,277
There.I think we're all done here.

646
00:36:13,799 --> 00:36:17,135
Oh,my god!Oh,my god! Hold on!

647
00:36:27,062 --> 00:36:28,814
Are you okay?

648
00:36:39,867 --> 00:36:41,702
Stop fighting!

649
00:36:43,537 --> 00:36:46,415
Stop fighting! No!

650
00:36:56,592 --> 00:36:58,802
What the hellwere you thinking?

651
00:36:59,303 --> 00:37:02,264
Uh,depends.What have you heard?

652
00:37:02,306 --> 00:37:04,057
I got a callfrom the church.

653
00:37:04,099 --> 00:37:05,726
They said you attackedsister mary.

654
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:07,686
Yeah,that's about right.

655
00:37:07,853 --> 00:37:08,854
What are you thinking?

656
00:37:08,896 --> 00:37:11,607
I wasn't,but I was thinkingabout it on the way over here.

657
00:37:11,648 --> 00:37:14,526
And I realized the assI should be kicking is yours.

658
00:37:14,568 --> 00:37:15,694
- Mine?
- Yes!

659
00:37:15,694 --> 00:37:19,323
Sister mary manipulated youinto threatening me,

660
00:37:19,364 --> 00:37:20,782
but you're the idiotthat fell for it.

661
00:37:20,824 --> 00:37:23,702
I was notthreatening you.

662
00:37:23,869 --> 00:37:26,079
I was asking for a promise.

663
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:27,873
You made me a promise,carlos,

664
00:37:27,956 --> 00:37:30,334
a long time ago--till death do us part.

665
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:34,505
And one day you just come homeand start throwing words around like annulment.

666
00:37:34,546 --> 00:37:36,256
How do you thinkthat makes me feel?

667
00:37:36,298 --> 00:37:38,550
Okay,I'm sorryabout that.

668
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,351
I need to have a child.

669
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:51,188
And I need to knowI'm the woman you want to spendthe rest of your life with,

670
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:54,024
not just some uterusin high heels.

671
00:37:54,066 --> 00:37:54,816
Gabrielle,please--

672
00:37:54,858 --> 00:37:56,401
no,carlos,I am sorry.

673
00:37:56,443 --> 00:37:59,655
I am not gonna be blackmailedinto giving birth.

674
00:38:02,366 --> 00:38:04,576
You have to choose.

675
00:38:04,868 --> 00:38:09,164
And I wish you would do itso I can move on with my life.

676
00:38:18,257 --> 00:38:20,425
Well,of course I choose you.

677
00:38:25,055 --> 00:38:27,558
I think that'sthe right decision.

678
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:35,399
You know,I made a decision,too.

679
00:38:39,236 --> 00:38:42,322
The answer to your questionearlier is yes.

680
00:38:42,447 --> 00:38:44,116
Yes...

681
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:47,119
I wanna have a baby.

682
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:54,334
I wanna havea baby with you.

683
00:39:17,608 --> 00:39:18,984
betty.

684
00:39:18,984 --> 00:39:20,527
What a surprise.

685
00:39:20,611 --> 00:39:22,779
Can I talk to youfor a moment?

686
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,742
Uh,now is actuallynot a good time for me.

687
00:39:26,783 --> 00:39:28,118
I think it is.

688
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:32,206
I wanted to chat with you before you didsomething foolish.

689
00:39:38,712 --> 00:39:41,340
I don't knowwhat you mean.

690
00:39:42,549 --> 00:39:45,219
The person you sawat my house today

691
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,012
is my other son.

692
00:39:47,054 --> 00:39:48,889
His name is caleb.

693
00:39:48,931 --> 00:39:50,516
He didn't harm gabrielle,

694
00:39:50,557 --> 00:39:52,434
and he didn't hurtthe man in the car trunk.

695
00:39:52,476 --> 00:39:54,144
That's all you need to know.

696
00:39:54,186 --> 00:39:55,812
He's your son?

697
00:39:55,854 --> 00:39:59,483
He's my dear sonwho happens to be slow.

698
00:39:59,525 --> 00:40:01,527
Sometimes he makes mistakes.

699
00:40:01,568 --> 00:40:03,695
But,betty,the policeare looking for him.

700
00:40:03,695 --> 00:40:07,324
He escaped from that facilitythey sent him to.

701
00:40:07,366 --> 00:40:09,993
He had help,trust me.

702
00:40:10,118 --> 00:40:12,621
I've always thoughtthe maternal instinct

703
00:40:12,621 --> 00:40:16,041
is one ofnature's most amazing gifts.

704
00:40:16,083 --> 00:40:20,796
I mean,the length thatsome mothers will go to to protect their children--

705
00:40:20,838 --> 00:40:25,008
it drives ordinary womento do extraordinary things,

706
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:29,012
women like me,bree,and like you.

707
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:30,973
What are you talking about?

708
00:40:31,306 --> 00:40:35,102
If you breathe one wordof caleb's existence to anyone,

709
00:40:35,143 --> 00:40:38,355
I will tell carlos,gabrielle and the police

710
00:40:38,397 --> 00:40:40,274
that it was your sondriving the car

711
00:40:40,315 --> 00:40:41,900
that killed juanita solis

712
00:40:41,942 --> 00:40:46,572
and that you have been coveringup his crime ever since.

713
00:40:49,032 --> 00:40:51,952
We're going to begreat friends,bree.

714
00:40:51,994 --> 00:40:54,496
We have so much in common.

715
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:57,624
So is that all she said?

716
00:40:57,666 --> 00:40:59,418
Yeah,something aboutthe applewhites.

717
00:40:59,459 --> 00:41:01,128
I'm dying of curiosity.

718
00:41:06,175 --> 00:41:08,844
it's rude to keeppeople waiting.

719
00:41:12,723 --> 00:41:14,266
Hi. Come on in.

720
00:41:14,308 --> 00:41:16,935
So,spill it.

721
00:41:17,102 --> 00:41:18,604
What's the scoopon the applewhites?

722
00:41:18,687 --> 00:41:21,190
Um,about that... um...

723
00:41:21,356 --> 00:41:23,275
oh,bree,come on,dish already!

724
00:41:23,317 --> 00:41:26,278
Well,perhaps I gotmore excited than I should have,

725
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:30,115
but I recently found outthat betty applewhite

726
00:41:30,157 --> 00:41:31,825
is quite the poker player,

727
00:41:31,825 --> 00:41:37,289
and so,uh,I have invited herto join our weekly game.

728
00:41:37,998 --> 00:41:39,583
Hello,everybody.

729
00:41:39,625 --> 00:41:44,213
I hope you broughtyour checkbooks because I am feeling lucky.

730
00:41:49,218 --> 00:41:53,597
Everyone understands the nature of war.

731
00:41:53,847 --> 00:41:55,057
I raise.

732
00:41:55,098 --> 00:41:58,560
We also understand that victory depends on the cards

733
00:41:58,602 --> 00:42:00,312
that we have been dealt.

734
00:42:00,354 --> 00:42:02,898
Some,when faced with a bloody battle,

735
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:05,025
simply give in.

736
00:42:05,067 --> 00:42:09,530
But for some,surrender is unacceptable.

737
00:42:09,571 --> 00:42:13,659
Well,bree,what are you gonna do?

738
00:42:13,867 --> 00:42:17,830
Even though they know it will be a fight...

739
00:42:18,205 --> 00:42:20,040
I'll raise you.

740
00:42:22,167 --> 00:42:24,294
...To the death.
