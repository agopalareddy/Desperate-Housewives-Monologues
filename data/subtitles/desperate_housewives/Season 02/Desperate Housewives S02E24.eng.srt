1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,600
This will sweep her
right off her feet.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,700
You dog. You're gonna ask
Susan to marry you, aren't you?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I didn't say that.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,300
<i>They say money can't buy love.</i>

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,900
My gift to you.
You bought us a house?

6
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,000
<i>...or even happiness.</i>

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,000
I have another child,

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,800
I only just found out about it.
I am not having an affair.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,700
<i>And it certainly can't ease</i>

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,300
You don't wanna have sex
with me?

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,700
Don't take it personally.

12
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,300
<i>a guilty conscience.</i>

13
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,100
See, That's why I can't give you
the keys to the kingdom, kid.

14
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,800
No balls.

15
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,300
Do I know you?

16
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,300
Orson Hodge.
Uh, Susan's dentist friend.

17
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,000
<i>The only thing that can bring new piece in your mind</i>

18
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,600
You, by any chance,
recognize the jacket?

19
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,700
That jacket belongs
to my other son.

20
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,500
<i>is to finding the truth</i>

21
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,200
we have to find them, 
and get Danielle back

22
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,600
<i>..and sending yourself free.</i>

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,200
- I am trying to leave,
and these morons won't let me

24
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,000
Bree, please, don't struggle.

25
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,200
Have they rung up
your prescription yet?

26
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,400
No, they're getting it
right now.

27
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,800
Good. Add that on.

28
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,200
You're dying your hair
honey wheat blond?

29
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,300
Oh, it's not for me.

30
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,200
It's for Danielle.

31
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,600
That hair is going back
to the color God intended.

32
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,900
You actually think
she's gonna sit still

33
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,900
as you towel this
through her hair?

34
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,400
Oh, I will tie her down
if necessary.

35
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm also thinking of checking
her body for piercings

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,600
While I'm at it.
- You're overreacting.

37
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,700
She's just going through
a phase.

38
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,600
That's what
girls her age do.

39
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,200
They also get pregnant
and become drug addicts.

40
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,900
And that color hair
is the gateway.

41
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,400
Would you please, uh,
add that to our bill?

42
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,900
I'm telling you, Bree,

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You're gonna have to
stop riding 'em so hard.

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,900
I am trying to ensure that they
turn into responsible adults.

45
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,400
Trust me, Rex,
in the end,

46
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,300
we will be rewarded.

47
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,900
How can you be so damn sure
of yourself all the time?

48
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,800
Why is my certainty a flaw?

49
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,300
I know what I'm about,
I know my values,

50
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,000
and I know what's right.

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Why shouldn't I stay
the course?

52
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,500
Am I right,
Mr. Williams?

53
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,100
My mother always took
a firm hand with me,

54
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,100
and I thank her for it.

55
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,100
Exactly, and look how well
you turned out.

56
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,600
Look, you're a good mother,
but there's a limit.

57
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,100
You have got to relinquish
some control,

58
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,100
or else
you're gonna regret it.

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,100
Excuse me.
Do you have the time?

60
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,300
Yeah, it's just after 8:00.
- Oh, I was afraid of that.

61
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,800
Afraid of what?

62
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,700
Well, I'm only supposed
to be restrained until 7:00.

63
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,100
You see, I have a problem
with sleepwalking.

64
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,500
They just tie me up
so that I don't wander off

65
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,000
and hurt myself.

66
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,900
Yeah, well, I'm sure a nurse
will be in here soon.

67
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,400
One can only hope.

68
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,800
Of course, if a doctor
gets here first

69
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,400
and sees that someone
forgot to release me,

70
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm sure they'd get
in a lot of trouble.

71
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,700
Lady, I can't let you
out of your restraints.

72
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,200
I'd get fired.

73
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,900
Oh. Well, I certainly would not
want that to happen.

74
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,500
What's your name?

75
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,700
Alfred.

76
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,600
Oh! Does anybody ever
call you "Alfie"?

77
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,200
No.

78
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,600
And why should they?

79
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,900
So, um, Alfred,

80
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,500
I was wondering if you could
maybe loosen my restraints.

81
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,300
They're incredibly tight,

82
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,800
and I'm sure
there are no rules

83
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,800
against making me
more comfortable.

84
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,300
Do you think I'm stupid?

85
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,000
I beg your pardon?

86
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,500
Two seconds after I loosen
these little restraints,

87
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,600
you'll try to scratch
my eyes out

88
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,300
and make a run for it.

89
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,100
Well, I'm not falling for it,
you psycho little bitch.

90
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,500
In fact, I hope they keep you
tied up for the next month.

91
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,000
'cause I'd get a real kick
out of watching

92
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
a prissy little whack job
like you

93
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
lying in your own filth.

94
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,500
Know what I mean?

95
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,900
Careful with those.

96
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,600
The last of the crystal.
- Okay.

97
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,700
Hey, what's going on?

98
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,200
Oh, hi.
Um, we're just moving.

99
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,200
Hey! It's the plumber.

100
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,800
You come over to help Susie
move into her new house?

101
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,100
New house?

102
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,200
Oh, she didn't tell you?
I bought a place for my girls.

103
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,200
You let him buy you
a house?

104
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,100
Uh, well,
he's not moving in with us.

105
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,900
After that speech about
wanting to go it alone,

106
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,900
and after I offered
to let you stay with me?

107
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,400
To be fair,
you just had a spare room,

108
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,100
and this is a whole house.

109
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,600
Hey, no offense,

110
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,700
if you're not using your back,
you're just in the way.

111
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,000
You saw me
buying that ring,

112
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,200
and you just had
to cut me off.

113
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,200
You bought me a ring?

114
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,200
Suze, let me handle this.

115
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,600
A man's gotta protect
his family.

116
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,200
Uh, Mike, about that ring...
- Put that box down.

117
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,400
What, you gonna hit me,
huh?

118
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,000
stop it! Oh, my...

119
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,300
What are you--
just stop it! Oh, that's enough!

120
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,700
Just get off! Get off! Go! Go!
Oh, my God.

121
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,900
What? Stop! That's enough.
Enough, enough. Back up.

122
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:35,300
And that ring--
that was for me, right?
- Not now.

123
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,100
oh, my...

124
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,700
Ohh!

125
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,900
Karl, are you okay?

126
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,200
Are you okay? Let me see.

127
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,400
Oh, my God.

128
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,100
Whew.

129
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,800
can you sit up?

130
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,400
whew.

131
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,800
Xiao-mei,
do you have a second?

132
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,800
This is probably silly,
but it's been bothering me.

133
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,100
When you said,
"Please don't kill him,"

134
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,500
did you mean Carlos?

135
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,300
Ralph dead, not Mr. Solis.

136
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:20,100
I know. It's just,
you said "kill," not "dead."

137
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,300
And I'd have to do be
pretty angry to kill someone,

138
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,300
so I guess my question is,

139
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,300
do I have a reason
to be angry at Mr. Solis?

140
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,100
Please, so much laundry.

141
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,700
Xiao-mei...

142
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,600
how did you rip
your panties?

143
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,500
I fall down.

144
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:02,400
Mr. Young, you'll need
to come up to the house

145
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,600
to sign
some legal documents.

146
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,000
What for?

147
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,500
Noah Taylor's will called
for an immediate transference

148
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,200
of his entire estate to you
upon his death.

149
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,300
So everything's mine?

150
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,000
That's correct.

151
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,100
Hi, Dad.

152
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:29,000
so, did you have
any luck with your grandfather?

153
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,000
Yeah, I talked to Noah.

154
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,000
He's not gonna give us
the money.

155
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,500
Damn it, Zach!
Sorry?

156
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,500
Go back and talk to him.

157
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,000
No, I-I don't think
he's gonna change his mind.

158
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,000
Terrific.
Am I gonna see you tomorrow?

159
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
No, I-I can't come tomorrow.

160
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,500
What about Monday?

161
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,500
Uh, next week's bad for me,
too.

162
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,100
I'll--I'll call you
when I know.
- Zach? Zach!

163
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,400
Is there anything I can do?

164
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,200
Yeah, get me a new phone
with a different number.

165
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,300
And fill in
this stupid lake.

166
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,700
Oh. Are you all right?

167
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:16,000
Uh, yeah. A little hopped up
on pain medicine, but, um,

168
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,500
I chipped my tooth
on the salad shooter.

169
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,500
Oh. Oh, you know,
you should, um,

170
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,700
call my friend Orson.

171
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,100
He's a dentist.

172
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,100
I'm sure he'll see you right away.
- Thanks.

173
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,300
So...

174
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,900
about that ring you bought--

175
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,700
Is there anything particular
you'd like to ask me?

176
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,900
Nope,
not as long Karl's got you

177
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,400
wrapped around his finger.

178
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,000
Okay, that's ridiculous.

179
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,400
Karl doesn't have me
wrapped around anything.

180
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,600
You accepted a house from him,
and you're nuts if you believe

181
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,600
he doesn't have
an ulterior motive.

182
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,600
He's Karl.
He's playing me.

183
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,100
But that house is gonna be
a great place

184
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,600
for my daughter to live.

185
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,600
And when he makes his move,

186
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,600
he's gonna realize that
<i>I</i> was really playing <i>him.</i></i>

187
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,600
So... about that ring...

188
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,100
I... I just don't want
to get deeper into this

189
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,600
and suddenly realize
your heart's somewhere else.

190
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:15,300
Mike, my heart is
in the exact right place.

191
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,700
Ugh. I can't have this conversation

192
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,100
now my tooth is throbbing.

193
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,800
Of course.

194
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,400
Okay.

195
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,500
You don't even wanna know
what my answer would have been?

196
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,100
Can we please
get out of here?

197
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,600
This place is gross.

198
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,500
And, God, I'm starving.

199
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,000
Yeah, I know, but we don't
have any money, remember?

200
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
That's why we should
go to my house.

201
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I know the combination
to my Mom's safe.

202
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Okay, I've told you
a thousand times,

203
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,500
It's way too risky. No.
- Something you should know before we embark

204
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,000
on this little adventure--

205
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,500
I can get pretty bitchy
when I'm not fed.

206
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,700
Listen, I hope
I'm not out of line here,

207
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,500
but did you ever spend
any time in prison?

208
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,300
What, you can tell
from my teeth?

209
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,200
Jailhouse dentistry--
unmistakable and not pretty.

210
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,200
Yeah, I did a little time
in Kansas a few years back.

211
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,200
Were you a prison dentist?

212
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,000
Uh, during dental school,
we did freebie work

213
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,900
on some of the poor guinea pigs
behind bars. No offense.

214
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,900
You know, I had the feeling
when I first saw you

215
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,700
In the movie theater
that we'd met before.
- I don't think so.

216
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,200
Oh, I'm pretty sure.
I think I know you.

217
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,000
Any chance I was
one of your guinea pigs?

218
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,700
No. the only prison work
I did was back in Virginia.

219
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,200
Diploma says you graduated
from Minnesota.

220
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,100
I'm licensed
in three states.

221
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,600
Open wide, please.

222
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,000
Don't talk.
I wouldn't want to hurt you.

223
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,700
Carlos, you promised
you'd come home today.

224
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,000
Well, I don't care
what Tanaka wants!

225
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,400
Rattling around
this stupid house all by myself

226
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,400
is not what I signed up for!

227
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,300
No, no, no, don't hang up on me.
I'm not done yelling at you!

228
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,900
Mrs. Solis.

229
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,400
How are you?

230
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,400
The best you've ever had.

231
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,600
What's so funny?

232
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,100
Me and my friend Justin
had this bet.

233
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,200
See who could lose
their virginity first

234
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,100
this summer at bible camp.

235
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,600
Guess I beat him
to the punch.

236
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,900
You were a virgin?

237
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,200
So it didn't show?

238
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,000
Uh, no.

239
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,500
No, I mean, I guess it was,
well, weird when

240
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,700
you started naming the American
presidents in order.

241
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,800
Ah, I wish you hadn't
heard that.

242
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,800
I was just trying to...

243
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,400
No, no, you were good.

244
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,300
Just, if it comes up in school,
Paul Revere was never president.

245
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:43,000
Oh. Thanks.

246
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,900
I, uh, had a really
awesome time, Mrs. Solis.

247
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,800
Well, good. I'm glad,

248
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,000
because this can
never happen again.

249
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Why?

250
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,800
The only reason I did this

251
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,000
was because I was angry
at Carlos.

252
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,700
Now, thanks to you,
I'm not angry anymore.

253
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,300
Well, you should be.
I mean, the guy's never around.

254
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,000
Hell, he's probably off having
his own affair right now.

255
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,200
Oh. 
I seriously doubt that.

256
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,200
How do you know?

257
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,200
Because Carlos doesn't have
an adulterous bone in his body.

258
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,200
What we just did
he could never do.

259
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:19,600
For him, sex isn't just sex.
It's a sign of intimacy.

260
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,800
It's the way he shows love.

261
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:26,500
You know, instead of
talking and listening

262
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,200
and spending time with me.

263
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,400
What was that for?

264
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,200
Thought you needed a kiss.

265
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,600
Well, since this is
our last time,

266
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,100
I guess we can make
the most of it.

267
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,100
So... you really trust him,
huh?

268
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,600
Completely.

269
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
<i>Like all good mothers,</i></i>

270
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,600
<i>Gabrielle had purchased several</i>
<i>top-of-the-line baby monitors.</i></i>

271
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,700
<i>She had planned to use them</i>
<i>to keep a close watch</i></i>

272
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,300
<i>on her newborn child.</i></i>

273
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:17,900
<i>That plan was about to change.</i></i>

274
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,900
So I'm gonna go shopping

275
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,700
and then I'm gonna see
my trainer,

276
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,200
and I'll definitely be gone
for, like, three hours.

277
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,300
Okay. Well, I gotta go.
Have fun.

278
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,500
<i> not later, Penny.</i></i>

279
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,100
<i>Mommy's gotta change you now</i>
<i>'cause you stink.</i></i>

280
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,300
<i> </i>
<i>Here, taste this.</i></i>

281
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,000
<i> Oh, man!</i></i>

282
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,900
<i>Xiao-mei,</i>
<i>that is amazing.</i></i>

283
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,200
<i>You like?</i></i>

284
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,800
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>
<i>Sorry if I'm making a mess.</i></i>

285
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:08,300
<i>It's okay. Mu shun pork</i>
<i>supposed to be messy.</i></i>

286
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,300
<i>I wish Gabrielle could</i>
<i>cook like this.</i></i>

287
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,300
<i>Have you ever tried</i>
<i>her enchiladas?</i></i>

288
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,500
<i>One time</i>
<i>they make me sick.</i></i>

289
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,200
Ugh. He will,
and he'll meet you

290
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,700
for a romantic
motor home rendezvous,

291
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,700
and you'll propose,
he'll accept,

292
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,200
and you'll both live
happily ever after.

293
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,700
You really think
that's what's gonna happen?

294
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,700
It's my deepest hope.

295
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,100
Oh, there he is.

296
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,900
We're in.

297
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,000
POLLY? THAT'S A GOOD NAME.

298
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
NO WAY.

299
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,500
PAMELA.

300
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,500
I said I wanted Penny.

301
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:16,900
Oh, Lynette...

302
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,800
eight hours
of grueling labor.

303
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,100
That's not fair.

304
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,700
Neither are stretch marks,
but what are you gonna do?

305
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,800
I've only known one Penny
in my whole life,

306
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,000
And she was a slut.
- Isn't your aunt named Penny?

307
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,700
Yeah, that's her.

308
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:35,200
Our daughter
is officially named.

309
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,800
You may go now.

310
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,400
All right,
I'll let you win this one,

311
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,900
but I get to name
the next one.

312
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,100
You promised me
we'd stop at four.

313
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,000
Remember?
You wanted four kids,

314
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,600
I wanted one, and somehow
we compromised on four.

315
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,600
Can we please stop now?

316
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,300
Lynette, you're hurting me.

317
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,100
I will stop
as soon as you promise.

318
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,400
Okay, I promise.

319
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,000
Okay.

320
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,600
Honey, I...
I didn't mean to upset ya.

321
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,800
It's just...

322
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,400
We've been so happy.

323
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,400
Sweetie, sometimes when
you're at work,

324
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,900
and I'm home alone
with three young boys,

325
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,900
I'm not so happy,

326
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
and now I'm gonna be alone
with four kids.

327
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,600
Each one is a blessing,
yes,

328
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,400
but I don't think I can
take any more... blessings.

329
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,000
More blessings could make me
lose my mind.

330
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,800
Do you understand?

331
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,200
Yeah.

332
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,500
Thank you.

333
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,800
Honey, that really hurt.

334
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,900
Did it hurt for eight hours?

335
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,600
No.

336
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,400
Okay, then.

337
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,100
I must have been crazy,
agreeing to this.

338
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,100
Honey, you're gonna feel
differently

339
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,600
once you meet Kayla.

340
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,600
She is sweet,
smart little girl,

341
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,600
plus it'll help you get past
your resentment of Nora.

342
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,600
I don't...

343
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,500
Well, here goes.

344
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,400
Hey, you!

345
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,700
You must be Lynette.
And you must be Nora.

346
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,700
I guess it'd be weird
if we hugged.

347
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,100
Probably.

348
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,200
Wh-where's Kayla?

349
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,700
Oh, she didn't come.

350
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,300
We got into this huge fight,
and I was, like...

351
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,700
I just couldn't stand
to look at her face

352
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,700
on that long plane trip, so I
dumped her at the neighbors'.

353
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,900
But, hey, come on,
you got me.

354
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,600
So, anyway,
Kayla is doing great.

355
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,300
She's so pretty.
She's so smart.

356
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,400
She's practically a star
on her soccer team.

357
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,500
I have the cutest picture.

358
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,500
You know,
we wouldn't need a picture

359
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,500
if you had actually
brought her like you promised.

360
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,800
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.

361
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,300
You know, but I just
haven't had much time

362
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,100
to get away on my own since,
um, I've been taking care

363
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,600
of your kid for
the past 11 years, Superdad!

364
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,600
Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

365
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,900
I know it's been hard.
You've done an amazing job.

366
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,900
Thank you. I think, so, too.
Apology accepted.

367
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,300
Anyway, I wasn't sure
that I wanted Kayla here

368
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,300
if we were gonna talk
about business.

369
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,800
Business?

370
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:43,800
I was hoping that we could
talk about child support

371
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,300
Since I've got, like,
11 years coming to me, right?

372
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,300
You never told me
I had a daughter.

373
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,900
My lawyer thinks
that I have a very good case.

374
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,400
We can't afford this.
We have four kids.

375
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,500
Tom just lost his job.
That'd bankrupt us.

376
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,000
I'm the bad guy now
when he's the one

377
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,900
that knocked me up
and abandoned his child?

378
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,200
How could he abandon her if
he didn't even know she existed?

379
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,300
That doesn't let him
off the hook.

380
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,100
You know, you better do right
by me unless, of course,

381
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,100
you wanna be known
as Mrs. Deadbeat Dad!

382
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,200
Just take it easy.

383
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,000
Are we just gonna keep
talking louder?

384
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,300
Is that the plan?

385
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,300
You wanna just keep
raising your voice

386
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,400
'cause that's how you get
what you want, right?

387
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,200
You make a scene,
you throw a tantrum,

388
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,300
and everyone gets scared
and backs off.

389
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,900
Well, I don't work that way,
lady.

390
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,400
I don't care that my husband
was so phenomenally stupid

391
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,200
and/or drunk to actually
have sex with you.

392
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,700
I'm not gonna let it ruin
my life.

393
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,600
Am I talking loud enough

394
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,400
for that to get through to you?

395
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,200
I'm just gonna pay
the bill.

396
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,600
Karl, we've been through
a lot together.

397
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,100
We will always be connected
by Julie,

398
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,600
but... I know why
you bought me that house,

399
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,600
And I'm not moving into it.

400
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,400
Susie, come on, I--

401
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,400
Karl, we are not
getting back together.

402
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:11,200
Not ever. You need to just stop
and realize that it's over.

403
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,100
I'm gonna marry Mike.

404
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,300
So I need you
to sign these

405
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,000
because I have to be
divorced first.

406
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,300
Mike popped the question

407
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,000
No. He was going to, but then
you clocked him in the mouth

408
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,400
with a salad shooter,
remember?

409
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,100
Actually, I'm going to pop
the question to him

410
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,900
tomorrow night.

411
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,900
Guess it cuts down
on the suspense

412
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,000
knowing he bought you
a ring.

413
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,200
You would think so,
but, no, it doesn't.

414
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,600
This is a lot to ask

415
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,100
for a man
who still loves you, Susie.

416
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,500
I know.

417
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,500
But if you really do...
love me,

418
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,200
you'll let me go.

419
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,100
Okay, Susie.
I can do that.

420
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Well, you know where to find me
if it doesn't work out.

421
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,600
Oh, shut up.

422
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,400
I don't see another way
to make this work.

423
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,300
We've gotta dip
into the pensions.

424
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,300
Oh, I don't like
the sound of that.

425
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,600
Well, it's that
or the kids' college fund.

426
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,700
We'll write Nora
one big check,

427
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,100
and in return,
she'll sign away her claim

428
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,100
for the back child support.

429
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,200
If we're lucky, she'll take
the bird in the hand.

430
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,300
Okay, what are we
talking about? How much?

431
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,700
Well, we need to show her
we're serious.

432
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,300
$30,000?

433
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,500
Are you kidding? $30,000?
If she takes you to court,

434
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,600
we'll lose
and end up paying

435
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,500
11 years of child support
all at once.

436
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,500
We could lose the house.

437
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,700
Oh, we are screwed.
We are just plain screwed.
- Tom!

438
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,500
I am trying very hard
to be strong right now,

439
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,000
and you melting down
is not helping me.

440
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,900
I'm sorry.

441
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,900
I know we're using up
a huge chunk of our savings,

442
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,100
but if it keeps that crazy woman
out of our life,

443
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,800
it is the best money
we have ever spent.

444
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,800
We will be okay.

445
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,200
Hey there.

446
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,800
I was surprised to hear
you wanted a session.

447
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,300
Well, there's nothing like
being tied to a bed

448
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,900
to change a girl's mind.

449
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,700
What do you wanna
talk about?

450
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,200
Anything at all.

451
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:35,300
As you said, I...
I have a lot of issues.

452
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,400
Well, I assumed as much

453
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,400
when you told
the ridiculous story

454
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,300
about your daughter
running off with a murderer.

455
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,800
Saw right through that,
did ya?

456
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,300
Well, I'm a trained
professional, Bree.

457
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:51,100
The human mind
is my playground.

458
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,500
Well, I'm glad
that you're having fun.

459
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,500
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to be flip.

460
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,300
But you came here
because you were troubled,

461
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:03,000
and then you refuse
any help we give you.

462
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,300
Things were falling apart
at home, and I just...

463
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:09,900
I just needed a place
to rest, that's all.

464
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,600
I think there's more to it
than that.

465
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,600
Do you?

466
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,900
I think it has to do
with your kids.

467
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:19,100
You don't want to talk
about them.

468
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,600
Why is that?

469
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:25,000
Probably because
I'm ashamed.

470
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,000
Ashamed?

471
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
My children were my life.

472
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,600
They were the reason that
I got up in the morning,

473
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,600
So to have failed them
as a parent...

474
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,500
You think you failed them
as a parent?

475
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,900
Well, my son is a sociopath,

476
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,900
and my daughter hates me enough
to have run away from home.

477
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,700
I'm certainly not gonna get

478
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:45,000
"Mother of the Year" anytime soon.
- If your kids were here right now,

479
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
what would you tell them?
- I would beg my son Andrew
for forgiveness

480
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
for having given up on him,

481
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,500
and I would tell my daughter
not to worry,

482
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,500
that I have a plan
to protect her.

483
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:58,200
And just what is that plan?

484
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I've got everything
ready to go--

485
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,500
flowers, candles,
Elvis Costello CD all cued up.

486
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,000
But who has the ring?
- He does.

487
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,100
So, wait, you're gonna get
down on one knee,

488
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,300
pop the question,
and while you're down there,

489
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,300
dig in his pocket?

490
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,300
Then I'm gonna have to find
a way to force it on my finger.

491
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,500
<i> Oh, Xiao-mei, where'd</i>
<i>you learn to kiss like that?</i></i>

492
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,400
Sorry,
that's Penny's baby monitor.

493
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,100
It's always picking up weird frequencies.
- No, no, no! Don't turn it off.

494
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:05,300
<i>Ohh! move over.</i>
<i>My knees hit the dashboard.</i></i>

495
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:09,400
<i> </i>
<i>I move seat back. Better?</i></i>

496
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,700
<i>Oh, yeah.</i></i>

497
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,600
Are you done
with my husband?

498
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,400
Good.

499
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,700
I have a little project
for you.

500
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,500
Okay, Gaby, can we please
talk about this?!

501
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,500
You're the one that gave me
permission, remember?

502
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,300
You said, "Go have sex with somebody"!

503
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,000
To have meaningless sex,
Carlos,

504
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,500
not to sleep with the woman
who's carrying our child!

505
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,900
What is the matter?!
Look, we're even!

506
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,200
You had an affair,
and I had an affair!

507
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,700
I had a reason to.
You were never here!

508
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,200
I've been here, Carlos.

509
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:27,100
I have tried so hard
to not be selfish

510
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,100
and to put your needs
above mine.

511
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,100
I mean, for God sakes,
look at me!

512
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,600
I have agreed to be
a mother for you!

513
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,100
Look, Gaby, you have
every right to be mad at me.

514
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,900
So I'm gonna go
and check into a hotel room

515
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:42,000
and let you cool down, but we
<i>are</i> going to work this out.</i>

516
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,500
Forget the hotel, Carlos.
Get a lease.

517
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,300
I can go now, too?

518
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,900
No, you can start dinner.

519
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
What?!

520
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,400
You're not going anywhere,

521
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,600
not as long as you have
my baby in your belly.

522
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,400
I don't know what that meant,
but I didn't like the tone.

523
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,900
So just remember,
am the boss of you,

524
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
or else
I'm gonna make this

525
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,700
the worst nine months
of your life.

526
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,400
Hi.
- Hi.

527
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,700
Did you get the check?

528
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,200
Yeah, I wanted to talk
to you about that.

529
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,200
Do you have a minute?

530
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,200
Tom?!

531
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,300
I'm not the type of person

532
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,000
that can keep things
bottled up inside.

533
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,600
Really?
- So I'm just gonna have
to get this off my chest.

534
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,100
You made me feel really bad
about myself

535
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,400
yesterday at the restaurant.

536
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,500
My sincerest apologies.

537
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,000
You treated me
like some sort of mercenary,

538
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
like the only reason
I came here

539
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,600
was to extort money from you.

540
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,100
Well, to be honest,
first, we bought you pie,

541
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,300
then you tried
to extort money from us.

542
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:12,700
See? There it is again,
Lynette--that mean streak.

543
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,900
All I want is what's best for my child,

544
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,200
for Tom's child.

545
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,700
As the mother of 80%
of Tom's children,

546
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,200
I don't think
it's in their best interest

547
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,000
for you to drive us
into bankruptcy.
- Of course it isn't.

548
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,700
Here.

549
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,300
I signed the waiver

550
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:34,000
that the lawyer sent over
with the check.

551
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,200
And I'm not even asking
for any back child support.

552
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,400
That's--that's--that's great.
Thank you.

553
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,700
See, Lynette? See?
It's not all about money.

554
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:49,300
It's not even a little bit
about money. It's about family.

555
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,500
'cause we're all
a big family now.

556
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,900
Sort of.

557
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:58,100
Which is why I took
all the money that you gave me,

558
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,100
and I put it all down

559
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,600
on the sweetest little
2-bedroom house

560
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:06,500
over on Arden Drive.

561
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,500
Ar-Arden Drive over--
over by the mall?

562
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,800
Like, five minutes
from here Arden Drive?

563
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,100
It's perfect. I could drop
Kayla off here anytime

564
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,500
so she can play
with her new siblings.

565
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,400
She can spend time
with her Dad.

566
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,400
Well, to be clear,
how are you going to live?

567
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,700
How are you going to pay
the mortgage?

568
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,900
You don't have a job here.
- What is your problem
with me, lady?!

569
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,700
I don't understand!
You don't know me.

570
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,400
You don't know what I can do.

571
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,200
And yet you just always,
just...

572
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,000
just--just...

573
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,500
Always on the attack. It's ugly,
and you should work on that.

574
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,900
Here's what I think.

575
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,800
I think that we should
all work on this,

576
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,800
because I don't want
every Christmas to turn ugly

577
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,800
just because you and I
don't get along.

578
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:59,500
Yeah, that would be a shame.

579
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,900
See, I told you
she wasn't home.

580
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,500
Her car's not even here.

581
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,100
And you said the safe
was upstairs?

582
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,300
Damn it, my mother must have
changed the combination.

583
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:12,600
Okay. Wait here.
I'll be right back.

584
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,000
You did it.

585
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,400
You killed Melanie.

586
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,000
You put your jacket
on her body.

587
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:41,800
I saw it, Matthew.

588
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,500
The police showed me
the pictures.

589
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,200
Now you weren't there.
You don't know what happened.

590
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,500
Oh, God.

591
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,800
Caleb hurt her,

592
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,600
and Melanie threatened to bring
us all down because of that.

593
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,000
So your solution was to make
your brother think

594
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,400
he murdered a girl
and to make <i>me</i> think it?</i>

595
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,000
What other choice did I have?

596
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,700
I knew that you wouldn't
had Caleb over to the police.

597
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,700
I knew that
you would protect him.

598
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,300
I would have protected you.

599
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,200
Well, I really couldn't
count on that.

600
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,700
Matthew...

601
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:13,000
you don't love me
as much as you love Caleb.

602
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,600
You never have.

603
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,900
Perhaps.

604
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,700
But it's because
he's needed me more.

605
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:24,800
You are always going to
find love in the world.

606
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,600
Don't you understand?

607
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:30,100
He was only ever
going to get it from me.

608
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,500
You know,
I know you believe that.

609
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,400
That's why I've tried
so hard to forgive you.

610
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,700
And who knows?

611
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,600
Maybe one day I will.

612
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:03,100
9-1-1.
- What is your emergency?

613
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,700
I need the police.

614
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,000
See, I told you
she had cash.

615
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,700
Danielle, I don't know
what you're planning,

616
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,600
but I need to talk to you
right now.

617
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,600
Give it up, Mom.
We're leaving.

618
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,200
I'm calling the police.

619
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,000
Do you remember
that girl Melanie Foster?

620
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,800
Matthew is the one
who killed her.

621
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,300
I know you don't want us
to be together,

622
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,600
but that's the lamest thing
I've ever heard.

623
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,400
His mother told me
what happened. It's true.

624
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,500
Let's go, Danielle.

625
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,400
Mom, please move.

626
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,400
No.
I gave up on your brother,

627
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,200
and I'm not gonna make
that mistake with you.

628
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:30,700
We don't have time for this.

629
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:34,400
Where did you get that?
What are you doing?!

630
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,900
Move away!

631
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,500
Danielle...

632
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,700
I want you to get out
of the house now.

633
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,700
He's a killer.
- Shut up!

634
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,300
Don't point that
at my mother!

635
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,900
Danielle!

636
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,600
I'm serious. Go.

637
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,100
What's wrong with you?!

638
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,800
I'm gonna shoot you!

639
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,600
Matthew, stop it!

640
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,800
If that's what it takes...

641
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,300
to get my daughter...

642
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:09,300
Stop it!
- To see who you really are...

643
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,000
Stop pointing that
at my mother!

644
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,300
Then fine.

645
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:18,000
What are you doing?!
Do it.

646
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,700
Stop!

647
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,600
It's okay, baby.

648
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,200
Hey, it's just me again.
Um...

649
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,200
When you got the invitation,

650
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,800
I thought that you gave me
the thumbs up,

651
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:15,400
but I guess
if that was actually...

652
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:19,100
some other type
of finger gesture, uh...

653
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:22,600
well, I apologize for leaving
you all these messages

654
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:26,000
and wasting your time.

655
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:12,500
<i>This is the street</i>
<i>where I used to live...</i></i>

656
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,300
<i>and these were the people</i>
<i>with whom I shared my life.</i></i>

657
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,400
<i>I met them the day</i>
<i>they moved in.</i></i>

658
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:29,000
<i>And I saw</i>
<i>what they brought with them...</i></i>

659
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:35,900
<i>beautiful dreams</i>
<i>for the future.</i></i>

660
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,700
<i>And quiet hopes</i>
<i>for a better life...</i></i>

661
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:48,400
<i>not just for themselves,</i>
<i>but for their children, too.</i></i>

662
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,700
<i>If I could, would I tell them</i>
<i>what lies ahead?</i></i>

663
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:57,600
<i>Would I warn them
of the sorrow and betrayal</i>

664
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:01,200
<i>that lie in store?</i></i>

665
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:04,600
<i>No. From where I stand now,</i></i>

666
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:07,100
<i>I see enough of the road</i>
<i>to understand</i></i>

667
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:11,200
<i>how it must be traveled.</i></i>

668
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:15,200
<i>The trip</i>
<i>is to keep moving forward,</i></i>

669
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,700
<i>to let go of the fear</i>
<i>and the regret</i></i>

670
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,400
<i>that slow us down</i></i>

671
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,900
<i>and keep us from enjoying</i>
<i>a journey</i></i>

672
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,800
<i>that will be over too soon.</i></i>

673
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:32,100
<i>Yes, there will be</i>
<i>unexpected bends in the road,</i></i>

674
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:36,800
<i>shocking surprises</i>
<i>we didn't see coming,</i></i>

675
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,800
<i>but that's really the point...</i></i>

676
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,300
<i>don't ya think?</i></i>

677
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,100
Orson.
- Oh, hey.

678
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,600
I wanted to come by
and see how you were doing

679
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,600
after your great escape,
and, uh, these are for you.

680
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:53,200
How sweet
and... unexpected.

681
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,100
Do you wanna come in?

682
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,400
I'd love to.
