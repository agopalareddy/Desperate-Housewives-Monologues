00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,380
previously on...

3
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:07,549
you're awfully brave buying 
place site unseen.

4
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:08,842
We could tell from the advertisement
 it was just what

5
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:11,220
<i>we were looking for. 
Sometimes...</i></i>

6
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,222
who ever said you were the father?

7
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:16,016
Didn't you think it was strange that 
you have the only lawn on wisteria lane

8
00:00:16,058 --> 00:00:17,893
that needed to be mowed 
three times a week?

9
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:20,062
I am going to kill you!

10
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,688
The truth about our loved ones...

11
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,732
you asked peterson's wife to make 
sure he wouldn't promote me

12
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:25,859
so I quit. I'm gonna 
be a stay-at-home dad.

13
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:27,861
We should... talk about this.

14
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:28,904
You're goin' back to work.

15
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:31,490
Can lead you into harm's way.

16
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:32,824
I think I'm having a heart attack.

17
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,994
You are gonna come through 
this operation just fine.

18
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:36,995
Hello?

19
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,873
Rex passed away about 
ten minutes ago.

20
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:41,834
I'm so sorry.

21
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,794
Mr. Delfino took my 
dad away to kill him.

22
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:46,463
Now I'm gonna kill mr. Delfino.

23
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:53,554
<i>It was an accepted fact among 
the residents of Wisteria Lane</i></i>

24
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:57,516
<i>that Ida Greenberg liked her liquor.</i></i>

25
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:01,311
<i>People had seen her 
drunk at sewing bees...</i></i>

26
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:05,065
<i>the department of motor vehicles...</i></i>

27
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:09,111
<i>and the first methodist church.</i></i>

28
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:13,782
<i>Ida had tried to quit 
drinking many times,</i></i>

29
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:15,409
<i>but she couldn't.</i></i>

30
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,245
<i>Then one night in
 a moment of despair,</i></i>

31
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:20,247
<i>she challenged god</i></i>

32
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:23,959
<i>to quench her never-ending thirst.</i></i>

33
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,756
<i>Luckily for Ida,
 God was listening.</i></i>

34
00:01:56,408 --> 00:01:59,161
Zach, listen to me.

35
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,705
No!

36
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,509
Not so tough now,are you?

37
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:16,595
Uh! Ow! Oh! Bongo,no!

38
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:19,598
Bongo!Bongo!

39
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:32,736
<i>It was at that moment 
it occurred to Ida</i></i>

40
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:35,948
<i>God may work in mysterious ways,</i></i>

41
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,451
<i>but he isn't particularly subtle.</i></i>

42
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,375
<i>It had been a year since my death,</i></i>

43
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:32,087
<i>and a lot had changed
 on Wisteria Lane.</i></i>

44
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:36,967
<i>children had learned new games.</i></i>

45
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:42,806
<i>New neighbors had moved in.</i></i>

46
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,727
<i>Old houses had been rebuilt...</i></i>

47
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:47,978
I told you guys twice.

48
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,396
Okay, Craig,what's goin' on?

49
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:52,441
<i>And fresh tragedies had occurred.</i></i>

50
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:54,735
<i>In one house,</i></i>

51
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:59,323
<i>a widow was getting ready to tell her
 friends of her husband's passing.</i></i>

52
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,617
<i>But until the time was right,</i></i>

53
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,744
<i>she would wait.</i></i>

54
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:06,663
<i>And life,as it tends to do,</i></i>

55
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,707
<i>would go on.</i></i>

56
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,835
I look like hell. I need a hairbrush.

57
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:15,047
Yeah, um, that's not gonna help.

58
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:18,008
Susan,

59
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:21,053
officer Romslove is 
here for your statement.

60
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,638
Zach young do that?

61
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:26,016
No. She fell. Bit her lip.
It was an accident.

62
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:27,267
Okay.

63
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,603
So,uh,walk me through what happened.

64
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:32,064
well, I went over to
 mike's to feed the dog.

65
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,900
- I'm sorry?
- Feed the dog.

66
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,319
and I turned around,

67
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:38,695
and there was Zach young--

68
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:40,781
and that's Zach with an "h"--

69
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:43,534
- pointing a gun at me.
- The doctor said keep that in.

70
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:45,786
You gotta understand, 
Zach's had a tough time.

71
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,664
- He's got emotional issues--
- 'cause he's crazy.

72
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,749
Still, I don't think he
 meant to hurt anybody.

73
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:54,628
Uh,hello! Uh,he was waiting 
there for you to come home

74
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,046
so he could kill you.

75
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:57,589
Is that what happened
 when you got home?

76
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:58,799
The kid took a shot at you?

77
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:00,300
Actually, Susan fired the gun.

78
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:03,512
That's because I was 
wrestling it away from Zach

79
00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:06,139
so that he wouldn't shoot you.

80
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,226
Oh,there's blood.

81
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:12,229
Could we do this later?
She's kind of a mess right now.

82
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:14,106
Yeah, I think I can fill
 in the rest for you.

83
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,482
I'd appreciate it.

84
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:18,193
- You feel better, mrs. Mayer.
- Thanks.

85
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:22,865
Ow! That hurts.

86
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:25,492
- I'm gonna get you more ice.
- Okay.

87
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,327
No,I'm tellin' you.

88
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:30,038
Susan really flew off the handle 
when she jumped the kid.

89
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,291
So you're saying this was 
more of a domestic squabble?

90
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,709
Definitely, yeah.

91
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:35,878
Are we required to press charges?

92
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,421
Well,you're not really required,

93
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:42,301
but it's something you should really 
consider when a handgun is involved.

94
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:06,366
John!

95
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:09,953
- How did you get in here?
- I know where you keep the key.

96
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:13,415
- Mimosa?
- No, I'm pregnant, you jackass.

97
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:14,875
I made yours with seltzer.

98
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:16,793
Do you have any idea what you've done?

99
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:18,253
That little stunt you pulled 
yesterday in the courtroom

100
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:21,673
could get carlos sent 
away for eight years.

101
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:24,301
Yeah,I thought you might 
be a little mad about that.

102
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:26,386
But once you calm down,

103
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:28,722
you'll see that it's just the two of us.

104
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:30,891
It's gonna be awesome.

105
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:34,853
you brought luggage?

106
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:37,481
He's gone. We don't have
 to sneak around anymore.

107
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:39,858
We can have a real relationship.

108
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,693
It's what's best for the three of us.

109
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:45,489
The three of us? How exactly
 does that benefit Carlos?

110
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:48,075
- I'm talking about my baby.
- You don't know it's your baby.

111
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,618
I don't even know it's your baby.

112
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,079
And I don't wanna know
 'cause it doesn't matter.

113
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:57,334
so what,you don't love me?

114
00:06:57,376 --> 00:07:00,254
Well, up until the point that you told 
my husband we were having an affair,

115
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:01,630
I was quite fond of you.

116
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:03,507
Since then...

117
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,175
not a fan!

118
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:12,474
Hey.

119
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:13,600
hey.

120
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:18,272
Oh,why on earth would you let them 
finger paint before breakfast?

121
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:23,235
It's my job to clean that up
 now, so it's my call, right?

122
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,196
You're right. I'm sorry.

123
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:27,698
Hey, I thought the 
meeting wasn't until 1.

124
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:30,492
Oh, I have a thousand things
 to do before that--

125
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:32,619
borrow a decent scarf from bree,

126
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,371
buy a lipstick I don't hate--

127
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:36,081
- mommy, mommy, look!
- Aah! No! No!

128
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:37,708
No, nobody touches mommy, okay?

129
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,710
I love you, I love your finger painting,

130
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,336
but if you touch me with
 those messy hands,

131
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:42,546
I will cut them off.

132
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:44,715
Go on. Off. Good.

133
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:46,175
It's okay.

134
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:48,844
- A little nervous?
- Who, me?

135
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:50,554
I've been out of work for seven years,

136
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:54,433
I'm a woman of a certain age in a business
 that values youth above all else.

137
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:58,020
- Why should I be nervous?
- You are experienced.

138
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,313
You are brilliant.

139
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:03,192
You are going to nail 
this job interview, okay?

140
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,902
Thank you. Uh, no. I can't...

141
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:07,279
you're very... so...

142
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:09,198
Thank you. Here.

143
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:13,285
Oh, my cell phone.

144
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,848
Lynette, hi, it's Bree.

145
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,226
I do hope I'm not calling too early.

146
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:38,769
Hmm?

147
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:40,646
Oh, of course you
 can borrow that scarf.

148
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,439
I'll press it for you.

149
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,775
Um, I have, uh, some news.

150
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:46,902
Rex died.

151
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:51,323
I thought they were gonna 
operate. What happened?

152
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:55,035
Apparently rex's heart just gave out.

153
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:57,079
Oh, my god.

154
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,580
So when can we see Bree?

155
00:08:58,622 --> 00:08:59,957
She said she was gonna call.

156
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,209
She's gotta lot of things to do,

157
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:05,379
planning for the funeral,
 that sort of thing.

158
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,006
She doesn't look that busy to me.

159
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:16,306
Hi, hi. What are you doing out here?

160
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,517
Oh, I'm just waiting for, 
uh, Rex's mother.

161
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,185
She's gonna be here any second.

162
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:22,646
Honey, we are so sorry.

163
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:25,607
Oh, do one of you drink soy milk?

164
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:27,025
I was cleaning out the
 fridge this morning,

165
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,820
and Rex is the only
 one who drinks it.

166
00:09:29,862 --> 00:09:33,574
I just bought it on friday.
I'd hate to throw it away.

167
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:37,703
What a waste.

168
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,497
Oh, sweetie.

169
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:42,291
Honey, you can let it out.

170
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,626
No. No, I can't afford 
to fall apart right now.

171
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:46,378
Why?

172
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,547
You're about to find out.

173
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:51,884
Bree!

174
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,261
Oh, stop here. This is the house.

175
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:55,637
Is that...

176
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:58,724
yes, that is Rex's mother.

177
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:08,108
I can't believe it.

178
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,694
It's like some hideous nightmare.

179
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:12,779
My life is over!

180
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:15,824
My life is over!

181
00:10:31,215 --> 00:10:35,636
it appears there's a 7-year 
gap since your last position.

182
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:37,638
What, did you take some time off?

183
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,723
I was a stay-at-home mom.

184
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:41,975
I wish it had been time off.

185
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,895
- Boy or girl?
- A girl...

186
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,814
- and three boys.
- Four kids?

187
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,733
Yeah, of course, they won't 
get in the way of the job

188
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:53,904
because my husband's staying 
home with them from now on.

189
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:58,200
I knew I could never do
 both jobs justice.

190
00:10:58,242 --> 00:11:01,495
That's why I choose not 
to have a family.

191
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,664
I didn't want to be one of
 those kind of women--

192
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:07,084
you know, sloughing things
 off onto coworkers

193
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:10,712
because of a pediatrician 
appointment or a dance recital.

194
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:15,092
I get really neurotic about
 putting people out.

195
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:18,804
With all due respect,
 Nina, won't be an issue.

196
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:20,347
I can leave home at home.

197
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:23,851
And it's not gonna break your heart
to leave those sad little faces behind?

198
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:25,894
are you kidding?

199
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:27,729
This office is paradise--

200
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:30,440
grown-ups talking about
 grown-up things.

201
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:33,777
No screaming, no vomiting,
 no boogers under the table.

202
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:36,738
You're gonna have to drag me outta
 here kicking and screaming--

203
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,992
weekends, holidays, whenever.

204
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:44,329
All right, Ed wants to make 
the final decision.

205
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:48,709
So I will bring you back
 tomorrow at 3 for a follow-up.

206
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,878
Well,that--that sounds 
great. Thank you--

207
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:54,339
Lynette, be early.
 Show me something.

208
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,925
Okay.

209
00:11:57,926 --> 00:12:00,053
No way. Dad did not
 have a teddy bear.

210
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,763
He most certainly did.

211
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:03,974
Oh, that was Doolittle.

212
00:12:04,016 --> 00:12:06,768
Your father never went
 anywhere without him.

213
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,566
Here's your tea, Phyllis.

214
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:16,486
Look, Bree.

215
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:20,866
This was the tie that Rex wore
when he graduated from prep school.

216
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:24,119
I think he should wear it.

217
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:26,955
You know, for the funeral?

218
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:29,500
Phyllis, that's an orange tie.

219
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,877
Well, those were his school 
colors--green and orange.

220
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:36,048
Well, um, he's being 
buried in a blue suit.

221
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:40,719
maybe he could be buried 
in a different suit.

222
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:43,805
I don't think so, 
but thank you, though.

223
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:47,643
You, uh, you kept dad's 
old comic books?

224
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,895
Oh, yes, I kept everything.

225
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:51,522
Look here.

226
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:58,320
I even kept the dirty magazine
that he hid under his mattress.

227
00:12:58,654 --> 00:13:02,616
He didn't think I knew
 about it, but I did.

228
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,328
well, looks like dad was
 into big breasts.

229
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,496
Oh, yes.

230
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:11,166
That's why I was surprised 
when he married your mother.

231
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,845
So you're just not gonna talk 
to me, is that it?

232
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,723
Fine.

233
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:29,977
I don't need to talk.

234
00:13:34,398 --> 00:13:36,733
Okay. Yes, I had a little affair.

235
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:39,236
It wasn't the best thing to do,
 and I'm not proud of it.

236
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:40,696
But it's not the worst thing 
that could have happened.

237
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,948
Nobody died.

238
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:46,326
Oh, don't be such a martyr, Carlos.

239
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:48,745
Okay, it takes two people.

240
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:50,873
How many times did you go off 
on your little business trips

241
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:52,749
and leave me alone?

242
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,085
See, so technically,
 you cheated, too.

243
00:13:55,127 --> 00:13:58,130
It's just your mistress 
was your work.

244
00:13:58,172 --> 00:14:00,507
No, okay. That was a stretch.
 I'm sorry.

245
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:04,595
Carlos, wait! Come back.
 Look, I wanna start over.

246
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:06,471
We're gonna have a baby.

247
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:09,308
Isn't that what you always wanted?

248
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:10,893
Carlos, wait!

249
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:13,061
I said I was sorry and I love you!

250
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:15,772
What more do you want?!

251
00:14:16,315 --> 00:14:19,610
I want a paternity test.

252
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:28,035
Mrs. Applewhite, hi.

253
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:29,912
I am Bree Van de Kamp,

254
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:32,331
and this is my daughter Danielle.

255
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,707
- Hello.
- Hi.

256
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:35,834
- Hey, I'm Matthew. 
- This is my son.

257
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:39,213
Hi. I would have been oversooner 
to introduce myself,

258
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:42,716
but I'm afraid there's been
 a death in my family.

259
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:43,717
My dad.

260
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:45,969
- I'm so sorry. 
- I lost my dad, too.

261
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:48,263
I know what you must be 
going through right now.

262
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:49,139
Thank you.

263
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:52,643
Anyway, I'm afraid that my visit
 has an ulterior motive.

264
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:55,062
The organist at our churchis
 on vacation,

265
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:58,815
and Edie Britt mentioned that you
 used to be a concert pianist, and--

266
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:00,817
I would be honored to play for you.

267
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:02,778
Why don't I bring some
 sheet music over later

268
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,446
and we can plan some selections?

269
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:08,367
Thank you. That's just a huge
 weight off my shoulders.

270
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:12,412
- Oh,these are for you.
- How sweet.

271
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:17,251
Bree, we widows 
have to stick together.

272
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,212
Bye.

273
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,514
Pretending your father's dead?

274
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:32,140
Don't you find that a little morbid?

275
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:33,934
Well, I just thought it could
 help our cover story, okay?

276
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:36,311
Just, you know, win 'em over.

277
00:15:38,564 --> 00:15:42,693
Oh, sweetie. I know you meant well.

278
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:47,239
But in the future, you leave
 the cleverness to me.

279
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:57,457
Since when are we protected 
by dorset security?

280
00:15:57,499 --> 00:16:00,544
Oh, we're not. It's a deterrent
 in case Zach comes back.

281
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:03,672
I told mike I didn't sleep last 
night, so he got me this sign.

282
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:05,090
That guy is so supportive.

283
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:08,677
You know he's out right now in a ride-along
 with the police searching for Zach?

284
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:10,095
- Really?
- Yeah.

285
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:13,056
He's determined to see that 
kid behind bars.

286
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:15,017
So tomorrow at school I want 
you to let everybody know

287
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:17,227
that we got this new, 
expensive security system.

288
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:19,146
- Mom, just--
- work it into the conversation.

289
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:20,939
- You know, put the word out there
- I've gotta tell you something.

290
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:23,984
- Emphasize the motion detectors.
- Mom, stop, stop. Listen.

291
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:25,819
What? What is it?

292
00:16:25,861 --> 00:16:28,405
Yesterday I overheard mike 
telling that cop

293
00:16:28,447 --> 00:16:31,408
that he didn't wanna press
 charges against Zach.

294
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:33,744
He made the whole thing sound
 like it was your fault.

295
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:35,662
My fault?

296
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:47,299
Hi. Uh, I need a paternity test.

297
00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:49,426
Well, we'll just schedule 
you for an exam.

298
00:16:49,468 --> 00:16:52,763
Oh, no, no. I-I don't
 need to take a test.

299
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:59,603
I am just trying to reassure my husband 
of what I know is true in my heart.

300
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:02,814
So if you could just slip me 
someone else's test results,

301
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:04,149
I could make my own.

302
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:06,944
I got photoshop for christmas.

303
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:10,739
Oh, come on.

304
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:13,534
You look like a fun-loving girl.

305
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:17,746
I am sure you've been in a couple
 hairy situations of your own.

306
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:21,500
Just because I choose
 to express myself

307
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:24,127
doesn't mean that I condone adultery.

308
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:25,712
Sorry.

309
00:17:42,855 --> 00:17:45,566
Paternity test results?

310
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:49,236
I know. I'm in the same situation.

311
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:50,904
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

312
00:17:50,946 --> 00:17:52,698
I just found out the 
clinic screwed up

313
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:56,160
and gave me an egg that
 belonged to some lesbian.

314
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:58,787
It was supposed to be 
implanted in her lover,

315
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:00,831
and now my husband's freaking out

316
00:18:00,873 --> 00:18:04,626
because he thinks that our
 baby's gonna be gay!

317
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:10,799
Okay. We're in slightly
 different situations.

318
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,510
But do you wanna get a cup of 
coffee and talk about it?

319
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:16,972
Yeah. That'd be nice. Thanks.

320
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:19,224
Yeah. Us girls have to stick together.

321
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:23,187
We shouldn't let that stupid 
piece of paper ruin our life.

322
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:25,022
Yeah!

323
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:33,864
Obviously, I've known Rex for years,

324
00:18:33,906 --> 00:18:35,574
but when it comes to writing a eulogy,

325
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:38,619
I like as much input from
 the family as possible.

326
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,413
Oh. Well, um, what kind of input?

327
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:43,373
Oh, well, he means anecdotes,

328
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:45,125
little stories.

329
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:46,877
Isn't that what you mean, reverend?

330
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:48,795
Well, yes, but, uh, also--

331
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:50,714
I thought that you might 
need some help,

332
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:53,717
so last night I stayed up all night

333
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:57,304
and tried to remember funny things

334
00:18:57,346 --> 00:19:01,767
and moments that said so much
 about Rex as a person.

335
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:05,103
My. How--how many pages
 do you have there?

336
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:07,105
15.

337
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:17,032
well, you're hardly going to have to
 write anything at all, reverend.

338
00:19:17,074 --> 00:19:20,077
Some of those anecdotes are just priceless.

339
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:24,206
Phyllis, these are all things that 
happened to Rex before he went to college.

340
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:25,082
So?

341
00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:27,251
Well, don't you think it'd be
 nice if reverend devoted

342
00:19:27,251 --> 00:19:29,753
part of the eulogy to his life
 after he was married?

343
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:31,797
Oh, well, yes, of course.

344
00:19:31,797 --> 00:19:34,842
The reverend will mention 
that part of his life.

345
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:36,134
He's going to do more than mention it.

346
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:37,427
That's the part he'll focus on.

347
00:19:37,469 --> 00:19:41,473
In fact, I think three anecdotes from 
Rex's childhood is more than enough.

348
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:44,518
Um, that--that seems fair.

349
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,773
Well, whatever you think
 is appropriate.

350
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:50,399
Fine.

351
00:19:50,482 --> 00:19:53,861
I just thought if we were going 
to focus on a time in Rex's life,

352
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:58,073
that we might as well focus
 on the happiest time.

353
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:04,204
let's talk flowers.

354
00:20:04,288 --> 00:20:06,415
Now I know lilies are traditional,

355
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:10,127
but I think I can get you a deal
 on some white roses.

356
00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:13,589
Reverend, if you don't call her
 on that incredibly insensitive comment,

357
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:14,798
I'm gonna lose it.

358
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,842
I'm sure she didn't mean 
it the way it sounded.

359
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:19,219
- I knew exactly what I was saying.
- Ladies--

360
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:22,139
the happiest time in Rex's 
life was not his childhood.

361
00:20:22,181 --> 00:20:24,600
He loved being a husband,
and he loved being a father.

362
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:27,352
Well, he may have
 loved being a father,

363
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:30,731
but your marriage was a disaster.

364
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:34,902
Phyllis, is there something 
you'd like to say?

365
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:38,697
You made the last years
 of Rex's life miserable,

366
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:40,991
and now he's dead,

367
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:45,704
and he'll never have another
 chance at happiness.

368
00:20:47,164 --> 00:20:50,417
You are no longer invited
 to the funeral.

369
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:51,376
What?

370
00:20:51,418 --> 00:20:54,004
- You're not serious.
- Oh, yes, I am.

371
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:55,964
I am going to hire security,

372
00:20:56,006 --> 00:20:57,758
and those security men 
are going to have sticks,

373
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:00,135
and if you so much asset
 foot in that sanctuary,

374
00:21:00,177 --> 00:21:03,680
they will be instructed to beat
 you with those sticks.

375
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,765
Bree, this is your grief talking--

376
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:07,309
reverend, if you don't back me 
up on this, so help me,

377
00:21:07,351 --> 00:21:09,394
I will pull the funeral 
out of your church.

378
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:11,313
- Bree!
- I am not kidding.

379
00:21:11,355 --> 00:21:15,484
I will go nondenominational so fast,
 it will make your head spin.

380
00:21:27,746 --> 00:21:31,625
Susan, I heard what happened with Zach.

381
00:21:32,251 --> 00:21:33,335
How are you doing?

382
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:35,796
- Fine. Is Mike here?
- Inside.

383
00:21:35,838 --> 00:21:38,006
Jeez. You must have been terrified.

384
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:40,801
I mean, he put poor
 felicia in the hospital.

385
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:42,970
- Did he pistol-whip you?
- No.

386
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:45,472
Oh, come on. You can tell me.

387
00:21:45,472 --> 00:21:48,308
- Did he slap you around?
- No.

388
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,769
Well, don't get me wrong. I'm
 thrilled that you're okay.

389
00:21:50,811 --> 00:21:53,230
It's just that when someone holds
 someone else hostage,

390
00:21:53,272 --> 00:21:56,608
they usually rough 'em up a little.

391
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:00,153
It wasn't like that.

392
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:04,992
- Not even a little kicking?
- Edie...

393
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:08,745
someone to see you.

394
00:22:08,954 --> 00:22:10,205
- Well, hey, how's it goin'?
- Good.

395
00:22:10,247 --> 00:22:11,331
So there's a rumor going around

396
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:14,001
that you don't wanna press 
charges against Zach.

397
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:16,044
Is that true?

398
00:22:16,295 --> 00:22:18,380
Yeah.

399
00:22:19,298 --> 00:22:24,178
Wow. Um... I find that...confusing.

400
00:22:24,219 --> 00:22:25,888
Look, if we make a big deal out of this,

401
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:27,723
he could end up going to prison.

402
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:31,351
He held a gun to my face,
 so I'm thinking, "good."

403
00:22:31,393 --> 00:22:34,146
I've been to prison. 
He couldn't handle it.

404
00:22:34,188 --> 00:22:36,481
- Who cares?
- I care.

405
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:38,150
Well, you should care more about me.

406
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:40,444
I'm your girlfriend.
 We're moving in together.

407
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:42,321
He's just a neighbor. 
You don't even know Zach.

408
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:44,489
I know enough about him to know
 that deep down, he's a good kid.

409
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:46,783
Mike, he wanted to kill you.

410
00:22:46,825 --> 00:22:48,327
But he didn't.

411
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:51,538
You never asked me why
 Zach wanted to shoot you.

412
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:54,249
- Aren't you curious? 
- Does it matter?

413
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:57,794
Zach said you kidnapped 
his father so you could kill him.

414
00:22:57,794 --> 00:22:59,338
I didn't kill paul young.

415
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:04,301
I didn't think you did. 
Now tell me why Zach does.

416
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:14,937
I found some evidence that suggested
 that Paul murdered Deirdre.

417
00:23:14,978 --> 00:23:17,189
16 years ago Deirdre had a baby,

418
00:23:17,231 --> 00:23:19,608
and Paul and Mary Alice 
young kidnapped him

419
00:23:19,608 --> 00:23:21,068
and raised him as their own.

420
00:23:21,068 --> 00:23:24,780
Deirdre tracked him down here to Wisteria Lane 
and demanded her baby back.

421
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:27,282
So Paul killed her?

422
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:30,452
Actually, it was Mary Alice.

423
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:33,539
Oh, my god.

424
00:23:33,622 --> 00:23:35,332
Mike?

425
00:23:35,374 --> 00:23:37,334
I answered your phone.

426
00:23:37,376 --> 00:23:39,503
It's the police.

427
00:23:39,837 --> 00:23:41,755
Yeah. Delfino.

428
00:23:42,673 --> 00:23:44,508
You did?

429
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:47,553
Okay, I can be there in 20 minutes.

430
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:52,808
Zach's dead.

431
00:23:54,268 --> 00:23:57,062
They want me to come identify the body.

432
00:24:09,324 --> 00:24:11,201
Thanks for coming down.

433
00:24:11,326 --> 00:24:13,745
Since the kid's father is missing,

434
00:24:13,829 --> 00:24:16,331
we didn't know who else to call.

435
00:24:17,124 --> 00:24:21,003
So... you folks ready?

436
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:37,477
that's not Zach.

437
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:38,979
You're sure?

438
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:40,564
He had a gun in my face for six hours.

439
00:24:40,606 --> 00:24:42,983
I know what he looks like.

440
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:03,587
- Can you give us a minute?
- Sure.

441
00:25:13,931 --> 00:25:18,435
- Zach is your son, isn't he?
- Yeah.

442
00:25:18,477 --> 00:25:21,104
I'm pretty sure.

443
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:27,778
How long have you known?

444
00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:31,406
Paul Young told me.

445
00:25:33,325 --> 00:25:35,202
Deirdre got pregnant
 before I went to jail

446
00:25:35,244 --> 00:25:40,040
and, um, told me she had an abortion.

447
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:42,709
Guess she lied.

448
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:44,586
I see.

449
00:25:47,506 --> 00:25:50,551
When I took Paul out to the desert,

450
00:25:50,676 --> 00:25:54,054
and I was so angry,
 I just wanted to hurt him...

451
00:25:55,055 --> 00:25:57,933
the way they hurt Deirdre.

452
00:25:58,517 --> 00:25:59,726
But then when he told me

453
00:25:59,768 --> 00:26:03,522
that he and Mary Alice had taken
 care of Deirdre's baby--

454
00:26:03,564 --> 00:26:06,358
my baby...

455
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:10,279
that rage just went away.

456
00:26:13,532 --> 00:26:17,744
Kept me from doing something
 really stupid.

457
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:28,213
I'm gonna take a cab home, okay?

458
00:26:36,138 --> 00:26:39,016
Mom, grandma's leaving, all right? 
You have to talk to her.

459
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:41,310
No, I don't. If you heard the
 things that she said to me--

460
00:26:41,351 --> 00:26:43,896
look, I'm sure she was
 a real bitch, okay?

461
00:26:43,937 --> 00:26:48,066
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:35,200
But she's family, 
so that makes her our bitch.

462
00:26:48,358 --> 00:26:50,319
Let her say good-bye to dad.

463
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,071
She went out of her
 way to be cruel to me.

464
00:26:53,113 --> 00:26:54,364
I don't want her at the funeral.

465
00:26:54,406 --> 00:26:58,118
Mom, if you don't let grandma come, 
I will never forgive you.

466
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,871
Did I ask for your help?

467
00:27:02,831 --> 00:27:05,834
You know dad would want her there.

468
00:27:17,304 --> 00:27:20,390
It's true Rex and I did not have 
the perfect marriage,

469
00:27:20,432 --> 00:27:24,311
but for 18 years I tried my very best,

470
00:27:24,353 --> 00:27:27,731
and for that I am entitled
 to your respect.

471
00:27:29,566 --> 00:27:31,902
Of course you are.

472
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:34,738
Of course I respect you.

473
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:38,867
Well, then why did you 
say those things to me?

474
00:27:38,951 --> 00:27:42,830
I guess I thought it would be
 easier to be angry at you

475
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:46,083
than to be angry with Rex.

476
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:49,711
I mean, what was he thinking,

477
00:27:49,753 --> 00:27:51,255
leaving me?

478
00:27:55,843 --> 00:27:59,263
I do want you to come to the funeral.

479
00:28:00,764 --> 00:28:04,184
you don't know what that
 means to me, Bree.

480
00:28:04,226 --> 00:28:06,228
Thank you.

481
00:28:10,065 --> 00:28:13,026
Someone should get my luggage.

482
00:28:16,822 --> 00:28:19,825
Okay, let's get outta here.Tom?

483
00:28:19,825 --> 00:28:21,785
- Yeah?
- Mom.

484
00:28:23,412 --> 00:28:24,955
What's the matter?

485
00:28:24,997 --> 00:28:29,084
My back--I threw it out. I was 
holding parker upside down.

486
00:28:29,084 --> 00:28:33,130
Okay. Come on.Give me your feet.

487
00:28:34,298 --> 00:28:36,341
how's that? Is that better?

488
00:28:37,384 --> 00:28:39,511
honey, can you push the interview?

489
00:28:39,511 --> 00:28:40,679
Because I don't think I'm gonna be able

490
00:28:40,721 --> 00:28:42,139
to take care of penny like this.

491
00:28:42,181 --> 00:28:42,848
Don't do this to me.

492
00:28:42,848 --> 00:28:44,266
I don't have time to make a phone call,

493
00:28:44,308 --> 00:28:46,476
and I promised that woman 
I would not let the kids

494
00:28:46,476 --> 00:28:48,145
interfere with this job.

495
00:28:48,187 --> 00:28:50,731
But that was a stupid promise.

496
00:28:51,106 --> 00:28:54,193
Remember that time when you were away
 in Tucson, and I had a 104 fever,

497
00:28:54,234 --> 00:28:57,279
but I still managed to take
 the kids trick-or-treating?

498
00:28:57,988 --> 00:28:59,114
honey...

499
00:28:59,156 --> 00:29:00,991
I don't think that's helping.

500
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:06,497
Tom, being a mom is like 
being an E.R. Doctor.

501
00:29:06,538 --> 00:29:11,376
There are no days off,
 so get up! Get up!

502
00:29:11,668 --> 00:29:13,420
Okay.

503
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:17,674
Jeez, are you crying?

504
00:29:17,716 --> 00:29:19,843
Just a little.

505
00:29:19,968 --> 00:29:22,888
I'll be fine. You just... go. 
Just go.

506
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:29,186
oh, for God sakes.

507
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,357
Give 'em hell, honey.

508
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,609
You...

509
00:29:44,785 --> 00:29:47,621
hi, mrs. Scavo. You can wait inside.

510
00:29:47,663 --> 00:29:49,414
- They'll be right in.
- Great.

511
00:29:50,749 --> 00:29:52,417
Listen,uh...

512
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:53,836
- Stu.
- Stu.

513
00:29:53,877 --> 00:29:56,171
You look like a bright, uh,
 responsible young man,

514
00:29:56,171 --> 00:29:59,341
and I bet you just love 
kids. Am I right?

515
00:30:10,602 --> 00:30:12,729
Ed Ferrara, Lynette Scavo.

516
00:30:12,771 --> 00:30:14,147
Thanks so much for having me in.

517
00:30:14,231 --> 00:30:15,607
Nice to meet you. Please,sit.

518
00:30:15,649 --> 00:30:17,401
Thank you.

519
00:30:18,694 --> 00:30:21,238
We're gonna have to 
make this quick.

520
00:30:21,488 --> 00:30:24,074
I gotta leave in five
 to catch a plane.

521
00:30:24,116 --> 00:30:26,910
I got celtic tickets on the floor.

522
00:30:28,954 --> 00:30:31,123
This is a great resume?

523
00:30:31,248 --> 00:30:34,042
I see you worked with the Donahues.

524
00:30:34,126 --> 00:30:37,754
You know, I snaked the Oslo candy
 account from 'em last year.

525
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,340
So you've done a lot of copy work?

526
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:43,886
I have. But when I moved over
 to cenn and simmons,

527
00:30:43,927 --> 00:30:48,932
um, I got to do a broader 
range of campaigns.

528
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,686
T...

529
00:30:54,897 --> 00:30:57,357
uh, V...

530
00:30:57,399 --> 00:30:59,985
and... uh...

531
00:31:00,027 --> 00:31:02,070
radio...

532
00:31:02,112 --> 00:31:05,157
uh, billboards.

533
00:31:06,825 --> 00:31:09,036
could you excuse me for a minute?

534
00:31:09,077 --> 00:31:10,537
Please?

535
00:31:10,704 --> 00:31:12,372
What's going on?

536
00:31:12,414 --> 00:31:14,708
I have no idea.

537
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,460
Stu, you are an idiot.

538
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:19,546
You're an idiot, an absolute idiot.

539
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:20,881
Hi.

540
00:31:20,923 --> 00:31:23,467
Ha! Guys, I'd like you to meet Penny.

541
00:31:23,467 --> 00:31:25,219
She gives me all my best ideas.

542
00:31:25,219 --> 00:31:26,970
You brought your baby to the interview.

543
00:31:27,012 --> 00:31:29,515
- It won't be an ongoing thing.
- You bet it won't.

544
00:31:29,556 --> 00:31:30,641
Nina, it's fine.

545
00:31:30,682 --> 00:31:32,601
Any chance we can get
 that little lady to be quiet?

546
00:31:32,643 --> 00:31:34,144
Not until I change her diaper.

547
00:31:34,186 --> 00:31:36,063
Could you just give me two minutes?

548
00:31:36,104 --> 00:31:39,483
Sorry. Plane. Well...

549
00:31:41,401 --> 00:31:43,904
then watch me multitask.

550
00:31:43,904 --> 00:31:45,197
Here's how I see it.

551
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:47,157
You guys run a really good shop,

552
00:31:47,199 --> 00:31:49,660
but if you want your agency
 to go to the next level,

553
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,495
you have to focus on two things.

554
00:31:51,537 --> 00:31:53,872
First, you've gotta win some awards.

555
00:31:53,914 --> 00:31:57,167
Do some P.S.A.S, pro bono stuff,
 whatever it takes,

556
00:31:57,209 --> 00:32:00,462
because whether they admit it or not,

557
00:32:00,504 --> 00:32:02,756
clients care about what's
 in your trophy case.

558
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:04,633
Two--your web site.

559
00:32:04,675 --> 00:32:06,718
It's the first thing a 
client's gonna look at,

560
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,680
and it's hard to navigate.
There's no site map.

561
00:32:09,721 --> 00:32:13,058
It just wasn't built for people 
who grow up without computers.

562
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,686
There. And third...

563
00:32:16,061 --> 00:32:17,521
I don't have a third.

564
00:32:17,563 --> 00:32:21,733
Yeah, so that's... it.

565
00:32:22,568 --> 00:32:23,569
Okay.

566
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:24,903
You're in.

567
00:32:24,987 --> 00:32:27,239
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

568
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,742
Take the office across 
the hall. I gotta run.

569
00:32:33,453 --> 00:32:35,622
Well, all right!

570
00:32:40,711 --> 00:32:43,005
Okay, obviously, I'm gonna
 clean that up.

571
00:32:43,547 --> 00:32:47,676
Here it is in black and white. 
It's your kid.

572
00:32:54,433 --> 00:32:56,560
What? Why aren't you smiling?

573
00:32:56,602 --> 00:32:57,769
It's not enough.

574
00:32:57,811 --> 00:32:59,146
What do you want, 
a father's day card?

575
00:32:59,188 --> 00:33:01,899
You knew the one thing that
 I demanded was fidelity,

576
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,692
and you still went out and 
screwed around behind my back.

577
00:33:03,734 --> 00:33:05,903
You knew the one thing 
I didn't want was a child,

578
00:33:05,903 --> 00:33:07,613
and you still tricked me 
into getting pregnant.

579
00:33:07,654 --> 00:33:08,405
It's not the same thing.

580
00:33:08,405 --> 00:33:11,283
Damn straight. What you did was worse.

581
00:33:14,578 --> 00:33:16,538
We're not very nice people, are we?

582
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,582
No, we're not.

583
00:33:18,874 --> 00:33:20,042
Oh, when we got married,

584
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:22,836
I thought we were gonna be so happy.

585
00:33:22,836 --> 00:33:24,838
Me too.

586
00:33:28,383 --> 00:33:31,803
Look on the bright side. 
At least we're still rich.

587
00:33:32,054 --> 00:33:34,681
Thank god for that.

588
00:33:42,523 --> 00:33:45,484
So it occurred to me...

589
00:33:47,069 --> 00:33:51,156
that I was really rude at the morgue.

590
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:57,120
When you told me about Zach, 
I was so busy freaking out,

591
00:33:57,162 --> 00:34:00,165
I never actually congratulated you.

592
00:34:00,165 --> 00:34:01,500
Congratulated me?

593
00:34:01,542 --> 00:34:04,795
Yeah, I know how much you've
 always wanted a child,

594
00:34:04,837 --> 00:34:06,964
and now you have one.

595
00:34:07,047 --> 00:34:07,798
Thanks.

596
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,676
Obviously, um, it was quite a shock,

597
00:34:11,885 --> 00:34:16,265
but it's good news any way you slice it.

598
00:34:18,433 --> 00:34:19,643
What's wrong?

599
00:34:19,643 --> 00:34:22,980
So naturally you'll be wanting to...

600
00:34:23,021 --> 00:34:26,191
have a relationship with him, 
and that takes time,

601
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:27,818
- a lot of time.
- Susan--

602
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:32,364
and out of all the mixed-up 
teenagers in the world,

603
00:34:32,406 --> 00:34:37,327
Zach is just the one kid that 
I can't be around.

604
00:34:37,536 --> 00:34:40,497
I can't have julie around him.

605
00:34:40,539 --> 00:34:45,127
So, um, what I'm trying to say is...

606
00:34:45,669 --> 00:34:47,004
we can't move in together.

607
00:34:47,045 --> 00:34:49,464
But I am so happy for you.

608
00:34:49,631 --> 00:34:52,551
Really, you have a child,
 and that is good for you.

609
00:34:52,593 --> 00:34:53,552
Isn't there any way--

610
00:34:53,594 --> 00:34:56,263
No. No, I...

611
00:34:56,346 --> 00:34:58,557
so sorry.

612
00:35:00,392 --> 00:35:02,644
I'll--I'll, um,

613
00:36:19,263 --> 00:36:21,598
I'll see you around.

614
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,976
today we've come together 
to celebrate the life

615
00:36:24,017 --> 00:36:27,062
of Dr. Rex Van de Kamp...

616
00:36:27,062 --> 00:36:28,605
what is he wearing?

617
00:36:28,772 --> 00:36:29,857
What?

618
00:36:29,898 --> 00:36:32,192
I left him an hour ago,

619
00:36:32,276 --> 00:36:35,195
and he was wearing Ralph Lauren.

620
00:36:35,237 --> 00:36:38,407
But it's what Rex would have wanted.

621
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,868
He loved that prep school.

622
00:36:40,951 --> 00:36:43,620
...But which ever coat
 he was wearing,

623
00:36:43,662 --> 00:36:45,747
Rex always brought an 
irresistible enthusiasm

624
00:36:45,747 --> 00:36:49,209
and a single-minded determination to...

625
00:36:49,251 --> 00:36:51,628
so as we mourn the passing 
of Rex Van de Kamp,

626
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:55,174
we give thanks to god,

627
00:36:55,174 --> 00:36:59,052
for we do not grieve as those
 who have no hope

628
00:37:16,278 --> 00:37:18,113
but as those who place
 their trust in god.

629
00:37:18,739 --> 00:37:21,533
wait!

630
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:38,592
do not close that coffin.

631
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,802
Give me your tie.

632
00:37:40,844 --> 00:37:43,764
What?

633
00:37:45,098 --> 00:37:47,601
Give me your tie.

634
00:38:43,907 --> 00:38:48,078
give it to her! Give it to her.

635
00:39:19,276 --> 00:39:22,946
You look magnificent.

636
00:39:22,988 --> 00:39:25,574
so it looks like Mary Alice 
killed Zach's birth mother

637
00:39:25,616 --> 00:39:27,409
in order to keep her 
from taking Zach away.

638
00:39:28,076 --> 00:39:31,079
Oh, my God.

639
00:39:31,121 --> 00:39:34,917
I mean, I knew Mary Alice
 had killed herself

640
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:38,378
over something big, but wow.

641
00:39:38,378 --> 00:39:40,547
Can you imagine living with that guilt?

642
00:39:40,589 --> 00:39:42,674
Isn't it bizarre that 
Paul and Mary Alice

643
00:39:42,716 --> 00:39:44,635
had this secret all those years,

644
00:39:44,676 --> 00:39:46,929
and we didn't even know about it?

645
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:49,890
No, not really.

646
00:39:49,932 --> 00:39:52,059
I mean, what do we actually 
know about our neighbors?

647
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,727
I mean, we can tell if they
 keep their lawns nice

648
00:39:53,769 --> 00:39:56,355
or they take their trash cans in,

649
00:39:56,355 --> 00:40:00,317
but when they do those things,
we stop asking questions

650
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:04,404
'cause if people are good neighbors...

651
00:40:05,447 --> 00:40:08,659
we don't really care what 
happens behind closed doors.

652
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,619
<i>It had been one year since my suicide...</i></i>

653
00:40:10,702 --> 00:40:14,623
makes you wonder,doesn't it?

654
00:40:14,665 --> 00:40:16,834
<i>And a lot had changed on Wisteria Lane.</i></i>

655
00:40:16,875 --> 00:40:18,335
<i>There were new flowers,</i></i>

656
00:40:18,377 --> 00:40:20,712
<i>new houses</i></i>

657
00:40:20,754 --> 00:40:26,051
<i>and new neighbors--</i></i>

658
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,474
<i>the kind anyone would want 
living right next door.</i></i>

659
00:40:32,516 --> 00:40:34,810
is that another hymn?

660
00:40:34,852 --> 00:40:36,645
I know. It's silly,

661
00:40:36,645 --> 00:40:39,064
but playing those songs 
today at the funeral

662
00:40:39,064 --> 00:40:41,900
just got me in the mood.

663
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:43,819
This is your grandmother's favorite.

664
00:40:43,861 --> 00:40:45,487
Did you remember butter?

665
00:40:45,529 --> 00:40:48,949
I make up this tray every night.

666
00:40:49,449 --> 00:40:50,909
Of course you do. I'm sorry.

667
00:40:50,951 --> 00:40:53,704
Oh, look.

668
00:40:53,996 --> 00:40:56,331
You added a flower.

669
00:40:57,749 --> 00:41:01,295
Thought it'd be nice.

670
00:41:01,336 --> 00:41:03,505
How'd I get so lucky to 
have a child like you?

671
00:41:03,547 --> 00:41:06,383
You really do try to think about us.

672
00:41:06,425 --> 00:41:08,218
That flower is a small act of kindness

673
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,845
you thought no one would notice,

674
00:41:09,887 --> 00:41:12,556
and yet you did it anyway.

675
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,976
Says a lot about how you were raised.

676
00:41:16,059 --> 00:41:17,978
Well ,I guess you did your job.

677
00:41:24,318 --> 00:41:26,487
Thank yourself.

678
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:28,572
I'll get the tray.

679
00:42:15,202 --> 00:42:18,163
You take the gun.

680
00:42:28,006 --> 00:42:32,010
It really is a lovely gesture.
