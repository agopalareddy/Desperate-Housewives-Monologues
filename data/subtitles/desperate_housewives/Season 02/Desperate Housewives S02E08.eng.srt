2
00:00:03,045 --> 00:00:04,755
Previously on Desperate Housewives:

3
00:00:04,755 --> 00:00:07,132
I'm going to be a stay-at-home dad.

4
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:08,759
Some reversed rolls.

5
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:11,136
I've been thinking about you.
- So you came to ask me out?

6
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:12,429
Some were welcomed in.

7
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:13,847
'Cause I'll say yes.

8
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,350
I moved on. You should do the same.

9
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,353
Some were shown the door.

10
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:21,939
Will you marry me?
And some

11
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:26,944
never got the chance

12
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:33,825
to find out what they really wanted.

13
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:36,537
Betty Applewhite was a gifted woman.

14
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:41,458
Everyone had always said so,
ever since she was a child.

15
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:46,463
Her first piano teacher praised her dexterity.

16
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:52,427
Her first college professor applauded
her sense of rhythm.

17
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:58,725
Her first symphony conductor hailed
her dramatic flair.

18
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:03,146
But Betty was no longer a concert pianist.

19
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:05,732
She was now just a woman with a secret ..

20
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:09,736
one she was determined to keep
by any means necessary.

21
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:13,156
I'm not a bit surprised that somebody
broke into Gabrielle's house.

22
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:17,536
Wisteria Lane is an easy target. It's not
like the police patrol around here.

23
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:19,246
We still have the neighborhood watch.

24
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,331
The neighborhood watch is a joke.

25
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:25,544
When was the last time any of you
went on patrol, huh?

26
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:28,046
I put security lights on my house.

27
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:30,465
I say, it's time that we hire professional security.

28
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:31,925
That sounds expensive.

29
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,344
Could you really put a price on your kids' safety?

30
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:35,429
Well, you probably could.

31
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:38,432
Look, McClusky, I am as worried
as everybody else in this neighborhood,

32
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:40,434
but I don't know if guys running around with weapons...
- We've got to stop this.

33
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:42,227
And say what, "we're against security"?

34
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:45,439
But if they find Caleb first...
- Matthew, I'm trying to think.

35
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,356
I'm not talking about a bunch of vigilantes.

36
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,650
I'm talking about trained men
who know when to shoot.

37
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,652
Do we really need professional security?

38
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:53,363
Are you all going to wait until
somebody else is attacked?

39
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:56,241
I think it's time to take a vote on armed security.

40
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,242
I'm not scared for now.

41
00:01:57,242 --> 00:02:02,247
I've had enough. All those in favor...

42
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,751
Sorry.

43
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:08,337
Things were just going so -- dramatic.

44
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:09,838
Wow, you're really good!

45
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,840
We were taking a vote here.

46
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,342
She was a concert pianist.

47
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:18,347
Well, I doubled a bit.

48
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:26,855
Yes, Betty Applewhite was a gifted woman.

49
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:31,860
And the greatest of all her gifts

50
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:35,864
was her timing.

51
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:40,827
Season 2 episode 8:
The Sun won't Set

52
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:47,626
Once they've suffered a miscarriage,
some women sit alone in the dark for hours.

53
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,963
They refuse to go out in the light of day,

54
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:55,634
afraid to face the possibility that life will go on.

55
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:59,263
They hold on to reminders of their unborn child

56
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:02,641
and dream of what might have been.

57
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:07,646
Yes, this is how some women react
when they've suffered such a loss.

58
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:14,361
Gabrielle Solis was not one of those women.

59
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,660
Hi guys!

60
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,829
Hi honey! How are you?

61
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:24,663
I'm fine.

62
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:28,250
Thank you for the messages. I'm sorry
I haven't had the time to return calls.

63
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,626
We all clutter our schedules.

64
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,753
We thought maybe you could use some company?

65
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:34,131
So we are going to go to my house,
I made banana bread,

66
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:39,136
and we'll put on a fresh pot and
just talk about anything.

67
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,056
That .. sounds so nice ..

68
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:46,226
It's just, I'm booked solid today.
My head's going to explode.

69
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,645
Can I take a rain check?

70
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,064
Sure.

71
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,065
Thanks.

72
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,525
Thanks for understanding.

73
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:57,529
Ok, I will call you tonight, and we'll
figure out a time later in the week.

74
00:03:57,529 --> 00:04:00,449
Tell you what, since it's my schedule
that seems to be the problem ..

75
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:03,744
why don't I just figure out a time and call you?

76
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:04,536
Ok.

77
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:09,541
I have so many errands to run,
and a million things to return...

78
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:14,338
Oh honey, there's no reason why you
and Carlos can't try again.

79
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:16,131
You'd be an amazing mother.

80
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:20,052
You should hold onto that stuff for a while.

81
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:25,057
I would, but the store has this
strict 30-day return policy.

82
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:38,362
Carlos, what happened?

83
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:41,156
I've had a rough couple of days.

84
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:43,742
After you told me about the...

85
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:47,037
the baby.

86
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,956
I kind of lost it.

87
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:51,250
God, what's with your hands?

88
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,543
I ripped my mattress open.

89
00:04:52,543 --> 00:04:54,628
Jeez! How are you feeling today?

90
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:58,841
They've injected me with this tranquilizer thing.

91
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:03,262
I think it's doing the trick.

92
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:07,057
We haven't even talked abot names.

93
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:09,226
I had my top five all picked out.

94
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:10,143
Honey...

95
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,353
You want to hear?

96
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:14,356
No, I'm good.

97
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:16,233
You never thought about names?

98
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:19,444
No. It was a little soon for that,
don't you think?

99
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:24,449
How can you name something
the size of a walnut?

100
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:27,327
Is this new?

101
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,328
Do you like it?

102
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:33,041
I picked it up on the way here.

103
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,960
You just lost a baby!

104
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,128
We all grieve differently.

105
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:37,838
You're sort of taking it pretty well.

106
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:41,133
I go shopping, you rip toilets out of the wall.

107
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:42,050
Different strokes.

108
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,552
Are you even sad?

109
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:46,346
Oh please. What do you think?

110
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,056
Honestly, I don't know!

111
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,726
Of course I'm sad, it's a sad situation.

112
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:55,731
Now let go of me!

113
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:57,149
Hole me up.

114
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:58,442
Are you ok?

115
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:01,361
I think my tranquilizer's wearing off.

116
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:06,325
Well, let's get you another round!

117
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:16,960
Hey Mike.

118
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,629
So my mom's wedding's in a couple of days,

119
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:20,964
and I know you sent back those little cards
saying that you're coming,

120
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,257
and that you preferred beef

121
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:27,262
(which I changed to fish for you,
'cause I tasted the beef) ..

122
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:32,226
Anyways, I know that was before
we .. you know.

123
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:37,356
Send your mom my apologies,
but I won't be attending.

124
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:42,736
I hope that's not just because of us
not being us anymore.

125
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:47,741
I mean, we could be together at the wedding,
and it wouldn't have to be weird.

126
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,160
It'd be weird.

127
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,165
'Course. Yeah, I see that.

128
00:06:57,835 --> 00:06:59,628
So what've you been doing lately?

129
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:02,130
As usual.

130
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,341
Well, I've been writing a book.

131
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,844
Sort of autobiographical.

132
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:11,849
It's been forcing me to reexamine some
of the different things that have made me me,

133
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:14,935
like the fact my mother had me so young,

134
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,229
and I never knew my dad...

135
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:19,439
big stuff like that.

136
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,732
I told you about my dad, right?

137
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:25,737
He was a Merchant Marine, and his platoon
was killed in the battle of Hanoi.

138
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,030
That's strange.

139
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,532
Why?

140
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:31,159
Well, Hanoi was on enemy territory.
There wasn't a battle there.

141
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,162
Are you sure? That's what my mom said.

142
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,039
I'm pretty sure, yeah.

143
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:40,335
And Merchant Marines don't fight,
they deliver supplies and ships.

144
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:42,254
Oh.

145
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:45,924
Well, clearly I have more research to do.

146
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:47,426
So what do you think?

147
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:50,846
My life's story -- would you rush out
and buy a copy?

148
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:52,264
Susan --

149
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:53,432
Yeah?

150
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:58,437
You're going to need to step back.

151
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:10,949
Catch catch catch!

152
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:14,328
I want to be quarterback! Go off for a catch!

153
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:18,540
Porter, Preston, what have I told you
about playing outside after dark?

154
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,958
It's not dark.

155
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,627
Does your Dad know you're out here?

156
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:23,462
Don't worry, I've been watching them.

157
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:26,131
They keep setting off my motion sensors.

158
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:28,258
I ought to send you half my electric bill.

159
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:29,551
You do that!

160
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:33,138
ok, guys, come on over here. On the sidewalk.

161
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:38,143
Stay there. Not on the street. Thank you.

162
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,562
Hey.

163
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:41,438
Hey babe.

164
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:43,357
I'm home.

165
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:45,734
Could you come here a sec?

166
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:50,030
Sure, what's up?

167
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,240
Block me, come on!

168
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,825
Damn, they must have snuck out again!

169
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:57,162
Again? How often does this happen?

170
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,456
Boys! Get in here, now!

171
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:02,334
Honey, you know how slippery they are.
It's like trying to herd cats.

172
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:05,254
Tom, it's 9 o'clock at night!

173
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:07,464
Guys, upstairs, now! Let's go!

174
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:10,259
In the PJs, in the bed!

175
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:13,637
Honey, they're fine. You just worry too much.

176
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:15,055
And for good reason!

177
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:18,141
Someone could've driven off with them,
and you wouldn't have even noticed.

178
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:19,935
They were in the front yard!

179
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:23,063
God, when I was their age, I used to hop
on my bike, disappear for hours.

180
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,439
My mom never batted an eye.

181
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:27,150
That was a different time.
You have to be more vigilant.

182
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,152
There was a break-in on this street.

183
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,530
I was at the neigborhood watch meeting, remember?

184
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,448
I'm sorry, I've been doing this for 7 years.

185
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:36,660
Trust me, you have to have eyes
in the back of your head.

186
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,954
The two in front work just fine, thanks.

187
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:39,830
Really?
- M-hm.

188
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:44,835
Where's Penny?

189
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:49,131
See?

190
00:09:49,131 --> 00:09:54,136
Right where I left her.

191
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:13,155
How did this get in the paper?

192
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:14,740
I was going to call you.

193
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,451
We discussed this. We agreed to go slowly.

194
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:19,453
I was going to call and cancel after our talk,

195
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:22,456
but things just got so hectic. I forgot.

196
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:25,042
Rex has only been dead for 7 weeks!

197
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:26,043
So?

198
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:29,755
So I don't want every woman in this town
talking about me behind my back!

199
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:30,964
I'm sorry.

200
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:34,426
But isn't the damage done?

201
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:39,139
Well, fortunately people only read
the announcements when there's
nothing on the front page,

202
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:42,935
and the headline today was about
some catastrophic flood in Sri Lanka.

203
00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:44,144
Oh, so we lucked out!

204
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:46,146
Yes, we did.

205
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:50,359
Now, when the time comes to go
public with our relationship,

206
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:52,861
I need you to discuss it with me first.

207
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:57,824
I'm the bride after all. It's only appropriate.

208
00:10:58,033 --> 00:11:03,038
ok.

209
00:11:03,247 --> 00:11:06,124
I will need you to wear that ring now.

210
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:07,042
The ring?

211
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:08,961
You're not wearing it. Where is it?

212
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:10,128
It's in my purse.

213
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:11,129
Good.

214
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:14,424
Please put it on.

215
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:16,134
But if people see it --

216
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,428
They'll assume that you're wearing
your wedding ring.

217
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:20,055
Maybe, but why risk it?

218
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:24,560
Because a ring tells would-be suitors
a woman is spoken for.

219
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,565
A naked hand invites unwanted attention.

220
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:36,864
Here, let me.

221
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:42,160
Will that be all, Mrs Van De Kamp?

222
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,166
Yes, I think so, Mr Williams.

223
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:34,505
Oh my God!

224
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:37,508
What do you want?

225
00:12:37,508 --> 00:12:39,009
Eh -- it's cool!

226
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:41,094
No, it's not cool! Who the hell are you?

227
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,095
Carlos sent me.

228
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,597
I'm going to call the police!

229
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:46,391
My name's Hector. I met Carlos inside.

230
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:49,269
Inside what?

231
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,605
You mean, in prison?

232
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:54,691
He told me what happened and asked me
to come by and keep an eye on you.

233
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:55,400
Can I come in?

234
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,986
No! No, you can't come in!

235
00:12:57,986 --> 00:12:59,696
I brought a cooler, I'll camp out here.

236
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:04,701
No! I can take care of myself, ok?

237
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:06,995
Ok.

238
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,080
Ok?

239
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,291
Yeah, I get it. You need your space.

240
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,501
Yes.

241
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:17,506
Yes I do, I need my space. Thank you.

242
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:33,272
I want to show you something. Come here.

243
00:13:33,272 --> 00:13:34,398
Hi guys!

244
00:13:34,398 --> 00:13:36,608
I thought about what you said, don't want you to worry,

245
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:39,403
so I had a little talk with the boys.

246
00:13:39,403 --> 00:13:42,072
Ok. Guys, what do we do...

247
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:47,077
if a stranger asks us to take a ride in their car?

248
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:50,789
Porter.
- We run away and call 911.

249
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:52,374
Good man! Right.

250
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:56,587
But what if that stranger says,
"Hey, I know your Mommy and Daddy"?

251
00:13:56,587 --> 00:13:57,588
What? Preston!

252
00:13:57,588 --> 00:13:58,672
Still run away!

253
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:00,799
Yes! ok ..

254
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,384
Can I ask a question?

255
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:03,802
Yeah, by all means.

256
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:07,306
What if the stranger is nice and not scary?

257
00:14:07,306 --> 00:14:08,307
Yes?

258
00:14:08,307 --> 00:14:11,768
Run away and call 911.

259
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:15,981
So what if the stranger says they're going to take you...

260
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:20,986
to the circus? For pizza and elephant rides?

261
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:25,782
Don't look at your Dad! Eyes on me!

262
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:28,577
What are you going to do?

263
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:30,204
We...

264
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:31,997
... run away?

265
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:33,290
Yes!

266
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:38,295
Snap! To the kitchen! We are having ice cream tonight!
- Yeah!

267
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:40,005
You get the bowls!

268
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:42,299
You're smiling like that actually
meant something.

269
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:45,177
Lynette, come on. We worked on this
all afternoon. They get it.

270
00:14:45,177 --> 00:14:46,887
Give me a break. You know our kids.

271
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:50,098
I love them dearly, but that goes
in one ear and out the other.

272
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:51,183
I can't reach it!

273
00:14:51,183 --> 00:14:52,476
I'm going to have some ice cream.

274
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:54,269
Tom, you're not off the hook here!

275
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:56,396
Lynette, I can keep my children alive.

276
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:57,981
When you left this morning, there were four.

277
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:00,108
When you came home, there were still four.

278
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:05,072
When you come home and there are
only three, then you get to lecture me.

279
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:11,578
Excuse me!

280
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:12,996
Are you Bree Van De Kamp?

281
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:14,373
Yes, I am.

282
00:15:14,373 --> 00:15:18,001
My name is Leila Mitzman.
I hope I'm not interrupting?

283
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:19,169
Can I help you?

284
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:22,297
This may sound odd, but I felt
I should see you.

285
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:25,175
I read in the paper that you're engaged
to George Williams.

286
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:28,095
Oh, well, that announcement was a bit premature.

287
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:33,100
But you and George are involved?
In a romantic relationship?

288
00:15:35,978 --> 00:15:37,187
Yes.

289
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:40,607
Then we need to talk.

290
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:44,069
We'd been dating for 6 months
when he asked to marry him.

291
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:47,573
From the moment I said yes,
George got so possessive.

292
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:50,409
And when he found out my ex
lived just down the street,

293
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:53,704
George accused me of seeing him behind his back.

294
00:15:53,704 --> 00:15:56,373
And then one night, I got a call
from the police.

295
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:59,376
Someone had set my ex's car on fire.

296
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:01,795
I could never prove anything,
but I knew it was George.

297
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:04,673
I left him the next day.

298
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:07,801
Well. I don't know what to say.

299
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:10,470
I know it's upsetting.

300
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,389
Yes, it is.

301
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:15,809
To have a complete stranger come
into my home, drink my tea

302
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:19,605
and then try to turn me against one
of the sweetest men I have ever known.

303
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:20,689
Honey, you got to trust me.

304
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:25,694
George is a wack job, and you
should get while the getting's good.

305
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:27,905
I think it's time for you to leave.

306
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:30,490
One time, I was talking to a guy at the bar,

307
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,784
and when we got home, George slapped me.

308
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:33,869
What do you say to that?

309
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:38,081
I say, given your overall demeanor
and your free-wheeling used-up epithets,

310
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:42,669
I'm willing to bet that he was provoked.

311
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:47,674
When I read you were engaged to George,
I felt it was my duty to let you know he's crazy.

312
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:53,096
But now that I've met you, I can see
it's a match made in heaven!

313
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:03,982
I'm here!

314
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:05,901
Hi, Morty. Reverend Hopkins.

315
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:09,404
I'm sorry I'm late to rehearsal.

316
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:12,407
It's ok, it's all right. You're here now.
It's fine.

317
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:13,575
Go in front of me.

318
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:16,787
Ok, Reverend! Hit it!

319
00:17:16,787 --> 00:17:18,288
Mom, can I ask you a question?

320
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:21,291
You've got to march, Suzie! Got to march!

321
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:25,295
I was just researching my book,
and I found the strangest thing:

322
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:30,008
No one with my father's name
was ever a Merchant Marine.

323
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:33,887
Did I say Merchant? I just meant
the regular Marines.

324
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:36,181
I thought you probably did, so
I checked that too. And he wasn't there.

325
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:38,392
So I called the VA [Veteran's Affairs department]

326
00:17:38,392 --> 00:17:43,397
and there is not a single record
of anyone named Harrison Ross
in Viet Nam.

327
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:47,401
This is not the time, Suzie.

328
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:49,778
What's the hold-up with you?

329
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:53,282
I'm sorry to upset you, Mom, just ..
don't you think that's weird?

330
00:17:53,282 --> 00:17:55,075
What's weird?

331
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:59,872
There's no record of anyone with
my Dad's name in the Armed Services.

332
00:17:59,872 --> 00:18:03,876
Oh. There it is.

333
00:18:03,876 --> 00:18:05,169
There what is?

334
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:07,504
Morty, just go on back up there!

335
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:12,509
Look, I'm not going to say that
I knew this would happen, but --

336
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:17,806
I knew this would happen.

337
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:20,309
Mom, I need answers.

338
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:23,395
Do you have to do this now?

339
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:26,190
You are ruining my wedding rehearsal!

340
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,901
You've been married 4 times.
I think you got it down.

341
00:18:28,901 --> 00:18:33,197
I will not stand here and be attacked!

342
00:18:33,197 --> 00:18:37,493
Mom, don't walk away from me!

343
00:18:37,493 --> 00:18:38,869
What do you want me to say?

344
00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:41,288
You want me to say I'm a bad mother?

345
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:42,706
Fine!

346
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:44,500
I'm a bad mother!

347
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,794
Are you happy now?

348
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:52,799
Mom!

349
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:57,888
Yes, I know what I'm getting into.

350
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:04,353
Morty, have you seen my Mom?

351
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:08,357
Yeah. She seemed pretty upset.

352
00:19:08,357 --> 00:19:11,860
I think she took a cab home.

353
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,779
Do you need a ride?

354
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:17,157
I need you to tell me the truth about my father.

355
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:22,162
Hop in.

356
00:19:22,663 --> 00:19:27,668
When I was in Korea, I was stationed
outside of Pusan.

357
00:19:29,086 --> 00:19:32,881
We'd get these passes,

358
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:37,886
and we'd go into town and have a few beers.

359
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:42,182
We used to call it R&R, in military lingo.

360
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:45,686
I know what R&R means. So what does
this have to do with my father?

361
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:47,271
That's what I'm getting to.

362
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:49,648
Anyway, there were these --

363
00:19:49,648 --> 00:19:51,567
these young ladies.

364
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:55,362
Professional ladies, if you know what I mean.

365
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:58,073
Morty, can we just move this on?

366
00:19:58,073 --> 00:19:59,157
Ok.

367
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:03,287
Long story short, it's just
I never figured that

368
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:07,583
my first time with a woman
would be in an alley

369
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:12,379
behind a Korean noodle stand

370
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:14,548
with my fatigues down around my ankles.

371
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:17,968
Ok, again .. what does this have
to do with my father?

372
00:20:17,968 --> 00:20:22,973
We've all done things that we're ashamed of.

373
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:29,271
We all have secrets.

374
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:34,359
Your father wasn't a war hero.

375
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:38,864
And he wasn't in Viet Nam.

376
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:42,284
But why would my mother tell me that?

377
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:46,955
Sophie wasn't married to your father.

378
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:51,668
I'm not sure she even knew his name.

379
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:56,673
Are you saying that I'm the result
of my mother having a one night stand?

380
00:20:56,965 --> 00:21:01,970
Well, like I said, we've all done things
that we're ashamed of.

381
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:16,568
George.

382
00:21:16,568 --> 00:21:19,071
Bree! This is a surprise!

383
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:23,450
I'm sorry to drop by unannounced,
but I just had this disturbing visit

384
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:28,455
from an old friend of yours, Leila Mitzman.

385
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:33,460
She shouldn't have contacted you.

386
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:38,465
Well, she did, and she said some
pretty horrible things about you.

387
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:40,551
You should know that she's a renowned liar.

388
00:21:40,551 --> 00:21:42,469
That's what I thought, at first.

389
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:44,680
But then, having had time to think about it,

390
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,349
I can't understand why she'd go
to so much trouble.

391
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:49,685
I mean, what would her motive be?

392
00:21:49,685 --> 00:21:51,186
She's obsessed with me.

393
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:55,065
She still wants me. Wasn't that obvious?

394
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:55,858
No.

395
00:21:55,858 --> 00:21:58,569
The woman is absolutely certifiable.

396
00:21:58,569 --> 00:22:01,864
What's more, I can prove it.

397
00:22:01,864 --> 00:22:03,073
Leila was a customer here.

398
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:08,078
Even though she's no longer welcome,
we still keep her prescriptions on file.

399
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:17,087
"Fluoxatine 100 mg, Respiradon 250 mil" ..
I'm sorry, what is this?

400
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:22,050
One is an antidepressant, for mood swings;

401
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:25,470
one is an antipsychotic, to control hallucinations.

402
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:28,849
Like I said, she's a very troubled lady.

403
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:32,769
Well, why did you date her in the first place?

404
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:37,774
In the beginning, you're blinded of flaws, right?

405
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:39,151
That's true.

406
00:22:39,151 --> 00:22:40,986
In the beginning.

407
00:22:40,986 --> 00:22:42,571
So?

408
00:22:42,571 --> 00:22:46,074
We're good?

409
00:22:46,074 --> 00:22:51,079
Yeah. Of course we are.

410
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:21,777
Your mail came.

411
00:23:21,777 --> 00:23:23,362
You said you were leaving.

412
00:23:23,362 --> 00:23:25,155
No, I said I was giving you space.

413
00:23:25,155 --> 00:23:28,283
I did. I was watching you from my car.

414
00:23:28,283 --> 00:23:31,578
Look, the guy who broke in stole ice cream.

415
00:23:31,578 --> 00:23:33,080
I don't think I'm in any danger.

416
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,165
So you can go. I don't need you.

417
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:39,962
Carlos says you do.

418
00:23:39,962 --> 00:23:40,879
Where are you going?

419
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:43,048
Shopping. Not that it's any of your business.

420
00:23:43,048 --> 00:23:45,175
You sure like to shop!

421
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:47,386
Yes, I do.

422
00:23:47,386 --> 00:23:50,556
It's all I've seen you do the past day and a half.

423
00:23:50,556 --> 00:23:54,476
All that shopping, you must be
making up for something.

424
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:55,561
Excuse me?

425
00:23:55,561 --> 00:23:57,354
You know, Carlos has your number.

426
00:23:57,354 --> 00:23:58,772
He says you're one tough cookie.

427
00:23:58,772 --> 00:24:01,775
So tough you don't know how
to deal with your feelings.

428
00:24:01,775 --> 00:24:03,151
He's a perceptive man.

429
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:07,155
He thought I was cheating with two
gay guys. You sure you want to go
with "perceptive"?

430
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:10,367
Let's see -- it's been, what? a week
since you've lost your baby?

431
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:12,077
Yeah, so?

432
00:24:12,077 --> 00:24:14,246
So I never heard of shopping out the pain.

433
00:24:14,246 --> 00:24:15,873
Why is everyone on my back about this?

434
00:24:15,873 --> 00:24:20,878
I will deal with my loss my way, OK?

435
00:24:27,676 --> 00:24:29,761
Where are you going?

436
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:31,346
I --

437
00:24:31,346 --> 00:24:33,182
I just thought I will go out and look some more.

438
00:24:33,182 --> 00:24:34,474
Maybe try the park.

439
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:36,560
In the middle of the night?

440
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:40,272
Well, he hasn't really been showing
his face in the daylight, has he?

441
00:24:40,272 --> 00:24:43,984
Or would you rather we just let
Caleb on the loose?

442
00:24:43,984 --> 00:24:46,361
He could be in trouble.

443
00:24:46,361 --> 00:24:48,864
Or hurting another girl.

444
00:24:48,864 --> 00:24:53,869
He didn't hurt Mrs Solis, Matthew.
He was just hungry.

445
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:59,875
I wasn't talking about Mrs Solis.
But you know that.

446
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:45,045
So are you still going to be my Matron of Honor?

447
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:48,048
Of course I am.

448
00:25:48,048 --> 00:25:52,344
I'm not going to pretend like I'm not
still a little freaked out. I am.

449
00:25:52,344 --> 00:25:57,349
But I did a lot of thinking about it
this morning, and I think I understand.

450
00:25:57,432 --> 00:25:59,643
You wanted to protect me,

451
00:25:59,643 --> 00:26:02,771
and you thought I needed a hero.

452
00:26:02,771 --> 00:26:04,648
I had one:

453
00:26:04,648 --> 00:26:09,653
you.

454
00:26:11,363 --> 00:26:15,367
I was so worried it would screw you up.

455
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:18,537
Well, I am screwed up. But that
wasn't your fault.

456
00:26:18,537 --> 00:26:23,542
... entirely.

457
00:26:33,844 --> 00:26:35,846
Hey, Stu.

458
00:26:35,846 --> 00:26:37,347
You busy?

459
00:26:37,347 --> 00:26:39,433
Nah, just updating my blog.

460
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:42,436
'Cause I've got an important
assignment for you.

461
00:26:42,436 --> 00:26:46,148
Great! I'm ready to take on more
responsibility around here.

462
00:26:46,148 --> 00:26:47,566
I applaud that.

463
00:26:47,566 --> 00:26:51,862
But what I need is for you to help me
prove a point ..

464
00:26:51,862 --> 00:26:53,447
to my husband.

465
00:26:53,447 --> 00:26:57,159
Ah! You want to make him jealous!

466
00:26:57,159 --> 00:26:59,244
Uh, no.

467
00:26:59,244 --> 00:27:03,165
Actually --

468
00:27:03,165 --> 00:27:08,170
I need you to kidnap my children.

469
00:27:08,462 --> 00:27:09,546
Stop hitting me!

470
00:27:09,546 --> 00:27:12,257
Ok, so what am I supposed
to be looking at?

471
00:27:12,257 --> 00:27:14,468
Just wait for it.

472
00:27:14,468 --> 00:27:17,471
I'm Ironman, and I'll make you wack!

473
00:27:17,471 --> 00:27:22,434
Ok. There he comes.

474
00:27:23,352 --> 00:27:25,437
What's going on?
- Hey, who're you calling dirty?

475
00:27:25,437 --> 00:27:27,940
I'm just trying to prove a point.

476
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,150
Hi!

477
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,860
Little boys!

478
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,945
Hell, who is that?

479
00:27:32,945 --> 00:27:35,447
It's just Stu from our office.

480
00:27:35,447 --> 00:27:38,742
You guys want to go for a ride?

481
00:27:38,742 --> 00:27:41,036
And is he abducting our kids?

482
00:27:41,036 --> 00:27:42,037
Maybe.

483
00:27:42,037 --> 00:27:43,372
This is crazy.

484
00:27:43,372 --> 00:27:47,751
Why? Are you worried they might kid in?

485
00:27:47,751 --> 00:27:49,962
We can go to the --

486
00:27:49,962 --> 00:27:52,172
carnival! You like carnivals?

487
00:27:52,172 --> 00:27:54,466
We're not allowed to talk to strangers.

488
00:27:54,466 --> 00:27:55,843
Rotten boys.

489
00:27:55,843 --> 00:27:59,263
So why don't you boys get in the car?

490
00:27:59,263 --> 00:28:00,764
Run away.

491
00:28:00,764 --> 00:28:01,932
Run!

492
00:28:01,932 --> 00:28:03,642
Get in the car, and I'll give you some candy!

493
00:28:03,642 --> 00:28:04,768
Yeah, candy!

494
00:28:04,768 --> 00:28:07,646
Why aren't they running away?

495
00:28:07,646 --> 00:28:08,272
Chocolate ball!

496
00:28:08,272 --> 00:28:08,939
Well --

497
00:28:08,939 --> 00:28:10,566
This is not the time to be smug.

498
00:28:10,566 --> 00:28:14,570
Clearly, our sons are idiots.

499
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:19,533
Ok, ok, jeez, everyone share.

500
00:28:21,034 --> 00:28:21,952
Hi.

501
00:28:21,952 --> 00:28:25,164
Hi!

502
00:28:25,164 --> 00:28:27,249
Oh my God!

503
00:28:27,249 --> 00:28:29,543
Run, kids, run!

504
00:28:29,543 --> 00:28:32,838
Don't you dare!

505
00:28:32,838 --> 00:28:37,843
You pervert! Hold on,
you're not going anywhere!

506
00:28:48,562 --> 00:28:53,066
Anyway, after we wrap this shindig,

507
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:56,153
I'm whisking my new bride away

508
00:28:56,153 --> 00:29:01,158
on a 4 month cruise around the world.

509
00:29:05,245 --> 00:29:09,166
I would have been happy with
a weekend in Vegas, but --

510
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:11,960
you know --

511
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:16,965
Anyway, here she is, my beautiful bride.

512
00:29:20,636 --> 00:29:23,764
I want to thank everyone for coming,

513
00:29:23,764 --> 00:29:28,769
and specially my Morty, who's
helped me be a better person.

514
00:29:31,271 --> 00:29:33,941
And I want to thank

515
00:29:33,941 --> 00:29:37,945
my amazing daughter, Susan,

516
00:29:37,945 --> 00:29:42,157
and tell her how much I appreciate

517
00:29:42,157 --> 00:29:47,162
her love and respect.

518
00:29:49,373 --> 00:29:52,042
'Cause I'm a horrible person.

519
00:29:52,042 --> 00:29:56,964
And she deserves so much better than me.

520
00:29:56,964 --> 00:29:58,173
Honey --

521
00:29:58,173 --> 00:30:01,552
No, no.

522
00:30:01,552 --> 00:30:06,557
Susan needs to know the truth.

523
00:30:06,932 --> 00:30:11,770
Your father

524
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:16,441
was not a one night stand.

525
00:30:16,441 --> 00:30:19,069
He was 33,

526
00:30:19,069 --> 00:30:23,532
and he was married.

527
00:30:23,532 --> 00:30:26,952
And he was my boss.

528
00:30:26,952 --> 00:30:29,746
When I told him I was pregnant,

529
00:30:29,746 --> 00:30:32,749
he broke it off.

530
00:30:32,749 --> 00:30:35,961
He never spoke to me again,

531
00:30:35,961 --> 00:30:37,462
but gave me

532
00:30:37,462 --> 00:30:42,467
my beautiful, incredible daughter.

533
00:30:42,551 --> 00:30:44,636
And for that I want to thank

534
00:30:44,636 --> 00:30:48,265
Addison Prudey.

535
00:30:48,265 --> 00:30:51,852
Oh my God.

536
00:30:51,852 --> 00:30:53,061
Do you know where he is?

537
00:30:53,061 --> 00:30:55,063
I have no idea.

538
00:30:55,063 --> 00:30:58,567
I swear, if I knew I would tell you.

539
00:30:58,567 --> 00:30:59,860
I know Addison Prudey.

540
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:04,865
He runs the feed and supply store
at 3rd and Sutherland.

541
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:11,455
Prudey is a fairly common name,
of course, so...

542
00:31:13,248 --> 00:31:16,752
Is that him?

543
00:31:16,752 --> 00:31:20,672
Yes.

544
00:31:20,672 --> 00:31:23,842
Are you saying that all this time,
my father has been alive

545
00:31:23,842 --> 00:31:28,847
and just right across town,
running the supply and feed store?

546
00:31:29,973 --> 00:31:34,937
Susan --
- I can't believe this!

547
00:31:44,655 --> 00:31:49,618
You're not still seeing him, are you?

548
00:31:58,001 --> 00:31:59,711
Something wrong?

549
00:31:59,711 --> 00:32:01,296
You've been so quiet all evening.

550
00:32:01,296 --> 00:32:05,509
No, no, I'm just tired, that's all.

551
00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:07,594
Care to dance? Might pep you up.

552
00:32:07,594 --> 00:32:12,599
I don't think so, but thank you though.

553
00:32:13,809 --> 00:32:15,394
Bree, where is your ring?

554
00:32:15,394 --> 00:32:16,395
Oh, um --

555
00:32:16,395 --> 00:32:18,981
The stone is loose, so I'm going
to take it to the jeweller's.

556
00:32:18,981 --> 00:32:22,317
But don't worry, it's safe.

557
00:32:22,317 --> 00:32:23,986
This isn't about Leila, is it?

558
00:32:23,986 --> 00:32:26,113
No!

559
00:32:26,113 --> 00:32:29,116
Just like I told you, the stone
can pop off at any second.

560
00:32:29,116 --> 00:32:32,578
Well, I don't care. Please put it on.

561
00:32:32,578 --> 00:32:33,495
What?

562
00:32:33,495 --> 00:32:35,414
I want you to wear it.

563
00:32:35,414 --> 00:32:37,207
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to.

564
00:32:37,207 --> 00:32:38,083
Why not?

565
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:40,502
Because I don't feel like it.

566
00:32:40,502 --> 00:32:43,714
And this is the last time we're going to talk about this, ok?

567
00:32:43,714 --> 00:32:48,677
Excuse me, Ma'am, we don't allow
members of Zeta Beta Kappa in here.

568
00:32:49,595 --> 00:32:52,014
Ty! Ty Grant!

569
00:32:52,014 --> 00:32:54,099
Oh boy!

570
00:32:54,099 --> 00:32:55,517
What are you doing in town?

571
00:32:55,517 --> 00:32:56,518
Visiting my folks.

572
00:32:56,518 --> 00:32:58,103
Oh my goodness!

573
00:32:58,103 --> 00:33:02,107
George, this is Ty Grant. We used
to date in college.

574
00:33:02,107 --> 00:33:04,693
Ty, this is George, um --

575
00:33:04,693 --> 00:33:06,195
he's a good friend of mine.
- Hi.

576
00:33:06,195 --> 00:33:11,200
Actually, we're engaged.

577
00:33:11,783 --> 00:33:13,994
Bree, you look fantastic.
You haven't aged a day.

578
00:33:13,994 --> 00:33:16,413
Ty, would you like to dance?

579
00:33:16,413 --> 00:33:19,500
Sure. I'd love to.

580
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:24,505
Let me take your coat.

581
00:33:59,915 --> 00:34:01,500
I need to cut in.

582
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,584
George!

583
00:34:02,584 --> 00:34:04,503
Would you please sit down?
You're being rude.

584
00:34:04,503 --> 00:34:05,295
Am I in the middle of something?

585
00:34:05,295 --> 00:34:06,880
Well, at least put on the ring.

586
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,091
No!

587
00:34:09,091 --> 00:34:10,008
George, I don't want to!

588
00:34:10,008 --> 00:34:12,094
We are engaged! You have to wear it!

589
00:34:12,094 --> 00:34:12,386
George --

590
00:34:12,386 --> 00:34:13,095
Hey, knock it off, man!

591
00:34:13,095 --> 00:34:18,100
Drop it!

592
00:34:22,479 --> 00:34:23,689
I'm sorry.

593
00:34:23,689 --> 00:34:27,985
I just --

594
00:34:27,985 --> 00:34:29,611
We're engaged.

595
00:34:29,611 --> 00:34:31,405
See, the thing is --

596
00:34:31,405 --> 00:34:33,991
I don't think we are anymore.

597
00:34:33,991 --> 00:34:35,117
Bree.

598
00:34:35,117 --> 00:34:35,617
Please --

599
00:34:35,617 --> 00:34:40,581
You should go.

600
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:49,882
I'm sorry.

601
00:35:05,689 --> 00:35:09,318
All right.

602
00:35:09,318 --> 00:35:14,281
Right over there, Sir. Management
likes us to keep the nice cars out front.

603
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:42,017
Afternoon!

604
00:35:42,017 --> 00:35:43,018
New hairdo?

605
00:35:43,018 --> 00:35:44,394
- So what if it is?

606
00:35:44,394 --> 00:35:47,105
Looks nice, that's all.

607
00:35:47,105 --> 00:35:48,398
You know, I also got a facial,

608
00:35:48,398 --> 00:35:51,693
and later on, I'm going to get a pedicure
and an eyebrow wax, so there!

609
00:35:51,693 --> 00:35:52,903
That's fine with me.

610
00:35:52,903 --> 00:35:55,197
No, it's not. Because I know
what you're thinking.

611
00:35:55,197 --> 00:35:55,906
Yeah?

612
00:35:55,906 --> 00:35:59,284
You know what? I'm tired of you
judging me.

613
00:35:59,284 --> 00:36:02,287
What is it going to take to get rid
of you?

614
00:36:02,287 --> 00:36:03,705
What's your last name?

615
00:36:03,705 --> 00:36:06,416
Ramos.
- Ramos.

616
00:36:06,416 --> 00:36:08,710
Here is $1,000.

617
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:11,588
I won't tell Carlos you didn't stick around.

618
00:36:11,588 --> 00:36:14,091
It'll be our little secret.

619
00:36:14,091 --> 00:36:17,803
I just got out of prison. I'm not exactly
set up with a bank account.

620
00:36:17,803 --> 00:36:20,514
Can we go to your bank and cash this?

621
00:36:20,514 --> 00:36:22,099
And then you'll leave?

622
00:36:22,099 --> 00:36:26,895
Hey, it's a grand!

623
00:36:26,895 --> 00:36:31,191
Buckle up!

624
00:36:31,191 --> 00:36:33,193
You don't have a -- a window thingie.

625
00:36:33,193 --> 00:36:37,781
Nope.

626
00:36:37,781 --> 00:36:41,785
You don't have a door handle either.

627
00:36:41,785 --> 00:36:45,205
Nope.

628
00:36:45,205 --> 00:36:49,084
But I do have a confession to make.

629
00:36:49,084 --> 00:36:54,089
Carlos didn't really send me to protect you.

630
00:37:07,436 --> 00:37:11,523
Go figure, no one else in the park.

631
00:37:11,523 --> 00:37:13,817
We got it all to ourselves.

632
00:37:13,817 --> 00:37:18,822
Perfect.

633
00:37:26,914 --> 00:37:29,249
Why don't you go find us a good spot?

634
00:37:29,249 --> 00:37:34,254
I got to get something out of the trunk.

635
00:37:43,514 --> 00:37:48,519
Hey, where the hell are you going?

636
00:37:49,853 --> 00:37:52,314
You're not going to kill me?

637
00:37:52,314 --> 00:37:56,026
I hadn't planned on it.

638
00:37:56,026 --> 00:37:57,152
Besides,

639
00:37:57,152 --> 00:37:59,446
if I was going to kill you,
I wouldn't use a balloon.

640
00:37:59,446 --> 00:38:01,031
Would take too long.

641
00:38:01,031 --> 00:38:02,324
What am I supposed to think?

642
00:38:02,324 --> 00:38:03,450
You lie about protecting me,

643
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:07,246
and then you lock me in that heap without
door handles so I can't get out!

644
00:38:07,246 --> 00:38:09,915
Carlos sent me to help you with your grief.

645
00:38:09,915 --> 00:38:11,416
You're kidding, right?

646
00:38:11,416 --> 00:38:13,752
No!

647
00:38:13,752 --> 00:38:15,921
Look, I know a little something about loss.

648
00:38:15,921 --> 00:38:18,131
Can take you to some real dark places.

649
00:38:18,131 --> 00:38:20,717
Specially if you don't face it head on.

650
00:38:20,717 --> 00:38:24,930
Like 17 years in a 6'x10' prison cell.

651
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:29,017
Dark.

652
00:38:29,017 --> 00:38:31,228
What's this for?

653
00:38:31,228 --> 00:38:34,439
The balloon represents the spirit of the life lost.

654
00:38:34,439 --> 00:38:36,149
By letting it go,

655
00:38:36,149 --> 00:38:38,443
you're acknowledging the pain you feel,

656
00:38:38,443 --> 00:38:41,947
and releasing it at the same time.

657
00:38:41,947 --> 00:38:43,615
That's ridiculous.

658
00:38:43,615 --> 00:38:46,952
Besides, I don't feel what
you think I'm feeling.

659
00:38:46,952 --> 00:38:49,746
Then it should be really easy.

660
00:38:49,746 --> 00:38:51,748
Fine. If I do this, will you go?

661
00:38:51,748 --> 00:38:56,753
Yeah.

662
00:38:57,337 --> 00:38:58,213
Ok.

663
00:38:58,213 --> 00:38:59,923
Should I say something?

664
00:38:59,923 --> 00:39:01,133
If you want to.

665
00:39:01,133 --> 00:39:02,426
Not really, no.

666
00:39:02,426 --> 00:39:07,431
That's cool.

667
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:18,025
Anytime.

668
00:39:22,446 --> 00:39:26,325
It's stupid.

669
00:39:26,325 --> 00:39:28,952
I didn't even want this baby.

670
00:39:28,952 --> 00:39:33,415
Yeah.

671
00:39:33,415 --> 00:39:36,335
And I would have been a terrible mother.

672
00:39:36,335 --> 00:39:41,340
If you say so.

673
00:39:44,426 --> 00:39:47,221
If it was a boy, I was going
to name it Charlie.

674
00:39:47,221 --> 00:39:51,934
Yeah?

675
00:39:51,934 --> 00:39:54,436
And a girl, Aurora.

676
00:39:54,436 --> 00:39:59,441
Those are nice names.

677
00:40:08,826 --> 00:40:13,831
Thank you.

678
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:49,324
What is it, boy?

679
00:41:08,343 --> 00:41:09,720
What's going on out here?

680
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,429
Call the police!

681
00:41:10,429 --> 00:41:12,139
You need me zappin' him?

682
00:41:12,139 --> 00:41:17,144
Just call the police!

683
00:41:23,442 --> 00:41:25,444
Is that the guy who broke into your house?

684
00:41:25,444 --> 00:41:30,449
Uh, I don't know, I can't see him.

685
00:41:32,117 --> 00:41:34,119
Yeah, that's him.

686
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:39,124
In a world filled with darkness,
we all need some kind of light.

687
00:41:41,251 --> 00:41:42,753
Whether it's a great flame

688
00:41:42,753 --> 00:41:47,716
that shows us how to win back
what we've lost,

689
00:41:47,841 --> 00:41:52,721
or a powerful beacon intended
to scare away potential monsters,

690
00:41:52,721 --> 00:41:55,933
2, 4, 6, 8, you are...

691
00:41:55,933 --> 00:41:59,019
or a few glowing bulbs

692
00:41:59,019 --> 00:42:00,938
that reveal to us

693
00:42:00,938 --> 00:42:05,943
the hidden truth of our past.

694
00:42:06,527 --> 00:42:11,532
We all need something to help us
get through the night.

695
00:42:13,617 --> 00:42:18,330
Even if it's just the tiniest glimmer..

696
00:42:18,372 --> 00:42:20,040
of hope
