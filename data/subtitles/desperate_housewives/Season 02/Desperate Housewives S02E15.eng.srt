Why don't i just marry you?

3
00:00:06,215 --> 00:00:07,841
i've got
a fantastic health plan.

4

<i>(mary alice) susan got an offer

you've had too much to drink.
give me your keys.

<i>bree rejected

8
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,394
i want to have a baby

<i>gaby gave carlos the answer

oh, who is it?
that guy.

12
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:30,197
<i>and zach began to put

00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:39,456
<i>the punishment
should fit the crime.</i>

15
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:41,667

<i>when she discovered
her husband karl</i>

it was appropriate</i>

23
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:13,740
<i>susan was reunited with karl
once again...</i>

24
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:15,993
susan,
are you listening to me?

25
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:18,662
<i>as partners
in a crime of their own.</i>

26
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:21,123
this is insurance fraud.
we could both go to jail.

27
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:23,333
now we can't tell "anyone"
we're getting married.

28
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:25,335
i know.
i was listening to you.

29
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:27,212
now the prenup's
all set.

30
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:29,214
you can sign it
at the courthouse.

31
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:30,674
11:30, wednesday morning.
right?

32
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:32,676
right. and your surgery's
still on for thursday?

33
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:36,221
yep.
good. the insurance kicks in
the minute we say "i do."

34
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:37,931
you're set to go.

35
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:41,059
i know no one's asking me,
but i think this whole thing

36
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,561
is a tragic mistake,

37
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:45,355
and i just don't have it in me
to survive another ugly divorce.

38
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:46,899
don't worry, honey.

39
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:49,526
this time, it is strictly
a business arrangement.
it better be,

40
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,695
'cause if i see so much
as one lingering gaze

41
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:53,697
between the two of you,
i swear i'll go

42
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:55,699
to the insurance company
and turn you in.

43
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:58,869
so we shouldn't expect
a wedding gift, huh?

44
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:01,246
oh, can you grab me
your wedding ring?

45
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:03,457
i wanna get it cleaned
before the ceremony.

46
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:06,543
uh... is that
really necessary?

47
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:09,546
i mean, do we have to do
the whole ring thing?

48
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:11,590
of course we do.
it's gotta look believable.

49
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,383
yeah, okay.

50
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:16,386
well, i'll just grab something
out of my jewelry box.

51
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:18,430
susan, that ring
was my grandmother's.

52
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:21,683
one day it's gonna be julie's.
where is it?

53
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:24,603
i don't know...

54
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:25,854
exactly.

55
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:29,024
that was a family heirloom.
i trusted you with it.

56
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:32,528
well, i trusted you not to
cheat on me and break my heart.

57
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:35,280
oh, my god. oh, my god.
what--what did you do with it?

58
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,866
i threw it out my car window
somewhere on route 7.

59
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:40,035
what?! when?

60
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:41,662
the night
you abandoned me.

61
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,247
suz--

62
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,249
karl, you are "so" not allowed
to get angry.

63
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,751
i mean, i might've been the one
to throw away the wedding ring,

64
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:49,503
but you threw away
the whole marriage.

65
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:52,464
there was plenty of bad behavior
that went on back then,

66
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:54,299
so just geoff
your high horse.

67
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,301
we're on the same page now,

68
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:59,346
so we should
just focus on that.

69
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:07,271
<i>yes, susan mayer
believed the punishment</i>

70
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,814
<i>should fit the crime.</i>

71
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:11,984
karl, i think
there might be snakes in here.

72
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:15,988
we're not leaving here
until you find that ring.

73
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,282
<i>but for that matter,
so did karl.</i>

74
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:24,288
and ford motor c--
built for the road ahead.

just chat for a minute.

85

so i haven't seen you
in a while.

86
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:11,084
well, i didn't wanna come here
because i was afraid

87
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,587
it would drudge up memories
of my husband.

88

pharmacists.

he committed suicide.

a little too much wine tonight.

yeah, well, you don't seem
terribly shocked.

i'm watching them.

tom called,
said you both got pulled

126
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:15,185
into work for the weekend,
asked me to ba-sit.
really?

127
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:17,646
i thought it'd be nice
if i gave 'em back to you alive.

oh, hey,
mrs. mccluskey.

129
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,233

sure.
thanks.

133
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,911

you're part of the thing.

134
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,585
a million teenagers
in this neighborhood,

135
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:41,962
and you hire mccluey?
what's the big deal?

136
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:43,881
well, for starters,
she's ancient!

137
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:46,133
(lowers voice) shh!
this is a thin door!

138
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,635
it was not that long ago
that she keeled over

139
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:50,512
in her front yard. a day with
our kids will finish the job.

140
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:52,264
it's only for a few hours.

141
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:54,224
plus, parker's on a play date
with the farrells,

142
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:56,476
so it's just
the twins and penny.

143
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:58,896
"just" the twins and penny?

144
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:00,981
okay, that was stupid.

145
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,983
let me try that another way.

146
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,986
we have to be at work
in one hour.

147
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:07,988
there's no day care
on the weekends,

148
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,365
so you cut mccluskey loose,
"we're" stuck.

149
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:11,867
we will find someone--

150
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:14,369
someone who doesn't remember
what they were doing

151
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:16,288
the day lincoln was shot.

152
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:20,417
fine.
let's go break the news.

153
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:22,920
my wife has something
to tell you.

154
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,549
so here's the deal.

155
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:29,676
um, there was
a little miscommunication,

156
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:32,638
and as it turns out,
we don't need ya.

157
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:36,934
okay. fine.
i'll just go back home.

158
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:38,936
okay. sorry.

159
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:42,231
by the way,
your husband was right.

160
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:44,233
it's a thin door.

161
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:09,049
carlos,
"what" are you doing?

162
00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:13,512
hello, gabriela.

163
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:15,013
oh.

164
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,807
hi, mom.

165
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:23,605
i just told carlos
i just "had" to take a shower.

166
00:09:23,856 --> 00:09:26,525
the man next to me on the plane
weighed 300 pounds,

167
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:29,528
and he sweated all over me.
ugh, it was so gross.

168
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,530
no, i'm just surprised
you're here.

169
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:33,031
it's valentine's day.

170
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,576
don't you and mr. hedge fund
have plans?

171
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:37,578
i know carlos and i do.

172
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:40,164
no, i left charles.

173
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:41,999
what?
mm-hmm.

174
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,168
he was worth,
like, $6 million.

175
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:45,752
money is not everything,
gabriela.

176
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:47,254
for some people,

177
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:49,423
but we're talking
about you now, mother.

178
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,425
you know,
i cat believe this.

179
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:53,427
i mean, i just went through
a terrible breakup,

180
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:56,263
and the least you could do
is pretend to care.

181
00:09:56,305 --> 00:10:00,434
well, of course weeel awful
about it, don't we, gabrielle?

182
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:02,853
yeah, we're just
sick about it.

183
00:10:02,895 --> 00:10:06,398
well, don't worry about me.
mm-hmm. i'll be okay.

184
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,484
in fact, i bought myself
a little gift

185
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:11,737
to take my mind
off my problems.

186
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,447
really?
what did you buy?

187
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:15,115
(gasps) new boobs!

188
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,367
no peeking, carlos.

189
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:19,369
okay, mom,
put these away!

190
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:21,371
my plastic surgeon
gave me a great deal.

191
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:22,789
aren't they fun?

192
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,667
bye, carlos.

193
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:32,549
what?
i think she's charming.

194
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:35,385
okay, you can think
she's charming.

195
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:38,680
but don't forget for one second
that "she" is a monster.

196
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:44,811
did you get the gum out
from under the diamond?

197
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:45,896
mostly.

198
00:10:45,938 --> 00:10:47,731
morning.

199
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:50,275
hi!
happy valentine's day.

200
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:54,321
dr. ron,
did you spend the night?

201
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:57,616
well, uh, yeah, i got
kinda tired after the movie,

202
00:10:57,658 --> 00:11:00,118
so i asked--
it's okay. she knows
that you make house calls.

203
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:02,579
oh. um, so listen,
i've got surgery till 6.

204
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:05,249
i'll get dressed and i'll pick
you up at about 7.

205
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:08,502
we have reservations
at chez naomi.
great! i'll have

206
00:11:08,544 --> 00:11:10,504
and also, dr. cunningham's
schedule opened up,

207
00:11:10,546 --> 00:11:13,757
so if you'd like, we can move up
your surgery to wednesday.

208
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:17,010
oh, i have a wedding
that day.
on a wednesday?

209
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:19,263
uh... yeah.

210
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:23,350
um, wednesdays are becoming
very popular with brides.

211
00:11:23,392 --> 00:11:25,894
it's like the new saturday.
(chuckles)

212
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:27,896
oh. okay.

213
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:29,898
well...

214
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,692
i'll see ya tonight.
bye.

215
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:39,032
your mother is
a rotten, sneaky person.

216
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:42,911
look, i'm not too crazy about
this whole fake marriage thing,

217
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:46,248
but if you don't have
that operation, you could die.

218
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:49,126
so don't be so hard
on yourself.

219
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:50,919
you "are" a good person.

220
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:54,173
thanks, hon.
that really helps.

221
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,175
okay, now i want you
to go over

222
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,177
and slip this ring
to your father.

223
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,596
and just so you know,
if edie catches you,

224
00:12:00,596 --> 00:12:03,056
i'm expecting you
to swallow it.

225
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,938
how's the hangover?

226
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,775
i do not have a hangover,
andrew, because i was not drunk.

227
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:18,238
then, uh... how about
a little hair of the dog?

228
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,782
it'll perk you right up.

229
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:22,868
lo, for the record,

230
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:26,788
i had an allergic reaction
to my antihistamine medication,

231
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:29,791
so i would appreciate
just a little bit of sympathy.

232
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,794
why can't you just drink alone
in your room like tammy's mom?

233
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:35,380
for god sakes,
it was an honest mistake.

234
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:36,924
i thought i could have

235
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:38,926
just a little bit of wine
with dinner,

236
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:41,595
but, apparently,
my body couldn't handle it.

237
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:47,184
fine!

238
00:12:47,226 --> 00:12:49,811
if it makes everybody happy,
i will just suffer

239
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:52,814
through my sneezing fits
and my hives on my own.

240
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:55,776
there. is that better?

241
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:57,861
so basically
you would rather drink

242
00:12:57,903 --> 00:12:59,738
than to not have
allergies?

243
00:13:06,537 --> 00:13:09,790
hi. is now a bad time?
i could really use a for.

244
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:19,132
she was beautiful,
wasn't she?

245
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:22,261
yeah.

246
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,805
come on, sit down.
your breakfast is getting cold.

247
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:37,818
was my real mother
beautiful?

248
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:42,656
well, she was, uh,
attractive, as i recall.

249
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:45,325
do i look like her?

250
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:49,163
i don't know.
i-i only met her once.

251
00:13:49,163 --> 00:13:51,623
oh. well, 'cause if
i don't look like her,

252
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:54,126
then i might look like
my real dad.

253
00:13:57,337 --> 00:14:00,549
i'm getting real tired
of your morbid fascination

254
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:04,803
with two strangers who didn't
love you enough to keep you.

255
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:06,972
so, please,
stop asking about them.

256
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:12,227
it's only natural that i'd wanna
talk about my birth parents.

257
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:15,022
well, it may be natural,

258
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:17,024
but it certainly
isn't polite.

259
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:18,525
(turns newspaper page)

260
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,989
(sullivan) and once
your daughter was dead,

261
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:26,116
they had to get rid
of her somehow.

262
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:28,744
that's where
the toy chest came in.

263
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:30,621
flash forward 15 years,

264
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:33,999
the chest washes up
on the shore of rockwater lake.

265
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,960
any forensic evidence
is long gone,

266
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,254
and the youngs
get away with murder.

267
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:42,257
now, of course,
the wife, mary alice,

268
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:44,843
is already dead, but...

269
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:47,638
paul young's
a different matter.

270
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:51,558
if you'd like me
to deal with him,

271
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:54,603
just say the word.

272
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:58,398
delfino's bringing
my grandson here.

273
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,443
i wanna
get the kid something.

274
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:04,154
you know anything
about those mp3 things?

275
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:09,952
yeah, they're real nice.
i'd go with that.

276
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:14,414
ah, he's probably
got one already.

277
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:16,416
paul young
has had 16 years

278
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,752
to get my grandkid
anything he wants.

279
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:24,132
do me a favor, will ya?
yeah.

280
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:26,760
see to it that paul young

281
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:30,347
has a toy chest
of his very own.

282
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:46,280
karl!

283
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:49,741
(karl) yeah?
this place
is a freakin' pigsty.

284
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:51,910
would you get down here
and help me?

285
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,121
all right, hold on,
it's almost halftime.

286
00:15:54,163 --> 00:15:55,956
by the way,
i made dinner reservations

287
00:15:55,998 --> 00:15:58,041
at chez naomi tonight,
if that's okay.

288
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,294
(sighs) it's gotta be better
than that rathole

289
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:02,713
you took me to
on new year's.

290
00:16:02,713 --> 00:16:05,007
and don't even "think"
of getting me carnations again.

291
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:07,467
that crap might have flown
for mayer.

292
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:09,469
(lowers voice)
i actually have taste.

293
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:11,180
come on! move it!

294
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:23,317
(karl)
all right, i'm coming.

295
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:25,444
no! no, no, no.
sit and watch the game.

296
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,446
i was just giving you
a hard time.

297
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:30,324
you'd had a tough week.

298
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:33,452
boys...

299
00:16:33,494 --> 00:16:35,954
can you just keep it dow
just a little bit?

300
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:37,956
because i have a very...

301
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:40,751
uh, special type
of grown-up headache.

302
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:44,546
we need to see mommy and daddy.
we wanna play 'em our song.

303
00:16:44,588 --> 00:16:46,048
honey, you can't.
they're at work.

304
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:48,550
well, can we play it
for you?

305
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:55,224
sure. (sighs)

306
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:57,601
just--just a moment,
okay?

307
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:04,608
all right, boys,
let's have it.

308
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,578
when i heard that you two
wanted to try for another child,

309
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:18,080
i was delighted.

310
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,707
but i had some cause
for concern.

311
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:23,544
gabrielle, you suffered
some extensive injuries

312
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:25,045
during your fall
last month,

313
00:17:25,087 --> 00:17:28,632
and the test confirmed
there are complications.

314
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:32,553
you can't have kids?

315
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:34,847
well, the doctor's not
100% positive,

316
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:36,515
but it's very,
very iffy.

317
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:38,016
carlos, i am so sorry.

318
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:40,477
i know how much
you wanted to be a dad.

319
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:41,979
thanks.

320
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,232
don't be so suicidal.
we can always adopt.

321
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:48,235
i wanted to have a child
of our own. you know that.

322
00:17:48,277 --> 00:17:50,195
what does it matter
whose d.n.a. it is?

323
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:52,197
the diapers are still gonna
smell the same regardless.

324
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:54,533
i'd just prefer
not to adopt. okay?

325
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:58,036
fine. what about surrogacy?
i mean, i know it's pricey,

326
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:00,831
but at least the baby
would look like us,

327
00:18:00,873 --> 00:18:02,875
and i wouldn't get
stretch marks. it's a win-win.

328
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:05,794
great. so then we have
some stranger off the street

329
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:08,172
giving birth to our child.
is that what you really want?

330
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:10,048
what i want
is for you to lighten up.

331
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:12,426
we don't have
a lot of options,

332
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:15,846
and you're gonna
have to pick one.
i-i have a thought. mm?

333
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:17,806
well, it's, uh,
a little bit controversial,

334
00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:19,808
but, uh, go with me.

335
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,810
well, first of all,
let me tell you,

336
00:18:21,852 --> 00:18:23,979
that i am in the best shape
of my life.

337
00:18:24,021 --> 00:18:25,355
so?

338
00:18:25,397 --> 00:18:29,109
so... what if i was
your surrogate?

339
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:33,447
yeah, i know. i know
it might sound a little crazy,

340
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:36,074
but i am the only one
in the world

341
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:39,077
that you can trust
to put the baby's needs first.

342
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:41,872
you know, i'll exercise more,
i'll eat better--

343
00:18:41,914 --> 00:18:44,041
mother, no!

344
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,209
why?

345
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,086
off the top of my head,
you're on medicare?

346
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:51,590
i am only fifty... one.

347
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:54,176
you know, and there's this woman
in england last year.

348
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:56,678
she was 63 years old,
and she gave birth

349
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,013
to her own grandchild.

350
00:18:58,055 --> 00:19:00,682
look, i don't care if she shot
triplets out of her ass.

351
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:03,143
it's not gonna happen.

352
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:05,812
can you believe this?

353
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:08,273
how'd that
england baby turn out?

354
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:10,984
i mean, it didn't have, like,
a big head or anything, did it?

355
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:13,779
carlos, you are not
seriously considering this.

356
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,280
well,
think about it, gaby.

357
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:17,241
this way, the surrogate wouldn't
be some impersonal incubator.

358
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:20,452
there'd be a family tie.
(scoffs)

359
00:19:21,954 --> 00:19:25,833
i have a migraine.
i'm gonna go lay down upstairs.

360
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:27,334
then when i get up,

361
00:19:27,376 --> 00:19:30,295
i hope we can all talk about
this like rational human beings.

362
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:34,383
carlitos, don't worry.

363
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:39,471
just give her time.
she'll come around.

364
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,851
boys?

365
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:29,479
boys?

366
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:35,068
okay, we're done playing
hide-and-seek!

367
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,362
boys?!

368
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:44,536
porter! preston!

369
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:47,748
this isn't funny!

370
00:20:53,504 --> 00:20:55,380
mrs. mccluskey, hi.

371
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:57,299
have you seen
the scavo boys?

372
00:20:57,341 --> 00:21:01,678
no, can't say
that i have. why?

373
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,680
i have something
to tl them.

374
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:10,604
have they signed
the contract?

375
00:21:10,646 --> 00:21:12,606
'cause if not,
somebody should call bednark

376
00:21:12,648 --> 00:21:14,733
and tell them
to adjust the language.
(man) okay, i'll handle it.

377
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:16,610
(cell phone rings)
oh. i'm sorry. hang on.
hello?

378
00:21:16,652 --> 00:21:17,986
(woman) lynette scavo?

379
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:19,238
yes.

380
00:21:19,238 --> 00:21:21,198
i believe i have something
that belongs to you.

381
00:21:27,246 --> 00:21:28,872
hi. excuse me.

382
00:21:28,914 --> 00:21:32,125
hi. you called
and you said my kids are here?
(boys) hi, mommy!

383
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:34,586
oh, my god! oh, my god!
oh, my god!
dad!

384
00:21:34,628 --> 00:21:37,256
just what were you thinking,
taking off like th?

385
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:39,800
(lynette) honey,
i was so worried about you.

386
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,803
(tom) get your stuff.
get your stuff right over here.

387
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:45,430
thank you.
thank you so much.
stay right here.

388
00:21:45,472 --> 00:21:48,267
i'm just glad i found 'em
and not some weirdo freak.

389
00:21:48,267 --> 00:21:51,436
oh, yes.
oh, yeah, me too. thank you.

390
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:53,897
because there are all sorts
of crazy people out there--

391
00:21:53,939 --> 00:21:56,608
drunks, perverts, molesters.

392
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,735
yes! yeah, no, i know.

393
00:21:58,777 --> 00:22:01,154
no! you got really lucky.

394
00:22:01,196 --> 00:22:03,615
i mean, a different person
might have called the cops

395
00:22:03,657 --> 00:22:05,033
or child welfare.

396
00:22:05,075 --> 00:22:07,035
well, uh, okay,
i know how this looks,

397
00:22:07,077 --> 00:22:08,537
but i have to tell you,

398
00:22:08,579 --> 00:22:10,956
i left them with
a very reliable baby-sitter.

399
00:22:10,998 --> 00:22:14,293
oh, ah.
you picked a real winner.

400
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:18,797
are you judging me?
because if you are,

401
00:22:18,797 --> 00:22:20,299
you couldn't say anything--
lynette, lynette!

402
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:22,509
what?!
let it go.

403
00:22:22,551 --> 00:22:24,511
the kids walked
for 3 miles to get here.

404
00:22:24,553 --> 00:22:26,638
we don't have
a leg to stand on.

405
00:22:28,432 --> 00:22:30,976
well, thank you so much!

406
00:22:31,018 --> 00:22:32,811
(tom) here we go.

407
00:22:37,983 --> 00:22:40,527
hey...
i don't know about you,

408
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:43,030
but i am tired of all
the tension around here,

409
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:46,241
so i was thinking we could
go shopping, have some fun.

410
00:22:46,283 --> 00:22:49,036
then maybe later we can talk
about the surrogacy thing,

411
00:22:49,036 --> 00:22:51,455
see if we can
make it work.

412
00:22:51,497 --> 00:22:52,623
oh, gabriela!

413
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:54,708
oh, you'll see...

414
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:57,628
this is the best thing
for the entire family.

415
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:06,303
so where's the boutique?

416
00:23:06,345 --> 00:23:08,764
oh, it's in
the hotel lobby.

417
00:23:08,764 --> 00:23:10,766
so go ahead,
i'm right behind ya.

418
00:23:10,766 --> 00:23:12,643
okay.

419
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:20,734
(doors lock, engine starts)

420
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:22,486
what are you doing?

421
00:23:22,528 --> 00:23:24,071
i'm going home.

422
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:26,240
what?

423
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:28,367
i thought
we were gonna talk about

424
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:30,369
how the surrogacy will work.

425
00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:32,704
here's how it's gonna work--
you're gonna check yourself

426
00:23:32,746 --> 00:23:35,165
into the hotel,
and then tomorrow,

427
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:37,167
you're gonna plant your
childbearing hips on a plane,

428
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:39,336
and you're gonna
leave our lives forever.

429
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:44,299
i'm pulling out.
watch your boobs.

430
00:23:57,271 --> 00:24:00,023
(lynette) come on out.

431
00:24:00,065 --> 00:24:03,861
oh, thank god! i'm so sorry.
i don't know what happened.

432
00:24:03,902 --> 00:24:06,405
i was in the kitchen cleaning up
after making cookies,

433
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:10,200
and i looked in the living room,
and they were gone.

434
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,037
we tried to tell her we were
going, but she was asleep.

435
00:24:14,037 --> 00:24:15,497
you were sleeping?

436
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:18,709
i most certainly was not.
yes, you were.

437
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:21,795
okay, all right, that lie
just lost you another week

438
00:24:21,837 --> 00:24:25,090
of tv and video game
privileges.

439
00:24:25,132 --> 00:24:27,217
that's two. you wanna
keep talking and lose more?

440
00:24:27,259 --> 00:24:29,386
then apologize
to mrs. van de kamp.

441
00:24:29,428 --> 00:24:31,305
sorry.

442
00:24:31,305 --> 00:24:33,599
all right, go back in.
no--no harm done.

443
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,601
i'm sorry. i'm so sorry.

444
00:24:41,899 --> 00:24:44,401
well, if you ask me, it's
a pretty crappy thing to do.

445
00:24:44,401 --> 00:24:46,904
did you even slow the car down
before you pushed her out?

446
00:24:46,904 --> 00:24:48,906
okay, first of all,
no one asked you.

447
00:24:48,906 --> 00:24:52,075
and the only reason you care
about my mother is because

448
00:24:52,117 --> 00:24:54,369
of that ridiculous suggestion
she offered.
i think her offer

449
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:57,956
to be our surrogate
was very generous.
generous? don't you see

450
00:24:57,998 --> 00:25:00,292
what strings?
the only reason

451
00:25:00,334 --> 00:25:02,669
she offered up her dusty womb
is because she's screwed.

452
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:04,463
her latest sugar daddy
gave her the boot,

453
00:25:04,505 --> 00:25:07,466
so mom needs a place to stay
and money. so trust me,

454
00:25:07,466 --> 00:25:10,761
if she carried our child, we'd
be footing the bill for years.

455
00:25:10,802 --> 00:25:13,972
i think your hatred for her
is clouding your judgment.

456
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:16,808
maybe, but you don't
know her like i do.

457
00:25:18,227 --> 00:25:20,270
okay.

458
00:25:20,312 --> 00:25:22,773
you ran away from home
15 years ago.

459
00:25:22,814 --> 00:25:24,775
did you ever think
to talk to her

460
00:25:24,816 --> 00:25:28,111
about the stuff that happened
between you and your stepdad?

461
00:25:28,153 --> 00:25:30,405
it wouldn't have done
any good.

462
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:32,825
how do you know that?

463
00:25:32,866 --> 00:25:34,535
because...

464
00:25:34,535 --> 00:25:36,954
she knew "exactly" what
was going on with alejandro,

465
00:25:36,995 --> 00:25:39,122
and she "chose"
to look the other way.

466
00:25:39,164 --> 00:25:41,667
but you never even gave her
a chance to step up.

467
00:25:41,667 --> 00:25:43,669
you just ran away
from home.

468
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:46,713
because if i did,
then she w--

469
00:25:46,755 --> 00:25:48,257
(crying) because...

470
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:51,009
there was a chance
she wouldn't have believed me,

471
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:53,303
and... and that
would've hurt a lot worse

472
00:25:53,345 --> 00:25:55,639
than anything
he ever did to me.

473
00:26:07,526 --> 00:26:09,862
she's your mother,
and she loves you.

474
00:26:11,989 --> 00:26:13,448
i know it's been
a very long time,

475
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:16,493
but maybe you can
talk to her about it now.

476
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:25,335
i'm getting her luggage
back to her,

477
00:26:25,377 --> 00:26:27,379
and that's the best
i can do.

478
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,228
what are you doing here?

479
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:45,772
there's something i need
to talk to you about.

480
00:26:45,814 --> 00:26:48,400
it's important.
there's nothing for us
to talk about.

481
00:26:48,442 --> 00:26:51,236
shut up and listen.

482
00:26:51,236 --> 00:26:53,697
dierdre's father,
noah taylor,

483
00:26:53,739 --> 00:26:56,533
somehow found out about zach,
and he wants to meet him.

484
00:26:56,575 --> 00:26:59,995
"somehow found out"?
like, maybe you told him?

485
00:27:00,037 --> 00:27:02,414
noah is no friend of mine.

486
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:05,459
but he's very rich and powerful,
and he's terminal,

487
00:27:05,501 --> 00:27:08,253
and he wants to meet
his grandson before he dies.

488
00:27:08,295 --> 00:27:10,464
absolutely not.

489
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:14,009
well, you'll be surprised,
but i agree with you.

490
00:27:14,051 --> 00:27:16,136
noah destroys
everything he touches,

491
00:27:16,178 --> 00:27:18,805
and the last thing
either of us wants

492
00:27:18,847 --> 00:27:22,267
is for this guy
to get his hooks into zach.

493
00:27:26,313 --> 00:27:28,273
what are we supposed to do?

494
00:27:28,315 --> 00:27:31,568
you and zach need to vanh.
just stay out of sight

495
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:34,112
until nature
takes its course with noah.

496
00:27:36,114 --> 00:27:38,700
if we leave,
we won't be coming back.

497
00:27:38,742 --> 00:27:40,869
you'll never see
your boy again.

498
00:27:43,497 --> 00:27:45,249
i know.

499
00:27:52,923 --> 00:27:55,801
well, happy valentine's day,
my darling.

500
00:27:56,802 --> 00:28:00,180
isn't that
your ex-husband?

501
00:28:00,222 --> 00:28:01,223
oh, yeah.

502
00:28:03,141 --> 00:28:06,562
oh, parently,
they'll let anyone in here.

503
00:28:06,603 --> 00:28:08,897
hi. hmm.

504
00:28:08,939 --> 00:28:11,775
your chocolate souffléS
will be out momentarily.

505
00:28:11,817 --> 00:28:13,735
oh, we didn't
order souffl?

506
00:28:13,777 --> 00:28:15,737
i ordered
as soon as we got here.

507
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:19,199
it takes an hour
to prepare.
oh, i really can't.

508
00:28:19,241 --> 00:28:21,702
no, no, no,
"this" you'll wanna try.

509
00:28:21,702 --> 00:28:24,746
it's their specialty.

510
00:28:24,788 --> 00:28:26,790
i guess
i'll have the souffl?

511
00:28:28,167 --> 00:28:30,127
can you excuse me
for a second?

512
00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:34,089
i, um... i just
have to powder my nose.

513
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:39,887
i'm sorry to interrupt.

514
00:28:39,928 --> 00:28:42,639
your makeup is all smudged.
come with me. i'll fix it.

515
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:44,641
what?
come on, get up.

516
00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:46,435
sorry.

517
00:28:46,435 --> 00:28:48,937
my makeup is smudged?

518
00:28:48,937 --> 00:28:50,772
(edie) get in here.

519
00:28:53,901 --> 00:28:56,695
i have some news that's
probably gonna devastate you.

520
00:28:57,988 --> 00:29:01,033
but i wanted to be
the first one to tell you.

521
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:02,201
okay.

522
00:29:02,242 --> 00:29:04,912
karl is about
to pop the question.

523
00:29:04,953 --> 00:29:07,456
you mean, like, marriage?
mm-hmm!

524
00:29:07,498 --> 00:29:10,167
oh, i hope i haven't ruined
your valentine's day.

525
00:29:10,209 --> 00:29:12,294
do you want a tissue?
no, no. i'm okay.

526
00:29:12,336 --> 00:29:17,090
i-i'm just... surprised.
uh, well, congratulations.

527
00:29:17,132 --> 00:29:20,844
um, what makes you think
he's gonna propose?

528
00:29:20,886 --> 00:29:22,679
well, i, um,

529
00:29:22,721 --> 00:29:25,182
i was looking through
his briefcase this afternoon,

530
00:29:25,224 --> 00:29:26,975
and i found this ring.

531
00:29:26,975 --> 00:29:29,978
and so tonight he keeps pushing
th "special dessert" on me,

532
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:33,232
so obviously,
he's hidden the ring inside.

533
00:29:33,273 --> 00:29:35,442
a ring! (chuckles)

534
00:29:35,484 --> 00:29:37,444
what did it look like?

535
00:29:37,486 --> 00:29:38,946
oh, i don't know.

536
00:29:38,987 --> 00:29:41,448
18-karat white gold,
10 diamonds, engraved accents.

537
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:44,159
i just got a quick peek.

538
00:29:44,201 --> 00:29:46,662
oh, um...
i think i know that ring.

539
00:29:46,703 --> 00:29:49,706
that's his grandmother's ring.
it's a family heirloom.

540
00:29:49,748 --> 00:29:51,208
and, you know,

541
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:54,002
he might just be having it
cleaned or something.

542
00:29:54,002 --> 00:29:56,004
except for one thing--

543
00:29:56,046 --> 00:29:59,383
lying right next to it...

544
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:01,468
was a prenup!

545
00:30:01,468 --> 00:30:05,973
oh.
well, karl is a lawyer,

546
00:30:06,014 --> 00:30:11,061
and it could just be a prenup
for another client.

547
00:30:11,103 --> 00:30:15,732
boy, jealousy is
one ugly thing up close.

548
00:30:15,774 --> 00:30:17,985
oh, no, edie--
no, you know what?

549
00:30:18,026 --> 00:30:20,237
i'm gonna take
the high road and...

550
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:22,865
and i'm gonna ignore
your nastiness.

551
00:30:22,906 --> 00:30:26,869
if you'll excuse me,
i'm going back to my table

552
00:30:26,869 --> 00:30:28,662
and getting engaged.

553
00:30:42,926 --> 00:30:46,597
(whispers) oh, hi. um,
do you see that man over there?

554
00:30:46,638 --> 00:30:47,973
dark hair, handsome.

555
00:30:47,973 --> 00:30:51,977
i need you to slip this to him
without anybody noticing.

556
00:31:00,569 --> 00:31:02,738
god, you "never" stop.

557
00:31:02,738 --> 00:31:04,781
i told you,
i'm not divorcing my wife.

558
00:31:04,823 --> 00:31:06,783
i'm in this for the sex,

559
00:31:06,825 --> 00:31:09,536
and if you can't accept it,
then go to hell.

560
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:22,007
what the hell
are you doing?

561
00:31:22,049 --> 00:31:24,259
well, i thought you said
this dessert was special.

562
00:31:24,301 --> 00:31:26,220
when you put it
in your uth and eat it.

563
00:31:26,261 --> 00:31:28,263
what is wrong with you?
well...

564
00:31:31,141 --> 00:31:32,267
nothing.

565
00:31:39,024 --> 00:31:42,319
carlos, what a surprise.

566
00:31:42,361 --> 00:31:44,863
come on in.
i thought
you could use your bags.

567
00:31:44,905 --> 00:31:46,365
oh, yes.
the perfect timing.

568
00:31:46,406 --> 00:31:49,743
i just took a shower and needed
something to change into.

569
00:31:49,785 --> 00:31:51,745
here, leave it here.
this is fine. thank you.

570
00:31:51,787 --> 00:31:53,664
listen,
do you have a minute?

571
00:31:53,705 --> 00:31:56,166
um, because i need to talk
to you about something.

572
00:31:56,208 --> 00:31:59,336
hmm, yeah, sure. sit down.
talk as i dress. (giggles)

573
00:31:59,378 --> 00:32:03,173
i'll leave the door open
so i can hear.

574
00:32:03,215 --> 00:32:07,386
look, i was, uh, i was thinking
about your surrogacy idea.

575
00:32:07,427 --> 00:32:08,804
mm-hmm?

576
00:32:08,846 --> 00:32:10,806
and i think
it could be the answer

577
00:32:10,848 --> 00:32:12,307
to all of our problems.

578
00:32:12,349 --> 00:32:14,309
that is,
if you're still interested.

579
00:32:14,351 --> 00:32:17,896
yes! i mean, uh, i am.
(giggles)

580
00:32:17,938 --> 00:32:21,942
"but" i-i just think that
gaby will never let it happen.

581
00:32:21,984 --> 00:32:24,319
no, no. no, she can
be convinced. i know it.

582
00:32:24,361 --> 00:32:27,781
can you please, uh,
zip me up?
huh?

583
00:32:27,823 --> 00:32:31,660
my zipper! it's stuck.

584
00:32:31,702 --> 00:32:34,079
ahem.

585
00:32:35,205 --> 00:32:39,084
(giggles)
you did that so fast.

586
00:32:39,126 --> 00:32:42,504
i know someone
who works out.

587
00:32:42,546 --> 00:32:48,135
as i was saying, i think
the surrogacy idea could work.

588
00:32:48,177 --> 00:32:50,470
um...

589
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:53,724
but you and gaby are gonna
have to mend some fences.

590
00:32:53,765 --> 00:32:56,518
after such a long time,
what is the point?

591
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,103
lucia, please, hear me out.

592
00:32:58,103 --> 00:33:00,898
there was a lot of stuff
that gaby went through

593
00:33:00,939 --> 00:33:02,399
when she was younger--

594
00:33:02,441 --> 00:33:05,235
a lot of stuff
that you don't know about.

595
00:33:05,277 --> 00:33:08,071
and i think that if you went
to her and asked her about it,

596
00:33:08,113 --> 00:33:10,699
then the two of you
could finally get past it.

597
00:33:10,741 --> 00:33:12,701
what stuff are you
talking about, carlos?

598
00:33:12,701 --> 00:33:16,538
(sighs) your second husband,
alejandro?

599
00:33:19,458 --> 00:33:22,336
when gabwas 15,
he assaulted her sexually.

600
00:33:22,377 --> 00:33:24,838
is that what she told you?

601
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,925
look, i know that
it comes as a shock for you

602
00:33:27,966 --> 00:33:29,927
to be hearing it from me--

603
00:33:29,968 --> 00:33:33,764
carlos, please,
i am aware they had sex.

604
00:33:33,805 --> 00:33:36,683
but it was gabriela
who seduced him.

605
00:33:36,725 --> 00:33:38,727
excuse me?

606
00:33:38,769 --> 00:33:41,855
she was always jealous of me.

607
00:33:41,897 --> 00:33:45,067
you don't know how many times
i caught her wearing my shoes,

608
00:33:45,108 --> 00:33:46,568
trying on my jewelry...

609
00:33:46,568 --> 00:33:49,571
and i'd scream at her to leave
my things alone, but no,

610
00:33:49,571 --> 00:33:52,783
she wanted whatever i had.

611
00:33:52,825 --> 00:33:56,370
then one night,
she set her sights on alejandro.

612
00:33:57,871 --> 00:34:02,334
believe me,
no one got raped.

613
00:34:02,376 --> 00:34:06,588
lucia,
she was only 15 years old.

614
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:09,591
you know, a lot of men
have left me over the years,

615
00:34:09,633 --> 00:34:11,593
and i never knew the reason.

616
00:34:11,635 --> 00:34:15,681
but when alejandro left, i knew
"exactly" why it happened.

617
00:34:15,722 --> 00:34:17,933
gabriela made him
fall in love with her.

618
00:34:17,975 --> 00:34:21,270
oh, it took me so many years
to forgive her.

619
00:34:22,938 --> 00:34:25,607
youforgave "her?"

620
00:34:25,649 --> 00:34:27,442
but of course.

621
00:34:27,484 --> 00:34:31,530
i couldn't have offered
to carry her baby unless i had.

622
00:34:38,662 --> 00:34:41,123
(whispering) karl. karl!

623
00:34:41,165 --> 00:34:42,249
come here!

624
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,672
why didn't you answer
your damn cell phone?

625
00:34:48,672 --> 00:34:50,424
i turned it off.
what's going on?

626
00:34:50,465 --> 00:34:51,675
where's edie?
she's upstairs.

627
00:34:51,675 --> 00:34:53,969
she's been in pissy mood ever
since we left the restaurant.

628
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:56,972
i don't know
what's wrong with her.
she found the ring

629
00:34:56,972 --> 00:34:58,807
in your briefcase.
she thought you were gonna

630
00:34:58,849 --> 00:35:00,809
pop the question tonight.
oh, no.

631
00:35:01,268 --> 00:35:04,104
oh, yes. you know, this whole
fake marriage thing was okay

632
00:35:04,563 --> 00:35:06,523
when nobody
was getting hurt.

633
00:35:06,565 --> 00:35:09,484
what are we doing? it's a lie!
i lost mike over a lie,

634
00:35:09,526 --> 00:35:11,987
and now i'm doing
the same thing to dr. ron,

635
00:35:12,029 --> 00:35:13,947
and--and look at edie.
she was devastated.

636
00:35:13,947 --> 00:35:18,243
i don't thk
i can go through with this.
you can't

637
00:35:18,243 --> 00:35:20,746
how are you gonna pay
for your surgery?
i don't know.

638
00:35:20,746 --> 00:35:23,248
you know, i'll just...
i'll sell the car.

639
00:35:23,248 --> 00:35:25,209
susie, this is your health
we're talking about.

640
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:27,127
we're getting married.
karl--

641
00:35:27,169 --> 00:35:29,129
no. dr. ron
would be the first to say

642
00:35:29,171 --> 00:35:31,131
that you're dog
the right thing.

643
00:35:31,173 --> 00:35:33,509
i'll figure out some way
to handle edie.

644
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:36,345
how? how are you
gonna handle edie?

645
00:35:36,386 --> 00:35:39,056
that poor woman's dreams
exploded in her face tonight.

646
00:35:39,097 --> 00:35:41,683
you know, it's not like
you can just go out

647
00:35:41,725 --> 00:35:43,685
and buy her flowers,
and everything will be better.

648
00:35:43,727 --> 00:35:45,938
then i'll propose to her.

649
00:35:45,979 --> 00:35:47,648
well,
that's a little extreme.

650
00:35:47,689 --> 00:35:50,526
not really. i was probably
gonna do it eventually anyhow.

651
00:35:50,567 --> 00:35:52,569
obviously we're gonna
have to get a divorce

652
00:35:52,611 --> 00:35:54,571
before i can actually
marry her.

653
00:35:54,613 --> 00:35:56,698
but, uh... what?

654
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:01,495
nothing. i just...

655
00:36:01,662 --> 00:36:04,289
i didn't know that
you loved her like that.

656
00:36:04,331 --> 00:36:07,084
she's a great kid.
total package.

657
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:11,255
what's the matter, susie q?
jealous?

658
00:36:11,296 --> 00:36:13,507
(chuckles)
no, of course not.

659
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,345
well, okay,
this is good because...

660
00:36:18,387 --> 00:36:23,308
you know, if this experience
helped you to realize

661
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:25,894
your true feelings,
then, uh...

662
00:36:25,936 --> 00:36:28,146
then we did something
good here.

663
00:36:28,188 --> 00:36:31,608
yeah. i think we have.

664
00:36:31,608 --> 00:36:33,402
come here. (chuckles)

665
00:36:33,443 --> 00:36:36,405
(laughs) i can't believe
you thought i was jealous.

666
00:36:36,446 --> 00:36:39,491
it's not like i still have
feelings for you anymore.

667
00:36:39,533 --> 00:36:43,370
you're right.
i-i was just fooling around.

668
00:36:46,707 --> 00:36:49,084
so? how did it go?

669
00:36:49,126 --> 00:36:52,379
fine. i just dropped off
the luggage and left.

670
00:36:52,421 --> 00:36:53,755
oh.

671
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:01,346
mmm.

672
00:37:03,348 --> 00:37:05,559
what was that for?

673
00:37:05,601 --> 00:37:08,520
no reason.

674
00:37:08,562 --> 00:37:10,314
hey, i was thinking...

675
00:37:10,355 --> 00:37:13,400
we "should"
look into adoption.

676
00:37:13,442 --> 00:37:16,236
seriously?
mm-hmm.

677
00:37:16,278 --> 00:37:19,490
but i thought you wanted
a kid with your own d.n.a.?

678
00:37:19,531 --> 00:37:22,034
blood isn't everything.

679
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,844
hey!

680
00:37:42,596 --> 00:37:44,556
i heard ya lost
your kids yesterday.

681
00:37:44,598 --> 00:37:46,058
yeah.
(garbage can lid clanks)

682
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:49,061
it was cleared up.
it was just a little confusion.

683
00:37:49,102 --> 00:37:51,230
uh, help me out here
with something.

684
00:37:51,271 --> 00:37:54,066
what exactly is it
you look for in a baby-sitter?

685
00:37:54,107 --> 00:37:55,234
excuse me?

686
00:37:55,275 --> 00:37:57,778
well, i may be ancient,
like you say,

687
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:00,781
but i've never gotten drunk
and lost track of three kids.

688
00:38:00,823 --> 00:38:01,949
what?

689
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:03,951
i smelled wine
on bree van de kamp

690
00:38:03,992 --> 00:38:06,119
when she was looking
for your boys.

691
00:38:06,161 --> 00:38:08,288
that's ridiculous.
is it?

692
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:10,958
yesterday i found her passed out
on her front lawn,

693
00:38:10,958 --> 00:38:13,961
drunk as a skunk.
i've known bree
for years and years.

694
00:38:13,961 --> 00:38:16,421
there's no way she was drinking
while baby-sitting my kids.

695
00:38:16,463 --> 00:38:19,508
so... just go spread your poison
somewhere else. okay?
(metal clanks)

696
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:22,094
i just thought i'd do you
a favor and let you know,

697
00:38:22,135 --> 00:38:23,095
that's all.

698
00:38:23,136 --> 00:38:24,888
okay, well, thanks.

699
00:38:30,394 --> 00:38:32,646
hi.

700
00:38:32,688 --> 00:38:37,359
you, um, you recovered from
all of yesterday's excitement?

701
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:40,362
oh, truthfully, i haven't been
able to get my mind off it.

702
00:38:40,404 --> 00:38:41,864
what a scare, huh?

703
00:38:41,905 --> 00:38:45,325
yeah, although
i-i still can't figure out

704
00:38:45,325 --> 00:38:48,120
how my boys
managed to sneak past you.

705
00:38:49,788 --> 00:38:51,832
well, you know
how boys are at the ag

706
00:38:51,874 --> 00:38:53,333
they're escape artists.

707
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:55,752
they're like lightning.

708
00:38:55,794 --> 00:38:57,296
it's just, penny...

709
00:38:57,337 --> 00:38:59,047
penny?

710
00:38:59,089 --> 00:39:01,216
well, i mean,
i just don't understand

711
00:39:01,258 --> 00:39:04,595
how porter and preston managed
to wrangle her into the stroller

712
00:39:04,595 --> 00:39:06,847
and then make it out
your front door

713
00:39:06,889 --> 00:39:08,891
without
you even noticing.

714
00:39:08,932 --> 00:39:11,935
(bottles clanking)

715
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,067
i guess
if you'd fallen asleep...

716
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:20,986
it could've happened
like that, i-i guess.

717
00:39:21,028 --> 00:39:22,488
you know, i think, um,

718
00:39:22,529 --> 00:39:24,573
i must have been cleaning
the kitchen,

719
00:39:24,615 --> 00:39:26,825
and i-i just
didn't hear them

720
00:39:26,867 --> 00:39:29,536
because of the noise
from the dishwasher.

721
00:39:29,578 --> 00:39:33,957
look, i apologize in advance
for how this is going to sound,

722
00:39:33,957 --> 00:39:36,627
but i have to ask. it's just
gonna eat away at me.

723
00:39:36,627 --> 00:39:39,338
were you drinking
while baby-sitting my kids?

724
00:39:39,379 --> 00:39:40,631
no!

725
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:46,762
oh...

726
00:39:46,762 --> 00:39:48,722
you know, i may have had

727
00:39:48,764 --> 00:39:52,434
just the tiniest little bit
of chardonnay.

728
00:39:52,476 --> 00:39:57,231
oh, gosh, you got drunk,
and you passed out.

729
00:39:57,272 --> 00:39:59,858
lynette, if i close my eyes
even for a moment,

730
00:39:59,858 --> 00:40:01,944
it's because of these
antihistamines i've been taking.

731
00:40:01,944 --> 00:40:03,111
really?

732
00:40:03,111 --> 00:40:05,739
is that why you passed out
on your front lawn

733
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:07,533
yesterday morning?

734
00:40:07,574 --> 00:40:10,536
now that you're speaking to me
in a fairly accusatory tone,

735
00:40:10,577 --> 00:40:13,038
may i remind you that
i was doing you a favor?

736
00:40:13,038 --> 00:40:15,541
you put my kids in danger,
and then you lied about it.

737
00:40:15,541 --> 00:40:17,543
doou not get
how big that is?

738
00:40:17,543 --> 00:40:19,545
do you have some
kind of problem with alcohol?

739
00:40:19,545 --> 00:40:21,463
no! the only problem i have
is with your children.

740
00:40:21,463 --> 00:40:23,924
they're incorrigible
because you let them run amok.

741
00:40:23,966 --> 00:40:25,425
and if i hadn't
drifted off,

742
00:40:25,467 --> 00:40:27,594
they would have waited
until i was in the bathroom

743
00:40:27,636 --> 00:40:29,930
or stuck on the phone
or upstairs doing laundry.

744
00:40:31,223 --> 00:40:32,891
on any given day,

745
00:40:32,933 --> 00:40:36,019
how many glasses of wine
do you put away?

746
00:40:39,106 --> 00:40:41,567
i will not be spoken to
like that.

747
00:40:41,608 --> 00:40:43,277
i just won't.

748
00:40:46,613 --> 00:40:48,282
(sighs)

749
00:40:57,708 --> 00:40:59,710
(bottles clanking)

750
00:41:02,754 --> 00:41:05,674
<i>now and then,
we allneed a little help...</i>

751
00:41:08,177 --> 00:41:11,638
<i>so we ask for small favors.</i>

752
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,433
thanks. i owe you one.

753
00:41:14,474 --> 00:41:15,934
<i>but it's always best</i>

754
00:41:15,976 --> 00:41:19,271
<i>to be wary of those eager
to come to our rescue.</i>

755
00:41:19,271 --> 00:41:21,607
well, go on.
kiss the bride.

756
00:41:24,276 --> 00:41:26,278
(chuckles)

757
00:41:28,155 --> 00:41:30,574
<i>because even the smallest
of favors...</i>

758
00:41:30,574 --> 00:41:34,578
sure thing, tom. i'd be happy
to baby-sit for you.

759
00:41:34,578 --> 00:41:37,873
my, have you noticed
how clogged my rain gutters are?

760
00:41:37,873 --> 00:41:40,626
...carries a price tag.

761
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:43,378
<i>yes, everyone has an agenda.</i>

762
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,339
i heard about your operation,
aunt inez,

763
00:41:45,339 --> 00:41:47,341
and i'm jumping
on a plane right now

764
00:41:47,382 --> 00:41:49,343
to come and help you out.

765
00:41:49,384 --> 00:41:51,345
<i>no matter what
they may tell us.</i>

766
00:41:51,386 --> 00:41:53,555
no, i'm happy to,

767
00:41:53,597 --> 00:41:58,477
and i'm prepared to stay
as long as it takes.

768
00:41:58,519 --> 00:42:00,729
<i>and in those rare instances</i>

769
00:42:00,771 --> 00:42:03,982
<i>"where there" is
no ulterior motive,</i>

770
00:42:04,024 --> 00:42:05,651
<i>we're so taken aback</i>

771
00:42:05,692 --> 00:42:08,445
<i>that we may fail
to recognize the truth...</i>

772
00:42:21,667 --> 00:42:26,964
<i>that a loving friend has just
done us an enormous favor.</i>

773
00:42:27,005 --> 00:42:29,299
