00:00:02,878 --> 00:00:04,755
Previously on desperate housewives...

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,548
Your spleen has wandered close to your heart.

4
00:00:06,632 --> 00:00:07,216
We're gonna take it out.

5
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:09,092
Get your insurance figured out by then

6
00:00:09,218 --> 00:00:10,552
<i>There was the bad news</i></i>

7
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:11,845
It's the cop I want you to talk to

8
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,013
His name is Solomon

9
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,681
The file on Noah's daughter

10
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,350
<i>The discomforting news</i></i>

11
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:17,476
Thanks

12
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:19,645
Are you hiding someone in your house?

13
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:22,439
Tell me your secret, I'll understand

14
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:23,190
OK

15
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,526
<i>and the news no one should know</i></i>

16
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:27,486
But you tell me yours first

17
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:33,992
Once a month, the crème de la crème of Fairview society

18
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:39,164
would attend a semi-formal lunch at the home of Maxine Bennett.

19
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:42,334
Everyone loves these elegant get-togethers

20
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:43,669
Everyone that is,

21
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:49,800
but a certain red headed housewife who is convinced Maxine was a liar

22
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:54,388
You see, Maxine like to brag that she did all her own cooking

23
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:58,642
and because each course was served promptly,

24
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:01,812
presented with flare

25
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,816
and it was positively mouth watering

26
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:09,570
Bree knew Maxine had had some help

27
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:13,156
and sadly for Maxine...

28
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:16,034
Bree intended to prove it

29
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:20,414
Maxine, once again, this entire lunch is just out the swirl

30
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:22,749
I just have to get the number of your caterer

31
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,126
What a nice compliment.

32
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:26,628
No, I'm afraid this is all my doing

33
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,797
This was a triumph, an absolute triumph

34
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:31,258
Oh, come on, do you honestly expect us to believe

35
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:34,803
that you had the time to prepare a six-course meal for ten women

36
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:38,348
Even I couldn't make this and have time to get ready for a party

37
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:42,519
Well, perhaps you're just not as organized as I am

38
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:46,231
If you excuse me

39
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,109
Bree, what's got into you?

40
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:51,820
I have the same recipe for English plum pudding

41
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:54,239
It takes six hours to prepare

42
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:57,701
How would you have time to make all this and everything else that we ate today

43
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,370
This's not the pudding of an honest woman

44
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,748
FBI, open up

45
00:02:02,915 --> 00:02:04,124
What on earth...

46
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,218
looking for a Maxine Bennett

47
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:15,135
I'm Maxine

48
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,054
We have a warrant. This is the premier's mail

49
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:19,681
A warrant? I'm in the middle of a luncheon

50
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:20,933
Over here

51
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:25,229
Found her

52
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:29,816
Maxine Bennett, you are under arrest,

53
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:31,860
for involuntary servitude

54
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:33,820
Is this the woman who locked you up?

55
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:49,253
Bree, what's going on?

56
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:52,756
Well, I'm not sure, but I think Maxine had a slave

57
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:57,803
I can't believe it, I just can't believe it

58
00:02:57,928 --> 00:02:59,388
<i>But Bree could</i></i>

59
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:01,682
<i>you see, for her</i></i>

60
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:05,227
<i>the proof was in the pudding</i></i>

61
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,357
Desperate housewives
Season 2 Episode 14

62
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:16,405
<i>The world is filled with unlikely friendships</i></i>

63
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:20,158
<i>Odd pairings that to the casual observer</i></i>

64
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,954
<i>make absolutely no sense at all</i></i>

65
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:26,498
<i>But if we look closer,</i></i>

66
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:29,877
<i>we can see why these alliances formed</i></i>

67
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:36,925
<i>After all, a shared purpose can give
even mortal enemies common ground</i></i>

68
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:38,510
Bree,

69
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:39,678
we have a question for you

70
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:40,888
Oh, what is it?

71
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:44,141
Well, we were just wondering, actually, we were curious about...uh...

72
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:45,809
What the hell is going on with you and Betty Applewhite?

73
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,728
Yeah, that

74
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:49,980
Excuse me

75
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:51,940
Well, from the day that dead body showed up,

76
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,777
nobody was yelling 'oh, the Applewhites are involved other than you

77
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:58,280
and the next thing we know, you are having Betty over for poker?

78
00:03:58,447 --> 00:03:59,072
What???

79
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,074
She makes it sound like we are angry, we are not angry

80
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,034
I'm a little angry

81
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:05,204
Can we talk about this later? I have ice-cream in here

82
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,497
Bree, could this flip-flop have something to do with

83
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:10,042
the fact that Daniel is dating Matthew?

84
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,086
Yeah, that would get her

85
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:14,880
Who told you that?

86
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:17,174
- Mrs. McClosky- she saw them making out in the park

87
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:18,467
- Eddie! - What?

88
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:20,344
Can't you sugar-coat a little?

89
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:24,264
I did, he had his hand down her shirt

90
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:28,602
Bree, we know that you have a good reason for wanting Betty to hang out with us

91
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:32,356
We just wondered if you could clue us in a little

92
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:35,067
When it comes to Betty Applewhite, I know what I'm doing

93
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:37,194
and you two are just gonna have to trust me

94
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:38,987
and if you can't do that,

95
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:41,406
then perhaps I've over-estimated the depth of our friendship

96
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:44,868
Now, if you excuse me

97
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,912
What a bitch!

98
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:49,790
- Eddie, can you ... - I was sugar-coating it

99
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:03,595
Oh, hey...none of that in ear

100
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:07,099
Come on, maybe if we are remind them I'm shacking up with a senior VP,

101
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:08,684
they'll stop killing all my pitches

102
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:11,353
You've only been here for a week, why don't you give yourself a break?

103
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:12,187
Honey, you know the ad game,

104
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,649
we got to serve amount of time before mockery kicks me into the curb

105
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,651
Look, I'm just asking you ...

106
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:21,196
jump in every once in a while, throw me some of the ??? on the work path

107
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:25,158
I can't protect you, you're gonna have to find a way to click with Ed yourself

108
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:30,247
And then the pig, he rubs on his stomach, and he goes...'

109
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:34,626
Farm Fresh Bacon? I'll make a piggy out of you too'

110
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,300
So...

111
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,136
the pig actually eats the bacon?

112
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:45,053
Uhuh, yeah

113
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,974
I don't see the client doing a happy dance over the whole cannibalism theme

114
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:55,063
Well,Tom, why don't you pitch them the other idea you came up with last night?

115
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:58,483
You know, the one where people love bacon so much that they wanna keep it a secret?

116
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:02,237
What, like a secret underground society of bacon eaters?

117
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:03,989
Well, like my collage fraternity where,

118
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:07,618
you know, everybody wanted in, but we only take the coolest guys

119
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,746
You were Greek?

120
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,248
-Alpha Tau Megon ??
- I was Phi Kappa??

121
00:06:13,499 --> 00:06:14,249
You?

122
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,127
And I don't remember you happened to be that cool to play JTO

123
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:19,713
Look, if I had a nickle for every fi-cap

124
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,673
that I tag 'naked' to a free way sign

125
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,717
Scavo, if you were my pledge, I'd make you my bitch

126
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:25,469
Oh, you think so?

127
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:29,556
You know what, I'm liking this whole fraternity ankle

128
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,852
Yeah, you know, let's talk about it over lunch

129
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:36,313
You're buying

130
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,775
Go

131
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:53,163
Hello, what's going on?

132
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:55,624
Gabrielle, I want you to meet someone

133
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,042
This is Xiao Mei

134
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:59,545
She's the young lady who's forced to work for Maxine Bennett

135
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,422
Oh, the slave

136
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:04,091
Wow,

137
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:05,509
looks well fed

138
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:08,011
The church is making arrangements for her to return to China

139
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,889
But until then, she needs a place to stay

140
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:13,600
So I offered her our guest room

141
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,727
Really?

142
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:19,857
Baby, can I talk to you for a second?

143
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:22,651
Oh, you nuts

144
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,152
It's only for a couple of days

145
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,907
Oh, this time, you are quickly becoming Father Crowley's go-to guy for charity cases

146
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:30,117
And that's a bad thing?

147
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,787
When he turns our house into a catholic underground ??,YES!

148
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,205
You know who you are, Gabby?

149
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,458
You are the kind of person who'd turn away Mary and Joseph from the inn

150
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:41,920
Well, they should've called ahead

151
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:52,973
Don't brush your hair at the table

152
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,516
Are you talking to me?

153
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:56,059
Does this mean you've finally forgiven me?

154
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:59,271
Why should I? You've betrayed this family and you're not even sorry

155
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:01,315
Don't be such a drama queen

156
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,358
If the Applewhites go to the police

157
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:06,028
and tell them that your brother ran over Mrs. Solis,

158
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:09,198
he could go to prison.

159
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:11,491
How can you not understand that?

160
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:14,536
They won't talk about Andrew as long as you don't go to the police about Caleb

161
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:16,538
What does this Caleb do exactly?

162
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:19,124
And why on earth are they hiding him?

163
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,417
Why don't you go to Mrs. Applewhite

164
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:24,004
and tell her you really need to know what's going on?

165
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,217
I bet if you were really nice, she'd tell you the truth

166
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:30,344
Is that what you really think, Danielle?

167
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:31,887
I should go to Mrs. Applewhite

168
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:36,016
be nice and then she'll hand over all her secrets?

169
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,559
Yeah

170
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:42,940
When I was young, my stepmother told me that I was very lucky

171
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:48,153
I possessed beauty, wit, cunning and insight

172
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,033
These four weapons all women needed to survive in the world

173
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:54,743
So?

174
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,746
So take good care of your looks, Danielle

175
00:08:57,913 --> 00:09:01,583
You don't have any other weapons at your disposal

176
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:08,549
Hi,

177
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:10,175
I need an operation on my spleen,

178
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,010
and I just found out that I ran out of medical insurance.

179
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:14,596
Is there anyone I can sue?

180
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,517
After the embezzlement Launy let the policy lapse

181
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:20,978
Now he's in jail, and I'm gonna die

182
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:22,437
Susie, you are not gonna die

183
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:24,356
I'll get into it with the insurance company

184
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:27,109
No, there isn't time for you to deal with the red tape

185
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:30,529
My spleen is going crinin into my heart

186
00:09:30,654 --> 00:09:32,072
I need that operation now

187
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,824
I'd loan you the money myself

188
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:38,120
But Eddie and I just plopped down our savings since ski condo

189
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:39,663
I don't need a loan

190
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,290
I need coverage

191
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:43,876
I mean what if there are complications

192
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:46,295
I don't have a safety net

193
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:49,047
...please...

194
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:50,799
What in the hell are you doing?

195
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:52,801
I'm saying a little prayer

196
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,136
Uh, for puke sake

197
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:57,014
What? I'm desperate here, do you have any other ideas?

198
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,266
As a matter of fact, I do

199
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:01,852
What you need is a husband

200
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:02,936
What?

201
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,606
The only way to get a good health plan

202
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:06,690
is to marry into one

203
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:08,525
Eddie, come on

204
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:12,112
No, no, I think she's onto something

205
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,781
Yeah, if we find the guy with the right plan

206
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,159
you could have a sham waiting on a Monday night, and be

207
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:18,869
fully covered Tuesday morning

208
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:20,704
I can't believe you are actually considering this

209
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:23,790
The surgeon is slicing me open a week from tomorrow,

210
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,584
what other choice do I have?

211
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:29,129
All we have to do is to find a guy who's willing to marry you

212
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:35,928
You know, come to think of it,

213
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:40,891
a little prayer might not be such a bad idea after all

214
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:50,275
Pad, we are all here, so send the call in as soon as you get it

215
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:57,908
200 bucks says you can't do that three times in a row

216
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:01,203
You catch three of those,

217
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:03,914
200 bucks

218
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,666
What do you say there, Scavo?

219
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,251
You are on.

220
00:11:07,543 --> 00:11:10,003
- Here we go.
- Ah-ah-ah-ah!

221
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,588
Thrown by me.

222
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:15,175
I'm sorry, I thought we were here to talk about the farm fresh rollout?

223
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,885
They gotta be catchable, big guy.

224
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:19,263
You just let me worry about the shooting.

225
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,306
Come on.

226
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:28,146
- that's one.
- Guys...

227
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:29,857
oh!

228
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,692
Nice moves.

229
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:32,734
One more, big guy.

230
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:36,196
Guys, please... that's--all right.

231
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:39,741
- Ow!
- Oh!

232
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:41,869
ow.

233
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:43,787
that wasn't even catchable!

234
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,372
Yeah, well, maybe not.

235
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,791
But it's totally worth the 200 bucks. Ahh!

236
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,168
Whoo!

237
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:50,919
Well, you got me.

238
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:52,754
You're a regular little monkey man!

239
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:54,965
Oh, I love this guy.

240
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:04,391
Oh. Hi.

241
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:07,519
Do you have to sit around all day?

242
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:10,189
I mean, shouldn't you be out experiencing western civilization

243
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:12,691
while you have the chance?

244
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:16,653
what are you doing?

245
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:17,738
I fix.

246
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:19,573
No, this is couture!

247
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:21,867
This rip has to be fixed by an experienced tailor.

248
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:23,202
You can't just...

249
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:26,747
holy crap! This stitching is perfect!

250
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:28,790
Hungry?

251
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:36,590
Did you make all of this?

252
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:40,177
Oh!

253
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:44,097
For me? Okay.

254
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:49,269
Oh, my god!

255
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:50,187
You like?

256
00:12:50,354 --> 00:12:52,231
I like a lot.

257
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:07,663
you like that?

258
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,915
yeah, that's nice.

259
00:13:10,082 --> 00:13:13,877
Do you know what they do to people in china who speak out against the government? Hmm?

260
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:16,296
They put them in forced labor camps.

261
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:18,131
Isn't that awful?

262
00:13:18,257 --> 00:13:19,341
Mm-hmm.

263
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:23,345
You know what I mean? It's such a repressive regime.

264
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:25,597
We forget how good we have it.

265
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:27,266
Yes, we do.

266
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:31,854
Don't you think xiao-mei would like it better herein America?

267
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:37,192
I mean, where she could learn about freedom and democracy and stuff?

268
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:40,988
Does this have anything to do with you making xiao-meido housework?

269
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:41,613
What?

270
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:43,657
I came downstairs this morning and found her waxing the floor.

271
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:46,034
She told me you asked her to put on two coats.

272
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:48,662
Well, first of all, that was her idea.

273
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:52,291
Second of all, I can't have this conversation until you've tasted her crab puffs.

274
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,209
Oh...

275
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:00,966
She just got done being a slave.

276
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:03,177
I mean, she wants to go back to china...

277
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:06,013
and we can't force her to stay here and be our maid.

278
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,016
Well, who's forcing her? We'll pay her whatever she wants.

279
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:11,018
And the best part is, with her résumé?

280
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:13,020
any wage will look good.

281
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:15,939
No way, baby. Mnh-mnh.

282
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:22,654
What?

283
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:26,408
What? What, so you don't get what you want, you just walk off and pout?

284
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:27,951
Oh, this isn't about me.

285
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:29,536
This is about our great nation.

286
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:33,332
And I have no intention of sexually satisfying a man who isn't willing to stand up for

287
00:14:33,499 --> 00:14:38,295
and help spread the ideals and values of the united states of America.

288
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:44,968
And sometimes she is a little hard to stomach, but she means well.

289
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:45,594
Well, that's--

290
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:47,054
hi! Oh, here she is.

291
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:49,139
I came as soon as I got your message.

292
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:51,308
Is this... this is Gary Grantham

293
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:52,684
your future ex-husband.

294
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:54,353
- Wow, nice to meet you.
- Hi.

295
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:57,272
Okay, listen, um, I've got to meet a client. I've got to go,

296
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:59,233
so just talk amongst yourselves, and

297
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,778
you two make a very handsome couple.

298
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:05,197
Oh. Yeah.

299
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:08,492
Uh,- hi.- hi.

300
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:10,160
So do you wanna get married on Wednesday?

301
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:12,120
'Cause Thursday and Friday I'm out of town.

302
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:16,458
Oh! Oh, yeah. Sure, that's--Wednesday's great.

303
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:17,751
I'm--I'm just curious...

304
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:20,963
how did Eddie convince you to do this so quickly?

305
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,756
Well, she explained your situation to me.

306
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:25,259
I'm sort of in need of a fake bride myself, so I figured,

307
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:26,760
what the heck?

308
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:28,428
Why would you need a fake bride?

309
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:31,807
Uh, I'm gay, and I've never come out to my mother.

310
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:33,392
- Really?
- Yeah.

311
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:35,394
At first, I just didn't want to upset her.

312
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:37,688
Then she got older, she got emphysema and diverticulitis,

313
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:40,232
and I started thinking, if I just kept my mouth shut,

314
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,818
then one day nature would take its course

315
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:46,238
and we could avoid what is sure to be a very ugly scene.

316
00:15:46,405 --> 00:15:48,282
So what changed?

317
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,492
She told me at her81st birthday party last month,

318
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:54,329
the only reason she's hanging on is to see me get married.

319
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:57,166
Oh. Oh, so by marrying me...

320
00:15:57,332 --> 00:15:59,835
yeah, I'd get my inheritance that much sooner.

321
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:03,714
No, but mostly, I wanna make sure she's happy.

322
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:08,844
well, you seem very nice, Susan.

323
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:12,306
Uh, it will be a pleasure being married to you.

324
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:13,765
Uh, likewise.

325
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:16,894
here, you can finish the rest of the fries.

326
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,152
Here's your mail

327
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,236
and your pills.

328
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:27,946
Ugh.

329
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:31,366
More pills?

330
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,166
Miss Tillman?

331
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,292
Hmm?

332
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:43,212
Where did this come from?

333
00:16:43,337 --> 00:16:46,006
I don't know. It was in with your other mail.

334
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:51,887
Get me the phone.

335
00:17:02,314 --> 00:17:03,607
Sullivan, it's me.

336
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:06,860
I just got some news, and I need to get you involved.

337
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:10,531
Looks like Delfino's been holding out on me.

338
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:20,165
The next morning, Bree came up with a plan

339
00:17:20,332 --> 00:17:23,502
to get to the truth she so desperately needed.

340
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,672
As she watched the Applewhites leave their house,

341
00:17:26,797 --> 00:17:30,926
she thought of how much she had trusted the previous owners

342
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:33,053
and how much they...

343
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,514
had trusted her.

344
00:17:56,368 --> 00:17:59,621
Caleb? Is that you?

345
00:18:04,168 --> 00:18:05,794
hi.

346
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:09,381
I'm bree. I live down the street.

347
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:12,009
I'm a friend of your mother's.

348
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:13,927
She's not home.

349
00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:16,013
I know. Um...

350
00:18:16,388 --> 00:18:18,682
I came to see you.

351
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:20,392
- Me?
- Yes.

352
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:22,769
Your mother told me all about you and I thought it--

353
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:24,521
it might be nice if, um,

354
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:27,107
we had a little visit.

355
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:31,778
I brought you some homemade cobbler.

356
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:39,036
oh,la,la,la,la,la

357
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:41,538
right here. Follow the doughnut, people.

358
00:18:41,914 --> 00:18:44,583
Here we go. We got some people. Come on, come on.

359
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:45,751
Hey, hey What's going on?

360
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:51,590
Well, um, Ed bet tom that he wouldn't eat a doughnut out of the toilet.

361
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:53,800
Isn't it disgusting?

362
00:18:55,177 --> 00:18:56,595
unh-unh!

363
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:58,430
It's gotta be fully dunked.

364
00:18:58,597 --> 00:19:01,099
Now, I don't want the glaze to repel the water.

365
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:03,602
Whoa, slight delay, people. I'm requesting a scrub down.

366
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,438
Does anybody know where they keep the toilet brush?

367
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:09,942
Just for one second, okay? Just for one second.

368
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:11,652
Hey, I never thought I'd have to ask you this,

369
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:13,612
but are you about to eat a doughnut out of the toilet?

370
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:14,446
Yeah!

371
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:16,281
For the Galveston jewelers account.

372
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:17,533
I don't care!

373
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:18,700
You're not gonna do this!

374
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:20,994
Look, Lynette, you're the one who told me to find a way to click with ed.

375
00:19:21,203 --> 00:19:23,288
Well, now we've got our thing,

376
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:25,207
and it's paying off for me!

377
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:27,334
That's because ed gets off on humiliating you.

378
00:19:27,501 --> 00:19:30,587
Please, don't do this!

379
00:19:30,796 --> 00:19:32,714
We're waiting, scavo!

380
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:39,221
This is my moment.

381
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:46,478
so, caleb, besides your mother and brother,

382
00:19:46,645 --> 00:19:50,482
does anybody else know that you're here?

383
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:52,401
No.

384
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:55,904
You're pretty.

385
00:19:56,822 --> 00:19:59,241
thank you. That's very sweet.

386
00:19:59,408 --> 00:20:03,078
So where have you been living this whole time? Upstairs?

387
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:05,330
No.

388
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:07,416
I just moved upstairs.

389
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,084
My room's downstairs.

390
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:11,003
Downstairs?

391
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:13,589
In the basement.

392
00:20:14,423 --> 00:20:16,550
You wanna see it?

393
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,745
Caleb, have you been down here all these months?

394
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:46,580
Yeah.

395
00:20:47,498 --> 00:20:50,459
Did your mother make you wear those?

396
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:52,044
Most of the time.

397
00:20:52,211 --> 00:20:54,588
Oh, my god!

398
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:59,134
Sweetheart, I don't understand.

399
00:20:59,301 --> 00:21:03,347
Why in the world would your mother treat you that way?

400
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:06,808
I hurt a girl.

401
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:08,852
A girl?

402
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:12,981
Yeah.

403
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:18,320
And then she died.

404
00:21:18,654 --> 00:21:20,364
Oh.

405
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:25,953
Her name was Melanie.

406
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,666
She was pretty.

407
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:34,795
Just like you.

408
00:21:41,468 --> 00:21:42,970
Hi.

409
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:50,060
I thought you should know, I'm getting married.

410
00:21:51,645 --> 00:21:52,563
To the doctor?

411
00:21:52,771 --> 00:21:54,940
No! No. Ha!

412
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:57,860
No, to--to a gay guy.

413
00:21:58,026 --> 00:21:59,611
How did you know about the doctor?

414
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:01,655
People talk. So you--

415
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:03,782
you're marrying a gay guy?

416
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:05,159
I need health insurance,

417
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:08,036
um, 'cause I've got this wandering spleen and...

418
00:22:08,203 --> 00:22:10,747
that sounds funny, "spleen wandering," but...

419
00:22:10,873 --> 00:22:13,709
actually, it's not funny 'cause it can bang into things...

420
00:22:13,876 --> 00:22:17,421
so I need health insurance, so I'm getting married tomorrow.

421
00:22:17,588 --> 00:22:20,299
And you probably think I'm crazy, right?

422
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:22,092
Well... can it wait?

423
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:23,927
Um, the surgery?

424
00:22:24,136 --> 00:22:25,220
No.

425
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:27,139
It can't wait.

426
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:31,810
I guess it's really not that crazy.

427
00:22:33,145 --> 00:22:34,771
how you doin', ma'am?

428
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,732
Susan, can you just give me a minute?

429
00:22:36,899 --> 00:22:37,983
Oh, yeah. No, I'm sorry.

430
00:22:38,108 --> 00:22:41,153
I--that was really... it.

431
00:22:43,197 --> 00:22:44,156
What do you want?

432
00:22:44,323 --> 00:22:45,949
It's not what i want, Delfino.

433
00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:48,035
It's what Noah Taylor wants.

434
00:22:48,202 --> 00:22:50,954
Where's his grandkid?

435
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:54,625
You know, let's skip the part where you don't know anything about anything.

436
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:57,211
Mr. Taylor wants to chat.

437
00:22:57,336 --> 00:22:58,462
What if I say no?

438
00:22:58,587 --> 00:23:01,340
Then I've gotta find the kid myself,

439
00:23:01,465 --> 00:23:05,928
and my guess is, he or she is somewhere around here close.

440
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:08,472
Your old girlfriend--

441
00:23:08,639 --> 00:23:10,516
she's got a daughter, right?

442
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:13,602
Maybe I should start by paying her a visit...

443
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:16,188
her daughter's not the one.

444
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:17,940
Yeah, well, given your track record,

445
00:23:18,065 --> 00:23:20,984
I might wanna check that out for myself.

446
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:26,281
Tell him I'll be therein the morning.

447
00:23:32,037 --> 00:23:33,664
Oh!

448
00:23:34,373 --> 00:23:36,208
So pretty.

449
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:40,003
You like nice things?

450
00:23:41,296 --> 00:23:42,923
that's why I think you're stupid,

451
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:45,050
for not wanting to stay here.

452
00:23:45,217 --> 00:23:47,970
You could be around my nice things all the time,

453
00:23:48,136 --> 00:23:50,347
taking care of them...

454
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:52,599
how fun would that be?

455
00:23:53,976 --> 00:23:57,062
Well, I'm sure it's a lot more fun than you'd have in that

456
00:23:57,271 --> 00:24:01,066
tiny, godforsaken village of yours.

457
00:24:03,735 --> 00:24:07,698
You know, we're probably more alike than people would guess.

458
00:24:07,865 --> 00:24:09,575
I'm from a small town, too.

459
00:24:09,741 --> 00:24:11,618
My folks had nothing.

460
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:13,620
That's why I love America.

461
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:16,582
Anything is possible.

462
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:23,463
Oh...

463
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,632
hmm, you like that?

464
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,801
No.

465
00:24:27,926 --> 00:24:30,429
An old, fat stockbroker gave this to me.

466
00:24:30,596 --> 00:24:33,140
It's not worth anything. You can have it.

467
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:39,688
Oh...

468
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,400
oh!

469
00:24:44,818 --> 00:24:47,738
It's okay. Glad you like it.

470
00:24:49,198 --> 00:24:50,908
You can brush my hair.

471
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:53,076
Oh!

472
00:25:06,548 --> 00:25:08,091
- Hi.
- Hi.

473
00:25:09,468 --> 00:25:12,846
Uh, this is the best I could do on such short notice.

474
00:25:14,473 --> 00:25:16,099
- Okay. - Okay.

475
00:25:21,813 --> 00:25:24,816
Oh, uh, Susan, this is, uh, my best man, Steven.

476
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:26,068
He's also my life partner.

477
00:25:26,235 --> 00:25:29,279
Oh, hi. It's nice to meet you.

478
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:33,116
Baby, be--be nice. Come on.

479
00:25:34,201 --> 00:25:37,329
I'm sorry you have cancer.

480
00:25:37,496 --> 00:25:38,914
Cancer?

481
00:25:39,081 --> 00:25:42,042
Isn't that the point of this whole charade?

482
00:25:42,209 --> 00:25:44,127
Gary said you needed insurance.

483
00:25:44,294 --> 00:25:46,255
Oh, yes. No, no, I do need insurance.

484
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:48,507
I just don't have cancer. I have A...

485
00:25:48,674 --> 00:25:51,760
wandering spleen.

486
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:55,138
I said it was like cancer.

487
00:25:55,305 --> 00:25:56,765
Is there a problem?

488
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,642
No. No, everything's fine.

489
00:25:58,809 --> 00:26:00,561
Uh, let's just go to the chapel.

490
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:02,688
Shall we?

491
00:26:04,273 --> 00:26:05,983
I made a wedding cake.

492
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:07,526
I hope you enjoy it.

493
00:26:07,693 --> 00:26:09,278
Oh! Uh...

494
00:26:14,032 --> 00:26:16,451
so... are we ready to get started?

495
00:26:16,577 --> 00:26:18,120
Oh, do you have a thing to play music?

496
00:26:18,287 --> 00:26:20,873
I had Steven burn a little wedding mix for us,.

497
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:21,832
for ambience

498
00:26:21,999 --> 00:26:25,127
Sure, just, um, give me a sec

499
00:26:30,174 --> 00:26:31,383
do you have a problem?

500
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,177
You said she was sick.

501
00:26:33,343 --> 00:26:34,636
She is.

502
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:36,388
She has a wandering spleen.

503
00:26:36,555 --> 00:26:39,183
It sounds nothing like cancer. It doesn't even sound real.

504
00:26:39,349 --> 00:26:41,101
Well, it is. I-I could die.

505
00:26:41,268 --> 00:26:42,352
You look fine to me, honey.

506
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:44,563
Don't do this.

507
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:48,483
I have asked you six times to fly with me to Holland to get married,

508
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,485
and you always have some la me excuse.

509
00:26:50,652 --> 00:26:54,072
But the second some chick with a silly disease comes along,

510
00:26:54,239 --> 00:26:56,283
well, you drop everything and head for a chapel.

511
00:26:56,492 --> 00:26:57,868
Oh,no,it's a serious illness.

512
00:26:57,993 --> 00:27:01,246
See, it just sounds silly 'cause of the word "spleen."

513
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:02,664
What do you want from me?

514
00:27:02,873 --> 00:27:06,502
I want you to worry about my feelings half as much as you worry about your mother's!

515
00:27:06,627 --> 00:27:08,128
What is it gonna take to make you happy?

516
00:27:08,295 --> 00:27:09,671
Not go through with the wedding?

517
00:27:09,755 --> 00:27:10,464
Is that what you're asking?

518
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:12,424
Oh,oh! No,no,stop right there.

519
00:27:12,591 --> 00:27:17,054
Okay, I would love to see you two crazy kids get hitched in Holland more than anyone,

520
00:27:17,179 --> 00:27:21,099
with the tulips and the clogs, in front of a windmill, the whole shebang.

521
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:22,935
But unless I get this surgery,

522
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:26,563
my spleen is going to slam straight into my heart and explode.

523
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:29,316
So, you know, seeing as I am just a nice person

524
00:27:29,483 --> 00:27:32,611
and I always support gay rights, let's just do this.

525
00:27:32,778 --> 00:27:34,947
And then I'll have a husband and insurance.

526
00:27:35,072 --> 00:27:37,282
Nobody gets hurt.

527
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:46,041
Steven, why...Steven!

528
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:49,002
- it's just...
- yeah.

529
00:27:50,796 --> 00:27:51,880
I'm so sorry.

530
00:27:52,047 --> 00:27:53,048
My hands are tied.

531
00:27:53,215 --> 00:27:56,009
I'm really sorry.

532
00:27:58,762 --> 00:28:01,139
Steven, wait. Steven... where are you going?

533
00:28:04,852 --> 00:28:08,063
what's love got to do, got to do with it?

534
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:10,983
Ah, finally got the sound system working.

535
00:28:12,526 --> 00:28:14,486
Where's the groom?

536
00:28:27,166 --> 00:28:29,251
Hey, susie Q.

537
00:28:30,669 --> 00:28:34,464
What's wrong? For a newlywed, you don't have much spring in your step.

538
00:28:35,174 --> 00:28:36,925
I didn't get married.

539
00:28:37,134 --> 00:28:38,468
Really?

540
00:28:38,677 --> 00:28:44,433
We got to the altar, but the whole fake wedding thing sort of imploded.

541
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:49,104
Wow. I'm sorry.

542
00:28:49,271 --> 00:28:50,731
I still don't have insurance.

543
00:28:50,898 --> 00:28:53,233
I need to get that operation. I'M...

544
00:28:56,528 --> 00:28:59,031
I'm really screwed.

545
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:02,993
well...

546
00:29:06,246 --> 00:29:08,415
why don't I just marry you?

547
00:29:08,457 --> 00:29:09,041
What?

548
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:10,792
I've got a fantastic health plan.

549
00:29:10,918 --> 00:29:12,794
You'd be covered instantly.

550
00:29:12,878 --> 00:29:16,798
But... we were actually married.

551
00:29:16,924 --> 00:29:21,803
Look,susie, I've always felt awful about walking out on you the way I did.

552
00:29:22,012 --> 00:29:24,806
And I figure, if we do this,

553
00:29:25,182 --> 00:29:28,143
I'd basically be saving your life.

554
00:29:30,145 --> 00:29:31,939
I figure I owe you one.

555
00:29:33,857 --> 00:29:35,317
Karl...

556
00:29:37,736 --> 00:29:39,363
so what do you say?

557
00:29:39,488 --> 00:29:42,658
Will you marry me, Susan Mayer?

558
00:29:42,825 --> 00:29:44,868
again?

559
00:29:47,412 --> 00:29:49,206
What the hell?

560
00:29:49,373 --> 00:29:50,833
cool!

561
00:29:58,549 --> 00:29:59,383
what are we gonna do about Eddie?

562
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:01,176
- We can't tell her.
- She'd kill us both.

563
00:30:01,343 --> 00:30:03,804
Yeah, it'll be our little secret.

564
00:30:06,849 --> 00:30:09,476
We've really enjoyed having you as a guest. Right, Gaby?

565
00:30:09,643 --> 00:30:12,020
Absolutely.

566
00:30:12,187 --> 00:30:14,857
Xiao-mei, you are a very special girl, so...

567
00:30:15,315 --> 00:30:18,026
so you take care, okay?

568
00:30:19,695 --> 00:30:21,071
Oh!

569
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:27,369
Thanks for all your help, Carlos.

570
00:30:27,536 --> 00:30:29,663
my pleasure, father.

571
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,253
- Bye-bye. - Ladies?

572
00:30:38,422 --> 00:30:39,756
please don't tell me you're crying

573
00:30:39,923 --> 00:30:41,675
just because you can't have the maid you want.

574
00:30:41,842 --> 00:30:44,386
Carlos, she wouldn't have been just a maid.

575
00:30:44,553 --> 00:30:46,930
She would have been the best damn maid ever.

576
00:30:47,097 --> 00:30:48,724
God, you're pathetic.

577
00:30:48,849 --> 00:30:50,392
Shut up.

578
00:30:51,393 --> 00:30:52,686
hey,

579
00:30:52,978 --> 00:30:55,063
something's going on.

580
00:31:04,281 --> 00:31:05,449
is there a problem?

581
00:31:05,824 --> 00:31:07,618
Well, xiao-mei doesn't want to go back to china.

582
00:31:07,743 --> 00:31:10,370
She wants to stay here and work for you.

583
00:31:10,537 --> 00:31:12,915
What? Why?

584
00:31:18,754 --> 00:31:22,466
she says mares. Solis treated her with more kindness than she's ever known.

585
00:31:22,633 --> 00:31:26,261
She now thinks of you two as family.

586
00:31:26,428 --> 00:31:28,972
Oh, really?

587
00:31:29,139 --> 00:31:32,476
Oh, of course you can stay!

588
00:31:32,601 --> 00:31:35,103
Oh!

589
00:31:36,813 --> 00:31:38,190
Gaby...

590
00:31:38,524 --> 00:31:41,193
Carlos, she thinks of us as family.

591
00:31:47,324 --> 00:31:48,951
I'm ready to hear those farm fresh concepts.

592
00:31:49,076 --> 00:31:50,494
Conference room in five...

593
00:31:50,702 --> 00:31:52,746
toilet boy!

594
00:31:55,123 --> 00:31:56,375
you are so not allowed to complain to me.

595
00:31:56,542 --> 00:31:58,210
I know. You were right, okay?

596
00:31:58,335 --> 00:32:01,213
So now I'm known throughout the advertising world as "toilet boy."

597
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,798
Tell him you're done with the games.

598
00:32:02,923 --> 00:32:04,341
You don't wanna play anymore.

599
00:32:04,508 --> 00:32:05,759
No,no,no, I can't. I can't.

600
00:32:05,926 --> 00:32:08,136
If I back down now, he'll see it as a sign of weakness. Look,

601
00:32:08,303 --> 00:32:10,097
this is the way that guys do business. But--

602
00:32:10,264 --> 00:32:11,682
so you called it.

603
00:32:11,849 --> 00:32:14,059
He made me his bitch.

604
00:32:15,394 --> 00:32:16,603
Come on.

605
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,943
Here you go. Oh.

606
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:24,236
You know, ed, I've been thinking.

607
00:32:24,403 --> 00:32:26,321
We've had a lot of fun and games around here lately,

608
00:32:26,488 --> 00:32:30,993
but maybe it's time to set a slightly more professional tone in the office.

609
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,370
Oh, I get it.

610
00:32:33,537 --> 00:32:35,289
Somebody went running to mommy, didn't he? Huh?

611
00:32:35,497 --> 00:32:36,206
What?

612
00:32:36,373 --> 00:32:37,583
Tom loses a few bets,

613
00:32:37,749 --> 00:32:40,294
so he tries to get his wife to make me back off?

614
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:43,338
Oh, this is so alpha tau.

615
00:32:43,463 --> 00:32:45,757
I am gonna make him pay.

616
00:32:45,883 --> 00:32:48,302
No. No, you're not gonna make him pay.

617
00:32:48,427 --> 00:32:51,430
You are gonna stop this now.

618
00:32:51,555 --> 00:32:52,681
This is my company.

619
00:32:52,848 --> 00:32:57,728
If people wanna work here, they play by my rules.

620
00:33:01,148 --> 00:33:03,233
- Ed!
- What?

621
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,069
I'm calling you out.

622
00:33:06,236 --> 00:33:07,654
Huh? Yes, you're right.

623
00:33:07,821 --> 00:33:10,157
This is your company, so I'll play by your rules.

624
00:33:10,324 --> 00:33:13,744
What do I have to do to get you to stop this frat boy crap?

625
00:33:13,869 --> 00:33:16,163
Shave my eyebrows? Come to work naked?

626
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:17,080
Name your stakes.

627
00:33:17,247 --> 00:33:18,040
I don't have time for this.

628
00:33:18,165 --> 00:33:20,751
Aw, what's wrong, ed?

629
00:33:20,918 --> 00:33:23,462
You afraid a phi kapp's gonna get beaten by a girl?

630
00:33:23,629 --> 00:33:26,381
Come on, big man...

631
00:33:26,548 --> 00:33:29,218
it's just a little bet.

632
00:33:33,096 --> 00:33:37,643
As you know, I think that making the workplace fun is good for morale.

633
00:33:37,851 --> 00:33:42,731
But Lynette here thinks that our shenanigans have gotten a little out of hand.

634
00:33:42,898 --> 00:33:45,275
oh, hold on. Hold on.

635
00:33:45,484 --> 00:33:47,611
I respect Lynette's work ethic.

636
00:33:47,778 --> 00:33:54,785
So we've decided to settle the matter with a little test of intestinal fortitude.

637
00:33:54,952 --> 00:33:58,121
If she can eat

638
00:33:58,288 --> 00:34:02,167
1 pound of our client's fine, farm-fresh pork product,

639
00:34:02,334 --> 00:34:04,294
raw...

640
00:34:05,879 --> 00:34:08,549
there'll be a moratorium on wagering in the office.

641
00:34:08,715 --> 00:34:10,884
oh,oh!

642
00:34:11,009 --> 00:34:12,177
I know you are doing this for me.

643
00:34:12,344 --> 00:34:13,220
You don't need to do this.

644
00:34:13,345 --> 00:34:14,680
I don't need you fighting my fights.

645
00:34:14,847 --> 00:34:16,557
I am not fighting your fights.

646
00:34:16,682 --> 00:34:18,350
This is my fight

647
00:34:18,517 --> 00:34:21,812
this is how guys do business, right?

648
00:34:36,869 --> 00:34:38,704
While we're young.

649
00:34:50,048 --> 00:34:52,593
no shame in defeat, Lynette.

650
00:34:52,759 --> 00:34:55,220
No shame at all.

651
00:35:08,984 --> 00:35:11,028
oh, she's gonna do it.

652
00:35:11,195 --> 00:35:13,489
ohh!

653
00:35:17,784 --> 00:35:19,703
oh,yes!

654
00:35:24,374 --> 00:35:25,918
oh!

655
00:35:36,595 --> 00:35:37,554
oh,this is too much.

656
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:43,227
oh!

657
00:35:46,438 --> 00:35:47,773
what?

658
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,942
She took the bet.

659
00:35:50,108 --> 00:35:52,820
What? This is fun, people.

660
00:35:54,363 --> 00:35:56,448
she's got one more.

661
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:18,595
so...

662
00:36:19,054 --> 00:36:22,474
can this be a place of business again, ed?

663
00:36:22,641 --> 00:36:25,853
- No more games?
- Sure.

664
00:36:27,145 --> 00:36:30,440
You sucked all the fun out of it anyway.

665
00:36:39,366 --> 00:36:42,619
that was really something.

666
00:36:42,911 --> 00:36:44,872
Thanks.

667
00:36:45,038 --> 00:36:47,583
Could you scrounge me up a bucket?

668
00:36:58,093 --> 00:37:01,096
Caleb said a nice, red-haired lady came to visit him.

669
00:37:01,221 --> 00:37:03,432
Come on in, betty.

670
00:37:07,352 --> 00:37:08,562
Get you a drink?

671
00:37:08,729 --> 00:37:10,397
This is not a social call, bree!

672
00:37:10,564 --> 00:37:14,109
Did you or did you not break into my home and talk to my son?

673
00:37:14,276 --> 00:37:17,905
Caleb and I had, uh, a very lovely chat. Yes.

674
00:37:18,071 --> 00:37:19,656
if you ever come near him again,

675
00:37:19,823 --> 00:37:22,910
there will be hell to pay. Do you understand?

676
00:37:25,454 --> 00:37:29,082
Aren't you gonna ask me what we talked about?

677
00:37:29,249 --> 00:37:31,001
The name,um...

678
00:37:31,168 --> 00:37:33,921
Melanie foster came up.

679
00:37:36,131 --> 00:37:38,634
I'm gonna pour you a drink now, betty,

680
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,261
because we're about to have a very honest discussion,

681
00:37:41,386 --> 00:37:45,307
and I think you're gonna need a little help getting through it.

682
00:37:49,686 --> 00:37:51,146
his name's Zach young.

683
00:37:51,271 --> 00:37:52,356
He lives with his father.

684
00:37:52,523 --> 00:37:54,691
Mother committed suicide about a year ago.

685
00:37:54,858 --> 00:37:57,194
How did he end up with these people?

686
00:37:57,319 --> 00:37:58,737
How do you think?

687
00:37:58,904 --> 00:38:01,949
Deirdre was strung out, noah. She gave him up.

688
00:38:02,115 --> 00:38:03,826
I wanna see this boy.

689
00:38:03,909 --> 00:38:06,995
Well, he's got a new family now. I can't just snap my fingers and get him in here.

690
00:38:07,162 --> 00:38:08,831
Maybe not, but I can snap my fingers,

691
00:38:08,997 --> 00:38:10,999
and detective Sullivan can make it happen.

692
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:12,167
- You don't wanna do that.
- No?

693
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:13,794
Is that really the way you wanna meet him--

694
00:38:13,961 --> 00:38:18,298
have that thug drag him in here so grandpa can give him a hug?

695
00:38:18,966 --> 00:38:22,010
Fine. You bring him. I'll give you two days.

696
00:38:22,219 --> 00:38:26,515
As you know, I'm on a bit of a clock here.

697
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:33,438
When Caleb was born,

698
00:38:33,605 --> 00:38:37,526
and the doctors discovered that he was different,

699
00:38:37,693 --> 00:38:39,736
I didn't even cry.

700
00:38:42,281 --> 00:38:47,369
It was the most painful moment of my life.

701
00:38:47,536 --> 00:38:49,872
I didn't shed a single tear.

702
00:38:50,539 --> 00:38:53,667
I just thought to myself, what's the point?

703
00:38:53,917 --> 00:38:55,794
He is my son,

704
00:38:55,961 --> 00:38:58,088
and I have to raise him

705
00:38:58,297 --> 00:39:00,340
as best I can.

706
00:39:00,507 --> 00:39:02,759
Now that's my job.

707
00:39:04,052 --> 00:39:07,055
In a lot of ways, I feel so blessed.

708
00:39:07,222 --> 00:39:08,891
Caleb is challenged,

709
00:39:09,099 --> 00:39:12,477
but he has such a sweet nature.

710
00:39:12,644 --> 00:39:16,106
I'm sure you noticed that when you came to visit.

711
00:39:16,231 --> 00:39:18,859
Yes, I did.

712
00:39:19,401 --> 00:39:23,572
I also noticed that you had him chained in the basement.

713
00:39:26,116 --> 00:39:29,203
That's because of Melanie foster.

714
00:39:31,038 --> 00:39:36,251
Melanie was a girl that Matthew dated.

715
00:39:36,418 --> 00:39:38,337
She was a debutante.

716
00:39:38,462 --> 00:39:40,923
And like typical teenagers,

717
00:39:41,089 --> 00:39:43,926
their relationship was full of drama.

718
00:39:44,092 --> 00:39:48,222
They were always breaking up and getting back together and breaking up.

719
00:39:48,388 --> 00:39:51,558
One night, after one of their big blow-ups,

720
00:39:51,725 --> 00:39:57,356
Caleb somehow convinced Melanie to meet him
down at our local lumberyard.

721
00:39:57,564 --> 00:40:01,985
I can only imagine that she thought he was bringing some kind of apology from Matthew

722
00:40:02,152 --> 00:40:04,363
but he wasn't.

723
00:40:05,072 --> 00:40:06,865
Caleb told Melanie

724
00:40:07,032 --> 00:40:09,660
he was in love with her,

725
00:40:09,827 --> 00:40:12,037
and that if he was her boyfriend,

726
00:40:12,162 --> 00:40:15,874
he would never break up with her...

727
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:19,378
and she laughed in his face.

728
00:40:19,503 --> 00:40:24,007
He tried to show her he was serious by kissing her...

729
00:40:24,466 --> 00:40:26,552
and she hit him.

730
00:40:30,472 --> 00:40:33,267
He doesn't remember a lot of what happened after that, but he--

731
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:38,146
he does know that he got very, very angry, and...

732
00:40:38,272 --> 00:40:43,193
and that there was an ax lying on the ground nearby him.

733
00:40:45,737 --> 00:40:47,197
Yes,

734
00:40:47,364 --> 00:40:51,660
my Caleb killed Melanie,

735
00:40:51,785 --> 00:40:54,872
but I couldn't let him go to jail...

736
00:40:55,664 --> 00:40:58,792
or worse, be put down,

737
00:40:58,959 --> 00:41:02,462
for what was really my crime.

738
00:41:02,629 --> 00:41:04,339
Your crime?

739
00:41:06,842 --> 00:41:10,095
It was my responsibility.

740
00:41:10,512 --> 00:41:13,056
I was supposed to protect him from himself.

741
00:41:13,223 --> 00:41:15,851
I am his mother.

742
00:41:16,268 --> 00:41:19,521
That was my job.

743
00:41:31,992 --> 00:41:36,622
<i>The world is filled with unlikely friendships.</i></i>

744
00:41:36,788 --> 00:41:38,832
<i>How do they begin?</i></i>

745
00:41:38,957 --> 00:41:42,377
<i>With one person desperately in need,</i></i>

746
00:41:42,544 --> 00:41:46,965
<i>and another willing to lend a helping hand.</i></i>

747
00:41:47,132 --> 00:41:49,092
<i>When such kindness is offered...</i></i>

748
00:41:49,259 --> 00:41:54,973
<i>We're finally able to see the worth of those we had previously written off.</i></i>

749
00:41:57,226 --> 00:41:59,186
<i>And before we know it...</i></i>

750
00:41:59,478 --> 00:42:01,813
<i>a bond has formed,</i></i>

751
00:42:02,814 --> 00:42:06,193
<i>regardless of whether others can understand it.</i></i>

752
00:42:07,402 --> 00:42:12,407
<i>Yes, unlikely friendships start up every day.</i></i>

753
00:42:12,407 --> 00:42:14,952
<i>No one understands this</i></i>

754
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:19,414
<i>more than the lonely.</i></i>

755
00:42:19,581 --> 00:42:21,792
<i>In fact,</i></i>

756
00:42:21,834 --> 00:43:04,251
<i>it's what they count on.</i></i>
