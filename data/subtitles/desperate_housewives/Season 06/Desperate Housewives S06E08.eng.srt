1
00:00:01,147 --> 00:00:02,950
Previously in Desperate Housewives...

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:04,749
No sex for at least a month.

3
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:07,316
- Bree made a decision.
- Focus on getting me a divorce.

4
00:00:07,724 --> 00:00:09,678
- And hired Angie.
- Let's get cooking.

5
00:00:10,029 --> 00:00:11,381
Gaby struggled at home.

6
00:00:11,673 --> 00:00:13,678
- What is going on?
- It's called home schooling.

7
00:00:13,925 --> 00:00:15,383
Lynette's body was changing.

8
00:00:15,383 --> 00:00:17,479
I got to hide these at work,

9
00:00:17,479 --> 00:00:19,183
so Carlos doesn't find out I'm pregnant.

10
00:00:19,441 --> 00:00:20,786
Cops wanted to know where you were

11
00:00:20,786 --> 00:00:22,338
the night that Julie
Mayer was strangled.

12
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:23,389
You know I never attacked her.

13
00:00:23,737 --> 00:00:25,693
Angie knew about the affair. Uhh!

14
00:00:27,082 --> 00:00:29,843
Is it true you shot Katherine Mayfair?

15
00:00:30,135 --> 00:00:31,843
And Susan got in trouble.

16
00:00:38,019 --> 00:00:41,819
If someone wanted proof
that Judge Mary Gallagher

17
00:00:41,819 --> 00:00:45,418
had a sense of humor,
all they needed to do was

18
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:48,031
watch her pronounce sentence.

19
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:53,035
For the slum lord who
refused to fix a furnace...

20
00:00:53,035 --> 00:00:57,690
You have to live in your own tenement
for a month... starting in December.

21
00:00:59,038 --> 00:01:01,492
The woman who threw
a phone at her maid...

22
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,592
You will clean Mrs. Garcia's
home for the next six weeks.

23
00:01:03,592 --> 00:01:07,348
And, yes, you will do windows.

24
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:10,303
For the high school coach

25
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:12,260
who made lewd remarks
to a cheerleader...

26
00:01:12,504 --> 00:01:15,306
at the next school assembly, you
will perform a cheer... in uniform.

27
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,409
And I'd shave those legs if I were you.

28
00:01:22,014 --> 00:01:24,615
And then there was

29
00:01:24,874 --> 00:01:26,375
the case of the housewife
who shot her neighbor...

30
00:01:28,228 --> 00:01:29,371
so she just popped up in my window,

31
00:01:29,623 --> 00:01:31,976
and I fired.

32
00:01:32,925 --> 00:01:34,181
- It was an accident.
- Liar!

33
00:01:34,932 --> 00:01:37,382
It was no accident! She wanted me dead.

34
00:01:37,684 --> 00:01:39,633
I did not. At least, not then.

35
00:01:40,342 --> 00:01:42,787
As you can see, your honor,
this is an unfortunate situation.

36
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:46,792
It's a mess is what it is. I
assume there's some history here.

37
00:01:47,147 --> 00:01:48,294
She once dated my husband.

38
00:01:48,547 --> 00:01:49,855
- She stole him from me.
- Stole?

39
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:53,675
He came screaming back like
he was running from a fire.

40
00:01:53,925 --> 00:01:54,576
Enough.

41
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,988
I take it you're the man in question.

42
00:02:02,092 --> 00:02:03,596
Yes, your honor.

43
00:02:03,955 --> 00:02:06,308
I could see shooting someone over you.

44
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:08,768
Thank you?

45
00:02:09,861 --> 00:02:12,214
Okay, I'm gonna rule now.

46
00:02:13,068 --> 00:02:16,871
My inclination is to avoid giving
out jail time. In this case.

47
00:02:18,521 --> 00:02:19,379
I object!

48
00:02:19,674 --> 00:02:21,976
- Overruled!
- However...

49
00:02:22,427 --> 00:02:24,430
A firearm was discharged,

50
00:02:24,921 --> 00:02:27,368
- and there are consequences for that.
- Your honor

51
00:02:27,922 --> 00:02:30,021
before you hand down your
ruling, may I say something?

52
00:02:30,326 --> 00:02:32,724
Make it quick. I already
find you uninteresting.

53
00:02:36,428 --> 00:02:37,739
Ha!

54
00:02:38,231 --> 00:02:43,349
Not only did Susan shoot
me at point-blank range,

55
00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:44,600
she trashed me to all of
my friends and neighbors,

56
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,005
telling them I was some
kind of crazy, stalking nut!

57
00:02:49,262 --> 00:02:52,509
That true? Have you been trashing her?

58
00:02:56,064 --> 00:02:57,372
I...

59
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:02,170
Never said "nut." I... said "loon."

60
00:03:07,972 --> 00:03:09,523
Mrs. Delfino...

61
00:03:11,729 --> 00:03:15,389
Okay, I trashed her a little.

62
00:03:15,951 --> 00:03:19,355
But what I said was true,
and that's free speech.

63
00:03:19,648 --> 00:03:21,303
You can't punish me for that.

64
00:03:24,057 --> 00:03:27,205
Yes, when it came to sentencing,

65
00:03:27,451 --> 00:03:30,152
Judge Mary Gallagher
had a sense of humor.

66
00:03:33,741 --> 00:03:35,446
But not everyone

67
00:03:36,094 --> 00:03:37,496
Found her funny.

68
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:53,683
There is a coffee shop in Fairview.

69
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:57,830
it's known as a place where you
can read your morning paper...

70
00:03:59,934 --> 00:04:01,539
Where you can meet your friends...

71
00:04:04,234 --> 00:04:06,486
where you can bump
into your neighbors...

72
00:04:07,886 --> 00:04:10,088
whether you want to or not.

73
00:04:16,137 --> 00:04:16,841
Hi.

74
00:04:23,851 --> 00:04:25,693
Boy, I hope they have decaf today.

75
00:04:26,096 --> 00:04:29,945
Last time I was here, they were out, so I had to have
regular and got so wired, I didn't sleep all night.

76
00:04:31,746 --> 00:04:33,051
Does that happen to you?

77
00:04:34,396 --> 00:04:37,852
Seriously? You think I'm
gonna make small talk with you?

78
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,654
Excuse me?

79
00:04:42,153 --> 00:04:43,849
I know you slept with my husband.

80
00:04:48,852 --> 00:04:51,001
Oh. So... I'm thinkin' we're
past the chit-chat stage.

81
00:04:57,309 --> 00:04:59,509
I am so sorry.

82
00:05:02,301 --> 00:05:04,204
Let me tell you how shame works.

83
00:05:04,952 --> 00:05:06,943
When you see the wife
of the guy you banged,

84
00:05:07,248 --> 00:05:08,558
you don't make conversation.

85
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:10,757
You don't even smile and say hi.

86
00:05:11,605 --> 00:05:14,013
You avert your gaze and you blush.

87
00:05:17,306 --> 00:05:18,812
Nod if you understand.

88
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,170
Here's your mocha
latte. That'll be $3.50.

89
00:05:25,872 --> 00:05:27,673
Oh. It's on her. She owes me.

90
00:05:35,485 --> 00:05:36,485
Hey.

91
00:05:38,336 --> 00:05:40,590
You're gonna be late for class.

92
00:05:40,884 --> 00:05:41,785
Dad?

93
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:44,937
All my clothes are too
tight. I had to borrow yours.

94
00:05:45,286 --> 00:05:47,292
I was gonna wear that shirt today.

95
00:05:47,542 --> 00:05:51,241
Well, when you're hiding your fourth month
of pregnancy with twins, you can have it back.

96
00:05:51,996 --> 00:05:52,990
What do you think?

97
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,243
I'm still attracted to
you in men's clothes.

98
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,453
Is that weird?

99
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,545
All I need is to pull
this off for two more days.

100
00:06:00,844 --> 00:06:03,142
You should've told
Carlos two months ago.

101
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,695
There's no way he won't be
furious when he finds out.

102
00:06:07,143 --> 00:06:10,053
Tom, I may be wearing men's clothes,

103
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,550
but I am not an idiot. I've got this.

104
00:06:12,797 --> 00:06:15,368
Terrence Henderson and
I are about to close

105
00:06:15,368 --> 00:06:17,666
the biggest deal in the
history of this company.

106
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:21,210
Once Carlos sees how great Terrence is,
he'll see the work can still get done

107
00:06:21,453 --> 00:06:23,455
even when I'm on maternity leave.

108
00:06:24,104 --> 00:06:25,808
And you're sure this
deal is gonna close?

109
00:06:26,461 --> 00:06:29,760
Nope. That's why we need
to keep our fingers crossed.

110
00:06:30,207 --> 00:06:32,463
Okay, now wish me luck.

111
00:06:33,064 --> 00:06:34,564
Good luck.

112
00:06:35,056 --> 00:06:37,457
Now come here, mister. I wanna kiss ya.

113
00:06:39,269 --> 00:06:40,718
Okay, now it's weird.

114
00:06:51,033 --> 00:06:52,991
Bless me, father, for I have sinned.

115
00:06:53,282 --> 00:06:54,437
Go ahead, my child.

116
00:06:54,936 --> 00:06:57,933
Well, I've been homeschooling my
daughter, and it's been a living hell,

117
00:06:58,234 --> 00:07:00,946
so I tried to bribe someone to
get her into Catholic school.

118
00:07:01,397 --> 00:07:02,997
Mm, and, uh, what happened?

119
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:04,955
Well, you tell me.

120
00:07:07,568 --> 00:07:09,274
Gabrielle, what are you doing?

121
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,327
Oh, come on, padre. You're
the head of admissions.

122
00:07:11,327 --> 00:07:12,669
And you've got a great school here,

123
00:07:12,922 --> 00:07:14,672
but there's a 2-year waiting list!

124
00:07:15,421 --> 00:07:16,519
Put your money away.

125
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:21,722
It's your money. Sleep with it
for a while. See how it feels.

126
00:07:22,028 --> 00:07:24,576
No! I wish I could help,
but my hands are tied.

127
00:07:25,222 --> 00:07:27,230
Oh, come on. I'm not asking
you to part the Red Sea.

128
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,224
Just find a spot for one
kid in the second grade.

129
00:07:29,672 --> 00:07:32,174
Look, if a student were to withdraw,

130
00:07:32,477 --> 00:07:34,678
I might be able to move you
to the top of the waiting list.

131
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:36,429
- Fantastic!
- But frankly,

132
00:07:36,429 --> 00:07:39,183
we tend to favor those
who are more faithful.

133
00:07:40,136 --> 00:07:41,240
What does that mean?

134
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:44,090
Well, I've noticed that you
don't come to mass very often.

135
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:48,592
oh! I hear ya, padre.

136
00:07:49,091 --> 00:07:51,046
You're okay with money
as long as it comes

137
00:07:51,046 --> 00:07:53,405
comes in one of those little
wicker baskets you pass around.

138
00:07:53,405 --> 00:07:55,104
- No, that's not what I'm saying.
- Of course not.

139
00:07:55,553 --> 00:07:58,009
I realize it's dark in here,
but just know I'm winking back.

140
00:08:05,179 --> 00:08:08,379
So your first opera...
that's quite a milestone.

141
00:08:08,732 --> 00:08:10,533
Throw in "last," and
it's two milestones.

142
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:14,435
Oh, stop. I saw you tear
up at the end of act two.

143
00:08:14,689 --> 00:08:16,733
Only because I realized
there was an act three.

144
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:21,737
"Madame Butterfly" is
Puccini's masterpiece.

145
00:08:21,993 --> 00:08:23,335
Didn't you enjoy it just a little?

146
00:08:25,186 --> 00:08:29,294
What about that scene when
Butterfly tells her child

147
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,541
not to feel sorrow for
her mother's desertion?

148
00:08:31,946 --> 00:08:33,289
Didn't that make you feel anything?

149
00:08:33,997 --> 00:08:37,860
Actually, that's when you leaned
forward, and I saw a little peek

150
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,668
of your boob. So I guess
it made me feel horny.

151
00:08:41,067 --> 00:08:42,219
Karl, don't.

152
00:08:42,461 --> 00:08:46,163
Come on. It's a dark parking structure.
People are just gonna think I'm mugging you.

153
00:08:46,369 --> 00:08:49,115
We agreed no sex for a month.

154
00:08:49,115 --> 00:08:51,423
We need to find out if we can be
together in a nonsexual manner.

155
00:08:52,516 --> 00:08:53,517
I'm serious.

156
00:08:53,768 --> 00:08:55,268
Can you keep your hands to yourself?

157
00:08:59,221 --> 00:09:01,825
Can I? Thanks to you,
it's my only choice.

158
00:09:13,028 --> 00:09:14,476
Hey, how was your business dinner?

159
00:09:17,017 --> 00:09:20,267
Oh. Um... Our bid was, uh, too high. It looks
like they're gonna go with another caterer.

160
00:09:21,817 --> 00:09:23,067
What are you listening to?

161
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:26,178
It's a new recording
of "Madame Butterfly."

162
00:09:49,836 --> 00:09:50,993
Isn't that glorious?

163
00:09:58,042 --> 00:10:00,539
It is. I should... go to bed, Orson.

164
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:03,942
Good night.

165
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,154
All right, guys. You sign the lease,

166
00:10:15,154 --> 00:10:16,457
and we'll pop the champagne.

167
00:10:16,457 --> 00:10:18,753
The Florida branch is officially a go.

168
00:10:19,205 --> 00:10:21,052
Terrific. So when we
get our branch manager?

169
00:10:21,503 --> 00:10:24,905
We have got somebody great lined up.
We just need to finalize some things.

170
00:10:25,505 --> 00:10:26,706
We'll get back to ya. Thanks.

171
00:10:27,457 --> 00:10:28,755
Who do we have lined up?

172
00:10:29,058 --> 00:10:30,660
Nobody. That's the thing
we need to finalize.

173
00:10:31,414 --> 00:10:32,057
Oh.

174
00:10:32,315 --> 00:10:34,959
But today, we celebrate.

175
00:10:35,165 --> 00:10:38,210
Lynette, you really hit this one out of the
park. I gotta give credit where credit is due.

176
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:39,809
Terrence did a lot of the
heavy lifting on this one,

177
00:10:40,011 --> 00:10:42,110
and I don't care if I embarrass
him. This guy is a star.

178
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,812
Strangely, I'm not embarrassed.

179
00:10:44,918 --> 00:10:46,967
Carlos, I didn't want to
interrupt your phone call,

180
00:10:46,967 --> 00:10:48,512
but your wife is here.

181
00:10:49,219 --> 00:10:51,213
Uh, just tell her to wait in
my office until we're finished.

182
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,770
You listen to me, Carlos Solis!

183
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:56,669
I just came from St. Ursula's,
and we've got big trouble!

184
00:10:59,318 --> 00:11:01,371
So according to the Catholic church,

185
00:11:01,723 --> 00:11:04,334
we're not holy enough. But I have a feeling
a big, fat check might slap on a halo.

186
00:11:05,472 --> 00:11:06,282
How big?

187
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:09,187
Well, something that'll make a priest say
"holy" and "mother" in the same sentence.

188
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,232
That should get her to the
top of the waiting list.

189
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:15,383
I'm not going to write a big check on
the chance that it might get her in.

190
00:11:15,835 --> 00:11:16,738
Carlos!

191
00:11:16,985 --> 00:11:18,740
Gaby, I can't do this now.

192
00:11:19,287 --> 00:11:21,288
You know the problems that I'm facing

193
00:11:21,288 --> 00:11:23,644
trying to get the new Florida office
up and running. Now if you don't mind...

194
00:11:25,401 --> 00:11:27,597
Fine. Can I trouble you for $5?

195
00:11:28,248 --> 00:11:30,149
I'll buy Juanita a hairnet

196
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,650
and prepare her for a future
in the fast food industry.

197
00:11:37,601 --> 00:11:38,454
Hey!

198
00:11:39,006 --> 00:11:41,007
Hello... gentlemen.

199
00:11:42,052 --> 00:11:43,964
What? A lot of people
are wearing this style.

200
00:11:44,608 --> 00:11:45,912
Well, doesn't make it right.

201
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:49,406
Hey, uh, Gaby, I heard
you mention St. Ursula's.

202
00:11:49,707 --> 00:11:53,113
It is worth the hassle. Our daughter Molly's
in the second grade. She loves it there.

203
00:11:55,065 --> 00:11:58,216
Oh, I didn't know Molly was
in the same grade as juanita.

204
00:11:58,667 --> 00:11:59,465
Yeah.

205
00:11:59,465 --> 00:12:00,766
Would you excuse me for a second?

206
00:12:06,466 --> 00:12:09,671
Hey, that branch in Florida?
I think I found our man.

207
00:12:11,716 --> 00:12:13,922
No, no, no, you can't
send Terrence to Florida.

208
00:12:14,268 --> 00:12:16,121
You should take it as a
compliment. You trained him well.

209
00:12:16,419 --> 00:12:19,215
Exactly. You can't send him
away. What if you need him here?

210
00:12:20,021 --> 00:12:21,473
Why would I? I've got you.

211
00:12:21,968 --> 00:12:22,917
But...

212
00:12:23,818 --> 00:12:26,618
What if I was hit by a
bus and I was... Put on

213
00:12:26,824 --> 00:12:29,622
bed rest for, say, three months?

214
00:12:30,173 --> 00:12:31,727
Who--who would
cover for me?

215
00:12:33,471 --> 00:12:34,375
Who--who would
cover for me?

216
00:12:34,979 --> 00:12:35,822
Hey!

217
00:12:36,974 --> 00:12:39,173
You jinxed it. Now for sure some
version of that is gonna happen.

218
00:12:40,472 --> 00:12:43,074
Lynette, it's done. We are
sending Terrence to Florida.

219
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:46,536
Oh, and I really like this new look that
you've got going, but careful, Roberta

220
00:12:46,536 --> 00:12:49,076
in accounting asked if I thought
you'd like to go bowling with her.

221
00:13:00,385 --> 00:13:01,332
Hi, susan!

222
00:13:02,684 --> 00:13:03,332
Oh, God. Ugh.

223
00:13:04,932 --> 00:13:05,981
What are you doing here?

224
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:10,232
I was just having lunch with some
friends who are not on a chain gang.

225
00:13:10,484 --> 00:13:11,934
thought I'd stop by and say hi.

226
00:13:12,636 --> 00:13:14,788
You mean stop by and gloat.

227
00:13:15,488 --> 00:13:16,237
Maybe a little.

228
00:13:17,436 --> 00:13:20,990
So... how's it going? meeting anybody?

229
00:13:21,887 --> 00:13:25,237
They say the friends you make on
the inside... you'll have for life.

230
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,239
Yes, Katherine, this all sucks.

231
00:13:29,093 --> 00:13:30,140
But you know what?

232
00:13:30,441 --> 00:13:32,792
At the end of the day,
I go home to Mike...

233
00:13:33,602 --> 00:13:35,410
which means, I won.

234
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:40,179
That's big talk for a woman standing in an
orange jumpsuit with blisters on her feet.

235
00:13:40,676 --> 00:13:42,127
Well, Mike will rub them

236
00:13:42,127 --> 00:13:45,179
when I go home. And for the
record, I totally make this work.

237
00:13:45,882 --> 00:13:48,380
The fact that you think
you look good in orange

238
00:13:48,633 --> 00:13:50,481
shows I'm not dealing
with a rational person.

239
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:54,684
Oh, by the way... you missed something.

240
00:13:56,139 --> 00:13:56,988
No I didn't.

241
00:13:57,231 --> 00:13:58,681
Yeah, you did.

242
00:14:00,082 --> 00:14:01,132
Bye-bye.

243
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,935
Hey! Come back here!

244
00:14:06,739 --> 00:14:08,636
She littered! Shoot her!

245
00:14:08,937 --> 00:14:10,037
What a moron.

246
00:14:10,037 --> 00:14:12,644
I wish I'd caught her license
plate number. She'd be sorry.

247
00:14:13,944 --> 00:14:14,789
Really?

248
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:17,591
What kind of damage could
you do with her home address?

249
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,658
You missed something.

250
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,957
Did you get 'em all?

251
00:14:42,957 --> 00:14:45,107
You're supposed to eat it, not wear it.

252
00:14:45,357 --> 00:14:46,859
Well, they call it crumb
cake for a reason. Come on.

253
00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:49,860
Emily, can you steam me some 2% milk?

254
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:55,916
Hey.

255
00:14:57,364 --> 00:14:59,467
This is what happens when
I'm five minutes late?

256
00:15:00,414 --> 00:15:01,265
What?

257
00:15:01,566 --> 00:15:03,071
The waitress with the hands.

258
00:15:03,771 --> 00:15:05,919
She was brushing crumbs off my shirt.

259
00:15:06,388 --> 00:15:07,686
What, the ones julie missed?

260
00:15:08,086 --> 00:15:08,987
Oh, God.

261
00:15:10,939 --> 00:15:13,437
Is this how it's gonna be
every time I talk to a woman?

262
00:15:13,935 --> 00:15:15,188
Is this how it's gonna be
every time I talk to a woman?

263
00:15:15,587 --> 00:15:19,707
Ange, I'm sorry. I... I don't
know how many times I can say it.

264
00:15:20,311 --> 00:15:21,611
I'll do anything you want.

265
00:15:21,863 --> 00:15:23,214
I'll do couples therapy.

266
00:15:26,464 --> 00:15:29,417
Great idea. Let's tell
somebody all our secrets,

267
00:15:29,623 --> 00:15:31,367
and then when we're
cured, we can kill him.

268
00:15:31,771 --> 00:15:33,218
Look, I don't know what you want.

269
00:15:38,073 --> 00:15:39,724
I want you to be the guy you used to be,

270
00:15:41,255 --> 00:15:43,406
the guy who saved my life,
not the guy who destroyed it.

271
00:15:45,961 --> 00:15:47,207
How we doing here?

272
00:15:50,212 --> 00:15:51,666
Never been better,

273
00:15:54,616 --> 00:15:55,873
- hey!
- Hi!

274
00:15:56,114 --> 00:15:57,015
Come on in! Yeah!

275
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:00,312
- This is so nice of you. Yeah.
- Oh, no. It's not every day

276
00:16:00,515 --> 00:16:03,515
that one of my associates
gets a big promotion.

277
00:16:03,821 --> 00:16:04,871
- Thank you.
- Tom,

278
00:16:04,871 --> 00:16:06,768
why don't you take Crystal
in the den and get comfortable

279
00:16:06,768 --> 00:16:09,330
while I steal this guy
to help me make cocktails?

280
00:16:10,525 --> 00:16:11,428
Come on. Right this way.

281
00:16:16,928 --> 00:16:18,832
So how excited are you? Miami!

282
00:16:19,488 --> 00:16:22,033
Pretty jazzed. It's an
exciting opportunity.

283
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:25,558
I think it's great how you're
concentrating on the upside of this.

284
00:16:26,115 --> 00:16:27,115
There's a downside?

285
00:16:27,718 --> 00:16:30,661
No, not really. Forget I mentioned it.

286
00:16:33,364 --> 00:16:37,124
It's just... do you remember Tim Baker

287
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:39,829
who was sent to head
up our chicago office?

288
00:16:40,525 --> 00:16:42,076
Never heard of him.

289
00:16:42,577 --> 00:16:43,876
Exactly.

290
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:48,030
So... you are moving to Florida. Wow!

291
00:16:48,384 --> 00:16:49,126
Pecan?

292
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:51,036
Oh, no, thanks. I'm on a diet.

293
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:52,981
Aw, yeah, I can't wait.

294
00:16:52,981 --> 00:16:54,327
No more winter.

295
00:16:54,579 --> 00:16:56,332
Yep, just heat and hurricanes.

296
00:16:56,781 --> 00:17:00,330
Oh, I'm willing to put up with that.
Miami has so many other things to offer.

297
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:03,184
Oh, it certainly must to attract
all those Colombian drug lords.

298
00:17:04,683 --> 00:17:07,431
The Chicago branch was a
little slow out of the gate.

299
00:17:07,633 --> 00:17:09,584
corporate freaked and
made Tim the scapegoat.

300
00:17:09,842 --> 00:17:11,043
Where is he now?

301
00:17:11,483 --> 00:17:14,837
He's in plastics... or
paper, depending on what

302
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:16,885
you want your groceries in. Wine?

303
00:17:17,106 --> 00:17:20,448
And when they cut into the alligator's
stomach, not only was the guy's arm

304
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,349
still intact, but it was still holding

305
00:17:22,553 --> 00:17:24,450
his golf club.

306
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:28,403
I think he would've been fine
if his wife hadn't left him.

307
00:17:28,403 --> 00:17:29,754
That led directly to the alcoholism,

308
00:17:30,011 --> 00:17:32,952
which probably had something to do
with him threatening the president.

309
00:17:33,154 --> 00:17:34,923
Boy, is that a bitch on the old résumé.

310
00:17:38,315 --> 00:17:40,319
That humidity... your hair?

311
00:17:40,865 --> 00:17:42,666
I think it's a recipe for cotton candy.

312
00:17:44,127 --> 00:17:46,571
Here we go, everybody.
We've got the wine.

313
00:17:47,369 --> 00:17:49,926
I would like to propose a toast.

314
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,373
To Terrence and Crystal,

315
00:17:52,373 --> 00:17:54,625
May Miami be everything
you think it will.

316
00:17:55,477 --> 00:17:56,825
Hear, hear.

317
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:03,944
Knock knock. Anybody home?

318
00:18:04,348 --> 00:18:05,643
Come on in, Angie.

319
00:18:08,844 --> 00:18:13,654
This is pretty. What is it? It's
from the opera "Madame Butterfly."

320
00:18:15,365 --> 00:18:16,767
She sounds so sad.

321
00:18:17,122 --> 00:18:19,825
Well, actually, in this
aria, butterfly is hopeful

322
00:18:19,825 --> 00:18:22,220
that one day her lover
will return to her.

323
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,223
Oh. Does he?

324
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,577
No.

325
00:18:26,476 --> 00:18:27,927
Because of his abandonment,

326
00:18:29,419 --> 00:18:30,419
she kills herself.

327
00:18:32,371 --> 00:18:34,526
Oh. You ever see "Avenue q"?
The musical with the puppets?

328
00:18:35,424 --> 00:18:36,771
Now that's good theater.

329
00:18:40,525 --> 00:18:42,623
Bree's not here. What do you want?

330
00:18:43,724 --> 00:18:46,431
Well, I need to talk to her about
some work stuff. Where is she?

331
00:18:46,431 --> 00:18:47,729
She's out.

332
00:18:50,084 --> 00:18:52,877
That's generally where
Bree is these days.

333
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:54,736
Out.

334
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,186
She's meeting with a
prospective client, so she says.

335
00:18:58,681 --> 00:18:59,683
She's had

336
00:18:59,986 --> 00:19:02,234
four client meetings this week,

337
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:04,871
and not one has resulted in a booking.

338
00:19:06,773 --> 00:19:07,969
Why do you think that is?

339
00:19:10,324 --> 00:19:11,627
It's a rough economy.

340
00:19:13,664 --> 00:19:15,256
See, I think she's taken a lover.

341
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:21,512
What? Oh, come on. No way.

342
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:23,261
How can you be so sure?

343
00:19:23,512 --> 00:19:24,568
An affair?

344
00:19:25,015 --> 00:19:27,319
Oh, please, the woman
makes her own croutons.

345
00:19:29,362 --> 00:19:30,262
Perhaps.

346
00:19:32,467 --> 00:19:35,068
Angie, I have to go
away on a golf weekend.

347
00:19:36,219 --> 00:19:38,374
While I'm gone, could you do me a favor

348
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,520
and keep an eye on Bree?

349
00:19:41,287 --> 00:19:42,873
- What do you mean?
- Just observe her.

350
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,781
Does she come home at
night? Is anyone with her?

351
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:51,083
Look, if you wanna be paranoid,
go ahead. It's a free country.

352
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,933
But I am not gonna spy
on your wife for you.

353
00:19:55,545 --> 00:19:56,043
Yes.

354
00:19:56,297 --> 00:19:57,694
I suppose that's for the best.

355
00:19:58,696 --> 00:20:03,257
I mean, if I did find out she was betraying
me, I'd probably do something stupid.

356
00:20:27,008 --> 00:20:29,610
Oh, toughen up. It's just a little dust.

357
00:20:35,716 --> 00:20:37,269
Look, I have to clean that area.

358
00:20:37,518 --> 00:20:39,925
would you mind having your
breakdown someplace else?

359
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:41,618
Just leave me alone, okay?

360
00:20:42,265 --> 00:20:44,321
You won, I lost. Isn't that enough?

361
00:20:45,021 --> 00:20:46,222
What?

362
00:20:46,667 --> 00:20:50,467
When you're sitting on the side
of the road picking up styrofoam

363
00:20:50,467 --> 00:20:53,123
and wads of gum, it's
time to admit defeat.

364
00:20:53,774 --> 00:20:57,773
The man I love chose you.

365
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:00,624
Are you messing with me?

366
00:21:01,073 --> 00:21:03,076
No. I'm being honest.

367
00:21:06,028 --> 00:21:07,278
Why has this been so hard on me?

368
00:21:12,184 --> 00:21:13,185
Well...

369
00:21:15,632 --> 00:21:16,883
you loved him.

370
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,083
I did.

371
00:21:19,482 --> 00:21:21,840
I really did. And now he's gone.

372
00:21:22,486 --> 00:21:24,983
Katherine, you're an
attractive, intelligent woman.

373
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,188
You're gonna meet other guys.

374
00:21:27,838 --> 00:21:29,336
Not like Mike.

375
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:32,190
We connected on so
many different levels...

376
00:21:33,637 --> 00:21:36,247
intellectually, emotionally,

377
00:21:37,437 --> 00:21:38,790
sexually.

378
00:21:39,795 --> 00:21:41,840
Oh, I've never felt such passion.

379
00:21:43,693 --> 00:21:45,191
Where am I gonna find another guy

380
00:21:45,191 --> 00:21:48,848
who'll make love to me
five times in one day?

381
00:21:53,897 --> 00:21:55,947
- That's a lie.
- No, it's not.

382
00:21:56,651 --> 00:21:58,149
Five times?

383
00:21:58,549 --> 00:22:02,646
Susan, come on. Don't tell me
that you and Mike have never...

384
00:22:13,952 --> 00:22:15,857
Oh. Maybe I didn't lose after all.

385
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:31,922
Remind me to ask you what you
want for breakfast more often.

386
00:22:32,169 --> 00:22:33,272
Beats a bowl of oatmeal, doesn't it?

387
00:22:33,673 --> 00:22:34,819
You kidding? That beat a waffle.

388
00:22:35,071 --> 00:22:36,877
Listen, I have a crazy idea.

389
00:22:37,621 --> 00:22:40,024
Why don't we both call
in sick and spend the day

390
00:22:40,271 --> 00:22:42,029
in bed naked together?

391
00:22:42,522 --> 00:22:44,024
Did I mention naked?

392
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,825
You wanna go for seconds?

393
00:22:46,225 --> 00:22:47,383
Oh, what's gotten into you?

394
00:22:47,823 --> 00:22:49,776
Even on my birthday
you told me to hurry up

395
00:22:50,026 --> 00:22:52,025
because "The Bachelor" was on.

396
00:22:52,925 --> 00:22:55,081
Well... can't a wife just want
to spend time with her husband?

397
00:22:55,379 --> 00:22:58,038
Well, yeah. It's just
that your timing's bad.

398
00:22:59,537 --> 00:23:01,093
Gotta finish Mr. Hinkle's shower.

399
00:23:01,345 --> 00:23:02,488
I promised him I'd be there yesterday.

400
00:23:03,352 --> 00:23:04,154
I'm serious.

401
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,166
The old man hasn't had
a shower in three days.

402
00:23:07,907 --> 00:23:10,408
And that's a long
time... for an old man...

403
00:23:12,709 --> 00:23:13,909
to not take a shower.

404
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,461
Oh, the hell with it.
he survived World War II.

405
00:23:19,461 --> 00:23:20,764
He'll get through this. Oh!

406
00:23:25,614 --> 00:23:26,974
Father Crowley, hi.

407
00:23:27,869 --> 00:23:31,264
This is for you. I thought
I'd catch up on my giving

408
00:23:31,522 --> 00:23:33,221
to my favorite parish.

409
00:23:34,316 --> 00:23:35,816
Wow. I certainly didn't expect this.

410
00:23:36,816 --> 00:23:39,270
Well, do with it what you will...

411
00:23:39,674 --> 00:23:42,019
buy a new pipe organ, help the needy,

412
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:45,722
take a trip to Tahiti. I
really don't care. Oh, listen.

413
00:23:46,027 --> 00:23:48,488
I don't know which nun you're gonna put my kid
with, but make sure she's had a tetanus shot.

414
00:23:48,835 --> 00:23:50,331
Juanita's a biter.

415
00:23:50,886 --> 00:23:53,235
Uh, Gabrielle, I think
you're jumping the gun here.

416
00:23:53,536 --> 00:23:54,932
Why? A spot opened up.

417
00:23:55,335 --> 00:23:57,337
Molly Henderson is
moving to Florida, right?

418
00:23:57,586 --> 00:24:00,187
Well, she was. Her father
was going to take a new job,

419
00:24:00,187 --> 00:24:01,634
but he decided against it.

420
00:24:01,991 --> 00:24:05,336
What? No! No, this can't be!

421
00:24:05,785 --> 00:24:07,389
I'm afraid it is. Anyway,

422
00:24:07,889 --> 00:24:09,493
h... how did you even know about this?

423
00:24:12,038 --> 00:24:13,987
We'll talk about it in confession.

424
00:24:14,196 --> 00:24:16,344
Have faith, Gabrielle.
When God closes a door,

425
00:24:16,595 --> 00:24:17,597
when God closes a door,

426
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,640
thank you, Father Crowley.

427
00:24:34,157 --> 00:24:35,350
hey.

428
00:24:35,753 --> 00:24:38,213
I got the stuff for the mushroom tarts.

429
00:24:38,554 --> 00:24:39,653
how's that cake coming along?

430
00:24:39,952 --> 00:24:42,155
Just when I think I can't
top myself, I do. Hmm.

431
00:24:43,955 --> 00:24:46,706
Hmm. How about that? Oh, by the way,

432
00:24:47,162 --> 00:24:48,456
Orson thinks you're having an affair.

433
00:24:52,406 --> 00:24:53,667
He thinks what now?

434
00:24:54,166 --> 00:24:56,710
He thinks you're steppin' out.
But I told him there is no way.

435
00:24:56,957 --> 00:24:59,913
Bree Van De Kamp is whoring
it up in some sleazy motel.

436
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,863
Uh, thank you for that.

437
00:25:05,461 --> 00:25:08,062
Sorry to spring it on you like that.

438
00:25:08,666 --> 00:25:12,764
Well, I appreciate it. I just don't
understand why he would go to you.

439
00:25:13,813 --> 00:25:15,666
Well, he was drinking a lot.

440
00:25:16,065 --> 00:25:19,029
Also, he asked me if I would spy on you.

441
00:25:22,467 --> 00:25:24,968
Relax, Bree. Obviously I said no.

442
00:25:26,215 --> 00:25:27,619
Obviously I said no.

443
00:25:28,761 --> 00:25:30,713
Would you mind, um,
cleaning this up for me?

444
00:25:31,969 --> 00:25:33,515
Are you sure you're
done topping yourself?

445
00:25:38,769 --> 00:25:41,769
This is serious, Karl. He
asked Angie to spy on me.

446
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:44,220
And God knows who else
he has watching me.

447
00:25:45,973 --> 00:25:48,569
I don't think we should see each other
again until after you've gotten me a divorce.

448
00:25:50,275 --> 00:25:52,919
Don't ask me how. You're the lawyer.

449
00:26:01,874 --> 00:26:03,373
Hey. Aren't you
supposed to be at school?

450
00:26:03,576 --> 00:26:04,479
You never come home for lunch.

451
00:26:04,775 --> 00:26:06,428
I thought I'd try something different.

452
00:26:07,081 --> 00:26:10,277
Mmm. Hey, since we're both home, why
don't we go upstairs and make love?

453
00:26:10,625 --> 00:26:12,526
What, seriously? You
want to do it again?

454
00:26:13,188 --> 00:26:14,627
W... I just got a sub from Martinelli's.

455
00:26:14,928 --> 00:26:16,828
Mike, I am offering you a nooner.

456
00:26:17,229 --> 00:26:18,783
Drop your pants and get upstairs.

457
00:26:19,933 --> 00:26:21,333
Can I bring my sandwich?

458
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:23,182
Yes. Bring it. Grab a
pickle. I don't care.

459
00:26:23,888 --> 00:26:24,882
You're the best wife ever.

460
00:26:24,882 --> 00:26:26,785
- Come on!
- Can I turn on "the three stooges," too?

461
00:26:31,995 --> 00:26:33,395
Lynette, it's Gaby!

462
00:26:36,525 --> 00:26:37,570
In a minute.

463
00:26:46,176 --> 00:26:48,778
- Hey, Gaby.
- Hey, nanook. Why you wearing a parka?

464
00:26:49,373 --> 00:26:52,175
Because... fur is murder. What's up?

465
00:26:54,126 --> 00:26:56,528
I... I talked to Crystal Henderson,
and she said you talked Terrence

466
00:26:56,528 --> 00:26:58,176
out of going to Miami. Is that true?

467
00:26:58,377 --> 00:27:01,576
I didn't talk him out of it. I
merely pointed out the pros and cons.

468
00:27:01,882 --> 00:27:03,282
Well, apparently, the cons won.

469
00:27:03,827 --> 00:27:07,279
You've gotta untalk him out of
it. I need him out of this state.

470
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:10,387
Why? Are you sleeping with him?

471
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,586
No! Truth is, if he doesn't go,

472
00:27:13,586 --> 00:27:16,233
Juanita can't take his
kid's spot at St. Ursula's.

473
00:27:16,588 --> 00:27:17,581
You are unbelievable.

474
00:27:17,581 --> 00:27:19,284
You want this guy to
uproot his entire life

475
00:27:19,284 --> 00:27:20,987
just so you can get out of
homeschooling your daughter?

476
00:27:21,336 --> 00:27:23,040
Yeah, yeah, selfish Gaby. Same old song.

477
00:27:23,387 --> 00:27:25,034
- Join in if you know the words.
- Well, sorry, Gaby,

478
00:27:25,342 --> 00:27:26,587
I need Terrence here.

479
00:27:26,986 --> 00:27:29,689
Why? Are you sleeping with him?

480
00:27:30,841 --> 00:27:33,347
No! I just need him here.

481
00:27:33,892 --> 00:27:35,842
Every time I turn
around, someone is trying

482
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:37,340
to make my life more complicated.

483
00:27:38,044 --> 00:27:39,441
why can't everyone just let it go?

484
00:27:40,041 --> 00:27:41,643
hey, I'm sorry.

485
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,795
Come here. Everything's gonna be okay.

486
00:27:46,842 --> 00:27:48,443
Why are you getting so upset?

487
00:27:49,049 --> 00:27:52,797
- What was that?
- What was that?

488
00:27:55,597 --> 00:27:56,595
Your stomach just kicked me.

489
00:27:58,453 --> 00:27:59,496
Open the parka.

490
00:27:59,745 --> 00:28:00,795
- I'd rather not.
- Open it!

491
00:28:05,499 --> 00:28:08,352
You're pregnant? Why
didn't you tell me?!

492
00:28:08,956 --> 00:28:11,904
Because... I knew you'd tell Carlos.

493
00:28:12,651 --> 00:28:14,856
Yeah, so I tell Carlos.
What's wrong with...

494
00:28:16,511 --> 00:28:17,353
Oh, no.

495
00:28:19,258 --> 00:28:20,909
When Carlos offered you that promotion,

496
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:23,315
you knew you were pregnant and you
knew you'd be leaving him in the lurch?

497
00:28:23,315 --> 00:28:26,458
- Gaby...
- Carlos just got this company!

498
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:29,715
He brought in people he could depend on,
and he thought he could depend on you!

499
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:32,424
I didn't tell Carlos
because I knew I was

500
00:28:32,424 --> 00:28:34,719
the best person for the job
and I wanted to prove it.

501
00:28:35,575 --> 00:28:38,371
- Well, you certainly proved something.
- Gaby, wait!

502
00:28:38,621 --> 00:28:40,927
Please don't tell Carlos. I
think he should hear it from me.

503
00:28:42,682 --> 00:28:44,982
Yeah. Better late than never, right?

504
00:28:55,387 --> 00:28:58,332
Susan, I'm home! Are you hungry?

505
00:28:58,681 --> 00:29:00,443
Up here!

506
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:06,935
Hello, lover.

507
00:29:07,692 --> 00:29:08,683
Oh, God.

508
00:29:09,235 --> 00:29:10,936
Susan, I can't.

509
00:29:12,036 --> 00:29:14,489
I... I... I got nothing left. I
hit my hand with a wrench today,

510
00:29:14,489 --> 00:29:16,386
and when I cried, only dust came out.

511
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:17,988
You cried?

512
00:29:18,537 --> 00:29:20,788
That is so sexy.

513
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:24,943
Mm. What is going on with you? It's
like you just got out of prison.

514
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:27,589
Is there a problem with a
husband and wife having sex?

515
00:29:28,443 --> 00:29:30,346
We have a passionate
relationship, don't we?

516
00:29:30,792 --> 00:29:32,150
Well, of course we do.

517
00:29:32,543 --> 00:29:35,994
It's just, I was hoping t...
tonight we could... cuddle.

518
00:29:38,146 --> 00:29:39,046
Cuddle?

519
00:29:40,094 --> 00:29:42,748
- Am I that repulsive to you?
- What?

520
00:29:43,603 --> 00:29:45,199
It's okay, Mike. You can say it.

521
00:29:46,645 --> 00:29:48,157
I'm a lousy lay.

522
00:29:48,449 --> 00:29:50,351
Susan, we had sex three times today.

523
00:29:50,749 --> 00:29:51,998
All right, I can't do it again.

524
00:29:52,503 --> 00:29:54,653
All right, I can't do it again.

525
00:29:55,651 --> 00:29:58,758
Really? Biology? Well, here is

526
00:29:59,001 --> 00:30:00,251
some basic math.

527
00:30:01,858 --> 00:30:05,355
You had sex with Katherine
five times in one day

528
00:30:05,355 --> 00:30:07,911
and me three. Five minus three equals

529
00:30:08,162 --> 00:30:11,407
Katherine turns you on,
and sex with me is a chore.

530
00:30:13,307 --> 00:30:15,565
You and Katherine
actually talked about this?

531
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:17,812
More like she rubbed it in my face.

532
00:30:18,563 --> 00:30:22,609
Okay. Look, the only reason
that that "record" ever happened

533
00:30:22,812 --> 00:30:24,811
was we got snowed in during a ski trip.

534
00:30:26,516 --> 00:30:28,512
And we had absolutely
nothing to talk about.

535
00:30:30,563 --> 00:30:32,218
Sex was all we ever had!

536
00:30:39,928 --> 00:30:40,983
Don't you get it?

537
00:30:41,477 --> 00:30:43,337
There was nothing else
to the relationship.

538
00:30:44,071 --> 00:30:46,371
But you and I... we've got everything.

539
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,683
We have a rich,

540
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:50,933
full life together.

541
00:30:51,189 --> 00:30:52,934
We could finish each other's sentences.

542
00:30:55,483 --> 00:30:57,638
Oh, Mike, I...

543
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,288
"I've been so foolish."

544
00:31:00,487 --> 00:31:01,636
Is that what you were gonna say?

545
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:07,037
- And?
- You wanna cuddle.

546
00:31:08,342 --> 00:31:10,938
I was gonna say "The Bachelor" is on.

547
00:31:11,389 --> 00:31:12,895
But cuddling's good, too.

548
00:31:19,007 --> 00:31:20,903
Karl, what are you doing
here? Someone could see you!

549
00:31:21,361 --> 00:31:23,503
Yeah, especially if you leave
me standing on your doorstep.

550
00:31:30,113 --> 00:31:32,512
Relax. I parked two blocks away.

551
00:31:32,758 --> 00:31:35,357
I don't appreciate your taking risks
like this. If Orson find out about...

552
00:31:35,808 --> 00:31:38,416
You won't have that to
worry about much longer.

553
00:31:38,909 --> 00:31:41,010
I found a way to spring
you from this marriage!

554
00:31:50,694 --> 00:31:52,441
Orson's still on parole, right?

555
00:31:52,735 --> 00:31:54,140
For another year. Why?

556
00:31:54,985 --> 00:31:57,586
If he violates parole by, for instance,

557
00:31:58,035 --> 00:31:59,993
associating with a known felon,

558
00:32:00,437 --> 00:32:01,444
they can revoke it.

559
00:32:01,745 --> 00:32:03,988
- And send him back to jail.
- All we need to do

560
00:32:04,291 --> 00:32:07,047
is get some ex-con in a room with
Orson, take some pictures, and bam!

561
00:32:07,339 --> 00:32:09,493
He can't touch you

562
00:32:09,741 --> 00:32:12,589
because if he does, the parole
officer will get the pictures,

563
00:32:13,045 --> 00:32:14,643
and it's bye-bye, Orson.

564
00:32:15,195 --> 00:32:16,995
Karl, that's perfect! And
then he'll have to let me go.

565
00:32:19,242 --> 00:32:20,647
Ahh. I think someone deserves a kiss.

566
00:32:23,703 --> 00:32:25,295
- Karl, we agreed.
- Bree,

567
00:32:25,848 --> 00:32:27,445
for the first time since
we've been together,

568
00:32:27,703 --> 00:32:29,397
your husband is out of town.

569
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:31,097
Do we really want to
let that go to waste?

570
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:24,559
Come on. Come on!

571
00:33:27,761 --> 00:33:29,059
Do not answer that.

572
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,661
- This is Bree. Please leave a message.
- Oh, damn it!

573
00:33:43,719 --> 00:33:45,919
- Hello?
- Bree, you gotta get that man out of your bedroom right now!

574
00:33:46,215 --> 00:33:48,322
What? There's no man in my room.

575
00:33:49,272 --> 00:33:50,926
Oh, good, 'cause it was just about to get
a whole lot more crowded. Orson is home.

576
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:08,795
Orson.

577
00:34:11,689 --> 00:34:13,048
You're home early.

578
00:34:14,043 --> 00:34:15,048
Is something wrong?

579
00:34:23,801 --> 00:34:25,347
Why are you back so soon?

580
00:34:26,154 --> 00:34:27,297
I'm coming down with a cold.

581
00:34:28,496 --> 00:34:31,398
You know how I hate to
be sick away from home.

582
00:34:35,001 --> 00:34:36,256
What are you doing?

583
00:34:39,303 --> 00:34:42,164
There are two glasses
downstairs and one has wine.

584
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:45,065
You are obviously not alone here.

585
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,572
What are you implying?

586
00:34:46,871 --> 00:34:49,065
You know perfectly well
what I'm implying, Bree.

587
00:34:49,415 --> 00:34:50,866
Who was drinking the wine?

588
00:34:51,166 --> 00:34:54,613
Well, first of all, I am insulted
that you would even think that...

589
00:34:54,613 --> 00:34:56,168
Bree, where are you?

590
00:34:57,974 --> 00:34:59,873
Oh, there you are! Orson.

591
00:35:01,953 --> 00:35:03,409
Wow, I pop home for five minutes

592
00:35:03,409 --> 00:35:04,861
to toss some clothes in the dryer,

593
00:35:04,861 --> 00:35:06,856
and you got a man in your bedroom.

594
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:11,568
- You were here tonight?
- Oh, yeah. Just tossin' back

595
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:13,164
a little vino and gossiping.

596
00:35:13,465 --> 00:35:16,078
Yes, this girl knows
everything about everybody.

597
00:35:21,113 --> 00:35:22,657
Is there any wine left?

598
00:35:23,307 --> 00:35:25,308
- I could use a glass.
- Yes, downstairs

599
00:35:25,859 --> 00:35:27,066
on the table. You go on ahead.

600
00:35:27,464 --> 00:35:29,028
We're gonna finish up our girl talk.

601
00:35:37,012 --> 00:35:37,819
Where are the clothes?

602
00:35:38,063 --> 00:35:39,121
Behind the pillow.

603
00:35:43,967 --> 00:35:46,121
Hey. You're gonna have to jump.

604
00:35:46,715 --> 00:35:49,366
There's rose bushes, so
put your pants on first.

605
00:35:53,072 --> 00:35:54,873
Angie, I can't thank you enough.

606
00:35:55,168 --> 00:35:57,476
I didn't do this for
you. I did it for Orson.

607
00:35:58,228 --> 00:35:59,224
For Orson?

608
00:35:59,476 --> 00:36:02,521
I told him you had too much
class to do something like this.

609
00:36:03,076 --> 00:36:06,326
I understand your disdain, but
this is a complicated situation.

610
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:09,525
Let me make it simple for you...
two men want you. Choose one.

611
00:36:09,982 --> 00:36:13,128
But which one? Orson's
blackmailing me to stay with him.

612
00:36:13,428 --> 00:36:15,376
He's manipulative and calculating and...

613
00:36:15,775 --> 00:36:18,229
- Then go with lover boy.
- But what kind of life would I have with Karl?

614
00:36:18,532 --> 00:36:19,835
He's crass and conceited

615
00:36:19,835 --> 00:36:22,628
and the only thing we seem
to have in common is sex.

616
00:36:22,628 --> 00:36:24,080
Then why are you having an affair

617
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:26,982
- with someone you don't even like?
- Did I mention the sex?

618
00:36:27,733 --> 00:36:30,829
Karl brings out passion
in me I never knew I had.

619
00:36:31,085 --> 00:36:33,031
I melt every time he touches me.

620
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,984
Great! Then find a way
out of your marriage

621
00:36:35,281 --> 00:36:37,585
and... and start building
a life with this... Karl.

622
00:36:37,936 --> 00:36:39,889
I would. It's just...

623
00:36:40,136 --> 00:36:41,488
What?

624
00:36:47,489 --> 00:36:49,044
Orson likes opera.

625
00:37:02,101 --> 00:37:04,101
- Hey, you busy?
- No.

626
00:37:06,351 --> 00:37:08,559
So, did, uh, Gaby
talk to you last night?

627
00:37:08,906 --> 00:37:11,807
No. But I need to talk to you.

628
00:37:13,218 --> 00:37:14,228
I want you to run

629
00:37:14,228 --> 00:37:16,172
- the Miami office.
- What?

630
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,820
If it isn't gonna be Terrence,
then it has to be you.

631
00:37:19,525 --> 00:37:22,322
The future of the company is at stake.

632
00:37:22,672 --> 00:37:24,025
I need my best people on the
spot. It won't be forever,

633
00:37:24,025 --> 00:37:26,632
and depending on how things
go after a couple of years,

634
00:37:26,632 --> 00:37:28,675
maybe you could even move
back and telecommute from here.

635
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:31,930
- Carlos, what is this?
- What's what?

636
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:35,676
Oh, come on, I know
you know I'm pregnant.

637
00:37:35,926 --> 00:37:38,231
You're pregnant? Wow. Great.

638
00:37:38,578 --> 00:37:40,628
Carlos, please, I know Gaby told you.

639
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:42,981
Nope.

640
00:37:43,785 --> 00:37:46,150
I would remember somebody
telling me something like that.

641
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:49,941
So what's your answer?

642
00:37:52,445 --> 00:37:54,648
You send someone else to Miami...

643
00:37:55,392 --> 00:37:57,494
And I stay here. That's my answer.

644
00:37:57,746 --> 00:37:59,445
And I stay here. That's my answer.

645
00:37:59,799 --> 00:38:02,495
and I don't need you here. Not anymore.

646
00:38:03,958 --> 00:38:05,847
Carlos, I am sorry.

647
00:38:06,048 --> 00:38:08,354
I know I should've told
you when I first found out.

648
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:10,650
Believe me, I wish I had now. But...

649
00:38:12,071 --> 00:38:14,206
You can't fire me for being pregnant.

650
00:38:14,804 --> 00:38:17,300
I'm not firing you, Lynette.
I'm offering you a promotion.

651
00:38:18,303 --> 00:38:20,962
If you choose to turn it down and
quit instead, I can't stop you.

652
00:38:21,219 --> 00:38:23,218
All I can do is say good luck.

653
00:38:26,367 --> 00:38:28,323
And congratulations.

654
00:38:32,615 --> 00:38:35,868
No, it's late, and I
still gotta close up.

655
00:38:37,117 --> 00:38:38,067
Yeah, um...

656
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:41,019
tomorrow's no good either.

657
00:38:42,684 --> 00:38:44,947
Listen, you're a nice guy.

658
00:38:45,187 --> 00:38:47,138
I'm just not looking for
a relationship right now.

659
00:38:47,838 --> 00:38:48,986
Sorry.

660
00:38:49,746 --> 00:38:51,039
Hello?

661
00:38:54,857 --> 00:38:55,857
I know you girls think

662
00:38:56,064 --> 00:38:57,617
that's lettin' a guy down easy,

663
00:38:57,912 --> 00:38:59,657
but, uh, trust me, it ain't.

664
00:39:01,562 --> 00:39:03,561
You okay for now? I gotta
clean up in the back.

665
00:39:03,862 --> 00:39:06,313
Yeah. I'm good.

666
00:39:21,175 --> 00:39:22,674
Agent Padilla?

667
00:39:23,524 --> 00:39:25,627
Little memory quiz for you.

668
00:39:25,925 --> 00:39:27,789
This is black owl.

669
00:39:28,542 --> 00:39:31,188
Damn, Chris, still sharp as a tack, huh?

670
00:39:31,991 --> 00:39:34,138
No, no, no, no. Don't... don't
ask me anything. Don't talk.

671
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:35,842
This conversation will
last less than 60 seconds.

672
00:39:36,043 --> 00:39:37,541
We both know why.

673
00:39:38,796 --> 00:39:40,291
I'm thinking about comin' in.

674
00:39:40,701 --> 00:39:42,504
You interrupt me again, and I hang up.

675
00:39:42,744 --> 00:39:44,091
I said I was thinkin' about it.

676
00:39:44,313 --> 00:39:45,451
Now here's what you need to think about.

677
00:39:45,846 --> 00:39:47,149
I don't care what happens to me,

678
00:39:47,356 --> 00:39:49,494
but I have to know she gets a pass.

679
00:39:49,793 --> 00:39:51,852
There'll be no further discussion
on this until that is firm.

680
00:39:52,143 --> 00:39:55,294
Next time you hear from me, you will have an
answer to that question, and it better be yes.

681
00:40:03,499 --> 00:40:04,852
You eaves droppin' on me?

682
00:40:06,057 --> 00:40:07,458
No. No,

683
00:40:08,302 --> 00:40:09,751
I just got here.

684
00:40:10,102 --> 00:40:11,001
And I wanna go home.

685
00:40:17,958 --> 00:40:19,060
I'll see you.

686
00:40:24,907 --> 00:40:27,662
There is a coffee shop in Fairview.

687
00:40:29,031 --> 00:40:33,165
It's known as a place where you
can read your morning paper...

688
00:40:35,662 --> 00:40:38,114
where you can meet your friends...

689
00:40:39,663 --> 00:40:41,965
where you can have a cup of coffee

690
00:40:42,223 --> 00:40:44,272
at the end of a long day.

691
00:40:47,169 --> 00:40:48,315
Yes,

692
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:51,566
It was a place known for many things.

693
00:40:55,269 --> 00:40:57,771
Hey. Did you forget something?

694
00:40:59,319 --> 00:41:01,078
What are you doing?

695
00:41:09,173 --> 00:41:11,125
But after this night,

696
00:41:11,429 --> 00:41:13,382
it would be known for something...

697
00:41:16,726 --> 00:41:18,675
far worse.

698
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:26,000
