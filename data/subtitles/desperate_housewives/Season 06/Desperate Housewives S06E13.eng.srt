1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,340
Previously on desperate housewives

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:03,900
Principal Hobson just called

3
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:07,100
and Juanita got accepted to
Oakridge. There was acceptance...

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,040
I like the blunt ana
more than the cute ana.

5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,200
So you think I'm cute?

6
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,570
A plea... you have to let
me help you, or I am...

7
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,280
Or you won't get into heaven?

8
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,480
A breakdown... did you stab yourself?

9
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,250
I have to get to Mike! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

10
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,620
No! And a confrontation.

11
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,950
I don't know how you feel, Lynette,

12
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:30,210
- because you never talk about it!
- We lost a kid.

13
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,120
How can saying this out loud be helpful?

14
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,270
If you want to throw a
successful dinner party,

15
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:43,620
there are certain rules
that must be followed.

16
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,500
If the good silver is
used, it must be polished.

17
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:53,330
If music is played, the
volume should be low.

18
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:58,210
If the guests bring
wine, it must be served.

19
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:02,930
And if the evening is
to be truly successful...

20
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,880
There must be a toast.

21
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,680
To Lee. This dinner has
been a total triumph.

22
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,820
Oh, Bob!

23
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,450
And it's not over yet. I
made a fruit tart for dessert.

24
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,660
And in case any of you are diabetic,

25
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,760
let me just say... it
was nice knowing you.

26
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,410
No. Seriously,

27
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,960
this is how we lost his cousin.

28
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,970
Hey, Bob, where's the whipped cream?

29
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:27,530
Oh. I totally forgot.

30
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,570
I was on my phone and I
drove right past the store.

31
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,740
Of course, because it's
something that I needed.

32
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:36,480
I was working all day.
If it was that important,

33
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,480
why didn't you just go out and get it?

34
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,310
Uh, I work, too. Selling houses is work.

35
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,840
House.he's sold one house in six months.

36
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,020
Attacking.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,060
What... what's that?

38
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,430
My feelings journal.

39
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,740
Lee and I are seeing this counselor.

40
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,240
She has us write down
our negative feelings

41
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,110
to discuss in our sessions.

42
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:08,980
Seems like you got a lot
of feelings there, Lee.

43
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:11,510
That's volume three,
with an entire chapter

44
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:14,520
about me forgetting to
put down the toilet seat.

45
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,520
I thought that would
be the one advantage

46
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,920
with two guys living together.

47
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,260
You'd think.

48
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:26,100
Well, the good news is that
you're... you're getting help.

49
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,730
- You know, we should think about seeing someone.
- What?

50
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:32,000
You know, to help us with our stuff.

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,670
Can we talk about our stuff later?

52
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,740
We could, but you won't.

53
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,640
She... she never wants to talk.

54
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,850
You know how I feel about therapy.

55
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:46,050
It's for weak, indulgent...

56
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,190
Straight people. You
guys totally make it work.

57
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,560
I used to feel the
same way about therapy.

58
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,920
But this lady... she's really great.

59
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,630
Volume three?

60
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:01,060
Can't we give it a try?

61
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:03,930
I don't need someone
telling me how I feel, okay?

62
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,900
So could we just drop it?

63
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:13,610
And the number one rule for
a successful dinner party?

64
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,880
After dessert, let's karaoke!

65
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,550
Keep discussion of your marriage

66
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:22,150
to an absolute minimum.

67
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,330
Dr. Brent avedon was
the head of psychology

68
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:39,440
at the Fairview health center.

69
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,370
He spent his days treating
antisocial adolescents,

70
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:48,150
delusional dowagers...

71
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:52,500
And bipolar businessmen.

72
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,050
But lately, his most interesting patient

73
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,290
was a housewife

74
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:03,090
who'd had a nervous breakdown.

75
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,460
I was just so lonely.

76
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,530
And then one day,

77
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:11,540
along came this wonderful man...

78
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,070
A man who made me laugh,

79
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:17,340
who gave me hope again...

80
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:24,150
And who turned out to be
in love with someone else.

81
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:28,250
So I went back to being lonely.

82
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:32,490
Only it was worse now because...

83
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:33,960
He wasn't really gone.

84
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,290
He was across the street,

85
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,300
holding her hand,

86
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,630
laughing with her.

87
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:47,240
So one day...

88
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,240
I pretended,

89
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,340
just for a second...

90
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:57,610
That it wasn't her hand he was holding.

91
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:03,720
It was mine.

92
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:08,560
And that's how the fantasies started?

93
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,060
When I was hurting,

94
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,630
I would let myself imagine
that he was there with me.

95
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:23,340
But then those moments started to...

96
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:27,280
M... mean more to me than what was real.

97
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,010
So...

98
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,950
I just let myself have them.

99
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,790
I let them take over.

100
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,450
What about now?

101
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:40,760
Do you feel that the
medication is helping you?

102
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,930
Well, I certainly have a
firmer grasp on reality now.

103
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,570
I can see things,

104
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:55,270
for the first time in a long while,

105
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:58,180
very clearly.

106
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,780
That's great.

107
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,510
No.

108
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:05,020
Not really.

109
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:10,120
Because now I can see
what I've done to my life.

110
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,620
And...

111
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,890
How I've ruined it.

112
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:25,240
Okay, Orson, it's time for
me to give you your bath.

113
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,340
Not now.

114
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,910
Orson, you haven't
bathed in over a week.

115
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,980
Now I don't want to do
this any more than you do,

116
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,910
but frankly, you're
getting a little ripe.

117
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:39,520
I said I don't want a bath.

118
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,650
Well, it's not about
what you want anymore.

119
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,820
It's a matter of preserving the drapes.

120
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:48,530
To have another human being
bathe me is humiliating.

121
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:50,030
Here.

122
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:53,200
- What's this?
- A list of things I need at the store.

123
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,400
I just went to the store
for you an hour ago.

124
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,430
Can't it wait?

125
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:59,200
No. I need these items immediately.

126
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,540
It's urgent.

127
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,940
Orson, how are cornnuts urgent?

128
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,180
I'm sorry, Bree.

129
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,250
I just thought that since
you played a major part

130
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,250
in putting me in this chair,

131
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,790
you'd want to play a small part
in making my new life tolerable.

132
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:20,760
Give me the list.

133
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,260
Better yet,

134
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:27,700
leave it on the table
and then back away.

135
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,410
Hey, teach.

136
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:37,840
Hi!

137
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,680
I just dropped off
Juanita for her first day.

138
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,250
She's a little nervous.

139
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,810
Aw, she's gonna love it
here. The teachers are great.

140
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,580
- So what animal is she?
- Excuse me?

141
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:49,550
Oh, they test the kids

142
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:52,090
and they place them in groups
according to their level.

143
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:53,960
In math, there's leopards,
chipmunks, giraffes.

144
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,090
It should be in her folder.

145
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:58,860
Oh, she's a leopard.

146
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,330
What's M.J.?

147
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:05,830
He's a giraffe.

148
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,170
Oh. So...

149
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:10,040
Which is the advanced group?

150
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,540
No one knows.

151
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,010
They won't even tell me.

152
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:16,380
Principal hobson feels that
if the parents find out,

153
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,050
they'll freak and get all competitive.

154
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,620
That's crazy.

155
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,020
Who cares?

156
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,650
Exactly.

157
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,460
Leopards are the morons, aren't they?

158
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,300
No. I didn't say that.

159
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,800
Yeah, you did.

160
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,270
When I asked about M.J.,

161
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,730
you were like, "he's a giraffe!"

162
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:40,030
And then I said juita was a
leopard, and you were like, "oh."

163
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:45,240
You're just jumping to conclusions.

164
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,810
You know something.

165
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:50,040
Spill it!

166
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:52,150
Okay.

167
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:55,220
Uh, I don't know for sure,

168
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,490
but I teach these kids,
and it's pretty obvious.

169
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:01,160
We were making paper globes

170
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,760
this...

171
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,590
Is Rachel Miller.

172
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,290
Damn, that's good.

173
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,060
Huh. She's a giraffe.

174
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:11,370
And this is Wendy Benson.

175
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:12,770
Okay.

176
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:13,900
Chipmunk.

177
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,140
And this one was made by Adam hunter...

178
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,540
A leopard.

179
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:24,380
My God, it looks like an
actual leopard made it.

180
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:28,050
There's nothing wrong
with being a leopard.

181
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:30,490
They're very important here.

182
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:32,550
They... move the cafeteria tables,

183
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,820
excellent door holders.

184
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,790
This isn't fair.

185
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,260
Gaby, we have a saying around here.

186
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,960
"It's the pace, not the race."

187
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,030
I know my daughter. She is all giraffe.

188
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,900
I'm gonna go talk to the principal.

189
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,410
You don't push. You...

190
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,880
Sorry. My daughter wasn't
here to hold it for me.

191
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,690
Jeez, Lynette.

192
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:06,990
Dinner's ready. Go wash up.

193
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,860
What is that?

194
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,830
It's nothing. It's, uh...
it's, uh... it's personal.

195
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,860
Personal?

196
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,800
Yes.

197
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,700
And I think it's important that
we respect each other's boundaries.

198
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,770
This morning, you walked
in and sat on the toilet

199
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,700
while I shaved my legs.

200
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,670
We have no boundaries.

201
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:28,040
- Attacking.
- What?

202
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
You sound just like Bob
and... oh! Oh! Oh, my God!

203
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:32,950
Is that a feelings journal?

204
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:35,250
If you must know, yes, it is.

205
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,020
I started seeing their therapist.

206
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,420
Why didn't you tell me?

207
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,350
Because I wanted to talk to someone,

208
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,460
and I didn't need your ridicule.

209
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:46,190
Are you talking about the baby?

210
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:48,160
It started out about that.

211
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,800
But now we're on to, um... other things.

212
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,430
Other things? You mean like me?

213
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:56,240
I might've mentioned you once or twice.

214
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,270
Once or twice? Uh-huh.

215
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:01,440
I bet if we downed a shot every
time we read the name "Lynette,"

216
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,840
we'd be hammered by page two.

217
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,380
Let me see that.

218
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,650
Oh, no, no. No way.

219
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:14,790
But if your're really
interested in what's in here,

220
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,890
you can always join me in therapy.

221
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:18,890
Like hell.

222
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:21,700
Fine.

223
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:25,730
Then I guess you'll just
have to wait for the movie.

224
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,720
Here we go.

225
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,890
Thanks again for having me.
This all looks delicious.

226
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,930
Oh, it's your first night over.

227
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,730
I wanted to make you a
traditional Italian meal...

228
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:44,060
Rigatoni with sausage, chicken parmesan.

229
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,330
Just salad would be great.

230
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,370
Oh, screw the salad.
That came out of a bag.

231
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:50,270
This rigatoni came from my heart.

232
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:53,670
To be honest, I don't eat carbs.

233
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,710
Oh, but you'll make an exception tonight

234
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:58,080
'cause I've been sweatin'
over the stove all day.

235
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,750
Ma, let it go. She's
watching her weight.

236
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,750
Her weight? If I put the
air conditioner on high,

237
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,680
it'll blow her across the room.

238
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,620
I just have to be careful.

239
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,850
As soon as a graduate high school,
I'm going to New York to be a model.

240
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:12,690
Oh. No college?

241
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,590
Are you kidding? And miss
my prime modeling years?

242
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:23,230
What? I think it's great. It
takes guts to follow a dream.

243
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,600
Yeah, it's great, but it'd be nice

244
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:31,540
- to have something other than the porn industry to fall back on.
- Ma.

245
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,510
What? I'm not saying
that's gonna happen.

246
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:36,010
But, you know, a lot of
models do end up that way.

247
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:39,920
I know it's risky, but I'm
really passionate about this.

248
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,850
And I think that the best
way to be successful in life

249
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,860
is to do what you're passionate about.

250
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:48,260
That's why I keep telling
Danny to pursue his poetry.

251
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,890
Poetry?

252
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,000
Yeah. It's amazing, right?

253
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,560
I wouldn't know.

254
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:57,170
I'm too busy cooking
food nobody's gonna eat.

255
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:59,440
Danny, why didn't you
ever show me your poetry?

256
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,340
It's no big deal.

257
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,970
Danny, it's great.

258
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:05,840
I keep telling him he should
come to new York with me

259
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,280
so he can really focus on his writing.

260
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,150
Wow. A model and a poet.

261
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:15,680
So while you're doin' porn,
he can make the dialogue rhyme.

262
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:20,020
This is why I don't tell her stuff.

263
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:25,330
Okay.

264
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:28,460
I'm sorry. I was just
trying to make a joke.

265
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,670
Let's get back to dinner, huh?

266
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,170
Oh, no. I'm good.

267
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,810
Carbs. Mnh-mnh.

268
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,980
Oh, I'll be out running errands today,

269
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,310
so you'll have to let
the physical therapist in

270
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,320
when she arrives.

271
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,050
What's wrong?

272
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:52,890
There's no strawberries.

273
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:55,260
You know I like
strawberries with my waffles.

274
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,530
I am sorry. They're
right here. There you go.

275
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:01,530
Strawberries. Enjoy.

276
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:03,230
I need whipped cream.

277
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,900
Unless you think the strawberries

278
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,700
are gonna magically stick
to the waffles by themselves.

279
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:33,430
Not so fast.

280
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,160
Say "please."

281
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,600
I will not.

282
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,030
Now give me my breakfast.

283
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,870
Orson, I am happy to
do whatever you ask,

284
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,800
but I will not treated like a slave.

285
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,840
Now say "please."

286
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,950
Now that I look at your waffle,

287
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:55,080
i understand why you're
so eager to have it.

288
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,550
Bree...

289
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,110
You know the magic word.

290
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,360
It has six letters.

291
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,360
I know a word that has three.

292
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,990
If you don't give me my food,

293
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,330
I'm gonna shove that fork up it.

294
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,740
You can have it when
you're ready to be polite.

295
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,650
Mr. Hobson, my daughter
is incredibly bright.

296
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:29,720
I just need to know if she's
in the advanced classes.

297
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,620
You know that we have a
policy not to disclose that.

298
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,620
Oh, you don't have to say anything.

299
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,740
Just blink when I
mention the smart group.

300
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:36,990
Leopard.

301
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:37,810
Mrs. Solis...

302
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,460
Wait, was that a blink or a twitch?

303
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,560
I can't tell. You seem very nervous.

304
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,360
You see, this is exactly why
we don't tell the parents.

305
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:49,000
They start behaving irrationally.

306
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,770
And stop trying to read
things on my desk upside-down.

307
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,370
What is the big deal?

308
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:56,610
I just need to know

309
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:58,130
if my daughter's gonna succeed in life.

310
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:58,680
She's 7.

311
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,350
Now I suggest that you stop prying

312
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:06,690
and just be proud of her no
matter what group she's in.

313
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:10,960
I am proud of her, and I don't pry.

314
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:16,430
By the way, enjoy your
colonoscopy on the 16th.

315
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,340
Mom. What are you doing here?

316
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,470
I was just having a
nice get-to-know-you chat

317
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,770
with the principal.
Who are your friends?

318
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,010
Um, this is Wendy and Rachel.

319
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:32,610
We're in math together.

320
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:36,080
Wait a minute. I think
I saw your art projects.

321
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,420
Wendy, you're a chipmunk, right?

322
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,450
And, Rachel, you're a giraffe?

323
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,220
Oh, okay.

324
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:46,530
You know what I would love to do?

325
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:51,000
Is take a picture with
Juanita and her friends.

326
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,500
And, uh, you know what
would be really cute?

327
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,900
Is if you hold up your math homework.

328
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:04,810
Got it.

329
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:06,450
But I wasn't smiling.

330
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:08,810
Yeah? Well, it's a
tough world out there.

331
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,870
Not much to smile about.

332
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:11,780
Have a great day!

333
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:14,920
Your mom's weird.

334
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,620
You have no idea.

335
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,400
Orson?

336
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,370
I'm letting myself in.

337
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:36,310
Time for your therapy.

338
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,080
Help me!

339
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,050
Oh!

340
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:42,280
Help.

341
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,300
Oh! Dear lord!

342
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,460
Orson!

343
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,000
Oh! What happened?

344
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,500
Oh! Joyce.

345
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,270
Well, I was trying to get those waffles,

346
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,240
and I fell out of my chair.

347
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,580
W... w... what are they doing up there?

348
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:01,310
Starving him?

349
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:03,710
- That's ridiculous.
- Really?

350
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:05,580
So you don't torment him

351
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,450
by putting food out of his reach?

352
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:10,260
Oh. Well, you kinda had
to be there for that.

353
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,570
Can someone please get
me a piece of bread?

354
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:15,440
Orson, for God sakes! Stop that!

355
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,440
Please hit me in the legs this time.

356
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,770
There's no feeling there.

357
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:22,440
Mrs. Hodge, may I speak to
you privately for a moment?

358
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,400
You... you have to believe me.

359
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,520
I would never hit my husband.

360
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,210
I sensed him being a little dramatic.

361
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:37,320
But withholding food?

362
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:41,390
The whole thing started because
he refused to say please...

363
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,740
Which I know sounds rather petty,

364
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,510
but you have to understand.

365
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,540
He has been impossible lately.

366
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:52,070
The man is facing life in a wheelchair.

367
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:54,040
He's mad at the world,

368
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,680
and unfortunately, he's
taking it out on you.

369
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:03,120
Look... I know this is not easy.

370
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,320
But until he comes to accept this,

371
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,020
you're gonna have to figure
out how to be more patient.

372
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,130
And if you can't,

373
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:13,090
it's my obligation to report it.

374
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,440
Oh, and give the man a bath.

375
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,940
Physical therapy
shouldn't require gloves.

376
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,790
You weren't home when
they tried to deliver this,

377
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,590
so I signed for it.
Yeah, we just... we had,

378
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,030
uh, we saw an ad for...

379
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:38,100
Honest to God, don't need to know.

380
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,430
Good. Um...

381
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:41,200
Ah, look.

382
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,770
Looks like somebody
got a new girlfriend.

383
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:53,160
Yeah, not for long. I do not approve.

384
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:56,180
Ah. You don't approve,
and she's got a body

385
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:59,020
that would make the pope walk
through a sliding glass door.

386
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,170
Gosh, who's gonna win?

387
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:03,150
He is my kid. If I don't
think she is good for him,

388
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,590
I will do whatever I have to do.

389
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,460
Which will drive him towards
her and away from you.

390
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,030
Look, I know what it's like

391
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:13,330
when a mom hates the
hottie her son loves.

392
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,300
Bob's mom hated me. Ugh.

393
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,470
Huh. I always thought that Bob was...

394
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:19,100
the point is,

395
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,220
she overplayed her hand

396
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,910
and made Bob choose between us.

397
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:24,840
And the long story short,

398
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,850
I'm cuddling up with Bob every night.

399
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:27,990
And where's mama? Nursing home.

400
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:31,120
How'd she get there?
Don't know. Can't remember.

401
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,790
It's just... I don't know this girl.

402
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,510
And I... I... I don't
know if I can trust her.

403
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,160
Well, then you better get to know her.

404
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,120
I'd hate to see you lose your son

405
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:42,030
because you're afraid to share him.

406
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:45,300
Get outta here.

407
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:51,140
Carlos, did you get
the pictures I sent you?

408
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:53,100
You're as beautiful as the day we met.

409
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:55,010
Time hasn't touched you at all.

410
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:57,480
Not of me, of the math homework.

411
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,040
What?

412
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,640
Here.

413
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,610
This assignment looks easy, doesn't it?

414
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:04,520
Pretty basic, yeah.

415
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,890
And look at this one
with the multiplication,

416
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:09,990
little more complicated, right?

417
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:11,320
I guess.

418
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,260
And this one...

419
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,290
Word problems. Fractions.

420
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:17,860
This is the hardest one, isn't it?

421
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,690
Looks like it. So?

422
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:23,430
Carlos, this is the leopard's homework.

423
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:26,070
Well, that cleared that up.

424
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:29,400
No. Don't you get it?
Our daughter is a leopard.

425
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:30,040
She's in the advanced class.

426
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,040
Hey! Good for her.

427
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,210
Oh, poor Susan.

428
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,680
Yeah? Why?

429
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,320
Well, she was convinced
that M.J.'s brilliant,

430
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,750
and it turns out he's in the slow group.

431
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,290
I'd hate for her to find out.

432
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:47,860
- Gaby, you are not telling her.
- Why not?

433
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:51,040
She didn't have any trouble telling
me she thought Juanita was one

434
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,060
- thermos short of a lunch box.
- She said that?

435
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:56,130
Yes. With her tone.

436
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,740
Well, we've had enough drama
with the neighbors lately,

437
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,640
so just drop it.

438
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,040
Fine, I'll drop it.
But just so you know,

439
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,690
I like you better when you're reading
the newspaper pretending to listen.

440
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:09,080
Sure, take whatever you need.

441
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:24,260
What are you doing here?

442
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,560
I told them I don't want any visitors.

443
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,680
Who says I'm visiting?

444
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,400
Maybe I'm bonkers, too.

445
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,600
Gonna eat the applesauce?

446
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:41,140
Remember when my gout flared
up and I couldn't walk?

447
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,710
And you used to come over to see me?

448
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,580
I figured I owe ya.

449
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,490
Debt paid. Goodbye.

450
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:52,690
I see you got your
charming personality back.

451
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,630
So... when are you gonna
be coming back home?

452
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:00,560
What makes you think
I would ever come back?

453
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:04,100
After what I did to those
people? No. They hate me.

454
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:07,070
Take it from the reigning
odd duck on the Lane,

455
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:10,140
nobody cares about all that silly stuff.

456
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:13,040
Oh, you're right. Bree and I
can just laugh, laugh, laugh

457
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,640
about silly me nearly
destroying her business.

458
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,870
And I'll tell Susan that
I was just joshing about

459
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:20,920
- trying to wreck her marriage.
- Yeah. Okay. Okay.

460
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,120
Oh, and I'll bet Mike is still chuckling

461
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,150
about me getting him thrown in jail.

462
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:27,720
Will you listen? Kathy, I'm serious.

463
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,190
I'm willing to bet

464
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:32,060
there's more forgiveness
there than you imagine.

465
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,890
In that case, you know what?

466
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,330
What?

467
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:38,600
Maybe you are bonkers.

468
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,880
Hey, hon.

469
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,080
Look who's here.

470
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,370
Hey, Susan. What's up?

471
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,320
I was going through
some of M.J.'s stuff,

472
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,150
and I found these math
workbooks from last year.

473
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:59,650
I thought Juanita
would find them helpful.

474
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:01,120
Well...

475
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:05,590
Thank you.

476
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:09,420
No problem. I thought it
might help her catch up.

477
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,000
Catch up?

478
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:16,960
Yeah. You know, from when
she was out of school.

479
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,970
She was never out of school,

480
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:21,460
I was homeschooling her.

481
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,380
And I know you did the best you could.

482
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,720
But now she has professional teachers,

483
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,670
and I bet she's gonna
catch up to M.J. in no time.

484
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:34,650
Get her.

485
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,730
Well, Susan...

486
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:40,130
Ahem, by the way, did you hear?

487
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:42,940
Leopards are the advanced students.

488
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,440
What?

489
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,510
Yeah. It's true. Chipmunks are average.

490
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,010
And giraffes...

491
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:51,310
well, those cafeteria tables
aren't gonna move themselves.

492
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:54,280
How do you know this?

493
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,450
I got a copy of each group's homework.

494
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:59,050
Trust me. I cracked the code.

495
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:01,450
So that means that M.J.'s not in the...

496
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:03,860
Hey, but you said it
yourself... it's no big deal.

497
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,820
"It's the pace, not the race," right?

498
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,760
Right.

499
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,330
Oh, and please, don't
say anything to anyone.

500
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:12,660
You know how competitive
some parents can get.

501
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:15,230
Huh. Yeah.

502
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,640
All too well.

503
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:25,590
I'm finished. Can I have
my milk and cookies now?

504
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,400
Sure, sweetie.

505
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,270
You have some pasta stuck to
the right side of your face.

506
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,170
No, sweetie. Your right.

507
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:44,080
Oh, never mind.

508
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,680
Hey, guys.

509
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,910
Mike, can you help
me take out the trash?

510
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,250
Sure.

511
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:52,390
Never mind that.

512
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:55,690
Okay, so he's a giraffe.

513
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:57,390
You know, there's nothing
wrong with being average.

514
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,890
No, chipmunks are average.

515
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,090
How many times do I have to tell you?

516
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,300
Leopards, chipmunks, giraffes.

517
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,700
I love him so much, Mike.

518
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,070
What if he's...

519
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,640
Slow?

520
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,870
He's not slow.

521
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:16,040
He's a smart, inquisitive,
bright little boy.

522
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,610
Oh, no.

523
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:27,450
He's got his hand stuck in the glass.

524
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:28,850
Oh, come on, buddy.

525
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:32,620
Come on. Just... just hold the glass.

526
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,730
Pull with the other hand.

527
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,670
You can do it.

528
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:43,770
Come on, M.J.

529
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,270
Yes!

530
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,540
Oh! Yes!

531
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,810
See? You were worried about nothing.

532
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:51,610
You're right. Oh.

533
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,950
Oh, no.

534
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:57,180
He's heading toward
the toaster with a fork!

535
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,910
Honey?

536
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:22,340
Yeah?

537
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,280
- I'm heading out.
- Okay. Mwah. Wanna grab lunch today?

538
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,980
Uh, maybe tomorrow. I have a... a thing.

539
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,420
If you mean therapy,

540
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,750
why not just say "therapy"?

541
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:36,750
I just didn't want to get
into a fight. That's all.

542
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,460
Hey. Won't you need this?

543
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:42,390
Ah. Right. Thanks.

544
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:45,300
Don't you wanna know if I read it?

545
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,370
Oh. I'd know if you read it.

546
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,630
Excuse me. Are you
waiting for dr. Graham?

547
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:12,100
Don't tell me she double-booked again.

548
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,130
Oh, no. I don't have an appointment.

549
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,800
But I really need to talk to her,

550
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,800
so can I have yours?

551
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:20,740
I don't know. I really
need to talk to her, too.

552
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,340
Seriously? Because I was
looking at you thinking,

553
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,350
what is he doing here?

554
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:27,310
That guy's really got it together.

555
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:31,020
Thanks. But I'm been having
a pretty hard time lately.

556
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,990
- I'll give you 200 bucks.
- Cash?

557
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:34,920
20's okay?

558
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,460
So, um...

559
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:41,360
What were you going
to talk to her about?

560
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,530
I'm starting to feel
the urge to gamble again.

561
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:46,300
Thanks.

562
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:53,040
Mr. Jameson?

563
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,140
He had to go,

564
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,680
but he said I could
have his appointment.

565
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,910
I'm sorry, but it
doesn't work like that.

566
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,580
If you're interested
in becoming a patient...

567
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,950
I'm not. I am Mrs. Tom Scavo.

568
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:10,960
Yep, that's what I thought.

569
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:16,630
Well, I don't blame you
for reacting like that.

570
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:19,900
I can only imagine the stories
Tom's been reading to you

571
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:23,740
from his big book of wah!

572
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:26,270
So... here I am,

573
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:30,240
Tom Scavo's bitch of
a wife, in the flesh.

574
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,950
Why do you put it like that?

575
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:35,580
I don't know specifically

576
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,630
what word he uses.

577
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:41,000
I'm just picking the one
that seems the most likely.

578
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,200
So you think your husband
describes you as a bitch?

579
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,840
Doesn't he?

580
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,040
What Tom says in this room is private.

581
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,270
Which means yes?

582
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,440
Well, obviously, it does to you.

583
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:56,680
I'm just wondering why that might be.

584
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:00,450
Oh, I see what you're trying to do,

585
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:02,350
but I did not come here for therapy.

586
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:04,390
I came here to defend myself.

587
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:06,360
Because there's two
sides to every story.

588
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,930
So you're not a bitch?

589
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:10,730
Not all the time, no.

590
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:13,230
But sometimes?

591
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,900
I just...

592
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,870
Need...

593
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:22,810
Want to feel like I'm in control,

594
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,120
and when I don't,

595
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,580
that makes me mad. And...

596
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:31,120
Maybe I'm mad a lot

597
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,220
because I don't know if you've noticed,

598
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:37,030
but you can't control
what happens in life.

599
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:42,400
Like your baby dying?

600
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:53,540
I'm going to sit down, but only...

601
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,810
Because I'm tired.

602
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:04,690
Unless you need to go or something.

603
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:08,090
No. I don't need to go anywhere.

604
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:20,810
How was your day?

605
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:22,780
Is that a...

606
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:25,620
Yep. Looks like we'll be
going to therapy together.

607
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:28,720
Really? That is great news. Thank you.

608
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:37,760
W... where's dinner?

609
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,730
I mean, you were home all day.

610
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:48,710
What are you writing?

611
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:51,080
You'll find out, Tuesday at 12:30.

612
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,030
Colleen! Can I talk to you?

613
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,970
Uh, I've got
parent-teacher conferences,

614
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:03,840
but not for a few minutes. What's up?

615
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,640
It's about M.J. How is he
doing in your math class?

616
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,040
Oh, he's such a joy.

617
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,540
Oh, God.

618
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:14,010
You just did the "he's such
a joy" with the head tilt.

619
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:16,010
I give that one to parents all the time

620
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,300
when I think their kid is driftwood.

621
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,450
No, seriously, M.J.'s doing great.

622
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:23,520
Oh, really? Well, if
he's doing so great...

623
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,390
Why is he a giraffe?

624
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:27,290
What?

625
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:29,260
He should be a leopard.

626
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:32,330
- They're the advanced students.
- You don't know that.

627
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:33,290
I do now.

628
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:34,600
Gaby Solis broke the code.

629
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:37,830
What?

630
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:40,160
That's right. Giraffes
are the slow learners,

631
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:42,730
- and you know it.
- Giraffes are the slow learners?

632
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:44,800
No, no, no, Mrs.
Chapman. No one said that.

633
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,170
Why don't you wait
for me in my classroom?

634
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:50,070
Gabrielle Solis figured out the code

635
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,040
leopards, chipmunks, giraffes.

636
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,610
Jenny, we got the code!

637
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:57,050
Leopards are the smart ones!

638
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:58,880
Now look at what you've done.

639
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,350
M.J. is here. He's a leopard.

640
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:03,960
Get used to it.

641
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:08,630
Where have you been?

642
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:11,100
I needed to close the door.

643
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:15,820
Oh, uh, well, I thought a
little fresh air would be nice.

644
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,000
Hmm, it isn't.

645
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,360
Well, as the person
who has to share a house

646
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:23,300
with the person who won't take
a bath, I need the fresh air.

647
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,830
I don't care. Close it.

648
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,700
Orson...

649
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:31,710
I know that you are angry
at the world right now.

650
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:34,280
What happened to you is unimaginable,

651
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:37,080
and I am gonna do whatever I
can to help you through this.

652
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,170
And all I ask in return
is that you treat me

653
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:40,670
with a little bit of courtesy,

654
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,290
and that includes
using the word "please."

655
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:46,040
Why the sudden interest
in etiquette, Bree?

656
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,240
I mean, I don't recall
you saying "please"

657
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,240
before you cheated on me.

658
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,240
This conversation is
over. The door stays open.

659
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,300
I want it closed.

660
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,110
No. You stink.

661
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:56,980
And you're a whore!

662
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:58,580
Here's the difference...

663
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,950
I can get clean.

664
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:08,090
Yes, you can.

665
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,570
What are you doing?

666
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:22,200
What is going on? I'm not even dressed.

667
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:30,380
What is that? What... what
is that? What's going on?

668
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:33,410
Bree, stop.

669
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:41,560
You wouldn't.

670
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,160
Okay, Bree, stop it.

671
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:46,030
Stop. Bree.

672
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:49,000
If only there was a word you
could use to get me to stop,

673
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,600
like "please."

674
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,900
- I'm calling Joyce.
- Say "please."

675
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,840
Go to hell!

676
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,640
Why can't you just say
it? It's easy. Please.

677
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,640
Please. Please.

678
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,850
Please, please, please, please,

679
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,580
- Please, please, please, please.
-Please stop!

680
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,880
Please, please! Please stop it!

681
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,750
Please stop!

682
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:09,520
Please roll me over. Please
help me off the toilet.

683
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,820
Please, please, please!

684
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:17,090
That's the life I'm facing now,

685
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:20,070
having to ask people
for help for everything.

686
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:22,070
Do you know how hard that is?!

687
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,810
Every morning I wake up at 5:00.

688
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:26,810
You get upt 6:30. For
an hour and a half,

689
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:28,810
I lie there, staring
at the bedroom door,

690
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,180
fantasizing about how
lovely it would be...

691
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:34,320
how excruciatingly lovely it would be...

692
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:39,090
to get up and make myself
a cup of tea one last time.

693
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:40,890
No "please."

694
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:44,830
Just hot water and tea.

695
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:02,880
Orson...

696
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,020
I'm so sorry.

697
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:09,860
Forgive me.

698
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,660
Please.

699
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,560
What are you in for?

700
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,690
Eating paste.

701
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,830
What animal group are you?

702
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:36,100
Giraffe.

703
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,530
Damn.

704
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:42,030
Joey Murphy.

705
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:50,410
I'll be with you two in a moment.

706
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:56,450
Sorry for getting you in trouble.

707
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,490
It's my own fault.

708
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:02,620
I got carried away.

709
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,620
Me, too.

710
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:08,060
It was just so important to
me that Juanita was doing well.

711
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,430
I know.

712
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:15,670
No, I don't think you do.

713
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:18,340
My kids are my calling card.

714
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:20,700
They're what I have to show for myself.

715
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:24,410
I don't have a career,
Susan. My kids are my job.

716
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:27,380
And whatever happens... if they
succeed or they don't succeed...

717
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:30,180
it's because of how I raise them.

718
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,150
Well, at least you get to raise them.

719
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,010
Ever since I took this job,

720
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:35,150
I feel like I'm never with M.J.

721
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:38,190
I constantly worry. Am
I there enough for him?

722
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,860
Am I letting him down?

723
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,790
You don't have anything to worry about.

724
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:44,330
M.J.'s a fantastic kid.

725
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:47,470
Well, so is Juanita.

726
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:52,550
Their moms are competitive nuts.

727
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,780
This has been so ridiculous.

728
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,910
Leopards and giraffes and chipmunks

729
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:59,380
I mean, who created this crazy system?

730
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,310
You know, reading class is just as bad.

731
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:02,830
There's otters, penguins and seals.

732
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:04,350
Yeah, Juanita's an otter.

733
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:07,820
I mean, what does an otter have
to do with learning how to read?

734
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,520
Juanita's an otter?

735
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,520
Yeah.

736
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,990
- Why? What's M.J.?
- Penguin.

737
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:35,350
This is pretty. What do you think?

738
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:38,050
I think maybe I'd buy
it for my grandma...

739
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:39,780
If I hated her.

740
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:43,090
You're so funny.

741
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:46,420
So... as much fun as we're having here,

742
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:48,460
why are we doing this?

743
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,690
We are getting to know each other.

744
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:54,800
You know me, and you don't like me.

745
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,870
It's not that I don't like you.

746
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:03,370
It's just, I don't think
you're good for Danny.

747
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:06,860
Why? Because I wouldn't eat your pasta?

748
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,680
Rigatoni.

749
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,250
And no.

750
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:14,280
It's because you are a
good-time girl out to have fun.

751
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:17,250
Not that I blame you for it.
You're young. You're beautiful.

752
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:19,150
You're supposed to have fun.

753
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,190
But Danny has been through a lot,

754
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:24,390
and he needs someone who
is not gonna hurt him.

755
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:26,860
I know Danny has been
through rough stuff.

756
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:30,400
When he lashes out
and gets all defensive,

757
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,330
trying to protect himself?

758
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:35,370
I get it, because I used to do it, too.

759
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:38,210
Yeah?

760
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:41,080
It's the thing that made me like him.

761
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,450
I know how he feels,

762
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:46,950
and it's not fun at all.

763
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:50,850
I don't care if you like me

764
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:53,690
and I don't care if
you hate how I dress,

765
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:56,560
but I am not gona hurt Danny.

766
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,030
How can I be sure of that?

767
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:00,560
You can't.

768
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,400
But it doesn't matter,

769
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,170
'cause I'm not going anywhere.

770
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,550
What are you doing back here?

771
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:21,520
I've been thinking about
what you said last time.

772
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,420
The more I thought about it,
the more it pissed me off.

773
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,350
Why is that?

774
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:29,390
The people on that street have
been your friends for years.

775
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:31,760
You really think we would dump your ass

776
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,630
just 'cause you went off
the deep end for some months?

777
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,800
I appreciate you coming here. I do.

778
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,740
But after everything I did,

779
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,770
i don't see how anyone could forgive me.

780
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:46,370
Well we're not saying it'll be easy.

781
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:51,550
But we'll give it a try.

782
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:02,320
I told them how much
better you were doing,

783
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,720
but they couldn't take my word for it,

784
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:07,090
so they had to see for themselves.

785
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:50,230
In our darkest moments,

786
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,810
we all need someone who will listen.

787
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:57,040
Some turn to friendly professionals.

788
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:02,380
A few rely on those
who are older and wiser.

789
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:04,220
Others seek out

790
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:09,050
someone who knows what
they're going through.

791
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:11,860
But for most of us,

792
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:15,560
nothing is quite so therapeutic

793
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:22,130
as a good long talk
with a few old friends.
