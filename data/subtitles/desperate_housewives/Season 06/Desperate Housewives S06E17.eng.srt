1
00:00:05,254 --> 00:00:07,756
I wanna learn the business
from the ground up,

2
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,291
and then I wanna help you expand it.

3
00:00:09,363 --> 00:00:11,564
- Bree...
- Mr. Allen?

4
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,466
- Hired a new employee.
- Now you can sit.

5
00:00:14,101 --> 00:00:15,968
You should be saying,
"great, Ana. Go for it!"

6
00:00:16,003 --> 00:00:18,571
Gaby thought she had ended a romance.

7
00:00:18,605 --> 00:00:20,373
- Where's Danny?
- New York.

8
00:00:20,407 --> 00:00:22,208
Danny went to find Ana.

9
00:00:22,242 --> 00:00:23,910
You have to leave.

10
00:00:23,944 --> 00:00:25,878
Robin was asked to go,

11
00:00:25,913 --> 00:00:27,813
but Katherine...

12
00:00:27,848 --> 00:00:31,317
had a change of heart.

13
00:00:36,723 --> 00:00:40,860
Preston Scavo was finally
coming home from Europe,

14
00:00:40,894 --> 00:00:42,828
and his family was wondering

15
00:00:42,863 --> 00:00:45,498
what kind of souvenirs
he'd be bringing them.

16
00:00:45,532 --> 00:00:50,369
His brother wanted an army
knife from Switzerland.

17
00:00:50,437 --> 00:00:54,540
His sister wanted some
wooden shoes from Holland.

18
00:00:54,574 --> 00:00:59,211
His father wanted some
cheese from Bavaria.

19
00:00:59,246 --> 00:01:00,746
And his mother?

20
00:01:00,781 --> 00:01:02,581
Well, all she wanted

21
00:01:02,616 --> 00:01:06,519
was to hold her little boy in her arms...

22
00:01:06,553 --> 00:01:08,921
Guess who's back!

23
00:01:08,956 --> 00:01:12,191
But she'd soon discover her little boy

24
00:01:12,225 --> 00:01:14,260
wasn't so little anymore.

25
00:01:15,896 --> 00:01:18,420
Hey! Let me at him! I get the first hug!

26
00:01:18,421 --> 00:01:19,999
Oh, mom, you're huge!

27
00:01:20,033 --> 00:01:21,934
I know. Well, look at you.

28
00:01:21,969 --> 00:01:24,370
Porter, now you don't have to grow a
mustache to see how bad it would look.

29
00:01:24,404 --> 00:01:26,939
What'd you bring me?

30
00:01:26,974 --> 00:01:28,418
Penny, he just walked in.

31
00:01:28,419 --> 00:01:30,854
Give him a chance to unpack
and give me my cheese.

32
00:01:30,888 --> 00:01:32,515
Actually, I do have a little surprise.

33
00:01:32,516 --> 00:01:34,057
Oh, there's plenty of time for that.

34
00:01:34,091 --> 00:01:35,925
You've been traveling all day.

35
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,775
You probably want to
take a shower or a nap.

36
00:01:37,776 --> 00:01:39,095
No, I kinda need to do this now.

37
00:01:39,129 --> 00:01:40,446
- Yeah, mom.
- You are really gonna

38
00:01:40,447 --> 00:01:43,733
- want to see the surprise.
- Okay, I'm a little nervous.

39
00:01:43,734 --> 00:01:45,602
Uh, maybe I should explain.

40
00:01:45,636 --> 00:01:48,404
No, you don't need to explain.
I'm sure we're gonna love it.

41
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:50,373
Uh, everyone...

42
00:01:50,407 --> 00:01:52,775
I'd like you to meet Irina.

43
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,210
Hello.

44
00:01:54,245 --> 00:01:57,947
I am finally to meet the
lovely Preston family.

45
00:01:59,917 --> 00:02:03,453
Nice to meet you, Irina.

46
00:02:03,487 --> 00:02:06,089
Um, Preston didn't say
he was bringing a friend.

47
00:02:06,123 --> 00:02:08,858
Oh, she's more than a
friend, mom. We're in love.

48
00:02:10,895 --> 00:02:13,463
Yes, Preston Scavo had
returned from his trip

49
00:02:13,497 --> 00:02:15,999
with a beautiful souvenir,

50
00:02:16,033 --> 00:02:21,437
and his mother would soon wish he hadn't.

51
00:02:31,782 --> 00:02:35,051
Sometimes you must wash away the mud

52
00:02:35,085 --> 00:02:39,255
to reveal that sparkling
yellow underneath.

53
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:43,660
Sometimes you must carry
the flower into the sunlight

54
00:02:43,694 --> 00:02:47,430
to appreciate the redness the Rose.

55
00:02:47,464 --> 00:02:50,867
Sometimes you have to
take off the wrapping

56
00:02:50,901 --> 00:02:55,838
to understand just how
green a bike can be.

57
00:02:55,873 --> 00:02:59,509
And if you want to see
a woman's true colors,

58
00:02:59,543 --> 00:03:03,479
just make her feel unnecessary.

59
00:03:03,514 --> 00:03:07,283
- Ana you're doing it again!
- But you can't see my face.

60
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:08,329
This is a tool calendar.

61
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,951
It's gonna be hanging in
some fat mechanic's basement,

62
00:03:10,952 --> 00:03:13,008
and he won't be looking at your face.

63
00:03:13,009 --> 00:03:15,288
I came to New York to be a fashion model.

64
00:03:15,323 --> 00:03:18,492
I came to make art
films. Isn't life funny?

65
00:03:18,526 --> 00:03:20,093
I'm getting a doughnut.

66
00:03:20,128 --> 00:03:23,730
You have two minutes for
an attitude adjustment.

67
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,134
Hey, Ana.

68
00:03:27,168 --> 00:03:29,836
What are you doing here?

69
00:03:29,871 --> 00:03:32,061
I've been looking everywhere for you.

70
00:03:32,062 --> 00:03:34,074
You wasted your time. We broke up.

71
00:03:34,108 --> 00:03:36,643
We were broken up by your aunt.

72
00:03:36,677 --> 00:03:38,513
She doesn't care about your career.

73
00:03:38,514 --> 00:03:42,549
All she's ever cared about
is keeping us apart...

74
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:45,051
And that's why she sent you here.

75
00:03:45,086 --> 00:03:46,753
Oh, my God!

76
00:03:46,788 --> 00:03:49,689
That's why the agency's
only been sending me out

77
00:03:49,724 --> 00:03:53,093
on these crappy jobs.
It all makes sense now.

78
00:03:55,062 --> 00:03:57,063
We got a lot of catching u to do.

79
00:03:57,098 --> 00:04:00,467
Can we go somewhere and talk?

80
00:04:00,501 --> 00:04:03,470
Come on, January. Time is money.

81
00:04:06,007 --> 00:04:07,774
I quit.

82
00:04:09,343 --> 00:04:11,445
Gaby, you in here?

83
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:12,479
Yeah.

84
00:04:12,513 --> 00:04:14,481
I need Ana's address in New York.

85
00:04:14,515 --> 00:04:18,618
I'm on my way to the airport.

86
00:04:18,653 --> 00:04:22,122
- Why would you need that?
- Because Danny ran off to find her.

87
00:04:22,156 --> 00:04:24,958
Well, I will save you the trip,

88
00:04:24,992 --> 00:04:27,160
'cause if Danny finds Ana,
she'll send him packing.

89
00:04:27,195 --> 00:04:29,296
She wants nothing to do with your son.

90
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,198
She'll tell you herself.

91
00:04:31,232 --> 00:04:33,533
Hey, this is Ana. Leave a message.

92
00:04:33,568 --> 00:04:36,670
And if you're my aunt
Gaby, I know what you did.

93
00:04:36,704 --> 00:04:38,805
Drop dead.

94
00:04:40,641 --> 00:04:44,244
Hold that cab. I'm coming with you.

95
00:04:48,649 --> 00:04:51,418
Wow. Aren't you a little
overdressed for bacon and eggs?

96
00:04:51,452 --> 00:04:53,053
And buttered toast.

97
00:04:53,087 --> 00:04:54,588
Oh, buttered toast.

98
00:04:54,622 --> 00:04:57,657
Well, if I'd known that, I
would have worn my formal boxers.

99
00:04:57,692 --> 00:04:59,726
So... do you like it?

100
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,729
I got the check from the
sale of the strip club,

101
00:05:02,763 --> 00:05:04,731
and I decided to treat myself.

102
00:05:04,765 --> 00:05:06,733
Plus, I figured I needed something to wear

103
00:05:06,767 --> 00:05:09,336
- when we go to Chez Naomi.
- Chez Naomi?

104
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,738
Why don't we just stay home and eat money?

105
00:05:11,772 --> 00:05:14,641
Because you promised to take me there

106
00:05:14,675 --> 00:05:18,812
- to celebrate paying your business loan off.
- Well, I'm sorry,

107
00:05:18,846 --> 00:05:22,082
- but that loan is years away from being paid off.
- Not anymore.

108
00:05:22,116 --> 00:05:25,185
- I took care of it.
- You did what?

109
00:05:25,219 --> 00:05:28,622
- With the check I got.
- What the hell did you do that for?

110
00:05:28,656 --> 00:05:31,591
Okay, what I think you meant to say was,

111
00:05:31,626 --> 00:05:33,793
"Thanks, Susan. You're
the best wife ever."

112
00:05:33,828 --> 00:05:37,097
That loan was my responsibility.

113
00:05:37,131 --> 00:05:39,165
You were paying 9% interest.

114
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,535
You were never gonna pay that loan off.

115
00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:43,837
Look, I appreciate it.

116
00:05:43,871 --> 00:05:46,873
But in the future, just
check with me first, okay?

117
00:05:46,908 --> 00:05:49,409
Okay. I'm gonna take out the trash.

118
00:05:49,443 --> 00:05:51,177
Now?

119
00:05:51,212 --> 00:05:53,079
Lee's getting his mail.

120
00:05:53,114 --> 00:05:56,683
He can't see my new dress in here.

121
00:05:58,553 --> 00:06:01,521
Think about it. You already
specialize in comfort food...

122
00:06:01,556 --> 00:06:04,257
marry that with a creole or Cajun twist.

123
00:06:04,292 --> 00:06:05,725
It's a no-brainer.

124
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,028
It's brilliant. I love it.

125
00:06:08,062 --> 00:06:10,397
You love what?

126
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:13,466
Sam just came up with the
idea for my next cookbook...

127
00:06:13,534 --> 00:06:15,969
"Down home cooking with Mrs. Van De Kamp."

128
00:06:16,003 --> 00:06:18,772
Thank you, Sam.

129
00:06:22,677 --> 00:06:24,077
"To my darling Sam...

130
00:06:24,145 --> 00:06:27,013
I couldn't make it through
the day without you."

131
00:06:27,048 --> 00:06:28,604
- What was that?
- Ah, it's the,

132
00:06:28,605 --> 00:06:30,884
uh, dedication page to your new cookbook,

133
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:32,319
I'm guessing.

134
00:06:32,353 --> 00:06:34,287
Oh, and I have your first recipe...

135
00:06:34,322 --> 00:06:36,389
apple brown-nose Betty.

136
00:06:36,424 --> 00:06:38,191
That's, uh, Sam's specialty.

137
00:06:38,225 --> 00:06:40,327
Since when is hard work brown-nosing?

138
00:06:40,361 --> 00:06:43,229
That young man is the
first one here every morning

139
00:06:43,264 --> 00:06:44,718
and the last one to leave at night.

140
00:06:44,719 --> 00:06:46,132
Yeah, well, it takes a lot of time

141
00:06:46,167 --> 00:06:48,401
to turn all that water into wine.

142
00:06:48,436 --> 00:06:50,804
Well, I am sorry you don't appreciate him.

143
00:06:50,838 --> 00:06:53,173
I think he's tremendous.

144
00:06:53,207 --> 00:06:56,543
In fact, I have decided.

145
00:06:56,577 --> 00:06:58,244
A promotion to what?

146
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:00,246
Vice president.

147
00:07:00,281 --> 00:07:03,583
Hey, check my stationery.
I'm vice president.

148
00:07:03,618 --> 00:07:05,051
Well, a company can have more than one.

149
00:07:05,086 --> 00:07:07,420
There's plenty of work to go around.

150
00:07:07,455 --> 00:07:09,656
I don't believe this.

151
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:12,826
You barely know the guy. I'm your son.

152
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,828
I know you don't understand this now,

153
00:07:14,862 --> 00:07:17,831
but I am doing what I think
is best for both of us.

154
00:07:17,865 --> 00:07:19,299
Remember that sentence.

155
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:22,736
You'll be hearing it the day
I put you in a nursing home.

156
00:07:44,122 --> 00:07:45,658
Oh. Did I wake you?

157
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:48,333
Uh, no, I just didn't
get much sleep last night.

158
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:49,591
- What's going on?
- Well, I was

159
00:07:49,592 --> 00:07:51,470
just on my way to buy
some overpriced shoes

160
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:54,539
to go with my overpriced
dress. You wanna come?

161
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:57,309
Oh, thanks, but it's...

162
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:58,877
Not a good time.

163
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:00,379
Is everything okay?

164
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:02,347
Yeah. Fine. Gotta go.

165
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:03,982
Oh.

166
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:07,185
Please don't shut me out, Katherine.

167
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:10,089
Now that you're home from the hospital,

168
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:13,125
I want us to go back to
the way we used to be.

169
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,963
There was a time you and I
could tell each other anything.

170
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,364
Oh, hey, Susan.

171
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:21,734
Morning, hon. I'll go
make the coffee. Uh...

172
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,444
So...

173
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:34,447
Anything you wanna tell me?

174
00:08:56,153 --> 00:08:58,888
Yeah?

175
00:08:58,922 --> 00:09:02,258
- Are you Rose De Luca?
- Why?

176
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:05,294
I think you're my grandma.

177
00:09:05,329 --> 00:09:09,132
Tyler?

178
00:09:14,623 --> 00:09:17,225
So after we get to
Manhattan, what's our plan?

179
00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:18,627
We go to Ana's modeling agency.

180
00:09:18,628 --> 00:09:20,562
I know that world.
It's all interconnected.

181
00:09:20,597 --> 00:09:22,998
Someone will know someone.

182
00:09:23,032 --> 00:09:24,547
Oh. How do you know that
world? Were you a model?

183
00:09:24,548 --> 00:09:26,502
Yeah. You didn't know?

184
00:09:26,536 --> 00:09:29,204
Big-time. I was even
on the cover of "Vogue."

185
00:09:29,239 --> 00:09:32,871
Really? What happened?

186
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:35,677
I decided I wanted a different
kind of life and married Carlos.

187
00:09:35,712 --> 00:09:38,146
Wow. Good for you.

188
00:09:41,985 --> 00:09:44,253
So...

189
00:09:44,287 --> 00:09:46,288
What?

190
00:09:46,322 --> 00:09:48,757
It's just, I shared
something about my past,

191
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:51,309
and I know nothing about
yours, like where you grew up

192
00:09:51,362 --> 00:09:54,698
or where you lived
before moving to Fairview.

193
00:09:55,732 --> 00:09:58,034
Oh, my past isn't that interesting.

194
00:09:58,068 --> 00:10:00,269
Oh, come on. I shared stuff about me.

195
00:10:00,303 --> 00:10:03,439
Telling me you were a supermodel
is not sharing. It's bragging.

196
00:10:03,473 --> 00:10:05,307
It's not bragging when it's the truth.

197
00:10:05,342 --> 00:10:06,972
And the fact is, I was very successful.

198
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:08,310
Well, if you were so successful,

199
00:10:08,345 --> 00:10:10,056
how come I've never heard of you before?

200
00:10:10,057 --> 00:10:12,281
Because you had to be
looking in a fashion magazine,

201
00:10:12,315 --> 00:10:14,884
and I doubt you were ever doing that.

202
00:10:14,918 --> 00:10:17,453
Are we done sharing?

203
00:10:17,487 --> 00:10:19,822
Oh, yeah.

204
00:10:21,758 --> 00:10:25,227
Wow. So Paris, Prague, Madrid...

205
00:10:25,261 --> 00:10:27,429
it sounds like you guys saw everything.

206
00:10:27,463 --> 00:10:30,232
But you still haven't
told us how you two met.

207
00:10:30,266 --> 00:10:34,469
Well, uh, the first time I saw
Irina was on a beach in Nice.

208
00:10:34,504 --> 00:10:36,772
It, was, uh, how you say in English?

209
00:10:36,806 --> 00:10:38,740
The...

210
00:10:38,775 --> 00:10:40,108
T... topless?

211
00:10:40,143 --> 00:10:41,476
Yes!

212
00:10:41,511 --> 00:10:43,779
Oh, you real did see everything.

213
00:10:43,813 --> 00:10:47,749
I was so embarrassed to
show my breasts in public.

214
00:10:47,784 --> 00:10:50,385
Well, clearly, you've gotten over that.

215
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,020
Sweetie?

216
00:10:52,055 --> 00:10:52,995
Would you give me a hand?

217
00:10:53,523 --> 00:10:55,491
Oh, sure. Are you finished?

218
00:10:55,525 --> 00:10:58,227
Oh, thanks, mom.

219
00:10:58,261 --> 00:11:01,697
Why are you being so rude?

220
00:11:01,731 --> 00:11:03,699
Because I love that boy

221
00:11:03,733 --> 00:11:05,668
more than anything in the world,

222
00:11:05,702 --> 00:11:08,771
and there is no way in hell
he could get a woman that hot,

223
00:11:08,805 --> 00:11:10,239
so what does she want?

224
00:11:10,273 --> 00:11:12,308
Fine. He's dating out of his league.

225
00:11:12,342 --> 00:11:14,243
Remind me to high-five him later.

226
00:11:14,277 --> 00:11:17,046
Now get back over there and be nice.

227
00:11:18,481 --> 00:11:20,983
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

228
00:11:21,017 --> 00:11:23,986
You have given me so much beautiful food.

229
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,889
You're welcome.

230
00:11:26,923 --> 00:11:30,426
And you have beautiful boots.

231
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,528
Preston buy these for me in Paris.

232
00:11:32,562 --> 00:11:34,830
300 euros...

233
00:11:34,864 --> 00:11:37,833
almost $400 American, yes?

234
00:11:37,867 --> 00:11:42,204
I remember sending you money
in Paris for an emergency.

235
00:11:42,239 --> 00:11:45,040
I didn't realize it involved footwear.

236
00:11:45,075 --> 00:11:48,244
Fine. I'll pay you back
out of my college fund.

237
00:11:48,278 --> 00:11:51,180
Your son is so generous.

238
00:11:51,214 --> 00:11:53,282
You know, he promised to take me

239
00:11:53,316 --> 00:11:57,386
to the shopping spree
in real American mall?

240
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:01,023
I hear people pay $80 for t-shirt.

241
00:12:01,057 --> 00:12:03,859
Well, here in America,

242
00:12:03,893 --> 00:12:08,397
people are willing to pay
a lot for beautiful things.

243
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:13,335
I'm sorry. The water was running.

244
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:15,638
Did you just say
Katherine is a leprechaun?

245
00:12:15,672 --> 00:12:18,607
Lesbian. Katherine is a lesbian.

246
00:12:18,642 --> 00:12:21,076
Okay. The first one made more sense.

247
00:12:21,111 --> 00:12:23,045
Apparently, the other night,

248
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:26,915
- Katherine and Robin got a little drunk...
- Hold it. Robin?

249
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:30,519
Yeah. She's a leprechaun, too.

250
00:12:31,955 --> 00:12:33,989
Katherine and Robin.

251
00:12:34,024 --> 00:12:35,391
Okay. Okay.

252
00:12:35,425 --> 00:12:38,527
You... you could just get
the image out of your head,

253
00:12:38,561 --> 00:12:41,897
- or I'm not gonna tell you anything else.
- This is too weird.

254
00:12:41,931 --> 00:12:43,666
Well...

255
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,535
A lot of people discover
they're gay later in life.

256
00:12:46,569 --> 00:12:49,438
No, I mean, how could
she go from being with me

257
00:12:49,472 --> 00:12:50,889
- to being with women?
- Oh, Mike,

258
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:52,875
she was probably leaning that way already.

259
00:12:52,909 --> 00:12:56,512
She was lucky to have you.
You were a nice transition.

260
00:12:57,914 --> 00:12:59,214
What?

261
00:12:59,249 --> 00:13:00,616
Well, you know, uh,

262
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:03,519
I... I mean, when you make love,

263
00:13:03,553 --> 00:13:06,322
you're so gentle and
you like to cuddle and...

264
00:13:06,356 --> 00:13:09,958
So what are you saying, that
I make love like a woman?

265
00:13:09,993 --> 00:13:12,728
No, no. I'm saying...

266
00:13:12,762 --> 00:13:15,397
That you are a well-balanced man

267
00:13:15,432 --> 00:13:17,800
who's in touch with his feminine side.

268
00:13:17,834 --> 00:13:20,202
I don't even have a feminine side.

269
00:13:20,236 --> 00:13:22,004
Mike, come on.

270
00:13:22,038 --> 00:13:24,406
I... it's what I love about you.

271
00:13:24,441 --> 00:13:26,108
You cry at movies.

272
00:13:26,142 --> 00:13:29,044
Movie. One movie... "Brian's song."

273
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:30,779
And "The Notebook."

274
00:13:30,814 --> 00:13:32,981
Tears of boredom.

275
00:13:33,016 --> 00:13:34,516
Mike.

276
00:13:34,551 --> 00:13:38,587
I don't want to talk about this anymore.

277
00:13:38,621 --> 00:13:40,489
Why is daddy yelling?

278
00:13:40,523 --> 00:13:45,627
He may have turned a
woman into a leprechaun.

279
00:13:47,897 --> 00:13:51,032
Look, you can complain
about Irina all you like.

280
00:13:51,067 --> 00:13:52,567
I... I think she's nice.

281
00:13:52,601 --> 00:13:56,040
Please. Your opinion of her was set
once you heard the word "topless."

282
00:13:56,041 --> 00:14:00,275
That reminds me. Did Preston
take any pictures on this trip?

283
00:14:00,309 --> 00:14:04,979
Tom, I was there when
she unpacked her suitcase.

284
00:14:05,014 --> 00:14:07,715
Preston buy me this. Preston buy me that.

285
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,752
I am telling you, that woman is...

286
00:14:10,786 --> 00:14:13,388
How do you say? A gold digger.

287
00:14:14,857 --> 00:14:17,859
You know, if you're right,
she'll move on soon enough.

288
00:14:17,893 --> 00:14:19,928
Yeah.

289
00:14:19,962 --> 00:14:20,962
Yeah?

290
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:24,199
I need to talk to you guys.

291
00:14:24,233 --> 00:14:28,036
I know that look. He's come to his senses.

292
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:31,906
I proposed to Irina, and she said yes.

293
00:14:31,941 --> 00:14:34,309
Okay, I don't know that look at all.

294
00:14:34,343 --> 00:14:36,644
You proposed?

295
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:39,280
But you've only known each
other for a few months.

296
00:14:39,315 --> 00:14:42,717
Yeah. But she's the one. I know it.

297
00:14:42,751 --> 00:14:45,854
Oh, honey.

298
00:14:45,888 --> 00:14:47,455
Wake up.

299
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:50,725
What's that mean?
- Your... your mother's just concerned

300
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:54,429
that Irina might be with
you for the wrong reasons.

301
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:57,599
Like your college fund.
Why'd you tell her about that?

302
00:14:59,268 --> 00:15:01,536
You must really think I'm an idiot.

303
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:02,937
I think you're young.

304
00:15:02,972 --> 00:15:06,975
And I'm sorry. Sometimes
young is idiot-adjacent.

305
00:15:08,744 --> 00:15:11,112
You don't approve?

306
00:15:11,147 --> 00:15:14,282
Fine. I can live with that.

307
00:15:14,316 --> 00:15:16,217
But I want Nana's ring.

308
00:15:16,252 --> 00:15:19,854
No! You want to buy that
woman boots, I can't stop you,

309
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:22,423
but she is not getting
my grandmother's ring.

310
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,543
Ana promised I could have
that ring when I got married.

311
00:15:24,544 --> 00:15:28,963
You don't get a say.

312
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,667
You're making a mistake.

313
00:15:32,701 --> 00:15:36,070
Yeah, well, maybe the mistake
I made was coming home.

314
00:15:39,575 --> 00:15:41,876
God, your friend owns this place?

315
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,578
It's pretty swank.

316
00:15:43,645 --> 00:15:46,514
Yeah, we used to call it "the
house that bulimia built."

317
00:15:46,548 --> 00:15:48,583
Ugh. I could have never been a model.

318
00:15:48,617 --> 00:15:50,418
I like food too much.

319
00:15:50,452 --> 00:15:52,119
Yeah, that's why.

320
00:15:55,223 --> 00:15:58,492
Can somebody get me a coffee later?

321
00:15:58,527 --> 00:16:01,762
Holy crap. Is that Heidi Klum?

322
00:16:01,797 --> 00:16:03,631
Hey.

323
00:16:03,632 --> 00:16:05,900
Yeah. Hmm.

324
00:16:05,934 --> 00:16:08,301
- Do you wanna meet her?
- Get out. Hey.

325
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:13,240
Sure. She's an old friend. Come on. Heidi.

326
00:16:13,275 --> 00:16:14,976
Hey. Heidi!

327
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:17,345
Hi. It's me, Gaby.

328
00:16:19,281 --> 00:16:21,082
Gabrielle Marquez.

329
00:16:21,116 --> 00:16:22,084
I remember you.

330
00:16:22,085 --> 00:16:24,293
It's hard to forget someone
who taped toilet paper

331
00:16:24,294 --> 00:16:25,726
to the bottom of my Manolo Blahniks

332
00:16:25,727 --> 00:16:29,123
and laughed when I walked down the runway.

333
00:16:29,157 --> 00:16:30,691
I was...

334
00:16:30,726 --> 00:16:34,562
I was quite the practical joker back then.

335
00:16:34,596 --> 00:16:37,932
Anyway, uh, this is my friend,
Angie Bolen, from Fairview.

336
00:16:37,966 --> 00:16:40,141
Practical joke, my ass. Because of you,

337
00:16:40,142 --> 00:16:42,138
I didn't get to be on the
cover of "Sports Illustrated."

338
00:16:42,139 --> 00:16:46,707
So screw you, screw your
friend and screw Fairview.

339
00:16:49,911 --> 00:16:52,513
She seems nice.

340
00:16:52,547 --> 00:16:54,782
Gabrielle!

341
00:16:54,816 --> 00:16:57,318
Luke! Ohh!

342
00:16:57,352 --> 00:16:59,987
Hello, gorgeous!

343
00:17:00,022 --> 00:17:02,223
Hi. This is my neighbor Angie.

344
00:17:02,257 --> 00:17:04,759
Oh. Well, nice cheekbones.

345
00:17:04,793 --> 00:17:08,596
Now what the hell is up with
that snotty niece of yours?

346
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:09,530
I mean, don't get me wrong...

347
00:17:09,531 --> 00:17:12,933
she's gifted and she's got
the look... but that attitude!

348
00:17:12,968 --> 00:17:13,872
Tell me about it.

349
00:17:13,873 --> 00:17:16,554
Do you have any idea where she
is? She's not in her apartment.

350
00:17:16,555 --> 00:17:18,973
Your niece walked off a shoot.

351
00:17:19,007 --> 00:17:21,509
Her boyfriend, Broody
McFine ass showed up,

352
00:17:21,543 --> 00:17:24,712
told her that he had relatives
in town they could stay with.

353
00:17:24,746 --> 00:17:26,180
Short story shorter...

354
00:17:26,214 --> 00:17:29,483
I don't know where she
went and don't care.

355
00:17:29,518 --> 00:17:33,254
You have relatives in New York?

356
00:17:33,288 --> 00:17:35,623
Only one.

357
00:17:38,794 --> 00:17:40,327
Who's there?

358
00:17:40,362 --> 00:17:42,663
It's me, ma.

359
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:08,389
What?

360
00:18:08,423 --> 00:18:11,425
I finally get to meet my
grandson for the first time,

361
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,195
and now you're telling
me that he has to go?

362
00:18:14,229 --> 00:18:17,064
- You know it is not safe here, ma.
- Here's what I know...

363
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:20,367
every night, for the past 18 years,

364
00:18:20,402 --> 00:18:22,636
I was the only one at this table.

365
00:18:22,671 --> 00:18:26,941
Yeah. One plate, one cup, one chair.

366
00:18:26,975 --> 00:18:29,310
And then someone knocks on my door,

367
00:18:29,344 --> 00:18:31,479
and they sit right there.

368
00:18:31,513 --> 00:18:34,648
And he calls me "grandma."

369
00:18:34,683 --> 00:18:37,384
I could have looked at
him till my eyes dried up.

370
00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:40,154
And now you show up, and
you tell me it's not safe.

371
00:18:40,188 --> 00:18:42,757
Why? The feds don't care about him.

372
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:45,426
It's not the feds I'm worried about.

373
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:49,029
Oh, so that's why you
want to take him away.

374
00:18:49,064 --> 00:18:50,331
Patrick Logan?

375
00:18:50,365 --> 00:18:53,167
If my kid shows up, he
is a direct link to me.

376
00:18:53,201 --> 00:18:56,036
- That's how he'll find me.
- That was 18 years ago.

377
00:18:56,071 --> 00:18:58,472
Patrick Logan does not care about you,

378
00:18:58,507 --> 00:19:02,810
and he sure as hell does
not care about my grandson!

379
00:19:02,844 --> 00:19:05,346
Ma, please.

380
00:19:06,982 --> 00:19:09,784
I'll tell Danny you were here.

381
00:19:20,262 --> 00:19:22,330
Robin the stripper?

382
00:19:22,364 --> 00:19:24,766
You had sex with Robin the stripper?

383
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,769
Holy Chaz Bono. Was that
the first time you ever...

384
00:19:27,803 --> 00:19:29,037
Yes.

385
00:19:29,071 --> 00:19:31,005
And Robin's at her cousin's wedding,

386
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,941
so I only have a couple
of days to figure this out.

387
00:19:33,942 --> 00:19:35,743
Am I gay now?

388
00:19:37,479 --> 00:19:39,013
So I only have a couple of
days well, did you enjoy it?

389
00:19:39,048 --> 00:19:41,683
I don't know. It was different.

390
00:19:41,717 --> 00:19:44,452
I mean, we started kissing, and then we...

391
00:19:44,486 --> 00:19:46,988
n... no d... details necessary.

392
00:19:48,524 --> 00:19:50,325
Katherine, you're not gay.

393
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:53,328
As much as you think you
can switch your entrée

394
00:19:53,362 --> 00:19:55,797
from meat to fish, it
doesn't work that way.

395
00:19:55,831 --> 00:19:57,522
This is not a choice.

396
00:19:57,523 --> 00:20:00,463
But how could this have
happened if I'm not gay?

397
00:20:00,852 --> 00:20:04,606
Look, I was with women
all through my 20s...

398
00:20:04,607 --> 00:20:06,224
Any excuse to drag that out.

399
00:20:07,051 --> 00:20:08,995
But it always felt weird.

400
00:20:08,996 --> 00:20:12,088
Then when I slept with a
man, I knew that was it.

401
00:20:12,089 --> 00:20:13,855
Then a thousand men later, he found me.

402
00:20:13,856 --> 00:20:17,632
My point is, if it didn't
feel quite right to you,

403
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,840
chances are it's just a onetime thing.

404
00:20:19,841 --> 00:20:21,638
Oh, maybe you're right.

405
00:20:21,639 --> 00:20:23,476
We were both pretty drunk.

406
00:20:23,893 --> 00:20:27,684
If you're not sure, take sex
out of it. Get to know Robin.

407
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:30,159
I... it's a little late to start dating.

408
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,758
We already live together.

409
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:33,119
That is fast.

410
00:20:33,827 --> 00:20:35,287
Maybe you are a lesbian.

411
00:20:38,176 --> 00:20:40,981
And in the short time he's been here,

412
00:20:40,982 --> 00:20:42,411
Sam has proved himself invaluable.

413
00:20:42,412 --> 00:20:44,484
So I would like you
all to give your support

414
00:20:44,485 --> 00:20:46,568
to our new vice president.

415
00:20:46,569 --> 00:20:49,873
Thank you. This is a great company,

416
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:52,187
but I think we can make it even better.

417
00:20:52,188 --> 00:20:54,092
Now I've got a lot of great...

418
00:20:57,281 --> 00:21:00,481
Oh, oh, sorry. I was just,
uh, showing my support.

419
00:21:01,109 --> 00:21:02,354
Carry on.

420
00:21:02,355 --> 00:21:04,676
Andrew, is that beer?

421
00:21:04,677 --> 00:21:06,872
Hey, just because you
can't have a liquid lunch,

422
00:21:06,873 --> 00:21:09,136
- doesn't mean the rest of us have to suffer.
- Andrew.

423
00:21:09,606 --> 00:21:11,979
It's okay. It's okay. I've got this.

424
00:21:14,639 --> 00:21:17,142
Okay, buddy, why don't
we get you some coffee?

425
00:21:17,143 --> 00:21:19,163
Why don't we not? Oh, besides,

426
00:21:19,164 --> 00:21:22,327
I... I believe everybody
is waiting to hear

427
00:21:22,328 --> 00:21:24,759
how you're gonna sprinkle
your magic fairy dust

428
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,282
and whip this company
into shape. Am I right?

429
00:21:27,283 --> 00:21:29,575
- Okay, you need to go now.
- Get your hands off me!

430
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:32,982
Andrew!

431
00:21:35,908 --> 00:21:37,469
Sam, are you okay?

432
00:21:40,017 --> 00:21:41,259
I'm fine.

433
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,502
But if you don't mind,

434
00:21:43,503 --> 00:21:45,529
I think I'll take the rest of the day off.

435
00:21:51,335 --> 00:21:54,229
See? Told you he was a slacker.

436
00:21:57,763 --> 00:21:58,875
Lynette, what can I do for you?

437
00:21:58,928 --> 00:22:02,141
Hey, Jimmy. My son came home from Europe

438
00:22:02,142 --> 00:22:04,069
and is engaged to a
beautiful Russian girl.

439
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,534
Congratulations.

440
00:22:05,535 --> 00:22:07,250
- I hate her.
- Okay.

441
00:22:07,251 --> 00:22:10,080
Anyway, this is my grandmother's ring,

442
00:22:10,081 --> 00:22:14,595
- and Preston wants to give it to her.
- She's very lucky.

443
00:22:14,596 --> 00:22:17,314
- Oh, she's not getting this...
- Okay.

444
00:22:17,315 --> 00:22:19,583
Because you are gonna
find me a cheap copy.

445
00:22:19,584 --> 00:22:20,935
Oh, I can try,

446
00:22:20,936 --> 00:22:23,392
but she's probably gonna
know the difference.

447
00:22:23,393 --> 00:22:24,648
Oh, I'm counting on it.

448
00:22:24,649 --> 00:22:28,701
Irina is quite the opportunist.
Five seconds after she gets it,

449
00:22:28,702 --> 00:22:30,628
she'll have that piece of glass appraised,

450
00:22:30,629 --> 00:22:34,057
and when she finds out my
son has given her a... fake,

451
00:22:34,058 --> 00:22:36,550
I'm betting that little
Russian parasite will be looking

452
00:22:36,551 --> 00:22:39,425
- for a new host body.
- But when your son finds out,

453
00:22:39,426 --> 00:22:40,915
isn't he gonna be mad?

454
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:43,382
Oh, that's why I keep having kids, Jimmy,

455
00:22:43,383 --> 00:22:45,169
to replace the ones who hate me.

456
00:22:47,067 --> 00:22:48,788
MJ's asleep.

457
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:51,186
Are you coming to bed?

458
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,075
I miss you.

459
00:22:55,788 --> 00:22:58,287
What, you, uh, need
somebody to do your hair?

460
00:22:58,288 --> 00:23:00,954
You know, us sensitive
men are good at that.

461
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:04,230
Please don't pout.

462
00:23:04,231 --> 00:23:06,820
You are all man.

463
00:23:06,821 --> 00:23:10,073
You're one of the strongest,
most macho man I know.

464
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,943
Now come upstairs.

465
00:23:14,064 --> 00:23:17,482
I don't have to come
upstairs to show you that.

466
00:23:18,326 --> 00:23:20,205
- What are you doing?
- I can show

467
00:23:20,206 --> 00:23:21,864
you how macho I am right here.

468
00:23:22,445 --> 00:23:25,408
Don't you think our bed
is a bit more comfortable?

469
00:23:25,656 --> 00:23:28,747
- Beds are for wimps.
- Okay, that was MJ's lunch.

470
00:23:28,748 --> 00:23:30,921
Now I'm getting rid of this T-shirt.

471
00:23:34,926 --> 00:23:37,043
- God, what is this made of?
- Oh, here. Let me take it off.

472
00:23:37,044 --> 00:23:39,565
- No. I'm ripping it.
- Oh, Mike,

473
00:23:39,566 --> 00:23:41,025
you... you don't have anything to prove.

474
00:23:41,026 --> 00:23:42,139
Where are the scissors?

475
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:44,827
- I just want to make little starter cut.
- Are you okay?

476
00:23:44,828 --> 00:23:47,579
Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm fine. I like it rough.

477
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,496
Aah! Oh! I'm glad that you're

478
00:23:49,497 --> 00:23:51,809
having fun, but my back is hurting,

479
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:54,630
- so let me get on top.
- No. No. I'm on top.

480
00:23:54,631 --> 00:23:56,970
Seriously, Mike. I'm on a salt shaker.

481
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:01,124
Oh, sweetie. Are you okay?

482
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:04,371
No, not really.

483
00:24:04,372 --> 00:24:06,962
Honestly, if I had known

484
00:24:06,963 --> 00:24:09,645
that you were gonna get
this upset about Katherine...

485
00:24:09,646 --> 00:24:11,903
It's not about Katherine. It's you.

486
00:24:11,904 --> 00:24:14,826
And it's not even really
about you. It's me.

487
00:24:14,827 --> 00:24:17,719
Okay, just how hard did you hit your head?

488
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,970
The loan.

489
00:24:18,971 --> 00:24:22,185
Susan, you paid off my loan.

490
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:25,894
Well, isn't that a little, uh,

491
00:24:25,895 --> 00:24:29,267
1956 of you?

492
00:24:30,491 --> 00:24:32,066
I grew up...

493
00:24:32,067 --> 00:24:35,127
watching a man who didn't
provide for his family,

494
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:39,638
and I always swore that was
one thing I was gonna do.

495
00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:43,171
I'll never be rich,

496
00:24:43,172 --> 00:24:44,236
I'll never be famous,

497
00:24:44,237 --> 00:24:49,072
but I can be a guy who
takes care of his family.

498
00:24:50,259 --> 00:24:53,314
Well, in that case,

499
00:24:53,315 --> 00:24:57,202
I will cancel the check tomorrow,

500
00:24:57,203 --> 00:25:01,405
and you can pay the loan off by yourself.

501
00:25:01,406 --> 00:25:03,068
Thank you.

502
00:25:04,757 --> 00:25:08,120
Hey, you know that 1956 thing?

503
00:25:08,121 --> 00:25:08,831
Hmm?

504
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:11,840
It's kinda sexy.

505
00:25:11,841 --> 00:25:13,804
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

506
00:25:19,497 --> 00:25:21,962
Ana, this is my 17th message.

507
00:25:21,963 --> 00:25:23,008
You might as well pick up the phone,

508
00:25:23,009 --> 00:25:24,619
because I am not leaving
New York until I see you.

509
00:25:25,663 --> 00:25:28,580
Tell me. What exactly
are you planning to do?

510
00:25:28,581 --> 00:25:30,721
Find Ana, cut the purse strings,

511
00:25:30,722 --> 00:25:32,891
destroy her hopes and dreams
and catch a Broadway show.

512
00:25:35,193 --> 00:25:36,746
Oh, my gosh!

513
00:25:36,747 --> 00:25:38,626
Hi, guys!

514
00:25:38,627 --> 00:25:43,082
Hi! Oh, um, Angie, you met Luke,

515
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,381
and of course you recognize

516
00:25:44,382 --> 00:25:46,422
the beautiful Paulina Porizkova.

517
00:25:46,423 --> 00:25:47,623
She and I go way back.

518
00:25:47,624 --> 00:25:51,271
- How have you been? Give me a hug.
- Why?

519
00:25:52,112 --> 00:25:54,179
- What's wrong?
- You treated me like

520
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,997
dirt, and now you want to hug?

521
00:25:56,739 --> 00:25:58,736
What are you talking about?

522
00:25:58,737 --> 00:26:00,549
You remember all the fun we had

523
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:02,647
doing that photo shoot
on the beach in Brazil.

524
00:26:02,648 --> 00:26:04,919
What I remember is getting you that job

525
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,163
when you were just starting out

526
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:07,917
and then freezing on
the sand for three hours

527
00:26:07,918 --> 00:26:09,446
while you bitched
because they couldn't find

528
00:26:09,447 --> 00:26:11,133
the exact right shade of lipstick

529
00:26:11,134 --> 00:26:12,360
that would make you look pretty.

530
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,839
I see you still haven't found it.

531
00:26:20,082 --> 00:26:21,005
You know...

532
00:26:21,006 --> 00:26:22,499
I really don't think I need to

533
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,991
meet any more of your friends.

534
00:26:23,992 --> 00:26:25,134
I'm gonna go call Nick.

535
00:26:26,422 --> 00:26:28,648
Can you believe Paulina?

536
00:26:28,649 --> 00:26:29,713
What was that about?

537
00:26:29,714 --> 00:26:31,697
Oh, you're kidding, right?

538
00:26:32,987 --> 00:26:36,030
Okay, maybe I threw a little
attitude once in a while.

539
00:26:36,031 --> 00:26:38,284
You didn't throw it, honey. You heaved it.

540
00:26:38,285 --> 00:26:42,373
Oh, come on. I was no worse
than a lot of other girls.

541
00:26:42,374 --> 00:26:45,957
No, sweetie, you were
the queen bitch diva...

542
00:26:45,958 --> 00:26:48,246
insulting photographers,
upsetting booking agents.

543
00:26:48,247 --> 00:26:50,465
That's why your career
went down in flames.

544
00:26:50,466 --> 00:26:53,958
No. My career ended because
I decided to marry Carlos.

545
00:26:53,959 --> 00:26:56,370
You remember. I called
you the night he proposed.

546
00:26:56,371 --> 00:26:59,210
Yeah, and I told you
to grab that brass ring.

547
00:27:00,322 --> 00:27:02,434
Because I knew it was over for you,

548
00:27:03,328 --> 00:27:05,361
and you did, too,

549
00:27:05,362 --> 00:27:07,538
or else you never would have left.

550
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,707
Excuse me? I think I'm in the wrong place.

551
00:27:24,708 --> 00:27:26,413
Does Sam Allen live here?

552
00:27:26,414 --> 00:27:28,653
That one. But he's not here.

553
00:27:28,654 --> 00:27:32,106
Oh. Then I guess I'll just,
uh, leave these on his porch.

554
00:27:32,107 --> 00:27:33,661
If you want the dogs to eat it.

555
00:27:33,662 --> 00:27:35,815
Put it inside. It's unlocked.

556
00:28:16,255 --> 00:28:17,754
Mrs. Hodge?

557
00:28:20,462 --> 00:28:22,736
What are you doing with a picture of Rex?

558
00:28:25,974 --> 00:28:27,547
I'm waiting.

559
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:30,180
He was my father.

560
00:28:31,504 --> 00:28:33,055
What?

561
00:28:33,056 --> 00:28:36,928
This is not how I wanted you
to find out. I am so sorry.

562
00:28:43,234 --> 00:28:45,673
Bree, let me explain.

563
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:53,153
Irina really loved the ring,
mom. That's why she wanted

564
00:28:53,154 --> 00:28:55,657
- to go right to a jeweler, to get it sized.
- Good.

565
00:28:55,658 --> 00:28:57,679
Listen, I know I sprang this on you,

566
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,359
but once you get to know her,
you'll see what I see in her.

567
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,717
I am looking forward to when
we both see the same thing.

568
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,801
Hello, everyone.

569
00:29:07,802 --> 00:29:09,639
- Hey, Irina.
- Hey.

570
00:29:11,862 --> 00:29:13,961
You hungry? Mom made lentil soup.

571
00:29:13,962 --> 00:29:15,551
- I told her it was your favorite.
- Oh,

572
00:29:15,552 --> 00:29:16,920
your mother's full of thoughts.

573
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,476
Oh, in English, we say "thoughtful."

574
00:29:19,477 --> 00:29:21,407
- Yes.
- Oh, you're not wearing your ring.

575
00:29:21,484 --> 00:29:25,314
Gee, I hope there's not a problem.

576
00:29:25,315 --> 00:29:29,050
I am all day thinking about this ring.

577
00:29:29,051 --> 00:29:31,808
I do not want it.

578
00:29:33,532 --> 00:29:37,097
- But... Preston said you loved it.
- I do,

579
00:29:37,098 --> 00:29:40,073
but it is too precious.

580
00:29:40,074 --> 00:29:43,173
This ring has been in your
family for generations,

581
00:29:43,174 --> 00:29:45,383
and for you to give it
to woman you don't know,

582
00:29:45,384 --> 00:29:46,839
it feels wrong.

583
00:29:48,962 --> 00:29:50,799
Save it for penny.

584
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,903
Wow. What a classy thing to do.

585
00:29:53,904 --> 00:29:55,730
Thank you, Irina.

586
00:29:55,731 --> 00:29:57,777
You can buy me another ring.

587
00:29:57,778 --> 00:30:00,155
You sure? Nana's ring is worth a lot more

588
00:30:00,156 --> 00:30:01,579
than anything I can afford.

589
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:06,007
Yes, Preston. I know
exactly how much it is worth.

590
00:30:06,008 --> 00:30:09,003
But I want your mother to know

591
00:30:09,004 --> 00:30:11,946
I am full of thoughts, too.

592
00:30:14,066 --> 00:30:16,817
So... let's eat.

593
00:30:17,912 --> 00:30:20,546
Preston, get her a
chair. Here you go, honey.

594
00:30:20,547 --> 00:30:21,075
Yeah, don't even worry about it.

595
00:30:21,076 --> 00:30:22,376
Yeah, we're having

596
00:30:39,178 --> 00:30:40,735
I need to tell you something...

597
00:30:43,157 --> 00:30:45,081
About Patrick.

598
00:30:47,323 --> 00:30:48,699
This again?

599
00:30:49,655 --> 00:30:51,297
Fine.

600
00:30:52,131 --> 00:30:55,795
What about the great and
powerful Patrick Logan?

601
00:30:55,796 --> 00:30:58,258
First you have to promise
you won't ever tell Danny.

602
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,191
Ana!

603
00:31:02,192 --> 00:31:04,258
There you are!

604
00:31:04,259 --> 00:31:06,050
I have nothing to say to you.

605
00:31:06,051 --> 00:31:07,685
Wait, wait, wait. Just
give me five minutes.

606
00:31:07,686 --> 00:31:08,906
If you don't like what I have to say,

607
00:31:08,907 --> 00:31:11,193
- then you can tell me to go to hell.
- Two minutes.

608
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:13,767
I'll meet you inside.

609
00:31:16,421 --> 00:31:17,940
Before you start,

610
00:31:17,941 --> 00:31:19,156
I know you sent me to New York

611
00:31:19,157 --> 00:31:20,412
just to get me away from Danny.

612
00:31:20,413 --> 00:31:23,399
True. I begged Luke to take
you, and he did me a favor.

613
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,322
- I knew it.
- But it turns out I was doing him a favor, too,

614
00:31:26,323 --> 00:31:29,671
- because he thinks you're really talented.
- He said that?

615
00:31:29,672 --> 00:31:33,163
He also thinks you're a
petulant, whiny, spoiled brat,

616
00:31:33,164 --> 00:31:35,095
just like I was, and that's
gonna kill your career,

617
00:31:35,096 --> 00:31:38,731
- just like it killed mine.
- I thought you were successful.

618
00:31:38,732 --> 00:31:42,956
I was, until everyone was tired
of putting up with my crap.

619
00:31:42,957 --> 00:31:46,038
So I want you to go
back to Luke, apologize

620
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:47,446
and start acting like a professional.

621
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,893
Modeling can be a great ride,

622
00:31:49,894 --> 00:31:52,792
and I don't want you to be
kicked off before it's over,

623
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,657
like I was.

624
00:32:01,368 --> 00:32:04,747
Mom, I know you're here
for me, but I'm not goin'.

625
00:32:04,748 --> 00:32:06,537
All right, grandma wants me to stay.

626
00:32:09,421 --> 00:32:11,146
No.

627
00:32:11,147 --> 00:32:12,971
I don't.

628
00:32:16,491 --> 00:32:17,758
What did you say to her?

629
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:19,742
She didn't have to say anything.

630
00:32:19,743 --> 00:32:21,674
Your mother knows what's best.

631
00:32:27,273 --> 00:32:28,655
But...

632
00:32:28,656 --> 00:32:31,060
We have a relationship now, hmm?

633
00:32:31,061 --> 00:32:34,474
We're gonna talk to
each other all the time.

634
00:32:34,475 --> 00:32:37,112
Really?

635
00:32:37,113 --> 00:32:39,116
I promise.

636
00:32:39,117 --> 00:32:43,502
But as long as you're here,
neither one of us is safe.

637
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:48,577
Now go pack your stuff.

638
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:07,650
Hi.

639
00:33:08,105 --> 00:33:09,666
Do you, by any chance, know who

640
00:33:09,667 --> 00:33:11,176
that woman is t perfect.

641
00:33:11,177 --> 00:33:13,370
Yeah, that's her daughter Angie.

642
00:33:13,371 --> 00:33:16,522
Really? I haven't seen her around here.

643
00:33:16,523 --> 00:33:17,987
Where... where is she visiting from?

644
00:33:17,988 --> 00:33:19,201
Fairview.

645
00:33:21,838 --> 00:33:24,420
He's still out there.

646
00:33:24,421 --> 00:33:26,391
You really should talk to him.

647
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,633
I have nothing to say.

648
00:33:29,634 --> 00:33:31,505
Bree, he's 26.

649
00:33:31,506 --> 00:33:33,889
He was born before you
and Rex were married.

650
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:37,887
Fidelity is not the issue.
Rex had a secret life.

651
00:33:37,888 --> 00:33:41,090
Fine. Be mad at Rex,
not at that young man.

652
00:33:41,091 --> 00:33:42,815
- He's innocent.
- He showed up to work for me

653
00:33:42,816 --> 00:33:44,996
and didn't tell me that he
was my dead husband's son.

654
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:48,777
What does he want?

655
00:33:48,778 --> 00:33:51,020
Well, there's only one way to find out.

656
00:33:57,363 --> 00:33:59,316
You told me you wanted to explain.

657
00:33:59,317 --> 00:34:01,199
You have two minutes.

658
00:34:02,743 --> 00:34:05,984
My mother and father met at a bar.

659
00:34:05,985 --> 00:34:08,112
He was single, so was she.

660
00:34:08,113 --> 00:34:11,000
They had one night together,
and then he went away.

661
00:34:11,001 --> 00:34:14,415
When she found out she was
pregnant, she called him.

662
00:34:14,416 --> 00:34:18,435
He had just met you
and said he was in love.

663
00:34:18,436 --> 00:34:21,549
He offered to support her financially,

664
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:24,072
but my mom, who was very proud,

665
00:34:24,073 --> 00:34:26,136
turned him down.

666
00:34:28,488 --> 00:34:30,304
But he did visit you.

667
00:34:30,305 --> 00:34:32,135
A few times,

668
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:35,471
but my mom asked him to stop
because it was too hard on me.

669
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:39,068
And did you ever see him again?

670
00:34:39,069 --> 00:34:40,008
Yes.

671
00:34:40,009 --> 00:34:42,629
From right here.

672
00:34:44,256 --> 00:34:46,080
I used to ride my bike over.

673
00:34:49,528 --> 00:34:52,759
I'd watch you and Andrew and Danielle.

674
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:57,024
I wanted to understand

675
00:34:57,025 --> 00:34:59,891
why my father would choose
all of you over me...

676
00:35:02,231 --> 00:35:04,156
and I did.

677
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:08,794
You were all so perfect.

678
00:35:08,795 --> 00:35:10,423
Oh.

679
00:35:15,208 --> 00:35:18,683
My mom died six months ago,

680
00:35:19,605 --> 00:35:22,382
and that's when I decided
I needed to meet you.

681
00:35:22,383 --> 00:35:25,650
Why didn't you tell me who you were?

682
00:35:25,651 --> 00:35:28,215
Because I wanted you to like me...

683
00:35:30,035 --> 00:35:33,237
and I wasn't sure you would.

684
00:35:37,789 --> 00:35:39,280
You look cold.

685
00:35:40,666 --> 00:35:42,840
Why don't you come into the house,

686
00:35:42,841 --> 00:35:45,527
and I'll make you some hot
chocolate, and we can talk?

687
00:35:58,895 --> 00:36:00,535
Oh!

688
00:36:01,636 --> 00:36:02,925
Hey!

689
00:36:03,631 --> 00:36:06,373
You know, not to put any pressure on you,

690
00:36:06,374 --> 00:36:08,008
but I caught the bouquet.

691
00:36:14,157 --> 00:36:16,703
Do we need to talk?

692
00:36:16,704 --> 00:36:20,321
I mean, we haven't since... it happened.

693
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:22,994
First of all,

694
00:36:22,995 --> 00:36:25,974
you are a wonderful, beautiful person.

695
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,833
Oh.

696
00:36:28,865 --> 00:36:29,907
Yowza.

697
00:36:29,908 --> 00:36:31,566
I was drunk.

698
00:36:31,567 --> 00:36:34,992
I... I didn't even know what I
was doing until I was doing it,

699
00:36:34,993 --> 00:36:36,926
and then, well...

700
00:36:36,927 --> 00:36:40,200
the other night was a mistake,

701
00:36:40,201 --> 00:36:43,601
and I'm so sorry.

702
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:50,320
That is...

703
00:36:50,321 --> 00:36:52,944
complete crap.

704
00:36:52,945 --> 00:36:54,741
What?

705
00:36:55,793 --> 00:36:58,914
I'm not gonna let you blame
what happened on being drunk.

706
00:36:58,915 --> 00:37:00,723
Okay, then.

707
00:37:02,567 --> 00:37:05,270
You know what I've been through recently.

708
00:37:05,271 --> 00:37:07,834
And maybe I was...

709
00:37:07,835 --> 00:37:10,578
Trying to forget that with you?

710
00:37:10,579 --> 00:37:13,478
But I am not attracted to women.

711
00:37:13,479 --> 00:37:15,822
So no matter what it was,

712
00:37:15,823 --> 00:37:18,783
it doesn't count.

713
00:37:24,029 --> 00:37:27,956
I know how you touched me,

714
00:37:27,957 --> 00:37:28,991
and I...

715
00:37:28,992 --> 00:37:31,907
I saw the look in your
eyes when I touched you.

716
00:37:34,094 --> 00:37:35,960
You may deny it now,

717
00:37:35,961 --> 00:37:37,482
but we connected...

718
00:37:37,483 --> 00:37:39,644
and it counted.

719
00:37:52,802 --> 00:37:55,351
Okay.

720
00:37:56,977 --> 00:37:59,281
It counted.

721
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:02,340
Thank you.

722
00:38:11,092 --> 00:38:14,815
Hey, you want an extra pillow?

723
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:18,390
There's empty seats in the back.

724
00:38:18,391 --> 00:38:21,439
I'm just gonna go sleep there.

725
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,247
You okay?

726
00:38:28,248 --> 00:38:30,796
Yeah. I'm just tired.

727
00:38:34,652 --> 00:38:37,388
Well, you may have picked up on this trip

728
00:38:37,389 --> 00:38:39,311
that I haven't always been a good person.

729
00:38:39,312 --> 00:38:43,468
And I'm gonna work on
that, starting with you.

730
00:38:43,469 --> 00:38:46,304
Did Danny say there
were seats in the back?

731
00:38:46,305 --> 00:38:48,491
No, no, no. Come on. Come
on. I'm serious. I'm serious.

732
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:51,654
Look, I know you have a secret.

733
00:38:51,655 --> 00:38:56,296
Carlos and I overheard
you and Nick fighting...

734
00:38:56,297 --> 00:38:58,987
something about blowing your cover.

735
00:38:58,988 --> 00:39:01,626
Don't worry. I didn't
tell anybody. I just...

736
00:39:01,627 --> 00:39:04,658
I just want you to know that...

737
00:39:05,619 --> 00:39:09,227
I've carried around a lot of secrets,

738
00:39:09,228 --> 00:39:12,129
and I know how lonely it can feel.

739
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:16,011
So if you ever need a friend...

740
00:39:26,341 --> 00:39:28,863
Okay.

741
00:39:31,471 --> 00:39:35,180
When I was 18, I wanted
to save the planet.

742
00:39:35,181 --> 00:39:36,774
I organized protests

743
00:39:36,775 --> 00:39:40,840
against logging companies,
big oil, auto plants.

744
00:39:40,841 --> 00:39:44,466
But then I got involved with a bad guy...

745
00:39:44,467 --> 00:39:47,254
a really bad guy.

746
00:39:47,255 --> 00:39:50,211
He convinced me that we
had to get more aggressive.

747
00:39:52,971 --> 00:39:55,450
Long story short...

748
00:39:57,803 --> 00:39:59,771
Someone got killed.

749
00:40:03,355 --> 00:40:06,369
So... this bad guy...

750
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:08,932
you're not talking about Nick, are you?

751
00:40:08,933 --> 00:40:12,841
No. He's the one who helped
me run away from the psycho.

752
00:40:16,576 --> 00:40:18,072
So who's the psycho?

753
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:22,449
Danny's father.

754
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:31,157
It's not always easy to
see someone's true colors.

755
00:40:32,461 --> 00:40:37,358
Sometimes you must look
beneath the masculine veneer

756
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:39,824
to find that fragile ego.

757
00:40:41,073 --> 00:40:44,650
You must ignore the sparkle of the jewel

758
00:40:45,855 --> 00:40:49,135
to know you're looking at a fake.

759
00:40:50,367 --> 00:40:53,744
You must bring the
truth out of the shadows

760
00:40:53,745 --> 00:40:57,779
to see the beauty of its smile.

761
00:40:59,595 --> 00:41:03,796
Yes, people hide their true
nature from us every day,

762
00:41:03,797 --> 00:41:09,673
and sadly, we only find
out when it's too late.

763
00:41:09,674 --> 00:41:11,140
Uh, Mr. Logan?

764
00:41:11,141 --> 00:41:13,246
It's Iris Beckley.

765
00:41:13,247 --> 00:41:16,447
Oh, I live, uh, next to Rose De Luca.

766
00:41:16,448 --> 00:41:20,287
Y... you told me, uh, to give you
a ring if I ever saw Rose's daughter.

767
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:24,929
No. No, no, no. No, I'll...
I'll tell you where she lives

768
00:41:24,947 --> 00:41:27,091
when I get my $1,000.

769
00:41:27,092 --> 00:41:29,092
