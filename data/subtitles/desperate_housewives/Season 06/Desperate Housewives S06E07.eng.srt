1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,540
Previously on "Desperate Housewives"...

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,270
Old friends fought.

3
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,230
You knew that Julie was in trouble,

4
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:08,730
and you chose not to come to me.

5
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,830
New lovers lie.

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,840
Where did you get it, Bree?

7
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:14,980
She bought it? I'm assuming.

8
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:18,970
Uh, yes, at that little antique
store down on pearl street.

9
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:20,370
Sorry. We sell furniture.

10
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,680
She must have gotten it somewhere else.

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,560
And suspicion was born.

12
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,020
Do you know where Katherine was

13
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,440
the night that Julie was attacked?

14
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:34,620
Julie Mayer was having trouble sleeping.

15
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,210
You see, every time she closed her eyes,

16
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:41,540
she dreamt of her neighbor.

17
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:46,710
They met when she came to tutor his son.

18
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:50,640
Later, a chance encounter at a caf

19
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:54,050
led to hours of conversation.

20
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:57,300
He asked to see her again...

21
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,060
and again...

22
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,320
and again.

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,260
And the next thing Julie knew,

24
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,410
she was having an affair
with a married man.

25
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:16,330
But then, after a close call,

26
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,800
she came to her senses

27
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,950
and told the man it was over.

28
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,880
Unfortunately for Julie,

29
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,610
Some men can't take "no" for an answer.

30
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:35,850
Can I come in?

31
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,910
What, that's it? It's
that simple to you?

32
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,400
You have to leave now.

33
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:49,900
Come on. Let's just talk about this.

34
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,580
There is nothing to talk about! Just go!

35
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:54,130
Yes, there is! Just
come on. Talk to me! huh?

36
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,210
Lynette. Hi. What's up?

37
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:05,740
I'm just dropping off that band
candy your mom bought from Penny.

38
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:06,680
Everything okay?

39
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,910
Yeah, everything's fine.

40
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,770
Um... Mr. Bolen was just leaving. Right?

41
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:15,120
Yeah, I guess I was. Hey, Lynette.

42
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,400
Hey, Nick.

43
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,390
What was that about?

44
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,250
What do you mean?

45
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:27,160
Well, I don't mean to pry. It's just...

46
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,450
When I was walking up,
I heard you two arguing.

47
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:35,070
He's the guy.

48
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:36,790
The guy?

49
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,740
The guy I was... having the affair with.

50
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:44,090
No. No!

51
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:46,810
- Why did you tell me this?!
- You asked.

52
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:47,810
Why not lie?

53
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,060
I'm late for work.

54
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,310
I would've bought anything.

55
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,660
Look, don't freak out. It's over.

56
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,690
Not for me. Now I have to tell your mom!

57
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:55,630
No, you don't.

58
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:58,200
She was pissed when I didn't
tell her you might be pregnant.

59
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,400
If I don't tell her
about this,  I'm dead.

60
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,230
Come on, Lynette.

61
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,650
I am serious!

62
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,090
She already shot Katherine.

63
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,310
Now she's got a taste for blood.

64
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,560
There's no reason to tell her anything.

65
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,950
I broke it off weeks ago.

66
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,140
Then why was he here?

67
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,520
He wants me to take him back.

68
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,000
Threaten to tell his wife.

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,410
He doesn't care. He says he loves me.

70
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:21,120
Oh, honey, you're smart enough
to know that that's a lie.

71
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,150
Right?

72
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,020
I keep trying to get over him,

73
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:33,610
but then he comes over here
and he says all this stuff,

74
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:36,040
and I... I just get so confused.

75
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,620
Listen to me.

76
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,950
I will handle this.

77
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,600
Really?

78
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,930
And you... you won't tell my mom?

79
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,520
No, I won't.

80
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:54,500
Thank you.

81
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,760
That night, for the first time in weeks,

82
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,750
Julie Mayer would sleep well.

83
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,510
Unfortunately,

84
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:05,470
Lynette Scavo would not.

85
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,380
"The Fairview Homeschooling Workbook"

86
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,220
was created to help parents
teach their children.

87
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,460
It's colorful,

88
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,250
very entertaining,

89
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,050
a bit challenging

90
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,510
and guaranteed to make teaching fun.

91
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,600
Pick that up, or I will
knock you into next week!

92
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,610
I hate fractions!

93
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,570
I don't care! You still
have to learn them!

94
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,760
Why? Fractions are boring!

95
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,530
Okay. Fine.

96
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,480
Let me make it more interesting for you.

97
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,350
Say I take Mrs. Doolittle...
you favorite doll...

98
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,780
and I chop her into thirds.
I bury one third in the yard.

99
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,340
I put another third down
the garbage disposal.

100
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,000
How much of Mrs.
Doolittle do you have left?

101
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,750
You're not gonna hurt her, are you?

102
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,670
It depends on how you
answer the question!

103
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,300
Gaby! Can I see you for a sec?

104
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,070
- What is going on?
- I'm teaching math.

105
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,370
By threatening her toys?

106
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,920
Well, maybe teacher's
a little tired, okay?

107
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,620
It's not the only thing
I have to do around here.

108
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,190
I also have to cook and clean.

109
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,590
Okay, I hear you.

110
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,600
It isn't fair that
all this falls on you.

111
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,280
- I'll get you some help.
- Thank you.

112
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,790
We'll get a housekeeper.

113
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,880
What? No, no, no, I'd
rather have a tutor.

114
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,050
You'd rather scrubs toilets
than teach your daughter?

115
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:41,310
Well, at least the
toilets won't talk back.

116
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:44,710
Gaby, she just had to leave
her school and all her friends.

117
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,190
And now her mother's gonna abandon her,

118
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,560
- and leave her with some stranger? I don't think so.
- No, but...

119
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,830
No "but"s. Juanita needs you right now.

120
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,720
You're doing this.

121
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:59,060
Don't worry. Your doll's safe.

122
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,490
If I'm gonna chop anything off,

123
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:03,430
it's gonna be something of your daddy's!

124
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,720
So you're saying you
won't even talk to her?

125
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,190
No, we already interviewed Mrs. Mayfair.

126
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,220
That's when you thought

127
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,400
Danny Bolen had attacked Julie.

128
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,150
You treated her like a witness.

129
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,170
Now you need to treat
her like a suspect.

130
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:18,580
Look, miss, we're not trying
to dismiss your concerns,

131
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,750
but women don't commit
this kind of crime.

132
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,500
They tend to keep at a physical remove

133
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,760
from their victims...

134
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,070
vehicular assaults, poison.

135
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:32,280
Well, maybe Katherine was
thinking outside the box.

136
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,500
- Hey, did you get any mayo?
-Yeah.

137
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:40,630
Look, I was skeptical, too,
but she does have a motive.

138
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,410
- She hates Susan.
- Well, that's a motive to attack her.

139
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:47,820
Well, maybe Katherine saw
Julie taking out the garbage

140
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,210
and thought it was me.

141
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:51,700
She mistook you
for a 23-year-old?

142
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,600
I'm sorry, Mrs. Delfino, but, uh,

143
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,250
unless you've got actual evidence,

144
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,620
we're gonna keep assuming that
this is a random incident...

145
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,090
one that your daughter
thankfully survived.

146
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,980
Damn it! They forgot the pickle!

147
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,160
What is with this place?

148
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,320
Is there anyone here that understands

149
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,110
a woman can be a psycho killer, too?

150
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:16,050
Ah, maybe I can help.

151
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,820
You want me to take this one?

152
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:19,980
Have at it.

153
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,450
Thank you so much.

154
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:25,240
So how about I, uh,
take a look at your file?

155
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,740
I will swing by tomorrow,

156
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,600
- and I'll get your statement then.
- Great.

157
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,330
Well... It is nice to know that someone

158
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:37,710
Cares about justice More than pickles.

159
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,200
Come on, Mike.

160
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:45,520
Are you sure you want this case?

161
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,590
'Cause I've got a serial killer
here that might be more fun.

162
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:53,130
Nah, she and I go way back.

163
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,710
She doesn't remember
me now, but she will.

164
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,420
I wish you hadn't committed us to this.

165
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,870
Why? They're our neighbors,

166
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,470
and they've been asking us for weeks.

167
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:10,670
I'm not a fan of Angie Bolen.
She can be very forward.

168
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,860
I like her. She's earthy,
takes a real interest in people.

169
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,280
Yes. Last week, she asked
me how much my dress cost

170
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,660
and did I still get
visits from my Aunt Flo.

171
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,110
Well, I believe that's
a euphemism for...

172
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,970
I know what it means.

173
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:26,650
By the way, I stopped by
that antique store today...

174
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,310
the one where you said
you bought that brooch.

175
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,920
I thought I'd get you a replacement

176
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,410
since you gave yours to Susan.

177
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,710
But the owner said they
don't sell jewelry there.

178
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,280
Just furniture.

179
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,210
Well, that's odd.

180
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:40,230
I must've confused that store

181
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,930
with the jewelry shop on Maple Street.

182
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:45,450
Yes, I remember now.
That's where I bought it.

183
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,520
Hey, look who's here!

184
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,210
My goodness. Another course?

185
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:59,490
Well, my grandma Bombelli always said,

186
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:02,640
"If the men can still button their
pants, dinner ain't over yet."

187
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:10,100
Is her braciole amazing or what?

188
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,080
I have to admit, I've
never had this before.

189
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,630
And it is quite tasty.

190
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:16,390
Aw, thanks, hon. Hang on a sec.

191
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:20,680
You don't want to stain
that gorgeous blouse.

192
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,640
I'm actually a very neat eater.

193
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,310
Oh, hey, when Nick here
starts twirlin' his pasta,

194
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:28,490
nobody's safe.

195
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:31,980
I did get some friendly
fire from a meatball earlier.

196
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,850
I'm glad we're finally doing this.

197
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,710
You two are hard to pin down.

198
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,760
Well, we've been incredibly busy.

199
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,430
Oh, I'll bet, especially
since Katherine wigged out

200
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,340
and you had to give her the boot.

201
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,650
You know, if you need
someone to replace her,

202
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:46,910
you could a lot worse than Angie.

203
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:47,690
Oh?

204
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,690
Yeah, her grandma Bombelli had
the best restaurant in little Italy

205
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,160
and taught Angie everything she knew.

206
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,180
I mean...

207
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,710
If you're lookin' for help.

208
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,120
Well, if your food is all this good...

209
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,020
We're... not hiring.

210
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,660
Sorry.

211
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,840
Okay. It's just a thought.

212
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,250
You sure, Bree?

213
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:11,870
She said no.

214
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:14,930
No, I'm just sayin'... you
don't know what you're missin'.

215
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,800
Nick, she's had four courses.
She knows what she's missing.

216
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,550
Now zip it.

217
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:21,470
Don't bite my head off.
I'm just tryin' to help.

218
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,560
What, by embarrassing our guests?

219
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,700
Just ignore him, okay?

220
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,790
It was your idea to cook for her.

221
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:36,220
Thank you! Now they're gonna think

222
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,200
that I don't cook for people
unless I have an angle.

223
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,730
I am so sorry.

224
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,840
Now look at them. They're
wishin' they hadn't come.

225
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,650
- No! we're having a lovely time.
- No! we're thrilled to be here!

226
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,350
Perfect! Now you're
makin' our guests lie.

227
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:55,970
I'm gonna go stir the sauce.

228
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,720
I'll get more wine.

229
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,670
We're gonna need it.

230
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:06,560
Uh, just curious, how many more courses?

231
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,090
Three.

232
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:14,410
Orson, I never thought
I'd say this to you again,

233
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:17,030
but please... unbutton your pants.

234
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,150
Okay.

235
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,470
If you have half a cabbage,

236
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,310
and someone gives you a quarter cabbage,

237
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,500
how much cabbage do you have?

238
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,840
None, because I hate cabbages
and I wouldn't take 'em.

239
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,600
Fine. They're balloons.

240
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,770
There's no such thing as half a balloon.

241
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:39,050
Well, there is a such
thing as half an allowance,

242
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:41,650
which is what you're gonna get
if you don't start to focus.

243
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:43,860
Why can't I just use a calculator?

244
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,660
'Cause you have to know this stuff.

245
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,070
If not, you're gonna end up
scrubbing other people's toilets!

246
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,520
Sorry.

247
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:56,140
Look, if you finish this page,
we'll go get some ice cream.

248
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:59,350
- How's that sound?
- I don't want to have ice cream with you.

249
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:08,230
I'm gonna get some air.

250
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,960
Will you make sure she
doesn't move from the table?

251
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,050
What do you call this again?

252
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,630
Uh, foie gras mousse.

253
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,780
Mmm. Tastes so elegant.

254
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,890
Don't you think it's elegant?

255
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,320
It's okay.

256
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,600
Would you like to sample
something else, Mr. Vitale?

257
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,270
Some salmon en croute or
perhaps some coq au vin?

258
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:33,300
Got anything I can pronounce?

259
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,260
You don't need to pronounce it.

260
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,850
You just gotta wipe it off your shirt.

261
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:40,460
You wanna end up on a plate
next to the salmon, keep it up.

262
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,370
I... I'm sorry we wasted your time.

263
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:46,250
My husband doesn't understand
elegant food. He's an ignoramus.

264
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,060
Hey, this ignoramus is throwing you

265
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,360
an anniversary party for 500 people.

266
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,400
500, you say?

267
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:56,780
Let's, um, sit down
and figure something out

268
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:59,340
because I would really
love to cater this party.

269
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,080
Look, you seem like a nice lady.

270
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,740
It's just that our guests
are comin' in from the Bronx.

271
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,550
They don't know from fancy food.

272
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:08,910
It's more of a sausage and
peppers crowd. I'm sorry.

273
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:12,530
I could make you braciole.

274
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:14,450
You can do braciole?

275
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,560
Yes, and, uh...

276
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,280
gnocchi and tortelloni
and, uh, lasagna verde.

277
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,670
But none of that stuff's on your menu.

278
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:25,410
That's because they're family recipes

279
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:27,460
from... my grandmother Bombelli.

280
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:30,170
You're Italian? You don't look it.

281
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,300
Papa was Irish.

282
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,330
I may get my hair
from the o'rourke side,

283
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:35,090
but my stomach...

284
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:35,900
She's all bombelli.

285
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,690
If you give me this job,

286
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,980
I will feed your family my stracotto

287
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,910
till the men can't button their pants.

288
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:46,670
Now that's what we're
lookin' for. You're hired.

289
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:50,870
Ahh! I feel better.

290
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,380
All right, let's get back to it.

291
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,840
Hold it. You got all
these problems right?

292
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,530
You cheated, didn't you? Confess!

293
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,590
No, Ivana helped me.

294
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,700
- Who's Ivana?
- That's me.

295
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,420
We met when you handed
me this bucket and rag.

296
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,350
Oh. yeah. Right.

297
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:18,270
Sorry. Uh, you helped her?

298
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:22,910
I told her to look at fractions
like a big chocolate cake.

299
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,620
The bottom number is the whole thing,

300
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:27,120
and the top number
represents how many slices.

301
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,170
Well, I should've known cake would
make everything come into focus.

302
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,660
Math is my specialty.

303
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:35,410
I have a PHD in engineering
from the University of Bucharest.

304
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:38,590
But it means nothing in the
American job market. So...

305
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:41,310
Wow. A doctor.

306
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:42,240
Impressive.

307
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,970
Oh, the upstairs bathroom has a
bunch of hair stuck in the drain.

308
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:47,780
Can you take care of that?

309
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,200
Sure.

310
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:54,290
Mom, this next page doesn't
make sense. I need help.

311
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:58,880
Uh... doctor?

312
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,280
I'm thinking that drain can wait.

313
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:12,370
- Nick...
- Hey, Lynette! Perfect timing.

314
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,260
I was just thinking about
busting open a bottle of wine.

315
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:18,600
Well, actually, I'm
here to talk to Nick.

316
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,760
I was admiring your roses

317
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,150
and I was hoping you could
give me a few pointers.

318
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,240
Honey, you hear that?

319
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,610
People are asking us for gardening tips.

320
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,480
We are officially suburban.

321
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,000
Oh, so... wine?

322
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,920
- Uh... you go ahead.
- All right.

323
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,520
- Thanks,
though. - Mm-hmm.

324
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,000
So here's the key...

325
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,820
you, uh, you cut going away from the bud

326
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,650
- at a 45 degree angle...
- I know about you and Julie.

327
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,840
For God sakes, you're twice her age.

328
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,190
Okay, Lynette, this is
none of your business.

329
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,940
No offense.

330
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,080
None taken.

331
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,100
But you know who might
be offended? Her father.

332
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,140
If Karl finds out, he's
gonna come over here

333
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:01,140
and cut your buds off
at a 45 degree angle.

334
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,950
- Yeah, thanks for the warning.
- I mean it.

335
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:05,330
If you don't stop bothering
julie, you will be sorry.

336
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:07,190
Happy gardening.

337
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,820
Wait, hang on a second. Hang on. Hang...

338
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,030
Wait, Julie said I was bothering her?

339
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:14,440
Did she also tell you that
she started this whole thing?

340
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,290
She came after me.

341
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,480
All right, there are
two sides to every story.

342
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,320
Yeah, well, your side is married.

343
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,550
Look, I tried to resist.

344
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:26,750
She just wore me down,

345
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,720
talking about how she'd
never met anybody like me,

346
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,990
she never felt this way before.

347
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,920
She's been jerking me
around since the day we met.

348
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,680
I don't care! Just leave her alone.

349
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,880
Yeah, all right. all right, fine.

350
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,890
If I find out you told anyone about us

351
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:42,730
you're the one who's gonna be sorry.

352
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,880
So like I said, you
wanna water the roses

353
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,440
you know, a few times a week.

354
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,960
Don't get anything on the foliage.

355
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,470
That's how they get diseased. all right?

356
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,870
Hey, thanks, baby.

357
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:07,700
You okay?

358
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:13,820
I think I might know
who strangled julie.

359
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,630
Hey, good timing. I'm
putting dinner on the table.

360
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:29,720
I thought the housekeeper
was supposed to start today.

361
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,120
She did, and she's fantastic!

362
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,850
And her family escaped from Romania

363
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:38,350
with practically nothing.

364
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,410
Well, what were they
fleeing from, cleanliness?

365
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:45,410
Well, I... I didn't wanna just
throw work at her the first day.

366
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:46,500
We needed time to bond.

367
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,510
Okay, so when does she start
bonding with the dishwasher?

368
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:54,300
Daddy, look what I did!
Fractions! All right!

369
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,850
So mommy taught you how to do fractions.

370
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,640
Mommy didn't. Ivana...

371
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,580
Ivana take all the credit myself!

372
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,020
Can you believe her?

373
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,200
After all the work I've done...

374
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,720
let's go teach you some manners.

375
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,430
So the best I can figure,

376
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:15,230
the attack happened
around 11:30 that night.

377
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:17,630
Now people saw Katherine

378
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,600
leaving the wedding in the afternoon,

379
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,860
and no one saw her again
until the next morning.

380
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,010
So... you have to wonder.

381
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,000
Um... I am sorry

382
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,860
but aren't you gonna
write some of this down?

383
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,290
You totally don't remember me, do you?

384
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,970
Oh, my gosh!

385
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:40,050
No. sorry. uh, can I get a little help?

386
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:43,700
Denise. Denise Lapera.

387
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,490
Of course!

388
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,660
A little more help, please?

389
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,580
Fairview High.

390
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:55,450
I used to sit behind you in
Mr. Parsons' English class.

391
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,730
Oh, my God! I am such an idiot!

392
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:01,670
Denise Lapeera!

393
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:03,770
- Lapera.
- Lapera.

394
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:10,480
Mr. Parsons.

395
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,810
"Pit-stain" Parsons.

396
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:14,410
Oh, gosh. I wonder what
ever happened to him.

397
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:16,940
Yeah, I actually arrested
him a few years back.

398
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,670
Twice. Drunk driving.

399
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,340
He got a little aggressive.
I had to use my taser.

400
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:24,730
Part of my was like

401
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,570
"zip! And that's for 'Beowulf'!"

402
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,730
That's good times.

403
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:33,110
Oh, good times.

404
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,530
And the good times just keep
rolling for you, huh, Susan?

405
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:38,570
I mean, look, you got a handsome husband

406
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:42,930
and two beautiful
children and a lovely home.

407
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:47,800
Oh. Well, how about
you, Detective lapeera?

408
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,580
- Lapera.
- Lapera.

409
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,890
Uh, I, you know, you have
done very well for yourself.

410
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,570
Professionally, maybe.

411
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:59,190
But I'm living in my mother's basement.

412
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:03,900
I'm sorry.

413
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,670
- Uh, divorced?
- Never married.

414
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,120
Dating anyone?

415
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,800
No, but I did bowl a
179 the other night.

416
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,910
And you're a detective.

417
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,590
So back to Katherine.

418
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,920
Uh, is there, you know, anything else

419
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,790
That you would need
to know? No, I'm good.

420
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:29,700
I'll just head over
there now and nose around

421
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,220
and see if she has an alibi.

422
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:35,110
Oh, actually, uh,
Denise, one more thing.

423
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:38,250
Um, this is a very
tight-knit community,

424
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,770
and I'm afraid if Katherine
finds out that I'm the one

425
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:43,750
that accused her of this,
things could get ugly.

426
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,920
Aw, we wouldn't want that, would we?

427
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,840
Exactly, so maybe you could just say

428
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,800
it was an anonymous tip or something.

429
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,040
- Sure.
- Thanks.

430
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,510
- Oh, say hi to your mom.
- Yeah, we don't speak.

431
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,580
Oh, look. what a nice gift.

432
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,870
It's the least I could do to thank you

433
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,380
for that marvelous dinner.

434
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,690
Oh, please, we should be
thanking you for not walking out

435
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:09,600
when me and Nick started
screaming at each other.

436
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,210
Oh, it was just one course.

437
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:13,860
The rest of the meal
was extremely quiet.

438
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,690
God, you are so tactful.

439
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:18,450
You think you can teach me some of that?

440
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:21,700
And take away that earthy
charm? I wouldn't think of it.

441
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,760
Listen, Angie, I have this friend

442
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,630
coming to town next
week, and I would love

443
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:29,790
to serve her that
dinner you made for us,

444
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:32,370
if you don't mind sharing your recipes.

445
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:34,810
Oh, gee, I would love to
help, but grandma bombelli

446
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:38,440
was real strict about not
sharing the family recipes.

447
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,720
Please?

448
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,720
This friend just loves
good italian food.

449
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,290
Take her to Piccolino.
Their food is good.

450
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:51,080
Um... this friend...

451
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,590
she doesn't really go
to restaurants anymore,

452
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,500
not since the fire.

453
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:58,000
People stare, so...

454
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,380
Oh, my God. that's awful. you know what?

455
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:04,490
Grandma would want this
woman to eat well. Hold on.

456
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:10,400
Okay, we got the gnocchi, lasagna verde,

457
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,520
the tortelloni, the braciole,
the stracotto, arancini

458
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,590
and the polenta cake.

459
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,540
But... I'm making a big exception here,

460
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,870
so promise you won't
go passing these around.

461
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:28,290
Trust me. I will treat these
recipes as if they were my own.

462
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:32,160
She has been over there
a long time, hasn't she?

463
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,730
Man, are there enough photos
of you in this yearbook?

464
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:42,360
- Wow. Do you still have this cheerleading outfit?
- Mike!

465
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,260
I just thought if you put it on,

466
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,970
it might jog your memory.

467
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,110
Looking at Denise's
photo might do the trick.

468
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:55,630
Hey, here she is. Yikes.

469
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:57,840
Hair in the '80s... what
were you girls thinking?

470
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,610
Oh, my God. Moose.

471
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:00,900
Too much mousse, if you ask me.

472
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:04,040
No, the animal. That was her nickname.

473
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:08,590
- Oh, God. Oh, God.
- What's wrong?

474
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:12,250
This is moose Lapera.

475
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:15,190
She was the only girl that
hated me in high school.

476
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,430
Why?

477
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:18,950
I may have mentioned to Beth Porter

478
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:21,670
that... she had a laugh like a moose.

479
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:23,500
You gave her the nickname?

480
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,710
No, I just made that comparison.

481
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:27,970
Beth is the one that got
the entire school to go...

482
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,110
whenever she walked by.

483
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,810
And she hates you because of that?

484
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:39,290
Well, and also... I
kinda stole her boyfriend.

485
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,240
"Kind of"?

486
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:45,660
She spent all senior year
in love with Mark Malone,

487
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,340
and they went on, like, one date,

488
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:51,790
and mark noticed me and
dumped moose to ask me out.

489
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:54,110
So the guy came after
you. Wasn't your fault.

490
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,840
Clearly you were never
a high school girl.

491
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,520
Moose was convinced that
I stole Mark from her,

492
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,540
just like Katherine is
convinced that I... oh, my God!

493
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,300
I sent her over there.

494
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:08,590
It's like a meeting of
the "I hate Susan" club!

495
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:09,910
What am I gonna do?

496
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:11,720
This was a long time ago.

497
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:14,630
Nobody holds a grudge that long.

498
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,800
Hey, maybe you're right. Look at this.

499
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,790
I think she might be
arresting Katherine right now.

500
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,510
That is a perp walk.

501
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:31,690
She is taking Katherine on a perp walk.

502
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,910
Looks more like a perp hug.

503
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:42,760
What is going on?
What... what is she doing?

504
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,740
I think she's showing us how long

505
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,400
someone can hold her grudge.

506
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:55,610
Juanita, I was thinking,

507
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:58,960
after you and Ivana
finish your schoolwork,

508
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,900
would you like to go
see a movie with me...

509
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:01,770
just the two of us.

510
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:04,660
Cool! Can we have
junior mints for dinner?

511
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,720
Wouldn't be a movie if you
weren't throwing up candy

512
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:08,170
on the ride home.

513
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,070
Hi. Can I help you?

514
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,070
Hola. I'm Christina.

515
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,790
From happy housekeeper?

516
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,880
Oh! Oh, there must be some mistake.

517
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,690
Uh, our maid is Ivana.

518
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,000
I request Ivana. Where's Ivana?

519
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,360
My english not so good.

520
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,740
It's okay. It's our new cleaning lady.

521
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:37,060
Gracias por venir.

522
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:40,650
Would you excuse us
one moment? Un momento.

523
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,270
What do you mean, new cleaning lady?

524
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,300
Where's Ivana?

525
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:47,720
I called the agency and had
them send over someone else.

526
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,480
Well... why?

527
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,250
Because Ivana sucked,

528
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,430
and not in that good vacuum sort of way.

529
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:56,320
Hey, cut her some slack. She's Romanian.

530
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:58,350
Okay, when your people are
being chased into Argentina

531
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,520
by angry cossacks,

532
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:02,130
maybe a sparkling toilet
isn't that important.

533
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,250
Argentina?

534
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:05,490
How about you stick to fractions,

535
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,570
and I'll teach Juanita geography?

536
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,060
Good bye

537
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:11,030
Gracias.

538
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:18,280
So how do you feel about
teaching math to 7-year-olds?

539
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,790
My english...

540
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:20,910
Not so good.

541
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,140
Yeah, I know.

542
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,840
Knock, knock!

543
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,620
Angie, what are you doing here?

544
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,760
Oh, your shortbread was so good,

545
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,550
I made you a batch
of my pignoli cookies.

546
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:38,360
How incredibly thoughtful of you.

547
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,000
Hey, I smell marinara.

548
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,200
You cooking my food for your friend?

549
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,970
Yes, and I am way behind, so...

550
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:46,330
Oh! Well, let me help you, then! Wow.

551
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:49,500
You sure got a lot of sauce here.

552
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,880
Lot of potatoes, too.

553
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:02,190
This is all for three people?

554
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:05,310
Well, with food like yours,
who wouldn't want leftovers?

555
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:14,380
"Vitale anniversary party
- arancino, gnocchi, braciole."

556
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:18,030
You were stealing my
recipes for a catering job.

557
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,110
I wanted to serve foie gras.
The client demanded pasta.

558
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:23,270
So you come running to
me with some sob story

559
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,690
about a burn victim who can
only be healed by manicott'?

560
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:27,270
I admit that was a bit tacky.

561
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,130
I lit a candle for that woman!

562
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:32,370
If you think about it,
it was a huge compliment.

563
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:34,570
And the compliment is

564
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:37,060
that my food is good
enough for your business

565
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,270
but I'm not.

566
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:40,560
I would never say you
weren't good enough.

567
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,990
Of course you wouldn't. You're tactful.

568
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:45,570
But you know what? I'm
not, which is why I can say

569
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,410
that you're a two-faced,
condescending bitch

570
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:49,940
who will never make a nickel

571
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:50,650
off my dead grandma's braciole!

572
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,810
But enjoy the cookies!

573
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:00,140
- That's insane.
- I know this is hard for you.

574
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:02,320
It's impossible. It
couldn't have been Nick.

575
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:04,210
How can you be so sure? It was dark.

576
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:06,500
You told the police you
couldn't see who attacked you.

577
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,250
This doesn't make any
sense. He loves me.

578
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,470
Exactly, and you broke up with him.

579
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,650
Honey, this is something
we have to consider.

580
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:16,810
Well, I can't consider
it, okay? I just can't.

581
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:24,360
Julie... we watched you grow up.

582
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,850
You're like a daughter to us.

583
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:29,350
We can't stand by and do nothing.

584
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,740
So you're gonna talk to the police

585
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:35,290
no matter what I say.

586
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,850
I think we have to.

587
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:46,680
It just couldn't be him.

588
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:54,060
You. What are you doing here?

589
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:55,600
The agency gave me this address.

590
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,730
Please, Ivana, I need you to come back.

591
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,410
Your husband told the agency

592
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:00,640
that I am a lousy housekeeper.

593
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,090
You never told him
what I was really doing.

594
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,220
The agency almost fired
me. You have to leave.

595
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:08,130
Oh, no, no, no! Wait! Wait!

596
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:10,830
- I need you!
- Juanita needs you.

597
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,790
See? She needs you.
She has a test tomorrow,

598
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,600
and when I teach her, one
of us ends up in tears.

599
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,390
Don't make me teach my baby.

600
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,940
I'm sorry. I have floors to scrub.

601
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,950
Forget scrubbing.
Ivana, you have a gift.

602
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:26,340
Share it with the world,
starting with my daughter.

603
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,130
What about the floor?

604
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,590
You missed a spot.

605
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,400
Got a minute?

606
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:57,940
This really isn't a good time.

607
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:00,650
Ooh. Gnocchi.

608
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:06,930
Tasty.

609
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,570
Don't patronize me.

610
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:12,970
Angie's are light as air.
Mine are like little shot puts.

611
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:15,870
Well, perhaps this will cheer you up.

612
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:19,010
I went to that jewelry store on Maple

613
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,430
and look what I found.

614
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:24,730
- You like it?
- I told you, I don't have time for this.

615
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,420
You know, it's odd. I asked
them about the first brooch,

616
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,790
but they said...

617
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,110
Oh, for God sakes, Orson,
would you just stop it?!

618
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,830
I have told you again and
again I want a divorce.

619
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:35,500
Do you think you can change
my mind with trinkets?

620
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:38,150
I don't want jewelry. I
don't want romantic gestures.

621
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:41,430
I want out! Now would
you please leave me alone?

622
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:44,480
Or for God sakes, I swear
I'll throw something at you!

623
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,060
Just not one of the gnocchi.

624
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:48,010
Those things could put a man's eye out.

625
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:53,950
Sorry I'm late!

626
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,900
I had to take down some geezer

627
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,840
in the ten items or less line.

628
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:02,060
Ivana, you should probably split

629
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,670
before Carlos gets ho... oh, my!

630
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:07,260
Yeah, I got off work early,

631
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:10,570
so I let our cleaning woman go home.

632
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:16,250
Juanita, good job. Let's
knock off early today.

633
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,770
Okay, daddy.

634
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,310
Do you hear that? I
think Celia fell down.

635
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,470
Gaby.

636
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,390
I'm sorry.

637
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,640
I asked you for help.

638
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:36,540
I asked for a tutor, and you said no.

639
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:38,020
Because you're her mother.

640
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,840
You should be able to set
aside a few hours each day

641
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:42,850
- to teach your own daughter.
- And I will teach her.

642
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:45,060
There's so many things
I'm gonna teach her...

643
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,560
how to dress, how to put on makeup.

644
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,690
I'll even show her how to
get a boy to notice her.

645
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:53,730
That's stuff I know. And
we're gonna have so much fun.

646
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,990
But fractions and grammar and history...

647
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:02,030
it's just not my
thing, and she knows it.

648
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,950
And then she gets frustrated
because I'm frustrated.

649
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:07,660
And it's ruining our relationship.

650
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,860
Come on, Gaby. Let's not exaggerate.

651
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,980
Carlos, she turned me down

652
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:16,000
when I asked to take her for ice cream.

653
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,590
I know. I know.

654
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:25,750
Some moms are made to homeschool,

655
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:27,510
and I'm just not one of them.

656
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:31,650
Okay.

657
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,850
I get it. hmm?

658
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:36,360
We will figure something else out.

659
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:38,640
You won't have to
homeschool her anymore.

660
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:41,130
Oh. Thank you, Carlos.

661
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:42,580
You're welcome.

662
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,270
Can I keep the housekeeper?

663
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,020
Absolutely not.

664
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,270
I know. I know.

665
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:00,420
- May I come in, please?
- What now?

666
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:05,570
Um... I just...

667
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,440
Came to say I'm sorry.

668
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,130
What I did was wrong,

669
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:14,210
and those names you called me were harsh

670
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:16,510
but regrettably accurate.

671
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,390
I don't know if you'd even
consider working for me now,

672
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:21,300
but if you would, I would be honored

673
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:23,110
to have you in my kitchen.

674
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:27,120
Well, well, well. You must
be drowning over there.

675
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,700
All right, I'm drowning.

676
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,720
And you want me to save you.

677
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,140
Please.

678
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,450
First, tell me this.

679
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:42,740
Why don't you like me?

680
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,580
I like you.

681
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,330
I find you colorful and...

682
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:48,520
Oh, enough with the tact.

683
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,970
Fine. I...

684
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:57,900
You make me uncomfortable.

685
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,690
I don't know how to respond

686
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,710
when someone is as candid as you are.

687
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,620
You say whatever pops in your mind.

688
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:07,270
You fight with your husband
in front of guests...

689
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:08,440
Oh, well, not everyone's marriage

690
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:10,530
is as perfect as yours, Nancy Reagan.

691
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,600
My marriage is not perfect.

692
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:17,050
Oh, come on.

693
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:18,910
Orson and I barely speak
to each other anymore.

694
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:22,390
We haven't shared a bed in three months.

695
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:26,290
Seriously?

696
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,730
Well, I never would've guessed.

697
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:33,510
That's the point.

698
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:34,840
Our problems are personal.

699
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:37,320
We don't share them with the world.

700
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:40,800
But you can't seem to
keep anything to yourself.

701
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:47,510
What?

702
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,490
Trust me, honey.

703
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:53,320
If there's one thing I know how to do,

704
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:55,390
it's keep things to myself.

705
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,260
Well... there we are.

706
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,410
You think I'm vulgar.

707
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:10,000
Oh, excuse me. Candid.

708
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,440
And I think you're a tight ass.

709
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,000
But you need help, and I need a job,

710
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:19,550
so... let's get cookin'.

711
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:21,330
You mean it?

712
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:24,870
Thank you, Angie.

713
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:26,870
You're a lifesaver.

714
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,840
So... no sex for three months.

715
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,490
What do you do, sit on the dryer?

716
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,380
Okay, now you're just goading me.

717
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:41,500
One ham on wheat, extra mayo.

718
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:42,860
Corned beef, lean,

719
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:47,030
and of course, an entire jar of pickles.

720
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,530
What's this about?

721
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:53,070
Honestly, uh, I don't
think this new detective

722
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:54,320
is up to the job,

723
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,110
and I need a couple of seasoned pros

724
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,410
with old school savvy...

725
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:58,260
Oh, hello, Susan.

726
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,940
Denise.

727
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,770
Why don't you call me
"Moose"? You know you want to.

728
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,650
- Moose? 
- Moose?

729
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:13,940
Denise, I'm glad I ran into you.

730
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:16,260
I... I came down here to apologize.

731
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,320
No, you came down here to
get me kicked off the case.

732
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:23,060
Okay. One more thing to apologize for.

733
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:27,270
So look, um, I really am
sorry about Mark Malone,

734
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:29,030
but that was ages ago,

735
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:32,060
and that guy had "loser"
written all over him.

736
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:34,380
Hmm. He's the CEO of Malone Enterprises

737
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,750
with a 6-bedroom home
overlooking the lake.

738
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:40,030
Okay. The point is,

739
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:43,780
I'd hate for our history
to cloud your judgment

740
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,120
in this case.

741
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,320
You think I'm behaving unprofessionally.

742
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,240
Well...

743
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:52,600
when you were leaving
Katherine's house the other day,

744
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:55,690
you two did look... pretty chummy.

745
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:57,520
Oh, well, it turns out
we have a lot in common.

746
00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:00,390
We both had boyfriends stolen by you.

747
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,470
I did not steal Mike.

748
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,020
Katherine just thinks that I did,

749
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,680
which is why I'm betting
she strangled Julie.

750
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:08,890
Yeah, well, she couldn't have,

751
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:10,590
because she was on the phone
all night with her daughter,

752
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:13,620
- and the phone records confirm it.
- Are you sure?

753
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:16,040
I know how to do my job, Susan.

754
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,700
In fact, I've discovered
some interesting facts

755
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,540
while investigating this case.

756
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,300
Is it true

757
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:25,620
that on the evening of September 16th

758
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:28,070
at approximately 11:45,

759
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,670
you shot Katherine Mayfair?

760
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,130
What? That was an accident.

761
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:36,200
And you not reporting it was a crime.

762
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:40,950
Okay, um, let's not blow
this out of proportion.

763
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:42,480
I hurt you,

764
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:44,960
but you've gotta get past
this. You can't keep blaming me

765
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:47,120
for the way that your life turned out.

766
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:51,520
It's just... it's gonna make
you bitter and miserable,

767
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,590
like Katherine.

768
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,860
You need closure, Denise.

769
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,520
You have the right to be happy.

770
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,770
And you have the right

771
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:03,990
to remain silent.

772
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:08,570
In you go!

773
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:11,260
Hey, Susan, you know
what this is called?

774
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,780
Closure.

775
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:23,730
The Julie Mayer assault?
We're not on that case anymore.

776
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:25,540
Detective Lapera's handling that.

777
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:26,550
Why?

778
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:28,700
Well, we have some new
information to report.

779
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:30,900
The detective is out
on a call at the moment.

780
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:33,200
This needs to be checked out right away.

781
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:34,980
What needs to be checked out right away?

782
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:37,870
Did you guys ever talk to Nick Bolen?

783
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:39,990
The dad of the kid we arrested.

784
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:41,510
Yeah, yeah, we talked to him.

785
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:43,280
I'm guessing he didn't
mention that he and Julie

786
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:45,040
were having an affair.

787
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:49,210
She broke it off right
before she was attacked.

788
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,100
No kiddin'.

789
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,280
Hey, babe. What's up?

790
00:38:57,340 --> 00:39:00,030
Good news. I am a working girl.

791
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:02,000
Bree asked me to join her company.

792
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:05,360
Yeah? Hey, that's great.

793
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,560
Hey, you're still gonna
cook for me, right?

794
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,530
Are you kidding? You're my guinea pig.

795
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,870
Mwah. Congrats.

796
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:15,450
Oh, and there was something
else I needed to tell you.

797
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:17,830
Oh, right, right, right. Cops called.

798
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:19,020
They wanted to know where you were

799
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:21,140
the night that Julie
Mayer was strangled.

800
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,230
What?

801
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:28,410
Why would they be asking about me?

802
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:31,130
I guess because you were
having an affair with her?

803
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,210
Look, I don't know what they told you.

804
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,950
They didn't tell me anything.

805
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,070
I've known for weeks.

806
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:41,430
Ange...

807
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:45,840
don't. Don't embarrass
yourself... or me.

808
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:48,060
You did a stupid thing.

809
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:51,340
But I know you can't go anywhere,

810
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:53,630
and you know I can't go anywhere.

811
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:55,720
So we're gonna have to get past this.

812
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,760
I'm so sorry.

813
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:01,650
I've put you through a
lot, so you get this one.

814
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,440
But that's it.

815
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:06,310
You know I never attacked her.

816
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:08,020
And that is why I lied and told the cops

817
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,870
you were with me the entire night.

818
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,960
So we're okay?

819
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:25,790
Now we're okay.

820
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,630
The truth is,

821
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:36,880
there's only so much
we can learn from books.

822
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:40,920
They can't tell you how
to make your wife happy.

823
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:48,660
They can't tell you how to
appreciate your neighbor.

824
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:53,220
They can't tell you

825
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,620
if that man across the
street is dangerous.

826
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:05,520
No, the only way to truly
learn is from your mistakes.

827
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:09,840
Of course, if those
mistakes land you in jail,

828
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:13,160
it might be nice to have a book

829
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,760
to pass the time.
