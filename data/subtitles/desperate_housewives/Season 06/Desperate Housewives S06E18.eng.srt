1
00:00:00,688 --> 00:00:02,672
Previously on "Desperate Housewives... "

2
00:00:02,672 --> 00:00:06,580
That woman is a gold digger.

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,564
There was a shocking announcement.

4
00:00:08,564 --> 00:00:10,525
Proposal?

5
00:00:10,525 --> 00:00:12,274
She's the one. I know it.

6
00:00:12,274 --> 00:00:14,398
The other night was a mistake.

7
00:00:14,398 --> 00:00:16,302
A surprising move.

8
00:00:17,416 --> 00:00:18,495
And Mr. Logan?

9
00:00:18,495 --> 00:00:20,164
A dangerous disclosure.

10
00:00:20,164 --> 00:00:22,854
I'll tell you where she lives
when I get my a thousand dollars.

11
00:00:22,854 --> 00:00:24,515
A stunning discovery.

12
00:00:24,515 --> 00:00:27,321
- What are you doing with a picture of Rex?
- He was my father.

13
00:00:27,321 --> 00:00:29,809
And a welcoming embrace.

14
00:00:35,199 --> 00:00:38,678
You should never trust family photos.

15
00:00:38,678 --> 00:00:41,299
They are designed to be misleading.

16
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,924
A mother's bright smile may
hide a lifetime of disappointment

17
00:00:47,824 --> 00:00:52,642
a son's sweet expression
could conceal boundless rage.

18
00:00:53,966 --> 00:00:59,731
A daughter's sedate pose might
obscure years of UN-lady like behavior.

19
00:01:00,507 --> 00:01:06,333
And as for that father with the air of
dignity, there's always the chance... 

20
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:09,674
He has another family elsewhere.

21
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:14,106
I... I don't know what to say.

22
00:01:14,134 --> 00:01:15,917
Well, I'm not surprised.

23
00:01:15,917 --> 00:01:18,841
It's a shocking bit of
news, to say the least.

24
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,003
So you're my brother?

25
00:01:21,003 --> 00:01:23,004
Half-brother, to be precise.

26
00:01:24,191 --> 00:01:25,624
I can't believe this.

27
00:01:25,624 --> 00:01:29,218
Andrew, you have every right to be upset.

28
00:01:29,218 --> 00:01:31,490
Your father should have
told us about this years ago.

29
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:34,477
But please don't be angry
with Sam. It's not his fault.

30
00:01:35,985 --> 00:01:39,823
I'm fine. I just, uh, need
to be by myself for a while.

31
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,707
Of course. We understand.

32
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:45,787
If you don't mind, I'll hug you later.

33
00:01:45,787 --> 00:01:47,972
Take your time.

34
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:53,231
Well, he certainly handled
that better than I expected.

35
00:01:53,231 --> 00:01:54,748
When the shock wears off,

36
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:56,519
I think we'll end up good friends.

37
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:58,029
And wait till you meet Danielle.

38
00:01:58,029 --> 00:01:59,327
Her flight comes in tomorrow,

39
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:02,123
and I just know the two of you
are really gonna hit it off.

40
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:03,678
Don't you agree, Orson?

41
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:07,062
Uh, yes, I'm sure.

42
00:02:07,062 --> 00:02:10,798
Sam, would you mind
locking up the test kitchen?

43
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:12,291
Happy to.

44
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:15,053
Again, thank you for everything.

45
00:02:22,098 --> 00:02:24,744
So when did you speak to Danielle?

46
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:28,378
Oh, an hour ago, and she was
just as stunned as Andrew,

47
00:02:28,378 --> 00:02:30,359
but when I said I was gonna
have a little dinner for Sam,

48
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:31,838
she was determined to be here.

49
00:02:31,838 --> 00:02:34,712
Well, you've certainly wasted no time

50
00:02:34,712 --> 00:02:36,219
welcoming Sam to the family.

51
00:02:36,219 --> 00:02:39,355
Why not? That skeleton's been
kept in the closet long enough.

52
00:02:39,355 --> 00:02:43,038
No, I understand. And I
agree that Andrew and Danielle

53
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:44,588
should try to make a connection to Sam.

54
00:02:44,588 --> 00:02:46,050
He's their blood relative.

55
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:49,087
I'm just not sure why
you're so excited by it.

56
00:02:49,087 --> 00:02:50,717
Excited?

57
00:02:50,717 --> 00:02:52,450
I'm ashamed.

58
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:53,964
Ashamed?

59
00:02:53,964 --> 00:02:56,694
Rex kept that boy in
the shadows for years.

60
00:02:56,694 --> 00:02:59,665
I can't look at Sam without
feeling overwhelming guilt.

61
00:02:59,665 --> 00:03:02,950
- But you have nothing to feel guilty for.
- It doesn't matter.

62
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,054
Rex is gone, and someone
needs to make it up to him.

63
00:03:06,054 --> 00:03:10,189
He is a Van De Kamp, and I am gonna
see to it that he is treated like one.

64
00:03:12,422 --> 00:03:17,224
Yes, be careful when
looking at family photos... 

65
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:20,967
like certain members of the family,

66
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:25,379
they are not to be trusted.

67
00:03:37,114 --> 00:03:41,744
Every year, Oakridge private
school held a fund-raising drive.

68
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:46,737
Students were asked to
sell $3 bars of chocolate.

69
00:03:47,578 --> 00:03:51,185
Whoever sold the most
would receive a prize.

70
00:03:51,185 --> 00:03:57,472
Of course, for someone to
win, someone else had to lose.

71
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:02,451
Hey, M.J., have you gone in
and gotten your candy yet?

72
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:03,523
No.

73
00:04:03,523 --> 00:04:08,397
Well, you better hurry up, 'cause I
already saw some kids selling candy outside.

74
00:04:08,397 --> 00:04:10,780
- It doesn't matter.
- Why not?

75
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,381
'Cause I'm not gonna win.

76
00:04:12,381 --> 00:04:14,005
I never win anything.

77
00:04:15,098 --> 00:04:17,578
You promised him he'd win?

78
00:04:17,578 --> 00:04:20,597
He was about to cry. What
was I supposed to say?

79
00:04:20,597 --> 00:04:23,801
How about, "if at first you
don't succeed, try, try again"?

80
00:04:23,801 --> 00:04:27,432
He tries all the time.
He never wins anything.

81
00:04:27,432 --> 00:04:31,317
He's horrible at sports.
He's lousy at card games.

82
00:04:31,317 --> 00:04:35,545
Let us not forget his
humiliation at that spelling bee.

83
00:04:35,545 --> 00:04:38,236
Why did he think "kayak" had a "q" in it?

84
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:42,345
My point is that I want him
to feel good about himself.

85
00:04:42,345 --> 00:04:46,353
Every child should win
something at least once.

86
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:49,138
See, you win everything.

87
00:04:49,138 --> 00:04:51,679
I know what it's like to lose.

88
00:04:51,679 --> 00:04:54,711
Dear God, not the jump rope competition.

89
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:58,008
It was sixth grade, and there
was a jump rope competition.

90
00:04:58,008 --> 00:05:00,972
It was down to me and Barbara Briscoe.

91
00:05:00,972 --> 00:05:03,652
She had asthma, and it
was dandelion season,

92
00:05:03,652 --> 00:05:07,329
and her eyes were swollen,
and she was jumping blind,

93
00:05:07,329 --> 00:05:10,095
until... her mom... 

94
00:05:10,095 --> 00:05:12,926
gave her an antihistamine shot... 

95
00:05:12,926 --> 00:05:15,379
which is technically a steroid... 

96
00:05:15,379 --> 00:05:17,269
and she was juiced!

97
00:05:22,668 --> 00:05:25,210
So are you gonna be supportive or not?

98
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:27,284
Yes, I will,

99
00:05:27,284 --> 00:05:30,100
if you promise

100
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,312
to never tell that story again.

101
00:05:39,657 --> 00:05:41,623
Was good?

102
00:05:41,623 --> 00:05:44,604
Oh, if I had any government
secrets, they'd be yours.

103
00:05:44,604 --> 00:05:48,291
Irina? I'm sorry. I
need to get the laundry.

104
00:05:49,865 --> 00:05:51,542
Hold one second.

105
00:05:51,542 --> 00:05:53,230
I am yet to get decent.

106
00:05:58,014 --> 00:06:00,277
Come in. Thanks.

107
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:03,434
Huh. I thought I made
that bed this morning.

108
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,929
Um, I, um, take nap.

109
00:06:08,613 --> 00:06:10,133
Feel much better.

110
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:16,720
Yeah.

111
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,272
I'll bet you do.

112
00:06:19,763 --> 00:06:21,408
Well... 

113
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:25,155
I will see you downstairs.

114
00:06:27,162 --> 00:06:29,489
Man, that was close!

115
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,366
Aw, crap.

116
00:06:31,366 --> 00:06:33,809
Your father and I told you

117
00:06:33,809 --> 00:06:35,512
no sleeping together in this house,

118
00:06:35,512 --> 00:06:37,498
and here you are, openly defying us.

119
00:06:37,498 --> 00:06:39,719
Well, not openly. We were
hoping to get away with it.

120
00:06:39,719 --> 00:06:44,102
That is not funny. Your 11-year-old
sister is in the next room.

121
00:06:44,102 --> 00:06:47,132
I don't want you setting
that kind of example.

122
00:06:47,132 --> 00:06:49,974
Dude, look out. Mom's back from the store.

123
00:06:53,262 --> 00:06:55,871
Oh. Uh, this is what I was looking for.

124
00:06:56,224 --> 00:06:58,047
I better get dressed.

125
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:00,906
Preston! Preston, get back here!

126
00:07:04,277 --> 00:07:06,191
I don't want a repeat of this, Irina.

127
00:07:06,191 --> 00:07:08,324
Do you understand?

128
00:07:08,324 --> 00:07:12,044
Why don't you just speak truth?

129
00:07:12,044 --> 00:07:15,157
I mean, if Preston was
seeing another girl,

130
00:07:15,157 --> 00:07:17,137
you would not much care.

131
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:19,569
You just don't like me.

132
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:23,600
That... is not true.

133
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,584
I'm still getting to know you,

134
00:07:25,584 --> 00:07:28,180
and I am sure that over time,

135
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,947
I will come to think of you
as a valued member of our... 

136
00:07:31,947 --> 00:07:34,876
Oh, here's what I was looking for.

137
00:07:38,781 --> 00:07:41,592
Well, you were right.

138
00:07:41,592 --> 00:07:44,689
That was more refreshing
than taking a nap.

139
00:07:44,689 --> 00:07:46,282
Mm, I told you.

140
00:07:49,492 --> 00:07:51,737
- Uh, honey?
- Yeah?

141
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:53,843
Don't dress in front of the window.

142
00:07:53,843 --> 00:07:56,289
I'm afraid of what your
body could to do Roy's heart.

143
00:07:56,289 --> 00:07:57,671
Whoops.

144
00:07:58,843 --> 00:08:01,342
So, uh, did you ever call him back?

145
00:08:01,342 --> 00:08:04,821
Yeah, this morning. Mrs.
McCluskey had her surgery,

146
00:08:04,821 --> 00:08:06,255
and apparently, she's cancer-free,

147
00:08:06,255 --> 00:08:08,118
so Roy's throwing a party to celebrate.

148
00:08:08,118 --> 00:08:11,597
Oh, that's so sweet. I hope
you told him we'll be there.

149
00:08:11,597 --> 00:08:13,800
Can we talk about that?

150
00:08:15,388 --> 00:08:19,249
I told him we'd go, but I
don't think we should go...

151
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,963
together.

152
00:08:20,963 --> 00:08:23,570
Hmm. What do you mean?

153
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,865
Well, it's just... except for Susan,

154
00:08:25,865 --> 00:08:28,190
people don't really know
what's going on with us.

155
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,957
Hey, you know what's funny?

156
00:08:29,957 --> 00:08:31,807
Neither do I.

157
00:08:31,807 --> 00:08:35,913
So... what is going on between us?

158
00:08:35,913 --> 00:08:38,025
I mean, are we friends with benefits?

159
00:08:38,025 --> 00:08:39,668
Are we just dating? What?

160
00:08:44,256 --> 00:08:46,304
Do we have to put a label on it?

161
00:08:46,304 --> 00:08:47,926
No, I just... 

162
00:08:48,967 --> 00:08:51,795
I just want to know how you're feeling.

163
00:08:51,795 --> 00:08:53,422
I really like you.

164
00:08:53,422 --> 00:08:55,522
That's how I feel.

165
00:08:55,522 --> 00:08:58,268
Can't that be enough for now?

166
00:08:58,268 --> 00:09:03,186
It could be, but it could
also be pretty wonderful

167
00:09:03,186 --> 00:09:05,493
to let people know how
happy we make each other.

168
00:09:05,493 --> 00:09:08,416
I... don't know.

169
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,167
Hey.

170
00:09:10,167 --> 00:09:12,788
I was right about the nap.

171
00:09:17,998 --> 00:09:20,257
Hello, ladies! Hide the booze.

172
00:09:20,257 --> 00:09:22,454
We have a guest. Hey, Juanita.

173
00:09:22,454 --> 00:09:23,975
Okay, hit it.

174
00:09:23,975 --> 00:09:28,297
Hi. My name is Juanita Solis,
and I'm in the third grade.

175
00:09:28,297 --> 00:09:30,233
You're losing 'em. Get to the pitch.

176
00:09:30,233 --> 00:09:32,263
"Won't you support me?

177
00:09:32,263 --> 00:09:34,833
I am selling candy
so I can stay in school

178
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:37,317
and not end up on the
street selling drugs."

179
00:09:39,118 --> 00:09:41,861
I'll take it from here.
It's a fund-raiser.

180
00:09:41,861 --> 00:09:44,026
3 bucks a bar. Whip out your wallets.

181
00:09:44,026 --> 00:09:46,703
Well, I'd hate to see Juanita
on crack, so I'll buy one.

182
00:09:46,703 --> 00:09:49,366
- Me, too. Do you have caramel?
- One lousy bar?

183
00:09:49,366 --> 00:09:51,952
Ladies, it's a contest.
Juanita plans to win.

184
00:09:51,952 --> 00:09:55,356
Come on. Need I remind you
of all the crap I've bought

185
00:09:55,356 --> 00:09:58,114
from your kids over the
years? And I do mean crap,

186
00:09:58,114 --> 00:10:01,173
not like this quality processed
sugar I am peddling today.

187
00:10:01,173 --> 00:10:03,994
Juanita, M.J. is playing
in the other room.

188
00:10:03,994 --> 00:10:05,532
Why don't you go join him?

189
00:10:05,532 --> 00:10:09,163
Here's the thing... 
um, before you got here,

190
00:10:09,163 --> 00:10:12,926
Bree and Lynette agreed
to buy eight bars from M.J.

191
00:10:12,926 --> 00:10:14,935
It's okay. They can buy from Juanita, too.

192
00:10:15,942 --> 00:10:18,258
Well, it's a little more
complicated than that.

193
00:10:18,258 --> 00:10:23,129
See, um, M.J. Is having a bit
of a self-esteem crisis lately,

194
00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:25,967
and, uh, he feels like
he's on a losing streak,

195
00:10:25,967 --> 00:10:29,200
so I really, really
need him to win this one.

196
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,117
You understand, right?

197
00:10:31,117 --> 00:10:33,087
Of course.

198
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:35,454
- Thank you.
- I understand. I just don't care.

199
00:10:35,454 --> 00:10:36,986
Excuse me?

200
00:10:36,986 --> 00:10:39,203
Juanita's having a crisis of her own.

201
00:10:39,203 --> 00:10:42,253
She's new to Oakridge, and she's
having trouble making new friends.

202
00:10:42,253 --> 00:10:44,305
As you know, the winner gets a big party,

203
00:10:44,305 --> 00:10:45,670
and they can invite whoever they want,

204
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:48,083
which could go a long
way in helping her fit in.

205
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:50,503
You understand, right?

206
00:10:51,381 --> 00:10:53,567
Sure. Of course.

207
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,798
It's just, he's never won anything before.

208
00:10:59,798 --> 00:11:01,718
She has no friends.

209
00:11:05,345 --> 00:11:08,103
So... what are we doing?

210
00:11:08,103 --> 00:11:11,372
Well, it seems to me if
we buy the same amount

211
00:11:11,372 --> 00:11:13,587
from both of you, it'll
just be a wash, right?

212
00:11:13,587 --> 00:11:15,272
So really, we don't
need to buy any at all.

213
00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:21,653
Get out your wallet.

214
00:11:26,548 --> 00:11:29,640
I was so shocked to
hear you had lung cancer.

215
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,888
I didn't even know you smoked.

216
00:11:30,888 --> 00:11:32,951
I didn't. That's the thing.

217
00:11:32,951 --> 00:11:35,529
People think you have
to be a smoker to get it,

218
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:37,958
but you don't. A girl your age was

219
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:40,791
having the same surgery I had,
never smoked a day in her life.

220
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,728
You could be that girl, Gaby.

221
00:11:44,697 --> 00:11:48,272
Let's get a drink, you know,
since we're dying anyway.

222
00:11:50,107 --> 00:11:53,209
Now remember, we're not a couple.

223
00:11:53,209 --> 00:11:55,819
- I know. We're on a covert lesbian mission.
- I'm sorry.

224
00:11:55,819 --> 00:11:58,770
I just want people not to
figure out we're together.

225
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:00,045
It'll blow their minds.

226
00:12:00,045 --> 00:12:03,299
Oh, please. You stabbed
yourself and blamed Mike,

227
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:05,036
and this will blow their minds?

228
00:12:05,036 --> 00:12:07,939
- Hey, ladies.
- Hi, Tom. Having fun?

229
00:12:07,939 --> 00:12:10,291
Best cancer party ever.

230
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:13,909
Listen, um, I was
talking to Karen's doctor.

231
00:12:13,909 --> 00:12:16,952
Uh, you made quite the impression on him.

232
00:12:16,952 --> 00:12:20,146
- Me?
- Yeah. He begged me to introduce you.

233
00:12:20,146 --> 00:12:21,524
D... d... do you mind?

234
00:12:21,524 --> 00:12:23,014
Why would I?

235
00:12:23,014 --> 00:12:24,564
We're only roommates.

236
00:12:26,348 --> 00:12:29,144
And here's your change. Enjoy.

237
00:12:29,144 --> 00:12:31,188
Hey! Willy Wonka!

238
00:12:32,237 --> 00:12:35,132
Selling candy at an "I
survived cancer" party?

239
00:12:35,132 --> 00:12:36,344
Tacky.

240
00:12:36,491 --> 00:12:39,067
Chocolate is filled with antioxidants,

241
00:12:39,067 --> 00:12:41,768
which, as we all know, fight disease.

242
00:12:41,768 --> 00:12:44,185
So you could say that I just saved a life.

243
00:12:44,185 --> 00:12:47,004
Yeah, right. The competition
is between the kids.

244
00:12:47,004 --> 00:12:49,187
They're supposed to be doing
the selling, not the parents.

245
00:12:49,187 --> 00:12:52,239
Gaby, Speedo season is a month away,

246
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:55,123
and you have the nerve to
sell this to my husband?

247
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:03,149
He was a doctor. She was a surgeon.

248
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,056
Oh. Yeah.

249
00:13:05,795 --> 00:13:07,435
I always knew I'd go to med school,

250
00:13:07,435 --> 00:13:09,752
you know, that incredible
feeling of helping people.

251
00:13:09,752 --> 00:13:11,179
Plus, they give you that little pad,

252
00:13:11,179 --> 00:13:12,636
and you can write any
prescription you want.

253
00:13:13,816 --> 00:13:16,326
Beautiful and laughs at my jokes.

254
00:13:16,326 --> 00:13:18,782
Two more cocktails,
and I may be proposing.

255
00:13:18,782 --> 00:13:21,672
Hi. Sorry to interrupt.

256
00:13:21,672 --> 00:13:24,792
- Uh, can I talk to you for a minute?
- Will you excuse me, David?

257
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:28,588
And she never smoked a day in her life.

258
00:13:28,588 --> 00:13:31,278
You could be that girl, Lee.

259
00:13:32,768 --> 00:13:34,868
Look, it's one thing to
hide our relationship.

260
00:13:34,868 --> 00:13:37,646
- It's another to flirt with a man right in my face.
- I wasn't flirting.

261
00:13:37,646 --> 00:13:39,312
He was flirting with me.

262
00:13:39,312 --> 00:13:42,484
- I saw your face. You were enjoying it.
- Okay.

263
00:13:42,484 --> 00:13:44,238
Hey, listen up, everyone.

264
00:13:44,238 --> 00:13:46,114
I... I just want to
thank you all for coming

265
00:13:46,114 --> 00:13:49,841
and to say to Karen, thank
God you're all right, baby.

266
00:13:51,268 --> 00:13:52,807
Thanks, everybody.

267
00:13:52,807 --> 00:13:55,543
And I also want to thank
the big guy upstairs.

268
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,909
Now if we could all take a moment

269
00:13:57,909 --> 00:14:01,151
to remember the people who
weren't as lucky as I was.

270
00:14:03,651 --> 00:14:05,845
Make up your mind, Katherine.
Are you gay or straight?

271
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,751
I don't know! Just because
I enjoy having sex with you

272
00:14:08,751 --> 00:14:10,252
doesn't make me a lesbian!

273
00:14:16,366 --> 00:14:17,988
Look at this.

274
00:14:17,988 --> 00:14:21,693
I wonder what Rex would say
if he saw us here all together.

275
00:14:21,693 --> 00:14:23,636
Probably "who's the
guy in the wheelchair?"

276
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:28,300
So, Sam, mom tells me
you got some fancy degree?

277
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,133
His M.B.A., which he earned
while working two jobs

278
00:14:31,133 --> 00:14:34,134
- and nursing his sick mother.
- I just did what I had to do.

279
00:14:34,134 --> 00:14:37,780
Don't be so modest. He also
spent a summer in Micronesia,

280
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,964
- helping to dig wells.
- It was challenging, but I really

281
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:43,781
- wanted to work with the poor.
- Sounds like my first job.

282
00:14:43,781 --> 00:14:47,596
- You worked in the food court at the mall.
- The outlet mall.

283
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:50,978
Trust me. I know what it's
like to work with poor people.

284
00:14:50,978 --> 00:14:52,840
They're always late.

285
00:14:53,712 --> 00:14:56,077
Rex and I always hoped
the children would take

286
00:14:56,077 --> 00:14:58,343
an interest in working with
those less fortunate, but... 

287
00:14:58,343 --> 00:15:01,045
we saw an opportunity to
disappoint them once again,

288
00:15:01,045 --> 00:15:03,207
and we grabbed it.

289
00:15:04,414 --> 00:15:05,899
So... 

290
00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:08,553
My father was interested in charity work.

291
00:15:08,553 --> 00:15:10,762
- What else?
- Oh, so many things...

292
00:15:10,762 --> 00:15:13,280
travel, history, the arts.

293
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,754
Oh, he especially loved music.

294
00:15:15,754 --> 00:15:18,500
Really? Me, too. I play the guitar.

295
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,411
You do? Stay right there.

296
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,045
That was lovely.

297
00:15:43,045 --> 00:15:45,766
- I'm really rusty.
- Yeah, I could hear that.

298
00:15:45,766 --> 00:15:47,780
This is pretty cool.

299
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,041
I'm actually playing my dad's guitar.

300
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:53,791
It's just been sitting in that
closet for years, gathering dust.

301
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,813
In fact, why don't you keep it?

302
00:15:55,813 --> 00:15:57,299
- What?
- What?

303
00:15:57,299 --> 00:16:00,843
Why not? You should have something
to remember your father by.

304
00:16:00,843 --> 00:16:03,108
Whoa, whoa. Wait a
minute. What if I want it?

305
00:16:03,108 --> 00:16:05,326
What if Danielle wants it?

306
00:16:05,326 --> 00:16:08,121
- I don't want it.
- Don't you have a flight to catch?

307
00:16:08,121 --> 00:16:10,610
Andrew, you've never shown
any interest in that thing.

308
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,835
It's my dad's guitar.
I'm plenty interested.

309
00:16:12,835 --> 00:16:15,396
- But you don't even play.
- I do so.

310
00:16:16,613 --> 00:16:18,736
I took lessons, okay?

311
00:16:18,736 --> 00:16:20,832
Well, by all means... 

312
00:16:21,871 --> 00:16:23,922
We'd love to hear.

313
00:16:29,204 --> 00:16:31,891
Jingle bells

314
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:34,280
jingle bell... 

315
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,620
jingle

316
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,411
all the... 

317
00:16:38,411 --> 00:16:40,909
Way

318
00:16:40,909 --> 00:16:42,751
oh, what fun... 

319
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:46,830
What fun indeed. Now would
you please give Sam the guitar?

320
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,014
No.

321
00:16:48,988 --> 00:16:51,293
If Andrew wants it that badly... 

322
00:16:51,293 --> 00:16:54,094
he doesn't care about the guitar.
He's just being unreasonable.

323
00:16:54,094 --> 00:16:57,019
You're giving out my dad's
stuff to a total stranger,

324
00:16:57,019 --> 00:16:58,242
and I... I'm unreasonable?

325
00:16:58,242 --> 00:17:01,114
Sam is a member of this
family. Now give him the guitar.

326
00:17:01,114 --> 00:17:04,621
Hey, I've got an idea.
Why don't we split it?

327
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:21,432
I must apologize.

328
00:17:21,432 --> 00:17:23,996
My presence here is
clearly causing unhappiness.

329
00:17:23,996 --> 00:17:27,431
- I think I should go.
- No need to apologize.

330
00:17:27,431 --> 00:17:30,027
You have behaved with the utmost dignity

331
00:17:30,027 --> 00:17:31,917
in the face of unthinkable rudeness.

332
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:33,346
Thank you.

333
00:17:36,471 --> 00:17:38,187
Yeah, I know.

334
00:17:38,187 --> 00:17:39,431
He's the perfect son.

335
00:17:39,431 --> 00:17:42,626
Problem is, he's not yours.

336
00:17:51,607 --> 00:17:54,060
So... we talking yet?

337
00:18:02,343 --> 00:18:05,396
Jeez, Ange! What the hell?

338
00:18:05,396 --> 00:18:07,238
I'm getting bored of the silent treatment,

339
00:18:07,238 --> 00:18:08,392
so you might as well shoot me.

340
00:18:13,281 --> 00:18:16,181
- You had no right to tell her.
- I know my mom, Nick.

341
00:18:16,181 --> 00:18:17,947
There was no other way she
was letting go of Danny.

342
00:18:17,947 --> 00:18:18,947
So are we over this? Because
if not, I would really

343
00:18:21,641 --> 00:18:23,078
- prefer a bullet in my head.
- It used to be just you,

344
00:18:23,078 --> 00:18:24,417
me and Patrick knew.

345
00:18:24,417 --> 00:18:27,053
Now your mom. What if he finds out?

346
00:18:27,053 --> 00:18:30,332
- She is not gonna tell him.
- Ange, I love that boy.

347
00:18:30,332 --> 00:18:33,596
I was the one in the delivery room.

348
00:18:33,596 --> 00:18:36,404
I was the first one to
hold him, even before you.

349
00:18:36,404 --> 00:18:39,637
I know. I cannot let him
find out from somebody else.

350
00:18:39,637 --> 00:18:40,661
I have got to tell him.

351
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,897
No. You are his father.

352
00:18:42,897 --> 00:18:45,382
You gave up your life to protect him.

353
00:18:45,382 --> 00:18:47,887
You're the only father
he needs to know about.

354
00:18:52,608 --> 00:18:56,337
Yeah, maybe you're right. It's... 

355
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:01,491
Now please get this the
hell out of here, huh,

356
00:19:01,491 --> 00:19:02,670
before someone gets hurt?

357
00:19:06,047 --> 00:19:09,849
I mean, I didn't think you'd
do it, but I'm not stupid.

358
00:19:15,595 --> 00:19:18,613
- Hello?
- It's Patrick Logan. Just got into town.

359
00:19:18,613 --> 00:19:22,362
I was hoping to drop by, you
know, for the information?

360
00:19:23,224 --> 00:19:25,162
How about tomorrow night?

361
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,313
See you then.

362
00:19:27,313 --> 00:19:30,851
Oh, and I've got a case
of selective Alzheimer's,

363
00:19:30,851 --> 00:19:32,889
so don't forget the cash.

364
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:39,475
Hey, Tina. It's Susan Bremer.

365
00:19:39,475 --> 00:19:43,052
I know. It's been a long
time, not since graduation.

366
00:19:43,052 --> 00:19:44,784
So, listen, do you remember the night

367
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:46,751
that you got caught streaking,

368
00:19:46,751 --> 00:19:48,224
and I had to bail you out of jail,

369
00:19:48,224 --> 00:19:49,516
and you said you owed me one?

370
00:19:49,516 --> 00:19:52,468
Well, I hope you like chocolate.

371
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:56,875
Is that Mrs. Solis?

372
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,968
Tina, I'm gonna have to call you back.

373
00:20:05,034 --> 00:20:06,601
Oh, my God.

374
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:11,601
Is she selling candy?

375
00:20:11,667 --> 00:20:13,634
Among other things.

376
00:20:13,701 --> 00:20:16,834
I'm gonna lose this contest, aren't I?

377
00:20:16,901 --> 00:20:18,901
No. You're gonna win,

378
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:21,001
'cause mommy's done playing fair.

379
00:20:25,567 --> 00:20:28,100
Uh, Irina and I were talking,

380
00:20:28,167 --> 00:20:30,352
and we feel really bad about yesterday.

381
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,195
Look, uh, we don't wanna come
down too hard on you guys.

382
00:20:33,261 --> 00:20:35,128
We're just not comfortable

383
00:20:35,195 --> 00:20:38,427
having a couple of unmarried kids

384
00:20:38,494 --> 00:20:40,828
sleeping together in our
house. You understand.

385
00:20:40,894 --> 00:20:45,460
Oh, yes. That is why Preston
must tell you something now.

386
00:20:45,527 --> 00:20:49,228
Irina and I have decided
to get our own apartment.

387
00:20:49,295 --> 00:20:51,387
- What?
- That way it'll be our place,

388
00:20:51,388 --> 00:20:52,262
and we can do whatever we want.

389
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,154
No. No, no, no.

390
00:20:54,182 --> 00:20:56,768
We're getting married in
six months anyway. Why not?

391
00:20:56,835 --> 00:20:58,868
Why not?

392
00:20:58,935 --> 00:21:01,301
Lynette, you wanna take this one?

393
00:21:01,367 --> 00:21:05,468
I think it's a terrific idea.

394
00:21:05,534 --> 00:21:08,234
They're not kids anymore.

395
00:21:08,301 --> 00:21:10,835
They're old enough to make this decision.

396
00:21:10,901 --> 00:21:14,434
Thank you, Lynette. It's good
to know we have your support.

397
00:21:16,034 --> 00:21:18,034
- See you later.
- Okay.

398
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,034
Have fun.

399
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:24,367
What are you doing? We're...
we're supposed to pull 'em apart,

400
00:21:24,434 --> 00:21:25,332
not push 'em together.

401
00:21:25,334 --> 00:21:27,634
Do you remember that
apartment we moved into

402
00:21:27,701 --> 00:21:30,001
when we were saving for this house?

403
00:21:30,067 --> 00:21:32,334
That dump? Yeah. It was
the size of a closet.

404
00:21:32,401 --> 00:21:34,547
Uh-huh. You remember how
we treated each other?

405
00:21:34,567 --> 00:21:37,801
I remember a lot of
yelling and throwing stuff.

406
00:21:37,801 --> 00:21:41,268
God, there were a few times I
was afraid that we were gonna... 

407
00:21:41,334 --> 00:21:43,134
Break up?

408
00:21:45,867 --> 00:21:47,734
- Lynette?
- Mm-hmm.

409
00:21:47,801 --> 00:21:53,667
You are devious and evil, and I have
never been more in love with you!

410
00:21:55,767 --> 00:21:59,268
Susan Delfino, you are so busted!

411
00:21:59,334 --> 00:22:00,913
Gaby, what are you doing here?

412
00:22:01,001 --> 00:22:02,687
Alice Gibson told me what you were up to,

413
00:22:02,687 --> 00:22:05,616
but I couldn't believe
you would sink so low.

414
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:07,334
I don't know what you're talking about.

415
00:22:07,401 --> 00:22:09,501
Okay, folks. Uh, we're on a break.

416
00:22:09,568 --> 00:22:11,401
Somebody's gotta take their meds.

417
00:22:11,467 --> 00:22:13,501
No, not yet! Not yet!

418
00:22:13,568 --> 00:22:15,601
Will you stop at nothing
to win this competition?

419
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:17,668
Oh, that's funny, coming from you.

420
00:22:17,734 --> 00:22:19,868
Me? I have nothing to be ashamed of.

421
00:22:19,935 --> 00:22:20,983
Well, let me jog your memory... 

422
00:22:20,983 --> 00:22:24,100
construction site, cold wind, no bra.

423
00:22:24,167 --> 00:22:26,434
Oh, you saw that.

424
00:22:26,501 --> 00:22:30,169
Oh, yeah. Did I not tell you
how important this was to M.J.?

425
00:22:30,169 --> 00:22:31,980
Yes, and I told you about Juanita.

426
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
But apparently, your son's problems
are more important than anybody else's.

427
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,208
That is not what I'm saying.

428
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,233
Whatever. We are done here.

429
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:42,061
Oh. And just so you know,
I am taking the gloves off.

430
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:45,491
Well, why not? You've
taken off everything else.

431
00:22:45,499 --> 00:22:47,600
Candy for sale!

432
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:50,833
Help a young boy walk again.

433
00:22:55,399 --> 00:22:57,900
Hi, Katherine.

434
00:22:57,967 --> 00:23:00,433
I haven't seen you since
the party. How you doing?

435
00:23:00,499 --> 00:23:02,633
Still humiliated. Thanks for asking.

436
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,366
Oh, come on. It wasn't that bad.

437
00:23:07,366 --> 00:23:11,733
My sex life was laid bare
for the entire neighborhood.

438
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,399
What could be worse?

439
00:23:13,466 --> 00:23:17,000
Let's see. You could have thrown a
party to celebrate getting over cancer

440
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,633
and had a couple of
lesbians steal your thunder.

441
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,433
Sorry about that.

442
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,600
But it's not funny, knowing
everyone is out there judging me.

443
00:23:25,667 --> 00:23:28,767
Let me ask you somethin'.

444
00:23:28,834 --> 00:23:30,834
Do you really like this girl?

445
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,134
I don't know.

446
00:23:35,767 --> 00:23:37,400
I think I might.

447
00:23:37,467 --> 00:23:40,633
Then why do you give a damn
what anyone else thinks?

448
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,767
People just stopped seeing me
as the crazy lady on the street.

449
00:23:43,834 --> 00:23:45,344
I'm not ready for them to start seeing me

450
00:23:45,344 --> 00:23:46,826
as the middle-aged lesbian, okay?

451
00:23:47,367 --> 00:23:50,200
Well, if you care that much
about what people think,

452
00:23:50,267 --> 00:23:51,801
you've got two choices... 

453
00:23:51,867 --> 00:23:55,133
dump the girl or move someplace
where people don't gossip,

454
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,200
if such a place exists.

455
00:23:58,267 --> 00:24:00,267
It's not much of a choice.

456
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:03,233
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

457
00:24:05,167 --> 00:24:07,867
Oh. I get it.

458
00:24:07,933 --> 00:24:09,534
Thank you.

459
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,567
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Break it up.

460
00:24:12,634 --> 00:24:15,700
This is how rumors get started.

461
00:24:20,534 --> 00:24:22,734
Mmm! What smells so good?

462
00:24:22,801 --> 00:24:24,167
- That's borscht.
- Borscht!

463
00:24:24,233 --> 00:24:26,066
Irina is making dinner.

464
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:29,009
You kids have been so busy
looking for your apartment,

465
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,664
we've hardly seen you
the last couple of days.

466
00:24:30,665 --> 00:24:32,180
Yeah. You find something you like?

467
00:24:32,247 --> 00:24:35,080
Put down a deposit on a place yesterday.

468
00:24:35,147 --> 00:24:37,279
Well, ha ha!

469
00:24:37,346 --> 00:24:39,379
Don't be freaked out about the size.

470
00:24:39,446 --> 00:24:42,312
You two will have so much fun...

471
00:24:42,379 --> 00:24:44,145
That you won't even
notice how small it is.

472
00:24:44,247 --> 00:24:47,412
It's not small. Three
bedrooms and a balcony.

473
00:24:47,479 --> 00:24:51,679
How are you going to afford a 3-bedroom
apartment while you're going to college?

474
00:24:51,746 --> 00:24:54,679
You tell them. I serve borscht.

475
00:24:54,746 --> 00:24:56,980
Tell us what?

476
00:24:57,046 --> 00:24:58,646
Well, you're right.

477
00:24:58,713 --> 00:25:00,646
We can't afford anything
nice on our budget,

478
00:25:00,713 --> 00:25:03,646
so I'm gonna put off
college and get a job.

479
00:25:05,513 --> 00:25:07,846
Say... something!

480
00:25:07,913 --> 00:25:10,846
Are you sure you thought
this thing through?

481
00:25:10,913 --> 00:25:14,678
Because, you know, you need to have
a college education to get a good job.

482
00:25:14,678 --> 00:25:15,875
I already got a good job.

483
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:19,442
- You did? Where?
- The meatpacking plant. I'm a gutter.

484
00:25:19,509 --> 00:25:21,641
A gutter?

485
00:25:21,708 --> 00:25:23,121
Well, I'm the guy who scoops

486
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:25,342
- out all the...
- Yeah, yeah! I know what it is.

487
00:25:25,409 --> 00:25:28,908
Well, did you know I get paid
14 bucks an hour, plus benefits?

488
00:25:28,975 --> 00:25:31,268
Seriously? What, is it a union job?

489
00:25:31,268 --> 00:25:32,824
Those jobs are hard to get. 

490
00:25:32,824 --> 00:25:35,064
You'll probably get a
discount on steaks,too.

491
00:25:35,065 --> 00:25:38,000
Your son just announced
that he's giving up college

492
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,376
so he can be the guy in charge of guts,

493
00:25:40,376 --> 00:25:42,352
and all you can say is,
"oh, boy, free meat"?

494
00:25:42,358 --> 00:25:45,191
This is good job. The money
is a lot. What is problem?

495
00:25:45,258 --> 00:25:50,446
Maybe in Russia, it's every mother's dream

496
00:25:50,446 --> 00:25:52,224
for her son to see what the
inside of a cow looks like,

497
00:25:52,291 --> 00:25:54,191
- but not in my home!
- Lynette, calm down.

498
00:25:54,258 --> 00:25:57,591
You could be a doctor!
You could be a lawyer!

499
00:25:57,658 --> 00:26:00,992
- Why are you so intent on throwing your life away?
- Mom...

500
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,358
He is going to support his wife.

501
00:26:03,425 --> 00:26:05,725
That is what men do for women they love.

502
00:26:05,792 --> 00:26:08,258
He's not in love!

503
00:26:08,324 --> 00:26:12,125
He's blinded by a piece
of self-serving euro trash

504
00:26:12,191 --> 00:26:16,425
who would sell her own mother
for a pair of designer jeans!

505
00:26:39,425 --> 00:26:40,792
Thanks.

506
00:26:40,858 --> 00:26:43,692
- What's with the bike?
- Eddie thinks he can get me

507
00:26:43,758 --> 00:26:45,792
a couple of shifts
down at the coffee shop.

508
00:26:45,858 --> 00:26:48,992
And since you guys are too
cheap to buy me a car... 

509
00:26:49,059 --> 00:26:50,625
Your first job.

510
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:53,092
Hey, look at you.

511
00:26:55,591 --> 00:26:57,558
What happened to my little boy?

512
00:26:57,625 --> 00:27:00,425
I grew up. That's kinda the way it works.

513
00:27:00,491 --> 00:27:02,758
No, I know. I know. It's just... 

514
00:27:02,825 --> 00:27:04,825
God.

515
00:27:04,892 --> 00:27:07,825
You never think it's gonna
go as fast as it does.

516
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:09,588
You... you're so busy just
getting through the day.

517
00:27:09,588 --> 00:27:14,491
You don't realize they're,
uh, starting to add up.

518
00:27:16,792 --> 00:27:18,324
What's wrong?

519
00:27:18,391 --> 00:27:21,025
- What? What do you mean?
- Mm, you got that look

520
00:27:21,092 --> 00:27:23,958
that says... "I got somethin' to tell
you, and it ain't gonna be pretty."

521
00:27:24,025 --> 00:27:27,491
Yeah, well, you know me, right?

522
00:27:27,558 --> 00:27:30,125
Of course I do. You're my dad.

523
00:27:34,358 --> 00:27:36,972
So what's up?

524
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:43,324
You're right. I am your dad.

525
00:27:43,391 --> 00:27:45,525
Huh?

526
00:27:47,692 --> 00:27:50,291
No. Forget about it.

527
00:27:50,358 --> 00:27:52,525
Work on your bike.

528
00:27:56,291 --> 00:27:58,758
Congrats on the job.

529
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,400
Who is it?

530
00:28:07,467 --> 00:28:09,667
Patrick Logan.

531
00:28:14,033 --> 00:28:15,933
Hope you like roses.

532
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:25,266
I'm sorry I couldn't get
an address or anything.

533
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:27,667
You got me everything I needed. Good.

534
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:32,567
So... then I guess... 

535
00:28:34,899 --> 00:28:36,467
Of course.

536
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,633
I know you... been looking
for Angie for a long time,

537
00:28:47,634 --> 00:28:50,601
but, uh, there's not gonna
be any trouble, right?

538
00:28:50,667 --> 00:28:52,634
Trouble?

539
00:28:52,701 --> 00:28:55,501
Well, you're not gonna,
like, hurt her or anything?

540
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:58,701
She took something of
mine. I want it back.

541
00:28:58,767 --> 00:29:01,934
Okay.

542
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,667
I... it's just... I like Rose,

543
00:29:04,734 --> 00:29:06,634
and I don't ever want to hear

544
00:29:06,701 --> 00:29:08,968
that something bad's happened to her kid.

545
00:29:12,434 --> 00:29:14,868
You should get that money to the bank.

546
00:29:14,934 --> 00:29:17,200
This place doesn't seem very safe to me.

547
00:29:17,267 --> 00:29:20,267
What are you talking about?
Look at all those locks.

548
00:29:22,434 --> 00:29:25,334
But what if someone were
to come up this fire escape?

549
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,033
Oh, that window's always locked.

550
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,901
You think that's gonna stop them?

551
00:29:38,701 --> 00:29:40,501
What are you doing?!

552
00:29:40,567 --> 00:29:44,135
Then they reach through,
unlock the window... 

553
00:29:47,851 --> 00:29:49,622
And now you're in trouble.

554
00:29:54,068 --> 00:29:56,901
May I speak to you?

555
00:29:56,968 --> 00:30:00,200
How will this conversation end?
With beef stroganoff on my head?

556
00:30:00,267 --> 00:30:01,901
I am sorry.

557
00:30:01,968 --> 00:30:03,601
Please to forgive.

558
00:30:03,667 --> 00:30:06,300
I want us to be friends.

559
00:30:06,367 --> 00:30:06,952
Really?

560
00:30:07,067 --> 00:30:09,168
Think how hard it is for Preston,

561
00:30:09,234 --> 00:30:12,333
caught in the middle between our fighting,

562
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,834
when he wants us to love each other only.

563
00:30:14,901 --> 00:30:16,467
Yes?

564
00:30:16,534 --> 00:30:18,867
I don't want to put Preston in the middle,

565
00:30:18,934 --> 00:30:23,367
but I am his mother, and I will fight
for his best interests till the day I die.

566
00:30:23,367 --> 00:30:26,268
You mean you will fight me.

567
00:30:26,333 --> 00:30:29,433
Yeah. You understand English just fine.

568
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,500
Now you should understand.

569
00:30:32,567 --> 00:30:36,785
I told Preston I want to
move up wedding to next week,

570
00:30:36,787 --> 00:30:38,554
and he said yes.

571
00:30:38,621 --> 00:30:42,387
Next week? The wedding is
not for another six months.

572
00:30:42,454 --> 00:30:44,487
We cannot wait that long.

573
00:30:44,554 --> 00:30:48,587
It is too hard for Preston to choose
between a mother and a girlfriend,

574
00:30:48,654 --> 00:30:52,420
so once I am his wife,
choice will be much easier.

575
00:30:52,487 --> 00:30:55,220
No. No, you can't do this.

576
00:30:55,287 --> 00:30:57,120
You met each other six weeks ago.

577
00:30:57,187 --> 00:30:58,954
Preston barely knows you.

578
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,954
But you do, yes?

579
00:31:01,053 --> 00:31:03,387
You think you know all about me,

580
00:31:03,454 --> 00:31:06,821
and in much less time than that.

581
00:31:09,587 --> 00:31:10,988
There.

582
00:31:11,053 --> 00:31:14,420
From one Mrs. Scavo to another.

583
00:31:17,854 --> 00:31:21,454
I found some of your father's
old yearbooks up in the attic.

584
00:31:21,521 --> 00:31:24,020
I thought you might enjoy looking at them.

585
00:31:24,087 --> 00:31:26,020
He played football?

586
00:31:26,024 --> 00:31:29,624
Yes, and he was student body president.

587
00:31:29,691 --> 00:31:32,158
So what else can you tell me about him?

588
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,590
Even my mom didn't
really know him that well.

589
00:31:34,657 --> 00:31:37,590
He was, um,

590
00:31:37,657 --> 00:31:40,058
incredibly smart,

591
00:31:40,124 --> 00:31:41,757
funny... 

592
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:45,290
And so graceful.

593
00:31:48,424 --> 00:31:49,957
What's wrong?

594
00:31:50,024 --> 00:31:54,124
I just never get to
talk about Rex anymore.

595
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:58,257
Since I remarried, it just
doesn't seem appropriate.

596
00:31:58,323 --> 00:32:00,290
I hadn't realized... 

597
00:32:02,691 --> 00:32:04,624
How much I miss him.

598
00:32:04,691 --> 00:32:09,924
Well, you can talk to me
about him anytime you want.

599
00:32:11,824 --> 00:32:14,657
You have his smile.

600
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:26,691
What are you doing out here?

601
00:32:26,757 --> 00:32:30,158
Uh, mostly kicking myself.

602
00:32:30,223 --> 00:32:33,091
I can't believe how I acted at dinner.

603
00:32:33,158 --> 00:32:35,323
Well, it was a fraught situation.

604
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:37,824
There was bound to be some sort of scene.

605
00:32:37,891 --> 00:32:40,223
Look, I... I know he's my brother,

606
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:42,124
and I know I should try to like him,

607
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:43,724
but there's... 

608
00:32:43,791 --> 00:32:47,957
there's something about
him I just don't trust.

609
00:32:48,024 --> 00:32:51,791
- Hmm. I know what you mean.
- You do?

610
00:32:51,857 --> 00:32:54,924
He's trying awfully hard
to get close to Bree.

611
00:32:54,991 --> 00:32:57,124
I, for one, would like to know why.

612
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:59,657
You think he has an agenda?

613
00:32:59,724 --> 00:33:01,824
We all have agendas, Andrew.

614
00:33:01,891 --> 00:33:05,024
Mine is to protect your mother.

615
00:33:05,091 --> 00:33:07,557
And what do we really know about Sam?

616
00:33:07,624 --> 00:33:09,991
Just the stuff he tells us.

617
00:33:10,058 --> 00:33:13,991
It seems a bit too good
to be true, doesn't it?

618
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:19,657
Maybe... my agenda should be
to find out everything I can.

619
00:33:19,724 --> 00:33:25,058
Why shouldn't you? He's your brother.

620
00:33:25,557 --> 00:33:28,391
Hey, Jean. Quick question.

621
00:33:28,457 --> 00:33:29,837
How is M.J. doing?

622
00:33:29,838 --> 00:33:31,744
You know, I'd like to see a
little more effort in math.

623
00:33:31,744 --> 00:33:34,481
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Not in class. I
mean the candy drive. Today's the last day.

624
00:33:34,481 --> 00:33:37,289
Oh, Susan, you should be so proud.

625
00:33:37,289 --> 00:33:41,557
- He is a selling machine, way
out ahead of the whole school...
- Yes!

626
00:33:41,624 --> 00:33:43,291
Except for Juanita Solis.

627
00:33:43,357 --> 00:33:46,557
- No.
- But don't worry. She is just two bars ahead.

628
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:48,098
You better get him out there.

629
00:33:48,098 --> 00:33:50,084
Gaby Solis told me she's
taking Juanita to sell

630
00:33:50,084 --> 00:33:52,991
outside a weight loss clinic. Ka-Ching!

631
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,924
Mrs. Delfino, can I go now?

632
00:34:12,991 --> 00:34:16,724
- My mom wants to pick me up a couple minutes early.
- Does she?

633
00:34:21,691 --> 00:34:23,223
Sure, sweetheart.

634
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:26,891
Why don't you just help Vanessa
put her brushes away first?

635
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:47,557
What is that?

636
00:34:47,624 --> 00:34:52,158
Did someone bring a cell
phone into my classroom?

637
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:56,748
Juanita Solis. Is this your cell phone?

638
00:34:56,748 --> 00:34:58,025
No.

639
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:00,924
Oh, come on now. It was in your bag.

640
00:35:00,991 --> 00:35:03,158
Whose else could it be?

641
00:35:03,223 --> 00:35:06,624
Yours. My mom gave it
to you for your birthday.

642
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:12,992
So are you saying
that... that you stole it?

643
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,633
- No.
- Now you're yelling at me.

644
00:35:15,699 --> 00:35:18,133
Someone just bought herself
three hours of detention.

645
00:35:24,933 --> 00:35:26,966
Hello?

646
00:35:27,033 --> 00:35:30,933
Oh, hi, Principal Hobson. Everything okay?

647
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,467
Detention?

648
00:35:32,534 --> 00:35:35,367
No, no, no, no. We only have
a few hours left to sell candy.

649
00:35:35,434 --> 00:35:38,000
Who gave her detention?

650
00:35:38,067 --> 00:35:40,367
She did, huh?

651
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:46,267
Thanks for letting me know.

652
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:52,667
Hi, M.J.

653
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:55,633
You must be getting thirsty,
walking around in this heat.

654
00:35:55,700 --> 00:36:00,533
Doesn't a nice, big, ice-cold
cup of soda sound good?

655
00:36:24,066 --> 00:36:26,767
- Hello?
- I have something that belongs to you.

656
00:36:26,833 --> 00:36:29,366
Check your cell phone.

657
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,967
M.J.

658
00:36:36,034 --> 00:36:38,500
He's supposed to be out selling.

659
00:36:38,567 --> 00:36:40,900
He was. Then you gave
my daughter detention.

660
00:36:40,967 --> 00:36:42,400
Bad move.

661
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:44,800
All right, what do you want?

662
00:36:44,867 --> 00:36:46,800
Let her go, and I let him go.

663
00:36:46,867 --> 00:36:48,867
- I don't trust you.
- I don't blame you.

664
00:36:48,934 --> 00:36:50,700
Bring him here.

665
00:36:50,767 --> 00:36:52,433
We'll make the exchange.

666
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,533
Fine. But I'm warning you,

667
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,767
if there is one chocolate bar
missing from that girl's box,

668
00:36:57,833 --> 00:37:00,266
you'll answer to me.

669
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,967
Your mom will be here soon. Don't worry.

670
00:37:09,033 --> 00:37:12,833
You'll be out selling
your candy in no time.

671
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,134
I hope so.

672
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,800
I gotta win.

673
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:20,621
You know, Juanita, there are
other kids that want to win, too.

674
00:37:20,734 --> 00:37:22,799
I know.

675
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:25,367
I just want my mom to be proud of me.

676
00:37:25,433 --> 00:37:29,233
Your mom is proud of you.

677
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:32,534
Sometimes I think she's embarrassed
because I don't have any friends.

678
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:39,134
Every day I come home, and she asks,
"did you make any friends today?"

679
00:37:39,201 --> 00:37:42,267
Oh, she just wants to make
sure that you're happy, sweetie.

680
00:37:42,334 --> 00:37:43,935
That's all.

681
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,768
I guess.

682
00:37:46,835 --> 00:37:50,935
I just wish I could make
friends as easy as she does.

683
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,935
I try and I try, but I just can't.

684
00:37:56,434 --> 00:37:58,372
Hello. We would have gotten here sooner,

685
00:37:58,372 --> 00:37:59,796
but your son can't hold his soda.

686
00:37:59,796 --> 00:38:01,970
Juanita, come on. We got candy to sell.

687
00:38:05,068 --> 00:38:09,467
Mom, we gotta go, too. Otherwise,
Juanita's gonna beat me.

688
00:38:09,534 --> 00:38:13,534
Sweetie, um... 

689
00:38:13,601 --> 00:38:16,734
I know you want to win,

690
00:38:16,801 --> 00:38:21,300
but let's talk about
what winning really means.

691
00:38:30,001 --> 00:38:32,768
I've rehearsed this
speech a hundred times.

692
00:38:32,834 --> 00:38:36,101
Well, I think I know how it ends.

693
00:38:38,135 --> 00:38:42,601
I can't live my life with
everyone in the neighborhood

694
00:38:42,668 --> 00:38:45,934
watching me and judging me.

695
00:38:46,001 --> 00:38:49,701
I care too much about what people think.

696
00:38:51,135 --> 00:38:53,267
So you want me to leave?

697
00:38:53,334 --> 00:38:54,968
Yeah.

698
00:38:55,034 --> 00:38:57,534
Yeah.

699
00:38:57,601 --> 00:39:00,968
But if you wouldn't mind... 

700
00:39:01,034 --> 00:39:03,768
I'd like to go with you.

701
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,834
Seriously?

702
00:39:06,901 --> 00:39:14,300
I want to figure out what we
have here, and once I know...

703
00:39:14,367 --> 00:39:18,135
Maybe I won't care what anyone thinks.

704
00:39:21,235 --> 00:39:23,634
Well, you know what I think?

705
00:39:23,701 --> 00:39:26,367
What?

706
00:39:26,434 --> 00:39:30,667
I've always wanted to see Paris.

707
00:39:37,701 --> 00:39:40,801
And the winner of this
year's candy drive is... 

708
00:39:40,868 --> 00:39:42,334
Juanita Solis!

709
00:39:47,734 --> 00:39:50,901
Whoo-hoo! We did it!

710
00:39:51,968 --> 00:39:53,049
You did it.

711
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:56,533
Okay, now go invite your
brand-new friends to your party.

712
00:39:58,644 --> 00:40:00,341
Mrs. Henderson?

713
00:40:00,341 --> 00:40:01,844
Tell me. Was it close?

714
00:40:01,844 --> 00:40:04,213
Really close, until the last day,

715
00:40:04,213 --> 00:40:08,174
when Juanita sold 40 bars,
and M.J. didn't sell any.

716
00:40:08,241 --> 00:40:09,982
Really?

717
00:40:09,982 --> 00:40:12,674
That's weird.

718
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:19,241
M.J.

719
00:40:19,308 --> 00:40:21,208
I'm sorry you didn't win.

720
00:40:21,274 --> 00:40:22,874
That's okay.

721
00:40:22,941 --> 00:40:25,974
I'm curious about something.

722
00:40:26,041 --> 00:40:28,575
How come you didn't
sell any candy yesterday?

723
00:40:30,541 --> 00:40:32,607
My mom says it's a secret.

724
00:40:32,674 --> 00:40:35,541
She says it's only a good
deed if we don't tell.

725
00:40:44,607 --> 00:40:47,575
Well, you should listen to your mother... 

726
00:40:49,308 --> 00:40:53,475
Because she is a winner, just like you.

727
00:40:53,541 --> 00:40:58,740
There are a lot of ways
to win in this world.

728
00:40:58,807 --> 00:41:05,408
Some battles are won with a hasty retreat.

729
00:41:05,475 --> 00:41:09,308
Some victories are claimed... 

730
00:41:09,374 --> 00:41:12,607
by those willing to cheat.

731
00:41:12,674 --> 00:41:16,308
Some opponents are defeated... 

732
00:41:16,374 --> 00:41:18,575
with nothing more than a smile.

733
00:41:20,408 --> 00:41:23,274
Of course, for some,

734
00:41:23,341 --> 00:41:25,941
it's not enough to win.

735
00:41:26,007 --> 00:41:28,408
Someone else... 

736
00:41:28,475 --> 00:41:30,008
has got to lose.

737
00:41:30,009 --> 00:41:34,209
