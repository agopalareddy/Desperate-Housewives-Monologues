1
00:00:00,283 --> 00:00:02,390
<i>Previously on...</i>

2
00:00:02,425 --> 00:00:05,253
I booked our room at the motel...
and I don't want to be alone tonight.

3
00:00:05,288 --> 00:00:06,024
neither do I.

4
00:00:06,025 --> 00:00:07,057
<i>Affairs got serious...

5
00:00:07,058 --> 00:00:11,689
If you got hit by a bus,
I'd really miss you.</i>

6
00:00:11,724 --> 00:00:13,277
You're showering alone
tonight.

7
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:15,215
I love you.
There. I said it.

8
00:00:15,376 --> 00:00:17,376
<i>An ex-lover...
Why--wait. What are you doing?</i>

9
00:00:17,411 --> 00:00:19,937
Just letting you know
I'm here for you.

10
00:00:19,972 --> 00:00:22,464
Let's just say he was grateful--
very grateful.

11
00:00:22,499 --> 00:00:24,054
<i>Spun out of control.</i>

12
00:00:25,129 --> 00:00:26,207
You're fired.

13
00:00:26,242 --> 00:00:28,569
And when a crime
was committed...

14
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:31,119
<i>A neighbor was suspected.

15
00:00:31,154 --> 00:00:33,315
Everybody thinks I'm the perv
who attacked julie.</i>

16
00:00:33,316 --> 00:00:37,225
Just in case somebody should try to come in here and hurt you,
<i>Do you know where your father and I keep the gun?

17
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:38,499
But it was the victim...</i>

18
00:00:38,534 --> 00:00:40,519
<i>What were you thinking,
dating a married man?

19
00:00:40,554 --> 00:00:42,199
Who had secrets.</i>

20
00:00:42,234 --> 00:00:43,844
Hey, julie, I miss you.

21
00:00:50,152 --> 00:00:53,829
it is in our nature to judge 
the people around us.

22
00:00:55,665 --> 00:00:58,341
<i>We judge the way strangers dress.</i>

23
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,233
<i>The way our neighbors
tend their lawns...</i>

24
00:01:06,995 --> 00:01:08,416
<i>And the way
our friends

25
00:01:08,451 --> 00:01:09,838
act in public.</i>

26
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,770
<i>Yes, we make these judgments
all the time,</i>

27
00:01:16,067 --> 00:01:18,450
<i>Never thinking that one day</i>

28
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:20,718
<i>We may be judged...</i>

29
00:01:20,753 --> 00:01:22,596
<i>Ourselves.</i>

30
00:01:29,178 --> 00:01:30,376
Girls, what are you doing?

31
00:01:31,555 --> 00:01:33,011
Oh, for pete's sake.
My arm.

32
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:36,578
What did I tell you about
sliding down the staircase?

33
00:01:36,767 --> 00:01:40,709
Not to use the good suitcase?
Besides that. Don't do it at all!

34
00:01:41,577 --> 00:01:43,218
Well, what are we
supposed to do?

35
00:01:43,253 --> 00:01:45,231
You won't let us play
on the roof anymore.

36
00:01:46,602 --> 00:01:50,055
oh, crap. hey, laura!
What happened?

37
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:53,166
don't worry. She's okay.
These two knuckleheads decided


38
00:01:53,201 --> 00:01:56,847
to slide down the staircase.
Why would you let them do that?

39
00:01:56,882 --> 00:02:00,493
Oh, don't blame me. I wasn't even in the room.
You left the girls unsupervised?

40
00:02:01,136 --> 00:02:02,969
Well, they were playing.

41
00:02:03,311 --> 00:02:05,806
Come on. I can't watch 'em every second.
Why not?

42
00:02:05,841 --> 00:02:09,548
I look after juanita when she's at my house,
And she goes home without a scratch.

43
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:11,663
only 'cause
she's indestructible.

44
00:02:12,079 --> 00:02:14,146
Honey, do that thing
where you run into the wall.

45
00:02:14,181 --> 00:02:15,424
Watch. This is hilarious.

46
00:02:16,426 --> 00:02:17,665
You're pretty cavalier

47
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,338
Considering your carelessness
almost killed my daughter.

48
00:02:26,018 --> 00:02:28,922
I gotta say, laura, 
You're kind of a wet blanket

49
00:02:28,957 --> 00:02:31,363
since you quit smoking.
Why don't you try a pipe?

50
00:02:32,105 --> 00:02:36,625
And I've got to say, gaby, I think
you're a lousy mother.

51
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,350
Did you just say that to my face? 
Yes, and I'm afraid I won't be bringing
my daughter here anymore.

52
00:02:42,385 --> 00:02:46,204
The safety and well-being
of my child must come first.

53
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,024
Fine. Juanita only had rachel over
because she felt sorry for her.

54
00:02:50,059 --> 00:02:51,831
It was a pity playdate.

55
00:02:52,582 --> 00:02:54,507
And of course this means Rachel 

56
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:56,615
won't be attending
juanita's birthday party.

57
00:02:58,171 --> 00:03:00,428
More cake for us!

58
00:03:00,463 --> 00:03:02,686
Beat it!
Let's go, sweetie.

59
00:03:03,721 --> 00:03:08,188
<i>Yes, it's in our nature
to judge those around us.</i>

60
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,911
<i>It's also in our nature...</i>

61
00:03:10,946 --> 00:03:13,457
You know, if you had taught your kid
How to tuck and roll on impact,

62
00:03:13,492 --> 00:03:15,637
We wouldn't even be having
this conversation!

63
00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:19,297
<i>To blame someone else
for our mistakes.</i>

67
00:03:32,108 --> 00:03:36,610
<i>It had been two weeks since julie mayer
had been attacked.</i>

68
00:03:37,794 --> 00:03:40,511
<i>And when she came home
from the hospital,</i>

69
00:03:40,808 --> 00:03:43,426
<i>The residents of wisteria lane
were there

70
00:03:43,461 --> 00:03:45,539
to welcome her back.</i>

71
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:48,371
<i>She was greeted by children

72
00:03:48,406 --> 00:03:50,232
who came with signs...</i>

73
00:03:52,538 --> 00:03:55,363
<i>Housewives who came
with desserts...</i>

74
00:03:56,551 --> 00:03:58,210
<i>And old friends</i>

75
00:03:58,764 --> 00:04:00,510
<i>Who came with flowers.</i>

76
00:04:03,292 --> 00:04:06,305
<i>Also in the crowd
was a new friend...</i>

77
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,683
<i>Who came with an agenda.</i>

78
00:04:11,825 --> 00:04:14,561
I'm so glad you guys came.

79
00:04:15,105 --> 00:04:15,903
See you later.
Bye!

80
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:26,347
Hey, julie.
Welcome home.

81
00:04:30,224 --> 00:04:33,799
Listen, I've been so worried about you.
Is there someplace we can go

82
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,399
where we can talk?
No. We're not doing this anymore.

83
00:04:39,366 --> 00:04:43,224
<i>Julie, please.</i>
Dominick, I'm sorry.

84
00:04:43,225 --> 00:04:44,124
It's over.

85
00:04:46,325 --> 00:04:48,299
Hey, mrs. Mccluskey!

86
00:05:00,094 --> 00:05:03,142
bree.
Oh, hi.

87
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:05,784
I am so sorry I'm late.
I have three parties

88
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:08,604
this weekend,
And I'm up to my elbows in canapés.

89
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,390
Why isn't katherine helping you?
I had to let her go.

90
00:05:11,425 --> 00:05:12,615
What?
you're kidding.

91
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:16,163
We were working this event,
and she went berserk.

92
00:05:16,198 --> 00:05:19,676
And then when I fired her,
She intentionally scratched my car.

93
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:23,559
Wow. I flipped her the bird
the other day after she cut me off.

94
00:05:23,594 --> 00:05:26,276
Won't make that mistake again.
I think she needs help.

95
00:05:26,311 --> 00:05:28,958
I think she's a drama queen.
But if she is in trouble,

96
00:05:28,993 --> 00:05:31,779
and we don't do anything,
It could be mary alice all over again.

97
00:05:32,549 --> 00:05:34,553
I don't know.
Susan, what do you think?

98
00:05:34,739 --> 00:05:38,973
Well, I know she's going through a rough time, 
but I have trouble feeling sorry for her.

99
00:05:39,008 --> 00:05:41,058
I get that, after that stunt
she pulled at your wedding.

100
00:05:41,163 --> 00:05:44,647
And did you tell them about
katherine hitting on mike?

101
00:05:44,726 --> 00:05:47,119
What?
When did that happen?

102
00:05:53,404 --> 00:05:55,271
He--he did mention it,
didn't he?

103
00:05:55,902 --> 00:05:57,702
Of course. Yeah.

104
00:05:57,893 --> 00:06:00,318
Um, we laugh
about it all the time.

105
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:04,190
um, oh,
and look. There's mike now,

106
00:06:04,191 --> 00:06:07,090
And I could use a good laugh.
Would you excuse me?

107
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,228
Sweetie, can I talk to you
a second?

108
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,982
If it was no big deal,
why didn't you just tell me?

109
00:06:15,017 --> 00:06:17,491
Julie was in the hospital.
I didn't tell you

110
00:06:17,526 --> 00:06:19,965
Because I, crazy me,
thought it might upset you.

111
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,897
And here's why I'm upset--
'cause now I realize

112
00:06:21,932 --> 00:06:23,759
that katherine is not hurting.

113
00:06:23,794 --> 00:06:28,023
She's plotting. So I'm gonna go over there right now--
No, susan, you do not want to pour gasoline on this fire.

114
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,843
Well, you're right. I wanna
pour gasoline on katherine.

115
00:06:31,046 --> 00:06:33,435
And if you love me at all, 
You'll give me a match and an alibi.

116
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,825
Honey, let her have her lies.
Let her plot.

117
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,621
Oh, you got nothing
to worry about.

118
00:06:38,176 --> 00:06:41,810
You mean everything to me,
and katherine means nothing.

119
00:06:42,763 --> 00:06:44,075
Well, that's sweet.

120
00:06:46,158 --> 00:06:48,614
I'm gonna go tell her you said that.
Get back here.

121
00:06:55,201 --> 00:06:58,545
Hey. Wanna talk about it?

122
00:06:59,017 --> 00:07:01,205
Yeah, sure. Let's--let's have
a nice father/son chat

123
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,920
About how
you're cheatin' on mom.

124
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,375
Do you know
how stupid I felt?

125
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,217
I got into a huge fight with julie
'cause I thought she was lying to me,

126
00:07:11,252 --> 00:07:13,894
That she was just telling me she
had a boyfriend to blow me off.

127
00:07:14,592 --> 00:07:18,843
And I followed her home, and...
<i>It turns out she does have a boyfriend-

128
00:07:18,878 --> 00:07:19,936
-you.</i>

129
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:22,763
I'm sorry.

130
00:07:24,266 --> 00:07:27,640
<i>And for what it's worth,
it's over.</i>

131
00:07:28,908 --> 00:07:31,858
If I ever see
you two together again...

132
00:07:34,178 --> 00:07:35,415
I'm gonna tell mom.

133
00:07:41,019 --> 00:07:42,387
You wanna tell your mother?

134
00:07:42,915 --> 00:07:45,938
Yeah, come on. Let's go right now.
Come on.

135
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:48,439
What?

136
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:51,310
You think you can dangle
that ax over my head?

137
00:07:52,033 --> 00:07:53,499
Then go for it.

138
00:07:54,733 --> 00:07:59,412
So you want mom to know?
You want to destroy her life?

139
00:07:59,608 --> 00:08:02,813
Your mom finding out that I had
an affair won't destroy her.

140
00:08:03,246 --> 00:08:05,962
<i>Her finding out that you knew
about it? Yeah, that will.</i>

141
00:08:05,997 --> 00:08:07,418
<i>Yeah, I'm the bad guy.</i>

142
00:08:09,677 --> 00:08:12,040
You think your mom's
the perfect one in this marriage?

143
00:08:14,437 --> 00:08:17,548
There you two are. 
They're bringing out a cake for julie.

144
00:08:21,713 --> 00:08:22,843
Everything okay out here?

145
00:08:24,979 --> 00:08:26,185
Yeah.

146
00:08:28,064 --> 00:08:30,196
Just having
a little father/son chat.

147
00:08:30,231 --> 00:08:31,862
That's my boys.

148
00:08:32,195 --> 00:08:33,862
Oh, come on.
They're cuttin' the cake.

149
00:08:52,591 --> 00:08:56,147
come in! Hey, karen.
Lynette,

150
00:08:56,182 --> 00:08:59,733
when you've needed a favor from me,
Have I ever let you down?

151
00:08:59,766 --> 00:09:01,955
Last month we needed
a sitter for penny,

152
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:04,145
But you didn't want to miss
oktoberfest.

153
00:09:04,664 --> 00:09:06,096
And just last Thursday--
okay, new way in.

154
00:09:06,511 --> 00:09:09,494
I got a problem with roy.
He's been kinda down lately.

155
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:12,885
Oh, what's wrong?
He lives on a fixed income and he can't afford

156
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,116
to pay for nice dinners. But when I pay, he sulks.

157
00:09:16,151 --> 00:09:17,351
He says I'm "keeping" him.

158
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:21,154
Hell, at his age, he should be glad
to have something keeping him

159
00:09:21,189 --> 00:09:23,070
besides formaldehyde.
You know what I mean?

160
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:25,090
And the favor would be?

161
00:09:25,091 --> 00:09:29,326
Well, I was thinking maybe you and tom
Could hire him

162
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:31,407
for a few hours
a week as a handyman.

163
00:09:31,442 --> 00:09:34,350
You know, so he'd have
a little walking around money.

164
00:09:35,913 --> 00:09:37,124
Gee, I don't know.

165
00:09:37,921 --> 00:09:39,675
Okay, girl talk time.

166
00:09:40,784 --> 00:09:44,530
When roy's spirits are drooping,
the problem is global.

167
00:09:44,565 --> 00:09:48,028
You get the picture?
Getting the picture isn't the problem.

168
00:09:48,063 --> 00:09:49,287
It's getting rid of it.

169
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:53,423
Oh, come on. Try him for one week.
I'm only hesitant because he's your boyfriend,

170
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:56,416
And I'd hate to risk
straining a good friendship.

171
00:09:56,733 --> 00:10:00,064
Well, if I were that good a friend,
Would I be putting you in this awkward position?

172
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:03,024
excellent point.

173
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,592
He's hired.
Thanks. You'll never know

174
00:10:06,627 --> 00:10:08,603
what you've done for my sex life.

175
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,222
Good.

176
00:10:21,898 --> 00:10:24,266
I love it that you do that.
What?

177
00:10:24,705 --> 00:10:27,981
When I first brought you here,
You didn't want to set foot in this room.

178
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,040
And now you get sad
every time we have to leave.

179
00:10:31,311 --> 00:10:34,587
well,
it's now our place.

180
00:10:35,069 --> 00:10:37,797
It's not what I would've chosen,
but it's growing on me.

181
00:10:42,302 --> 00:10:44,676
I'm sorry.
I thought you checked out.

182
00:10:45,431 --> 00:10:46,963
it's okay.
We're just going.

183
00:10:46,998 --> 00:10:49,684
Tip's on the dresser.
Thank you, sir.

184
00:10:57,102 --> 00:11:01,514
Excuse me. Um, I seem to have lost
an earring--a little pearl stud.

185
00:11:01,549 --> 00:11:04,882
Oh. I can help you look for it.
Thank you.

186
00:11:06,829 --> 00:11:08,285
hello?

187
00:11:09,891 --> 00:11:11,293
Oh, hi, orson.

188
00:11:12,334 --> 00:11:15,626
No, I told you your gray suit
is at the tailor's.

189
00:11:16,053 --> 00:11:17,087
Where am I now?

190
00:11:18,781 --> 00:11:21,654
Oh, at the supermarket
getting us something for dinner.

191
00:11:23,013 --> 00:11:25,169
Oh, you already did
all the shopping? Well, great.

192
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:28,676
I will just put all this food
away and come straight home.

193
00:11:28,711 --> 00:11:29,850
Bye.

194
00:11:31,701 --> 00:11:34,997
Found it.
It was buried in the sheets.

195
00:11:35,032 --> 00:11:37,462
Thank you very much. Let me
get you a little something.

196
00:11:40,657 --> 00:11:42,627
Oh, my wallet's here
somewhere.

197
00:11:43,179 --> 00:11:45,554
That's all right. I'm sure you're eager

198
00:11:45,589 --> 00:11:47,588
to get home to your husband

199
00:11:58,398 --> 00:12:01,196
Oh, okay. Well,
thanks for letting me know.

200
00:12:03,171 --> 00:12:06,513
What's wrong?
Heidi bremer just informed me

201
00:12:06,548 --> 00:12:08,134
her kid can't come on Saturday.

202
00:12:08,169 --> 00:12:10,808
She and don are going to the nursing home
To visit his mother.

203
00:12:11,608 --> 00:12:14,213
So why are you mad?
Because it's a lie!

204
00:12:14,248 --> 00:12:15,408
Heidi hates his mother!

205
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,949
She wouldn't cross the street
to visit that drooling fossil.

206
00:12:18,241 --> 00:12:21,779
And that's the third cancellation I've gotten today,
And every excuse has been a crock.

207
00:12:22,255 --> 00:12:27,422
Why would people lie to get out of a kid's party?
Because laura miller's out there spreading her poison.

208
00:12:27,457 --> 00:12:28,857
She's telling every woman
in the p.T.A.

209
00:12:29,104 --> 00:12:30,826
Their kids aren't safe
in my house.

210
00:12:31,237 --> 00:12:33,907
Those hausfrau cronies of hers
are lapping it up.

211
00:12:33,942 --> 00:12:36,503
Juanita will be heartbroken
if no one comes to her party.

212
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:39,956
Oh, no, no, no, no. They'll come.
We just have to build it, that's all.

213
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,872
This is about to cost me money,
isn't it?

214
00:12:44,385 --> 00:12:47,543
Carlos, there are women out there
Who think I'm a bad mother.

215
00:12:47,578 --> 00:12:50,406
It is your job to support me. 
Now just shut up and fork over some cash.

216
00:12:51,983 --> 00:12:55,444
Wouldn't it be easier to just
watch the kids while they play?

217
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,324
Did you just say that
to my face?

218
00:13:00,195 --> 00:13:02,722
Here.
Take the whole wallet.

219
00:13:07,425 --> 00:13:10,283
Voilà. Grilled langoustine.

220
00:13:10,318 --> 00:13:12,935
Your favorite.
How very thoughtful of you, orson.

221
00:13:13,315 --> 00:13:15,041
Well, they weren't easy
to find.

222
00:13:15,475 --> 00:13:18,005
The man at one store
tried to sell me shrimp.

223
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:21,534
And when I tried to explain the difference,
He gave me an argument.

224
00:13:21,727 --> 00:13:24,414
What is it with service people
these days?

225
00:13:24,449 --> 00:13:27,153
They used to be polite
and deferential.

226
00:13:27,188 --> 00:13:30,700
Now they just sneer
right in your face. It's intolerable.

227
00:13:30,735 --> 00:13:33,646
Well, I wouldn't let it spoil
a nice dinner.

228
00:13:33,681 --> 00:13:36,557
Sorry, I had a very irksome
encounter myself today.

229
00:13:37,222 --> 00:13:41,428
Really? Where?
At a... Café.

230
00:13:43,472 --> 00:13:48,537
I was having lunch,
And this waitress was rude and superior.

231
00:13:48,572 --> 00:13:52,108
<i>Superior? To you?</i>
Well, you should've whipped out

232
00:13:52,143 --> 00:13:53,641
A copy of your best-selling cookbook,

233
00:13:53,676 --> 00:13:55,891
Like you did last week
in the food court at the mall.

234
00:13:56,013 --> 00:14:00,416
Well, I doubt this woman would've been impressed.
Really? Well, you sure put

235
00:14:00,451 --> 00:14:01,655
that pretzel vendor in his place.

236
00:14:01,824 --> 00:14:04,512
I was so startled,
I didn't know what to say.

237
00:14:04,634 --> 00:14:07,934
I just let it go.
Well, is this a café you frequent often?

238
00:14:09,502 --> 00:14:10,999
As often as I can.

239
00:14:11,543 --> 00:14:14,998
Well, next time you're in there,
I think you should clear the air.

240
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,248
Demand a little courtesy.

241
00:14:16,524 --> 00:14:19,123
Thank you, orson.
I think I may do that tomorrow.

242
00:14:21,782 --> 00:14:24,170
This is nice, isn't it?
Sharing a meal,

243
00:14:24,205 --> 00:14:25,801
talking about our days.

244
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:29,142
Why don't you pass
on that café tomorrow

245
00:14:29,177 --> 00:14:32,016
And let me make you
a nice salad or an omelet?

246
00:14:32,558 --> 00:14:35,295
Thank you, dear,
But tomorrow I'm planning

247
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:37,473
on having something a bit spicier.

248
00:14:39,282 --> 00:14:42,603
- Lynette. - Yeah?
- Look what roy did.

249
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:45,389
Open. Closed. Open! Closed!

250
00:14:45,424 --> 00:14:47,570
We don't need to use
that spatula anymore!

251
00:14:47,785 --> 00:14:52,206
that's great! So, roy, since you're so ingenious,
How about you build

252
00:14:52,241 --> 00:14:55,480
some flower boxes 
For our bedroom windows?

253
00:14:55,515 --> 00:14:58,719
Well, our window if you want,
but not the kids'.

254
00:14:58,754 --> 00:15:00,805
Why not?
'cause they'll never water 'em.

255
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,799
Oh, I'll remind them.
They can't keep a goldfish alive

256
00:15:03,834 --> 00:15:06,804
for more than one day. What makes you think
They're gonna take better care of geraniums?

257
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,992
I don't know. I just know
we're getting flower boxes.

258
00:15:11,449 --> 00:15:14,210
So, roy, you could go ahead
and get those started.

259
00:15:15,724 --> 00:15:18,023
<i>Are you good with this,
mr. Scavo?</i>

260
00:15:19,724 --> 00:15:21,956
Sure. What the hell.
Okay.

261
00:15:21,957 --> 00:15:24,765
I'll go measure the windows.
Thanks, roy.

262
00:15:28,645 --> 00:15:30,445
What was that?
What?

263
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,560
He just went over my head
to you.

264
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:35,286
I knew I liked that guy
the minute he walked in.

265
00:15:36,588 --> 00:15:41,461
Look! Open. Closed.
Open! Closed!

266
00:15:48,716 --> 00:15:51,665
Hi, laura, kirstin, heidi.

267
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,716
hi.
Gabrielle.

268
00:15:53,175 --> 00:15:56,389
I'm glad you're here, laura.
I wanted to apologize.

269
00:15:56,424 --> 00:15:59,603
Things got a little heated the other day,
And I think we both said some things we didn't mean.

270
00:15:59,638 --> 00:16:01,011
I appreciate that, gabrielle.

271
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:02,901
Good. Well...

272
00:16:04,954 --> 00:16:07,657
Now that that's behind us,
If rachel would like to come

273
00:16:07,692 --> 00:16:10,360
to juanita's birthday party,
We'd love to have her.

274
00:16:10,707 --> 00:16:13,655
Sorry, but I'm still not
comfortable with that.

275
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:16,604
Oh, that's a shame. 
We're gonna have face painting

276
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:19,613
and a cotton candy machine...

277
00:16:19,648 --> 00:16:22,318
and a clown.
A clown?! Where's a clown?!

278
00:16:22,737 --> 00:16:23,939
Oh, not here, sweetie.

279
00:16:23,974 --> 00:16:26,336
He'll be
at juanita's birthday party

280
00:16:26,371 --> 00:16:28,180
On Saturday--the one your mommy
won't let you go to.

281
00:16:28,413 --> 00:16:31,424
I wanna go!
Rachel, we'll talk about it later.

282
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:35,163
What are you doing, gaby?

283
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:37,980
Oh, I'm sorry. She asked me
a question. I just answered it.

284
00:16:38,015 --> 00:16:41,695
For example, if she were to ask me
If we were having a bouncy house,

285
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:44,537
I'd have to say, 
"just the biggest bouncy house

286
00:16:44,572 --> 00:16:46,141
you've ever seen!"

287
00:16:46,176 --> 00:16:47,710
Oh, a bouncy house! I love bouncy houses!
yeah, I want--

288
00:16:48,016 --> 00:16:50,611
Is the clown gonna
be in the bouncy house?

289
00:16:50,646 --> 00:16:53,207
Maybe,
but you'll never know.

290
00:16:54,245 --> 00:16:56,047
Gabrielle, please.

291
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:58,670
You're right. I'm sorry.
This is cruel.

292
00:16:58,705 --> 00:17:01,259
Come on, juanita.
We gotta buy bananas.

293
00:17:01,674 --> 00:17:04,003
The people at your party are gonna 
want something to feed the monkey.

294
00:17:04,238 --> 00:17:06,751
A monkey?!
Mommy!

295
00:17:10,366 --> 00:17:12,331
I wanna go! pretty please!

296
00:17:18,231 --> 00:17:19,564
Excuse me?

297
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:23,964
Did you need something in your room?
Ah, no, I'm not checked in.

298
00:17:23,965 --> 00:17:29,241
I came here to see you.
I don't have any weed, lady.

299
00:17:29,276 --> 00:17:31,757
Sorry?
All you ladies

300
00:17:31,792 --> 00:17:34,202
with the nice cars thinks anyone who
talks like this

301
00:17:34,237 --> 00:17:37,886
must have ganja to sell.
I am not here to buy ganja.

302
00:17:38,282 --> 00:17:41,770
I came about yesterday. I appreciated you
finding my earring,

303
00:17:41,805 --> 00:17:43,149
But I didn't care
for your attitude.

304
00:17:45,003 --> 00:17:49,568
It was very insulting.
Did I say one cross word to you?

305
00:17:49,603 --> 00:17:52,620
You didn't need to.
Your disdain was perfectly clear

306
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:54,171
from the look you gave me.

307
00:17:55,299 --> 00:17:56,709
And there is it again.

308
00:17:58,107 --> 00:18:00,568
I have 12 rooms to do.
I don't have time to argue.

309
00:18:00,603 --> 00:18:02,496
Fine. Then I'll help.

310
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,314
Lady, please.

311
00:18:08,315 --> 00:18:09,580
I won't look at you
no more, okay?

312
00:18:09,581 --> 00:18:13,085
I'm just saying you shouldn't make
snap judgments about people.

313
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:17,450
You see I'm having an affair,
And you just assume I'm a bad person...

314
00:18:17,485 --> 00:18:18,979
And a dope fiend.

315
00:18:19,356 --> 00:18:21,555
If you knew more
about my marriage,

316
00:18:21,556 --> 00:18:23,789
You'd see me
very differently.

317
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:27,564
I don't need to know
about your marriage.

318
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:31,030
If you're going to form opinions
about it, then yes, you do.

319
00:18:31,031 --> 00:18:33,772
My husband is
a controlling ex-con.

320
00:18:33,773 --> 00:18:37,436
I've begged him for a divorce,
but he won't let me go.

321
00:18:37,471 --> 00:18:38,893
I'm practically his prisoner.

322
00:18:38,928 --> 00:18:40,422
Your husband's a good man.

323
00:18:40,457 --> 00:18:42,114
You know nothing about him.

324
00:18:42,115 --> 00:18:44,180
I know he does your shopping
for you.

325
00:18:45,843 --> 00:18:47,966
When you lied to him
on the phone,

326
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:50,589
Told him you were at the grocery store.
He said he already went.

327
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,755
And your point is?
You know what I would give

328
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:55,022
To have a man
do my shopping for me,

329
00:18:55,023 --> 00:18:59,082
Make my life a little bit easier?
And you're not even grateful.

330
00:18:59,422 --> 00:19:02,575
You're just sneaking off here
To do the nasty with your boyfriend.

331
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:03,897
Who are you to judge me?

332
00:19:03,898 --> 00:19:06,794
You can't even make
hospital corners!

333
00:19:06,829 --> 00:19:07,833
What do you want me to say,
lady, huh?

334
00:19:07,868 --> 00:19:10,973
That cheating's not a sin
when you do it in pearls?

335
00:19:13,053 --> 00:19:15,103
Now unless you want to start on
the toilet, 

336
00:19:15,138 --> 00:19:16,871
I think we're done.

337
00:19:31,023 --> 00:19:33,630
These flower boxes
are really coming along.

338
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:35,764
If you have a moment--
no rush--

339
00:19:35,765 --> 00:19:37,797
Would you hang this birdhouse
for me?

340
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:39,764
I was thinking
on that big tree.

341
00:19:39,765 --> 00:19:41,672
You got it.
Oh, thanks.

342
00:19:43,706 --> 00:19:46,539
Roy?

343
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,705
Over there. That tree.
Yeah,

344
00:19:47,706 --> 00:19:52,634
I was talking to tom about it 
this morning, and, he wants it over here.

345
00:19:52,669 --> 00:19:55,601
Okay, well, that's probably because
he forgot

346
00:19:55,636 --> 00:19:57,719
the sprinklers
go off over there.

347
00:19:57,754 --> 00:20:00,965
So do me a favor
and hang it in that tree.

348
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,383
Thank you.

349
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,481
'cause she's telling me she wants it
on the other side of the yard.

350
00:20:18,806 --> 00:20:20,646
Roy?
Gotta go.

351
00:20:21,676 --> 00:20:23,612
Boy, you're everywhere.

352
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,371
We should get you a bell.

353
00:20:25,564 --> 00:20:27,978
Why you calling tom?
To make sure he's okay

354
00:20:28,013 --> 00:20:30,393
with where you wanna hang this thing.

355
00:20:30,428 --> 00:20:32,897
I mean, he is
the man of the house.

356
00:20:33,302 --> 00:20:36,426
<i>Okay, I know,
since you're using a cell phone,</i>

357
00:20:36,461 --> 00:20:38,046
You know what century it is,

358
00:20:38,081 --> 00:20:41,203
but just to clarify, you don't have 
to keep checking with tom.

359
00:20:41,238 --> 00:20:44,611
I make plenty of decisions around here.
I noticed.

360
00:20:44,646 --> 00:20:48,113
I just prefer to treat the guy
with a little respect.

361
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:51,121
Excuse me?
Just 'cause you like

362
00:20:51,156 --> 00:20:53,522
crunching his walnuts doesn't mean I do.

363
00:20:53,929 --> 00:20:57,950
I beg your pardon! His walnuts
are completely intact!

364
00:20:57,985 --> 00:21:01,090
And you know what? I think
we are done here. You can go.

365
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:03,878
Fine. Soon as I hang
this birdhouse.

366
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:07,152
Oh, and he said he doesn't care 
where it is, so you win...

367
00:21:07,187 --> 00:21:09,945
Again.
This isn't about winning!

368
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:13,005
And I just fired you,
so you can go home.

369
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,815
No. I promised tom I'd do this,
and I'm doing it.

370
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:17,944
You know--

371
00:21:25,164 --> 00:21:28,291
I'd clean that up,
but you just fired me.

372
00:21:41,648 --> 00:21:43,589
oh, my god! I'm so sorry.

373
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:46,422
Oh! I thought you saw me.
No. Uh, no.

374
00:21:46,423 --> 00:21:51,597
No, it's--it's okay.
I was just...

375
00:21:51,598 --> 00:21:53,130
Yeah, I shoulda realized.
I'm sorry.

376
00:21:55,265 --> 00:21:57,798
I guess you heard

377
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,936
that after it happened,
Some people thought that--

378
00:21:59,971 --> 00:22:02,776
Oh, um... I know
it wasn't you, danny.

379
00:22:08,263 --> 00:22:10,526
Hey, that night we argued,
you said you were seeing a guy.

380
00:22:14,034 --> 00:22:15,879
You think maybe he had
something to do with it?

381
00:22:17,017 --> 00:22:18,272
Um, I thought about it,

382
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:19,616
but no.

383
00:22:19,959 --> 00:22:21,934
He's not that kind of guy.

384
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:26,256
So you have no idea?
I wish I did.

385
00:22:26,684 --> 00:22:28,326
I haven't been able
to sleep.

386
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:31,037
Every time I'm about
to close my eyes,

387
00:22:31,606 --> 00:22:33,602
I'm afraid he'll be there
when I wake up.

388
00:22:34,384 --> 00:22:35,516
You know what?

389
00:22:37,904 --> 00:22:40,254
I think I might
have something to help.

390
00:22:55,387 --> 00:22:57,712
Thank you, all,
for volunteering.

391
00:22:57,747 --> 00:23:00,509
Here's the thing. Whoever attacked julie
is still out there,

392
00:23:00,544 --> 00:23:03,082
So it's up to us to look out
for each other,

393
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:05,607
Which is where
the neighbor watch comes in.

394
00:23:07,506 --> 00:23:09,484
So susan's gonna talk to you
about patrol duty.

395
00:23:09,573 --> 00:23:10,506
Susan?

396
00:23:15,515 --> 00:23:16,468
Susan?

397
00:23:23,503 --> 00:23:25,958
Uh, what is she patrolling for?
His tonsils?

398
00:23:31,516 --> 00:23:34,569
Um, we still need people for
9:00 to midnight on Thursday.

399
00:23:34,604 --> 00:23:35,781
Any volunteers?

400
00:23:38,975 --> 00:23:40,582
"project runway."

401
00:23:43,992 --> 00:23:46,307
Uh, okay,
we have, uh, mona clarke...

402
00:23:48,429 --> 00:23:50,976
And irma pritchet.

403
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:54,386
No one else?

404
00:23:57,166 --> 00:23:58,612
Okay, meeting adjourned.

405
00:24:00,233 --> 00:24:02,246
There's coffee
back in the kitchen.

406
00:24:06,714 --> 00:24:09,906
Uh, mrs. Pritchet's got clogged shower drain,
and I promised I'd fix it for her.

407
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:17,026
I don't think she saw that one.
You wanna do it again?

408
00:24:17,366 --> 00:24:18,375
I'll see you at home.

409
00:24:22,392 --> 00:24:24,233
Susan? A word?

410
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:30,108
Did you not see my hand up?
I was trying to volunteer.

411
00:24:30,318 --> 00:24:34,426
I saw. I was just trying
to pick the people who I thought

412
00:24:34,461 --> 00:24:36,297
could best
protect our neighborhood.

413
00:24:36,526 --> 00:24:38,910
So you picked irma pritchet?
Her son

414
00:24:38,945 --> 00:24:42,363
is in a nursing home.
Yes, katherine, irma is old,

415
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:45,287
But she's not
a big fat liar.

416
00:24:46,077 --> 00:24:50,965
excuse me?
<i>Well, are you not going around</i>

417
00:24:51,267 --> 00:24:53,395
Saying that my husband
hit on you?

418
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:56,432
 susan...

419
00:24:57,771 --> 00:25:00,601
I know you're under
a terrible strain,

420
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:03,187
<i>But do you really think
it's a good idea to air...</i>

421
00:25:03,454 --> 00:25:05,961
your dirty laundry
in front of all these people?

422
00:25:07,629 --> 00:25:09,210
You're the one
with dirty laundry.

423
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:12,357
My laundry is clean, folded
and put away, you loon.

424
00:25:13,516 --> 00:25:15,328
Um, girls?
Everything all right here?

425
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:17,815
No, it's not.

426
00:25:18,271 --> 00:25:19,964
First she calls me a liar,

427
00:25:20,887 --> 00:25:22,216
And now I'm a loon.

428
00:25:22,777 --> 00:25:24,888
Okay, you all heard the things
she was saying.

429
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:26,605
You saw the way she acted
at my wedding.

430
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,770
Not everyone was invited
to your wedding.

431
00:25:29,166 --> 00:25:31,252
Jeez, mona. You're like a dog
with a bone. Let it go.

432
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,112
I understand
why you're upset.

433
00:25:34,551 --> 00:25:36,160
I'd be on edge, too,
if my marriage

434
00:25:36,195 --> 00:25:39,532
were having problems.
Okay, mike and I are perfectly happy,

435
00:25:39,567 --> 00:25:42,813
And the only problem we have is you.
So stay out of our lives,

436
00:25:42,848 --> 00:25:44,152
or you'll be sorry.

437
00:25:45,536 --> 00:25:49,278
Well, if you two are so happy,
then where did he just disappear to?

438
00:25:49,901 --> 00:25:52,552
he's snaking
a lady's drain, okay?

439
00:25:56,073 --> 00:26:00,204
And, yes, I realize how that sounded.
Get your minds out of the gutter.

440
00:26:08,232 --> 00:26:10,366
Okay, rachel, have fun.

441
00:26:10,401 --> 00:26:13,129
Coco the clown will make you
any balloon animal you want.

442
00:26:13,145 --> 00:26:17,021
Uh, you know, maybe I should stay for a little while.
Oh, come on. I'm watching them.

443
00:26:17,231 --> 00:26:18,346
I've got everything
under control.

444
00:26:19,845 --> 00:26:21,040
Will you be here?

445
00:26:26,064 --> 00:26:28,977
Could you believe her?
I'm a good mom, aren't I?

446
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,548
People trust me. 
Hey, I brought my kid, didn't I?

447
00:26:32,036 --> 00:26:33,156
Yes, you did.

448
00:26:33,943 --> 00:26:37,187
But wait. You're staying.
I'll get us drinks.

449
00:26:41,864 --> 00:26:44,059
Hi, sweetie. What's the matter?
Aren't you having a good time?

450
00:26:44,333 --> 00:26:46,086
The man is putting
the monkey away.

451
00:26:46,787 --> 00:26:48,982
He said he was too tired
to play anymore.

452
00:26:50,072 --> 00:26:52,645
Oh, I don't think so. That ape
is on the clock till 4:00.

453
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,971
Hey! What gives?

454
00:26:56,379 --> 00:26:59,344
Sorry. Mr. Fibbs did two shows
yesterday. He needs a nap.

455
00:26:59,732 --> 00:27:01,888
No way. I paid
for two hours of monkey.

456
00:27:02,125 --> 00:27:03,718
I want two hours of monkey.

457
00:27:04,108 --> 00:27:07,271
Let him go. I can do the gig alone.
No offense, coco,

458
00:27:07,484 --> 00:27:09,274
But I need this to be
the greatest party ever,

459
00:27:09,567 --> 00:27:11,288
And your act isn't exactly
zingin' the kids.

460
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:15,292
Hey, I killed at your other kid's party.
Those kids were 3!

461
00:27:15,513 --> 00:27:17,315
These are 7-year-olds! The big time!

462
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:20,018
Crappy balloon animals ain't gonna cut it!
We need the monkey!

463
00:27:20,508 --> 00:27:21,765
Lady, he's tired.

464
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,987
Well, then give him some
banana-flavored coffee.

465
00:27:24,334 --> 00:27:27,640
You screw me on this, and I swear,
Fibbs will never work in this town again.

466
00:27:37,568 --> 00:27:38,311
come in.

467
00:27:40,854 --> 00:27:41,945
You called for a lightbulb?

468
00:27:42,482 --> 00:27:44,257
The bedside lamp.

469
00:27:50,384 --> 00:27:52,306
I saw you pull in
an hour ago.

470
00:27:53,298 --> 00:27:54,881
your gentleman friend
stand you up?

471
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,335
Sorry to disappoint you, but he
just called. He's on his way.

472
00:28:00,745 --> 00:28:01,808
Hmm. That's nice.

473
00:28:03,678 --> 00:28:07,225
Well, if you finish your magazine,
there's a bible in the nightstand.

474
00:28:09,206 --> 00:28:13,143
Tell me something. Did he cheat on you 
just once or did he do it all the time?

475
00:28:16,744 --> 00:28:17,991
Who?

476
00:28:18,368 --> 00:28:20,639
I've been wondering
what makes a woman

477
00:28:20,847 --> 00:28:22,577
So quick to judge anyone
who has an affair,

478
00:28:22,895 --> 00:28:24,099
And I think I know.

479
00:28:24,852 --> 00:28:26,868
Your husband cheated on you,
didn't he?

480
00:28:38,668 --> 00:28:39,828
My husband...

481
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:42,753
Was the best man
that I ever knew.

482
00:28:44,576 --> 00:28:47,738
But a good man wasn't good enough for me.

483
00:28:48,648 --> 00:28:49,822
I was like you.

484
00:28:50,282 --> 00:28:52,084
I wanted fun, excitement,

485
00:28:52,805 --> 00:28:54,515
So I found myself
a boyfriend.

486
00:28:55,987 --> 00:28:57,928
Good-looking guy. Sexy.

487
00:28:58,473 --> 00:29:00,223
<i>And we had ourselves
a real good time.</i>

488
00:29:00,258 --> 00:29:01,974
You having a good time,
lady?

489
00:29:04,266 --> 00:29:05,358
Yes, I am.

490
00:29:07,693 --> 00:29:09,624
Enjoy it while it lasts.

491
00:29:10,774 --> 00:29:12,702
It didn't last long for me.

492
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:14,079
And when it was done,

493
00:29:14,721 --> 00:29:18,527
I had no husband
and no boyfriend.

494
00:29:20,226 --> 00:29:21,887
So now I'm cleaning rooms.

495
00:29:22,755 --> 00:29:26,916
Every day, I see women in here
acting just as stupid as I was.

496
00:29:27,324 --> 00:29:28,827
I don't say a word to them.

497
00:29:29,547 --> 00:29:31,030
I just give them a look.

498
00:29:36,587 --> 00:29:38,495
Well, I'm...Sorry your affair
ended so badly.

499
00:29:40,161 --> 00:29:41,961
But that doesn't mean
that mine will.

500
00:30:00,115 --> 00:30:02,189
You seem like a nice lady.

501
00:30:03,116 --> 00:30:04,486
Don't you ever feel guilty?

502
00:30:04,521 --> 00:30:05,477
No.

503
00:30:13,419 --> 00:30:14,643
Yes, all right?

504
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:17,794
Yes, I feel guilty
all the time.

505
00:30:20,769 --> 00:30:23,171
You don't know what it's like
when I come home,

506
00:30:24,624 --> 00:30:26,374
And my husband's at the door

507
00:30:28,111 --> 00:30:30,008
And there's such love
in his eyes, such...

508
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:32,733
Hope.

509
00:30:34,855 --> 00:30:37,007
And I wanna shake him
and say, "stop it.

510
00:30:37,097 --> 00:30:40,596
Stop loving me.
I'm not worth it anymore."

511
00:30:43,347 --> 00:30:45,778
<i>Don't you want
to be worth it again?</i>

512
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,674
<i>Don't you want
to be worth it again?</i>

513
00:30:53,999 --> 00:30:55,126
Is there some kind
of problem?

514
00:30:57,348 --> 00:31:01,038
No, sir.
Just turning on a light.

515
00:31:11,556 --> 00:31:13,010
There you are.

516
00:31:13,808 --> 00:31:15,545
Now it's a kids' party.

517
00:31:18,934 --> 00:31:20,505
Are you still mad
about laura?

518
00:31:21,837 --> 00:31:23,681
The party's a success. The kids
are having a great time.

519
00:31:23,911 --> 00:31:25,228
We're drinkin' margaritas.

520
00:31:25,587 --> 00:31:27,127
What's not to likey?

521
00:31:28,832 --> 00:31:31,139
you know what? You're right.
I won.

522
00:31:32,551 --> 00:31:34,345
Laura and her stuck-up posse
thought her kids

523
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,845
weren't safe in my house.

524
00:31:36,154 --> 00:31:37,696
I've shown them the best time
they're gonna have all year.

525
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:42,509
Um, gaby?
I know. They're loud.

526
00:31:42,544 --> 00:31:45,730
Kids! Adults talking!
No, I think that there's a problem.

527
00:31:45,765 --> 00:31:47,518
M.J.? What is going on?

528
00:31:47,553 --> 00:31:49,416
The monkey is killing the clown!

529
00:31:57,859 --> 00:31:59,558
I've gotta get
my tranquilizer gun.

530
00:32:01,021 --> 00:32:02,765
I told you he needed a nap

531
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:06,741
He was already on edge, and then...
that damn clown popped a balloon in his face

532
00:32:20,073 --> 00:32:22,443
Laura, I was here every minute!

533
00:32:22,478 --> 00:32:24,709
It's not my fault they sent us
a homicidal monkey.

534
00:32:25,014 --> 00:32:27,113
The important part is that the kids
had a good time

535
00:32:27,473 --> 00:32:28,996
and created lifelong memories.

536
00:32:35,809 --> 00:32:37,800
Hey, you forgot your goody bag!

537
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,875
So, I still don't get why
you fired Roy.

538
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:47,217
I mean, he was putting the bird house
where you wanted it, right?

539
00:32:47,454 --> 00:32:50,601
It's not about that.
He said I emasculate you

540
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,659
He said that?
Well, not in those words.

541
00:32:53,694 --> 00:32:56,517
He went with a more colorful
nutcracking analogy.

542
00:32:57,749 --> 00:32:59,851
<i>(laughs) he is funny.
He is not funny!</i>

543
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:03,224
And this would be a really good place
<i>For you to jump in and tell me

544
00:33:03,259 --> 00:33:04,776
I'm not a castrating bitch.</i>
Sure.

545
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,368
Just put down
the knife first.

546
00:33:09,012 --> 00:33:11,536
Wow. We are not laughing at this at all, huh?
No!

547
00:33:12,145 --> 00:33:13,725
Oh, come on, babe.
We're great.

548
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,681
You know that.
What do you care what he thinks?

549
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:20,745
I don't care. It's just--
it bugs me that he's judging me.

550
00:33:23,609 --> 00:33:26,532
What are you doing with that?
I thought I'd barbecue some chicken.

551
00:33:27,863 --> 00:33:30,308
Mm. It's almost dinnertime,
and that's still frozen.

552
00:33:30,343 --> 00:33:31,889
Just get some burgers
from the garage.

553
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:34,232
You got it.

554
00:33:48,905 --> 00:33:49,741
Hey, roy.

555
00:33:50,351 --> 00:33:52,513
Can I talk to you?
Sure thing, pally.

556
00:33:53,754 --> 00:33:55,122
Here. Take a load off.

557
00:33:56,862 --> 00:33:59,160
If it's about me getting into it
with your wife, though,

558
00:33:59,364 --> 00:34:02,787
I have to stop you first
and say I'm sorry.

559
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:06,758
Well, thanks.
I mean, I know times have changed,

560
00:34:07,401 --> 00:34:08,962
But a man's still a man,

561
00:34:09,666 --> 00:34:11,742
And you deserve
to have your wife respect you.

562
00:34:12,476 --> 00:34:13,718
She respects me plenty,
roy.

563
00:34:18,535 --> 00:34:19,456
Here's the thing

564
00:34:20,155 --> 00:34:22,188
You gotta understand
about lynette.

565
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:27,714
She grew up without her dad.
Her mom was a drinker.

566
00:34:28,105 --> 00:34:30,019
So she had to be responsible
for everyone.

567
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:33,524
Yeah, well, that's rough.
Yeah.

568
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:35,214
It left her

569
00:34:36,337 --> 00:34:38,367
with this constant fear

570
00:34:38,638 --> 00:34:41,242
That everything
could suddenly fall apart.

571
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:45,456
And that's why she needs
to control everything.

572
00:34:46,778 --> 00:34:47,914
Of course, she can't.

573
00:34:48,791 --> 00:34:49,744
Nobody can.

574
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:51,732
But...

575
00:34:52,825 --> 00:34:54,688
<i>She can control me...</i>

576
00:34:57,022 --> 00:34:58,334
If I let her.

577
00:34:59,874 --> 00:35:01,426
So I do...

578
00:35:03,337 --> 00:35:05,311
Because it makes her
feel safe.

579
00:35:08,765 --> 00:35:10,273
And that is my job

580
00:35:11,089 --> 00:35:12,399
As her husband...

581
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:16,343
To make her feel safe.

582
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,755
You're a good man, scavo.

583
00:35:28,116 --> 00:35:29,390
I try.

584
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:32,007
Now...
If you'll excuse me,

585
00:35:32,883 --> 00:35:34,735
I have hamburger to fetch.

586
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:45,090
Stop beating yourself up.
It wasn't that bad.

587
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:49,474
Carlos, a monkey
almost killed a clown.

588
00:35:49,678 --> 00:35:52,157
That is the definition
of a bad children's party.

589
00:35:58,074 --> 00:36:00,216
Laura's right.
I'm a terrible mom.

590
00:36:00,608 --> 00:36:02,538
Hey. Come here.

591
00:36:05,552 --> 00:36:06,705
Look...

592
00:36:07,072 --> 00:36:09,742
I am no expert
at raising children.

593
00:36:10,558 --> 00:36:13,491
All I know is, when all those other kids

594
00:36:13,732 --> 00:36:15,553
ran screaming to their moms,

595
00:36:15,777 --> 00:36:17,886
Juanita jumped
in the bouncy house

596
00:36:18,169 --> 00:36:21,031
And zipped it up, and celia played dead.
Those girls are smart.

597
00:36:22,348 --> 00:36:24,073
yeah. They were quick
on their feet, weren't they?

598
00:36:24,344 --> 00:36:27,889
Which they wouldn't be if you'd been
hovering all over 'em their whole lives.

599
00:36:28,871 --> 00:36:31,492
They have learned to be
independent and resourceful,

600
00:36:31,733 --> 00:36:33,735
And that is thanks
to your negligence.

601
00:36:35,323 --> 00:36:36,630
Mmm. So sweet.

602
00:36:39,454 --> 00:36:41,224
That better not be
the good suitcase!

603
00:36:45,088 --> 00:36:47,285
mom!
Julie?

604
00:36:48,422 --> 00:36:49,265
Julie?!

605
00:36:51,689 --> 00:36:53,560
Sweetie?
Get mike!

606
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:55,980
He's on a job. What's going on?
Somebody is outside.

607
00:36:57,062 --> 00:36:59,417
oh, my god. What is that?!
It's a gun.

608
00:36:59,955 --> 00:37:01,509
Where did you get that?!
Give that to me.

609
00:37:02,091 --> 00:37:03,413
What are you thinking?

610
00:37:06,006 --> 00:37:07,168
It's loaded, right?

611
00:37:16,366 --> 00:37:20,182
I have a gun! I've called the police!
They'll be here any minute!

612
00:37:38,565 --> 00:37:40,877
Katherine?
you shot me!

613
00:37:44,911 --> 00:37:47,874
Oh, my god! Katherine, the gun just went off!
Are you all right?

614
00:37:48,117 --> 00:37:50,438
Are you all right?
Okay, I just shot you.

615
00:37:50,889 --> 00:37:52,542
Let's not be throwing accusations around.

616
00:37:52,821 --> 00:37:55,334
It looks like it just grazed your shoulder.
There's hardly any blood.

617
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:57,865
What happened?
Susan shot me!

618
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,908
Call the police!
I told you she was gonna snap.

619
00:38:00,158 --> 00:38:02,153
It's always the pretty ones.
It was an accident.

620
00:38:02,959 --> 00:38:04,623
Bob, I want you to be my lawyer.
No, no,

621
00:38:04,852 --> 00:38:06,738
I call bob as my lawyer.

622
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:09,699
We heard a gun go off.
Susan shot me!

623
00:38:10,801 --> 00:38:13,406
susan!
I didn't know it was her.

624
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:17,920
What were you doing sneaking around my house?
I was on neighborhood watch!

625
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:21,889
You didn't have an assigned shift.
Tom scavo had to study. 

626
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:25,088
He asked me to fill in!
Well... You should've checked with me.

627
00:38:25,911 --> 00:38:27,844
That's what I was trying to do
when you shot me!

628
00:38:28,371 --> 00:38:31,147
All right, all right. Everybody, just calm down. 
I'm gonna go call an ambulance.

629
00:38:33,469 --> 00:38:36,233
Perhaps we should unload this
before someone else gets hurt.

630
00:38:38,315 --> 00:38:39,475
Bree, dear?

631
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,380
Susan just shot
katherine mayfair.

632
00:38:50,641 --> 00:38:52,731
What?
She's okay, but she's--

633
00:38:53,385 --> 00:38:55,944
she's freaked out.
I never pegged susan

634
00:38:55,979 --> 00:38:58,309
as a gun owner.
Oh, crap.

635
00:39:01,292 --> 00:39:04,316
It's our gun. I gave it to julie.
What? Why?

636
00:39:04,666 --> 00:39:06,678
She was scared.
She wanted protection.

637
00:39:07,321 --> 00:39:09,497
That gun is under
our real name!

638
00:39:09,532 --> 00:39:13,660
If they trace that back to us--
Well, we are not going to let that happen.

639
00:39:16,263 --> 00:39:17,664
You're going to jail for this.

640
00:39:17,974 --> 00:39:21,113
Everyone heard you you...Threaten me 
at that meeting. I have witnesses.

641
00:39:21,497 --> 00:39:24,973
<i>Oh, please. If I were gonna kill you,</i>
I wouldn't do it in my own front yard.

642
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,564
I'd sneak into your house
and shoot you while you were asleep.

643
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,652
Not that I would ever
do that.

644
00:39:35,653 --> 00:39:39,369
Katherine, where are you going?
Home, to call the police.

645
00:39:44,012 --> 00:39:46,648
Hey, katherine,
the ambulance is on its way.

646
00:39:46,868 --> 00:39:49,201
But I brought
a first aid kit.

647
00:39:49,546 --> 00:39:51,504
Why don't you let me clean
you up, and then you can call?

648
00:39:53,113 --> 00:39:57,890
Just leave it! Hand me the phone.
I wanna call the police.

649
00:40:00,483 --> 00:40:02,694
Dumb move, katherine.
What?

650
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,600
listen to me.

651
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,586
You and mike... I see it, too.

652
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,421
Those looks he gives you?

653
00:40:14,959 --> 00:40:16,402
He's still crazy about you.

654
00:40:17,694 --> 00:40:18,776
I know!

655
00:40:19,298 --> 00:40:22,830
So... Use your head.
You wanna call the police

656
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:25,230
And have the mother of his kid
carted off to jail?

657
00:40:25,743 --> 00:40:28,367
Don't be stupid.
High road all the way.

658
00:40:31,281 --> 00:40:32,803
That's a good point.

659
00:40:33,183 --> 00:40:36,875
Mm-hmm, and besides, you walk around
with a bandage on your shoulder for a few days--

660
00:40:37,498 --> 00:40:39,049
She looks like a monster,

661
00:40:39,621 --> 00:40:41,645
And you come off
looking like a saint.

662
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:49,363
So how we doin' here?
I'm fine!

663
00:40:54,711 --> 00:40:58,172
Yeah. I don't think we'll be needing
that ambulance anymore. Hmm?

664
00:41:04,218 --> 00:41:05,441
so am I going to jail?
Nah.

665
00:41:05,822 --> 00:41:07,015
She's not calling anybody.

666
00:41:07,562 --> 00:41:10,856
She's a little worked-up, it's what,
it's gonna be okay.

667
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:23,012
It is in our nature to judge 
the people around us.

668
00:41:23,828 --> 00:41:29,681
If they ignore our wishes,
we believe they are disrespectful.

669
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:33,477
if they don't watch their children,

670
00:41:34,745 --> 00:41:38,179
we conclude they're unfit parents.

671
00:41:39,828 --> 00:41:42,027
If we catch them cheating,

672
00:41:42,859 --> 00:41:46,025
we assume we know their reasons.

673
00:41:47,089 --> 00:41:49,302
But, what happens when we finally

674
00:41:49,337 --> 00:41:52,678
stop for a moment,
to judge our own lives.

675
00:41:55,573 --> 00:41:57,725
It can be painful to step back

676
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,878
and seeing what we've been doing,

677
00:42:03,564 --> 00:42:06,376
and even more painful to realize

678
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:12,487
we have no intention of stopping.
