00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:02,570
<i>Previously on Desperate Housewives</i>

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:04,539
<i>Gaby learned a secret</i>

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,070
Lee and I are trying to adopt a baby.

4
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:08,010
Mike made a commitment

5
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:11,229
but I can be a guy who
takes care of his family.

6
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:12,819
<i>Lynette was warned.</i>

7
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,219
I told Preston I want to
move up wedding to next week,

8
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:17,539
Next week?

9
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,030
<i>A killer put everyone on edge</i>

10
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,129
Can't believe she is dead

11
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,159
I gotta go home, My
mom was so freaked out.

12
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,139
It could be minished, if
she wants me to be around

13
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,380
So you're my brother?

14
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,340
Half-brother, to be precise.

15
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,809
<i>Suspicioun was born</i>

16
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,319
And what do we really know about Sam?

17
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,240
... should be to find
out everything I can.

18
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,810
Why shouldn't you? He's your brother.

19
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,580
<i>And a very dangerous man
arrived on Wisteria lane.</i>

20
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:50,390
<i>Good neighbors--</i>

21
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,280
<i>They loan you cups of sugar...</i>

22
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:58,330
<i>They tell you why
your car won't start...</i>

23
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,820
<i>They even help you find your lost pets.</i>

24
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,750
<i>Good neighbors also come over</i>

25
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:09,150
<i>At the slightest hint of trouble...</i>

26
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,460
<i>Whether you want 'em there or not.</i>

27
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:14,009
<i>...being unreasonable! You know what?</i>

28
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,360
<i>I'm tired of fighting about this.</i>

29
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,900
<i>Okay, fine. Walk away.
It's what you always do.</i>

30
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,190
Gaby, what are you doing?

31
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,060
I came to return this
magazine Lee lent me,

32
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,100
But you two were arguing, so...

33
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,470
So you decided it would
be fun to eavesdrop?

34
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,840
God, it's like you see into my soul,

35
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,770
And yet you don't judge. Thank you.

36
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:42,610
Oh, come on. Tell me what happened.

37
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:46,110
Our egg donor backed out.

38
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,680
Not again.

39
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,720
And the surrogate we hired will pull out

40
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,539
If the procedure isn't
done in the next month.

41
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,050
Well, can't you find another egg donor?

42
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,929
We could, if Lee wasn't so picky.

43
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,990
Why are you discussing this with her?

44
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,160
For God sakes, I was
eavesdropping. Catch up.

45
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,630
Okay, yeah, I'm picky.

46
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,590
We spent two years choosing a mattress.

47
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:05,460
I'm not just going to
get our child's d.N.A.

48
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,630
Out of the yellow pages.
If we lose the surrogate,

49
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,580
It could take months
to find another one.

50
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:12,300
Yeah, and then she'll drop
out for some ridiculous reason,

51
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,900
And I can't take any more of this!

52
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:15,959
You know, maybe we're not

53
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,800
supposed to be parents.
Don't talk like that!

54
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,440
Come on! Doesn't it seem like

55
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:24,110
The universe is trying to tell
us something? Why not take mine?

56
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,710
Take your what? My eggs.

57
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,440
I mean, I've got plenty,

58
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,010
And I hate to see you guys so unhappy.

59
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,650
So what the heck?

60
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,390
Good neighbors--they're
people who try to help others.

61
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,590
Bad neighbors are
people who make promises

62
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,930
They can't possibly keep.

63
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:03,600
The morning paper said
a young girl was missing.

64
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,130
It quoted her family,

65
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:09,070
Who said she had vanished
on her way to work.

66
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,809
It quoted her friends,

67
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:15,020
Who said she wasn't the
type to run away from home.

68
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,520
It quoted the police,

69
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:21,520
Who said they had very
little evidence to go on.

70
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:28,160
Sadly, people didn't pay much
attention to this bit of news.

71
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,100
No one thinks about evil

72
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:37,000
Until it shows up on their doorstep,

73
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,470
Which it soon would.

74
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,810
Oh, my God. Thief!

75
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:54,480
Hey! You!

76
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,220
Freeze! Whoa! Whoa!
Lady, put that thing down.

77
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,220
Oh, yeah? While I'm at it, why
don't I just hand you the keys?

78
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,060
Now hit the dirt! Relax.
I'm not stealing anything.

79
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,560
This is a repossession.

80
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:08,160
Do I look stupid to you? Fire! Fire!

81
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,429
What the hell are you doing?

82
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,230
People come quicker
when you yell "Fire."

83
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:15,040
Now I believe I told
you to hit the dirt!

84
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,600
Where's the fire?

85
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,410
Susan, you okay?

86
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,910
I'm fine. Just
call 9-1-1!

87
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:25,050
Hey, what's going on? This thief
is trying to steal your truck!

88
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,680
Hey. You're the guy who's four
months behind on his payments?

89
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,750
Yeah.

90
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:33,050
Stop, drop and roll!

91
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:36,490
Stop, drop and roll!

92
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:42,460
Whoblems?

93
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,560
I was hoping business would
pick up before anybody found out.

94
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,900
But I guess that's no longer an option.

95
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,870
Mike, we talked about this.

96
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,770
I told you, I am willing to help.

97
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:58,140
And I told you, I'm not
taking my wife's money.

98
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,310
Well, enough with the macho pride.

99
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,250
I make a steady paycheck,

100
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,720
And I have all that money
from selling Karl's strip club.

101
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,190
No. I'm definitely not taking
your ex-husband's money.

102
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,260
Are we done here? Sure.
As long as you can explain

103
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:13,320
How you're going to
run a plumbing business

104
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,330
Without a truck.

105
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,760
I don't know. I'll figure it out.

106
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,570
And for the cover of the book,
I see you in an evening gown,

107
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,110
Sitting on a bale of hay,
ringing a dinner bell.

108
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:31,280
I love it. Such a sense of whimsy.

109
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,580
Well, if it isn't the dynamic duo.

110
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:35,580
How did your meeting
with the publisher go?

111
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,850
Fantastic.

112
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,050
Bruce loved the idea of a
nouvelle Southern cookbook.

113
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,050
And your brother came up

114
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:46,320
With the marketing slogan
in the room. Tell him, Sam.

115
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,990
"Mrs. Van De Kamp

116
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,530
Introduces you to upscale
down-home cuisine."

117
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,700
Catchy. I-I guess you
know all about marketing,

118
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,700
Having an mba and all.

119
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,430
I guess so.

120
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:04,040
Except, of course, you
don't actually have an mba.

121
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,040
What are you talking about?

122
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,940
I made a few calls,
checked a few records.

123
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:13,380
Turns out the golden
child never got his degree.

124
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:17,350
Is this true?

125
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,890
Yes. I'm a few classes short.

126
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,990
Is one of them ethics?

127
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:24,330
Andrew, please.

128
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,430
I don't understand.

129
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:31,040
It was the final semester.

130
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,040
We were about two months in

131
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,770
When the doctor told me
my mother was terminal.

132
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,940
I left school and brought her home

133
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,880
So she didn't have to
die in the hospital.

134
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:43,510
If you like,

135
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,510
I can save you a phone call

136
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,880
And bring in her death certificate.

137
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,020
That's okay.

138
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,060
The university let me
graduate with my class.

139
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:58,890
I should finish my
coursework next month.

140
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,400
But I'm sorry, Bree.

141
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:04,100
I should not have misrepresented myself.

142
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,600
Everyone steps over
the line now and then.

143
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,540
Let's all make an effort not to,

144
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:10,910
Shall we?

145
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:25,380
This woman is incompetent.
Why you bring me here?

146
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:28,520
Hey, you're the one who had to
come to a Russian bridal shop.

147
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,960
It was mistake.

148
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,460
Well... Look at the fun you're having

149
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:37,630
Chewing people out
in your native tongue.

150
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:38,800
Hey.

151
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:43,180
Sorry for the way she's
been talking to you.

152
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,190
Don't worry. You're not losing a son.

153
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,190
You are gaining a pain in the ass.

154
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,860
Tell me about it.

155
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:51,360
My son is marrying a
woman he barely knows.

156
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,360
He's making the biggest
mistake of his life,

157
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,069
And I am powerless to stop him.

158
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,540
If you like,

159
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,940
Maybe I get a little
sloppy with the pushpins.

160
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,710
Aw, you're sweet.

161
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,350
Irina? It's your phone.

162
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,780
If it's Preston, tell
him I be home soon.

163
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,550
Okay, your highness.

164
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,790
Bride's phone.

165
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,790
Irina...

166
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:19,230
Okay. Slow down. I...
I don't speak Russian.

167
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,830
Irina, it's some Russian guy,
and he doesn't sound happy.

168
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,770
Alexei...

169
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:33,810
Who was that?

170
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,340
Wrong number.

171
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:38,280
Wrong number? He asked for you by name.

172
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:41,680
If I wanted you to know,
I would say it in English.

173
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,620
Missus?

174
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:49,670
I can say it in English.

175
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,680
Hey. Double cappuccino, extra hot.

176
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,050
Need anything else?

177
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,590
Inspiration.

178
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:05,920
Sorry. We just have muffins.

179
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,860
What are you working on?

180
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,260
A novel.

181
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,670
I know--another guy in a
coffee shop writing a novel.

182
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,000
Just what the world needs.

183
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,540
No, I think it's cool. Mind
if I ask what it's about?

184
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,570
You really wanna know?

185
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:23,980
I do.

186
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:27,310
It started out as a love story,

187
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:31,050
But it's getting kind of dark.

188
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,420
This guy meets this girl,

189
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:35,750
Takes her from nothing,

190
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,590
Gives her life meaning.

191
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,030
Basically creates her.

192
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:42,569
Okay.

193
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,370
Then one day,

194
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:46,780
She just disappears...

195
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,980
Vanishes...

196
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,480
With another man.

197
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,480
Sucks for the guy.

198
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,950
And she takes his baby.

199
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:58,090
Damn. Well, she sounds like a bitch.

200
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,730
Sure does.

201
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,890
Anyhow, I'm up to the point

202
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:05,900
Where the guy who's been
looking for her for a long time

203
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:07,930
Finally tracks her down.

204
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,970
And that's where I'm kind of stuck.

205
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,670
What does he do?

206
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:21,140
Well, I don't know all the details,

207
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,150
But you said it was dark, right?

208
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,380
Yeah.

209
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:30,190
Seems to me the guy would kill her.

210
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:33,760
Funny. That was exactly
my first instinct, too.

211
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:39,869
No.

212
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:43,670
No? You asked my permission to
be an egg donor, and I said "No."

213
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,170
Oh, I wasn't asking
you. I was telling you.

214
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:48,170
Sorry. You can't do
this without my approval.

215
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,940
Those eggs are half mine.

216
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,880
How so? I'm your husband.

217
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:54,780
I own 50% of whatever
comes out of that uterus.

218
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:57,650
Oh! So you think you own my body.

219
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,620
I pay for the clothes it wears,

220
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:01,290
The massages it receives

221
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,290
And the implants it
will one day require.

222
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,560
If I don't own it, I'm at
least a major stockholder.

223
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,530
Which means I can stop you

224
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,460
From handing out your
eggs like party favors

225
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,260
To every childless gay
couple that wanders by.

226
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,170
You cannot stop me. I can do
whatever I want with my eggs.

227
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,140
And I can do whatever I want
with the credit cards I pay for.

228
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:20,110
For example, I can cut them up.

229
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,010
I don't care about credit cards.

230
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,980
I am trying to do something Noble here.

231
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:27,080
I'm helping these
people become a family.

232
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,370
You've hidden the cards, haven't you?

233
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,330
Damn straight.

234
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,440
Okay, I am begging you,

235
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,070
As your husband,

236
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,540
Please don't do this.

237
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,710
It'll be too weird having
your d.N.A. Living next door.

238
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,810
I don't care. My mind is made up.

239
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:44,250
I am going to help
Bob and Lee have a baby

240
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,180
So they can experience
the same love and joy

241
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,220
That we occasionally
have with our children.

242
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,240
So the Russian salesgirl
translated for me,

243
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,980
And you'll never guess
what irina said to the...

244
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:59,380
Angry guy on the phone.

245
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,080
Please don't make me guess.

246
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,120
She said, "Go ahead
and call the police."

247
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:07,160
You'll never find me."

248
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,090
And that's it?

249
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:11,690
How much more do you need?

250
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:15,060
She is a foreigner. She's
done something criminal.

251
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,700
Start your deportation now.

252
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:19,470
Ma'am, without proof
of criminal activity,

253
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,440
There's nothing I can do.

254
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:24,210
Can't you at least... Interrogate her?

255
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,110
Yes, and... If you wanna
slap her around a bit,

256
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:29,080
You'll get no complaints from me.

257
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:32,010
Look, Mrs. Scavo, we
are a government agency.

258
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,630
We can't investigate your
future daughter-in-law

259
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:37,960
Just because you don't think
she's good for your son.

260
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:42,670
Ah. It all makes sense now.

261
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,570
You're single, right?
Never had any kids?

262
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,540
Yeah. So?

263
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,670
You just don't get it.

264
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:03,750
Hi. Nice-looking family. Is
that your daughter-in-law?

265
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,090
Yeah.

266
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,550
You two get along?

267
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,660
Don't get me started.

268
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:13,330
Got a minute?

269
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:22,170
M.J., what are you
doin'? Clogging the sink.

270
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,500
What?

271
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,970
Daddy needs work.

272
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:29,240
Honey, that's sweet,
but daddy only gets paid

273
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,510
When other people
have plumbing problems.

274
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:35,050
So I should do this to
somebody else's sink?

275
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,650
No, honey.

276
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,620
That would be wrong.

277
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:48,330
Hi. I'm having a problem
with Mike and his male ego.

278
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,770
Long story short--
can I clog your drain?

279
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,170
So don't phone Mike until I get home.

280
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:00,380
Ugh. Okay, and when you
call him, sound desperate.

281
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:02,480
That way, he'll feel useful.

282
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,950
But don't call till Saturday.
He gets double time on weekends.

283
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,530
There's enough there for a tip,

284
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,460
But careful when you give it to him.

285
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,400
I don't want him thinking
anyone's doing him a favor.

286
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,950
Trust me, Bruce. After
they taste these recipes,

287
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,780
They will be onboard.

288
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,190
Just give me the chance to dazzle them.

289
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,920
Okay. Bye.

290
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,320
Problems?

291
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,230
Bruce got a little resistance
when he met with the sales team.

292
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,960
They fear Southern
cookbooks are a tad overdone.

293
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:40,530
So I suggested we have a little dinner

294
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,800
To let them sample the
recipes themselves. Excellent.

295
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,770
We have to really impress them.

296
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,830
Let's see if we can book
the private dining room

297
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,240
At the britannian hotel.
I'll take care of it.

298
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:52,570
But before I do, I have
something... Difficult to say.

299
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,910
Well, I hope it's not about
that silly mba business.

300
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:58,580
I think I know why Andrew
tried to discredit me yesterday.

301
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:04,030
He knew you had me auditing the books,

302
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:07,030
And he knew what I was gonna find.

303
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,700
What did you find?

304
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:16,940
Did you charge the donellys
for five cases of vodka?

305
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,550
Yeah. So?

306
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,180
According to our invoices,

307
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,150
Only four were delivered to their party.

308
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:25,720
And the rotary club luncheon was
charged for seven cases of wine,

309
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,420
And only six showed up. Why are
you even looking at this stuff?

310
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,360
And I seem to recall your
having a party that same weekend,

311
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,490
With lots of wine and lots of vodka.

312
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,830
Okay, yeah, I-I took some
leftover booze to my house

313
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,760
For a party. What's the big deal?

314
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,970
It wasn't leftover. You charged
the client for that liquor.

315
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,540
That's stealing. Is Sam the
one who told you about this?

316
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:46,540
We are not talking about Sam
right now. But we need to.

317
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,690
Can't you see the type of person he is?

318
00:15:50,691 --> 00:15:53,090
Yes, he is the type of
person who leaves college

319
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:55,060
To care for his dying mother.

320
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:58,860
You are the type of person
who steals from clients.

321
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,830
Believe what you wanna believe,

322
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,970
But I'm not gonna listen to this.

323
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,500
Andrew.

324
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,970
Don't you walk away from me!

325
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,470
Can't you see how he's manipulating you?

326
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,609
How stupid can you be?

327
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:14,080
Apparently I'm stupid
enough to have trusted you.

328
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:16,799
Well, if I'm the problem,
why not just fire me?

329
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,350
I'm tempted. Don't push me.

330
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:29,630
Clear your things out
and turn in your keys.

331
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:46,529
Oh, hey, Tom.

332
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:49,060
Did irina and Preston say when
they'd be back from the mall?

333
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,700
Stop!

334
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,800
Stop what?

335
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:56,840
Not you. I'm teaching Parker to drive.

336
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:00,310
Okay. I'm planning to steal
irina's passport number.

337
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,340
Oh, God. What are you up to now?

338
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:04,550
I have a new best friend at immigration

339
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:06,820
Who's got a friend
at the Russian embassy

340
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:09,050
Who's agreed to initiate
a background search.

341
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:11,090
Lynette, this is getting out of hand.

342
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,260
That woman is hiding something,
and I am taking her down.

343
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,730
Da!

344
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:43,850
You buy me beautiful things,
and now I thank you. Ahh!

345
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,650
Come on.

346
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:52,660
We shouldn't be in here
with the door closed.

347
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:55,530
My mom gets a little freaked
out. Well, your mother is a prude.

348
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,430
That is what happens to
women when they grow old.

349
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,860
Now kiss me. Mmm.

350
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,430
Mmm! Oh, my God.

351
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,570
Who's that?

352
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:10,680
Your mom.

353
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,710
"Get home now.

354
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,010
"Trapped behind the closet door.

355
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:18,350
Preston and irina
are about to--"

356
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,750
Pull over. I gotta get home fast.

357
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,820
I can go fast.

358
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,160
Seriously, irina, my mom's in the house.

359
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,900
I know. Is what make it fun.

360
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:03,470
Honey maple short ribs
drizzled with manzanilla Sherry.

361
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,510
These are amazing.

362
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,080
Bruce's sales team will
be powerless to resist.

363
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:11,480
Well, you are really
focused on this dinner,

364
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:13,820
Which is amazing
considering what happened.

365
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:17,590
I mean... Firing your own son.

366
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:20,220
I've done worse things to Andrew.

367
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:23,990
We have a... Very
complicated relationship.

368
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:27,230
You'll see that the longer
you're at the company.

369
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:30,000
How? You fired him.

370
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,930
No, that's just our pattern.

371
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:34,170
He provokes me, and I push him away,

372
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,100
But we always come back together.

373
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,440
So... You're going to bring him back in?

374
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,160
Eventually.

375
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,160
But the stealing...

376
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,400
And the way he spoke to you, I...

377
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,200
Sam, he's my son.

378
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,080
Hey. Busy day, huh?

379
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,050
Yeah, busy week.

380
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,680
It's so funny.

381
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,180
I've had all this work
right here on the lane.

382
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,820
Well, that's good, right?

383
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:06,220
Especially since you
don't have your truck.

384
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,830
Uh-huh. Hey.

385
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:11,230
Guess what I found?

386
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,700
Oh! My earring.

387
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:14,660
Been looking all over for
that. Where'd you find it?

388
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,470
Gaby's bathtub drain.

389
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,770
Oh.

390
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:24,440
Ohh, of course.

391
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,680
Gaby and I went jogging, and, uh...

392
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:33,220
So my earring probably
got caught in--in her...

393
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:36,290
Sports bra, and when
she went to take a bath--

394
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,290
Hey, do you, uh, wanna have sex?

395
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,840
So Gaby's drain,
Angie's garbage disposal,

396
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:46,140
Lynette's
toilet--

397
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:49,140
I mean, the really dirty sex.

398
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:52,540
So now I have to return all that money.

399
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:55,210
No, you don't.

400
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,850
I...

401
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,610
Gave it to them.

402
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:02,380
You're saying everyone
on the street knows

403
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,350
I'm having financial trouble?

404
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:07,590
Well... I think they
already figured that out

405
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,560
When they saw your truck get repossessed

406
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:11,620
Out of our driveway.

407
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,590
This is humiliating, Susan.

408
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:16,100
I'm sorry, but it all
could've been prevented

409
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:19,530
If you'd just let me make a few
stupid payments on your truck.

410
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,770
I told you, I don't want your help.

411
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,100
This is my business, my problem.

412
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,370
You know, I don't
remember all those "Mys"

413
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,940
In our wedding vows.

414
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:30,240
It's supposed to be a partnership.

415
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,280
If you can't let me help you,

416
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:34,250
Maybe there's something
wrong with our marriage.

417
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,750
I'm not gonna listen to
this, all right? I'm tired.

418
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,750
I had a busy day wasting my time.

419
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:40,820
I'll sleep on the couch.

420
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,630
Danny?

421
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,390
You up there?

422
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,830
Hello?

423
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:53,940
Oh, jeez, Nick, you scared me.

424
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,880
Nothing. I just--
I just got home,

425
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:59,280
And I-I thought I heard a
noise. It--no, it's fine.

426
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,480
Just hurry home, okay?

427
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,330
To Gabrielle solis, the best neighbor

428
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,300
Two childless, upwardly mobile
gay guys could ever have. Mm.

429
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:18,660
Aw.

430
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:21,550
I got it. Hey!

431
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:24,220
No, no, no. That was purely ceremonial.

432
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:27,230
We don't want you drinking.
Why? Does it affect my fertility?

433
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:30,660
That, and you're kind of a sloppy drunk.

434
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,530
Fine. Let's talk babies.

435
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:36,370
So... What are you guys
hoping for--a boy or a girl?

436
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,840
I want a girl.

437
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:40,510
That way, we can put her
in baby beauty pageants.

438
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,550
Yeah, they're so cute in

439
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,370
their makeup and
rhinestone dresses. Right?

440
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:45,310
Really? You guys gonna do that?

441
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,250
Why not? Well, it's just I
kind of dabbled in that world,

442
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,760
And for me, it was a bit much.

443
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,780
Well, don't panic.
50% chance it's a boy.

444
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:55,150
Then it's makeup and
rhinestone vests. What?!

445
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:56,960
He's kidding.

446
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:00,320
Oh! He better be. There's
no way I'm allowing that.

447
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,740
Mm, now that I think about it,

448
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:08,010
I do hope we have a boy.

449
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:10,350
And why is that?

450
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:13,650
I already have two girls.
I'm so sick of buying dresses.

451
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,120
When he's old enough,

452
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:18,020
I'm gonna take him on the
biggest shopping spree ever.

453
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,520
Right.

454
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:24,500
I guess you can do that
when we come back to visit.

455
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:27,360
Visit? Where are you going? My
mother lives in upstate New York.

456
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,830
We thought we'd move closer to her

457
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:32,270
So the baby can be around family.

458
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,110
Really?

459
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,270
Is that a problem?

460
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:38,210
It just never occurred to me

461
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,180
That you guys would leave
and take my only son.

462
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:46,550
Gaby...

463
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,950
This child-- it'll
have your genes,

464
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:51,150
But it won't be yours.

465
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,790
You get that, right?

466
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,730
Of course.

467
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:06,540
I mean, it's the only
way it can work, right?

468
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,630
Come on. You ready?

469
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,130
Okay, no peeking.

470
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,170
You gonna beat me again this time?

471
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:28,540
Hey, guys.

472
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:30,370
What?

473
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:34,780
Mommy, why do you look so sad?

474
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:37,750
Well, I was just thinking
about what it would be like

475
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:40,180
If I couldn't see your face every day...

476
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:42,980
and it made me sad.

477
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,850
What's going on?

478
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,740
Come out of the kitchen.

479
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:54,210
I want you to spend some
time with these people.

480
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,170
Mingle. Have a drink.

481
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:58,640
I don't drink, Bruce. I'm
an alcoholic. One drink.

482
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,750
I'm not asking you to
swing from the chandelier.

483
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,720
Why are you so nervous?

484
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:09,060
I really put my neck on the
line for this book, Bree.

485
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:12,490
No one likes the idea. No one.

486
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:14,790
Oh, I should've stopped
at just one drink.

487
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:17,200
Look, they are gonna love the food.

488
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,860
I hope so,

489
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,070
Because if they don't, I don't see

490
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,940
How you're going to publish
another book of any kind.

491
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,610
<i>Here you are.</i>

492
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:34,920
<i>Just put 'em on a little
plate. Yeah, that'll be fine.</i>

493
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:38,460
Hop to, people. This is a big one.

494
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,160
Something wrong? What's this?

495
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,730
It's the Sherry we drizzle on the ribs.

496
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:45,000
This isn't Sherry. This is vinegar.

497
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:48,000
Vinegar?

498
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,470
Oh, my God.

499
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:51,980
Oh, my God.

500
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:57,910
It's ruined.

501
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:01,220
They're all ruined. It's disgusting!

502
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:03,590
The floor's not looking so great either.

503
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,129
Stop! We can't serve this food.

504
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:07,220
We've already taken
out most of the plates.

505
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,760
Well, don't just stand
there. Go get them back.

506
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,059
How can it be vinegar?

507
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,890
We tested the recipe last
night, and it was perfect,

508
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:15,849
And then I locked the

509
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:17,830
Sherry in the liquor
cabinet. Who had access?

510
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,109
Did you give Andrew's keys to

511
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:21,430
anyone after you fired him?
He never returned his key.

512
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:23,600
Oh, Bree.

513
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,570
They won't give the plates back.

514
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,670
The publisher guy's
giving a little speech,

515
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:29,610
And then they're gonna
eat. No, no, no, no.

516
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,580
I am not gonna lose my
cookbook career over this.

517
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:34,980
God.

518
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:47,530
Hand me that torch.

519
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:11,480
We're serving cobbler
in the parking lot!

520
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:23,100
I just made you real hot chocolate.

521
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,800
Don't I get a smile?

522
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:28,910
My son tried to ruin my career tonight.

523
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,110
I don't think I'll ever smile again.

524
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,310
Honestly,

525
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:36,180
I don't think Andrew had
anything to do with it.

526
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,920
You don't?

527
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:40,820
Mnh. Look at the planning
that went into it.

528
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:44,420
The vinegar had to be
substituted for the Sherry

529
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,320
After you'd selected the bottle

530
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,560
But before you'd left for the event.

531
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,830
And the ingredient had to be
something you wouldn't sample.

532
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,370
Come on. Andrew's not clever
enough to pull that off.

533
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:01,410
He can't even steal a case of
wine without getting caught.

534
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,950
Well, then who do you think did it?

535
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:07,520
Well, it'd have to be
somebody pretty smart...

536
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:10,290
At least smart enough to get an mba.

537
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,220
Sam? That's ridiculous.

538
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,120
Why would he want to hurt me?

539
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,520
Who said he wanted to hurt you?

540
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,190
Andrew's the one taking this fall.

541
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:22,170
No, that's not possible.

542
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,100
What does he stand to gain?

543
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:27,970
Hmm. What a good question.

544
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,240
Enjoy your chocolate.

545
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,530
Every once in a while,

546
00:29:37,531 --> 00:29:40,069
I catch Susan looking
at me this certain way.

547
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:43,200
You know, I'm putting on
my shirt or mowing the lawn.

548
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,670
I'll turn my head,

549
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:47,570
And I'll catch her with
this look in her eyes,

550
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:51,040
And I know she's thinking
that she's lucky to have me.

551
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:57,180
So how can I tell her I'm dead broke?

552
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,490
How can I say, "I can't take your money,

553
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,860
"Because it won't begin to cover

554
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:07,390
The debts I've been racking
up for the last year"?

555
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:10,860
She thinks it's a
couple of truck payments.

556
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,300
She's got no idea.

557
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:16,470
This would really hurt her.

558
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,470
If she found out I kept this from her,

559
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:22,370
I don't think I'd ever see
that look from her again...

560
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,580
And I can't let that happen.

561
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:31,950
Tell me how much you need.

562
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:43,460
Double capp, extra hot, right?

563
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,200
Wow. Good memory.

564
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:48,930
I haven't seen you for a while.
I thought maybe you left town.

565
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:52,270
Oh, I'm not leaving
till I finish my book.

566
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:55,140
Oh, right, yeah. How's that goin'?

567
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:57,610
Did the guy kill her?

568
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:02,080
I tried to write it that way.

569
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,650
He went over there. She was alone.

570
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,420
He had the chance.

571
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,420
And what happened?

572
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:15,660
Just seemed too easy.

573
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:20,270
So you stuck again?

574
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,000
No.

575
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:24,000
I've got a better idea.

576
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,400
If you think about it,

577
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:30,010
The worst part of what she
did was taking the kid, right?

578
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:34,910
So I figure

579
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:38,750
The best way for him to get revenge...

580
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:41,180
Is to take something from her.

581
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:44,920
But what could he take that's
gonna be as bad as what she did?

582
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:49,090
The kid.

583
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:51,960
He's gonna take the kid, right?

584
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
That's what I'm thinking.

585
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:13,350
He did.

586
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,439
I feel awful.

587
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,380
The more he thought about it,
he just couldn't let me do this.

588
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:23,450
And let's face it, he does have a say.

589
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,320
It's completely understandable,
Gaby. It was a lot to ask.

590
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:28,750
So where's Lee?

591
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:30,720
I wanna talk to him, too.

592
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,520
He left.

593
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:36,690
Left?

594
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:38,160
After Carlos came over,

595
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,900
Lee and I got into yet another fight,

596
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:42,570
And...

597
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,030
We broke up.

598
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,510
Are you kidding me?

599
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:52,710
Lee says he can't go through it again.

600
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,980
I'm determined to have a child,

601
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:58,450
So...

602
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,690
Is there anything I can do?

603
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,560
Oh, right.

604
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:08,590
Sorry.

605
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:12,500
It's okay, Gaby. Like I
said, it was a lot to ask.

606
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:33,220
My left shoe is missing. We'll find it.

607
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,709
I can't get married in
one shoe. Just get dressed.

608
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:37,430
The wedding starts in half an hour.

609
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,400
Hey, maybe he should wear sneakers.

610
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:42,300
It'd be wild, like
he's too cool to care.

611
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,670
Or I could-- I just
help him keep looking.

612
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,710
There you go.

613
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:51,180
Lynette! Help me look
for Preston's shoe!

614
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:53,040
Lynette?

615
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,690
What are you doing?

616
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:04,890
I need your help. Preston
can't find his shoe.

617
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,990
I put it in the oven.

618
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,220
Why?

619
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,190
Because that woman at immigration

620
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:11,730
Never called me back,

621
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,330
And I am screwed.

622
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:16,230
Oh, honey. Come on.

623
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:19,400
Hiding a shoe isn't gonna
stop them from getting married.

624
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,670
I know. I just wanted a few more minutes

625
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:25,080
Before I had to tell my son
I'm not going to his wedding.

626
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:28,280
I will not be a hypocrite, Tom.

627
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:30,450
I know how you feel.

628
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,750
But if you think irina's got power now,

629
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:35,720
Just you wait until you don't
show up to your son's wedding.

630
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,520
Oh, I wish...

631
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,530
I wish... I went to church more often.

632
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,400
I could really use a
favor from the man upstairs

633
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:46,360
Right about now.

634
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:52,430
Mrs. Scavo?

635
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:54,730
You're not gonna believe what I found.

636
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:56,970
I'll see you Sunday morning.

637
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,880
You look beautiful.

638
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,680
Mm. Thank you.

639
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,590
I am guessing this one's much nicer

640
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:19,220
Than your first wedding dress, you know,

641
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,390
When you got married in Russia to...

642
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:24,230
Alexei kosokov?

643
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,930
Here in America

644
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:32,400
We actually get divorced
before we get married again,

645
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,770
Otherwise you spend
your honeymoon in jail.

646
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,510
Alexei told me

647
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:41,410
If I marry him, he
will give me good life.

648
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:43,420
But he didn't.

649
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:45,350
He never worked.

650
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,950
He treat me badly.

651
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:50,060
Now he won't sign the divorce papers

652
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:52,660
Unless I give him money.

653
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:56,360
Okay.

654
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,160
That explains alexei.

655
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,780
What about...

656
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:05,950
The guy in Italy...

657
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:09,320
Who pressed charges after you
cleaned out his bank account?

658
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,120
That guy was a pig.

659
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,490
Believe me, I earned every Penny.

660
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:21,200
We have a term in America for
women who get paid for sex,

661
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:24,330
And it's not
"Daughter-in-law."

662
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,500
You know why it doesn't bother me

663
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:30,440
That you don't like me?

664
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:32,710
Can't wait.

665
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,940
Because it really doesn't matter.

666
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:37,610
All that matters

667
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:40,250
Is that one hour from now,

668
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,790
I will have a ring on this finger,

669
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,920
And I will be

670
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,690
The most important person in his life.

671
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:53,300
So give Preston your little file.

672
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:56,600
I will explain it all away,

673
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:01,130
And he will believe every word.

674
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,860
He always does.

675
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:11,440
Preston.

676
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,510
Mom, do you mind?

677
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:20,350
I need to talk to irina.

678
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:57,320
Your father told me you
called off the wedding.

679
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,060
Obviously, I think you
are doing the right thing.

680
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:05,530
I know you hate me right now,

681
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:09,000
And I just want you to know
that I am okay with that.

682
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,950
I love you so much.

683
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:23,320
I would rather have you resent me

684
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:26,020
Or even cut me off completely

685
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,960
Than to allow you to make a mistake

686
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:31,100
That could ruin your life. So go ahead.

687
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,370
Hate me for as long as you want,

688
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:39,070
And when you are done,
I will be here waiting.

689
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,440
Try not to take too long,
'cause I miss you already.

690
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,360
Hey. Where you going?

691
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,060
Motel,

692
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:16,130
Till I get flight out
of this horrible place.

693
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,700
What? The scavos couldn't
even give you a lift?

694
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:20,900
That's harsh.

695
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:22,900
I want nothing from the scavos.

696
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,370
They're dead to me.

697
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,810
Lucky for you,

698
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:31,550
I am not a Scavo.

699
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:44,330
Sorry about the wedding.

700
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,000
It's Preston's loss, man.

701
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:48,900
I mean, he'll never get
someone as hot as you again.

702
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:51,370
I don't want to talk about it.

703
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,370
Sure. You know, I get that.

704
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:57,670
You know, if you wanna save money,

705
00:39:57,710 --> 00:40:00,140
You could--you could
always skip the motel

706
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,350
And stay at my place.

707
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,450
I don't think so.

708
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,280
No, I promise,
no--no funny business.

709
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,720
I mean...

710
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:10,760
Unless you want some.

711
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:14,830
Yeah, I-I mean,
think of it as a--

712
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:17,700
As a transition relationship.

713
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:19,900
It'll help you get over Preston.

714
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:22,430
I-I have no problem
letting you use me--

715
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:23,770
Okay, enough.

716
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,970
I'm a little out of your
league, don't you think?

717
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:30,780
I mean, I didn't come to America

718
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:34,110
To end up with some
greasy-haired little boy.

719
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:49,660
What are you doing?!

720
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,030
Eddie?

721
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:20,800
<i>We all know that evil exists.</i>

722
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:24,600
<i>The newspapers are filled with stories</i>

723
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:28,770
<i>About young girls who suddenly vanish.</i>

724
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,840
<i>But we don't pay attention</i>

725
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:37,550
<i>Because we're worried
about our marriages...</i>

726
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:44,960
<i>Concerned about our friendships...</i>

727
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:52,530
<i>Anxious about our employees.</i>

728
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:59,510
<i>Yes, we don't pay attention to evil</i>

729
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:03,710
<i>Because we think it will
never come to our house.</i>

730
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,680
<i>But it does.</i>

731
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:09,010
Hey, Mrs. Scavo. I'm here
to pick up Porter for school.

732
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:10,280
<i>And sometimes...</i>

733
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:11,780
How you doin'?

734
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,220
Good.

735
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:15,490
<i>We let it in.</i>

736
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:18,690
