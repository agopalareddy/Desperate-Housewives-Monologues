1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:02,191
Previously on...

2
00:00:02,192 --> 00:00:04,059
Carlos' niece arrived.

3
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:05,928
We want you to be part of this family,

4
00:00:05,929 --> 00:00:07,763
but you will obey our rules.

5
00:00:07,764 --> 00:00:10,432
Lynette and Tom got big news.

6
00:00:10,433 --> 00:00:12,568
We're gonna have another baby.
Twins.

7
00:00:12,569 --> 00:00:15,504
You would actually send your wife to prison?

8
00:00:15,505 --> 00:00:18,107
My wife... no. My ex-wife... you bet.

9
00:00:18,108 --> 00:00:19,775
Orson resorted to blackmail.

10
00:00:19,776 --> 00:00:21,844
I think you're the most fascinating woman

11
00:00:21,845 --> 00:00:24,747
that I have ever met.
And Karl made his move.

12
00:00:24,748 --> 00:00:26,749
Katherine's marriage to Mike...

13
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,717
That woman I was with, tell her I had to go.

14
00:00:28,718 --> 00:00:31,120
It's an emergency.
Was put on hold.

15
00:00:31,121 --> 00:00:33,222
You guys are in danger. Get out of that car.

16
00:00:33,223 --> 00:00:35,057
Get away from Dave.

17
00:00:35,058 --> 00:00:38,360
and when the dust settled, wedding bells rang

18
00:00:38,361 --> 00:00:39,928
for someone.

19
00:00:44,267 --> 00:00:48,537
The veil was made from the finest silk.

20
00:00:50,373 --> 00:00:53,942
The garter was trimmed with handmade lace.

21
00:00:56,212 --> 00:01:00,282
The shoes were designed
by the top couturier in Milan.

22
00:01:00,283 --> 00:01:01,850
You see,

23
00:01:01,851 --> 00:01:06,155
the bride wanted only the best for her wedding day

24
00:01:06,156 --> 00:01:11,360
because she was about to marry
the best man in the world...

25
00:01:11,361 --> 00:01:14,163
for the second time.

26
00:01:14,164 --> 00:01:17,800
How do you feel?
Like the worst person in the world.

27
00:01:17,801 --> 00:01:19,735
Don't do this to yourself.

28
00:01:19,736 --> 00:01:22,104
Katherine is never gonna forgive me for this.

29
00:01:22,105 --> 00:01:25,140
Mom, this is your day.

30
00:01:25,141 --> 00:01:28,210
You and Mike were meant to be together.

31
00:01:28,211 --> 00:01:30,145
Wish me luck.

32
00:01:34,584 --> 00:01:37,853
Then by the power vested in me,

33
00:01:37,854 --> 00:01:39,488
I now pronounce you

34
00:01:39,489 --> 00:01:41,790
Husband and wife.

35
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:44,193
You may kiss the bride.

36
00:02:01,578 --> 00:02:03,545
Yes, the bride wanted

37
00:02:03,546 --> 00:02:06,014
the best wedding money could buy.

38
00:02:06,015 --> 00:02:10,886
But as she left the altar,
it suddenly occurred to her...

39
00:02:12,856 --> 00:02:16,024
Sorry I'm late. Did I miss anything?

40
00:02:16,025 --> 00:02:20,896
She should've spent more on security.

41
00:02:33,376 --> 00:02:36,945
It's not hard to find sin in the suburbs.

42
00:02:36,946 --> 00:02:40,983
Just look behind closed doors.

43
00:02:40,984 --> 00:02:43,018
That's where you'll find your neighbors

44
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:45,420
cheating on their taxes...

45
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,758
and drinking too much vodka...

46
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:54,530
and stealing their father's magazines.

47
00:02:54,531 --> 00:02:58,634
Yes, the suburbs are filled with sinners,

48
00:02:58,635 --> 00:03:01,670
some of who occasionally... repent.

49
00:03:01,671 --> 00:03:04,640
We can't do this.

50
00:03:04,641 --> 00:03:06,074
It's adultery.

51
00:03:06,075 --> 00:03:08,477
Luckily, we're both adults.

52
00:03:08,478 --> 00:03:10,913
Mmm. Stop! I'm married.

53
00:03:10,914 --> 00:03:14,683
Yes, to a man who's blackmailing you.

54
00:03:14,684 --> 00:03:16,652
Don't you think making love
to your divorce lawyer

55
00:03:16,653 --> 00:03:19,154
would be a nifty way to get back at him?

56
00:03:19,155 --> 00:03:20,489
Mmm.

57
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,091
Oh, Karl. No. No!

58
00:03:23,092 --> 00:03:25,561
No.
What now?

59
00:03:25,562 --> 00:03:27,563
If I'm gonna break a commandment,

60
00:03:27,564 --> 00:03:29,498
I don't want it to be for a quickie on this couch.

61
00:03:29,499 --> 00:03:32,367
Who said quickie? I've got
40 minutes before my 10:00.

62
00:03:32,368 --> 00:03:36,939
And thou shalt get sweaty.
I wanna do this. I do. But not here.

63
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,941
I need to feel special.

64
00:03:38,942 --> 00:03:40,943
But you are special.

65
00:03:40,944 --> 00:03:42,611
Are you saying

66
00:03:42,612 --> 00:03:45,447
You've never made love to
another woman on this couch?

67
00:03:45,448 --> 00:03:47,516
Not a special woman.

68
00:03:47,517 --> 00:03:49,117
Okay. All right.

69
00:03:49,118 --> 00:03:51,086
I get it. I get it.

70
00:03:51,087 --> 00:03:53,488
I want this to be nice for you. I'll find us a hotel.

71
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:56,024
Call me later when you've set something up.

72
00:03:56,025 --> 00:03:56,992
Done.

73
00:03:56,993 --> 00:03:58,327
Ahem.

74
00:03:58,328 --> 00:04:02,097
And just so we're clear, this visit was not billable.

75
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:07,436
Morning. I'm late for school.
I don't have time for breakfast.

76
00:04:07,437 --> 00:04:09,438
At least take a muffin.

77
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,573
Thank you, Uncle Carlos.

78
00:04:11,574 --> 00:04:14,543
Kind of warm for a sweatshirt, isn't it?

79
00:04:14,544 --> 00:04:17,312
Oh, it gets really cold in the classroom.

80
00:04:17,313 --> 00:04:19,248
Mm. Stop.

81
00:04:20,984 --> 00:04:23,819
Lift it up.
Gaby.

82
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,854
Girls who spend an hour on makeup

83
00:04:25,855 --> 00:04:29,224
do not wear baggy sweatshirts. Lift it.

84
00:04:32,495 --> 00:04:35,998
Well, that oughta heat up the classroom.

85
00:04:35,999 --> 00:04:39,234
Go and change.
Gaby, what is your problem?

86
00:04:39,235 --> 00:04:41,503
All the girls in my class dress like this.

87
00:04:41,504 --> 00:04:43,438
That's why your school nurse is an obstetrician.

88
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:46,875
Wear something else.
Fine. I'll borrow one of your tops.

89
00:04:48,278 --> 00:04:50,012
It might be exciting

90
00:04:50,013 --> 00:04:52,147
for it to go someplace
besides the supermarket.

91
00:04:53,249 --> 00:04:56,151
Oh, snap!

92
00:04:56,152 --> 00:04:57,919
Hey, you I can hit.

93
00:05:01,557 --> 00:05:04,359
Do you see what I have to put up with?

94
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,962
It was just a shirt.
Yeah?

95
00:05:06,963 --> 00:05:09,731
And when she came home past
curfew, it was just 40 minutes.

96
00:05:09,732 --> 00:05:12,467
And when she took money
from my purse, it was just $5.

97
00:05:12,468 --> 00:05:16,405
Why do you always make excuses for her?
She's had a sad life.

98
00:05:16,406 --> 00:05:18,473
Her mom's in jail. Her dad walked out.

99
00:05:18,474 --> 00:05:21,109
Yeah, yeah, she's one dead dog
away from a country song.

100
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,078
I don't care.
Well... 

101
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:25,080
Maybe she would calm down

102
00:05:25,081 --> 00:05:28,150
if she felt a little more secure here.
I'm not signing those papers.

103
00:05:28,151 --> 00:05:31,586
We need to be her legal guardians.
And look after her for the next two years? No.

104
00:05:31,587 --> 00:05:34,189
Until I see a change in her behavior,

105
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:36,358
I'm keeping all my options open.

106
00:05:36,359 --> 00:05:39,061
Is this better?

107
00:05:39,062 --> 00:05:41,430
Yes. Very nice. Thank you.

108
00:05:43,266 --> 00:05:45,667
Stop.

109
00:06:05,054 --> 00:06:07,823
Mmm. What do I smell?

110
00:06:07,824 --> 00:06:12,294
Despair. Mortality. Paralyzing fear.

111
00:06:12,295 --> 00:06:15,130
Oh. I thought it was waffles.

112
00:06:15,131 --> 00:06:18,133
Do you realize that when
these twins finish high school,

113
00:06:18,134 --> 00:06:20,035
I'll be in my 60s?

114
00:06:20,036 --> 00:06:21,670
No.

115
00:06:21,671 --> 00:06:24,606
No, you'll be in your, uh...

116
00:06:24,607 --> 00:06:26,007
Huh.

117
00:06:26,008 --> 00:06:27,642
At their graduation,

118
00:06:27,643 --> 00:06:30,679
I will be the crazy old lady
with oatmeal on her chin.

119
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,547
Look, I know this wasn't planned,

120
00:06:32,548 --> 00:06:34,716
but we... we can do this.

121
00:06:34,717 --> 00:06:38,053
I mean, we had a lot of fun
raising the first four kids.

122
00:06:38,054 --> 00:06:41,256
But we were done, Tom.
We were across the finish line.

123
00:06:41,257 --> 00:06:43,258
No more diapers.

124
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:45,394
No more strained carrots.

125
00:06:45,395 --> 00:06:48,296
No more reading stupid "goodnight, moon"!
Lynette... 

126
00:06:48,297 --> 00:06:50,232
And with Preston going to Europe,

127
00:06:50,233 --> 00:06:52,334
we even had one moving out!

128
00:06:52,335 --> 00:06:54,302
We will never be done

129
00:06:54,303 --> 00:06:57,739
if we birth two every time one moves out!

130
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,242
That's just math!

131
00:07:01,978 --> 00:07:04,613
Eight and half months to go.

132
00:07:04,614 --> 00:07:06,348
Yay.

133
00:07:11,754 --> 00:07:14,322
Are you all right?

134
00:07:14,323 --> 00:07:16,291
You know what's funny?

135
00:07:16,292 --> 00:07:18,727
I was never able to picture us old together,

136
00:07:18,728 --> 00:07:21,930
sitting on the porch, gray hair.

137
00:07:21,931 --> 00:07:23,498
I tried,

138
00:07:23,499 --> 00:07:25,434
But I could never see it.

139
00:07:25,435 --> 00:07:28,303
I'm sorry.

140
00:07:30,873 --> 00:07:33,475
Oh, Katherine, you don't have to... 
Mike, please.

141
00:07:33,476 --> 00:07:35,977
I don't need another reminder of you.

142
00:07:45,054 --> 00:07:48,256
So... how'd it go? How was she?

143
00:07:48,257 --> 00:07:50,759
She was... Okay.

144
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,694
"Okay"? What does that mean?

145
00:07:52,695 --> 00:07:54,563
I mean, did you tell her everything?

146
00:07:54,564 --> 00:07:56,598
Did you tell her we're getting married?

147
00:07:56,599 --> 00:07:59,367
Yeah. I think she's trying to take the high road.

148
00:07:59,368 --> 00:08:02,337
The high road? Um, as in,
"I wish you and Susan the best"?

149
00:08:02,338 --> 00:08:05,173
Or the high road as in, "when I cut Susan's brake line,

150
00:08:05,174 --> 00:08:07,709
she'll careen off the high road"?

151
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:11,446
Well, she knows it's over, and she's dealing with it.

152
00:08:11,447 --> 00:08:14,883
Mm, that must have been really hard for you.

153
00:08:16,484 --> 00:08:18,785
Yeah, it was.
Mm.

154
00:08:18,786 --> 00:08:22,389
But now that she knows, it'll be
easier when you talk to her.

155
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,458
Me talk to her?

156
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:26,093
Uh, why? Why? Why?

157
00:08:26,094 --> 00:08:28,361
I... you're the one who was dating her,

158
00:08:28,362 --> 00:08:31,331
I'm... I just... I don't...

159
00:08:31,332 --> 00:08:33,366
I think we're good now.

160
00:08:33,367 --> 00:08:37,003
Honey, you're gonna have
to deal with her at some point.

161
00:08:37,004 --> 00:08:39,272
Fine. Yes, I will. I will.

162
00:08:39,273 --> 00:08:42,309
Um, just, uh, not today, 'cause
today Julie's coming home

163
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:44,845
and, uh... you know, I wanna get her settled in.

164
00:08:44,846 --> 00:08:46,646
So... what about tomorrow?

165
00:08:46,647 --> 00:08:48,648
Ooh, that's not good either,

166
00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:51,418
'cause Julie and I are gonna
pick out my wedding dress.

167
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:53,453
You live right across the street from her.

168
00:08:53,454 --> 00:08:55,622
You can't avoid her for the next 50 years.

169
00:08:55,623 --> 00:08:57,157
Well, not 50.

170
00:08:57,158 --> 00:09:00,026
Just till she's too old to throw things.

171
00:09:00,027 --> 00:09:02,195
Don't worry about it.

172
00:09:03,598 --> 00:09:06,700
I think Katherine's really gonna surprise you.

173
00:09:25,852 --> 00:09:28,087
All of the windows are triple pane energy efficient.

174
00:09:28,088 --> 00:09:29,789
Oh, and I should mention the hardwood floors were

175
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:32,425
completely redone recently. Black walnut.

176
00:09:32,426 --> 00:09:34,727
It's nice.

177
00:09:36,296 --> 00:09:38,431
So do you have any questions for me?

178
00:09:38,432 --> 00:09:41,701
Nah, I think you pretty much got it covered.

179
00:09:41,702 --> 00:09:44,603
Really? Check me out!

180
00:09:44,604 --> 00:09:48,007
I'm... I'm new at this. I just got
my broker's license last week.

181
00:09:48,008 --> 00:09:50,309
Congratulations.

182
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,278
It's a pretty nice house for your first listing.

183
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:54,280
I got really lucky. The woman who handled

184
00:09:54,281 --> 00:09:56,115
the properties in the neighborhood... 

185
00:09:56,116 --> 00:09:59,185
she slammed her car into a pole
and got fried by a power line.

186
00:09:59,186 --> 00:10:01,954
Like I said, congrats.

187
00:10:01,955 --> 00:10:04,156
Uh, Mrs. Bolen's been awfully quiet.

188
00:10:04,157 --> 00:10:08,728
So what do you think?
Me? I'm thinkin' you're full of crap.

189
00:10:08,729 --> 00:10:09,996
I'm sorry?

190
00:10:10,397 --> 00:10:12,398
Well, the fact that we can afford this place

191
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,333
says to something is wrong with it.

192
00:10:14,334 --> 00:10:15,834
So, uh, start talkin'.

193
00:10:15,835 --> 00:10:18,036
Mold? Termites? Leaky roof?

194
00:10:18,037 --> 00:10:21,573
Honestly, I have told you everything that I know.

195
00:10:21,574 --> 00:10:24,410
Sure, you could play it like that.

196
00:10:24,411 --> 00:10:28,614
But if we do buy this place
and it turns into a money pit,

197
00:10:28,615 --> 00:10:31,617
I'm gonna need to take my anger out on someone.

198
00:10:31,618 --> 00:10:34,586
Like maybe the realtor who made a big deal

199
00:10:34,587 --> 00:10:37,523
out of telling us he lives right across the street?

200
00:10:38,924 --> 00:10:40,925
Okay, well, I don't know

201
00:10:40,926 --> 00:10:42,627
that this is actually considered a flaw,

202
00:10:43,028 --> 00:10:46,965
but a while ago, uh, the lady who was living here... 

203
00:10:46,966 --> 00:10:48,601
she was apparently going
through kind of a tough time,

204
00:10:48,602 --> 00:10:52,804
and long story short, she committed suicide.

205
00:10:55,507 --> 00:10:58,142
Shot herself...

206
00:10:58,143 --> 00:11:00,311
in... in the head.

207
00:11:02,014 --> 00:11:04,716
In this room.

208
00:11:04,717 --> 00:11:06,050
That's it?

209
00:11:06,051 --> 00:11:07,385
Well, yeah.

210
00:11:09,622 --> 00:11:12,090
We'll take it.

211
00:11:12,091 --> 00:11:14,659
Really? Oh, that is so... that is... 

212
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,262
Okay, I'll just... I'll just get the paperwork.

213
00:11:24,737 --> 00:11:26,537
It's a nice place.

214
00:11:26,538 --> 00:11:29,207
I think we could be happy here.

215
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:32,176
Right, Danny?

216
00:11:32,177 --> 00:11:34,879
Why are you asking me?

217
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,749
I didn't want to move here.

218
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,484
Oh, honey.

219
00:11:39,485 --> 00:11:41,953
Whose fault was that?

220
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:48,660
Julie! Look at you!

221
00:11:58,955 --> 00:12:02,391
Oh, Angie, these are incredible.
what do you call 'em again?

222
00:12:02,392 --> 00:12:04,927
Pizzelles. Come on, eat up. I made six dozen.

223
00:12:04,928 --> 00:12:07,062
My grandmother's recipes
were always for 30 people.

224
00:12:07,063 --> 00:12:09,665
Trust me, she'd fatten you four up in a week.

225
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:12,501
These go straight to your ass.

226
00:12:12,502 --> 00:12:13,969
Hmm.

227
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:16,505
Okay. I'm sorry. Do you guys not say "ass"?

228
00:12:16,506 --> 00:12:18,040
Sure, we do.

229
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,908
Come on, Bree. Show her.

230
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:22,411
So, uh, Susan tells me

231
00:12:22,412 --> 00:12:24,613
that your son is about to start college.

232
00:12:24,614 --> 00:12:26,882
Mm-hmm. We're just dealing with some paperwork,

233
00:12:26,883 --> 00:12:29,218
but he should be startin' sometime next week.

234
00:12:29,219 --> 00:12:31,186
Oh, I thought he was already in class.

235
00:12:31,187 --> 00:12:33,822
Uh, he asked julie to tutor him in math.

236
00:12:33,823 --> 00:12:35,190
Really?

237
00:12:35,191 --> 00:12:37,059
Oh, that must be Katherine.

238
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,560
I'll get it.

239
00:12:38,561 --> 00:12:41,630
Katherine? Y... you didn't say
Katherine was coming.

240
00:12:41,631 --> 00:12:43,699
She's just dropping something off.

241
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,568
What's the matter? You've seen
her since this Mike thing.

242
00:12:46,569 --> 00:12:49,304
Oh, yeah... sorta.
Your voice just got very high.

243
00:12:49,305 --> 00:12:51,173
You have talked to her, haven't you?

244
00:12:51,174 --> 00:12:53,876
I'm... going to.

245
00:12:53,877 --> 00:12:56,311
I've just been so busy with all the wedding plans.

246
00:12:56,312 --> 00:12:59,014
Yeah, I wouldn't open with that.

247
00:12:59,015 --> 00:13:00,315
Hi.

248
00:13:00,316 --> 00:13:02,017
I'm just dropping off the menu

249
00:13:02,018 --> 00:13:04,520
for the Davenport anniversary party.

250
00:13:04,521 --> 00:13:08,156
You finished that? Already?
It's three months away.

251
00:13:08,157 --> 00:13:11,692
Well, I have a lot of free time on my hands these days.

252
00:13:11,693 --> 00:13:13,094
Hello, Susan.

253
00:13:13,095 --> 00:13:15,563
Oh!

254
00:13:15,564 --> 00:13:18,132
Hi, Katherine.

255
00:13:18,133 --> 00:13:20,034
How... how are you doing?

256
00:13:22,037 --> 00:13:25,573
Haven't seen you in a while.
Well, I've been...

257
00:13:25,574 --> 00:13:28,376
using the back door a lot more lately.

258
00:13:29,845 --> 00:13:32,046
Katherine, your buttons...

259
00:13:32,047 --> 00:13:33,548
Oh!

260
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:38,819
I don't know where my head is anymore.

261
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:52,065
Whoa. Was it just me or was that
the most awkward moment ever?

262
00:13:52,066 --> 00:13:54,334
You bet your sweet ass it was.

263
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:03,342
Hon, could you get me
a glass of water, please?

264
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:04,877
You got it.
Thanks.

265
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:12,852
It's our first.
Yeah, I got that.

266
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:14,287
How about you?

267
00:14:14,288 --> 00:14:17,123
Four at home, two on the way.

268
00:14:17,124 --> 00:14:20,226
Oh, big family. You're so blessed.

269
00:14:21,662 --> 00:14:25,364
I just can't imagine anything
better than being a mommy.

270
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:28,501
Really?

271
00:14:28,502 --> 00:14:30,870
I mean, I know it's a lot of work,

272
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:34,006
but luckily my husband
plans to be really hands-on.

273
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:36,843
Yeah. That's not gonna happen.

274
00:14:37,694 --> 00:14:39,594
Pardon?

275
00:14:39,595 --> 00:14:41,463
Oh, he'll be there at first,

276
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,332
maybe even change a diaper or two

277
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:45,968
until the novelty wears off.
But those 4:00 a.m. Feedin

278
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:48,070
he said he'd help out with? Forget it.

279
00:14:48,071 --> 00:14:50,939
Oh, you don't know my Johnny. He's different.

280
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,841
Does he have boobs?

281
00:14:52,842 --> 00:14:54,476
No.

282
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:56,878
Then you're the only bar in town.

283
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:58,847
That baby can scream into a bullhorn,

284
00:14:58,848 --> 00:15:00,682
and Johnny won budge.

285
00:15:00,683 --> 00:15:03,752
Okay.

286
00:15:03,753 --> 00:15:05,821
Thanks.

287
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,923
I'm not done.

288
00:15:07,924 --> 00:15:09,491
You see this?

289
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,393
You'll never wear a bikini again.

290
00:15:11,394 --> 00:15:14,663
But you've had four kids, and you look good.

291
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,665
You haven't seen me naked.

292
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,134
My stomach looks like spanish stucco.

293
00:15:19,135 --> 00:15:20,902
And my breasts resemble

294
00:15:20,903 --> 00:15:22,804
two balloons you'd find behind the couch

295
00:15:22,805 --> 00:15:24,740
a week after the party.

296
00:15:24,741 --> 00:15:26,541
You know, most women say

297
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:29,144
this is the greatest experience of their life.

298
00:15:29,145 --> 00:15:30,445
Most women are liars.

299
00:15:30,446 --> 00:15:32,948
My mother was liar, and her mother was a liar,

300
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:35,117
and your mother is a liar.

301
00:15:35,118 --> 00:15:36,952
It's a lie every generation
tells the next

302
00:15:36,953 --> 00:15:39,755
so they can get grandchildren.
Please stop talking to me.

303
00:15:40,456 --> 00:15:43,424
No, you need to hear this.
You have to be prepared.

304
00:15:43,425 --> 00:15:46,094
Your children will hit you and steal from your purse.

305
00:15:46,095 --> 00:15:49,230
Your husband will begin to buy your birthday presents

306
00:15:49,231 --> 00:15:50,765
at the car wash.

307
00:15:50,766 --> 00:15:53,234
And the kicker,for the rest of your life,

308
00:15:53,235 --> 00:15:56,237
there will be so many moments when you feel lonely,

309
00:15:56,238 --> 00:15:59,507
but you will never be alone.

310
00:16:02,077 --> 00:16:04,011
They were out of water.

311
00:16:04,012 --> 00:16:06,614
Is juice okay?

312
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,989
Hormones. Get used to it.

313
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:18,259
I cannot believe we are finally going to do this.

314
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:21,329
You're not an easy woman to pin down,

315
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:25,299
but I sure am going to enjoy trying.

316
00:16:29,805 --> 00:16:31,238
What?

317
00:16:31,239 --> 00:16:33,541
This is not what I was expecting.

318
00:16:33,542 --> 00:16:37,244
Hey, I think I look pretty good for my age.

319
00:16:37,245 --> 00:16:39,647
Not you, Karl. The room.

320
00:16:39,648 --> 00:16:42,083
It's filthy and hideous.

321
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,552
Well, I took you to a nice hotel last week,

322
00:16:44,553 --> 00:16:46,754
and we had to leave 'cause you saw someone you knew.

323
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:49,657
Who we gonna run into here?
Well, certainly not a cleaning lady.

324
00:16:49,658 --> 00:16:52,393
Okay, so it's a little dusty. 

325
00:16:52,394 --> 00:16:55,029
But trust me, once I get started, you'll never even notice.

326
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:57,998
My God, those sheets! What's wrong with them?

327
00:16:57,999 --> 00:17:01,702
They're discolored, threadbare
and reek of industrial bleach.

328
00:17:01,703 --> 00:17:04,605
You give me five minutes, they'll reek of us.

329
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:07,108
Karl, I'm not gonna lie on that revolting sheet,

330
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,610
wondering how many junkies have died on it.

331
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,645
What do you want me to do about it?

332
00:17:13,881 --> 00:17:16,516
Ooh, egyptian cotton!

333
00:17:16,517 --> 00:17:19,886
These are pretty, aren't they?
Great. Love 'em. Let's go.

334
00:17:19,887 --> 00:17:22,889
It doesn't help when you say
that about every single set.

335
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,891
Bree, an hour ago, I was half-naked.

336
00:17:24,892 --> 00:17:27,761
Now I'm sheet shopping.
Forgive me if I'm an easy sell.

337
00:17:27,762 --> 00:17:30,597
I'm just not sure this color will match the carpet.

338
00:17:30,598 --> 00:17:32,532
Well, get 'em in blue.

339
00:17:32,533 --> 00:17:34,434
I'll tell you what they'll match then.

340
00:17:34,435 --> 00:17:36,136
Fine. I'll take these.

341
00:17:36,137 --> 00:17:38,305
Now we just need to stop for some flowers.

342
00:17:39,006 --> 00:17:40,139
Flowers?

343
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,742
I just want this affair to be nice.

344
00:17:44,778 --> 00:17:47,980
You know, you don't want this affair to be nice.

345
00:17:47,981 --> 00:17:49,982
You don't want it at all.

346
00:17:49,983 --> 00:17:52,418
Don't be silly. Of course I do.

347
00:17:52,419 --> 00:17:54,620
You may think you do,

348
00:17:54,621 --> 00:17:56,622
but I've been chasing you for two weeks,

349
00:17:56,623 --> 00:17:58,591
and you've down nothing but throw up roadblocks.

350
00:17:58,592 --> 00:18:03,095
"Not tonight." "Not this hotel." "Not those sheets."

351
00:18:03,096 --> 00:18:06,332
Karl, if you think I've been
leading you on, you're wrong.

352
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:09,935
Bree, it's not your fault. It's just who you are.

353
00:18:09,936 --> 00:18:11,904
You're a good girl who never breaks the rules

354
00:18:11,905 --> 00:18:14,640
no matter how miserable it makes her.

355
00:18:14,641 --> 00:18:17,810
I thought a little Karl time
might brighten your day.

356
00:18:17,811 --> 00:18:19,712
But there's not much I can do for someone

357
00:18:19,713 --> 00:18:22,014
who would rather be good than happy.

358
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:34,160
Can I help you?

359
00:18:34,161 --> 00:18:36,696
I've got a delivery for Susan Mayer,

360
00:18:36,697 --> 00:18:39,932
but she's not home.
Do you mind signing for her?

361
00:18:39,933 --> 00:18:44,170
Oh. That must be her gown.

362
00:18:44,171 --> 00:18:46,205
Of course I'll take it.

363
00:18:46,206 --> 00:18:48,974
We do things like this for each other all the time.

364
00:18:48,975 --> 00:18:51,043
In fact, just last month,

365
00:18:51,044 --> 00:18:53,145
she took in something of mine.

366
00:19:07,385 --> 00:19:09,085
Oh, God.

367
00:19:09,086 --> 00:19:11,721
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

368
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,329
Um, Katherine, it's me.

369
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:22,298
I... I've just come over to pick up my...

370
00:19:25,569 --> 00:19:27,203
Hello, Susan.

371
00:19:27,204 --> 00:19:29,873
Okay, I did not see that coming.

372
00:19:29,874 --> 00:19:31,875
It's just so beautiful.

373
00:19:31,876 --> 00:19:34,010
I couldn't resist.

374
00:19:34,011 --> 00:19:36,680
Well...

375
00:19:36,681 --> 00:19:39,716
thank you for taking such good care of it.

376
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,887
But I should probably go now,

377
00:19:43,888 --> 00:19:47,557
so if you just wanna slip it off and...

378
00:19:47,558 --> 00:19:50,660
Oh, wait. I have to check on my sauce.

379
00:19:52,363 --> 00:19:53,930
Sauce?

380
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,333
Mmm!

381
00:19:57,334 --> 00:20:00,103
Doesn't that smell good?

382
00:20:00,104 --> 00:20:02,504
It smells done.

383
00:20:04,374 --> 00:20:07,343
Why don't you step away from the pot?

384
00:20:07,344 --> 00:20:09,979
Oh, no. The secret is you have to keep stirring.

385
00:20:13,283 --> 00:20:14,817
You know,

386
00:20:14,818 --> 00:20:16,886
I really love this fabric.

387
00:20:16,887 --> 00:20:18,687
It feels so expensive.

388
00:20:18,688 --> 00:20:21,123
It is.

389
00:20:21,124 --> 00:20:23,726
That's why they had it all protected

390
00:20:23,727 --> 00:20:27,329
With that acid-free tissue paper
and plastic garment bag.

391
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,331
Huh.

392
00:20:29,332 --> 00:20:30,933
Maybe...

393
00:20:30,934 --> 00:20:34,303
I should give you some of this sauce to take to Mike.

394
00:20:35,972 --> 00:20:38,207
He used to love my sauce.

395
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:40,176
Of course,

396
00:20:40,177 --> 00:20:42,144
He used to love me, too.

397
00:20:45,348 --> 00:20:49,652
Okay, enough with the sauce.
I want my dress back now.

398
00:20:58,193 --> 00:21:01,129
Of course. I'm sorry. Can you please unzip me?

399
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:02,397
Mm.

400
00:21:08,737 --> 00:21:11,172
It really is a beautiful dress.

401
00:21:14,555 --> 00:21:17,077
Katherine was actually wearing the dress?

402
00:21:17,078 --> 00:21:20,347
Yes! Stop blocking my light.
Keep blotting.

403
00:21:20,348 --> 00:21:22,449
Ugh! Mom, relax. We got all the sauce.

404
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:25,386
No, I still see flecks of red.
It's your third wedding.

405
00:21:25,387 --> 00:21:27,154
An all-white dress is gonna be a stretch anyway.

406
00:21:27,155 --> 00:21:27,856
Do me a favor.

407
00:21:27,857 --> 00:21:29,792
Save the "my mom's a slut" jokes for the toast.

408
00:21:30,993 --> 00:21:34,328
You think I should go talk to her again?
What? Why?

409
00:21:34,329 --> 00:21:36,831
Well, she's obviously hurting more than I thought.

410
00:21:36,832 --> 00:21:38,799
Excuse me, she kidnapped my wedding dress

411
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,002
and held a pot of sauce to its head!

412
00:21:41,003 --> 00:21:43,804
How could you possibly defend her?

413
00:21:43,805 --> 00:21:46,707
I'm not defending her. I'm just
a little concerned. Aren't you?

414
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:49,143
No! I mean... yes, I was.

415
00:21:49,144 --> 00:21:52,947
But at this point, I'm a little sick of her.

416
00:21:52,948 --> 00:21:55,916
Do you know that when I told
people that I'm getting married,

417
00:21:55,917 --> 00:21:57,518
no one says congratulations.

418
00:21:57,519 --> 00:21:59,987
They all say, "oh, my God. Is Katherine okay?

419
00:21:59,988 --> 00:22:00,589
How's Katherine?"

420
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:03,392
Does no one remember that you were with me first?

421
00:22:03,393 --> 00:22:07,594
She stole my leftovers. Does nobody remember that?

422
00:22:07,595 --> 00:22:09,829
Did she just refer to me as leftovers?

423
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:12,499
My point is that I didn't do anything wrong.

424
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,135
You and I have a child,

425
00:22:15,136 --> 00:22:18,438
and I am just tired of feeling like the other woman.

426
00:22:21,692 --> 00:22:24,694
Scary part is, of the two women you could marry,

427
00:22:24,695 --> 00:22:27,563
that's the stable one.

428
00:22:29,064 --> 00:22:30,532
Thanks for taking me to the store.

429
00:22:30,533 --> 00:22:33,669
I promised Roy I'd make him meatloaf.
Oh, I think it's sweet

430
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:35,839
that you found a male companion
at this stage in your life.

431
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,976
Roy's no companion. The man has seen Paris.

432
00:22:41,145 --> 00:22:43,513
That's right. I'm back in the saddle.

433
00:22:43,514 --> 00:22:46,116
It started one night
when roy asked

434
00:22:46,117 --> 00:22:48,418
if my bathtub was big enough for two... 

435
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:51,521
Hey! You want me to crash the car? 'Cause I will.

436
00:22:58,696 --> 00:23:00,263
Hey, Aunt Gaby.

437
00:23:00,264 --> 00:23:01,564
Need your car washed?

438
00:23:01,565 --> 00:23:04,267
Oh! I'm Aunt Gaby now?

439
00:23:04,268 --> 00:23:06,503
Let me guess. You want something.

440
00:23:06,504 --> 00:23:09,038
Well, there is a party tomorrow night...

441
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,340
Really?!

442
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:17,879
Okay, you can go.

443
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,848
Seriously?

444
00:23:19,849 --> 00:23:22,884
Well, if you can make an effort around here,

445
00:23:22,885 --> 00:23:26,355
then I guess I can, too. Just be home by 10:00.

446
00:23:26,356 --> 00:23:29,257
Yeah, that's the thing.

447
00:23:29,258 --> 00:23:32,394
The party doesn't start till 11:00.

448
00:23:32,395 --> 00:23:34,630
What kind of party starts at 11:00?

449
00:23:34,631 --> 00:23:35,599
This new dance club is opening downtown,

450
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,401
and it is, like, the hottest thing ever.

451
00:23:38,402 --> 00:23:41,971
Everybody's going. Not everybody.

452
00:23:41,972 --> 00:23:44,207
It's a school night, and you know the rules.

453
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:46,342
But thank you for washing the car.

454
00:23:53,315 --> 00:23:55,316
Well, she's quite the charmer.

455
00:23:55,317 --> 00:23:56,385
Do you see what I'm dealing with?

456
00:23:56,386 --> 00:23:58,221
I mean, Carlos and I basically took her off the street.

457
00:23:58,222 --> 00:24:01,258
You'd think she'd be grateful.
But every day is a battle.

458
00:24:01,259 --> 00:24:03,093
I don't know how to get through to her.

459
00:24:03,094 --> 00:24:05,595
Teenage girls... they're the best
reason for not having kids.

460
00:24:05,596 --> 00:24:07,664
Thank God Roy had a vasecTomy.

461
00:24:13,101 --> 00:24:16,904
So based on the data given for this population,

462
00:24:16,905 --> 00:24:19,073
and using the standard deviation formula,

463
00:24:19,074 --> 00:24:21,542
what do you think this variable is?

464
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:25,079
Would you like to go to a movie sometime?

465
00:24:27,816 --> 00:24:30,617
It's not like it would be a date or anything.

466
00:24:30,618 --> 00:24:33,387
We're friends, right?

467
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:35,355
Friends go to movies all the time.

468
00:24:35,356 --> 00:24:37,891
I don't know if you know that.

469
00:24:37,892 --> 00:24:39,593
Did you know that?

470
00:24:41,196 --> 00:24:44,531
I did know that.

471
00:24:44,532 --> 00:24:46,366
Okay.

472
00:24:46,367 --> 00:24:47,434
Really?

473
00:24:48,837 --> 00:24:50,504
That's great.

474
00:24:50,505 --> 00:24:53,640
Hey, Julie. Nice to see you again.

475
00:24:53,641 --> 00:24:56,443
Danny, do me a favor and
take the trash out, will ya?

476
00:24:56,444 --> 00:24:59,646
Uh... can I do it a little later?

477
00:24:59,647 --> 00:25:01,648
Uh, yeah. Yeah, you could,

478
00:25:01,649 --> 00:25:04,084
but I think you're gonna do it right now.

479
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:11,225
Hey, thanks for doing that.

480
00:25:11,226 --> 00:25:12,559
Doing what?

481
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,828
Not shooting him down.

482
00:25:14,829 --> 00:25:17,364
I know he's probably not your type.

483
00:25:17,365 --> 00:25:20,567
No, I like him. He's nice.

484
00:25:20,568 --> 00:25:23,570
Well, yeah, yeah, but, uh...

485
00:25:23,571 --> 00:25:25,571
clearly not in your league.

486
00:25:30,257 --> 00:25:32,158
I'm sorry you have to work late, sweetie.

487
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,594
Don't worry about us. Everything is fine here.

488
00:25:34,595 --> 00:25:37,030
Good night, Ana.

489
00:25:37,031 --> 00:25:39,232
Oh! Sorry.

490
00:25:51,045 --> 00:25:53,013
Ana paid me $5.

491
00:26:04,992 --> 00:26:08,628
Ooh! Hey, muscles. I need a lift.

492
00:26:14,033 --> 00:26:16,168
Ooh! Hey! Hands! Hands! Hands!

493
00:26:31,584 --> 00:26:33,652
Um, excuse me!

494
00:26:33,653 --> 00:26:36,655
Sorry to interrupt. But can I
have your attention, please?

495
00:26:36,656 --> 00:26:38,824
Hello?

496
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:47,432
Okay. Hi. My niece is somewhere in this building.

497
00:26:47,433 --> 00:26:51,236
She's got brown hair, gold leggings, a cream top...

498
00:26:51,237 --> 00:26:53,271
which she took from my closet.

499
00:26:53,272 --> 00:26:56,308
So if you could just look around and point her out...

500
00:26:59,412 --> 00:27:02,414
No, hey, hey, this is important, okay? She's only 16.

501
00:27:02,415 --> 00:27:06,051
And she came here even though
she knew she wasn't supposed to.

502
00:27:09,555 --> 00:27:11,356
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

503
00:27:12,157 --> 00:27:14,158
Either you find my niece,

504
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,495
or I will call the cops with their drug-sniffing dogs.

505
00:27:22,165 --> 00:27:25,701
Found her over here!

506
00:27:25,702 --> 00:27:28,704
Here she is!
Stop. Put me down.

507
00:27:28,705 --> 00:27:30,606
Somebody...

508
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:33,375
Get your hands off me. Let me down.

509
00:27:33,376 --> 00:27:35,244
God, what are you doing?
Ugh.

510
00:27:36,214 --> 00:27:38,348
Thank you, everybody.

511
00:27:38,349 --> 00:27:40,784
Put the music back on.

512
00:27:40,785 --> 00:27:43,086
I told you not to mess with me.

513
00:27:56,298 --> 00:27:57,500
I cannot keep doing this, ana.

514
00:27:57,501 --> 00:28:02,871
Or what? You're gonna throw me out?

515
00:28:02,872 --> 00:28:03,806
Fine.

516
00:28:05,575 --> 00:28:08,711
You'd actually be doing me a favor.

517
00:28:08,712 --> 00:28:10,646
I can take care of myself.

518
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:13,616
You're 16. How exactly are you gonna make money?

519
00:28:15,752 --> 00:28:17,353
I'm... I'm gonna be a model.

520
00:28:20,023 --> 00:28:21,590
A model?
Yeah.

521
00:28:21,591 --> 00:28:24,460
You know, people tell me that I'm pretty enough.

522
00:28:24,461 --> 00:28:26,996
I... will just... I'll go to Paris or New York,

523
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:28,331
and I'll get discovered.

524
00:28:28,932 --> 00:28:31,634
And I will be rich and famous,

525
00:28:31,635 --> 00:28:34,503
and no one will ever tell me what to do again.

526
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:38,507
And you really think it's
that easy to become a model?

527
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:39,908
It was for you.

528
00:28:39,909 --> 00:28:42,778
What, you left home when you were only 15.

529
00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:45,614
No, I left because I had to.
My stepfather was...

530
00:28:45,615 --> 00:28:47,683
Not a nice man.

531
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,585
My mother didn't care about me.

532
00:28:49,586 --> 00:28:52,354
My father left when I was 3,

533
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:55,991
and my mother's been in and
out of prison ever since.

534
00:28:55,992 --> 00:28:57,960
I can beat you at this game.

535
00:28:57,961 --> 00:29:01,263
This is not a game, Ana! This is your life.

536
00:29:01,264 --> 00:29:03,132
You can't scare me, all right?

537
00:29:03,133 --> 00:29:06,268
And I don't stay where I'm not wanted.
Oh, don't give me that.

538
00:29:06,269 --> 00:29:08,570
We feed you. We put a roof over your head.

539
00:29:08,571 --> 00:29:12,541
And you're also keeping all your options open.

540
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:15,044
Yeah.

541
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:16,412
I heard.

542
00:29:26,353 --> 00:29:27,289
Oh, good, you're back.

543
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:28,558
The girls haven't made a peep.

544
00:29:34,096 --> 00:29:35,664
Gaby?

545
00:29:48,778 --> 00:29:50,846
No more options.

546
00:29:50,847 --> 00:29:52,948
I am now officially your guardian.

547
00:29:52,949 --> 00:29:54,883
So... what?

548
00:29:54,884 --> 00:29:56,685
I'm supposed to hug you now?

549
00:29:56,686 --> 00:29:59,154
No, you're not gonna want to hug me,

550
00:29:59,155 --> 00:30:01,156
because from here on out,

551
00:30:01,157 --> 00:30:03,458
I am gonna be watching you like a hawk.

552
00:30:03,459 --> 00:30:06,528
I wanna know where you are
going, who you are going with,

553
00:30:06,529 --> 00:30:08,697
and when you are coming home.

554
00:30:08,698 --> 00:30:11,299
And I'm gonna keep you from ruining that life

555
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,235
you are so anxious to start living.

556
00:30:13,236 --> 00:30:16,271
You are so mean.

557
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:17,706
Yeah.

558
00:30:17,707 --> 00:30:21,009
And I wish...

559
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:23,678
I wish...

560
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:28,316
Someone had been this mean
to me when I was your age.

561
00:30:41,129 --> 00:30:43,130
Danny, look, it's complicated.

562
00:30:43,131 --> 00:30:46,133
No, it's really simple, Julie.

563
00:30:46,134 --> 00:30:48,235
You only care about yourself.

564
00:30:48,236 --> 00:30:49,905
Please let me explain!
Go to hell.

565
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:04,964
Katherine said you were here.

566
00:31:05,165 --> 00:31:07,366
And I thought, since you were already in church,

567
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:08,968
we might see the pastor

568
00:31:08,969 --> 00:31:11,036
and schedule some counseling sessions.

569
00:31:11,037 --> 00:31:12,905
I don't need counseling, Orson. I need a divorce.

570
00:31:12,906 --> 00:31:15,074
Don't tell me we don't need counseling.

571
00:31:15,075 --> 00:31:17,743
You've been sleeping in the guest
room for weeks. It's not right.

572
00:31:17,744 --> 00:31:20,079
I agree, and if you had

573
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,616
an ounce of chivalry, you'd
have given me the master.

574
00:31:23,617 --> 00:31:25,651
You might think that withholding sex

575
00:31:25,652 --> 00:31:27,453
will make me give up on us.

576
00:31:27,454 --> 00:31:29,889
But I can be very patient.

577
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:31,690
You do realize in prison,

578
00:31:31,691 --> 00:31:34,026
I went three whole years without any sex.

579
00:31:34,027 --> 00:31:36,195
No, but thank you for clearing up a question

580
00:31:36,196 --> 00:31:38,397
I never quite knew how to ask.

581
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:41,100
Bree, eight years ago,

582
00:31:41,101 --> 00:31:43,035
we stood at an altar like this,

583
00:31:43,036 --> 00:31:45,905
and we made a vow before God to love each other.

584
00:31:45,906 --> 00:31:48,741
Do you think I haven't struggled with this?

585
00:31:48,742 --> 00:31:51,810
I've struggled with this in ways
you can't even begin to imagine.

586
00:31:51,811 --> 00:31:54,880
Then let me help you.
I can make you happy again.

587
00:31:56,181 --> 00:31:59,116
How? By blackmailing me?

588
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:02,053
I'm not your wife anymore, Orson. I'm your captive.

589
00:32:02,054 --> 00:32:04,488
Don't you feel any remorse at all over that?

590
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:06,290
Of course I do,

591
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:08,025
but sometimes guilt

592
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:10,328
is a small price to pay for happiness.

593
00:32:17,636 --> 00:32:20,538
There it is. Baby number one.

594
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:23,975
Oh, my God. It was so worth
cutting class to hear this.

595
00:32:23,976 --> 00:32:26,777
And... there's number two.
Good, strong heartbeats.

596
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,346
Isn't that great, Lynette?

597
00:32:31,216 --> 00:32:34,485
Yeah. Terrific.

598
00:32:34,486 --> 00:32:37,521
I'll...

599
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:40,057
Get the nurse, have her come clean you up.

600
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:42,560
Thank you.

601
00:32:45,896 --> 00:32:47,499
So what's with you?

602
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,833
What?

603
00:32:50,834 --> 00:32:52,702
That was an amazing moment,

604
00:32:52,703 --> 00:32:56,306
and you just sat there
like y... you didn't even care.

605
00:32:58,242 --> 00:33:00,043
I'm just tired.

606
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:02,011
Look, I know this has been a shock,

607
00:33:02,012 --> 00:33:04,981
and I'm trying to give you time,
but it's been three months.

608
00:33:04,982 --> 00:33:08,618
When are you gonna start
getting excited about our kids?

609
00:33:16,727 --> 00:33:18,027
What?

610
00:33:26,236 --> 00:33:28,338
I don't love them.

611
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:34,711
Lynette.

612
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:38,214
Please. Don't look at me that way.

613
00:33:40,017 --> 00:33:42,585
If I can't talk to you about this,

614
00:33:42,586 --> 00:33:45,021
then I am in big trouble.

615
00:33:45,022 --> 00:33:48,625
You're just upset because... this wasn't planned.

616
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:50,660
None of them were planned,

617
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:53,162
but I loved each of our kids

618
00:33:53,163 --> 00:33:56,466
the moment I knew they were coming.

619
00:33:56,467 --> 00:34:00,536
It's different this time.

620
00:34:00,537 --> 00:34:03,873
I don't love these babies.

621
00:34:07,177 --> 00:34:09,212
Stop saying that.

622
00:34:12,316 --> 00:34:14,183
When you hold them in your arms,

623
00:34:14,184 --> 00:34:16,085
you will care about these kids

624
00:34:16,086 --> 00:34:19,222
just as much as the others.

625
00:34:25,462 --> 00:34:27,296
Okay.

626
00:34:43,955 --> 00:34:47,290
I think I left something in the car. I'll see you inside.

627
00:34:53,764 --> 00:34:55,632
Bree.

628
00:34:55,633 --> 00:34:57,600
Orson will drink too much today,

629
00:34:57,601 --> 00:35:00,503
like he always does at weddings. He'll be asleep by 9:00.

630
00:35:00,504 --> 00:35:03,006
Meet me at the Shangrila Motel at 9:30.

631
00:35:03,007 --> 00:35:06,176
And you won't bail on me again?
I booked the room last night.

632
00:35:06,177 --> 00:35:08,745
I've already changed the sheets
and cleaned the bathroom.

633
00:35:08,746 --> 00:35:10,213
Kiss me.

634
00:35:15,653 --> 00:35:17,587
What happened to the good girl?

635
00:35:17,588 --> 00:35:19,089
She decided guilt's

636
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:21,791
a small price to pay for happiness.

637
00:35:25,696 --> 00:35:27,263
Ahh.

638
00:35:27,264 --> 00:35:30,000
Frankly, I think it looked better on me.

639
00:35:30,001 --> 00:35:32,135
Katherine.

640
00:35:33,136 --> 00:35:35,537
What are you doing here?

641
00:35:35,538 --> 00:35:38,674
You may have noticed that
I've been out of sorts lately,

642
00:35:38,675 --> 00:35:40,876
and I just couldn't understand why.

643
00:35:40,877 --> 00:35:43,812
I mean, sure, I was dumped by the love of my life,

644
00:35:43,813 --> 00:35:45,781
but it was more than that.

645
00:35:45,782 --> 00:35:47,416
And then it hit me.

646
00:35:47,417 --> 00:35:49,018
My friend... 

647
00:35:49,019 --> 00:35:51,787
who was sort of responsible
for my world imploding... 

648
00:35:51,788 --> 00:35:55,157
never bothered to cross the street

649
00:35:55,158 --> 00:35:57,026
to see how I was doing.

650
00:36:04,801 --> 00:36:06,835
Didn't have the...

651
00:36:06,836 --> 00:36:09,671
decency to apologize.

652
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:15,844
I am very, very... 

653
00:36:15,845 --> 00:36:18,347
No, not here. Out there.

654
00:36:18,348 --> 00:36:21,516
In the hallway?
In your ceremony.

655
00:36:21,517 --> 00:36:24,586
Everybody in town knows you humiliated me.

656
00:36:24,587 --> 00:36:27,723
I think I deserve a public apology.

657
00:36:29,125 --> 00:36:31,793
In the middle of my wedding?

658
00:36:31,794 --> 00:36:34,262
I found the perfect spot, right here.

659
00:36:34,263 --> 00:36:36,331
After the reading of ecclesiastes

660
00:36:36,332 --> 00:36:39,668
and right before "we've only just begun."

661
00:36:39,669 --> 00:36:41,870
I am not doing that.

662
00:36:41,871 --> 00:36:43,572
Yes, you will,

663
00:36:43,573 --> 00:36:46,508
or I will create a scene so ugly

664
00:36:46,509 --> 00:36:48,577
your guests will still be talking about it

665
00:36:48,578 --> 00:36:50,145
On your golden anniversary.

666
00:36:57,618 --> 00:36:59,486
Okay.

667
00:37:01,555 --> 00:37:05,057
But I am not happy about this.

668
00:37:05,058 --> 00:37:07,994
Aw. Try to smile anyway.

669
00:37:07,995 --> 00:37:09,862
Nobody likes a grumpy bride.

670
00:37:09,863 --> 00:37:13,666
Why don't we just get this over with?

671
00:37:13,667 --> 00:37:16,102
Would you mind getting my gloves?

672
00:37:16,103 --> 00:37:18,037
They're in the garment bag.

673
00:37:21,208 --> 00:37:23,409
Aah!

674
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:25,278
I'm sorry.

675
00:37:25,279 --> 00:37:27,180
It's just until after the ceremony.

676
00:37:27,181 --> 00:37:28,548
Susan!

677
00:37:28,549 --> 00:37:32,752
And from this day forward,

678
00:37:32,753 --> 00:37:34,754
you shall be each other's home.

679
00:37:34,755 --> 00:37:37,223
You shall be each other's sanctuary.

680
00:37:37,224 --> 00:37:40,593
Susan, let me out!

681
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:44,597
With this ring,

682
00:37:44,598 --> 00:37:47,066
I thee wed.

683
00:37:57,211 --> 00:37:59,846
Aah!

684
00:38:10,724 --> 00:38:14,093
Sorry I'm late. Did I miss anything?

685
00:38:14,094 --> 00:38:16,796
What the hell? What are you doing here?

686
00:38:16,797 --> 00:38:19,465
Susan knows.

687
00:38:22,903 --> 00:38:25,705
Look, I don't know what you want,

688
00:38:25,706 --> 00:38:28,774
but I'm asking you nicely to leave.

689
00:38:31,144 --> 00:38:33,913
And if you don't, so help me God,

690
00:38:33,914 --> 00:38:36,983
I will drag you out of this church myself.

691
00:38:47,827 --> 00:38:49,528
I'm sorry. I...

692
00:38:51,097 --> 00:38:52,965
I... I just wanted... 

693
00:38:59,806 --> 00:39:01,573
I'll go.

694
00:39:01,574 --> 00:39:03,642
Katherine, wait.

695
00:39:05,045 --> 00:39:08,113
Uh... Oh.

696
00:39:12,185 --> 00:39:14,520
Uh... hello, everybody.

697
00:39:14,521 --> 00:39:16,855
I just wanna say something.

698
00:39:18,291 --> 00:39:21,260
Oh, we don't need this on the video.

699
00:39:21,261 --> 00:39:23,162
Um...

700
00:39:23,563 --> 00:39:26,031
when Mike asked me to marry him...

701
00:39:26,032 --> 00:39:27,899
again,

702
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,869
it was one of the happiest days of my life.

703
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:32,838
But for someone else,

704
00:39:32,839 --> 00:39:36,742
it was the day her whole world fell apart.

705
00:39:36,743 --> 00:39:39,044
And I have to admit, I...

706
00:39:39,045 --> 00:39:40,846
I didn't care.

707
00:39:43,015 --> 00:39:45,751
In that moment, I was a selfish person,

708
00:39:46,752 --> 00:39:49,787
and I chose my happiness.

709
00:39:49,788 --> 00:39:52,423
But I want you all to know

710
00:39:52,424 --> 00:39:55,025
That I am truly sorry

711
00:39:55,026 --> 00:39:57,027
for changing her path.

712
00:39:57,028 --> 00:39:58,662
And I hope

713
00:39:58,663 --> 00:40:00,898
That Katherine Mayfair finds happiness

714
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:04,568
and can find it in her heart to forgive me...

715
00:40:07,105 --> 00:40:09,073
and be my friend again.

716
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:23,788
I hope that helped.

717
00:40:23,789 --> 00:40:26,056
Honestly...

718
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:27,858
It didn't.

719
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:49,379
Where the hell is Danny?

720
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,748
He left the wedding two hours
ago and he's not in his room.

721
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:55,118
He'll be home soon.
You know, what has gotten into that kid?

722
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,154
He's staying out late, pickin' fights with girls in public.

723
00:40:58,155 --> 00:41:00,957
He knows better than that.
He's a teenager.

724
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,592
Well, go look for him.

725
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:07,197
We can't afford to make waves here.

726
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:10,800
Everyone has to think we are nice, normal people.

727
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:12,669
Yeah.

728
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:26,916
It's not hard to find sin in the suburbs.

729
00:41:27,917 --> 00:41:31,453
Just look behind closed doors,

730
00:41:31,454 --> 00:41:34,089
And you'll find your neighbors

731
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:36,191
Cheating on their husbands....

732
00:41:39,996 --> 00:41:42,631
Resenting their children...

733
00:41:46,302 --> 00:41:49,037
Plotting against their friends.

734
00:41:52,575 --> 00:41:55,077
But as much as we like to talk about

735
00:41:55,078 --> 00:41:59,381
The sinful things people do...

736
00:42:00,817 --> 00:42:04,553
We forget there is a difference between sin...

737
00:42:04,554 --> 00:42:06,622
and evil.

738
00:42:19,269 --> 00:42:23,739
Sadly, there's always someone willing to come along

739
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:26,108
and remind us.

740
00:42:26,109 --> 00:42:28,109
