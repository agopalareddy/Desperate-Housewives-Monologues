00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,830
<i>Previously on Desperate Housewives...</i>

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,810
A friendship was torn apart.

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:06,090
I care about my friends.

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,230
Sorry you are no longer
a part of that group.

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,660
- Need to talk to you.
- What?Here?

6
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:13,580
Bree's affair was revealed to Orson.

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,030
Mona threatened Angie.

8
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:19,200
You've got till tomorrow to come up with
the rest of the money, or I go to the police.

9
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,650
And then tragedy struck.

10
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:23,910
Celia!

11
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,740
I'm at the site of a bizarre
accident that happened just hours...

12
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:45,460
If you watch the news tonight, you will be told all
about a tragedy that occurred on a quiet suburban street.

13
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,790
You will hear eyewitness
accounts of the crash.

14
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,560
You will learn the extent of the damage.

15
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:57,710
But the news can't
tell you who survived.

16
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:02,080
Because no one yet knows... For sure.

17
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,880
Oh, Susan, thank God you're here.

18
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:12,790
I was on my way home. I
got this text from Julie.

19
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:14,870
- She said a plane crashed onto the lane?
- Yeah.

20
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,730
A single-engine plane that had
to make an emergency landing.

21
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,120
The pilot had a heart attack.

22
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:21,540
Julie said Karl was taken
away in an ambulance?

23
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,160
Yeah. He's in surgery.

24
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,920
H-how bad is it?

25
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,050
He's gonna make it, right?

26
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,750
There was a lot of bleeding.

27
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,110
The doctors are doing the best they can.

28
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,980
You want to sit down?
Here. H... have a seat.

29
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,050
Come here.

30
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,630
Was anyone else hurt?

31
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,030
Orson... and Mona Clarke.

32
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,670
Yeah, they're still in surgery.

33
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,510
Bree got a little banged up, but
the nurse says she's gonna be okay.

34
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,110
And little Celia might
have a concussion.

35
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,890
Oh... what... what happened?

36
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:52,100
The plane was headed straight for her, and
Lynette ran over and pushed her out of the way.

37
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,190
You saved her life.

38
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,670
Come on. You would have done the same
thing for my kids. It's no big deal.

39
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,240
No, Lynette, we owe you everything.

40
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,960
So what do we do now?

41
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,400
I guess we just wait and pray.

42
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,420
I think that's a really good idea.

43
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,970
Lynette, are you okay?

44
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:25,340
I don't know. I just...
I have this terrible pain.

45
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:32,600
The truth is, no one knows who
survived that tragic plane crash...

46
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,470
Oh, Tom, I think there's
something wrong with the babies.

47
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:40,850
Or more importantly, who didn't.

51
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,300
Any word about Karl?

52
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,740
Uh, still in surgery.

53
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:08,280
God, I feel like such a hypocrite.

54
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:11,660
After that guy cheated
on you, I hated his guts.

55
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,110
Never spoke to him again.

56
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,600
And I was just in the
chapel praying for him.

57
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,210
I know what you mean.

58
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:25,130
It's pretty complicated for me, too.

59
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,690
With that, Susan began to
think of her marriage to Karl...

60
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,130
how wonderfully it had started...

61
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:39,450
How they'd been so happy...

62
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:48,150
Until the day she found lipstick
where she shouldn't have.

63
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:56,510
Susan then thought of the day she
told Karl to leave, and she wondered...

64
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:59,700
What if she hadn't?

65
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,820
Wait. Wait! Don't go.

66
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,050
You just kicked me out.

67
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,150
I know.

68
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:14,860
I put 12 years of my life into this
marriage, and we have a daughter.

69
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,030
We owe it to Julie to
try to work this out.

70
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,400
Aw, Susie.

71
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,140
Don't touch me.

72
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,550
You're still a pig.

73
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:34,170
Okay, so, um, if we are gonna put this behind us, I need to
know about everyone that you've seen with since we were married.

74
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,560
Everyone?

75
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:39,870
I don't think this is a good idea.

76
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:45,680
Karl, I don't want to be wondering, when we go to
a party or a restaurant, "did he sleep with her?"

77
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,270
"Her? Her?"

78
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,240
okay. Well, you found out about Brandy.

79
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,910
Yes.

80
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,190
It was nice to put the
panties with a face.

81
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,600
Go on.

82
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:04,840
Well, before her... let's see... it
was Amber, the dental hygienist...

83
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,970
Kwan Lee, the massage lady...

84
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:14,350
Oh, remember when we had cable installed, and
you wondered why we got so many channels for free?

85
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,570
Okay, you know what?

86
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,430
Uh, maybe you were right.

87
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,880
It's good to have some
secrets between a couple.

88
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,620
Why don't you just go
upstairs and unpack your stuff?

89
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,620
I will learn how to swallow my rage.

90
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:28,830
You are not gonna regret this.

91
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,570
Hey there. I'm Mike Delfino.

92
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,990
Oh, yes.

93
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:13,300
We met at, um, Mary Alice's funeral.

94
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:17,040
Uh, your husband told me
you have a clogged sink.

95
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,990
Oh, yeah. Come on in.

96
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:31,290
So how you liking the
neighborhood so far?

97
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:34,530
I lit. It seems quiet... friendly.

98
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,060
It is. And safe.

99
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,810
I bet we have the lowest
crime rate in America.

100
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:41,670
You need to get that?

101
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,700
Nah. Let the machine get it.

102
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,780
It's Susan and Karl.

103
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,250
Leave us a message.

104
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:51,670
Hey, Suse. It's me. Listen,
I'm gonna be working late.

105
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:53,110
Don't hold dinner for me.

106
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:56,550
By the way, the switchboard's gonna
be closed, so don't bother calling.

107
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,740
Love ya.

108
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,780
- He's screwing his secretary.
- Huh?

109
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,710
My husband.

110
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:07,480
Thinks he's fooling me.

111
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,450
He's not.

112
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,980
I'm sorry.

113
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:27,290
You know, uh, what would serve him right... to
come home and find me in bed with another man.

114
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,750
- Yeah, I gotta go.
- What's the rush?

115
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:34,660
Well, I've got to get a
part at the hardware store.

116
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,090
And they close at 6:00.

117
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:43,110
Oh, my God.

118
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,650
Am I that undesirable?

119
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:48,890
No, you're very desirable,
uh, i... in... in a big way.

120
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,690
Did you just call me fat?

121
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:54,560
No. No. I... I think
you're very beautiful.

122
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,010
It's just... you know, you're married.

123
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,340
Right.

124
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,930
Um... I'm sorry.

125
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:09,390
Look... if you're unhappy, you
should do something about it.

126
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,670
Oh, please. Not another business trip.

127
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,600
Oh, please.

128
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,590
Let it be another business trip.

129
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,370
I tried.

130
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,370
I'm sorry.

131
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,000
That's it?

132
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,750
15 years of marriage, and that's
all I get... two lousy sentences?

133
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,690
I don't know what else to say.

134
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:10,210
I don't know. How about, um, "hey,
Susan, "thanks for eating nothing

135
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:15,670
but broccoli and colon cleanser for the last six
months so you could lose weight and look good for me"?

136
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,100
Or, "hey, Susan, thanks for wasting the
best years of your life while I went out

137
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,380
and I banged everything with
a GED and a tramp stamp."

138
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,080
I'm sorry, okay?

139
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:31,610
But you could've spared yourself all this
pain if you'd just let me go the first time.

140
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,860
You really do deserve better, Susan.

141
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:59,340
Mrs. Delfino?

142
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:05,220
Karl didn't make it.

143
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,180
Oh, my God.

144
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:13,500
If there's anything you need,
we have counselors available.

145
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,580
N... no, I'll... I'll
be fine. Thank you.

146
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,720
I can't imagine what
you must be feeling.

147
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:36,450
Mostly I'm... I'm feeling grateful.

148
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:46,390
Bree Hodge was told about the death
of Karl Mayer at 6:12 that evening.

149
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,950
She became so hysterical,

150
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:52,890
she had to be sedated by 6:18.

151
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,180
It wasn't long before she fell asleep.

152
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:59,680
And then, she began to dream.

153
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,890
A dream about what her
life would have been like

154
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:07,490
if Karl hadn't died.

155
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:10,030
You are so corny!

156
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,220
No deviating from the marriage playbook.

157
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,160
I'm doing it right this time.

158
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:17,950
Happy?

159
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,810
Karl, you've made me happy in
ways I couldn't even imagine.

160
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,360
Now if it wouldn't be too much trouble,

161
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,710
would you mind pulling down my zipper
with your teeth and taking me on the table?

162
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,120
Nag, nag, nag.

163
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,350
What is it with you women
once you get a ring on?

164
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:36,890
Mm, and if you're a stickler for tradition,
we could always take it up to our bedroom.

165
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:40,020
Our bedroom... I like the sound of that.

166
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:45,180
Well, get used to it... Mm. Because it's
going to be our bedroom for a long, long time.

167
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:49,830
I meant what I said when I proposed.

168
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,360
Being with you is gonna make
me into a whole different man.

169
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:56,540
Well, I hope not completely different.

170
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:01,140
I don't ever want to lose that
sexy beast who swept me off my feet.

171
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:06,280
Trust me. He's not going anywhere.

172
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:10,730
Honey, that was fantastic.

173
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,370
Bree!

174
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,300
Oh, my God.

175
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,340
You're supposed to
be catering a wedding.

176
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,030
Yes, clearly this is my fault.

177
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,800
- Courtney?
- I'm so sorry, Bree.

178
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,240
Really, Karl, yoga instructor?

179
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:28,140
No charge for next month, okay?

180
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,280
Like I'm keeping you!

181
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,710
- Get the hell out of my house.
- She... she's going.

182
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:35,100
I'm not talking toher!

183
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,360
How could you, Karl? In our own bed?

184
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,760
Yeah, you're right. That was tacky.

185
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,440
I am so sorry.

186
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,370
- Bye.
- I'll call you.

187
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,870
- What?
- Sorry.

188
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,540
Uh, force of habit.

189
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:51,020
Look, this thing doesn't have to
mean any more than we decide it does.

190
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,370
You made a vow to me, Karl.

191
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,230
Oh, my God. Why did I
think I could change you?

192
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,220
Yeah, I know.

193
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:00,300
You thought you could turn me into
your personal lapdog, like Orson.

194
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:02,110
You leave Orson out of this.

195
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:05,360
Why? I haven't done a thing to
you that you didn't do to him.

196
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,940
Get out of my house!

197
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:11,220
- The truth hurts, doesn't it?
- Get out.

198
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:19,110
I didn't know who else to call.

199
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,640
You were his emergency contact.

200
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,330
I'm just a little surprised.

201
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:28,700
Orson and I hadn't spoken
in nearly ten years.

202
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:32,270
A... are you sure there wasn't someone
else in his life? A girlfriend maybe?

203
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,940
Never saw one.

204
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:38,660
In fact, in the seven years he lived
here, I never saw anybody visit him at all.

205
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:46,750
Um... Where did you... find him?

206
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,360
In the bed.

207
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,180
Paramedics said it was a heart attack.

208
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,630
He'd been there two days.

209
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,570
Can you imagine?

210
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:59,320
Just like that, you're
gone, and no one notices?

211
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,340
Poor Orson.

212
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:08,920
Well, take whatever you want. I'll
have, uh, goodwill pick up the rest.

213
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:48,550
You know, he spoke about you constantly.

214
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:51,960
It was always "Bree this", "Bree that."

215
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:56,090
- It was almost like he died of...
- What?

216
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:57,950
Say it.

217
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:02,100
Like he died of a broken heart.

218
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:10,650
Mrs. Hodge?

219
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:15,170
I just wanted to tell you
your husband's out of danger.

220
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:17,720
Thank God for that.

221
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:20,750
But there were some complications.

222
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:23,440
What kind of complications?

223
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:29,010
This is a preliminary assessment, but it seems
there has been some damage to his spinal column.

224
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:32,160
What does that mean exactly?

225
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:35,870
There's a good chance
your husband is paralyzed.

226
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,560
excuse me.

227
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,380
Can you tell me anything
about Mona Clarke's condition?

228
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:50,640
The doctors... they did everything they could,
but that woman... I mean, she was hit by a plane.

229
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,950
Oh, my God!

230
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:57,380
Now all we can do is wait and
hope that she pulls through.

231
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,740
Pulls through?

232
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,370
Yes. Your friend's a real fighter.

233
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,670
She's hanging in there.

234
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,460
How? She got hit by a plane!

235
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,270
The doctors couldn't believe it either.

236
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:08,830
I don't know if you're religious,
but now would be the time to pray.

237
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,700
Oh, believe me, we will.

238
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,270
Dear God, please take that
blackmailing bitch home now.

239
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,020
A frickin' plane hit her. What
is it gonna take, a silver bullet?

240
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,780
All right, look, I'm gonna go home,
pack up our stuff. You stay here.

241
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:25,620
If they pry the propeller out of that woman's mouth
and she starts yapping, get the hell outta here.

242
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:36,060
Just like that, Angie Bolen began
to consider what was happening.

243
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:43,400
She thought of the doctors trying to save
Mona and how long it might take her to recover.

244
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:53,950
Then she imagined Mona waking up... And
telling the police everything she knew.

245
00:16:54,540 --> 00:17:01,360
And Angie asked herself, what
would happen if Mona Clarke lived?

246
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,570
How about a little lunch, Ms. De Luca?

247
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,800
Eggplant parm.

248
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:16,280
Maybe it's not like the place we used to see
you go into on east 10th street, but not bad.

249
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,680
I want to see Nick.

250
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:22,060
He's a little busy at the moment.

251
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,370
I just want to talk to
him for a couple minutes.

252
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:28,800
As far as the Bureau is
concerned, Nick is a traitor.

253
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:31,590
Get used to it. You're never
gonna talk to him again.

254
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,480
What about Danny?

255
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,550
Tyler is with your mother.

256
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,330
But enough about what you want.

257
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:43,130
Here's what I want... Patrick Logan.

258
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,110
You need to be thinking
real clear right now.

259
00:17:57,170 --> 00:18:01,350
We know Logan ran everything, but
without him, it's all gonna fall on you.

260
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,540
I don't know where he is.

261
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,170
I haven't spoken to
him since that night.

262
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:11,160
You've been on the run 18 years, and you and your
former lover don't even exchange a phone call, huh?

263
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:16,150
Don't take this personally, Agent Padilla, but
you guys weren't the ones I was running from.

264
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,690
Look, I know Logan.

265
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,900
I know how scary he is.

266
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:26,110
But I think the situation
you're in now is worse.

267
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:31,890
Then you don't know how scary he is.

268
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:39,610
Federal sentencing guidelines
dictate the punishment in this case.

269
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:41,810
There's no room for
leniency from the court.

270
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:46,750
That being said, Ms. De luca, you have indicated
that you would like to address the court.

271
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,690
Thank you, Your Honor.

272
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,380
No one... was supposed to get hurt.

273
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:59,780
We just believed in something, and we wanted
to make other people believe in it, too.

274
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,240
But someone did get hurt.

275
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:07,210
A man died.

276
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:13,580
I read every newspaper article
about your husband, about Sean...

277
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:19,520
how he coached little league, that the
whole neighborhood came to his funeral.

278
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:22,960
I never lived in a world like that...

279
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:26,110
until we moved to Fairview.

280
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:31,060
I never felt like a part
of a community, which...

281
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:37,010
Made it so much clearer to me how horrible
it is that I brought so much pain to yours.

282
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,960
Please rise for sentencing.

283
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:53,750
Angela De Luca, you are hereby sentenced to life
imprisonment without the possibility of parole.

284
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:57,530
Marshals, remand the
prisoner to custody.

285
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:09,800
Ma? Ma!

286
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,910
So... how is she?

287
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:26,110
I'm... I'm so sorry.

288
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:28,960
She didn't make it.

289
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,390
I know how upset you must be.

290
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:37,620
Please don't be angry with God
because your prayers weren't answered.

291
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,400
Oh, don't worry about it, hon.

292
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:43,350
Me and God are good.

293
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:54,420
I spoke with the doctor. They are goingo
keep her overnight for observation.

294
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,790
I thought they said she was fine.

295
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,930
No, they're just being
extra cautious. That's all.

296
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,510
Look at her.

297
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:04,010
I feel bad even saying it, with
everything's that's happened,

298
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:07,100
but... we really lucked out, huh?

299
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,750
I don't think it was luck.

300
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,380
I think it was God.

301
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:13,420
Actually, it was Lynette.

302
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:15,500
No, Lynette was his instrument.

303
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,000
Either way, it was a hell of a tune.

304
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,980
No, I'm serious.

305
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,540
I think God saved Celia
because she's special.

306
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,180
She has a gift.

307
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:27,480
What kind of gift?

308
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,400
I'm not sure yet.

309
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:31,400
But she has one.

310
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,180
I know she's gonna do
something amazing with her life.

311
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:41,930
Fine. While you figure out how our daughter's
gonna change the world, I'm going to the cafeteria.

312
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:44,060
See you in a few.

313
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:51,750
As she lay there, Gabrielle began to
think of ways her daughter could shine.

314
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:57,120
She thought of music...

315
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,810
And sports...

316
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:07,120
And other creative pastimes.

317
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:15,070
And before she drifted off
to sleep, Gabrielle wondered,

318
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:20,090
what if her daughter was
destined to be a great actress?

319
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,530
Celia Solis.

320
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,070
How old are you?

321
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,860
5.

322
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,930
It's our first audition.
We're very excited.

323
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:35,340
Well, great. Such a cutie,
just what we're looking for.

324
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:36,660
Oh, she can be cuter.

325
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,720
Show him, honey.

326
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:42,240
Good girl.

327
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:46,570
Okay, Celia, this is a... here.

328
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,190
This is a commercial
for ouch away! Bandages.

329
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,650
Stand right there on the "T."

330
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:52,180
You just got a boo-boo on your finger.

331
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:55,470
You're gonna hold it up,
look real sad and cry, okay?

332
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,620
And go.

333
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,090
No, no. Don't smile, honey.

334
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,120
We need you to cry. Let's try it again.

335
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:11,250
Uh, okay.

336
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:13,340
Thank you... thank you very much.

337
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,600
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

338
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,170
You gotta give her another shot. Please.

339
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:19,700
I... I love the look, but
can I be honest with you, mom?

340
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,310
The side dish that came with
my lunch has more talent.

341
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,520
What are you saying?

342
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,150
I'm saying she's not as good
as coleslaw. Deal with it.

343
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,090
Hey, that little girl
is here for a reason.

344
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,620
She is going to inspire people,
and you are gonna be part of that!

345
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,880
All right. Well, hurry up.

346
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,900
All right. Hey, I got
you another chance.

347
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,600
Can you cry for mommy?

348
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,190
Sure you can.

349
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,360
When that nice casting man asks you to
hold up a finger, just hold it up and cry.

350
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,960
How easy is that?

351
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,170
Hello?

352
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,500
What?

353
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,920
Oh, my God.

354
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,320
Daddy fell and hurt himself.

355
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,040
I don't think he's gonna make it.

356
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:17,490
And... when he fell, he landed on your
hamster cage and crushed Mr. McFuzz.

357
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:20,440
He's dead. Mr. McFuzz is dead.

358
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,160
Okay.

359
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,410
Roll it.

360
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:37,750
Gaby, I'm going to take
Celia for an ice cream!

361
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,910
Be back in a bit!

362
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:44,220
Come on.

363
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,780
The bus for camp leaves in 20 minutes.

364
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,310
But what about my auditions?

365
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:50,410
Mommy's gonna kill us.

366
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,100
Hey, let me handle mommy.

367
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:54,690
You need a sleeping
bag to get ice cream?

368
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:56,550
Run!

369
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,580
Leave it. Leave it! Leave it!

370
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,010
What the hell are you
doing? We talked about this.

371
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:21,970
No summer camp. She's got auditions.

372
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:24,440
Gaby, you have got her living
in this weird little bubble,

373
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,500
and she needs to be
around kids her own age.

374
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:29,670
She will be. I'm taking her
to a casting call for "Annie."

375
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:32,510
Why can't you support her career?

376
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,320
Celia, will you wait in the car, please?

377
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:38,930
Thank you, sweetie.

378
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,450
Because she stinks.

379
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,920
That little girl is destined for
greatness. That is why God saved her.

380
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,920
God does not save people who stink.

381
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:55,200
Yeah, well, maybe God saved her so that she could go to
camp and make some friends and have a normal childhood!

382
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,640
Who would believe in a God like that?

383
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,150
Gaby, she's miserable.

384
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,750
No, she's not. She wants this.

385
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,520
No, she does it to please you!

386
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,120
That is a horrible thing to
say. I am not hurting her.

387
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:09,330
In fact, making her
shine is my life's work.

388
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,050
All I want is for people to
understand how special she is.

389
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:15,420
- Celia, get in the house!
- Celia, wait.

390
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:21,110
I'm sorry, but you have clearly lost your mind, and I'm not
gonna stand here and watch you ruin our daughter's childhood.

391
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,370
If you don't like it, leave.

392
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:29,030
Gaby, be careful what you say,
because I am very close to going.

393
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,850
See ya. Come on.

394
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,780
Let's go get ready for your audition.

395
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:36,880
You're gonna be the best Annie ever.

396
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:47,270
There you go, sweetie.

397
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:49,130
All better.

398
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:53,540
Ouch away! Adhesive bandages...
They heal with a mother's love.

399
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:58,390
Mama, no.

400
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,910
Look at that face.

401
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,390
That's a star.

402
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:04,240
You're not watching this again.

403
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:08,380
Now please, help me with the groceries.

404
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,320
Did you get my wrinkle cream?

405
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,860
You can't buy stuff like
that with food stamps.

406
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:18,080
I know. I just wish you
loved me enough to steal it.

407
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,300
Hello?

408
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,940
Jerry, sweetie.

409
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:32,880
Honey, it's your agent.

410
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:35,010
Oh, Celia's dying to work.

411
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,720
What do you got for us?

412
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:39,270
Oh, come on. There's gotta be something.

413
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,800
No, no. She's not too old.

414
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,430
She can pass for 15.

415
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,180
hell, I'm looking at her right now.

416
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,760
Okay, we'll be there.

417
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:50,090
Baby, we've got an audition.

418
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:52,420
And we gotta get that
hair into pigtails.

419
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,740
Ma, I think we need to talk.

420
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:56,710
What did I dowith those ace bandages?

421
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,650
We gotta flatten you down.

422
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,040
Listen to me.

423
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,110
I don't want to be an actress.

424
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:04,560
What? You can't quit. You're...

425
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:06,530
I'm special. This is my destiny.

426
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,720
It's why I was spared.

427
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:12,620
You spent the last 20 years
telling me I'm meant for big things.

428
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,120
And you are.

429
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,590
No.

430
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:18,440
I'm not special. I'm normal.

431
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:23,460
And I just want to have a normal
life... get married, have kids.

432
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:26,150
And there's gonna be
plenty of time for that.

433
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,420
You always say that.

434
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,990
Why can't you admit it's over?

435
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:38,600
Because if we give up, then everything
I've worked for is for nothing.

436
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:42,870
Your father walked out.
Your sister never calls.

437
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,420
This is all I have.

438
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:51,570
What time's the audition?

439
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:54,050
Tomorrow, 3:00.

440
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:57,360
Now let's do something about this hair.

441
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,550
Oh, honey, this is the one. I feel it.

442
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:03,420
One day you're gonna thank me.

443
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,820
I brought you coffee.

444
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,730
So have you figured out what our
4-year-old is gonna do with her life?

445
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:26,930
No.

446
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:30,440
But I did figure out what
she has to do to be special.

447
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:32,750
What's that?

448
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:39,900
Absolutely nothing.

449
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:46,950
How could this happen? I know I
fell, but I felt fine afterwards.

450
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:49,440
It doesn't take much to
cause a tear to the placenta.

451
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,180
But you said the one baby is fine?

452
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:53,710
Yes, but if we don't
operate on the other one,

453
00:29:53,760 --> 00:30:01,250
there could be a decrease in blood flow to the brain,
which could put the child at risk developmentally.

454
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:03,330
At risk how? Physically? Mentally?

455
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,880
Right now there's no way to know.

456
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:10,530
How soon can we do the surgery?

457
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:11,850
We're ready to go.

458
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:13,970
Let's get her in.

459
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:23,010
At that moment, Lynette began to
think of the baby she had yet to meet.

460
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:29,040
She thought of what it
would be like to hold him,

461
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:33,620
how it would feel to
look into his eyes...

462
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:38,320
And to kiss his tiny hand.

463
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:49,790
And then Lynette thought of what would happen if the
doctor told her that same beautiful child was disabled.

464
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:01,250
He especially hates
the hamstring stretches.

465
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:05,070
Well, and obviously it's hard to hear him
cry, but you really need to tune it out,

466
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,920
because without the therapy,
his muscle tone will...

467
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:11,580
You try. Maybe it's me.

468
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,260
Sometimes it helps to sing to them.

469
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:17,310
Oh, I do that. He
loves it when I do that.

470
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:21,610
And the sailor said,
"Brandy, you're a fine girl,

471
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:25,400
what a good wife you would be"...

472
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,010
Why don't we take a break?

473
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,600
Maybe we should take some time
and talk about where we're at.

474
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:36,070
Where we're at is we haven't
seen any milestones since August.

475
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:38,500
Not since he finally
started grabbing his feet.

476
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,860
- But that was a big one.
- Definitely.

477
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:43,400
But he should be sitting by now, right?

478
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:46,970
Or pulling to stand or crawling.

479
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:52,380
If you worry too much about whathe suld be able
to do by now or what other kids his age are doing,

480
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:54,500
it's gonna drive you crazy.

481
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:56,280
Fine.

482
00:31:56,350 --> 00:32:00,680
I know I keep saying this, but try
to focus on the progress he's making.

483
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,720
Like what?

484
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:04,640
You're with him every day.

485
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:06,480
You tell me.

486
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,850
What do you see?

487
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:21,890
- Would you, um, excuse us for a second?
- It's okay.

488
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,050
What is it?

489
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,930
- I can't do this.
- Can't do what?

490
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,270
This, her, the therapy, and the
injections and the equipment.

491
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,630
And no one can even tell
us if any of it is helping.

492
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:36,170
I think it is.

493
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:39,680
But even if it isn't, this is what
there is to do, so we're doing it.

494
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:41,280
Well, I can't.

495
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,470
No, you don't want to.

496
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:44,730
Neither do I.

497
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,820
Neither does he. Didn't you
hear him crying in there?

498
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,960
But we don't have a choice. So come on.

499
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:51,310
Jean's gotta go home soon.

500
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:55,910
I feel like I'm being punished,
and I don't even know what I did.

501
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,390
You can't think that way.

502
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,240
What else is there to think about?

503
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,480
Hopes for the future?

504
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,080
He might not even have one.

505
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:06,970
He's 14 months. Don't write him off yet!

506
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:13,240
But you should start thinking about the
future, because no matter what, it's coming.

507
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:16,310
And it's either gonna make
you less afraid or more,

508
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:21,350
and you willnow that you either did
everything that you can for your son...

509
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:25,490
Or you will be sorry.

510
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:32,670
Yeah. There we go.

511
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,490
I know.

512
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,430
Come here.

513
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:45,090
It's okay.

514
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,920
I can do this.

515
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:06,740
Hi, honey.

516
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:08,990
Can I have a sandwich?

517
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,830
Uh, sure.

518
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:13,700
I just have to finish these dishes.

519
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:16,740
But I'm hungry.

520
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:21,630
Well, unless you want soap on
rye, you're gonna have to wait.

521
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:41,830
Actually, why don't you
make yourself a sandwich?

522
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:44,950
But you always do it.

523
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:48,440
And you always watch me,
so I know you know how.

524
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,890
I'm tired.

525
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:53,330
So am I, and I still have
to vacuum and do the laundry.

526
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,690
My arms hurt.

527
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:56,660
I had to swim today.

528
00:34:56,770 --> 00:35:02,500
And you do that so you can get stronger,
so you can do things like make sandwiches.

529
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:05,260
Speaking of which, in the time
we've been arguing about this,

530
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:09,040
you could've... guess
what... made a sandwich.

531
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:12,320
So could you!

532
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:17,450
Jason's mom makes him whatever
food he wants, even french toast.

533
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:20,920
I would happy to make
Jason french toast, too.

534
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:23,430
He always tells me how pretty I am.

535
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:28,970
Not to mention, he's also in a wheelchair,
so he can't reach the shelves in the fridge.

536
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:31,390
But you can!

537
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:34,070
Too bad you don't appreciate it.

538
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,930
You're not... you're not really busy!

539
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,720
You just don't want to help me!

540
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,400
You know what? One day I won't be able
to help you because I won't be here,

541
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:49,300
and then maybe you'll understand why I
wanted you to learn to do stuff for yourself!

542
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,750
Or you won't!

543
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:00,530
But either way, I'm not
making you a sandwich.

544
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:59,080
That looks good.

545
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:03,120
Can I have a bite?

546
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:11,790
When I was born, my doctor told my parents
I wouldn't make it through the night,

547
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:19,120
then through the week, then it was that
I was blind, that I'd need a wheelchair.

548
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:26,930
I guess what I'm saying is...
I've really pissed my doctors off.

549
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:35,690
At first, my mother was scared...

550
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:41,760
scared of my disability, my limitations.

551
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,710
I know this because she told me.

552
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:49,380
Then she realized what
she was really scared of,

553
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:55,090
was my potential and that she's miss
something that would help me reach it.

554
00:37:56,660 --> 00:38:04,870
Gandhi said, "strength... does
not come from a physical capacity.

555
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:09,910
It comes from an indomitable will. "

556
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:13,340
My mother's probably
never heard that saying...

557
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:19,570
But every day of my life,
she showed me how true it is.

558
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:27,350
Now I... I hope I can start showing her.

559
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:33,170
Thank you.

560
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:38,060
Thank you all very much.

561
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,820
How's our baby?

562
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,850
Is he okay?

563
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:05,800
We lost the baby.

564
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:15,500
But... the other baby is fine.

565
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:21,230
It's okay.

566
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,610
We're gonna be okay.

567

569
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:02,270
I don't know how to say thank
you for saving my child's life.

570
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:07,630
And how sorry I am for...

571
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,000
We were gonne name it Patrick.

572
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:24,770
And he would have been amazing.

573
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:36,120
The funeral for Karl Mayer
was a dignified affair.

574
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:40,460
Attented by friends and family.

575
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:43,970
And those who loved him.

576
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:47,720
The priest spoke about
the nature of tragedy.

577
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:52,070
How it causes people to ask what if...

578
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:56,370
What if he hadn't died...

579
00:40:56,530 --> 00:41:00,730
What if I had chosen differently...

580
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:04,840
What if I had made that mistake...

581
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,390
And then the priest said

582
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:11,200
the best way to honor those who had died

583
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:14,330
was to focus on what was

584
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:19,400
and to keep on living
the best way we know how.

585
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:25,830
And in time, that is exactly
what my friends would do.
