1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:02,550
Previously on Desperate Housewives...

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:04,740
Why didn't you tell me you
were having money problems?

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,160
Susan made a difficult decision.

4
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,970
- You can't sell your house.
- We're not selling. We're renting.

5
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,620
Bree was blackmailed by Sam.

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,160
I'm talking about your son
running down Carlos' mother.

7
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,460
I want you to sign
over your company to me.

8
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,750
Patrick got what he needed

9
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,480
to force Angie to do what he wanted.

10
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:25,730
You're gonna make me another bomb.

11
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,480
But Angie managed to send
out a call for help...

12
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:35,060
and Lynette discovered
that Eddie was the killer.

13
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,900
In those first awful moments,

14
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,500
all Lynette Scavo could
think of were her children.

15
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,930
She thought of the moment
her daughter began to walk...

16
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,230
And the day her son
won the spelling bee...

17
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,480
And that time her twins
scared her with a frog.

18
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:08,000
Yes, this is what Lynette thought about...

19
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,160
While a disturbed young
man was holding her hostage.

20
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,720
Eddie, please.

21
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,040
Don't talk to me, Mrs. Scavo.

22
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,960
- I really need to think.
- I know you must be scared.

23
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,630
But I am your friend,
Eddie. I want to help.

24
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,560
Look, what... what... what can you do?

25
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:27,630
You can't do anything.

26
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:31,900
I can tell people what a mean,
angry drunk your mother was,

27
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,520
how she abused you,
how defenseless you are.

28
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,320
- You almost didn't have a choice.
- And what about the others?

29
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,090
What others?

30
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,780
The other girls I killed.

31
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,110
Oh.

32
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,420
Still think you can help me? Look...

33
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,080
I don't want to hurt you.

34
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,950
Look, we'll drive till we're
in the middle of nowhere.

35
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,680
I'll drop you off, and by the time

36
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,630
- you find anyone to tell, I'll be gone.
- No.

37
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,020
Look, I don't know what else to do.

38
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,260
- I can't have you going to the police.
- I can't go anywhere.

39
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,180
Yes.

40
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:13,520
All Lynette could think
about were her children...

41
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,620
My water just broke.

42
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:23,670
Especially the child she
was about to give birth to.

00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:39,170
Teresa Pruitt used to be a nurse.

45
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,720
For 33 years, she worked
in the maternity ward

46
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,720
at Fairview Memorial Hospital.

47
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:52,130
She spent her days caring
for newborn infants...

48
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:58,530
and looking after brand-new mothers.

49
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,680
It was a job she had
loved with all her heart.

50
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,330
But that was many years ago.

51
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:16,830
Now Teresa Pruitt was back
at Fairview memorial...

52
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,640
But this time as a patient...

53
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,580
A patient with a secret.

54
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:32,310
Hello, Teresa. I came as soon as I could.

55
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,040
I'm so sorry.

56
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:35,410
Don't be.

57
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:37,500
It's my time.

58
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:39,980
You're very brave.

59
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:44,990
Hmm, I wish that were true, father.

60
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,560
Did you know I used to be
a nurse in this hospital?

61
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:57,070
Yes. You just retired
a few years ago, right?

62
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,770
I didn't retire. I quit out of guilt.

63
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,350
What do you mean?

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,790
I did something awful.

65
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,620
Do you want to take confession?

66
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,280
No. Confessions are private,

67
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,370
and the people who run this hospital

68
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:19,080
need to know what I did...

69
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,970
because they have to make it right.

70
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,350
Oh! Excuse me.

71
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,950
I need to see Nick
Bolen. What room is he in?

72
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:34,710
Oh, I'm sorry.

73
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,700
Visiting hours don't start until 9:00.

74
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,850
Okay, but this is an emergency.

75
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,140
Ma'am, he just came in out of a coma.

76
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,730
Unless you're immediate family,
you need to come back at 9:00.

77
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,260
Okay, I get it.

78
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,970
You're just following the rules.

79
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:53,440
You're a nurse... an underpaid,
underappreciated nurse

80
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,780
who might need some help making ends meet.

81
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:01,490
So what do you say to... $12?

82
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,690
Oh, wait. I'm gonna need $10 for parking.

83
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,570
Ma'am.

84
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,430
How about gum? Do you like gum?

85
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:12,890
Come back later.

86
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,130
Hey, Lorna, Dr. Burke
needs you in radiology.

87
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,180
Thanks.

88
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,200
Hey! You with the ponytail.

89
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,850
- I gotta see Nick Bolen.
- Are you family?

90
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,110
Forget about it. I'm his wife Angie.

91
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,840
Really? Well, then who's that
blonde lady who's been here?

92
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:47,270
His whore?! She was here?
Oh, I'm having her whacked!

93
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,770
Oh, no! I could be wrong.

94
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,510
Maybe I should get my supervisor.

95
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,470
Do I look like I got time for supervisors?

96
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,780
I got sauce on the stove, ziti in the oven

97
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,510
and a mustache that needs
to get bleached. Let's go!

98
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,470
Come on! Let's go!

99
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,360
Thank you.

100
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:12,710
W... wow.

101
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:15,750
Did we... did we get
hammered last night or what?

102
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,740
No, you got hammered.

103
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,810
Preston and I just followed you
around apologizing to everyone.

104
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,020
Mm, another thing we
won't be telling your mom.

105
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,140
Hey, do you think I woke
her up when I came in?

106
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:27,540
- When you came in?
- Yeah.

107
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,820
No. When you jumped up on the coffee table

108
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:32,130
and sang "margaritaville"? Maybe.

109
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,030
Guys. I just checked on
mom, and she's not there,

110
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,160
and the bed looks like
it hasn't been slept in.

111
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,040
Oh, God. She did hear me.

112
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,480
Oh, she must have stormed
out of here first thing.

113
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,710
But why didn't she wake
you up and yell at you?

114
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:48,870
Have I been stabbed?

115
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,830
You're back. What happened with Sam?

116
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:00,310
And did you tell him his
services were no longer needed?

117
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,640
I tried to. He responded
by blackmailing me.

118
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:05,160
What?

119
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,200
He knows what happened to Mrs.Solis.

120
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,300
Gaby. What does she have to do with this?

121
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,870
I'm talking about Carlos' mother.

122
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,410
What happened to Carlos' mother?

123
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,270
Ten years ago, she died
after being hit by a car

124
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,110
that Andrew was driving.

125
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:26,320
Oh, my God.

126
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,580
- How did he find out?
- Danielle told him.

127
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,930
- What? Why?
- I don't know.

128
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:35,060
I think it was some idiotic
attempt to bond with him.

129
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,700
Wait a minute.

130
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,330
You never told Carlos and Gaby?

131
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,590
Of course not. That would
have destroyed the friendship,

132
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:45,000
not to mention Carlos would
have sent Andrew to jail.

133
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,150
So what does Sam want?

134
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:50,690
My company, and I'm
going to give it to him.

135
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:53,440
- Are you crazy?
- If I don't, he'll go to the police.

136
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,820
- Let him.
- Andrew!

137
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,960
Mom, I'm not letting you give
up everything you've worked for

138
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:59,120
just 'cause that psycho thinks
he has something over on us.

139
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,160
They will send you to prison.

140
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,980
- Well, maybe it's time I paid for what I've done.
- Absolutely not.

141
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:06,720
Bree, you can't give in to
blackmail. It's not right.

142
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,240
And if Andrew wants to
take responsibility...

143
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,850
Orson, this is really
just between me and my son.

144
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:16,430
Would you mind?

145
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,360
Of course not.

146
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:33,920
What's going on?

147
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:36,800
Why am I wet?

148
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,520
Beats me. I'm not a doctor.

149
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,240
Gaby, what are you doing here?

150
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:45,600
Angie's in trouble. Look,
she wrote me this note.

151
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,280
"Danny and I held hostage. No cops. Get Nick."

152
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,510
I don't understand.

153
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,810
There was a guy with her.
He said he was her brother.

154
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,020
She doesn't have a brother.

155
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:57,920
Is it Patrick Logan?

156
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,830
You know about Patrick?

157
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:02,860
She told me everything.

158
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,330
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?

159
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,560
I gotta get him outta there.

160
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,010
Wait. Are you crazy? In your condition?

161
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,740
Why can't we just call the cops?

162
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:14,000
Because the second Patrick feels cornered,

163
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,090
Angie and Danny are dead.

164
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,390
Oh, my God.

165
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,770
Are you gonna be all right?

166
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,680
No. You're gonna have to drive me

167
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:26,140
- to help me get him outta there.
- Okay.

168
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,640
I know. I'm sorry. I'm putting
you in a dangerous position.

169
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:31,570
Forget about it.

170
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:37,990
So you're done?

171
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,140
Yes.

172
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,320
When you push the detonator,

173
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,880
you got 30 seconds till it blows.

174
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,660
You got what you wanted.
You gonna let us go now?

175
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:57,050
Not yet. You're coming with me to Oregon.

176
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:00,730
You didn't say anything about that.

177
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,520
Ange...

178
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:03,700
What if the bomb's a dud?

179
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,020
I mean, you did run off with
another man and take my son.

180
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,210
I've got some trust issues.

181
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,130
Will you at least let Danny go?

182
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:17,670
No. See, if the bomb doesn't go off,

183
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,150
I'll put a bullet in your head

184
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,550
and then come back and kill him.

185
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:28,830
So...

186
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,730
You sure you're done?

187
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,820
I guess I could take another look.

188
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,260
My grandson's visiting. He'll love this.

189
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,640
How about we give you 100 bucks?

190
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,490
Look at the price tag. 50 cents.

191
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,330
Please, Susan. Let us help you.

192
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,230
I don't need my arthritis
medication this month.

193
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,370
Look, I can almost make a fist.

194
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:03,180
Thank you, but we're not looking
for a handout. Just a hand.

195
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,840
Hey, I just got off the phone with Lee.

196
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,290
- He thinks he might have found a renter.
- Already?

197
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:09,670
Well, that's a good thing, isn't it?

198
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:11,900
Yeah, yeah. It's great.

199
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,820
Stranger living in my house... yippee!

200
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:18,310
Hey, Susan, how much
for this dining room set?

201
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:22,030
I paid $1,200 a year ago.
You can have it for $300.

202
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:23,830
I'll give you 50 bucks.

203
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,150
I thought you weren't looking
for a handout, just a hand.

204
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,920
That's not a hand. That's a finger.

205
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:35,000
Susan, I'm not neighbor Kinsky
right now. I'm business Kinsky.

206
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,210
So I'm gonna be Frank.

207
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,760
You don't have a pot
to pee-pee in right now,

208
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:41,120
and our neighborhood knows
it. What's it gonna be?

209
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,260
Jeez, Kinsky. Have a heart.
The woman needs the money.

210
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,540
Oh, keep out of it, McCluskey.
You know the yard sale game.

211
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,590
If you lost the stomach for it, walk away.

212
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,170
No, Mitzi. You walk away.

213
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,360
Excuse me?

214
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,200
You're nothing but a vulture.

215
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,420
I want you off my property.

216
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,080
Hey, lookie here.

217
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,680
I'm on a public sidewalk.
Now what you gonna do?

218
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:12,500
Mitzi, I am not "neighbor" Delfino.

219
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,840
I am "woman who's about
to move into an apartment

220
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,420
behind a gas station" Delfino,

221
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,810
and if you don't get out of my face,

222
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,490
I am gonna ram this thigh
master down your throat.

223
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,860
Fine. $300.

224
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,020
Sold.

225
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,880
I found some aspirin. Will that help?

226
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,120
This isn't a headache.
These are contractions.

227
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:45,430
I need you to take me to a hospital.

228
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,250
No, I can't, you'll tell someone about me.

229
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,910
Eddie, I swear to God. I
don't care about you right now.

230
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:55,640
All I care about is this baby. Please.

231
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:01,370
Porter, I found her. She's at Eddie's.

232
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,710
If I'm not back in 15 minutes,

233
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,490
it means she did not accept my apology,

234
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,450
and it was fun being your dad.

235
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:12,250
Okay. I'm trusting you here.

236
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:15,130
Thank you. You have my word.

237
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,710
Eddie! It's Tom!

238
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,970
I need to talk to her again.

239
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,090
Quiet.

240
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,200
Honey! I can see your car.
I know you're in there.

241
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,090
Lynette!

242
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,680
Okay, I get it.

243
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,630
You're giving me the silent treatment.

244
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:42,090
Well, when you cool off,

245
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,440
I will be home

246
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:47,470
with a gigantic bouquet
of your favorite flowers.

247
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,560
I'm sorry.

248
00:13:58,850 --> 00:13:59,920
I had to do that.

249
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,200
I'll take you to the hospital now.

250
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:08,480
It's too late. It's too
late. This baby is coming now.

251
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:15,580
And you have to help me deliver it.

252
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,340
Mr. Chase, you got a minute?

253
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,210
Oh, sure, father. Come on in.

254
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,530
I just came from Teresa Pruitt's bedside.

255
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,160
She passed.

256
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:32,340
I'm sorry to hear that. I,
uh, I remember her fondly.

257
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,290
She was one of my best nurses.

258
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,510
Before she died, she told me something...

259
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,660
An awful secret that she'd
been living with for years.

260
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:44,310
Uh, father, I'm, uh, I'm
not trying to tell you

261
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:44,990
how to do your business,

262
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,790
but aren't those things
supposed to be confidential?

263
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,580
She wanted you to hear this,

264
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,610
but I think you should sit down first.

265
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:01,090
Hey, lady, unless you want
to be carried into the truck,

266
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,390
you need to get off that chair.

267
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:05,290
I see. Like you're the mover. Funny.

268
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,350
Have you seen T-Rex?

269
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,850
The dinosaur? Well, check in the boxes.

270
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,900
No, honey. We sold it to Roy.

271
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:14,990
No!

272
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,930
Yeah. You put it in the "sell" pile.

273
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,580
What's a "sell" pile?

274
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,720
Uh-oh.

275
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,970
I want my t-Rex.

276
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,010
Well, buddy, I'm sorry. We sold it,

277
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,370
- so there's no way we can...
- We're getting it back.

278
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,590
- What are you doing?
- Loving my child.

279
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,200
Thank you, mommy.

280
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,790
Susan, I don't think you
should have promised him that.

281
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,290
Roy bought it for his grandson.

282
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,030
It's bad enough that we are dragging him

283
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,020
from the only home he has ever lived in,

284
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:46,650
moving across town where he
doesn't know a single soul.

285
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,410
If that silly dinosaur
brings him a moment's comfort,

286
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:53,080
then we need to March over
there and take it back.

287
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,820
What the hell? We're moving.

288
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,320
Let's go piss off some neighbors.

289
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,560
And somehow the dinosaur
got into the pile,

290
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,060
and now M.J. is begging us to get it back.

291
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,600
Sorry for the confusion, Roy.

292
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:11,210
No, I get it. It's just...

293
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:13,430
I already gave it to my grandson.

294
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:16,220
Aw, I remember when we gave it to M.J...

295
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,670
Right after his puppy died.

296
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,370
Okay, okay.

297
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,910
Let's go get it before
you take out your violin.

298
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,760
I guess the excitement
of getting a new friend

299
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,080
wore him out.

300
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,820
- I'll wake him up.
- Oh, you don't have to do that.

301
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,710
Why don't you just
slip it out of his arms?

302
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:39,750
- And we'll leave a note.
- A note?

303
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,860
And cash. Mike, give the man some cash.

304
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:44,790
No, we're not taking money.
He's got tons of other toys.

305
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,320
He'll be fine.

306
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:54,930
Oh, God, he's deaf.

307
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,360
Shouldn't we stop this?

308
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,550
Just let it play out.

309
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:11,850
There you go.

310
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,230
You are now the sole owner

311
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,660
of Mrs. Van De Kamp's old fashioned foods.

312
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,820
Of course, my lawyers
will have to approve this.

313
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,440
Of course, and you'll
see there's a codicil.

314
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,870
If you breathe one word

315
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:25,190
of Andrew's involvement in that incident,

316
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,710
you'll be forced to pay
me all sorts of money.

317
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,070
Don't worry. I'm much
better at keeping secrets

318
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,550
than your daughter.

319
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:32,980
One can only hope.

320
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,350
I didn't want it to be this way.

321
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,440
And I understand if you need to hate me.

322
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,960
I don't hate you, Sam.
I feel sorry for you.

323
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,640
You came into my life

324
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,350
hoping to be a part of my family,
and all you're leaving with

325
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:59,370
is a client list, some
mixing bowls and my name.

326
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,680
Well, you'll soon see that's not enough.

327
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,290
You'll always have a hole in your heart

328
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,660
because you don't really
care about anybody,

329
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,640
and I have a horrible feeling

330
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,010
that no one will ever
really care about you.

331
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:19,000
Now would you please be a dear

332
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,730
and close the door on
your way out of my life?

333
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,660
So I'm gonna put the bomb in the trunk,

334
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:34,600
and that's how long you have
to say good-bye to our son.

335
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:50,600
♪♪♪

336
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,710
you can't go with him. He's
never gonna let you come back.

337
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:01,160
I don't know how this is gonna play out,

338
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,630
but whatever happens, you gotta know,

339
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,990
that I was out of choices.

340
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,020
Okay, Angie. Car's loaded.

341
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:11,990
Come on.

342
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,520
We got a bomb to explode.

343
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,080
Okay, okay. I gotta push again.

344
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,540
No, you have to look.

345
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:25,930
- But it's so gross!
- I don't care. You're going to to have to catch her. Go.

346
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:35,530
I see something! I think it's the head!

347
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,520
Aah!

348
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,880
Wait. There's something around her neck!

349
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,450
What?

350
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,880
I think it's the umbilical cord.

351
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,770
No! No!

352
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,550
She's turning blue.

353
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,340
Okay. Okay. Um...

354
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:54,630
Listen to me.

355
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,730
You have to... Hook the umbilical cord

356
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:59,980
with your finger and
pull it over her head.

357
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:01,850
- No, I can't.
- You have to!

358
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,410
No, Mrs. Scavo, I'm serious!

359
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,740
Listen to me.

360
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:09,870
You have the chance to save... a life.

361
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:13,170
Please!

362
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:17,880
Okay.

363
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,960
Oh, oh, is it done?

364
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,230
Yeah. I got her.

365
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,190
Yes! Yes! Yes.

366
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,460
She's okay?

367
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:40,840
Oh!

368
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:42,890
Ahh!

369
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,200
Thank you.

370
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,860
I know.

371
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,370
Where is he?

372
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:03,830
I'm sorry, sweetie. T-Rex is extinct.

373
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:06,590
Yeah, buddy. I'm sorry we
couldn't get him back for ya.

374
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:10,990
But he's mine. That's not fair.

375
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,760
M.J...

376
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,850
That's life. Life isn't always fair.

377
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:19,210
Sometimes you can be a good person

378
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,280
and you can do the right thing,

379
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:23,260
and life still won't give
you your dinosaur back.

380
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:27,510
In other words,

381
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:29,970
we're gonna take you to pizza world,

382
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:32,400
and you can play all
the video games you want.

383
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,570
Okay.

384
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:44,920
Susan, life didn't take your dinosaur.

385
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,030
I did.

386
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,600
So please, just let me have it.

387
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,700
Okay. Yeah.

388
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:54,620
I resent you.

389
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:58,030
I love you, I respect
you, but you know what?

390
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,150
I mean, you blew it! And thanks to you,

391
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:03,270
I have to leave the home where
I raised my children. Look.

392
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:07,180
Look, this... this is how tall Julie was

393
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,420
when she started kindergarten.

394
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,430
And... and this is her in junior high.

395
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,440
And this is M.J.

396
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:15,180
The day we brought him home from
the hospital and stood him up.

397
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:19,070
And this... this is where
I thought he'd get to.

398
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:20,680
Here.

399
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,350
In this house...

400
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:28,310
And now I'm never gonna
know, and it's all your fault.

401
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,280
There it is.

402
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,140
Hey.

403
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:42,890
We're gonna get it back.

404
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,400
I promise.

405
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,840
And in the meantime...

406
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,820
Well... that's done.

407
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,840
It's Sam's company now.

408
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:17,080
So you did it.

409
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:21,080
You actually gave up a business
you spent eight years building.

410
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,250
What other choice did I have?

411
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,820
I can always start a new company.

412
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:27,890
What I cannot do is send my son to jail.

413
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,660
You sent me to jail.

414
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,420
You insisted I turn myself in.

415
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:36,650
You said it was the only
way you'd take me back.

416
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:40,470
That was a completely different situation.

417
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,630
Really?

418
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,110
I ran over Mike and told no one.

419
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,260
Andrew ran over Carlos'
mother and told no one.

420
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,630
How is that different?

421
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,080
Andrew was a child at the time.

422
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,810
He's not anymore.

423
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,020
Orson, please.

424
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,550
I don't mean to upset you.

425
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:00,340
I'm just curious why

426
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:03,190
you're not demanding Andrew
do the same thing as well.

427
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:05,400
Fine. I was wrong.

428
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,750
I never should have asked
you to make that sacrifice.

429
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,680
I don't want an apology.

430
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:14,860
I respected you for
demanding better of me.

431
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,690
You showed me you had
principles and ideals.

432
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:19,840
You insisted I live up to your standards,

433
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,790
and I loved you for it.

434
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:24,000
What are you saying?

435
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:26,510
From the moment you told
me what Andrew had done

436
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:30,140
and what Sam was threatening
to do, I saw this as a test,

437
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:32,860
and I hoped worth all my
heart that you would pass it,

438
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:35,110
but you have failed miserably.

439
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:37,580
Where are you going?

440
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:39,420
Pack my suitcase. I'm leaving.

441
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:40,840
What?

442
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:42,920
You are not the woman I thought you were.

443
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,660
For God sakes, Orson.

444
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:52,220
He's my son. I have no choice.

445
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:54,370
We always have a choice,

446
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:57,600
and I no longer choose to be your husband.

447
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:09,520
All right, I'm gonna go around back,

448
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,240
see if I can climb in a window.

449
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:13,870
You think you can keep Patrick
occupied for ten minutes?

450
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:14,540
Honey, you're talking to a woman

451
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,900
who never paid for a
drink in her life. Please.

452
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,560
Oh, man.

453
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:21,510
You okay?

454
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:24,750
Yeah. Just a little light-headed.

455
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,890
Just give me a second.

456
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:30,140
By the way, thank you.

457
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,400
I can't believe you're
helping us out like this.

458
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:34,910
I don't know. I guess it's...

459
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,250
I guess it's because I know what it's like

460
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,650
to have secrets, too.

461
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:40,840
It's a lonely feeling.

462
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:45,180
And that night on the plane
when Angie told me hers,

463
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,560
I promised I would help her...

464
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,260
Whatever it takes.

465
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,010
Nick? Nick.

466
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:58,730
Oh, my God. Don't pass out.

467
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,740
Nick!

468
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:02,400
Come on! I can't do this alone.

469
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,090
She's so small.

470
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:14,790
Not for long. They grow up so quickly.

471
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,500
I wish I could see her grow up.

472
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,060
So... I'm gonna go now.

473
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,270
If you could just...

474
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,480
Wait a while before you call the police.

475
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,020
Wait.

476
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,580
That day you left my house,

477
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,540
you told me your life would
have turned out different

478
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,090
if I had been your mom.

479
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:51,260
So I'm gonna be your mom... now.

480
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,200
Will you listen to me?

481
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,540
I don't think you should leave.

482
00:26:57,610 --> 00:27:01,970
I think you should stay
here and call the police.

483
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:03,760
I can't.

484
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,030
Yes, you can.

485
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:08,900
I don't want to spend the
rest of my life in jail.

486
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:13,870
Honey... don't you see
you're already there?

487
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,980
No matter where you run to, in your head,

488
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:19,440
you will still be angry.

489
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:21,800
You'll still be in pain.

490
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:25,540
And as long as you want
to keep hurting people,

491
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,450
you will never be free.

492
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,360
I'll be good. I swear.

493
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,370
But people will never see that you're good

494
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:36,120
unless you show them.

495
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:40,280
Please, if you pick up
the phone, they will know.

496
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:43,340
And I will be so proud of you.

497
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,880
Will you call them for me?

498
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,090
Of course.

499
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:23,960
Why don't you hold the baby?

500
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,020
Hello. Fairview hospital?

501
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:50,460
I need to know how to
bring someone out of a coma.

502
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,330
I'm not sure if it's a coma.

503
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,420
Somewhere between a coma and a nap.

504
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:57,440
How should I know if he's clammy?

505
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,720
I left him in the car.

506
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:01,020
Gaby?

507
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:03,560
Hey, Susan, what's up?

508
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,000
- Just came to say good-bye.
- Okay. All right. See ya.

509
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:08,060
Oh, no. I mean, this is it.

510
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,120
Tomorrow's moving day,
and it's gonna be crazy,

511
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,730
so I didn't want to rush
through our good-byes.

512
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:14,480
Oh, good for you. I'll
catch ya when I catch ya.

513
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:20,750
Hello? Hello? Damn it!

514
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:26,830
Oh! Susan! Uh...

515
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:30,130
I'm sorry. I'm just so
choked up about you leaving.

516
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,430
- I just couldn't deal with it.
- Oh!

517
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,410
Really?

518
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,910
You know who else is
gonna be devastated? Angie.

519
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:39,840
Angie Bolen?

520
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:42,230
Yes. She's totally broken up about this.

521
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,500
You've gotta say good-bye.

522
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:47,370
Seriously? I...I mean,
I like her and everything.

523
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,270
I just... we've had our problems.

524
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,860
Oh, just neighbor stuff.

525
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:53,270
Well, I tried to crush
her son with his car.

526
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:54,610
One of her favorite stories.

527
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,750
And then she attacked me with a bat.

528
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,150
She's Italian. That's love. Now come on.

529
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:02,150
You know, Angie once told me

530
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,680
that a good-bye doesn't mean anything

531
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,470
if it doesn't last ten minutes.

532
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,720
Really? I don't think
Angie and I have ever had

533
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:09,650
a conversation that lasted more than...

534
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:12,890
Gaby?

535
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,390
Okay. Uh...

536
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,500
It's getting late. Let's go.

537
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,930
Yeah, these aren't
gonna draw any attention.

538
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:30,000
Not as much as a bullet in
the head if you try to run.

539
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,650
It's my neighbor, Susan.

540
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,720
Someone really needs to thin this herd.

541
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:46,070
Get rid of her.

542
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:49,810
Susan. What's going on?

543
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:51,950
Uh... tomorrow's moving day.

544
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,810
I just came to say good-bye.

545
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:58,000
Okay... bye.

546
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,810
Don't you want my new address?

547
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,900
Relax, Ange. This will be
over before you know it.

548
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,770
It's okay, Danny.

549
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:14,980
I'm gonna get you out of here.

550
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,610
Oh!

551
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,510
Why are we stopping?

552
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:39,080
What's the range on this
thing? About 200 yards?

553
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:41,170
Yeah. Why?

554
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,190
Patrick, what are you doing?

555
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:58,170
When I woke up that morning 20 years ago,

556
00:31:58,950 --> 00:31:59,930
and you were gone,

557
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:02,660
I was devastated.

558
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,960
I tried to forgive you, but I couldn't.

559
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:08,940
After all, you didn't just betray me.

560
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,880
You betrayed everything we believed in.

561
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:15,740
So I decided one day

562
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,470
I would find you...

563
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,140
And I would punish you.

564
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:23,610
And today is that day, my love.

565
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,060
Where's the bomb?

566
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:33,020
There's 30 seconds from the
time I push this detonator

567
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:35,040
till the explosion...
That's what you said, right?

568
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:38,270
- Tell me where the bomb is now!
- It's in your house.

569
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:40,430
And if you want to save our son,

570
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,080
I suggest you get moving.

571
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,710
- Come on. Hurry. I gotta help my mom.
- I'm trying!

572
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,000
Okay.

573
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,160
It's in the detonator.

574
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:13,880
You bitch.

575
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:20,430
Mom?

576
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:43,930
Oh, Gaby. We can't take
this. This is too much.

577
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:45,410
I insist.

578
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:48,380
Although I am gonna need $10 for parking.

579
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:54,520
So... this is good-bye.

580
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:56,540
Forever, right?

581
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,310
I mean, that's how this works?

582
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,580
Yeah.

583
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,040
You know what's funny?

584
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:06,130
Nick had to drag me here
kicking and screaming.

585
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,850
He told me it would be
a good place to blend in

586
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,730
because people wave at you

587
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,380
from behind their little picket fences,

588
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,190
but they would never get
involved. They don't care.

589
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,340
Well, thank God you proved him wrong.

590
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:27,070
Take care.

591
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:40,090
So we better hurry. Bus
is leaving in five minutes.

592
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:43,850
Yeah. We should give him his ticket.

593
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,870
This is a ticket to New York.

594
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,410
I thought the plan was to go to Atlanta.

595
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,520
That's our plan.

596
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,350
- No way.
- Listen to me.

597
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,000
I want to be with you guys.

598
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:02,900
And we wanna be with you,

599
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:05,080
but we have to stop being selfish.

600
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:09,080
She's right. It's time
we let you live your life.

601
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:11,490
You're gonna have so much fun in New York.

602
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:14,390
You get to be with Ana.
You can see grandma.

603
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,200
And you can finally stop running.

604
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:20,630
But I'll still get to see you
guys every once in a while.

605
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,210
Right? I mean, Patrick's dead.

606
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:26,180
The FBI is still looking for us.

607
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,600
I don't think I can do
this. I'm not ready for...

608
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,640
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

609
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:36,190
You are gonna be fine, okay?

610
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:38,050
Because you...

611
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,180
You have turned into one hell of a man.

612
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:42,340
Yeah.

613
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:46,500
If I am...

614
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:50,640
it's 'cause you were my father.

615
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:32,850
Mom?

616
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,140
Why is all of Orson's stuff gone?

617
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:43,820
He left me.

618
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:47,510
What? Why?

619
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:49,930
He feels I'm a hypocrite.

620
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,630
That's ridiculous.

621
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,380
No. He's right. I am.

622
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,240
Is there anything I can do?

623
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:01,150
There is.

624
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:06,110
You can give me your
permission to do something

625
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:09,150
I should have done a long time ago.

626
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:16,060
This is bad.

627
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,580
What if we don't say anything?

628
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:21,140
The nurse is dead. Nobody else knows.

629
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,640
The priest knows.

630
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:24,580
I don't suppose we could buy him off.

631
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,740
Just a suggestion.

632
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:30,830
If this leads to a
lawsuit, we have no defense.

633
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,500
This could ruin the hospital.

634
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,270
Jack, what's wrong?

635
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,490
I know one of these families.

636
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:41,160
They live two blocks
from me on Wisteria Lane.

637
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,560
Then maybe you're the
best person to tell them.

638
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:46,150
And how do I do that?

639
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:50,620
How do you tell parents the
child they've been raising...

640
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:54,540
The child they love...
isn't really theirs?

641
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:06,100
- Hey there. What's going on?
- Susan trying to sneak off without saying good-bye.

642
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:08,100
The more I thought about it,

643
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,820
the more I realized it's not a big deal.

644
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,460
I'm just moving across town.

645
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,510
I'm gonna see you all Friday for poker.

646
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:15,150
You better, 'cause if we don't
hear from you once a week,

647
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:19,820
- we will hunt you down and bring
you back. You know that, right?
- I do.

648
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:21,910
So who's renting your house?

649
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:24,000
Lee found a guy.

650
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:27,460
It's just not gonna seem right,
someone else in your house.

651
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:30,370
Yeah. Well, whoever the guy is,

652
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,290
he is very lucky, 'cause
he's about to get himself

653
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:35,260
three of the most wonderful neighbors

654
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,070
a person could ask for.

655
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,397
You know, sometimes when
you see people every day,

656
00:38:42,398 --> 00:38:44,990
you forget to tell them
how much they mean to you

657
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:46,640
so for the record...

658
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:50,240
I think the three of
you are such good people.

659
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:54,360
And you've made me a better person,

660
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:55,940
and I thank you for that.

661
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:02,340
Hey, Susan, I hate to interrupt,
but we really gotta get going.

662
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,550
I should go check on Tom and the baby.

663
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,810
- I'm sure one or both will need to be fed.
- Go, go.

664
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,740
- I'll call you all in the morning.
- Okay.

665
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:14,030
Honey, what's wrong?

666
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,990
What Susan said...

667
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,820
It's not true. I'm not a good person.

668
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,430
Oh, that's silly. Of course you are.

669
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:27,070
No, I'm not. There's
something I need to tell you

670
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:29,860
I should have told you
years ago but I didn't.

671
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:32,940
You sound so serious. What is it?

672
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:36,630
It's the kind of thing that
could end our friendship.

673
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:40,620
Can we go talk?

674
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:54,680
Well... you ready?

675
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,050
Yeah.

676
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:01,580
Drive away slow, okay?

677
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,950
As they pulled away,

678
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:16,050
Susan looked out on the
street she loved so much...

679
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:21,230
A street where parents
could raise their children...

680
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:26,600
Where retirees could
enjoy their golden years...

681
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:29,370
Where good friends

682
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,390
could share horrible secrets...

683
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:37,090
Yes, Susan looked on this street

684
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,720
and vowed she would be back...

685
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:43,600
But as she did so,

686
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:46,980
she didn't notice the
car that passed her...

687
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:52,220
A car carrying Wisteria Lane's...

688
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,080
Newest resident.

689
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:00,400
So I have some paperwork
for you to sign over here,

690
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,080
and once we get this done,
I can give you the keys.

691
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,570
And I just know you're
really gonna like it here.

692
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:10,560
People are friendly, relatively quiet.

693
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:13,950
It's just... it's just
a lovely neighborhood.

694
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:16,790
Oh, I know the neighborhood very well.

695
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,250
The truth is, I used to live here.

696
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:24,130
Oh, well, then I guess everyone
will be surprised to see you again.

697
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:27,630
They absolutely will.
