1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,367
Previously on...

2
00:00:09,639 --> 00:00:11,310
A marriage was on the mend.

3
00:00:11,356 --> 00:00:14,842
I would like to recapture
what we once had.

4
00:00:15,424 --> 00:00:16,324
Gaby and carlos

5
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:19,104
Discovered a secret.
you are gettin' sloppy!

6
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:21,564
And if people start
pokin' around, we're done.

7
00:00:21,849 --> 00:00:24,328
And susan made a request.

8
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:25,477
You're asking if i'm okay with

9
00:00:25,515 --> 00:00:27,428
letting a stripp

10
00:00:34,652 --> 00:00:36,140
The first thing you need to know

11
00:00:36,185 --> 00:00:38,288
About robin gallagher

12
00:00:38,732 --> 00:00:41,700
Was that everyone
liked to look at her.

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,748
They would stare at her legs...

14
00:00:46,766 --> 00:00:48,421
And her breasts...

15
00:00:50,122 --> 00:00:51,673
And her hair.

16
00:00:53,054 --> 00:00:54,661
And once they were done,

17
00:00:54,725 --> 00:00:57,178
People would begin to ask...

18
00:00:57,248 --> 00:00:59,870
Who is this?
this is my friend robin.

19
00:00:59,924 --> 00:01:01,883
Hello there.
mike had to work today,

20
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,063
So i thought i'd bring her
as my plus one. hello there.

21
00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:06,243
You already said that.

22
00:01:06,281 --> 00:01:08,511
I wanted her to know i meant it.

23
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,347
It's really good to have you
back on the lane, katherine.

24
00:01:11,394 --> 00:01:13,256
It's great to be back.
i didn't know

25
00:01:13,302 --> 00:01:16,509
What to expect at first.
i have wondered how everyone

26
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,393
Would feel about me,
if they were really ready

27
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,693
To welcome me back.
i guess there's always

28
00:01:21,739 --> 00:01:25,154
That fear that people
are going to reject you.

29
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:29,017
Do i smell appetizers? i know i do.

30
00:01:36,172 --> 00:01:38,227
Hello, susan!

31
00:01:38,513 --> 00:01:39,952
Who's your new friend?

32
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:43,804
Robin, this is carlos,
tom, roy and orson.

33
00:01:43,858 --> 00:01:47,312
Hope you got all that,
'cause there's gonna be a quiz later.

34
00:01:48,013 --> 00:01:49,093
Oh, god.

35
00:01:49,139 --> 00:01:52,857
So, robin, welcome
to my humble abode.

36
00:01:52,903 --> 00:01:54,125
Thank you.

37
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,842
It's so suburban.

38
00:01:55,888 --> 00:01:58,814
I've never been in a place where
the ceilings were so tall.

39
00:01:58,884 --> 00:02:02,144
Fascinating. just fascinating.

40
00:02:02,885 --> 00:02:04,085
You live in the city?

41
00:02:04,155 --> 00:02:07,945
I did, but i'll be living
with susan for a while.

42
00:02:08,031 --> 00:02:10,006
I just moved in today.

43
00:02:12,059 --> 00:02:13,738
Susan, let's get you a drink.

44
00:02:13,792 --> 00:02:15,742
Oh, no, that's okay.
i'll wait till--oh!

45
00:02:17,692 --> 00:02:19,338
So...

46
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:22,414
So how did you meet susan?

47
00:02:22,462 --> 00:02:24,643
So... you want to tell
us about your new friend

48
00:02:24,706 --> 00:02:26,943
Or, uh, should i say "roommate"?

49
00:02:26,991 --> 00:02:29,924
She was down on her luck and
she needed a place to stay.

50
00:02:29,971 --> 00:02:31,376
Plus, i feel responsible,

51
00:02:31,431 --> 00:02:33,444
Because i told her to give up her

52
00:02:33,482 --> 00:02:36,800
job. what was wro a stripper?

53
00:02:36,831 --> 00:02:39,253
Well... we probably don't need
to let the guys in on this,

54
00:02:39,315 --> 00:02:42,602
But... robin was-- that's wild!

55
00:02:42,664 --> 00:02:45,454
So you used to be a stripper?

56
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,369
Yes...

57
00:02:50,406 --> 00:02:54,621
Everyone liked to look
at robin gallagher...

58
00:02:56,394 --> 00:03:01,409
But not everyone
liked what they saw.

59
00:03:11,933 --> 00:03:13,485
Later,

60
00:03:13,546 --> 00:03:16,561
While the men of wisteria
lane were trying the shrimp,

61
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:21,310
Their wives were trying
to control themselves.

62
00:03:22,152 --> 00:03:23,618
You moved a stripper
into the neighborhood?

63
00:03:23,664 --> 00:03:25,102
What were you thinking?
you guys aren't

64
00:03:25,179 --> 00:03:26,482
even taking the
timethere pooling togeth

65
00:03:26,536 --> 00:03:29,381
Our husbands are in
there pooling together

66
00:03:29,384 --> 00:03:31,132
Their dollar bills.
what more do we need to

67
00:03:31,193 --> 00:03:32,886
know? i just met rob
she's a stripper?

68
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:35,627
Did she mention that
she's a stripper?

69
00:03:35,706 --> 00:03:37,599
Did she have to?

70
00:03:37,654 --> 00:03:40,492
Look, i am just trying to
help her get back on her feet.

71
00:03:40,562 --> 00:03:41,824
I bet that'd be a nice change for

72
00:03:42,317 --> 00:03:44,388
her. she is livi

73
00:03:44,434 --> 00:03:46,048
If anybody should be worried,
it'd be me,

74
00:03:46,086 --> 00:03:48,477
And i am not threatened
by her at all.

75
00:03:48,524 --> 00:03:49,578
Really?

76
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,084
Yes. she's a nice girl.

77
00:03:51,122 --> 00:03:53,321
Yeah, nice, blonde, and you can

78
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,709
bounce a quarte

79
00:03:54,764 --> 00:03:57,050
I'm telling you, she's trouble.
here's a good thing--

80
00:03:57,096 --> 00:03:59,942
She can't bring any more crazy
to this street than i did.

81
00:04:00,021 --> 00:04:01,684
Let's give her a chance. i agree.

82
00:04:01,745 --> 00:04:04,990
Robin's probably had a
tough life, and she needs

83
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,290
our help. well,
i'm allassionate about it...

84
00:04:06,361 --> 00:04:08,223
But i have teenage boys at home.

85
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,811
The last thing i need
next door is a stripper.

86
00:04:17,112 --> 00:04:19,952
Hey, mrs. scavo. we're
picking up parker for school.

87
00:04:23,164 --> 00:04:25,413
Please come in.
i'll get him for you.

88
00:04:28,858 --> 00:04:31,529
So you ever gonna get back
to folding the laundry?

89
00:04:31,559 --> 00:04:32,934
Well, i thought i'd treat myself

90
00:04:32,995 --> 00:04:35,098
And wash the breakfast
dishes first.

91
00:04:35,152 --> 00:04:39,367
Well, you started this.
don't you think you should finish?

92
00:04:40,326 --> 00:04:44,610
Well, since you're so
passionate about it...

93
00:04:45,605 --> 00:04:47,820
Knock yourself out.

94
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:53,965
Okay, you just went

95
00:04:54,018 --> 00:04:57,457
From jerk to adorable real quick.

96
00:04:57,514 --> 00:04:59,126
Happy anniversary.

97
00:04:59,171 --> 00:05:01,049
Oh! mm. mm.

98
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:04,907
It's the ring!

99
00:05:04,961 --> 00:05:07,406
Oh, you went back to
that antique shop.

100
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,684
Yep. Oh, thank you! mwah. mm.

101
00:05:11,741 --> 00:05:13,290
Wait till you see your present.

102
00:05:13,344 --> 00:05:15,878
You can unwrap it tonight
when the kids are asleep.

103
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,555
Or how about after
they leave for school?

104
00:05:19,592 --> 00:05:23,598
Okay. Hey, why are
they still up there

105
00:05:23,644 --> 00:05:25,803
And why can't i hear them?

106
00:05:36,095 --> 00:05:37,814
Hey, boys.

107
00:05:39,691 --> 00:05:41,738
What's going on?

108
00:05:42,505 --> 00:05:44,359
Uh, we're late for school.

109
00:05:58,939 --> 00:06:04,851
Oh! Oh, hey, lynette.

110
00:06:04,912 --> 00:06:06,535
Hi. the next time
you take a shower,

111
00:06:06,604 --> 00:06:08,378
Do you think you could
close your blinds?

112
00:06:08,432 --> 00:06:12,695
I have a 16-year-old son,
and he has friends.

113
00:06:13,621 --> 00:06:14,540
Oh, no.

114
00:06:14,609 --> 00:06:16,560
Oh, yes. you may have
retired from the strip club,

115
00:06:16,638 --> 00:06:19,221
But you're still doing
seven shows a week. i mean,

116
00:06:19,268 --> 00:06:23,090
at least they didn't hav Right?

117
00:06:23,137 --> 00:06:24,726
This is a nice community.

118
00:06:24,797 --> 00:06:26,755
You have a responsibility
to the neighbors,

119
00:06:26,825 --> 00:06:29,712
Especially the ones
with innocent children.

120
00:06:31,044 --> 00:06:34,116
Well, they're not all so innocent.

121
00:06:34,648 --> 00:06:36,575
Excuse me?

122
00:06:36,695 --> 00:06:38,876
Yesterday that son of yours

123
00:06:38,921 --> 00:06:41,681
Asked me if i would
have sex with him.

124
00:06:42,918 --> 00:06:44,581
Parker?

125
00:06:44,635 --> 00:06:46,361
My parker?

126
00:06:46,431 --> 00:06:47,799
Red hair, skinny,

127
00:06:47,885 --> 00:06:51,059
Still-sleeps-in-a-bed-shaped-
like-a-racecar parker?

128
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:53,750
Of course i said no.

129
00:06:55,228 --> 00:06:58,225
Then he offered me cash.

130
00:07:04,287 --> 00:07:05,813
Come in.

131
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,595
Have a seat.

132
00:07:08,943 --> 00:07:10,135
What's up?

133
00:07:10,181 --> 00:07:11,827
Something wrong?

134
00:07:12,296 --> 00:07:13,839
We hoped it would be another year

135
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:16,307
Before we had the
parent-son conversation

136
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:20,056
Where we tell you not to offer
your neighbor money for sex.

137
00:07:20,121 --> 00:07:21,437
But...

138
00:07:21,498 --> 00:07:23,776
Oh, crap. she told?

139
00:07:23,831 --> 00:07:25,317
Yeah.

140
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,961
You might want to pick a more
discreet stripper next time.

141
00:07:28,015 --> 00:07:29,205
What were you thinking?

142
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,513
We raised you better than that.
didn't we? yeah, we did.

143
00:07:32,559 --> 00:07:35,766
We did. so... what do you
have to say for yourself?

144
00:07:39,485 --> 00:07:43,676
I just really, really, really...

145
00:07:43,721 --> 00:07:45,825
Needed to have sex.

146
00:07:47,198 --> 00:07:49,093
Three "reallys.
" well, in that case,

147
00:07:49,155 --> 00:07:52,503
Here's a $20.
go back and try again.

148
00:07:52,788 --> 00:07:55,859
You are a 16-year-old boy.

149
00:07:55,921 --> 00:07:59,143
We understand your hormones are
holding your brain hostage,

150
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,667
But why would you think you
would need to pay for sex?

151
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:02,719
Because i'm the only
one of my friends

152
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,628
Who hasn't lost his virginity. oh.

153
00:08:05,809 --> 00:08:08,276
first of all, we've

154
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:09,540
And trust me, "pimples," "braces"

155
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:12,300
And "beam me up,
scotty" are not gettin' any.

156
00:08:12,339 --> 00:08:14,072
Girls don't look at me that way.

157
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:16,053
It's never gonna happen.

158
00:08:24,716 --> 00:08:26,370
Knock it off!

159
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:29,431
You are a great kid!

160
00:08:29,469 --> 00:08:31,676
You don't need to pay for it.

161
00:08:31,753 --> 00:08:33,759
In a few years,

162
00:08:33,861 --> 00:08:35,468
When you're emotionally ready,

163
00:08:35,537 --> 00:08:37,063
You'll meet the right girl,

164
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,572
And you will have tons of sex.

165
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:41,856
After you're married.

166
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:44,445
Okay, dad.

167
00:08:44,475 --> 00:08:45,976
Sorry.

168
00:08:54,019 --> 00:08:56,893
Nice job. Thank you.

169
00:08:56,962 --> 00:08:59,128
You think he bought it?

170
00:08:59,182 --> 00:09:00,796
Bought what?

171
00:09:00,867 --> 00:09:02,513
You know.

172
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,317
Guys always pay for
sex in some way--

173
00:09:07,403 --> 00:09:09,161
I mean, dinner, flowers...

174
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,350
Antique rings.

175
00:09:14,979 --> 00:09:16,426
Whoa. whoa.

176
00:09:16,497 --> 00:09:19,064
You think that's the only
reason we're having sex tonight?

177
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:21,451
Of course not.
it's our anniversary.

178
00:09:21,521 --> 00:09:23,711
It's a given,
like turkey on thanksgiving.

179
00:09:23,765 --> 00:09:24,843
Although i am hoping

180
00:09:24,904 --> 00:09:28,088
That the ring gets me an
upgrade from missionary.

181
00:09:28,142 --> 00:09:31,388
Forget about upgrades.
you just got bumped off the flight.

182
00:09:31,474 --> 00:09:33,848
Honey, wh-- why are
you getting so upset?

183
00:09:33,902 --> 00:09:35,678
Because i didn't know i was married

184
00:09:35,731 --> 00:09:38,328
To such a cynical lug nut.

185
00:09:38,383 --> 00:09:41,316
Wait. are we really not
gonna have sex tonight?

186
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,913
Don't worry, tom.

187
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:45,110
In a few years,
when you're emotionally ready,

188
00:09:45,171 --> 00:09:47,386
You're gonna have tons of sex.

189
00:09:50,863 --> 00:09:52,551
Come on!

190
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,699
So you really like that ring?

191
00:09:59,738 --> 00:10:01,047
Yep.

192
00:10:03,605 --> 00:10:05,892
Did you read the inscription?

193
00:10:06,145 --> 00:10:07,520
"to my darling--"

194
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:09,101
We're not having sex, tom.

195
00:10:09,155 --> 00:10:12,168
Oh, come on. why not?

196
00:10:12,247 --> 00:10:14,925
Because i am still
upset by what you said.

197
00:10:15,739 --> 00:10:17,721
Do you really think women
only sleep with men

198
00:10:17,792 --> 00:10:19,765
If they buy them things?

199
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:23,698
No. i think supermodels sleep
with 80-year-old millionaires

200
00:10:23,768 --> 00:10:25,366
Because they love to hear stories

201
00:10:25,437 --> 00:10:27,538
About when bread
was 5 cents a loaf.

202
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,551
Well, i'm not a model,
and you're no millionaire,

203
00:10:29,597 --> 00:10:32,076
So i'm thinking you
owe me an apology.

204
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:35,295
You and i went to marley's tavern

205
00:10:35,342 --> 00:10:36,524
On our first two dates,

206
00:10:36,586 --> 00:10:38,792
And i could barely get
past a good night kiss.

207
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:43,252
But third time out, i dropped
200 bucks at la rive gauche,

208
00:10:43,314 --> 00:10:45,681
And bam! you finally put out.

209
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:47,980
Finally made love.

210
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:50,576
Listen, you idiot!

211
00:10:54,077 --> 00:10:55,948
I did not "put out" because you

212
00:10:55,994 --> 00:10:58,623
bought me an exed about you.

213
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:01,484
I did it because you showed up
for the date with a lightbulb

214
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,095
To replace the one
that had burned out

215
00:11:03,134 --> 00:11:06,500
In the hallway to my
apartment. remember?

216
00:11:06,586 --> 00:11:09,320
Oh. you said i didn't live
in the best neighborhood.

217
00:11:09,398 --> 00:11:11,677
And i was worried about you.

218
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:16,585
Bingo. i was ready to do
you right then and there.

219
00:11:16,941 --> 00:11:18,462
Really?

220
00:11:18,572 --> 00:11:21,099
That's all it takes?

221
00:11:21,551 --> 00:11:23,374
Me showing you i care?

222
00:11:25,163 --> 00:11:27,143
'cause that's easy.

223
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:31,799
And now it's time for
your anniversary present.

224
00:11:38,485 --> 00:11:40,892
Hey, robin.

225
00:11:40,946 --> 00:11:42,184
Remember the other day

226
00:11:42,246 --> 00:11:44,252
When i told you this was
a nice neighborhood?

227
00:11:44,322 --> 00:11:45,328
I forgot to warn you--

228
00:11:45,394 --> 00:11:48,773
There's this one bitch
that lives right nearby,

229
00:11:49,171 --> 00:11:51,337
And that would be me.

230
00:11:51,686 --> 00:11:53,102
Look, i understand.

231
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,570
An ex-stripper moving next door
will freak some people out.

232
00:11:55,607 --> 00:11:58,934
No. seriously, i'm sorry.

233
00:11:59,939 --> 00:12:01,690
Apology accepted.

234
00:12:05,967 --> 00:12:07,807
Oh, and, uh, by the way...

235
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:09,724
Oh. yeah?

236
00:12:09,777 --> 00:12:11,080
The next time you're
giving it to your husband

237
00:12:11,151 --> 00:12:13,508
With the lights on,
could you draw the drapes?

238
00:12:37,391 --> 00:12:41,294
And roy offered to
take me to the park.

239
00:12:41,348 --> 00:12:44,369
Oh. well, isn't that lovely?

240
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:49,521
Do you wanna watch a movie? well,
i guess i'll read...

241
00:12:51,735 --> 00:12:53,182
I guess we could watch a movie.

242
00:12:53,236 --> 00:12:56,066
No. no, no. if you
want to read, go ahead.

243
00:13:01,343 --> 00:13:03,035
Good night.

244
00:13:04,771 --> 00:13:08,092
If you need anything,
just ring the bell. i'm...

245
00:13:08,544 --> 00:13:10,216
Right upstairs.

246
00:13:11,118 --> 00:13:13,044
I-i'm sure i'll be fine.

247
00:13:20,482 --> 00:13:21,690
Knock, knock.

248
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:24,062
Robin. come on in.

249
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,138
Can i ask you a favor? sure.

250
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:28,422
Susan and mike have
been so good to me.

251
00:13:28,491 --> 00:13:30,162
I wanna do something nice for them,
and i thought,

252
00:13:30,219 --> 00:13:32,342
Hey, maybe i should
bake them a cake.

253
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:34,122
Oh, that's very thoughtful.

254
00:13:34,192 --> 00:13:36,943
Well, feel free to use
whatever you need.

255
00:13:36,997 --> 00:13:38,443
Thank you.

256
00:13:41,913 --> 00:13:44,367
So what do i need?

257
00:13:44,438 --> 00:13:48,052
Robin, what exactly do
you know about cakes?

258
00:13:49,698 --> 00:13:51,208
Well, i know that if
you're gonna hide in one

259
00:13:51,253 --> 00:13:52,405
For more than an hour,

260
00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:55,098
The air holes have
got to be pretty big.

261
00:13:56,494 --> 00:13:57,308
All right, then.

262
00:13:57,363 --> 00:13:59,946
It looks like i will be
teaching you how to make a cake.

263
00:13:59,997 --> 00:14:02,646
Oh, yay! you rock, bree!

264
00:14:03,619 --> 00:14:05,098
I rock.

265
00:14:05,142 --> 00:14:06,974
Now the key to success

266
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,627
Is following the recipe exactly.

267
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,311
The secret to baking is precision.

268
00:14:12,365 --> 00:14:14,780
Got it. you're my hero.

269
00:14:16,401 --> 00:14:18,968
What are you doing?
making you my screensaver.

270
00:14:19,021 --> 00:14:20,284
Oh, that's sweet.

271
00:14:20,329 --> 00:14:23,048
You're replacing my cat.
he's eating noodles.

272
00:14:23,685 --> 00:14:25,548
Let's just do this.

273
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,370
Okay. Go get yourself an apron.

274
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,607
That is, like, the coolest
cake i've ever seen.

275
00:14:32,661 --> 00:14:34,122
Raspberry mocha.

276
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,184
Orson's favorite.

277
00:14:37,941 --> 00:14:40,756
I talked to him at the party.
he's nice.

278
00:14:40,818 --> 00:14:43,473
It must be tough having
him in a wheelchair.

279
00:14:43,566 --> 00:14:45,308
It's been challenging.

280
00:14:45,841 --> 00:14:47,097
Well, they say you can
get through anything

281
00:14:47,158 --> 00:14:48,940
If you have a solid marriage.

282
00:14:49,609 --> 00:14:51,065
Yes, well...

283
00:14:52,535 --> 00:14:55,086
Oh. i'm sorry.
i didn't mean to pry.

284
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:56,138
It's fine.

285
00:14:56,204 --> 00:14:58,662
Let's just say before his
accident there were issues,

286
00:14:58,714 --> 00:15:01,459
And now we're trying to put
the pieces back together.

287
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:03,478
Well, that's good for you.

288
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,834
So what's the piece you can't find?

289
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,415
Ah! now you are prying.

290
00:15:08,469 --> 00:15:09,723
What?

291
00:15:09,766 --> 00:15:11,519
We did make a cake together.

292
00:15:11,838 --> 00:15:14,404
Look, my grandmother always said

293
00:15:14,465 --> 00:15:15,695
That if you wanna
save your marriage,

294
00:15:15,762 --> 00:15:17,508
There's only one room to do it in.

295
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:21,641
The bedroom.

296
00:15:21,695 --> 00:15:23,708
Yeah, i got that.

297
00:15:24,002 --> 00:15:25,473
It's not about sex.

298
00:15:25,546 --> 00:15:27,860
It's about... closeness.

299
00:15:27,931 --> 00:15:29,378
We've lost our intimacy.

300
00:15:30,518 --> 00:15:31,982
Oh. honey.

301
00:15:32,025 --> 00:15:34,146
Sex is how men get intimate.

302
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:37,542
Well, i'm not even
sure he's capable.

303
00:15:37,596 --> 00:15:39,130
Oh, it doesn't matter.

304
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,622
His brain still works.

305
00:15:40,676 --> 00:15:43,532
And he can see you.
he can feel you touch him.

306
00:15:43,602 --> 00:15:45,440
He can hear what you say to him.

307
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:47,187
You know, i had this
regular customer--

308
00:15:47,289 --> 00:15:49,423
92 years old, in a wheelchair.

309
00:15:49,486 --> 00:15:51,676
I used to have to push the
oxygen tank out of the way

310
00:15:51,727 --> 00:15:52,846
To give him a lap dance.

311
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:57,558
I don't know if he's
even interested.

312
00:15:58,338 --> 00:15:59,786
Well, here's the thing.

313
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,734
Neither of us knows for sure,

314
00:16:01,812 --> 00:16:04,226
But only one of us can find out.

315
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:15,632
Hello, dear.

316
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:17,590
How was the bar mitzvah?
a boy became a man,

317
00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:19,227
and a rabbi blesseof this piece.

318
00:16:19,336 --> 00:16:22,233
Same old, same old.
how was your day?

319
00:16:22,302 --> 00:16:24,476
Oh, i've been passing
the time reading.

320
00:16:25,332 --> 00:16:28,016
Well, i suppose i should
get out of these clothes.

321
00:16:29,974 --> 00:16:33,797
Oh! peter tchaikovsky.
god bless you.

322
00:16:34,209 --> 00:16:36,121
Yes. i never tire of this piece.

323
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,766
It's extraordinary-
so moving, so...

324
00:16:38,836 --> 00:16:40,922
Sensual.

325
00:17:12,705 --> 00:17:14,296
Don't you wanna do that upstairs?

326
00:17:14,358 --> 00:17:16,084
You know, near the hamper.

327
00:17:16,194 --> 00:17:18,312
Actually, i'd rather do it...

328
00:17:19,269 --> 00:17:21,802
Right... Here.

329
00:17:29,971 --> 00:17:31,824
Why are you walking like that?

330
00:17:33,671 --> 00:17:35,574
Why do you think?

331
00:17:36,427 --> 00:17:38,154
I'm not sure.

332
00:17:39,143 --> 00:17:41,814
You're trying to make me feel
better about being paralyzed?

333
00:17:46,426 --> 00:17:48,682
Guess again, big boy.

334
00:17:51,942 --> 00:17:53,174
Well, if you're having a stroke,

335
00:17:53,244 --> 00:17:55,193
we're gonna make

336
00:18:02,231 --> 00:18:04,262
I do believe it's getting...

337
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:06,547
Hot in here.

338
00:18:15,937 --> 00:18:17,328
Are you all right?

339
00:18:17,376 --> 00:18:20,260
Yeah. just a second.
my earring's caught.

340
00:18:20,594 --> 00:18:22,611
Enjoy the music.

341
00:18:25,943 --> 00:18:27,211
Oh, let me help.

342
00:18:27,305 --> 00:18:29,942
No, no, no. i'm good.
stay there. i'm coming over.

343
00:18:29,996 --> 00:18:31,651
No, orson, i've got it.

344
00:18:35,706 --> 00:18:37,969
I'm sorry. i'm sorry.

345
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:40,253
I told you i didn't need any help!

346
00:18:40,315 --> 00:18:42,657
Well, in my defense,
that wasn't entirely clear.

347
00:18:42,712 --> 00:18:45,022
Forget it. this was stupid.

348
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:47,250
What was that?

349
00:18:47,303 --> 00:18:49,910
What do you think?
! it was a lap dance!

350
00:18:49,966 --> 00:18:52,051
That was a lap dance?

351
00:18:52,117 --> 00:18:54,438
I was trying to arouse you.

352
00:18:54,772 --> 00:18:56,827
You are aware i'm in wheelchair?
well, i thought

353
00:18:56,878 --> 00:18:59,928
You still might be interested
in that sort of thing. i am!

354
00:18:59,981 --> 00:19:01,739
Well, you certainly
don't act like it.

355
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:03,176
After the accident,

356
00:19:03,254 --> 00:19:05,636
I just never thought you
would ever consider...

357
00:19:10,906 --> 00:19:12,689
Oh, orson.

358
00:19:13,071 --> 00:19:14,686
Things will be awkward at first,

359
00:19:14,772 --> 00:19:17,249
But we can work on it.

360
00:19:17,312 --> 00:19:19,518
You're my husband.

361
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,722
I wanna be close to you.

362
00:19:21,792 --> 00:19:24,471
I wanna share your bed again,
even if it means

363
00:19:24,533 --> 00:19:28,272
Just holding your hand
before you fall asleep.

364
00:19:30,094 --> 00:19:31,590
Come here.

365
00:19:43,331 --> 00:19:45,866
Is this all right?

366
00:19:48,728 --> 00:19:50,511
Let's see--

367
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,483
I've got tchaikovsky on the stereo,

368
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:56,151
My wife in my arms.

369
00:20:20,482 --> 00:20:22,202
She and danny spent the
whole day together.

370
00:20:22,202 --> 00:20:23,568
What's left to say?

371
00:20:23,568 --> 00:20:26,791
This is out of control.
let's forbid ana to talk to him.

372
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:29,002
Yeah, forbid two teenagers-
that always works.

373
00:20:29,002 --> 00:20:31,169
Besides, what would we say--

374
00:20:31,169 --> 00:20:33,288
We overheard his parents talking
and we think they're evil?

375
00:20:33,288 --> 00:20:35,330
What do you think the bolens did?
i don't know,

376
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:37,836
But you don't go on the run for
not paying your cable bill.

377
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:39,929
They've been cagey ever
since they moved in.

378
00:20:39,929 --> 00:20:42,176
And nick doesn't work.
how do they have money?

379
00:20:42,176 --> 00:20:44,819
Maybe they're drug
dealers or gun runners.

380
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:46,435
Whatever they are, i don't want

381
00:20:46,436 --> 00:20:47,999
ana anywhere nem

382
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:50,316
She won't break up with him.
she will if we make her.

383
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:51,737
I told you that won't work.

384
00:20:51,737 --> 00:20:53,683
We need to come up with
a carrot, not a stick.

385
00:20:58,225 --> 00:20:59,050
Ana.

386
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,181
Privacy, please.

387
00:21:00,181 --> 00:21:02,164
I've got big news.
for me or for you?

388
00:21:02,164 --> 00:21:03,384
You! oh.

389
00:21:03,384 --> 00:21:06,487
I just got a call from my
good friend luke rayfield.

390
00:21:06,487 --> 00:21:08,157
I was a struggling
model in new york

391
00:21:08,158 --> 00:21:10,200
When he was a
struggling photographer.

392
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,713
Well, mostly i was his beard
for all his family functions.

393
00:21:12,713 --> 00:21:15,170
There was this one time-
is the part about me coming up?

394
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:15,863
Oh, yeah.

395
00:21:15,863 --> 00:21:19,123
Anyway, luke now has his
own modeling agency,

396
00:21:19,123 --> 00:21:21,388
And he's always looking
for new talent,

397
00:21:21,388 --> 00:21:22,950
So i sent him your picture.

398
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,654
Wait for it! wait for it.

399
00:21:26,294 --> 00:21:28,137
He wants to represent you.

400
00:21:28,961 --> 00:21:31,350
You may now begin screaming. aah!

401
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:33,442
Oh, i have to call danny!

402
00:21:33,442 --> 00:21:36,770
Oh, well, you know what?
danny can wait.

403
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:38,572
We need to go buy you
some new luggage.

404
00:21:38,572 --> 00:21:40,389
They want you in new
york immediately.

405
00:21:40,389 --> 00:21:43,722
Now? but, uh, don't i have
to finish high school?

406
00:21:43,722 --> 00:21:46,709
World war ii--germany lost.
korean war--korea lost.

407
00:21:46,709 --> 00:21:48,878
Vietnam war--we lost.
happy graduation.

408
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:52,446
What's wrong?

409
00:21:53,424 --> 00:21:55,734
I-i don't think i can go just yet.

410
00:21:56,156 --> 00:21:57,813
Why not?

411
00:21:58,921 --> 00:22:00,787
Danny and i have a plan.

412
00:22:00,787 --> 00:22:03,347
We're going to new york
together when i graduate.

413
00:22:06,614 --> 00:22:08,606
After everything
i've done for her...

414
00:22:08,606 --> 00:22:10,088
"danny and i are moving to new york

415
00:22:10,088 --> 00:22:11,702
"after i graduate. we're in love!

416
00:22:13,606 --> 00:22:15,472
Pour me some more wine before
i throw up. what's wrong?

417
00:22:16,462 --> 00:22:17,868
Oh, gaby got her niece a foot in

418
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:19,231
the door for a m

419
00:22:19,231 --> 00:22:21,380
And she's turning it down.
ooh, bad call.

420
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:25,416
I used to take ballet,
and i was pretty good at it, too.

421
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:29,022
And one time, this instructor
from a big ballet company

422
00:22:29,022 --> 00:22:31,536
Saw me perform, and--oh,
long story short,

423
00:22:31,536 --> 00:22:33,348
Two days later they
offered me a job.

424
00:22:33,594 --> 00:22:35,016
What happened?

425
00:22:35,016 --> 00:22:37,180
Bobby butterfield happened.

426
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:39,577
A boy. not just a boy.

427
00:22:39,577 --> 00:22:41,256
The boy.

428
00:22:41,256 --> 00:22:43,100
Oh, i was crazy about him,

429
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,762
Thought it was gonna last forever.

430
00:22:44,762 --> 00:22:46,418
So i passed on the job.

431
00:22:46,418 --> 00:22:50,057
And two months later,
he dumped me for louise mcmullen.

432
00:22:50,057 --> 00:22:52,447
And then a month after that,
i got into a car accident,

433
00:22:52,447 --> 00:22:53,526
Messed up my knee,

434
00:22:53,526 --> 00:22:55,862
And then it was good-bye, tutu.
hello ta-tas.

435
00:22:59,095 --> 00:22:59,956
That is fantastic!

436
00:22:59,803 --> 00:23:02,102
Did we just hear the same story?

437
00:23:02,102 --> 00:23:04,019
You have got to tell
that story to ana.

438
00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:05,698
Putting off your dreams

439
00:23:05,698 --> 00:23:07,946
And then having your life
spiral down the crapper?

440
00:23:07,946 --> 00:23:09,805
It couldn't be more perfect.

441
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,989
Well, i-i guess i
could talk to ana,

442
00:23:14,989 --> 00:23:16,107
If you think it would help her.

443
00:23:16,107 --> 00:23:18,601
Great. and don't be afraid
to turn on the waterworks.

444
00:23:18,601 --> 00:23:20,708
Nothin' sells pathetic
like stripper tears.

445
00:23:21,575 --> 00:23:22,722
Maybe it would help

446
00:23:22,722 --> 00:23:23,894
If i started taping you

447
00:23:23,894 --> 00:23:26,216
So you could hear
what it is you say.

448
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,584
Don't be discouraged

449
00:23:30,584 --> 00:23:32,384
If luke starts you off
with catalogue work.

450
00:23:32,384 --> 00:23:33,826
Just try to get your
face in the shot.

451
00:23:33,826 --> 00:23:34,871
A little tough to do
with a lawn mower,

452
00:23:37,811 --> 00:23:41,133
I was texting you.
oh, i was just coming over.

453
00:23:41,133 --> 00:23:43,215
Ooh. taking a trip?

454
00:23:44,417 --> 00:23:47,182
I'm... sure you two have
a lot to talk about.

455
00:23:47,182 --> 00:23:48,778
So i'll just take
these inside for you.

456
00:23:48,778 --> 00:23:50,445
Bye, danny.

457
00:23:50,445 --> 00:23:53,532
What do you need luggage for?

458
00:23:55,514 --> 00:23:58,246
I was just about to come
over and tell you right now.

459
00:23:58,246 --> 00:24:00,018
When did this happen?
i just found out, okay?

460
00:24:00,018 --> 00:24:02,542
Ana, i thought we were
supposed to go together.

461
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:06,848
Why can't you wait?
this is a huge opportunity.

462
00:24:06,848 --> 00:24:09,464
You should be saying,
"great, ana. go for it."

463
00:24:09,464 --> 00:24:10,907
If you can't support me,

464
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:12,313
Then maybe we shouldn't
even be together.

465
00:24:16,964 --> 00:24:18,492
Hey! hey, robin!

466
00:24:18,492 --> 00:24:20,230
Oh, hi. what's up?

467
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,602
I've been meaning to thank you.

468
00:24:21,602 --> 00:24:23,609
You little speech to ana
worked like a charm.

469
00:24:23,609 --> 00:24:24,863
I just took her to
the airport. great.

470
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:26,664
Mm-hmm. so, uh,
why was she fighting

471
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:28,015
with danny bol, flowers...

472
00:24:29,807 --> 00:24:31,414
They were breaking up.

473
00:24:32,108 --> 00:24:33,279
They were dating?

474
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,003
Yeah. that's the whole reason
i wanted you to talk to her,

475
00:24:36,003 --> 00:24:37,682
To convince her she was
screwing up her life,

476
00:24:37,682 --> 00:24:38,911
So i could ship her off to new york

477
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:39,900
And get her away from danny.

478
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,201
You didn't tell me that.

479
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:46,780
So i don't like being used. oh,

480
00:24:46,781 --> 00:24:48,234
don't get upset need to talk.

481
00:24:48,974 --> 00:24:50,753
Ana's gone. danny's
out of the picture.

482
00:24:50,753 --> 00:24:52,489
I owe ya big time.

483
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,911
Danny.

484
00:25:02,911 --> 00:25:05,182
Hey, i think we need to talk.

485
00:25:05,594 --> 00:25:07,302
Sorry. it's really not a good time.

486
00:25:07,302 --> 00:25:11,487
Actually, this is exactly the time.

487
00:25:16,487 --> 00:25:17,550
I just talked to luke.

488
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,750
Ana has settled into her dorm,

489
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,167
She's got all her classes lined up,

490
00:25:21,167 --> 00:25:24,112
And he's taking her new
head shots tomorrow.

491
00:25:24,112 --> 00:25:25,392
And the best part is,

492
00:25:25,392 --> 00:25:27,680
She is miles away from
the nearest bolen.

493
00:25:47,982 --> 00:25:49,316
Oh, perfect timing.

494
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:52,532
Something smells good.

495
00:25:52,532 --> 00:25:53,534
Thank you.

496
00:25:53,534 --> 00:25:56,004
Just putting on the finishing
touches before we eat.

497
00:25:57,528 --> 00:25:59,580
Oh, you spoil me. mm.

498
00:26:00,364 --> 00:26:02,016
Mm! what's wrong?

499
00:26:02,016 --> 00:26:02,958
Is it your back again?

500
00:26:02,958 --> 00:26:04,833
Yeah. i spent all day
working in a crawl space.

501
00:26:04,833 --> 00:26:07,033
Aw. i'll call the chiropractor
first thing in the morning.

502
00:26:07,033 --> 00:26:09,321
No need for that. i can fix it.

503
00:26:10,315 --> 00:26:11,991
Come here. ow!

504
00:26:11,991 --> 00:26:13,428
Oh, wait! wait! wait! wait!
what are you doin'?

505
00:26:13,428 --> 00:26:14,699
At double d's, the girls were

506
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,234
constantly throwingo make dinner.

507
00:26:16,234 --> 00:26:18,927
From sliding down that pole.
they all came to see me.

508
00:26:18,927 --> 00:26:23,232
Now just relax,
and one, two, three.

509
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:26,284
There. how do you feel?

510
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:29,027
Oh, my god. it's gone.

511
00:26:29,027 --> 00:26:30,921
The pain's gone.

512
00:26:30,921 --> 00:26:33,317
Wow! uh, thank you, robin.

513
00:26:33,317 --> 00:26:34,768
I-i was just gonna
give him a scotch

514
00:26:34,768 --> 00:26:36,331
And make him sleep the guest room.

515
00:26:36,331 --> 00:26:39,161
Seriously, you really fixed me up.

516
00:26:39,161 --> 00:26:40,616
Thanks. oh, please.

517
00:26:40,616 --> 00:26:41,948
After all you guys have done for

518
00:26:41,949 --> 00:26:43,114
me, it's the lent out again.

519
00:26:49,719 --> 00:26:51,203
I'm home!

520
00:26:51,203 --> 00:26:52,237
In here!

521
00:26:53,441 --> 00:26:57,200
No fast food tonight!
fire up the...

522
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,135
Microwave.

523
00:26:59,135 --> 00:27:02,265
Hey. my back went out again.

524
00:27:02,265 --> 00:27:04,682
Robin tried cracking it,
but it just didn't go deep enough.

525
00:27:04,682 --> 00:27:06,631
This is the way the
buddhist monks do it.

526
00:27:06,631 --> 00:27:08,617
It's the only way to get
through all that muscle.

527
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:12,959
Is there a problem, babe?

528
00:27:13,771 --> 00:27:16,101
No. no problem.

529
00:27:17,593 --> 00:27:19,317
It looks like you're in good hands.

530
00:27:19,317 --> 00:27:21,013
Or... feet.

531
00:27:21,185 --> 00:27:23,681
So i'll just, uh, go make dinner.

532
00:27:23,794 --> 00:27:25,889
Happy trails!

533
00:27:28,571 --> 00:27:30,451
How does that feel?

534
00:27:30,451 --> 00:27:32,381
Oh! yeah, yeah, do that! do that!

535
00:27:33,146 --> 00:27:36,396
Can you handle a little more?
oh! give me all you got.

536
00:27:36,396 --> 00:27:39,430
So i, uh, ran into
janice white today.

537
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:41,566
Says her husband is sick.

538
00:27:41,566 --> 00:27:43,388
Oh, wow, you're really stiff.

539
00:27:43,388 --> 00:27:45,401
Okay, let me try something else.

540
00:27:45,401 --> 00:27:46,703
Oh,you're the boss.

541
00:27:46,703 --> 00:27:48,699
Apparently, it's bacterial,

542
00:27:48,699 --> 00:27:51,089
And he's, uh, bloating like a pig.

543
00:27:51,089 --> 00:27:53,222
I'm gonna grab it and pull.

544
00:27:53,222 --> 00:27:54,729
Go for it!

545
00:27:54,729 --> 00:27:56,906
And there's a lot of diarrhea!

546
00:27:56,906 --> 00:27:59,486
Oh, yes! ohh! yes!

547
00:27:59,486 --> 00:28:02,009
Ohh, yes!

548
00:28:04,032 --> 00:28:06,233
This is incredible.

549
00:28:06,233 --> 00:28:07,905
Those monks really know
what they're doing.

550
00:28:07,905 --> 00:28:10,207
Oh, yeah.

551
00:28:10,207 --> 00:28:12,564
When do they find time to pray?

552
00:28:17,619 --> 00:28:19,758
Hey! i'm on my way to school.

553
00:28:19,758 --> 00:28:22,733
The faculty volunteered to make
sandwiches for the homeless.

554
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:25,860
Okay, well, i'll,
uh, see you later.

555
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,520
What's the matter?

556
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,772
I, uh, re-piped an entire house.
even my hair hurts.

557
00:28:30,772 --> 00:28:32,979
Aw, you poor thing.
you want the heating pad?

558
00:28:32,979 --> 00:28:34,311
No. no, i'll be okay.

559
00:28:34,311 --> 00:28:36,726
Well, i won't be gone long.
feel better.

560
00:28:36,726 --> 00:28:39,356
I'll just have robin crack
my back when she gets home.

561
00:28:39,356 --> 00:28:41,843
Or i could stay here and do it.

562
00:28:41,843 --> 00:28:43,787
What about the homeless?

563
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:47,030
Please. they've gone
this long without food.

564
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:48,740
What's another ten minutes?

565
00:28:49,751 --> 00:28:52,073
Susan, do you have a problem
with robin working on me?

566
00:28:52,816 --> 00:28:54,307
Of course not.

567
00:28:54,307 --> 00:28:57,143
But she's not here,
and you're in pain.

568
00:28:57,283 --> 00:28:59,565
So why don't you let
me take a shot at it?

569
00:28:59,565 --> 00:29:02,379
A shot at it? we're
talking about my spine.

570
00:29:02,379 --> 00:29:05,422
Mike, robin didn't exactly
go to medical school

571
00:29:05,422 --> 00:29:06,590
Between lap dances.

572
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:09,085
I saw what she did.
i can do the same thing.

573
00:29:09,085 --> 00:29:11,358
Okay. here we go.

574
00:29:12,181 --> 00:29:16,147
Ow? no "ow." that's
exactly what robin did.

575
00:29:16,147 --> 00:29:17,066
No, she didn't yank it.

576
00:29:17,066 --> 00:29:18,785
It's my arm,
not an emergency brake.

577
00:29:18,785 --> 00:29:20,687
Shh. just take a deep breath.

578
00:29:20,687 --> 00:29:22,811
The key is relaxation. okay.

579
00:29:23,711 --> 00:29:25,656
One... two...

580
00:29:28,441 --> 00:29:31,479
You know, if you hadn't
moved when i said "three"...

581
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:34,103
Just go.

582
00:29:43,243 --> 00:29:45,821
Oh, my god, susan.
is mike gonna be all right?

583
00:29:45,821 --> 00:29:48,531
Can i see him? sure, sweetie.

584
00:29:48,531 --> 00:29:50,845
Just don't climb on the bed.

585
00:29:55,268 --> 00:29:56,904
Look, why didn't you wait for me?

586
00:29:56,904 --> 00:29:58,740
I would've taken care of
mike's back, no problem.

587
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,989
Well, i wanted to do it myself.

588
00:30:01,623 --> 00:30:04,558
Oh. okay. hmm.

589
00:30:06,752 --> 00:30:08,295
I'm lying. i didn't wanna do it.

590
00:30:08,295 --> 00:30:11,391
I just really wanted
you not to do it.

591
00:30:12,626 --> 00:30:13,944
I don't understand.

592
00:30:14,613 --> 00:30:18,286
God, i've been trying really
hard to be cool about all this.

593
00:30:18,286 --> 00:30:24,062
But when i walked in and i
saw you all over mike...

594
00:30:24,062 --> 00:30:26,427
When--when i was cracking his back?

595
00:30:27,304 --> 00:30:28,937
I was just trying to help.

596
00:30:28,937 --> 00:30:31,268
While you wearing next to nothing

597
00:30:31,268 --> 00:30:33,874
And straddling my husband.

598
00:30:33,874 --> 00:30:36,804
How was i supposed to react?
you used to be a stripper.

599
00:30:41,797 --> 00:30:43,953
Oh, don't cry. why are you crying?

600
00:30:43,953 --> 00:30:45,493
Strippers are supposed to be tough.

601
00:30:45,493 --> 00:30:47,337
Stop calling me that.

602
00:30:48,528 --> 00:30:50,320
Yes, i was a stripper.

603
00:30:51,041 --> 00:30:52,240
But you know what?

604
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,826
You were the only person who
never treated me like one,

605
00:30:54,826 --> 00:30:57,222
Until now. oh.

606
00:30:57,972 --> 00:31:00,984
And i'm really sorry if i
crossed the line with mike.

607
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,334
You know, i guess after working
nine years in the club,

608
00:31:03,334 --> 00:31:05,683
I just don't know where
the line is anymore.

609
00:31:06,507 --> 00:31:07,927
Uh, it's...

610
00:31:08,994 --> 00:31:10,179
I-i overreacted.

611
00:31:12,176 --> 00:31:14,198
Maybe i should move out.

612
00:31:14,198 --> 00:31:17,292
No. robin, you don't
have to do that.

613
00:31:20,431 --> 00:31:22,913
I want us to be friends
for a very long time.

614
00:31:22,913 --> 00:31:25,691
So, yes, i do.

615
00:31:45,407 --> 00:31:46,412
Hello.

616
00:31:46,412 --> 00:31:48,671
Hi. susan asked me to bring
you some of your mail.

617
00:31:48,671 --> 00:31:49,720
Oh, thank you.

618
00:31:50,203 --> 00:31:53,059
I'm robin. we met at your party.

619
00:31:53,059 --> 00:31:54,839
Yeah, i remember.

620
00:31:56,031 --> 00:31:57,405
How's it going?

621
00:31:57,405 --> 00:32:00,233
Oh! i take it you heard
about my little vacation

622
00:32:00,233 --> 00:32:01,792
At fairview behavioral.

623
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,697
Yes. i heard.

624
00:32:03,697 --> 00:32:05,498
Well, to be honest,

625
00:32:05,498 --> 00:32:06,793
It's been hard,

626
00:32:06,793 --> 00:32:09,008
Especially coming back
to this big, empty house.

627
00:32:09,008 --> 00:32:11,278
Not to mention the
subtle glances i get

628
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:12,374
From people judging me.

629
00:32:12,374 --> 00:32:14,947
But you know what i say?
to hell with them.

630
00:32:15,782 --> 00:32:16,795
Thank you.

631
00:32:17,512 --> 00:32:18,919
I'll see you.

632
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:23,006
Oh, hey, and if this
house gets too lonely,

633
00:32:23,006 --> 00:32:24,736
I'm looking for a room to rent.

634
00:32:24,736 --> 00:32:26,294
I mean, mike and susan are great,

635
00:32:26,294 --> 00:32:28,955
But it's gettin' a little
crowded over there.

636
00:32:28,955 --> 00:32:32,063
Okay, i'll keep it in mind.

637
00:32:32,063 --> 00:32:33,408
Mm, for what it's worth,

638
00:32:33,408 --> 00:32:34,823
It might take the heat off of you.

639
00:32:34,823 --> 00:32:37,334
No one judges the woman
from the looney bin

640
00:32:37,334 --> 00:32:39,992
When there's a stripper next door.

641
00:32:46,693 --> 00:32:48,151
This is great.

642
00:32:48,506 --> 00:32:51,245
I haven't had a female
roommate since...

643
00:32:51,245 --> 00:32:52,760
After college.

644
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,228
Let's hear it for girl power!

645
00:32:55,258 --> 00:32:58,392
You know, we should go out and
have a drink to celebrate.

646
00:32:58,392 --> 00:32:59,746
Oh, i don't know.

647
00:32:59,746 --> 00:33:02,310
My therapist says i should
get out more, but...

648
00:33:03,321 --> 00:33:05,969
Even being over at gaby's
house the other day, it's...

649
00:33:05,969 --> 00:33:08,128
It's just hard.

650
00:33:08,128 --> 00:33:09,769
Yeah, i get that.

651
00:33:10,629 --> 00:33:13,479
So what was it like being
in a mental hospital?

652
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,194
You know...

653
00:33:19,707 --> 00:33:22,151
As much fun as one would expect.

654
00:33:22,151 --> 00:33:24,510
I only ask 'cause of my mom.

655
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:26,951
She used to use me
as a punching bag,

656
00:33:26,951 --> 00:33:29,538
And i always dreamed about
having her committed.

657
00:33:30,565 --> 00:33:31,848
I'm sorry.

658
00:33:33,165 --> 00:33:34,978
Oh. no, it was only
when she was drunk.

659
00:33:34,978 --> 00:33:36,858
It was her way of coping

660
00:33:36,858 --> 00:33:38,719
With my dad cheating
on her all the time.

661
00:33:38,768 --> 00:33:41,732
I remember wishing that he was ugly

662
00:33:41,732 --> 00:33:43,542
So other women wouldn't want him.

663
00:33:43,542 --> 00:33:45,619
But he looked like clint eastwood.

664
00:33:47,653 --> 00:33:51,022
Anyway, mom had to take
out her anger somewhere,

665
00:33:51,022 --> 00:33:54,076
And i was an easier target
than a 6'4" trucker.

666
00:33:55,832 --> 00:33:58,166
Actually...

667
00:33:58,952 --> 00:34:00,692
It was pretty bad at the hospital.

668
00:34:01,584 --> 00:34:04,831
People always say it's the
screaming that gets to you.

669
00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:10,229
But at least screaming means
you're alive, you know?

670
00:34:12,237 --> 00:34:13,643
What i couldn't take

671
00:34:13,643 --> 00:34:17,227
Were the people with
the blank stares.

672
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:20,284
There was this one woman

673
00:34:20,284 --> 00:34:22,345
Who sat frozen in
the garden all day,

674
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:28,503
Whispering the words to
"old macdonald had a farm"

675
00:34:28,503 --> 00:34:29,974
Over and over and over.

676
00:34:30,996 --> 00:34:33,249
The doctors ever take
offense when she got to

677
00:34:33,249 --> 00:34:35,811
"here a quack, there a quack,
everywhere a quack-quack"?

678
00:34:44,556 --> 00:34:46,044
You know what?

679
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:50,285
If there were ever two people

680
00:34:50,285 --> 00:34:51,796
Who deserved a night
out drinking...

681
00:34:52,407 --> 00:34:54,163
It's us.

682
00:34:56,213 --> 00:34:57,431
Okay... mm-hmm?

683
00:34:57,431 --> 00:34:58,852
Quid pro quo. mm?

684
00:34:58,852 --> 00:35:01,950
I told you what it was like
to go to bed in restraints,

685
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:03,824
So i think it's only fair

686
00:35:03,824 --> 00:35:06,006
That you tell me what it
was like being a stripper.

687
00:35:06,006 --> 00:35:07,952
Ooh. it was brutal.

688
00:35:07,952 --> 00:35:11,492
If i had a dollar for every
guy that slapped me on my butt

689
00:35:11,492 --> 00:35:12,916
Just 'cause he felt like it...

690
00:35:12,916 --> 00:35:15,455
Come to think of it, i do.

691
00:35:17,046 --> 00:35:20,425
Excuse me. uh,
my friend and i were wondering

692
00:35:20,425 --> 00:35:21,895
If you'd like to
join us at our table.

693
00:35:23,123 --> 00:35:26,254
No, thank you.
it's girls night out.

694
00:35:26,254 --> 00:35:28,988
Two beautiful women in a bar.
can't blame a guy for asking.

695
00:35:28,988 --> 00:35:32,852
Uh, we're over there if
you decide to go coed.

696
00:35:35,506 --> 00:35:37,401
Is it bad that i wanna
go sit with them?

697
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:39,160
You do? yeah!

698
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,100
It's been a while since a guy
that cute has flirted with me.

699
00:35:45,158 --> 00:35:46,969
You know what? let's do it.

700
00:35:46,969 --> 00:35:48,013
Really?

701
00:35:48,013 --> 00:35:51,333
Yes. you look way too hot
to waste it on just me.

702
00:35:51,333 --> 00:35:53,162
Shall we? mm!

703
00:35:56,374 --> 00:35:58,024
Come on. you've
gotta have a secret.

704
00:35:58,024 --> 00:36:00,155
Nope. it's shampoo and conditioner.

705
00:36:00,155 --> 00:36:01,560
Well, it looks amazing.

706
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,611
You should be on the
cover of hair magazines.

707
00:36:03,611 --> 00:36:05,408
What is it you said you do?
i didn't,

708
00:36:07,746 --> 00:36:10,718
Her own catering company.
oh, well, thinking about it.

709
00:36:10,718 --> 00:36:12,084
Cooking's a passion of mine.

710
00:36:12,084 --> 00:36:14,852
But a lot has to happen before
i start my own business.

711
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:21,084
I know. you're a model. no.

712
00:36:21,084 --> 00:36:24,416
Oh. uh... dental hygienist? no.

713
00:36:24,416 --> 00:36:26,711
Oh, i know. you're a
flight attendant. mnh-mnh.

714
00:36:27,392 --> 00:36:28,454
You may as well tell me,

715
00:36:28,454 --> 00:36:30,212
Or i'm just gonna keep
guessing all night.

716
00:36:30,212 --> 00:36:31,870
She's a stripper, okay?

717
00:36:34,961 --> 00:36:37,445
Ex-stripper. i'm sorry.

718
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:40,729
Oh, hey, why are you apologizing?
we love strippers.

719
00:36:40,729 --> 00:36:43,016
Yeah. they're like
angels of mercy...

720
00:36:43,016 --> 00:36:44,240
That show their boobs.

721
00:36:45,514 --> 00:36:48,766
We should probably get going.

722
00:36:48,766 --> 00:36:52,126
W-what are you talking about?
we haven't even danced yet.

723
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:54,519
Oh, i don't really
feel like dancing,

724
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:56,239
Although i can't speak
for katherine here.

725
00:36:56,239 --> 00:36:57,906
Well, it's just,
i wanna dance with you.

726
00:36:57,906 --> 00:37:01,268
You're not attracted to
someone who's classy, witty,

727
00:37:01,268 --> 00:37:03,357
Not to mention
breathtakingly beautiful?

728
00:37:03,357 --> 00:37:07,248
No offense to your friend,
but you're more my type.

729
00:37:07,248 --> 00:37:09,444
Oh. well, in that case,

730
00:37:09,444 --> 00:37:12,120
I guess i'll just keep
her all to myself.

731
00:37:17,874 --> 00:37:19,861
Night, guys.

732
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:28,134
God...

733
00:37:28,134 --> 00:37:31,568
The look on their faces...
oh, i know.

734
00:37:31,568 --> 00:37:34,724
It was the perfect combo
of "i am so turned on"

735
00:37:34,724 --> 00:37:36,726
And "i am so going home alone."

736
00:37:37,594 --> 00:37:39,950
You should remember that

737
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:41,680
The next time you want
to get out of a bad date.

738
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,788
Oh, no, i don't think so.

739
00:37:44,677 --> 00:37:46,551
Those two pigs confirmed

740
00:37:46,551 --> 00:37:48,127
What i've been thinking
for a while now--

741
00:37:48,127 --> 00:37:50,751
I think it's time for
me to give up on men.

742
00:37:50,751 --> 00:37:52,941
Mm. amen, sister.

743
00:37:52,941 --> 00:37:56,444
It's official.
my dating days are over.

744
00:37:56,444 --> 00:37:58,844
I mean, you don't have
to take it that far.

745
00:37:58,844 --> 00:38:00,904
You could always just do what i did

746
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:02,978
And explore other options.

747
00:38:03,605 --> 00:38:05,099
What do you mean?

748
00:38:05,995 --> 00:38:07,654
Cast a wider net?

749
00:38:07,654 --> 00:38:09,176
Expand the pool?

750
00:38:11,018 --> 00:38:13,637
Date chicks?

751
00:38:16,712 --> 00:38:19,397
So you're... yep.

752
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:21,445
Card-carrying.

753
00:38:25,747 --> 00:38:29,436
I thought that kiss
felt awfully convincing.

754
00:38:30,287 --> 00:38:33,475
Well, i mean, i dated guys
for a long time and...

755
00:38:34,365 --> 00:38:36,247
I just never really
felt a connection.

756
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:38,061
And then i started stripping,

757
00:38:38,061 --> 00:38:41,520
And i was surrounded by all
these confident, sexy women,

758
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,550
And i realized,

759
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:44,285
"robin, sweetie, you have been

760
00:38:44,286 --> 00:38:46,137
barking up the wrong tree.

761
00:38:46,982 --> 00:38:49,227
Yeah, i think i got the right tree.

762
00:38:49,227 --> 00:38:51,520
Just sick of barking.

763
00:38:52,146 --> 00:38:55,177
Well, suit yourself.

764
00:38:59,068 --> 00:39:01,792
Uh, you're okay with this, right?

765
00:39:01,792 --> 00:39:03,950
I mean, it's not gonna
affect anything with us?

766
00:39:04,897 --> 00:39:07,873
I-i don't see why it would.

767
00:39:08,833 --> 00:39:10,362
Okay.

768
00:39:27,669 --> 00:39:30,473
Hey, robin. what are you up to?

769
00:39:30,473 --> 00:39:33,152
Just out for a walk.
it's such a nice day.

770
00:39:33,152 --> 00:39:35,908
Yeah, it is. so how do you
like the neighborhood?

771
00:39:35,908 --> 00:39:37,997
Is everyone treatin' you okay?
i guess so.

772
00:39:37,997 --> 00:39:40,361
No one's giving you any guff
about about being a stripper,

773
00:39:40,361 --> 00:39:41,765
Are they? oh, no.

774
00:39:41,765 --> 00:39:45,696
I just wanna make sure,
'cause trust me, i've been there.

775
00:39:46,691 --> 00:39:50,419
Way back when, i was sorta
in the sex trade myself.

776
00:39:50,419 --> 00:39:51,846
Oh, yeah.

777
00:39:52,403 --> 00:39:55,011
I used to model women's
foundation garments

778
00:39:55,011 --> 00:39:56,429
For sears, roebuck.

779
00:39:56,429 --> 00:39:58,263
These breasts put
me through college.

780
00:39:59,611 --> 00:40:01,430
They're real, by the way.

781
00:40:02,214 --> 00:40:03,879
They look real.

782
00:40:03,879 --> 00:40:05,283
Yeah.

783
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:09,098
Anyway, i'm glad that people
are treating you nice.

784
00:40:09,726 --> 00:40:12,007
You know what the best part is?

785
00:40:12,907 --> 00:40:15,613
They actually see me.

786
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:17,497
See you?

787
00:40:17,497 --> 00:40:19,546
I spent a lot of years

788
00:40:19,546 --> 00:40:21,985
Working in a place where people
stared at me all night long.

789
00:40:21,985 --> 00:40:25,173
But no one ever really... saw me.

790
00:40:25,883 --> 00:40:27,198
You know what i mean?

791
00:40:27,198 --> 00:40:28,588
I do.

792
00:40:28,588 --> 00:40:30,236
And when i first got here,

793
00:40:30,236 --> 00:40:33,188
I thought it was gonna
be the same thing. but...

794
00:40:35,465 --> 00:40:37,484
I get the feeling your neighbors

795
00:40:37,484 --> 00:40:41,327
See past all the stuff that
people usually look at.

796
00:40:41,327 --> 00:40:44,119
It makes me feel really good.

797
00:40:44,785 --> 00:40:46,299
I'm glad.

798
00:40:47,819 --> 00:40:50,223
Robin gallagher was right.

799
00:40:50,424 --> 00:40:53,631
The people she had
met on wisteria lane

800
00:40:53,631 --> 00:40:55,437
Had really looked at her,

801
00:40:55,791 --> 00:40:59,589
And they had seen her
sense of morality,

802
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,179
Her loyal heart...

803
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:07,773
Her surprising insight,

804
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,832
Her forgiving nature.

805
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:17,474
Some people had even taken notice

806
00:41:17,474 --> 00:41:19,792
Of her incredible beauty...

807
00:41:23,168 --> 00:41:26,530
And they were surprised to discover

808
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:29,928
They liked what they saw.

809
