1
00:00:00,404 --> 00:00:02,373
Previously on desperate housewives

2
00:00:02,374 --> 00:00:04,589
this thief was trying
to steal your truck!

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:07,158
You're the guy who's four months
behind on his payments? Yeah.

4
00:00:07,192 --> 00:00:11,853
Mike reluctantly borrowed
money from Carlos.

5
00:00:11,854 --> 00:00:14,565
Tell me how much you need.

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,100
Andrew did his homework.

7
00:00:16,134 --> 00:00:18,703
I made a few calls.
Turns out the golden child

8
00:00:18,737 --> 00:00:21,138
never got his degree. I left school

9
00:00:21,173 --> 00:00:23,164
when the doctor told me
my mother was terminal.

10
00:00:23,165 --> 00:00:24,902
I can save you a phone
call and bring in

11
00:00:24,903 --> 00:00:27,511
her death certificate. That's okay.

12
00:00:27,546 --> 00:00:29,981
The worst mistake I ever made
in my life was having you!

13
00:00:30,015 --> 00:00:32,048
A killer...

14
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:33,649
Got an invitation.

15
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:36,419
We would like it if you
would move in with us. Okay.

16
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:38,587
And Angie revealed her past.

17
00:00:38,588 --> 00:00:40,522
I got involved with
a really bad guy--

18
00:00:40,523 --> 00:00:42,485
Danny's father.

19
00:00:47,676 --> 00:00:49,064
Many years ago,

20
00:00:49,065 --> 00:00:51,634
a terrorist fell in
love with a woman.

21
00:00:55,772 --> 00:00:58,040
This woman believed
in the terrorist

22
00:00:58,075 --> 00:01:00,042
and his cause...

23
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:06,316
Until an undercover
Agent showed up,

24
00:01:06,317 --> 00:01:08,184
determined to stop them.

25
00:01:10,465 --> 00:01:12,867
The terrorist wanted to attack

26
00:01:12,901 --> 00:01:16,204
those he felt were
hurting the planet,

27
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:21,609
so he got the woman to
help him build a bomb.

28
00:01:21,731 --> 00:01:24,111
But something went wrong,

29
00:01:24,146 --> 00:01:28,032
and someone was
unexpectedly killed.

30
00:01:28,831 --> 00:01:31,519
The terrorist didn't care.

31
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,755
He said it was unavoidable.

32
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:38,893
The woman wanted
to turn herself in,

33
00:01:38,927 --> 00:01:42,276
but she was pregnant.

34
00:01:42,277 --> 00:01:45,800
So the Agent convinced
her to run away with him,

35
00:01:45,834 --> 00:01:49,403
and he'd raise the
child as his own.

36
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:53,874
So they escaped from the terrorist,

37
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:56,844
hoping and praying

38
00:01:56,878 --> 00:01:59,780
he would never find them.

39
00:02:00,837 --> 00:02:02,782
Unfortunately...

40
00:02:02,783 --> 00:02:04,638
He did.

41
00:02:04,639 --> 00:02:08,208
Hey. If it isn't double
cappuccino, extra hot.

42
00:02:08,242 --> 00:02:10,410
You know me so well.

43
00:02:10,444 --> 00:02:12,712
Just made chocolate scones.

44
00:02:12,747 --> 00:02:14,714
Interested?

45
00:02:14,749 --> 00:02:16,349
Ah, what the hell?

46
00:02:16,384 --> 00:02:19,186
Might as well live dangerously.

47
00:02:19,527 --> 00:02:20,646
So how's the novel comin'?

48
00:02:20,647 --> 00:02:22,596
Almost done.

49
00:02:22,597 --> 00:02:24,558
Endings are a bitch.

50
00:02:24,592 --> 00:02:26,813
I really need to
surprise my audience.

51
00:02:28,262 --> 00:02:30,797
Hey. I know you're my dad...

52
00:02:30,831 --> 00:02:32,688
But you still gotta close
the door when you come in.

53
00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:35,101
Oh, sorry. Mm-hmm.

54
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:38,171
No, I was just gonna, uh,
I was gonna ask you somethin'.

55
00:02:38,172 --> 00:02:40,805
You want to join your old
man for a run tonight?

56
00:02:40,806 --> 00:02:43,543
Uh, dad, you don't run. You jog.

57
00:02:43,578 --> 00:02:45,212
And no.

58
00:02:45,246 --> 00:02:47,324
Come on. I'll be going by the park.
It'll be real pretty.

59
00:02:47,325 --> 00:02:48,720
I'm working Eddie's
shift tonight. Ah.

60
00:02:48,721 --> 00:02:50,746
I'm gonna be here late.

61
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,812
But I am proud of you.

62
00:02:56,551 --> 00:03:01,261
Keep it up. Yeah.
Thanks, coach. Mm-hmm.

63
00:03:01,295 --> 00:03:02,762
See you at home.

64
00:03:08,436 --> 00:03:09,903
That's your dad?

65
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:11,637
Yeah.

66
00:03:11,638 --> 00:03:14,481
I should have introduced you.
You'd like him.

67
00:03:14,482 --> 00:03:17,911
Yeah, I bet I would.
So he's a runner?

68
00:03:17,945 --> 00:03:19,913
Every night, even when he's sick.

69
00:03:19,947 --> 00:03:21,448
You can't stop him.

70
00:03:23,184 --> 00:03:25,085
He's pretty inspiring.

71
00:03:25,758 --> 00:03:27,754
Inspiring?

72
00:03:27,788 --> 00:03:30,523
Don't guys your age
usually hate their dads?

73
00:03:30,558 --> 00:03:32,489
We've had our issues.

74
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:35,945
But my dad's sacrificed
a lot for me.

75
00:03:37,498 --> 00:03:40,834
I figure this is
how I pay him back.

76
00:03:45,006 --> 00:03:46,539
You're right.

77
00:03:48,609 --> 00:03:51,557
Payback's really important.

78
00:03:52,931 --> 00:03:54,413
All right, back in a bit.

79
00:03:54,414 --> 00:03:55,155
How long are you gonna be?

80
00:03:55,156 --> 00:03:57,590
Just long enough to get
a little sweaty. Mwah.

81
00:03:57,624 --> 00:03:59,892
You be careful. Yeah.

82
00:04:05,701 --> 00:04:08,500
It took the terrorist 20 years

83
00:04:08,501 --> 00:04:11,327
to find the people
who had betrayed him.

84
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:15,975
What the...

85
00:04:23,902 --> 00:04:26,800
And his plan for revenge...

86
00:04:26,801 --> 00:04:30,323
Was just getting started.

87
00:04:30,324 --> 00:04:41,324
Sync by YYeTs.net
www.addic7ed.com

88
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:45,982
Our mothers tell us to
beware of mysterious men.

89
00:04:47,574 --> 00:04:50,194
Don't talk to them in the park.

90
00:04:51,475 --> 00:04:54,337
Don't take their candy.

91
00:04:56,271 --> 00:04:59,047
Don't get into their cars.

92
00:05:00,072 --> 00:05:02,593
And whatever you do...

93
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:06,564
Don't let them into the house.

94
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:11,235
But what do we do when mother

95
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:14,535
has already invited them in?

96
00:05:14,536 --> 00:05:16,740
Oh, my gosh.

97
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:18,977
Eddie, what have you done?

98
00:05:18,978 --> 00:05:21,314
I saw you were running
low on supplies,

99
00:05:21,315 --> 00:05:22,726
so I went to the store for you.

100
00:05:22,727 --> 00:05:24,715
Oh, you didn't need to do that.

101
00:05:24,749 --> 00:05:27,051
Hey, you're cool
enough to take me in.

102
00:05:27,085 --> 00:05:29,619
I gotta earn my keep somehow.

103
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,720
I bought fresh vegetables.

104
00:05:30,721 --> 00:05:34,457
Okay, now you're just
trying to make me cry.

105
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:38,613
Is that the laundry? I'll get that.

106
00:05:38,614 --> 00:05:42,900
Oh, that's okay. It's Porter's turn.
I can't, mom. I'm late.

107
00:05:42,934 --> 00:05:46,003
You can spare five minutes
to put clothes in the dryer.

108
00:05:46,037 --> 00:05:49,106
No, I can't. Jeremy and Dave are
waiting to take me to the mall.

109
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,276
You are not leaving wet
clothes in that washer.

110
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,144
Mom, chill. It's water.

111
00:05:54,179 --> 00:05:57,147
Hey, don't talk to
your mother like that.

112
00:05:59,384 --> 00:06:01,271
Okay, that's my ride. I gotta go.

113
00:06:01,272 --> 00:06:04,221
Unh-unh. After the laundry.

114
00:06:04,444 --> 00:06:07,014
What a bitch.

115
00:06:07,748 --> 00:06:08,959
Hey!

116
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:09,914
Tell her you're sorry. Hey!

117
00:06:09,915 --> 00:06:11,657
Get off me! Apologize!

118
00:06:11,658 --> 00:06:12,988
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie!

119
00:06:12,989 --> 00:06:14,448
He shouldn't talk to you like that!

120
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:15,991
Okay, okay!
I'm sure he's very sorry.

121
00:06:16,025 --> 00:06:18,126
Stop! Stop it! Stop. Let him up.

122
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:29,824
You okay? I'm fine.

123
00:06:29,825 --> 00:06:31,783
Go join your friends.

124
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,899
Go on.

125
00:06:36,736 --> 00:06:39,538
I'm sorry.

126
00:06:39,573 --> 00:06:43,042
I just can't watch
you be disrespected.

127
00:06:45,112 --> 00:06:47,680
I'll take care of the laundry.

128
00:06:56,423 --> 00:06:58,288
Hey, Carlos. Uh, here's the money--

129
00:06:58,289 --> 00:07:00,826
for the church raffle!
Thanks, Mike!

130
00:07:00,861 --> 00:07:03,162
Now sister Mary can finally
replace her wooden...

131
00:07:03,196 --> 00:07:05,164
Gaby's home. Oh, God. Sorry.

132
00:07:05,198 --> 00:07:07,068
I just wanted to bring you the
first payment for the loan.

133
00:07:07,069 --> 00:07:10,193
And thanks again. You really
saved my ass. No problem.

134
00:07:10,194 --> 00:07:12,029
And just so you know,
I'm making a lot of cutbacks

135
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,959
so I can pay you back quicker-
no vacations, basic cable.

136
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,595
I even convinced m.J.
That Mrs. McCluskey's house

137
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:19,673
is summer camp.
Look, don't go crazy.

138
00:07:19,674 --> 00:07:21,332
Just pay it back when you can.

139
00:07:21,366 --> 00:07:22,753
And let's make sure
Gaby doesn't find out.

140
00:07:22,754 --> 00:07:25,002
So she can tell Susan? No problem.

141
00:07:25,036 --> 00:07:27,541
I gotta get going. Bye. Hey,

142
00:07:27,542 --> 00:07:29,441
and uh, give my best
to sister Carrie.

143
00:07:29,442 --> 00:07:32,242
Mary. Mary!

144
00:07:39,226 --> 00:07:41,027
I know, right?

145
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:44,424
It's the middle of the afternoon.
What are you doing?

146
00:07:44,538 --> 00:07:47,166
Why don't you come
upstairs and find out?

147
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:51,671
No, thanks. I can't afford it.

148
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:55,043
What? Every time you
offer me afternoon sex,

149
00:07:55,044 --> 00:07:58,344
it's because you want something,
and it is not afternoon sex.

150
00:08:01,179 --> 00:08:04,143
All right, fine. Check this out.

151
00:08:05,643 --> 00:08:07,645
Where were you even hiding this?

152
00:08:07,646 --> 00:08:10,139
Oh. That is a ski chalet in Aspen.

153
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,108
It's for sale, and I want it.

154
00:08:12,142 --> 00:08:13,757
Sorry, hon, not gonna happen.

155
00:08:13,758 --> 00:08:16,522
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
That was just my opening offer.

156
00:08:16,523 --> 00:08:21,617
What if I see your afternoon sex
and raise you... honeymoon sex?

157
00:08:23,787 --> 00:08:27,256
No. No, I can't. All of our cash
is tied up in a business deal.

158
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,628
What kind of business deal? Ah,

159
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:30,659
you don't want me to bore
you with the details.

160
00:08:30,694 --> 00:08:33,028
Half that money is mine. Bore me.

161
00:08:33,063 --> 00:08:35,331
This conversation is over.

162
00:08:35,365 --> 00:08:37,733
Now if you're interested
in going upstairs

163
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:41,303
and making love to your
husband simply because you...

164
00:08:41,338 --> 00:08:43,672
Okay.

165
00:08:47,418 --> 00:08:50,045
Like it? I've been
practicing all day.

166
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,983
Susan, why is there a
big-ass piano in our house?

167
00:08:54,017 --> 00:08:56,419
Actually, big-ass
stopped making pianos.

168
00:08:56,453 --> 00:09:00,620
This is a Yamaha.

169
00:09:00,924 --> 00:09:02,658
So I'm...

170
00:09:02,692 --> 00:09:04,126
Curious...

171
00:09:04,762 --> 00:09:06,996
How much did this thing cost?

172
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,898
It was free.

173
00:09:09,797 --> 00:09:13,602
You remember dear, sweet,
98-year-old aunt Regina?

174
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:15,805
The one you called
"the crypt keeper"?

175
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,007
Mike, that was okay
when she was alive.

176
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:20,464
Now she's a dead lady
giving us really cool stuff,

177
00:09:20,465 --> 00:09:23,712
so a little respect? Okay.
As long as it was free.

178
00:09:23,747 --> 00:09:26,749
Yeah, um, but as far
as Gaby's concerned,

179
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,350
it cost 30 grand.

180
00:09:28,385 --> 00:09:29,933
What? Why?

181
00:09:29,934 --> 00:09:32,091
Well, I love Gaby, but for years,

182
00:09:32,092 --> 00:09:34,790
she has been flaunting how
much they spend on her house

183
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,892
and her car and her jewelry.

184
00:09:36,926 --> 00:09:40,119
And this is my turn to flaunt,

185
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,311
and I can't flaunt
with a free piano.

186
00:09:42,312 --> 00:09:45,448
Don't stoop to her level.
You're better than that.

187
00:09:45,482 --> 00:09:47,016
No, I'm really not.

188
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,153
Susan, I'm not kidding.

189
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:50,119
You're not telling Gaby
we paid for this piano.

190
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,909
Oh, Mike, please.
This is my chance.

191
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,469
My aunt had a stroke while driving!

192
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:57,014
When am I ever gonna
get that lucky again?

193
00:09:59,326 --> 00:10:00,396
You're not gonna believe this.

194
00:10:00,397 --> 00:10:01,963
They're out of cilantro.

195
00:10:01,997 --> 00:10:04,297
How can a market be out
of cilantro? I don't know,

196
00:10:04,298 --> 00:10:07,016
but I told that clerk she
should hang her head in shame.

197
00:10:07,017 --> 00:10:09,992
As well you should.
So what else do we need?

198
00:10:09,993 --> 00:10:11,476
Let's head over to
the kosher aisle.

199
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:13,812
I need a few items for the
Schwartzman Bar Mitzvah.

200
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,855
We need baking soda. I'll get it.

201
00:10:26,022 --> 00:10:27,956
Oh. Sam?

202
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,790
Please. Not now. What the
hell are you even doing here?

203
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:36,291
I lost my job.
I had to work someplace.

204
00:10:40,638 --> 00:10:43,465
You already, uh,
got the baking soda.

205
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,169
Boy, I would lose my head
if it wasn't screwed on.

206
00:10:47,203 --> 00:10:49,238
Who's that woman?

207
00:10:49,272 --> 00:10:51,807
Nobody. Someone I used to know.

208
00:10:51,841 --> 00:10:53,742
Oh. Is everything all right?

209
00:10:53,777 --> 00:10:58,072
I was... telling her that
it doesn't make sense

210
00:10:58,073 --> 00:11:00,516
for a store this big to
run out of a major herb.

211
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:02,663
I think we should check
out Hudson's market.

212
00:11:02,664 --> 00:11:03,901
That's downtown.

213
00:11:03,902 --> 00:11:06,722
We need cilantro,
don't we? Come on.

214
00:11:17,801 --> 00:11:19,568
Hey.

215
00:11:19,602 --> 00:11:22,671
Hey. Oh, you brought me flowers.

216
00:11:22,705 --> 00:11:24,999
Well, I wanted to get
you a t-shirt that said,

217
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,440
"I'm a moron who wears dark
clothes when I run at night,"

218
00:11:27,441 --> 00:11:30,304
but the gift shop was out.

219
00:11:30,305 --> 00:11:34,082
So who did this to you?
Did you see 'em?

220
00:11:34,117 --> 00:11:35,384
No.

221
00:11:35,418 --> 00:11:39,121
Damn. What kind of person hits
you and then just drives away?

222
00:11:39,155 --> 00:11:43,058
Maybe the kind of person
who wanted to hit me.

223
00:11:44,727 --> 00:11:46,992
Wait. You said you didn't see them.

224
00:11:46,993 --> 00:11:49,136
I didn't, but, Ange,
I'm telling you,

225
00:11:49,137 --> 00:11:51,667
this guy--he drives past me,

226
00:11:51,734 --> 00:11:54,903
he turns around and
swerves right into me.

227
00:11:57,407 --> 00:11:59,775
Oh, my God. Where's Danny?

228
00:11:59,809 --> 00:12:01,666
He fell asleep in the waiting room.

229
00:12:01,667 --> 00:12:03,252
We've been here all night.
Uh, you want me to get him?

230
00:12:03,253 --> 00:12:05,681
No, no. Listen.
I need you guys to go home,

231
00:12:05,715 --> 00:12:07,115
grab the I.D.S, some money,

232
00:12:07,116 --> 00:12:08,713
whatever you can stuff
in a couple of bags.

233
00:12:08,714 --> 00:12:12,249
But you're not exactly
travel-ready, Nick.

234
00:12:14,002 --> 00:12:15,554
Oh, absolutely not.

235
00:12:15,555 --> 00:12:18,698
The place we talked about,
near Carbondale.

236
00:12:18,699 --> 00:12:21,316
Just for a few weeks.

237
00:12:21,317 --> 00:12:24,270
No. Not without you.

238
00:12:24,271 --> 00:12:25,621
No, I'll send Danny.

239
00:12:25,622 --> 00:12:27,879
But you and me-
this is as far as we run.

240
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,527
What if it is Patrick?
What are we gonna do?

241
00:12:33,863 --> 00:12:36,632
We've been asking that
question for 20 years.

242
00:12:38,702 --> 00:12:41,103
I guess now we're gonna find out.

243
00:12:50,988 --> 00:12:52,956
Can I talk to you a minute?

244
00:12:54,558 --> 00:12:55,925
Sure.

245
00:12:57,428 --> 00:12:59,596
It's about what
happened with Porter.

246
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,731
Are you mad? You're mad.

247
00:13:01,765 --> 00:13:03,433
No, I'm not.

248
00:13:03,467 --> 00:13:04,989
You want me to leave.

249
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:08,282
No. No, I just want to talk.

250
00:13:08,283 --> 00:13:11,645
You looked like you
really wanted to hurt him,

251
00:13:11,646 --> 00:13:14,441
and I kind of need to
know what that's about.

252
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:19,026
Your family doesn't seem to
care how much you help them.

253
00:13:19,506 --> 00:13:22,629
You're a great mom,
and they just push you around.

254
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,966
It--it made me angry.

255
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,768
Yes, I saw that.

256
00:13:26,802 --> 00:13:30,438
And sometimes my family
can be unappreciative.

257
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,979
But what happened today
can never happen again.

258
00:13:38,013 --> 00:13:39,947
I know.

259
00:13:40,772 --> 00:13:43,818
Listen, I grew up with
an alcoholic mother.

260
00:13:46,288 --> 00:13:50,057
I know what it like to
be angry all the time.

261
00:13:50,092 --> 00:13:54,996
But when I was your age,
I had to find a way...

262
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,534
To control myself.

263
00:14:00,969 --> 00:14:02,904
How did you do that?

264
00:14:05,374 --> 00:14:06,808
A lot of help.

265
00:14:06,842 --> 00:14:09,243
One thing--I had a great
counselor at school,

266
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:10,978
and she taught me

267
00:14:11,013 --> 00:14:14,081
that whenever I was
about to lose it,

268
00:14:14,116 --> 00:14:15,983
that I should do this...

269
00:14:18,008 --> 00:14:19,287
One.

270
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,522
Two.

271
00:14:22,185 --> 00:14:23,224
Three.

272
00:14:23,258 --> 00:14:25,359
That really works?

273
00:14:25,394 --> 00:14:27,461
It really does.

274
00:14:29,598 --> 00:14:31,499
It gives you a chance

275
00:14:31,533 --> 00:14:33,601
to step back,

276
00:14:33,635 --> 00:14:36,103
feel like you're in control.

277
00:14:36,138 --> 00:14:38,673
You should try it next time.
You'll see.

278
00:14:40,231 --> 00:14:41,209
Okay.

279
00:14:44,379 --> 00:14:46,247
Mm.

280
00:14:48,784 --> 00:14:51,519
I'm really sorry about what I did.

281
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:54,037
It's fine.

282
00:14:54,038 --> 00:14:56,339
Just don't ever do it again.

283
00:15:01,135 --> 00:15:03,299
But thank you for wanting to.

284
00:15:12,623 --> 00:15:15,626
Oh, come on, Larry.You're my business
manager too.

285
00:15:15,627 --> 00:15:17,683
I am not leaving this
office until you tell me

286
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:20,496
what Carlos is doing
with my ski house money.

287
00:15:20,531 --> 00:15:22,878
Gaby, you're putting me in
an uncomfortable position.

288
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,457
You should talk to Carlos.

289
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:25,888
I did!

290
00:15:25,889 --> 00:15:28,320
I offered to put myself in a
very uncomfortable position,

291
00:15:28,321 --> 00:15:29,545
and he still said no.

292
00:15:29,546 --> 00:15:31,943
I'm sorry, but Carlos
swore me to secrecy.

293
00:15:31,944 --> 00:15:34,784
Please respect that.

294
00:15:34,978 --> 00:15:37,093
You're right. I'm sorry.

295
00:15:37,094 --> 00:15:38,247
No hard feelings.

296
00:15:38,282 --> 00:15:39,682
Of course not.

297
00:15:39,716 --> 00:15:41,306
Hey. What are you doing?

298
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:43,760
Hmm. I don't want to be a liar.

299
00:15:43,761 --> 00:15:46,843
When I go home, and I'm in
tears and Carlos asks me why,

300
00:15:46,844 --> 00:15:48,961
and I say you grabbed my ass,

301
00:15:48,962 --> 00:15:51,394
I want to be telling the truth.

302
00:15:51,859 --> 00:15:54,397
Well played.

303
00:15:54,431 --> 00:15:57,467
Carlos gave $50,
000 to one of your neighbors.

304
00:15:57,501 --> 00:15:59,936
What?! Who?!

305
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:03,072
A Mike Delfino. Apparently,
his business is in big trouble.

306
00:16:03,107 --> 00:16:06,008
Oh, my God. Mike's wife is one
of my closest friends,

307
00:16:06,043 --> 00:16:08,242
and she never said a word.

308
00:16:08,243 --> 00:16:09,498
Poor thing.

309
00:16:09,499 --> 00:16:12,181
Please don't tell
Carlos I told you.

310
00:16:12,216 --> 00:16:14,283
Of course.

311
00:16:14,318 --> 00:16:16,329
I should get going.

312
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:17,788
Do you have parking validation?

313
00:16:17,789 --> 00:16:20,978
Oh, those are only for employees.

314
00:16:21,525 --> 00:16:23,659
Okay, you could take mine.

315
00:16:25,696 --> 00:16:28,830
Hotel, food, incidentals--

316
00:16:29,212 --> 00:16:30,388
$300.

317
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:32,426
You can order pay per view.

318
00:16:32,427 --> 00:16:33,585
I don't even care if you buy beer.

319
00:16:33,586 --> 00:16:36,007
Just stay in your room
as much as you can, okay?

320
00:16:36,008 --> 00:16:38,577
This is stupid. It's been 20 years.

321
00:16:38,611 --> 00:16:42,480
Have you actually seen or heard
from this Patrick Logan guy?

322
00:16:42,515 --> 00:16:44,781
Do you know for a fact
that he's even still alive?

323
00:16:44,782 --> 00:16:46,555
Danny, I'm not gonna
debate this with you.

324
00:16:46,556 --> 00:16:48,033
If he started this
group you guys were in,

325
00:16:48,034 --> 00:16:49,205
then isn't he on the run, too?

326
00:16:49,206 --> 00:16:52,015
He's got bigger problems
than getting revenge.

327
00:16:52,016 --> 00:16:53,370
Just humor me, okay?

328
00:16:53,371 --> 00:16:55,772
Because if I'm wrong,
all I am is wrong.

329
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,741
But if I'm not...

330
00:17:00,693 --> 00:17:03,480
Please. Just humor me.

331
00:17:10,621 --> 00:17:12,520
Check stand one is now open.

332
00:17:12,521 --> 00:17:13,630
Hello.

333
00:17:13,631 --> 00:17:16,024
Check stand one is now open,
taking all customers...

334
00:17:16,025 --> 00:17:17,493
Hello.

335
00:17:17,528 --> 00:17:19,562
Um, I saw you the other day,

336
00:17:19,597 --> 00:17:22,432
talking to my friend Sam.

337
00:17:22,466 --> 00:17:24,968
Oh, I'm--I'm Bree, by the way.

338
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,936
I know who you are.

339
00:17:29,807 --> 00:17:32,041
Well, this is none of my business,

340
00:17:32,076 --> 00:17:37,714
but I noticed that there was
some tension between you two.

341
00:17:37,748 --> 00:17:39,649
You could say that.

342
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:43,720
Oh. Well, I hope
everything is okay.

343
00:17:44,822 --> 00:17:46,856
What is it you want?

344
00:17:49,093 --> 00:17:50,233
Well, I don't know.

345
00:17:50,234 --> 00:17:54,964
There was just something so
odd about that... encounter.

346
00:17:54,999 --> 00:17:58,668
I don't understand why he would
talk to a friend like that.

347
00:18:02,139 --> 00:18:05,074
Maybe that's because
I'm not his friend.

348
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,444
I'm his mother.

349
00:18:17,186 --> 00:18:20,654
My manager said I could
take a break early.

350
00:18:20,655 --> 00:18:22,623
You've got five minutes.

351
00:18:23,418 --> 00:18:27,293
Are you aware that Sam goes around
telling people that you're--

352
00:18:27,294 --> 00:18:28,810
dead.

353
00:18:30,165 --> 00:18:31,432
Yes, I heard.

354
00:18:31,433 --> 00:18:33,514
Why would he do that?

355
00:18:36,038 --> 00:18:38,206
He's a complicated boy.

356
00:18:43,045 --> 00:18:46,347
Did Sam tell you
who his father was?

357
00:18:46,381 --> 00:18:49,951
He told me about your
relationship with my... husband,

358
00:18:49,985 --> 00:18:53,087
if that's what you're referring to.

359
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:57,258
Did he also mention the
letter that Rex sent to me?

360
00:18:57,292 --> 00:18:59,127
What letter?

361
00:18:59,161 --> 00:19:01,062
It was after you were married.

362
00:19:01,096 --> 00:19:02,997
Rex had just started his practice,

363
00:19:03,031 --> 00:19:06,667
and apparently,
the money was pouring in.

364
00:19:08,203 --> 00:19:09,835
Rex wrote

365
00:19:09,836 --> 00:19:14,441
and told me he could
give Sam a better life.

366
00:19:14,442 --> 00:19:17,252
He then asked for
full-time custody.

367
00:19:20,505 --> 00:19:23,127
I'm guessing he
never told you that.

368
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:26,520
Must have slipped his mind.

369
00:19:26,521 --> 00:19:30,137
I politely declined his offer.

370
00:19:30,138 --> 00:19:33,729
And did Sam... know about this?

371
00:19:34,347 --> 00:19:35,397
Not until a few months ago,

372
00:19:35,398 --> 00:19:38,132
when he found the letter.

373
00:19:38,167 --> 00:19:41,969
And when he realized that he
could have lived all those years

374
00:19:42,004 --> 00:19:46,073
with his dad in a fancy house...

375
00:19:46,108 --> 00:19:50,011
He... was beyond livid.

376
00:19:50,045 --> 00:19:54,882
Even so, how could he go around
pretending that you're dead?

377
00:19:56,852 --> 00:19:59,487
Like I said...

378
00:19:59,521 --> 00:20:01,789
He's a complicated boy.

379
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:10,131
Gaby, hi.

380
00:20:10,165 --> 00:20:12,533
Hi, Susan.

381
00:20:12,568 --> 00:20:14,468
I just got back
from the supermarket

382
00:20:14,503 --> 00:20:16,778
and realized I bought way too much.

383
00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:18,283
I'm afraid some of
it's gonna go bad,

384
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:19,985
and so I thought,
who could I give this to?

385
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:23,268
And I randomly thought of you.

386
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:27,355
You're afraid that canned peaches

387
00:20:27,356 --> 00:20:29,659
and condensed milk
are going to go bad?

388
00:20:29,818 --> 00:20:33,257
Well, it's just,
my cupboards are cluttered,

389
00:20:33,258 --> 00:20:36,190
and you'd be doing me a huge favor.

390
00:20:36,225 --> 00:20:37,658
Okay.

391
00:20:37,693 --> 00:20:38,659
Thanks.

392
00:20:38,694 --> 00:20:40,494
Oh. Hey.

393
00:20:40,529 --> 00:20:42,563
As long as you're here,

394
00:20:42,598 --> 00:20:44,699
I want to show you something.

395
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:50,104
Wow.

396
00:20:50,138 --> 00:20:51,873
We just got it.

397
00:20:51,907 --> 00:20:54,542
M.J. Is gonna take lessons.

398
00:20:55,811 --> 00:20:58,246
You sure you don't
want to start him off

399
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,581
with, say, a used upright?

400
00:21:00,616 --> 00:21:02,083
No way.

401
00:21:02,117 --> 00:21:05,386
Me wan-NY, me like-y, me get-Ty.

402
00:21:07,189 --> 00:21:11,425
May I ask how much this cost-y?

403
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:15,596
Well, Mike doesn't like me
throwing around numbers,

404
00:21:15,631 --> 00:21:19,500
but let's just say
your jaw would drop...

405
00:21:19,534 --> 00:21:21,602
30,000 times.

406
00:21:22,434 --> 00:21:23,169
Wha--

407
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,439
that's one.

408
00:21:25,474 --> 00:21:27,708
This is none of my business,

409
00:21:27,743 --> 00:21:30,645
but is this really the best time

410
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:32,713
to buy something this expensive?

411
00:21:32,748 --> 00:21:36,017
I mean, didn't Mike just
have his truck repossessed?

412
00:21:36,863 --> 00:21:39,287
Things finally turned around.

413
00:21:39,321 --> 00:21:41,489
He got a big cash infusion.

414
00:21:41,523 --> 00:21:43,524
You don't say.

415
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:47,261
Anyway, I know you guys
don't have a piano,

416
00:21:47,296 --> 00:21:50,531
so if you ever want the
girls to take lessons...

417
00:21:52,401 --> 00:21:54,402
Well, thank you. I gotta go.

418
00:21:54,436 --> 00:21:55,903
Enjoy your peaches.

419
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,146
You owe me $50,000.

420
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,048
What? For your information,

421
00:22:07,082 --> 00:22:10,584
Mike's "big cash infusion"
cost me my ski house.

422
00:22:10,619 --> 00:22:12,552
What are you talking about?

423
00:22:12,553 --> 00:22:13,748
Oh, don't play dumb.

424
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:16,924
Carlos loaned Mike the 50 grand,
and you know it!

425
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,895
Why are you looking
like you don't know it?

426
00:22:22,056 --> 00:22:23,731
He told me...

427
00:22:23,765 --> 00:22:25,298
Business picked up.

428
00:22:25,299 --> 00:22:26,164
Well, he lied,

429
00:22:26,165 --> 00:22:28,862
just like Carlos lied to me
about where our money went,

430
00:22:28,863 --> 00:22:31,472
which you went and
spent on a piano.

431
00:22:31,506 --> 00:22:34,308
Oh, no--no, I didn't. Uh...

432
00:22:35,777 --> 00:22:37,912
I inherited it.

433
00:22:37,946 --> 00:22:40,014
I was trying to make you jealous.

434
00:22:40,874 --> 00:22:42,015
Oh, honey,

435
00:22:42,016 --> 00:22:45,653
given different circumstances,
that so would have worked.

436
00:22:47,923 --> 00:22:50,324
This is unbelievable.

437
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:52,927
I have the money
from the strip club

438
00:22:52,961 --> 00:22:54,462
sitting in the bank,

439
00:22:54,496 --> 00:22:57,765
and Mike would rather
borrow it from you guys?

440
00:23:00,202 --> 00:23:02,236
I'm about to screech at my husband.

441
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:04,171
You might want to stand back.

442
00:23:04,496 --> 00:23:06,107
No, no, no, no, no.

443
00:23:06,141 --> 00:23:08,516
I have a better idea.

444
00:23:10,316 --> 00:23:11,545
There you are.

445
00:23:11,546 --> 00:23:13,183
Hey.

446
00:23:13,415 --> 00:23:15,916
Hey, Mr. Scavo. How was the flight?

447
00:23:15,951 --> 00:23:18,085
Horrible. It was delayed,

448
00:23:18,086 --> 00:23:19,552
there was turbulence,

449
00:23:19,553 --> 00:23:21,589
they ran out of food,

450
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:25,717
and I'm not seeing a plate
covered with tinfoil here.

451
00:23:25,718 --> 00:23:28,715
There was one, but one of our 50
children must have inhaled it.

452
00:23:28,716 --> 00:23:30,431
Damn it!

453
00:23:30,465 --> 00:23:31,932
Okay, calm down.

454
00:23:31,933 --> 00:23:34,702
Lynette, no. I'm hungry.
You know, when you were working,

455
00:23:34,736 --> 00:23:36,400
I always had food waiting for you.

456
00:23:36,401 --> 00:23:37,307
Oh, that's right.

457
00:23:37,308 --> 00:23:39,541
You were very considerate
in your eighth month.

458
00:23:39,542 --> 00:23:40,674
I'm sorry. I keep forgetting,

459
00:23:40,709 --> 00:23:42,691
you're the only person who's
ever been pregnant before.

460
00:23:42,692 --> 00:23:46,113
Relax. Relax.
We'll just order a pizza.

461
00:23:46,148 --> 00:23:49,083
And wait an hour? Forget it.
I'll fend for myself.

462
00:23:49,084 --> 00:23:50,878
Six, seven,

463
00:23:50,879 --> 00:23:53,054
eight, nine...

464
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:55,856
Hey, it's okay. I'm fine.

465
00:23:55,891 --> 00:23:58,292
There's nothing in here.

466
00:23:58,326 --> 00:24:01,180
Come on. Lynette, you didn't go
to the store today? 16... 17...

467
00:24:01,181 --> 00:24:03,031
Sweetie, you might want
to take it down a notch.

468
00:24:03,032 --> 00:24:04,726
I have been in three
cities in two days.

469
00:24:04,727 --> 00:24:08,725
You'd think you'd find the time
to go to the market. 21, 22...

470
00:24:08,726 --> 00:24:10,309
What the hell is he doing?

471
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:12,044
Eddie, it's okay.

472
00:24:12,078 --> 00:24:14,279
23, 24, 25... tell him
to stick a sock in it.

473
00:24:14,314 --> 00:24:15,748
26, 27...

474
00:24:15,782 --> 00:24:18,691
Okay, you need to kiss me.
Here. Mmm!

475
00:24:18,692 --> 00:24:20,719
Okay, there. We're good.
We're good. He loves me.

476
00:24:20,754 --> 00:24:23,555
He loves me.

477
00:24:29,289 --> 00:24:31,063
We'll talk about it later.

478
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:38,358
So Eddie attacked our son?

479
00:24:38,392 --> 00:24:40,432
Okay, I'd use "attack,
" but with a small "a."

480
00:24:40,433 --> 00:24:44,264
Okay, that's it. I want him out,
and that's with a big "o."

481
00:24:44,298 --> 00:24:47,467
Look, Eddie is not some
exchange student from France.

482
00:24:47,502 --> 00:24:49,402
He comes from an abusive home.

483
00:24:49,437 --> 00:24:53,173
We have to accept he
has some... baggage.

484
00:24:53,207 --> 00:24:55,786
So I have to wonder
if he's gonna punch me

485
00:24:55,787 --> 00:24:58,543
any time I raise my voice to you?

486
00:24:58,544 --> 00:25:01,744
I am not sending him back to
live with that woman, Tom.

487
00:25:03,551 --> 00:25:05,919
How about therapy? That might help.

488
00:25:05,953 --> 00:25:07,888
Now we're gonna pay
for his therapy?

489
00:25:07,922 --> 00:25:10,597
Okay, here's a thought.
How about we all stop yelling at me?

490
00:25:10,598 --> 00:25:13,634
What a concept-
be nice to Lynette.

491
00:25:14,188 --> 00:25:15,316
Fine.

492
00:25:15,317 --> 00:25:17,398
We'll try the therapy.

493
00:25:18,166 --> 00:25:20,133
All these weeks,
Sam has been going on

494
00:25:20,134 --> 00:25:22,369
about how his mother was dead,
and the whole time,

495
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:26,806
she has been at Howe's market,
in a smock, stacking cans.

496
00:25:26,998 --> 00:25:30,510
I guess my instincts about Sam
were right, wouldn't you say?

497
00:25:30,545 --> 00:25:32,646
What did I say about gloating?

498
00:25:32,896 --> 00:25:34,915
Something. I wasn't listening.

499
00:25:34,949 --> 00:25:37,749
I was thinking about
how right I was.

500
00:25:38,796 --> 00:25:40,819
Okay, I'll stop.
I know you're upset.

501
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,351
You have no idea.

502
00:25:42,352 --> 00:25:43,487
When Sam first showed up,

503
00:25:43,488 --> 00:25:46,343
I felt like I got a
little piece of Rex back.

504
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:48,844
It was wonderful.

505
00:25:48,845 --> 00:25:50,320
But this has forced me to remember

506
00:25:50,321 --> 00:25:53,233
that Rex was a liar, too.

507
00:26:01,442 --> 00:26:04,010
Sorry. Am I interrupting something?

508
00:26:06,647 --> 00:26:08,548
Orson, would you please excuse us?

509
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:10,150
Of course.

510
00:26:14,555 --> 00:26:16,289
Everything all right?

511
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:17,791
Actually, Sam--

512
00:26:17,825 --> 00:26:20,126
wait, wait. Still here.

513
00:26:22,997 --> 00:26:25,632
I went back to the
supermarket today.

514
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,674
I take it you met my mother.

515
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,096
Why did you say she was dead?

516
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:40,945
She is dead... to me.

517
00:26:40,946 --> 00:26:43,946
So you admit that you lied?

518
00:26:45,086 --> 00:26:48,686
Did she tell you I found
a letter my father wrote,

519
00:26:48,687 --> 00:26:50,799
begging her to let me
come live with him?

520
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,959
That's hardly an excuse.

521
00:26:52,994 --> 00:26:54,427
I was 4.

522
00:26:54,462 --> 00:26:57,030
He said he could give me all
the advantages she couldn't,

523
00:26:57,064 --> 00:26:59,031
but she wouldn't let him.

524
00:26:59,032 --> 00:27:01,306
She loved you.
She wanted you by her side--

525
00:27:01,307 --> 00:27:02,949
she should have wanted more for me!

526
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:05,290
Andrew got bicycles for Christmas

527
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:06,432
and TVs for his birthday.

528
00:27:06,433 --> 00:27:09,261
I had to sit in a trailer and
do my homework with mittens on

529
00:27:09,262 --> 00:27:12,035
because my mom couldn't afford
to pay the heating bill.

530
00:27:12,036 --> 00:27:13,503
If she had loved me,
she would have let me

531
00:27:13,504 --> 00:27:16,890
live the life that
I was entitled to!

532
00:27:25,326 --> 00:27:26,593
I'm...

533
00:27:26,627 --> 00:27:28,828
Going to...

534
00:27:28,863 --> 00:27:32,531
Talk to the... Schwartzmans
about their Bar Mitzvah.

535
00:27:32,532 --> 00:27:36,924
If you want to go over the
menu later, let me know.

536
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:45,378
Oh.

537
00:27:45,379 --> 00:27:46,880
Hey!

538
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:48,815
How'd it go?

539
00:27:48,849 --> 00:27:50,730
Kind of weird,
but it was okay. Yeah?

540
00:27:50,731 --> 00:27:52,629
I think you did very
good work today, Eddie.

541
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,006
Now the restroom is down the hall,

542
00:27:54,007 --> 00:27:57,187
second door on the right.
I'll be here.

543
00:27:58,954 --> 00:28:02,054
So you said "good work.
" Does that mean it went well?

544
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:06,080
That means Eddie's got some issues,

545
00:28:06,081 --> 00:28:08,728
and it's going to take
time to work through them.

546
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,895
Okay... how much more time

547
00:28:10,896 --> 00:28:12,598
at $130 an hour?

548
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:14,250
Well, it would go a lot faster

549
00:28:14,251 --> 00:28:15,702
if we could get his mother in here,

550
00:28:15,703 --> 00:28:19,427
but he seems to think there's
no way she'd agree to that.

551
00:28:19,428 --> 00:28:23,776
Really? If you think it'll help,
I can get her in here.

552
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:26,137
That would be great.

553
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:28,214
Okay, and then...

554
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:31,050
And then everything
will be okay, right?

555
00:28:32,231 --> 00:28:34,420
Let's just get the mother in here.

556
00:28:48,735 --> 00:28:50,235
Barbara?

557
00:28:50,236 --> 00:28:52,838
It's Lynette Scavo.

558
00:29:00,013 --> 00:29:02,982
Barbara, we need to
talk about Eddie.

559
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,927
Hey.

560
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:17,463
Are you looking for
Barbara Orlofsky?

561
00:29:17,497 --> 00:29:19,249
Yeah. Do you know where she is?

562
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:21,190
No. Nobody's seen her for days,

563
00:29:21,191 --> 00:29:23,035
and her car's still there.

564
00:29:23,069 --> 00:29:24,503
It's weird.

565
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:34,647
Hey.

566
00:29:35,949 --> 00:29:37,918
There's this crazy
rumor going around

567
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,085
that you've got something for me.

568
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:43,022
Just an apology.

569
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:46,625
Well, as long as it comes
with one of your muffins,

570
00:29:46,626 --> 00:29:48,525
I may just accept it.

571
00:29:48,526 --> 00:29:50,368
Oh, Andrew.

572
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,734
Orson told me about Sam.

573
00:29:55,769 --> 00:29:57,268
You were right from the start.

574
00:29:57,269 --> 00:29:59,338
I never should have trusted him.

575
00:29:59,372 --> 00:30:00,873
Wow.

576
00:30:00,907 --> 00:30:04,410
I-I don't even need the muffin now.

577
00:30:04,531 --> 00:30:08,434
Now that that's settled,
what are we gonna do about Sam?

578
00:30:08,468 --> 00:30:10,503
That's easy. We get rid of him.

579
00:30:10,537 --> 00:30:13,205
I don't think it's
gonna be that simple.

580
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,107
Why not?

581
00:30:15,142 --> 00:30:19,011
I saw a side to him last night
that I've never seen before,

582
00:30:19,046 --> 00:30:23,983
and to be perfectly honest...

583
00:30:24,017 --> 00:30:27,186
(Whispers) I'm afraid of him.

584
00:30:29,581 --> 00:30:32,249
Hi, Susan! Thanks for
having us over for dinner.

585
00:30:32,284 --> 00:30:34,389
Oh, well, actually,
dinner was just an excuse.

586
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:35,952
I wanted to show you something.

587
00:30:35,953 --> 00:30:39,290
(Gasps) Oh, my God!
You bought a piano?

588
00:30:39,324 --> 00:30:42,693
<i>Yes! And I wanted you to be
the first to see it.</i>

589
00:30:42,728 --> 00:30:48,211
Wow. That looks... pricey. $30,000,

590
00:30:48,684 --> 00:30:52,434
plus delivery and tax and
a biannual tuning fee.

591
00:30:52,435 --> 00:30:54,288
But Mike's on his way down.

592
00:30:54,289 --> 00:30:57,762
Do me a favor. Don't let on that
you know how much it cost. Why not?

593
00:30:57,763 --> 00:31:00,509
He thinks it's ostentatious,
and he's a little embarrassed.

594
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:02,954
In fact, he keeps telling everyone

595
00:31:02,955 --> 00:31:06,275
that I inherited it from my aunt,
so just go with it.

596
00:31:06,276 --> 00:31:07,644
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late

597
00:31:07,645 --> 00:31:09,742
that's okay, honey.
I'm gonna check on dinner.

598
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:11,395
We're gonna check on dinner.

599
00:31:12,955 --> 00:31:16,153
Dude, we need to talk. A piano?

600
00:31:16,154 --> 00:31:18,665
Oh, God, don't worry about it.
We didn't buy it.

601
00:31:18,666 --> 00:31:20,811
Susan inherited it
from her dead aunt.

602
00:31:21,643 --> 00:31:25,211
Wow. Without even blinking.

603
00:31:25,212 --> 00:31:28,728
Uh, would anyone mind
helping me set the table?

604
00:31:28,729 --> 00:31:29,663
Oh, Carlos will do it.

605
00:31:29,664 --> 00:31:32,364
Oh, great. And, Mike,
maybe you and Gaby can get the wine.

606
00:31:35,709 --> 00:31:38,211
So you and Carlos have any
big plans for the summer?

607
00:31:38,212 --> 00:31:39,983
You taking any trips?

608
00:31:43,274 --> 00:31:45,118
Gaby?

609
00:31:47,335 --> 00:31:49,084
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

610
00:31:49,994 --> 00:31:52,500
Look, if, um, you need to talk...

611
00:31:52,501 --> 00:31:54,498
Susan's in the other room.
(Chuckles)

612
00:31:55,396 --> 00:31:58,049
I think Carlos is having an affair.

613
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:00,481
What? Why would you think that?

614
00:32:00,482 --> 00:32:02,819
Because he's been acting
really secretive lately.

615
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,664
And I went to talk to
our business manager,

616
00:32:04,665 --> 00:32:07,768
and I discovered $50,
000 was missing from our account.

617
00:32:07,769 --> 00:32:11,079
Well, I'm sure there's
a good explanation.

618
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,691
(Cork pops) Yeah, there is.

619
00:32:12,692 --> 00:32:15,898
It's called fancy dresses and
hotel rooms for some bimbo.

620
00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:19,054
No, no, no. I am sure that
you've got that all wrong.

621
00:32:20,048 --> 00:32:22,495
Wait a minute.
Are you covering for him?

622
00:32:22,496 --> 00:32:24,075
No. I...

623
00:32:24,076 --> 00:32:26,584
Because I stole his cell phone
to see who he was talking to,

624
00:32:26,585 --> 00:32:28,909
and he called your house,
like, a hundred times.

625
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:30,441
<i>Well, he hasn't been
talking to me.</i>

626
00:32:30,442 --> 00:32:33,531
Really? Well, the next time
he's not talking to you,

627
00:32:33,532 --> 00:32:36,390
you might want to give him the
name of your divorce lawyer.

628
00:32:36,391 --> 00:32:40,853
I'm so glad you guys
were free tonight.

629
00:32:40,854 --> 00:32:43,436
We've been wanting to do this
for such a long--oh, my God!

630
00:32:43,437 --> 00:32:47,124
What's wrong? My earring.
It's missing. Damn it!

631
00:32:47,125 --> 00:32:50,121
I just got them today.
Oh, I'm sure it's somewhere.

632
00:32:50,122 --> 00:32:52,244
Oh! Here it is. (Chuckles)

633
00:32:52,792 --> 00:32:56,320
That would have been 3
grand out the window.

634
00:32:56,321 --> 00:32:58,408
You bought $3,000 earrings?

635
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:00,131
Oh, of course not.

636
00:33:00,132 --> 00:33:03,924
Mike did. He's so generous,

637
00:33:03,925 --> 00:33:05,926
especially now that
we're loaded again.

638
00:33:06,971 --> 00:33:10,108
You know, Carlos,
I never noticed before--

639
00:33:10,109 --> 00:33:14,043
you have a really veiny forehead.

640
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:20,730
Hey, buddy, we got a bit
of a problem. No kidding.

641
00:33:20,731 --> 00:33:23,415
Wait, you know?
Did Gaby say something?

642
00:33:23,416 --> 00:33:26,532
No. I heard it all from Susan.
Huh. Well, it's not surprising,

643
00:33:26,533 --> 00:33:28,957
the way those two talk,
but luckily, it's not true.

644
00:33:28,958 --> 00:33:30,586
Come on, Mike. Let's stop the lies.

645
00:33:30,587 --> 00:33:33,259
It is true, and we
both know it. It is?

646
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,932
Don't act surprised.
God, this whole thing was a mistake.

647
00:33:35,933 --> 00:33:37,165
I never should have
written that check.

648
00:33:37,166 --> 00:33:40,482
You paid for it? Oh, man.

649
00:33:40,483 --> 00:33:42,819
Wh-- (Susan) Dinner is ready.

650
00:33:43,692 --> 00:33:45,698
Mmm! Susan,
everything smells so good.

651
00:33:45,699 --> 00:33:47,028
Thanks.

652
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:50,197
You want some meatballs, Carlos?

653
00:33:50,198 --> 00:33:53,172
I've got two nice,
big ones for you right here.

654
00:33:53,173 --> 00:33:55,570
Nope. I'm fine.

655
00:33:57,042 --> 00:33:58,455
I saw that.

656
00:33:58,456 --> 00:33:59,976
Saw what?

657
00:33:59,977 --> 00:34:02,575
You leering at Susan's breasts.

658
00:34:02,576 --> 00:34:04,939
(Chuckles) I was
looking at the pasta.

659
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:07,461
Susan's breasts just happened
to be hovering nearby.

660
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,167
Gaby, leave Carlos alone.

661
00:34:09,168 --> 00:34:12,119
Oh, my God. It's you.

662
00:34:13,556 --> 00:34:14,610
Excuse me?

663
00:34:14,611 --> 00:34:16,533
You're the one Carlos is
having an affair with.

664
00:34:16,534 --> 00:34:17,850
What? What?

665
00:34:17,851 --> 00:34:21,113
Makes perfect sense. That's why
there were all those phone calls

666
00:34:21,114 --> 00:34:23,762
to this house from his cell phone.
You looked at my cell phone?

667
00:34:23,763 --> 00:34:26,723
Yes, and thank God I did. Whore!

668
00:34:26,724 --> 00:34:30,764
Shamelessly shoving your
meatballs in my husband's face.

669
00:34:30,765 --> 00:34:33,872
There was no shoving.
Sometimes they spontaneously heave.

670
00:34:33,873 --> 00:34:37,547
Have you lost your mind?
I am not having an affair with Susan.

671
00:34:37,548 --> 00:34:39,171
Mike, you believe me, right?

672
00:34:39,172 --> 00:34:41,300
Yeah... I guess.

673
00:34:41,301 --> 00:34:44,596
<i>It's just... why are you calling
over here all the time?</i>

674
00:34:44,597 --> 00:34:47,364
I'm not! I always call your cell!

675
00:34:47,365 --> 00:34:49,453
Susan, say something.

676
00:34:51,377 --> 00:34:53,784
Forget it, Carlos.
We might as well confess.

677
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,690
Confess what?!

678
00:34:57,691 --> 00:35:00,342
You wouldn't take my money
when you were in trouble,

679
00:35:00,343 --> 00:35:03,101
and, well, I've always known
that Carlos had a thing for me,

680
00:35:03,102 --> 00:35:04,797
so I told him that I
would sleep with him

681
00:35:04,798 --> 00:35:06,529
if he would loan you money.
(Gasps loudly)

682
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:10,070
You son of a bitch!

683
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,959
I didn't touch her.

684
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,996
All I did was help a
friend who screwed me over

685
00:35:14,997 --> 00:35:17,033
buying diamond earrings
and grand pianos.

686
00:35:17,034 --> 00:35:19,381
I told you, the piano was
a gift from Susan's aunt!

687
00:35:19,382 --> 00:35:20,647
You bought diamond earrings?

688
00:35:20,648 --> 00:35:25,279
Oh, yeah, with the $50,
000 that you borrowed from Carlos.

689
00:35:26,914 --> 00:35:29,282
You know? Yeah!

690
00:35:29,283 --> 00:35:31,300
So you two were just...

691
00:35:31,301 --> 00:35:33,766
Screwing with you, yes.

692
00:35:35,215 --> 00:35:36,933
So tell me, Mike,

693
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:39,274
do you feel betrayed, humiliated?

694
00:35:39,275 --> 00:35:43,974
Good. Because I only did this
to show you what it feels like

695
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,644
when the person that is
supposed to love you the most

696
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:48,242
lies to you.

697
00:35:51,099 --> 00:35:53,835
Well, I just did it 'cause
I want a ski chalet.

698
00:35:58,372 --> 00:36:00,726
I just keep trying to
think what I can say

699
00:36:00,727 --> 00:36:02,611
so you'll know how sorry I am.

700
00:36:05,286 --> 00:36:06,831
Well, I do know,

701
00:36:07,795 --> 00:36:10,512
and I'm not looking
for another apology.

702
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,933
<i>What I am looking for is your word</i>

703
00:36:15,934 --> 00:36:18,718
that you will never freeze
me out like this again.

704
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,400
(Scoffs) I swear.

705
00:36:23,838 --> 00:36:25,735
Good.

706
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:31,700
So is this everything?

707
00:36:31,701 --> 00:36:33,150
Yep.

708
00:36:33,151 --> 00:36:36,126
You sure you don't want
me to walk you through it?

709
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:38,215
No. I...

710
00:36:38,216 --> 00:36:40,775
Just want to get a sense
of where we stand.

711
00:36:40,776 --> 00:36:43,778
If I have any questions,
I'll ask you later.

712
00:37:09,762 --> 00:37:12,131
Why are they putting you
in a coma on purpose?

713
00:37:12,132 --> 00:37:13,927
Your--your brain seems fine.

714
00:37:13,928 --> 00:37:16,649
It's not like you
think you're napol**n.

715
00:37:17,228 --> 00:37:19,457
You don't think you're
Napoléon, do you?

716
00:37:19,458 --> 00:37:22,416
There was some swelling
when they brought me in.

717
00:37:22,417 --> 00:37:25,593
Now it's--it's pushing
against my skull.

718
00:37:25,594 --> 00:37:27,733
They say this is gonna relieve it.

719
00:37:31,424 --> 00:37:33,191
So how long are you gonna be out?

720
00:37:33,192 --> 00:37:34,578
A couple of days.

721
00:37:34,579 --> 00:37:37,134
And you know where you're gonna be?

722
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:39,592
With Danny.

723
00:37:39,593 --> 00:37:43,133
Actually, I was thinking about
bringing him back. No way.

724
00:37:43,134 --> 00:37:45,536
It's been three days.
Nothing's happened.

725
00:37:45,537 --> 00:37:47,328
I'm starting to think
you were wrong.

726
00:37:47,329 --> 00:37:51,035
No, Ange, we're not
taking any chances.

727
00:37:52,667 --> 00:37:54,583
All right, you know what?

728
00:37:54,584 --> 00:37:57,236
If I gotta drive you out of
town myself, I'm gonna do it.

729
00:37:57,237 --> 00:37:58,381
No, no, no. Okay, okay, okay, okay.

730
00:37:58,382 --> 00:38:00,712
If it'll keep you
from killing yourself,

731
00:38:01,263 --> 00:38:03,457
I will go stay with Danny.

732
00:38:03,458 --> 00:38:05,632
Thank you.

733
00:38:10,605 --> 00:38:13,474
You're easy to get along with,
you know that?

734
00:38:35,128 --> 00:38:37,830
(Patrick) Hey, Angie.

735
00:38:41,635 --> 00:38:43,969
You don't seem surprised to see me.

736
00:38:46,673 --> 00:38:49,041
Don't bother running upstairs.

737
00:38:49,075 --> 00:38:51,010
I already found your gun.

738
00:38:55,882 --> 00:38:57,316
Come on.

739
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:59,428
After all this time,

740
00:38:59,429 --> 00:39:01,970
there's gotta be something
you want to say to me.

741
00:39:01,971 --> 00:39:04,075
Go to hell.

742
00:39:05,834 --> 00:39:07,977
Couldn't you come up

743
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:09,732
with something more
original than that?

744
00:39:12,718 --> 00:39:16,279
I guess all this suburban living
forces you to think in clichés.

745
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,523
<i>So it was you.</i>

746
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:20,920
You ran over Nick.

747
00:39:20,921 --> 00:39:23,448
Would you believe me

748
00:39:23,449 --> 00:39:26,593
if I told you it was an accident?

749
00:39:26,594 --> 00:39:29,351
I sent Danny away.
You will never find him.

750
00:39:29,352 --> 00:39:31,813
That's okay. We're not that close,

751
00:39:31,814 --> 00:39:34,032
seeing as how you
stole him from me.

752
00:39:38,179 --> 00:39:40,012
Are you gonna kill me?

753
00:39:40,998 --> 00:39:43,368
No.

754
00:39:45,103 --> 00:39:46,850
I need you alive.

755
00:39:48,912 --> 00:39:51,468
You are gonna do me a favor.

756
00:39:53,081 --> 00:39:54,844
What kind of favor?

757
00:39:55,417 --> 00:39:57,298
(Sighs) Can we discuss
it in the morning?

758
00:39:57,299 --> 00:39:59,784
I've had an exhausting
couple of days,

759
00:39:59,785 --> 00:40:01,960
what with searching
your house for firearms

760
00:40:01,961 --> 00:40:03,612
and running down Dudley douche bag.

761
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,710
So...

762
00:40:09,711 --> 00:40:12,168
Which way to the guest room?

763
00:40:12,169 --> 00:40:13,575
You think I'm gonna
let you stay here?

764
00:40:13,576 --> 00:40:15,222
How are you gonna stop me?

765
00:40:15,223 --> 00:40:19,518
If you call the cops,
they'll arrest you and lover boy.

766
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:22,296
Aren't you afraid I'll
kill you in your sleep?

767
00:40:22,297 --> 00:40:23,824
Angie,

768
00:40:23,825 --> 00:40:26,776
if the last 20 years
have taught us anything,

769
00:40:26,777 --> 00:40:29,447
it's that you're not
comfortable killing people.

770
00:40:33,377 --> 00:40:36,520
And if you decide to run away,
just make sure

771
00:40:36,521 --> 00:40:38,649
you stop by the hospital
and say good-bye to Nick,

772
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:41,785
because he won't be around
much longer after you've gone.

773
00:40:41,786 --> 00:40:44,015
Patrick, please, don't hurt him.

774
00:40:44,016 --> 00:40:48,230
Just do what I tell you, baby,
and I'll let you both live.

775
00:40:48,231 --> 00:40:52,569
<i>Mysterious men--</i>

776
00:40:53,724 --> 00:40:58,369
<i>they make promises they have
no intention of keeping.</i>

777
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:04,911
<i>They tell lies to get
what they want.</i>

778
00:41:07,905 --> 00:41:11,981
<i>They may be more dangerous
than they seem.</i>

779
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:17,444
<i>Yes, our mothers told us</i>

780
00:41:17,445 --> 00:41:21,106
<i>we cannot trust the men
we don't know.</i>

781
00:41:22,701 --> 00:41:25,132
<i>And those we do know?</i>

782
00:41:26,255 --> 00:41:30,538
<i>Well, we can't always
trust them either.</i>
