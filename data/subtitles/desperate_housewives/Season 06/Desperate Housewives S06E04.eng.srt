1
00:00:02,676 --> 00:00:03,855
A proposal was made...

2
00:00:03,935 --> 00:00:05,137
Your niece came to my restaurant,

3
00:00:05,198 --> 00:00:06,491
asked me for a hostessing job.

4
00:00:06,587 --> 00:00:09,003
I'm sorry.
Another was broken.

5
00:00:09,071 --> 00:00:11,113
Oh, Katherine, you don't have to... 
Mike, please.

6
00:00:11,202 --> 00:00:12,617
A secret was kept...

7
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,897
Carlos is gonna find out
about this thing eventually.

8
00:00:14,968 --> 00:00:19,393
By then, I will have proved I
can do the job, pregnant or not.

9
00:00:19,462 --> 00:00:23,326
She's still unconscious.
I'd like to run some tests.
Another revealed...

10
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:24,536
Julie's pregnant.

11
00:00:31,703 --> 00:00:34,310
Bree Van De Kamp was having an affair.

12
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:36,432
And whenever her lover called...

13
00:00:39,925 --> 00:00:42,873
She needed an excuse to leave work early.

14
00:00:45,293 --> 00:00:46,470
I'm off to the jeweler's.

15
00:00:46,525 --> 00:00:48,183
Gotta get my pearls restrung.

16
00:00:49,946 --> 00:00:51,721
I'm off to the salon.

17
00:00:51,775 --> 00:00:53,527
Gotta keep this red hair red.

18
00:00:55,573 --> 00:00:57,413
I have to visit my aunt in the hospital.

19
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:58,619
She has shingles.

20
00:01:01,078 --> 00:01:02,775
But on this particular day,

21
00:01:02,889 --> 00:01:04,492
Bree was surprised to find

22
00:01:05,776 --> 00:01:08,314
her work had been done for her.

23
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:14,148
Morning!
Katherine, it's barely 9:00.

24
00:01:14,185 --> 00:01:15,314
How long have you been cooking?

25
00:01:15,407 --> 00:01:17,626
Oh, I don't know. Since 3:00? 4:00?

26
00:01:18,322 --> 00:01:20,558
You don't need to do
this whole luncheon by yourself.

27
00:01:20,611 --> 00:01:21,837
Well, I don't mind.

28
00:01:21,893 --> 00:01:24,352
When I'm happy, I have all this excess energy.

29
00:01:24,412 --> 00:01:26,052
Gotta channel it somewhere.

30
00:01:26,134 --> 00:01:27,853
Oh, you must be pretty darn happy.

31
00:01:27,908 --> 00:01:29,114
Any particular reason?

32
00:01:30,473 --> 00:01:31,497
Isn't it obvious?

33
00:01:32,697 --> 00:01:33,901
I'm in love.

34
00:01:33,964 --> 00:01:35,747
That's wonderful!

35
00:01:35,807 --> 00:01:38,356
Why didn't you tell me
you were seeing someone?

36
00:01:38,484 --> 00:01:39,947
You know what? It doesn't matter.

37
00:01:39,994 --> 00:01:41,977
The main thing is
you're finally over Mike.

38
00:01:43,276 --> 00:01:44,554
I'm not over Mike.

39
00:01:45,766 --> 00:01:47,160
You're not?

40
00:01:47,204 --> 00:01:49,726
No, silly. Who'd you think
I was in love with?

41
00:01:52,226 --> 00:01:53,816
But Mike just married Susan.

42
00:01:53,894 --> 00:01:57,948
Oh, honey. Their first marriage
went down in flames.

43
00:01:58,006 --> 00:01:59,475
This one's gonna crash even faster.

44
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,533
They're not even sleeping together.

45
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:04,136
What makes you say that?

46
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:05,303
Last night,

47
00:02:05,368 --> 00:02:08,539
the light in their upstairs
den was on at 3:00 a.m.

48
00:02:09,286 --> 00:02:11,117
That doesn't mean anything.

49
00:02:11,177 --> 00:02:13,471
Maybe Susan wanted to
read without waking him.

50
00:02:13,525 --> 00:02:17,314
No. Mike made a mistake and he knows it.

51
00:02:17,415 --> 00:02:19,039
He's just waiting for Julie to feel better,

52
00:02:19,147 --> 00:02:22,721
and then he'll dump Susan
and beg me to take him back.

53
00:02:24,783 --> 00:02:28,246
So... grab an apron. We
still have dessert to make.

54
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,013
I'm thinking tarte tatin.

55
00:02:32,108 --> 00:02:34,347
It's Mike's favorite.
We'll make an extra one for him.

56
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,069
Poor Bree.

57
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:40,234
She wanted to help her friend.

58
00:02:43,405 --> 00:02:45,001
But she didn't have time

59
00:02:45,057 --> 00:02:47,458
to deal with Katherine's imaginary lover...

60
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:52,133
I have a teeth cleaning,
so I won't be able to help you.

61
00:02:53,261 --> 00:02:56,385
Not when she had a real one.

62
00:03:07,971 --> 00:03:09,761
You wouldn't know it to look at him,

63
00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:12,199
but that nice man
who delivers your mail

64
00:03:12,861 --> 00:03:13,885
hits his wife.

65
00:03:16,021 --> 00:03:17,729
You'd never guess by her smile,

66
00:03:18,441 --> 00:03:20,339
but that nice woman
across the street

67
00:03:20,395 --> 00:03:22,738
embezzles from her boss.

68
00:03:24,306 --> 00:03:27,293
And that attractive couple
who jogs by every morning?

69
00:03:27,388 --> 00:03:30,413
Well, they like their cocaine.

70
00:03:33,102 --> 00:03:34,401
The sad truth is,

71
00:03:34,486 --> 00:03:36,502
we don't know our friends and neighbors

72
00:03:36,586 --> 00:03:39,568
nearly as well as we think we do.

73
00:03:40,492 --> 00:03:42,598
Even the people we love...

74
00:03:43,787 --> 00:03:45,085
keep secrets.

75
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:47,512
Need coffee.

76
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,024
Mmm.

77
00:03:50,111 --> 00:03:52,148
Well, this isn't helping you get your coffee.

78
00:03:52,262 --> 00:03:54,184
Whatever. It's wakin' me up.

79
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,550
Hey, bud. Hey, what are you still doin' home?

80
00:03:59,597 --> 00:04:00,693
I thought you had a morning class.

81
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:03,671
Actually, I'm thinking
about quitting school.

82
00:04:05,943 --> 00:04:06,706
What?

83
00:04:07,365 --> 00:04:09,150
Yeah. I thought I might get a job.

84
00:04:09,204 --> 00:04:13,328
Danny, our family's been in
this country five generations.

85
00:04:13,369 --> 00:04:15,030
It's time one of us got a diploma.

86
00:04:18,234 --> 00:04:19,974
Okay, what's going on?

87
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,075
Talk to me.

88
00:04:23,495 --> 00:04:27,627
No one talks to me at school,
no one sits near me,

89
00:04:27,665 --> 00:04:29,818
and everybody thinks I'm
the perv who attacked Julie.

90
00:04:33,632 --> 00:04:35,906
Look, this is a temporary thing.

91
00:04:36,995 --> 00:04:38,247
The police are gonna catch this guy,

92
00:04:38,306 --> 00:04:40,636
and everyone will know you are innocent.

93
00:04:41,668 --> 00:04:43,908
Yeah, but meanwhile,
I'm the campus freak.

94
00:04:44,719 --> 00:04:48,418
Baby, do me a favor.
Let's talk about this later.

95
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:49,601
If you go to school today,

96
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:52,180
we'll figure something out
when you get home, okay?

97
00:04:54,746 --> 00:04:55,572
Okay.

98
00:05:03,276 --> 00:05:04,556
Why you being so nice to him?

99
00:05:05,683 --> 00:05:07,700
There is no way we are
lettin' him drop out of school.

100
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:09,434
I know that,

101
00:05:10,137 --> 00:05:11,570
but we have to be careful here.

102
00:05:11,629 --> 00:05:12,777
You know Danny... 

103
00:05:12,828 --> 00:05:14,753
when he gets unhappy, he gets sloppy,

104
00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:17,588
says all sorts of things he shouldn't.

105
00:05:19,994 --> 00:05:20,888
Okay.

106
00:05:22,276 --> 00:05:23,432
So now all we've gotta do

107
00:05:23,473 --> 00:05:25,341
is figure out how to make a teenager happy.

108
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:30,288
Damn it!

109
00:05:30,328 --> 00:05:32,095
What's the matter?

110
00:05:32,246 --> 00:05:34,884
Oh. Nothing fits.

111
00:05:34,943 --> 00:05:37,508
My breasts have gotten huge.

112
00:05:37,626 --> 00:05:40,597
Oh, yeah. I hate it when that happens.

113
00:05:40,663 --> 00:05:42,172
Every time I'm pregnant... 

114
00:05:42,243 --> 00:05:45,484
second trimester like clockwork. Bam!

115
00:05:47,946 --> 00:05:48,932
Why are you smiling?

116
00:05:48,996 --> 00:05:50,259
Why do you think?

117
00:05:50,358 --> 00:05:51,935
"The Supremes" are back.

118
00:05:53,434 --> 00:05:56,572
What did I tell you about naming
them after musical groups?

119
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:57,736
I know.

120
00:05:57,835 --> 00:06:00,229
It's just that "benny and the jets"

121
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:02,501
are so happy to see 'em.

122
00:06:04,133 --> 00:06:05,268
This is serious.

123
00:06:05,348 --> 00:06:07,440
I have to hide these things at work

124
00:06:07,516 --> 00:06:09,547
so Carlos doesn't find out I'm pregnant.

125
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:11,786
What am I gonna do with you guys?

126
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:14,185
I got some ideas.
Hey, hey, I got a meeting.

127
00:06:14,251 --> 00:06:16,202
Wait, but... but... but... but they're
only like this for two weeks

128
00:06:16,257 --> 00:06:17,740
until they get all sore,

129
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:21,017
and you give me that "don't touch me" look.
Okay. Goodbye, Tom.

130
00:06:21,068 --> 00:06:23,986
Oh, come on. No, Lynette,
come on. Call in sick.

131
00:06:25,033 --> 00:06:26,646
Kids get snow days.

132
00:06:26,742 --> 00:06:29,135
We could call it a boob day.

133
00:06:31,069 --> 00:06:34,448
Okay, it is way too early
for the "don't touch me" look.

134
00:06:38,617 --> 00:06:40,634
So I waited around all morning, Carlos,

135
00:06:40,713 --> 00:06:42,994
for that repairman that you told
me to call, and he never showed.

136
00:06:44,052 --> 00:06:46,380
No, I'm not done. I'm sharing my day with you.

137
00:06:46,446 --> 00:06:48,926
Then your children took my $300 perfume

138
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,279
and gave their dolls a bath.

139
00:06:52,133 --> 00:06:55,113
Yes, I spent $300 on perfume.
But you're missing the point!

140
00:06:57,005 --> 00:06:59,322
Oh, really? You don't like it when I yell?

141
00:06:59,966 --> 00:07:00,816
Well, how about this?

142
00:07:04,084 --> 00:07:05,831
I have taken care of your
demon spawn children

143
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,984
for 12 hours.
My shift is over.

144
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:21,197
So, you, uh, having fun
working at the restaurant?

145
00:07:21,253 --> 00:07:23,144
I'm having fun working with you.

146
00:07:23,945 --> 00:07:25,493
Oh! Look who's here.

147
00:07:26,491 --> 00:07:29,343
Hi, Gabrielle.
I was talking to her.

148
00:07:30,107 --> 00:07:32,032
So... I thought I was gonna pick you up.

149
00:07:32,114 --> 00:07:33,759
John offered to give me a ride.

150
00:07:34,504 --> 00:07:35,593
And I appreciated the company.

151
00:07:37,596 --> 00:07:38,860
Okay, time to go inside.

152
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,199
Someone's got homework.

153
00:07:40,444 --> 00:07:42,127
Bye.
Night.

154
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:45,848
You remember homework, John... 

155
00:07:46,105 --> 00:07:47,958
that thing that kids in
high school have to do?

156
00:07:48,222 --> 00:07:50,901
I remember it. I think you used
to help me with mine.

157
00:07:51,836 --> 00:07:55,247
What are you doing with her, John?
I take care of my employees.

158
00:07:55,324 --> 00:07:57,566
Really? Do you drive
the busboys home, too?

159
00:07:59,267 --> 00:08:00,909
I will pick her up from now on.

160
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:02,856
Come on.

161
00:08:05,299 --> 00:08:06,094
Hey there.

162
00:08:06,332 --> 00:08:08,019
How's she doing?
Much better.

163
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:11,236
The doctor says the swelling
in her brain has subsided

164
00:08:11,301 --> 00:08:13,967
and she could come to at any moment.
Well, that's terrific.

165
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:16,980
Mm. Julie, you should see the
flowers Andrew brought you.

166
00:08:17,111 --> 00:08:18,294
They're gorgeous.

167
00:08:19,078 --> 00:08:20,079
It's the least I could do.

168
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,303
Julie knows how I feel
about her. Don't you, Jules?

169
00:08:23,372 --> 00:08:25,638
I love that you two have
stayed friends all these years.

170
00:08:25,721 --> 00:08:27,588
Yeah, well, we... ke kind of lost touch

171
00:08:27,621 --> 00:08:28,523
when she was in med school,

172
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:32,512
but... but ever since she quit...
I mean, we talk all the time.

173
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:34,656
She quit med school?

174
00:08:35,862 --> 00:08:38,593
I... I thought she told you.
It was six months ago.

175
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,762
She's been out of school for six months?

176
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:44,169
You are so lucky you're in a coma right now.

177
00:08:44,818 --> 00:08:46,053
What has she been doing all this time?

178
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:48,482
She didn't know what she
wanted to do with her life,

179
00:08:48,552 --> 00:08:51,387
so while she was deciding,
she got herself a job...

180
00:08:51,461 --> 00:08:52,815
Waiting tables.

181
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:56,774
Did you just say "waiting tables"?

182
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,546
I thought she... 
Told me?

183
00:08:58,643 --> 00:08:59,552
Yeah, no, she didn't.(Forced laugh)

184
00:09:00,743 --> 00:09:02,273
This is unreal.

185
00:09:03,261 --> 00:09:06,177
Yesterday, I found out Julie
thought she was pregnant.

186
00:09:06,835 --> 00:09:09,420
And now I'm finding out that
my daughter the surgeon

187
00:09:09,471 --> 00:09:12,474
is actually my daughter the... waitress.

188
00:09:12,557 --> 00:09:14,312
I'm gonna need a moment.

189
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,756
Take your time.
I'll... I'll just... wait!

190
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,124
The guy.
What guy?

191
00:09:20,216 --> 00:09:21,943
Julie was seeing some guy.

192
00:09:22,018 --> 00:09:24,050
You two talk all the time.

193
00:09:25,372 --> 00:09:26,246
What do you know?

194
00:09:27,455 --> 00:09:29,719
Now would be an excellent time
to wake up and help me.

195
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:31,513
Andrew, who is he?

196
00:09:32,225 --> 00:09:34,290
He may be the one that attacked her.

197
00:09:34,349 --> 00:09:38,489
All I know is there was a guy,
but i... I... I don't know his name.
Oh, please.

198
00:09:38,597 --> 00:09:41,199
Why would she tell you she was
seeing someone and not say who?

199
00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:42,398
Because he's married.

200
00:09:47,345 --> 00:09:50,206
What you got there?

201
00:09:50,301 --> 00:09:51,135
Mints.

202
00:09:51,756 --> 00:09:52,530
Mints?

203
00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:54,832
Mints that are...

204
00:09:55,786 --> 00:09:57,743
"Ribbed for her pleasure"?!

205
00:09:57,918 --> 00:10:00,272
Yeah, we found a whole box
of them under ana's bed.

206
00:10:02,338 --> 00:10:03,226
Ana!

207
00:10:03,292 --> 00:10:04,648
Can I have one before dinner?

208
00:10:04,715 --> 00:10:06,529
No! No, you can't eat these!

209
00:10:06,591 --> 00:10:09,505
These aren't mints.
They're... balloons.

210
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,276
Yay!

211
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:13,394
Grownup balloons.

212
00:10:14,127 --> 00:10:15,814
Do you and daddy play with them?

213
00:10:16,622 --> 00:10:19,008
If we did, you and I wouldn't
be having this conversation.

214
00:10:21,148 --> 00:10:22,498
Nice knock.

215
00:10:23,361 --> 00:10:24,272
What are these?

216
00:10:24,365 --> 00:10:26,528
Well, those are condoms.

217
00:10:26,599 --> 00:10:29,220
You see, when a boy and a
girl like each other... 

218
00:10:29,326 --> 00:10:31,990
Shut it. Juanita and Celia
found these under your bed.

219
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:34,861
Okay, I want a lock on my door.
I've got news for you.

220
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:38,645
That is not where the lock is gonna go.
This is really none of your business.

221
00:10:38,723 --> 00:10:42,079
Sorry. 17 plus condoms?
Totally my business.

222
00:10:42,165 --> 00:10:45,309
What's the story? Are you
sleeping with John Rowland?

223
00:10:45,405 --> 00:10:47,285
Aunt Gaby, he's my boss.

224
00:10:47,365 --> 00:10:49,679
Ah! And the oscar goes to...

225
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:50,988
not you.

226
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:52,220
Okay, fine.

227
00:10:53,091 --> 00:10:54,986
But we haven't done anything...

228
00:10:55,951 --> 00:10:57,541
Yet.

229
00:10:57,646 --> 00:11:00,062
"Yet"? Why is there a "yet"? I love him.

230
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,339
Did you hear me? I said I love him.

231
00:11:07,217 --> 00:11:08,855
I heard you. I was swallowing vomit.

232
00:11:11,067 --> 00:11:12,862
You and John... not gonna happen.

233
00:11:12,953 --> 00:11:15,351
What is it about John
that gets you so crazy?

234
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,023
He was just your gardener.

235
00:11:17,141 --> 00:11:19,530
I'm not crazy! And
this conversation is over.

236
00:11:24,426 --> 00:11:25,321
I promised the girls

237
00:11:25,367 --> 00:11:27,317
They could fill these with water
and drop them off the roof.

238
00:11:30,427 --> 00:11:31,572
Come on, kids. Let's go!

239
00:11:33,168 --> 00:11:34,865
Hey, Porter. Can I talk to you?

240
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,039
Hey, Mrs. Bolen.

241
00:11:36,116 --> 00:11:38,433
Uh, sorry. I've gotta go
pick up Penny from school.

242
00:11:46,493 --> 00:11:47,199
Whoa!

243
00:11:49,319 --> 00:11:50,317
This'll just take a minute.

244
00:11:51,056 --> 00:11:51,869
Okay.

245
00:11:51,953 --> 00:11:54,714
So, uh, this Friday night,
what do you say you help me

246
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:57,014
throw Danny a little party at our place?

247
00:11:57,093 --> 00:11:59,777
A party?
Yeah. He needs to make some friends.

248
00:11:59,831 --> 00:12:00,954
He's a little shy,

249
00:12:01,024 --> 00:12:02,657
and this whole thing with Julie has not helped.

250
00:12:02,714 --> 00:12:04,995
Okay, here's the thing.
Danny and I don't hang out.

251
00:12:05,072 --> 00:12:06,777
We don't have that much in common.

252
00:12:08,215 --> 00:12:10,692
Well... Danny likes money.

253
00:12:10,786 --> 00:12:12,391
Do you like money?

254
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,148
Sure.

255
00:12:14,973 --> 00:12:17,033
See? You do have something in common.

256
00:12:17,179 --> 00:12:18,570
Are you bribing me?

257
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:21,353
No. This is to pay for the party.

258
00:12:22,092 --> 00:12:23,597
And, of course, if there's a little left over...

259
00:12:24,554 --> 00:12:25,659
Oh.

260
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:27,081
And I almost forgot.

261
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,929
You can't have a party without beer.

262
00:12:30,888 --> 00:12:32,119
Okay, is this a trick?

263
00:12:32,196 --> 00:12:33,264
Is my mother hiding in the bushes

264
00:12:33,326 --> 00:12:36,779
to see if I take the bait? 
I just want him to have a good time.

265
00:12:36,887 --> 00:12:39,285
So make sure you invite
some nice people,

266
00:12:39,364 --> 00:12:40,609
maybe a couple of cute girls.

267
00:12:43,691 --> 00:12:45,103
Anything for my good friend Danny.

268
00:12:48,754 --> 00:12:50,974
All right, how about this one?

269
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:54,041
It's a lovely 4-tier cake with pink fondant.

270
00:12:55,099 --> 00:12:55,910
Hmm.

271
00:12:56,223 --> 00:12:58,402
Okay.

272
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,823
Well, after showing you 43 cake designs,

273
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:03,096
I've learned that "hmm" means "no."

274
00:13:03,168 --> 00:13:04,501
But you're getting married in two days,

275
00:13:04,588 --> 00:13:06,152
so unless you wanna shove wedding jell-O

276
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,607
into each other's faces, you
really need to make a decision.

277
00:13:08,671 --> 00:13:12,270
Oh, I'm sorry. We just want
everything to be perfect and... 

278
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,420
Ooh! 

279
00:13:15,102 --> 00:13:16,080
What's this one?

280
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:19,648
Oh, this must be a new design
by my partner Katherine.

281
00:13:19,745 --> 00:13:20,763
You like it?

282
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:22,165
I love it.

283
00:13:22,392 --> 00:13:23,756
Wonderful.

284
00:13:24,898 --> 00:13:27,405
Now... what flavor do you want?

285
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,299
I would suggest

286
00:13:28,388 --> 00:13:30,453
a classic white cake
with raspberry genoise.

287
00:13:31,301 --> 00:13:32,193
Hmm.

288
00:13:33,298 --> 00:13:34,651
Hmm.

289
00:13:39,721 --> 00:13:42,688
Hey, Carlos, notice anything
different about Lynette?

290
00:13:42,768 --> 00:13:44,124
What are you talking about?

291
00:13:44,396 --> 00:13:47,138
Check her out in this photo from
the Christmas party last year.

292
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:48,961
Before...

293
00:13:50,335 --> 00:13:51,532
after.

294
00:13:51,781 --> 00:13:53,211
Whoa.

295
00:13:54,282 --> 00:13:55,493
Lynette got implants.

296
00:13:55,739 --> 00:13:58,517
Definitely. And look at those puppies.

297
00:14:00,104 --> 00:14:01,932
Wait a minute.
Aren't you gay?

298
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:05,983
You can't ask me that.
Well, if you're not,

299
00:14:06,042 --> 00:14:07,201
I'm gonna have to punch you in the face

300
00:14:07,286 --> 00:14:08,405
for checking out my married friend.

301
00:14:08,513 --> 00:14:10,732
So gay!

302
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:12,244
Judy-Liza-Barbra gay!

303
00:14:12,274 --> 00:14:13,575
Proud member since '89!

304
00:14:19,716 --> 00:14:21,287
So for the third quarter,

305
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:24,769
net income increased
by 20% compared to...

306
00:14:26,531 --> 00:14:27,615
What are you looking at?

307
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,457
Sorry, Lynette. I just... 

308
00:14:31,636 --> 00:14:32,529
I know.

309
00:14:33,464 --> 00:14:34,876
You know what?

310
00:14:35,835 --> 00:14:37,182
Your little secret.

311
00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:42,712
Oh, God, you know about the twins?

312
00:14:43,531 --> 00:14:45,647
Well, I mean, yeah. I have eyes.

313
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,318
Okay, first of all, this was not planned.

314
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:50,415
It wasn't?

315
00:14:50,644 --> 00:14:52,199
God, no! Tom and I went out to dinner,

316
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:54,301
he got me drunk, and
the next thing I knew...

317
00:14:54,464 --> 00:14:55,821
Ah.

318
00:14:56,072 --> 00:14:58,773
So Tom's responsible for all this.

319
00:14:59,711 --> 00:15:01,340
Well... who else?

320
00:15:02,273 --> 00:15:03,976
God, you are such a good wife.

321
00:15:04,254 --> 00:15:05,662
I wish you'd talk to Gaby,

322
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:09,793
get her to jump on the bandwagon.
Doesn't Gaby already have her hands full

323
00:15:09,924 --> 00:15:14,827
with the two she's got?
Mnh, they're okay. I always
thought we could do better.

324
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,012
What?!
You know, Gaby really looks up to you.

325
00:15:18,832 --> 00:15:22,042
If she knew you got a boob
job, she might consider it.

326
00:15:22,273 --> 00:15:23,296
Boob job?

327
00:15:23,545 --> 00:15:26,035
Sorry. Breast enhancement.

328
00:15:26,976 --> 00:15:28,727
Just give her the name of your doctor.

329
00:15:28,818 --> 00:15:29,959
He did great work.

330
00:15:30,284 --> 00:15:32,514
Oh! Oh.

331
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,159
Oh, now I... 

332
00:15:35,033 --> 00:15:36,812
O... okay. Got it.

333
00:15:38,018 --> 00:15:39,029
Sure.

334
00:15:39,255 --> 00:15:41,542
By the way, let this be a lesson to you.

335
00:15:41,651 --> 00:15:43,298
Don't try to hide things from me.

336
00:15:44,056 --> 00:15:46,914
I'm a little too sharp for that.
Okay.

337
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:50,822
Susan?

338
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:52,653
Here.

339
00:15:53,885 --> 00:15:55,986
Hey, I, uh, just got called on a job.

340
00:15:56,108 --> 00:15:57,456
It's just a busted water main,

341
00:15:57,542 --> 00:15:59,499
so I should be back by... 
Whoa.

342
00:16:02,451 --> 00:16:03,578
What happened here?

343
00:16:03,683 --> 00:16:05,911
I came across Julie's journal.

344
00:16:06,974 --> 00:16:08,299
Okay.

345
00:16:08,525 --> 00:16:09,899
She never says his name.

346
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,233
Whose name?

347
00:16:11,491 --> 00:16:13,452
The married man she's been seeing.

348
00:16:13,622 --> 00:16:16,903
She doesn't use his name.
She just uses the initial... "D."

349
00:16:18,953 --> 00:16:21,111
Why would she use a code
in her own journal?

350
00:16:21,363 --> 00:16:23,700
Oh, because she's afraid
her mom might come across it?

351
00:16:24,008 --> 00:16:27,144
Okay, I know that I am invading her privacy.

352
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:29,922
I mean, screw it. This is an emergency.

353
00:16:30,151 --> 00:16:32,575
I bet this D. is the sick bastard who...

354
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:37,783
Hey.

355
00:16:37,867 --> 00:16:39,233
Shh.

356
00:16:41,789 --> 00:16:43,264
And you know the worst part?

357
00:16:44,167 --> 00:16:45,436
I read this and...

358
00:16:46,716 --> 00:16:49,102
it's like it was written by a stranger.

359
00:16:51,118 --> 00:16:53,086
I mean, who is this girl?

360
00:16:54,794 --> 00:16:56,501
She dropped out of med school,

361
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:01,514
she leaves her full scholarship to wait tables,

362
00:17:01,616 --> 00:17:02,576
And then when she came back,

363
00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:04,752
she started an affair
with a married man.

364
00:17:05,729 --> 00:17:07,666
I don't know that Julie.

365
00:17:09,656 --> 00:17:12,550
I mean, what is going on with her?

366
00:17:12,727 --> 00:17:13,973
Hello?

367
00:17:15,707 --> 00:17:16,720
Really?

368
00:17:17,644 --> 00:17:19,760
You can ask her yourself. She's awake.

369
00:17:25,288 --> 00:17:27,892
Dr. Hill? How is she? Can I see her?

370
00:17:27,942 --> 00:17:28,988
Yeah, just so you know,

371
00:17:29,051 --> 00:17:30,735
she doesn't remember anything
about being attacked.

372
00:17:30,848 --> 00:17:32,452
She's very tired and needs her rest,

373
00:17:32,504 --> 00:17:35,099
so just sit with her, okay?
No questions.

374
00:17:35,201 --> 00:17:36,171
Of course.

375
00:17:37,834 --> 00:17:39,802
I'll just... sit.

376
00:17:43,705 --> 00:17:44,948
Oh, Julie.

377
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:47,832
It is so good to see you awake.

378
00:17:49,112 --> 00:17:50,293
Hey, mom.

379
00:17:50,434 --> 00:17:52,005
Oh, how are you feeling?

380
00:17:52,346 --> 00:17:53,725
Oh, wait. I forgot.

381
00:17:54,417 --> 00:17:55,633
Doctor said no questions.

382
00:17:55,718 --> 00:18:00,844
So.. I'm just gonna sit here
and... look at you.

383
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:02,930
Thanks.

384
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:04,331
I'm really tired.

385
00:18:04,587 --> 00:18:06,641
Oh. Well, you just sleep, baby.

386
00:18:13,062 --> 00:18:15,297
Just so you know, you're not pregnant.

387
00:18:16,194 --> 00:18:17,176
What?

388
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:19,657
Well, Lynette said you
were scared you might be.

389
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:21,531
But you're not, so...

390
00:18:21,626 --> 00:18:23,066
Yay!

391
00:18:23,154 --> 00:18:24,854
She shouldn't have told you that.

392
00:18:25,051 --> 00:18:27,177
Oh. Now I've upset you. I'm sorry.

393
00:18:27,325 --> 00:18:30,556
Uh, just ignore me and you sleep.

394
00:18:30,792 --> 00:18:32,770
Okay.

395
00:18:41,219 --> 00:18:42,571
If you want,

396
00:18:42,756 --> 00:18:45,099
I could tell your boyfriend
that you're better.

397
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:47,294
My boyfriend?

398
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:50,484
Well, I knew you thought
that you were pregnant,

399
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:53,089
and I don't see you going
the turkey baster route,

400
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,811
so I just assumed
that you had a boyfriend.

401
00:18:56,064 --> 00:18:58,801
I could call him for you.
Ugh, mom.

402
00:18:58,876 --> 00:19:00,347
Unless you think he strangled you

403
00:19:00,417 --> 00:19:04,278
because he's married.
I don't want to talk about this now.

404
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:07,395
Then we won't.

405
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:10,564
I'm not even here. You just rest.

406
00:19:11,768 --> 00:19:12,647
How can I rest

407
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:14,025
when you come in here
with all these questions?

408
00:19:14,138 --> 00:19:16,120
Have I asked you one single question?

409
00:19:16,229 --> 00:19:19,285
I mean, besides that one?
I think you should go.

410
00:19:19,535 --> 00:19:22,254
Julie, please. I am your mom.

411
00:19:22,474 --> 00:19:25,133
There is not a thing
that you can't tell me.

412
00:19:25,368 --> 00:19:28,331
I know, and I'm telling you to go.

413
00:19:30,078 --> 00:19:31,234
Okay.

414
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:43,485
I miss you, too.

415
00:19:45,491 --> 00:19:46,940
A peach nightgown. Why?

416
00:19:48,096 --> 00:19:50,880
Karl, we are not doing this
on the phone again!

417
00:19:51,042 --> 00:19:53,304
If you can't sleep, take a pill.

418
00:19:54,779 --> 00:19:55,985
Mm.

419
00:20:18,191 --> 00:20:21,433
Katherine, I'm glad you're here.
We, uh, really need to talk.

420
00:20:21,677 --> 00:20:24,038
If it's about ordering the tents
for the Henderson reunion,

421
00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:25,756
already done.

422
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:28,398
I saw you at Mike and Susan's last night.

423
00:20:29,923 --> 00:20:31,780
You were spying on me?

424
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,355
I am not the spy in this story.

425
00:20:35,521 --> 00:20:36,680
Okay, you saw me.

426
00:20:36,792 --> 00:20:38,464
Want to know what I saw?

427
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:44,102
Susan went to bed early,
and Mike watched a ball game.

428
00:20:44,337 --> 00:20:46,185
Does that sound like a marriage to you?

429
00:20:46,316 --> 00:20:47,587
That sounds exactly like a marriage.

430
00:20:48,495 --> 00:20:49,651
All I know is,

431
00:20:49,905 --> 00:20:52,972
it was really nice to watch
a ball game with Mike again.

432
00:20:53,061 --> 00:20:55,300
Through a window!

433
00:20:55,543 --> 00:20:58,122
Katherine, you are losing your grip here.

434
00:20:58,815 --> 00:21:01,115
Mike loves Susan. He is
not coming back to you.

435
00:21:01,304 --> 00:21:02,428
And if you can't accept that,

436
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:04,272
then you really need to get some help.

437
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:08,125
You just cannot stand
to see me happy, can you?

438
00:21:08,252 --> 00:21:12,488
Okay, I realize you're upset... because
you know that once I get Mike back,

439
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:15,239
I am gonna have more in my
life than just work.

440
00:21:15,303 --> 00:21:17,325
And I'm not gonna be able
to do your job for you.

441
00:21:17,403 --> 00:21:20,306
Excuse me?
You're never here anymore, Bree.

442
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:22,667
You're always so busy these days.

443
00:21:22,745 --> 00:21:24,109
But you're never too busy

444
00:21:24,189 --> 00:21:26,096
to take bows for the food that I cooked,

445
00:21:26,174 --> 00:21:29,990
and I am tired of carrying you!
Okay, well, that's gonna stop right now

446
00:21:30,058 --> 00:21:32,341
because I am putting you
on sick leave for three weeks,

447
00:21:32,421 --> 00:21:34,029
effective immediately.
I'm not sick.

448
00:21:35,036 --> 00:21:36,713
Yes, you are.

449
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,251
Now go.

450
00:21:48,191 --> 00:21:51,431
You've got some admirers out there.

451
00:21:52,307 --> 00:21:53,045
Oh?

452
00:21:53,137 --> 00:21:53,910
Yeah, as you walked by,

453
00:21:53,966 --> 00:21:55,531
I heard one of them say, "check
out the rack on that one."

454
00:21:56,875 --> 00:22:00,496
Aw. Can I do the honors and call security?

455
00:22:00,598 --> 00:22:02,236
No, and here's why.

456
00:22:02,505 --> 00:22:04,182
They're the Bertollini brothers.

457
00:22:04,412 --> 00:22:06,418
They've got a $200 million pension fund

458
00:22:06,495 --> 00:22:07,852
they're looking for somebody to run.

459
00:22:08,131 --> 00:22:11,201
Why are you telling this to "the rack"?

460
00:22:12,054 --> 00:22:14,138
Just listen. We take them to dinner,

461
00:22:14,203 --> 00:22:17,108
they admire the girls
up close and personal,

462
00:22:17,209 --> 00:22:18,571
then we close the deal.

463
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,541
And then they leave the money
on the dresser, right?

464
00:22:24,152 --> 00:22:26,271
What, you're mad?
Yeah., of course I'm mad.

465
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:28,386
You can't use my breasts as bait.

466
00:22:29,212 --> 00:22:30,426
Where do you get this attitude?

467
00:22:30,624 --> 00:22:33,517
Come on. You don't buy
Christmas ornaments

468
00:22:33,613 --> 00:22:34,947
unless you're gonna
hang 'em on a tree.

469
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,354
Okay, bad metaphor.

470
00:22:37,415 --> 00:22:40,168
My point is, why would you get those things

471
00:22:40,236 --> 00:22:41,757
if you don't want people looking at them?

472
00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:43,725
I guess...

473
00:22:45,857 --> 00:22:46,600
I...

474
00:22:46,889 --> 00:22:48,245
I wouldn't have.

475
00:22:49,983 --> 00:22:51,333
Okay.

476
00:22:55,494 --> 00:22:57,640
When do we do this?
Tonight.

477
00:22:57,812 --> 00:23:00,014
And if it makes you feel any better,

478
00:23:00,998 --> 00:23:01,991
buy yourself a new dress...

479
00:23:02,274 --> 00:23:04,236
on the company.

480
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,501
A man just gave me a credit
card because of my boobs.

481
00:23:11,425 --> 00:23:13,992
That makes me feel less like a hooker.

482
00:23:18,008 --> 00:23:19,194
John.

483
00:23:19,432 --> 00:23:21,895
Hey, Gaby. What's up?

484
00:23:22,087 --> 00:23:24,214
If my niece has her way, her skirt.

485
00:23:24,314 --> 00:23:27,876
Excuse me?
You pulled out the old John Rowland charm,

486
00:23:28,004 --> 00:23:30,118
and now Ana has fallen for you.

487
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:33,705
So she has a little crush. I think it's sweet.

488
00:23:33,938 --> 00:23:34,882
No, no, no.

489
00:23:34,949 --> 00:23:36,911
"Sweet" would be doodling
your name in her notebook.

490
00:23:37,026 --> 00:23:40,044
Ana bought condoms in
what looked like a valu-pack.

491
00:23:40,935 --> 00:23:43,833
Wow. I had no idea she was that serious.

492
00:23:44,579 --> 00:23:47,482
I mean, I was only flirting with her... a little.

493
00:23:48,237 --> 00:23:49,596
Well, she's 17,

494
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:52,161
so you're also flirting
with an orange jumpsuit.

495
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,767
You're pretty worked up about this.

496
00:23:53,829 --> 00:23:57,623
You should be, too.
If you lay one finger on Ana,

497
00:23:57,725 --> 00:23:59,570
Carlos will knock every tooth
out of your mouth,

498
00:23:59,637 --> 00:24:01,981
which will make you pretty
darn popular in prison.

499
00:24:02,077 --> 00:24:03,949
Look, I'm not really into Ana.

500
00:24:04,207 --> 00:24:07,236
Okay, I was flirting with her
to see if you still cared.

501
00:24:07,331 --> 00:24:09,016
And obviously, you do.

502
00:24:11,017 --> 00:24:12,261
No, I don't.

503
00:24:12,396 --> 00:24:13,670
Really?

504
00:24:13,968 --> 00:24:15,257
Uh, if you weren't jealous,

505
00:24:15,351 --> 00:24:17,959
then why'd you forbid me
to drive Ana home?

506
00:24:18,185 --> 00:24:19,831
Because I remember
what you could accomplish

507
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:21,194
in a parked car.

508
00:24:21,967 --> 00:24:23,837
Look, I think about those days a lot, Gaby.

509
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,976
I mean, I was just a kid.

510
00:24:26,265 --> 00:24:28,146
You know, I had to mow lawns for a living,

511
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:30,594
and I couldn't offer you
anything but... but sex.

512
00:24:30,665 --> 00:24:35,391
But now I can offer you so much more.
W... what are you talking about?

513
00:24:35,564 --> 00:24:37,480
I have a lot of money now, Gaby.

514
00:24:37,746 --> 00:24:39,175
You know, and... and you're stuck in a house

515
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,336
with two kids and a husband
who's never home.

516
00:24:41,558 --> 00:24:43,087
And when I saw you again,

517
00:24:43,307 --> 00:24:45,407
with macaroni and cheese on your t-shirt,

518
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:47,501
I said to myself, "what a shame.

519
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:48,866
"You know, this gorgeous woman

520
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:52,266
should be sipping champagne on a yacht."

521
00:24:53,653 --> 00:24:55,511
So... what, you're gonna rescue me?

522
00:24:55,749 --> 00:24:58,316
Tell me you're not unhappy.
I'm not.

523
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:02,289
Why don't I believe you?

524
00:25:10,199 --> 00:25:11,583
Ana, wait!

525
00:25:28,424 --> 00:25:29,394
Carlos?

526
00:25:29,623 --> 00:25:30,750
He isn't home yet.

527
00:25:32,048 --> 00:25:34,174
Ana, we have to talk.

528
00:25:34,277 --> 00:25:37,434
You knew that I liked him.
How could you do this?

529
00:25:37,643 --> 00:25:40,330
Okay, what you saw wasn't
what you thought it was.

530
00:25:40,783 --> 00:25:41,614
Oh, did you slip,

531
00:25:41,678 --> 00:25:43,885
and your tongue accidentally
fell into John's mouth?

532
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:46,362
I didn't kiss John! John kissed me!

533
00:25:46,454 --> 00:25:47,993
And no tongues were involved!

534
00:25:48,241 --> 00:25:50,498
Yeah, well, you have
your version. I have mine.

535
00:25:50,685 --> 00:25:53,105
We'll see which one uncle Carlos believes.

536
00:25:54,645 --> 00:25:56,660
Okay, Ana, I'm gonna
tell you something.

537
00:25:59,569 --> 00:26:00,534
Ten years ago,

538
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:03,004
John Rowland and I...

539
00:26:04,182 --> 00:26:05,623
had an affair.

540
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:08,553
Your uncle Carlos knows about it.

541
00:26:08,709 --> 00:26:10,400
A lot of people got hurt.

542
00:26:11,333 --> 00:26:13,027
But we survived it.

543
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:17,397
I have no more feelings for John.

544
00:26:18,381 --> 00:26:21,149
But today I found out
he still has feelings for me.

545
00:26:25,788 --> 00:26:27,591
I saw you staring at this the other day.

546
00:26:29,207 --> 00:26:30,513
I didn't understand it then.

547
00:26:32,323 --> 00:26:33,986
Now I do.

548
00:26:39,432 --> 00:26:40,074
Ana...

549
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,537
I was staring at a memory.
Yes.

550
00:26:47,727 --> 00:26:49,312
And sometimes when I'm
having a rough day,

551
00:26:49,368 --> 00:26:50,872
I think about what might have been.

552
00:26:53,836 --> 00:26:55,589
But trust me, I would never go back.

553
00:27:02,106 --> 00:27:05,747
Look, Ana, I love your uncle Carlos,

554
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:07,309
and we have a wonderful life together.

555
00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:10,094
Please, do not do anything
that's gonna hurt him.

556
00:27:15,606 --> 00:27:16,744
Hey, guys.

557
00:27:18,077 --> 00:27:19,350
Finally got home early.

558
00:27:19,488 --> 00:27:21,211
Hi. Ohh.

559
00:27:21,441 --> 00:27:24,365
Mmm. Wo what's new?

560
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:27,790
I was just telling aunt Gaby...

561
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:33,248
that I wanna quit my job.

562
00:27:39,666 --> 00:27:41,092
Anyway, I have homework.

563
00:27:45,763 --> 00:27:47,562
Mom?

564
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:49,233
I found this on my bed.

565
00:27:49,465 --> 00:27:52,971
You like it? Yeah. What's the occasion?

566
00:27:53,225 --> 00:27:55,230
The party. I want you to look good.

567
00:27:56,082 --> 00:27:57,397
You didn't have to do that.

568
00:27:58,865 --> 00:28:01,973
Why not? I wanted to buy
something nice for my son.

569
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:04,097
Besides, it made me feel less guilty

570
00:28:04,199 --> 00:28:06,367
about buying this for me.

571
00:28:06,521 --> 00:28:07,851
Cute, huh?

572
00:28:08,084 --> 00:28:09,049
Yeah.

573
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,279
Wait till you see it on me.

574
00:28:22,062 --> 00:28:24,382
Are you ever gonna get
that thing taken care of?

575
00:28:24,651 --> 00:28:25,797
What, the scar?

576
00:28:26,027 --> 00:28:29,150
Mnh. I don't even see it anymore.

577
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:32,637
They can get rid of those things
these days, mom.

578
00:28:32,848 --> 00:28:35,779
- Yeah, but that costs money.
So?

579
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:38,578
We have to be careful
about money. You know that.

580
00:28:38,742 --> 00:28:40,668
I don't see dad being careful.

581
00:28:40,829 --> 00:28:43,015
He bought a new set of golf clubs.

582
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:44,972
Danny, listen to me.

583
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:48,254
After the explosion, I was in bad shape.

584
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:51,504
You father took real good care of me.

585
00:28:52,364 --> 00:28:53,382
He hung in there.

586
00:28:53,603 --> 00:28:55,605
He's a good man. Don't you forget that.

587
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:04,892
One day, I'm gonna make a lot of money,

588
00:29:05,761 --> 00:29:07,090
and we're gonna get that scar fixed.

589
00:29:08,104 --> 00:29:08,996
Oh, honey.

590
00:29:11,266 --> 00:29:12,396
And don't worry.

591
00:29:12,533 --> 00:29:14,969
Whatever happens,
I'm gonna take care of you.

592
00:29:24,539 --> 00:29:27,158
Whoa. Check out the dress. It's fantastic.

593
00:29:28,182 --> 00:29:29,466
What'd it cost?

594
00:29:29,555 --> 00:29:30,794
My dignity.

595
00:29:30,898 --> 00:29:32,138
Worth every penny.

596
00:29:32,226 --> 00:29:34,444
Aren't you going to check your jacket?

597
00:29:34,587 --> 00:29:36,477
Well, it's a little chilly in here.

598
00:29:37,155 --> 00:29:39,166
Lynette, it's not chilly.

599
00:29:39,342 --> 00:29:42,317
And even if it was, that's more
of a reason to lose the jacket.

600
00:29:43,075 --> 00:29:44,125
Hmm?

601
00:29:44,336 --> 00:29:46,130
Come on. It's just for one night.

602
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:48,753
Fine.

603
00:29:50,642 --> 00:29:52,939
I will check this for you. Go meet the guys.

604
00:30:15,573 --> 00:30:17,138
And there he is now.

605
00:30:17,284 --> 00:30:18,635
Hey, I was just telling these guys about... 

606
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:20,032
Hey, could I talk to you for a sec, dad?

607
00:30:27,548 --> 00:30:28,444
What are you doing?

608
00:30:30,686 --> 00:30:31,901
What, I can't talk to people?

609
00:30:32,006 --> 00:30:33,012
A lot of people are here,

610
00:30:33,077 --> 00:30:34,353
but you pick a couple 20-year-old girls?

611
00:30:34,437 --> 00:30:38,293
Danny, come on. I'm saying hello
to a couple of your friends.

612
00:30:38,387 --> 00:30:39,311
Yeah, well, don't.

613
00:30:41,088 --> 00:30:43,181
You know, I've been gettin' this
vibe from you for a while now,

614
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:46,845
and I don't think I deserve it.
Oh, I think you do.

615
00:30:48,251 --> 00:30:49,435
You do? Why is that?

616
00:30:50,854 --> 00:30:52,383
Because I know.

617
00:30:54,776 --> 00:30:56,006
You know what, son?

618
00:31:00,932 --> 00:31:03,643
Jeez, Nick! What the hell?!

619
00:31:03,827 --> 00:31:05,671
What do you gotta crash
every party in the world?

620
00:31:06,441 --> 00:31:08,504
I bet you want him the hell out of here.

621
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,736
I'm on it. Have fun, baby. Come on.

622
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:22,155
Hi, sweetheart.

623
00:31:22,335 --> 00:31:23,418
Hey!

624
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:24,826
Hooker's home.

625
00:31:25,896 --> 00:31:27,353
How did it go?

626
00:31:27,567 --> 00:31:30,187
It was bizarre.

627
00:31:30,364 --> 00:31:33,628
From the moment I walked in
with the girls here,

628
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:38,236
I got smiles, winks. Men pulled out my chair.

629
00:31:38,315 --> 00:31:41,424
The busboy filled my water glass
every two minutes.

630
00:31:41,553 --> 00:31:42,733
And the Bertollini brothers,

631
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:45,039
who seem to think our proposal
was written on my cleavage,

632
00:31:45,102 --> 00:31:46,677
were putty in my hands.

633
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:50,252
They signed the deal on the spot!
That's great!

634
00:31:50,422 --> 00:31:52,608
Congratulations.
Yeah.

635
00:31:55,742 --> 00:31:58,051
So why are men so obsessed
with these things?

636
00:31:59,281 --> 00:32:01,222
I don't know what to say, honey.

637
00:32:01,388 --> 00:32:04,084
I mean, some guys, uh,
are just breast men.

638
00:32:04,752 --> 00:32:06,072
"Some guys," huh?

639
00:32:06,816 --> 00:32:09,414
Me? I appreciate all
aspects of the female... 

640
00:32:09,566 --> 00:32:11,404
I'm up here, Tom.
Come on.

641
00:32:11,477 --> 00:32:15,025
Come on, I've seen pictures
of your old girlfriends.

642
00:32:15,096 --> 00:32:16,084
Just admit it.

643
00:32:16,266 --> 00:32:19,202
Okay. My name it Tom Scavo,
and I like big breasts.

644
00:32:20,562 --> 00:32:21,779
But you married me.

645
00:32:22,658 --> 00:32:25,065
Man, I stepped right
into that one, didn't I?

646
00:32:25,129 --> 00:32:28,678
So let me ask you. You ever
feel like you compromised?

647
00:32:29,859 --> 00:32:31,343
Yeah. 

648
00:32:32,136 --> 00:32:35,719
Okay, I'm giving you
one chance to start over.

649
00:32:36,112 --> 00:32:37,113
No, no, no, no. I...

650
00:32:37,177 --> 00:32:39,966
I need you to not be perfect.

651
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:42,031
Why?

652
00:32:42,286 --> 00:32:44,161
Because I'm not perfect.

653
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:48,884
I'm not... rich.

654
00:32:49,754 --> 00:32:51,215
I'm not brilliant.

655
00:32:52,291 --> 00:32:54,530
I'm not movie star handsome.

656
00:32:55,659 --> 00:32:57,946
If you didn't have this one flaw,

657
00:32:58,674 --> 00:33:01,133
I would spend every moment
of every day wondering,

658
00:33:01,317 --> 00:33:03,039
what the heck is she doing with me?

659
00:33:06,968 --> 00:33:08,545
You may not be brilliant,

660
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:11,649
but you can tiptoe through a minefield

661
00:33:11,716 --> 00:33:13,856
better than anyone I know.

662
00:33:14,974 --> 00:33:15,987
Well done.

663
00:33:16,213 --> 00:33:18,314
Mwah.

664
00:33:18,477 --> 00:33:20,150
Mmm.

665
00:33:20,304 --> 00:33:21,471
Hi.

666
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:23,122
Hi.

667
00:33:23,363 --> 00:33:26,221
I tried to wait up, but today was just too much.

668
00:33:26,466 --> 00:33:27,582
What happened?

669
00:33:27,778 --> 00:33:29,679
Well, the repairman finally showed up,

670
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:32,063
but he didn't have the
right part so he left again.

671
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:35,275
Then Celia hid my car keys

672
00:33:35,354 --> 00:33:36,930
so I couldn't take her to the dentist.

673
00:33:37,084 --> 00:33:39,069
Then she forgot where she put them.

674
00:33:40,872 --> 00:33:41,508
I told them both

675
00:33:41,612 --> 00:33:43,151
they'd be sorry when their father got home,

676
00:33:43,228 --> 00:33:45,021
except you didn't... until now.

677
00:33:46,097 --> 00:33:47,157
I'm sorry, Gaby.

678
00:33:48,888 --> 00:33:50,316
It's okay.

679
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:53,100
It's kind of funny when you think about it.

680
00:33:55,636 --> 00:33:56,509
What?

681
00:33:59,126 --> 00:34:00,204
My life.

682
00:34:01,696 --> 00:34:03,530
It just seems so small sometimes.

683
00:34:06,959 --> 00:34:07,703
I spend my days

684
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:11,536
thinking about detergent and groceries...

685
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:15,325
or how I'm gonna get the spot
out of the upholstery.

686
00:34:17,009 --> 00:34:17,672
It's not at all

687
00:34:17,727 --> 00:34:19,621
the life I thought I'd choose for myself.

688
00:34:21,944 --> 00:34:22,803
But some days,

689
00:34:24,085 --> 00:34:24,784
I look up,

690
00:34:27,378 --> 00:34:29,313
and I realize I'm happy.

691
00:34:33,803 --> 00:34:35,975
I'm honest to God
happy with my life.

692
00:34:39,617 --> 00:34:42,440
Anyway, I just thought
you might like to know that.

693
00:34:55,371 --> 00:34:56,666
Can I help you with that?

694
00:34:58,747 --> 00:34:59,506
Katherine.

695
00:34:59,776 --> 00:35:01,685
You're supposed to be on sick leave.

696
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,364
I'm better. Really.

697
00:35:04,221 --> 00:35:05,204
Now what can I do?

698
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:07,424
I don't want to fight.

699
00:35:08,923 --> 00:35:10,514
Neither do I.

700
00:35:10,656 --> 00:35:12,514
I've lost so much these past few weeks.

701
00:35:12,783 --> 00:35:14,358
My job and your friendship... it's...

702
00:35:15,974 --> 00:35:18,590
it's all I have left, and I can't lose those.

703
00:35:19,333 --> 00:35:20,230
Oh, honey.

704
00:35:24,699 --> 00:35:27,593
So... are we friends again?

705
00:35:27,703 --> 00:35:28,714
Of course.

706
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:30,912
I've just been worried
about you, that's all.

707
00:35:31,022 --> 00:35:34,744
But if you say you're better,
then.... I believe you.

708
00:35:34,822 --> 00:35:38,599
Good, because I really, really am.

709
00:35:42,102 --> 00:35:43,102
What the hell is that?

710
00:35:43,247 --> 00:35:45,519
Oh, that's the cake.

711
00:35:45,635 --> 00:35:47,517
No, that's my cake.

712
00:35:47,619 --> 00:35:50,580
Yes. The bride saw your
design and just loved it.

713
00:35:50,698 --> 00:35:52,658
No, it's my cake... 

714
00:35:52,794 --> 00:35:55,054
the one I designed for my wedding... 

715
00:35:55,202 --> 00:35:56,887
mine and Mike's.

716
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:57,936
Oh.

717
00:35:58,088 --> 00:36:00,971
Well, aren't you glad we
found a good use for it?

718
00:36:01,066 --> 00:36:04,530
I watched another bride marry my fiance.

719
00:36:04,613 --> 00:36:08,527
I am not going to watch
another bride eat my cake.

720
00:36:08,782 --> 00:36:10,842
Well, no one says you have to watch, dear.

721
00:36:11,921 --> 00:36:13,257
Katherine, I know you're upset,

722
00:36:13,349 --> 00:36:16,166
but don't you dare take it out on that cake!

723
00:36:16,287 --> 00:36:20,160
It's mine. And if I can't have it, nobody will.

724
00:36:20,237 --> 00:36:23,511
Katherine, don't you touch that cake!
Aah!

725
00:36:26,303 --> 00:36:27,498
Somebody help!

726
00:36:28,414 --> 00:36:29,046
Oh!

727
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,090
Stop that woman!

728
00:36:31,914 --> 00:36:33,189
It's mine!

729
00:36:34,515 --> 00:36:37,673
...  to be my lawfully wedded
wife and one true love.

730
00:36:38,818 --> 00:36:41,868
I promise to cherish, honor and protect you,

731
00:36:41,976 --> 00:36:44,420
and to love you more each day
than I did the day before.

732
00:36:44,572 --> 00:36:46,343
You may now kiss the bride.

733
00:36:46,572 --> 00:36:47,907
Katherine, no!

734
00:36:50,866 --> 00:36:51,868
Hi.

735
00:36:52,007 --> 00:36:53,142
Hey.

736
00:36:54,117 --> 00:36:55,080
Good to see you out of bed.

737
00:36:58,001 --> 00:36:59,193
I'm sorry about yesterday.

738
00:37:00,902 --> 00:37:03,940
So... have you remembered
anything else about the attack?

739
00:37:05,486 --> 00:37:06,395
Nothing.

740
00:37:08,728 --> 00:37:10,413
Uh, Julie,

741
00:37:11,147 --> 00:37:13,780
you know, everybody wants
to see the guy who did this

742
00:37:13,851 --> 00:37:16,807
off the streets, but the police
don't have much to go on.

743
00:37:16,866 --> 00:37:19,473
So... if they could talk to this...

744
00:37:21,014 --> 00:37:22,978
Man that you were seeing... 
Mom.

745
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,816
Maybe they could cross him off the list.

746
00:37:26,996 --> 00:37:28,160
He didn't do it.

747
00:37:29,402 --> 00:37:31,586
And I'm not seeing him anymore, okay?

748
00:37:32,338 --> 00:37:33,493
I broke it off.

749
00:37:33,613 --> 00:37:34,679
You broke it off?

750
00:37:36,388 --> 00:37:38,269
Well, that's a motive right there.

751
00:37:38,349 --> 00:37:39,965
At least let them question him.

752
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,600
If he's innocent, he has nothing to lose.

753
00:37:43,696 --> 00:37:45,790
Except for his family when they find out.

754
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:51,247
So now you're concerned about his family.

755
00:37:51,355 --> 00:37:53,508
What did you say?
You heard me, Julie.

756
00:37:53,601 --> 00:37:56,238
For God sake, what were you
thinking, dating a married man?

757
00:38:04,697 --> 00:38:05,583
Don't do this.

758
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,689
I am your mother. I love you.

759
00:38:08,778 --> 00:38:11,925
I have spent the last five days sitting there,

760
00:38:12,643 --> 00:38:14,635
not sleeping, not eating.

761
00:38:16,819 --> 00:38:18,076
Don't shut me out.

762
00:38:22,841 --> 00:38:25,716
I was lonely. Okay?

763
00:38:26,981 --> 00:38:28,149
He was nice.

764
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,154
It... it just happened.

765
00:38:35,028 --> 00:38:36,131
I don't see how.

766
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:38,946
This is not something you would do.

767
00:38:41,292 --> 00:38:42,164
Well, guess what?

768
00:38:43,901 --> 00:38:45,656
I'm not perfect anymore.

769
00:38:46,984 --> 00:38:48,582
That perfect daughter you remember

770
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:50,807
who was always there
when you needed her,

771
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,367
who held everything together
when you were falling apart?

772
00:38:54,163 --> 00:38:57,344
She's grown up, and she's
going to make mistakes.

773
00:39:00,365 --> 00:39:01,907
You wanna make mistakes? Fine.

774
00:39:02,025 --> 00:39:04,086
Dye your hair, drop out
of school. I don't care.

775
00:39:04,846 --> 00:39:07,136
I never expected you to be perfect,

776
00:39:08,061 --> 00:39:10,196
but I didn't raise you
to do something this stupid.

777
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:15,486
You know what an affair like this can do.

778
00:39:16,379 --> 00:39:18,645
You saw it firsthand.

779
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,681
Morning. Katherine?

780
00:39:30,463 --> 00:39:31,864
Where do you think you're going?

781
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,728
To the test kitchen.

782
00:39:33,844 --> 00:39:35,681
We need to start prep on
the Berman bar mitzvah.

783
00:39:36,876 --> 00:39:39,922
Yesterday, you nearly destroyed
my company's reputation.

784
00:39:40,047 --> 00:39:41,672
Today you're worried about prep work?

785
00:39:42,418 --> 00:39:43,596
I don't want to talk about yesterday.

786
00:39:43,696 --> 00:39:45,096
It won't happen again.

787
00:39:45,181 --> 00:39:46,691
That's right, because you're fired.

788
00:39:48,073 --> 00:39:49,760
I'm sorry, but I see no other way

789
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,054
to get you realize how serious this is.

790
00:39:52,147 --> 00:39:55,065
You have got to give up
this obsession with Mike

791
00:39:55,144 --> 00:39:56,339
before it ruins your life.

792
00:39:57,124 --> 00:40:00,673
I need to work. It's all
that's keeping me going.

793
00:40:01,518 --> 00:40:04,344
You need help, counseling.

794
00:40:04,423 --> 00:40:05,765
I'm telling you this as your friend.

795
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,114
You are not my friend.

796
00:40:10,857 --> 00:40:11,816
Yes, I am.

797
00:40:12,691 --> 00:40:14,714
That's why I'm taking such a firm hand.

798
00:40:16,286 --> 00:40:18,203
Your only job now is to get better.

799
00:40:20,263 --> 00:40:21,316
Katherine...

800
00:40:22,148 --> 00:40:24,442
I'm gonna need you to give me your keys.

801
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:40,020
There ya go.

802
00:40:40,103 --> 00:40:43,266
A souvenir of our... friendship.

803
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,994
You wouldn't think of it to look at her,

804
00:40:49,116 --> 00:40:53,108
but the lady next door is
having a nervous breakdown.

805
00:40:55,207 --> 00:40:57,034
You'd never guess by her smile,

806
00:40:57,123 --> 00:41:01,408
but the wife of your uncle
once betrayed his trust.

807
00:41:04,807 --> 00:41:06,385
And that daughter you adore...

808
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:11,168
Well, she's having an affair
with a married man.

809
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:18,848
The sad truth is,

810
00:41:19,083 --> 00:41:21,483
we don't know our friends and neighbors

811
00:41:21,578 --> 00:41:24,305
nearly as well as we think we do.

812
00:41:26,522 --> 00:41:28,976
Even the people we trust most...

813
00:41:29,934 --> 00:41:31,268
keep secrets.

814
00:41:31,507 --> 00:41:32,776
Hey, Julie.

815
00:41:32,984 --> 00:41:34,502
It's Dominic.

816
00:41:36,684 --> 00:41:37,638
I miss you.
