<i>Previously on Desperate Housewives...</i>

2
00:00:02,663 --> 00:00:05,165
Your ex-husband was
part owner in a business.

3
00:00:05,166 --> 00:00:07,700
<i>Susan came into an inheritance.</i>

4
00:00:07,701 --> 00:00:11,604
Who do I speak to about selling
my share of herpes on parade?

5
00:00:11,605 --> 00:00:13,873
<i>Lynette acquiesced...</i>

6
00:00:13,874 --> 00:00:17,544
- Looks like we'll be going to therapy
together. - That is great news! Thank you.

7
00:00:17,545 --> 00:00:19,312
As soon as graduate
high school,

8
00:00:19,313 --> 00:00:21,414
I'm going to New York
to be a model.

9
00:00:21,415 --> 00:00:23,883
<i>Angie's concerns
made her more protective.</i>

10
00:00:23,884 --> 00:00:26,686
You know I've always felt bad
about the way we've had

11
00:00:26,687 --> 00:00:29,122
To raise you,
being on the run and all.

12
00:00:29,123 --> 00:00:30,790
The door stays open.

13
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:33,026
- I want it closed.
- You stink.

14
00:00:33,027 --> 00:00:35,061
And you're a whore!
Here's the difference.

15
00:00:35,062 --> 00:00:37,564
I can get clean.

16
00:00:37,565 --> 00:00:39,833
- Stop!
- Say "please".

17
00:00:39,834 --> 00:00:42,268
<i>- And Orson expressed his feelings.
- Please!</i>

18
00:00:42,269 --> 00:00:44,304
That's the life
I'm facing now...

19
00:00:44,305 --> 00:00:46,539
Having to ask people for help,
for everything.

20
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,975
Do you know how hard
that is?!

21
00:00:53,113 --> 00:00:57,383
<i>Orson Hodge
was smiling again,</i>

22
00:00:57,384 --> 00:01:00,453
<i>And it was starting to worry
his wife.</i>

23
00:01:02,923 --> 00:01:05,592
<i>You see, since his accident,</i>

24
00:01:05,593 --> 00:01:07,494
<i>Bree Hodge had grown accustomed</i>

25
00:01:07,495 --> 00:01:10,230
<i>To her husband's
severe mood swings.</i>

26
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,503
<i>She had grown used to
his unexpected rage...</i>

27
00:01:18,038 --> 00:01:20,573
<i>His sudden anguish...</i>

28
00:01:22,076 --> 00:01:25,111
<i>His deep depression.</i>

29
00:01:25,112 --> 00:01:29,916
<i>But lately, an odd tranquility
had settled over orson,</i>

30
00:01:29,917 --> 00:01:34,220
<i>And his wife had the feeling
something was terribly wrong.</i>

31
00:01:34,221 --> 00:01:38,291
<i>Sadly, she was right.</i>

32
00:01:41,428 --> 00:01:44,163
What's, um, going on here?

33
00:01:44,164 --> 00:01:46,165
Hello, Bree.

34
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:49,135
Just thought I'd give away some
things I don't need anymore.

35
00:01:49,636 --> 00:01:52,372
Hey, Orson.
You got these in 8 and half?

36
00:01:52,373 --> 00:01:55,041
Sorry, Roy.
Just carry men's sizes.

37
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:57,911
Look, I can understand

38
00:01:57,912 --> 00:02:00,713
Why you might want to give away
your sporting equipment,

39
00:02:00,714 --> 00:02:03,983
But why would you give away
your books and your cds?

40
00:02:03,984 --> 00:02:07,253
And for god sakes, you can
still use your headphones.

41
00:02:07,254 --> 00:02:09,289
These are amazing!

42
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:11,691
Give me those.

43
00:02:11,692 --> 00:02:14,160
What is wrong with you people?

44
00:02:14,161 --> 00:02:16,663
Don't you realize
you're taking advantage

45
00:02:16,664 --> 00:02:19,032
Of a man who is
emotionally distraught?

46
00:02:19,033 --> 00:02:22,101
- He seemed to be in a great mood.
- Until lady sunshine walked in.

47
00:02:22,102 --> 00:02:26,039
- We're sorry, Bree. We assumed you guys had talked about
it. - Well, we didn't, and that doesn't excuse the fact

48
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,374
That you're all acting
like a bunch of vultures.

49
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:30,310
It's a good thing I came home,

50
00:02:30,311 --> 00:02:32,679
Or you'd be
picking through his closet.

51
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,981
Um, you know what, guys?

52
00:02:34,982 --> 00:02:36,382
We should go.

53
00:02:36,383 --> 00:02:39,118
And please leave
your plunder behind.

54
00:02:39,119 --> 00:02:42,755
Hey, come on. At my age,
it's just a short-term loan.

55
00:02:48,896 --> 00:02:51,531
What has gotten into you?

56
00:02:51,532 --> 00:02:52,932
I'm sorry, darling.

57
00:02:52,933 --> 00:02:55,268
I had no intention
of upsetting you.

58
00:02:55,269 --> 00:02:57,870
Keep my things,
give them away.

59
00:02:57,871 --> 00:03:00,206
Ultimately,
it doesn't matter.

60
00:03:00,207 --> 00:03:04,611
<i>Yes, Orson Hodge
was smiling again</i>

61
00:03:04,612 --> 00:03:08,615
<i>And Bree would soon learn
the reason why.</i>

62
00:03:08,616 --> 00:03:11,317
<i>You see, her husband...</i>

63
00:03:11,318 --> 00:03:14,387
<i>Had decided to kill himself.</i>

Oh, look who's here!

74
00:04:07,007 --> 00:04:08,875
The garbage police.

75
00:04:08,876 --> 00:04:10,810
I hate to bug you,

76
00:04:10,811 --> 00:04:14,847
But you're still not separating
your glass and plastics.

77
00:04:14,848 --> 00:04:17,884
The city passed
that ordinance, remember?

78
00:04:17,885 --> 00:04:19,752
How I envy you...

79
00:04:19,753 --> 00:04:23,222
Young, pretty, able to crouch
for hours behind a bush,

80
00:04:23,223 --> 00:04:25,758
Waiting for a neighbor
to dump her trash.

81
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,062
Look, maybe you don't get
how easy it is to recycle.

82
00:04:29,063 --> 00:04:32,098
Oh, I get it.
I just don't want to do it.

83
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:34,167
I've been throwing styrofoam
into the trash

84
00:04:34,168 --> 00:04:36,102
Since before you were born,

85
00:04:36,103 --> 00:04:38,771
And the sky is still blue
and the grass is still green.

86
00:04:38,772 --> 00:04:41,507
Maybe now, but what will it be
like for our grandchildren?

87
00:04:41,508 --> 00:04:43,443
My son is shooting blanks,

88
00:04:43,444 --> 00:04:45,445
And my daughter likes
the ladies.

89
00:04:45,446 --> 00:04:48,414
Grandkids are
the least of my concerns.

90
00:04:48,415 --> 00:04:51,417
- So you don't care about our planet at all?
- By the time it's a problem, I'll be long gone.

91
00:04:51,418 --> 00:04:54,554
Let the cockroaches
and the robots fight over it.

92
00:05:02,396 --> 00:05:04,430
What was that all about?

93
00:05:04,431 --> 00:05:06,165
Oh, what do you think?

94
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:11,204
Come on. Look, one old crank
doesn't want to recycle.

95
00:05:11,205 --> 00:05:13,740
You don't care about that stuff
anymore, remember?

96
00:05:13,741 --> 00:05:16,642
- Of course I still care.
- Yeah, fine. Yeah, you can care.

97
00:05:16,643 --> 00:05:19,645
Just... Don't be
blowing our cover.

98
00:05:19,646 --> 00:05:21,681
So what am
I supposed to do?

99
00:05:21,682 --> 00:05:25,151
Stand back and watch her
defile our planet?

100
00:05:25,152 --> 00:05:27,653
That's exactly what
you're supposed to do.

101
00:05:29,623 --> 00:05:32,158
"Sometimes you... you chain
yourself to the tree,

102
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:35,194
And sometimes you go after
the guy with the saw."

103
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,931
That's what Patrick
used to say.

104
00:05:38,932 --> 00:05:42,468
We don't talk about
Patrick anymore.

105
00:05:42,469 --> 00:05:45,505
- I'm just saying.
- So am I.

106
00:05:51,612 --> 00:05:55,882
So the lawyer says
you sign right here,

107
00:05:55,883 --> 00:05:59,418
And you are officially bought
out of the strip club business.

108
00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:03,356
Let's hope I don't get
my share in singles.

109
00:06:03,357 --> 00:06:06,425
And here's a little something
to remember us by.

110
00:06:06,426 --> 00:06:10,029
"Lap dancing...
It's a grind."

111
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,964
Well, I will be sure
to wear this

112
00:06:11,965 --> 00:06:15,301
On the next field trip I take
with my students. Thanks, Jimbo.

113
00:06:15,302 --> 00:06:18,104
- Good luck.
- You, too.

114
00:06:18,105 --> 00:06:21,274
- Bye, Mrs. D.
- Take care, Robin.

115
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,011
"Moby Dick"?

116
00:06:25,012 --> 00:06:28,047
No, it's not what you think.
It's about a whale.

117
00:06:28,048 --> 00:06:31,083
Yes, I know.
Uh, it's a classic.

118
00:06:31,084 --> 00:06:32,985
Well, I saw an article about

119
00:06:32,986 --> 00:06:35,121
A hundred books you should
read before dying,

120
00:06:35,122 --> 00:06:36,989
And I thought, you know,

121
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:39,692
With all the high cholesterol
in my family,

122
00:06:39,693 --> 00:06:42,195
- I better get crackin'.
- Oh, good for you.

123
00:06:42,196 --> 00:06:45,231
So what are you
gonna do now?

124
00:06:45,232 --> 00:06:48,734
Oh, um, uh, well, this was,
uh, never really my job.

125
00:06:48,735 --> 00:06:50,903
I'm actually a teacher.

126
00:06:50,904 --> 00:06:52,205
Really?

127
00:06:52,206 --> 00:06:55,474
Oh, that is so cool.
I thought about being a teacher.

128
00:06:55,475 --> 00:06:57,410
I actually went
a couple semesters,

129
00:06:57,411 --> 00:06:59,512
But then my family had
some money problems,

130
00:06:59,513 --> 00:07:02,815
And, well, nine years later,
I'm still wearing tassels.

131
00:07:02,816 --> 00:07:06,085
Robin, you're being requested
in the V.I.P. Lounge.

132
00:07:13,827 --> 00:07:17,396
Well, um, good luck
with those hundred books.

133
00:07:17,397 --> 00:07:18,931
Thank you.

134
00:07:18,932 --> 00:07:21,934
Oh, not this guy again.

135
00:07:21,935 --> 00:07:24,070
I keep telling him
to keep the tips

136
00:07:24,071 --> 00:07:26,072
And buy himself
a toothbrush.

137
00:07:26,073 --> 00:07:28,741
Robin, wait.

138
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:33,946
You don't have to keep doing
this if it makes you unhappy.

139
00:07:33,947 --> 00:07:37,783
Well, I've got bills to pay,
Mrs. Delfino.

140
00:07:37,784 --> 00:07:40,753
No, I know, but you don't
have to work here.

141
00:07:40,754 --> 00:07:43,756
- You could do anything you want.
- That's easy to say.

142
00:07:43,757 --> 00:07:45,424
Well, I mean it.

143
00:07:45,425 --> 00:07:48,294
It is never too late
to change your life.

144
00:07:50,397 --> 00:07:52,465
Robin, now.

145
00:07:59,473 --> 00:08:00,940
Thank you.

146
00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:04,577
You're taking that
with you?

147
00:08:04,578 --> 00:08:06,212
When customers get grabby,

148
00:08:06,213 --> 00:08:08,848
I like to have something to wha.

149
00:08:08,849 --> 00:08:12,151
I almost killed a guy with
"war and peace".

150
00:08:16,323 --> 00:08:17,857
So I'm driving.

151
00:08:17,858 --> 00:08:20,893
- This guys pulls out in front of me.
- Cuts him off.

152
00:08:20,894 --> 00:08:24,196
- Yes. I was a little pissed.
- You were furious.

153
00:08:24,197 --> 00:08:27,400
But at the stoplight, when I
start to tell the guy off,

154
00:08:27,401 --> 00:08:29,869
Tom leans over and says,
"sorry. Uh, no big deal.

155
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:32,739
- She's just having a bad day." - You
didn't have to take the guy's head off.

156
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,542
- He was a maniac.
- She flipped him the bird.

157
00:08:34,543 --> 00:08:38,012
- I was sticking up for you!
- Yes, but Tom was driving, Lynette.

158
00:08:38,013 --> 00:08:40,014
Whether he chose to ignore it

159
00:08:40,015 --> 00:08:42,583
Or try to run the man
f the road, it's his decision.

160
00:08:43,084 --> 00:08:45,552
Let him be in the
driver's seat sometimes,

161
00:08:45,853 --> 00:08:49,088
Literally and figuratively.

162
00:08:51,824 --> 00:08:56,562
Bringing the score to Tom 4
and controlling bitch 0.

163
00:08:56,563 --> 00:08:59,298
There's no scoreboard
in this room. You know that.

164
00:09:01,434 --> 00:09:03,603
I think you both did
some great work today.

165
00:09:03,604 --> 00:09:08,507
- Next Tuesday, same time?
- Thanks, doctor. It felt really great.

166
00:09:08,508 --> 00:09:10,242
Yeah, great.

167
00:09:13,546 --> 00:09:16,985
I always feel so much better
when we get out of there.

168
00:09:16,986 --> 00:09:18,885
- Yeah, I bet you do.
- What, don't you?

169
00:09:19,186 --> 00:09:21,820
I mean, I really think
she got this... Working.

170
00:09:21,821 --> 00:09:24,490
Yeah, I think
she's got this... Working

171
00:09:24,491 --> 00:09:26,859
And this...
Is getting beat up.

172
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,428
Come on, Lynette.
Don't feel like that.

173
00:09:29,429 --> 00:09:32,364
- It's true. She always sides with you.
I want a second opinion. - Lynette.

174
00:09:32,365 --> 00:09:34,667
Maybe we should think about
seeing another therapist.

175
00:09:34,668 --> 00:09:37,069
When we started,
you loved her.

176
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,505
Yeah, and when we started,
I loved you, too.

177
00:09:39,506 --> 00:09:42,341
Things change.
Now let's go.

178
00:09:42,342 --> 00:09:44,210
Hold on.

179
00:09:44,211 --> 00:09:46,845
I think I left my keys.

180
00:09:48,415 --> 00:09:51,250
No, I can't. I have
dress rehearsal tonight.

181
00:09:52,251 --> 00:09:54,353
Okay. Talk to you later.

182
00:09:54,354 --> 00:09:56,088
I'm sorry.
I forgot my keys.

183
00:09:56,089 --> 00:09:57,590
Oh, that's okay.

184
00:09:59,025 --> 00:10:01,327
Um, I didn't mean
to eavesdrop.

185
00:10:01,328 --> 00:10:04,230
Did you say you had
dress rehearsal?

186
00:10:04,231 --> 00:10:05,664
Oh, that.

187
00:10:05,665 --> 00:10:08,567
Yes, I'm sort of in a little
play that runs this weekend.

188
00:10:08,568 --> 00:10:10,803
Really?
You're an actor, too?

189
00:10:10,804 --> 00:10:12,705
Well, I dabbled in college.

190
00:10:12,706 --> 00:10:15,541
I have a bit of a gift,
so I try to keep it alive.

191
00:10:15,542 --> 00:10:18,711
Wow, what's the play? I mean,
we'd... we'd love to come see it.

192
00:10:18,712 --> 00:10:21,046
"Antony and Cleopatra." but it's
just a community production.

193
00:10:21,047 --> 00:10:23,048
I would never force you
to sit through it.

194
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:24,818
Oh, okay. Well, if you don't
want us to come...

195
00:10:24,819 --> 00:10:27,288
Here's a flyer.
Matinees are half-off.

196
00:10:31,858 --> 00:10:34,793
- Hey. - Hey! I need Ana
to watch the girls

197
00:10:34,794 --> 00:10:36,729
While I run to the store,

198
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:39,832
- And big shock, she's not answering her cell.
- Oh, no problem. Come on in.

199
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,135
They're just
up in Danny's room.

200
00:10:43,136 --> 00:10:45,738
Ana!

201
00:10:45,739 --> 00:10:48,274
Gaby's here!

202
00:10:48,275 --> 00:10:50,542
So they're in Danny's room?

203
00:10:50,543 --> 00:10:52,745
Oh, yeah.
They were listening to music.

204
00:10:52,746 --> 00:10:55,114
It was so loud,
I made them shut the door.

205
00:10:55,115 --> 00:10:57,316
So they're
by themselves...

206
00:10:57,317 --> 00:10:58,917
With the door shut?

207
00:10:58,918 --> 00:11:02,655
Just a couple of teenagers
alone with their genitals?

208
00:11:04,424 --> 00:11:07,359
Ana!
Get your ass down here!

209
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,361
Gaby, what's the big deal?

210
00:11:09,362 --> 00:11:12,498
- They're just hanging out in Danny's room.
- With a mattress. Why don't you just crack

211
00:11:12,499 --> 00:11:14,466
A bottle of champagne
on Ana's pelvis

212
00:11:14,467 --> 00:11:16,368
And wish Danny a bon voyage?

213
00:11:16,369 --> 00:11:18,137
Ana! Now!

214
00:11:18,138 --> 00:11:20,472
Hold on. I'm coming.

215
00:11:20,473 --> 00:11:23,742
I'm sure she meant
she's on her way.

216
00:11:23,743 --> 00:11:26,645
What's going on?

217
00:11:26,646 --> 00:11:29,948
I have to run to the store.
I need you to watch the girls.

218
00:11:29,949 --> 00:11:32,885
That's it? Jeez, I thought
the house was on fire.

219
00:11:32,886 --> 00:11:35,421
Let me grab my stuff.

220
00:11:35,422 --> 00:11:38,891
So... You worried
they might be doing it?

221
00:11:38,892 --> 00:11:41,493
Yeah. What I don't get is
why you're not worried.

222
00:11:41,494 --> 00:11:43,729
They are
healthy, red-blooded kids.

223
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:47,099
- They're gonna do what they're gonna do.
- So we say nothing and just fluff their pillows?

224
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,702
No. We make sure they don't
do anything stupid.

225
00:11:49,703 --> 00:11:51,770
Have you gotten Ana
birth control?

226
00:11:51,771 --> 00:11:54,173
I make her spend time
with Juanita and Celia.

227
00:11:54,174 --> 00:11:57,309
- I was hoping that would do it.
- Come on, Gaby.

228
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:00,446
You have to talk to her
about safe sex, condoms.

229
00:12:00,447 --> 00:12:02,981
She's only 17.
She's too young!

230
00:12:02,982 --> 00:12:05,918
How old were you
when you first did it?

231
00:12:08,321 --> 00:12:10,889
Ana, hurry up!

232
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:13,759
Gotta hit the pharmacy, too!

233
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:32,644
I didn't hear you come in.

234
00:12:32,645 --> 00:12:35,114
"Dearest Bree,
I will always love you,

235
00:12:35,115 --> 00:12:37,583
"but the will to fight on
has left me,

236
00:12:37,584 --> 00:12:41,353
So I've chosen to...
Exit life on my own terms."

237
00:12:41,354 --> 00:12:43,322
Is this a suicide note?

238
00:12:43,323 --> 00:12:46,725
Well, it's really more
of a suicide rough draft.

239
00:12:46,726 --> 00:12:49,595
Oh, my God!

240
00:12:49,596 --> 00:12:52,498
I didn't mean for you
to find out this way.

241
00:12:52,499 --> 00:12:54,500
But now that you know,

242
00:12:54,501 --> 00:12:58,570
- At least we can discuss it like adults.
- There is nothing to discuss.

243
00:12:58,571 --> 00:13:00,606
Orson...

244
00:13:00,607 --> 00:13:02,875
This is obviously
the depression talking.

245
00:13:02,876 --> 00:13:06,712
- We will get you some medication.
- Bree. Bree.

246
00:13:06,713 --> 00:13:10,382
There's no need for you
to feel badly about this.

247
00:13:10,383 --> 00:13:12,751
I've had a good life.

248
00:13:12,752 --> 00:13:14,253
Let me go.

249
00:13:14,254 --> 00:13:16,321
I will do no such thing.

250
00:13:16,322 --> 00:13:17,890
I forbid this.

251
00:13:17,891 --> 00:13:21,126
Do you hear me? You will
not be killing yourself.

252
00:13:21,127 --> 00:13:23,662
I will remove every knife, rope
and pill from this house,

253
00:13:23,663 --> 00:13:26,899
And if I have to, I will be
with you 24 hours a day.

254
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:31,136
Well, being bored to death
wasn't how I was planning to go,

255
00:13:31,137 --> 00:13:34,940
But we can try it your way.

256
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,710
Orson!

257
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,582
I'll give you some time
to adjust to this.

258
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,717
But understand me.

259
00:13:45,718 --> 00:13:47,820
It's going to happen.

260
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,514
What's with the condoms?

261
00:14:04,515 --> 00:14:06,315
Calm down.
They're not for you.

262
00:14:06,316 --> 00:14:09,819
Ah, just what every man wants
to hear from his wife.

263
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,288
So?

264
00:14:12,289 --> 00:14:15,892
Ok, hear me out. You know
how Ana is dating Danny Bolen?

265
00:14:16,593 --> 00:14:19,095
- I'm gonna kill him.
- And we have to be realistic.

266
00:14:19,096 --> 00:14:21,165
- With my bare hands... - Because
they're not gonna listen to reason.

267
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:25,135
- And bury him under the porch.
- No, Carlos. What choice do we have?

268
00:14:25,136 --> 00:14:27,604
They're two teenagers who are
getting seriously involved.

269
00:14:27,605 --> 00:14:31,675
- Isn't it better to be safe than sorry? - But giving
them these is like giving them our blessing.

270
00:14:31,676 --> 00:14:33,077
And that's how I felt
at first,

271
00:14:33,078 --> 00:14:35,446
But like Angie said,
nature's gonna take its course.

272
00:14:35,447 --> 00:14:37,781
Yeah, easy for her to say.
She's got the boy.

273
00:14:38,382 --> 00:14:41,251
What if the condom breaks?
What if he forgets to put it on?

274
00:14:41,252 --> 00:14:42,753
If he knocks Ana up,

275
00:14:42,754 --> 00:14:46,690
- Who do you think's gonna end up raising
the kid? - God, that would be awful.

276
00:14:47,191 --> 00:14:49,225
Getting up
for those 3:00 A.M. feedings

277
00:14:49,226 --> 00:14:51,294
After you've worked all day?

278
00:14:51,295 --> 00:14:53,763
Not me. You.

279
00:14:53,764 --> 00:14:55,865
You'll end up
taking care of the baby.

280
00:14:55,866 --> 00:14:57,235
So you better convince her
to keep her legs crossed

281
00:14:57,236 --> 00:15:01,304
- Until she's out of this house. - Wait. How is
this my problem? She's your trampy niece.

282
00:15:01,305 --> 00:15:03,707
Because if she gets pregnant,
I'll be in prison

283
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:07,677
For killing what's buried
underneath the porch.

284
00:15:11,014 --> 00:15:12,882
Mrs. D.!

285
00:15:12,883 --> 00:15:13,984
Robin.

286
00:15:13,985 --> 00:15:16,119
I hope you don't mind
me just showing up,

287
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,089
But I thought about what
you said, and you were right.

288
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:22,993
- It's never too late to change your
life, so I quit Double D's. - You did?

289
00:15:22,994 --> 00:15:25,695
I was pretty scared at first,

290
00:15:25,696 --> 00:15:28,899
- But now I think it's the best thing I ever did.
- Well, that's great.

291
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,802
Now I never would have had
the guts without talking to you.

292
00:15:31,803 --> 00:15:35,939
- You're like my role model.
- Really? That's sweet.

293
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,875
My old role model was Candi,
down at the club,

294
00:15:38,876 --> 00:15:40,343
But she o.D.'d.

295
00:15:40,344 --> 00:15:43,113
Well, I will, uh,
try to do Candi proud.

296
00:15:44,114 --> 00:15:46,216
Good for you, Robin.

297
00:15:46,217 --> 00:15:48,518
I know change
takes a lot of courage.

298
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:50,654
Oh, it sure does.

299
00:15:52,223 --> 00:15:54,624
So what do I do now?

300
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,426
- Huh?
- You know...

301
00:15:56,427 --> 00:15:59,596
What's my next move?
Where do I work now?

302
00:15:59,597 --> 00:16:01,031
I'm sorry.

303
00:16:01,032 --> 00:16:04,167
You quit without having
anything else lined up?

304
00:16:04,168 --> 00:16:06,136
I know it was
a little hasty,

305
00:16:06,137 --> 00:16:08,638
But you said I could do
whatever I wanted.

306
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,007
You sounded so sure.
You're still sure, right?

307
00:16:11,008 --> 00:16:14,211
Yes, yes. I'm very sure.
The world is your oyster.

308
00:16:14,212 --> 00:16:16,479
You have saved up, right?

309
00:16:19,817 --> 00:16:23,220
She stripped for nine years
and didn put anything away?

310
00:16:23,221 --> 00:16:25,622
Apparently there was a boob job
and a bad relationship

311
00:16:25,623 --> 00:16:27,524
And the rising cost
of glitter.

312
00:16:27,525 --> 00:16:29,459
I have to find a way
to help her.

313
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,461
And why is this
your responsibility?

314
00:16:31,462 --> 00:16:34,331
Because I'm the one
that told her to quit.

315
00:16:34,332 --> 00:16:37,234
I didn't think she'd listen.
No one listens to me.

316
00:16:37,235 --> 00:16:40,503
I keep telling you
how much I hate that shirt,

317
00:16:40,504 --> 00:16:43,974
- And there it is. - Okay, we'll help her.
What do you have in mind?

318
00:16:43,975 --> 00:16:46,042
We need to find her a job.

319
00:16:46,043 --> 00:16:47,978
Well, what can she do?

320
00:16:47,979 --> 00:16:49,946
Does she have skills
that don't involve

321
00:16:49,947 --> 00:16:53,583
Picking up a dollar
without using her hands?

322
00:16:56,888 --> 00:16:59,890
Why are you so sad?

323
00:16:59,891 --> 00:17:02,158
Well, M.J.,

324
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:05,128
I need a job,
and I don't have any skills.

325
00:17:05,129 --> 00:17:06,796
You're so pretty.

326
00:17:06,797 --> 00:17:08,732
You could be a princess.

327
00:17:10,568 --> 00:17:13,136
Oh, look.

328
00:17:13,137 --> 00:17:15,639
M.J. is so smitten
with her.

329
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,107
He's a guy.

330
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:21,578
And she's good with kids.

331
00:17:22,947 --> 00:17:24,948
That's it.

332
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:27,517
They've been looking
for an assistant art teacher

333
00:17:27,518 --> 00:17:28,985
Down at the school.

334
00:17:28,986 --> 00:17:31,855
She said she always wanted
to do something like that.

335
00:17:31,856 --> 00:17:34,858
- Well, you think she can handle it?
- We glue macaroni to shoeboxes.

336
00:17:34,859 --> 00:17:37,227
It's not the hardest
job in the world.

337
00:17:37,228 --> 00:17:40,397
Now see, how come when I say
that, you give me that look?

338
00:17:42,066 --> 00:17:44,567
And there it is again.

339
00:17:44,568 --> 00:17:46,670
Thanks for cheering me up, M.J.

340
00:17:46,671 --> 00:17:48,138
You're so sweet.

341
00:17:48,139 --> 00:17:51,741
You can give me a bath
if you want to.

342
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,689
Jeez, you scared
the crap out of me.

343
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,958
Where's Orson? You're supposed
to be watching him.

344
00:18:07,959 --> 00:18:10,226
Don't worry. I stuck him
in the laundry room

345
00:18:10,227 --> 00:18:12,696
And put a broom
through his spokes.

346
00:18:17,001 --> 00:18:18,768
Hello, Bree.

347
00:18:18,769 --> 00:18:24,074
Can we please cross Roy off
the suicide watch list?

348
00:18:24,075 --> 00:18:27,377
Hey. You're alive.
My job's done here.

349
00:18:27,378 --> 00:18:28,878
Where have you been?

350
00:18:28,879 --> 00:18:30,714
You were supposed to
be back an hour ago.

351
00:18:30,715 --> 00:18:34,884
I am sorry, but I had to stop
and pick up our guests.

352
00:18:34,885 --> 00:18:36,586
What guests?

353
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:42,125
Orson, meet Chris and Ron.

354
00:18:42,126 --> 00:18:45,095
Now I know you won't listen
to me, but you might listen

355
00:18:45,096 --> 00:18:48,064
- To them, since you have
something in common. - Really?

356
00:18:48,065 --> 00:18:50,633
Are you Gilbert and
Sullivan fans, too?

357
00:18:50,634 --> 00:18:53,603
Sense of humor.
That's very important.

358
00:18:53,604 --> 00:18:56,606
Now I know you think there's
no reason to go on living,

359
00:18:56,607 --> 00:18:58,675
- Because you're paralyzed...
- So you thought, "hey!"

360
00:18:58,676 --> 00:19:01,544
"You know what might cheer him
up? Two more paralyzed guys."

361
00:19:01,545 --> 00:19:03,546
Please. Just hear them out.

362
00:19:03,547 --> 00:19:07,951
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to make some tea.

363
00:19:07,952 --> 00:19:11,187
So your wife tells us
you in a pretty negative place.

364
00:19:11,188 --> 00:19:14,157
- Well, that's to be expected, but eventually...
- Look, I know you mean well,

365
00:19:14,158 --> 00:19:16,259
But I don't need
a handicapped pep talk.

366
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,629
Hey, we're not handicapped.
We're handi-capable.

367
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,931
Oh, lord!

368
00:19:21,932 --> 00:19:24,701
We play basketball, dance,
we make love.

369
00:19:24,702 --> 00:19:26,669
And I hope
you're very happy together.

370
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,605
I, unfortunately,
don't have

371
00:19:28,606 --> 00:19:32,642
- Someone to join me on this journey.
- You have a wife who clearly loves you.

372
00:19:32,643 --> 00:19:34,310
Wow. Paralyzed and blind.

373
00:19:34,311 --> 00:19:37,180
You must always be the first
one to board the plane.

374
00:19:37,181 --> 00:19:40,817
Look, we know what
you're going through.

375
00:19:40,818 --> 00:19:44,054
A lot of us feel unloved after
something like this happens.

376
00:19:44,055 --> 00:19:45,522
No, you don't understand.

377
00:19:45,523 --> 00:19:49,426
My wife stays with me
solely out of obligation.

378
00:19:49,427 --> 00:19:52,395
Orson! Could you say
such a thing?

379
00:19:52,396 --> 00:19:56,032
It's true, isn't it?
You feel guilty because you know

380
00:19:56,033 --> 00:19:57,401
I never would have been hit
by that plane

381
00:19:57,402 --> 00:20:02,806
- If I hadn't gotten in a fistfight with your lover.
- This is the thanks I get? I have bent over backwards

382
00:20:02,807 --> 00:20:04,874
To make your life easier.

383
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:07,177
I should just let you
hang yourself.

384
00:20:07,178 --> 00:20:10,213
Hey... Don't we have
a basketball game at 2:00?

385
00:20:10,214 --> 00:20:12,182
Can you be honest
for one moment?

386
00:20:12,183 --> 00:20:15,385
- You don't love me.
- Yeah, we should go.

387
00:20:15,386 --> 00:20:16,953
Please stay. I've made tea.

388
00:20:16,954 --> 00:20:19,656
See? You can't deny it.

389
00:20:19,857 --> 00:20:23,293
Go ahead, Bree. Correct me.
Say you love me.

390
00:20:24,094 --> 00:20:25,762
I...

391
00:20:32,869 --> 00:20:34,437
Care very deeply for you.

392
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,042
That's what I thought.

393
00:20:44,348 --> 00:20:46,483
I'm feeling a little upset
right now.

394
00:20:46,484 --> 00:20:48,952
Would you mind
rolling yourselves out?

395
00:20:56,574 --> 00:20:58,042
Ana, let me ask you something.

396
00:20:58,043 --> 00:20:59,510
Are you happy?

397
00:20:59,511 --> 00:21:00,644
Why?

398
00:21:00,645 --> 00:21:03,347
Well, Carlos and I want you
to be happy.

399
00:21:03,348 --> 00:21:08,219
- Over the last few months, we've come to
thing of you as our own daughter. - Really?

400
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,887
In fact, your uncle

401
00:21:09,888 --> 00:21:13,090
Thinks it's about time you
and I had that little talk...

402
00:21:13,091 --> 00:21:15,159
About the birds
and the bees.

403
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:18,762
- Oh, God! - That's how I feel,
so we're not gonna be doing that.

404
00:21:19,263 --> 00:21:20,865
Okay.

405
00:21:20,866 --> 00:21:24,235
- Instead I'm going to write you a check.
- A check?

406
00:21:24,236 --> 00:21:27,738
A check big enough to cover one
whole year of modeling school...

407
00:21:27,739 --> 00:21:30,107
And to rent a decent-size apartment...

408
00:21:30,108 --> 00:21:31,909
In New York.

409
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:33,544
Okay, what's the catch?

410
00:21:33,545 --> 00:21:36,413
That's so cute that
you think there's a catch.

411
00:21:36,414 --> 00:21:39,250
This isn't signed.
That's the catch.

412
00:21:39,251 --> 00:21:41,386
I will sign it once you
graduate high school

413
00:21:41,387 --> 00:21:45,122
Without having had sex
or more sex, as the case may be.

414
00:21:45,123 --> 00:21:47,191
Are you serious?

415
00:21:47,192 --> 00:21:49,760
Ana, I could talk
to you about morality

416
00:21:49,761 --> 00:21:51,829
Or saving yourself
for marriage

417
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:54,498
Or statistics about S.T.D.s,

418
00:21:54,499 --> 00:21:56,834
But I think
you're the kind of girl

419
00:21:56,835 --> 00:21:59,270
Who responds
to cold, hard cash.

420
00:21:59,271 --> 00:22:01,906
You know me well.

421
00:22:01,907 --> 00:22:04,108
So do we hava deal?

422
00:22:04,109 --> 00:22:07,144
Are you gonna be a successful
model with a nice apartment

423
00:22:07,145 --> 00:22:09,380
Or a teenage mom
with no future?

424
00:22:09,381 --> 00:22:11,682
Well...

425
00:22:11,683 --> 00:22:14,351
When you put it
like that...

426
00:22:14,352 --> 00:22:16,287
Good girl.

427
00:22:16,288 --> 00:22:20,057
Oh, and to answer
your earlier question,

428
00:22:20,058 --> 00:22:23,160
I'm now very happy.

429
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:28,499
I can't believe
I let you talk me into this.

430
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,801
Three hours of Shakespeare

431
00:22:30,802 --> 00:22:34,305
- For a woman who has to pee
every 20 minutes. - Come on!

432
00:22:34,306 --> 00:22:36,307
Dr. Graham's been
so supportive of us.

433
00:22:36,308 --> 00:22:39,076
- Can't we be supportive of her?
- This isn't about support.

434
00:22:39,077 --> 00:22:42,746
This is about
little Tommy teacher's pet

435
00:22:42,747 --> 00:22:45,783
Wanting a gold star
for butt-kissing.

436
00:22:45,784 --> 00:22:47,184
That's not true.

437
00:22:50,689 --> 00:22:53,190
Nay, but this dotage...

438
00:22:53,191 --> 00:22:55,192
Please.

439
00:22:55,193 --> 00:22:59,129
You brought her a
40 dollar box of chocolates.

440
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:01,065
Last mother's day,
you threw me a bagel

441
00:23:01,066 --> 00:23:03,033
And called it
breakfast in bed.

442
00:23:03,034 --> 00:23:06,003
Admit it. You just have
a problem with her

443
00:23:06,004 --> 00:23:09,006
Because you hate it when
someone points out your flaws.

444
00:23:09,007 --> 00:23:10,441
That's not true.

445
00:23:10,442 --> 00:23:12,910
I can take constructive
criticism justine.

446
00:23:12,911 --> 00:23:15,279
You're being
a little loud.

447
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,880
Sorry.

448
00:23:16,881 --> 00:23:19,483
See? I can take
constructive criticism.

449
00:23:19,484 --> 00:23:22,586
- You're still talking.
- You're still annoying. Relax.

450
00:23:22,587 --> 00:23:24,588
She's making her entrance.

451
00:23:26,157 --> 00:23:30,394
Grates me... the sum.

452
00:23:30,395 --> 00:23:33,530
Nay! Hear them, Antony!

453
00:23:36,801 --> 00:23:39,470
Fluvia Perchance is angry.

454
00:23:39,471 --> 00:23:43,607
Or... Who knows?

455
00:23:43,608 --> 00:23:45,676
If the beard...

456
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,880
If the scarce-bearded Caesar

457
00:23:49,881 --> 00:23:53,217
Hath not sent you
his powerful mandate...

458
00:23:53,218 --> 00:23:56,620
"Do this or this.

459
00:23:56,621 --> 00:23:59,757
Take in that kingdom
and enfranchise that.

460
00:23:59,758 --> 00:24:01,158
Perform it".

461
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:03,360
"Or else we damn thee."

462
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:14,605
Hey. How was the play?

463
00:24:14,606 --> 00:24:17,841
Lincoln had a better time
at the theater.

464
00:24:17,842 --> 00:24:19,176
Really?

465
00:24:19,177 --> 00:24:21,245
So how bad was it?

466
00:24:21,246 --> 00:24:24,114
You remember how horrible your
second grade arbor day play was?

467
00:24:24,115 --> 00:24:27,584
But at least we were
drunk for that.

468
00:24:27,585 --> 00:24:30,154
Honestly, how did
Dr. Graham get that part?

469
00:24:30,155 --> 00:24:32,156
Is she sleeping
with the director?

470
00:24:32,157 --> 00:24:34,491
Sleeping with, bathing,
donating a kidney...

471
00:24:34,492 --> 00:24:36,627
It's still not enough.

472
00:24:36,628 --> 00:24:39,563
I just hope that I can erase
this from my memory

473
00:24:39,564 --> 00:24:41,832
Before our next session.

474
00:24:41,833 --> 00:24:44,468
Are you kidding?
We're not seeing her again.

475
00:24:44,469 --> 00:24:47,971
- Why not? - We're not going
to continue to take life lessons

476
00:24:47,972 --> 00:24:51,809
From a woman who burped
during her death scene.

477
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:55,646
That has nothing to do
with her skills as a therapist.

478
00:24:55,647 --> 00:24:59,516
Really? Did she not tell you
she has a "gift" for acting?

479
00:24:59,517 --> 00:25:01,885
- Yeah. - Well, I can't
trust the judgment

480
00:25:01,886 --> 00:25:04,288
Of someone with
absolutely no self-awareness.

481
00:25:04,289 --> 00:25:05,856
We're not going back.

482
00:25:05,857 --> 00:25:07,825
This is an excuse.
You have been looking

483
00:25:07,826 --> 00:25:10,761
For a reason to dump her
ever since our last session.

484
00:25:10,762 --> 00:25:12,563
Tom, I learned
two things tonight...

485
00:25:12,564 --> 00:25:15,866
Dr. Graham has no insight
into real human behavior,

486
00:25:15,867 --> 00:25:20,304
And there are 428 tiles
on the ceiling of that theater.

487
00:25:20,305 --> 00:25:24,174
Say what you want. We are
going to our next session.

488
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:27,511
And, by the way,

489
00:25:27,512 --> 00:25:30,280
It was 429.

490
00:25:41,321 --> 00:25:43,055
Robin Gallagher,
teaching assistant,

491
00:25:43,056 --> 00:25:44,023
Reporting for duty.

492
00:25:44,024 --> 00:25:47,893
- Hey, look at you!
- I wanted to look professional.

493
00:25:47,894 --> 00:25:50,529
Do you like the glasses?
I don't even need them.

494
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:52,933
You look great.
That's a beautiful suit.

495
00:25:52,934 --> 00:25:55,901
Thanks. It is so nice
to wear work clothes

496
00:25:55,902 --> 00:25:58,604
That don't rip away
to reveal crotchless panties.

497
00:25:58,605 --> 00:26:01,240
Yeah, you're preaching
to the choir.

498
00:26:01,241 --> 00:26:04,176
So, um, I'm just gonna get
the kids started painting.

499
00:26:04,177 --> 00:26:06,779
And why don't you hang those
globes that we made last week?

500
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,614
Okay.

501
00:26:11,384 --> 00:26:15,621
Um, can I say something?

502
00:26:15,622 --> 00:26:18,056
You really
took a chance on me.

503
00:26:18,057 --> 00:26:20,659
No one's ever done
that for me before,

504
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,594
So thank you.

505
00:26:22,595 --> 00:26:24,363
You're welcome.

506
00:26:24,364 --> 00:26:27,499
I'm really glad you're here.

507
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,034
Oh, hey, careful.

508
00:26:29,035 --> 00:26:30,903
Never let the kids
see you cry.

509
00:26:30,904 --> 00:26:33,038
If they sense weakness,
you're done.

510
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,340
Sorry we're late.

511
00:26:35,341 --> 00:26:37,643
- Forgot his backpack.
- Oh, that's okay, Mr. Linwood.

512
00:26:37,644 --> 00:26:39,678
Come on, Kyle.
Let's get you painting.

513
00:26:42,148 --> 00:26:44,049
Who's that?

514
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:47,019
That's my new teaching
assistant, Miss Gallagher.

515
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:51,557
No, Bobby. That's not
how we use pipe cleaners!

516
00:26:51,558 --> 00:26:53,759
I'm sorry.

517
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,161
Do we know each other?

518
00:26:56,462 --> 00:26:58,030
I don't think so.

519
00:26:58,031 --> 00:27:00,866
Are you sure?
You look so familiar.

520
00:27:00,867 --> 00:27:03,802
I guess I just have
one of those faces.

521
00:27:09,609 --> 00:27:12,578
What did you want to see me
about, Principal Hobson?

522
00:27:12,579 --> 00:27:14,780
You are aware, aren't you,

523
00:27:14,781 --> 00:27:16,682
That as a private school,

524
00:27:16,683 --> 00:27:18,617
We depend
on the financial support

525
00:27:18,618 --> 00:27:21,587
Of our more affluent
parent donors?

526
00:27:21,588 --> 00:27:23,288
I am aware of that.

527
00:27:23,289 --> 00:27:25,591
Good.

528
00:27:25,592 --> 00:27:28,861
Because I just got a call
from Kyle linwood's father,

529
00:27:28,862 --> 00:27:30,629
A major donor.

530
00:27:32,565 --> 00:27:35,567
Is it true that your assistant
can break a 5 dollars

531
00:27:35,568 --> 00:27:37,736
By shaking out her underwear?

532
00:27:45,812 --> 00:27:48,814
- I don't want to take a bath!
- Well, that's too bad.

533
00:27:48,815 --> 00:27:51,783
It's time to give the earth
back some of its dirt.

534
00:27:51,784 --> 00:27:53,285
Go!

535
00:27:53,286 --> 00:27:55,387
Hey, I'm gonna be
upstairs for a bit.

536
00:27:55,388 --> 00:27:57,656
What are you guys
up to tonight?

537
00:27:57,657 --> 00:28:01,226
- We're just gonna stay home
and study. - Good girl.

538
00:28:08,902 --> 00:28:12,204
Why are you getting me
all worked up?

539
00:28:12,205 --> 00:28:15,073
I thought you made
your aunt a promise.

540
00:28:15,074 --> 00:28:17,042
I promised her
I wouldn't have sex.

541
00:28:17,043 --> 00:28:19,478
I didn't promise
you wouldn't.

542
00:28:34,093 --> 00:28:37,663
Fine! I'll sort it myself!

543
00:29:05,191 --> 00:29:08,093
Mr. Solis.

544
00:29:08,094 --> 00:29:10,195
Okay, don't freak out, okay?

545
00:29:10,196 --> 00:29:13,365
- What the hell are you doing? - Hey,
I'm sorry. This won't happen again.

546
00:29:13,366 --> 00:29:17,235
- Uncle Carlos, it's no big deal. - You think
you can come into my house and do this?!

547
00:29:17,236 --> 00:29:20,405
Answer me!

548
00:29:21,507 --> 00:29:23,442
Answer me! Answer me!

549
00:29:25,378 --> 00:29:28,480
I catch you near her again,
I will kick your ass, boy.

550
00:29:28,481 --> 00:29:32,784
- Let go of him! - You know what I
caught your son doing in my house?

551
00:29:32,785 --> 00:29:34,920
- I don't care.
- Carlos, what is going on?!

552
00:29:34,921 --> 00:29:37,189
I said let go!

553
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:39,691
Oh, God!
Angie, what the hell?!

554
00:29:41,294 --> 00:29:44,429
- Wait for me outside.
- Ma, please don't.

555
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:46,231
Outside!

556
00:29:53,639 --> 00:29:56,908
Look, I came in and
found him on top of her.

557
00:29:56,909 --> 00:29:58,877
I don't care. He's my kid.

558
00:29:58,878 --> 00:30:02,514
You ever touch him again,
you're dead.

559
00:30:09,122 --> 00:30:10,589
Hey, Bolen!

560
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:14,326
I see you tried to separate
my glass and plastic.

561
00:30:18,631 --> 00:30:20,532
Suck it, earth!

562
00:30:20,533 --> 00:30:22,501
Ma!

563
00:30:30,343 --> 00:30:32,944
Come on, ma. Let's go.

564
00:30:40,883 --> 00:30:42,817
So maybe you shouldn't
just think

565
00:30:42,818 --> 00:30:44,752
About what you want to say

566
00:30:44,753 --> 00:30:47,755
But about how you say it,
so Tom can hear you.

567
00:30:51,894 --> 00:30:53,728
That's...

568
00:30:53,729 --> 00:30:55,763
A theory.

569
00:30:55,764 --> 00:30:57,965
Is something bothering
you, Lynette?

570
00:30:57,966 --> 00:31:00,167
It's the pregnancy.

571
00:31:00,168 --> 00:31:02,169
This morning
she got mad at me

572
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:04,539
Over the way I drank
my orange juice.

573
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:07,842
Is that all? You know
you're in a safe place here.

574
00:31:07,843 --> 00:31:11,445
We can tell each other
anything.

575
00:31:13,982 --> 00:31:15,883
Okay.

576
00:31:15,884 --> 00:31:18,286
Since this is a safe place...

577
00:31:20,222 --> 00:31:23,024
Tom and I saw your play
the other night.

578
00:31:23,025 --> 00:31:26,961
You did? Well, why didn't you
come backstage and say hello?

579
00:31:26,962 --> 00:31:30,798
Well, the truth is, I didn't
know what to say, because...

580
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:32,967
I didn't really like it.

581
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:37,138
I know.

582
00:31:37,139 --> 00:31:39,006
Our antony was dreadful.

583
00:31:39,007 --> 00:31:41,442
You weren't the only one
who thought so.

584
00:31:41,443 --> 00:31:43,811
No... Actually,
I was talking about you.

585
00:31:43,812 --> 00:31:46,514
You were...

586
00:31:46,515 --> 00:31:48,082
Really not very good,

587
00:31:48,083 --> 00:31:50,084
And now I've sort of
lost confidence

588
00:31:50,085 --> 00:31:53,254
In you as a therapist.

589
00:31:55,324 --> 00:31:57,024
Okay.

590
00:31:57,025 --> 00:31:58,993
Do you want to elaborate?

591
00:31:58,994 --> 00:32:01,829
No. I think I said
what I needed to say.

592
00:32:05,067 --> 00:32:07,468
See, this is the same thing
in your marriage.

593
00:32:07,469 --> 00:32:09,904
You criticize Tom,
but you won't be specific.

594
00:32:09,905 --> 00:32:12,673
It's sort of
the coward's way out.

595
00:32:12,674 --> 00:32:15,843
Coward?

596
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,680
Okay.

597
00:32:19,681 --> 00:32:21,082
You sucked.

598
00:32:21,083 --> 00:32:23,451
You were really, really bad.

599
00:32:23,452 --> 00:32:25,219
Three words...

600
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:27,788
Stink, stank, stunk.

601
00:32:27,789 --> 00:32:29,624
Specific enough?

602
00:32:31,927 --> 00:32:34,762
Good for you, Lynette.

603
00:32:34,763 --> 00:32:36,964
I commend you
for your honesty.

604
00:32:39,001 --> 00:32:43,104
Although, the "fairview herald"
had a different take.

605
00:32:43,105 --> 00:32:46,407
They found my Cleopatra
"incandescent."

606
00:32:46,408 --> 00:32:47,808
Oh... My God!

607
00:32:47,809 --> 00:32:50,011
You actually believe that?

608
00:32:50,012 --> 00:32:52,747
See, this is why we
can't see her anymore.

609
00:32:52,748 --> 00:32:54,949
Tom, you haven't
weighed in yet.

610
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:57,151
What did you think?

611
00:33:03,058 --> 00:33:06,060
I thought you were great.

612
00:33:06,061 --> 00:33:09,330
What? Liar! You said
you've seen seals playing horns

613
00:33:09,331 --> 00:33:13,367
- That put on a better show. - There's no
need to bully him into agreeing with you.

614
00:33:13,368 --> 00:33:16,437
I wouldn't have to bully him
if he would man up for once.

615
00:33:16,438 --> 00:33:19,306
- Lynette, you're attacking. - Of course.
Because I'm always the bad cop,

616
00:33:19,307 --> 00:33:21,375
He's always the good cop.

617
00:33:21,376 --> 00:33:23,377
Could you just once
not be such a wuss?

618
00:33:23,378 --> 00:33:26,013
Damn right I'm the good cop.
Someone has to be,

619
00:33:26,014 --> 00:33:28,115
Because bad cop-bad cop
doesn't work.

620
00:33:28,116 --> 00:33:31,452
I grew up in that house,
and it doesn't work.

621
00:33:31,453 --> 00:33:34,722
That is not it.
You like me being the bad guy.

622
00:33:34,723 --> 00:33:38,192
That way you c always be
the good guy. But guess what?

623
00:33:38,193 --> 00:33:41,562
I'd love to be the good guy
once in a while, but I can't,

624
00:33:41,563 --> 00:33:43,531
Because when things get hard

625
00:33:43,532 --> 00:33:45,633
Or a difficult decision
has to get made,

626
00:33:45,634 --> 00:33:47,101
You run from confrontation,

627
00:33:47,102 --> 00:33:49,036
And if I don't step
into the void,

628
00:33:49,037 --> 00:33:52,039
Things grind to a halt.
Because I got news for you...

629
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:56,210
Good cop-good cop
doesn't work either!

630
00:34:00,882 --> 00:34:02,416
You're right.

631
00:34:04,986 --> 00:34:06,287
Really?

632
00:34:06,288 --> 00:34:08,956
I like to be liked,

633
00:34:08,957 --> 00:34:10,558
And because of that,

634
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:14,462
A lot of the ugly stuff
I defer to you.

635
00:34:14,463 --> 00:34:16,030
And I'm sorry.

636
00:34:20,402 --> 00:34:23,003
Your performance was
aggressively bad.

637
00:34:23,004 --> 00:34:25,840
At one point during
the second act, I started

638
00:34:25,841 --> 00:34:29,577
To choke on a mint and thought
about not fighting it.

639
00:34:31,279 --> 00:34:33,414
Thank you.

640
00:34:34,883 --> 00:34:38,152
This was quite
a breakthrough.

641
00:34:38,153 --> 00:34:40,588
And you're right.

642
00:34:40,589 --> 00:34:43,991
You're a wonderful therapist.

643
00:34:43,992 --> 00:34:46,360
Thank you, Lynette.

644
00:34:46,361 --> 00:34:50,231
Now, both of you, get
the hell out of my office.

645
00:34:52,434 --> 00:34:55,069
So we catch her son
on top of our niece,

646
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:58,005
- And we have to apologize?
- No, we have to apologize

647
00:34:58,006 --> 00:35:00,975
Because you almost put
her son's head through a wall.

648
00:35:00,976 --> 00:35:04,011
When are you gonna learn
violence is not the answer?

649
00:35:07,482 --> 00:35:10,618
<i>I shouldn't have to tell
you this! You know better!</i>

650
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:13,354
<i>We've been doing it for 19
years. You're smarter than this!</i>

651
00:35:13,355 --> 00:35:15,323
<i>This is not the first time
we've had this conversation.</i>

652
00:35:15,324 --> 00:35:17,793
<i>I feel like I'm talking
to a wall here, huh?</i>

653
00:35:18,794 --> 00:35:20,795
What is going on here?

654
00:35:20,796 --> 00:35:22,563
<i>What the hell is wrong
with you?!</i>

655
00:35:22,564 --> 00:35:25,166
Oh, God!
He's ripping Danny a new one.

656
00:35:25,167 --> 00:35:28,336
<i>- Damn it! Angie!
- Okay, Nick, just leave me alone!</i>

657
00:35:28,337 --> 00:35:31,472
No, no, no, no. Hey!
You are getting sloppy.

658
00:35:31,473 --> 00:35:33,941
- We should go.
- Yeah, we should.

659
00:35:33,942 --> 00:35:35,876
<i>First you get into it
with that crazy lady</i>

660
00:35:35,877 --> 00:35:39,013
<i>About her recycling,
which I told you not to do.</i>

661
00:35:39,014 --> 00:35:40,782
<i>And then guess what?
She comes over this morning</i>

662
00:35:40,783 --> 00:35:43,319
<i>- And says she's thinking about
suing us. - Okay, I lost my cool.</i>

663
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,855
Well, get it back! Because
this rock we are hiding under

664
00:35:46,856 --> 00:35:51,592
Is not that big, and if people
start poking around, we're done.

665
00:35:59,921 --> 00:36:02,289
He fires her for something
she used to do.

666
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:03,758
It's so hypocritical.

667
00:36:03,759 --> 00:36:06,294
I mean, why not get mad
at the kid's father?

668
00:36:06,295 --> 00:36:09,063
He obviously goes
to Double D's.

669
00:36:10,064 --> 00:36:12,466
I just hope I didn't get
you into any trouble, Mrs. D.

670
00:36:12,467 --> 00:36:13,534
I feel awful.

671
00:36:13,535 --> 00:36:16,170
No, no, no.
This is not your fault.

672
00:36:16,171 --> 00:36:19,106
When I'm sad, my mom
gives me a big hug.

673
00:36:19,107 --> 00:36:20,975
Down, tiger.

674
00:36:20,976 --> 00:36:23,444
What am I gonna do?
I have no money for rent.

675
00:36:23,445 --> 00:36:25,479
I'm just gonna
end up homeless.

676
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,683
You know, maybe I should go
and beg for my old job back.

677
00:36:28,684 --> 00:36:30,751
No, no, no.
You can't do that.

678
00:36:30,752 --> 00:36:33,187
Quitting that place
took a lot of guts.

679
00:36:36,425 --> 00:36:39,393
How do you feel about
letting her move in here?

680
00:36:39,394 --> 00:36:41,429
Julie's gone.
We have her empty room.

681
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:44,665
- It's just until she gets on her feet.
- You're asking if I'm okay

682
00:36:44,666 --> 00:36:46,634
With letting a stripper
live with us?

683
00:36:46,635 --> 00:36:48,936
- I'm gonna go with no.
- Why not?

684
00:36:48,937 --> 00:36:52,673
- I have no idea. I'm just really sure this is a trick
question. - She's a nice girl, and she's in trouble.

685
00:36:52,674 --> 00:36:54,642
You know, I think of myself

686
00:36:54,643 --> 00:36:56,711
As a good person
who cares about others,

687
00:36:56,712 --> 00:36:59,613
And how often do I actually
get to walk the walk?

688
00:36:59,614 --> 00:37:02,750
This is an opportunity
to really help someone.

689
00:37:02,751 --> 00:37:04,785
I want to do it.

690
00:37:07,622 --> 00:37:09,490
Okay.

691
00:37:09,491 --> 00:37:11,459
Okay, let's go make
ex-stripper

692
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,394
And a little boy very happy.

693
00:37:18,433 --> 00:37:19,967
What's this for?

694
00:37:19,968 --> 00:37:21,936
The Lackeys'
50th anniversary party.

695
00:37:21,937 --> 00:37:23,571
Don't you remember?

696
00:37:23,572 --> 00:37:25,973
I'm sorry. I thought
I'd be dead by now,

697
00:37:25,974 --> 00:37:27,942
So I wasn't paying
much attention

698
00:37:27,943 --> 00:37:29,377
To our social calendar.

699
00:37:29,378 --> 00:37:31,345
Well, regardless,
you're going.

700
00:37:31,346 --> 00:37:33,681
And if you're still around
next Saturday,

701
00:37:33,682 --> 00:37:35,950
We've got brunch
with my family.

702
00:37:35,951 --> 00:37:38,452
Well, now you're
just daring me.

703
00:37:43,658 --> 00:37:48,029
Orson, Walter is about
to make a toast.

704
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,563
Don't you want to hear it?

705
00:37:49,564 --> 00:37:53,267
A speech about the joys
of wedded bliss?

706
00:37:53,268 --> 00:37:54,902
Pass.

707
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:04,445
Walter and Shirley
are about to dance

708
00:38:04,446 --> 00:38:07,148
To a song that was played
at their wedding.

709
00:38:07,149 --> 00:38:10,217
But before they do, walter would
like to say a few words.

710
00:38:10,218 --> 00:38:12,820
I want to thank
you all for coming.

711
00:38:13,021 --> 00:38:16,190
But 50 years... Would
it hardly seems possible.

712
00:38:16,191 --> 00:38:18,125
And now I'm not gonna lie to you

713
00:38:18,126 --> 00:38:20,194
And say it's always been easy.

714
00:38:20,195 --> 00:38:22,496
I mean, we've had
our share of tragedy

715
00:38:22,497 --> 00:38:26,600
And we've said a few things
we wish we could take back.

716
00:38:26,601 --> 00:38:29,203
But for the most part,
we've been lucky,

717
00:38:29,204 --> 00:38:31,872
Because no matter
how old we get,

718
00:38:31,873 --> 00:38:33,841
We've always been able
to remember

719
00:38:33,842 --> 00:38:37,611
What made us fall in love
in the first place, right, hon?

720
00:39:12,781 --> 00:39:14,415
Orson!

721
00:39:18,153 --> 00:39:19,820
Orson! Stop!

722
00:39:19,821 --> 00:39:22,723
Don't you dare throw yourself
in that pool!

723
00:39:23,925 --> 00:39:27,394
I want to die.
Why can't you let me?

724
00:39:27,395 --> 00:39:29,330
Because I want this, too.

725
00:39:29,331 --> 00:39:32,266
I want a party like this someday
toelebrate our life together.

726
00:39:32,267 --> 00:39:34,969
What is there about
our life to celebrate?

727
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:37,505
Look at Walter and
Shirley in there.

728
00:39:37,506 --> 00:39:40,474
I was watching them dance
with such passion in their eyes,

729
00:39:40,475 --> 00:39:42,910
But I know they haven't
always been like that.

730
00:39:42,911 --> 00:39:46,380
They've had their rough times,
too, but they stuck it out.

731
00:39:46,381 --> 00:39:47,848
Because they're in love.

732
00:39:47,849 --> 00:39:50,784
I asked you if you loved me,
and you couldn't answer.

733
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,757
Fine. I'll answer you now.

734
00:39:56,758 --> 00:39:58,993
I loved you once.

735
00:39:58,994 --> 00:40:01,929
Can I love you again?

736
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:03,531
I don't know.

737
00:40:05,734 --> 00:40:10,237
But I would like to recapture
whatonce had.

738
00:40:13,441 --> 00:40:16,310
And how can we do that
if you're not here?

739
00:40:17,812 --> 00:40:20,948
So... I'm asking you...

740
00:40:22,684 --> 00:40:25,085
Please stay.

741
00:40:45,607 --> 00:40:49,510
<i>In this never-ending
drama we call life,</i>

742
00:40:49,511 --> 00:40:52,813
<i>Everyone has a part to play.</i>

743
00:40:55,083 --> 00:40:59,019
<i>Some are cast
as romantic leads.</i>

744
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:04,658
<i>Others end up being the victim.</i>

745
00:41:04,659 --> 00:41:10,231
<i>and a few always
provide comic relief.</i>

746
00:41:10,232 --> 00:41:11,665
<i>And then there are</i>

747
00:41:11,666 --> 00:41:15,035
<i>Those who end up
playing the hero...</i>

748
00:41:16,738 --> 00:41:21,609
<i>Especially if they feel
there's a villain...</i>

749
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:26,614
<i>Who lives just
across the street.</i>
