1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:02,670
Previously on "Desperate Housewives"...

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:06,300
Eddie added his mother
to his list of victims.

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,499
- How'd it go?
- Well, it would go a lot faster

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,050
if we could get his mother in here.

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,430
Nobody's seen her for days.

6
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,650
Bree saw a disturbing side of Sam.

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,130
I'm afraid of him.

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,540
Susan attacked Mike's financial problems.

9
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,409
So is this everything? Yep.

10
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:26,039
- Gaby got the truth.
- I got involved with a bad guy.

11
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,310
- You're not talking about Nick, are you?
- No, Danny's father...

12
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:30,880
a really bad guy.

13
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,440
Grab whatever you can
stuff in a couple of bags.

14
00:00:34,441 --> 00:00:36,200
Not without you. I'll send Danny.

15
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,979
And Angie faced her worst fear.

16
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,120
- Are you gonna kill me?
- Can we discuss it in the morning?

17
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,879
And if you decide to run
away, say good-bye to Nick,

18
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,530
because he won't be around
much longer after you've gone.

19
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,440
Angie Bolen was having trouble sleeping.

20
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,800
She kept dreaming about her life

21
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,040
and the choices she had made.

22
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:14,120
After all, it was her decision
to drop out of college.

23
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:21,890
It was her idea to join
a group of eco-terrorists.

24
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:26,980
She let herself fall in love...

25
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,220
with their charismatic leader.

26
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,640
And she agreed to build him a bomb.

27
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,760
Angie knew her choices had been bad ones.

28
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,700
How else could she have ended up here...

29
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,270
With a man she despised?

30
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:55,980
Good mornin'.

31
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,280
How long you been sittin' there?

32
00:01:58,790 --> 00:01:59,620
For a while.

33
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:03,140
I've been admiring your scar.

34
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,230
It is so beautiful.

35
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:10,560
What are you doing? You should be proud.

36
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,250
It's a symbol of what we accomplished.

37
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,530
We killed a guy. I'm not so proud.

38
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,380
What's one life compared to the planet?

39
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,220
What we did was noble.

40
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:22,220
Tell that to his wife.

41
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,050
When did you stop loving me?

42
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,800
Was it while we were still together,

43
00:02:31,801 --> 00:02:34,640
or was it after Nick took you from me?

44
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,070
My wrist hurts.

45
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,040
Uncuff me.

46
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,800
Answer the question.

47
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,570
I never loved you.

48
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,750
That's a lie.

49
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,240
In fact, I'm thinkin' there's
a good chance that you still do.

50
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:53,880
Don't touch me.

51
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,440
Maybe if we made love, you'd remember.

52
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,229
We could, but you might not like it

53
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,820
when I vomit into your mouth.

54
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,400
You do realize I could kill you.

55
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,950
But you won't,

56
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,450
'cause you need me for somethin'.

57
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,810
That's true.

58
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,450
Well... don't just keep me in suspense.

59
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,430
Tell me.

60
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,610
You're gonna make me another bomb.

61
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,390
You can never make me do that.

62
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:33,160
Yes, Angie Bolen had made a
lot of bad choices in her life.

63
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,460
You're gonna be surprised
by what I can make you do.

64
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,980
And she now had no choices left.

65
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:00,590
Detective John Booth was not happy.

66
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,230
You see,

67
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:07,520
someone had been killing
women in the town of Fairview,

68
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,870
and he hadn't a clue as to who it was.

69
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:14,459
For months,

70
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,090
he had pored over autopsy photos...

71
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,640
read psychological profiles...

72
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,540
and interviewed witnesses...

73
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:31,710
But Detective Booth was still
no closer to finding the killer.

74
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,610
Until one day...

75
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:37,790
Booth speaking.

76
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,390
Really?

77
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,930
Yeah. Okay. We'll be right there.

78
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,149
- What's up?
- Some kids came across a woman's body

79
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,080
buried in the woods.

80
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,130
Strangled?

81
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,600
We'll find out.

82
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,950
Forensics is over there
right now digging her up.

83
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,090
Hey, Eddie. We need to talk.

84
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,820
Did I do something wrong?

85
00:05:05,821 --> 00:05:09,080
No. I went to your house to see your mom.

86
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,030
You did?

87
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:13,720
Why?

88
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,529
I wanted to ask her to
come to therapy with you.

89
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,580
Dr. McCarthy thought it might be helpful.

90
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,710
What did she say?

91
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,559
Actually, she wasn't there.
I don't want to worry you,

92
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,690
but her neighbor said no
one has seen her for days.

93
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,080
Look...

94
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,589
I'm sure that must sound
like a big deal to you,

95
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:40,190
but this has been going on my whole life.

96
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,620
She's off on another bender,

97
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,270
and in a week or two,

98
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:45,930
she'll come back,

99
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,320
like nothing ever happened.

100
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,210
So we don't need to call anyone?

101
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,070
You think she's okay?

102
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:58,570
Yeah. It's only a matter
of time before she turns up.

103
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,350
Okay, my plane's in an hour.

104
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,719
I wish you weren't gonna
be gone for your birthday.

105
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,310
The girls are gonna be so disappointed.

106
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,870
The commission on this
deal is worth 40 grand.

107
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,440
I will dry their tears with dollar bills.

108
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,440
Bon voyage.

109
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,070
And don't worry, I'll have
your favorite dinner waiting.

110
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,639
That's okay, babe.

111
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,530
We can just go out to
dinner and celebrate.

112
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:27,330
- But I make you lasagna every year.
- I know.

113
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,050
I just don't want you to have
to go through all the trouble.

114
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:29,900
That's all.

115
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,150
I gotta go. Hold it!

116
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,460
You do like my lasagna, don't you?

117
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,440
Sure, I do.

118
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,630
- Liar
-! Excuse me?

119
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:48,349
- You were doing that thing you do when you lie.
- What thing?

120
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,820
Oh, like I'm gonna tell
you. I don't believe this.

121
00:06:50,821 --> 00:06:53,750
You've been eating my
lasagna for 11 years.

122
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,120
- Actually, the ficus in the dining room has been eating it.
- What?

123
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,690
But on the bright side, it's thriving.

124
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,769
- So you're saying I make great mulch?
- Look,

125
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,600
I just never wanted to hurt your feelings.

126
00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:07,720
- Until today.
- Well, I've gotten older.

127
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,550
My stomach's gotten weaker.

128
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,020
Look, I'm sorry, baby.

129
00:07:11,021 --> 00:07:13,030
You just don't make it
the way mamÃ¡ used to.

130
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,770
That's because your backstabbing mother

131
00:07:14,771 --> 00:07:17,280
didn't have the decency to give
me the recipe before she died.

132
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,939
She was run over by a car!

133
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,290
Well, isn't that convenient?

134
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,210
Look, lasagna's a tough dish.

135
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,010
But I love your guacamole.

136
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,190
- I buy that at the store.
- Like only you can.

137
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,870
So... figure out my financial mess yet?

138
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,719
I've been going over these
invoices for three days,

139
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,220
and I'm confused.

140
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,350
The payments don't cover
half of what you've billed.

141
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,019
Well, that's 'cause not everybody's paid.

142
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:46,680
Why not?

143
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,520
They don't have the money.

144
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,350
Times are tough.

145
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:53,669
A lot of my customers are struggling

146
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:54,500
just to make ends meet.

147
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:58,140
Wish I knew what that
was like. Oh, wait. I do.

148
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,380
They'll pay when they can.

149
00:08:00,381 --> 00:08:05,490
Honey, I love that I married a guy who
wants to unclog the world's toilets for free.

150
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,260
But now it's time the people
pay the piper for the pipes.

151
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:12,849
It's not that easy. I've
known these people for years.

152
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,170
I can't just go shake 'em down.

153
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:16,580
You're right.

154
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:18,500
I'll do it.

155
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:22,400
You? Hey... how are you gonna do it?

156
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,860
Look at me. Big brown
eyes, quivering lips.

157
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,000
Once I tell them how our
life is falling apart,

158
00:08:28,001 --> 00:08:29,500
trust me, they'll pay.

159
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:32,120
No, Susan, this will never work.

160
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,210
Fine.

161
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,630
But I don't know what we're gonna do.

162
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,610
Uh, we barely have enough money
to pay our bills this month.

163
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:46,710
The insurance is due.

164
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,420
And God forbid M.J. get in an accident.

165
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,829
Susan, sweetie, it's gonna be okay.

166
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:55,920
Still don't think it'll work?

167
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:00,220
- Wow. You're scary.
- Can I go get our money?

168
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:01,920
Be my guest.

169
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:07,120
Hey, hey! Last year, when
I wanted to go fishing,

170
00:09:07,121 --> 00:09:09,269
but you wanted to go
skiing and you started

171
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,689
crying... I think it's
best we don't discuss that

172
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,670
until we're out of this financial crisis.

173
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,919
I'm not scared of Sam.

174
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,519
If you're afraid to fire him, I'll do it.

175
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,999
No! I don't want to provoke him.

176
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,320
The man is clearly troubled.

177
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,670
And there's no telling
how violent he could get.

178
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,140
Well, we're not
intimidated. Are we, Orson?

179
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,440
Just how violent are we talking?

180
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,910
Hey, we'll do whatever
it takes to protect mom.

181
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:34,609
Okay. But I am in a chair.

182
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,039
I don't know how good I'd be in a fight.

183
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,980
This thing tips over in a stiff wind.

184
00:09:37,981 --> 00:09:40,660
Don't worry, Orson. We'll
think of something else.

185
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,230
What are you doing?

186
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,480
- Did that hurt?
- No.

187
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:49,230
Well, that's all I got.

188
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,919
You don't need to fight, Orson.

189
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,310
You're more of a strategist.

190
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,499
O... okay, fine. We don't want to fight.

191
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,110
Why don't we hire someone to rough him up?

192
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,970
I know a couple ex-marines.

193
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,250
- How do you know any...
- Don't ask.

194
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,820
- Hey, what about money?
- What about it?

195
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,349
Well, if we can't fire
Sam or scare him away,

196
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,569
maybe he'll respond to cash.

197
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:12,730
Yes, he's always talking about how
he never had anything growing up.

198
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,149
I think, one little severance package,

199
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,520
and we could be rid of this problem.

200
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:19,100
Oh, brilliant idea, Orson.

201
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:21,940
You call writing a check "brilliant"?

202
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,470
Anything?

203
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,800
Sorry.

204
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,880
- Mrs. Scavo?
- Yeah?

205
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,470
I'm Detective Booth.
This is Detective Furst.

206
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:39,590
Can we come in?

207
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:42,030
Sure. What's this about?

208
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,460
Do you know an Irina Kosokov?

209
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:47,449
Oh, unfortunately, yeah.

210
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,260
And whatever you think she did, she did.

211
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,380
I'm sorry?

212
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,830
She's a conniving, manipulative little
grifter who put my son through hell.

213
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,040
She's dead.

214
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,980
What? Are you serious?

215
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,910
We found her body earlier today.

216
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,210
She was murdered.

217
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,190
What's going on?

218
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,640
Uh... these are policemen.
It's about Irina.

219
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,810
Oh, boy. That didn't take long.

220
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,869
- Tom...
- That little bitch couldn't even get out of the country

221
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,350
- before she...
- She's dead.

222
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,060
Was taken from us too soon.

223
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,840
Is your son Preston home?

224
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,870
No, he's camping with his brother.

225
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:26,310
But thank you so much for coming
by. He's gonna be devastated.

226
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:27,910
Actually, we're gonna need to talk to him.

227
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,430
Wait. You don't think he
had anything to do with this?

228
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,620
We found a letter that Ms.
Kosokov had written to him.

229
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:36,950
Sounds like things ended
pretty badly between them.

230
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,939
Well, yeah, he broke off the engagement.

231
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,719
But he wouldn't do that and then kill her.

232
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,659
It's an extra step.

233
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,779
Wouldn't you just skip the breakup
and get right to the killing?

234
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,849
Why won't you stop talking?

235
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,020
I want to, believe me.

236
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,150
Just get him in as soon as you can.

237
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:53,170
- Sure. I'll call him right now.
- Thank you.

238
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,700
I'm telling you,

239
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,800
there's no way Preston
could have hurt that girl.

240
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:03,360
You guys should concentrate
on finding the real killer.

241
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,320
Oh, don't worry. We'll find him.

242
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,080
Brings back memories, huh?

243
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,030
I'm not doing this.

244
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,860
I don't expect you to start today.

245
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,670
I'm still waiting on one more piece.

246
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:31,770
It's not gonna happen.

247
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,910
Angie, there's this development in Oregon.

248
00:12:33,911 --> 00:12:36,719
They're planning to clear-cut
4, 000 acres of old growth.

249
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,400
- We gotta stop them.
- And who cares if we

250
00:12:38,401 --> 00:12:40,470
kill a few loggers in the process, right?

251
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,010
Saving the world's messy.

252
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,220
You used to be able to see that.

253
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,020
You know what I see now? A fake.

254
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,090
What?

255
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,090
You're a phony.

256
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,359
The only cause you
ever believed in is you.

257
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,820
I'm trying to save the planet!

258
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,620
Oh, God. You still have that ego.

259
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,900
I was trying to save you, too!

260
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,680
Oh, well, thanks for
caring, but Nick saved me,

261
00:12:59,681 --> 00:13:02,030
and he showed me what
a coward you really are.

262
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:05,870
Do you really wanna start talking
about Nick right now, huh?!

263
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,590
God, how does it feel,

264
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:12,180
knowing you'll never
be half the man he is?

265
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,640
Angie, open up. It's Gaby.

266
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,080
She won't go.

267
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:19,960
I'm not going. I see your car.

268
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,720
You've got one minute to get rid of her,

269
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,650
or there's gonna be one less
neighbor at the block party.

270
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:32,500
Come on in.

271
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,510
Hey. I need a lasagna
recipe for Carlos. Hi.

272
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:39,350
Hi. I'm Anthony, Angie's brother.

273
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:41,150
Oh, you never told me you had a brother.

274
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,730
I'm sure she hasn't
told you lots of things.

275
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,070
Uh, what kind of lasagna does Carlos like?

276
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,130
- Meat? Vegetarian?
- Have you seen Carlos?

277
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,410
What's all this? Somebody kill a toaster?

278
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:56,150
Angie's fixing my remote control,

279
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,620
giving it a little extra power.

280
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:00,630
You know how to do that?

281
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,380
Sure.

282
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:04,230
She was an engineering major in college.

283
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:08,180
Well, you know, I have an appliance at
home that could use some extra power.

284
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,510
And once I get to know you
better, I'll tell you which one.

285
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:14,340
Got that recipe yet?

286
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:18,040
- Here you go.
- Oh, thanks. What does this say?

287
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,660
Ten fresh tomatoes.

288
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,850
Can't I just use sauce from a jar?

289
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,430
No, you can't just use sauce from a jar!

290
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,389
You're right. No one will
ever know the difference.

291
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,940
- See you later.
- Nice meeting you.

292
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,039
Oh, and a little word of advice...

293
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,619
never compare your
wife to your dead mother

294
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,060
if you wanna get laid on your birthday.

295
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,910
You know how to make a bomb and
you haven't used one on her yet?

296
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,430
I admire your restraint.

297
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:49,420
You wanted to see me, Bree?

298
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,450
I did. Please, have a seat.

299
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:57,199
Did you know that Rex set up

300
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:01,329
- a trust fund for Andrew and Danielle?
- No, I didn't.

301
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:04,019
Well, he wanted to be sure
they had a nest egg to draw from

302
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,840
in case something happened
to him, which it did.

303
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,350
Why are you telling me all this?

304
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:12,510
Well, Rex set up two trust funds.

305
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,090
He seems to have forgotten
he had three children,

306
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,020
and that's not right.

307
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,120
That's a lot of money.

308
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:34,170
Well, it's my way of apologizing
for my husband's... poor memory.

309
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,759
I never expected anything
like this. Thank you.

310
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,810
You're very welcome.

311
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,759
And I hope you know how
much I have appreciated

312
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,090
the time you spent with
us and the work you did.

313
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,970
Truly, I wish you the very best.

314
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,940
That sounds like a good-bye.

315
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:00,119
Well, now that you have all this money,

316
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,540
you don't need to work here.

317
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,300
A young man with your
skills should feel free

318
00:16:03,301 --> 00:16:05,560
to go out into the
world and make his mark.

319
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,580
But I like it here.

320
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,579
Well, unfortunately, I no longer need you.

321
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,120
You see, Andrew and I have made up,

322
00:16:12,121 --> 00:16:14,460
and I'm giving him your job.

323
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,180
What?

324
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,310
Don't be angry.

325
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:20,740
This is, after all, a family business.

326
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,850
But I'm part of the family.

327
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,800
Not... really.

328
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,240
What are you doing?

329
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,420
You can't buy me off.

330
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:41,880
I belong here.

331
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,230
I'm a Van De Kamp.

332
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,200
And if you ever insult me again...

333
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:51,210
You're gonna wish you hadn't.

334
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,150
Excuse me. Are you Jake Walker?

335
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,320
Yeah.

336
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,100
Hi. I'm Susan Delfino,
your plumber's wife.

337
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:11,379
Oh, hey. Yeah, Mike's, uh,
done us a few solids over here.

338
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,110
He's a good man.

339
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:16,019
Yes, and a proud man, which
is why he hasn't told you

340
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,890
that his business is really hurting.

341
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,620
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

342
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,950
So we're gonna need you to pay your bill,

343
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,619
uh, for the work he
completed... four months ago.

344
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,260
Yeah...

345
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:28,710
I wish I could, but, uh, it's a bad time.

346
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,060
You okay?

347
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:39,900
Oh, I'm sorry.

348
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:43,450
It's just, we're having a bad time, too.

349
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,920
We can't cover our bills,

350
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,550
and the health insurance is due.

351
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,760
And God forbid...

352
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,130
our son get in an accident.

353
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,550
Yeah, well, I wouldn't worry.

354
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:58,980
Kids bounce back.

355
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:04,340
"Kids bounce back"? That's your response?

356
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,659
Look, my wife lost her job.

357
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,349
My truck needs a new transmission.

358
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:12,089
- Well, maybe we could set up a payment... 
- My daughter needs braces.

359
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,110
- Even if it's just small...
- Nifit...

360
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:19,040
Nifit? Th... that's not an
excuse. That's just a sound.

361
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,559
Look, lady, I don't know how to tell you.

362
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,410
I don't have the money, okay?

363
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,480
So just leave me alone.

364
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,050
No, I'm not gonna leave you alone.

365
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:35,340
You owe me money, and I'm
not gonna rest until I get it.

366
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:38,900
I am gonna make sure everyone in your
life knows what a deadbeat you are.

367
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,970
When you go to work
tomorrow, I'll be there.

368
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,510
When you go bowling with
your buddies, I'll be there.

369
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:46,719
And when you go to your video
store to get your porn, I'll...

370
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,240
Okay, okay. I'll write you a check.

371
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:56,770
Thank you.

372
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:05,690
So with the price of college
tuition being what it is,

373
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,540
and my mother had that
gallbladder operation,

374
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,690
well, we're just a little
tapped out at the moment.

375
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,250
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

376
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:17,930
But Mike did repipe your
entire second floor, didn't he?

377
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,980
Yes. And I want to pay,

378
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,100
but we just don't have the money.

379
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:25,940
Oh, that's too bad.

380
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,570
These are awfully cute.

381
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,190
Yes.

382
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,450
My husband gives me one
every year on our anniversary.

383
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,790
They're my babies.

384
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,549
Aw, that's so sweet.

385
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:41,720
Please be careful. I don't
like it when people touch them.

386
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,390
Oh, well, you know what I don't like?

387
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:47,150
I don't like when people
take advantage of my husband.

388
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,210
It makes me feel all...

389
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,770
clumsy.

390
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:54,930
I guess I could maybe pay you half.

391
00:19:59,441 --> 00:20:02,242
The whole thing. Let me get my wallet.

392
00:20:02,277 --> 00:20:05,612
We'll be waiting!

393
00:20:05,647 --> 00:20:07,915
I know I'm late in paying
for the water heater,

394
00:20:07,949 --> 00:20:09,450
but I'm on a fixed income.

395
00:20:09,484 --> 00:20:12,386
There just isn't any money
left at the end of the month.

396
00:20:12,387 --> 00:20:15,389
I mean, for me to even
pay for my medicines

397
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:18,525
I've had to cut down to two meals a day.

398
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,628
S-so even though I'd
like to help, I can't.

399
00:20:21,663 --> 00:20:23,097
I've got nothing.

400
00:20:23,131 --> 00:20:27,101
You got a nice watch.

401
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,006
Damn right, "wow!" No cereal
for dinner tonight, baby!

402
00:20:45,007 --> 00:20:48,604
Mrs. Crowley... paid!
Jim Peterson... paid!

403
00:20:48,605 --> 00:20:52,444
And the ones that couldn't
pay, I took it in booty.

404
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,029
A clock?

405
00:20:56,387 --> 00:20:56,940
Earrings.

406
00:20:56,941 --> 00:20:58,154
A menorah?

407
00:20:58,155 --> 00:20:59,716
Sterling silver.

408
00:21:00,262 --> 00:21:03,796
Hey, Mrs. Gottleib has a toilet
that flushes, doesn't she?

409
00:21:05,201 --> 00:21:07,783
What happened to batting your
eyes and shedding a few tears?

410
00:21:07,907 --> 00:21:11,846
Playing the victim got me nowhere.

411
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,079
Everybody had an excuse, and I bought it.

412
00:21:14,163 --> 00:21:18,042
And then, all of a sudden, I snapped.

413
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:21,293
Rage just started pouring out of me.

414
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,344
It was like my inner
bully had been released.

415
00:21:24,414 --> 00:21:29,191
And one by one, I brought
the deadbeats to their knees!

416
00:21:29,192 --> 00:21:32,090
For the first time in my life,

417
00:21:32,169 --> 00:21:34,480
I have gotten a taste of
power. And you know what?

418
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:36,669
I like it.

419
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:38,695
You do know that's not a twist-off?

420
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,635
Yes! Ow! That hurts.

421
00:21:41,868 --> 00:21:43,708
I can't tell you what a rush it is

422
00:21:43,763 --> 00:21:46,562
to have this adrenaline
pouring through me.

423
00:21:49,631 --> 00:21:50,650
Hey, I have an idea.

424
00:21:50,715 --> 00:21:53,430
Let's go upstairs right
now and have bully sex.

425
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,504
- Susan...
- I said now!

426
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:57,689
We can't.

427
00:21:57,756 --> 00:22:01,048
Why not? I want to celebrate.

428
00:22:01,106 --> 00:22:03,351
I brought home all this money today.

429
00:22:03,394 --> 00:22:05,773
We're getting closer and
closer to the finish line.

430
00:22:07,971 --> 00:22:08,903
Well...

431
00:22:08,967 --> 00:22:12,501
The I.R.S. just moved the finish line.

432
00:22:15,594 --> 00:22:17,124
Oh, my God.

433
00:22:17,192 --> 00:22:19,556
I know. We're screwed.

434
00:22:21,586 --> 00:22:23,126
You know what?

435
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:26,684
Old victim Susan might
have agreed with you, but...

436
00:22:28,601 --> 00:22:32,682
New bully Susan is not
gonna take this lying down.

437
00:22:34,831 --> 00:22:36,753
The way I see it,

438
00:22:36,754 --> 00:22:39,114
the I.R.S. is a government agency,

439
00:22:39,115 --> 00:22:43,358
and the government only exists
because of the taxes that we pay.

440
00:22:43,406 --> 00:22:45,261
So that makes me your boss.

441
00:22:45,348 --> 00:22:48,500
And as your boss, I am telling
you that we need an extension.

442
00:22:48,564 --> 00:22:50,114
Do I make myself clear?

443
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:01,352
I am a terrible bully.

444
00:23:01,427 --> 00:23:03,684
Yes. Yes, you are.

445
00:23:03,767 --> 00:23:05,987
He didn't have to tack on
all those extra penalties.

446
00:23:06,053 --> 00:23:08,154
- Did you know they could do that?
- Yeah.

447
00:23:08,216 --> 00:23:11,858
- See, I didn't, or I never would have...
- Yeah, I figured.

448
00:23:13,701 --> 00:23:15,400
So what do you think we should do?

449
00:23:15,498 --> 00:23:17,572
I don't know.

450
00:23:17,674 --> 00:23:21,090
Between the taxes and the rest
of the bills, we're still screwed.

451
00:23:22,066 --> 00:23:24,175
We got nothing to fall back on.

452
00:23:39,786 --> 00:23:41,594
We've got the house.

453
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:47,847
Sam.

454
00:23:47,921 --> 00:23:49,871
Good. You're here. Come on in.

455
00:23:51,745 --> 00:23:54,239
I thought you wanted to go
over the quarterly inventory.

456
00:23:54,304 --> 00:23:56,556
Yes, but then some old friends dropped by.

457
00:23:56,598 --> 00:24:01,642
Sam Allen, I would like you to meet
Detective Turner and Sergeant Clemente.

458
00:24:01,749 --> 00:24:04,683
So... you're policemen.

459
00:24:04,745 --> 00:24:07,854
Used to be. Bree catered
our retirement parties.

460
00:24:07,915 --> 00:24:09,476
And did an amazing job.

461
00:24:10,647 --> 00:24:12,807
Boy, do we owe her big.

462
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,113
Sam, have a seat. Have some tea.

463
00:24:16,183 --> 00:24:18,041
No, thanks. I'm not really a big tea guy.

464
00:24:18,114 --> 00:24:19,183
Oh, come on. Take a load off.

465
00:24:19,247 --> 00:24:21,788
We got, uh, we got room here on the couch.

466
00:24:25,804 --> 00:24:29,781
So... the officers were
just sharing some stories

467
00:24:29,836 --> 00:24:31,960
from their days on the force.

468
00:24:32,025 --> 00:24:33,767
Tell him the one you just told me.

469
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:36,043
About the guy who was
hassling the nice lady?

470
00:24:36,098 --> 00:24:38,838
Yes. Sam, listen to this.

471
00:24:38,908 --> 00:24:40,669
This guy was so crafty,

472
00:24:40,723 --> 00:24:43,119
knew just what to say to scare the lady

473
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:44,715
without technically breaking the law.

474
00:24:44,769 --> 00:24:47,430
Yeah, our hands were
tied. Nothing we could do.

475
00:24:47,508 --> 00:24:51,066
That must have been so frustrating. Scone?

476
00:24:51,158 --> 00:24:54,458
Thanks. Oh, it was very frustrating.

477
00:24:54,532 --> 00:24:57,535
Of course, if we encountered
the same situation today,

478
00:24:57,608 --> 00:25:00,055
we'd handle it very differently.

479
00:25:00,129 --> 00:25:01,471
Oh? How?

480
00:25:01,548 --> 00:25:03,470
Well, we'd sit him down for a nice chat.

481
00:25:03,525 --> 00:25:05,342
And, uh, if he wouldn't listen to reason,

482
00:25:05,416 --> 00:25:09,555
then there are... measures we could take.

483
00:25:11,549 --> 00:25:13,970
Ooh. Sounds like a Mickey Spillane novel.

484
00:25:14,041 --> 00:25:15,255
What kind of measures?

485
00:25:16,108 --> 00:25:17,406
Well...

486
00:25:18,214 --> 00:25:19,643
You mind?

487
00:25:21,043 --> 00:25:25,390
You pick up a phone book, aim
for the Adam's apple... boom!

488
00:25:29,061 --> 00:25:30,313
Let your fingers do the walking.

489
00:25:30,402 --> 00:25:32,741
Or... or... or here. Help me out here.

490
00:25:32,818 --> 00:25:36,672
You, uh, dislocate those two fingers

491
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,584
and smack him on the hand.

492
00:25:38,643 --> 00:25:40,358
Pop 'em back in.

493
00:25:40,447 --> 00:25:41,854
And there's no evidence.

494
00:25:44,443 --> 00:25:47,150
Goodness. It's hard to believe
you'd actually do such a thing.

495
00:25:47,234 --> 00:25:50,861
Well, if I had to. I mean,
if the situation came up,

496
00:25:50,928 --> 00:25:52,202
I would hope that the...

497
00:25:52,967 --> 00:25:55,017
threat would be enough.

498
00:25:55,779 --> 00:25:57,126
Absolutely.

499
00:26:03,414 --> 00:26:04,972
Sam, you're looking a little pale.

500
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,006
Would you like some more
tea or perhaps a macaroon?

501
00:26:08,992 --> 00:26:10,935
No. I...

502
00:26:11,006 --> 00:26:14,634
Think... I... should be going.

503
00:26:14,717 --> 00:26:16,805
Hey, do you want us to give you a ride?

504
00:26:16,894 --> 00:26:22,077
I mean, we go right past 474 Ash Street.

505
00:26:23,363 --> 00:26:25,424
I'm good.

506
00:26:30,966 --> 00:26:34,499
I don't know why tea parties
have fallen out of fashion.

507
00:26:34,575 --> 00:26:36,390
They're so much fun.

508
00:26:40,414 --> 00:26:44,403
Okay, Porter. Do what you can to
keep your brother's spirits up.

509
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,061
Drive safely.

510
00:26:46,175 --> 00:26:48,778
I... yeah, I'll see you soon. 

511
00:26:49,811 --> 00:26:51,867
Hey, uh, Mrs. Scavo.

512
00:26:53,588 --> 00:26:54,629
What's with the backpack?

513
00:26:55,618 --> 00:26:57,253
Yeah, I've been thinking
that it might be good

514
00:26:57,321 --> 00:26:59,497
if I move back home for a little while.

515
00:26:59,563 --> 00:27:01,011
Why?

516
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,565
Irina's dead.

517
00:27:03,614 --> 00:27:05,889
Your family needs time to deal with that.

518
00:27:05,975 --> 00:27:08,078
You don't need me hanging
around, getting in the way.

519
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:10,793
To be honest, I already
think of you as family.

520
00:27:11,942 --> 00:27:13,238
C... come on.

521
00:27:13,302 --> 00:27:14,953
I've only been here a couple of weeks.

522
00:27:14,992 --> 00:27:19,104
Your first morning here, you asked
if you could take out the trash.

523
00:27:19,105 --> 00:27:22,028
Believe me, you were in my
will by 3:00 that afternoon.

524
00:27:23,885 --> 00:27:27,088
Seriously, I think you should stay.

525
00:27:28,739 --> 00:27:30,184
I want to, but...

526
00:27:30,267 --> 00:27:33,809
my mom's gonna be back
from her bender any day now,

527
00:27:33,886 --> 00:27:35,001
and I should be there.

528
00:27:35,665 --> 00:27:38,737
Oh. That's so sweet of you.

529
00:27:39,369 --> 00:27:41,052
Your mom's lucky to have a son like you.

530
00:27:41,811 --> 00:27:44,355
You know...

531
00:27:44,434 --> 00:27:46,639
once you make sure she's okay,

532
00:27:46,709 --> 00:27:48,777
you can always come back.

533
00:27:50,725 --> 00:27:53,389
I don't think that's gonna happen.

534
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:56,276
Is something wrong?

535
00:27:56,355 --> 00:27:58,219
D... did you not like it here?

536
00:27:58,286 --> 00:28:00,668
No. No, it was fantastic.

537
00:28:02,761 --> 00:28:04,477
I should just go. That's all.

538
00:28:04,541 --> 00:28:08,755
Okay. Well, can I give
you a hug good-bye?

539
00:28:18,666 --> 00:28:20,556
I can't help thinking,

540
00:28:21,556 --> 00:28:24,334
I would've turned out so
different if you were my mom.

541
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:44,009
What do you mean you're
moving off the Lane?

542
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,655
You can't sell your house.

543
00:28:45,722 --> 00:28:47,431
We're not selling. We're renting.

544
00:28:47,479 --> 00:28:50,690
I don't care. Either way,
you're not gonna be living here.

545
00:28:50,765 --> 00:28:52,153
Lynette, say something.

546
00:28:52,217 --> 00:28:54,600
You're very persuasive.

547
00:28:54,667 --> 00:28:57,790
I... I don't understand
why you have to do this.

548
00:28:58,874 --> 00:29:01,537
Well, we dug ourselves in
pretty deep financially.

549
00:29:02,466 --> 00:29:03,856
We'll be fine.

550
00:29:03,943 --> 00:29:05,505
It's just gonna be for a while.

551
00:29:06,791 --> 00:29:09,169
Checkbooks.

552
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:11,292
No, no.

553
00:29:11,368 --> 00:29:14,283
I love you for that, but no.

554
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:17,465
We got ourselves into this.
We can get ourselves out.

555
00:29:17,548 --> 00:29:18,940
Where will you go?

556
00:29:19,025 --> 00:29:21,456
We found an apartment near the school.

557
00:29:21,518 --> 00:29:23,304
And there's a park around the corner.

558
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:26,430
And it's close by, so we'll
still be able to see each other.

559
00:29:28,689 --> 00:29:29,802
I hope so.

560
00:29:29,876 --> 00:29:31,992
'Cause people always say that and then...

561
00:29:32,052 --> 00:29:35,503
Well, I mean it.

562
00:29:36,478 --> 00:29:37,933
So do we.

563
00:30:13,582 --> 00:30:14,749
Ma?

564
00:30:14,819 --> 00:30:17,040
Danny? What are you doing here?

565
00:30:17,112 --> 00:30:19,051
What are you talking about?

566
00:30:19,106 --> 00:30:21,561
You texted me. You told me to hurry home.

567
00:30:21,623 --> 00:30:24,393
Oh, God, that wasn't me.
Danny, get out of the house now.

568
00:30:25,355 --> 00:30:27,053
What's going on?

569
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:30,139
Just go, Danny. Go.

570
00:30:30,852 --> 00:30:32,575
What's the rush?

571
00:30:36,763 --> 00:30:39,292
Remember that piece I said was missing?

572
00:30:41,455 --> 00:30:43,337
It just arrived.

573
00:30:52,722 --> 00:30:54,639
So I've been thinking...

574
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:58,686
What are you doing here?

575
00:30:59,356 --> 00:31:01,570
You know, about what your cop friends said

576
00:31:01,624 --> 00:31:03,853
about how effective threats can be.

577
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,659
I think they're right.

578
00:31:06,308 --> 00:31:07,981
Get out.

579
00:31:08,055 --> 00:31:08,784
I will,

580
00:31:08,847 --> 00:31:11,485
but not before we do a little business.

581
00:31:12,286 --> 00:31:14,248
What kind of business?

582
00:31:14,335 --> 00:31:17,038
I want you to sign
over your company to me.

583
00:31:17,874 --> 00:31:18,846
What?

584
00:31:18,896 --> 00:31:21,539
I'm talking about your catering clients,

585
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,796
your cookbooks, the frozen food line...

586
00:31:23,797 --> 00:31:25,176
all of it.

587
00:31:25,827 --> 00:31:28,606
Why would I do that?

588
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:32,673
Remember the dinner you threw
to welcome me to the family?

589
00:31:32,743 --> 00:31:36,784
Well, Danielle had a
little too much to drink.

590
00:31:36,849 --> 00:31:38,221
I hear that's genetic.

591
00:31:38,289 --> 00:31:40,910
Anyway, she got pretty chatty.

592
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:44,716
Kept asking me why I wanted to
join a family with so many secrets.

593
00:31:45,748 --> 00:31:47,704
Uh, what did she tell you?

594
00:31:47,787 --> 00:31:50,525
The same thing I'm gonna
tell some of my cop friends.

595
00:31:50,592 --> 00:31:53,535
Oh, and while I'm at it,

596
00:31:53,609 --> 00:31:55,665
I should probably tell Carlos Solis, too.

597
00:31:57,412 --> 00:31:59,907
I don't know what you're talking about.

598
00:32:02,529 --> 00:32:05,238
I'm talking about Andrew,

599
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,225
your son,

600
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,713
getting into a car

601
00:32:08,772 --> 00:32:11,356
and running down Carlos' mother.

602
00:32:14,061 --> 00:32:17,476
So should we draw up the
papers now or wait till morning?

603
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,624
It's a lot to take in, I know.

604
00:32:28,288 --> 00:32:29,650
I don't believe you.

605
00:32:29,719 --> 00:32:31,525
Look, I'm just trying to let you know

606
00:32:31,595 --> 00:32:33,071
that when you're ready,

607
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:36,936
I want us to have a traditional
father-son relationship.

608
00:32:39,009 --> 00:32:40,679
Are you serious?

609
00:32:43,147 --> 00:32:44,022
I know.

610
00:32:44,851 --> 00:32:46,246
That sounded ridiculous.

611
00:32:46,332 --> 00:32:48,308
And I'm sorry I had to tie you up.

612
00:32:48,397 --> 00:32:50,321
Believe me, this is not
how I wanted this to happen.

613
00:32:51,532 --> 00:32:53,672
But I have something important to do.

614
00:32:53,727 --> 00:32:55,503
Once I'm done, I'll untie you,

615
00:32:55,555 --> 00:32:57,560
and we'll have time to
get to know each other.

616
00:32:57,608 --> 00:32:59,602
If you ever untie me, I'll kill you!

617
00:33:00,925 --> 00:33:04,055
You're mad. I get it.

618
00:33:08,014 --> 00:33:10,171
But eventually, you
realize who you're mad at.

619
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:14,930
It's not the guy who spent
20 years looking for you.

620
00:33:15,766 --> 00:33:19,016
It's the people who spent
20 years lying to you.

621
00:33:29,922 --> 00:33:31,923
What did you say to Danny?

622
00:33:31,989 --> 00:33:34,501
Just a father/son chat.

623
00:33:34,568 --> 00:33:36,379
I swear, if you ever hurt him...

624
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:38,797
God, everybody makes me
sound like such a villain.

625
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,124
So...

626
00:33:42,185 --> 00:33:44,254
how's my bomb coming?

627
00:33:45,195 --> 00:33:47,422
It would go a lot faster
if could use two hands.

628
00:33:53,301 --> 00:33:54,628
Well, we are on a deadline.

629
00:33:57,083 --> 00:33:58,611
Hello?

630
00:33:58,694 --> 00:34:00,644
Not her again.

631
00:34:00,728 --> 00:34:02,402
I come bearing gifts.

632
00:34:04,779 --> 00:34:06,697
Hello?

633
00:34:07,572 --> 00:34:09,964
You've got 20 seconds to
get her the hell outta here.

634
00:34:12,428 --> 00:34:16,817
Hey. Sorry to barge in,
but I did a test run,

635
00:34:16,881 --> 00:34:18,916
- and I really need your opinion.
- Now?

636
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:21,084
Yeah. This has to be the
best lasagna in the world,

637
00:34:21,136 --> 00:34:23,406
so when I shove it down Carlos'
throat, he'll know I care.

638
00:34:23,452 --> 00:34:26,427
She'll try it later.
Thanks for stopping by.

639
00:34:27,209 --> 00:34:28,775
Oh, I'm not going.

640
00:34:29,744 --> 00:34:31,281
She won't go.

641
00:34:31,342 --> 00:34:33,156
- Mnh-mnh.
- Let me just cut a piece.

642
00:34:33,231 --> 00:34:36,289
Two seconds. 'Cause don't
forget, Danny's waiting for you.

643
00:34:37,115 --> 00:34:39,369
Be right back, Gaby.

644
00:34:49,549 --> 00:34:53,597
Well, I can tell you this
much, it smells great.

645
00:34:56,367 --> 00:34:57,316
Oh, come on.

646
00:34:58,122 --> 00:35:00,954
This is my first magazine cover.

647
00:35:01,031 --> 00:35:03,468
Ooh. And this is me when I did "Vogue."

648
00:35:03,542 --> 00:35:05,569
Oh, that's my daughter Juanita.

649
00:35:05,623 --> 00:35:07,319
I don't know how that got in there.

650
00:35:07,406 --> 00:35:10,808
And now the runway years.

651
00:35:12,038 --> 00:35:14,776
Angie! You're keeping your friend waiting.

652
00:35:16,901 --> 00:35:18,906
Be right there.

653
00:35:32,151 --> 00:35:34,801
Oh, jeez. You scared the crap outta me.

654
00:35:34,884 --> 00:35:36,965
I'm about to kill your neighbor.

655
00:35:37,029 --> 00:35:38,647
You might want to get her outta here.

656
00:35:43,054 --> 00:35:45,155
Gaby, I gotta hand it to
you. You did a great job.

657
00:35:45,229 --> 00:35:46,945
Really? You're not just saying that?

658
00:35:47,002 --> 00:35:49,624
Oh, fantastic. But would you
mind taking the rest back?

659
00:35:51,864 --> 00:35:53,845
I'm just trying to watch my weight.

660
00:35:57,522 --> 00:35:58,805
I get it.

661
00:35:58,894 --> 00:36:01,651
You're trying to cut
out all the crappy food.

662
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:09,457
Did Mrs. Bolen like the lasagna?

663
00:36:09,527 --> 00:36:12,489
Well, she said she did, and then
she pretended she was on a diet.

664
00:36:16,096 --> 00:36:18,036
Well, I guess I can take a hint.

665
00:36:31,757 --> 00:36:34,159
Honey, do you really
think this is the time

666
00:36:34,193 --> 00:36:36,127
to be cleaning out your purse?

667
00:36:36,162 --> 00:36:38,650
Our son is being interrogated for murder.

668
00:36:38,733 --> 00:36:40,010
I have a lot of rage in me.

669
00:36:40,068 --> 00:36:42,470
Would you rather I channel
it into this or you?

670
00:36:43,294 --> 00:36:46,824
I'd put the emergency
tampon in the zipper pouch.

671
00:36:46,889 --> 00:36:48,262
Thank you.

672
00:36:52,273 --> 00:36:54,638
Pres, how'd it go?

673
00:36:54,703 --> 00:36:57,881
They just wanted to confirm the
timeline I was in Europe this past year.

674
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:58,960
That's it?

675
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,810
I guess they think the guy
who killed all those girls

676
00:37:01,856 --> 00:37:04,116
while I was gone is the
same one who strangled Irina.

677
00:37:04,176 --> 00:37:06,839
Oh, thank God. So you're free and clear?

678
00:37:07,928 --> 00:37:11,975
- You okay?
- I just keep thinking, Irina would still be alive

679
00:37:12,024 --> 00:37:13,350
if I hadn't brought her here.

680
00:37:15,083 --> 00:37:17,293
I'll meet you at the car.

681
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:18,536
Sweetie, when...

682
00:37:18,596 --> 00:37:22,097
Mom, let him go. This whole
thing has really hit him hard.

683
00:37:22,155 --> 00:37:24,042
How about Porter and I take him out,

684
00:37:24,104 --> 00:37:25,872
shoot a few games of pool,
see if he wants to talk?

685
00:37:25,957 --> 00:37:28,599
Okay. I'll see you back at home.

686
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:40,503
Did you hear they found a
second body in the woods?

687
00:37:40,565 --> 00:37:42,217
They think it's some local woman...

688
00:37:42,285 --> 00:37:43,837
Barbara Orlofsky.

689
00:37:43,902 --> 00:37:46,377
Orlofsky? Isn't that that woman

690
00:37:46,435 --> 00:37:48,708
we throw in the drunk
tank about once a month?

691
00:37:48,781 --> 00:37:50,227
That's her.

692
00:38:03,179 --> 00:38:05,328
Oh, my God! What are you doing?

693
00:38:05,425 --> 00:38:08,482
- We were hungry.
- So you picked it out of the trash?

694
00:38:08,566 --> 00:38:10,595
You're worse than raccoons.

695
00:38:11,984 --> 00:38:13,015
Sorry.

696
00:38:13,643 --> 00:38:16,073
Well, since you had
some, what'd you think?

697
00:38:19,286 --> 00:38:21,207
Oh, yeah? Well, the French toast
you made me for mother's day

698
00:38:21,271 --> 00:38:22,497
wasn't so hot either.

699
00:38:26,916 --> 00:38:28,634
What the heck is that?

700
00:38:44,272 --> 00:38:46,679
- Eddie.
- Mrs. Scavo.

701
00:38:47,834 --> 00:38:49,074
What are you doing here?

702
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:54,245
Oh, sweetie...

703
00:38:55,784 --> 00:39:00,425
Oh, look, I know you're worried she's
passed out drunk somewhere in an alley,

704
00:39:00,426 --> 00:39:02,448
but you can relax. I just spoke to her.

705
00:39:03,348 --> 00:39:06,493
You just... spoke to her?

706
00:39:06,568 --> 00:39:08,766
Yeah, like, a half-hour ago.

707
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:11,194
Uh, she's at my Uncle Pete's in Florida.

708
00:39:13,049 --> 00:39:14,712
In fact, I... I was...

709
00:39:14,792 --> 00:39:17,265
I was just getting ready
to fly down there...

710
00:39:17,335 --> 00:39:19,175
and... we're gonna...

711
00:39:19,236 --> 00:39:21,813
try to check her into rehab.

712
00:39:22,608 --> 00:39:24,565
So if you don't mind...

713
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:28,469
Oh, thank God. They must
have gotten the name wrong.

714
00:39:32,025 --> 00:39:34,795
What are you talking about?

715
00:39:39,029 --> 00:39:40,932
Well, I was just at the
police station with Preston.

716
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:44,634
They found another body, and
they said it was your mom's.

717
00:39:52,358 --> 00:39:54,387
But...

718
00:39:55,741 --> 00:39:58,767
you just talked to her, right?

719
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:00,708
They made a mistake.

720
00:40:16,127 --> 00:40:17,876
You didn't just talk to her.

721
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,928
And your mom's not in Florida, is she?

722
00:40:24,862 --> 00:40:27,566
I really wish you hadn't come here.

723
00:40:30,039 --> 00:40:33,988
People make choices every day.

724
00:40:36,465 --> 00:40:38,136
And those choices... 

725
00:40:39,092 --> 00:40:41,065
are what define us.

726
00:40:45,523 --> 00:40:48,894
Some of us choose to be loyal,

727
00:40:48,974 --> 00:40:51,387
though we're angry and hurt.

728
00:40:56,419 --> 00:40:59,154
Some of us choose to be brave,

729
00:40:59,231 --> 00:41:02,034
though we're frightened out of our minds.

730
00:41:05,804 --> 00:41:08,456
Others choose to strike out

731
00:41:08,544 --> 00:41:11,027
when they could have walked away.

732
00:41:13,496 --> 00:41:15,807
But what about those poor people

733
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,643
who are trapped by circumstance?

734
00:41:19,828 --> 00:41:21,986
What happens to those

735
00:41:22,859 --> 00:41:25,397
who have no choices left?

736
00:41:25,398 --> 00:41:35,398
