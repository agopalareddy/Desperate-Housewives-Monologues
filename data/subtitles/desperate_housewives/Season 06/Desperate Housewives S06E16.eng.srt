1
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:05,709
All right. I love you.
There, I said it.

2
00:00:05,709 --> 00:00:07,820
Feelings were stated boldly.

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,820
I think it's time for me to give up on man.

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,534
A romantic suggestion was made.
Date chicks?

5
00:00:16,337 --> 00:00:19,038
And a plan was hatched...
He wants to represent you.

6
00:00:19,073 --> 00:00:22,093
Aah! they want you in
new york immediately.

7
00:00:22,127 --> 00:00:25,559
To break up a romance...
This is a huge opportunity.

8
00:00:25,594 --> 00:00:28,160
The best part is she is miles
away from the nearest bolen.

9
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:30,768
But young love couldn't be stopped.

10
00:00:35,991 --> 00:00:38,499
Since she'd become a mother,

11
00:00:38,533 --> 00:00:42,242
Gabrielle solis had
learned many things--

12
00:00:42,276 --> 00:00:46,010
How to get gum off
a remote control...

13
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:50,647
How to rescue a doll
from the disposal...

14
00:00:50,681 --> 00:00:55,587
And where to find
disappointing report cards.

15
00:00:55,621 --> 00:00:57,352
Gabrielle had also learned

16
00:00:57,386 --> 00:01:00,053
That no matter how
hard she tried...

17
00:01:00,088 --> 00:01:01,554
Cereal again?

18
00:01:01,588 --> 00:01:03,789
She couldn't please everyone.

19
00:01:03,823 --> 00:01:06,790
Yes, another free meal you
didn't have to work for.

20
00:01:06,825 --> 00:01:09,892
It's tough being 7.
Celia, get down here!

21
00:01:09,926 --> 00:01:11,793
Ana used to make us bacon.

22
00:01:11,827 --> 00:01:13,261
I miss her.

23
00:01:13,295 --> 00:01:16,263
Yeah, well, she also used to
do the laundry and the windows,

24
00:01:16,297 --> 00:01:19,465
So I miss her more.
Celia, the milk is poured!

25
00:01:19,899 --> 00:01:22,767
Oh, I need cupcakes
for school today.

26
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:24,369
Today? How many?

27
00:01:24,403 --> 00:01:25,804
Mom!

28
00:01:25,838 --> 00:01:27,974
Three dozen.

29
00:01:28,008 --> 00:01:30,778
Why didn't you tell
me this last night?

30
00:01:30,812 --> 00:01:33,282
I forgot. We got any ham?
I need meat.

31
00:01:33,317 --> 00:01:36,318
Babe, are you gonna pick up
my suit from the dry cleaners?

32
00:01:36,352 --> 00:01:39,288
Yes, after I fold the laundry,
fry up some ham

33
00:01:39,323 --> 00:01:41,825
And pull three dozen
cupcakes out of my ass!

34
00:01:41,859 --> 00:01:43,827
Mom! what?!

35
00:01:43,862 --> 00:01:46,397
My face itches.

36
00:01:46,432 --> 00:01:49,167
What are those, mosquito bites?

37
00:01:49,201 --> 00:01:51,904
Whoa. That looks like chicken pox.

38
00:01:51,938 --> 00:01:55,241
No. No! no! no! I don't
have time for sick kids!

39
00:01:55,275 --> 00:01:58,704
Forget the dry cleaning.
You gotta take her to the doctor.

40
00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:01,152
Oh, god. What do you do for chicken pox?
I've never had ' of the house.

41
00:02:03,004 --> 00:02:04,920
Why? You can't go
anywhere near her.

42
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,308
If you've haven't had them,
you're not immune.

43
00:02:06,308 --> 00:02:08,672
In fact, you gotta get out of here.
Honey, celia is sick.

44
00:02:08,825 --> 00:02:10,320
Chicken pox is dangerous
for adults. Go.

45
00:02:10,321 --> 00:02:11,928
I have to do the laun

46
00:02:11,962 --> 00:02:14,564
I will take care of the house.

47
00:02:14,998 --> 00:02:19,773
Yes, gabrielle had learned
many things as a mother.

48
00:02:19,869 --> 00:02:21,736
The most important...

49
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,437
See ya.

50
00:02:23,472 --> 00:02:28,073
Was to get while the
getting was good.

51
00:02:38,109 --> 00:02:40,272
Seduction--

52
00:02:40,306 --> 00:02:43,507
Any soap opera fan will tell you,

53
00:02:43,542 --> 00:02:46,143
It's an art best practiced...

54
00:02:46,177 --> 00:02:47,977
Stop.

55
00:02:48,012 --> 00:02:51,513
...On those who are vulnerable.

56
00:02:51,548 --> 00:02:52,914
Hey there.

57
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:54,549
You hungry?

58
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,384
Oh, I am now.

59
00:02:56,418 --> 00:02:58,652
What's that amazing smell?

60
00:02:59,954 --> 00:03:03,789
Uh, cinnamon brioche french toast.

61
00:03:03,824 --> 00:03:06,792
Oh, but I probably shouldn't.
You're such an amazing cook.

62
00:03:06,826 --> 00:03:11,028
I'm already having trouble
fitting into my clothes.

63
00:03:11,062 --> 00:03:12,830
Oh. Uh...

64
00:03:12,864 --> 00:03:15,265
You need some maple syrup.

65
00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:19,134
Oh, seriously,
you heated the syrup?

66
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,837
You're unbelievable.

67
00:03:26,574 --> 00:03:30,409
You should eat it
while it's still...

68
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:31,710
Hot.

69
00:03:44,655 --> 00:03:46,656
Look.

70
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:49,491
I just got syrup all over me.

71
00:03:49,526 --> 00:03:52,027
I don't know what it is with me.

72
00:03:52,061 --> 00:03:54,262
I just... Have to get dirty.

73
00:03:54,296 --> 00:03:56,597
You...

74
00:03:56,631 --> 00:03:58,632
Got some on your bra, too.

75
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,967
Oh.

76
00:04:18,382 --> 00:04:20,150
I'll get it.

77
00:04:22,885 --> 00:04:25,653
Please. It's wrong.

78
00:04:25,688 --> 00:04:28,688
Then why does it feel so right?

79
00:04:30,191 --> 00:04:32,124
Katherine? You up yet?

80
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:35,259
Oh, good. I was calling,
but you didn't hear me.

81
00:04:35,293 --> 00:04:38,294
I think you feel
asleep with the tv on.

82
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:43,898
So what would you
like for breakfast?

83
00:04:43,932 --> 00:04:47,200
Anything but french toast.

84
00:04:47,235 --> 00:04:49,736
Oh, I don't think you'll
be here that long.

85
00:04:53,506 --> 00:04:55,073
I got it.

86
00:04:55,107 --> 00:04:59,543
I got the perfect
name for the baby.

87
00:04:59,577 --> 00:05:01,344
Patricia.

88
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:03,379
Let me think about it.

89
00:05:03,414 --> 00:05:04,680
No.

90
00:05:04,715 --> 00:05:05,948
Wh--

91
00:05:05,983 --> 00:05:08,784
Why not? It's a great name.

92
00:05:08,818 --> 00:05:12,354
I told you, I want to honor my aunt.
We're naming her polly.

93
00:05:12,388 --> 00:05:13,821
Polly?

94
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:16,791
Okay, you get a peg leg,
I'll get an eye patch,

95
00:05:16,825 --> 00:05:19,626
And we'll carry her
around on our shoulders.

96
00:05:22,096 --> 00:05:25,030
Morning, penny. Oh, hey, baby.

97
00:05:25,064 --> 00:05:28,199
Mwah. Where are my pancakes?

98
00:05:28,233 --> 00:05:30,434
Oh, sweetie, I've got
a lot going on today.

99
00:05:30,468 --> 00:05:32,244
I'll make you
pancakes this weekend.

100
00:05:32,245 --> 00:05:34,267
But I always get pan

101
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:38,536
That's... Right.

102
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,938
You do.

103
00:05:40,972 --> 00:05:42,572
But...

104
00:05:42,606 --> 00:05:46,141
We... Have... An even bigger treat

105
00:05:46,175 --> 00:05:48,776
Planned for you this year. Yeah.

106
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,077
What?

107
00:05:51,678 --> 00:05:55,581
Like I'm gonna tell ya
and ruin the big sprise!

108
00:05:55,615 --> 00:05:57,427
How could you forget
her birthday? Me?

109
00:05:57,428 --> 00:05:59,287
I'm pregnant. I forget

110
00:05:59,355 --> 00:06:00,856
What's your excuse?

111
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,557
What's my surprise?

112
00:06:04,493 --> 00:06:06,826
What the hell are we gonna do?

113
00:06:06,861 --> 00:06:08,894
Cover me. I'm going in.

114
00:06:12,897 --> 00:06:15,898
Birthday breakfasts...

115
00:06:15,933 --> 00:06:17,399
Are for kids.

116
00:06:17,434 --> 00:06:20,468
Now that you're 11,

117
00:06:20,503 --> 00:06:23,437
I was planning to make you...

118
00:06:23,471 --> 00:06:26,139
The best...

119
00:06:26,174 --> 00:06:29,644
Birthday... Dinner ever,

120
00:06:29,678 --> 00:06:33,482
With decorations...

121
00:06:33,517 --> 00:06:36,586
Tons of presents...

122
00:06:38,322 --> 00:06:40,458
Pin the tail on the...

123
00:06:40,492 --> 00:06:42,560
You forgot my birthday.

124
00:06:42,594 --> 00:06:44,061
Wow.

125
00:06:48,132 --> 00:06:50,934
There was no covering that, babe.

126
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:56,238
You're twice the man he is.

127
00:06:57,607 --> 00:06:59,040
What's raymundo gonna say

128
00:06:59,075 --> 00:07:01,809
When he finds out tiffany's
sleeping with his brother?

129
00:07:03,378 --> 00:07:05,212
Alas, you'll never know.

130
00:07:05,246 --> 00:07:08,014
Oh, hey, mom. We-
-we were just taking a break.

131
00:07:08,049 --> 00:07:09,549
So I gathered.

132
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,743
If you don't mind, tad, I'd like to

133
00:07:13,753 --> 00:07:16,154
In private, tad.

134
00:07:16,189 --> 00:07:18,590
Oh! so you want me to--

135
00:07:18,624 --> 00:07:21,025
Be anyplace else but here, right.

136
00:07:23,829 --> 00:07:26,063
Uh, so--so what's up?

137
00:07:26,097 --> 00:07:27,497
There's a truck outside

138
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:29,063
With the flower arrangements we

139
00:07:29,064 --> 00:07:30,498
ordered for the

140
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,300
All 100 of them.

141
00:07:32,334 --> 00:07:35,502
Wait. But we only ordered ten.
That's what I said.

142
00:07:35,537 --> 00:07:37,971
Then the delivery man
showed me this invoice.

143
00:07:38,005 --> 00:07:40,506
At first I wasn't sure if
that was tad's signatur

144
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,841
But when I saw that his
name was misspelled...

145
00:07:42,876 --> 00:07:44,976
I knew it was him.

146
00:07:45,011 --> 00:07:46,561
Uh, would you like
me to talk to him?

147
00:07:46,562 --> 00:07:48,112
No. I would like you

148
00:07:48,147 --> 00:07:50,280
While I strike him with
a large wooden spoon.

149
00:07:50,315 --> 00:07:52,482
Whatever. I-i'll take care of it.

150
00:07:52,516 --> 00:07:55,251
What are you going to say to him?

151
00:07:55,285 --> 00:07:57,553
Look, when--when orson
had his accident,

152
00:07:57,587 --> 00:07:59,799
Did you or did you not
put me in charge? Yes,

153
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,257
but I am starting to
thinou're gonna have to learn

154
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:05,159
Look... I'm never gonna
figure this job out

155
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,146
Unless you let me make
mistakes and learn from them.

156
00:08:07,147 --> 00:08:08,762
I realize that,
andrewour control issues,

157
00:08:08,796 --> 00:08:10,963
Mom, I know you have
your control issues,

158
00:08:10,998 --> 00:08:13,265
But when stuff happens,
you're gonna have to learn

159
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,334
To just relax and--and let me
clean up my own messes, okay?

160
00:08:16,369 --> 00:08:19,771
Hey, where do you want all
these flower arrangements?

161
00:08:22,874 --> 00:08:24,374
Oops.

162
00:08:24,409 --> 00:08:25,842
No problem, tad.

163
00:08:25,877 --> 00:08:29,212
As luck would have it,
we've got extra.

164
00:08:31,381 --> 00:08:33,582
Mmm!

165
00:08:33,616 --> 00:08:37,552
Roy, we've got guests.
You can watch your soap later.

166
00:08:37,587 --> 00:08:39,954
Come on, roy.

167
00:08:39,989 --> 00:08:42,790
Well, again, thank you for
inviting us over to brunch.

168
00:08:42,825 --> 00:08:45,359
Everything looks delicious.
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

169
00:08:45,393 --> 00:08:46,794
Right, karen?

170
00:08:46,828 --> 00:08:49,029
You know what I want.

171
00:08:49,063 --> 00:08:53,700
When company comes over,
I get to use salt.

172
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:55,835
Roy's on a low-sodium diet.

173
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:59,638
"no sodium" is code for "
tastes like socks."

174
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:03,708
So sue me 'cause I don't
want you dropping dead.

175
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,143
Listen to you two.

176
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:08,913
You sound like a sweet,
old married couple.

177
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:12,849
So... Have you ever thought

178
00:09:12,884 --> 00:09:15,718
Of making an honest
woman out of karen?

179
00:09:18,964 --> 00:09:20,198
What are you doing

180
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:23,414
Oh. I just want them to
be as happy as we are.

181
00:09:23,473 --> 00:09:24,759
Uh, we're happy.

182
00:09:25,109 --> 00:09:28,046
Living in sin suits us just fine.

183
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,921
Is that how karen els?

184
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:33,367
Susan, why don't you,
uh, try this frittata?

185
00:09:34,692 --> 00:09:37,359
Karen don't care about marrge.

186
00:09:37,359 --> 00:09:38,836
Do you, pumpkin?

187
00:09:40,344 --> 00:09:41,249

188
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:43,139

189
00:09:43,965 --> 00:09:45,829

190
00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:48,184

Of coue she's seous.

195
00:10:03,209 --> 00:10:05,657
Oh, my god! This is so romantic.

196
00:10:07,491 --> 00:10:09,567
Karen, will you...

197
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,585
Son of a bee.

198
00:10:10,585 --> 00:10:12,868
There's the battery
to my hearing aid.

199
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:16,669
Okay, okay.

200
00:10:17,304 --> 00:10:20,795
Karen... do you wanna marry me?

201
00:10:22,712 --> 00:10:25,993
Golly, I don't know what to say.
This is all so sudden.

202
00:10:26,651 --> 00:10:28,582
Answer. My knee hurts.

203
00:10:30,292 --> 00:10:32,621
Would love to marry you, roy.

204
00:10:37,644 --> 00:10:38,591
Yes!

205
00:10:43,587 --> 00:10:45,149
@@@@@le of days,

206
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:46,742
Why'd she bring three suitcases?

207
00:10:46,742 --> 00:10:49,159
She said most of her dresses
haven't had chicken pox either.

208
00:10:50,411 --> 00:10:51,291
Oh!

209
00:10:51,341 --> 00:10:53,622
That... was amazing.

210
00:10:53,675 --> 00:10:56,008
I just took a nap in
the middle of the day.

211
00:10:57,225 --> 00:10:58,833
Guess it's a little
different without kids, huh?

212
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,019
Oh, you kidding me?

213
00:11:00,072 --> 00:11:02,232
I haven't taken a nap
since juanita crowned.

214
00:11:02,699 --> 00:11:04,685
Okay, you just created a
visual that is Forbidden

215
00:11:04,685 --> 00:11:06,762
inside these walls.
Try to watch that.

216
00:11:06,812 --> 00:11:09,029
Here. You're just in time
for pre-dinner cosmos.

217
00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:10,992
In a crystal glass?

218
00:11:11,192 --> 00:11:15,004
Mm. Oh! Celia broke our
last one six months ago.

219
00:11:15,004 --> 00:11:18,129
I've been drinking my cocktails
out of a scooby-doo sippy cup.

220
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,668
Mmm! I'm in heaven.

221
00:11:21,718 --> 00:11:24,414
Mmm. So it's movie night.
Have you seen this?

222
00:11:24,467 --> 00:11:27,033
Does it have a talking penguin
or a dog that plays basketball?

223
00:11:27,033 --> 00:11:28,999
No, just gratuitous sex and
lots of violence. Yay! Art!

224
00:11:29,015 --> 00:11:30,191
Ahh!

225
00:11:38,974 --> 00:11:40,711
Uh-oh. Somebody's glass is empty.

226
00:11:40,726 --> 00:11:43,245
That's also forbidden
inside these walls.

227
00:11:43,588 --> 00:11:44,275
Oh!

228
00:11:45,457 --> 00:11:47,392
I know I don't know you
guys that well, but...

229
00:11:48,092 --> 00:11:49,117
I love you.

230
00:11:54,943 --> 00:11:56,322
Oh, wow.

231
00:11:56,322 --> 00:11:58,657
Are you okay? Oh, my god.

232
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:01,887
- Penny?
- All right, it's time for cake.

233
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,395
I got your favorite.

234
00:12:03,395 --> 00:12:04,416
Chocolate?

235
00:12:05,085 --> 00:12:06,595
I got your second favorite.

236
00:12:07,133 --> 00:12:08,972
- Mom?
- Yes?

237
00:12:09,237 --> 00:12:11,789
Uh, I have a date in half
an hour. Can I go now?

238
00:12:11,789 --> 00:12:13,363
No, you cannot go.

239
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:16,164
Preston's in europe.
Parker's at band practice.

240
00:12:16,164 --> 00:12:18,076
- You are representing all siblings.
- Mom--

241
00:12:18,076 --> 00:12:19,947
Don't you feel bad we
forgot her birthday?

242
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:22,138
I didn't forget. I gave her
a present this morning.

243
00:12:22,138 --> 00:12:25,012
So don't take it out on me that
you and dad failed as parents.

244
00:12:25,012 --> 00:12:28,133
Oh. We used up all our
good parenting on you.

245
00:12:28,133 --> 00:12:29,612
That's why you're so delightful.

246
00:12:29,612 --> 00:12:30,957
Okay.

247
00:12:30,957 --> 00:12:33,786
Here we go!

248
00:12:34,452 --> 00:12:35,527
Hee-hee!

249
00:12:35,938 --> 00:12:37,815
One, two, three--

250
00:12:37,815 --> 00:12:39,082
Who's polly?

251
00:12:45,322 --> 00:12:47,461
Oh, my god!

252
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:49,711
Erase, erase, erase.

253
00:12:50,233 --> 00:12:52,998
Sweetie, I am so sorry.

254
00:12:53,274 --> 00:12:54,869
You know, I don't
know if you know this,

255
00:12:54,869 --> 00:12:57,638
But pregnant women get
a little scattered.

256
00:12:57,638 --> 00:13:00,039
And then your dad and I were
talking about baby names,

257
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:02,642
And I got on the phone
with the bakery, and...

258
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,718
Which is clearly a terrible excuse,

259
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:08,379
And again, I am so sorry.
Let me fix this.

260
00:13:11,794 --> 00:13:14,072
Hey! That just made it worse,

261
00:13:14,072 --> 00:13:17,120
And how would you like a puppy?

262
00:13:17,518 --> 00:13:18,486
Forget it.

263
00:13:20,855 --> 00:13:23,127
But you haven't opened
your presents yet.

264
00:13:23,127 --> 00:13:24,792
Come back...

265
00:13:25,149 --> 00:13:25,772
Penny.

266
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:27,148
I know her name.

267
00:13:29,178 --> 00:13:30,915
The central bank thursday
raised interest rates...

268
00:13:30,915 --> 00:13:31,664
nick!

269
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:34,803
Yeah. What? What's going on?

270
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,282
Danny took off. Listen to this--

271
00:13:38,282 --> 00:13:41,007
"Didn't want to wake you.
Went camping with eddie.

272
00:13:41,007 --> 00:13:42,905
"Had to clear my head
about the whole ana thing.

273
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,097
P.S. Took my cell,
but doubt we'll have reception."

274
00:13:47,443 --> 00:13:48,347
Good for him.

275
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:51,073
Are you crazy?
He's never been by himself.

276
00:13:51,339 --> 00:13:54,079
He knows how to drink out of
a canteen and pee on a tree.

277
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,935
- I think he'll be fine.
- This isn't funny.

278
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:58,266
Look, should he have asked us?
Okay, yeah.

279
00:13:58,313 --> 00:13:59,671
But I think it's healthy.

280
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:03,356
Hey, better hiking with eddie

281
00:14:03,356 --> 00:14:05,454
Than alone in his room
with a bottle of pills.

282
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:09,365
I don't know.

283
00:14:09,413 --> 00:14:12,851
He's 19. Eventually,
we gotta let him live a normal life.

284
00:14:14,252 --> 00:14:16,578
He's never gonna
have a normal life.

285
00:14:16,578 --> 00:14:17,940
None of us will.

286
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:25,042
I realize the mistake
was ours, mr. Tan,

287
00:14:25,042 --> 00:14:25,980
But what am I supposed to do

288
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,374
With 90 extra floral arrangements?

289
00:14:28,856 --> 00:14:30,304
Well, it will be your problem

290
00:14:30,304 --> 00:14:32,136
If I stop doing business with you.

291
00:14:35,426 --> 00:14:37,269
Yes. What can I do for you?

292
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:39,510
Actually, the question
is what can I do for you?

293
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,416
I'm sorry. Did we
have an appointment?

294
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:44,157
No, but I've been wanting to
meet you for such a long time,

295
00:14:44,157 --> 00:14:45,261
And when I woke up this morning,

296
00:14:45,261 --> 00:14:46,755
I told myself today is the day.

297
00:14:46,755 --> 00:14:47,571
May I sit?

298
00:14:47,571 --> 00:14:50,266
No, no. Not just yet.
What is it you want, mister...

299
00:14:50,266 --> 00:14:51,888
Allen. Sam allen.

300
00:14:51,904 --> 00:14:54,358
I've been following your career
for a while now, mrs. Hodge.

301
00:14:54,358 --> 00:14:55,689
I've been to some
parties you've catered,

302
00:14:55,689 --> 00:14:56,702
And I've got your cookbook,

303
00:14:56,702 --> 00:14:58,432
I've read every interview
you've ever done,

304
00:14:58,432 --> 00:15:00,250
and I think you're quite amazing.

305
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,428
How nice. Now let's skip to
the part where you assure me

306
00:15:02,428 --> 00:15:04,273
That you're not some
deranged stalker.

307
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:07,058
Hardly. I want to work for you.

308
00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:09,176
Doing what?

309
00:15:09,222 --> 00:15:11,286
Anything. Everything.

310
00:15:13,023 --> 00:15:14,493
I'm very busy, mr. Allen.

311
00:15:16,784 --> 00:15:19,386
I worked as a sous-chef to put
myself through business school,

312
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:21,494
Where I graduated at
the top of my class.

313
00:15:21,494 --> 00:15:23,777
I know my way around a
kitchen and a calculator.

314
00:15:23,777 --> 00:15:27,669
And I'm not asking you to pay me
a lot of money, not yet anyway.

315
00:15:27,669 --> 00:15:29,713
I want to learn your
business from the ground up,

316
00:15:29,713 --> 00:15:32,162
And then I want to
help you expand it.

317
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,575
Really?

318
00:15:34,889 --> 00:15:38,376
You're a woman who has something
to say about traditional values,

319
00:15:38,376 --> 00:15:40,437
And I think our country's
ready to listen.

320
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:42,828
I am flattered...

321
00:15:43,653 --> 00:15:45,328
But I'm also fully staffed,

322
00:15:45,328 --> 00:15:48,940
And I honestly wouldn't know
how to use you. I'm sorry.

323
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:52,285
So am I.

324
00:15:54,543 --> 00:15:57,036
In regard to the extra
floral arrangements,

325
00:15:57,036 --> 00:15:58,658
You could donate them to a hospital

326
00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:01,419
And record the loss as a
charitable contribution.

327
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:03,509
And if you split the
arrangements in half,

328
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:05,076
You could double the
amount you claim.

329
00:16:05,995 --> 00:16:07,061
Just a thought.

330
00:16:09,933 --> 00:16:11,117
Mr. Allen?

331
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,332
Now you can sit.

332
00:16:19,206 --> 00:16:21,794
Hey. Where's your blushing bride?

333
00:16:21,843 --> 00:16:24,447
Upstairs in the can.
What do you want?

334
00:16:24,447 --> 00:16:26,661
Well, I thought I
would drop this off.

335
00:16:26,661 --> 00:16:28,065
It's a bouquet I found.

336
00:16:28,065 --> 00:16:29,841
Don't you think it'll
be perfect for karen?

337
00:16:29,841 --> 00:16:32,973
Haven't you done
enough already? Huh?

338
00:16:33,238 --> 00:16:36,225
We had a good thing going-
me and karen.

339
00:16:36,225 --> 00:16:39,604
Now 'cause of you, we're gonna
get married and ruin it.

340
00:16:40,456 --> 00:16:42,165
Getting married
isn't gonna ruin it.

341
00:16:42,165 --> 00:16:43,218
It's gonna make it better.

342
00:16:43,265 --> 00:16:45,994
No, it isn't. It's like salt.

343
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:47,377
What?

344
00:16:51,532 --> 00:16:54,792
All my life,
I never cared about salt,

345
00:16:54,792 --> 00:16:57,609
But when my doctor said I
couldn't have it anymore,

346
00:16:57,609 --> 00:16:59,755
I started craving it.

347
00:17:00,574 --> 00:17:01,857
Wait. Are, uh...

348
00:17:02,795 --> 00:17:04,377
You telling me that...

349
00:17:04,628 --> 00:17:06,804
You're gonna cheat on karen?

350
00:17:06,804 --> 00:17:09,657
I go to a stretching
class at the center.

351
00:17:09,885 --> 00:17:12,673
There's a lady with blue hair,
always sits in front of me.

352
00:17:12,673 --> 00:17:15,635
Six months she's been there.
I never gave a crap about her.

353
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:18,935
But this morning,
48 hours after you told me

354
00:17:18,935 --> 00:17:20,964
I had to propose to karen,

355
00:17:20,964 --> 00:17:22,970
I'm looking at ol' blue hair,

356
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:25,027
And I'm smacking my lips.

357
00:17:25,292 --> 00:17:26,737
Salt.

358
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:29,371
You're 80 years old, roy.

359
00:17:29,371 --> 00:17:30,519
Infidelity is...

360
00:17:31,132 --> 00:17:32,210
Dangerous.

361
00:17:32,257 --> 00:17:33,810
My body's 80,

362
00:17:33,826 --> 00:17:38,372
But inside, I'm still
a randy teenage boy.

363
00:17:38,372 --> 00:17:40,136
Susan, I'm telling ya,

364
00:17:40,153 --> 00:17:43,004
I have to kiss some other
women before I die.

365
00:17:43,004 --> 00:17:45,321
Well, you can't, so forget it.

366
00:17:45,321 --> 00:17:48,676
Just think about karen and
how much she loves you,

367
00:17:48,676 --> 00:17:51,859
And if you do that,
I'm sure you'll be able to resist

368
00:17:52,221 --> 00:17:54,163
Any inappropriate urges, okay?

369
00:18:01,071 --> 00:18:03,735
Yeah, that's the stuff.

370
00:18:12,989 --> 00:18:15,739
How is your wife
being molested funny?

371
00:18:15,787 --> 00:18:18,381
It was just a kiss from
an 80-year-old man.

372
00:18:18,381 --> 00:18:20,181
Well, it's too bad he
didn't grab my ass.

373
00:18:20,181 --> 00:18:21,650
You'd be rolling on the floor.

374
00:18:21,707 --> 00:18:23,038
What do you want me to do,
beat him up?

375
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:24,587
Take the tennis balls
off his walker?

376
00:18:24,587 --> 00:18:25,821
Okay, forget about me.

377
00:18:25,821 --> 00:18:27,725
What about what
he's doing to karen?

378
00:18:27,725 --> 00:18:29,309
I mean, they're about
to get married,

379
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:32,046
And he has no intention
of being faithful.

380
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:35,183
Because he feels trapped.
And whose fault is that?

381
00:18:35,183 --> 00:18:37,142
Don't point the mustard at me.

382
00:18:38,226 --> 00:18:39,533
Susan, I was there.

383
00:18:39,584 --> 00:18:41,637
You practically
forced him into this.

384
00:18:42,472 --> 00:18:44,411
Okay. I made a mistake.

385
00:18:44,465 --> 00:18:47,561
I didn't know that he was
some sort of jurassic gigolo.

386
00:18:47,561 --> 00:18:49,405
I have to tell karen
about this right now.

387
00:18:50,307 --> 00:18:52,236
No. You've meddled enough.

388
00:18:52,821 --> 00:18:55,635
Well, I can't let her marry him,
knowing what I know.

389
00:18:55,899 --> 00:18:57,522
Susan, he's having second thoughts.

390
00:18:57,522 --> 00:18:59,869
I mean, come on, there's
not a married man on earth

391
00:18:59,869 --> 00:19:02,161
Who didn't have second
thoughts before he got married.

392
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:04,347
Oh, really?

393
00:19:08,121 --> 00:19:08,842
Well...

394
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,447
Co--I didn't mean...

395
00:19:13,148 --> 00:19:14,252
Okay, I'm done.

396
00:19:15,648 --> 00:19:18,378
Mwah. See ya,
boys! Thanks for driving!

397
00:19:18,853 --> 00:19:20,948
Bye, gaby! Don't
forget to friend us!

398
00:19:20,948 --> 00:19:22,504
Oh, I won't, fernando.

399
00:19:22,504 --> 00:19:24,596
And good luck with
your pec implants.

400
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,454
All right, time for a nightcap.

401
00:19:33,454 --> 00:19:36,940
Oh, nightcaps! I'd forgotten
all about nightcaps.

402
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,676
Oh, I miss the gay single life.

403
00:19:38,676 --> 00:19:41,036
You know what? She deserves
the full experience.

404
00:19:41,036 --> 00:19:42,129
We're gonna throw you a party.

405
00:19:42,129 --> 00:19:44,728
Brilliant! I have mini
quiches in the freezer

406
00:19:44,728 --> 00:19:46,735
And ten homos on speed dial.
It's done.

407
00:19:46,735 --> 00:19:48,116
Oh! I'm so excited!

408
00:19:48,116 --> 00:19:49,995
Invite those guys from tonight...

409
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:52,228
Except fernando.
He's prettier than me.

410
00:19:53,704 --> 00:19:55,502
Hi. It's bob. * and lee

411
00:19:55,502 --> 00:19:56,621
Leave a message.

412
00:19:56,798 --> 00:20:00,189
Hey, guys. It's Carlos.
I'm looking for Gaby.

413
00:20:00,189 --> 00:20:02,159
The doctor says the girls
aren't contagious anymore,

414
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,591
so she can come home now. Thanks.

415
00:20:05,154 --> 00:20:06,330
Well, that's good news.

416
00:20:06,981 --> 00:20:09,086
What?! That is horrible news.

417
00:20:09,086 --> 00:20:11,162
My children are healthy. Damn it!

418
00:20:11,162 --> 00:20:12,314
But you can go home now.

419
00:20:12,314 --> 00:20:15,629
No, I'm not ready.
I'm just starting to remember

420
00:20:15,629 --> 00:20:17,353
What it's like to be human again--

421
00:20:17,353 --> 00:20:20,173
Sleeping in, not stepping on toys,

422
00:20:20,173 --> 00:20:22,577
Eating at restaurants
that don't have a slide.

423
00:20:22,577 --> 00:20:25,221
I have tasted freedom,
and I am not ready to give it up!

424
00:20:25,221 --> 00:20:27,007
But what are you gonna tell carlos?

425
00:20:29,926 --> 00:20:31,880
Oh, no. A stomach virus?

426
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:34,897
Yeah, when you called earlier,
i was throwing up.

427
00:20:34,897 --> 00:20:36,928
Well, we don't want
the girls to catch it.

428
00:20:37,971 --> 00:20:39,251
What's that noise?

429
00:20:41,217 --> 00:20:43,178
My teeth are chattering.

430
00:20:43,489 --> 00:20:45,699
Anyhow, I'll be home
as soon as I can.

431
00:20:45,699 --> 00:20:47,478
Doctor says it's a 24-hour thing.

432
00:20:47,478 --> 00:20:48,408
Don't forget the hangover.

433
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:50,428
Or 36-hour thing. Gotta go.

434
00:20:51,928 --> 00:20:53,449
Start pourin'.

435
00:20:53,465 --> 00:20:55,973
I said I was throwing up.
Don't want to be a liar.

436
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:05,411
I can hire whomever I want.
It's my company.

437
00:21:05,411 --> 00:21:07,735
And I run it for you.
I should have been consulted.

438
00:21:07,735 --> 00:21:09,548
Why are you being so
unpleasant about this?

439
00:21:09,548 --> 00:21:11,248
I hired sam to help you.

440
00:21:11,248 --> 00:21:12,295
I don't need his help.

441
00:21:12,295 --> 00:21:13,698
I've got it under control.

442
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:17,575
Andrew, all I've seen lately
is evidence to the contrary,

443
00:21:17,575 --> 00:21:18,803
And if you think I'm gonna stand by

444
00:21:18,803 --> 00:21:21,004
While everything I've
built falls apart...

445
00:21:23,232 --> 00:21:25,933
Sam. I thought you'd gone home.

446
00:21:25,933 --> 00:21:27,952
Oh, I stayed late to
finish the inventory.

447
00:21:27,952 --> 00:21:30,309
Well, aren't you industrious?

448
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:33,585
I also wanted to talk about tad.

449
00:21:34,011 --> 00:21:35,456
Uh, what about him?

450
00:21:35,456 --> 00:21:36,986
Every task I've given him

451
00:21:36,986 --> 00:21:38,794
He's either botched
or failed to finish.

452
00:21:38,794 --> 00:21:41,419
I think it's time
to cut our losses.

453
00:21:41,923 --> 00:21:43,579
We're-- we're not firing tad.

454
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:44,888
Why not? He's a moron.

455
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:47,133
He's a good guy,
and--and I don't want you

456
00:21:47,133 --> 00:21:48,985
Talking that way
about my employees.

457
00:21:48,985 --> 00:21:50,270
Andrew, you have to admit,

458
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:52,176
He's more than a
little incompetent.

459
00:21:54,077 --> 00:21:56,050
Give him a chance. He's just a kid.

460
00:21:58,573 --> 00:22:00,889
You're having an affair with him,
aren't you?

461
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:05,032
Sam! How could you
say such a thing?

462
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:08,500
I think the more
pertinent question is

463
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,233
Why isn't andrew denying it?

464
00:22:16,867 --> 00:22:19,800
Andrew, have you had sex with tad?

465
00:22:20,651 --> 00:22:22,567
Just once. Uh...

466
00:22:22,567 --> 00:22:24,322
Oh, my god.

467
00:22:24,367 --> 00:22:27,984
Well, he came on to me.
It was late, and I'd been drinking.

468
00:22:27,984 --> 00:22:30,151
That's your excuse?

469
00:22:30,151 --> 00:22:32,651
Honestly, andrew,
I am so disappointed in you.

470
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:34,718
Oh, really? Y-you want
to play that card?

471
00:22:34,718 --> 00:22:37,951
You're living with alex.
And you're married to orson.

472
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,151
Yeah, I know about karl mayer.

473
00:22:42,151 --> 00:22:44,267
Hello, pot. I'm kettle.
It's nice to meet you.

474
00:22:44,267 --> 00:22:45,628
I cannot believe you
would bring this up

475
00:22:45,628 --> 00:22:47,740
in front of a stranger.
Yeah, you know me.

476
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:50,611
Hypocrisy just makes
me forget my manners.

477
00:22:50,611 --> 00:22:52,278
Perhaps I should go.

478
00:22:52,278 --> 00:22:55,245
Yes. But I want you back
here bright and early

479
00:22:55,245 --> 00:22:56,765
Tomorrow morning to
help me fire tad.

480
00:22:56,765 --> 00:23:00,597
Y--no. No. You--you-
you can't fire him.

481
00:23:00,597 --> 00:23:02,163
Yes, I can.

482
00:23:02,163 --> 00:23:05,897
In fact, I can fire anyone I want.

483
00:23:18,426 --> 00:23:21,491
Taking off her bra,

484
00:23:21,491 --> 00:23:23,025
I woke up.

485
00:23:24,591 --> 00:23:27,491
What do you think that means?

486
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:29,426
Seems pretty straightforward.

487
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,458
But I'm not a lesbian.

488
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:35,225
You're getting ahead of yourself.

489
00:23:35,225 --> 00:23:37,558
Maybe this dream isn't
even about robin.

490
00:23:37,558 --> 00:23:40,426
Maybe it's about how
I've been so hurt by men

491
00:23:40,426 --> 00:23:43,292
That women are the
only safe option left.

492
00:23:43,292 --> 00:23:45,959
Why are you even thinking
about relationships at all,

493
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:47,725
With men or women?

494
00:23:47,725 --> 00:23:49,558
You're still fragile.

495
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:52,092
Now when you're stronger,

496
00:23:52,092 --> 00:23:55,658
Then we can talk about who
you might be attracted to.

497
00:23:55,658 --> 00:23:58,725
But I'm not attracted to her.
That's what I'm saying.

498
00:23:58,725 --> 00:24:01,591
Women my age don't
just wake up one day

499
00:24:01,591 --> 00:24:04,359
With a whole new sexual identity.

500
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:07,059
This dream has got to
mean something else.

501
00:24:07,059 --> 00:24:09,125
Well, what it tells me, clearly,

502
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:12,558
Is that you are being
distracted from your recovery.

503
00:24:12,558 --> 00:24:14,787
So what am I supposed to do,
stop dreaming?

504
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:16,587
No.

505
00:24:16,587 --> 00:24:18,114
But you might want to consider

506
00:24:18,114 --> 00:24:20,994
Asking robin to find
another place to stay.

507
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,425
This lettering is so small.
I can hardly read the label.

508
00:24:29,425 --> 00:24:30,520
All right, while you're deciding

509
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:34,026
Which one is dolphin-safe,
I'm gonna get some beer.

510
00:24:45,892 --> 00:24:49,026
Hey! Mrs. Bolen!

511
00:24:49,026 --> 00:24:51,425
I--do you shop here?

512
00:24:51,425 --> 00:24:54,259
Where's danny? He said you
guys were going camping.

513
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:56,559
Oh, yeah.

514
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:59,259
No, but h--I--
it turned out I couldn't go,

515
00:24:59,259 --> 00:25:02,358
So he just went... by himself.

516
00:25:04,725 --> 00:25:07,059
You wanna get in line?

517
00:25:07,059 --> 00:25:09,959
You wanna make me?

518
00:25:09,959 --> 00:25:11,525
Spill it.

519
00:25:11,525 --> 00:25:14,525
I'm sorry. He said he'd
call you when he got there.

520
00:25:14,525 --> 00:25:17,525
Eddie. Hey, you guys back already?

521
00:25:17,525 --> 00:25:19,625
So where is he really?

522
00:25:19,625 --> 00:25:21,330
New york.

523
00:25:21,857 --> 00:25:24,623
Danny went to find ana.

524
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:30,423
Hey. Hey.

525
00:25:30,423 --> 00:25:33,289
Don't freak out. It's a big city.

526
00:25:33,289 --> 00:25:35,256
What if he goes to
the old neighborhood?

527
00:25:35,256 --> 00:25:37,923
Patrick is not going to find him.

528
00:25:37,923 --> 00:25:41,124
He found us the last time.

529
00:25:41,124 --> 00:25:43,721
Come on. I gotta go pack.

530
00:25:56,705 --> 00:25:58,353
You're in early.

531
00:25:58,353 --> 00:25:59,852
Oh, I couldn't sleep,

532
00:25:59,852 --> 00:26:02,786
So I thought I'd review
our liability insurance,

533
00:26:02,786 --> 00:26:05,319
But I'm having a little
trouble focusing.

534
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:08,852
Maybe some coffee
will perk you up. Mm.

535
00:26:08,852 --> 00:26:11,553
Um, about what happened
yesterday, sam,

536
00:26:11,553 --> 00:26:14,753
That, um, ugliness with andrew--

537
00:26:14,753 --> 00:26:18,653
Driven, successful people like
you have complicated lives,

538
00:26:18,653 --> 00:26:21,419
But the specifics are
none of my business.

539
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:25,086
My, um...

540
00:26:25,086 --> 00:26:28,686
Relationship with andrew is,
uh, to say the least,

541
00:26:28,686 --> 00:26:30,219
Complicated.

542
00:26:30,219 --> 00:26:34,019
I'm sure andrew respects
and loves you very much.

543
00:26:34,019 --> 00:26:37,419
I just worry that...

544
00:26:37,419 --> 00:26:38,049
What?

545
00:26:38,049 --> 00:26:42,331
Well, it's not unusual for
children in a family business

546
00:26:42,331 --> 00:26:44,864
To have a sense of entitlement.

547
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:46,797
I hope you don't
mind me saying that.

548
00:26:46,797 --> 00:26:50,097
No. Go ahead.

549
00:26:50,097 --> 00:26:53,897
This must be so hard.
What do you do in this situation?

550
00:26:53,897 --> 00:26:56,997
Keep coddling him,
hoping he'll change,

551
00:26:56,997 --> 00:26:59,498
Or do you cut the apron
strings and trust

552
00:26:59,498 --> 00:27:03,131
That all the hard work you've
done will allow him to thrive?

553
00:27:03,131 --> 00:27:05,431
It's a good question.

554
00:27:05,431 --> 00:27:06,742
You know what?

555
00:27:06,742 --> 00:27:08,935
I've got everything
under control here.

556
00:27:08,935 --> 00:27:10,165
Why don't you go back to the house

557
00:27:10,165 --> 00:27:11,257
And catch up on your sleep?

558
00:27:11,257 --> 00:27:13,243
But there's so much
work to be done.

559
00:27:13,243 --> 00:27:15,623
Sure, but that's why you
hired me, isn't it--

560
00:27:15,623 --> 00:27:18,859
To help you out? Thank you, sam.

561
00:27:19,565 --> 00:27:22,098
You're very kind.

562
00:27:25,665 --> 00:27:27,592
And, sam?

563
00:27:28,864 --> 00:27:31,164
I'm very glad you're here.

564
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:03,964
Unh-unh!

565
00:28:03,964 --> 00:28:05,807
Hey, bert. I'm looking for penny.

566
00:28:05,807 --> 00:28:06,875
She didn't get off the bus.

567
00:28:06,875 --> 00:28:08,258
That's 'cause she didn't get on.

568
00:28:08,258 --> 00:28:11,897
I figured she went home
sick or something. What? No.

569
00:28:11,897 --> 00:28:14,458
She didn't come home sick.
Where is she? Penny?

570
00:28:14,458 --> 00:28:15,890
Mrs. Scavo?

571
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:18,091
Penny said to give you this.

572
00:28:21,057 --> 00:28:23,258
She's running away.

573
00:28:32,218 --> 00:28:35,086
Any ideas why she ran away?
Problems at home?

574
00:28:35,086 --> 00:28:38,819
No. No, everything's fine.

575
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:42,719
Well, we did kind of
forget her birthday.

576
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:48,752
And... she put the wrong
name on her birthday cake.

577
00:28:48,752 --> 00:28:50,194
Honey, could we please stick

578
00:28:50,194 --> 00:28:51,936
To the facts that
pertain to the case?

579
00:28:51,936 --> 00:28:54,036
How could you get your
daughter's name wrong?

580
00:28:56,253 --> 00:28:58,353
Are you people
involved in narcotics?

581
00:28:58,353 --> 00:29:00,520
No! No, I'm pregnant,

582
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,887
And it makes me very forgetful.

583
00:29:02,887 --> 00:29:05,787
Surely you can understand that.

584
00:29:05,787 --> 00:29:07,486
I'm not pregnant.

585
00:29:10,353 --> 00:29:12,853
You're not gonna look for
our daughter, are you?

586
00:29:16,865 --> 00:29:18,731
Aguilar.

587
00:29:18,731 --> 00:29:19,965
Yeah, they're still here.

588
00:29:19,965 --> 00:29:21,431
Oh, okay.

589
00:29:21,431 --> 00:29:25,198
Your daughter's fine.
She tried to use

590
00:29:25,198 --> 00:29:27,531
Your credit card to
check into a hotel.

591
00:29:30,198 --> 00:29:31,631
Hey.

592
00:29:34,316 --> 00:29:36,698
You mind if I come in?

593
00:29:44,098 --> 00:29:46,646
Wow. Marble bath,

594
00:29:46,646 --> 00:29:48,612
Flat screen,

595
00:29:48,612 --> 00:29:51,445
$8 can of peanuts.

596
00:29:51,445 --> 00:29:53,479
Nice.

597
00:29:55,379 --> 00:30:00,045
Sweetie, I am so
sorry about the cake

598
00:30:00,045 --> 00:30:02,878
And about forgetting your birthday.

599
00:30:08,012 --> 00:30:11,145
I know you hate me right now,
and I don't blame you.

600
00:30:11,145 --> 00:30:14,345
I don't hate you. I hate that.

601
00:30:18,445 --> 00:30:19,945
Oh.

602
00:30:22,145 --> 00:30:26,312
Because you're not gonna
be the baby anymore.

603
00:30:28,878 --> 00:30:33,145
Oh. Penny.

604
00:30:33,145 --> 00:30:35,112
Sweetie.

605
00:30:38,077 --> 00:30:39,979
You're missing the
big picture here.

606
00:30:39,979 --> 00:30:43,213
Preston's gone. Porter's next.

607
00:30:43,213 --> 00:30:46,079
When this girl comes along,
we are poised

608
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:49,647
To take control of the
house with a 3-2 majority.

609
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:52,113
Do you know what that means?

610
00:30:52,113 --> 00:30:55,946
Women get veto power over
what tv shows to watch,

611
00:30:55,946 --> 00:30:58,213
What takeout to get.

612
00:30:58,213 --> 00:30:59,779
Just think.

613
00:30:59,779 --> 00:31:03,313
Think of a world where the
toilet seat is never up.

614
00:31:03,785 --> 00:31:07,385
This is our time to take them down.

615
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,752
We're both gonna take them down!

616
00:31:12,752 --> 00:31:13,951
Hey.

617
00:31:13,951 --> 00:31:16,385
Oh.

618
00:31:16,385 --> 00:31:20,785
I'm sorry I ran away.

619
00:31:23,318 --> 00:31:25,318
We can go home now.

620
00:31:25,318 --> 00:31:28,051
I have a better idea.

621
00:31:28,051 --> 00:31:30,385
Since you already
paid for the room,

622
00:31:30,385 --> 00:31:32,685
How about we order
hot fudge sundaes...

623
00:31:32,685 --> 00:31:35,118
And spend the night?

624
00:31:36,458 --> 00:31:39,157
Just... just us girls.

625
00:31:39,157 --> 00:31:40,705
Yeah.

626
00:31:40,705 --> 00:31:43,405
Okay.

627
00:31:43,405 --> 00:31:45,004
You know, mom... hmm?

628
00:31:45,004 --> 00:31:48,971
If you have two more girls,
we'll take the lead.

629
00:31:48,971 --> 00:31:51,971
Let's just... order our sundaes.

630
00:31:53,605 --> 00:31:56,037
So there I was at this huge party,

631
00:31:56,037 --> 00:31:58,037
Flirting with this
middle eastern sheikh,

632
00:31:58,037 --> 00:31:59,772
And out of nowhere...

633
00:31:59,772 --> 00:32:01,012
He offers me a million

634
00:32:01,013 --> 00:32:03,605
dollars to sleep with him.
So what did you do?

635
00:32:03,605 --> 00:32:06,138
I slapped him.

636
00:32:06,138 --> 00:32:08,104
Apparently in the right place,

637
00:32:08,104 --> 00:32:11,071
'cause I walked out of
there with 20 grand.

638
00:32:11,071 --> 00:32:12,937
Shh. Gaby, it's juanita.

639
00:32:12,937 --> 00:32:14,438
Oh, excuse me, guys.

640
00:32:14,438 --> 00:32:16,805
Gotta do the "Mommie
dearest" Thing.

641
00:32:16,805 --> 00:32:19,772
Hi, sweetie. How was school?

642
00:32:19,772 --> 00:32:21,471
What?

643
00:32:21,471 --> 00:32:24,605
Oh, you scored a goal in soccer?

644
00:32:24,605 --> 00:32:27,371
What? Wh--hang on, sweetie,

645
00:32:27,371 --> 00:32:30,371
While I find a quiet place
so mommy can hear you.

646
00:32:35,671 --> 00:32:37,204
Hang on, sweetie.

647
00:32:39,104 --> 00:32:42,971
Okay, honey, mommy can...

648
00:32:48,838 --> 00:32:52,405
H-hold on, sweetie.

649
00:32:56,971 --> 00:32:59,471
Do the words "Wet paint"
Mean nothing to you?

650
00:32:59,471 --> 00:33:02,705
Uh, juanita? Honey,
I have to call you back. I love you.

651
00:33:02,705 --> 00:33:03,701
Sorry.

652
00:33:03,701 --> 00:33:05,968
I didn't mean to. I...

653
00:33:05,968 --> 00:33:06,770
Is this a...

654
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:09,271
A nursery? Yes.

655
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:14,237
We haven't told very
many people yet,

656
00:33:14,237 --> 00:33:17,937
But... lee and I are
trying to adopt a baby.

657
00:33:17,937 --> 00:33:20,070
Oh. I had no idea.

658
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:21,970
Yeah.

659
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:23,904
It's something we've
wanted for years.

660
00:33:23,904 --> 00:33:25,737
Oh, okay.

661
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:28,271
Why?

662
00:33:28,271 --> 00:33:31,137
I mean, you guys have
this amazing life.

663
00:33:31,137 --> 00:33:34,204
Parties every night,
cosmos at 5:00.

664
00:33:34,204 --> 00:33:37,204
You know all that goes
away when the baby comes.

665
00:33:37,204 --> 00:33:39,904
And we can't wait.

666
00:33:39,904 --> 00:33:42,204
Last month there was
this baby in ohio.

667
00:33:42,204 --> 00:33:43,372
We got the call in the
middle of the night.

668
00:33:43,372 --> 00:33:45,339
We were on a plane in the morning.

669
00:33:45,339 --> 00:33:47,872
We got to the hospital,
and there she was--

670
00:33:47,872 --> 00:33:50,372
A little girl.

671
00:33:58,401 --> 00:34:02,567
We held that baby in our arms...

672
00:34:02,567 --> 00:34:04,701
For two days.

673
00:34:06,601 --> 00:34:08,736
And then we went out to buy a
car seat to bring her home,

674
00:34:08,736 --> 00:34:10,770
And when we got back
to the hospital,

675
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:14,236
The... social worker was waiting
for us outside the nursery.

676
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:19,236
The mother had changed her mind.

677
00:34:22,736 --> 00:34:25,236
I know how that feels.

678
00:34:29,703 --> 00:34:31,736
I am so sorry, bob.

679
00:34:34,136 --> 00:34:36,136
You may envy our life, gaby,

680
00:34:36,136 --> 00:34:38,469
But... it's nothing

681
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:41,269
Compared to how we envy yours.

682
00:34:51,236 --> 00:34:53,236
Hey, what are you doing?

683
00:34:53,236 --> 00:34:55,670
The party's just getting started.

684
00:34:55,670 --> 00:35:00,372
I know. It's just--juanita
scored her first goal in soccer,

685
00:35:00,372 --> 00:35:02,503
And she wants to tell
me all about it, so...

686
00:35:02,503 --> 00:35:03,937
Go.

687
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,169
Give them a kiss for me.

688
00:35:06,169 --> 00:35:07,970
I will.

689
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:32,261
Knock, knock. Karen, are you home?

690
00:35:32,261 --> 00:35:34,294
I'm in here.

691
00:35:37,894 --> 00:35:39,994
Uh, listen.

692
00:35:39,994 --> 00:35:41,994
I've been thinking
about your wedding,

693
00:35:41,994 --> 00:35:45,827
And, well, I just want
to talk to you about...

694
00:35:45,827 --> 00:35:47,527
What's wrong?

695
00:35:47,527 --> 00:35:50,161
Nothing.

696
00:35:52,127 --> 00:35:56,294
The doctor found a spot on my lung.

697
00:35:58,227 --> 00:36:00,394
A spot?

698
00:36:02,227 --> 00:36:05,161
He thinks it might be cancer.

699
00:36:17,627 --> 00:36:19,927
She told you, huh?

700
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:21,264
Yeah.

701
00:36:21,264 --> 00:36:22,730
It's gonna be okay.

702
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:25,097
She's getting a biopsy next week.

703
00:36:25,097 --> 00:36:27,331
She's gonna lick this thing.

704
00:36:27,331 --> 00:36:29,997
Cancer picked a fight
with the wrong broad.

705
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:35,596
Uh, so given the diagnosis,

706
00:36:35,596 --> 00:36:38,997
Maybe it's not a good
time to get married.

707
00:36:38,997 --> 00:36:41,264
Oh!

708
00:36:44,297 --> 00:36:46,264
We're getting married,

709
00:36:46,264 --> 00:36:48,230
Soon as we can.

710
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:51,496
But you said-- I know what I said.

711
00:36:51,496 --> 00:36:54,544
All I could think about was
losing my independence,

712
00:36:54,544 --> 00:36:55,786
Losing my freedom,

713
00:36:55,786 --> 00:36:59,219
But after this happened,

714
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:03,719
Now I realize the worst
thing I could lose is her.

715
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:06,185
So...

716
00:37:06,185 --> 00:37:08,319
You're willing...

717
00:37:08,319 --> 00:37:10,652
To give up salt?

718
00:37:10,652 --> 00:37:13,819
I'm willing to give up anything.

719
00:37:13,819 --> 00:37:14,515
Oh, roy.

720
00:37:14,515 --> 00:37:18,315
Ah-ah! Watch it, doll.
I told you I'm giving it up.

721
00:37:18,315 --> 00:37:20,749
One kiss is all you get.

722
00:37:33,849 --> 00:37:35,849
Oh, hey! You're still up.

723
00:37:35,849 --> 00:37:39,016
Yeah, I... sort of needed to
talk to you about something.

724
00:37:39,016 --> 00:37:42,016
Well, if it's me helping
with the bills...

725
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:44,050
I've got great news.

726
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:45,106
You got the job?

727
00:37:45,106 --> 00:37:46,438
You're looking

728
00:37:46,438 --> 00:37:48,438
At the downtown
grill's new hostess.

729
00:37:49,935 --> 00:37:51,363
I start tomorrow.

730
00:37:51,363 --> 00:37:54,297
Oh! Thank you for
loaning me your top.

731
00:37:54,297 --> 00:37:56,530
The manager said I
looked very classy.

732
00:37:56,530 --> 00:38:00,818
Oh. I can't tell you how
happy this makes me.

733
00:38:01,729 --> 00:38:05,197
So... you wanna tell me your thing?

734
00:38:05,197 --> 00:38:07,930
No, it's--it can wait.

735
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:10,530
Are you sure?

736
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:12,063
Yeah. Absolutely.

737
00:38:12,063 --> 00:38:14,363
I'll get you a glass.

738
00:38:16,063 --> 00:38:18,163
Aah!

739
00:38:18,163 --> 00:38:19,830
Oh, my god! Oh.

740
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,930
Oh, my god. Oh.

741
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:25,563
Oh, your blouse.
I am so sorry. It's okay.

742
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,267
Wait. What are you doing?
I'm just gonna rinse it out.

743
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:32,482
No, no, no. Stop.
It's--it's--it's okay.

744
00:38:32,483 --> 00:38:33,867
No, but it's gonna stain.

745
00:38:33,867 --> 00:38:34,893
I'll send it to the dry cleaners.

746
00:38:34,893 --> 00:38:36,833
Oh, but that is so expensive.
Here we go--

747
00:38:36,833 --> 00:38:39,534
You have to leave.

748
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:41,776
What?

749
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:44,777
I need you to move out of my house.

750
00:38:48,677 --> 00:38:49,943
Why?

751
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:55,103
It's--it's-- it's complicated.

752
00:39:00,637 --> 00:39:02,403
Is this...

753
00:39:02,403 --> 00:39:05,004
This what you wanted
to talk to me about?

754
00:39:05,004 --> 00:39:07,370
Yeah.

755
00:39:10,337 --> 00:39:12,470
Sorry if I did something wrong.

756
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:16,037
I have a friend I can go stay with,

757
00:39:16,037 --> 00:39:18,904
So I'm just gonna go pack.

758
00:39:18,904 --> 00:39:21,503
Robin.

759
00:39:21,503 --> 00:39:24,941
You haven't done anything wrong.

760
00:39:24,941 --> 00:39:29,351
I like you very much.

761
00:39:29,351 --> 00:39:32,085
In fact...

762
00:39:32,085 --> 00:39:33,618
Too much.

763
00:39:35,651 --> 00:39:39,712
Lately I've started to
have feelings for you...

764
00:39:41,152 --> 00:39:44,051
That I don't understand,

765
00:39:44,051 --> 00:39:46,651
And it's confusing me.

766
00:39:53,484 --> 00:39:55,484
You know what I'm saying?

767
00:39:57,417 --> 00:39:59,085
I do...

768
00:40:00,718 --> 00:40:03,384
'cause I'm having those
feelings for you, too.

769
00:40:05,532 --> 00:40:07,133
You're right.

770
00:40:07,133 --> 00:40:09,166
I should go.

771
00:41:02,632 --> 00:41:07,066
Seduction is an art.

772
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:12,437
Subtle methods of coercion are used

773
00:41:12,437 --> 00:41:17,298
To sway the susceptible.

774
00:41:17,298 --> 00:41:20,672
And those who are determined

775
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:26,005
Will take their time
to get what they want.

776
00:41:28,732 --> 00:41:31,565
And when the seduction
is successful,

777
00:41:31,565 --> 00:41:35,074
Those who succumbed
ask themselves...

778
00:41:35,074 --> 00:41:38,327
Was I seduced...

779
00:41:38,327 --> 00:41:43,059
Or was this what I
wanted all along?
