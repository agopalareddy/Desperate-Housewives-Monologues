1
00:00:00,441 --> 00:00:03,051
Previously on Desperate Housewives...

2
00:00:03,088 --> 00:00:06,899
- A mother protected her son...
- Here in America, we actually get divorced

3
00:00:06,909 --> 00:00:09,987
- before we get married again.
- I will explain it all the way.

4
00:00:11,057 --> 00:00:14,229
Your father told me you
called off the wedding.

5
00:00:14,905 --> 00:00:17,271
Evil came to Wisteria Lane.

6
00:00:17,806 --> 00:00:18,998
Susan , how is she?

7
00:00:19,007 --> 00:00:21,138
We don't know yet. Nobody's talking to us.

8
00:00:21,175 --> 00:00:22,480
It struck again.

9
00:00:23,475 --> 00:00:26,366
- I can't believe she's dead.
- I didn't really know her

10
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:28,885
- But I guess we're sort of connected now.
- You would've liked her.

11
00:00:28,886 --> 00:00:32,154
- And fear set in.
- Whoever attacked Julie is still out there.

12
00:00:32,155 --> 00:00:35,267
- There is obviously a madman on the loose.
- Hey!

13
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:37,418
The stage was set...

14
00:00:37,419 --> 00:00:41,468
I'm a little out of your
league, don't you think?

15
00:00:41,503 --> 00:00:42,964
For the killer...

16
00:00:42,965 --> 00:00:45,179
What are you doing?

17
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,770
To strike again.

18
00:00:53,098 --> 00:00:57,035
There is a house in the town of Fairview.

19
00:00:57,069 --> 00:01:00,505
Inside this house lives a monster...

20
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:04,809
the kind who kills young women.

21
00:01:04,877 --> 00:01:09,681
You may ask how such a monster came to be,

22
00:01:09,715 --> 00:01:14,218
and that's a very good question, indeed.

23
00:01:14,253 --> 00:01:17,722
I'm out of scotch.

24
00:01:17,756 --> 00:01:20,224
I'll buy you some more while I'm out.

25
00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:23,261
You got any in your room?

26
00:01:23,295 --> 00:01:25,897
No. And stay out of there.

27
00:01:25,931 --> 00:01:28,406
I know you've been stealing my booze.

28
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,469
Mom, stop being so
paranoid. I don't even drink.

29
00:01:31,503 --> 00:01:32,819
Sure you don't.

30
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,707
I gotta help Mrs. Scavo fix her car.

31
00:01:36,741 --> 00:01:40,277
You can wait a little while, right?

32
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,222
His name was Eddie.

33
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:56,360
Everyone thought he was harmless...

34
00:01:59,097 --> 00:02:04,368
Until the day his mother
went into his room.

35
00:02:04,402 --> 00:02:09,640
She was just looking
for a bottle of scotch...

36
00:02:13,078 --> 00:02:17,414
But found the truth instead.

37
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:24,355
Soon everyone in town would be asking,

38
00:02:24,389 --> 00:02:27,725
"how could such a monster come to be?"

39
00:02:30,362 --> 00:02:34,498
Sadly, the answer...

40
00:02:34,533 --> 00:02:38,002
would satisfy no one.

41
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:51,104
I met Eddie on a Monday.

42
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:57,077
He had just turned 4.

43
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:02,115
If you're smart, you'll
take up jogging now.

44
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:04,684
Don't wait till you're
my age. It's too late.

45
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:07,053
I can't do anything! At this
point, I'd settle for anything.

46
00:03:07,088 --> 00:03:10,190
Do the dishes. Wipe down
the counter. You've given up!

47
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:12,878
- I'm doing the best I can.
- So what's going on in there?

48
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,600
You know what? I don't
need this crap. I am done!

49
00:03:15,607 --> 00:03:17,593
Baby, I said I was sorry!

50
00:03:17,594 --> 00:03:18,999
It's too late, Barbara.
I can't take it anymore.

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,983
But you can't just
walk out. We have a kid!

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,634
No, you have a kid. I never wanted him.

53
00:03:22,668 --> 00:03:26,137
I never wanted any of this!

54
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:29,447
Excuse me! Is this your child?

55
00:03:29,448 --> 00:03:30,966
What's it to you?

56
00:03:30,967 --> 00:03:35,453
Well, I'm sure you don't want to be
talking like this in front of him.

57
00:03:39,257 --> 00:03:40,725
I was just leaving.

58
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:42,493
Hank, don't do this!

59
00:03:42,527 --> 00:03:44,428
Don't leave me here.

60
00:03:44,463 --> 00:03:47,064
I don't want to be alone.

61
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,411
Eddie, come here.

62
00:04:00,445 --> 00:04:03,266
Come here. I have to get ready for work.

63
00:04:10,544 --> 00:04:12,878
Oh, it's you.

64
00:04:14,047 --> 00:04:17,328
I just wanted to check in,
see how you guys are doing.

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,435
Also, I... I made you a little something.

66
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:22,936
You're kidding.

67
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:26,173
Well, it's nothing special,
just macaroni and cheese.

68
00:04:28,042 --> 00:04:31,311
Come on. Let me heat this up for you.

69
00:04:33,248 --> 00:04:34,715
I don't know.

70
00:04:34,749 --> 00:04:36,135
And then we can talk.

71
00:04:36,136 --> 00:04:38,448
And if you want to
complain about your husband,

72
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:40,673
I promise, I won't defend him.

73
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,725
Don't just stand there, then.

74
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:46,293
Come on in.

75
00:04:51,733 --> 00:04:53,834
He's a handsome little boy.

76
00:04:53,868 --> 00:04:56,870
Looks just like his father...

77
00:04:56,905 --> 00:04:58,472
Which is a shame.

78
00:05:00,642 --> 00:05:02,509
Maybe Hank will reconsider.

79
00:05:02,544 --> 00:05:05,846
No. He's serious this time.

80
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,549
I'm all alone with a
4-year-old to raise.

81
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:10,884
Isn't there anybody who can help you?

82
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:12,553
Family, your mother?

83
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,154
Oh, my mother.

84
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:15,656
God forbid.

85
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,257
What about friends?

86
00:05:17,292 --> 00:05:20,652
You know, I have a great group
of friends over on Wisteria Lane.

87
00:05:21,296 --> 00:05:23,783
We've helped each other get
through all sorts of problems.

88
00:05:23,784 --> 00:05:28,097
Yeah, I've never really been the
type of woman to have girlfriends.

89
00:05:28,098 --> 00:05:32,363
And now I'm 35 years old with a kid.

90
00:05:32,364 --> 00:05:35,612
I'm guessing I'm not really going
to be having any boyfriends either.

91
00:05:35,613 --> 00:05:37,114
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

92
00:05:37,148 --> 00:05:39,616
Women in your situation find love.

93
00:05:39,651 --> 00:05:42,419
You just have to look for it.

94
00:05:42,454 --> 00:05:45,055
- I guess.
- Well, I've gotta go.

95
00:05:47,158 --> 00:05:50,227
Um, if you like, I can stop by next week.

96
00:05:50,261 --> 00:05:53,559
Uh, no, you don't have
to do that. We'll be fine.

97
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,842
Uh, Eddie, say good-bye to Mary Alice.

98
00:05:55,843 --> 00:05:57,401
Good-bye.

99
00:05:57,435 --> 00:05:58,569
You take care, Eddie.

100
00:05:58,603 --> 00:06:00,070
Oh, so cute.

101
00:06:01,272 --> 00:06:04,775
He's gonna be a heartbreaker one day.

102
00:06:04,809 --> 00:06:08,746
Just like his father.

103
00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:22,893
Oh, hi, Eddie.

104
00:06:22,927 --> 00:06:27,297
Remember me? I... I brought
you a little something.

105
00:06:27,332 --> 00:06:30,701
I'm not supposed to open the door.

106
00:06:30,735 --> 00:06:33,704
Well, tell your mom I'm
here, and she can open it.

107
00:06:33,738 --> 00:06:35,639
She's not here.

108
00:06:35,673 --> 00:06:38,775
Oh, well, tell your babysitter then.

109
00:06:41,775 --> 00:06:45,077
Y... you do have a sitter, don't you?

110
00:06:46,646 --> 00:06:51,750
Eddie, where exactly is your mother?

111
00:06:59,093 --> 00:07:02,023
Oh, my gosh! What are you doing here?

112
00:07:02,024 --> 00:07:06,327
Look, it's my friend, Mary Alice.

113
00:07:06,361 --> 00:07:07,927
Well, nice to meet you, Mary.

114
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:10,510
The name's Ron. Can I buy you a drink?

115
00:07:10,511 --> 00:07:12,147
Thanks, but I'm not
gonna be here that long.

116
00:07:12,148 --> 00:07:14,883
- Get up. You're leaving.
- Whoa!

117
00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:18,116
She can't leave yet. No, this
party's just getting started.

118
00:07:18,117 --> 00:07:19,894
Did you say your name was Ron?

119
00:07:19,895 --> 00:07:23,651
- Yeah.
- Shut up, Ron. I have Eddie in my car.

120
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:27,111
Eddie? Has something
happened? He's not hurt, is he?

121
00:07:27,112 --> 00:07:29,703
- No, he's fine, no thanks to you.
- Who's Eddie?

122
00:07:29,704 --> 00:07:31,633
Her 4-year-old child
who she left at her home,

123
00:07:31,634 --> 00:07:33,671
- unattended.
- You got a kid?

124
00:07:33,672 --> 00:07:36,896
You know, you might want
to lead with that next time,

125
00:07:36,897 --> 00:07:38,796
before I spring for the screwdrivers.

126
00:07:38,797 --> 00:07:40,589
Oh, baby.

127
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:43,693
Don't, uh, don't you want
to get my phone number?

128
00:07:43,727 --> 00:07:46,529
Now look at what you've done.

129
00:07:46,563 --> 00:07:49,095
I am this close to
calling social services.

130
00:07:49,096 --> 00:07:51,895
You might wanna change
your tone. Let's go.

131
00:07:51,896 --> 00:07:55,004
You've got a little boy to look after.

132
00:07:57,374 --> 00:07:59,405
I know I should have stayed home.

133
00:07:59,406 --> 00:08:02,059
But I was already dressed
when the sitter canceled,

134
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,913
and I really just needed a
couple of hours to myself.

135
00:08:04,944 --> 00:08:08,480
He's 4 years old, Barbara.
What if he had gotten sick?

136
00:08:08,515 --> 00:08:09,951
What if he had hurt himself?

137
00:08:09,952 --> 00:08:11,850
I know. I know. It was really stupid.

138
00:08:11,885 --> 00:08:15,054
You've got to promise me you will
never do something like this again.

139
00:08:15,055 --> 00:08:17,223
Never again. I swear.

140
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,267
It's just...

141
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:24,770
What?

142
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:29,811
I really need a man.

143
00:08:33,245 --> 00:08:36,184
Oh, my heavens. I should
have been home hours ago.

144
00:08:36,185 --> 00:08:38,386
Don't worry about us. We are good now.

145
00:08:43,158 --> 00:08:46,828
I want you to be happy, Barbara. I do.

146
00:08:46,862 --> 00:08:49,030
It's just...

147
00:08:49,064 --> 00:08:50,565
being a mother means,

148
00:08:50,599 --> 00:08:53,334
always putting his needs ahead of yours.

149
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,337
You're right.

150
00:08:56,372 --> 00:08:59,107
That's exactly what it means.

151
00:09:04,013 --> 00:09:05,713
Baby...

152
00:09:05,748 --> 00:09:07,949
Come here.

153
00:09:09,585 --> 00:09:11,853
Oh, Eddie.

154
00:09:13,722 --> 00:09:16,852
It's not your fault you ruined my life.

155
00:09:22,535 --> 00:09:25,203
Gabrielle met Eddie on a Tuesday,

156
00:09:25,238 --> 00:09:27,873
the day she moved into the neighborhood.

157
00:09:27,907 --> 00:09:30,308
Carlos, I'm bored.

158
00:09:30,343 --> 00:09:32,244
No, I can't go get my nails done,

159
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:34,145
because I'm waiting
for the freaking movers!

160
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,648
Besides, I doubt this town even has a spa.

161
00:09:36,682 --> 00:09:38,583
It does, however, have annoying people.

162
00:09:38,618 --> 00:09:40,720
Who come to your house
with welcome baskets.

163
00:09:40,721 --> 00:09:43,023
And say things like, "hot enough for you?"

164
00:09:43,024 --> 00:09:46,716
No, no, no, no! You are not
going into another meeting!

165
00:09:46,717 --> 00:09:49,096
You know, just because I moved here
for your job, doesn't mean you...

166
00:09:49,097 --> 00:09:53,121
Oh, yeah. Damn right we're
gonna talk about this tonight,

167
00:09:53,122 --> 00:09:55,457
and it will be hot enough for you.

168
00:10:01,315 --> 00:10:03,480
Looks like it's just you and me, Chanel.

169
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,215
Oh! God. Who the hell are you?

170
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,018
- Eddie.
- How did you get in here?

171
00:10:26,053 --> 00:10:28,354
Through the window. How did you get in?

172
00:10:28,388 --> 00:10:30,389
With my key. I own this place.

173
00:10:30,424 --> 00:10:33,225
Well, I've been playing here
since the other people moved.

174
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,161
Can I still do that?

175
00:10:35,195 --> 00:10:38,965
No! Get out. Go. Go home.
Shoo! Shoo, shoo, shoo!

176
00:10:40,901 --> 00:10:43,469
Did you know you're really beautiful?

177
00:10:51,111 --> 00:10:53,412
Okay, maybe I was a little rude earlier.

178
00:10:53,447 --> 00:10:56,315
- What's your story? What do you do?
- I'm a kid.

179
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:59,986
- Oh. Right. So why aren't you in school?
-  It's summer.

180
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:03,356
Oh. Right. Well, I don't
really do the kid thing.

181
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,358
So where do you live?

182
00:11:05,392 --> 00:11:07,426
A couple of streets over.

183
00:11:07,461 --> 00:11:09,287
The house with the weeds.

184
00:11:11,288 --> 00:11:15,876
Well, that's the moving van that
has a lot of boxes I have to unpack.

185
00:11:15,877 --> 00:11:18,479
You better hit the road.

186
00:11:18,547 --> 00:11:21,616
Or I could stay here and help you unpack.

187
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,455
Follow me.

188
00:11:30,692 --> 00:11:33,712
Mm! Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa. You missed a spot.

189
00:11:33,713 --> 00:11:35,168
Oh, sorry.

190
00:11:35,196 --> 00:11:37,698
Don't apologize. You do good work.

191
00:11:37,732 --> 00:11:40,400
Maybe next time you'll be
ready to do a French tip.

192
00:11:40,435 --> 00:11:43,270
Should I get that?

193
00:11:43,304 --> 00:11:45,239
No. Shh. Keep your voice down.

194
00:11:45,273 --> 00:11:47,174
It might be one of those Stepford wives.

195
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,584
With another "welcome to
the neighborhood" cake.

196
00:11:48,585 --> 00:11:50,382
I mean, really, does
it look like I eat cake?

197
00:11:50,383 --> 00:11:52,516
Some of the neighbors are nice.

198
00:11:52,614 --> 00:11:55,949
That lady with the red hair
makes her own Halloween candy.

199
00:11:55,984 --> 00:11:58,003
You mean the one whose
parents named her after cheese?

200
00:11:58,004 --> 00:12:00,855
No, thank you. I like my
robots a little more lifelike.

201
00:12:00,856 --> 00:12:05,592
Though she's not as bad as that blonde
chick who's always yelling at her kids.

202
00:12:05,593 --> 00:12:08,691
There are people on fire who
are not as loud as she is.

203
00:12:08,692 --> 00:12:11,994
And then I thought, maybe for a second,

204
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,568
that Susan Mayer lady and I could be friends.

205
00:12:14,602 --> 00:12:17,905
And then she started talking.

206
00:12:17,939 --> 00:12:20,641
Okay, good. I think they're gone.

207
00:12:20,675 --> 00:12:23,343
Can we watch our shows now?

208
00:12:23,378 --> 00:12:26,539
Just as soon as you finish
unpacking those boxes in the kitchen.

209
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,691
I did it this morning.

210
00:12:28,691 --> 00:12:32,264
Oh, my God. If you can sew, I
am locking you in my basement,

211
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:33,897
and you are staying here forever.

212
00:12:34,329 --> 00:12:35,193
Cool!

213
00:12:35,197 --> 00:12:36,631
Eddie, I was kidding.

214
00:12:36,665 --> 00:12:39,067
You've been coming here
every day for a week.

215
00:12:39,101 --> 00:12:41,410
- Doesn't your mother mind?
- No.

216
00:12:41,411 --> 00:12:43,613
Are you sure? Maybe I should call her.

217
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:46,370
No. Uh, she has this new boyfriend,

218
00:12:46,371 --> 00:12:48,149
and they like their alone time.

219
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:53,779
Okay. Well, then why don't
you stay for dinner? I'll cook.

220
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:57,535
- Great!
- Although, you are the one who
unpacked the pots and pans,

221
00:12:57,536 --> 00:12:59,031
so I'd hate to mess up your system.

222
00:12:59,032 --> 00:13:01,633
I'll cook. I can heat up soup.

223
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:04,035
More than I can do.

224
00:13:06,773 --> 00:13:09,783
Okay, Yao Lin, how sick are you, really?

225
00:13:09,784 --> 00:13:11,999
If you can dial a phone, you can come in.

226
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,968
And do three loads of
laundry and wash some dishes.

227
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,068
W... Yao Lin, you know I can't understand
when you speak in your native gibberish!

228
00:13:21,068 --> 00:13:22,648
Hello?

229
00:13:22,741 --> 00:13:23,841
Hello?

230
00:13:25,377 --> 00:13:27,459
Surprise, babe.

231
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,747
Honey! What are you doing home?

232
00:13:29,782 --> 00:13:32,183
Well, I was at work and
I started thinking about

233
00:13:32,217 --> 00:13:33,785
my lonely...

234
00:13:33,819 --> 00:13:35,053
beautiful wife.

235
00:13:36,589 --> 00:13:38,690
And that big beautiful bathtub upstairs.

236
00:13:38,724 --> 00:13:41,626
- We haven't christened yet.
- You pig.

237
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:45,196
So you're saying you don't
want to take a bath with me?

238
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:48,608
Well, I guess the pans can wait.

239
00:13:48,609 --> 00:13:51,205
Until Yao Lin recovers
from her double pneumonia.

240
00:13:54,205 --> 00:13:56,506
All right.

241
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,175
We've done the tub.

242
00:13:58,209 --> 00:14:01,678
Maybe we should christen
the guest room next.

243
00:14:01,713 --> 00:14:03,384
Mm, that sounds great,
but I need to get going.

244
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:06,482
Wait a minute. You're going
back to work? This is a nooner?

245
00:14:06,483 --> 00:14:07,806
I can't take the whole day off.

246
00:14:07,807 --> 00:14:09,945
I already canceled two
meetings and a lunch for this.

247
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:12,522
So how long do we have?

248
00:14:12,557 --> 00:14:13,991
Five more minutes.

249
00:14:14,025 --> 00:14:16,360
Well, don't just sit
there. Fondle something.

250
00:14:18,696 --> 00:14:21,298
What the hell? Who are you?

251
00:14:21,332 --> 00:14:22,499
Eddie!

252
00:14:22,533 --> 00:14:24,001
You know this kid?

253
00:14:24,035 --> 00:14:26,303
He lives in the neighborhood.

254
00:14:26,337 --> 00:14:29,506
I knocked. No one answered.
So I came through the window.

255
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,440
We're naked. Get out!

256
00:14:31,441 --> 00:14:33,776
She told me I could come
over. Who's this guy?

257
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:36,779
He's my husband, Eddie! Get out!

258
00:14:39,449 --> 00:14:42,918
This is how you've
been spending your days?

259
00:14:42,953 --> 00:14:45,189
He's lonely. I'm lonely.

260
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:48,262
There are plenty of women on this
street that you can be friends with.

261
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:49,381
Well, they're all so weird.

262
00:14:49,382 --> 00:14:52,547
Gaby, your best friend is a
9-year-old boy. That's weird.

263
00:14:52,548 --> 00:14:56,555
He has no one in his life.
His mother totally ignores him.

264
00:14:56,556 --> 00:14:58,885
I'm thinking of going over
there and saying something.

265
00:14:58,886 --> 00:15:02,060
No. Stay out of it. This
is where we live now,

266
00:15:02,061 --> 00:15:04,377
and I don't want us to be
known as the nosy neighbors.

267
00:15:08,457 --> 00:15:10,878
But he's so sad.

268
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:13,832
I don't care. Stop using
him as your excuse.

269
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:17,073
Cut him loose and get out there and
start making a life for yourself.

270
00:15:27,113 --> 00:15:27,885
Buddy?

271
00:15:32,051 --> 00:15:36,855
Look, Eddie, I'm sorry
Carlos yelled at you.

272
00:15:36,889 --> 00:15:39,458
It's just... we were cleaning the tub.

273
00:15:39,492 --> 00:15:43,361
I know what sex is. I'm not stupid.

274
00:15:43,396 --> 00:15:46,465
No, you're not, which
is why you should know.

275
00:15:46,499 --> 00:15:49,100
You can't just break into people's houses.

276
00:15:49,135 --> 00:15:52,571
It was okay when I was
unpacking your boxes.

277
00:15:52,605 --> 00:15:55,373
Look, Eddie, I really like you.

278
00:15:55,408 --> 00:16:00,245
But the thing is, we can't
hang out so much anymore.

279
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:02,351
I need to make friends my age,

280
00:16:02,352 --> 00:16:04,014
and you need to make friends your age.

281
00:16:05,718 --> 00:16:08,520
You know what? You're not so pretty.

282
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:59,938
Bree hired Eddie to
help out on a Wednesday,

283
00:16:59,944 --> 00:17:03,547
and she helped him in return.

284
00:17:03,581 --> 00:17:06,483
It's looking wonderful, Eddie.

285
00:17:06,517 --> 00:17:08,518
Same time tomorrow?

286
00:17:08,553 --> 00:17:12,622
Sure, Mrs. Hodge.

287
00:17:14,525 --> 00:17:16,593
I think you gave me too much.

288
00:17:16,627 --> 00:17:18,995
Call it a bonus for a job well done.

289
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,652
You don't need to do this.

290
00:17:20,653 --> 00:17:23,190
Well, I'm sure you could
use a little extra cash.

291
00:17:23,191 --> 00:17:24,525
Do you have a girlfriend?

292
00:17:24,526 --> 00:17:26,675
Maybe you could, uh,
buy her something nice.

293
00:17:26,676 --> 00:17:28,888
Uh, I don't have a girlfriend.

294
00:17:31,142 --> 00:17:32,642
Well...

295
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:34,444
you're still young.

296
00:17:34,479 --> 00:17:36,913
Well, it wouldn't matter how old I am.

297
00:17:36,948 --> 00:17:39,449
Girls never notice me.

298
00:17:39,484 --> 00:17:41,418
Well, did it ever occur to you,

299
00:17:41,452 --> 00:17:44,955
that they might be waiting
for you to notice them?

300
00:17:44,989 --> 00:17:46,690
Um... no.

301
00:17:49,727 --> 00:17:52,162
Are there any girls that you like?

302
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:55,665
There is this one girl at school.

303
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,368
Do you ever talk to her?

304
00:17:58,402 --> 00:18:01,921
See? She has probably
noticed you lots of times.

305
00:18:01,922 --> 00:18:04,299
And wonders why you don't
walk up to introduce yourself.

306
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,168
I wouldn't even know what to say.

307
00:18:06,202 --> 00:18:08,971
Does she have nice eyes?

308
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:11,039
She has nice everything.

309
00:18:11,074 --> 00:18:14,243
Well, you can start
by mentioning her eyes.

310
00:18:14,277 --> 00:18:17,579
Trust me. You can never go
wrong with a genuine compliment.

311
00:18:17,614 --> 00:18:19,514
This is good stuff.

312
00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:21,483
Anything else?

313
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,152
Well, once you have her
attention, you've gotta woo her.

314
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:26,222
Woo?

315
00:18:26,223 --> 00:18:27,322
Yes. Give her a little gift.

316
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:29,725
So she knows that you're
thinking about her.

317
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,159
Flowers are nice.

318
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:33,095
Roses are even better.

319
00:18:33,129 --> 00:18:37,499
And then eventually, you can
work your way up to jewelry.

320
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:40,068
I can't afford all that.

321
00:18:42,672 --> 00:18:44,139
Now you can.

322
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:55,651
Excuse me.

323
00:18:55,685 --> 00:18:57,986
Um, are you Eddie Orlofsky's mother?

324
00:18:58,021 --> 00:19:00,522
- Who's asking?
- Bree Hodge.

325
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:04,280
Your son has been doing some
painting for me over on Wisteria Lane.

326
00:19:04,281 --> 00:19:07,829
You're not the woman who has
sex with her gardeners, are you?

327
00:19:07,864 --> 00:19:10,499
Oh, good heavens, no. That's...

328
00:19:10,533 --> 00:19:11,967
somebody else.

329
00:19:13,001 --> 00:19:16,137
Um, may I please speak to Eddie?

330
00:19:16,171 --> 00:19:18,272
Uh, he's not here.

331
00:19:18,307 --> 00:19:21,536
Oh. Uh, well, then, um,
maybe you can help me.

332
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:28,198
A few weeks ago, I gave Eddie some
advice on how to talk to girls.

333
00:19:28,199 --> 00:19:30,959
Oh, I'm glad someone
did. The kid is a lummox.

334
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,776
Uh, yes. Uh, well...

335
00:19:32,777 --> 00:19:38,292
What I didn't realize is that
the object of his affection

336
00:19:38,293 --> 00:19:39,868
is my daughter Danielle.

337
00:19:39,948 --> 00:19:42,570
He gave her roses and then more roses,

338
00:19:42,571 --> 00:19:46,518
and then I found this in my mailbox.

339
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:53,480
Oh, big spender. Just like his dad.

340
00:19:53,481 --> 00:19:55,797
It was a lovely gesture.

341
00:19:59,501 --> 00:20:01,402
Sadly, Danielle doesn't
return his feelings.

342
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:04,190
She spends most of her time
with the other cheerleaders...

343
00:20:04,191 --> 00:20:06,210
Say no more. She's out of his league.

344
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:09,209
No. That's not what I mean.

345
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,280
So what, you want me to talk to him?

346
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,949
Uh, yes.

347
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:17,499
Uh, if you could just say
something to let him down easy.

348
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,530
You got it.

349
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,570
What's going on?

350
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,530
This lady says you've
been stalking her daughter.

351
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,459
- I didn't say that.
- You just said he is

352
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,239
harassing some girl he has no chance with.

353
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,660
What the hell else do you call that?

354
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:35,600
I was trying to woo her.

355
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:42,109
Woo her?

356
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:44,380
Oh, my God. That's hysterical.

357
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:46,189
There's no need to mock him.

358
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:48,480
Oh, who is mocking? I am thrilled.

359
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:50,919
I always figured the only
girl he'd end up with

360
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,750
would be blind, deaf or inflatable.

361
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:59,100
But now that I know how
good he is at wooing...

362
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,880
Please don't laugh at me.

363
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,310
I'll do what I want, Romeo.

364
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,600
And don't worry.

365
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:09,120
I'll make sure he stops
hassling your daughter.

366
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,420
I'm sorry.

367
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:30,820
Hello, Eddie.

368
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,880
It's been a few days.

369
00:21:33,881 --> 00:21:36,570
I wasn't, uh, sure if
I'd be seeing you again.

370
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,410
I didn't wanna come back,
but I needed the money.

371
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,970
No, I don't blame you for being angry.

372
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,060
I don't want to talk about this.

373
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,729
Oh, Eddie, I wish you had told me.

374
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:51,150
That Danielle was the girl
you were interested in.

375
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,839
Oh, yeah, right. Then...
then you could have told me

376
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,739
that she was out of my league
and saved my mom the trouble.

377
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,730
I wouldn't have said that,

378
00:21:56,731 --> 00:21:58,920
and I definitely wouldn't
have laughed at you.

379
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:02,470
Why not? It's... it's pretty funny.

380
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,390
Nerdy freak wants to
date popular cheerleader?

381
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:09,469
The only thing I see when I
look at you is a nice young man

382
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,730
who isn't treated as well as he should be.

383
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:15,189
Yeah, well, tell Danielle she can relax.

384
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:17,900
I, uh, I won't be talking to
her anymore. I've been forbidden.

385
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:22,300
Oh, Eddie, Danielle would be
happy to talk to you, as a friend.

386
00:22:22,301 --> 00:22:25,300
I don't want a friend. I
want someone to love me.

387
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,550
Well, of course you do.

388
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,770
I think I, uh, I wanna work now.

389
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,310
Eddie, there is someone out there for you.

390
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,840
You just have to be patient.

391
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,020
For how long?

392
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,669
I feel like I'm waiting

393
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:57,170
for someone who's never gonna show up.

394
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:02,370
There are girls out there
who will say "yes" to you.

395
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,470
You just have to find them.

396
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:11,800
Yes. It's half up front and half after.

397
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,420
So where do we go?

398
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,530
Down there.

399
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,690
Don't worry, cutie.

400
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,580
No one's gonna see us.

401
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:27,720
You can do whatever you want.

402
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,610
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

403
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,780
I forgot something.

404
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:40,630
I got you these.

405
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,350
Wow. I just...

406
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:54,520
Please don't laugh at me.

407
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,740
I'm sorry.

408
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,890
I'm sorry.

409
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:01,260
Let's just go.

410
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:30,460
Susan first noticed Eddie.

411
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:33,260
As the boy who sold her coffee.

412
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,040
Then one Thursday, she
noticed something more.

413
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,660
Wow. That's amazing.

414
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,890
- Oh, hey.
- I didn't know you were an artist.

415
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:45,099
Oh, I was just... I'm fooling around.

416
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:45,909
Uh, what can I get you?

417
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:47,000
No, let me see it.

418
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,250
Wow. Look at the
shadowing and the blending.

419
00:24:57,251 --> 00:24:59,489
It's... it's really good.

420
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:01,100
My mom thinks I'm wasting my time.

421
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,120
She says there's lots of
people way better than me.

422
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,639
Well, you tell your mom.

423
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,489
That I have an expensive,
worthless art degree

424
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:09,860
that says I know what I'm taking about,

425
00:25:09,861 --> 00:25:11,390
and you have huge potential.

426
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:15,100
- You think?
- Yeah. You just need to work on your technique.

427
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,400
I could help if you want.

428
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:19,140
Seriously?

429
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:22,560
That'd be great. Thanks.

430
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,420
Okay, whatever you want... on the house.

431
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,400
I'll have a large, triple-shot latte.

432
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,540
That's funny. Your husband
was in here earlier,

433
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:36,430
and that's exactly what he ordered.

434
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:37,750
Actually, he's...

435
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,050
now my ex-husband.

436
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,709
Oh. I'm... I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

437
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,500
No, no. It's fine. We've all moved on.

438
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,709
Mike's dating the woman that
lives across the street now,

439
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:51,730
and I'm, uh...

440
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:56,830
adding a double chocolate
brownie to my order.

441
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:58,440
We're all very happy.

442
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,510
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

443
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,910
I'm sure a lot of people
would like to date you.

444
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:05,940
You have huge potential, too.

445
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,090
Brownie.

446
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,150
Right.

447
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:17,210
Eddie, the detail is amazing.

448
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:19,030
Your use of perspective....

449
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,810
I can't believe you've come
so far in just a few weeks.

450
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,060
Well...

451
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:26,450
I had a really good teacher.

452
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:27,920
That's sweet.

453
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:31,980
But actually, I think
that you've outgrown me,

454
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:34,040
which is why I have a surprise for you.

455
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,520
What?

456
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,589
I signed you up,

457
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,720
for a 2-week seminar
at the art institute.

458
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,379
And before you say you can't afford it,

459
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,600
I already wrote the check.

460
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,990
This is, like, the nicest thing
anybody's ever done for me.

461
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:55,110
But I can't go.

462
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,850
Why not?

463
00:26:56,851 --> 00:26:58,449
My mom would never let me.

464
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,069
I mean, she... she... she thinks
this whole art thing is stupid.

465
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,910
Eddie, you can't let her do this to you.

466
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,790
You have such a gift.

467
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,260
Listen to me.

468
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:17,450
When you love something that
much, you can't just let it go.

469
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:21,450
That kind of love is the one
thing that keeps us going,

470
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,000
whether it makes sense
to anyone else or not.

471
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,740
This is just about the only
thing that makes me happy.

472
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:36,370
Then to hell with the rest of the world.

473
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,710
Mrs. Mayer?

474
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:49,260
Are you there? It's me, Eddie.

475
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,380
Oh, come on in! I'll be right down.

476
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:56,520
Hey, those art classes were amazing!

477
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:00,980
The first three days, they had us
do nothing but portraits from memory.

478
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,980
And then they, uh, they brought us
down to the beach to do seascapes.

479
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,440
I've got so much to tell you!

480
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:08,510
Yeah. Me, too.

481
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,920
Why are you wearing that?

482
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:14,700
I'm getting married.

483
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:17,320
To who?

484
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:18,230
Mike.

485
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:20,920
Uh, but he divorced you.

486
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,750
He made you so unhappy.

487
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,140
He did.

488
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:27,619
Uh, but then this madman kidnapped M.J.,

489
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:30,269
and so I went after him,
and then Mike came after us,

490
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:31,520
and he saved us both.

491
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:34,260
So we fell back in love.

492
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:37,260
This doesn't make any sense.

493
00:28:37,261 --> 00:28:38,619
It's so quick.

494
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,640
I know.

495
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,570
Oh, my God. Are those éclairs?

496
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:43,900
Yeah.

497
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,160
Oh, they look messy. Get them away.

498
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,000
So, yeah, it is quick.

499
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,899
I can't believe in two hours,

500
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,639
I'm gonna be marrying Mike.

501
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,830
And promising him I'll
be with him forever...

502
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:58,200
for the second time.

503
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,050
Oh, I have zero credibility.

504
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:02,650
Oh, look at me.

505
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,410
I don't know if I'm gonna
make it down the aisle.

506
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:08,140
Are they chocolate?
No, I don't wanna know.

507
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,540
Don't do it.

508
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:12,509
- They just smell so good.
- No, I mean the wedding.

509
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,370
If you're not sure, don't marry Mike.

510
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:17,359
Oh, no, Eddie, I've...
I booked the church,

511
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,380
I bought the dress. I
have to marry somebody.

512
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:21,800
You could marry me.

513
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,540
I have some money saved up.

514
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:39,250
Okay, you almost got me.

515
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:43,870
You are so sweet.

516
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,699
You saw that I was freaking out,

517
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,240
and you knew that I needed a good laugh.

518
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:50,380
I don't know what I'd do without you.

519
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:52,570
Hey, I have to finish getting ready.

520
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,130
Come to the church if you want.

521
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,080
Oh. What the hell?

522
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:00,340
I can always use my
bouquet to cover the stain.

523
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,030
By the power vested in me,

524
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:24,770
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

525
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,490
You may kiss your bride.

526
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:35,810
Julie!

527
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:50,050
Eddie.

528
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:53,670
I was just getting some coffee.
How sweet of you to visit.

529
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,829
Well, it's the first day

530
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,520
that they allowed non-family members.

531
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:04,430
I still can't believe it happened.

532
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:06,679
I keep asking myself,

533
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,480
how can there be this
kind of evil in the world?

534
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,400
What kind of monster would do this to her?

535
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,100
It wasn't a monster.

536
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,890
No, monsters are big and strong.

537
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:33,219
This was done by some weak,
insignificant piece of garbage

538
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:35,060
that doesn't even deserve
to be on this earth.

539
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:38,559
Anyone who could do this

540
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,200
to someone as sweet as Julie and you...

541
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:44,509
he should just do everyone a favor.

542
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:45,320
And just...

543
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,970
kill himself.

544
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,620
Anyone that could do this...

545
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:54,830
is too cowardly for that.

546
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:02,430
You're right.

547
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:09,909
It was during a Friday
night game of charades.

548
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:13,350
That Lynette was clued in
to the truth of Eddie's life.

549
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,750
Th... three words.

550
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,390
Third word. Third word.

551
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:20,210
You. You. Oh, uh, pregnant.

552
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:22,670
Bloated. Swollen. Huge.

553
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:25,079
Lady, Tom. I'm a lady.

554
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,830
- No talking.
- Better than hitting.

555
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:30,600
"Du Barry was a lady."

556
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,360
"Three times a lady."

557
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,530
- Uh, "Tramp and the Lady"?
- No. No, "My Fair Lady"!

558
00:33:34,531 --> 00:33:36,180
Yes. Yes!

559
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:38,790
"Tramp and the lady." Really?

560
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,220
Coming!

561
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:45,360
It's not easy when you're
swollen, bloated and huge.

562
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,250
Where's my kid?

563
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:51,240
Hey, Barbara. He's in here
with us. You want to come in?

564
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:52,620
No.

565
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:55,330
Eddie.

566
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,260
Get out here.

567
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,119
- Mom, what are you doing here?
- Why didn't you answer your phone?

568
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,529
Well, that was probably our fault.

569
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:08,909
Um, we were playing charades,

570
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:10,380
and you know how loud that can get. 

571
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:12,900
Yeah, I guess my invitation
got lost in the mail.

572
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:16,380
- You gotta come home.
- It's not even 8:00, mom.

573
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:18,580
- I don't care.
- Mom, I'm having fun.

574
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:19,860
Well, you should have thought about that

575
00:34:19,861 --> 00:34:22,049
- before you hid my stuff.
- I didn't hide it.

576
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:23,949
- Everything okay?
- It's nothing.

577
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:25,589
Yeah, he hides my booze

578
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:28,200
and then acts all ashamed
when I call him on it.

579
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:30,290
- I know you hid it,
you little bastard.
- Hey.

580
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:32,960
No, Mrs. Scavo, it's okay. It's okay.

581
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:34,920
Mom, come on. I'll walk you home.

582
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,760
I... I don't think you should
talk to your son that way.

583
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:44,700
What do you care?

584
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:46,870
Huh? What is he to you,
your pet project?

585
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,430
You feed him a little dinner, Lynette,

586
00:34:49,431 --> 00:34:51,689
and then you let him
play your stupid games.

587
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:54,140
So you can feel good about yourself?

588
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,780
Yeah.

589
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,390
I got your number.

590
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:23,700
I'm out of scotch.

591
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:26,490
I'll buy you some more while I'm out.

592
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:29,480
Got any in your room?

593
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:31,360
No. And stay out of there.

594
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:40,530
Hi, Mrs. Scavo. I'm here to fix your car.

595
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,970
You are so sweet to
remember this. Thank you.

596
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,280
So...

597
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:47,320
how are things at home?

598
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,260
Are the tools in the garage?
I should probably get started.

599
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,510
Yeah.

600
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,260
Okay.

601
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,910
Hey. We got any cake left?

602
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,350
I'm not sure.

603
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:11,080
You okay?

604
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,990
I don't know. I keep
thinking about last night.

605
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:16,830
Mm. Yeah, me, too.

606
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,700
And I'm just so...

607
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,750
livid.

608
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,350
Yeah. That Barbara is
an infuriating woman.

609
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,520
No. Tom, no. I am livid at us...

610
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,760
the way she talked to
Eddie, and we did nothing.

611
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:37,459
I know. But we can't force
her to be nice to her own kid.

612
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,870
That's what everybody always says.

613
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,980
But we all know the woman
is a drunken nightmare.

614
00:36:42,981 --> 00:36:45,769
We complain about her,
we gossip about her,

615
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:49,020
and then we watch her
walk into that house,

616
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:52,460
where we know something bad is happening.

617
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:54,570
But we do nothing.

618
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:57,710
Well...

619
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,550
I'm tired of being one of
the people who does nothing.

620
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,000
Well, Eddie is an adult now.

621
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:07,470
And he can leave whenever he wants.

622
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:10,550
He's probably so damaged,
he doesn't know how to leave.

623
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,970
Where are you going with this?

624
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:19,710
Ma, I'm back from the store.

625
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:22,130
Ma?

626
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:25,720
What is that?

627
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:28,120
Your scrapbook.

628
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:32,830
I don't understand, Eddie.

629
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,889
There are all these
newspaper articles in here

630
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:39,280
about girls in Fairview who have been...

631
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:42,320
strangled or murdered.

632
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:47,300
Why would you collect this stuff?

633
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:53,090
Don't just look down at your feet.

634
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:56,430
You gotta tell me the truth, okay?

635
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,770
Did you have anything to do with...

636
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:02,310
hurting those girls?

637
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,720
Oh, my God.

638
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:14,390
How could you do something
like this? Oh, God.

639
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:17,330
I didn't raise you to... to be like this.

640
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:22,000
Didn't you?

641
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:27,240
What is that supposed to
mean? This is my fault?

642
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:30,430
Look... you're upset.

643
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:35,210
Why don't you sit back down
and have something to drink?

644
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:37,810
You're gonna try to blame this on me.

645
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,410
No way.

646
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,570
Screw you.

647
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:46,810
- What are you doing?
- What do you think I'm doing,

648
00:38:46,811 --> 00:38:49,100
you moron? I'm calling the police!

649
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,810
Don't do that. P... put that down.

650
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:53,649
I always said the worst
mistake I ever made in my life

651
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:54,570
was having you.

652
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:37,390
- Hey, Eddie. Perfect timing.
- Mrs. Scavo, what are you doing here?

653
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:38,479
Are you okay?

654
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,050
Oh, my gosh, you're trembling and...

655
00:39:40,051 --> 00:39:43,020
Oh, yeah, I'm just...
I'm... I was on my way out.

656
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,220
Then I'll make this quick.

657
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,300
Tom and I have been talking, and...

658
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:50,080
we would like it if you
would move in with us.

659
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:53,740
I know it's a big change,

660
00:39:53,741 --> 00:39:55,920
but you've gotta get out of here, Eddie.

661
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,580
This isn't a healthy situation.

662
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,390
Yeah.

663
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,750
I guess it could be better.

664
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,890
Oh, my God.

665
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:13,940
Is she passed out?

666
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:16,549
Yeah.

667
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:18,129
This is what I'm talking about.

668
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:20,339
This is why you need to get out of here.

669
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:21,800
I mean, look at her...

670
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,310
dead drunk.

671
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:26,820
Okay.

672
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:29,590
I'll come live with you.

673
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:33,740
Great. So just pack your
bags and come on over.

674
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:35,050
I hope you like meat loaf.

675
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:38,129
You want me to come in and help you,

676
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:40,010
or do you want me to come
back later to talk to her?

677
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:44,060
Believe me, Mrs. Scavo,
she wouldn't hear a word.

678
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:46,560
Okay.

679
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:58,420
There is a house in the town of Fairview.

680
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:02,880
Inside this house lives a monster...

681
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:07,600
The kind who kills women.

682
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:13,630
You may wonder how a
monster like that came to be.

683
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:16,730
The answer is simple...

684
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:20,010
monsters are created...

685
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,140
by other monsters.
