1
00:00:02,451 --> 00:00:04,938
I'm getting married, and
I don't wanna screw it up,

2
00:00:05,184 --> 00:00:08,761
'cause enough of those screwups,
and you just end up alone.

3
00:00:08,935 --> 00:00:10,661
Gaby discovered that old flames...

4
00:00:10,837 --> 00:00:12,158
Yeah, that can happen.

5
00:00:12,443 --> 00:00:13,689
Can leave embers.

6
00:00:15,042 --> 00:00:17,219
Do you at least know why he steals?

7
00:00:17,362 --> 00:00:20,302
I steal to hurt you.
Bree's tortured marriage...

8
00:00:20,558 --> 00:00:22,240
I'm not your wife anymore,
Orson. I'm your captive.

9
00:00:22,352 --> 00:00:24,744
Don't you feel any remorse at all over that?

10
00:00:24,811 --> 00:00:27,423
Guilt is a small price to pay for happiness.

11
00:00:27,705 --> 00:00:29,758
Led her into an affair with Karl.

12
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:32,053
What happened to the good girl?

13
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,323
She decided guilt's a small
price to pay for happiness.

14
00:00:35,005 --> 00:00:37,341
Lynette revealed a closely guarded secret.

15
00:00:37,486 --> 00:00:38,839
No one else can know about this.

16
00:00:39,624 --> 00:00:41,361
I'm pregnant.

17
00:00:41,562 --> 00:00:42,585
You are?

18
00:00:43,355 --> 00:00:44,671
Something's happened to Julie.

19
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:46,333
And when a crime was committed...

20
00:00:47,246 --> 00:00:49,070
How does a fish get caught?
He opens his mouth.

21
00:00:49,815 --> 00:00:51,498
A suspect emerged.

22
00:01:01,658 --> 00:01:03,251
There's a certain kind of woman

23
00:01:03,338 --> 00:01:04,748
you see in the suburbs.

24
00:01:06,382 --> 00:01:09,369
She waits for the school bus in her bathrobe.

25
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:14,537
She stops by the post office
with curlers in her hair.

26
00:01:16,927 --> 00:01:20,443
She goes to the market in
sweatpants and a t-shirt.

27
00:01:21,883 --> 00:01:24,262
This woman is a housewife,

28
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:27,109
and she doesn't bother
trying to be beautiful

29
00:01:27,853 --> 00:01:28,952
because...

30
00:01:29,831 --> 00:01:31,283
it's a waste of time.

31
00:01:32,206 --> 00:01:33,951
I was trying to hit Celia.

32
00:01:34,058 --> 00:01:35,815
Well, get better aim!

33
00:01:36,608 --> 00:01:38,127
Ana, help me clean this mess.

34
00:01:40,368 --> 00:01:41,967
Don't up your volume on me.

35
00:01:42,093 --> 00:01:44,357
Juanita, finish those vegetables.

36
00:01:44,423 --> 00:01:45,843
Don't make me count to three.

37
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:50,466
Oh, don't give me that look,
you sawed off little... 

38
00:01:50,598 --> 00:01:51,998
Gaby?

39
00:01:55,152 --> 00:01:56,135
Oh, my God.

40
00:01:56,272 --> 00:01:57,542
John. Hi.

41
00:01:57,619 --> 00:02:00,174
Wow. What a surprise.

42
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,167
I was so busy back in the kitchen

43
00:02:02,249 --> 00:02:03,717
I didn't even know you guys were here.

44
00:02:03,827 --> 00:02:06,460
How are you?
Well, I'm usually better

45
00:02:06,568 --> 00:02:08,538
when I don't have creamed spinach all over me.

46
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:12,251
Uh, so... are you working here?

47
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:14,550
Hey, nothing wrong with waitin' tables.

48
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:16,753
Could you get us some more bread?

49
00:02:16,884 --> 00:02:19,601
You know, maybe I could bring
you some dessert on the house.

50
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:22,916
I'll just go ask the owner.
Oh, wait. That's me.

51
00:02:25,116 --> 00:02:26,354
Honestly? You own this place?

52
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:29,354
I bought it with the money I got
in my divorce settlement.

53
00:02:30,425 --> 00:02:32,053
Really? You're divorced?

54
00:02:32,178 --> 00:02:34,445
Yep. Almost a year now.

55
00:02:35,207 --> 00:02:37,574
Oh, my God. Are... are these your kids?

56
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:40,758
Yeah. This is Celia and Juanita,
and this is our niece Ana.

57
00:02:41,512 --> 00:02:42,509
Hello.

58
00:02:42,712 --> 00:02:44,000
Hi.

59
00:02:44,114 --> 00:02:46,298
I can see the family resemblance.

60
00:02:46,484 --> 00:02:47,779
She's my niece.

61
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:49,842
Wow.

62
00:02:49,965 --> 00:02:52,369
It must've been a windy day when
the apple fell from that tree.

63
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:58,288
Well, it was... it was
great seeing you again.

64
00:02:59,111 --> 00:03:00,338
You, too.

65
00:03:01,743 --> 00:03:03,264
Still don't see any bread here.

66
00:03:05,746 --> 00:03:07,229
I'll be right back.

67
00:03:09,186 --> 00:03:10,091
Yes,

68
00:03:10,198 --> 00:03:10,889
there's a certain kind

69
00:03:10,974 --> 00:03:13,684
of woman you only meet in the suburbs.

70
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,826
She will try to look beautiful

71
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:20,733
if she has someone to look beautiful for.

72
00:03:35,538 --> 00:03:36,916
On this street,

73
00:03:37,044 --> 00:03:39,382
the day begins with a cup of coffee.

74
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,354
Most need it to wake up.

75
00:03:44,567 --> 00:03:47,122
Some can't read
their morning paper without it.

76
00:03:48,775 --> 00:03:51,644
A few like to drink it on their way to work.

77
00:03:53,184 --> 00:03:54,480
Then there are those

78
00:03:54,573 --> 00:03:56,982
who just want something
to hold in their hands

79
00:03:57,094 --> 00:03:59,342
while they discuss the neighbors.

80
00:03:59,467 --> 00:04:01,151
Well, Danny had me fooled.

81
00:04:01,237 --> 00:04:02,706
He seemed like a pretty nice kid.

82
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:04,454
Yeah, except for the strangling.

83
00:04:06,282 --> 00:04:10,009
Sorry.
Oh, it's okay. I'm just happy that Julie's safe

84
00:04:10,114 --> 00:04:11,676
and they caught the guy.

85
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:16,372
Uh, Susan.

86
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:29,504
Bob.

87
00:04:30,286 --> 00:04:30,849
Go inside.

88
00:04:31,569 --> 00:04:32,580
Go inside.

89
00:04:34,448 --> 00:04:37,528
Hey, Susan.
I'm confused. The... the last I heard,

90
00:04:37,592 --> 00:04:40,708
the police had Danny Bolen in custody.
Danny was never under arrest.

91
00:04:40,761 --> 00:04:41,974
The police were questioning him,

92
00:04:42,028 --> 00:04:44,932
but they had no grounds to hold him.
Okay, that sounds like his lawyer talking.

93
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:47,311
Are you his lawyer?
Susan, you know how much I love Julie,

94
00:04:47,378 --> 00:04:49,269
but they have no evidence against this kid,

95
00:04:49,358 --> 00:04:53,324
and I couldn't just let him sit there.
If he didn't do it, why would
need to fake his alibi?

96
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:56,403
Because he's a kid and he was scared.
Angie, this is not a good idea.

97
00:04:56,506 --> 00:04:58,656
I... I just gotta say this. Susan, please.

98
00:04:58,718 --> 00:05:00,358
I can't even imagine what
you've been going through.

99
00:05:02,487 --> 00:05:05,424
I am begging you, as
my friend and neighbor,

100
00:05:05,523 --> 00:05:07,271
don't defend him.

101
00:05:08,245 --> 00:05:10,213
Susan, it's my job.

102
00:05:12,409 --> 00:05:14,412
Then I don't know how you sleep at night.

103
00:05:15,339 --> 00:05:16,414
Susan, wait.

104
00:05:16,537 --> 00:05:18,305
Come on. Can... can we
please just talk about this?

105
00:05:18,395 --> 00:05:19,969
We can go inside, just the two of us.

106
00:05:20,676 --> 00:05:21,621
No.

107
00:05:22,425 --> 00:05:23,514
You wanna talk about this?

108
00:05:23,571 --> 00:05:26,090
Let's do it out here in the
open. Hey, everybody!

109
00:05:27,643 --> 00:05:30,017
Her son tried to kill my daughter.

110
00:05:30,093 --> 00:05:33,416
And while he's here,
nobody on this street is safe.

111
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:45,350
What is this?

112
00:05:45,471 --> 00:05:47,192
Bacon and cheese burrito.

113
00:05:48,665 --> 00:05:51,202
You couldn't find any croissants
or pain au chocolat?

114
00:05:51,324 --> 00:05:53,508
Sweetie, we're at a motor lodge
on the interstate.

115
00:05:53,591 --> 00:05:55,139
I was lucky to find a burrito.

116
00:05:55,252 --> 00:05:57,864
People always talk about
the moral hazards of cheating.

117
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,444
No one warns you about the food.

118
00:06:04,347 --> 00:06:06,595
Mmm.
Mmm.

119
00:06:06,665 --> 00:06:09,588
So you want me to book
this place for tomorrow?
Mm, sorry, I have an event.

120
00:06:11,054 --> 00:06:12,692
Oh, wait. You know, I think I do, too.

121
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,795
How's this then? We'll go
to Vegas for the weekend?

122
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:18,482
Las Vegas?

123
00:06:18,601 --> 00:06:19,718
Why not?

124
00:06:19,855 --> 00:06:21,166
I'll lose my shirt in the casino,

125
00:06:21,294 --> 00:06:23,222
and then we'll head upstairs,
and you can lose yours.

126
00:06:25,216 --> 00:06:27,833
I can't disappear for a whole weekend.

127
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:30,232
My husband would notice.
Say you're visiting family.

128
00:06:30,359 --> 00:06:32,402
Karl!

129
00:06:33,817 --> 00:06:37,330
I'm sorry, but I don't see us
having romantic getaways.

130
00:06:40,712 --> 00:06:41,500
That's the sort of thing

131
00:06:41,606 --> 00:06:43,744
a woman does with a
man she's in love with.

132
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:49,876
And we don't have those
kinds of feelings. I get it.

133
00:06:49,986 --> 00:06:51,571
But you are a delightful diversion.

134
00:06:51,675 --> 00:06:53,648
And in order to keep things delightful,

135
00:06:53,722 --> 00:06:54,563
I think it's best

136
00:06:54,636 --> 00:06:56,812
we not put unreasonable
demands on each other.

137
00:06:57,654 --> 00:06:59,080
Okay. Fine.

138
00:07:03,107 --> 00:07:05,058
You could've said, "pass the sugar."

139
00:07:06,668 --> 00:07:08,168
I didn't want to make a demand.

140
00:07:11,362 --> 00:07:13,477
So... I know you guys have been concerned

141
00:07:13,627 --> 00:07:15,215
'cause I've been so sick in the mornings.

142
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,422
Well, I wanted to let you know why.

143
00:07:18,967 --> 00:07:20,487
I'm pregnant with twins.

144
00:07:26,075 --> 00:07:29,317
Well, now that the celebration's
over, any questions?

145
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:32,819
Yeah. Aren't you gonna be,
like, the world's oldest mom?

146
00:07:33,315 --> 00:07:36,119
No. There's a woman in Mongolia
who's got me beat.

147
00:07:36,527 --> 00:07:38,073
Any other questions?

148
00:07:38,185 --> 00:07:39,516
I have more of a statement.

149
00:07:42,013 --> 00:07:44,612
You two are so irresponsible.

150
00:07:44,721 --> 00:07:46,645
You should've been using birth control.

151
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,035
You're in college.

152
00:07:50,113 --> 00:07:52,214
Do you know what the odds
are now that you'll graduate?

153
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,729
Like, zero.

154
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:57,307
You... you have a new job,
one that you'll have to quit

155
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,586
Once the baby comes.
So I hope you're both happy.

156
00:07:59,702 --> 00:08:00,862
You've just destroyed your futures

157
00:08:00,951 --> 00:08:02,839
for a few minutes of pleasure.

158
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,102
Not to mention, it's so gross
you're still doing it.

159
00:08:15,268 --> 00:08:18,262
Penny, you're excited about this, right?

160
00:08:18,337 --> 00:08:20,770
Yeah, getting two little babies to play with.

161
00:08:20,855 --> 00:08:24,257
If they're boys, I'm outta here.

162
00:08:31,283 --> 00:08:32,249
You have to understand,

163
00:08:32,314 --> 00:08:33,701
even though they've released Danny,

164
00:08:33,952 --> 00:08:35,440
it doesn't mean he's not still a suspect.

165
00:08:35,798 --> 00:08:36,967
So what do we do?

166
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,485
Well, the police are gonna start
digging into your background,

167
00:08:40,174 --> 00:08:41,950
so I need to know what they're gonna find.

168
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,235
You're from New York, right?

169
00:08:45,828 --> 00:08:46,792
Yeah.

170
00:08:47,008 --> 00:08:49,165
But instead of wasting your time
poking around in the past,

171
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:51,454
you just need to back up Danny's story.

172
00:08:51,547 --> 00:08:54,375
Right, just check out the liquor
stores, see if anyone saw him.
I will,

173
00:08:54,465 --> 00:08:56,427
but the police are gonna talk to
people in your old neighborhood,

174
00:08:56,507 --> 00:08:58,858
see if he's got any run-ins
with the law, with girls.

175
00:09:00,262 --> 00:09:02,808
Is there anything I need to know, Danny?
Nope.

176
00:09:03,595 --> 00:09:04,885
Not a thing.

177
00:09:08,563 --> 00:09:11,292
Okay... but I still need
to establish character.

178
00:09:11,403 --> 00:09:14,645
So I'll need to get in touch
with some old teachers, friends.

179
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:16,572
Nah, you don't need to do all that.

180
00:09:19,255 --> 00:09:20,763
Look, what are we doing here?

181
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:23,764
I can't defend a client
I know nothing about.

182
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,960
Why can't you answer just
a few simple questions?

183
00:09:26,045 --> 00:09:29,400
You wanna know why?
Because this family has secrets!
Danny.

184
00:09:29,621 --> 00:09:31,530
Big dark secrets that we can't talk about,

185
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:32,966
not even to our lawyer.

186
00:09:33,026 --> 00:09:36,672
You know, who cares if it makes
me look guilty, even if I'm not?
Knock it off!

187
00:09:42,662 --> 00:09:44,710
This conversation was privileged, right?

188
00:09:53,723 --> 00:09:54,758
So I don't know if you heard,

189
00:09:54,829 --> 00:09:57,741
but this morning the police
released Danny Bolen.

190
00:09:57,857 --> 00:10:00,141
I heard. You must be worried sick.
I am.

191
00:10:00,244 --> 00:10:03,505
Clearly, he's unstable. Who
knows what he might do next?

192
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:05,588
So what are we gonna do about it?

193
00:10:06,176 --> 00:10:08,526
You ever hear about
that old man on Maple Drive?

194
00:10:09,617 --> 00:10:12,033
People found out he used to be
an accountant for the Nazis,

195
00:10:12,128 --> 00:10:14,477
and they threw garbage all over his yard.

196
00:10:14,638 --> 00:10:16,530
That's right. And he moved.

197
00:10:16,878 --> 00:10:17,891
But then it was bought

198
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:20,191
by some ex-hippie who
painted the house pink,

199
00:10:20,276 --> 00:10:22,549
so it was a pyrrhic victory at best.

200
00:10:24,496 --> 00:10:25,970
Well, look, I'm just bringing this up

201
00:10:26,034 --> 00:10:27,461
because I don't want people on this street

202
00:10:27,561 --> 00:10:29,340
thinking that they're safe when they're not.

203
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:31,511
Susan.

204
00:10:32,226 --> 00:10:34,280
Hey, uh, could you
give me a hand for a sec?

205
00:10:38,718 --> 00:10:39,999
Honey, what are you doing?

206
00:10:40,985 --> 00:10:43,863
Mona Clarke's got a big mouth.
If you get her worked up,

207
00:10:44,308 --> 00:10:46,237
she's gonna tabout Danny to
everybody in the neighborhood.

208
00:10:46,344 --> 00:10:50,799
So?
So we don't want an angry mob
showing up at the Bolens' house,

209
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,594
especially if we aren't even sure

210
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,248
Danny's the one that attacked Julie.

211
00:10:54,364 --> 00:10:56,444
He lied about his alibi.

212
00:10:56,534 --> 00:10:58,473
Why would he do that if he was innocent?

213
00:10:58,913 --> 00:10:59,973
Well...

214
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:01,893
that's a good point.

215
00:11:01,963 --> 00:11:03,269
And how can I live with myself

216
00:11:03,369 --> 00:11:05,360
if someone else's daughter gets attacked,

217
00:11:05,443 --> 00:11:09,337
and I have said nothing?
Okay. Okay, I get it.

218
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:10,810
It's just, this whole thing would be a lot easier

219
00:11:10,893 --> 00:11:12,480
if the police just had some proof.

220
00:11:16,349 --> 00:11:17,936
Well, maybe we should get them some.

221
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:23,400
Is there anything I can help you with?

222
00:11:23,473 --> 00:11:24,979
No, I think everything fine. Uh...

223
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:30,620
John.

224
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,118
Hey.

225
00:11:33,233 --> 00:11:35,517
I wanted to talk to you about something.

226
00:11:35,667 --> 00:11:38,726
I thought I should do it
in person, out of respect.

227
00:11:40,562 --> 00:11:41,725
Uh-huh.

228
00:11:45,629 --> 00:11:47,123
Your niece came to my restaurant.

229
00:11:47,257 --> 00:11:49,433
She asked me for a hostessing job.

230
00:11:49,549 --> 00:11:51,331
And I think she'd be great.

231
00:11:51,758 --> 00:11:53,143
You know, but given our history,

232
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,601
I wanted to make sure
you were okay with it.

233
00:11:57,275 --> 00:11:58,807
Because I wouldn't do it

234
00:11:58,865 --> 00:12:00,548
if it would make you feel uncomfortable.

235
00:12:00,623 --> 00:12:02,848
I mean, that's the last thing I'd want.

236
00:12:02,954 --> 00:12:06,678
Like I said, given our... history.

237
00:12:06,785 --> 00:12:08,868
Yeah.

238
00:12:08,972 --> 00:12:11,104
Why don't you stop saying,
"given our history"

239
00:12:11,229 --> 00:12:13,035
and just say, "I banged your wife"?

240
00:12:15,783 --> 00:12:17,736
You know, it's not that
I haven't forgiven you.

241
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,514
It's just that every time I see you,

242
00:12:19,663 --> 00:12:21,811
I wanna put my fist in your face.

243
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,831
Now did you park in the building?

244
00:12:25,908 --> 00:12:27,393
'Cause we validate.

245
00:12:28,258 --> 00:12:29,438
You know what?

246
00:12:29,547 --> 00:12:31,411
I think this was a bad idea.

247
00:12:31,536 --> 00:12:34,703
Besides, Gaby probably
wouldn't have liked it anyway.

248
00:12:37,217 --> 00:12:38,218
What?

249
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,698
Come on.

250
00:12:39,772 --> 00:12:41,454
I mean, her niece working for me... 

251
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,088
I think she would've freaked out.

252
00:12:44,228 --> 00:12:45,918
You know...

253
00:12:46,604 --> 00:12:47,675
given our history.

254
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:52,687
John?

255
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,299
Hold on a second.

256
00:12:58,363 --> 00:13:01,223
Ana working for John? Are you nuts?

257
00:13:01,608 --> 00:13:04,048
You're the one who's been saying
she should get a job.

258
00:13:04,146 --> 00:13:07,219
Yeah, at the mall hocking soft pretzels,

259
00:13:07,294 --> 00:13:08,588
not working for...

260
00:13:09,424 --> 00:13:10,758
Your ex-lover?

261
00:13:10,872 --> 00:13:12,402
Well, yeah.

262
00:13:12,482 --> 00:13:14,471
How can you not think it's awkward?

263
00:13:14,606 --> 00:13:17,985
Because that was years ago.
We're past all that, right?

264
00:13:18,732 --> 00:13:20,478
Of course we are.

265
00:13:20,609 --> 00:13:23,600
It's just... the whole thing
makes me uncomfortable.

266
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:25,825
I'm sorry. I'm gonna have to say no.

267
00:13:25,941 --> 00:13:28,379
I knew it. You're jealous.

268
00:13:29,182 --> 00:13:30,917
Jealous? Of who?

269
00:13:30,996 --> 00:13:34,056
Your beautiful niece
working for your ex-lover.

270
00:13:34,119 --> 00:13:36,696
What?!
You still have the hots for him.

271
00:13:36,776 --> 00:13:38,977
Oh, don't deny it.
I saw you.

272
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,429
"Really? You're divorced?"

273
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:48,418
Okay. First of all, you just
reminded me why I hate mimes.

274
00:13:48,497 --> 00:13:50,949
Secondly, is that why you're
letting Ana work for John?

275
00:13:51,006 --> 00:13:52,167
You were testing me?

276
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,605
Yeah, and you failed.

277
00:13:53,671 --> 00:13:55,469
Carlos, you are way out of line.

278
00:13:55,531 --> 00:13:57,794
Deny it all you want,
but I know what I saw.

279
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,433
You wanted to look pretty
for your ex-lover.

280
00:14:01,738 --> 00:14:02,827
Well... 

281
00:14:03,622 --> 00:14:05,400
You know, he was also my ex-gardener.

282
00:14:05,475 --> 00:14:07,137
Can't you call him that?

283
00:14:10,734 --> 00:14:14,266
It's so long since I've
seen you two together.

284
00:14:14,323 --> 00:14:16,143
I was starting to wonder if you'd split up.

285
00:14:16,172 --> 00:14:18,431
Oh! No, we're still married.

286
00:14:18,484 --> 00:14:20,665
No, just try getting away from this one!

287
00:14:21,845 --> 00:14:24,812
Arm.
Bree, I know you're unhappy,

288
00:14:24,866 --> 00:14:26,135
but we haven't been out in months.

289
00:14:26,181 --> 00:14:27,852
Could you at least make
an effort for one night?

290
00:14:33,611 --> 00:14:35,245
You are absolutely right.

291
00:14:35,297 --> 00:14:37,727
Why don't you get me
one of those crab puffs,

292
00:14:37,789 --> 00:14:40,208
and then we'll mingle?
Sweetheart, this is just what I'm... 

293
00:14:40,282 --> 00:14:41,632
Crab puff.

294
00:14:44,056 --> 00:14:45,046
Karl!

295
00:14:45,845 --> 00:14:47,570
Bree? What are you doing here?

296
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,021
What do you mean?
Are you following me?

297
00:14:50,099 --> 00:14:52,556
No. I'm a member of the club.

298
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,780
I... I had no idea that this was the event

299
00:14:54,873 --> 00:14:57,263
that you were talking about.
Oh, so you expect me to believe

300
00:14:57,345 --> 00:15:00,977
that you showed up at a dinner dance alone?
No, I... actually, I... 

301
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:02,615
Karl, I know you have feelings for me,

302
00:15:02,692 --> 00:15:04,601
but I would hate to see them
turn into some kind of...

303
00:15:04,658 --> 00:15:06,134
Obsession.

304
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:08,877
Hey, hon. Find our table?

305
00:15:12,421 --> 00:15:13,576
A... and you were saying?

306
00:15:17,534 --> 00:15:19,689
So, Karl, aren't you going to introduce me?

307
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,241
This is Candace. She's an old friend.

308
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:24,698
Oh, don't you mean that you're her old friend?

309
00:15:26,075 --> 00:15:28,281
Candace, why don't we
go find our table, huh?

310
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,796
Bree, if we don't run
 into you again... good.

311
00:15:30,895 --> 00:15:32,902
He doesn't mean to be brusque.

312
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,662
He's just a little eager
to rush through dinner...

313
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,293
So we can get to the motor lodge.

314
00:15:40,204 --> 00:15:41,409
Motor lodge?

315
00:15:41,487 --> 00:15:43,900
He wanted to go earlier, but I said no.

316
00:15:43,963 --> 00:15:45,296
Lobster first,

317
00:15:46,256 --> 00:15:48,172
then "dessert."

318
00:15:50,186 --> 00:15:51,110
Candace, why don't we start

319
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:53,180
putting that lobster
in your mouth right now?

320
00:15:53,261 --> 00:15:54,717
Goodbye, Bree.

321
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:57,588
Candace?

322
00:15:57,739 --> 00:16:00,792
Dr. Hodge!
Oh, jeez.

323
00:16:00,864 --> 00:16:04,175
You two know each other?
Yes, Candace was
a dental patient of mine.

324
00:16:04,251 --> 00:16:07,040
Still think of you every time
I put in my night guard.

325
00:16:07,918 --> 00:16:09,479
Listen, there's room at our table.

326
00:16:09,534 --> 00:16:13,724
Would you care to join us?
No! I mean, we're going
to be leaving soon.

327
00:16:13,813 --> 00:16:15,785
You know, that motor lodge can wait.

328
00:16:15,877 --> 00:16:17,862
That way, Orson and Candace can catch up,

329
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:19,855
and you and I can have a little talk, too.

330
00:16:21,192 --> 00:16:22,891
Sure. That sounds like fun.

331
00:16:22,997 --> 00:16:25,564
Karl and I will just go get
a couple apple martinis,

332
00:16:25,633 --> 00:16:26,964
and we'll come right back.

333
00:16:34,049 --> 00:16:35,530
Lovely girl, isn't she?

334
00:16:36,836 --> 00:16:37,626
Hmm.

335
00:16:37,744 --> 00:16:40,367
Her two front teeth?

336
00:16:40,568 --> 00:16:42,066
Veneers.

337
00:16:42,147 --> 00:16:43,232
I'm guessing those aren't

338
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,013
her only side by side enhancements.

339
00:16:45,808 --> 00:16:47,471
She's actually very sweet.

340
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:50,366
Shame to see her mixed up
with a dog like Karl.

341
00:16:50,436 --> 00:16:52,796
You have to pity any woman
who makes that mistake.

342
00:16:54,228 --> 00:16:55,720
Yes, you do.

343
00:17:13,124 --> 00:17:15,191
Susan?
Oh! Shh! Shh!

344
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:17,064
Get in! Get in! Get in! Get in!

345
00:17:23,424 --> 00:17:25,254
What are you doing?
Stay low!

346
00:17:26,848 --> 00:17:28,568
Oh! Okay, let's try that again.
What are you doing?

347
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,020
Surveillance.

348
00:17:30,105 --> 00:17:32,003
I am gonna nail that Danny Bolen kid.

349
00:17:33,854 --> 00:17:35,568
I... I thought the police were... 

350
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:36,956
The police are useless.

351
00:17:37,062 --> 00:17:39,573
So I'm keeping a log of
all his comings and goings.

352
00:17:39,652 --> 00:17:42,560
If he leaves, and another girl gets attacked,

353
00:17:42,667 --> 00:17:45,188
he won't be able to lie and say he was home.

354
00:17:46,879 --> 00:17:49,609
Well... I got a few minutes to kill.

355
00:17:56,615 --> 00:17:58,466
Oh, by the way, I was gonna call you.

356
00:17:58,823 --> 00:18:01,853
You haven't told Gaby
I'm pregnant, have you?
No. Why?

357
00:18:01,953 --> 00:18:05,428
Well, I haven't had a
chance to tell Carlos yet,

358
00:18:05,518 --> 00:18:07,785
and I really think he should hear it from me... 
Get down!

359
00:18:07,844 --> 00:18:09,562
Oh!

360
00:18:16,697 --> 00:18:18,243
You think I'm nuts, don't you?

361
00:18:19,151 --> 00:18:20,162
No.

362
00:18:20,246 --> 00:18:21,802
I think you're a mother.

363
00:18:21,894 --> 00:18:24,323
Thank you.

364
00:18:24,725 --> 00:18:27,488
Although speaking as a fellow mother...

365
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,285
Do you remember
what happened to Porter?

366
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:33,343
Everyone in town was so sure

367
00:18:33,451 --> 00:18:36,712
he set that fire and killed those people.

368
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:41,010
People can be sure,
and they can be wrong.

369
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,488
I'm not wrong.

370
00:18:47,523 --> 00:18:48,759
Okay.

371
00:18:55,152 --> 00:18:58,761
What are you doing?
Following him. Buckle up.

372
00:18:58,848 --> 00:19:01,643
No, I can't! I have to put
a meatloaf in the oven! Oh!

373
00:19:01,716 --> 00:19:03,104
Oh!

374
00:19:07,381 --> 00:19:08,832
Wait! Wait! I forgot my... 

375
00:19:19,788 --> 00:19:21,682
So, Candace, what do you do for a living?

376
00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:23,160
I'm a dancer.

377
00:19:23,301 --> 00:19:26,964
Oh, what kind? Jazz? Ballet? Lap?

378
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:30,561
Actually, Candace was a rockette.

379
00:19:30,614 --> 00:19:34,080
Oh! It must've been exhausting

380
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:36,506
Spending so much time
with your legs in the air.

381
00:19:39,954 --> 00:19:41,905
I... love this song.

382
00:19:41,996 --> 00:19:43,755
Bree... would you care to dance?

383
00:19:43,813 --> 00:19:47,536
Sorry, my shoes are killing me.
Ask Candace. She's the pro.

384
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,297
I'd love to.

385
00:19:52,878 --> 00:19:54,537
Have fun, you two!

386
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:56,166
You loathsome pig.

387
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,982
You're supposed to be cheating
with me, not on me.

388
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:01,048
I asked if you were free.
You weren't. I called Candace.

389
00:20:01,127 --> 00:20:02,746
What's the problem?

390
00:20:02,797 --> 00:20:05,346
Well, it's just that she's so... cheap.

391
00:20:05,485 --> 00:20:06,810
She's beneath you.

392
00:20:07,698 --> 00:20:09,634
Not yet, but she will be.

393
00:20:13,869 --> 00:20:15,082
Bravo!

394
00:20:15,638 --> 00:20:16,945
Well done!

395
00:20:16,995 --> 00:20:19,103
If her dress were any lower, it'd be a belt.

396
00:20:19,165 --> 00:20:21,396
Gosh, Bree, could this
be jealousy I'm hearing?

397
00:20:21,459 --> 00:20:23,645
I'm not jealous. I'm appalled.
And as long as we're together,

398
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:25,794
I will not have you running
around with other women.

399
00:20:25,863 --> 00:20:29,874
But we're not together.
I'm just a diversion, remember?

400
00:20:29,998 --> 00:20:32,483
A little fling to spice up an afternoon.

401
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,609
And if that's all I am to you, fine.

402
00:20:34,676 --> 00:20:35,763
But you don't get to say

403
00:20:35,849 --> 00:20:37,942
What I can do when the afternoon's over.

404
00:20:38,762 --> 00:20:40,653
Are you gonna take her
to our motor lodge tonight?

405
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,169
Just try and stop me.

406
00:21:02,114 --> 00:21:03,183
Excuse me.

407
00:21:03,244 --> 00:21:05,076
Someone over at the table
was looking for you.

408
00:21:24,845 --> 00:21:26,191
What the hell happened here?

409
00:21:26,267 --> 00:21:27,812
Ooh! Uh, Orson tripped.

410
00:21:27,878 --> 00:21:29,311
Really, sweetheart. You
need to be more careful.

411
00:21:29,342 --> 00:21:31,726
Oh, I'm so sorry. The floor was slippery.

412
00:21:33,561 --> 00:21:34,793
Are you all right?

413
00:21:34,863 --> 00:21:36,451
I think I broke my nose.

414
00:21:36,546 --> 00:21:38,197
I should go to the emergency room.

415
00:21:38,253 --> 00:21:42,070
Oh, dear. And you had such
lovely plans for the evening.

416
00:21:50,321 --> 00:21:52,853
Hey, Janice. Is Carlos done
with his meeting yet?

417
00:21:52,929 --> 00:21:54,529
I really need to talk to him.

418
00:21:55,802 --> 00:21:56,971
Got a sec?

419
00:21:57,721 --> 00:21:58,858
Never mind.

420
00:22:03,552 --> 00:22:04,465
Something wrong?

421
00:22:05,165 --> 00:22:05,815
How would you like

422
00:22:05,846 --> 00:22:07,537
a parking space closer to the entrance?

423
00:22:07,587 --> 00:22:11,695
I'd love it.
You closed the door for that?
No, I closed the door

424
00:22:11,764 --> 00:22:14,363
to ask if you would like
to be my new senior V.P.

425
00:22:15,717 --> 00:22:17,184
Seriously?

426
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:21,514
Oh... God.

427
00:22:21,598 --> 00:22:24,836
Carlos, I am... so flattered.

428
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:27,813
And I would love to say yes. It's just... 

429
00:22:27,897 --> 00:22:31,025
I know. More responsibility,
more hours away from home.

430
00:22:31,098 --> 00:22:33,351
But you get a company car
and an expense account.

431
00:22:33,432 --> 00:22:36,529
Which is very generous, but I
still can't accept because...

432
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:38,159
And a 50% salary bump.

433
00:22:38,226 --> 00:22:42,090
Because it doesn't have a 50% salary bump.

434
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,218
But now that it does, I'm in.

435
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:45,996
When do I start?
Tonight.

436
00:22:46,075 --> 00:22:47,813
We're having dinner
with a big potential client.

437
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:50,726
He is bringing his wife,
so please bring Tom.

438
00:22:50,784 --> 00:22:51,952
Sure.

439
00:22:54,322 --> 00:22:55,274
Wait.

440
00:22:56,203 --> 00:22:58,351
Weren't you gonna
give this promotion to Judy?

441
00:22:59,641 --> 00:23:00,932
I was.

442
00:23:01,025 --> 00:23:02,570
But between you and me,

443
00:23:02,635 --> 00:23:04,684
I found out she's pregnant.

444
00:23:06,069 --> 00:23:07,255
Overheard her on the phone.

445
00:23:07,311 --> 00:23:08,497
I saw what was coming... 

446
00:23:08,556 --> 00:23:10,716
doctor's visits, sick days, maternity leave.

447
00:23:10,767 --> 00:23:14,396
Yeah, that can be annoying.

448
00:23:14,445 --> 00:23:16,487
But isn't denying a woman a promotion

449
00:23:16,538 --> 00:23:20,121
because she's pregnant a tiny bit illegal?

450
00:23:20,854 --> 00:23:22,228
Only if she finds out.

451
00:23:22,388 --> 00:23:24,708
And, I mean, who's gonna
tell her... my new senior V.P.?

452
00:23:24,756 --> 00:23:26,323
Hell, no.

453
00:23:26,384 --> 00:23:29,450
She's too busy thinking about
that big bump she's got coming.

454
00:23:40,476 --> 00:23:41,556
Yes?

455
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:46,119
I've been thinking about last night,

456
00:23:46,905 --> 00:23:48,869
and you, Karl, Candy...

457
00:23:49,621 --> 00:23:52,128
and it finally hit me
what was really going on.

458
00:23:53,711 --> 00:23:55,059
What are you talking about?

459
00:23:55,153 --> 00:23:57,347
The oil on the dance floor... 

460
00:23:58,082 --> 00:23:59,947
that was no accident. You put it there.

461
00:23:59,997 --> 00:24:02,213
You wanted Candy to fall.

462
00:24:03,591 --> 00:24:04,746
That's ridiculous.

463
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,183
Admit it.

464
00:24:06,212 --> 00:24:07,402
You were jealous of that girl

465
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:10,558
from the moment Karl walked in with her.
Orson, you're not making any sense.

466
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,983
Why would I be jealous of Karl's date?

467
00:24:13,102 --> 00:24:16,591
Because she was dancing with me, of course.

468
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:21,290
I... I suppose I should be mad at you

469
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:23,889
for nearly breaking my
neck, but I'm too relieved.

470
00:24:24,616 --> 00:24:26,045
Relieved?

471
00:24:26,111 --> 00:24:28,197
Yes, if watching me
dance with a pretty girl

472
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,514
can make you that crazy,

473
00:24:29,557 --> 00:24:31,655
then you obviously still care for me.

474
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,237
There's still hope for us.

475
00:24:33,314 --> 00:24:36,973
Orson, you are reading way
too much into one impulsive act.

476
00:24:37,023 --> 00:24:40,045
Ohh, argue all you like.

477
00:24:40,113 --> 00:24:41,601
A woman doesn't pull a stunt like that

478
00:24:41,712 --> 00:24:43,518
over a man she's not in love with.

479
00:25:01,857 --> 00:25:03,225
Karl? Hi, it's Bree.

480
00:25:03,281 --> 00:25:05,557
Um, I am thinking...

481
00:25:06,376 --> 00:25:09,531
maybe I'm ready for that
weekend in Las Vegas.

482
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:21,962
Hi, Mrs. Bolen.

483
00:25:22,152 --> 00:25:24,261
I'm a friend of Danny's
from school. Is he in?

484
00:25:24,406 --> 00:25:27,159
You got a name?
Sorry. Eddie.

485
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:29,465
Danny! There's an Eddie here.

486
00:25:36,685 --> 00:25:38,139
It's a nice house.

487
00:25:39,544 --> 00:25:40,844
You know what happened here, right?

488
00:25:40,904 --> 00:25:42,300
Huh? Oh, yeah.

489
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,697
What are you gonna do?

490
00:25:47,405 --> 00:25:49,341
Hey. What's up?
Hey. My brakes are shot.

491
00:25:49,442 --> 00:25:51,132
Is there any chance you
could take a look at 'em?

492
00:25:51,213 --> 00:25:54,551
Nah. I... I don't feel like it, Eddie.

493
00:25:54,627 --> 00:25:56,472
Come on. You've been moping
around the house all day.

494
00:25:56,528 --> 00:25:58,237
Go. Help your buddy.

495
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:01,645
Okay.

496
00:26:05,816 --> 00:26:07,435
I'm glad one of us has a friend.

497
00:26:10,052 --> 00:26:11,294
I was  the supermarket earlier.

498
00:26:11,387 --> 00:26:12,991
Everybody was looking at me

499
00:26:13,101 --> 00:26:15,228
like I had their grandmother in my trunk.

500
00:26:15,386 --> 00:26:18,353
Yeah. While you were out,
three hate calls in one hour.

501
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,068
I don't know. I'm startin' to think

502
00:26:22,168 --> 00:26:24,209
it's time to get out
of the Bolen business.

503
00:26:29,524 --> 00:26:30,642
No.

504
00:26:30,749 --> 00:26:33,041
We cannot change our names and run

505
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,715
every time there's a little trouble.

506
00:26:34,867 --> 00:26:36,961
This is more than a little trouble, babe.

507
00:26:39,383 --> 00:26:40,816
I don't care.

508
00:26:40,874 --> 00:26:43,128
We are not putting Danny
through all that again.

509
00:26:44,715 --> 00:26:46,989
And maybe this hasn't worked
out they way we'd hoped.

510
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:51,381
But until I say otherwise,
we are Nick and Angie Bolen.

511
00:27:18,521 --> 00:27:20,634
Hey, can you go into the... the basement

512
00:27:20,726 --> 00:27:21,937
and get me a work light?

513
00:27:22,419 --> 00:27:23,910
Yeah.
Thanks.

514
00:27:28,818 --> 00:27:30,026
Got a second?

515
00:27:32,141 --> 00:27:33,191
Sure.

516
00:27:35,949 --> 00:27:38,688
I'm really sorry about what happened to Julie.

517
00:27:38,785 --> 00:27:41,847
Thanks. Actually, that's what
I wanted to talk to you about.

518
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:45,147
I didn't hurt her,
mrs. Delfino.

519
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,591
But you did fight with her.
I mean, Mrs. McCluskey saw you.

520
00:27:51,729 --> 00:27:53,323
What were you fighting with her about?

521
00:27:55,066 --> 00:27:57,040
I'm sorry. That lawyer told me

522
00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:00,177
that I shouldn't talk to
anybody about this stuff.

523
00:28:04,185 --> 00:28:05,977
I know that Julie thought she was pregnant.

524
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:10,189
What?

525
00:28:10,285 --> 00:28:12,294
You didn't think I knew that, right?

526
00:28:14,803 --> 00:28:18,602
Is that what you... fought about?
Um, I didn't know.

527
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:22,232
Is that why you attacked my daughter?
No, I... I didn't even know that.

528
00:28:22,302 --> 00:28:23,592
You're lying.
No, I'm not.

529
00:28:23,661 --> 00:28:25,586
You're lying!
Please, just leave me alone.

530
00:28:39,261 --> 00:28:43,981
Hey! What are you doing?

531
00:28:44,086 --> 00:28:46,892
I know that you did it.
I can see it in your eyes!

532
00:28:47,922 --> 00:28:50,048
Mom! Dad! Help me!

533
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,186
Just admit that you did it!
Admit it! Admit it to me!

534
00:28:52,273 --> 00:28:53,572
Mrs. Delfino, please.

535
00:28:53,624 --> 00:28:56,341
Hey! Get the hell away from him!
Oh, are you gonna attack me?

536
00:28:59,539 --> 00:29:00,423
Hey!

537
00:29:00,485 --> 00:29:02,676
What the hell is wrong with you?
He did it! You know that he... 

538
00:29:02,756 --> 00:29:05,892
Ma! Careful!

539
00:29:05,989 --> 00:29:08,230
You come near him again,
I swear I will kill you.

540
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,934
You can't protect him forever.

541
00:29:10,011 --> 00:29:14,034
People know what he is now,
and he's gonna be punished.

542
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:27,275
Hey!

543
00:29:28,698 --> 00:29:30,408
What the hell happened to my car?

544
00:29:37,054 --> 00:29:38,363
Hi, uncle Carlos.

545
00:29:38,397 --> 00:29:40,517
Your clients are here.
I put him at our best table.
Thank you, sweetie.

546
00:29:41,257 --> 00:29:42,454
Lynette?
Yeah?

547
00:29:42,551 --> 00:29:44,213
Are you sure about this?

548
00:29:45,017 --> 00:29:48,356
About being senior V.P.
with a 50% salary bump?

549
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:52,059
Uh, yeah.
But did you hear the way
he described the job in the car?

550
00:29:52,106 --> 00:29:53,960
I mean, it sounds like a killer schedule.

551
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:57,230
I can handle it. And you get to stay in school.

552
00:29:57,303 --> 00:29:59,031
Remember your big dream? Our future?

553
00:29:59,084 --> 00:30:01,944
Of course. But how are we
gonna keep it a secret?

554
00:30:02,001 --> 00:30:04,241
Carlos is gonna find out
about this thing eventually.

555
00:30:04,334 --> 00:30:08,044
By then, I will have proved
I can do the job,

556
00:30:08,158 --> 00:30:09,816
pregnant or not.

557
00:30:11,533 --> 00:30:12,542
Please?

558
00:30:12,841 --> 00:30:13,994
Okay. I'm in.

559
00:30:14,211 --> 00:30:16,242
But you gotta prove it fast.

560
00:30:16,328 --> 00:30:18,225
Remember last time you were
pregnant with twins?

561
00:30:18,297 --> 00:30:20,532
Every part of you swelled up.

562
00:30:20,605 --> 00:30:21,968
It was like sleeping next to a body

563
00:30:22,044 --> 00:30:23,590
they dragged out of the river.

564
00:30:24,528 --> 00:30:25,934
You said I was beautiful.

565
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:28,246
I had to. You were twice my size.

566
00:30:29,852 --> 00:30:32,053
This is a 2004 Barolo

567
00:30:32,146 --> 00:30:33,961
from my vineyard in Piedmont.

568
00:30:34,076 --> 00:30:35,347
Your vineyard?

569
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:37,216
Yeah. That's why I insisted on this restaurant.

570
00:30:37,314 --> 00:30:39,138
Ey, uh, Carry Myel.

571
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:43,434
I love business, but wine is my passion.

572
00:30:43,537 --> 00:30:45,344
Oh, none for me tonight.

573
00:30:46,281 --> 00:30:47,681
Why not?

574
00:30:48,838 --> 00:30:52,426
Well... I wanna keep my
head clear for business.

575
00:30:52,532 --> 00:30:53,849
No. No business talk.

576
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:56,437
Tonight is about getting to know each other

577
00:30:56,535 --> 00:30:57,870
over good food and fine wine.

578
00:30:58,809 --> 00:31:00,916
Yeah, Lynette, his wine.

579
00:31:01,009 --> 00:31:02,527
So drink up.

580
00:31:04,633 --> 00:31:06,264
Well, I guess a little wouldn't hurt.

581
00:31:14,276 --> 00:31:15,474
So...

582
00:31:15,553 --> 00:31:16,809
Vic...

583
00:31:16,924 --> 00:31:19,658
What do you suggest
to go with your wine?

584
00:31:19,751 --> 00:31:21,206
Let me see.

585
00:31:25,915 --> 00:31:26,851
Oh...

586
00:31:26,942 --> 00:31:29,915
the carpaccio sounds like a nice starter.

587
00:31:29,947 --> 00:31:31,889
Wow.

588
00:31:31,927 --> 00:31:34,571
Lynette. You liked it, huh?

589
00:31:34,672 --> 00:31:36,627
It was delicious.

590
00:31:36,713 --> 00:31:39,096
Lucky for you, it's a big vineyard.

591
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:40,491
Oh.

592
00:31:40,561 --> 00:31:42,913
Thank you.

593
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:47,667
Oh, look! One of the Pointer Sisters!

594
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:55,661
Sorry.

595
00:31:55,736 --> 00:31:58,273
It was, um, just a nun.

596
00:32:06,578 --> 00:32:08,222
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

597
00:32:11,372 --> 00:32:12,808
Gaby, what the hell?

598
00:32:12,916 --> 00:32:14,515
I know. I'm sorry I'm late.

599
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,729
I mean your clothes.

600
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,193
Didn't I see that shirt
in the hamper this morning?

601
00:32:21,297 --> 00:32:23,286
I gave it a sniff. It has another day in it.

602
00:32:24,123 --> 00:32:25,831
Gaby, this is an important business dinner.

603
00:32:25,927 --> 00:32:28,447
Yeah, but it's also John Rowland's restaurant.

604
00:32:28,563 --> 00:32:29,672
If I made myself pretty,

605
00:32:29,737 --> 00:32:31,701
you might think I was doing it just for him.

606
00:32:31,809 --> 00:32:35,691
Oh, God help me. Is that what this is about?
Well, I didn't want to run the risk

607
00:32:35,744 --> 00:32:39,032
of failing another test.
Okay, Gaby, go change. You made your point.

608
00:32:39,128 --> 00:32:40,340
Not quite.

609
00:32:41,237 --> 00:32:43,917
For the past 11 years,
I have stood beside you

610
00:32:43,972 --> 00:32:46,830
when you were poor and blind
and knocked me up twice.

611
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,238
At this point in our marriage,

612
00:32:48,649 --> 00:32:50,848
if you still feel the need to test me,

613
00:32:51,366 --> 00:32:53,051
then you're the one who's failed.

614
00:32:55,329 --> 00:32:56,963
You're right.

615
00:32:58,761 --> 00:33:00,153
I'm sorry.

616
00:33:01,588 --> 00:33:03,736
Thank you. And for the record,

617
00:33:03,817 --> 00:33:05,904
I only took my clip off
and shook out my hair

618
00:33:05,983 --> 00:33:08,099
because I ran into somebody I knew.

619
00:33:08,282 --> 00:33:10,659
I would've done it, if it
was Lynette Scavo, okay?

620
00:33:10,708 --> 00:33:11,952
Okay.

621
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:15,905
So do you think you can go home and...

622
00:33:15,966 --> 00:33:17,914
Oh, don't worry. I have clothes
and makeup in the car.

623
00:33:17,994 --> 00:33:21,416
Good, because that shirt
did not have another day in it.

624
00:33:29,867 --> 00:33:30,846
Hello?

625
00:33:32,384 --> 00:33:33,665
Who is this?

626
00:33:34,562 --> 00:33:35,866
What is your name?

627
00:33:36,816 --> 00:33:39,417
Oh, you got a big mouth
for a guy with no name.

628
00:33:39,525 --> 00:33:42,094
No, no, no, no. No, no, you listen to me.

629
00:33:42,208 --> 00:33:43,945
You come anywhere near my family,

630
00:33:44,015 --> 00:33:45,635
I will personally bash your brains in... 

631
00:33:45,697 --> 00:33:48,208
Assuming you have any!

632
00:33:51,524 --> 00:33:52,429
You okay?

633
00:33:53,226 --> 00:33:56,033
I'm fine. Just another moron
with some empty threats.

634
00:33:58,298 --> 00:34:00,518
And what if they're not empty?

635
00:34:07,809 --> 00:34:09,986
Do you know where your
father and I keep the gun?

636
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:11,763
Ma...

637
00:34:11,805 --> 00:34:13,565
No, look, you're old enough know this stuff.

638
00:34:13,652 --> 00:34:17,732
Just in case someone should try
to come in here and hurt you...
I can take care of myself.

639
00:34:18,442 --> 00:34:22,175
Well, just in case you can't
take care of yourself...

640
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:28,531
there is a loaded .38 Smith & Wesson in a box

641
00:34:29,866 --> 00:34:31,435
in the second drawer in my dresser.

642
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:32,906
You got that?

643
00:34:37,995 --> 00:34:39,396
What are you smiling at?

644
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:41,022
It's just...

645
00:34:42,373 --> 00:34:44,893
it's not your typical
mother/son conversation.

646
00:34:48,487 --> 00:34:49,554
You know I've always felt bad

647
00:34:49,597 --> 00:34:51,081
about the way we've had to raise you,

648
00:34:51,141 --> 00:34:52,859
being on the run and all.

649
00:34:53,598 --> 00:34:55,182
If it weren't for me,

650
00:34:55,211 --> 00:34:56,872
you coulda had a normal childhood.

651
00:34:56,932 --> 00:35:00,257
Ma, you don't ever have
to apologize to me.

652
00:35:04,038 --> 00:35:05,669
I'm glad you're not like other moms.

653
00:35:07,248 --> 00:35:08,380
Thanks, baby.

654
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:11,017
I just wanna be a good one.

655
00:35:16,354 --> 00:35:17,591
Remember...

656
00:35:17,663 --> 00:35:20,248
aim for the head, not the legs.

657
00:35:24,324 --> 00:35:26,393
So Patti comes downstairs,

658
00:35:26,471 --> 00:35:28,868
and sitting under the Christmas tree

659
00:35:28,943 --> 00:35:32,308
is the cutest Golden Retriever
puppy you ever saw.

660
00:35:32,397 --> 00:35:35,056
Oh, it was the best present I ever got.
Aw.

661
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,798
Do you like dogs, Lynette?

662
00:35:37,987 --> 00:35:39,652
Ooh, I love 'em!

663
00:35:39,701 --> 00:35:41,138
But Penny is allergic,

664
00:35:41,218 --> 00:35:43,991
so we got fish.

665
00:35:44,022 --> 00:35:45,558
Fish suck.

666
00:35:45,604 --> 00:35:48,613
Swim, die, flush... new one.

667
00:35:48,689 --> 00:35:50,321
Swim, die, flush... new one.

668
00:35:50,409 --> 00:35:53,013
You know, what dog I'd really
like is the Reima-Waner.

669
00:35:56,473 --> 00:35:57,747
Weimaraner.

670
00:35:57,797 --> 00:35:59,192
A window-hammer.

671
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,384
Weimaraner.

672
00:36:00,452 --> 00:36:01,571
Rammerjammer.

673
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,006
Nette, make him stop.

674
00:36:03,082 --> 00:36:05,605
Gaby, you know, I... I
wanna tell you something,

675
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:07,490
but I'm afraid it's gonna come out wrong.

676
00:36:09,339 --> 00:36:12,521
Your boobs look great in that dress.

677
00:36:13,279 --> 00:36:16,433
Well, Tom, how could that
possibly come out wrong?

678
00:36:18,992 --> 00:36:20,210
Yu'd be surprised.

679
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:23,991
Well, you'll have to excuse Tom.
He's a bit of a lightweight.

680
00:36:24,058 --> 00:36:25,928
And your wine is so delicious, he couldn't resist.

681
00:36:28,422 --> 00:36:30,174
But look at you. You had at least a bottle,

682
00:36:30,252 --> 00:36:33,654
and you'd never know.
Might as well finish this off.
No, no, no!

683
00:36:35,218 --> 00:36:37,783
If she has one more glass, I'm gonna puke.

684
00:36:59,048 --> 00:37:00,465
I just talked to Bob.

685
00:37:01,734 --> 00:37:02,904
Why would you do that?

686
00:37:02,995 --> 00:37:04,277
He asked me to stop by...

687
00:37:05,665 --> 00:37:07,198
because he wanted to tell me that the police

688
00:37:08,647 --> 00:37:10,645
have evidence that clears Danny Bolen.

689
00:37:12,475 --> 00:37:13,533
What?

690
00:37:14,935 --> 00:37:15,635
They've got a shot

691
00:37:15,663 --> 00:37:17,259
from a security camera at Fairview liquors

692
00:37:17,354 --> 00:37:21,194
that puts him there at the time Julie was attacked.
How would they know that?

693
00:37:21,286 --> 00:37:24,874
There was a time stamp.
They don't know the exact time of the attack.

694
00:37:25,514 --> 00:37:27,302
The camera shows him
sitting in the parking lot

695
00:37:27,375 --> 00:37:29,700
drinking beer for over an hour.

696
00:37:31,671 --> 00:37:33,280
He couldn't have done it.

697
00:37:36,543 --> 00:37:37,655
I can't believe this.

698
00:37:43,036 --> 00:37:45,617
That means that Julie's
attacker is still out there.

699
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:49,198
And I've been going up and down the street

700
00:37:49,278 --> 00:37:51,289
telling everybody that Danny Bolen did it.

701
00:37:52,167 --> 00:37:55,846
Your daughter was hurt.
You wanted somebody to blame.

702
00:37:55,904 --> 00:37:57,087
People get that.

703
00:37:57,143 --> 00:38:00,431
Oh, God. I'm... I'm so sorry.

704
00:38:01,331 --> 00:38:03,377
Well, I'm sure the Bolens will understand.

705
00:38:03,451 --> 00:38:05,212
No, not just to them.

706
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:07,138
To you.

707
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,362
What are you talking about?

708
00:38:12,241 --> 00:38:14,802
Well, you woke up the morning
after your wedding

709
00:38:14,865 --> 00:38:17,383
and found yourself
married to a madwoman.

710
00:38:18,401 --> 00:38:19,485
I have been...

711
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:24,987
just totally obsessed with
finding Julie's attacker, and...

712
00:38:25,067 --> 00:38:27,610
I said, "for better or worse."

713
00:38:32,417 --> 00:38:33,864
So we start with the worse.

714
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:48,892
Wow, glad this night's over. I'm exhausted.

715
00:38:48,953 --> 00:38:50,081
Yeah, me, too.

716
00:38:51,578 --> 00:38:52,434
You coming to bed?

717
00:38:52,537 --> 00:38:54,867
I'll be up in a sec. I'm gonna turn off some lights.

718
00:39:49,306 --> 00:39:53,771
On this street, the day
begins with a cup of coffee.

719
00:39:56,551 --> 00:40:01,086
Some drink it while recalling
a lover they once cared for.

720
00:40:03,242 --> 00:40:07,531
Some pour it, thinking of
the boss they must lie to.

721
00:40:09,788 --> 00:40:11,639
Others sip it,

722
00:40:11,712 --> 00:40:15,380
contemplating a man
they might be in love with.

723
00:40:17,139 --> 00:40:21,125
But for one woman,
on this particular morning,

724
00:40:21,356 --> 00:40:24,129
that cup of coffee has to wait...

725
00:40:27,501 --> 00:40:30,828
because she discovers
a neighbor in trouble.

726
00:40:32,703 --> 00:40:34,536
She goes to help,

727
00:40:34,644 --> 00:40:38,239
not only because it's
the right thing to do,

728
00:40:40,127 --> 00:40:43,049
But because it's the only
way she can think of...

729
00:40:43,947 --> 00:40:46,234
to ask for forgiveness.

730
00:40:48,423 --> 00:40:50,350
And once it is given...

731
00:40:51,426 --> 00:40:53,633
the day begins.
