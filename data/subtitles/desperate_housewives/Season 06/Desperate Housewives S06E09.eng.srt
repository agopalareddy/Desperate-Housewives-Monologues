1
00:00:02,013 --> 00:00:03,013
Previously on Desperate Housewives....

2
00:00:04,015 --> 00:00:05,015
Gaby discovered a secret.

3
00:00:05,016 --> 00:00:06,016
Your stomach just kicked me.

4
00:00:06,017 --> 00:00:07,817
I want you to run the Miami office.

5
00:00:08,721 --> 00:00:10,021
So Carlos payed hard ball.

6
00:00:11,022 --> 00:00:12,022
You can't fire me for being pregnant.

7
00:00:12,023 --> 00:00:13,023
I'm offering you a promotion.

8
00:00:14,025 --> 00:00:15,025
If you choose to turn
it down and quit instead

9
00:00:15,026 --> 00:00:16,026
I can't stop you.

10
00:00:17,028 --> 00:00:18,028
Katherine broke down.

11
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:19,929
The man I love chose you, it's over.

12
00:00:20,231 --> 00:00:22,031
Why has this been so hard on me?

13
00:00:23,034 --> 00:00:24,034
You loved him.

14
00:00:24,035 --> 00:00:25,635
I found a way to spring
you from this marriage!

15
00:00:26,238 --> 00:00:27,238
Karl had a plan:

16
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:30,616
If he violates parole by
associating with a known felon,

17
00:00:30,616 --> 00:00:31,543
They can revoke it.

18
00:00:31,543 --> 00:00:34,612
All we need to do is get some
ex-con in a room with Orson,

19
00:00:34,612 --> 00:00:36,691
Take some pictures,
and it's bye-bye, Orson.

20
00:00:36,691 --> 00:00:38,841
That's perfect! And then
he'll have to let me go.

21
00:00:39,675 --> 00:00:40,753
Nick made a call.

22
00:00:42,017 --> 00:00:44,214
Agent Padilla? I'm
thinking about coming in.

23
00:00:45,249 --> 00:00:47,206
- And evil...
- Did you forget something?

24
00:00:47,206 --> 00:00:49,833
- returned to the neighborhood.
- What are you doing?

25
00:00:56,499 --> 00:00:59,037
Her name was Emily Portsmith,

26
00:01:00,316 --> 00:01:01,881
and word of her death

27
00:01:02,588 --> 00:01:03,800
spread quickly.

28
00:01:05,828 --> 00:01:09,160
You see, everyone in town knew Emily.

29
00:01:10,884 --> 00:01:13,539
Her family was well known and respected,

30
00:01:16,155 --> 00:01:18,751
she'd been popular in school...

31
00:01:21,254 --> 00:01:26,658
and her customers at the
coffee shop adored her.

32
00:01:26,726 --> 00:01:30,036
People were shocked to
hear she'd been murdered,

33
00:01:31,318 --> 00:01:33,924
mostly because another young woman

34
00:01:33,924 --> 00:01:37,021
had been attacked just
a few weeks before.

35
00:01:40,073 --> 00:01:43,456
Yes, everyone in Fairview now knew

36
00:01:44,324 --> 00:01:48,013
a killer was walking among them.

37
00:01:49,949 --> 00:01:52,484
And they would soon learn...

38
00:01:54,087 --> 00:01:55,987
he wasn't finished.

39
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,346

41
00:02:11,303 --> 00:02:12,033
The next day,

42
00:02:12,033 --> 00:02:14,749
The women of Wisteria Lane got together

43
00:02:14,749 --> 00:02:16,660
ror their weekly poker game.

44
00:02:17,029 --> 00:02:21,344
But as it turned out, no one
was in the mood to gamble.

45
00:02:21,344 --> 00:02:23,299
The girl at the coffee
shop was strangled,

46
00:02:23,299 --> 00:02:25,095
and Julie was attacked the same way.

47
00:02:25,095 --> 00:02:27,110
There is obviously a
madman on the loose.

48
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,592
I'm afraid to leave my house at night.

49
00:02:28,592 --> 00:02:30,398
At least now you have a
boyfriend to protect you.

50
00:02:30,398 --> 00:02:33,243
Roy? The man threw out
his back peeling an orange.

51
00:02:33,243 --> 00:02:36,660
- I'm on my own here.
- So what do we do to protect ourselves?

52
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,012
Down at the hospital where I work,

53
00:02:39,012 --> 00:02:40,608
they offer a self-defense class.

54
00:02:40,608 --> 00:02:43,558
- Maybe we should consider taking that.
- That's a good idea.

55
00:02:43,558 --> 00:02:46,108
I guess we could, but
you know my motto...

56
00:02:46,108 --> 00:02:49,105
.38 special is a girl's best friend.

57
00:02:49,105 --> 00:02:51,424
Ooh, I love the pearl handle.

58
00:02:51,424 --> 00:02:53,592
It would look so good
with my white suit.

59
00:02:53,592 --> 00:02:56,171
Susan, you should
feel it. It's so light.

60
00:02:56,171 --> 00:02:58,184
I don't touch guns anymore,

61
00:02:58,184 --> 00:03:00,889
not since I accidentally
grazed Katherine.

62
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,095
Oh, still going with
"accidentally," are we?

63
00:03:06,348 --> 00:03:08,932
Oh, hey, honey. We're all
gonna take a self-defense class.

64
00:03:08,932 --> 00:03:09,678
You wanna come with us?

65
00:03:09,678 --> 00:03:11,502
Yeah. It might make you feel safer.

66
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:16,526
Well... I was taking out the
trash when I was attacked.

67
00:03:16,526 --> 00:03:18,223
He came out of nowhere,

68
00:03:18,223 --> 00:03:20,828
and I blacked out before
I knew what was happening.

69
00:03:23,812 --> 00:03:26,759
If someone really wants to
get you, they can get you.

70
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:41,883
I'm off. Oh, you're
sewing penny's costume?

71
00:03:42,393 --> 00:03:45,662
Yeah, but I'm reading the
sports page while doing it,

72
00:03:45,662 --> 00:03:47,240
so they kinda cancel each other out.

73
00:03:48,917 --> 00:03:51,424
Oh... ahem, I got you this...

74
00:03:52,144 --> 00:03:53,097
a pricey bourbon.

75
00:03:53,097 --> 00:03:55,229
It's 8:45 in the
morning, and I'm pregnant.

76
00:03:55,523 --> 00:03:56,570
I think I'll pass.

77
00:03:57,341 --> 00:04:00,911
For Carlos.

78
00:03:58,212 --> 00:04:01,166
It's a "sorry I lied
about being pregnant" gift.

79
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,763
I don't need that. I know Carlos.

80
00:04:03,763 --> 00:04:05,028
He loses his temper,

81
00:04:05,028 --> 00:04:07,234
then he calms down
and thinks rationally.

82
00:04:07,234 --> 00:04:09,560
- Goodbye. Mwah.
- I'd still bring the booze.

83
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,567
I'm telling you, I am too
valuable right where I am.

84
00:04:12,567 --> 00:04:14,859
There's no way he's gonna
try and send me to Florida.

85
00:04:16,175 --> 00:04:18,016
Bon voyage!

86
00:04:19,195 --> 00:04:20,078
What's going on?

87
00:04:20,567 --> 00:04:22,457
Carlos told us about
the promotion in Florida.

88
00:04:22,457 --> 00:04:23,671
Congratulations.

89
00:04:26,173 --> 00:04:29,909
You are going to be
so missed around here!

90
00:04:33,261 --> 00:04:35,403
Lynette, where you going?
Rita wrote you a good-bye poem.

91
00:04:35,403 --> 00:04:37,098
Can I see you in my office, please?

92
00:04:42,793 --> 00:04:43,821
What do you think you're doing?

93
00:04:43,821 --> 00:04:45,380
You know I'm not moving to Florida.

94
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:48,468
Okay, so then we just, uh,
change the banner to read,

95
00:04:48,468 --> 00:04:50,762
- "good luck and so long."
- No, it needs to read,

96
00:04:50,762 --> 00:04:54,950
- "I told you I'm not leaving. Someone get me a bagel."
- Lynette, what can I tell you?

97
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:57,266
We have an opening for
you in our Florida branch.

98
00:04:57,266 --> 00:04:59,743
But here, your job's
already been given to Tim.

99
00:05:00,495 --> 00:05:03,020
- Well, tell Tim you made a mistake.
- I can't do that.

100
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,745
So I guess this leaves
you no choice but to quit.

101
00:05:07,214 --> 00:05:10,417
Look, I know what you are
doing, and I am not going for it.

102
00:05:10,417 --> 00:05:12,528
You want me gone, you're
gonna have to fire me.

103
00:05:13,211 --> 00:05:15,677
And open myself up to a lawsuit
by firing a pregnant woman?

104
00:05:16,081 --> 00:05:16,949
I don't think so.

105
00:05:18,372 --> 00:05:20,117
Then if you don't
mind, I have work to do.

106
00:05:21,852 --> 00:05:22,576
Hey.

107
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,408
These aren't my kids.

108
00:05:25,063 --> 00:05:27,788
No. Those... are Tim's kids.

109
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:29,611
This is his office now.

110
00:05:30,535 --> 00:05:31,057
So...

111
00:05:33,288 --> 00:05:34,939
what office will I be using?

112
00:05:41,539 --> 00:05:43,024
Are you kidding me?

113
00:05:43,024 --> 00:05:45,132
These twins have a bigger office.

114
00:05:46,674 --> 00:05:47,656
Enjoy.

115
00:05:53,882 --> 00:05:54,408
How you doing?

116
00:05:56,282 --> 00:05:57,134
I'm okay.

117
00:05:58,398 --> 00:06:00,399
Everybody seems to think
whoever killed Emily

118
00:06:00,467 --> 00:06:02,148
was probably the same
person who attacked me.

119
00:06:02,148 --> 00:06:04,458
Yeah, that's what the police are saying.

120
00:06:08,749 --> 00:06:12,804
And I think that we should do
everything we can to help them.

121
00:06:15,023 --> 00:06:15,943
Meaning what?

122
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:17,768
Maybe now is the time

123
00:06:17,768 --> 00:06:19,880
to tell them about the
married man you were seeing.

124
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,294
- He had nothing to do with it.
- You don't know that.

125
00:06:22,294 --> 00:06:25,528
Men who cheat sometimes have
more than one girlfriend.

126
00:06:25,528 --> 00:06:28,769
Mom, listen. There is no way
he could ever hurt someone,

127
00:06:28,769 --> 00:06:29,876
much less kill them.

128
00:06:34,106 --> 00:06:34,865
Okay.

129
00:06:35,435 --> 00:06:37,669
if you're sure.

130
00:06:37,737 --> 00:06:40,205
I am. I mean...

131
00:06:40,273 --> 00:06:43,175
Why would he attack me and
then wanna get back together?

132
00:06:43,243 --> 00:06:46,712
Wait. Have you started seeing him again?

133
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,746
No.

134
00:06:47,814 --> 00:06:49,281
-Julie...
- Even if I did,

135
00:06:49,349 --> 00:06:51,383
It is my life, right?

136
00:06:54,954 --> 00:06:57,656
That's right. It is your life.

137
00:07:00,326 --> 00:07:01,101
Is it just me,

138
00:07:01,101 --> 00:07:04,347
or was life much less
complicated when you were 7?

139
00:07:07,747 --> 00:07:09,468
Sorry I grew up.

140
00:07:11,221 --> 00:07:12,660
Me, too.

141
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:19,664
Police are concerned

142
00:07:19,664 --> 00:07:21,435
that the strangling of Portsmith

143
00:07:21,435 --> 00:07:23,301
is connected to a similar attack

144
00:07:23,301 --> 00:07:25,874
on a Fairview woman earlier this year.

145
00:07:25,874 --> 00:07:28,907
Anyone with information
is being asked to call...

146
00:07:29,888 --> 00:07:30,849
Just think...

147
00:07:31,357 --> 00:07:33,255
if the cops hadn't wasted
so much time on Danny,

148
00:07:33,526 --> 00:07:35,734
they might've caught this guy
before he did this again, right?

149
00:07:38,965 --> 00:07:40,061
What?

150
00:07:40,733 --> 00:07:43,435
I was there.

151
00:07:43,503 --> 00:07:44,387
You were where?

152
00:07:44,387 --> 00:07:47,253
At the coffee shop.

153
00:07:47,253 --> 00:07:49,150
I got there right when
that girl was closing up.

154
00:07:49,988 --> 00:07:51,980
- Oh, please be kidding.
- Nah, I wish I was.

155
00:07:52,445 --> 00:07:55,380
And I'm pretty sure I
was her last customer.

156
00:07:56,407 --> 00:07:57,652
But did anybody see you?

157
00:07:57,717 --> 00:08:00,118
No, I don't think so,
but that doesn't mean

158
00:08:00,186 --> 00:08:02,875
the cops won't figure out that
I was there. And if they do...

159
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,390
Yeah, they're gonna wanna
come and talk to you again

160
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,059
a... and maybe run your prints.

161
00:08:06,059 --> 00:08:09,628
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

162
00:08:11,531 --> 00:08:12,398
I was also thinking

163
00:08:12,398 --> 00:08:14,660
That maybe we shouldn't wait
around for that to happen.

164
00:08:15,768 --> 00:08:19,159
No. I'm not moving
again. N... not this time.

165
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:20,931
Look, Angie... Ange... Ange,
will you just let me finish?

166
00:08:20,931 --> 00:08:21,610
No, no, no, Nick, I like this place!

167
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:22,932
I have friends. I have a job.

168
00:08:22,932 --> 00:08:25,567
I... I... I... I feel like
a real person here again.

169
00:08:26,663 --> 00:08:29,852
After 18 years of being a ghost,
I... I don't wanna give that up.

170
00:08:32,601 --> 00:08:34,614
Fine.

171
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,035
All right, maybe we'll get lucky,

172
00:08:38,035 --> 00:08:39,138
and the cops just won't come.

173
00:08:39,138 --> 00:08:40,735
But honestly,

174
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,355
I don't know how much
more luck we got left.

175
00:08:52,605 --> 00:08:54,706
Hey.

176
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:11,113
Hello.

177
00:09:11,113 --> 00:09:13,140
Are you Lamar Benjamin?

178
00:09:13,908 --> 00:09:14,585
You got a warrant?

179
00:09:14,585 --> 00:09:18,041
Oh, no, I'm not with the
police. My name is Bree Hodge.

180
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:20,915
You know my husband Orson
from the state penitentiary.

181
00:09:20,915 --> 00:09:22,434
Do you have a moment?

182
00:09:25,046 --> 00:09:26,084
I got nothing but moments.

183
00:09:37,607 --> 00:09:38,857
So you're Mrs. Hodge?

184
00:09:39,929 --> 00:09:40,416
Damn.

185
00:09:41,301 --> 00:09:42,707
Flossy did okay for hisself.

186
00:09:43,311 --> 00:09:44,209
Uh, "flossy"?

187
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:45,680
That's what we called Orson

188
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,495
'cause he got us all dental floss

189
00:09:47,828 --> 00:09:49,655
and then nagged us to
use it after every meal.

190
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:52,309
- I see.
- Pain in the ass.

191
00:09:52,309 --> 00:09:54,799
I was glad when somebody
used it to strangle a guard,

192
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:55,829
and they took it all away.

193
00:09:58,238 --> 00:10:00,220
So how's Orson doing?

194
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:03,315
Well, uh, to be honest, Lamar,

195
00:10:03,315 --> 00:10:05,991
life on the outside's
been a little hard for him.

196
00:10:05,991 --> 00:10:09,957
People can be so judgmental
about men who have served time.

197
00:10:09,957 --> 00:10:12,405
And if you're a repeat
offender, you can forget it.

198
00:10:12,405 --> 00:10:15,063
Yes.

199
00:10:15,063 --> 00:10:15,955
Well...

200
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:20,178
I've heard Orson speak very
fondly of his prison friends,

201
00:10:20,178 --> 00:10:21,896
especially you.

202
00:10:21,896 --> 00:10:22,908
Really?

203
00:10:22,908 --> 00:10:24,761
'Cause he seemed kind of mad

204
00:10:24,761 --> 00:10:26,245
after I used him as a
shield in that yard fight.

205
00:10:28,106 --> 00:10:31,971
Lamar, he just tells that
story now and laughs and laughs.

206
00:10:33,107 --> 00:10:35,675
Anyway, he's been feeling a little blue,

207
00:10:35,742 --> 00:10:38,644
and I was hoping you would pay
him a visit and cheer him up.

208
00:10:39,817 --> 00:10:42,075
Sorry. I'd be breaking my parole.

209
00:10:42,216 --> 00:10:45,024
They catch me hanging
out with other ex-cons,

210
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:46,399
they can send me back to jail.

211
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,179
Really? Well, that's a silly rule.

212
00:10:49,214 --> 00:10:50,493
Don't worry, though.

213
00:10:50,657 --> 00:10:53,192
Our house is on the end
of a very quiet cul-de-sac.

214
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,812
No one would even know you stopped by.

215
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,904
And, of course, I
would compensate you...

216
00:11:01,969 --> 00:11:04,071
for your time.

217
00:11:10,108 --> 00:11:11,996
And another 3 when you come.

218
00:11:12,031 --> 00:11:14,380
What the hell?

219
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:18,017
No harm in a little social call.

220
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,655
But you can't tell anybody I came.

221
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:25,124
When you get to know me better, Lamar,

222
00:11:25,192 --> 00:11:27,126
you'll find I have no trouble...

223
00:11:27,194 --> 00:11:28,427
keeping secrets.

224
00:11:35,106 --> 00:11:37,343
Hey. What are you doing here?

225
00:11:37,424 --> 00:11:38,648
Your mom told me you were upset.

226
00:11:38,648 --> 00:11:40,844
I told her I knew how
to make you feel better.

227
00:11:40,844 --> 00:11:42,002
Mint chocolate chip?

228
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:44,616
Thanks, daddy.

229
00:11:45,116 --> 00:11:47,311
I know this one's gonna take
a lot more than ice cream.

230
00:11:47,752 --> 00:11:49,601
I keep thinking about him.

231
00:11:50,822 --> 00:11:51,778
He's out there, and...

232
00:11:52,557 --> 00:11:54,458
maybe he's thinking about me.

233
00:11:54,526 --> 00:11:56,860
Honey, honey, he's not.

234
00:11:56,928 --> 00:11:59,930
He knows where I live. He
knows what kind of car I drive.

235
00:11:59,998 --> 00:12:01,490
I've been wanting to go to the library,

236
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:02,919
but I'm afraid he's gonna follow me.

237
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:05,209
Look, if you're worried about your car,

238
00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:06,152
why don't we switch for a while?

239
00:12:06,152 --> 00:12:09,273
Seriously? I'd drive your fancy car,

240
00:12:09,274 --> 00:12:11,875
and you'd drive my tiny, little compact?

241
00:12:11,943 --> 00:12:14,878
Hey, there's nothing I
would not do for my little...

242
00:12:14,946 --> 00:12:16,980
You have air conditioning, right?

243
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:21,652
Yeah, there's nothing I
wouldn't do for my little girl.

244
00:12:33,665 --> 00:12:34,965
You okay?

245
00:12:35,033 --> 00:12:39,036
I'm just having a bad day.

246
00:12:39,103 --> 00:12:41,705
My life has gotten sort of...

247
00:12:41,773 --> 00:12:43,006
complicated.

248
00:12:43,074 --> 00:12:45,075
Why?

249
00:12:45,143 --> 00:12:48,979
Oh, it's... grown-up
relationship stuff.

250
00:12:49,047 --> 00:12:50,681
You wouldn't understand.

251
00:12:50,748 --> 00:12:52,783
Okay.

252
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,751
But...

253
00:12:56,421 --> 00:12:59,056
since you asked...

254
00:13:00,892 --> 00:13:05,262
so I think you're really gonna
have fun at Brandon's party.

255
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:08,298
I heard there's gonna be a pony.

256
00:13:08,366 --> 00:13:09,800
Hey, you okay?

257
00:13:09,867 --> 00:13:12,903
I'm worried about Mrs. Mayfair.

258
00:13:12,971 --> 00:13:14,838
Why?

259
00:13:14,906 --> 00:13:16,873
She's not getting any younger,

260
00:13:16,941 --> 00:13:19,943
and it's really hard to
meet guys in this town.

261
00:13:20,011 --> 00:13:22,913
Where did you hear that?

262
00:13:22,981 --> 00:13:24,581
She told me.

263
00:13:24,649 --> 00:13:27,017
She also said

264
00:13:27,085 --> 00:13:28,952
mommy stole you from her,

265
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,888
and that makes mommy a bad person.

266
00:13:34,993 --> 00:13:37,327
Buddy...

267
00:13:37,395 --> 00:13:39,396
your mommy is a great person.

268
00:13:39,464 --> 00:13:42,332
Now why you, uh, sign
brandon's card, okay?

269
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,935
And, uh, I'll be right back.

270
00:13:52,844 --> 00:13:54,611
Mike, watch it.

271
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:57,014
Did you actually
tell my 6-year-old son

272
00:13:57,081 --> 00:13:59,950
that his mother's a bad person?

273
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:05,455
Well, I would've used
more colorful language,

274
00:14:05,523 --> 00:14:08,492
but like you said, he's only 6.

275
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:12,262
You've never really seen me get angry.

276
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:14,164
But if you want to,

277
00:14:14,232 --> 00:14:16,767
just talk to my son one more time.

278
00:14:18,469 --> 00:14:21,338
Then you'll know what I'm capable of.

279
00:14:23,808 --> 00:14:25,876
Mike.

280
00:14:25,943 --> 00:14:29,479
I love M.J. I... I... I would
never do anything to hurt him.

281
00:14:29,547 --> 00:14:32,416
One more time.

282
00:14:46,631 --> 00:14:49,900
Oh, Julie.

283
00:14:49,967 --> 00:14:51,835
No!

284
00:14:58,376 --> 00:14:59,609
Hello?

285
00:14:59,677 --> 00:15:02,079
Hi. It's your mother.

286
00:15:02,146 --> 00:15:04,014
Am I interrupting anything?

287
00:15:04,082 --> 00:15:06,183
Nope. I'm just at the library.

288
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:09,586
Oh, really. The library.

289
00:15:09,654 --> 00:15:11,822
Yeah. I thought I'd dive
into an old favorite.

290
00:15:11,889 --> 00:15:14,458
And vice versa, I'm sure.

291
00:15:14,525 --> 00:15:17,527
- Huh?
- Honey, I don't blame you.

292
00:15:17,595 --> 00:15:20,497
You've gone back to that
place because it seems...

293
00:15:20,565 --> 00:15:22,699
safe and comforting. Am I right?

294
00:15:22,767 --> 00:15:25,535
I guess.

295
00:15:25,603 --> 00:15:28,872
But trust me, it's a bad idea.

296
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:29,676
Can we talk about this later?

297
00:15:29,676 --> 00:15:31,691
I only have an hour, and
I really wanna finish.

298
00:15:32,377 --> 00:15:35,377
Okay, I want you out of there right now!

299
00:15:35,377 --> 00:15:37,016
Mom, I'll see you soon.

300
00:15:39,598 --> 00:15:40,565
You bet you will.

301
00:15:43,888 --> 00:15:45,822
You've been a busy girl.

302
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,791
You got the ex-con booked,

303
00:15:47,859 --> 00:15:50,527
hidden cameras all set up.

304
00:15:50,595 --> 00:15:52,362
Come Friday night...

305
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:54,598
Showtime.

306
00:15:56,167 --> 00:15:58,068
So what's the matter?

307
00:15:58,135 --> 00:16:00,337
We should be celebrating.

308
00:16:00,404 --> 00:16:01,453
I just hope we're both clear

309
00:16:01,453 --> 00:16:04,413
that these photos are
strictly for blackmail.

310
00:16:04,976 --> 00:16:07,450
Of course. We're not actually
gonna send him to prison.

311
00:16:07,745 --> 00:16:10,435
- Unless, I mean, we have to.
- No, Karl.

312
00:16:10,435 --> 00:16:12,814
Even if he calls our bluff,
we are not gonna turn him in.

313
00:16:18,193 --> 00:16:20,290
Excuse me. Um, I'm
looking for the person

314
00:16:20,358 --> 00:16:22,292
that belongs to the little blue car.

315
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,819
- She's a redhead.
- With a man?

316
00:16:23,819 --> 00:16:26,764
Yeah, she's with a man.
The redhead's my daughter.

317
00:16:27,495 --> 00:16:30,488
Your daughter? Damn.

318
00:16:31,302 --> 00:16:33,262
- You look good.
- Thank you.

319
00:16:33,971 --> 00:16:35,629
So can you tell me what room they're in?

320
00:16:38,858 --> 00:16:39,823
I may not love him anymore,

321
00:16:39,823 --> 00:16:42,304
but I'm not gonna win my
freedom by taking away his.

322
00:16:45,014 --> 00:16:46,082
Now you're angry.

323
00:16:48,051 --> 00:16:48,934
Bree, when you tell me

324
00:16:48,934 --> 00:16:50,940
you could never hurt
a man you used to love,

325
00:16:51,863 --> 00:16:52,970
it doesn't make me angry.

326
00:16:54,121 --> 00:16:56,627
It just reminds me
why I love you so much.

327
00:16:57,872 --> 00:16:58,723
Don't you worry.

328
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:00,771
No one's gonna get hurt.

329
00:17:08,565 --> 00:17:09,670
Oh, my God!

330
00:17:09,974 --> 00:17:10,823
Oh, my God!

331
00:17:13,856 --> 00:17:16,524
Hey, Eric. Can you tell
Carlos I'm here for lunch?

332
00:17:16,592 --> 00:17:18,626
I'm gonna run to the ladies' room.

333
00:17:18,694 --> 00:17:20,962
I'll tell him.

334
00:17:26,902 --> 00:17:29,437
Hi, Lynette.

335
00:17:29,505 --> 00:17:30,972
Hi, Gaby.

336
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,974
I'd ask you in, but I don't think

337
00:17:33,042 --> 00:17:35,944
there's enough oxygen in
here for the both of us.

338
00:17:36,011 --> 00:17:38,446
No, it's, uh... comfy.

339
00:17:41,684 --> 00:17:43,818
Hey.

340
00:17:43,886 --> 00:17:46,054
I get that Carlos is
trying to punish me.

341
00:17:46,122 --> 00:17:48,923
But enough is enough.
You gotta talk to him.

342
00:17:48,991 --> 00:17:51,926
Lynette, you never even came to
me to tell me you were pregnant.

343
00:17:51,994 --> 00:17:54,863
- I think this is between you and Carlos.
- Okay, I know you're upset,

344
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:57,866
- but me keeping my pregnancy secret wasn't personal.
- Wasn't it?

345
00:17:57,933 --> 00:18:00,835
No. Listen to me. Tom
and I are still in debt.

346
00:18:00,903 --> 00:18:03,371
I needed this promotion,
and Carlos had already

347
00:18:03,439 --> 00:18:05,840
passed over a coworker
because she was pregnant.

348
00:18:05,908 --> 00:18:07,909
I couldn't risk your telling him.

349
00:18:07,977 --> 00:18:10,945
Oh, because you thought I'd
tell Carlos, and he'd fire you.

350
00:18:11,013 --> 00:18:12,514
Yes.

351
00:18:12,581 --> 00:18:15,583
So clearly I wasn't enough of
a friend for you to trust me.

352
00:18:15,651 --> 00:18:18,086
- N... no.
- But now I'm such a good friend.

353
00:18:18,154 --> 00:18:21,055
I'm the only one who can fix it for you?

354
00:18:21,123 --> 00:18:23,591
I'm guessing you're not
gonna talk to Carlos.

355
00:18:23,659 --> 00:18:25,160
Good guess.

356
00:18:40,876 --> 00:18:43,878
I can't believe she's dead.

357
00:18:43,946 --> 00:18:46,214
I just saw her a few days ago.

358
00:18:46,282 --> 00:18:48,316
We talked about going to the mall.

359
00:18:48,384 --> 00:18:49,884
Who found her?

360
00:18:49,952 --> 00:18:51,553
The assistant manager.

361
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:54,422
I was late yesterday. I mean, thank God.

362
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:56,558
It would've freaked me out.

363
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,760
- Hey.
- Hi.

364
00:18:58,828 --> 00:19:01,529
We were just talking about Emily.

365
00:19:01,597 --> 00:19:03,498
Yeah, I didn't really know her,

366
00:19:03,566 --> 00:19:06,000
but I guess we're sort of connected now.

367
00:19:06,068 --> 00:19:08,837
You would've liked
her. She was super nice.

368
00:19:08,904 --> 00:19:10,505
I gotta go home.

369
00:19:10,573 --> 00:19:13,475
My mom's so freaked out
that this could've been me,

370
00:19:13,542 --> 00:19:17,278
she wants me around.
I'll give you a ride.

371
00:19:17,346 --> 00:19:20,615
- We should go, too, Danny.
- Uh, no, you go ahead.

372
00:19:20,683 --> 00:19:23,151
But... don't you need a ride?

373
00:19:23,219 --> 00:19:25,653
Uh, nah, I'll walk.

374
00:19:25,721 --> 00:19:28,089
I just wanna talk to Julie.

375
00:19:37,266 --> 00:19:40,268
So you wanna get something to eat?

376
00:19:40,336 --> 00:19:42,971
Thanks, but I'm not hungry.

377
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:46,374
Well, maybe you wanna go
to Emily's funeral together?

378
00:19:46,442 --> 00:19:47,842
Everybody's going.

379
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:49,577
Danny...

380
00:19:49,645 --> 00:19:51,546
I know you like me,

381
00:19:51,614 --> 00:19:54,015
but I can't hang out with you.

382
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,783
Why not?

383
00:19:55,851 --> 00:19:57,719
I just can't.

384
00:19:57,786 --> 00:19:59,954
It's complicated.

385
00:20:00,022 --> 00:20:04,425
It's 'cause you slept
with my dad, isn't it?

386
00:20:04,493 --> 00:20:06,561
Who told you that?

387
00:20:06,629 --> 00:20:10,331
- I figured out a while ago.
- If you know that,

388
00:20:10,399 --> 00:20:14,836
- then why in the world would you still...
- Because I like you!

389
00:20:14,904 --> 00:20:16,671
A lot.

390
00:20:18,107 --> 00:20:20,508
Do you not see how weird that is?

391
00:20:20,576 --> 00:20:24,979
No, it's... it's okay
'cause I've forgiven you.

392
00:20:25,047 --> 00:20:28,750
That's... that's nice,

393
00:20:28,817 --> 00:20:31,920
but it's still weird.

394
00:20:31,987 --> 00:20:33,421
Julie, p...

395
00:20:33,489 --> 00:20:35,456
please, I wanna be with you.

396
00:20:35,524 --> 00:20:37,392
Danny, I am so sorry,

397
00:20:37,459 --> 00:20:40,929
but that is never going to happen.

398
00:21:13,996 --> 00:21:15,897
Come on, if they're gonna
come, they're gonna come.

399
00:21:15,965 --> 00:21:18,866
I feel like I spent my entire
life looking out windows.

400
00:21:18,934 --> 00:21:20,501
Yeah.

401
00:21:24,073 --> 00:21:27,642
Maybe it's time we stop.

402
00:21:29,278 --> 00:21:31,145
What are you saying?

403
00:21:31,213 --> 00:21:34,582
I'm saying maybe it's time
we thought about coming in.

404
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:38,653
Please tell me you didn't talk to them.

405
00:21:38,721 --> 00:21:41,889
- Oh, my God!
- All right. Calm down, all right? I'm not an idiot.

406
00:21:41,957 --> 00:21:44,258
I used a prepaid, and the
call lasted less than a minute.

407
00:21:44,326 --> 00:21:47,161
- There's no way they're ever gonna find us.
- But still, they know we're alive!

408
00:21:47,229 --> 00:21:50,598
- Don't you wanna know if they're ready to make a deal?
- I killed a man.

409
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:53,601
They'll be ready to make a deal
when I got a needle in my arm

410
00:21:53,669 --> 00:21:56,738
- and my eyes are rolled back in my head!
- Come on, you don't know that.

411
00:21:56,805 --> 00:21:59,807
You are never talking to
them again! Do you hear me?

412
00:22:02,978 --> 00:22:06,214
I still can't get that image
of Lynette out of my head.

413
00:22:06,281 --> 00:22:08,683
The only thing missing in
that cramped little office

414
00:22:08,751 --> 00:22:11,152
was a hamster wheel and wood chips.

415
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,588
Yeah, I figure a couple
more days of this,

416
00:22:13,656 --> 00:22:16,391
she'll be ready to pack her things.

417
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,461
She does deserve this, right?

418
00:22:22,564 --> 00:22:25,099
She lied when she took the promotion.

419
00:22:25,167 --> 00:22:27,969
What... what if her doctor
had put her on bed rest?

420
00:22:28,037 --> 00:22:29,937
What if... what if I
needed her to fly somewhere?

421
00:22:30,005 --> 00:22:32,106
She could've put the
whole company in jeopardy.

422
00:22:32,174 --> 00:22:34,208
Yeah, but that never happened.

423
00:22:34,276 --> 00:22:36,210
And you said she was doing a good job,

424
00:22:36,278 --> 00:22:38,713
and now you're doing all
these mean things to her.

425
00:22:38,781 --> 00:22:40,682
Me? This was your idea.

426
00:22:40,749 --> 00:22:43,284
You wanted to put snakes in her office.

427
00:22:43,352 --> 00:22:44,552
Rubber snakes.

428
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,523
We are completely justified here.

429
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:50,258
You're right.

430
00:22:50,325 --> 00:22:52,727
You're right, which is
why we have the opportunity

431
00:22:52,795 --> 00:22:55,163
to do something we never do, Carlos...

432
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:56,698
Forgive.

433
00:22:58,934 --> 00:23:00,201
Seriously?

434
00:23:00,269 --> 00:23:02,904
Tom and Lynette have been
our friends for 15 years.

435
00:23:02,971 --> 00:23:04,839
They gave us
sausage-of-the-month

436
00:23:04,907 --> 00:23:06,107
last Christmas.

437
00:23:06,175 --> 00:23:08,776
Those were good sausages.

438
00:23:08,844 --> 00:23:11,012
I know Lynette.

439
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,514
She would never set out
to intentionally hurt us.

440
00:23:13,582 --> 00:23:16,651
I gotta admit, I do
sort of miss those guys.

441
00:23:16,719 --> 00:23:19,887
You should've seen her when
I was leaving her office.

442
00:23:19,955 --> 00:23:23,324
She had this look in her
eyes. She was so defeated.

443
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:25,259
You should've seen
this look in her eyes.

444
00:23:25,327 --> 00:23:27,228
It was like, "screw
you, Lynette. I win!"

445
00:23:27,296 --> 00:23:30,198
- So that's when you called the lawyer?
- Hell, yes. They're not getting away with this.

446
00:23:30,265 --> 00:23:33,201
They are not gonna harass
me. I am gonna sue their ass!

447
00:23:33,268 --> 00:23:36,304
And Carlos is being
served papers tomorrow.

448
00:23:36,371 --> 00:23:38,740
Wow. You're really
gettin' worked up here.

449
00:23:38,807 --> 00:23:41,209
We are not having angry sex.

450
00:23:41,276 --> 00:23:43,311
Just thought I'd ask.

451
00:23:48,817 --> 00:23:51,853
What did I tell you about
puttin' away those clothes?

452
00:23:54,256 --> 00:23:55,623
I'm serious.

453
00:23:55,691 --> 00:23:57,358
Nap time's over!

454
00:24:01,296 --> 00:24:02,964
Danny?

455
00:24:03,031 --> 00:24:04,632
Danny? No, no, no.

456
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,467
No, no, no, no, no, no! Nick!

457
00:24:09,852 --> 00:24:12,020
Any woman can be the
victim of a violent crime.

458
00:24:12,088 --> 00:24:15,257
That is why it's necessary to
learn how to defend yourself.

459
00:24:15,324 --> 00:24:19,027
A parking lot, a park,
your own driveway.

460
00:24:19,095 --> 00:24:22,030
An attack can happen anywhere.
It only takes a few seconds.

461
00:24:22,098 --> 00:24:25,066
Sorry I'm late. I had
three parties to prep for.

462
00:24:25,134 --> 00:24:28,503
How tiring that must be for
you, juggling all those affairs.

463
00:24:28,571 --> 00:24:31,640
Okay, everyone, team up. I
want an attacker and a victim.

464
00:24:31,707 --> 00:24:34,009
Hey, Gaby, you wanna attack me?

465
00:24:34,076 --> 00:24:36,344
Oh, Mrs. McCluskey, I
don't wanna hurt you.

466
00:24:36,412 --> 00:24:39,147
Oh, please. I've eaten burgers bigger
than you. All right, bring it on.

467
00:24:39,215 --> 00:24:42,717
All right, granny.
Prepare to break a hip.

468
00:24:42,785 --> 00:24:44,786
So, uh...

469
00:24:44,854 --> 00:24:47,255
looks like we're partners.
Do you wanna attack me?

470
00:24:47,323 --> 00:24:49,724
I could be persuaded.

471
00:24:49,792 --> 00:24:53,928
Now, attackers, I want you
to approach your victim.

472
00:24:53,996 --> 00:24:55,130
Oh!

473
00:24:55,197 --> 00:24:56,831
Hey!

474
00:24:56,899 --> 00:24:59,534
Freakishly strong old lady here!

475
00:24:59,602 --> 00:25:02,270
I credit the bran.

476
00:25:02,338 --> 00:25:05,440
Oh, that's very impressive.
But the rest of you,

477
00:25:05,508 --> 00:25:07,409
approach your victim from behind.

478
00:25:07,476 --> 00:25:10,278
Place her in a chokehold.

479
00:25:10,346 --> 00:25:13,214
Now, victims, your impulse
will be to pull away. Wrong.

480
00:25:13,282 --> 00:25:14,983
You'll just choke harder.

481
00:25:15,051 --> 00:25:17,986
Instead, I want you to
push back on your attacker,

482
00:25:18,054 --> 00:25:20,055
using your weight to
push him off balance.

483
00:25:20,122 --> 00:25:23,024
- Susan, a little tight.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

484
00:25:23,092 --> 00:25:24,659
Ouch.

485
00:25:24,727 --> 00:25:26,695
This feels bad, huh?

486
00:25:26,762 --> 00:25:29,631
Being betrayed by someone
you trusted not to hurt you?

487
00:25:29,699 --> 00:25:32,600
- What are you talking about?
- I know about you and Karl.

488
00:25:32,668 --> 00:25:33,935
Oh, no.

489
00:25:34,003 --> 00:25:35,870
Oh, yeah. Traitor!

490
00:25:35,938 --> 00:25:37,839
Oh! Stop it!

491
00:25:39,442 --> 00:25:42,110
Uh, you can't talk your
way out of an attack.

492
00:25:42,178 --> 00:25:44,379
- Jab with your elbows.
- I am trying to! Uhh!

493
00:25:46,882 --> 00:25:49,284
How could you?! You
know how Karl treated me.

494
00:25:49,352 --> 00:25:51,453
Susan, I am sorry. If you
will l... let me explain...

495
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,589
Okay, now, attacker and victim, switch.

496
00:25:54,657 --> 00:25:57,559
- You heard him! Switch!
- I am not letting you get behind me!

497
00:25:57,626 --> 00:25:59,627
You've already stabbed me in the back!

498
00:25:59,695 --> 00:26:01,529
Mrs. Delfino, release your victim.

499
00:26:01,597 --> 00:26:04,132
She is not the victim here!

500
00:26:05,768 --> 00:26:09,738
What about Orson? How
could you do this to him?!

501
00:26:09,805 --> 00:26:11,840
You know nothing about
my marriage to Orson.

502
00:26:11,907 --> 00:26:14,776
- Orson has put me through hell this year!
- Bree, too tight!

503
00:26:14,844 --> 00:26:16,511
Susan, I know you're angry...

504
00:26:16,579 --> 00:26:18,546
but Karl means more to
me than just a fling,

505
00:26:18,614 --> 00:26:18,820
and I am not giving him up.

506
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,689
So if that means our friendship is over,

507
00:26:20,689 --> 00:26:23,154
then that's your decision, not mine.

508
00:26:27,807 --> 00:26:29,257
You're going? We just, uh, got started.

509
00:26:29,325 --> 00:26:30,038
I know,

510
00:26:30,038 --> 00:26:34,028
but I think I've defended
myself enough for one day.

511
00:26:39,675 --> 00:26:40,416
Hey.

512
00:26:40,416 --> 00:26:40,965
Hey.

513
00:26:40,965 --> 00:26:43,267
I just got a call from the lawyer.

514
00:26:43,267 --> 00:26:44,939
They're gonna be serving
Carlos any minute.

515
00:26:45,007 --> 00:26:46,908
Wow. You're really going
through with this, huh?

516
00:26:46,976 --> 00:26:50,211
Yeah. We're not bad people, are we, Tom?

517
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:52,213
Look, what Carlos is doing to you

518
00:26:52,281 --> 00:26:54,182
is totally unfair and illegal.

519
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:58,553
- No, we're good people.
- Right, he started it. Screw him.

520
00:26:58,621 --> 00:27:00,822
Yoo-hoo!

521
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:05,560
Hey!

522
00:27:05,628 --> 00:27:07,162
What's all this?

523
00:27:07,229 --> 00:27:09,631
Uh, candy, flowers, baby gift.

524
00:27:09,698 --> 00:27:11,599
Sort of my way of saying,

525
00:27:11,667 --> 00:27:14,035
"I'm sorry, and here's
some crap to prove it."

526
00:27:14,103 --> 00:27:16,237
- Really?
- Yeah.

527
00:27:16,305 --> 00:27:19,107
I don't want to fight anymore,
and neither does Carlos.

528
00:27:19,175 --> 00:27:21,142
I was hoping we could talk.

529
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:24,045
Oh, Gaby! I am so happy!

530
00:27:24,113 --> 00:27:26,314
Aw! Here, take it. It's gettin' heavy.

531
00:27:26,382 --> 00:27:27,782
Aw!

532
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:29,784
I missed you!

533
00:27:32,755 --> 00:27:34,222
Aw! Um, Lynette?

534
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:37,158
Honey, we're having a moment
here. Please don't spoil it.

535
00:27:37,226 --> 00:27:42,163
I'm not what's gonna spoil it.

536
00:27:42,231 --> 00:27:44,933
Oh. Could you hold on a second?

537
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,302
I'm just... I'm gonna
make a quick phone call.

538
00:27:47,369 --> 00:27:49,571
You know what, guys? I
don't care what happens.

539
00:27:49,638 --> 00:27:52,774
Let's not let anything interfere
with our friendship ever again.

540
00:27:52,842 --> 00:27:55,276
Remember you said that.

541
00:27:55,344 --> 00:27:57,345
Answer the phone. Answer the phone.

542
00:28:00,449 --> 00:28:01,816
What?!

543
00:28:09,291 --> 00:28:13,294
Oh! It's Carlos. I wonder what he wants.

544
00:28:13,362 --> 00:28:16,564
Gaby, you know what you said
about our friendship before?

545
00:28:16,632 --> 00:28:19,534
Let's just make a pact that we should...

546
00:28:19,602 --> 00:28:21,636
Hey, babe, what's up?

547
00:28:26,108 --> 00:28:28,042
I will never forgive you for this.

548
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:30,011
Gaby, please. What about our pact?

549
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:32,914
We never made a pact! Here, M.J., catch.

550
00:28:32,982 --> 00:28:36,284
You have to understand. I
was just protecting myself.

551
00:28:36,352 --> 00:28:38,086
Hello, ladies. What's new?

552
00:28:38,153 --> 00:28:40,622
Lynette's suing Carlos. Here.

553
00:28:40,689 --> 00:28:43,291
Once you apologized, I
tried to call the guy off.

554
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:45,293
Lynette, you wanted to sue us!

555
00:28:45,361 --> 00:28:47,729
That proves that you are not my friend!

556
00:28:47,796 --> 00:28:50,365
- Hey, Karen! Here's some candy.
- Trying to cut down.

557
00:28:50,432 --> 00:28:52,600
Really? At your age, why bother?

558
00:28:52,668 --> 00:28:55,637
Please, I need to talk to you.

559
00:28:55,704 --> 00:28:57,739
No, you need to talk to my lawyer.

560
00:29:11,613 --> 00:29:13,814
Hey, Lynette. Got a project for you.

561
00:29:13,882 --> 00:29:16,651
Okay. Who's this?

562
00:29:16,718 --> 00:29:18,452
Steve Matthews from legal.

563
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,422
You know, since we all seem
to be lawyering up around here.

564
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:23,858
Look, I was just trying
to protect myself.

565
00:29:23,926 --> 00:29:25,860
No, it's just business.

566
00:29:25,928 --> 00:29:28,663
This is the department's
purchases and expenses

567
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:30,631
from the last fiscal year.

568
00:29:32,234 --> 00:29:34,201
- I'm gonna need all of that itemized...
- Done.

569
00:29:34,269 --> 00:29:36,203
By tomorrow morning, 9:00 a.m.

570
00:29:39,942 --> 00:29:42,343
I... hate it when I'm
the only one laughing.

571
00:29:42,411 --> 00:29:46,113
This, uh, this is at
least two days' work.

572
00:29:46,181 --> 00:29:48,749
Not if you work tonight.

573
00:29:48,817 --> 00:29:51,085
Penny's Christmas pageant is tonight.

574
00:29:51,153 --> 00:29:53,421
You know that. You go every year.

575
00:29:53,488 --> 00:29:56,891
Lynette, are you telling
me that you're unable to...

576
00:29:56,959 --> 00:29:59,860
- What was it again?
- Unable to perform the assigned task

577
00:29:59,928 --> 00:30:02,430
- in a timely manner.
- Yeah, that's it.

578
00:30:02,497 --> 00:30:03,664
No.

579
00:30:03,732 --> 00:30:05,566
Tell your undertaker friend

580
00:30:05,634 --> 00:30:07,568
that I will get the assignment done...

581
00:30:07,636 --> 00:30:09,203
in a timely manner.

582
00:30:09,271 --> 00:30:11,605
Great. And will you tell Penny

583
00:30:11,673 --> 00:30:15,609
Gaby and I are gonna have to
miss her pageant this year?

584
00:30:15,677 --> 00:30:17,545
And we are so sorry.

585
00:30:23,485 --> 00:30:26,454
Thank you both for coming.

586
00:30:26,521 --> 00:30:29,390
Before we get started,
can I get you anything?

587
00:30:29,458 --> 00:30:31,392
Given what you're about to do to us,

588
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:34,395
- I'll take a cigarette and a blindfold.
- No, no. No, no.

589
00:30:34,463 --> 00:30:38,599
I have decided to put aside
my rage and sense of betrayal.

590
00:30:38,667 --> 00:30:40,568
I'm here to help you.

591
00:30:40,635 --> 00:30:42,937
- Really?
- Not you.

592
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,309
If you are actually considering

593
00:30:48,377 --> 00:30:50,378
having a serious
relationship with this man,

594
00:30:50,445 --> 00:30:53,180
then I wanna make sure
that you have all the facts.

595
00:30:53,248 --> 00:30:55,316
What kind of facts?

596
00:30:55,384 --> 00:30:57,184
Karl facts.

597
00:30:57,252 --> 00:31:02,156
Karl, tell Bree what you
got me for my 30th birthday.

598
00:31:02,224 --> 00:31:04,125
Who can remember? It was so long ago.

599
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:08,262
Nothing! He got me nothing
because he forgot my birthday.

600
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:11,499
- And it wasn't that long ago.
- I don't see the point of...

601
00:31:11,566 --> 00:31:14,435
Now tell her where you
spent our tenth anniversary.

602
00:31:17,606 --> 00:31:20,141
- I'm sorry. What was that?
- A strip club.

603
00:31:20,208 --> 00:31:22,009
Oh, Karl!

604
00:31:22,077 --> 00:31:23,577
That's nothing.

605
00:31:23,645 --> 00:31:27,148
Now tell her what you wanted
for your 35th birthday.

606
00:31:27,215 --> 00:31:29,383
Aw, come on.

607
00:31:29,451 --> 00:31:33,421
He wanted me to ask a friend
to join us in the bedroom.

608
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:37,858
You kept saying I was hard to shop for.

609
00:31:37,926 --> 00:31:40,361
There he is, Bree.

610
00:31:40,429 --> 00:31:43,330
That is the man you
say you wanna be with.

611
00:31:43,398 --> 00:31:47,268
Susan, I went into this
with my eyes wide open.

612
00:31:47,335 --> 00:31:50,337
I know who Karl was and
who he sometimes still is.

613
00:31:50,405 --> 00:31:53,307
But I believe him when he
says he wants to change.

614
00:31:53,375 --> 00:31:55,376
And isn't that what
you're supposed to do

615
00:31:55,444 --> 00:31:57,478
when you love someone?

616
00:31:59,648 --> 00:32:02,650
Did you say... "love"?

617
00:32:07,789 --> 00:32:09,523
I think I did.

618
00:32:09,591 --> 00:32:12,693
Bree, I have to ask you one question.

619
00:32:12,761 --> 00:32:14,328
Are you drinking again?

620
00:32:14,396 --> 00:32:15,596
No!

621
00:32:15,664 --> 00:32:18,799
Okay, okay, I was just checking.

622
00:32:18,867 --> 00:32:20,901
Well...

623
00:32:20,969 --> 00:32:23,871
if that's really the way you feel,

624
00:32:23,939 --> 00:32:26,207
then you should be with him.

625
00:32:26,274 --> 00:32:30,111
And you have... my blessing.

626
00:32:30,178 --> 00:32:33,080
Really? You can forgive
me just like that?

627
00:32:33,148 --> 00:32:35,483
You know, I was doing a lot of thinking

628
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,451
since, you know, yesterday,

629
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,654
and I realized that, uh...

630
00:32:40,722 --> 00:32:43,958
it's hard to find... love.

631
00:32:44,025 --> 00:32:46,360
And when you do, you should grab it.

632
00:32:46,428 --> 00:32:48,562
And who cares what anybody thinks?

633
00:32:50,599 --> 00:32:53,968
And I really do want you to
be as happy as I am with Mike.

634
00:32:54,035 --> 00:32:55,836
Oh.

635
00:32:55,904 --> 00:32:57,505
Thank you, Susan.

636
00:33:00,408 --> 00:33:02,309
Don't worry, Susie Q.

637
00:33:02,377 --> 00:33:04,945
I'm going to do right by her.

638
00:33:05,013 --> 00:33:08,682
You really think you can change?

639
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,151
Well, it's easy

640
00:33:10,218 --> 00:33:12,820
when you've found a
woman worth changing for.

641
00:33:12,888 --> 00:33:14,121
Oh, I... I... I didn't mean...

642
00:33:14,189 --> 00:33:16,757
Oh! Ah! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

643
00:33:16,825 --> 00:33:20,361
Learned that in self-defense class.

644
00:33:23,165 --> 00:33:24,765
- Bye, mom.
- Bye, mom.

645
00:33:24,833 --> 00:33:25,936
- Bye-bye! - Hey,
we're taking off.

646
00:33:25,936 --> 00:33:27,729
- Okay.
- Wish your little angel luck.

647
00:33:27,729 --> 00:33:28,875
Oh, good luck, sweetie.

648
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:31,119
Now remember, your dad's
gonna videotape your pageant,

649
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:32,392
and we're all gonna watch it tomorrow.

650
00:33:32,392 --> 00:33:37,444
Sweetie, I'm sorry. You
know I'd be there, but...

651
00:33:37,512 --> 00:33:40,181
- You have to work.
- It's okay.

652
00:33:50,158 --> 00:33:52,226
Hey, guys! Wait up!

653
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:58,899
The doctor's putting him
under observation for 72 hours.

654
00:33:58,967 --> 00:34:02,336
It's standard procedure for...

655
00:34:02,404 --> 00:34:04,972
a suicide attempt.

656
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,807
It's okay, Mona.

657
00:34:06,875 --> 00:34:10,010
Thanks for everything.

658
00:34:13,548 --> 00:34:16,050
My baby...

659
00:34:16,117 --> 00:34:18,352
what were you thinkin', huh?

660
00:34:29,231 --> 00:34:31,398
I'm sorry I called the feds.

661
00:34:34,069 --> 00:34:36,503
I was trying to make your life easier

662
00:34:36,571 --> 00:34:40,608
after all the things I'd
done to make it harder.

663
00:34:40,675 --> 00:34:43,244
Oh, look what I've done to this kid.

664
00:34:47,749 --> 00:34:51,619
November 10th, 1991.

665
00:34:51,686 --> 00:34:53,654
It rained all day. Remember?

666
00:34:53,722 --> 00:34:54,922
Mm-hmm.

667
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:55,341
You went to the diner

668
00:34:55,341 --> 00:34:57,128
before we went to meet
up with the others.

669
00:34:57,128 --> 00:35:02,396
I had pumpkin pancakes.

670
00:35:02,464 --> 00:35:03,998
You didn't have anything.

671
00:35:04,065 --> 00:35:06,400
- I had coffee.
- Hmm.

672
00:35:06,468 --> 00:35:10,371
I forget my umbrella in the booth.

673
00:35:10,438 --> 00:35:14,008
And then eight hours later,
neither of us existed anymore.

674
00:35:20,282 --> 00:35:23,617
I had to run, but you didn't.

675
00:35:23,685 --> 00:35:27,721
You gave up a hell of a lot
just so I wouldn't be alone.

676
00:35:27,789 --> 00:35:29,657
I'd do it again.

677
00:35:29,724 --> 00:35:33,294
I'd do anything for you guys.

678
00:35:33,361 --> 00:35:35,296
I hope you know that.

679
00:35:35,363 --> 00:35:38,065
I do.

680
00:35:56,703 --> 00:35:59,014
Good morning, Lynette. It's 9:00.

681
00:35:59,014 --> 00:36:00,839
Got my reports?

682
00:36:00,907 --> 00:36:01,461
Almost.

683
00:36:01,461 --> 00:36:04,321
So are you telling me you're not done?

684
00:36:04,321 --> 00:36:06,165
I just need one more hour.

685
00:36:06,165 --> 00:36:11,352
Oh, Lynette. If only
I needed them by 10:00.

686
00:36:11,352 --> 00:36:15,621
Unfortunately, I told you
that I needed them by 9:00.

687
00:36:15,688 --> 00:36:18,190
- Was I not clear?
- You were crystal clear.

688
00:36:18,258 --> 00:36:19,174
It was impossible

689
00:36:19,174 --> 00:36:20,726
to get all this work
done in a night, Carlos.

690
00:36:20,726 --> 00:36:22,518
You knew that when you gave it to me.

691
00:36:22,518 --> 00:36:24,558
Well, it wouldn't have been impossible

692
00:36:24,558 --> 00:36:27,029
if you'd skipped your
daughter's pageant.

693
00:36:27,029 --> 00:36:30,014
I know you went.

694
00:36:30,014 --> 00:36:34,382
Anyway, this is very painful for me,

695
00:36:34,382 --> 00:36:35,527
but I have no other choice

696
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:36,832
but to terminate your employment.

697
00:36:38,031 --> 00:36:40,186
You're really going to do this?

698
00:36:40,186 --> 00:36:43,174
I believe I'm within my legal rights.

699
00:36:43,174 --> 00:36:45,820
You need to clear out
your personal belongings

700
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,098
within the hour, Mrs. Scavo.

701
00:36:53,326 --> 00:36:56,017
I was up all night on this.

702
00:36:56,017 --> 00:36:57,892
That's a shame.

703
00:36:57,892 --> 00:37:00,637
So Mr. Matthews has some
paperwork for you to sign.

704
00:37:00,637 --> 00:37:03,958
You're gonna regret this.
I'm not gonna go quietly.

705
00:37:09,828 --> 00:37:11,114
I don't care how you go.

706
00:37:11,114 --> 00:37:14,002
I just want you gone.

707
00:37:26,659 --> 00:37:29,261
Oh, good. You're up. I'm Mona Clarke.

708
00:37:29,329 --> 00:37:30,972
I live down the street
from you and your folks.

709
00:37:30,972 --> 00:37:33,120
I told them I would take
real good care of you.

710
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:36,503
- Would you like some juice, Danny?
- Tyler.

711
00:37:38,204 --> 00:37:39,671
What?

712
00:37:39,739 --> 00:37:43,141
It's not Danny.

713
00:37:45,111 --> 00:37:47,646
My name's Tyler.

714
00:37:52,885 --> 00:37:54,519
Bye, girls. Thanks for coming.

715
00:37:56,022 --> 00:37:58,023
Mike, what are you doing here?

716
00:37:58,091 --> 00:38:01,326
- I'm here to pick up M.J.
- But she said you couldn't make it.

717
00:38:01,394 --> 00:38:03,762
- She was picking him up for you.
- Who? Susan?

718
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:05,731
No, your neighbor Katherine.

719
00:38:05,798 --> 00:38:09,034
What?!

720
00:38:09,102 --> 00:38:11,737
Did I do something wrong?

721
00:38:25,885 --> 00:38:28,153
M.J.!

722
00:38:28,221 --> 00:38:29,821
Hi, daddy.

723
00:38:29,889 --> 00:38:31,490
I drove by Eileen's,

724
00:38:31,557 --> 00:38:33,692
and I... I saw my little
buddy standing out there.

725
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,794
He looked so forlorn.

726
00:38:39,365 --> 00:38:41,333
M.J., go home.

727
00:38:41,401 --> 00:38:43,335
I figured you were late at some job,

728
00:38:43,403 --> 00:38:46,271
- so I thought I'd do you a favor.
- Now.

729
00:38:58,017 --> 00:39:00,886
What did I tell you?

730
00:39:00,953 --> 00:39:03,388
I needed to talk to him, Mike.

731
00:39:03,456 --> 00:39:05,991
He deserves to know the truth.

732
00:39:06,059 --> 00:39:08,026
His mother lies to him.

733
00:39:08,094 --> 00:39:11,563
He needs to know that what
you and I had was real.

734
00:39:11,631 --> 00:39:15,267
You and I had nothing.

735
00:39:15,334 --> 00:39:18,103
How can you say that?

736
00:39:18,171 --> 00:39:20,372
It's true.

737
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,175
The whole time I was with you,

738
00:39:23,242 --> 00:39:25,177
all I thought about was Susan.

739
00:39:25,244 --> 00:39:27,546
Every time I held you,

740
00:39:27,613 --> 00:39:30,048
every time I kissed you,

741
00:39:30,116 --> 00:39:33,351
all I was thinking was,

742
00:39:33,419 --> 00:39:36,822
God, I wish you were Susan.

743
00:39:49,936 --> 00:39:52,137
If you mean it,

744
00:39:52,205 --> 00:39:55,040
then please kill me.

745
00:39:55,108 --> 00:39:58,210
It would be less painful.

746
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:06,651
I don't care enough
about you to kill you.

747
00:40:16,496 --> 00:40:21,867
The world is a dangerous place,

748
00:40:21,934 --> 00:40:24,035
and we must learn to defend ourselves

749
00:40:24,103 --> 00:40:27,205
from those who want to hurt us...

750
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:35,547
that stranger without a name...

751
00:40:38,518 --> 00:40:42,554
an employer who holds a grudge...

752
00:40:45,057 --> 00:40:48,994
the husband who won't let go.

753
00:40:49,061 --> 00:40:52,664
Yes, we all try to defend ourselves

754
00:40:52,732 --> 00:40:55,000
so we won't get hurt.

755
00:40:56,769 --> 00:41:00,238
Yes, I need an ambulance right away.

756
00:41:00,306 --> 00:41:01,907
4356 Wisteria Lane.

757
00:41:01,974 --> 00:41:05,076
Please hurry. I'm losing a lot of blood.

758
00:41:09,482 --> 00:41:13,952
Until the moment we realize our pain...

759
00:41:15,555 --> 00:41:18,549
can hurt someone else.
