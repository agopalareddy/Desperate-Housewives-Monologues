1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,350
Previously on Desperate Housewives...

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:08,080
In the wake of a tragedy,
a daughter was safe...

3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,000
You saved her life.
We owe you everything.

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,690
Orson was changed...

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,870
There's a good chance
your husband's paralyzed.

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,170
An unborn twin was gone...

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,620
We lost the baby...

8
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:20,600
but the other baby is fine.

9
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,480
- And an ex-husband...
- Karl didn't make it.

10
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,340
- Oh, my God.
-... was dead.

11
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,970
A month after the death of Karl Mayer,

12
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:39,860
his family assembled for
the reading of his will.

13
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:44,120
To each, Karl left
something to remember him by.

14
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:48,580
To his great aunt,
he left a grand piano.

15
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:53,090
To his favorite cousin,
he left gold cuff links.

16
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,930
To his beloved daughter,
he left cash and securities.

17
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:59,280
But Karl Mayer left

18
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,400
his most extraordinary possession of all

19
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,310
to someone who wasn't expecting a thing.

20
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,970
"and finally, to my
ex-wife, Susan Mayer..."

21
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,020
Hey, that's me.

22
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,460
Oh, I.. I.. I was just
here to support my daughter.

23
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:17,890
Seriously, I've been
playing Hangman on my phone.

24
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,270
You were saying?

25
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,190
"To my dearest Susie Q.

26
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:27,720
Who endured my infidelities
far longer than she should have,

27
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,050
years of cheating,

28
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,350
betrayals almost from the
day we were married..."

29
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,340
Can we just skip to the
part where I get stuff?

30
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,600
Oh, don't look at me like
that. You got the piano.

31
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:39,510
"While I was never good

32
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,350
at hiding my affairs of the flesh,

33
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,690
I'm ashamed to say that
I was more successful

34
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,100
- at concealing some of my financial affairs."
- What does that mean?

35
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,210
I think dad hid money from
you when you were married.

36
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,950
Well, it's not money, exactly.

37
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,830
It seems your ex-husband
was part owner in a business.

38
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,650
He was having affairs, ran a law firm

39
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,000
and he owned a secret business?

40
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,810
Glad you're finally
getting a little rest.

41
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:10,740
Now he specifically asks
that you keep an open mind.

42
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:12,960
It's very successful.

43
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,550
Well, if it's so successful,

44
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,780
why do I need to keep an open mind?

45
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:20,880
Yes, Karl Mayer left his ex-wife

46
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,460
something to remember him by...

47
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:32,140
Not that there was any
chance she would forget him.

48
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,050
All kinds of men go to

49
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,740
the Double D gentlemen's club.

50
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:56,150
Frat boys looking for a thrill...

51
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:59,440
Soldiers looking to get lucky...

52
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,020
CEOs looking to close a deal.

53
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:08,010
Yes, all kinds of men go to Double D's,

54
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,650
which can be very upsetting
to all kinds of women.

55
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,020
Susan Mayer?

56
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,160
Jimbo Rooney, co-owner of Double D's.

57
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,450
Uh, look, I was real sad to
hear about Karl's passing.

58
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,260
He was a good man,

59
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:26,180
and he cared about each and
every one of these dancers.

60
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,130
Oh, I'm sure.

61
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,300
Karl was always a big
supporter of the arts.

62
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,540
Uh, so who do I speak to

63
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:37,020
about selling my share
of herpes on parade?

64
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,510
Are you sure you want to do that?

65
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,830
Now business has been real good lately,

66
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,960
especially since we started
topless karaoke Tuesdays.

67
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:47,150
Well, as lucrative an
enterprise as that seems...

68
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,800
Take a look around. Have a drink.

69
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,920
And then if you want to sell,

70
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,660
you have your lawyer call me.

71
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,240
Oh. Look at that.

72
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,860
You made the o's in "Rooney" into boobs.

73
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:01,720
Lovely.

74
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:02,860
You like that?

75
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:05,680
Wait till you see my
partner Vic's business card.

76
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,230
He took the "v" and he made it into a...

77
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:12,200
Got it. I think I'd
really like that drink now.

78
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,820
Oh, um, thanks.

79
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:23,430
But I... I'm not here for the show.

80
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,320
I just found out that
I own half this place.

81
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,980
Oh, no kidding. Well, nice to meet you.

82
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,970
I'm Jennifer Morelli, but
at 10:00, I'm "Destiny".

83
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,680
Oh, well, I'm Susan Delfino.

84
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:37,140
At 10:00, I am in a flannel nightgown.

85
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,050
Hey, we have a Delfino
that comes in here.

86
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,640
Really?

87
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,260
Well, it's a pretty common name.

88
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:47,060
- I think he's a plumber.
- Really?

89
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,440
Well, maybe there's another
plumber with that last name.

90
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,710
Mike... that's it. Mike Delfino.

91
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:54,670
Tall guy, brown hair, nice smile?

92
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,360
Big busted nose?

93
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,030
Oh, I don't think so.

94
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,230
Well, wait till the
next time you see him.

95
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,380
A TV? You guys didn't have to do that.

96
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:09,880
Yes, we absolutely did.
We have a family rule...

97
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,920
You saved our daughter from
being squashed by a plane,

98
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,790
you get a 60-inch plasma.

99
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,890
- and a faux leather remote caddy.
- Oh, thanks.

100
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:22,010
- This is very generous.
- Please. We could never make up for what you did.

101
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:25,220
Or for how I behaved toward
you the past couple of weeks.

102
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,590
- I was such a bitch.
- Oh, we both said things.

103
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,570
Yeah, but I said a lot
worse, a lot louder.

104
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,470
Yeah, you did.

105
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,840
By the way, I talked to human resources,

106
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,320
and they are fine with
continuing to pay you

107
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:42,380
- until the baby is born and for six weeks after that.
- Carlos, that's amazing.

108
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,340
So will Terrence fill
in until I get back?

109
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:48,740
- Actually, no. He took the job in Miami.
- So who's gonna take up the slack?

110
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:51,990
Well, I'll put in extra
hours, work weekends.

111
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:54,740
Don't worry about it.
You focus on that baby.

112
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:57,970
- Really? I don't want to have this fall on you.
- Carlos, we gotta get going.

113
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,530
We've got Juanita's
interview at Oakridge.

114
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,260
- Oh, right. Lynette, do not worry. I got your back.
- But I feel so guilty

115
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:06,200
taking your money and
leaving you in the lurch.

116
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:11,020
Hey, I got a crazy idea.
What if I fill in for Lynette?

117
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:12,830
Oh, honey, they're in a
hurry. No time for jokes.

118
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,130
I'm serious. I... I've done her job...

119
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,340
or pretty damn similar...
when I was in advertising.

120
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,900
I could step in for her until
she gets back on her feet.

121
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,690
Oh, but that's putting
Carlos in an awkward position.

122
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,840
- I think it's a great idea.
- Me, too.

123
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:30,180
No. No, I think it's a
great idea, in theory,

124
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:33,970
but it's just... it's
such a complicated job.

125
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,560
You don't think I can handle it?

126
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:41,120
No. No, I think you'd be wonderful.

127
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:45,430
- Great, it's settled then. Tom, you start tomorrow.
- There you go, Lynette.

128
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,070
Now you have nothing
to feel guilty about.

129
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,310
Right. Right.

130
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,770
Well, thanks again for the TV.

131
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,900
You guys have been way too generous.

132
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,000
You made scones. My favorite.

133
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:04,840
I know. Take as many as you like.

134
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:09,320
So... what did you want to see me about?

135
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:12,870
- Well, I wanted to give you this donation for the building fund.
- Oh.

136
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,730
And I also have some
things in the garage

137
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:17,750
for the rummage sale,
and I am also available

138
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,000
to run the next Sunday
school pancake breakfast.

139
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,390
Oh, good heavens.

140
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:26,670
Bree, what a wonderful
display of Christian charity.

141
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:29,190
I just want to do my part.

142
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:33,400
Does this have anything
to do with the plane crash?

143
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,380
In a manner of speaking.

144
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,260
Do you want to talk about it?

145
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,090
I can't. It would change
how you feel about me.

146
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,710
Bree, I've known you for years.
I don't think that's possible.

147
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,980
I had an affair.

148
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,510
Are you okay?

149
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:57,790
Um, before you confess a sin that big,

150
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,130
just try to wait till I've swallowed.

151
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,930
Oh.

152
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,150
Who was the affair with?

153
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:08,010
Karl Mayer.

154
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,100
He was killed in the plane crash...

155
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:13,410
The same one that injured Orson.

156
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,270
You must feel terribly
guilty about this.

157
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:19,560
I can't eat. I can't sleep.

158
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:22,160
That's why I wanted
you to come over here.

159
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,860
I have to do something
to make this right.

160
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,780
Well, seems to me the first
step is for you and Orson

161
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:31,150
to get into our marriage
outreach program.

162
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,040
Oh, it's too late for that.
We're about to get a divorce.

163
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:38,010
Yes, but this was before Orson
was in a wheelchair, right?

164
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,880
Well, yes.

165
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:43,130
I think you know what you need
to do to atone for this sin.

166
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,120
I think you knew it before
I walked in the door.

167
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:49,700
You want me to bring Orson
home and take care of him?

168
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,630
It's just that I'm not sure

169
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,570
that I love him anymore.

170
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:57,120
Bree...

171
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,680
There's a quote I've always loved.

172
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,410
"You cannot make yourself feel
something that you do not feel,

173
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,860
but you can make yourself do right

174
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,750
in spite of your feelings."

175
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,140
I don't remember that from the bible.

176
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:13,490
It's from Pearl Buck.

177
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,600
I am allowed to read
other books, you know.

178
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,390
Bree, no matter what
you feel about Orson,

179
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:21,220
if you don't help him now,

180
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:23,550
you won't be able to live with yourself.

181
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,800
Fine.

182
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:30,130
I'll tell Orson tomorrow,

183
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,120
and I'll bring him home.

184
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,680
Good.

185
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,140
Mmm!

186
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,190
I think you've had enough.

187
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,540
- Julie! Hold up.
- Hey. What's going on?

188
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:47,200
Eddie's doing stand-up
at the Chuckle Zone

189
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,760
on open Mike night.

190
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,970
Stand-up? As in comedy?

191
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,580
Well, people are always
telling me how funny I am,

192
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,530
so I decided to give the
people what they want.

193
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:59,170
Don't miss out. I got this
whole riff about airline food.

194
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,480
It's gonna kill.

195
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,960
Hey, Porter! Hold up!

196
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,690
When people tell him he's
funny, doesn't he realize

197
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:10,490
- they're being funny?
- Tell me you're going. I can't be the only one there.

198
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,140
I'll... I'll try. I, uh,
I actually gotta pack.

199
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,340
My dad left me some money,

200
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:19,560
- so I'm going back east to see my cousins.
- For how long?

201
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:23,160
Until they catch the
guy who attacked me,

202
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,940
I just don't feel safe here.

203
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,580
- I get that.
- Hmm.

204
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:33,040
I've been wanting to ask you something.

205
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:35,440
I... I heard you were in the hospital

206
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,240
because of an overdose.

207
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,440
You didn't do that

208
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,460
Because of...

209
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:47,110
I was dealing with a lot of stuff...

210
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,250
problems with my parents
having to move again.

211
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,460
I got really lonely.

212
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:56,210
And yeah, I guess you were part of it.

213
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,770
I'm better now.

214
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:02,930
Good.

215
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,290
Life has its low points, and
we just have to deal with them.

216
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,410
Speaking of which,

217
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,320
How do we get out of this?

218
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:17,530
Well, your timing is impeccable,

219
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,380
because it just so happens that
we have an opening right on.

220
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,610
Yes, we heard, and we're so excited.

221
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:25,780
Everyone knows that this is
the best private school in town.

222
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:29,880
It says here that you have
been homeschooling Juanita.

223
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,580
How's that been going?

224
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:36,410
It's been so rewarding spending
time with my little angel.

225
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,770
It breaks my heart to see it end.

226
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,810
Anyway, here's her
lunch. It's all packed.

227
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,320
And we'll pick her up at 4:00.

228
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,650
Uh, wait... wait just a second.

229
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,940
There are a few other families
on the waiting list before you.

230
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,400
Oh, there are?

231
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:58,000
Yes, but Susan Delfino gave you
such a glowing recommendation.

232
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,690
And to be quite frank,

233
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,780
We could use a little more
diversity in this school.

234
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:03,780
It's been quite a long time

235
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:06,440
since we've had a little
girl of Mexican descent.

236
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:10,140
Ah, well, we are very
proud of our heritage...

237
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:12,050
but Juanita can stand on her own merits.

238
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,100
- She's very bright.
- And I know I'm biased,

239
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:17,220
but I do think she's
a budding young genius.

240
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,030
I'm Mexican?

241
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,700
Honey, what did you just say?

242
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:27,200
He called me Mexican.

243
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:30,100
You are Mexican, honey. You know that.

244
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,260
Since when? I thought we were American.

245
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:38,590
Yes, but our ancestors came from Mexico.

246
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,040
Really? So we're like those people

247
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:44,040
who sell oranges on
the side of the road?

248
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,250
You're busy. We should go.

249
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,320
Thank you so very much for your time.

250
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,730
And, uh, again, we really
want to join you here

251
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,600
and help you with that diversity
thing, so just let us know.

252
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:59,460
- Just say it.
- I don't even know what that means.

253
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,750
Just say it!

254
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,840
Adios, senior.

255
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:10,680
This is fine.

256
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,920
Thank you.

257
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,060
Thank you for agreeing to see me.

258
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:19,610
I called a few times, but
you, uh, didn't pick up.

259
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,500
I had no idea.

260
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:24,870
My phone was in my pants
pocket, and I had it on vibrate.

261
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,330
And as you may have noticed, I...

262
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,100
So how's rehab?

263
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,480
Painful.

264
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,540
Well, the doctor says
with a lot of hard work,

265
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:37,130
you maybe be able to walk again someday.

266
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,220
Yes, they're very upbeat and optimistic.

267
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:42,910
I want to run them over with this chair.

268
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,000
So...

269
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,620
why are you here?

270
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,640
Well, I know we've been
through a lot lately,

271
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:51,430
but I decided it would be
best for you to come home

272
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,420
so I can take care of you.

273
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:59,260
Yes, I'd rather be cared for
by a flatulent helper monkey.

274
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:02,060
- Orson, I know you're angry, but I'm still your wife.
- Well, apparently we have

275
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:04,300
very different definitions
of the word "wife."

276
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:07,380
- I am proceeding with the divorce.
- I don't understand.

277
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:09,810
Three weeks ago you were
begging me for another chance.

278
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,190
What happened?

279
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,140
Karl Mayer happened.

280
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:15,190
I could forgive you

281
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,620
if you betrayed me with
anyone remotely admirable,

282
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,790
but you chose

283
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:21,970
the most contemptible
man I have ever known.

284
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:23,380
No, Bree,

285
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,050
I do not need you.

286
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,240
I'm having a ramp built at the house,

287
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,860
and I've turned the downstairs
study into your bedroom.

288
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,310
You're coming home where you belong,

289
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,300
and that's all there is to it.

290
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:48,860
You can start forgiving me,
and I'll start forgiving you.

291
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,870
I suggest you start first.

292
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,970
I don't understand. How could
you not know you're Mexican?

293
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,900
We eat Mexican food all the time.

294
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:05,360
We eat Chinese food, too.
Does that mean I'm Chinese?

295
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:08,230
No, that just means your
mother hates to cook.

296
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,480
Well, apparently, we have to
spell everything out for you.

297
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,200
- You do know you're a girl, right?
- Gaby.

298
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:20,790
What? Half the women in
your family have mustaches.

299
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,890
It could be very confusing.

300
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:28,190
Juanita, go inside and
play with your sister.

301
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:31,320
And while you're at it,
tell her she's Mexican, too!

302
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,020
I can't believe it.

303
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,030
We had that school right in our hands.

304
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,970
- How could we let it get away?
- The bigger question is how did we let our daughter

305
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,760
- grow up thinking she's white?
- Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Solis.

306
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,860
Hey, Parker.

307
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,010
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

308
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,380
I had to pick up some lumber
to build that ramp for Orson.

309
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:08,230
Oh, what a good person you are.

310
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:10,750
Hey, I need to pay
the paperboy tomorrow.

311
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,460
- Do you have any cash?
- I think I have a $20 on me.

312
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,280
Wouldn't you rather...

313
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:20,760
stick it in here?

314
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:22,510
Couldn't we just leave
it in the mailbox,

315
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,580
- like we usually do?
- Oh, I just thought

316
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,780
that's the way you do
it down at Double D's.

317
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:30,970
- Double D's?
- Yeah, turns out Karl was a part owner

318
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,690
and left me his share.

319
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,520
By the way,

320
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,960
"Destiny" says hello.

321
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,140
Okay. I see where
you're going with this.

322
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:42,470
Do you, Mike Delfino?

323
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,090
That's what she calls you, you know.

324
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:46,050
Because that's my name.

325
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,360
No one hanging from a
pole should know your name.

326
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:51,560
Susan, that place is one of my accounts.

327
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,050
I'm their plumber.

328
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,790
And that's it?

329
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:57,630
- You go there just to do the plumbing and nothing else?
- Well...

330
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,900
Liar! Destiny said you had
a beer there the other night.

331
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:02,240
Okay.

332
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:05,440
Sometimes when I finish
the job, I'll have a beer.

333
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,370
And you never look at the girls?

334
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:11,820
It's... it's... it's
completely innocent.

335
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,760
I... I... I don't buy that.

336
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:17,300
I want to see the "completely
innocent" look you have

337
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,690
when Destiny shakes her
tassels in your face.

338
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,260
Okay, so I've gone to a strip club.

339
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:24,300
Are we gonna laugh about this,
or you gonna make it a thing?

340
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:28,810
- Well, I am leaning towards "thing."
- Fine. If it bothers you that much,

341
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,340
next time I finish a job
there, I'll come right home.

342
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,380
Oh, you don't have to worry,

343
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:36,850
because you will not be working
there anymore. I forbid it.

344
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,090
You forbid it?

345
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,570
What kind of marriage is this?

346
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,930
The kind where the husband
wants to look at strippers

347
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,670
and the wife forbids it.

348
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:50,590
Susan, I love you.

349
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:54,340
I have never cheated
on you and I never will.

350
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:58,370
But you're not gonna tell
me what I can or can't do.

351
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,290
Let me get this straight...

352
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:05,540
You forbid Mike from
going to a strip club?

353
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:07,270
I know it was a little heavy-handed,

354
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:10,160
- but I just can't stand those places.
- Oh, what's the big whoop?

355
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:12,620
Carlos takes clients to
the strip club all the time.

356
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:16,380
I've been to one... the ass menagerie.

357
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,140
It was my brother's bachelor party.

358
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:21,670
This stripper named
Cinnamon gave me a lap dance.

359
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,490
Luckily, if I squinted just enough,

360
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,510
she looked like a young Ricky Schroder.

361
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:27,780
See, this is the reason
men go to those places...

362
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:32,620
- So they can fantasize. We all do it.
- You fantasize about other men when you're with Carlos?

363
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:34,400
Honey, Carlos has been
so many different men,

364
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:37,910
I'm actually surprised when I
open my eyes and it's Carlos.

365
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:40,350
Want to know who I fantasize about?

366
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,660
No, not necessarily.
Anyone want more wine?

367
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,320
Tom Scavo.

368
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:46,640
Wine now.

369
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,540
4th of July barbecue.

370
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,350
Those tan shorts.

371
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,900
Oh, I am there right now. Ooh!

372
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,320
Okay, could we please get
back to the issue at hand?

373
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:57,240
Look, bottom line is

374
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,720
you cannot forbid a man
to go to strip clubs.

375
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,850
And don't expect him to
understand why it bothers you.

376
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,710
That's just the way they are. Right?

377
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:09,240
Sorry. I was just
imagining Ricky Schroder...

378
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:11,480
wearing Tom Scavo's shorts.

379
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:20,160
Are you sure you want to
just give away your CDs?

380
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:22,530
The more you take, the
less I have to pack.

381
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,760
- In fact, is there anything else you want?
- Anything?

382
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,690
Okay. How about... Danny Bolen?

383
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,980
Uh, he's not really mine to give.

384
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,040
Come on. He's totally into you,

385
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,680
which is a complete mystery to me.

386
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:41,460
You know what? I think
I'm just gonna keep my CDs.

387
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:42,820
Okay, I... I didn't mean it like that.

388
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,730
It's just you don't seem interested,

389
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:49,530
- and I have sent every signal I can think of.
- Why are you so hung up on Danny?

390
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,510
Hello. He's hot.

391
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,650
Okay, here's the thing...

392
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,020
Danny's in kind of a
fragile place right now.

393
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:58,760
He really doesn't need
to get his heart broken.

394
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,360
I'm not gonna snag him
just to toss him aside.

395
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:03,510
I don't use people, Julie.

396
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,560
Okay, I used some people.

397
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:09,660
But I wouldn't use him.

398
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,420
Are you sure?

399
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,930
Yeah. I think we have a lot in common,

400
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,260
and if he'd just spend a little
time with me, he'd realize that.

401
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,420
You like stand-up comedy?

402
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:25,630
Yeah.

403
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,820
Too bad. We're gonna go see Eddie.

404
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,080
- Hey, honey.
- Hey.

405
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:36,460
Sorry I'm late.

406
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,220
How was work?

407
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:39,340
Crazy.

408
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,700
I had three conference calls

409
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,050
and a 2-hour client
meeting with Gary Danner.

410
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,800
- Oh.
- Mm. How was your day?

411
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,300
Even crazier.

412
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,950
I peed twice in every
bathroom in the house.

413
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,640
What's that?

414
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:57,060
Oh, little matching outfits for
the twins that people gave us.

415
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,590
I thought I'd give them to charity.

416
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,230
I ran into the Petersons today.

417
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:06,010
They just heard, wanted
to see how you were.

418
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:06,770
Mm.

419
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,000
So Gary Danner...

420
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,590
He's a prickly S.O.B.

421
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,670
Tell me about it.

422
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:18,130
Check out this proposal
I worked up for him.

423
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:22,600
Hmm.

424
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,640
What do you mean, "hmm"?

425
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,880
I'm glad you showed this
to me. I know Danner.

426
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:30,640
- And trust me, you do not want to go down this road.
- Why not?

427
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,190
- Don't worry. I can fix it. Where's
a pen? - Wait, honey, a-actually...

428
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:37,360
I showed it to Danner
today. He loved it.

429
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,420
Gary Danner liked this?

430
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,300
No, he loved it,

431
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,710
But not as much as
Carlos. He told me it was

432
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:47,200
the best written proposal
he has ever seen, bar none.

433
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:49,530
What's for dinner?

434
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,400
Meat loaf.

435
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:52,850
Mmm.

436
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:55,960
What's wrong?

437
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:59,210
Nothing. It's j... well,
that's quite a compliment.

438
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,250
- Yeah.
- Not to mention a bit of a slam on the work that I did.

439
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,300
Honey, he's just encouraging me.

440
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:09,280
- I don't think he was thinking about you at all.
- Oh. Okay.

441
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:12,360
By the way, this meat loaf...

442
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:13,990
The best I have ever tasted.

443
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,300
- Bar none?
- Hmm?

444
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:17,290
Just eat.

445
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:27,360
Wow. It's coming along beautifully.

446
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:30,350
Thanks. So, uh, when's
Orson coming home?

447
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:32,910
Oh, uh, it's still a bit up in the air.

448
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:36,120
But I guess now would be
a good time to call him

449
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,540
And let him know we're almost ready.

450
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:43,430
Uh, yes. Orson Hodge's room, please.

451
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:46,540
Would you stop hammering for a moment?

452
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,880
He checked out?

453
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,560
But that's impossible.
Where would he have gone?

454
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,800
- Mike, please.
- It's not me.

455
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:03,380
Never mind. I think I found him.

456
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:09,820
Oh, boy. The fat's in the fire now.

457
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,640
What is going on here?

458
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:14,990
The husband you're
divorcing has found new digs.

459
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,090
Before you jump down my throat...

460
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,190
Roy and I are on fixed incomes.

461
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:20,900
You can't blame us for
taking in a boarder,

462
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:23,330
especially one who can't
get to the second story.

463
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:25,150
That's our naked floor.

464
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,090
What are you doing here?

465
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,760
Enjoying my new home.

466
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,890
It's rather quaint,

467
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,860
once you get used to the smell
of denture cream and scotch.

468
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,280
Oh, don't mind me.

469
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:50,580
Just making sure you don't
slap a guy in a wheelchair.

470
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:54,770
So how are you planning
to pay your rent?

471
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,990
Well, I'm a bit
cash-strapped at the moment.

472
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:59,470
But karen knows I'm good for it.

473
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:01,420
Yeah, once he gets
his divorce settlement,

474
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,200
he's writing me a big, fat check.

475
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,700
So how long are we
talking? A month, two?

476
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:10,700
There will be no divorce, and
if he tries to file for one,

477
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,990
there will be delays,
motions and appeals.

478
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,930
It could take years for
him to ever see a dime.

479
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:20,670
Your wife loves you. Go home.

480
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,550
Bree, stop right now. Do you hear me?

481
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:30,510
So am I taking down the ramp?

482
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,120
Leave it.

483
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,100
You'll need it soon enough.

484
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,240
Almost home, dear.

485
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,890
Mike, call the police. My
wife is holding me hostage!

486
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,560
We've all been there, big guy.

487
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:48,460
Lynette.

488
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:50,580
I had an appointment with
my O.B. around the corner,

489
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:53,730
- and I just thought I'd stop by and say hi.
- Oh.

490
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:56,500
I also wanted to thank you

491
00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:00,220
for being so nice to
tom, our little temp.

492
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:02,260
- How's he doing?
- He's amazing.

493
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,310
It's okay, Carlos. You
can tell me the truth.

494
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:11,220
He's knocking my socks off.
Everybody is so impressed.

495
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,430
Well, good.

496
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,480
Good, good, good.

497
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,830
I'm so proud of him.

498
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:20,370
But when I drop this kid,
Tom's out on his ass, right?

499
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:21,910
Excuse me?

500
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,930
I love him and I'm glad
he's doing well here,

501
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,840
but this is my job.

502
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:29,560
At some point, I'm gonna want it back.

503
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:32,680
And I say that as the
woman who dove in front

504
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,570
of a spinning propeller
to save your child's life.

505
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,460
Of course this is your job.

506
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:43,980
And you can have it
back any time you want.

507
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,800
Well, that's all I needed to hear.

508
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,010
It's just that I was
under the impression

509
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,820
you were planning to stay
at home with your baby.

510
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:58,760
And why would you be
under that impression?

511
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:01,930
That's what Tom said.

512
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,730
What exactly did tom say?

513
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:11,040
Lynette, I really don't want
to get in the middle of this.

514
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,070
Carlos, I saved a member of your family.

515
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,990
It doesn't mean I can't
take another one out.

516
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,460
And... and... and you can train a dog

517
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:21,500
to do almost anything,
but you can't do, um,

518
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,670
you can't do with cats and... cats.

519
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:25,480
And did you ever try
to get a cat to fetch?

520
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:28,010
They're like, you
know, they won't do it.

521
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:31,020
Stupid cats. Am I right, people?

522
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,300
Well... well, hey, you
guys have been great.

523
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:37,830
Good night.

524
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,220
Give it up for Eddie Orlofsky

525
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,080
Come on, folks!

526
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,590
Yeah! Whoo!

527
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,700
So, what do you think?

528
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:51,040
I never realized there were

529
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:52,550
so many differences
between dogs and cats.

530
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:54,990
That's why I'm the comic, babe.

531
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:59,210
I'm off to get my free drink.

532
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,750
Porter,

533
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:09,280
I left my jacket in
the car. Walk me out?

534
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,840
Jacket? It's hot as hell in here.

535
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:15,210
Ooh. Now I feel a chill.

536
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:15,980
Mm-hmm.

537
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,650
Um... I gotta use the bathroom.

538
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:31,470
Okay, what is your problem?

539
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,170
Excuse me?

540
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,170
Whenever we're alone together,
you find some reason to bail.

541
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,160
Why aren't you into me?

542
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,740
Ana, there's not a lot
of room to be into you.

543
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:43,920
Because of how much you're into you.

544
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,770
You did not just call me conceited.

545
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,390
Chill. It's not like I
asked you to spell it.

546
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,950
I'm not stupid, and I am definitely

547
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,990
not the attention whore at this table.

548
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,120
I heard about your little
stunt with the pills.

549
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,020
Okay, that was mean.

550
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,270
I'm sorry that I said that.

551
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,270
Don't be sorry.

552
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:10,800
You're right.

553
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,440
I like the blunt Ana

554
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:19,560
more than the cute Ana.

555
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:23,500
So...

556
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,630
you think I'm cute?

557
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,200
You're home. Perfect timing.

558
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,330
Margaritas. What's the occasion?

559
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:38,510
We're getting drunk, Mexican style.

560
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,120
Principal Hobson just called,

561
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:42,830
and Juanita got accepted to Oakridge.

562
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:43,990
Seriously?

563
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,140
I am free from homeschooling.

564
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:48,050
No more fighting, no more threats,

565
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:50,690
and no more parent-teacher
conferences with you.

566
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:53,500
Mmm.

567
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,320
Ahh. Come on. Start guzzlin'.

568
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,010
Uh, I don't think she should go.

569
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,700
- Huh?
- I've been thinking about it all day.

570
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:10,470
Let's keep her in public school.

571
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:12,700
- We can't. She was expelled.
- I made some calls.

572
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:14,270
Jefferson elementary can take her.

573
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,960
That's way out in my pleasant.

574
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,650
Yeah, and there's a
lot of Latino families

575
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:19,410
- that live in that area.
- So what?

576
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,080
We have a much better school
right here in our backyard.

577
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,650
I'm not schlepping way over there

578
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:25,170
just so she can be with those people.

579
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:31,210
"those" people? Don't
you mean our people?

580
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:34,690
Our people are the rich
private school people.

581
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:38,380
Oh, my God. I know exactly
what is going on here.

582
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,670
What? You are ashamed of being Mexican.

583
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:44,530
- Oh, that's insane.
- No, it totally makes sense.

584
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,380
All of our friends are white.

585
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,510
You didn't want me to
teach the girls Spanish.

586
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,700
Because I don't understand it,

587
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,590
and I didn't want you guys
plotting behind my back.

588
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:52,850
And when we bought this house,

589
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,080
and I said we would be the only
Mexicans in the neighborhood,

590
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,270
do you remember what you said?

591
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:58,970
- "Fine by me."
- You're right. It's my fault.

592
00:29:59,090 --> 00:29:59,990
I should have told the realtor,

593
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,800
"forget square footage and central air.

594
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,610
Find us something next
door to a Mariachi bar."

595
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:07,490
Deny it all you want. You
are a self-hating Mexican.

596
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,750
Oh, yeah, well, you're
a self-wiping Mexican.

597
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,650
What does that mean?

598
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:20,920
Hey, you.

599
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,100
Traffic was insane.

600
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:27,420
Is there any dinner left?
I haven't eaten since lunch.

601
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,180
Everything okay?

602
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:34,080
I talked to Carlos today.

603
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,230
About what?

604
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,920
He was under the impression
that when I have this baby,

605
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:41,750
I'll be staying home with her.

606
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:46,270
Where would he get a
crazy idea like that?

607
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,510
I told him.

608
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:51,520
Wow! You're not even denying it?

609
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:54,200
I thought it might be
in your best interest.

610
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:55,910
Seriously?

611
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:59,940
You know how much that job means to me.

612
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:03,170
You know how much I hate
being a stay-at-home Mom.

613
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:05,650
How could you think
I'd be okay with this?

614
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:08,340
Because we lost a baby.

615
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:17,540
Honey, I thought you might
want to stay home with this one,

616
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:20,960
because she's all the more
precious, given what happened.

617
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:23,980
Oh.

618
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,140
So that's how I'm supposed to feel.

619
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:29,480
I don't know how you feel Lynette,

620
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:31,430
because you never talk about it.

621
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,290
It's been a month. Every
time I try to bring it up,

622
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,230
- you just... you change the subject.
- Because I'm dealing with it.

623
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,050
Well, shouldn't we be
dealing with it together?

624
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:40,710
You want to talk about this?

625
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:43,670
- Yes!
- Fine! We lost a kid we'll never meet him.

626
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:45,610
We'll spend the rest of
our lives looking at one,

627
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:47,320
always wondering why there aren't two.

628
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:50,320
How can saying this out loud be helpful?

629
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:58,190
You're right. It's not.

630
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,410
You win.

631
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,220
After you have the baby,

632
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,410
go back to your job.

633
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:11,970
Thank you.

634
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:18,870
You want me to fix you something?

635
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:23,300
I'm not... I'm not hungry anymore.

636
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:30,850
Now remember, fellas,

637
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,470
these ladies don't work for free.

638
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:38,460
Hey, Rooney.

639
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:41,090
Oh, hey, Mike. Long time no see.

640
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:43,060
Yeah, I got the call about
your John being backed up.

641
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:46,100
What? No, our bathrooms
are working just fine.

642
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:49,240
That's weird. Some woman called
and said it was an emergency.

643
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:53,310
I'm sorry, man. I... I
don't know what to tell you.

644
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,370
All right, it's time to introduce

645
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,590
our newest double D doll...

646
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,390
Miss Fix-it!

647
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:11,160
What the hell?

648
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,030
Susan!

649
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:21,500
Mike! What are you doing here?

650
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,240
What the hell are you doing?

651
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:26,810
Oh, well, since I'm one of the owners,

652
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,160
I figured I should
really learn the business,

653
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,990
from my bottom up.

654
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:33,880
Hey, you mind?

655
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:35,750
I'm trying to make a deposit here.

656
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:40,280
- Hey!
- Will you come down from there right now?

657
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:44,180
Why? They're just looking.
It's completely innocent.

658
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:45,160
Right?

659
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:49,250
Hey, pal. Sit down.

660
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,200
I didn't come here to
see the back of your head.

661
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:53,700
This is not funny.

662
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:55,740
Oh, I can't talk.

663
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:58,210
I've got a room full of
Neanderthals to entertain.

664
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,170
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing?

665
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:06,730
Just giving people what they want.

666
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:11,190
Don't you dare. Susan, I'm serious.

667
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:13,440
I want you off of that stage right now.

668
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:16,820
Wait. Are you forbidding
me from doing something?

669
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,760
I thought we didn't have
that kind of marriage.

670
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:23,610
Very cute. If I have to, I will
carry you out of here myself.

671
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,240
Oh, what exactly is the problem, Mike?

672
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:28,220
Oh!

673
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,510
Okay. I get it.

674
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:38,970
I will never come back here.

675
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:42,430
Aw! Come on!

676
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:47,050
Let's go home, Mrs. Fix-it.

677
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:50,380
Wait. Wait. Forgot my tips!

678
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:25,650
What are you looking at?

679
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:29,140
Nothing. Just some old photos.

680
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:32,940
I didn't know you had these.

681
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,730
We couldn't afford frames,

682
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:38,300
so my dad would put these
on the wall with tape.

683
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:42,130
Is that you?

684
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:45,250
Yeah. I was about 5.

685
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:47,870
- You're cute.
- Hmm.

686
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,760
But that toolshed's seen better days.

687
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,750
That was our house.

688
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,250
Wow.

689
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,490
It's funny.

690
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:05,310
I'm smiling in all of
these photos, but...

691
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:08,360
I hated that town.

692
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,380
Everybody was so poor.
Everybody was Mexican.

693
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,750
Back then I thought
they were the same thing.

694
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:24,290
And even though I was only
5, I knew I wanted out.

695
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:29,260
And you can call it
self-loathing, Carlos,

696
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:31,900
but I just...

697
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,660
don't want my kids to ever
know I lived like that.

698
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:41,830
That's your dad.

699
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:44,200
Yeah.

700
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,260
He was so strong.

701
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:50,550
I would run to meet him

702
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,320
when he'd come home from
working in the factories,

703
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:53,840
and he'd lift me up on his shoulders.

704
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:57,270
I loved that.

705
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,660
I bet he did, too.

706
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,400
I used to ask him, "Papa,
why do you work so much?"

707
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:07,780
And he would say,

708
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:10,800
"so one day we can live
in a beautiful house."

709
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:16,090
But we never did.

710
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,040
But you do now.

711
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,870
Your father had dreams, Gaby,

712
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,770
but they were for you,

713
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,780
and he sacrificed a lot to get you here.

714
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:38,690
Whatever our children achieve in life,

715
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,810
it's because of dreams that started

716
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:45,190
on the shoulders of a
proud, strong, Mexican man.

717
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:49,780
That is why I want our kids
to know where they came from.

718
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,370
I want that, too.

719
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,220
So, um...

720
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:14,250
How do your physical
therapists think you're doing?

721
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,490
Do they think you're making progress?

722
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:30,260
Orson, it's been three days.

723
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,120
You're gonna have to
talk to me sometime.

724
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,600
I know why you're doing this, Bree.

725
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:40,290
Reverend Sykes stopped by
to check on my progress.

726
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:42,600
He was very proud of himself

727
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:45,680
for convincing you to
take me on as charity work.

728
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,150
It's not charity work.

729
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,660
When I had that affair,
I didn't just betray you.

730
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,550
I betrayed my faith as well.

731
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,350
So please, you have to let
me help you or I am gonna...

732
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:58,840
Or you won't get into heaven?

733
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:05,180
Didn't realize how
much this means to you.

734
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,630
I guess I can find a way to be happy.

735
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,530
Thank you so much, Orson.

736
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:16,060
I am gonna take such good care of you.

737
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,610
By the way, my soup is cold.

738
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:23,990
Oh.

739
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:26,630
Well, mine is hot.

740
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,230
You can have this.

741
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,370
Oh, while you're up, could
you get me a glass of wine?

742
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:43,240
Yes, of course.

743
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,840
And perhaps for dessert,

744
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:48,200
some of your delicious Crème brulée.

745
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:51,580
Orson, that takes over
an hour to prepare. I...

746
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,900
Well, I would do it myself, but...

747
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,060
Oh, and we're out of vanilla beans.

748
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:09,100
You might have to run to the store.

749
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:34,340
The act itself is quite simple...

750
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,910
You strip away the outer layer

751
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:40,600
and reveal what's underneath.

752
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:42,140
Of course,

753
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:46,390
sometimes the results
can be quite surprising.

754
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:51,880
If you strip away the
veneer of happy domesticity,

755
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,660
you may find grief.

756
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,280
If you strip away that facade of wealth,

757
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:02,470
you may find self-loathing.

758
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:08,300
If you strip away the
veil of helplessness,

759
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,240
you may find cruelty.

760
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:19,570
Yes, stripping can be
a dangerous pastime.

761
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:23,030
But for a lucky few,

762
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:25,000
it can also be...

763
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:28,000
a lot of fun.
