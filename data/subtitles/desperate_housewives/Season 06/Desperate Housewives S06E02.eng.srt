1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,840
Previously on...

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,920
It was a joyous occasion until...

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:06,850
Did I miss anything?

4
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:09,080
I'm asking you nicely to leave.

5
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,670
If you won't, I will drag you
out of this church myself.

6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,820
I don't love these babies.

7
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,990
Lynette struggled with her pregnancy.

8
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,800
Stop saying that.

9
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,460
Gaby made a commitment...

10
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,030
I am now officially your guardian.

11
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:22,800
- And Bree...
- I'm married.

12
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,410
To a man who's blackmailing you.

13
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,740
Jumped in with both feet.

14
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:28,950
I think we could be happy here, right, Danny?

15
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,170
New neighbors...

16
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,150
Would you like to go to a movie sometime?

17
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,440
Moved in.

18
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,170
Look, Danny, please let me explain.

19
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,870
- Go to hell.
- What's gotten into that kid?

20
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,120
- He's a teenager.
- Go look for him.

21
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:43,130
And evil made an appearance on Wisteria Lane.

22
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:55,150
The first time Karen McCluskey saw Roy Bender, 
she did something she didn't expect to do.

23
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,610
She smiled.

24
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:04,530
The next time they met, Roy did
something he didn't expect to do.

25
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,260
He smiled back.

26
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:15,850
After a week of sly flirtations, Karen and
Roy did something no one expected them to do.

27
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:21,250
And they did it twice.

28
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:29,280
With each passing day, Karen began to
feel something she hadn't felt in years, 

29
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:34,240
and she realized she needed to know
if Roy was feeling the same way.

30
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,430
Has it been an hour yet?

31
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,690
14 minutes. Come on. Your doctor
said you need to walk an hour a day.

32
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,900
The little snot nose... I'd like
to drop dead just to piss him off.

33
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,490
Don't even joke about that.

34
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,690
I like having you around. I like it a lot.

35
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,250
You remember to put the seat down.

36
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:01,070
You can drive at night. A
girl could get used to that.

37
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,300
How many minutes has it been now?

38
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,020
I'm trying to tell you how I feel, Roy.

39
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:12,650
I didn't expect this. I always thought that...

40
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:18,200
You just get one big love in this
lifetime, and that was my husband Gilbert.

41
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:23,110
And after he died, I figured the rest of
my life was about making meatloaf for one.

42
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:28,890
Then you come along and... well... hell.

43
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:32,700
I love you, Roy.

44
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:39,030
Isn't there anything you wanna say to me?

45
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,140
You know how I feel.

46
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,060
A woman needs to hear the words.

47
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,080
All right. Here we go.

48
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,150
What the hell?

49
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,950
Oh, my God! Are you all right?

50
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,680
We gotta call 9-1-1!

51
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:06,290
For a moment, Mrs. Mccluskey didn't move.

52
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:11,980
And whether it was her boyfriend's discovery
of Julie Mayer or her realization that

53
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:16,720
he wasn't going to say the words
she desperately needed to hear, 

54
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,090
Karen McCluskey suddenly felt the urge to...

<i>******</i>

59
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:42,750
It was a shame what happened that day, 
considering how nicely the morning had begun.

60
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:49,280
One neighbor was out reading the sports
section, delighted to see that his team had won.

61
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:57,350
A child was playing with her new doll, 
thrilled to discover just how durable it was.

62
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:02,310
And a woman was walking
with the man she adored, 

63
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:06,690
determined to say she loved
him for the very first time.

64
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:15,540
Yes, up until the screaming started, people
thought it was going to be a wonderful day.

65
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,500
Oh, good. You're up.

66
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:45,430
- Uh, yeah. Good mornin'.
- Good morning.

67
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:52,200
Did you go to sleep with a
breath mint in your mouth?

68
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:56,640
This is our first morning waking
up as husband and wife again.

69
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,780
I wanted it to be perfect.

70
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,660
Well, it couldn't be more perfect.

71
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,110
Yes, it could.

72
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,620
Here's a breath mint for you.

73
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:16,570
Did we really get married last night?

74
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,760
Either that, or we paid a lot of
money to watch our friends get drunk.

75
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,170
- Come here, mrs. Delfino.
- All right.

76
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,130
We have a honeymoon to get started.

77
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,190
Hey, whatcha doin'?

78
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,500
Uh, nothing, sweetie.

79
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,940
Why don't you go play in
your room for ten minutes?

80
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,740
Ten?

81
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,820
I wanna play in here.

82
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,100
Okay. Of course you can.

83
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:49,770
In fact, I can't think of a better
way to start our new life together... 

84
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,320
all of us here, Julie's home.

85
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:57,980
You know, the last couple years, when I used
to think about what I needed to be happy, 

86
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:01,270
this was it.

87
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,830
This was the picture I had in my head.

88
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:13,750
Hey, Danny. It's Ana. Did you get my
message about going to the mall later?

89
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,540
Oh, okay. That's cool.
Um, how about tomorrow?

90
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,600
Yeah, me, too. The mall blows.

91
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:24,340
Well, give me a call if you wanna hang.

92
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,580
Shot you down, huh?

93
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,670
I could get Danny bolen anytime I want.

94
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:36,150
Okay. Well, let me know if you need any help.

95
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:41,960
Not that I need your help,
but... what do you got?

96
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,730
Here's the secret to landing
a guy... you have to ignore them.

97
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,530
You are the one who ends the conversation.

98
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,170
You are the one too busy to get together.

99
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:54,470
- And?
- And that's it.

100
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,480
Trust me, it works. How do
you think I played this one?

101
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:00,250
- You did not play me.
- Like a fiddle.

102
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:04,500
You know how many runway shows he sat
through before I would even look at him? Six.

103
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:07,200
- It wasn't that many.
- Six.

104
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,920
And when he finally asked
me out, I said, "okay."

105
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:14,570
but then at the last minute,I
backed out, saying I didn't feel well.

106
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,520
- You weren't really sick?
- God, no.

107
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,990
I had a pedicure and then
went to sardi's for drinks.

108
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:23,160
After that, he was my slave.

109
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:27,040
- I rented a yacht that day!
- Really? That's hilarious.

110
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,440
A week later, he gave me this.

111
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:32,010
I lost that deposit!

112
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,930
Eat your waffles! I'm teaching!

113
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:45,750
- Look at you.
- I know. Martha friggin' stewart, eh?

114
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:53,120
Hey, Ana. Yeah. I'm... I'm
not much of a-a mall guy.

115
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:56,710
Yeah. But, uh, I'll see you around, okay? Yep.

116
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,530
- Mornin'.
- Where were you last night?

117
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,490
- Out.
- Yeah, where "out"?

118
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,270
I drove around lookin' for you.

119
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,950
I couldn't sleep. I went a lot of places.

120
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:12,470
Happy now?

121
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,030
Don't be a wiseass. We were worried about you.

122
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,650
Nick, go take your shower. Go.

123
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:32,240
12 oranges for a half a cup
of juice? That's worth it.

124
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,290
No, thanks.

125
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,530
Okay, so we're sticking with
the moody teenager thing, huh?

126
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,630
Come on. What'd you do last night?

127
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,810
I already told dad. I went out.

128
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,000
Danny, it's me.

129
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:52,250
What did I do when peter spadaro pushed
you off the swing set in first grade, huh?

130
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,100
I threw a slushee in his mom's face.

131
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,580
Clearly, I have your back. Talk to me.

132
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,140
I went out drinking.

133
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:10,780
There's nothing else to do here, mom.

134
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:17,840
Look... I know this move has been hard on
you, but try to make the best of it, okay?

135
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,720
Trust me, it takes a lot
more effort to be unhappy.

136
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,680
Okay.

137
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:33,490
Thanks for being honest.
And that's for drinking.

138
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,420
Mom, was that you throwing up
in the bathroom this morning?

139
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,690
Yeah. I was just feeling a little nauseous.

140
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,050
Mm, sick in the morning.

141
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,940
If you weren't so old, I'd say you were pregnant.

142
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,380
Okay, guys, here's the deal.

143
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,850
I had some bad seafood last night.

144
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,120
At the wedding? We had chicken.

145
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:06,820
I mean after that. I went out
to get gas, and I had... Clams.

146
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,250
I don't even remember where I ate them.

147
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,230
I just remember seeing
this sign that said "clams, "

148
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,230
and I thought, "ooh, I haven't
had clams for a while."

149
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,620
so I went in and had clams, but they
were bad, which is why I was throwing up.

150
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,920
Well, my point was, next time, please flush.

151
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,290
And I'm done with my oatmeal.

152
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:46,000
What? We said we weren't gonna tell the
kids until after the first trimester.

153
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:48,560
That's next friday.

154
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:51,160
Wow, you actually know the day.

155
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:52,880
Wow, you're really into this.

156
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,250
Well, someone has to be.

157
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:57,710
I'm not telling anybody until we're
absolutely sure everything's okay.

158
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:01,130
Really? Are you sure that's the
only reason you're not telling them?

159
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:15,330
I can't open my eyes all the way. Who is it?

160
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,580
Did someone have too
much wine at the wedding?

161
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:22,250
I don't know. I was too drunk to notice.

162
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,480
I'm sorry to bother you.
I'm just looking for Bree.

163
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,910
Oh, she's not here.

164
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,290
- Where'd she go?
- I don't know.

165
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,540
I just woke up, and she was already gone.

166
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,760
- She's not in the test kitchen?
- No.

167
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:38,540
I just wanted to let her know
I'm taking the morning off.

168
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:43,390
Well, I'm sure she'll understand,
given all you've been through.

169
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,510
What do you mean?

170
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,650
Well, you know, Mike and
Susan getting married.

171
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,470
Oh, I'm not upset about that.

172
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:54,370
Really? Good. I'm glad.

173
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,010
I mean, it's not as if it's gonna last.

174
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:59,780
Excuse me?

175
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:03,100
Oh, Mike doesn't really love Susan.

176
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:06,820
He just feels sorry for her. He'll be back.

177
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:13,440
My thoughts exactly.

178
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,880
That... was amazing.

179
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:21,310
Yeah. Who knew you
were such a wild woman?

180
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,910
I'm not. I've never done this before.

181
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:27,700
- Well, you are a fast learner.
- No.

182
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:33,200
I mean, sex for me has always had to have an
emotional, romantic or even spiritual dimension.

183
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:36,700
I can see now you can take all
of that away and it's still...

184
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:39,350
Marvelous recreation.

185
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,510
The best there is.

186
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:43,210
- Except, of course, when you actually tried to...
- I'm sorry.

187
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,560
- I mean, really.
- Well, some people like it.

188
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,110
You've done this a lot, haven't you?

189
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,580
You don't stay this good by skipping practice.

190
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:54,490
God, you're a pig. Kiss me.

191
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,470
Hold that thought.

192
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:09,610
Well, that's weird. It's Mike. Hello?

193
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,200
Hey, Karl, listen.

194
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,180
There's no easy way to say this, 
but something's happened to Julie.

195
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,290
I mean, she was just lying there.

196
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,190
What if we hadn't found her in time?

197
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:35,440
Thank god you did.

198
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,400
How could this happen? I mean, Julie's,
like, the nicest girl in the world.

199
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:43,310
I know. Who'd want to hurt her?

200
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:07,770
Okay, I gotta go. We'll call you from
the hospital as soon as we hear anything.

201
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,680
Tell Susan and Mike we'll take good care of M.J.

202
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:15,550
This is insane. How could someone strangle Julie?

203
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,260
I know, and on our property. It could've been me.

204
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,870
I've never had much upper body strength.

205
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:28,570
I'd love to say he means well, but...

206
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,800
What are you looking at?

207
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,130
Well, this horrible thing happened.

208
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,230
We're all out here trying to make sense of it.

209
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,390
Where are they?

210
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:46,460
Oh, they were out here... for a minute.

211
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:51,750
You know, when you think about it, how
much do we even know about these people?

212
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:55,390
Not much. They're from New York. They have a son...

213
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:01,170
Danny, who I saw coming out of a
movie the other night with Julie.

214
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,960
Seriously? Like a date?

215
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,500
Sure looked that way.

216
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:10,080
You know, when women are attacked, the police
look at the husbands or the boyfriends first.

217
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,290
Maybe it's time that we get to know our new neighbors.

218
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:25,740
Okay, they are all looking at our place, and
I do not think they are admiring our azaleas.

219
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,370
Why are they staring at us?

220
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,430
Oh, let's see.

221
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,800
Uh, we're the new people on the block,
Mrs. Mccluskey saw you fightin' with Julie, 

222
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,500
and, uh, this morning,  she turns up almost dead.

223
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:38,290
What, are you kidding me? I had
nothing to do with that. I like Julie.

224
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,490
Then what were you fightin' about?

225
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,060
Nothin'. It's personal.

226
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,490
You're not gettin' how serious this is.

227
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:49,130
If that old lady talks to
the cops, we got problems.

228
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,460
Okay, okay.

229
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,570
Danny, just tell me where you went
when you were drinking last night.

230
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:57,730
I keep trying to remember.
I... I think I was at the park.

231
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,090
I drove by the park. You weren't there.

232
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,980
I drank a lot, okay? It's a little fuzzy.

233
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:07,060
That's great, Danny, you
know? That's really great.

234
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,720
All right, if anybody asks, let's
just say he was home with us.

235
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,690
No, because if anybody saw him out, we're done.

236
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,840
Maybe the old lady won't talk to the cops.

237
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:18,300
Uh, maybe I won't need an alibi.

238
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,250
Danny, people are already lookin' over here!

239
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,880
Maybe that is because we are hiding
in our house like guilty people.

240
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:31,060
Now I am going to make
Susan and Mike a manicott'.

241
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:35,120
And then we are going to get out
there and start hugging people.

242
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,190
The cops are going door-to-door asking questions.

243
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,300
Won't be long before they're here.

244
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,700
What am I gonna tell them, huh?

245
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:52,740
The truth... that you saw that
bolen kid fighting with Julie.

246
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,810
Well, it was just a couple of
words. They're kids. They argue.

247
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,900
If I start pointing fingers...

248
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,850
You're just telling 'em what you know.

249
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,220
What if I'm wrong?

250
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:04,790
I can't have another family
on this street hating me.

251
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,420
Who hates you?

252
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,480
Oh, the gay guys. I've said stuff.

253
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:13,060
Listen to me.

254
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,730
- You know you've gotta do the right thing.
- Yeah.

255
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:19,430
But you don't have to do it alone.

256
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,920
I'm gonna be right here with ya. And...

257
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:28,590
There was something I wanted to say
before, and I didn't get the chance.

258
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:36,100
If you got hit by a bus, I'd really miss you.

259
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,720
That's it?

260
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,550
Okay. You're showering alone tonight.

261
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:51,190
All right, I love you. There. I said it.

262
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:57,280
Do you mean it, or is that just
your beta-blockers talkin'?

263
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,200
We'll find out in an hour.

264
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,930
So you can't think of anyone who
would want to hurt your daughter?

265
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:07,730
No, I told you. She's a great
kid. Everybody loves her.

266
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,080
Where is that doctor?

267
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,310
He'll be here as soon as he can.

268
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,140
- Was she dating anyone?
- No.

269
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,930
- You sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

270
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,940
If she was dating somebody, I would know.

271
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,020
He said he would be here.

272
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:24,540
Mrs. Delfino, I know how difficult this is for you.

273
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,810
Really? Has your daughter been attacked?

274
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,650
Hey, um, you know what?

275
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:31,520
How about we do this after
she talks to the doctor?

276
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:34,320
Okay.

277
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,640
Susan! How is she?

278
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:43,040
We don't know yet. Uh, nobody's talking to us.

279
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:45,310
Do you need somebody to take care of M.J.?

280
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:47,390
Uh, bob and lee are watching him.

281
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:50,130
- Mrs. Delfino?
- Dr. Hill, what is going on?

282
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,220
She's still unconscious.

283
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:54,090
I'd like to run some tests to make
sure there's no internal bleeding.

284
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:56,810
- What kind of tests?
- Blood work, some x-rays.

285
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,350
- Um, can... can we go with you?
- Of course.

286
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:06,370
- Can I talk to you?
- Uh, we really need to move here.

287
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,160
I... I... I don't think you
should give her an X-ray.

288
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,630
Lynette, just let him do his job.

289
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,520
Julie's pregnant.

290
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:19,640
- What?
- She might be. She's not sure.

291
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:23,040
What are you talking about?

292
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,830
She told me.

293
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,250
It's no problem. I can give her an M.R.I.

294
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:33,360
There's no radiation, so it's safer for the baby.

295
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:49,560
Hey, guys. What's up?

296
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:55,030
Uh, we're just taking some
food over to Mike and Susan's.

297
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:57,910
You know, we feel so
awful about what happened.

298
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:58,590
Nick, you talk to the guys.

299
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,500
- I'm gonna get this over there while it's still hot, okay?
- Okay.

300
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:05,620
So, nick, after what happened to Julie, we're
thinking of starting up a neighborhood watch.

301
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,470
- Are you interested?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, of course.

302
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,410
Great.

303
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:14,490
Danny must be pretty shaken up. He's... he's
pretty close with Julie, isn't he?

304
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,630
I think we're all pretty shaken up.

305
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:22,170
- Weren't they, uh, dating, though?
- No, no, just friends.

306
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,970
Uh, she was helpin' him with some tutoring.

307
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,530
- Really?
- Yeah.

308
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:28,400
'Cause some people saw
them at the movies together.

309
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,760
Like I said, just friends.

310
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,560
So this neighborhood watch thing... 
is there, uh, gonna be a meeting?

311
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,880
Yeah, we'll let you know.

312
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,790
Is this... is this really about
the neighborhood watch?

313
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:51,220
'Cause it seems like the only
one you're watching is my kid.

314
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:56,480
Honey! It's your mother.

315
00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:01,000
We're done. Right, guys?

316
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:04,770
Thanks, hon.

317
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,270
That, uh, didn't look like it was going so good.

318
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,090
Yeah, they were asking about Danny.
It's like you said they would.

319
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:13,320
Then it is time to get our son an alibi.

320
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:21,310
Katherine.

321
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:23,230
I saw you drive in.

322
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:26,900
Uh, yeah, I just wanted to come home and take
a shower before I head back to the hospital.

323
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:32,240
Look, I know things have been... awkward lately.

324
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:36,360
But I heard about Julie, 
and I wanted to do something.

325
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:40,720
Thank you. I know Susan will appreciate it.

326
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:54,550
- So... How is Julie?
- Yeah, we don't know. They're still doing tests.

327
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,360
Oh, god. I can't imagine
what you're going through.

328
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:03,900
You have to stay strong, Mike.

329
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,580
Katherine?

330
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:16,030
Whoa, wait, wait. What are you doing?

331
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,130
Just letting you know I'm here for you.

332
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:28,050
Anytime.

333
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:33,550
Come on in.

334
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:38,100
Ana, there are two detectives here
who wanna ask you some questions.

335
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:41,580
- What about?
- We're investigating the Julie Mayer assault.

336
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:44,570
Where were you last night
at approximately 11:00?

337
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:46,760
Oh, I can answer that. She was in her room.

338
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:49,490
We have a very strict 10:00 p.m. curfew.

339
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,050
Actually, I was out.

340
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:54,990
What? I saw you go into your room.

341
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,280
Yeah, and then I climbed down
the trellis and I met a friend.

342
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:02,200
- Can I borrow your mace?
- Please, ma'am.

343
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:05,060
My tax dollars pay for
it. I should get to use it.

344
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,540
Who was the friend you met?

345
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:11,610
- Danny Bolen.
- Wait, Danny Bolen?

346
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:15,260
- As in the guy who blew you off this morning?
- Yes. He's a friend.

347
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:17,470
I want him to be more than a friend.

348
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,680
Mr. Bolen said that you
stopped by a liquor store.

349
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:23,170
No. No, no. She's 16. She doesn't drink.

350
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,710
Yeah, we bought some beer.

351
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,690
How about a taser? You
guys must carry a taser.

352
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:32,910
Can anybody verify your whereabouts?

353
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,810
Well... Danny.

354
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:41,630
Okay. Thanks for your time.

355
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:45,350
You know why kids are like this now?

356
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:47,920
Because you people won't
let us hit them anymore.

357
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:53,290
If I find this bastard before the cops do, 

358
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:56,830
he won't need a trial 'cause
I'll kill him with my bare hands.

359
00:23:57,130 --> 00:24:00,810
Look, I know you're mad. I don't
want to hear anger in this room.

360
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:04,260
We need to stay positive for Julie's sake.

361
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,850
Do we even have a clue who did this?

362
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,320
A jealous boyfriend, maybe?

363
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:11,520
Was she even seeing anyone?

364
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:13,980
No, not that I know of.

365
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,520
- Is this a bad time?
- No, no. Come on in.

366
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:20,040
Oh, how is she?

367
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,940
Still unconscious. We're
waiting for the test results.

368
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,780
- Karl.
- Bree.

369
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:34,500
You know, I need to talk to
Lynette. I'll be back in ten minutes.

370
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:41,160
She must never ever know I slept with you.

371
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:44,310
Bree, my daughter was attacked.

372
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,400
I've got more to worry about
than Susan getting mad at us.

373
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:49,540
Of course. I'm sorry.

374
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,030
Look, I know we said we'd
get together this week, 

375
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:59,230
but till this all gets sorted
out, I... I need a little time.

376
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,150
I completely understand.

377
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:11,480
I do want to see you again. Really.

378
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:16,230
- Just not now.
- Okay.

379
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,910
Dad?

380
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:35,680
So what did they say?

381
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:39,500
The doctors still don't
know. But she's not pregnant.

382
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:43,500
I'm so sorry about that. I
just had to say something.

383
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:48,840
What made you think that she might be?

384
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,740
She told me.

385
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:55,520
A few days ago, I was out in my yard.

386
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,040
I was upset.

387
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:00,120
Julie saw me and asked me what was wrong.

388
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:02,820
We started talking about stuff, and...

389
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:05,130
It just came out.

390
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,030
Th... and you didn't just...

391
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:09,930
just immediately pick up the phone and call me?

392
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:13,030
She asked me not to.

393
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:21,710
So who's the guy?

394
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:24,740
- I don't know.
- She didn't say?

395
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:29,170
All she said was she'd gotten involved
with someone and that it was complicated.

396
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:32,760
Complicated? And that's the word she used?

397
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,830
Yeah.

398
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:41,000
Because..."complicated" means "trouble, "

399
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:46,950
so you knew that she was in trouble, 
and you chose not to come to me?

400
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,530
Like I said, Julie asked me not to.

401
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,670
You are my friend, not hers.

402
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,850
After everything we've been through, I
cannot believe you would betray me like that.

403
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,450
Whoa, that's not fair.

404
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,220
Lynette, my daughter is hooked up to a machine, 

405
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:02,980
and a guy who is complicating her life... 

406
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:07,980
a guy that I didn't even know about... might've
put her there, so I don't need to be fair.

407
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,530
Hey, reggie. Thanks for coming so quickly.

408
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:20,480
No problem, Mrs. Solis.

409
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,790
How are those two little precious ones?

410
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,670
What?

411
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:29,550
Oh, my kids. Oh, you threw me off with "precious."

412
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,650
they're the least of my problems.
We've taken in a teenager.

413
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:34,780
Sorry to hear it.

414
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:38,470
Yeah, she's been using this to sneak out at
night. That's why I want you to take it down.

415
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:40,610
She climbed down this trellis?

416
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:42,720
Yeah, that's what she said.

417
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:45,610
Okay. It's just that it's pretty beat up.

418
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:48,490
I wouldn't have thought it could
hold much more than those roses.

419
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,910
But then again, why would
she lie? I'll get my tools.

420
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:19,580
I'm telling you, she opened her
eyes for at least 10 or 15 seconds.

421
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:21,800
- She called me "dad."
- I believe you.

422
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:22,840
Well, what does it mean?

423
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:27,050
Well, in layman's terms, drifting in and out
of consciousness is better than fully comatose.

424
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,450
Our main concern is the intracranial swelling.

425
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:32,400
In fact, if she wakes up, we
may choose to induce coma.

426
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,290
Well, why would you do that?

427
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,420
The swelling will heal faster if she's unconscious.

428
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:38,630
But I'm confident she'll recover.

429
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:42,830
Thank god. I should find Susan.

430
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,780
Good lord. They need me in the E.R.

431
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,750
Um, before you go, one quick question.

432
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:52,870
When Julie wakes up, will she remember what she
saw or heard during the brief moment she was awake?

433
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,560
- I don't see why not.
- But people in comas dream, don't they?

434
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:59,920
She could wake up thinking she saw something
odd when really it was just a bizarre dream.

435
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:00,880
Not very likely.

436
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:04,320
Her brain is swollen. That
has to cause hallucinations.

437
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:08,530
I once thought lauren bacall was in my
bedroom, and that was just a high fever.

438
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:14,570
Ma'am, there's been a bus crash. I need to go.

439
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,140
Oh, I'm sorry.

440
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:19,730
Uh, talk to your friend. You may
be surprised what she remembers.

441
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,430
- Liar!
- What?

442
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,950
There is no way you crawled down that trellis, 

443
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,970
because I just tried to, and
it collapsed on top of me.

444
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:39,700
- What's your answer to that?
- I don't know.

445
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:42,730
Pull back on the carbs
and try again in two weeks?

446
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:47,210
Wh... Ana, this is serious.

447
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,660
Why would you lie to the cops?

448
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:51,030
Did Danny ask you to cover up for him?

449
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:54,870
I'm not covering up anything. Danny didn't do it.

450
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,360
Well, the police think he
did. You don't know this kid.

451
00:29:57,370 --> 00:30:00,060
I know him better than the cops.

452
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:03,780
You're just mad because
I didn't take your advice.

453
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:05,170
What are you talking about?

454
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:09,320
You told me to play hard to
get, which is totally lame.

455
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:12,730
I figured out a way to make him owe me.

456
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,260
Aiding and abetting?

457
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,990
This is your solution on how to land a guy?

458
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,120
Who are you calling?

459
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:22,670
- The police.
- No!

460
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:26,470
Julie Mayer is lying in a hospital bed right
now, and Danny might have put her there.

461
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,230
You're telling the truth.

462
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,600
Bree, you're back.

463
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:38,540
I brought you your favorite biscotti.

464
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:39,790
Aw, you are so sweet.

465
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:41,200
And I hear Julie's doing better.

466
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:44,000
Much better. She's just sedated now.

467
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:45,650
The doctors are very optimistic.

468
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:48,060
Oh, my, that is good news.

469
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:53,930
You know, I wanted to tell you again
how much I enjoyed your wedding, 

470
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:56,960
especially the part where
you and Katherine made peace.

471
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:59,100
Well, I'm glad someone enjoyed that.

472
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,920
But you are friends again, right?

473
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:03,410
I mean, you said all those lovely
things to her in the church.

474
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:05,600
Yeah, but it wasn't enough for Katherine.

475
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:08,720
You know, I don't know where she
gets off being the injured party.

476
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:11,490
She took Mike from me first.

477
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,670
But you and Mike were divorced at the time.

478
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:16,860
And... and Katherine was very lonely.

479
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:22,040
Okay, rule number one of the female code...
never sleep with your friend's ex-husband.

480
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:27,320
Well, uh, perhaps she should've seen
that you still had feelings for Mike.

481
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:29,120
It would've been different if she'd slept with...

482
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:32,900
Oh, let's say for instance, Karl.

483
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:36,340
Karl? Oh, yeah, like that would ever happen.

484
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,870
No, Katherine's a lady.

485
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,550
She's not one of those dumb skanks
that would fall for Karl's come-ons.

486
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,970
So you agree it would be different?

487
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:50,010
Much different. Worse.

488
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,730
Worse? Why worse?

489
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:57,340
Because Karl hurt me. He cheated and lied.

490
00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:01,120
I mean, any friend who would know
all that and sleep with him anyway?

491
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,000
I would never talk to her again.

492
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:08,620
I don't blame you for
defending Katherine. But...

493
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:15,300
I just don't need a friend like her in my
life, especially when I have a friend like you.

494
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,970
Orson. Come in.

495
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,990
Uh, I'm getting everybody
to sign a get well card.

496
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,020
- We're sending it over to Julie.
- Oh, that's nice.

497
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:34,920
I suppose I should sign it somewhere
inconspicuous, given recent events.

498
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,640
I suppose.

499
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:44,720
By the way, this morning when I said
that Mike and Susan wouldn't last?

500
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:49,010
I know you thought I was crazy.

501
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:53,370
No. I didn't think that... exactly.

502
00:32:54,670 --> 00:33:01,230
Well, F.Y.I., I stopped by their
house today with a casserole.

503
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:05,110
Mike was there... Alone.

504
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:11,030
Let's just say he was grateful. Very grateful.

505
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,470
Why wouldn't he be?

506
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:18,330
God, you have no ear for innuendo at all!

507
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:20,340
He made a pass at me.

508
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:24,660
With Julie in the hospital
and his marriage one day old?

509
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:29,610
Well... It may be the first day, but.

510
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:33,600
He's clearing having second thoughts.

511
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:40,700
Oh, and. Please don't tell Bree.

512
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:43,790
I'd hate for this to get back to Susan.

513
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:58,650
I hear Julie opened her eyes. That's great.

514
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,820
Yes. Yes, it is.

515
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:04,300
I'm sorry you're mad at me.

516
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,910
Yeah, I'm not mad.

517
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:15,880
I just can't understand why
she went to you instead of me.

518
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,660
That day that Julie found me crying?

519
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:29,770
The reason she opened up to me
was because I told her that... 

520
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:34,590
and no one else can know
about this... I'm pregnant.

521
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,630
You are?

522
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,740
That's amazing.

523
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:45,790
Wait. Why were you crying?

524
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:52,900
Let's see. Uh, I'm in my 40s,
my husband is back in school, 

525
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,970
I'm the sole breadwinner, 

526
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:02,510
I don't know how I'm gonna do
this whole baby thing again, 

527
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:06,700
and... also because...

528
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:11,740
What?

529
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:20,700
Because I can't quiet that one
voice in my mind that keeps saying...

530
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,230
Maybe I shouldn't.

531
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,320
Oh, honey.

532
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,990
Yeah.

533
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:47,950
Lynette, uh...

534
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:52,950
You can do whatever you
think it is you need to do.

535
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:58,600
Yeah. I know. Lucky me.

536
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:04,770
It's weird. Everybody talks
about a kid being a gift.

537
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,840
It's the only gift where you puke for nine months

538
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:10,770
before you receive it and
then scream the day it arrives.

539
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,980
That's true.

540
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:16,470
But they are a gift, Lynette.

541
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:23,710
I know that because...

542
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,250
I spent the last few hours thinking that I was...

543
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:31,490
Gonna lose mine.

544
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,090
I realized that I would...

545
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:39,480
Trade everything I own, I would
give everything I ever will have, 

546
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:45,420
for just one more day as Julie's mom.

547
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:53,870
But I'm not telling you what you should do.

548
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,350
Actually, you are.

549
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:05,570
And I'm glad you did.

550
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,540
I had some briefs to finish, but i'd
rather work here than at the office.

551
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:23,920
Hey, Bree. You're still here?

552
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:25,760
Oh, she's kept me company all day.

553
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,090
Is she a saint or what?

554
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,000
Hey, Lee. Thanks for calling me back.

555
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:32,660
Uh, I'm just checking on M.J.

556
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:41,160
This has been the longest day of my life.

557
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:48,300
I thought I needed some time to myself.

558
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,810
I was wrong.

559
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:57,350
I... I need you.

560
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:07,030
I booked our room at the
motel. Here's the key.

561
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:13,750
If you could come by, even for just an hour...

562
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:18,280
Well, it would mean a lot to me.

563
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,870
Please.

564
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,640
I... I don't want to be alone tonight.

565
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:44,200
Neither do I.

566
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:53,270
- Hey, Gaby.
- Hey, you got a minute?

567
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,440
Oh, I think I know why you're here, and
believe me, I am as ticked off as you are.

568
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:57,560
- Angie... 
- No, no, no, no.

569
00:38:57,570 --> 00:38:59,850
Danny should've never kept your niece out so late.

570
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:03,600
When I found out, I kicked him so hard, he's
still trying to get the shoe out of his butt.

571
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:05,560
It'll never happen again.

572
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:08,500
- It never happened at all.
- What?

573
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:11,420
Ana wasn't with Danny last
night. She never left the house.

574
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,140
What are you talking about?

575
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:15,810
She snuck out. Danny bought
her beer. They both fessed up.

576
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,910
Ana was lying.

577
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,260
Well, why would she lie?

578
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,510
Because your son told her to.

579
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,640
Well, maybe she was changing her tune 'cause
she didn't want to get in trouble with you.

580
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:30,550
No. No! She's covering for Danny.

581
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:33,400
I don't know what you're
implying, but he's a good kid.

582
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:36,010
Your niece is the one that's
been hounding him day and night.

583
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:38,050
Hey, I'm just trying to be nice here.

584
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:41,200
I'm giving you a heads up that
Ana's taking her story back.

585
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,010
Let's slow down here, okay?

586
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,720
Can I at least talk to the girl
before she goes pointin' fingers?

587
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:51,120
Too late. She's talking to the police right now.

588
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:09,180
Baby, I screwed up.

589
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,930
What happened?

590
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:14,090
I never should've told you
to ask that girl for an alibi.

591
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:15,080
Did she talk to the cops?

592
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,130
Yeah, which means they
should be here any second.

593
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,130
But I didn't do anything. I... 

594
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,670
We don't have time for that. You're a suspect.

595
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,340
They have the right to question you.

596
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:24,120
- Ma...
- Just listen to me.

597
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,930
Tell 'em you will not waive your Miranda rights.

598
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:28,300
And we will have a lawyer
down there as soon as we can.

599
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:30,900
Remember, how does a fish get caught?

600
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:34,140
He opens his mouth.

601
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,540
It had been a horrible day, 

602
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:47,430
and people in the neighborhood
were doing their best to recover.

603
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:52,110
One mother was about to share
some good news with her family

604
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:56,390
when her son saw a flashing light in the window.

605
00:40:57,570 --> 00:41:00,680
Another was busy grounding her niece

606
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:05,290
when she noticed the police car
pulling up across the street.

607
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:10,940
a woman was planning a
rendezvous with her lover

608
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:16,230
when she saw a young man
being taken out of his house.

609
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:25,080
Within moments, everyone had heard

610
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:32,150
the son of one housewife was suspected
of strangling the daughter of another.

611
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,310
Yes, it had been a horrible day.

612
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:51,070
And the thought occurred to one old woman... 

613
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:55,430
the days ahead could be worse.

614
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:59,730
