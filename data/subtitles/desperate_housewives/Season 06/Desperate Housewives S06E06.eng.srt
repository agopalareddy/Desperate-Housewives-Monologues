1
00:00:00,264 --> 00:00:02,168
Previously on "Desperate Housewives"

2
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:03,493
I think you're a lousy mother.

3
00:00:03,493 --> 00:00:04,907
Gaby was insulted.

4
00:00:04,907 --> 00:00:05,921
Did you just say that to my face?

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,882
I closed the door to ask

6
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,187
if you would like to
be my new senior V.P.

7
00:00:09,187 --> 00:00:12,267
Lynette choose not to
mention her pregnancy

8
00:00:12,267 --> 00:00:14,182
You get to stay in school.

9
00:00:14,182 --> 00:00:16,399
Susan tried to protect Julie.

10
00:00:16,652 --> 00:00:17,617
You shot me!

11
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:19,385
That gun is under our real name.

12
00:00:19,385 --> 00:00:20,679
- I wanna call the police.
- Uh, just...

13
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:23,240
And Angie had to protect her secret.

14
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,852
- High road all the way.
- That's a good point.

15
00:00:32,701 --> 00:00:35,203
Bree Hodge had a problem.

16
00:00:35,204 --> 00:00:39,493
She did not want to fall
in love with Karl Mayer.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,953
She was appalled by his table manners...

18
00:00:45,852 --> 00:00:46,930
What?

19
00:00:47,808 --> 00:00:49,709
His personal ethics...

20
00:00:51,321 --> 00:00:52,379
What?

21
00:00:53,147 --> 00:00:55,315
And his wandering eye.

22
00:00:57,518 --> 00:00:58,394
What?

23
00:00:58,819 --> 00:01:02,867
No, Bree did not want
to fall for Karl Mayer,

24
00:01:02,867 --> 00:01:05,166
and yet she knew in her heart

25
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:07,247
that she was starting to.

26
00:01:08,195 --> 00:01:10,558
And that's why she also knew

27
00:01:10,558 --> 00:01:11,762
the time had come...

28
00:01:11,762 --> 00:01:13,101
We have to talk.

29
00:01:13,101 --> 00:01:15,235
to leave.

30
00:01:15,422 --> 00:01:18,293
Hey, what's with the
face? You dumping me?

31
00:01:20,351 --> 00:01:21,620
Karl...

32
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:25,083
Oh, my god. You are dumping me.

33
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:26,689
We've both known this
couldn't last forever,

34
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:29,824
so let's end it now
before someone gets hurt.

35
00:01:30,956 --> 00:01:32,318
But it's going so well.

36
00:01:32,318 --> 00:01:35,235
- I feel we're getting closer.
- We are.

37
00:01:35,589 --> 00:01:37,171
That's the problem.

38
00:01:39,029 --> 00:01:40,275
When I agreed to be your lover,

39
00:01:40,275 --> 00:01:43,545
I felt quite sure that my
disdain for your vulgarity

40
00:01:43,545 --> 00:01:45,684
and astounding lack of
scruples would preclude

41
00:01:45,684 --> 00:01:47,733
any chance of my
developing feelings for you.

42
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:52,045
But against all reason, It's happening.

43
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:54,164
I don't want to fall in love with a man

44
00:01:54,164 --> 00:01:56,301
I'm not even sure I like.

45
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:59,840
I'm glad we're being careful
about no one getting hurt.

46
00:02:00,235 --> 00:02:04,261
Please, let's not make this
any harder than it has to be.

47
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:09,891
Okay. You say we're done, we're done.

48
00:02:09,891 --> 00:02:12,042
I was gonna wait to give you this later,

49
00:02:12,042 --> 00:02:13,546
maybe over dinner or something.

50
00:02:15,063 --> 00:02:17,488
I guess now it's sort of a parting gift.

51
00:02:18,049 --> 00:02:20,429
- I couldn't.
- Open it.

52
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,083
It's beautiful!

53
00:02:29,027 --> 00:02:30,924
Oh, and it's inscribed.

54
00:02:30,924 --> 00:02:35,689
"To my dear and beloved... Irene"?

55
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:37,081
Irene was my grandmother.

56
00:02:37,081 --> 00:02:38,433
My grandpa gave it to her on their

57
00:02:38,433 --> 00:02:39,785
first wedding anniversary.

58
00:02:41,062 --> 00:02:43,966
Well, she had no granddaughters
so she willed it to me.

59
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:46,272
She said, "someday you'll find

60
00:02:46,272 --> 00:02:49,400
the perfect woman to give
this to," and she was right.

61
00:02:50,841 --> 00:02:52,469
I know how you feel.

62
00:02:52,469 --> 00:02:55,375
I'm... I didn't plan on
falling for you, either.

63
00:02:56,403 --> 00:02:57,188
And I don't blame you

64
00:02:57,188 --> 00:02:59,114
for wanting to run the other way.

65
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,970
And for what it's worth...

66
00:03:04,037 --> 00:03:05,481
I love you.

67
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:09,730
And in that moment,

68
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,983
Bree knew that the time to
leave her lover had come...

69
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:16,484
and gone.

70
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:31,393
Ann Peterson

71
00:03:31,393 --> 00:03:35,043
was the principal of
Fairview Elementary School,

72
00:03:35,043 --> 00:03:37,656
And she believed in rules.

73
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:40,685
She used them to teach hygiene,

74
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:45,056
to control behavior

75
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:48,866
And to instill order.

76
00:03:50,162 --> 00:03:54,594
Yes, Mrs. Peterson believed in rules.

77
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,932
She also believed

78
00:03:57,624 --> 00:04:02,208
That those who didn't follow
them should be punished.

79
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:11,616
Okay, the camera is rolling.

80
00:04:11,617 --> 00:04:12,787
Are there any words you'd like to say

81
00:04:12,787 --> 00:04:15,754
before your daughter
makes her stage debut?

82
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,124
Let us pray.

83
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:19,101
Gaby, Juanita is going to see this.

84
00:04:19,101 --> 00:04:21,480
Oh, trust me this is not
the footage you wanna keep.

85
00:04:22,121 --> 00:04:25,037
Well, I'm sorry. I
tried to work with her.

86
00:04:25,037 --> 00:04:27,752
But you may as well know
your daughter is talent-free.

87
00:04:27,752 --> 00:04:30,442
She is only 7. How bad could she be?

88
00:04:30,442 --> 00:04:31,893
Well, I've already
looked through the program

89
00:04:31,893 --> 00:04:34,087
to pick out a kid we
can pretend is ours.

90
00:04:34,087 --> 00:04:37,400
I like Paige Glover.
I'm gonna be her mommy.

91
00:04:45,247 --> 00:04:47,263
My name is Miles Standish.

92
00:04:47,263 --> 00:04:50,229
We have come to share
with you our bounty.

93
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:55,827
And to give thanks for this new lands,

94
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:59,243
where we are free from
religious perskacootion.

95
00:05:04,403 --> 00:05:07,172
- Which one is Paige Glover?
- shh, shh.

96
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:09,746
Religious perspacotion.

97
00:05:12,067 --> 00:05:16,481
- Where we are free from religious...
- Persecution!

98
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,583
Read the corn! I wrote it on the corn!

99
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,055
Per... perska... prossa... aw...

100
00:05:24,056 --> 00:05:25,018
at that moment,

101
00:05:25,018 --> 00:05:29,828
Juanita Solis chose to utter
a certain 4-letter word...

102
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:34,051
for the very first time.

103
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,966
I did not write that on the corn.

104
00:05:41,127 --> 00:05:41,916
Just promise me

105
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:44,363
you won't have a few drinks
and get all kissy with me

106
00:05:44,363 --> 00:05:46,159
like you did last week at the Bermans'.

107
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:47,981
You told me you don't
want our friends to know

108
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:49,286
we're having marital problems.

109
00:05:49,286 --> 00:05:51,186
Well, you don't have to
maul me to prove we're okay.

110
00:05:51,186 --> 00:05:54,093
- I don't like public displays of affection.
- I know.

111
00:05:54,093 --> 00:05:56,639
But these days, they're the
only kind I can get from you.

112
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:00,877
Sorry we're late, Mike.

113
00:06:00,877 --> 00:06:02,448
oh, that's okay, come on in.

114
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:05,320
Oh, my god. I can't believe it.

115
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,147
It's just a pie, Susan.
I've brought them before.

116
00:06:08,147 --> 00:06:09,484
No, the brooch that you're wearing.

117
00:06:09,484 --> 00:06:11,427
It's... it's mine.

118
00:06:11,427 --> 00:06:13,274
Excuse me?

119
00:06:13,274 --> 00:06:15,121
Karl gave it to me
years ago. Can I see it?

120
00:06:15,121 --> 00:06:17,182
Well, I don't doubt
that it's similar, Susan,

121
00:06:17,182 --> 00:06:19,592
but it can't possibly be the same one.

122
00:06:19,592 --> 00:06:22,646
No, yes! There's the inscription.

123
00:06:22,646 --> 00:06:25,761
To his granny Irene! Mike!

124
00:06:28,441 --> 00:06:31,376
This is the same brooch
I lost ten years ago.

125
00:06:31,377 --> 00:06:33,912
You say you lost it?

126
00:06:33,913 --> 00:06:36,314
Yeah. It was back when
Karl and I got divorced.

127
00:06:36,315 --> 00:06:39,676
One day it was on my
coat, and the next... gone.

128
00:06:39,676 --> 00:06:41,343
I never knew where it went.

129
00:06:42,794 --> 00:06:45,043
- Hi, everybody.
- Well, now we know.

130
00:06:45,043 --> 00:06:47,116
Great to see you. See you, sweetheart.

131
00:06:47,116 --> 00:06:49,314
Hey, Karl, get in here. Wait.

132
00:06:49,314 --> 00:06:51,265
You are not gonna believe this.

133
00:06:51,265 --> 00:06:54,336
Bree found your grandmother's brooch.

134
00:06:55,286 --> 00:06:59,333
- What?
- Yes, the one that Susan lost.

135
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:02,574
What an extraordinary coincidence.

136
00:07:02,575 --> 00:07:04,156
Where did you get it, Bree?

137
00:07:05,832 --> 00:07:07,654
She bought it. I'm assuming.

138
00:07:07,655 --> 00:07:10,470
Uh, yes, at that little antique store

139
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,710
- down on Pearl Street.
- Yeah, so obviously,

140
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,780
whoever found it must've
sold it to that store.

141
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,069
Remember how mad you got when I lost it?

142
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:19,915
- He really yelled at me.
- You yelled at her?

143
00:07:19,915 --> 00:07:23,161
- I don't recall yelling.
- You kinda did.

144
00:07:23,162 --> 00:07:25,797
"How could you lose my
grandmother's brooch?!

145
00:07:25,798 --> 00:07:28,904
- It was a family heirloom!"
- Unbelievable.

146
00:07:28,904 --> 00:07:31,736
Yeah, that it would turn up
again after all this time.

147
00:07:35,269 --> 00:07:38,832
Well, I'm glad I can give it
back to its rightful owner.

148
00:07:38,832 --> 00:07:40,779
Oh, it's yours. You bought it.

149
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,781
Oh, I couldn't possibly wear it

150
00:07:42,782 --> 00:07:44,816
knowing that Karl gave it to you.

151
00:07:44,816 --> 00:07:47,956
Well, how much did it
cost? I'll reimburse you.

152
00:07:48,744 --> 00:07:52,924
No need, dear. Trust me, it was a steal.

153
00:07:57,195 --> 00:07:58,417
Whoa! We gotta get him inside.

154
00:07:58,417 --> 00:08:01,250
- Shh. Shh. Just hold on. Just...
- Okay. Easy does it.

155
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,933
How can we get some pancakes?

156
00:08:04,369 --> 00:08:05,322
- What? Oh, gee.
- Watch it. Watch it.

157
00:08:05,322 --> 00:08:08,072
- I'm good, I'm good.
- Shh.

158
00:08:08,072 --> 00:08:09,731
Porter,  for god sakes!

159
00:08:09,731 --> 00:08:12,174
People are trying to sleep!

160
00:08:14,246 --> 00:08:16,585
- Tom?
- Hey, honey.

161
00:08:16,585 --> 00:08:17,573
What are you doing here?

162
00:08:17,573 --> 00:08:20,120
I thought you were gonna
be at the library studying.

163
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,759
W... w... we were,
and after we were done,

164
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,987
I told the guys I'd
treat 'em to pancakes.

165
00:08:23,987 --> 00:08:25,470
But the... the place was closed.

166
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:27,320
Ah, so we peed on the building.

167
00:08:28,938 --> 00:08:31,041
Give it five, T-scav! Yo!

168
00:08:32,239 --> 00:08:33,898
You're drunk.

169
00:08:34,738 --> 00:08:36,207
Uh, I beg your pardon.

170
00:08:36,207 --> 00:08:38,624
He's drunk. I'm faced.

171
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,147
Do you have a sink?

172
00:08:48,093 --> 00:08:51,258
What did this library
have, a 3-drink minimum?

173
00:08:51,258 --> 00:08:54,155
Well, after the library,
we went to a bar,

174
00:08:54,155 --> 00:08:58,027
and they got into a
cutthroat game of beer pong.

175
00:09:00,086 --> 00:09:02,217
Well, I'll just make 'em some pancakes

176
00:09:02,217 --> 00:09:05,090
- and take 'em home in the morning.
- The morning?!

177
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:08,140
Can I talk to you a second, T-scav,

178
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,208
away from these beer pong champs?

179
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:12,649
Actually, they lost and... and
it was kind of controversial...

180
00:09:12,649 --> 00:09:14,885
I don't care! they're
not staying here tonight.

181
00:09:14,885 --> 00:09:15,944
Come on! Look at Niedermeyer.

182
00:09:15,944 --> 00:09:17,699
I can't take him home
to his mom and dad.

183
00:09:17,699 --> 00:09:18,692
You know how parents are.

184
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:21,420
Of course I do! we're parents!

185
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,963
Look...

186
00:09:28,617 --> 00:09:30,141
I understand you want
the kids to like you

187
00:09:30,141 --> 00:09:33,131
so they can elect you
Homecoming king or whatever,

188
00:09:33,131 --> 00:09:35,078
but you are not going back to school

189
00:09:35,078 --> 00:09:38,021
to have some second
childhood. Enough is enough!

190
00:09:38,021 --> 00:09:39,510
Okay. okay, I hear ya.

191
00:09:40,829 --> 00:09:44,722
Hey, I hear you, too.
Wanna keep it down?

192
00:09:55,026 --> 00:09:56,139
And as punishment,

193
00:09:56,139 --> 00:09:58,518
I'm having Juanita
draft a letter of apology

194
00:09:58,518 --> 00:10:00,951
to every classmate and
family member who heard...

195
00:10:02,149 --> 00:10:03,730
the verb in question.

196
00:10:03,735 --> 00:10:04,947
That seems fair.

197
00:10:04,947 --> 00:10:07,342
And of course, she won't
be allowed to participate

198
00:10:07,342 --> 00:10:10,445
in the final two performances
of the Thanksgiving pageant.

199
00:10:10,445 --> 00:10:11,267
Of course.

200
00:10:11,267 --> 00:10:14,482
And she is also on
cafeteria cleaning detail

201
00:10:14,482 --> 00:10:17,636
- for the next two weeks.
-Absolutely.

202
00:10:17,636 --> 00:10:19,457
Uh, not so fast.

203
00:10:19,457 --> 00:10:21,843
- I'm sorry?
- Oh, come on, Mrs. Peterson.

204
00:10:21,843 --> 00:10:23,762
A letter of apology? Fine.

205
00:10:23,762 --> 00:10:25,076
Taking her out of the play?

206
00:10:25,076 --> 00:10:27,536
Hey, she deserved that based
on her performance alone.

207
00:10:27,536 --> 00:10:29,269
But let's not go overboard.

208
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:33,262
Mrs. Solis, this school
has a zero tolerance policy

209
00:10:33,262 --> 00:10:34,847
when it comes to profanity.

210
00:10:34,847 --> 00:10:38,433
And we respect that. Right, honey?

211
00:10:38,433 --> 00:10:40,182
Stay out of this, sweetheart.

212
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:42,521
You need to take a second
look at that policy.

213
00:10:42,521 --> 00:10:44,868
Juanita made a little
slip. It wasn't intentional.

214
00:10:44,868 --> 00:10:47,224
It's not like she flipped
the bird afterwards.

215
00:10:47,636 --> 00:10:49,146
My ruling stands.

216
00:10:49,147 --> 00:10:52,316
If you can't do the
time, don't do the crime.

217
00:10:52,317 --> 00:10:54,885
What is this, Shawshank Elementary?

218
00:10:54,886 --> 00:10:56,820
This school is not at fault.

219
00:10:56,821 --> 00:10:58,530
If you want to assign blame,

220
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:01,491
you might look to your
dubious parenting skills.

221
00:11:04,128 --> 00:11:07,562
- Oh, I wish you hadn't said that.
- Excuse me?

222
00:11:07,562 --> 00:11:10,334
Well, Juanita learned
that word somewhere.

223
00:11:10,335 --> 00:11:12,168
And you're saying I taught it to her?

224
00:11:12,168 --> 00:11:16,373
No, I'm sure it was
whispered to her by the wind.

225
00:11:17,104 --> 00:11:19,810
Let me tell you
something, Mrs. Peterson.

226
00:11:19,811 --> 00:11:21,150
I am pulling Juanita

227
00:11:21,151 --> 00:11:23,447
out of this crappy, crappy school!

228
00:11:23,448 --> 00:11:26,316
Come on, Carlos! Oh.

229
00:11:26,317 --> 00:11:27,584
"Crappy," huh?

230
00:11:27,585 --> 00:11:29,560
What a shame Juanita won't be here

231
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,122
to blurt that out during
the pledge of allegiance.

232
00:11:32,123 --> 00:11:35,325
Oh, yeah? well, here's a blurt for ya...

233
00:11:37,336 --> 00:11:39,386
...And the horse you rode in on!

234
00:11:48,585 --> 00:11:50,253
Don't shoot! it's just me.

235
00:11:51,889 --> 00:11:54,223
Relax, Susan. It was a joke.

236
00:11:54,224 --> 00:11:55,231
Is Mike here?

237
00:11:55,864 --> 00:11:59,397
- He is out on a job.
- Oh, darn it.

238
00:11:59,397 --> 00:12:02,815
I wanted to talk to both
of you so I could apologize.

239
00:12:04,472 --> 00:12:06,524
Over the past few weeks...

240
00:12:06,524 --> 00:12:10,339
I've let my emotions get the best of me.

241
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,998
I'm sure you've noticed

242
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:15,511
that my behavior has been... crazy.

243
00:12:15,512 --> 00:12:17,845
Hmm, just in the... clinical sense.

244
00:12:17,845 --> 00:12:20,311
Well, that's over.

245
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,283
I don't want there to be
any more tension between us.

246
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,952
When we see each other on the street,

247
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,888
I want us to wave,

248
00:12:27,889 --> 00:12:29,956
not dive behind a garbage can.

249
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:33,433
Oh, I didn't dive. I...
just dropped my keys.

250
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:37,197
I just want things to be normal again.

251
00:12:37,198 --> 00:12:39,733
Let me play poker
with you and the girls.

252
00:12:39,734 --> 00:12:42,135
If you throw a party, invite me.

253
00:12:42,657 --> 00:12:44,250
Maybe you and Mike can have me

254
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,727
over for a barbecue sometime.

255
00:12:47,985 --> 00:12:50,177
Given what's happened,

256
00:12:50,178 --> 00:12:53,613
I just don't see a
barbecue in our future.

257
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:00,287
Fine, Susan.

258
00:13:00,288 --> 00:13:02,432
I was just hoping to be friends again

259
00:13:02,432 --> 00:13:06,259
and show all those people
how wrong they were.

260
00:13:07,795 --> 00:13:09,963
What people?

261
00:13:09,964 --> 00:13:11,955
The ones who keep telling me that

262
00:13:11,955 --> 00:13:13,567
I should sue you for, uh...

263
00:13:13,568 --> 00:13:16,436
What did they call it?
"Reckless endangerment"?

264
00:13:16,437 --> 00:13:18,586
Yeah, I'm sorry. Who
are all these people?

265
00:13:18,586 --> 00:13:20,407
Neighbors, well-wishers,

266
00:13:20,408 --> 00:13:23,426
a couple of lawyers who
dabble in civil lawsuits.

267
00:13:23,426 --> 00:13:27,347
But I told them, "no, I
could never sue Susan."

268
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:30,283
In spite of everything,
we're still friends.

269
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,759
But... if that isn't true anymore...

270
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,976
Brunch! Uh...

271
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:40,627
Mike and I aren't
really barbecue people.

272
00:13:40,628 --> 00:13:43,243
We like a good brunch.

273
00:13:43,243 --> 00:13:45,265
So... let's give that a shot.

274
00:13:45,266 --> 00:13:48,869
Um, I'm sorry. That was
just a bad choice of words.

275
00:13:50,935 --> 00:13:53,979
I love it! Sunday around 11:00?

276
00:13:53,979 --> 00:13:57,239
- I'll bring a quiche.
- Great.

277
00:14:00,581 --> 00:14:03,583
Aren't you glad I'm not crazy anymore?

278
00:14:03,584 --> 00:14:06,620
Oh, yeah. This is so much better.

279
00:14:07,803 --> 00:14:09,444
We are over, Karl.

280
00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:11,339
And this time I mean it.

281
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:13,457
Oh, come on, Bree.

282
00:14:13,457 --> 00:14:15,330
You're gonna dump me
over a lousy brooch?

283
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,365
It's not the brooch, Karl. It's you.

284
00:14:17,366 --> 00:14:18,559
Stealing Susan's Jewelry

285
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:20,488
and then berating her for losing it?

286
00:14:20,488 --> 00:14:21,986
What kind of man does that?

287
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,038
How about a man whose wife's
taking him to the cleaners,

288
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:24,706
who wants to get back a little of

289
00:14:24,707 --> 00:14:26,709
what she's costing him?

290
00:14:26,709 --> 00:14:28,929
But how could you be so stupid
as to then give it to me?

291
00:14:28,929 --> 00:14:31,627
Did it not occur to you that
she might see me wearing it?

292
00:14:31,627 --> 00:14:33,202
Hey, when Susie and I divorced,

293
00:14:33,202 --> 00:14:34,585
she lost a lot of things.

294
00:14:34,585 --> 00:14:36,551
I forgot the brooch was one of them.

295
00:14:36,552 --> 00:14:37,763
That's your defense

296
00:14:37,764 --> 00:14:40,187
that you stole so much, you lost track?

297
00:14:40,188 --> 00:14:42,623
Let's not forget who had no problem

298
00:14:42,624 --> 00:14:45,560
staging a fake burglary to
protect her stuff from Orson.

299
00:14:45,561 --> 00:14:46,868
Well, I am not proud of that.

300
00:14:46,868 --> 00:14:48,063
I am even less proud of letting

301
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,944
my libido blind me to the fact

302
00:14:49,944 --> 00:14:50,866
that I have been fornicating

303
00:14:50,866 --> 00:14:52,965
with a morally bankrupt weasel.

304
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:58,372
- Well, not anymore. We're done.
- Wait.

305
00:14:58,373 --> 00:15:00,575
Bree...

306
00:15:00,576 --> 00:15:02,510
Will you marry me?

307
00:15:05,737 --> 00:15:08,005
Excuse me?

308
00:15:08,006 --> 00:15:09,919
I know, not the best time to ask.

309
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,304
But I was scared if I waited,
I wouldn't get another shot.

310
00:15:13,304 --> 00:15:14,930
Do you think for one
instant I would even...

311
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:16,547
don't feel you need
to answer right away.

312
00:15:16,547 --> 00:15:17,142
I'm pretty sure

313
00:15:17,142 --> 00:15:20,210
what the short-term
response would be. But, um...

314
00:15:21,896 --> 00:15:24,288
- I love you, Bree.
-For god sakes, Karl.

315
00:15:24,288 --> 00:15:25,555
And I'd be honored if you'd even

316
00:15:25,555 --> 00:15:28,257
consider becoming my wife.

317
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:31,416
- No.  I'm not done.

318
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:33,066
The man who swiped that brooch

319
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:34,946
that was the man I was.

320
00:15:34,946 --> 00:15:37,072
The man I am now is a little better,

321
00:15:37,072 --> 00:15:39,940
but he is nothing compared
to the man that I could be

322
00:15:39,941 --> 00:15:43,244
with a woman like you as my wife.

323
00:15:47,676 --> 00:15:49,007
There. Done.

324
00:15:49,703 --> 00:15:51,404
- Karl...
- Don't say anything.

325
00:15:51,404 --> 00:15:53,595
Just go. Think it over.

326
00:15:53,595 --> 00:15:55,816
- I only wanna say...
- Bup, bup, bup!

327
00:15:55,816 --> 00:15:57,590
Just think.

328
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,684
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

329
00:16:33,684 --> 00:16:35,851
I just want to thank you for the...

330
00:16:36,383 --> 00:16:39,542
Oh. Are you okay?

331
00:16:40,669 --> 00:16:42,467
You're crying. What's wrong?

332
00:16:42,467 --> 00:16:44,401
No, nothing. What's up?

333
00:16:44,402 --> 00:16:45,869
Oh, okay.

334
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:49,339
I just wanted to tell you
how well our plan is working.

335
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,219
Our plan?

336
00:16:50,219 --> 00:16:53,101
Yeah, the one about taking
the high road with Susan.

337
00:16:53,978 --> 00:16:57,676
I was just over there.
She doesn't have a clue.

338
00:16:58,044 --> 00:17:00,884
- Who's that?
- My mother.

339
00:17:00,885 --> 00:17:03,301
Oh! where does she live?

340
00:17:03,302 --> 00:17:04,655
She doesn't.

341
00:17:06,332 --> 00:17:07,033
I'm sorry.

342
00:17:07,033 --> 00:17:08,788
Tomorrow would've been her birthday.

343
00:17:08,788 --> 00:17:11,341
Every year this time I
get a little depressed.

344
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:14,464
So let's go out. I'll buy you lunch.

345
00:17:14,465 --> 00:17:16,889
It's the least I can do
for my partner in crime.

346
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:21,482
- Okay, you gotta stop with that.
- What?

347
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,339
This "our plan," "partner in crime."

348
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:25,110
This is your thing with Susan.

349
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,080
You do what you wanna do.

350
00:17:28,513 --> 00:17:31,415
Oh, you're just upset
because of your mother.

351
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:34,051
You know what?

352
00:17:34,052 --> 00:17:37,721
I'll bake you a pineapple
upside down cake.

353
00:17:37,722 --> 00:17:39,723
Best thing in the world for depression!

354
00:17:45,737 --> 00:17:48,026
Well, I called every
private school in the area.

355
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:50,083
No openings until september.

356
00:17:50,742 --> 00:17:52,125
Damn it, Gaby.

357
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:54,683
You couldn't wait till summer
to cuss out the principal?

358
00:17:54,683 --> 00:17:57,399
I make no apologies. She had it coming.

359
00:17:57,399 --> 00:17:59,191
And I'd do it again.

360
00:18:00,562 --> 00:18:02,216
She attacked our daughter.

361
00:18:02,216 --> 00:18:03,977
Well, I'm glad you're
so devoted to Juanita,

362
00:18:03,977 --> 00:18:04,831
'cause you're about to be spending

363
00:18:04,831 --> 00:18:06,161
A whole lot more time together.

364
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:07,810
What are you talking about?

365
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:09,543
I think we have other choice.

366
00:18:09,543 --> 00:18:11,477
You're gonna have to homeschool her.

367
00:18:13,814 --> 00:18:16,909
That's funny. Oh, you're good, Carlos.

368
00:18:16,909 --> 00:18:19,686
We needed something to cut the tension.

369
00:18:19,686 --> 00:18:21,854
But seriously, what do we do?

370
00:18:21,855 --> 00:18:24,724
Seriously? We enroll online,

371
00:18:24,725 --> 00:18:27,767
They send us the curriculum,
and you teach her.

372
00:18:27,767 --> 00:18:30,330
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Before this gets ugly,

373
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:32,249
you do realize I don't
know how to teach.

374
00:18:32,249 --> 00:18:35,685
Really? You taught
Juanita a few choice words.

375
00:18:35,686 --> 00:18:37,987
Me? How about you?

376
00:18:37,988 --> 00:18:40,056
What a blank of a day!

377
00:18:40,057 --> 00:18:42,425
Earl at the office is such a blank.

378
00:18:42,426 --> 00:18:44,653
I wanna kick the blank out of his blank.

379
00:18:44,653 --> 00:18:47,964
Oh, yeah? How about,
that blanking hairdresser

380
00:18:47,965 --> 00:18:50,132
totally screwed up my blanking hair!

381
00:18:50,133 --> 00:18:52,935
Look at me! I'm totally blanked!

382
00:18:52,936 --> 00:18:55,214
The blanking client
didn't sign the deal,

383
00:18:55,214 --> 00:18:56,845
and we lost a blankload of money.

384
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:59,177
Wah! Blank, blank, blank!

385
00:19:01,378 --> 00:19:04,747
Okay. We are both at fault.

386
00:19:04,748 --> 00:19:07,722
- But you're homeschooling her.
- Fine,

387
00:19:07,722 --> 00:19:10,253
but I know someone who isn't
getting blanked tonight.

388
00:19:11,134 --> 00:19:12,321
Fine with me.

389
00:19:12,322 --> 00:19:13,965
I blanked off earlier.

390
00:19:22,302 --> 00:19:24,822
- Thanks again for the pie.
- You're welcome.

391
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:29,065
So I see you're wearing the brooch.

392
00:19:29,066 --> 00:19:30,518
I must say it was awfully sweet of Karl

393
00:19:30,518 --> 00:19:33,102
to give you his grandmother's jewelry.

394
00:19:33,103 --> 00:19:33,700
When you were married,

395
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,424
did he do that sort of thing often

396
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:38,875
- surprise you with little gifts?
- Constantly.

397
00:19:38,876 --> 00:19:40,106
Really?

398
00:19:40,106 --> 00:19:43,371
Yeah, of course, after a
while I knew that it just meant

399
00:19:43,371 --> 00:19:45,263
that he'd cheated and
was feeling guilty.

400
00:19:45,499 --> 00:19:47,398
Once he went to Barbados
and brought me back

401
00:19:47,398 --> 00:19:50,922
a pair of sapphire
earrings. I cried for days.

402
00:19:53,342 --> 00:19:56,214
So... why the sudden
fascination with Karl?

403
00:19:56,214 --> 00:19:59,576
Oh, I'm hardly fascinated, just curious.

404
00:20:01,002 --> 00:20:02,269
When you talk about
your marriage to him,

405
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:04,670
it's always about the
lies and the cheating,

406
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:07,206
and you never really
talk about the good times.

407
00:20:08,377 --> 00:20:10,535
Well, there were wonderful times.

408
00:20:11,102 --> 00:20:12,906
Yeah, he was always a good kisser,

409
00:20:12,906 --> 00:20:16,046
and he could always make me laugh.

410
00:20:17,139 --> 00:20:19,567
You know, the truth is, if he
had begged my forgiveness...

411
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:23,701
I mean, if just once...

412
00:20:23,701 --> 00:20:26,860
he had told me that he
was willing to change...

413
00:20:29,933 --> 00:20:33,026
Oh! The hell with Karl.

414
00:20:33,027 --> 00:20:35,151
In fact, um...

415
00:20:36,594 --> 00:20:37,744
Here.

416
00:20:38,283 --> 00:20:40,250
No, Susan. It's yours.

417
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,859
No, it's Karl's.

418
00:20:43,749 --> 00:20:46,184
And the only jewelry I should
be wearing now is Mike's.

419
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:50,857
- Well, if you insist.
- And by the way, thanks.

420
00:20:50,857 --> 00:20:53,343
It felt good to say a
few nice things about

421
00:20:53,343 --> 00:20:54,849
Karl for a change, you know.

422
00:20:55,522 --> 00:20:58,424
Well, it was nice to hear them.

423
00:21:01,632 --> 00:21:04,834
Here you go, Gaby. It's kinda old.

424
00:21:04,835 --> 00:21:07,870
It's from before the
Soviet Union broke up.

425
00:21:07,871 --> 00:21:09,639
The Soviet Union broke up?

426
00:21:11,515 --> 00:21:12,625
You sure you know what you're doing

427
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:13,976
with this homeschooling thing?

428
00:21:13,976 --> 00:21:15,111
Oh, honey, Juanita's in first grade.

429
00:21:15,112 --> 00:21:16,946
She'll believe what I tell her.

430
00:21:16,947 --> 00:21:19,015
Hey, your phone. Oh!

431
00:21:19,016 --> 00:21:20,896
Ooh. I popped my button.

432
00:21:21,985 --> 00:21:23,773
Actually, Lynette, I'm not surprised.

433
00:21:25,048 --> 00:21:27,004
- What?
-  Well, I wasn't gonna bring it up,

434
00:21:27,004 --> 00:21:30,625
but... you have been getting
a little rounder lately.

435
00:21:30,939 --> 00:21:33,692
Well, what can I tell you, Gaby?

436
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:37,691
I'm working long hours,
I'm not exercising,

437
00:21:37,691 --> 00:21:39,474
eating a bunch of junk at work.

438
00:21:39,474 --> 00:21:40,779
Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised

439
00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:42,461
if she gets even bigger than this.

440
00:21:43,939 --> 00:21:46,439
Don't you have some homework?

441
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:49,827
Actually, I've gotta pick
up some books at the library.

442
00:21:49,827 --> 00:21:50,865
Good. I'll clean up.

443
00:21:52,222 --> 00:21:53,108
Bye.

444
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:56,605
Seriously, Lynette, you can
lose this weight in one month.

445
00:21:56,605 --> 00:21:58,818
No, Gaby, I really can't.

446
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,966
Yes, you can, and I'm gonna help you.

447
00:22:00,966 --> 00:22:02,851
What do you say we meet
every morning at 7:00

448
00:22:02,851 --> 00:22:04,605
and go for a run?

449
00:22:04,605 --> 00:22:06,053
I don't know. That's
right around the time

450
00:22:06,053 --> 00:22:07,620
I'm getting the kids ready for school.

451
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,874
Lynette, you cannot let this go.

452
00:22:08,874 --> 00:22:09,867
You know the expression

453
00:22:09,867 --> 00:22:11,829
"The longer you wait,
the bigger the butt."

454
00:22:13,427 --> 00:22:15,097
If you'll excuse me, I have to get that.

455
00:22:15,097 --> 00:22:15,950
It might be another friend

456
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:18,137
calling to tell me my ass is too fat.

457
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:20,038
Well, I'm just trying to help.

458
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:21,844
All right. Bye. I love you.

459
00:22:22,578 --> 00:22:23,573
Hello?

460
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:27,608
No, T-Scav just left.

461
00:22:27,609 --> 00:22:30,211
This is L-Scav. May I help you?

462
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,551
I'm... I'm sorry. What party?

463
00:22:46,538 --> 00:22:48,411
Oh! Niedermeyer! Mahoney!

464
00:22:48,411 --> 00:22:49,683
- Hey, Mrs. Scavo.
- Hi.

465
00:22:49,683 --> 00:22:51,899
Would you like a slice
of long island watermelon?

466
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,002
Gosh, tempting, but I
just wanna find my husband

467
00:22:55,003 --> 00:22:56,837
and bring him home.

468
00:22:56,838 --> 00:22:59,388
- Uh, he's not here.
- Don't cover for him.

469
00:22:59,388 --> 00:23:00,808
Somebody called our
house wanting to know

470
00:23:00,809 --> 00:23:03,582
why he hadn't shown up with the keg yet.

471
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:04,838
Brilliant.

472
00:23:04,838 --> 00:23:08,849
Niedermeyer, please. Tom
has actual responsibilities.

473
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:12,973
His jell-o shots and
beer pong days are over,

474
00:23:12,973 --> 00:23:14,536
and I don't appreciate his new buddies

475
00:23:14,536 --> 00:23:16,162
Making him think they're not.

476
00:23:16,162 --> 00:23:17,315
He's not our buddy.

477
00:23:17,315 --> 00:23:20,761
I don't care. I just
wanna know where he is.

478
00:23:20,762 --> 00:23:22,763
He just dropped off the keg and left.

479
00:23:22,764 --> 00:23:24,932
Well... wait! wait!

480
00:23:24,933 --> 00:23:27,635
If he's not your friend,
why is he buying you a keg?

481
00:23:27,636 --> 00:23:29,970
Why is he making you
dinner at our house?

482
00:23:34,703 --> 00:23:36,503
- Okay, boys.
- No! oh, no, no, no!

483
00:23:37,296 --> 00:23:38,665
Without this watermelon,

484
00:23:38,665 --> 00:23:41,270
all these pretty girls will stay sober,

485
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:43,679
and we know what that means.

486
00:23:43,933 --> 00:23:45,618
No! No! okay! okay! We'll tell you!

487
00:23:46,239 --> 00:23:48,707
Dude, she's got our melon!

488
00:23:50,685 --> 00:23:51,833
Tom's doing stuff for us

489
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:53,991
because gave him the
answers to the midterm.

490
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,853
He's cheating off you?

491
00:23:56,853 --> 00:23:59,164
No. We've got a connection
in the math department.

492
00:23:59,444 --> 00:24:01,311
We get the tests.

493
00:24:03,314 --> 00:24:06,058
Wait, uh, Mrs. Scavo, can
we get our watermelon back?

494
00:24:12,924 --> 00:24:15,292
- You coming to bed?
- Just a sec.

495
00:24:17,862 --> 00:24:20,697
Oh.  So exhausted.

496
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:23,743
Oh. Okay.

497
00:24:23,743 --> 00:24:27,037
No, no, no. Wait. Wait.
I am not that exhausted.

498
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:29,807
Oh. okay.

499
00:24:37,807 --> 00:24:39,098
Delfino plumbing.

500
00:24:41,286 --> 00:24:45,289
Uh, yeah. Well, exactly
what's the problem?

501
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:47,502
Look, I... I'm... I'm
not on call tonight.

502
00:24:47,502 --> 00:24:49,792
I'll... I'll try to stop by tomorrow.

503
00:24:49,792 --> 00:24:53,058
That's right, buster. You're
not going anywhere tonight.

504
00:24:53,698 --> 00:24:55,299
Mmm. No kidding.

505
00:24:56,668 --> 00:24:58,669
Katherine can fix her own leak.

506
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:00,237
That was Katherine?

507
00:25:00,238 --> 00:25:02,606
You goota get over there right now.

508
00:25:02,607 --> 00:25:04,624
Look, I know we've gotta
be friends with her,

509
00:25:04,624 --> 00:25:07,801
but not at 11:00. And not
when you're wearing this.

510
00:25:07,801 --> 00:25:09,493
Okay, she could sue us.

511
00:25:09,493 --> 00:25:11,172
Oh, she's not gonna sue us over this.

512
00:25:11,172 --> 00:25:14,315
It's not like our dog peed
on her flowers. I shot her.

513
00:25:14,315 --> 00:25:16,495
So call her back and tell
her you'll be right over.

514
00:25:17,611 --> 00:25:18,653
Fine.

515
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:20,753
How long will it take anyway?

516
00:25:20,753 --> 00:25:23,229
I don't know. It's a
leak in her master bath.

517
00:25:24,229 --> 00:25:26,029
In the bedroom?

518
00:25:32,537 --> 00:25:33,971
Hello, Mike.

519
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,208
And Susan. What are you doing here?

520
00:25:38,209 --> 00:25:42,412
I came to assist my husband,

521
00:25:42,413 --> 00:25:44,383
get the job done in half the time.

522
00:25:45,587 --> 00:25:48,021
Hey, um, where's your sling?

523
00:25:48,021 --> 00:25:51,756
Oh! My shoulder's feeling
much better. Thank you.

524
00:25:51,756 --> 00:25:56,048
That's great! So it
doesn't hurt if I do this?

525
00:25:56,048 --> 00:25:58,762
Hey, why don't we take a
look at this leaky faucet?

526
00:25:59,138 --> 00:26:00,972
Uh, uh, no.

527
00:26:00,973 --> 00:26:04,776
Actually, it's the, um,
garbage disposal in the kitchen.

528
00:26:04,777 --> 00:26:07,946
But I thought you said
it was in the master bath.

529
00:26:07,947 --> 00:26:09,714
Mike, seriously,

530
00:26:09,715 --> 00:26:12,651
why would a garbage disposal
be in the master bath?

531
00:26:12,652 --> 00:26:14,252
Come on. This way.

532
00:26:14,253 --> 00:26:16,454
It's just making this awful sound.

533
00:26:16,455 --> 00:26:18,924
Well, they're supposed
to make an awful sound.

534
00:26:35,741 --> 00:26:37,709
What are you doing up here?

535
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:39,644
I knew I never should've trusted you.

536
00:26:39,645 --> 00:26:43,081
You just wanted Mike over
here to try to seduce him.

537
00:26:43,082 --> 00:26:44,516
Really, Susan.

538
00:26:44,517 --> 00:26:46,451
You have the most suspicious mind.

539
00:26:46,452 --> 00:26:48,820
Oh, please. Look at this place.

540
00:26:48,821 --> 00:26:50,822
Even I'm getting turned on.

541
00:26:50,823 --> 00:26:54,693
So I lit a few candles and
sprinkled some rose petals.

542
00:26:54,694 --> 00:26:56,728
I do that every night.

543
00:26:56,729 --> 00:26:57,596
Really? Mm.

544
00:26:57,597 --> 00:27:00,899
Do you also drink an
entire bottle of champagne?

545
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,068
Maybe I have a little problem, okay?

546
00:27:03,069 --> 00:27:04,770
No, you have a big
problem, Katherine. Mike!

547
00:27:04,871 --> 00:27:07,000
There's no reason to
bring him into this.

548
00:27:07,008 --> 00:27:08,975
Oh, well, you say that
you do this every night,

549
00:27:08,976 --> 00:27:11,478
and he used to spend
a lot of nights here.

550
00:27:11,479 --> 00:27:14,314
So why don't we see if it
looks familiar to him? Mike!

551
00:27:14,315 --> 00:27:17,153
Mike, I need you to come up here! Mike!

552
00:27:17,284 --> 00:27:19,152
Come up here right now!

553
00:27:19,153 --> 00:27:21,454
Stop! Stop! Stop! That's evidence!

554
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,831
Leave me alone!

555
00:27:25,167 --> 00:27:27,802
Oh, my god. A bubble bath?!

556
00:27:28,081 --> 00:27:31,183
This is now a bad Jackie Collins novel.

557
00:27:31,184 --> 00:27:33,052
I want you out of my house.

558
00:27:33,053 --> 00:27:35,054
Katherine, you need help.

559
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,135
What you're doing here... it's sick!

560
00:27:38,136 --> 00:27:41,004
You don't actually think
that rose petals and champagne

561
00:27:41,005 --> 00:27:44,007
are gonna work on Mike. He loves me!

562
00:27:44,438 --> 00:27:47,174
Don't push me, Susan. I'll sue you!

563
00:27:47,175 --> 00:27:49,643
Oh, you know what? Go ahead. Sue me!

564
00:27:49,644 --> 00:27:51,645
And while you're at it,

565
00:27:51,646 --> 00:27:53,947
get me for assault
with a strawberry, too.

566
00:27:53,948 --> 00:27:56,082
Uhh! Just...

567
00:27:56,083 --> 00:27:58,952
You bitch! Aah!

568
00:28:02,323 --> 00:28:04,825
Crazy! Aah!

569
00:28:21,576 --> 00:28:25,779
F.Y.I., we hate her again.

570
00:28:42,296 --> 00:28:44,000
Mahoney called me and
told me that you...

571
00:28:44,006 --> 00:28:47,108
- Know about the cheating?
- Yeah. I do.

572
00:28:47,109 --> 00:28:49,977
What I don't know is what the
hell's the matter with you.

573
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:53,681
Why would you do something that stupid?

574
00:28:53,682 --> 00:28:56,884
Because it is a required
course that I will never use,

575
00:28:56,885 --> 00:28:59,654
and...

576
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:02,390
I'm failing it.

577
00:29:02,391 --> 00:29:05,660
You're failing?

578
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:08,095
We can't afford to have you fail.

579
00:29:08,096 --> 00:29:10,565
I know. That's why I did this,

580
00:29:10,566 --> 00:29:12,967
so that I could focus
all of my attention

581
00:29:12,968 --> 00:29:14,969
on my core classes.

582
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:16,904
Are... are you failing those, too?

583
00:29:16,905 --> 00:29:18,206
No...

584
00:29:18,207 --> 00:29:21,008
But it's
touch-and-go.

585
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:25,546
My advisor warned me that
learning a language at my age

586
00:29:25,547 --> 00:29:27,048
would be difficult,

587
00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:29,617
and Mandarin is one of the hardest.

588
00:29:29,618 --> 00:29:32,453
I study and I study, but
I... I'm always behind.

589
00:29:32,454 --> 00:29:36,357
Lynette, you gotta
understand, I am drowning here.

590
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:42,029
I don't care.

591
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,232
What?

592
00:29:44,233 --> 00:29:46,734
You're having trouble
in school? Talk to me.

593
00:29:46,735 --> 00:29:48,803
Talk to your professors. Hire a tutor.

594
00:29:48,804 --> 00:29:50,705
What you don't do is cheat.

595
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:53,341
Come on, Lynette.
It... it is statistics.

596
00:29:53,342 --> 00:29:55,276
I'm never gonna use it.

597
00:29:55,277 --> 00:29:58,045
It's the principle of the thing, Tom!

598
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,947
What if the kids found out?

599
00:29:59,948 --> 00:30:02,783
What kind of example
are you setting for them?

600
00:30:02,784 --> 00:30:04,752
The same one you're setting.

601
00:30:06,488 --> 00:30:08,856
When Gabrielle asked you
if you were gaining weight,

602
00:30:08,857 --> 00:30:11,592
- didn't you lie?
- Oh, clearly that's different.

603
00:30:11,593 --> 00:30:14,428
- Why?
- Because of the consequences.

604
00:30:14,429 --> 00:30:16,430
You could get kicked out of school.

605
00:30:16,431 --> 00:30:19,300
And you could lose one
of your best friends.

606
00:30:19,301 --> 00:30:22,069
I'm going to tell Gaby the truth...

607
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:22,356
eventually.

608
00:30:22,356 --> 00:30:24,872
And when you do, she'll tell Carlos.

609
00:30:24,873 --> 00:30:26,540
And when he finds out

610
00:30:26,541 --> 00:30:29,710
that his new Vice President
lied to him, he may fire you.

611
00:30:29,711 --> 00:30:32,713
Some more about consequences?

612
00:30:32,714 --> 00:30:35,850
I think the way you're trying
to rationalize your behavior

613
00:30:35,851 --> 00:30:36,172
is pathetic.

614
00:30:36,172 --> 00:30:38,386
We are two middle-aged people, Lynette.

615
00:30:38,387 --> 00:30:40,888
We both know the value of principles.

616
00:30:40,889 --> 00:30:44,258
We also know something that
we've never told the kids...

617
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,694
that there are, sadly,
some times in life

618
00:30:46,695 --> 00:30:50,498
when you need to break the
rules in order to survive.

619
00:30:53,035 --> 00:30:54,969
I cheated on a test.

620
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:56,971
You don't want to pat
me on the back? Fine.

621
00:30:56,972 --> 00:30:58,873
But don't act like
you are better than me,

622
00:30:57,874 --> 00:30:59,841
'cause you're not.

623
00:31:03,378 --> 00:31:06,213
"Okay," said Skippy.

624
00:31:06,214 --> 00:31:09,717
"I'll meet you down at
red creek after school."

625
00:31:09,718 --> 00:31:12,019
This is boring. Can I watch TV?

626
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,921
Juanita, while you're here with me,

627
00:31:13,922 --> 00:31:15,957
it's the same as if you were at school.

628
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:18,626
We just finished gym class.
Now it's time for reading.

629
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:20,661
Ironing isn't gym class.

630
00:31:20,662 --> 00:31:22,596
Hey, who's the teacher here, huh?

631
00:31:22,597 --> 00:31:23,831
Read!

632
00:31:23,832 --> 00:31:26,233
You read.

633
00:31:27,836 --> 00:31:29,770
Juanita!

634
00:31:29,771 --> 00:31:31,772
Come on.

635
00:31:31,773 --> 00:31:35,242
Let's just finish this chapter.

636
00:31:42,083 --> 00:31:44,018
Don't even think about it.

637
00:31:46,454 --> 00:31:49,990
I'm warning you. I am not playing.

638
00:31:56,298 --> 00:32:00,234
Juanita, so help me god...

639
00:32:00,235 --> 00:32:02,336
- Pick it up!
- No.

640
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:05,339
Pick it up or end up
on the floor next to it.

641
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:15,582
Thank you. That's much better.

642
00:32:19,821 --> 00:32:23,290
Hello? So what did we learn today?

643
00:32:23,291 --> 00:32:26,359
- Pick up the book! Pick it up!
- No! No!

644
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:29,296
Gaby, what the hell is going on?!

645
00:32:29,297 --> 00:32:31,765
It's called homeschooling!

646
00:32:31,766 --> 00:32:34,167
Pick... up... the... book!

647
00:32:35,215 --> 00:32:37,149
I did what you asked, Karl.

648
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:39,418
I went home and thought
about your proposal.

649
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:43,155
And? No, wait. Not yet.
Do I need to brace myself?

650
00:32:43,156 --> 00:32:45,791
- I'm not gonna say no.
- Really?

651
00:32:45,792 --> 00:32:47,659
Or yes. What's the point

652
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,895
when I already have a
husband I can't seem to shake?

653
00:32:49,896 --> 00:32:53,132
So for now, you might wanna
focus on getting me a divorce.

654
00:32:53,133 --> 00:32:55,801
And if I do that, you'll marry me?

655
00:32:55,802 --> 00:32:58,904
No, not you, but I am
interested in this other Karl...

656
00:32:58,905 --> 00:33:01,340
the one you say you're
planning to become.

657
00:33:01,341 --> 00:33:04,443
Yeah, if you marry me.

658
00:33:04,444 --> 00:33:06,537
Well, I'm afraid

659
00:33:06,538 --> 00:33:08,213
He's gonna have to make an
appearance sooner than that.

660
00:33:08,214 --> 00:33:11,050
I think I can arrange a meeting.

661
00:33:11,051 --> 00:33:14,753
Oh! That's another thing.
No sex for at least a month.

662
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:15,927
A month?

663
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:18,551
You are too adept at using
it to cloud my judgment.

664
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:21,164
I wanna see you through
eyes that are clear,

665
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:22,299
not rolling back in my head.

666
00:33:22,299 --> 00:33:24,568
So I have to be a good boy and no sex.

667
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:26,603
It's like we're married already.

668
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:29,172
Karl, if we go public
with this, let alone marry,

669
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:31,341
there will be serious consequences.

670
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,343
Susan may never speak to me again,

671
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,345
and god only knows what Orson will do.

672
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,380
I will not even contemplate
paying that price

673
00:33:37,381 --> 00:33:39,816
until I'm sure you're
damn well worth it.

674
00:33:40,774 --> 00:33:43,376
And if you can prove that you are...

675
00:33:46,346 --> 00:33:48,414
then you can give this to me again.

676
00:33:48,415 --> 00:33:51,451
And next time, it'll mean something.

677
00:34:05,144 --> 00:34:08,080
Well, did you talk with her?
Is she ready to apologize?

678
00:34:08,598 --> 00:34:10,298
Mm, not quite.

679
00:34:10,299 --> 00:34:12,400
She heard what you
said to the principal,

680
00:34:12,401 --> 00:34:14,537
and she is blaming you

681
00:34:14,538 --> 00:34:16,246
for her not being allowed
to go back to school.

682
00:34:16,246 --> 00:34:17,706
So you defended me, right?

683
00:34:17,707 --> 00:34:20,141
Well, that was a little tough,

684
00:34:20,142 --> 00:34:21,896
what with her being
right and you being wrong.

685
00:34:21,896 --> 00:34:24,412
What do you mean wrong?
I did what I did for her.

686
00:34:24,413 --> 00:34:27,048
Really?

687
00:34:27,049 --> 00:34:29,551
You don't think that
maybe a teeny bit of that

688
00:34:29,552 --> 00:34:32,020
was in response to you
being criticized as a mom?

689
00:34:32,021 --> 00:34:33,154
No!

690
00:34:35,105 --> 00:34:38,041
Well, maybe "the horse
you rode in on" part,

691
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:40,977
but the original sentiment was
all in defense of our daughter.

692
00:34:40,978 --> 00:34:43,113
Where does she get off being mad at me?

693
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:45,248
Gaby, she can't go to school
and be with her friends.

694
00:34:45,344 --> 00:34:47,595
She can't have people
over because a chimp

695
00:34:47,596 --> 00:34:49,347
mauled a clown at her birthday party.

696
00:34:50,002 --> 00:34:52,437
She has every right to be mad.

697
00:34:52,438 --> 00:34:55,707
You... not so much.

698
00:35:15,461 --> 00:35:19,164
Ma? It's me.

699
00:35:19,165 --> 00:35:23,101
I know. It's been a
long time. I'm sorry.

700
00:35:23,102 --> 00:35:25,504
No, you know I can't tell you that.

701
00:35:25,505 --> 00:35:27,606
Just... know that we're safe, okay?

702
00:35:27,607 --> 00:35:30,242
Oh, ma, please, don't cry.

703
00:35:30,243 --> 00:35:34,713
We only have a few
minutes to talk, okay?

704
00:35:34,714 --> 00:35:37,048
He's good.

705
00:35:37,049 --> 00:35:39,384
He just turned 19.

706
00:35:39,385 --> 00:35:42,787
I know. Can you believe it?

707
00:35:42,788 --> 00:35:46,258
Yeah, I wish we could, too.
Uh, it's just too risky.

708
00:35:46,259 --> 00:35:49,227
But, you know, maybe
one of these days...

709
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:52,998
Ma, I gotta go.

710
00:35:52,999 --> 00:35:55,967
I... I... I'll talk to you
soon. Rimanga Bene, okay?

711
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:01,273
Hey ya, Katherine. What you got there?

712
00:36:01,274 --> 00:36:03,608
I thought you said your mother was dead.

713
00:36:03,609 --> 00:36:06,144
Oh, yeah. That was
my mother-in-law.

714
00:36:06,145 --> 00:36:07,913
Nick's mom.

715
00:36:09,081 --> 00:36:10,582
You call her "ma"?

716
00:36:10,583 --> 00:36:12,217
We're close.

717
00:36:12,218 --> 00:36:14,185
I didn't hear you come in.

718
00:36:14,186 --> 00:36:16,821
The front door was open. here.

719
00:36:18,691 --> 00:36:21,526
Hey, is that one of
those prepaid phones?

720
00:36:21,527 --> 00:36:24,062
Oh, yeah. When Nick
and I went on vacation,

721
00:36:24,063 --> 00:36:26,131
we bought this to call home.

722
00:36:26,132 --> 00:36:28,233
And then we had some minutes left over,

723
00:36:28,234 --> 00:36:30,524
so I figured I'd use 'em up.

724
00:36:30,525 --> 00:36:31,670
What's on your mind, Katherine?

725
00:36:31,671 --> 00:36:34,706
Well, I wanted to drop
off the cake as promised

726
00:36:34,707 --> 00:36:39,678
and tell you last night,
Susan and I had a big fight.

727
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:41,746
She threw me into the bathtub.

728
00:36:41,747 --> 00:36:43,181
Really?

729
00:36:43,182 --> 00:36:45,717
First she shoots me, now
she tries to drown me.

730
00:36:45,718 --> 00:36:47,652
I'm going to the police,

731
00:36:47,653 --> 00:36:50,121
so I'm gonna need that gun for evidence.

732
00:36:50,122 --> 00:36:52,290
What gun?

733
00:36:52,291 --> 00:36:54,859
The one she shot me with.

734
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,895
The one Danny gave Julie.

735
00:37:01,534 --> 00:37:04,536
Listen, Katherine, I really
don't think it's a good idea

736
00:37:04,537 --> 00:37:07,505
gettin' the police involved.

737
00:37:07,506 --> 00:37:10,308
Just stick to your plan.

738
00:37:10,309 --> 00:37:14,613
I hate that she can get away with this.

739
00:37:17,817 --> 00:37:22,854
Hey. Nick's not Italian, is he?

740
00:37:22,855 --> 00:37:24,389
No. Why?

741
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:28,326
'Cause you were talking
to his mother in Italian.

742
00:37:28,327 --> 00:37:32,030
Oh, she likes it. Makes
her feel sophisticated.

743
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,568
I have a doctor's
appointment in 40 minutes.

744
00:37:36,569 --> 00:37:39,057
I really should get dressed.

745
00:37:39,058 --> 00:37:40,972
But thank you for the cake.

746
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:49,031
What's that, sweetie, your homework?

747
00:37:49,032 --> 00:37:51,967
It's all homework now, isn't it?

748
00:37:54,003 --> 00:37:56,405
Look, Juanita,

749
00:37:56,406 --> 00:37:59,341
you know, when I was young,
I used to get picked on

750
00:37:59,342 --> 00:38:01,410
because I was the
littlest kid in my class,

751
00:38:01,411 --> 00:38:04,046
and I couldn't defend
myself from the bullies.

752
00:38:04,047 --> 00:38:06,982
And then I discovered a
part of me that was big...

753
00:38:06,983 --> 00:38:09,218
my mouth.

754
00:38:09,219 --> 00:38:11,553
And I've been fighting
back with it ever since.

755
00:38:11,554 --> 00:38:13,522
So when Mrs. Peterson
said those mean things,

756
00:38:13,523 --> 00:38:14,831
I had to defend you.

757
00:38:14,832 --> 00:38:16,358
Why? I said a bad word.

758
00:38:16,359 --> 00:38:18,686
If you just let her punish me,

759
00:38:18,687 --> 00:38:19,928
this would all be over.

760
00:38:19,929 --> 00:38:21,797
Believe me, leaving that school

761
00:38:21,798 --> 00:38:24,500
Is gonna wind up being a good thing.

762
00:38:24,501 --> 00:38:25,768
Mrs. Peterson is a bully.

763
00:38:25,769 --> 00:38:26,635
I like Mrs. Peterson.

764
00:38:30,406 --> 00:38:36,745
Okay. I was wrong, and
I'm sorry you're upset.

765
00:38:38,615 --> 00:38:41,817
You still think I'm a good mom, right?

766
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,988
Honey?

767
00:38:45,989 --> 00:38:49,625
Can we just read?

768
00:38:56,766 --> 00:38:59,234
I'm telling you, Katherine
cannot be trusted.

769
00:38:59,235 --> 00:39:02,271
The way she talks about
stealing Mike back from you?

770
00:39:02,272 --> 00:39:04,273
She has completely lost it.

771
00:39:04,274 --> 00:39:06,642
Believe me, I know. Mike
and I have a new rule.

772
00:39:06,643 --> 00:39:09,645
We're going to pretend that
Katherine doesn't exist.

773
00:39:09,646 --> 00:39:11,713
You think that's gonna be enough?

774
00:39:11,714 --> 00:39:12,915
You need to get her off the street.

775
00:39:12,916 --> 00:39:15,884
Katherine hates you,

776
00:39:15,885 --> 00:39:18,620
And I'm not talkin' "dirty
looks in the supermarket" hate.

777
00:39:18,621 --> 00:39:20,556
That woman is dangerous.

778
00:39:20,557 --> 00:39:22,090
Dangerous how?

779
00:39:22,091 --> 00:39:26,728
Okay. I can't believe
I'm even saying this.

780
00:39:26,729 --> 00:39:29,231
But do you know where Katherine was

781
00:39:29,232 --> 00:39:31,400
the night that Julie was attacked?

782
00:39:35,705 --> 00:39:39,474
No. That's crazy. Um...

783
00:39:39,475 --> 00:39:42,010
Why would Katherine want to hurt Julie?

784
00:39:42,011 --> 00:39:45,547
You had just married
the man that she loved.

785
00:39:45,548 --> 00:39:47,282
It was dark.

786
00:39:47,283 --> 00:39:50,085
A woman walked out of your house...

787
00:39:52,922 --> 00:39:56,291
maybe she didn't think it was Julie.

788
00:40:01,664 --> 00:40:04,933
There are so many rules in this world.

789
00:40:04,934 --> 00:40:07,469
That's why we must start learning them

790
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:11,173
while we are still children.

791
00:40:11,174 --> 00:40:13,542
We are told very clearly...

792
00:40:13,543 --> 00:40:17,112
"Don't say bad words."

793
00:40:24,487 --> 00:40:28,624
"It's not nice to lie to your friends."

794
00:40:30,526 --> 00:40:34,229
"You shouldn't covet
a man who isn't yours."

795
00:40:36,032 --> 00:40:40,869
"And you shouldn't betray a man who is."

796
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:43,998
So we grow up,

797
00:40:43,999 --> 00:40:46,842
and still we break the rules...

798
00:40:46,843 --> 00:40:51,747
completely forgetting
that if someone catches us,

799
00:40:51,748 --> 00:40:54,000
we will be punished.

800
00:40:54,004 --> 00:40:56,505
- Hi there. .
- Yes, good afternoon, sir.

801
00:40:56,506 --> 00:40:58,023
Uh, I was hoping to
replace the camel brooch

802
00:40:58,053 --> 00:40:59,889
my wife purchased here.

803
00:41:00,005 --> 00:41:01,550
I'd like to surprise her.

804
00:41:01,735 --> 00:41:04,429
A brooch? Hmm, we don't
have anything like that here.

805
00:41:05,551 --> 00:41:06,582
You must be mistaken.

806
00:41:06,583 --> 00:41:08,645
My wife was quite specific
about where she purchased it.

807
00:41:09,493 --> 00:41:11,664
Sorry, we sell furniture.

808
00:41:12,365 --> 00:41:13,779
She must've gotten it somewhere else.

809
00:41:15,446 --> 00:41:16,485
Excuse me.
