1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,340
Previously on Desperate Housewives...

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:04,640
the accountant's dropping off the
papers for my cayman island account.

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,950
This is everything you
need to access the money.

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,060
Edie got an opportunity...

5
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:10,470
But lost it.

6
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:12,350
mike...

7
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,520
you will go to rehab,or so
help me,I will leave you.

8
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:16,420
Made a promise.

9
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:17,440
I'll go.

10
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,850
I keep thinking about
what we covered up.

11
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:25,070
Katherine's aunt was determined
to reveal the truth...

12
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,310
and victor...

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,760
Was a victim of the tornado...

14
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,170
That brought devastation...

15
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,170
oh,my god!

16
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,200
to wisteria lane.

17
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:48,040
once the tornado had passed,it began.

18
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:55,180
A man gave his coat to
a stranger in need...

19
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,600
a woman shared her food
with those just passing by...

20
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:09,020
a teenager reunited a dog
with its worried owner.

21
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:16,020
These are the things that happen
in the wake of any great disaster.

22
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,440
People start to perform
small acts of kindness.

23
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:28,470
they do what they can to
help,all the while knowing...

24
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,170
it won't be enough.

25
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:44,560
why is it taking so long?
They should be going faster.

26
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,210
The fire captain said
they have to go slowly.

27
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,220
They don't want debris suddenly
collapsing into the basement.

28
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:51,750
Has anyone heard from gaby?

29
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,550
Uh,she went to the hospital with carlos.

30
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,470
He was pretty banged up,but
they say he's gonnbe okay.

31
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,030
Thank god.

32
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,000
Why can't we hear them?

33
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:04,150
If my kids are alive,they would
be yelling. tom would be yelling.

34
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,040
Okay,lynette,listen to me.
They are all going to be fine.

35
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:10,300
- I know it.
- Okay.

36
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,200
You really,really,really think so?

37
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:15,490
Yes,yes,I do. I do.

38
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,820
So I want you to go
over to those paramedics,

39
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:20,140
and I want you to let
them look at these cuts.

40
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:23,990
Because you don't want to be all bloody
when they pull your kids out of there,do you?

41
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,870
No. No,I guess not.

42
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,910
- what are you doing?
- What?

43
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:40,630
You don't know if her
kids are gonna be okay.

44
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,710
I'm just trying to comfort her.

45
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,890
By giving her false hope?

46
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,950
What do you suggest we do?

47
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,640
Well,you should be
saying,"lynette,this could end badly.

48
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,990
So you should start preparing
yourself for that now."

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,570
Edie,if you say that to lynette,so
help me god,I will wring your neck.

50
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,980
And I will help her.

51
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:02,340
Tom and ida and the kids
are buried under that rubble.

52
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,400
I mean,what is it with you people?

53
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,530
Why aren't you willing
to face the facts?

54
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,470
Because we're hoping for a miracle.

55
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,620
A miracle?

56
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:12,160
Maybe,just maybe,if we
stop flapping our gums,

57
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:17,590
and we start asking god to take care
of our folks,he might just help us out.

58
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,890
So you think a prayer circle
is going to help lynette?

59
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:26,100
Once you get to my age,you'll find it a lot easier
to believe that god really does answer prayers.

60
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,510
- So if you can just hang on two more years...
- don'T.

61
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:34,350
You know,maybe a moment of silence
wouldn't be such a bad idea.

62
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,360
Hey,guys! We got someone!

63
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,850
Mom!

64
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,670
Mom!

65
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,910
- mom!
- Mom!

66
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,330
oh,my god!

67
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,230
Come on,tom.

68
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,110
straight ahead,sir. Go
ahead.Right over there.

69
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,480
Oh,my god.

70
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,470
Where's ida?

71
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:51,460
Tom! Where's ida?

72
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:05,550
Yes,in the wake of a great tragedy,

73
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,960
people do what they can to help...

74
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:15,260
all the while knowing...

75
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,740
it won't be enough.

79
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,750
The morning after the tornado,

80
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:37,020
the residents of wisteria lane
began to sort through the devastation

81
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:42,590
and slowly started picking
up the pieces of their lives.

82
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:49,200
Bob hunter found part of his
fountain in the middle of the street.

83
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:54,880
Bree hodge found her lawn
mower next to her coffee table.

84
00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:01,940
And kayla scavo discovered
her music box in a tree...

85
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,180
among... other things.

86
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:10,740
She had your address in her
pocket,but there wano other I.D.

87
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,010
Did you know her?

88
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,350
Sort of.

89
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,930
Her name is sylvia greene.

90
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,380
Is she local?

91
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,390
I knew her from chicago.

92
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,250
She was... visiting.

93
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,900
Okay,I guess that's all we need.

94
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,480
Would you like me to follow up with
you after we contact the family?

95
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,990
No.

96
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,650
so...

97
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,390
I guess this means it's over.

98
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:47,940
The fact that she is dead does not
change the fact that you slept with her.

99
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,310
I know it doesn'T.

100
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,360
I made a terrible mistake,and
I am so sorry,katherine.

101
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:56,580
I'm sure you are.

102
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,420
I want you out of my house tonight.

103
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,960
- You don't mean that.
- Yes,I do.It's over.

104
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:06,300
Asar as I'm concerned,you could be
lying on that slabright next to her.

105
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,700
3 Days Later

106
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:25,520
come on,ida. You can
watch us pack from up here.

107
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,360
The things you accumulate
in a lifetime,huh?

108
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:32,610
Yeah,especially if you
never throw anything out.

109
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:37,810
so her niece and nephew are taking
all this stuff back to nebraska?

110
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,000
Well,the stuff that'll sell on ebay.

111
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:42,070
I'm guessing t rest will
end up in a dumpster.

112
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,530
What's all this baseball stuff?
There's a mitt and a jersey.

113
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,680
Was this her husband's?

114
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:49,640
No,that was ida's from
her pro baseball days.

115
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,670
Yeah,right.

116
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:55,290
Oh,you're serious?

117
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,910
Ida played in the all-american
girls league during world war ii.

118
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,560
- You didn't know that?
- No.

119
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:02,160
Oh,she was a superstar.
Arm like a cannon.

120
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:05,530
People said she could throw
a porkchop past a hungry wolf.

121
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,950
Ida?

122
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:12,450
I have trouble seeing her as the leadoff
hitter for anything other than osteoporosis.

123
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:15,760
She made the only unassisted
triple play in league history...

124
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,280
right here in granville field,1944.

125
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,950
That's why she wants her
ashes scattered there.

126
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,620
how did I not know this?

127
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:27,650
daddy said you were
over here. Can I help?

128
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,720
you realize we're cleaning,right?
We're not eating candy.

129
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:36,620
That's sweet,parker,but we've got everything
under control here if you want to go play.

130
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:41,060
No,I want to do something
nice for mrs.Greenberg.

131
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,420
She sort of saved my life.

132
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:46,110
What do you mean?

133
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:53,790
When the house started shaking,and
daddy was passed out by his asthma...

134
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,990
mrs.Greenberg made us
all go under the stairs.

135
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:06,100
- But that's not where they found her.
- Yeah.

136
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:08,910
There wasn't enough room for her.

137
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,120
She said she'd be okay in the corner.

138
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,290
Uh,parker,you want to help?

139
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:20,870
Ida has some ice cream in the freezer that
needs eating before it goes bad. Go on.

140
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:34,050
I know what you're thinking,but don'T.

141
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:37,170
If you'd been there,it wouldn't
have made a bit of difference.

142
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,140
Susan,we can't thank you enough.

143
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,590
Opening your home to
us-- it's so generous.

144
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,270
It's a horrible feeling to literally
not have a roof over your head,

145
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,950
and that smoky fleabag hotel
just wasn't safe for a newborn.

146
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,550
Please,this is what best friends do...

147
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:08,890
right before their friendship ends.

148
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,370
Why did you agree to let her stay?

149
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,030
How do you say no to someone in need?

150
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,320
That wasn't rhetorical.
Seriously,you got anything?

151
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:18,450
I know you feel guilty because
she let us stay with her once,

152
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,770
but don't you remember
how miserable were?

153
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,930
Oh,yeah. Every cup needs a coaster.

154
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,460
Every coaster needs a doily.
Every doily needs daily laundering.

155
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,480
This woman is gonna drive
me out of my frickin'--

156
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:29,160
hey,roomies.You need help?

157
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,740
no,we've got it under control.

158
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:34,160
Oh,and,uh,listen. Bob and lee introduced
us to this wonderful contractor,

159
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:35,990
so we won't be imposing for long.

160
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,570
Imposing. Who's imposing?

161
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,890
You can stay as long as you want.

162
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:44,250
I'm sorry. The words came out of my
mouth before I knew what I was saying.

163
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,040
Then stop talking,and don't be so nice.

164
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:48,040
Otherwise,she'll just
take the place over.

165
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:50,060
hey,susan,orson likes to
sleep with the window open.

166
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:53,300
Do you mind if we
rearrange the furniture?

167
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,630
Sounds good to me!

168
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,600
hello,gabrielle.

169
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:19,480
Milton. Hi.

170
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,550
It's a nice turnout.

171
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,370
victor was loved by a lot of people.

172
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:31,850
It's gonna be a very emotional day.

173
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,480
You seem remarkably composed.

174
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,370
Oh,no,no.I'm
a mess--

175
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:42,190
- you know,on the inside,where the mascara can't run.
- Ah,I see.

176
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,390
The reading of the will is today.

177
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,920
Is it? I'd forgotten.

178
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:52,500
- I thought you'd be curious as to how much you'll inherit.
- No.

179
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:53,880
I'm not thinking aboumoney today.

180
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:56,730
- I'm burying my husband.
- Of course.

181
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,670
It's just,I,uh...

182
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:04,870
spoke to the executor of the will,and I have
a ballpark figure of what you'll be getting.

183
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:15,240
Well,I guess there's nothing
disrespectful about a ballpark figure.

184
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,860
You're not getting a dime.

185
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,560
Victor showed me the photographs
of you and your ex-husband.

186
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:29,290
You broke his heart. You humiliated him.

187
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,790
So you'll inherit exactly
what you deserve--nothing.

188
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,690
Okay,I made a mista.

189
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,980
I'm sorry,but victor
wasn't entirely blameless.

190
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:43,600
He ignored me. He used me politically.

191
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:46,290
Oh,yeah,and he tried to kill carlos.

192
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,550
So I think I'm entitled
to whatever he had.

193
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,320
Ah,there's the thing.

194
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:56,970
You married a man from a very rich
family-- the operative word being "family."

195
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:00,270
Everything's in my name... always was.

196
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,170
the service is starting.

197
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,380
I think it's time for you to go.

198
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,050
Go?

199
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:13,060
You can't kick me out
of my husband's funeral.

200
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:15,690
I think it's appropriate,given
the circumstances.

201
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,970
Go to hell.

202
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,710
I'll be delivering the eulogy.

203
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,900
If you're stilin this pew
when I reach the pulpit,

204
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:29,750
I'm going to be telling all of these
people that you are a cheating,lying whore.

205
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:37,900
See? I told you it was
gonna be an emotional day.

206
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,400
hello,boys.

207
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:14,470
Bob,lee,I baked you some muffins to thank
you for introducing me to walter here.

208
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,030
And,walter,I decided
you're absolutely right.

209
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:18,850
Dark shingles are the way to go.

210
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,820
Why are you all staring at me?

211
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:25,650
- I'm sorry,but I'm not gonna be able to fix your house.
- What?

212
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:29,290
I've just had some bad
news in my personal life.

213
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,730
Oh,good heavens. I hope no one's died,

214
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,810
which is the only
possible excuse I'd accept.

215
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:37,690
No,it's not--it's
not that. It's just...

216
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,700
I don't want to get into it.

217
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:41,570
Walter,I can't find a contractor now.

218
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,000
- Everybody is booked for the next year.
- I'm sorry.

219
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:47,090
Walter. Walter.

220
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,510
Walter,I'm begging you. Please.

221
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:51,780
I'm living like a vagabond
in a teenage girl's bedroom.

222
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,380
I'm sleeping under a
poster of orlando bloom.

223
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,610
You can't leave me.

224
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,230
Yeah,well,sometimes people do that.

225
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,580
They just leave.

226
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,070
This is a nightmare.

227
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,410
What is going on?

228
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,330
Walter went rough a bad breakup,

229
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,230
and today he found out that his
ex moved in with someone else.

230
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:19,970
Oh,for god sakes. Tell him to put on
his big boy pants and find another girl.

231
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,070
Who says it's a girl?

232
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,590
Walter's gay?

233
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,490
Yes.

234
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,920
He can build home and decorate them.

235
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,410
Sometimes god gives with both hands.

236
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,240
Well,then you just have
to fix him up with someone,

237
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,200
give him back his will to work.

238
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:37,850
yeah,about that-- uh,most
of our friends are 9s,

239
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,140
and walter--we love
him-- but kind of a 3.

240
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:44,780
And in the gay world,3
does not go into 9.

241
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:55,480
Well,we'll just have to find him
someone who's not good at gay math.

242
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:57,270
Well,I drove all the way out there,

243
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:01,190
and I waited for hours and then
they wouldn't let me see him.

244
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:06,750
Uh,no. They just said that
I should--I should call you.

245
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,650
listen,I know it's a 30-day rehab.

246
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:13,070
I'm not trying to break him out.

247
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:15,950
I'm just trying to see him.

248
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:21,780
You know what? Could you
just call me when you know?

249
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,280
Thank you.

250
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,740
welcome to heaven.

251
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:54,460
Don't talk. I'm smelling.

252
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,920
What is that?

253
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,510
Duck a l'orange.

254
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,320
Bree says it's making a comeback.

255
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,190
And our oven is making its debut.

256
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,780
Oh,it gets better.

257
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,230
She did our laundry,too.

258
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,110
Smell my sock.

259
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:13,580
Oh,my god! I want to eat that.

260
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,040
she dusts. She irons.

261
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,840
Oh,and she does this magic trick.

262
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,910
No matter where you throw your
sweater,within seconds,it's on a hanger.

263
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:23,190
This has just replaced your
birth as the best day of my life.

264
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,030
Oh,hi,susan. I hope you
don't mind that I made dinner.

265
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,650
I hope you don't mind
that I'm going to kiss you.

266
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:29,820
You're funny.

267
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,250
Now I need you to be
honest about this recipe.

268
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,110
It's a dry run for a small dinner
party I'm having tomorrow night.

269
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,970
Again,if you don't mind.

270
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,860
Not at all.

271
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:41,650
In--in fact,if you wanna do a dry run
for sunday brunch,I'm there for you.

272
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,940
Dinner will beeady shortly.

273
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,550
Oh,and,julie,I fixed the hem
on that blue skirt of yours.

274
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,420
It's on your bed.

275
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,620
My hem is fixed?

276
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,490
She's like the mother I never had.

277
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,640
Oh,oh,no offense.

278
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,950
Oh,none taken.

279
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,240
hey.

280
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,600
How you feeling?

281
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:14,620
Uh,not so great.

282
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:17,020
Well,they should give you
something for the pain.

283
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:20,470
They gave me this button that I can
press,but I'm trying not to use it,

284
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,760
'cause the drugs make me
feel a little to mellow.

285
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,570
was the funeral sad?

286
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,910
Tragic.

287
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:32,230
I found out everything victor
had is in milton's name,

288
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:35,950
and he told his father about
us,so I'm not getting a penny.

289
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,040
it's a good thing you hooked
up with another rich guy.

290
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:48,040
yeah...

291
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:51,090
gaby,you sound weird.

292
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,650
Why do you sound so weird?

293
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,400
Gaby.

294
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:01,640
Um,remember that day,uh...

295
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:06,290
when al was going to drop
off the account information?

296
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:07,790
Oh,my god. He didn't?

297
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,940
No,no,no. He did.

298
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,200
It's just...

299
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:13,410
remember how windy it was that day?

300
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,880
No,no,no. That was the only copy.

301
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:21,060
I know,but edie was trying
to steal the papers from me,

302
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:26,130
and we got into this fight,and then
the tornado just took them away.

303
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,410
They're gone?

304
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:29,110
Kinda.

305
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,520
what is that sound?

306
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,800
I'm texting someone.

307
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,620
Gaby,that account was our future.

308
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:37,890
What are we gonna do now?

309
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,250
Carlos,just calm down,okay?

310
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:46,960
I'm sure al has an access code or a copy or some
super nerd way to get back into the account,okay?

311
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,450
I know we can fix this.

312
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,200
Yeah.

313
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,570
yeah,he could fix it.

314
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,020
Okay.

315
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:04,290
All right,you look very
tired,so I'm just gonna go.

316
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,480
But I'm warning you,gaby,if
we don't find those papers,

317
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,840
so help me,I'M...

318
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:23,180
Hi. Um,I'm a friend of al's,and I
was wondering if I could see him.

319
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:25,410
Of course. Please come in.

320
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,240
Right this way.

321
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:46,090
dear al, rest in peace

322
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:48,170
oh,al.

323
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,430
thanks again for your help.

324
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,530
Well,we'd do anything for your aunt.

325
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:55,830
I hope you know what an
amazing woman she was.

326
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,970
Hey,did you guys happen
to find a pearl necklace?

327
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,460
It's the only valuable
thing aunt ida owned.

328
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:02,330
Well,actually,I have it.

329
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:05,240
Yeah,she promised it to me if
she kicked the bucket first.

330
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:08,480
Oh,really?
In--in writing?

331
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:12,420
I'll be right back.

332
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,600
all right,let's hit the road.

333
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,770
At about the rest of these boxes?

334
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,410
Oh,that's junk. You
can just give 'em away.

335
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,440
Hey,listen. Is there a good place
we can grab a bite on the way out?

336
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,560
Um,well,there's a great diner
right near granville field.

337
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,570
Isn't that-- isn't that
outt that out of the way?

338
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:32,890
Yeah,you stopping there anyway
to spread your aunt's ashes?

339
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:34,360
We're kinda pressed for time.

340
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:38,490
Yeah,we thought we'd just put her
in the family plot back in omaha.

341
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,750
You can't do that.

342
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:42,120
Ida wanted her ashes
scattered at the field.

343
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:46,510
Yeah,I know,but that's
kinda crazy,don't you think?

344
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,720
It doesn't matter.

345
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:48,990
She was an amazing woman.

346
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,740
You should respect her wishes.

347
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,720
We should get going.

348
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,370
Hey,I-if you don't have
time to do it,I will.

349
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,800
Uh,you know,you're not family,so I
think that would be inappropriate.

350
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,390
Look,you're taking her pearls.

351
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,670
The least you can do
is honor her wishes.

352
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,780
Okay,at the risk of being bitchy,

353
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:10,090
this is none of your business,
so could you please just drop it?

354
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,490
Fine.

355
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:14,980
And for what it's worth,you
passed bitchy ten minutes ago.

356
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:18,990
Carter,get the urn. I
wanna get outta here.

357
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:23,700
Wait!

358
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,600
You'll never find it
I'll get it for you.

359
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,880
By the way,I'm staying at
ida's house for a while since,

360
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:04,710
you know,my house is a pile of rubble.

361
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,300
Oh,that's so sad.

362
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,230
You've got a week.

363
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,870
Here you go.

364
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:14,800
Thanks.

365
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,560
just put it in the cup holR.

366
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:27,640
Excuse me.

367
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,410
Are you al's wife?

368
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,910
I'm gabrielle lang.

369
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:32,390
You're the mayor's wife.

370
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,660
Of course I recognize you.

371
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:37,920
So I was shocked to hear about al.

372
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:41,680
I can't remember the last
time I was so devastated.

373
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:44,840
Didn't you just bury
your husband yesterday?

374
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:47,630
That sucked,too.

375
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:50,500
So what happened to al?

376
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,310
he was driving home,trying
to beat the storm,

377
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,030
and he ran into a downed power line...

378
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,190
and his car burst into flames.

379
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,680
Oh,sweetie,don'T.

380
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:07,380
I want you to remember al
like I do-- at his desk,

381
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:13,480
with a big smile on his
face,surrounded by all his files.

382
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:16,550
by the way,where are those files?

383
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,140
I cleared out his office.

384
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:21,110
Oh,I bet that was hard.

385
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,970
so where'd you put 'em?

386
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:25,810
In the garage.

387
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:27,370
Which is...

388
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,640
in the back.

389
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:34,160
well,look at me,monopolizing the widow.

390
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,160
You go mingle.

391
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:37,510
I'm gonna get you a cracker.

392
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,410
oh,crap.

393
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:40,110
Why do people have to die?!

394
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,390
Why,god?! Why?

395
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:45,020
Why? Why? Why? Why?

396
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,830
Oh,ank you so much for letting
us take over your dining room.

397
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:51,120
Please. Thank you for making us dinner.

398
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,130
Oh,you will be sending up dessert later?

399
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:56,830
Oh,sure. Just,uh,leave your trays
in the hall when you're ready.

400
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:06,390
- Puff pastry?
- Thank you.

401
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:09,850
Oh,here is a nice 12-year-old
scotch to wash that down with.

402
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,330
Uh,look,it's nice of you
to invite me for dinner,

403
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:15,070
but if you're hoping to change
my mind about doing your roof,

404
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,810
I'm just-- I'm
really not up to it.

405
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,840
No. No,no,walter,

406
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:21,450
we--we just heard
about your situation

407
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:24,190
and thought you could use a
little company. That's all.

408
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:26,210
Yes,and a nice home-cooked meal.

409
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:29,820
Trust me,there are absolutely
no tricks up our sleeve.

410
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,000
Uh,I noticed there are
four place settings.

411
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,530
Is somebody joining us?

412
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:37,140
All right,I'm here.
What was so important?

413
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:44,090
What's going on?

414
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,790
I'm moving out.

415
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:49,650
It's been a little weird staying
in the guest room of my own house.

416
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,350
But I thought you and mom
were trying to work stuff out.

417
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,290
We are. It's just...

418
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,400
your mom thought it might be easier
if we gave ourselves a little distance.

419
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:00,740
Well,then why doesn't she move out?

420
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:02,710
- Dylan.
- I'm serious.

421
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:05,730
You can't leave me here
alone with her. I'll go crazy.

422
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:09,160
Hey,come onwe're gonna see
each other all the time.

423
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:12,320
Why does she always have to win?

424
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,430
Yeah,I'm thinking of
starting my trip in paris.

425
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:39,980
Todd and I talked about going there,

426
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,910
but now I'm thinking of doing it myself.

427
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:46,110
Walter recently split up
with his life partner todd.

428
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,600
They were gay.

429
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,380
Small world,huh?

430
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:50,960
How is it small,exactly?

431
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,370
Andrew is also an
out-and-proud homosexual.

432
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:58,180
He's here,he's queer,and
we're used to it.

433
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,810
Since when?

434
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:01,440
You know what else
you two have in common?

435
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,510
A love of boots.

436
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,970
Andrew has some beautiful boots.

437
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:09,160
Oh,I can only imagine the fun you
two would have in the boot shop.

438
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:15,700
Um,mom,I'm gonna take
these bowls to the kitchen.

439
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,160
Oh,thanks,dear.

440
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,620
With you.

441
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:22,410
What are you doing?

442
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:25,960
I'm just trying to stay out of the way
of all those sparks that are flying.

443
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,110
Sparks?

444
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,580
The man's twice my age.

445
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:33,010
Yes,but he's also-- he's
got a great sense of...

446
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:39,280
okay,do you know how hard it
is to get a good contractor?

447
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,600
Oh,my god!

448
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,530
And poor walter just
had his heart broken,

449
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:45,690
so if it takes you being nice to
him to get our house fixed,then...

450
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,570
you're--you're pimping
me out for a new roof?

451
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:49,630
And windows.

452
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,590
And I am not pimping you out.

453
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:57,460
I'm simply asking you to show some kindness to a
lonely man who happens to be an excellent roofer.

454
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:00,720
- Look,if by kindness you mean sex
- watch your mouth.

455
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,200
I would never suggest that.

456
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,400
You can raise a man's hopes
without satisfying them.

457
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,290
I've done it all my life.

458
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:13,410
andrew,I haveot to get back into
my house,and you're my only hope.

459
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,190
fine.

460
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:21,560
For you,I will flirt,I will
flatter,and I will charm.

461
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:23,160
bless you.

462
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:27,690
And in exchange,I expect
a 60-inch flat screen tv.

463
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:31,600
Fine,and if you can get him to
come in on time and under budget,

464
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,150
I'll throw in surround sound.

465
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,010
No.

466
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:45,040
That walter guy needs to stay miserable,

467
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,280
because if he's not,he'll fix
her roof,and then she'll leave us.

468
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,970
Mom,we always knew is
couldn't last forever,

469
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:52,360
and she'll still be
here another week or two.

470
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,690
That is not enough time.

471
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:55,740
She just started stenciling the kitchen,

472
00:29:55,740 --> 00:30:00,280
and i didn't want to tell you this,but
there is talk of an herb garden.

473
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,390
I've gotta stop her.

474
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:03,310
How?

475
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,400
I don't know,

476
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:08,570
but I've had a taste of ironed
pillowcases,and I am not going back.

477
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:14,970
oh,walter,you got a little right there.

478
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,520
Thank you.

479
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:19,310
Hey,everybody.

480
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:23,690
I'm sorry to interrupt,but the smell of
that apple pie just made my mouth water.

481
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:26,000
Well,say no more.One
slice coming right up.

482
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,330
Oh,susan delfino,this
is walter bierlich.

483
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:29,560
this is susan's house.

484
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,260
She's kind enough to take us in.

485
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,130
Hi.How are you?

486
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:33,680
All righty.Here you go.

487
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,380
Thanks.

488
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:42,820
oh.You're going to eat that...here?

489
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,910
Oh,I'm just gonna visit for a whE.

490
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:48,070
So,andrew,we miss you around here,

491
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:50,340
but I bet you love
having your own place.

492
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:53,030
Uh,yeah.It's--it's
cool.

493
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,730
Of--of course,it
does get lonely.

494
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:59,640
It'd be nice to have someone
stop by once in a while.

495
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,690
Oh,well,you'll reel somebody in.

496
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:03,320
You always do.

497
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,990
you should have seen his
last boyfriend--justin.

498
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:07,840
He was so hot.

499
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,620
You really had a thing for
the young,ripped musclboys,huh?

500
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:13,620
Um...

501
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:17,540
he did at one time,but
andrew's outgrown that.

502
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:20,230
He realized the folly
of being so shallow.

503
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:23,620
Exactly,and now,um,his tastes
have gone to the more mature,

504
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:27,320
cultured types,like,uh,walter here.

505
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:30,160
Oh!

506
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,260
This is a fix-up?

507
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,840
Well,I just--it never would
have occurred to me,you know,

508
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:39,390
because of the vast age difference.

509
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,590
But,hell.Why not?

510
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,610
Life is short.

511
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:44,900
Certainly shorter for walter.

512
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,440
Susan.

513
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,500
Oh,no,don't get me wrong.

514
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,040
I mean,I think it's great.

515
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,070
You should grab love
wherever you can find it.

516
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:54,600
Who cares if your friends
think that you're paying for it?

517
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,000
Oh,so why don't you take this
piece of pie upstairs to julie?

518
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,400
No,she's right.That's exactly
what my friends would think.

519
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,380
Well,then you need new friends.

520
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,250
Hey,listen.You know what?

521
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:04,440
You seem like a nice guy,

522
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,500
and it would be great to
parade you in front of my ex,

523
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,440
but,uh,then I'd be using you.

524
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,060
Well,he doesn't mind.

525
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:13,310
No,parade me.

526
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:17,390
he's got a mesh tank top that
would bring your ex to tears.

527
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:21,120
Yeah,well,you know,as
tempting as that sounds,

528
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,530
you know,I'm just not
ready to date,so...

529
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:28,370
thank you so much for the dinner.

530
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,490
walter,wait!

531
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:35,300
well,I guess I'll just
bring this pie up to julie.

532
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,440
You.

533
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,620
Sit.

534
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,880
so is someone meeting us here or what?

535
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,240
Well,here's the thing.I called
the general manager to ask

536
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,880
if we could scatter the ashes
here,and he said absolutely not.

537
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:58,680
So how are we getting in?

538
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:00,530
Oh,lynette.

539
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:01,830
Hey,you've abetted.

540
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:03,920
Might as well aid.

541
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:12,560
Leave us.

542
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:26,870
Okay,I know that it sounds selfish,but I
did what I did because I want you to stay.

543
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:28,900
why?

544
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,530
I-I thought you'd want your house back.

545
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:33,490
Well,yeah,sure,someday,

546
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:36,000
but right now I just love
having you take care of me.

547
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,750
All the cooking and the
cleaning and the alphabetizing...

548
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:47,400
it's helping me feel like I'm
not just about to fall apart.

549
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,840
Oh,sweetie,you're okay.

550
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,300
No.

551
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,250
I'm pregnant,

552
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:56,730
and my husband's in rehab,

553
00:33:56,730 --> 00:34:01,030
and the only reason I seem
sane is because you're here,

554
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:04,110
making my house feel like a home.

555
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:16,750
This is a conversation that could benefit
from some homemade chocolate chip cookies.

556
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:20,680
Can I have milk,too?

557
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:23,340
I'll be right back.

558
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:33,920
do you maybe want to
say something first?

559
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,860
Oh,uh,yeah,I guess so.

560
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,270
Oh.

561
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:40,860
um...

562
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:44,640
"do not stand at my grave and weep."

563
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,380
Um,"I'm--I'm
not there.

564
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,170
I do not sleep.

565
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:51,170
"I am a thousand winds that blow.I am...

566
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:53,860
the diamond glints of snow."

567
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:59,090
"I am the sunlight on ripened grain.

568
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:03,730
I am the gentle autumn's rain."

569
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:09,800
"Do not stand at my grave and cry.

570
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,390
I am not there.

571
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:14,140
I did not die."

572
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,390
That was lovely.

573
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,830
Let's dump her.

574
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,740
And try not to stand downwind.

575
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:24,800
She played third be,right?

576
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,610
- Right.
- Right,right,right.

577
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,730
Oh,my goodness.

578
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,600
Wait.Uh,sorry.

579
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,930
Shortstop.

580
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:36,050
Oh,yeah.

581
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:39,570
Okay.

582
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,190
No,it was third.

583
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:43,250
Damn it,karen.

584
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:46,030
I'm running out of ida.

585
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:54,840
okay,don't move!

586
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:58,410
Stay right where you are
and show me your hands.

587
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,840
okay,split up,and I'll
meet you back at the car.

588
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,980
Go!

589
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,010
Hey,hey!

590
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:06,370
Right there!

591
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:07,290
Oh!

592
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:10,330
Lady,get back here!

593
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:12,430
Come on.Come on.

594
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:13,670
Uhh!Come on!

595
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,710
- Run,jane doe,run!
- Just grab her!

596
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:18,770
- Hey,stop,hey!
- I got her.

597
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,620
Come on.

598
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:32,320
so when I finally came clean,

599
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,560
his wife told me she shredded anything
that had to do with offshore accounts.

600
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,620
She was protecting al.

601
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,960
so we're broke.

602
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:45,930
I'm so sorry,honey.

603
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:49,320
I-I know this is bad,but
we have each other.

604
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:53,730
We'll get married again,and
everything will be fine.

605
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:56,130
For richer,for poorer,right?

606
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,200
In sickness and in health.

607
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:07,410
The whole nine yards.

608
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:19,660
I'm gonna go down to the cafeteria anget us
a couple of ginger ales to toast our future.

609
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,750
Hey,doctor.

610
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:23,850
He's looking better
and better every day.

611
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:26,140
Keep up the good work.

612
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:32,560
You haven't told her yet,have you?

613
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,630
I'm working on it.

614
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:39,580
Carlos,I know you're
scared,but give her some credit.

615
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:42,930
She's not gonna leave you
because you lost your sight.

616
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:48,340
You don't know gaby.

617
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,430
thank god those cops let
us off with a warning.

618
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:59,330
I was this close to my third strike.

619
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:05,060
I'm just glad we gave
ida what she wanted.

620
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:07,020
It's a beautiful thing you did.

621
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,830
then why don't i feel better?

622
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:11,250
I don't know.

623
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:12,160
Why don't you?

624
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:17,080
Because it wasn't enough,not
compared to what she did for me.

625
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:20,130
She saved my kids.

626
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:23,350
She's this amazing woman,and I
never bothered to get to know her,

627
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:25,540
so,yeah,I sprinkled her ashes,

628
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:30,050
but it would have been nice to
do something before she was ashes.

629
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,490
That's a lesson we all
gotta learn over and over--

630
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:36,200
appreciate people
while we still got 'em.

631
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,250
Yep.

632
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:45,150
Third strike?

633
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:47,320
What were the first two?

634
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,150
it's a long story.

635
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:52,670
That requires a pitcher
of beer and a dark bar.

636
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:55,290
I got time for that.

637
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:09,870
What are you still doing here?

638
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:12,070
I thought you found a motel room.

639
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:16,550
I did,but I wanted to set
something straight before I go.

640
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:21,130
I'm not leaving because you want me to.

641
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:24,150
I'm leaving because
I'm walking out on you.

642
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:27,530
Oh,is that how we're gonna play this?

643
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:29,160
Fine.Whatever.

644
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,130
You're leaving me.

645
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:33,240
Oh,yeah,and here's why.

646
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,960
You blamed what happened
on your ex-husband,

647
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,540
and I believed you.

648
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,760
You told me it was all his fault,

649
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,460
and now I find out it was yours.

650
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:51,090
We're about even in the
betrayal department now.

651
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,580
In fact...

652
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:56,130
I think you win.

653
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:36,040
it had been seven days since a
tornado devastated wisteria lane,

654
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:42,550
and the residents continued to
pick up the pieces of their lives.

655
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:47,090
Some salvaged precious friendships.

656
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:52,140
Some uncovered colorful histories.

657
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:58,370
Others found challenges
they hadn't expected.

658
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:06,420
And then...

659
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,800
there was one girl...

660
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:17,320
who stumbled upon the truth
she'd long been searching for...

661
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,380
only...

662
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:22,460
to wish she hadn'T.
