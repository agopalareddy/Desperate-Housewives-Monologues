1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,738
<I>Previously On...</I>

2
00:00:02,738 --> 00:00:05,487
<I>Adam Was Finished
With Katherine...</I>

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:09,831
<I>Please Get Rid Of That Gum.
But Dylan's Father Came Back.</I>

4
00:00:09,831 --> 00:00:11,237
Bye, Sweetheart.
Bye, Dad.

5
00:00:11,237 --> 00:00:13,863
I Tricked You Into
Thinking Dylan Was Yours.

6
00:00:14,656 --> 00:00:16,862
I Finished That D.N.A.
You Wanted, And Your Suspect's

7
00:00:16,862 --> 00:00:18,562
Not Related
To The Victim At All.

8
00:00:18,595 --> 00:00:21,328
<I>Gaby And Carlos Were Forced
To Go To The Police.</I>

9
00:00:21,361 --> 00:00:25,728
Are You Sure It Was Cocaine? Carlos, I Was
A Fashion Model In The '90s. I Know Cocaine.

10
00:00:25,762 --> 00:00:28,528
<I>Just Give Me What I Want...
And Lynette...</I>

11
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:30,662
Or You're Not
Gonna Like What Happens.

12
00:00:30,695 --> 00:00:33,728
<I>...Was Pushed
To Her Breaking Point.</I>

13
00:00:36,728 --> 00:00:39,628
<I>Coffee Mugs To The Contrary,</I>

14
00:00:39,662 --> 00:00:41,378
<I>Lynette Scavo Knew</I>

15
00:00:41,378 --> 00:00:44,695
<I>That She Was Not
The World's Greatest Mother.</I>

16
00:00:45,203 --> 00:00:47,695
<I>In Fact,
When It Came To Parenting,</I>

17
00:00:47,728 --> 00:00:51,562
<I>Lynette Had Done Many Things
She Was Not Proud Of...</I>

18
00:00:53,175 --> 00:00:55,940
<I>Like The Time
When She Offered Parker Cash</I>

19
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,361
<I>If He Agreed
To Eat All Of His Spinach...</I>

20
00:00:59,488 --> 00:01:00,863
<I>Or When She Told The Twins</I>

21
00:01:00,863 --> 00:01:03,999
<I>There Was Treasure
Buried Beneath The Weeds...</I>

22
00:01:05,228 --> 00:01:09,112
<I>Or When She Gave Her Kids
A Little Extra Cough Syrup</I>

23
00:01:09,112 --> 00:01:11,222
<I>So She Could Finish Her Novel.</I>

24
00:01:12,029 --> 00:01:14,828
<I>But Despite These Lapses...</I>

25
00:01:14,862 --> 00:01:17,362
<I>Lynette Didn't Think Of Herself</I>

26
00:01:17,362 --> 00:01:19,363
<I>As The Worst Mother
In The World Either,</I>

27
00:01:20,188 --> 00:01:22,675
<I>Until One Horrible Day.</I>

28
00:01:22,675 --> 00:01:24,762
<I>Since When
Do You Make Waffles?</I>

29
00:01:24,795 --> 00:01:26,800
Well, Kayla Loves Waffles,

30
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,929
And Since She And I Have Been
Having Some Problems Lately,

31
00:01:28,962 --> 00:01:31,695
I Wanted To Do
Something Nice For Her.

32
00:01:31,728 --> 00:01:34,695
Oh, You Tell Kayla
Her Breakfast Is Ready.

33
00:01:36,328 --> 00:01:38,695
Hi.
My Name Is Fern Parrish.

34
00:01:38,728 --> 00:01:40,762
This Is My Colleague,
Irene Semanis.

35
00:01:40,795 --> 00:01:44,331
We're From C.P.S. Uh, One
Sec. Preston, You Might Wanna

36
00:01:44,331 --> 00:01:45,987
Stop Dropping Your Waffle
On The Floor,

37
00:01:45,987 --> 00:01:48,238
'Cause I'm Still
Gonna Make You Eat It.

38
00:01:48,929 --> 00:01:51,862
So, Uh, What's C.P.S.?

39
00:01:51,895 --> 00:01:53,828
Children's
Protective Services.

40
00:01:55,363 --> 00:01:57,862
For What It's Worth, I Keep
My Floors Incredibly Clean.

41
00:01:57,895 --> 00:02:00,300
Mrs. Scavo,
We Recently Received

42
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,925
A Report Of Some Abuse
In Your Home.

43
00:02:01,925 --> 00:02:04,863
Abuse? That's Ridiculous.

44
00:02:04,863 --> 00:02:08,113
Well, We Got A Call
From A Dr. Joshua Dolan?

45
00:02:08,113 --> 00:02:10,228
It Seems He Was Contacted
By Your Daughter Kayla.

46
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:13,261
Who Says You Hit Her...
Repeatedly.

47
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:16,361
Okay...

48
00:02:17,487 --> 00:02:19,660
First,
I'm Not That Kind Of Mom.

49
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,461
And Second,

50
00:02:20,495 --> 00:02:24,261
Kayla Has A Tendency
To... Exaggerate.

51
00:02:24,295 --> 00:02:27,395
We Also Have A Security Tape
From A Clothing Store.

52
00:02:27,428 --> 00:02:30,795
It Shows You Slapping
A Young Girl Across The Face.

53
00:02:31,925 --> 00:02:33,662
We're Assuming That's Kayla.

54
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,800
Have A Seat.
I'll Be With You In A Second.

55
00:02:45,112 --> 00:02:49,795
<I>Yes, Lynette Scavo Was Not
The World's Greatest Mother.</I>

56
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,361
<I>But In Her Heart,</I>

57
00:02:52,395 --> 00:02:55,895
<I>She Knew She Had Done
The Best She Could...</I>

58
00:02:57,191 --> 00:02:58,261
<I>Given...</I>

59
00:02:58,295 --> 00:03:01,495
<I>What She Had To Work With.</I>

00:03:16,316 --> 00:03:19,962
<I>It's How The French Describe
"A Pretty One."</I>

<I>"Katherine"-</I>

<I>"Bree"-</I>

70
00:03:35,094 --> 00:03:38,962
<I>It's An Irish Name
That Means "Power."</I>

71
00:03:39,894 --> 00:03:41,228
<I>Indeed...</I>

72
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:45,528
<I>Every Name Has
A Single Specific Meaning...</I>

73
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:51,581
<I>Which Is Why Parents
Have Trouble Choosing One</I>

74
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:55,128
<I>For Someone
Who Means Everything To Them.</I>

75
00:03:55,161 --> 00:03:57,061
What About "Philip"?
I Like "Philip."

76
00:03:57,094 --> 00:03:59,128
Oh, I Know You Do.

77
00:03:59,161 --> 00:04:00,995
I Don't,
And Neither Does The Baby.

78
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,228
Philip? Oh, Phil?

79
00:04:03,261 --> 00:04:05,728
See? Nothing.
Not Even A Burp.

80
00:04:05,762 --> 00:04:07,695
Here's A Thought.

81
00:04:07,728 --> 00:04:10,628
How About "Nathaniel"? All
Right, That's The Fourth Time

82
00:04:10,662 --> 00:04:12,566
You've Tried To Sneak
"Nathaniel" Past Me.

83
00:04:12,566 --> 00:04:17,395
I'm Putting "Peyton" Back On The Table. I
Am Not Naming My Son After A Quarterback.

84
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,962
All Right,
Here's The Rest Of My List.

85
00:04:19,995 --> 00:04:22,795
Lucas.
It Sounds Like "Mucus."

86
00:04:22,828 --> 00:04:25,113
Mitchum.
Like The Deodorant?

87
00:04:25,862 --> 00:04:26,495
Unitas.

88
00:04:26,528 --> 00:04:28,237
Oh, Give Me That.

89
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:32,361
Well,
We Need New Inspiration.

90
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:34,728
Ooh.

91
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:35,995
Riley.

92
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:37,995
I Like It. Who Is He?

93
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:40,194
He's A Guy Who...

94
00:04:40,228 --> 00:04:42,706
"Killed Six, Then Self."

95
00:04:44,795 --> 00:04:46,695
Well, I Give Up.

96
00:04:46,728 --> 00:04:49,662
He's Not Gonna Get A Name.
When We Want Him To Come,

97
00:04:49,695 --> 00:04:51,962
We'll Just Whistle And Say,
"Here, Boy."

98
00:04:51,995 --> 00:04:54,925
<I>Dr. Conner.
Paging Dr. Conner.</I>

99
00:04:54,925 --> 00:04:57,094
<I>Please Call Admitting.
Conner.</I>

100
00:04:57,128 --> 00:04:58,925
I Love It.

101
00:04:58,925 --> 00:05:01,112
Me, Too.

102
00:05:01,828 --> 00:05:04,595
Oh,
You Finally Have A Name.

103
00:05:04,628 --> 00:05:07,161
Dr. Conner Delfino.

104
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,737
Oh, Hey.
I'm Going Out To The Mall.

105
00:05:12,737 --> 00:05:13,495
You Wanna Come With?

106
00:05:13,528 --> 00:05:14,728
Oh, No, Thanks.

107
00:05:14,762 --> 00:05:17,361
I Gotta Make Sure My Handyman
Gets His Wiring Done.

108
00:05:17,395 --> 00:05:19,175
He Screwed It Up
The Last Time.

109
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,495
You Realize
We Could've Had A Fire?

110
00:05:22,528 --> 00:05:23,828
Sorry, Mrs. Solis.

111
00:05:24,753 --> 00:05:26,662
All Right, Then.
See You Later.

112
00:05:31,895 --> 00:05:34,706
And... She's Gone.

113
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,562
Great.
Let's Break Into Her Room.

114
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:42,862
As Soon I Finish This,

115
00:05:42,862 --> 00:05:44,728
I'll Start Placing Bugs
In The Other Rooms.

116
00:05:44,762 --> 00:05:46,628
Well,
Isn't Her Room Enough?

117
00:05:46,662 --> 00:05:49,595
She Has A Prepaid Cell Phone,
So We Can't Tap It.

118
00:05:49,628 --> 00:05:51,300
Our Only Hope
At Nailing Her Supplier

119
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,237
Is To Record Every Conversation
She Has In This House.

120
00:05:54,237 --> 00:05:58,261
Well, How Long Is That Gonna Take? We Got A
Tip That She's Expecting A Delivery This Week.

121
00:05:58,295 --> 00:06:00,999
So It Won't Be Long Before
Miss Leonard Learns The Joys

122
00:06:00,999 --> 00:06:04,094
Of A Little Girl-On-Girl Action
In A Prison Shower.

123
00:06:04,953 --> 00:06:06,816
Okay, First Of All,
You're A Pig.

124
00:06:06,816 --> 00:06:09,613
Second Of All, Don't Say Things
Like That. Ellie's My Friend.

125
00:06:09,613 --> 00:06:12,862
Yeah, Well, Your Friend Is
A Drug Dealer, I. E., Scum.

126
00:06:13,191 --> 00:06:15,328
Hey!
You Don't Even Know Her.

127
00:06:15,361 --> 00:06:18,050
Okay, Yes,
She's Made Some Bad Choices,

128
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,815
But Deep Down,
She's A Good Person.

129
00:06:19,815 --> 00:06:22,565
Yeah, Well, Deep Down,
I Hope She Rots In Jail.

130
00:06:22,565 --> 00:06:23,999
Okay,
When This Thing Is Over,

131
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,253
Let's Not Do The Whole
Christmas Card Thing.

132
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:30,795
Is That Your Husband?
No, He's At Braille School.

133
00:06:37,425 --> 00:06:37,962
Gaby?

134
00:06:37,995 --> 00:06:40,662
Oh, Ellie! Hey!

135
00:06:40,695 --> 00:06:43,128
What The Hell Are You
Doing In My Room?!

136
00:06:43,128 --> 00:06:46,175
We Weren't Expecting You Back
So Soon. I Forgot My Wallet.

137
00:06:46,175 --> 00:06:47,987
Again,What The Hell
Are You Doing In My Room?

138
00:06:47,987 --> 00:06:52,528
Well, We Needed Some Privacy.
See, Roy And I Are Lovers.

139
00:06:54,194 --> 00:06:55,925
You're Having An Affair
With Your Handyman?

140
00:06:55,925 --> 00:06:59,295
I Know, It's Crazy. You Wouldn't
Believe The Passion.

141
00:06:59,328 --> 00:07:02,925
I Mean,
I Was Powerless To Resist.

142
00:07:03,795 --> 00:07:05,728
Just-
Just Get Out Of My Room.

143
00:07:05,762 --> 00:07:08,295
Okay, Okay. We're Going.

144
00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:16,161
That's For
Using Your Tongue.

145
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,628
Lots Of People
Do Missionary Work,

146
00:07:20,628 --> 00:07:23,762
But Few Have The Guts To Smuggle
Bibles Into North Korea.

147
00:07:23,795 --> 00:07:25,362
It Is My Distinct Pleasure

148
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:28,495
To Welcome Back,
After Four Long Years-

149
00:07:28,528 --> 00:07:29,728
Reverend Michael Green.

150
00:07:33,762 --> 00:07:36,695
Thank You For That
Glorious Introduction, Joe.

151
00:07:36,728 --> 00:07:40,161
Well, It's Good To Be Back.
Now If You'll All Please Stand

152
00:07:40,194 --> 00:07:43,194
And Offer Each Other
The Lord's Peace.

153
00:07:47,728 --> 00:07:49,695
Peace Be With You, Bree.

154
00:07:49,728 --> 00:07:52,895
I Reject Your Peace, And I
Demand You Stop Stalking Me.

155
00:07:52,929 --> 00:07:54,999
I'm Doing No Such Thing.

156
00:07:54,999 --> 00:07:57,300
Really? So I Just Happen To Run
Into You At The Dry Cleaner,

157
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,456
The Greengrocer, The Post
Office? We Shared A Life Together.

158
00:08:00,456 --> 00:08:04,237
It's Only Natural We'd Frequent The Same
Places. Oh, Please. I Saw You At My Nail Salon.

159
00:08:04,237 --> 00:08:06,112
There's Nothing In The Bible
That Says A Man

160
00:08:06,112 --> 00:08:11,061
Can't Enjoy A Nice Pedicure. Orson,
Hear Me When I Say This. It's Over.

161
00:08:11,972 --> 00:08:13,728
You Have Done
Unconscionable Things

162
00:08:13,762 --> 00:08:15,628
For Which
I Can Never Forgive You,

163
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,831
And No Amount Of Flitting About
In My Peripheral Vision

164
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:21,175
Is Going To Change That. But
There Must Be Something I Can Do.

165
00:08:21,175 --> 00:08:24,113
You Know I've Repented.
We-We Can Get Past This.

166
00:08:24,113 --> 00:08:26,295
I Know
No Such Thing. Now Be Quiet.

167
00:08:26,328 --> 00:08:27,300
I'm Done Talking To You.

168
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,461
Bree, So Nice To See You Again.
Peace Be With You.

169
00:08:31,495 --> 00:08:33,194
And Also With You.

170
00:08:33,228 --> 00:08:35,662
Do Not Give This Man Peace.

171
00:08:40,238 --> 00:08:43,550
You Shouldn't Keep
Your Doors Unlocked, Kathy.

172
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,929
Why Do You Think They Call 'Em
"Crimes Of Opportunity"?

173
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,261
What Do You Want?

174
00:08:54,695 --> 00:08:58,362
Dylan Used To Have
A Big Old Scar Right Here,

175
00:08:58,362 --> 00:08:59,528
And Now It's Gone.

176
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:01,728
I'm Just Curious

177
00:09:02,738 --> 00:09:05,029
How You Would Explain That.

178
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,128
Never Too Early
To Start Drinking, Is It?

179
00:09:09,128 --> 00:09:12,300
She Fell Off Her Bike.
11 Stitches. I Remember.

180
00:09:15,999 --> 00:09:19,362
I Took Her To A Plastic Surgeon
In Chicago

181
00:09:19,362 --> 00:09:21,863
'Cause I Didn't Want Her
To Feel Self-Conscious.

182
00:09:21,863 --> 00:09:24,175
Well,
That's Pretty Convenient.

183
00:09:24,688 --> 00:09:26,194
What Are You Suggesting,
Wayne?

184
00:09:26,228 --> 00:09:28,061
Something's Not Right.

185
00:09:28,094 --> 00:09:30,995
I Felt It From The Moment
That I Laid Eyes On Her.

186
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:34,795
I Just Don't See Myself
In Her At All.

187
00:09:34,828 --> 00:09:36,962
I Told You.
She's Not Yours.

188
00:09:36,995 --> 00:09:40,628
<I>Yeah, But I Don't See You
In Her Either.</I>

189
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,295
So...

190
00:09:44,394 --> 00:09:46,094
Let's Just Settle This
Once And For All.

191
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:50,428
Take A D.N.A. Test. All I Need
Is One Strand Of Hair.

192
00:09:50,461 --> 00:09:52,728
Knock, Knock.
Is This A Bad Time?

193
00:09:53,504 --> 00:09:56,728
No, Not At All.
Great, Because We Are Here

194
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,753
To Throw Ourselves
On Your Mercy.

195
00:09:58,753 --> 00:10:00,738
We Are Having A Commitment
Ceremony In Five Days,

196
00:10:00,738 --> 00:10:03,728
And Our Caterer Just Canceled.
We Know It's Short Notice.

197
00:10:03,762 --> 00:10:07,495
Totally Understand If You Say
No. Nonsense. I'd Love To Do It.

198
00:10:07,925 --> 00:10:10,361
Why Don't You Have A Seat,
And We'll Talk Details?

199
00:10:12,206 --> 00:10:14,828
I'm Sorry. If... You're Busy,
We Can Come Back Later.

200
00:10:14,862 --> 00:10:17,962
No, No. No, That's Okay.
You Stay.

201
00:10:17,995 --> 00:10:20,295
<I>I'll Come Back Later.</I>

202
00:10:24,612 --> 00:10:25,461
Lynette, I'm Sorry.

203
00:10:25,495 --> 00:10:27,895
When I'm Told About
A Suspected Case Of Child Abuse,

204
00:10:27,929 --> 00:10:29,862
I Am Bound By Law
To Report It.

205
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:31,828
Okay, So What Happens Now?

206
00:10:31,862 --> 00:10:34,995
I'm Just Trying To Help C.P.S.
Finish Their Investigation.

207
00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:37,862
They'll Interview Your Kids,
Their Teachers,

208
00:10:37,895 --> 00:10:39,728
Possibly
Some Of Your Neighbors.

209
00:10:39,762 --> 00:10:43,562
My Neighbors? God!
I Could Strangle That Girl.

210
00:10:43,595 --> 00:10:46,487
Honey, You Might Wanna Stop
Saying Things Like That.

211
00:10:46,487 --> 00:10:49,695
Look, For The Next Few Days,
Let Tom Handle The Kids.

212
00:10:49,728 --> 00:10:52,194
Any Other Problems
Between You And Kayla

213
00:10:52,228 --> 00:10:54,962
Could Jeopardize Custody
Of All Your Children.

214
00:10:54,995 --> 00:10:58,238
Wait. They Could Take
My Children?

215
00:10:58,238 --> 00:11:00,962
No One's Taking Anyone. You
Have Got To Be Kidding Me!

216
00:11:00,995 --> 00:11:02,675
This Is All
A Big Misunderstanding.

217
00:11:02,675 --> 00:11:06,862
I'm Sure That We Can Work This Out. So
What Do I Need To Do To Keep My Kids?

218
00:11:06,895 --> 00:11:09,995
Well, There Are
A Lot Of Things You Can Do.

219
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:11,828
First,
No Physical Discipline...

220
00:11:30,953 --> 00:11:32,113
♪♪♪

221
00:11:32,113 --> 00:11:34,253
Of The Onion
And White Asparagus Tart.

222
00:11:34,253 --> 00:11:36,315
Wonderful!
With A Little Goat Cheese.

223
00:11:36,315 --> 00:11:39,300
Oh, And Lee Asked
For Stuffed Mushrooms.

224
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:43,495
Those With Roasted Green Beans
As Our Side Dishes.

225
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:48,295
Nice Tight Grouping.
You Are Not Rusty At All.

226
00:11:48,328 --> 00:11:50,994
Thank You. Felt Good.

227
00:11:51,028 --> 00:11:53,328
Although I Always, Uh,
Like A Trip To The Range,

228
00:11:53,361 --> 00:11:55,941
Is There Any Particular Reason
We Came Here For Party Planning?

229
00:11:55,941 --> 00:11:57,238
Well, With Adam Gone,

230
00:11:57,238 --> 00:12:00,661
I've Just Been Feeling
A Little... Uneasy Lately.

231
00:12:00,694 --> 00:12:01,800
It's Funny How
Having A Man In The House

232
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,988
Can Make You Feel Safer,

233
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:06,300
No Matter How Retiring
Or Easily Spooked He Might Be.

234
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,925
That's True. I Just Need To Feel
That If An Intruder Broke In,

235
00:12:09,925 --> 00:12:13,994
I Could Take Care Of It...
Effectively.

236
00:12:14,028 --> 00:12:16,462
You Really Want
To Be Effective?

237
00:12:16,495 --> 00:12:18,050
Try Hollow Points.

238
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:20,800
These Rounds You've Got
Punch Straight Though,

239
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,161
But A Hollow Point
Blooms On Impact,

240
00:12:23,195 --> 00:12:25,862
Cuts The Body To Shreds
From The Inside.

241
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,737
Sounds Exactly
Like What I Need.

242
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:34,441
Now...

243
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,878
Let's Talk Desserts.

244
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,362
???????My Grandie Died.

245
00:12:47,362 --> 00:12:50,581
Oh, Som So Sorry.

246
00:12:50,581 --> 00:12:53,050
I Know

But Ud, Ih, Lik Like Toeam
R Our Son After Ra Grandfather

250
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:02,613
Oh.

251
00:13:02,613 --> 00:13:05,425
Well, Yeah, Um,

252
00:13:05,425 --> 00:13:08,988
I Mean, "Conner" ????

253
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:12,228
This Would Mean Something.
So You're Okay With This?

254
00:13:12,261 --> 00:13:15,253
I Think It's A Beautiful Way
To Honor Your Grandfather.

255
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,894
I Mean, "James" Wouldn't
Be My First Choice,

256
00:13:16,894 --> 00:13:19,363
But It's A Good, Solid Name.

257
00:13:19,363 --> 00:13:21,112
No, Grandpa James Is
My Dad's Dad.

258
00:13:21,112 --> 00:13:23,410
This Is My Mom's-Maynard.

259
00:13:24,812 --> 00:13:26,816
Oh, Right. Maynard.

260
00:13:29,453 --> 00:13:31,175
Oh, That's Awful...

261
00:13:31,175 --> 00:13:33,269
That He Died. Why Didn't
We Think Of This Before?

262
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:35,487
It's Such
A Beautiful Southern Name.

263
00:13:35,487 --> 00:13:38,238
Oh, And Rare,

264
00:13:38,238 --> 00:13:39,737
Really Rare.

265
00:13:39,737 --> 00:13:42,738
And You're Right. It's A Great
Way To Honor My Grandfather.

266
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,425
Yeah.

267
00:13:44,737 --> 00:13:46,378
I Said That, Didn't I?

268
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:50,238
Oh, Shoot. We Can't Do It.
Isn't Your Grandpa James

269
00:13:50,238 --> 00:13:52,173
Significantly Older
Than Grandpa Maynard?

270
00:13:52,205 --> 00:13:53,612
Shouldn't We Honor Him
First?

271
00:13:53,612 --> 00:13:56,613
But Grandpa James
Isn't Dead.

272
00:13:56,613 --> 00:13:59,073
You Sure?
It's Worth A Phone Call.

273
00:13:59,106 --> 00:14:00,893
Actually, I've Got A Cousin
Who's Named After Him Already,

274
00:14:00,893 --> 00:14:02,503
So We're Covered.

275
00:14:03,487 --> 00:14:06,675
Thank You, Susan.
This Really Means A Lot.

276
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:08,362
I'm Gonna Go Call My Mom.

277
00:14:10,422 --> 00:14:11,550
Oh.

278
00:14:12,813 --> 00:14:13,925
Forgive Me.

279
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:17,999
Don't Look At Me Like That.
His Grandfather Just Died.

280
00:14:21,173 --> 00:14:23,539
Hey! Lunch Is Almost Ready.

281
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:26,238
I'm Making Your Favorite.

282
00:14:30,441 --> 00:14:31,872
I Take It
You're Still Mad At Me.

283
00:14:31,906 --> 00:14:35,405
Well, Yeah. I Just Don't Get
Why You Broke Into My Room.

284
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:38,006
<I>Well, I Couldn't Risk
Doing It In My Room.</I>

285
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:39,363
Ever Since Carlos Went Blind,

286
00:14:39,363 --> 00:14:41,691
He's Developed
A Strong Sense Of Smell.

287
00:14:41,691 --> 00:14:43,112
I Don't Know If You Happened
To Catch A Whiff Of Roy,

288
00:14:43,112 --> 00:14:45,613
But That Is
One Telltale Odor.

289
00:14:45,613 --> 00:14:47,879
Well, That's Another Thing,
You Know?

290
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:49,878
What Do You See In That Guy?

291
00:14:51,305 --> 00:14:54,272
Uh, You Know,
He's A Handyman.

292
00:14:54,305 --> 00:14:56,039
He Knows How To...

293
00:14:56,073 --> 00:14:59,073
Get In There...
And Make Stuff Work.

294
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:00,839
But He's A Zero,

295
00:15:00,872 --> 00:15:02,806
And Carlos Is So Fantastic.

296
00:15:03,629 --> 00:15:04,906
Don't You Love Him?

297
00:15:04,939 --> 00:15:06,472
Of Course I Do.

298
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:08,906
Carlos Solis
Is The Love Of My Life.

299
00:15:11,284 --> 00:15:13,739
But, You Know,
Sometimes You Get Bored,

300
00:15:13,772 --> 00:15:17,906
And A Big, Greasy,
Disgusting Handyman

301
00:15:17,939 --> 00:15:19,739
Really Hits The Spot.

302
00:15:34,872 --> 00:15:37,972
Adam, What The-
You Scared Me Half To Death.

303
00:15:38,006 --> 00:15:39,987
Sorry. I Let Myself In.

304
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:43,237
Why?

305
00:15:43,237 --> 00:15:46,238
Dylan Told Me Wayne's Back.

306
00:15:46,238 --> 00:15:48,238
Why Didn't You Call Me?
Because I'm Handling It.

307
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:49,872
Yeah, She Told Me About
The Shooting Range, Too.

308
00:15:49,906 --> 00:15:51,613
You Sure That's
The Best Way To Handle It?

309
00:15:51,613 --> 00:15:55,372
Adam, You Made It Very Clear
That You Were Done With Me.

310
00:15:55,405 --> 00:15:57,190
But I'm Not Done With Dylan,

311
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,503
And If Wayne's Back,
Then I'm Gonna Protect Her.

312
00:15:59,503 --> 00:16:02,800
So Maybe I Should Pay Him
A Little Visit, Scare Him Off.

313
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:06,972
If You'd Ever Met Wayne,
You'd Know Better.

314
00:16:08,487 --> 00:16:10,006
Well, Then
Let's Get Dylan Out Of Town.

315
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:12,405
I Tried.
She Said She's Not Leaving.

316
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:16,505
Well, I...

317
00:16:16,539 --> 00:16:18,572
I Promised Her
A Trip For Graduation,

318
00:16:18,605 --> 00:16:22,272
Just The Three Of Us,
Anywhere She Wanted To Go.

319
00:16:22,305 --> 00:16:26,237
Okay. But What Happens
When The Trip's Over?

320
00:16:26,425 --> 00:16:28,106
Won't We Just Be
At Square One Again?

321
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,872
Not If We Don't Come Back.

322
00:16:34,362 --> 00:16:36,039
Oh, Susan. He's Adorable.

323
00:16:36,073 --> 00:16:38,738
He's So Precious.
So It's Been Two Days Now.

324
00:16:38,738 --> 00:16:41,425
Did You And Mike
Finally Land On A Name?

325
00:16:42,999 --> 00:16:43,872
Maynard.

326
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:51,393
Maynard?

327
00:16:52,338 --> 00:16:53,800
Wow. Interesting.

328
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,872
It Has
A Very Distinct Ring.

329
00:16:55,906 --> 00:16:57,972
Okay, Drop The Act, Ladies.
I Hate It, Too.

330
00:16:58,006 --> 00:17:01,675
Mike Insisted That We Name Him After
His Dead Grandfather. How Did He Die?

331
00:17:01,675 --> 00:17:04,806
Was He Beaten To Death 'Cause His Name
Was Maynard? I Know. It's Terrible,

332
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:08,300
But I Can't Change It Now.
Mike Was So Emotional About It.

333
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,737
Well, Then Appeal
To His Sense Of Reason,

334
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,565
Because The Name "Maynard"

335
00:17:11,565 --> 00:17:12,737
Doesn't Go
With The Name Of "Delfino."

336
00:17:12,737 --> 00:17:15,050
One Is German
And The Other Is Italian,

337
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:19,566
And We All Know What Happens When Those Folks Get
Together. Well, I'm Not Sure That The World War Ii Argument

338
00:17:19,566 --> 00:17:21,550
Is Gonna Fly. Come On.
You Have To Do Something.

339
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:25,050
I Mean, That Name Is Practically
Abusive. Yeah, Think About Your Son.

340
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:26,738
People Live Up
To The Names They're Given.

341
00:17:26,738 --> 00:17:28,800
If My Parents
Hadn't Named Me "Gabrielle,"

342
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,503
Who Knows If I'd Be This Pretty? I Guess
That's Why They Didn't Name You "Einstein."

343
00:17:32,503 --> 00:17:35,644
So Sarcastic, But What Would
You Expect From A "Lynette"?

344
00:17:35,862 --> 00:17:37,878
What? If Your Name
Was "Francesca,"

345
00:17:37,878 --> 00:17:38,999
You Wouldn't Have Time
For Sarcasm.

346
00:17:38,999 --> 00:17:45,006
You'd Be Too Busy Having Sex On A Vespa.
You're Right. My Son's Future Is At Stake.

347
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,550
I Have To Do Something. Maybe Not. We
Call Gabrielle "Gaby." I Mean, Perhaps

348
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:51,175
There's A Shortened Version Of
"Maynard" You Could Live With.

349
00:17:51,175 --> 00:17:54,300
Yeah. Which Says
"Kick My Ass" Less-

350
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,439
"May" Or "Nerd"?

351
00:18:04,878 --> 00:18:05,706
What's Going On?

352
00:18:05,706 --> 00:18:09,806
Lynette Scavo, I'm Placing You
Under Arrest. What? Why? Wh-For What?

353
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,106
Kayla Showed Us
The Burn Mark On Her Arm.

354
00:18:12,139 --> 00:18:15,139
Burn Mark? What Burn Mark? You See?
She Doesn't Know Anything About This.

355
00:18:15,173 --> 00:18:17,050
Okay, Sir. That's Enough. Now Please, If
We Could Just Go Back And Talk About This...

356
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:20,572
Sir, Enough! Ma'am, You're Gonna
Have To Come With Us. Oh! Tom.

357
00:18:20,605 --> 00:18:24,300
Okay, You Know What? I'm Gonna Go Call The Attorney.
I- Okay. Look, Look, I- I Will Come With You.

358
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,906
Please, Just Don't Handcuff Me In Front Of My
Children. Well, You Should Have Thought Of That

359
00:18:27,939 --> 00:18:31,300
<I>Before You Hurt One Of Them.
Lynette Scavo, You Have</I>

360
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,456
The Right To Remain Silent.
If You Give Up That Right,

361
00:18:33,456 --> 00:18:35,175
Anything You Say Can
And Will Be Used Against You

362
00:18:35,175 --> 00:18:36,378
In A Court Of Law.
You Have

363
00:18:36,378 --> 00:18:38,863
The Right To Have An Attorney
Present During Questioning.

364
00:18:38,863 --> 00:18:41,253
If You Do Not Have One,
We Will Appoint One For You.

365
00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:50,439
Well, I'd-I'd Be Delighted
To Speak To Them, Bree.

366
00:18:50,472 --> 00:18:52,175
Perhaps I Can Tell 'Em
The Story

367
00:18:52,175 --> 00:18:55,341
About The Time I Evaded
The North Korean Border Patrol

368
00:18:55,374 --> 00:18:58,341
By Hiding
In A Pile Of Oxen Dung.

369
00:18:58,374 --> 00:18:59,941
They'll Love That.

370
00:18:59,975 --> 00:19:02,641
This Is Gonna Be
The Best Seniors' Brunch Ever.

371
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:04,775
I'm So Glad You're Back.

372
00:19:04,808 --> 00:19:07,113
Between You And Me,
Reverend Sykes Tended

373
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:10,708
To Pander To The Congregation's
Progressive Element.

374
00:19:10,741 --> 00:19:14,341
I Prefer Your More Muscular
Brand Of Christianity.

375
00:19:14,374 --> 00:19:16,474
Well, Thank You, Bree.
Hmm.

376
00:19:16,508 --> 00:19:18,541
I Thought Of You Also.

377
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:21,574
I'm So Sorry To Hear
About Rex's Passing,

378
00:19:21,608 --> 00:19:24,674
But I Understand
That You Remarried.

379
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:28,307
I Did, But, Um, I'm Afraid
It Hasn't Worked Out.

380
00:19:28,341 --> 00:19:29,708
It's Been Rough.

381

For What It's Worth,
I Know How You Feel.

382
00:19:32,142 --> 00:19:34,474
When Carolyn Left Me,

383
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:36,441
The Loneliness
Was Crippling.

384
00:19:36,474 --> 00:19:38,675
I Didn't Know She Left You.

385
00:19:38,675 --> 00:19:41,641
Yes, For Our Korean Grocer.

386
00:19:41,674 --> 00:19:43,066
I'll Tell You,

387
00:19:43,066 --> 00:19:45,741
Sometimes
This Merciful God Of Ours

388
00:19:45,775 --> 00:19:48,300

390
00:19:51,574 --> 00:19:54,941
See You Then. Table For One? Yes.

391
00:19:54,975 --> 00:19:56,674
Scavo's.

392
00:19:57,925 --> 00:19:59,378
Is Everything All Right?

393
00:19:59,378 --> 00:20:00,237
Oh, This Is A Bit Awkward,

394
00:20:00,237 --> 00:20:02,641
But My Soon-To-Be Ex
Just Walked In.

395
00:20:02,674 --> 00:20:05,775
He's Been Following Me Everywhere.
For Ace, 8:30 P.M. All Right.

396
00:20:05,808 --> 00:20:08,878
Would You Mind Terribly
If I Took Your Hand?

397
00:20:08,878 --> 00:20:12,307
Maybe That Way, He'll Finally
Get The Idea That I've Moved On.

398
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,508
My Hand Is At Your Service.

399

A Wine List?

401
00:20:22,374 --> 00:20:24,608
Uh...

402
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:26,274
Actually, I...

403
00:20:26,307 --> 00:20:28,875
Think I'll Be Needing
A New Restaurant.

404
00:20:32,487 --> 00:20:34,269
Ah, It Worked.

405
00:20:34,741 --> 00:20:36,374
Thank You For That.

406
00:20:36,407 --> 00:20:39,112
It Was My Pleasure.

The Bail Bondsman Said
He Has To Run A Credit Check,

408
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:46,208
Then He'll Wire The Money.
So After You've Been Processed,

409
00:20:46,242 --> 00:20:47,425
You Can Leave.

498
00:25:19,488 --> 00:25:22,113
Reverend Green Decided To Change
Today's Scripture Reading.

499
00:25:22,113 --> 00:25:25,050
<I>It's Going To Be
Colossians 3:5.</I>

500
00:25:26,208 --> 00:25:29,363
Oh, He Wants To Talk
About Sexual Promiscuity?

501
00:25:29,363 --> 00:25:30,675
Well,
It Was A Last Minute Thing.

502
00:25:30,675 --> 00:25:32,143
He Came In This Morning
Muttering About

503
00:25:32,143 --> 00:25:34,722
Some "Redheaded Harlot"
In Our Midst

504
00:25:34,722 --> 00:25:36,269
Who Needs To Be Unmasked.

505
00:25:36,269 --> 00:25:39,378
I Don't Know. I Was Just So
Relieved He Was Off The Koreans,

506
00:25:39,379 --> 00:25:42,603
I Didn't Ask Questions.
Excuse Me A Minute.

507
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,488
Oh. Hello.

508
00:25:55,488 --> 00:25:57,644
Sorry.
I Know This Is A Bad Time.

509
00:25:57,644 --> 00:25:59,577
Aren't You
Bree Hodge's Ex-Husband?

510
00:25:59,644 --> 00:26:01,487
No, I'm Her Current Husband,

511
00:26:01,487 --> 00:26:04,999
And I Need To Speak To You
About Today's Sermon.

512
00:26:06,222 --> 00:26:08,582
They're A Little Late
Getting Started.

513
00:26:08,582 --> 00:26:10,862
I Know, And Reverend Green

514
00:26:10,862 --> 00:26:14,175
Is Usually Such A Stickler
For Punctuality.

515
00:26:14,695 --> 00:26:16,800
Well,
I Don't Mean To Be Rude,

516
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,262
But I Don't Think My Sermon
Is Any Of Your Business.

517
00:26:20,295 --> 00:26:22,228
Let Me Put It This Way.

518
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,332
If You Say Anything
About Bree,

519
00:26:25,332 --> 00:26:27,295
You And I Are
Gonna Have A Problem.

520
00:26:27,328 --> 00:26:29,629
Well,
I'm Sorry You Feel That Way,

521
00:26:30,269 --> 00:26:32,644
But I Think
It's My Duty As Pastor

522
00:26:32,644 --> 00:26:35,695
To Warn My Flock
When A Temptress Sits Among Us.

523
00:26:37,206 --> 00:26:38,238
Now If You'll Excuse Me.

524
00:26:40,762 --> 00:26:42,362
<I>What
The Hell's The Matter With You?</I>

525
00:26:42,362 --> 00:26:44,238
<I>I'm Not Going
To Let You Go Out There</I>

526
00:26:44,238 --> 00:26:49,629
<I>And Trash That Good Woman's
Name. "Good Woman"? She Led Me On.</I>

527
00:26:49,662 --> 00:26:51,695
Who Are They Talking About?

528
00:26:51,729 --> 00:26:54,061
<I>She's A Flame-Haired Jezebel!</I>

529
00:26:54,095 --> 00:26:58,162
<I>You're Insane! She Is
The Most Moral Person I Know!</I>

530
00:26:58,195 --> 00:27:01,050
<I>I Have No Idea. Now If You'll Please Excuse
Me. Would A Moral Person Lead A Man On</I>

531
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:03,737
<I>And Then Humiliate Him? I
Don't Care What She Did To You.</I>

532
00:27:03,737 --> 00:27:06,441
<I>I Am Not Going
To Let You Publicly Declare</I>

533
00:27:06,441 --> 00:27:10,095
<I>That Bree Hodge Is A Slut!
Oh, Dear Lord.</I>

534
00:27:18,061 --> 00:27:19,295
Then Again,

535
00:27:19,328 --> 00:27:22,862
<I>I Suppose I Could
Preach About Tolerance Today.</I>

536
00:27:24,262 --> 00:27:26,729
Orson.

537
00:27:26,762 --> 00:27:28,729
Orson.

538
00:27:30,462 --> 00:27:32,262
Hello, Maynard.

539
00:27:32,295 --> 00:27:35,228
I Love You, Maynard.

540
00:27:35,262 --> 00:27:38,800
My Sweet Little... May May.

541
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,796
Mamie.

542
00:27:40,829 --> 00:27:42,928
Nerd.

543
00:27:58,195 --> 00:28:01,961
Hello. I Need To Change The Name
On My Baby's Birth Certificate.

544
00:28:01,995 --> 00:28:04,995
Okay, Last Name?
Delfino, Maynard.

545
00:28:05,028 --> 00:28:07,762
Where's The Father?
You Both Need To Sign This.

546
00:28:07,796 --> 00:28:10,796
Oh. Working.
Busy, Busy, Busy.

547
00:28:10,829 --> 00:28:13,796
Uh, But He Told Me To Tell You
That He's Totally Cool With It.

548
00:28:13,829 --> 00:28:16,691
Well,
I'm Busy, Busy, Busy, Too.

549
00:28:16,691 --> 00:28:18,675
So When He's Available,
You Can Come On Back,

550
00:28:18,675 --> 00:28:20,195
And We'll Make The Change.

551
00:28:20,228 --> 00:28:21,816
Oh.

552
00:28:23,995 --> 00:28:25,462
Okay.

553
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:27,597
I'm Just Gonna Level
With You.

554
00:28:27,597 --> 00:28:30,995
My Husband Picked The Name,
And I Think It's Horrible,

555
00:28:31,028 --> 00:28:33,362
And I Know Over Time,
He's Gonna Agree.

556
00:28:33,395 --> 00:28:36,113
I Don't Care.
Rules Are Rules.

557
00:28:36,113 --> 00:28:37,675
You Gotta Help Me Out Here.

558
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:39,295
I'm Just Trying
To Protect My Child.

559
00:28:39,328 --> 00:28:40,175
I Don't Want Him
To Go Through Life

560
00:28:40,175 --> 00:28:44,129
Saddled With The Name "Maynard."
I Don't See What The Big Deal Is.

561
00:28:44,129 --> 00:28:47,095
Well, Of Course, You Don't.
You're Vanessa.

562
00:28:47,128 --> 00:28:49,228
You Went Through Life
With A Beautiful Name.

563
00:28:49,262 --> 00:28:52,228
That's Why You Have
Such A Crackerjack Personality.

564
00:28:52,262 --> 00:28:54,529
I Think We're Done Here.

565
00:28:58,162 --> 00:29:00,394
I Have A Couple Errands To Run.
Will You Cover For Me?

566
00:29:00,394 --> 00:29:02,999
No Problem.
Thanks, Griselda.

567
00:29:08,566 --> 00:29:10,228
Griselda...

568
00:29:10,262 --> 00:29:13,295
That Must Have Been A Tough Name
To Take Out On The Playground.

569
00:29:13,328 --> 00:29:15,262
Yeah.

570
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,128
Actually, It Was.

571
00:29:18,928 --> 00:29:20,644
We Should Talk.

572
00:29:25,529 --> 00:29:28,612
Hi. I'm, Uh, Here
To Check On Orson Hodge.

573
00:29:28,612 --> 00:29:30,721
An Ambulance Brought Him In
Less Than An Hour Ago.

574
00:29:30,721 --> 00:29:31,988
Are You Family?

575
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:34,729
I'm His Wife.

576
00:29:34,762 --> 00:29:37,028
Well, He's Going To Be Fine.

577
00:29:37,061 --> 00:29:38,328
There's No Concussion,

578
00:29:38,362 --> 00:29:41,395
But The Doctors Do Wanna Keep
Him Here For A Couple Of Hours.

579
00:29:41,429 --> 00:29:43,961
Should I Tell Him
That You're Here?

580
00:29:51,495 --> 00:29:55,028
No, That's All Right.
Let Him Rest.

581
00:29:58,595 --> 00:30:02,262
But Please
Take Excellent Care Of Him.

582
00:30:02,295 --> 00:30:04,128
He's A Good Man.

583
00:30:08,762 --> 00:30:10,729
Gaby, Can I Talk To You?

584
00:30:11,863 --> 00:30:13,796
About How You Snitched On Me
To Carlos?

585
00:30:13,829 --> 00:30:16,363
No, Thanks.
I'm All Caught Up On That.

586
00:30:18,263 --> 00:30:21,816
I'm Sorry,
But I Know From Experience

587
00:30:21,816 --> 00:30:23,363
What Cheating Can Do
To People.

588
00:30:24,238 --> 00:30:26,050
Let Me Guess.
This Story Ends With You

589
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:29,196
Throwing Your Boyfriend's
Varsity Jacket In The Lake?

590
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:36,096
When I Was 13,

591
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:39,050
My Dad Caught
My Mom Having An Affair,

592
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:40,662
And He Walked Out On Us.

593
00:30:40,696 --> 00:30:43,130
Oh.

594
00:30:43,163 --> 00:30:46,597
We Had Nothing, Okay?
My Mom Went Crazy,

595
00:30:46,629 --> 00:30:48,796
And I Ended Up
On The Street.

596
00:30:48,829 --> 00:30:50,519
To Survive, I...

597
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:53,929
I Had To Do A Bunch Of Stuff
That I'm Not Proud Of.

598
00:30:53,963 --> 00:30:55,829
Oh, Ellie,
I'm So Sorry.

599
00:30:59,929 --> 00:31:01,230
I Had No Idea.

600
00:31:01,263 --> 00:31:04,196
What Have We Got Here?

601
00:31:05,796 --> 00:31:07,175
That's Our Guy.

602
00:31:07,996 --> 00:31:09,829
The Point Is,

603
00:31:09,863 --> 00:31:13,463
The One Bad Decision
Can Mess Up A Lot Of Lives,

604
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:17,029
And I Just Don't Want That
To Happen To You And Carlos

605
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:19,425
'Cause I Love You Guys.

606
00:31:30,796 --> 00:31:31,963
Yes?

607
00:31:31,996 --> 00:31:33,530
Supplier's Coming Your Way.

608
00:31:33,563 --> 00:31:36,253
We're Gonna Arrest Them Both,
So Get Out Of There Now.

609
00:31:37,796 --> 00:31:40,629
Okay. Bye.

610
00:31:41,829 --> 00:31:44,929
Anyway, I Didn't Mean
To Get Into A Whole Thing.

611
00:31:44,963 --> 00:31:47,330
I Just Wanted
To Say I'm Sorry.

612
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:49,530
The Cops Are Coming. Go.

613
00:31:49,563 --> 00:31:50,629
What?!

614
00:31:51,941 --> 00:31:53,096
Police! Drop The Bag!
Drop The Bag!

615
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:55,863
Hands Behind Your Head.
It's A Sting.

616
00:31:55,896 --> 00:31:57,896
Go Out The Back Now.

617
00:32:08,488 --> 00:32:11,379
Adam! Mom Said
You Were Coming Tonight.

618
00:32:11,379 --> 00:32:12,910
Oh, I Wouldn't Miss
It For The World... Oh.

619
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:15,113
So You Better Be On Your "A" Game. Okay.

620
00:32:15,113 --> 00:32:16,644
And We're All Going Out
To Dinner Afterwards.

621
00:32:16,644 --> 00:32:20,425
Adam Wants To Tell You About Your
Graduation Present. What? What Is It?

622
00:32:20,425 --> 00:32:23,784
No, No, No. You Gotta Wait,
But I'll Give You A Clue.

623
00:32:23,784 --> 00:32:25,999
I Hope
Your Passport's Up-To-Date.

624
00:32:31,629 --> 00:32:33,597
Yeah, No.
It's-It's Okay, Andrew.

625
00:32:33,629 --> 00:32:35,441
You Can, Uh,
You Can Just-

626
00:32:35,441 --> 00:32:37,254
You Can Finish It
In The Morning.

627
00:32:37,796 --> 00:32:40,696
Great. See Ya. Bye.

628
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:45,096
Need Some Help With That?

629
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,096
I Didn't Think
You Liked Puzzles.

630
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:49,628
Hmm. I Can Give It A Shot.

631
00:32:54,396 --> 00:32:56,800
I Need To Talk To You...

632
00:32:57,896 --> 00:32:59,050
About Lynette.

633
00:32:59,675 --> 00:33:01,996
I'm Sorry I Had To Call
Dr. Dolan, Daddy,

634
00:33:02,029 --> 00:33:03,696
But She Scares Me.

635
00:33:03,729 --> 00:33:05,130
Yeah.

636
00:33:05,163 --> 00:33:06,929
You Said That Before,

637
00:33:06,963 --> 00:33:08,191
But Here's The Thing.

638
00:33:08,191 --> 00:33:09,800
They're Gonna
Let Lynette Go Soon,

639
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,530
And When They Do,
You Guys Aren't

640
00:33:12,563 --> 00:33:14,941
Gonna Be Able To Live
In The Same House Anymore.

641
00:33:14,941 --> 00:33:17,363
You-You Know That, Right?

642
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:20,963
So Where Is She Gonna Live?

643
00:33:20,996 --> 00:33:23,597
Like, In A Hotel
Or Something?

644
00:33:25,196 --> 00:33:26,896
She Lives Here, Kayla,

645
00:33:28,191 --> 00:33:29,796
With Me And The Boys
And Penny.

646
00:33:29,829 --> 00:33:31,130
This Is Her Home.

647
00:33:31,925 --> 00:33:32,300
But-

648
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:36,029
But Don't Worry. We're Gonna
Find You A Nice Place To Live.

649
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,330
Daddy,
I Don't Wanna Go Anywhere.

650
00:33:38,363 --> 00:33:40,175
I Wanna Stay Here With You.

651
00:33:40,175 --> 00:33:44,831
I Don't Have A Choice, Kayla.
I Need To Keep You Safe.

652
00:33:45,378 --> 00:33:46,999
But I Made It All Up.

653
00:33:49,196 --> 00:33:51,363
I Lied About Everything.

654
00:33:52,996 --> 00:33:54,929
I Burned Myself.

655
00:33:56,363 --> 00:33:58,063
And Why Would You Do That,
Kayla?

656
00:33:58,096 --> 00:33:59,696
I Hate Her.

657
00:33:59,729 --> 00:34:02,829
And It's So Much Better
When It's Just Us.

658
00:34:09,296 --> 00:34:12,378
I See. And You'll Explain
All This To The Police

659
00:34:12,378 --> 00:34:14,487
And Dr. Dolan
And Everybody, Right?

660
00:34:14,487 --> 00:34:18,463
Yes, I Promise.
And Then I Can Stay, Right?

661
00:34:20,762 --> 00:34:22,729
No, Sweetie. No.

662
00:34:22,762 --> 00:34:25,563
What You Did Was Horrible,

663
00:34:25,597 --> 00:34:27,796
And I Can't Trust You
Anymore.

664
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,230
Then I'm Gonna Keep Lying
To Everybody.

665
00:34:31,263 --> 00:34:33,196
You Don't Want That,
Do You?

666
00:34:39,363 --> 00:34:42,296
Did You Get All That,
Dr. Dolan?

667
00:35:02,113 --> 00:35:03,762
I'm Gonna Go Stretch My Legs
And Check My Service Real Quick.

668
00:35:03,796 --> 00:35:05,988
Okay, But Intermission's
Only Ten Minutes.

669
00:35:05,988 --> 00:35:07,113
Yeah.

670
00:35:17,396 --> 00:35:20,762
Excuse Me.
Could You Give Me A Hand?

671
00:35:20,796 --> 00:35:23,796
What's Up? Nail In My
Tire. I Gotta Change It Now

672
00:35:23,829 --> 00:35:26,363
'Cause????????????

673
00:35:26,396 --> 00:35:28,425
I'm-I'm Catching A Red-Eye.
Yeah, Sure. I Can Help.

674
00:35:28,425 --> 00:35:30,378
Oh, Thanks.
I'm Right Over Here.

675
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:33,896
Wow,
This Thing's Really Flat.

676
00:35:33,929 --> 00:35:36,230
Usually With A Nail,
You Get A Slow Leak.

677
00:35:36,263 --> 00:35:38,487
Yeah. I'm Lucky
I Even Made It Here.

678
00:35:38,487 --> 00:35:39,941
Well, I Got This.

679
00:35:39,941 --> 00:35:41,254
You Grab The Spare.

680
00:35:43,659 --> 00:35:45,230
My Daughter's The One
That Plays The Cello.

681
00:35:45,263 --> 00:35:47,296
Which One Is Your Daughter?

682
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:49,829
That's The Other Thing
I Need Your Help With.

683
00:36:09,862 --> 00:36:10,504
Oh, Honey,

684
00:36:10,504 --> 00:36:12,999
Can You Get All My Toiletries
Out Of The Bathroom?

685
00:36:18,454 --> 00:36:19,800
What Are Those?

686
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,828
Well, It's Cute, Aren't They?
It's A Hospital Tradition.

687
00:36:24,661 --> 00:36:26,300
Get Them Out Of Here Now.

688
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,738
Why?
Because My Husband

689
00:36:28,738 --> 00:36:30,816
Is Terrified Of Balloons.

690
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:34,062
He Was Once Molested
By A Clown.

691
00:36:34,095 --> 00:36:36,928
Oh, My Gosh.
Oh, I Got It.

692
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:42,113
What's Going On?

693
00:36:42,999 --> 00:36:45,928
I'm Sorry, Sir.
We Didn't Know About The Clown.

694
00:36:47,941 --> 00:36:51,828
Why Does That Say "Conner"?
Is That What It Said?

695
00:36:51,862 --> 00:36:53,941
We Had "Maynard" Ones
Printed Up,

696
00:36:53,941 --> 00:36:54,925
But Mrs. Delfino...
Shh!

697
00:36:54,925 --> 00:36:57,675
Went To The Records Office...

698
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:02,596
Susan... What's Going On?

699
00:37:02,628 --> 00:37:04,028
Well...

700
00:37:04,062 --> 00:37:06,441
I Hate The Name "Maynard."

701
00:37:06,441 --> 00:37:09,175
Really? I Like It-
Get Out.

702
00:37:12,641 --> 00:37:14,706
I'm Sorry. I...

703
00:37:15,362 --> 00:37:19,429
I Just Want Our Kid
To Have A Great Name.

704
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:23,613
I Don't Think "Maynard"
Is Great.

705
00:37:28,172 --> 00:37:30,237
<I>You Wanna Know What Is Great?</I>

706
00:37:32,816 --> 00:37:34,753
My Grandfather...

707
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:38,329
Started The First Integrated
Elementary School In Tennessee.

708
00:37:38,362 --> 00:37:40,613
And You Know
What Else Is Great?

709
00:37:40,613 --> 00:37:42,613
When My Dad Went To Prison,

710
00:37:42,613 --> 00:37:45,237
The State Wanted
To Put Me In The System.

711
00:37:46,095 --> 00:37:48,028
My Grandfather
Wouldn't Let 'Em.

712
00:37:48,062 --> 00:37:49,175
He Took In My Mom And Me

713
00:37:49,175 --> 00:37:52,095
And Sacrificed Everything

714
00:37:52,129 --> 00:37:54,362
Just To Make Sure
We Had A Great Life.

715
00:37:56,162 --> 00:37:58,229
Wow.

716
00:37:58,262 --> 00:38:00,329
I Didn't Know About That.

717
00:38:00,362 --> 00:38:04,462
Susan, I Don't Want To
Just Give Our Son A Name.

718
00:38:04,496 --> 00:38:09,503
I Want To Give Him
Someone To Live Up To.

719
00:38:19,362 --> 00:38:21,529
Maynard.

720
00:38:22,656 --> 00:38:24,496
Let's Hope He's Worthy.

721
00:38:25,488 --> 00:38:29,596
Well, That Part's Up To Us.

722
00:38:34,095 --> 00:38:36,895
Well,
That's All Of Her Things.

723
00:38:36,928 --> 00:38:40,175
Well, We Should Probably
Get Going, Hmm?

724
00:38:40,175 --> 00:38:43,237
We Found A Hotel With A Pool
For Tonight.

725
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:46,159
Maybe You And Grandpa
Can Go Swimming.

726
00:38:52,429 --> 00:38:54,999
Sheila, Can I Talk To Her
For A Sec?

727
00:38:57,329 --> 00:39:00,895
Honey,
I Know This Is Hard On You.

728
00:39:00,928 --> 00:39:02,878
But I'm Gonna Come Visit You
At Grandpa And Grandma's

729
00:39:02,878 --> 00:39:03,816
All The Time.

730
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,925
So It's Not Like
It's Good-Bye Forever.

731
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,080
Kayla...

732
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:20,120
I'm Sorry How Everything Turned Out.

733
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,000
No,You're Not.

734
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,340
Okay,Then.

735
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:35,130
I Love You,Baby.

736
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:38,340
Have A Safe Trip.

737
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,570
Daddy! I'm Sorry!

738
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:01,090
Daddy,I'm Sorry! Please!

739
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:04,110
Daddy! Please!

740
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:20,950
<I>What's In A Name?</I>

741
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,730
<I>Do The Labels We Attach To People</I>

742
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:28,160
<I>Tell Us Everything We Need To Know?</I>

743
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,720
<I>If We Say She's Just A Child,</I>

744
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:35,960
<I>Does This Mean She's Truly Innocent?</I>

745
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:43,150
<I>Does Calling Her A Drug Dealer Prove She's Purely Evil?</I>

746
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:48,170
<I>Will A Man Known As "Preacher"</I>

747
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:52,600
<I>Always Practice What He Preaches?</I>

748
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:56,060
<I>Can A Man Branded A Villain</I>

749
00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:00,700
<I>Possess The Qualities Of A Hero?</I>

750
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,430
<I>The Truth Is,</I>

751
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:07,790
<I>A Name Can Never Really Tell You Who Someone Is...</I>

752
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:18,850
Who Are You?

753
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:23,530
<I>Any More Than It Can Tell You What They're Capable Of.</I>

754
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,620
I'm Wayne Davis...

755
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,590
And We're About To Have Some Fun.

756
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:38,700
the next morning

757
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,670
<I>It Had Been 14 Years</I>

758
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:47,040
<I>Since Katherine Mayfair Had Been In A Police Station,</I>

759
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,420
<I>But She Remembered The Conversation</I>

760
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:52,090
<I>Like It Was Yesterday.</I>

761
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,380
Would You Like Some Water,Honey?

762
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,050
Thanks.

763
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,050
So... I Take It

764
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,940
This Isn't The First Time Your Husband's Hit You?

765
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:05,460
He Keeps Promising To Stop, But It Just Gets Worse.

766
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:09,340
And I'm Afraid He's Gonna Do Something To My Daughter.

767
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:12,390
Please, You Have To Help Me.

768
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:14,330
Have You Reported Him Before?

769
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,460
Once,But When I Called,

770
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:18,390
They Said They Couldn't Find The Paperwork.

771
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:20,490
Oh.

772
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:25,030
Your Husband's Wayne Davis, One Of Our Patrolmen.

773
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,790
Want Some Advice?

774
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,920
Wayne's Got A Lot Of Friends Around Here.

775
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,930
Of Course You Can Press Charges,But...

776
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:36,890
I Can't Guarantee

777
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,240
<I>That One Of His Friends Won't Lose The Paperwork Again.</I>

778
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,800
Then What Should I Do?

779
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:45,620
Get As Much Money As You Can Lay Your Hands On,

780
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:47,600
Grab Your Daughter...

781
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,040
And Run.

782
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:55,460
<I>And So She Did...</I>

783
00:42:56,630 --> 00:43:00,380
<I>To A Place She Thought Would Be Safe.</I>

784
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:05,630
Mrs. Mayfair?

785
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:09,100
I'm Detective Romslo. Can I Help You?

786
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:12,870
Why Exactly Would You Think That Dr. Mayfair Was Kidnapped?

787
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,350
No One In The School Parking Lot

788
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:17,260
Heard Or Saw Anything Suspicious.

789
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:21,430
That's Because The Man Responsible For This-My Ex-

790
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:24,190
Knows A Little Something About How To Commit A Crime.

791
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:25,990
He's A Cop.

792
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,810
What's His Name?

793
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:30,370
Wayne Davis.

794
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,570
What?

795
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:39,980
Well,It's Just,Uh...

796
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,810
I Know Wayne. We've Hung Out Together.

797
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:43,930
He's A Hell Of A Golfer.

798
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:47,540
Well,Believe Me When I Tell You He Wasn't A Hell Of A Husband.

799
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:48,750
Is That What This Is About?

800
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:52,170
Some Payback For An Ancient Domestic Dispute?

801
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:56,680
Please. You Have To Do Something.

802
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:00,030
Because Once Wayne Is Done With Adam,

803
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,340
He's Going To Come After Me.

804
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:05,860
And This Time, He's Gonna Kill Me. I Know It.

805
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:09,140
I'll Look Into It.

806
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:12,950
If You Would Just,Uh, Fill Out This Paperwork...

807
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:19,610
<I>In That Moment,Katherine Knew Exactly What She Had To Do...</I>

808
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,230
<I>Again.</I>

809
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:24,060
Mom,Stop. You're Not Making Any Sense. There's No Time.

810
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:26,450
Wayne Is Coming. He Took Adam. We're Next.

811
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,300
But Why? Why Would He Do That? And If We're In So Much Danger,

812
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,470
Then Why Aren't We Calling The Police? The Police Will Not Help. Dylan,Please!

813
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:36,460
Go Pack Your Things. We Need To Be Gone Before He Gets Here. Stop!

814
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:41,180
I'm Not Going Anywhere Until You Tell Me What's Going On.

815
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,690
Why Do I Have To Be Afraid Of My Father?

816
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:45,870
<I>Katherine Mayfair</I>

817
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:50,200
<I>Had Been Running From The Truth For A Long Time...</I>

818
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:51,500
Okay.

819
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:54,560
I'll Tell You.

820
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,490
No!

821
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:59,640
Dylan. Dylan,I'm Sorry. I Had No Choice! No!

822
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,010
Dylan!

823
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:06,540
<I>And It Had Finally Caught Up With Her.</I>

824
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:13,480
<I>There's A Ritual My Friends Have Observed For Years.</I>

825
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:15,980
<I>Once A Week,They Meet To Play A Game Of Cards</I>

826
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:18,300
<I>And Talk About Their Lives.</I>

827
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:21,200
<I>There's Always Laughter And Wine...</I>

828
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,500
<I>And Talk About The Neighbors.</I>

829
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:25,070
No Way,Bree. I Don't Want Katherine In Our Games.

830
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:27,710
She Bums Me Out. Oh,I'm With Gaby. I Mean,You Know Me.

831
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:31,420
I Always Like To Give People The Benefit Of The Doubt... No,You Don't.

832
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:33,100
No,I Don't, But Let's Say I Did.

833
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:34,630
Katherine Has This Aloof Quality.

834
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:37,790
It's Like She's Always Trying To Keep Us At Arm's Length. Well,I Have To Agree.

835
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:41,700
She's Changed. She's Not That Fun Anymore. Ladies,I Don't Know What You're Talking About.

836
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:45,780
Katherine Has All Sorts Of Wonderful Qualities. Name One,And Keep In Mind

837
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:48,130
That "Aloof" And "Unfun" Have Already Been Taken.

838
00:45:48,290 --> 00:45:50,550
Well,I Admit She Plays Her Cards Close To The Vest,

839
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:53,900
But Some Of You Could Benefit From That Kind Of Quiet Dignity,

840
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:57,080
Miss I-Chew-Gum- Like-A-1930s-Gun-Moll.

841
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,750
Bree,You Can Talk Katherine Up All You Want,

842
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,290
But She Is Just Never Gonna Be One Of Us.

843
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:05,090
Anybody Home?

844
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,540
Oh.

845
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:11,600
Hi! We Were Just Talking About You. Random Chitchat,Nothing Specific.

846
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,380
That's Nice. Could I Talk To You For A Minute?

847
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,620
Hey. What's Going On? Okay,I Know It's Last Minute,

848
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:19,080
But I Have To Leave Town, So I'm Not Gonna Be Able

849
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:23,300
To Help You Cater The Commitment Ceremony. It's Tomorrow!

850
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:25,110
A Hundred Gay Men Are Descending On This Street,

851
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,570
And They're Expecting A Fabulous Party. I Feel Awful,

852
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:31,540
But I Wouldn't Bail On You If It Weren't Important.

853
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:33,000
Okay. Well,What's Going On?

854
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:36,250
I Can't Tell You. Again,I'm So Sorry.

855
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:38,310
Good Luck.

856
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:48,280
All Right,You Can All Wipe Those Smug Looks Off Your Faces,

857
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:52,410
Because Every One Of You Has Just Become My Employee.

858
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,930
Hey,Got Any Plans Tomorrow At 5:00 A.M.? 'Cause Now You Do.

859
00:46:58,090 --> 00:47:02,040
Bree Needs About Two Truckloads Of Flowers Picked Up From...

860
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:03,540
What?

861
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:05,820
Guess Who Got Off The Wait-List At Princeton!

862
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:08,300
Oh,My God. Oh,My God!

863
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:11,370
I'm So Proud Of You!

864
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:13,590
Okay,I Am Going To Need A Bumper Sticker Right Away

865
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:18,100
So I Can Start Annoying All The Other Parents! Sure. I'll Snag You One When I Get There On Tuesday.

866
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:22,360
Tuesday? What Are You Talking About? Okay,You Know That Professor Who Read My Senior Thesis?

867
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,330
Well,He Was So Impressed

868
00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:25,490
That He Asked Me To Come Out And Do A Summer Internship.

869
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:26,540
I'm Leaving Next Week.

870
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:30,550
Next Week? W- Well,That Is A Big...

871
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:32,130
No.

872
00:47:32,270 --> 00:47:34,400
No? Mom,I Have To. It's A Huge Honor.

873
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:36,490
Yes... T

874
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,440
And You Have Been Chosen.

875
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,110
So Congratulations,

876
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:41,710
And You're Staying Home.

877
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,430
Oh,You're Not Letting Her Go?

878
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:45,360
But It's A Huge Honor.

879
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:48,610
Yes,We've Established That. It's Huge. It's An Honor.

880
00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:50,290
We Get It.

881
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:53,070
Give Me One Good Reason Why I Can't Go.

882
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:55,410
Well,The First Thing Off The Top Of My Head...

883
00:47:55,590 --> 00:47:56,660
Uh...

884
00:47:57,810 --> 00:48:00,120
We Can't Afford It.

885
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:04,320
Susan,Can I Talk To You For A Sec?

886
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,750
You Know, I Just Inherited 5 Grand

887
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:07,720
From Grandpa Maynard,

888
00:48:07,890 --> 00:48:12,250
And I... I'd Really Like To Help Julie Do This.

889
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,610
Mike,That Is So Sweet.

890
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,640
Mike Makes Another Good Point.

891
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:19,030
Who Is This Professor?

892
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:20,090
I Don't Know Him.

893
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:23,700
I Am Certainly Not Going To Give My Daughter To Him For A Summer.

894
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:26,350
I'm Sorry,Julie. This Is Not Happening.

895
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:27,420
This Totally Sucks.

896
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:29,130
Well,Yes, But Don't Forget-

897
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,080
<I>It Is A Huge Honor.</I>

898
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:39,940
Hey.

899
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:44,100
<I>You Know What We Haven't Done In A Really Long Time?</I>

900
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:47,150
Made 250 Mini Pizzas In One Afternoon.

901
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:49,210
What Are You Talking About?

902
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:52,050
Bree's In A Horrible Jam, And I Told Her We'd Help Cater

903
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:53,850
The Commitment Ceremony Tomorrow.

904
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:56,860
I Can't. I'm Busy,Remember? I'm Taking This Stuff To Kayla,

905
00:48:57,010 --> 00:49:00,110
My Daughter Who Lives Four And A Half Hours Away Now.

906
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:02,290
Okay,So At The Risk

907
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:04,890
Of Cracking These Eggshells I've Been Walking On All Week,

908
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:08,500
<I>Any Idea When You're Gonna Stop Being So Angry?</I>

909
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:10,140
I'm Not Angry At You.

910
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:12,430
'Cause You Know We Didn't Have A Choice,Tom.

911
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:13,960
We Had To Get Her Out Of The House.

912
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:15,730
I Know. I Am Angry At The Situation.

913
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:17,930
Can You Please Just Let Me Be Angry?

914
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:21,440
Fine. You Can Be As Angry And Sulky And Pissy As You Want,

915
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:22,950
Just So Long As You're Here Tomorrow,

916
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:27,420
Helping Me Crank Out 250 Mini Pizzas.

917
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:28,900
You Know,I've Been Told

918
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:30,920
That Some Wives Ask Their Husbands For Favors

919
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:33,910
And Actually Say,"Please."

920
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,360
Oh,Tom.

921
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,920
Don't You Know An Urban Myth When You Hear One?

922
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,590
Okay,So Here's The Deal.

923
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:46,350
Bree Needs All Of These Wedding Favors

924
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:49,070
<I>Wrapped By Tomorrow, And She's Really Counting On Me,</I>

925
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:52,140
So... I'm Gonna Need You To Hurry.

926
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:55,120
I Just Got Off The Phone With The Credit Card Company.

927
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:57,740
Do You Have Something That You Wanna Tell Me?

928
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:02,130
Mm... Well,It Would Be Easier If I Knew What You Knew. Damn It,Gaby,Enough Shopping!

929
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:04,340
You've Maxed Out Every Credit Card We Own.

930
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,560
I Mean, We Are So Broke Right Now,

931
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:09,460
It's Gonna Be A Miracle If We Don't End Up On The Street. Okay,When You Yell At Me,I Get Upset.

932
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:11,750
And You Know What I Do When I Get Upset? I Shop.

933
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,970
<I>So If We Do End Up Homeless, Guess Whose Fault It'll Be.</I>

934
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:21,750
Whatever. I'm Gonna Go Read Porn... In Braille.

935
00:50:27,570 --> 00:50:30,080
Hello? Gaby,It's Ellie.

936
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:33,420
Ellie,You Can't Call Me! The Cops Are All Over My Ass

937
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:35,010
Because They Think I Helped You Escape.

938
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:36,570
I'm Sorry. I Just Need One More Favor,

939
00:50:36,730 --> 00:50:40,790
And Then I'll Never Bother You Again. Oh! Ellie,I Don't Know. What Is It?

940
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:42,880
I Left My Teddy Bear In The Coat Closet.

941
00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:47,260
I Need You To Bring It To Me. Teddy Bear? What Is That,Code For "A Pound Of Blow"?

942
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:50,060
No,It's An Actual Teddy Bear.

943
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:52,830
My Dad Gave It To Me When I Was 5,

944
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,920
And It's The Only Thing I Have Left To Remember Him By.

945
00:50:56,070 --> 00:50:57,340
Crap.

946
00:50:57,550 --> 00:50:59,800
Ya Had To Play The Daddy Card.

947
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:11,920
Hmm.

948
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:24,640
??? Y, We'll Open Up The Buffet...

949
00:51:24,810 --> 00:51:27,080
Mm-Hmm. Uh,Chicken Marsala, And Pasta For The Vegetarians.

950
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:30,150
And Dancing,Roll Out The Cake, You Leave For Your Honeymoon,

951
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:32,630
And I Will Collapse In A Tasteful Heap.

952
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:34,990
Hold It. You Didn't Say Anything About The Ice Sculpture.

953
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:39,820
Oh! Yes,I'm Sorry. One Cherub Delivered At 1:30. Cherub? No,I Specifically

954
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:42,660
Told Katherine We Were Gonna Go With The Enchanted Castle.

955
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,330
And I Told Her We'd Go With The Cherub

956
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:47,760
Because We Are Not 8- Year-Old Girls. Bob,All My Life

957
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:49,620
I Have Dreamt Of Having A Wedding Reception

958
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:51,780
In Which I Would Serve Drinks From A Vodka Moat

959
00:51:51,930 --> 00:51:54,550
Surrounding An Enchanted Castle Rendered In Ice,

960
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:57,410
And I Don't Think That's Too Much To Ask. Remember When You Asked Me

961
00:51:57,570 --> 00:51:59,390
To Tell You When You Start Acting Like Faye Dunaway

962
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:03,140
From The Boardroom Scene In "Mommie Dearest"?

963
00:52:03,310 --> 00:52:06,260
Uh,Why Don't I Let You Two Work This Out?

964
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:10,130
Fine,We'll Go With The Stupid Baby Angel.

965
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:14,020
I Need Some Coffee.

966
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,620
Why Are You Here? And Don't Say For The Pizza,

967
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:18,470
Because I Know You're Lactose-Intolerant.

968
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:20,450
I Heard Katherine Left You In The Lurch.

969
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:24,150
I'm Here To Offer My Assistance. Oh,I Get It. So I'm Desperate And Vulnerable,

970
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:25,890
And You're Gonna Swoop In And Save The Day.

971
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:29,390
Well,Thank You Very Much. I'm Fine. Darling, Don't Be Stubborn. You're Gonna Need Place Cards,

972
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:32,400
And You Know I Have Excellent Penmanship. Don't You Dare

973
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:34,170
Throw Your Calligraphy Skills In My Face When You Know

974
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:38,820
I'm At A Low Point. Now Go! And Stop Following Me.

975
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:44,990
You're Doomed.

976
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:46,660
Excuse Me?

977
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:49,300
The Way You Just Caved On That Sculpture Thing?

978
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:51,960
You're Setting The Tone For Your Entire Marriage. I Am?

979
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:53,810
Yeah. You Gotta Dig In Your Heels.

980
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:57,000
Otherwise,You're Gonna Be Pushed Around For The Next...

981
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:59,680
Let's See. How Long Have I Been Married?

982
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:02,630
Ten And A Half Years.

983
00:53:06,070 --> 00:53:07,740
I Want My Castle.

984
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:09,960
<I>Lee... It Is The Only Thing I've Asked For,</I>

985
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:12,900
And Damn It, I'm Entitled To It.

986
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,170
Fine.

987
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:17,230
Oh.

988
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:20,200
Thank You.

989
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:25,230
All Right,So I Will Call The Ice Sculptor

990
00:53:25,390 --> 00:53:29,290
And See If We Can - Forget It. We're Sticking With The Cherub.

991
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:30,530
And Later, When He Bitches About It,

992
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:32,990
I'll Just Buy Him Some Jewelry.

993
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:35,870
You Sure You Haven't Been Married Before?

994
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:36,940
Hey,Gaby?

995
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:39,040
Over Here,Carlos.

996
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,660
You Know,I Got A Theory

997
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:43,390
As To Why All This Bad Stuff Has Happened To Us-

998
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:46,520
My Blindness And Losing All Our Money...

999
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:48,940
It's Karma. You Know, We've Been Selfish And Greedy,

1000
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:52,810
And The Universe Is Telling Us To Start Being Better People.

1001
00:53:53,050 --> 00:53:57,230
I Just Found $118,000 In Ellie's Teddy Bear.

1002
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:59,200
Hey,Universe?

1003
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:00,880
Bite Me!

1004
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:01,620
Hello?

1005
00:54:01,790 --> 00:54:04,160
Hey,Wayne? It's Pete Romslo.

1006
00:54:04,330 --> 00:54:06,620
Pete! How's Tricks?

1007
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:07,760
Listen,Uh, I'm Just Calling

1008
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:08,640
To Give You A Heads-Up.

1009
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:13,040
Um,I Finally Met Your Ex. She Came In To File A Report.

1010
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,570
Apparently, You,Uh,Kidnapped Her Husband.

1011
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:18,270
No Kidding? Am I Asking For Ransom?

1012
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:20,310
Well,You Always Said She Was Crazy.

1013
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,120
Now I Feel Your Pain.

1014
00:54:22,290 --> 00:54:26,880
Anyway,I-I Just Thought You Should Know,Huh? Take Care. Thanks.

1015
00:54:31,090 --> 00:54:33,530
Okay,Enough Kiddin' Around.

1016
00:54:33,790 --> 00:54:36,380
Tell Me Where My Daughter Is.

1017
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:42,040
Oh,For-

1018
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,940
Did You Die On Me?

1019
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:52,560
Damn It!

1020
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:07,720
Okay,So You Have Another One Of Those In The Truck?

1021
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:11,290
Thank You. I'll Be Back In Ten Minutes!

1022
00:55:11,450 --> 00:55:15,970
We Need More Settings On Five,Please. Lynette, I Wish I Had Time To Be More Tactful,But I Don't.

1023
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:18,880
Your Swan Is Pathetic,And I'm Firing You From Napkin Duty.

1024
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:21,940
No,No,Give Me Another Chance. I Will Get It.

1025
00:55:22,210 --> 00:55:22,980
Yes?

1026
00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:25,550
Oh,There You Are! Where Is My Ice Sculpture?

1027
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:29,560
No! No,6:00 Is Too Late. I Need It Now.

1028
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:33,020
Oh,Forget It. I'll Pick It Up Myself.

1029
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:35,700
Why Don't You Fill Water Glasses?

1030
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:38,690
That's An Important Job,Too.

1031
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,890
Andrew... Look,I'm On My Way Back,

1032
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:47,900
But It's Imperative That You...

1033
00:55:48,350 --> 00:55:49,750
Andrew?

1034
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:50,800
Oh,Dear God.

1035
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,780
Oh,No. Don't Die On Me Now!

1036
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:56,450
Aah!

1037
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:01,260
Oh,Dear God.

1038
00:56:34,450 --> 00:56:36,440
Aah! Help Me!

1039
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,910
Help!

1040
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:44,570
I'm Just Saying We Should Pay Off All Of Our Bills

1041
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:48,140
And Put The Rest In Savings. Savings? Nobody Does That Anymore.

1042
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:50,170
Well,I Mean,You Never Know. We Might Have Kids.

1043
00:56:50,330 --> 00:56:52,500
Oh,Carlos, We're Never Gonna Have Kids.

1044
00:56:52,670 --> 00:56:56,710
Shoes Are My Kids. Let Me Be The Mother I Was Meant To Be.

1045
00:56:58,280 --> 00:56:59,500
Hello?

1046
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:01,780
Where's My Bear?

1047
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:05,320
Oh. Right. The Bear.

1048
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:10,450
Well... I Looked All Over And Just Couldn't Find It.

1049
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:14,140
I Guess The Cops Took It. I'm Really Sorry,Ellie.

1050
00:57:14,310 --> 00:57:15,580
I Know It Was A Gift From Your Dad.

1051
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:17,720
It Just Breaks My Heart.

1052
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:21,500
You Found The Money,Didn't You? Money? What Money?

1053
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:23,740
You're Lying. I Can Hear It In Your Voice.

1054
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:25,020
What's Wrong With My Voice?

1055
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:29,460
Okay,Listen,Bitch. You Do Not Wanna Screw With Me.

1056
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:33,150
How About We Split It 50-50?

1057
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:35,260
I'm Coming To Get My Money,

1058
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:39,620
And If One Dime Is Missing, I Will Throw Acid In Your Face.

1059
00:57:43,890 --> 00:57:46,840
Okay,We Really Need To Get Caller I.D.

1060
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,050
Ugh.

1061
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,550
What More Can You Do To Me?

1062
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,460
Need A Lift?

1063
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:23,150
Hey.

1064
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:26,300
Hi. Is,Uh,Dylan Here By Any Chance?

1065
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:28,240
Uh,Um,No, I- I Haven't Seen Her.

1066
00:58:28,410 --> 00:58:29,370
Okay. Thanks.

1067
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:31,670
Hey,Katherine, Are You All Right?

1068
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:34,260
Uh... Dylan And I,We...

1069
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,060
Had A Big Fight.

1070
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:37,890
Well, I'm Sure She's Just Upset,

1071
00:58:38,070 --> 00:58:40,800
And She'll Come Home After She Cools Off.

1072
00:58:40,970 --> 00:58:42,730
Not This Time.

1073
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:44,870
I Lied To Her.

1074
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,040
Well... We All Lie To Our Kids Sometimes,Right?

1075
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,010
I've Been Doing It Her Whole Life-

1076
00:58:52,170 --> 00:58:53,440
One Lie On Top Of Another-

1077
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:55,290
And The Thing... I Learned Too Late

1078
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:59,660
Is That Eventually They All Come Crashing Down On You.

1079
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:02,570
Anyway, If You See Her,Let Me Know?

1080
00:59:02,730 --> 00:59:04,500
Thanks.

1081
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,470
What's Your Hurry,Kathy?

1082
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:31,370
Aah! Aah!

1083
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:33,690
Aah.

1084
00:59:35,090 --> 00:59:37,050
What Happened To My Daughter?

1085
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:39,920
I'm Not Telling You Anything,

1086
00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:42,240
So You Might As Well Kill Me.

1087
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:44,380
I Don't Care.

1088
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:46,700
I Believe You.

1089
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,690
I Do.

1090
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:51,370
But What About Dylan?

1091
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:56,890
Or Should I Say,That Girl That Lives Here With You?

1092
00:59:57,540 --> 01:00:00,520
<I>I Bet You'd Care If I Killed Her.</I>

1093
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:06,130
Uh...

1094
01:00:06,310 --> 01:00:08,380
There Are No Wings.

1095
01:00:08,550 --> 01:00:10,730
Yes,And The "Venus De Milo" Is Missing Two Arms.

1096
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:12,330
What's Your Point?

1097
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:15,290
It's... Stunning.

1098
01:00:25,910 --> 01:00:28,120
Well,I Suppose I Should Say Thank You.

1099
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:32,120
Oh,It's No Big Deal. You're Just Lucky I Was There.

1100
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:36,060
Was I Lucky, Or Were You Following Me?

1101
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:40,840
I Thought You Might Need My Help.

1102
01:00:41,890 --> 01:00:44,090
And You Were Right. I Did.

1103
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:46,150
You Just Think I'm Being Stubborn,Don't You?

1104
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:47,910
Making You Jump Through Hoops

1105
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:50,950
When It's So Clear We Belong Together.

1106
01:00:51,110 --> 01:00:52,890
I Don't Think Anything, Bree.

1107
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:54,480
I'm Just Trying To Be There For You

1108
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:58,330
And Hoping Eventually You'll Forgive Me.

1109
01:00:58,580 --> 01:00:59,550
But That's Just It,Orson.

1110
01:00:59,730 --> 01:01:00,400
If I Forgive You,

1111
01:01:00,570 --> 01:01:03,020
Then I'm Forgiving What You Did To Mike.

1112
01:01:03,190 --> 01:01:07,130
I Can't Do That. And- And You Wouldn't Want Me To.

1113
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:08,650
I Mean, Be Honest With Yourself.

1114
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:10,430
If I Took You Back Now,

1115
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,980
I Wouldn't Be The Woman You Love.

1116
01:01:13,150 --> 01:01:15,480
Then What Can I Do?

1117
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:17,310
I've Already Told You.

1118
01:01:17,470 --> 01:01:20,410
Turn Yourself In To The Police And Let Justice Run Its Course.

1119
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:22,430
I Can't Do That,Bree.

1120
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:26,340
<I>I Want To,</I>

1121
01:01:26,530 --> 01:01:29,550
For You, More Than Anything.

1122
01:01:30,050 --> 01:01:32,660
But I Don't Think I Could Survive It.

1123
01:01:33,370 --> 01:01:35,180
Well...

1124
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,470
So Here We Are.

1125
01:01:47,420 --> 01:01:49,260
<I>What Is This? It's Your Ice Sculpture.</I>

1126
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:50,520
No,It's Not.

1127
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:52,560
I See No Turrets. I See No Flags.

1128
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:53,840
I See No Moat Full Of Vodka.

1129
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,420
What I See Is A Giant,Icy Slap In The Face.

1130
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:01,010
Bob!

1131
01:02:04,610 --> 01:02:06,500
What's That?

1132
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:09,390
I Want To Be Able To Reach You This Summer

1133
01:02:09,570 --> 01:02:12,320
When You're Doing That Internship.

1134
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:15,580
You Changed Your Mind?

1135
01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:18,110
Here's The Thing.

1136
01:02:18,530 --> 01:02:19,690
You And I Have Always Had

1137
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:22,370
Kind Of An Unconventional Relationship,

1138
01:02:22,550 --> 01:02:24,230
And The Reason That Worked

1139
01:02:24,390 --> 01:02:27,580
Was Because We Always Tell Each Other The Truth...

1140
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:29,320
Until Yesterday.

1141
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:34,650
Julie,I Lied About Not Having Enough Money To Send You.

1142
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:36,180
Why?

1143
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:40,780
Because I Just Freaked Out About You Leaving.

1144
01:02:40,930 --> 01:02:42,660
But You Knew I Was Going Away To College.

1145
01:02:42,820 --> 01:02:44,060
<I>Yes,In The Fall.</I>

1146
01:02:44,230 --> 01:02:48,690
And I Needed Those Extra Three Months To Get Ready. I...

1147
01:02:49,810 --> 01:02:53,320
I Still Have Not Figured Out

1148
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:57,300
<I>How I'm Gonna Get By Without You.</I>

1149
01:02:58,860 --> 01:02:59,570
Mom...

1150
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:01,600
Seriously...

1151
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:07,470
I Just Lean On You In Ways You Don't Even Know.

1152
01:03:08,230 --> 01:03:09,820
I Think You Are Stronger

1153
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:11,740
Than You Give Yourself Credit For.

1154
01:03:11,910 --> 01:03:14,810
Well... I Spend More Time With Me Than You Do,

1155
01:03:14,990 --> 01:03:16,560
And I'm A Mess.

1156
01:03:16,730 --> 01:03:18,890
Well, You

1157
01:03:19,050 --> 01:03:20,120
I Had My Hands Full Then.

1158
01:03:20,290 --> 01:03:24,250
But You've Grown So Much These Last Five Years.

1159
01:03:24,410 --> 01:03:26,010
Really?

1160
01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:30,000
You Are A Secure, Confident Woman Now.

1161
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:32,110
You're Ready To Spread Your Wings And Fly.

1162
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:34,880
Frankly, My Work Here Is Done.

1163
01:03:35,620 --> 01:03:37,660
Thanks.

1164
01:03:37,810 --> 01:03:38,500
Now I Want You

1165
01:03:38,670 --> 01:03:41,420
To Have That Phone On You At All Times...

1166
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:45,300
Because I'm Still Not Sure How To Work The Dishwasher.

1167
01:03:50,250 --> 01:03:51,750
Can You Help Me?

1168
01:03:52,150 --> 01:03:53,990
For God Sake,Lee! It's Just An Ice Sculpture!

1169
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:56,770
<I>It Is Not "Just An Ice Sculpture"!</I>

1170
01:03:56,930 --> 01:03:59,220
It's The Sculpture And Making Me Move To The Suburbs

1171
01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:01,660
And Forcing Me To Be Nice To Your Homophobic Boss.

1172
01:04:01,810 --> 01:04:02,870
You Know What? Tom's Right.

1173
01:04:03,030 --> 01:04:06,560
<I>If I Don't Start Standing Up For Myself,I'm Doomed.</I>

1174
01:04:07,450 --> 01:04:10,480
I Don't Believe I Used The Word "Doomed."

1175
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:13,370
You're Always Overruling Me. You Treat Me Like A Child.

1176
01:04:13,530 --> 01:04:17,160
<I>Well,I've Had It! Ceremony's Off,Mein Fuhrer!</I>

1177
01:04:17,330 --> 01:04:20,690
It's A Chunk Of Ice, You Drama Queen!

1178
01:04:22,970 --> 01:04:24,480
Okay... All I Said Was-

1179
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:27,860
I Don't Care What You Said. We Have To Fix This!

1180
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:30,510
Or Do You Want To Tell Bree That You Torpedoed Her Ceremony?

1181
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:32,690
I Did Not Tell You To Put Mums In That Arrangement!

1182
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:36,890
<I>And Don't Point Your Finger At Me Or I'll Snap It Right Off. I'll Find Bob.</I>

1183
01:04:37,060 --> 01:04:38,660
I'll Get Lee. Yeah.

1184
01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:41,070
You Can't Make Me Talk To Him.

1185
01:04:41,230 --> 01:04:44,480
Yeah,I Can. Sit Down. Earlier,My Husband,

1186
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:46,770
In An Attempt To Help You With Your Relationship,

1187
01:04:46,930 --> 01:04:49,420
Mistakenly Gave You Some Advice,

1188
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:52,290
Which He Would Now Like To Take Back. Tom?

1189
01:04:52,630 --> 01:04:54,400
Actually,I Stand By Everything I Said.

1190
01:04:54,570 --> 01:04:56,640
My Mistake Was In Not Going Far Enough. What?

1191
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:59,310
If You're Willing To Break Up Over An Ice Sculpture,

1192
01:04:59,470 --> 01:05:02,300
You Guys Should Absolutely Not Get Married.

1193
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:04,010
Where The Hell Are You Going With This?

1194
01:05:04,180 --> 01:05:06,480
Because Who Gets To Choose The Ice Sculpture,

1195
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:07,930
Who Should Take Out The Trash,

1196
01:05:08,090 --> 01:05:11,020
Who Has To Stay Home And Make The Mini Pizzas-

1197
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:12,710
That's The Little Stuff.

1198
01:05:12,870 --> 01:05:16,130
What Are You Gonna Do When The Big Stuff Comes Along? Could You Give Us A Second?

1199
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:19,790
No. What Are You Gonna Do When A Tornado Hits Your House,

1200
01:05:19,950 --> 01:05:21,100
Or You Have Problems With Your Kids,

1201
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:24,500
Or One Of You Gets Cancer?

1202
01:05:25,150 --> 01:05:28,410
At Some Point,The Crap Is Going To Hit The Fan,

1203
01:05:28,570 --> 01:05:31,530
<I>And That Is Why Now, Before You Make The Commitment,</I>

1204
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,100
You Have To Ask Yourself,

1205
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:39,630
Is That Person In Bed Next To You Worth The Trouble?

1206
01:05:40,850 --> 01:05:44,130
Do You Love Him... Or Her So Much

1207
01:05:44,310 --> 01:05:48,040
That No Disease, No Disaster

1208
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:51,710
Could Possibly Pull You Apart?

1209
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:57,910
Answer Him.

1210
01:05:58,400 --> 01:05:59,820
Sure. Of Course I Do.

1211
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:00,930
Good.

1212
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:03,290
Good,Then...

1213
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:06,880
Get Out There And Get Committed, You Crazy Kids.

1214
01:06:26,990 --> 01:06:28,150
Oh,My God.

1215
01:06:28,310 --> 01:06:30,640
Are You Okay? You Need Some Help?

1216
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:32,330
Yes.

1217
01:06:35,330 --> 01:06:37,490
Thanks For Stopping.

1218
01:06:39,450 --> 01:06:41,930
Yes,Officer. I See You. Thank You For Coming.

1219
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:43,720
Now Remember, Ellie's Dangerous.

1220
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:47,800
So If She Shows Up,Feel Free To Use Excessive Force.

1221
01:06:49,310 --> 01:06:51,940
Carlos, Are You Almost Ready?

1222
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:55,350
Carlos?

1223
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:57,800
Did You Hear Me?

1224
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:02,970
I'm Just Getting My Jacket.

1225
01:07:11,580 --> 01:07:13,070
Oh,Honey,Can You Carry The House Keys?

1226
01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:15,250
They Don't Fit In My Purse.

1227
01:07:15,550 --> 01:07:17,720
Ellie's Upstairs.

1228
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:20,570
What?! She's In Our Bedroom. I Heard Her Breathing.

1229
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:23,670
Call The Cops. Wait! She's Gonna Steal Our Money!

1230
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:25,540
You Can't Go Up There. It's Too Dangerous.

1231
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:30,430
Well,Not As Dangerous As Poverty! Gaby.

1232
01:08:01,450 --> 01:08:03,320
Gaby? What's Going On?

1233
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:10,920
Aah! Carlos!

1234
01:08:11,090 --> 01:08:13,840
Carlos,Don't Just Stand There! Go Get Help!

1235
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:15,730
Help! Police!

1236
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:17,530
That's The Closet!

1237
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:19,990
Ow!

1238
01:08:22,870 --> 01:08:25,100
Police! Police!

1239
01:08:26,350 --> 01:08:28,310
Get In Here Now!

1240
01:08:49,970 --> 01:08:51,450
Wayne.

1241
01:08:52,470 --> 01:08:54,270
I Don't Think You've Thought This Through.

1242
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:55,860
Shut Up.

1243
01:08:56,030 --> 01:08:58,240
If I Tell You What Happened,

1244
01:08:58,780 --> 01:09:00,870
If I Don't Tell You...

1245
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:03,560
You're Gonna Kill Me Anyway.

1246
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:06,090
Who You Gonna Pin It On?

1247
01:09:10,310 --> 01:09:11,960
We Have History.

1248
01:09:12,130 --> 01:09:15,050
Right Now I'm Just Your Bitter,Crazy Ex.

1249
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:18,500
But If I Turn Up Dead, And You Have No Alibi-

1250
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:21,450
You Let Me Worry About That.

1251
01:09:30,950 --> 01:09:32,630
Look,I'm Having A Little Problem Right Now.

1252
01:09:32,790 --> 01:09:34,840
I Just Need To Hide Here For A Sec.

1253
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:38,690
And I Don't Wanna Hurt You, So Don't Make Me.

1254
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:40,740
All Right?

1255
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:44,260
Good.

1256
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:46,670
I'm Glad We Understand Each Other.

1257
01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:58,890
Huh.

1258
01:10:00,070 --> 01:10:02,580
<I>And With Your Gun,Too.</I>

1259
01:10:03,330 --> 01:10:05,810
I Guess I Just Found My Alibi.

1260
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:13,470
And Now We Will Do The Exchanging Of The Rings...

1261
01:10:13,650 --> 01:10:15,030
Snappy Ceremony,Bree.

1262
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:17,050
You And Katherine Really Did A Bang-Up Job.

1263
01:10:17,210 --> 01:10:18,490
<I>No,I Did A Bang-Up Job.</I>

1264
01:10:18,650 --> 01:10:21,130
Katherine Bailed On Me And Left Town Last Night.

1265
01:10:21,290 --> 01:10:23,380
I Think You Got Hosed. I Just Saw Her An Hour Ago.

1266
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:26,610
...Here At This Joyous And Festive Occasion.

1267
01:10:26,990 --> 01:10:28,820
Please Join Hands.

1268
01:10:30,670 --> 01:10:32,490
She Was On The Run, She Broke In,

1269
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:36,130
She Stabbed You, You Shot Her. Case Closed.

1270
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:40,050
It's Like The Alibi Fairy Left Me A Present.

1271
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:43,730
But I Do Wonder...

1272
01:10:44,030 --> 01:10:46,830
What If Dylan Doesn't Come Back?

1273
01:10:49,050 --> 01:10:50,760
We Had A Fight.

1274
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:55,630
She Said She Hated Me, Said She Was Leaving...

1275
01:10:55,900 --> 01:10:57,510
For Good.

1276
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:59,460
Is That The Best You Can Do,Kathy?

1277
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:04,210
I Know It Sounds Convenient. But What Happens If It's True?

1278
01:11:04,370 --> 01:11:07,390
Because You Don't Have Another Plan.

1279
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:12,060
She Was The Only Way You Could Make Me Tell You The Truth.

1280
01:11:18,490 --> 01:11:22,730
<I>Katherine? It's Bree. We Need To Talk Now!</I>

1281
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:29,630
That Girl That Was Living With The Solises?

1282
01:11:29,780 --> 01:11:33,580
Actually,I Thought I Saw Her Heading Down That Way.

1283
01:11:33,740 --> 01:11:35,380
Hope You Find Her.

1284
01:11:35,810 --> 01:11:36,400
I'd Hate To Think

1285
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:39,560
There Was Some Maniac Running Around Our Neighborhood.

1286
01:11:44,890 --> 01:11:46,270
I'm So Sorry About This.

1287
01:11:46,430 --> 01:11:47,880
Shut It!

1288
01:11:48,050 --> 01:11:49,970
So Let Me Catch You Up.

1289
01:11:50,130 --> 01:11:52,810
I Need To Know Something That Only My Ex-Wife Can Tell Me,

1290
01:11:52,970 --> 01:11:54,820
But She Doesn't Want To. She Needs A Little Incentive.

1291
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:59,430
So That's Where You Come In. Wayne... Please Don't.

1292
01:11:59,590 --> 01:12:02,410
Yeah? How Is It Gonna Feel Knowing...

1293
01:12:02,580 --> 01:12:05,140
That You Could've Stopped This?

1294
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:12,280
All Right!

1295
01:12:15,140 --> 01:12:17,140
I'll Tell You.

1296
01:12:24,690 --> 01:12:27,010
After I Left You...

1297
01:12:28,070 --> 01:12:30,950
A Few Months Passed,

1298
01:12:31,110 --> 01:12:34,370
And I Convinced Myself

1299
01:12:34,660 --> 01:12:37,410
That You'd Forgotten About Us.

1300
01:12:37,660 --> 01:12:39,630
But I Was Wrong.

1301
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:45,580
How Was Dylan? Did She Behave Herself?

1302
01:12:45,740 --> 01:12:47,180
She's An Angel.

1303
01:12:48,270 --> 01:12:51,240
I... Just Hope I Didn't Do Something Wrong.

1304
01:12:51,410 --> 01:12:54,560
What Do You Mean? Well,Your Ex-Husband Was Here Earlier,

1305
01:12:54,730 --> 01:12:56,320
And,Of Course, I Didn't Know It Was Him

1306
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:58,860
Until Dylan Called Him "Daddy."

1307
01:12:59,550 --> 01:13:01,430
I- I'm Sorry, I Should've Called You,

1308
01:13:01,590 --> 01:13:03,310
But Dylan Was Just So Happy To See Him.

1309
01:13:03,470 --> 01:13:05,170
He Brought Her A Bicycle And A Doll.

1310
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:08,290
And She Won't Let That Doll Out Of Her Sight.

1311
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,810
Katherine,What's Going On?

1312
01:13:12,630 --> 01:13:14,260
<I>I Was Going To Run Again,</I>

1313
01:13:14,410 --> 01:13:16,790
<I>But You Didn't Give Me Enough Time.</I>

1314
01:13:18,030 --> 01:13:19,740
Wayne Just Drove Up.

1315
01:13:19,910 --> 01:13:22,220
Should We Call The Police?

1316
01:13:22,460 --> 01:13:23,710
No.

1317
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:26,510
Let Him In.

1318
01:13:29,610 --> 01:13:31,760
<I>I Knew It Was Time To Face You</I>

1319
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:34,430
<I>And Let You Know You Were Not Welcome In My Home,</I>

1320
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:36,720
<I>And Neither Were Your Gifts.</I>

1321
01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:50,990
Do You Know How Much Money I Spent Looking For You? Well,I'm Sure

1322
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:53,810
You Still Had Enough To Buy Liquor By The Caseload.

1323
01:13:53,980 --> 01:13:57,470
Wow! Look Who's Gotten Sassy While She's Been Away.

1324
01:13:57,630 --> 01:13:59,640
Well,I Think I Like It. What Do You Want,Wayne?

1325
01:13:59,790 --> 01:14:03,460
I Want My Daughter Back. Why? You Gotten Lazy In Your Old Age?

1326
01:14:03,610 --> 01:14:05,130
You Need Somebody Smaller To Pound On?

1327
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:06,830
I Never Touched A Hair On Her Head!

1328
01:14:06,990 --> 01:14:10,130
<I>Yeah,But Now She's Gotten Older And Sassier,</I>

1329
01:14:10,290 --> 01:14:13,050
I'm Sure You'll Find All Sorts Of Reasons To Hit Her. I Don't Have To Ask,You Know.

1330
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:16,330
I Could Just Go Up There If I Want. She Is Asleep! Get The Hell Out!

1331
01:14:16,490 --> 01:14:19,000
I'm Her Father! I Said No!

1332
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:27,650
Uhh. Aah.

1333
01:14:31,070 --> 01:14:32,040
I'm Bleeding.

1334
01:14:32,210 --> 01:14:33,830
Profusely.

1335
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,190
You Should See A Doctor.

1336
01:14:43,030 --> 01:14:44,730
I'll Be Back For My Daughter.

1337
01:14:44,900 --> 01:14:46,640
You Just Understand This-

1338
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:48,850
<I>There Is Nothing That I Will Not Do</I>

1339
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:52,470
<I>To Keep You Away From Her. Nothing.</I>

1340
01:14:58,470 --> 01:14:59,370
Are You All Right?

1341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh!

1342
01:14:59,530 --> 01:15:02,850
I Heard A Crash. Yeah,I-I Hit Him With The Candlestick,

1343
01:15:03,010 --> 01:15:05,100
And... He Went Down Pretty Hard.

1344
01:15:05,270 --> 01:15:06,920
Thank God.

1345
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:09,350
You Know,I Think Now Would Be A Good Time To Break Out

1346
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:12,950
The 10-Year-Old Scotch I've Been Saving.

1347
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:18,660
<I>I Honestly Thought It Was Finally Over.</I>

1348
01:15:18,810 --> 01:15:22,090
<I>I Don't Know How I Could've Been So Wrong.</I>

1349
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:28,770
Katherine!

1350
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:34,240
I Came In To Give Her Another Blanket.

1351
01:15:34,810 --> 01:15:37,850
Her Hand Is Ice-Cold!

1352
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:47,380
<I>Aunt Lily Told Me I Couldn't Go To The Police.</I>

1353
01:15:47,530 --> 01:15:48,870
<I>She'd Said You'd Make It Seem</I>

1354
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:52,280
<I>Like I Killed Dylan To Keep You From Taking Her,</I>

1355
01:15:52,450 --> 01:15:55,530
<I>So I Let Her Bury My Baby In The Woods.</I>

1356
01:15:55,700 --> 01:15:57,550
<I>I Knew I'd Have To Run Away Again,</I>

1357
01:15:57,720 --> 01:16:00,410
<I>But I Also Knew You'd Never Stop Looking For Me,</I>

1358
01:16:00,580 --> 01:16:02,660
<I>So I Came Up With A Plan.</I>

1359
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:04,520
<I>I Found A Girl In A Romanian Orphanage</I>

1360
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:06,830
<I>Who Looked Just Like Dylan.</I>

1361
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,820
<I>The Resemblance Was Uncanny.</I>

1362
01:16:08,990 --> 01:16:10,760
<I>Her Mother Had Died In Childbirth,</I>

1363
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:13,470
<I>And Her Father Had Been Murdered.</I>

1364
01:16:13,630 --> 01:16:15,790
<I>As I Looked Into Those Big,Blue Eyes,</I>

1365
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:17,690
<I>I Knew Right Then...</I>

1366
01:16:17,850 --> 01:16:21,170
<I>She Needed Me As Much As I Needed Her.</I>

1367
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:34,220
I've Never Told That To Anyone.

1368
01:16:34,550 --> 01:16:35,280
I Even Lied To Adam

1369
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:37,630
And Said It Was Your Fault.

1370
01:16:37,990 --> 01:16:41,470
And That's How I've Spent The Last 12 Years...

1371
01:16:41,730 --> 01:16:45,350
Just Telling One Lie After Another.

1372
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:50,360
Hold It,Hold It. I'm Sorry,Sir.

1373
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:52,390
We're Having A Party. You Can't Park Here.

1374
01:16:53,250 --> 01:16:55,770
So You Let Her Die.

1375
01:16:58,410 --> 01:16:59,220
If You Don't Mind,

1376
01:16:59,390 --> 01:17:02,350
I Need You To Park Around The Corner,Okay?

1377
01:17:03,130 --> 01:17:05,090
Thank You!

1378
01:17:12,970 --> 01:17:16,170
You Let My Daughter Die...

1379
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:18,140
Like A Dog.

1380
01:17:18,370 --> 01:17:20,300
It Was An Accident.

1381
01:17:20,460 --> 01:17:23,360
Then You Buried Her Like One.

1382
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:25,600
Because I Had To.

1383
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:27,500
I Knew If You Found Out,Y-

1384
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:31,180
That I Would Kill You.

1385
01:17:41,890 --> 01:17:44,520
Katherine! Where Are You?!

1386
01:17:44,750 --> 01:17:45,460
Adam!

1387
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:47,850
Get Out! He's Got A Gun!

1388
01:18:16,090 --> 01:18:17,380
You Just Watch Over Him For A Sec,Okay?

1389
01:18:17,550 --> 01:18:18,930
I'm Gonna Call The Cops.

1390
01:18:19,090 --> 01:18:22,060
First We Have To Do Something To Stop That Bleeding. Okay.

1391
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:34,160
Go Ahead. You Call The Cops.

1392
01:18:34,810 --> 01:18:37,410
Ask For My Buddy Romslo...

1393
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:40,520
Or Captain Mcmurphy.

1394
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:43,990
We Play Softball Together.

1395
01:18:44,780 --> 01:18:47,180
Those Guys'll Take Care Of Me.

1396
01:18:47,810 --> 01:18:50,530
And Even If I Do A Little Time...

1397
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:54,330
You Know This Isn't Over.

1398
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:57,170
I'll Get Out And I'll Find You,

1399
01:18:58,250 --> 01:19:00,540
And I'll Make You Pay.

1400
01:19:01,010 --> 01:19:03,510
I Know You Will.

1401
01:19:30,340 --> 01:19:33,410
Oh,My God! Bree,Are You All Right? What The Hell Is Going On?!

1402
01:19:33,570 --> 01:19:35,630
We Don't Have Much Time Before The Police Get Here.

1403
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:37,840
We Need To Talk.

1404
01:19:39,980 --> 01:19:41,450
Excuse Me.

1405
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:43,920
Susan! Come Here,Come Here.

1406
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:46,640
What's Going On? Okay,Just Listen To Me.

1407
01:19:51,070 --> 01:19:52,900
Ma'am, You Have To Talk To Us.

1408
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:55,740
We Need To Know What Happened.

1409
01:19:56,020 --> 01:19:57,450
Ma'am?

1410
01:19:58,730 --> 01:20:01,550
Then He Raised The Gun And Came Toward Us.

1411
01:20:01,710 --> 01:20:04,330
Thank God Katherine Grabbed His Arm And Got The Gun Away.

1412
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:07,390
That Lunatic Would've Killed Us All.

1413
01:20:07,740 --> 01:20:09,630
I Knew Wayne Was The Reason She Moved Away,

1414
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:13,300
And The Second She Moved Back, He Started Stalking Her Again.

1415
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:16,500
She Was Always Telling Us How Terrified She Was.

1416
01:20:16,740 --> 01:20:19,200
We Always Knew He'd Do Something Like This Eventually,

1417
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:21,170
And He Did.

1418
01:20:30,310 --> 01:20:31,840
Look...

1419
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,300
This Was Obviously Self-Defense.

1420
01:20:34,460 --> 01:20:37,520
Take The Cuffs Off, Get Her To The Hospital.

1421
01:20:55,310 --> 01:20:56,440
Mom?

1422
01:20:56,740 --> 01:20:57,670
Mom!

1423
01:20:57,830 --> 01:20:59,250
Oh,My!

1424
01:20:59,890 --> 01:21:02,070
I'm So Sorry,Mom.

1425
01:21:12,010 --> 01:21:14,170
five years later

1426
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:18,710
<I>There's A Ritual</I>

1427
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:21,240
<I>My Friends Have Observed For Years.</I>

1428
01:21:21,410 --> 01:21:23,740
<I>Once A Week,They Meet To Play A Game Of Cards</I>

1429
01:21:23,900 --> 01:21:26,120
<I>And Talk About Their Lives.</I>

1430
01:21:26,290 --> 01:21:29,030
<I>Of Course,There's Another Aspect To These Gatherings</I>

1431
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:32,670
<I>That Has Nothing To Do With Gossip Or Poker.</I>

1432
01:21:32,830 --> 01:21:35,610
<I>Every Seven Days, My Friends Are Reminded</I>

1433
01:21:35,770 --> 01:21:38,010
<I>Of A Basic Human Truth-</I>

1434
01:21:38,170 --> 01:21:42,500
<I>There Is Nothing More Important Than Friendships That Endure,</I>

1435
01:21:42,670 --> 01:21:47,020
<I>Especially In A World That Insists On Changing.</I>

1436
01:21:47,450 --> 01:21:49,850
Okay,My Friends Are Gone.

1437
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:52,620
I'm Ready To Fix You Dinner.

1438
01:21:53,470 --> 01:21:55,450
What The Hell Are You Doing?!

1439
01:21:55,640 --> 01:21:58,660
Hey,Mommy, We're Playing Fashion Model!

1440
01:21:58,860 --> 01:22:01,070
Look At This Mess!

1441
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:04,920
You Are Lucky I Got In Here Before You Touched My Dresses!

1442
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:07,140
Run,Celia,Run!

1443
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:10,280
My Vera Wang?!

1444
01:22:12,550 --> 01:22:13,930
I'm Home!

1445
01:22:14,090 --> 01:22:15,600
Oh,Thank God.

1446
01:22:15,830 --> 01:22:17,340
The Publisher Sent Over The Galley For The Cookbook.

1447
01:22:17,510 --> 01:22:19,070
He Needs You To Proof Them Tonight.

1448
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:20,800
I've Also Got The Woman From "The New York Times"

1449
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:25,310
On The Phone. She Wants To Do The Interview Now. Is That You,Bree? The Water's Getting Cold.

1450
01:22:25,490 --> 01:22:26,900
Uh,Leave The Galleys In My Office And Tell

1451
01:22:27,060 --> 01:22:29,350
The Woman From "The Times" To Call Me Back In The Morning.

1452
01:22:29,510 --> 01:22:32,440
I'm Gonna Have A Nice Bubble Bath With My Husband.

1453
01:22:32,610 --> 01:22:34,900
Coming,Orson!

1454
01:22:36,550 --> 01:22:39,260
Why Is There A Police Car In Our Driveway?

1455
01:22:39,430 --> 01:22:41,090
I Was Telling Your Husband We Just Picked Up Your Son.

1456
01:22:41,260 --> 01:22:44,280
He Broke Into A Car At The Mall And Took It For A Joyride.

1457
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:47,820
Again? I Am So Sorry,Officer.

1458
01:22:47,980 --> 01:22:50,300
We Have Talked To Porter Till We're Blue In The Face.

1459
01:22:50,470 --> 01:22:53,430
It's Like He's Determined To Go Back To Juvenile Hall.

1460
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:56,120
Honey,It Wasn't Porter This Time.

1461
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:58,820
They Arrested Preston.

1462
01:23:01,460 --> 01:23:03,820
<I>It's Me,Mom. I'm Back From Paris.</I>

1463
01:23:03,990 --> 01:23:06,460
<I>It Was Just As Gorgeous As You Said It Would Be,</I>

1464
01:23:06,620 --> 01:23:07,860
<I>And You're Not Gonna Believe This.</I>

1465
01:23:08,030 --> 01:23:09,580
<I>Bradley Finally Asked Me To Marry Him</I>

1466
01:23:09,750 --> 01:23:11,730
<I>Right There Under The Eiffel Tower.</I>

1467
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:14,480
<I>I'm So Happy. Call Me Back.</I>

1468
01:23:19,730 --> 01:23:22,420
Honey? I'm Home.

1469
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,720
Did You Miss Me?

1470
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:28,650
You Know I Did.

1471
01:23:28,820 --> 01:23:29,650
Mmm.

1472
01:23:29,820 --> 01:23:31,790
