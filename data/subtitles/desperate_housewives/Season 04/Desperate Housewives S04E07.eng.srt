1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,520
Previously on Desperate Housewives...

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,550
Danielle had her baby...

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:06,460
...on halloween.

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,600
You said my father didn't care about me.

5
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,560
Katherine revealed a secret.

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,810
I want you to imagine the worst thing

7
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,410
That a father can do to his daughter.

8
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,489
Lynette got great news.

9
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:18,440
I got the test results back. You're clean.

10
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,340
While Mike tried to ease his pain,

11
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:24,470
Victor... You know what my dream is?

12
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,700
...reached out to Gaby . You.

13
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,390
Don't run away, Gaby . But if you do, take me with you.

14
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:33,470
And Edie got revenge.

15
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,210
Don't take it all out on Gaby .

16
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,350
Carlos decided to make a fool out of you.

17
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,240
The thing you need to know about Victor Lang 

18
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,010
Is that he was not above using deception.

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,299
Whether it was an insincere promise

20
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,790
To a campaign donor,

21
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:59,020
Or the artful evasion of a reporter's question,

22
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,090
Or an outright lie to his constituents,

23
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:06,800
Victor did what he had to to get what he wanted.

24
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,790
But thanks to some compromising photos,

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,350
He learned that his wife

26
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:16,010
Knew a little something about deception as well.

27
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:28,870
For the last time, Carlos , stop calling me.

28
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,090
I told you, i just w Ann a talk.

29
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,169
And i told you it's over. So what,

30
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:36,069
You're just gonna go back to that chicken-lipped albino? I don't know.

31
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,600
I'm taking it one day at a time.

32
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,549
But what i can say about Victor is

33
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:42,390
He doesn't lie to me about how much money he's got. Look,

34
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,860
I said i was sorry.

35
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:48,800
Oh, that's great. Yeah, well, i-i gotta go, Bree .

37
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:51,600
It's Bree .

38
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,129
Okay, so i just informed my staff

39
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,530
That i'm taking the next month off

40
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,890
To give my wife the honeymoon she always wanted.

41
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,559
That's amazing. Where should we go? Well,

42
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,429
I left some travel magazines in the bedroom.

43
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,390
Why don't you go get 'em? Oh!

44
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,379
Oh, my god, Victor .

45
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,810
A month in rio sounds like heaven, doesn't it?

46
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,650
Oh, it does. Let's do it. Ooh!

47
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,080
Hey, why don't we kick off our reconciliation

48
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:31,780
With a little weekend on the boat?

49
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,370
That's so romantic. I love that. Huh?

50
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,050
Just you and me, all alone, out in the middle of the ocean.

51
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,619
The girls are gonna be so jea Lou s.

52
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,690
Oh, no, no, no, let's not tell anyone we're going.

53
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,250
It'll be our little secret.

54
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,999
Yes, Victor was not above

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,830
Using deception to get what he wanted,

56
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,330
And what he wanted now

57
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:55,880
Was revenge.

58
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,860
The next day on Wisteria Lane began with a bit of deceit.

59
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,609
Bree Hodge told her friends

60
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,000
She had given birth in the middle of the night

61
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,870
To a beautiful baby boy.

62
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:24,490
And thanks to the healthy lungs of Benjamin Tyson Hodge ,

63
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,370
It didn't take long for Bree 's friends

64
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,680
To engage in some deceit of their own.

65
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,180
Well, he's just a little piece of heaven.

66
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:38,280
You're so blessed. Makes me w Ann a have another one myself.

67
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,549
Orson, you better take Benjamin to the other room

68
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:43,059
Before my friends run out of lies. Ah.

69
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:43,960
No.

70
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,580
They don't appreciate a healthy pair of lungs, that's all, huh?

71
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,039
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Come on, Benjamin .

72
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,900
Hey, Lynette , you tell everyone your news? No. This is about the baby.

73
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,759
Wait. Did you have that final scan?

74
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,749
Did you hear something? Well, the results are back,

75
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,529
And while you can never actually say you're cured--

76
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,239
She's cured!

77
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,210
Oh, my god! Oh, yeah!

78
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,279
I have to get checked every six months,

79
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,470
But, yes, the doctor is very optimistic.

80
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,690
Hey, what the hell is all this racket?

81
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,470
Someone win the lotto?

82
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:16,000
Oh, i was just telling everybody the good news about my...

83
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,690
Cancer.

84
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,690
Hey, congrats!

85
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,380
I'm a survivor myself.

86
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:25,620
Prostate.

87
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,850
Ooh, muffins.

88
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,310
Hey, show some class. Introduce yourself.

89
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,870
Hi. I'm Stan .

90
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,280
Is th--is that my robe?

91
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,650
Yeah. Sorry, uh...

92
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,199
If i knew when i walked into that card club last night

93
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,550
That i would be going home with this lovely lady,

94
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,730
I'd have packed me a change of clothes.

95
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,790
Okay, i get it. We'll get out of your hair.

96
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,780
Come on, handsome. Let's take a shower.

98
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,180
Mike, how long are you gonna be?

99
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,080
We've gotta get this food over to Bree 's before it gets cold.

100
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,619
You know, Susan , i don't feel like going over there tonight.

101
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:15,300
Can't you just drop it off? No, they just had a baby.

102
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:18,130
We're gonna "ooh," we're gonna "ahh," and then we're gonna eat.

103
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,090
But i'm tired.

104
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,770
I worked all day. I got a job first thing in the morning.

105
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,350
There's no way out of it, Mike .

106
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,020
Just do what you need and downstairs.

107
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,620
This is what we do in the suburbs.

108
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:36,420
Ah, yes...

109
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:38,880
The suburbs.

110
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,600
And how does Danielle like her baby brother?

111
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,399
Oh, she adores him.

112
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,310
She just felt terrible that she had to leave for school so soon.

114
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,119
Speaking of which, we have some extra preschool applications

115
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,750
If the two of you are interested.

116
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,559
Isn't it a little early to be talking preschool?

117
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,939
She just got pregnant. Our baby still looks like a sea horse. Oh, honey.

118
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,100
You'd be surprised how fast the best schools fill up.

119
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,060
And only the best for our kid, right?

120
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:08,559
I'd start saving your pennies.

121
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,770
Bonny briar's up to $10,000 a year.

122
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,230
10,000 dollars...

123
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,490
For used legos and a potty chair?

124
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,410
And you'd better apply now.

125
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,079
Debbie gottlieb had her baby the same day i did,

126
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,539
And she could only get wait-listed

127
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,290
At her first three choices.

128
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,500
Oh, by the way, we were invited to her bris this saturday.

129
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,020
Well, make an excuse for me. I thought you liked Debbie and Lou .

130
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:31,720
Oh, i do.

131
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,430
I just don't care to watch them ritually mutilate their child.

132
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:36,880
More moo shu, please.

133
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,669
Circumcision's not mutilation.

134
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,259
It's a simple surgery

135
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,470
Meant to promote lifelong masculine hygiene.

136
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,660
It's a, uh, traumatic procedure

137
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:49,459
Which reduces the male's capacity for sexual pleasure

138
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,469
By desensitizing the tip of--

139
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,000
We know what it is.

140
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,459
Gee, i don't think i've ever heard

141
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:00,110
Such strong opinions on the subject.

142
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,060
I mean, not that it's something i talk about a lot...

143
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:04,710
Or ever.

144
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:08,200
I hope i didn't offend you.

145
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,750
I haven't heard a word since "$10,000."

146
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:15,580
It's just that i remember my own circumcision so vividly.

147
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,160
Oh, that's ridicu Lou s.

148
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,610
My parents disagreed on this issue, too.

149
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,930
My dad said no.

150
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,909
So mother just bided her time

151
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:29,160
Until he finally left town on business.

152
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:30,940
I was 5.

154
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,370
She told me we were going for ice cream.

155
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:41,359
That's why the procedure should be done on babies.

156
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,360
They won't remember.

157
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,580
Now can we please just drop this?

158
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:46,750
Fine.

159
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,560
So, Susan ,

160
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:54,560
You mentioned something about bringing dessert.

161
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:55,300
What is it?

163
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,740
Ice cream.

164
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:01,640
Sorry.

165
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,370
Oh, so you found the chocolate sauce?

166
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,750
Oh, uh, yeah, it's right here.

167
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:15,780
Is everything okay? Oh, yeah. I was just taking a couple of aspirin.

168
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,989
I hope Orson 's rant didn't give you a headache.

169
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:20,359
Oh, no, i've just still got a little pain from my accident,

170
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,069
That's all. Still? That was nearly two years ago.

171
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,100
Well, it's just a twinge every now and then.

172
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,260
Aspirin does the trick.

173
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,150
No, no, no, no. I'll get that.

174
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,320
I thought you kept your boat at the yacht club.

175
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,419
Yeah, i wanted to leave from here.

176
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:52,750
This way, we avoid the congestion at the marina. Where's the crew?

177
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,120
There's no crew. I let 'em go.

178
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:56,280
What?

179
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,089
Who's gonna bring us umbr Ella drinks

180
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,540
And salute us when we walk by?

181
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:02,470
Just consider me your one-man navy.

182
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,839
So you're gonna drive this thing by yourself? Well, you can help.

183
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,870
Didn't that captain give you lessons last summer?

184
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,350
Oh, that's right--

185
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:12,550
Those two boring hours i'll never get back.

186
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,670
Well, the good news is this trip will be anything but boring.

189
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:31,960
We need to talk about this Stan thing.

190
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,290
Oh, is that his name? Stan?

191
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:37,910
Uh, when he left, i just sort of said, "see ya."

192
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,789
Well, it got me thinking

193
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,799
About how much you've had to put your life on hold

194
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,960
These past few months. No big deal.

195
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,759
No, it was a big deal.

196
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,049
You have taken amazing care of me.

197
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:54,380
But i know you have so many things you w Ann a get back to.

198
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,710
Mm, not really.

199
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,499
Come on. It must be driving you crazy

200
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,779
Living with five screaming kids underfoot.

201
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:04,210
I don't blame you for wanting a little peace and quiet.

202
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,500
You need to leave, mom.

203
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:09,880
Okay.

204
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,690
Okay, i-i know i shouldn't have brought...

205
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:14,520
Stan into the house.

206
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:17,790
And next time, i promise you we will do it in the car.

207
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,789
It's not just that.

208
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:23,250
It's the smoking and the swearing

209
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,870
And the teaching the kids how to make a whiskey sour.

210
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,920
It's a science, Lynette .

211
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,750
It's called mixology.

212
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,349
I just think it would work better for everyone

213
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:33,520
If you got your own place.

214
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:36,430
Okay. With what money?

215
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:37,739
You have money, right?

216
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,910
I mean, you loaned us that $10,000.

217
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,110
Yes, i did.

218
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,040
Wait a minute.

219
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,780
That was all the money you had?

220
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:52,020
You guys needed it, and i needed a place to stay.

221
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,900
It seemed like it turned out pretty well for everybody.

222
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,900
What do you mean? I thought you were living with Lucy .

223
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,860
Your sister kicked me out.

224
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,160
Not to put too fine a point on it, Lynette ,

225
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,090
But your cancer couldn't have come at a better time.

226
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,690
Hey, i need your help with a school thing.

227
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,840
Wow. You never ask for my help. Must be something easy.

228
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,300
What do you know about Dylan 's dad?

229
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,959
We've got this genealogy project for school,

230
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,380
And she wants to find out about him.

231
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,330
Maybe Dylan should ask her mom.

232
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,560
She gets really weird talking about him.

233
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,570
Why is that, by the way?

234
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,820
Okay, don't tell anybody i told you this.

235
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,169
Her mom said something at my party

236
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,470
About her dad being abusive towards Katherine ...

237
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,030
And maybe Dylan , too.

238
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,590
Oh. So i'm thinking that it would be better

239
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,350
If you could get her to research somebody else in her family.

240
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,390
Yeah.

241
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,160
Maybe you're right.

242
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:55,179
Listen, i-i was talking to my mom, and--

243
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:55,840
Yeah.

244
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:58,480
I heard.

245
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,460
Susan? Hi. It's, uh, Bree . I'm glad you're home.

246
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:16,780
Uh,  listen, i-i thought i might stop by for a little visit.

248
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:26,120
Look, i've only got, uh, about an hour before my next job.

249
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,959
Uh, is it okay if i grab lunch in front of the tv?

250
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,139
I wanted to watch the game. Oh, sure. I'll--i'll bring up a tray.

251
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,050
Oh, thanks.

252
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:35,580
Bree thinks you're doing drugs.

253
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:40,590
She found this on her kitchen floor,

254
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,240
And it's not aspirin.

255
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,370
Well, you know, my shoulder's been hurting lately.

256
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:48,110
She says it's a narcotic, and it's highly addictive.

257
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,569
Given your history--

258
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:52,209
Whoa, whoa, Susan , these--these were prescribed by a doctor

259
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,390
Right after my accident.

260
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,129
I found a couple in the medicine cabinet,

261
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:56,140
And i've been carrying 'em around

262
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,630
In case my shoulder acts up. Really?

263
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,000
Yeah.  Really. They were the last two.

264
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,740
So you got nothing to worry about.

265
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:07,840
Oh, thank god!  You have no idea where my mind went.

266
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,830
I had you roaming back alleys to score your dope,

267
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,290
Pawning our good silver to pay your dealer.

268
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,219
And we don't even have good silver,

269
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,409
So it got worse 'cause you had to knock over a gas station

270
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:19,630
To buy the silver to pawn it off.

271
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,850
I was really making myself crazy.

272
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,460
I'm sorry about that.

273
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:26,500
But i reiterate-- old pill, no problem.

274
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,680
I knew it. I'm so happy.

275
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:30,550
Mmm. Good.

276
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,180
Mm, now fix me some lunch, woman.

277
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,720
Oh! I w Ann a watch the damn game.

278
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,170
Can i help you?

279
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,379
Yes, um, can you tell me who i would talk to

280
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,410
About having my baby circumcised?

281
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,730
What do you mean you can't help me?

282
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:55,689
I received a registered letter from your husband which reads,

283
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:58,439
"i do not wish for my son, Benjamin Hodge ,

284
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,620
"to be circumcised.

285
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:02,430
Should the recipient of this letter encounter my wife..."

286
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,609
"please feel free to show her this letter

287
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,659
"and assure her of its wide distribution

288
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,950
"to hospitals and physicians

289
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,190
Across this and two neighboring states."

290
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,970
Does this seem too warm to you?

291
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:15,240
That you even felt such a thing was necessary.

292
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:18,460
Well, obviously, it was. Forgive me for knowing my wife.

293
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:21,940
What's that supposed to mean? You don't trust me?

294
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:24,080
I trust you not to break your word.

295
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,400
Since you've pointedly refused to give it,

296
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,420
I trusted you to snip first and debate the merits later.

297
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,520
I'm only thinking of Benjamin . Be reasonable.

298
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:34,310
You're the one who's unreasonable.

299
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:37,210
What have you got against untrimmed penises?

300
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:39,530
They're... Unsightly.

301
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,480
I do not want our son to be teased...

302
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,760
For being different. Do you?

303
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,270
Ah, so in the end,

304
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:50,519
It all comes down to tradition and conformity.

305
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,209
What is wrong with that? I thought we liked conformity.

306
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:56,850
Not at the price of pain and reduced sexual pleasure.

307
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,229
I can tell you someone whose sexual pleasure

308
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:02,150
Is going to be reduced big-time!

309
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:05,860
Hey, sweetheart.

310
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:08,930
What's that?

311
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,590
Just something for school.

312
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:16,510
What was that name you just typed in?

313
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,450
We were assigned a genealogy project.

314
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,100
I have to do research on my father.

315
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,080
I will call your tea Cher .

316
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:28,820
She'll assign you a different project.

317
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,680
What do you think you're doing?

318
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,910
I am learning about my father.

319
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,119
Dylan! For years, you have told me

320
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,460
That my father is too evil to talk about.

321
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,539
Now i find out you've discussed him

322
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,940
At a neighborhood game night?!

323
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:49,320
Regardless, i am still your mother,

324
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:51,080
And while you're under my roof,

325
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,350
You will obey my rules.

326
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:55,260
And what if i don't?

327
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:59,220
Are you gonna slap me again, kick me out of the house?

328
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,400
Go ahead. Try it. See what happens.

329
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:04,680
I'm sorry, mom.

330
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,850
You can't stop me this time.

331
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:12,530
I am officially no longer afraid of you.

332
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,339
And he needed something for the pain, so he happened to find

333
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,069
The last two pills in the medicine cabinet,

334
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:26,040
And he took 'em.

335
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:28,270
It's no big deal.

336
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,440
Let me show you something.

337
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,490
You see this breadmaker?

338
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:35,549
This is where i hid a bottle of chardonnay

339
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:37,620
After i told everyone i'd stopped drinking.

340
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:39,720
Oh, but this isn't the same thing.

341
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,710
Mike wouldn't lie to me about this.

343
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,980
And this rotating spice rack?

344
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,919
Those little airplane bottles of vodka

345
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,550
Fit perfectly in the back.

346
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,480
He said there were no more pills.

347
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:56,710
I was looking him in the eye.

348
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,380
Susan, addicts are experts at deception.

349
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:02,190
My advice to you--

350
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:03,880
Trust...

351
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,670
But verify.

352
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:57,020
So... This is nice--

353
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,980
Little family get-together.

354
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:02,650
Why didn't you call Lucy ?

355
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:05,280
Oh, you know her, always busy.

356
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:10,240
So, mom... You look good.

357
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,700
Thanks. You seeing anybody?

358
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:16,310
Not that i w Ann a tell you about.

359
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,200
Mm, still alone.

360
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:21,510
Ooh, look. The special is chicken.

361
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,060
Doesn't that sound good? Ooh, order me one.

362
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:28,540
I-i'm going to the bar and-- and check the score on the game. Have fun.

363
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,620
I know what this is, and i'm not doing it.

364
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,960
What? What? We're having lunch. She's not moving back in.

365
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,240
I resist your attempts to manipulate me.

366
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,009
Nobody is manipulating you.

367
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:40,219
My boundaries are strong.

368
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,430
I know what i want, and i deserve to be happy.

369
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:45,870
What have you got there? Are you reading from something?

370
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:46,930
Okay!

371
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,500
As soon as you invited me to lunch,

372
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,880
I called my therapist.

373
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:51,929
And he told me

374
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,150
You'd try to guilt me into taking mom back, but...

375
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,699
"i will not be emotionally blackmailed."

376
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,430
Give me that.

377
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,730
I already had her, Lynette .

378
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:03,640
She stayed with me for two years--

379
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,990
Two years in which my weight ballooned.

380
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,049
She put me through four different hairstyles.

381
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:12,190
Once, she even brought home this guy she met at a bar.

382
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,479
She's so not like that now.

383
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,460
I don't care.

384
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,749
The day she moved out, i got my life back.

385
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:22,400
So if you w Ann a have lunch, fine.

386
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,090
But that's it.

387
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,320
Okay. Okay.

388
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:27,900
Okay.

389
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:39,830
Good for you.

390
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:43,340
I'm sorry.

391
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:51,979
Where's the chicken?

392
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:55,880
Oh, yeah. Where is that waiter? I'm gonna go find him.

393
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,220
Just hear me out.

394
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:05,069
If you trim the sides in a little,

395
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,810
I think you'll lose that wingy effect you have going now.

396
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:09,830
Mom!

397
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,490
Well, i'm just saying that with the shape of your face,

398
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,969
You're not doing yourself any favors. Do you think

399
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:17,540
You could go for one minute without being critical?

400
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,700
What are you talking about?

401
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,890
I have not said one word about your eye shadow yet.

402
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,140
"i reject your negativity.

403
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,410
I am as beautiful as i feel inside."

404
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,330
Oh, it's you.

405
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,570
Thank you for calling about my painting.

406
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,220
I can't believe i forgot that.

407
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,120
Yeah, i know it meant a lot to you.

408
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,460
There's a hole in it.

409
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:49,780
Yeah, i don't get modern art either.

410
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,420
Okay, Edie ...

411
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,259
I know that you're angry right now, but--

412
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,500
You think i'm angry?

413
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:58,390
You should've seen Victor .

414
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:00,660
What?

415
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,540
Yeah, we had a little chat.

416
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,760
Actually, he didn't believe that you were screwing his wife...

417
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:08,140
Until i showed him some photos,

418
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,820
And then he was just enraged.

419
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:12,880
It was a little scary.

420
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,159
For god sakes, Carlos ,

421
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,520
Am i gonna have to change this number?

422
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:27,080
Victor knows.

423
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,950
Knows what? Everything.

424
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,690
Edie told him we're having an affair.

425
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,810
No, that's impossible. He hasn't said a word.

426
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:37,700
In fact, i've never seen him so sweet and attentive.

427
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,470
It's an act!

428
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,600
Edie said he was enraged.

429
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:43,499
Well, if he's so mad at me,

430
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:48,050
Why would he take me on a boat trip? He took you on a boat?

431
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:52,680
Oh, crap. I think you need to get out of there.

432
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:53,639
Gaby?

435
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,260
I-i was just talking to... Bree.

436
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,040
Oh. Oh, no, no.

437
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,810
We agreed--total privacy.

438
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,190
When we head home, you can have it back.

439
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:13,040
And you can talk to... Bree as much as you like.

440
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,320
Can i get you something?

441
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,830
No, i'm good.

442
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:35,990
You okay?

443
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:39,340
Uh, actually, i'm really cold.

444
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,710
Maybe we should bail and do this another day.

445
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,380
You know, when it's warmer. It'll warm up.

446
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:50,019
Oh, okay, well, just in case, we should run back to shore

447
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,240
So i can grab a jacket.

448
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:52,530
Gaby...

449
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:55,190
You're not going anywhere.

450
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,010
I'm not?

451
00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:00,410
I know about everything--you, Carlos , the affair, everything.

452
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,800
Okay. I am so sorry.

453
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:07,890
But in my defense,

454
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:09,220
You were always gone,

455
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:13,600
And you knew how needy i was when you married me.

456
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:16,960
That's it? That's all you have to say to me?

457
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:20,210
Well, it'd be easier to talk if we were back on shore.

458
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,970
What are you doing?

459
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,740
It's bad enough you've betrayed me.

460
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,280
Now i have to listen to your whining?

461
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:39,730
I brought something for you.

462
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:50,020
Gaby!

463
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:54,450
Gaby!

464
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:56,380
Gaby!

465
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,160
What's that?

466
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,060
Everything i know about your father--

467
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:13,010
Date of birth, his mother's name,

468
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,780
Last known address.

469
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,580
It's everything you need to find him.

471
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:22,820
Thank you.

472
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:27,960
Before you take this...

473
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:31,990
You have to promise me something.

474
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,290
Okay.

475
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,830
You c Ann ot bring him here...

476
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:43,590
Or even tell him where i am.

477
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:45,480
Why?

478
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,610
The last time that i saw your father,

479
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:50,930
It was to tell him that i was leaving him,

480
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:53,560
And i was taking you with me.

481
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:00,010
He, uh, he always liked to slap me around a little bit.

482
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:03,860
But that night was...

483
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,430
Unimaginable.

484
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:11,199
I don't remember everything.

485
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,720
I-i was in pretty bad shape by the end of it.

486
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,619
But once he was done

487
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,490
Slamming my face into the wall,

488
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,130
He started choking me,

489
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:25,470
And he kept screaming

490
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:27,560
That he was gonna kill me.

491
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:30,659
And the last thought

492
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,650
That i had...

493
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,270
Was what would happen to you if i died.

494
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,480
So you can't tell him where i am.

495
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,060
You just can't.

496
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:01,350
Maybe you can talk to my tea Cher Tom orrow...

497
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:04,700
And have her give me another assignment.

498
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,400
Thank you.

499
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:35,239
I told you, if you're gonna have a tree house...

500
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,680
You've gotta keep it clean.

501
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:45,900
Here. Take these and dump them by the front door.

502
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,710
Hey, what the hell are you doing?!

503
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,250
Mom, hurry. Get out of the car.

506
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,950
No, no, no. You are not leaving those here.

507
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,100
Hi, mom.

508
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,229
Take her away. Unh-unh, Lynette .

509
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:06,159
You may have been able to strong-arm the weak one,

510
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,850
But not me. I'm not weak!

511
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,719
Then why did you call me? Get out of our way. Lucy,

512
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,919
Every fight we have ever had

513
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,839
Has ended with my foot on your neck.

514
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,010
I guarantee that this one's gonna end the same way, too.

515
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,080
Maybe we should talk inside.

516
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:45,590
I'm often asked why the torah tells us

517
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:49,480
That a child must be circumcised on the eighth day of his life.

518
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,060
Some say that's how long it takes to get a decent caterer.

519
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,550
What a lovely ceremony.

520
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:05,790
I'm deborah's friend Bree .

521
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,630
I have what may strike you as a very odd request.

522
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,580
Trust me, it won't be one i haven't heard.

524
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,359
Do you think, while you're here,

525
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,290
Do could do a bris for my baby, too?

526
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,740
Okay, new one.

527
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:21,050
Good for you.

528
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:25,049
I know it might seem tacky piggybacking on deborah's bris,

529
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:28,510
But... We could do it in the den very quietly.

530
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:31,209
Uh, well, as we just saw,

531
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,330
There's so such thing as a quiet bris.

532
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,549
You said your name was Bree ?

533
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:37,080
Yes, Bree Hodge ...

534
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:40,210
Born rabinowitz.

535
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:43,340
Huh. I wouldn't have taken you for jewish.

536
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:46,290
I should only have a Nick el for every time i've heard that.

537
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:48,689
Don't you want a proper bris

538
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:51,329
With your friends and family there? I would love that,

539
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:55,200
But my husband Orson -- big, stubborn, goy.

540
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,140
He says we should do nothing

541
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,500
And let the child decide when he's grown.

542
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:03,600
We don't pick our parents-- we should pick our religion?

543
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,679
I wouldn't feel right doing this

544
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,000
Without speaking to your husband.

545
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,400
Well, he's out of town, and...

546
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:13,530
Our Benjamin is 8 days old today.

547
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,580
And if i don't do this,

548
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:17,330
My grandma...

549
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:19,720
Tzeitel...

550
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:23,070
Will never forgive me, may she rest in peace.

551
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,420
You realize that this is a covenant?

552
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,700
That whatever your husband says,

553
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,120
You are promising

554
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,810
To raise your child as a devout jew?

555
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:37,330
I swear to you before god

556
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:41,060
That this child will be as devout a jew as i am.

557
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:52,040
Hey, where have you been? I woke up, and you were gone.

558
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:54,189
Oh, we had a very busy day.

559
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,619
We dropped off the dry cleaning,

560
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:58,269
We deposited money into our christmas account,

561
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,940
And then we got circumcised.

562
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,390
You did what?!

563
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:08,690
It's just a little unsightly foreskin. He'll never miss it.

564
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:11,219
So why stop there? Why--why not cut off his testicles?

565
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:14,309
You obviously have no problem going after mine. Orson.

566
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,760
Well, what do you call it, Bree ?

567
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:19,139
Going behind my back, ignoring my feelings on this?

568
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,019
I gave them very serious consideration.

569
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,159
But it's my blood running in his veins,

570
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,880
Which ultimately makes it my decision.

571
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,870
Your blood?

572
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:31,670
So who am i to Benjamin ?

573
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,120
A friendly uncle? A male n Ann y?

574
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,460
Of course not.

575
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:38,089
Then why do you treat me

576
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:39,940
Like i'm anything less than his father?

577
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:41,979
I mean, haven't i earned that

578
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,780
During the course of our little hoax?

579
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:46,979
I lied for you. I-i risked public humiliation.

580
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,730
I do everything but strap on the pregnancy harness myself.

581
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:51,610
I know that.

582
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:56,220
I see myself as Benjamin 's father.

583
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:59,980
I need to know if you see me that way, too.

584
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,500
I know how much you love Benjamin .

585
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:11,880
I guess...

586
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:14,999
I guess i just have to remember

587
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,740
That it's love that makes us a family and not blood.

588
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:37,700
Your son would like you to hold him.

589
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:50,110
By the way, his hebrew name is Simcha .

590
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,880
I'll explain later.

591
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,590
Oh, Carlos , thank god you're here.

593
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:05,680
Where is he? Where's Victor ?

594
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,430
Well, i-i clubbed him and knocked him overboard.

595
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:11,290
He's in the ocean?!

596
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:13,610
He was going to kill me! He had a gun.

597
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:15,300
Okay, okay, let me think.

598
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,570
You saw him in the water. I mean, he's not dead, right?

599
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:21,660
No, he's mad, but he wasn't dead.

600
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:23,810
So then we'll send someone out there to fish him out.

601
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,310
We'll call the police, show 'em the gun

602
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:27,939
And tell that 'em that it was self-defense.

603
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:28,720
You still have the gun?

604
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:36,870
It's in there.

605
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:45,590
Well, maybe he wanted it to muffle the gun.

606
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:48,750
There is no gun.

607
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:52,280
Ice pick?

608
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:56,199
What are you doing? I'm calling the coast guard.

609
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,449
And tell them what, i knocked my husband overboard

610
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:00,120
Because he was coming after me with a sweater?

611
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,200
No, come on. We gotta go back out there.

612
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,239
Guys, i can't be any clearer on this.

613
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,860
I am not taking her back. It's your turn, simple as that.

614
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:11,939
I've had her for four months.

615
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,899
I also had cancer for four months,

616
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:16,409
And if i could've asked one of them to leave,

617
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:20,399
I'm not sure which i would've picked. Oh, four months, boohoo.

618
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,520
I had her for a year,

619
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:24,140
And that was the year she joined the gin of the month club.

620
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,969
I don't have any room for her.

621
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:28,429
I already have seven people in four bedrooms.

622
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:31,559
There it is-- the "i have a family" card. Congratulations.

623
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,449
You can reproduce.

624
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:33,720
We're all thrilled for you.

625
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,469
Why can't you take her?

626
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:39,199
You are in that huge house all by yourself

627
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,810
That you got from the divorce. Dave and i are just separated.

628
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,860
There's a good chance that he's moving back in,

629
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:46,429
But not if mom is living there. Well,

630
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:48,460
We can't just throw her out on the street.

631
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,460
I can.

632
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,039
My therapist said

633
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,830
It's time for me to be a little more "lydia-centric."

634
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:59,170
I really w Ann a meet this jackass.

635
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:02,570
Okay, we all have our excuses,

636
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:05,009
But we gotta figure something out.

637
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,640
Come on. She is our mother.

638
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:08,150
Is she?

639
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:12,130
She never acted like one, not that i can remember.

640
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:14,339
I remember she showed up drunk to my graduation,

641
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,660
Wearing a housecoat.

642
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,840
Okay, but the point is, she went.

643
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:19,490
Remember that one christmas?

644
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:23,580
And we came down, and there was mom under the tree,

645
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:26,219
Passed out drunk in the middle of all of our unwrapped toys.

646
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:28,579
My raggedy Ann smelled like peppermint schnapps.

647
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:31,669
Okay, she wasn't perfect, clearly.

648
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,509
But she gave birth to us.

649
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:36,819
We owe her our lives, and now that she needs us,

650
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,710
We can't just turn our back on her.

651
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,750
I know i'm supposed to feel guilty, but i don't.

652
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:43,020
I don't either.

653
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:48,750
It's like you're saying you don't care about her.

654
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:52,950
At all?

655
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,460
And i don't under Stan d that.

656
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,509
Well... If you care so much,

657
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:05,450
Then the answer to the problem is sorta obvious, isn't it?

658
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:09,790
We can help with money.

659
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:12,870
I can send you $100 a month.

661
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:20,679
I don't need your money.

662
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,840
I can take care of my mother all by myself.

663
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,350
Lynette...

664
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,610
Here's how you can help--

665
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:30,160
Don'tvisit for the next few years,

666
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:32,539
Cause it seems fairly likely

667
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,820
I won't have stopped hating you by then.

668
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:40,850
I guess that's her way of asking us to leave.

669
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,120
Mom, where's grandma going?

670
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:45,500
Going?

671
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,050
Wait.

672
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,110
What's that?

673
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:06,710
Gaby!

674
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,320
Here. Sit him here.

676
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,140
You tried to kill me.

677
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,810
Well, i came back for you, didn't i?

678
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:26,639
What were you thinking?! Well, i thought you were trying to kill me.

679
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,350
I was just trying to talk to you,

680
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,900
See if we still had a chance.

681
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:34,070
I see that you're still screwing this guy.

682
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:36,829
And what the hell is he doing on my boat?!

683
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:38,720
You mean, besides saving your life?

684
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,770
That was a big mistake, buddy.

685
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,500
Oh, right.

686
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,599
Yeah, you're the guy that said

687
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,040
If anyone messed with your woman,

688
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:49,810
That you'd use your money to make 'em disappear.

689
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:52,300
But right now it's just you and me.

690
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,570
So how tough are you without your a.t.m. Card?

691
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:01,480
That's what i figured.

692
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:04,960
Aah! Victor!

693
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:06,680
Oh, my god!

694
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,110
Victor! Oh! Oh, my god!

695
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,659
Come on. Get up! Hey. Hey.

696
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,039
Get up. I w Ann a see the look on your face

697
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:14,960
When the knife goes in.

699
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,670
Oh, i'm getting pretty good at that.

700
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,280
Okay, let's pull him back in again.

701
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,589
What, are you crazy?! Oh,

702
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:31,629
We'll just tie him up so he doesn't cause any trouble.

703
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:32,250
Victor!

704
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,260
Where'd he go? Victor!

705
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:40,760
Victor! Victor!

706
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:58,509
Maybe we should go back out and look some more.

707
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:00,520
We looked for six hours. He's gone.

708
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,720
Oh, my god. We killed him.

709
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:07,640
It was self-defense, right?

710
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:10,270
I mean, he was trying to kill us. We can't prove that.

711
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,660
This is bad, Gaby .

712
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:18,310
Oh, when people find out we were on that boat with him, it...

713
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:22,650
Maybe they won't.

714
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:24,530
What do you mean?

715
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:27,160
No one but you knows i was with Victor .

716
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:29,850
I'll say he went out alone.

717
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,789
I told him i was leaving him,

718
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:34,940
And he was depressed, suic Ida l even.

719
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,100
Only one problem--

720
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:38,460
The boat's right here.

721
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,220
Then maybe the boat needs to go back out...

722
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:44,450
Alone.

723
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:07,930
Whatever you're thinking, i can explain.

724
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,610
I'm thinking that you're a drug addict and a liar,

725
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,819
So say something that's not that. Susan, listen--

726
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,959
Is it so horrible living with me?

727
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,959
I mean, do i make you so miserable

728
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,880
That you can't even face me without numbing the pain?

729
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,660
Of course not.

730
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:24,880
I love you.

731
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,380
Well, if you did, you wouldn't be doing this!

732
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:30,600
I mean, my god, Mike , we have a baby on the way!

733
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,569
Can i say something now?

734
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:37,940
Sure, go ahead. Oh, should i look you in the eyes?

735
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:40,310
Does it make it easier for you to lie?

736
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,740
I didn't tell you...

737
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,940
About the pills 'cause i didn't want you to feel guilty.

738
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:48,260
Me feel guilty?

739
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,010
Yeah.

740
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:51,960
When i put in that water heater for McCluskey ,

741
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:53,469
I really wrenched my shoulder,

742
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:56,100
And the doctor told me i should take a break, but i didn't

743
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:59,230
Because that was the day we found out you were pregnant.

744
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,269
And from then on, all i have heard about

745
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:05,130
Are car seats and strollers and $10,000 preschools.

746
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:06,869
You know, it didn't seem like

747
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:08,460
A really good time for me to quit working.

748
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:12,740
Mike, we don't need any of that stuff.

749
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,100
Yeah.

750
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,850
You say that now.

751
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:20,980
But when Benjamin Hodge is in harvard,

752
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:23,570
And our kid's just a plumber like his dad...

753
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,010
I just want to be able to give him

754
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:32,830
The advantages i never got.

755
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,289
God, the only advantage he needs

756
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:40,040
Is to have a healthy dad who's not doing this.

757
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,430
You're right.

758
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:49,950
I get it. Okay?

759
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:52,630
I'm done.

760
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,760
I w Ann a believe you. It's just...

761
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:01,030
That addicts are good at lying.

762
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:03,630
Yeah.

763
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:06,480
All right...

764
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,180
How about this?

765
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,610
You believe me now?

766
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:28,230
Thank you.

767
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,310
Deception--

768
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:36,400
You find it in all the best homes.

769
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:42,980
Parents rely on it when dealing with inquisitive children...

770
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:51,770
Women use it to help keep secrets--big and small.

771
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:56,790
Lovers need it

772
00:41:57,530 --> 00:42:00,720
To cover up inconvenient accidents.

773
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:06,280
Why do people resort to deception?

774
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:12,340
Because it's a handy tool

775
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:15,130
That helps get us

776
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:20,020
Exactly what we'relooking for.
