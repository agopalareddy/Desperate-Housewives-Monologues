1
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:09,176
<i>It had been 14 years since Katherine
Mayfair had been in a police station,</i></i>

2
00:00:09,218 --> 00:00:13,514
<i>but she remembered the
conversation like it was yesterday.</i></i>

3
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:16,600
Would you like some water, honey?

4
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:18,435
Thanks.

5
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:19,937
So...

6
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:23,106
I take it this isn't the first
time your husband's hit you?

7
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:27,819
He keeps promising to stop,
but it just gets worse.

8
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:31,406
And I'm afraid he's gonna do
something to my daughter.

9
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,868
Please, you have to help me.

10
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:36,954
Have you reported him before?

11
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:40,541
Once, but when I called, they said
they couldn't find the paperwork.

12
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:47,047
Your husband's Wayne
Davis, one of our patrolmen.

13
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:52,845
Want some advice?

14
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:56,640
Wayne's got a lot of
friends around here.

15
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,934
Of course you can press charges, but...

16
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:03,272
I can't guarantee that one of his
friends won't lose the paperwork again.

17
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,941
Then what should I do?

18
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:10,612
Get as much money as you can lay
your hands on, grab your daughter...

19
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:12,865
and run.

20
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:19,246
<i>And so she did...</i></i>

21
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:23,292
<i>to a place she thought would be safe.</i></i>

22
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,506
Mrs Mayfair?

23
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:32,426
I'm detective Romslo. Can I help you?

24
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:36,263
Why exactly would you think
that Dr Mayfair was kidnapped?

25
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:40,517
No one in the school parking lot
heard or saw anything suspicious.

26
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:44,897
That's because the man
responsible for this--my ex--

27
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,858
knows a little something
about how to commit a crime.

28
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,818
He's a cop.

29
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,820
What's his name?

30
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:53,989
Wayne Davis.

31
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,243
What?

32
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,208
Well, it's just, uh...

33
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:05,459
I know Wayne.

34
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:06,752
We've hung out together.

35
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:07,794
He's a hell of a golfer.

36
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:11,423
Well, believe me when I tell you
he wasn't a hell of a husband.

37
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:12,758
Is that what this is about?

38
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:16,053
Some payback for an
ancient domestic dispute?

39
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:20,641
Please. You have to do something.

40
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:26,396
Because once Wayne is done with
Adam, he's going to come after me.

41
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,775
And this time, he's
gonna kill me. I know it.

42
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,570
I'll look into it.

43
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,157
If you would just, uh,
fill out this paperwork...

44
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:43,872
<i>in that moment, Katherine knew
exactly what she had to do...</i></i>

45
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:45,624
<i>again.</i></i>

46
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,584
Mom, stop. You're not making any sense.

47
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:50,921
There's no time. Wayne is coming. 
He took Adam. We're next.

48
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:52,840
But why? Why would he do that?

49
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,050
And if we're in so much danger, 
then why aren't we calling the police?

50
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:57,886
The police will not help. 
Dylan, please! Go pack your things.

51
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,763
We need to be gone before he gets here.

52
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:01,181
Stop!

53
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:04,810
I'm not going anywhere until
you tell me what's going on.

54
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:09,439
Why do I have to be afraid of my father?

55
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:14,653
<i>Katherine Mayfair had been running
from the truth for a long time...</i></i>

56
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:19,283
Okay. I'll tell you.

57
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:20,367
No!

58
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:21,910
Dylan. Dylan, I'm sorry.

59
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,496
- I had no choice!
- No!

60
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,041
Dylan!

61
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:31,253
<i>and it had finally caught up with her.</i></i>

62
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:40,179
<i>There's a ritual my friends
have observed for years.</i></i>

63
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:45,225
<i>Once a week, they meet to play a 
game of cards and talk about their lives.</i></i>

64
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,353
<i>There's always laughter and wine...</i></i>

65
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,397
<i>and talk about the neighbors.</i></i>

66
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:53,233
No way, Bree. I don't want Katherine
in our games. She bums me out.

67
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:54,943
Oh, I'm with Gaby. 
I mean, you know me.

68
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:57,237
I always like to give people
the benefit of the doubt...

69
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:58,614
no, you don't.

70
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:00,324
No, I don't, but let's say I did.

71
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:01,950
Katherine has this aloof quality.

72
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:03,994
It's like she's always trying
to keep us at arm's length.

73
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:07,247
Well, I have to agree. She's changed. 
She's not that fun anymore.

74
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:08,999
Ladies, I don't know
what you're talking about.

75
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,460
Katherine has all sorts
of wonderful qualities.

76
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:15,589
Name one, and keep in mind that "aloof"
and "unfun" have already been taken.

77
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:18,175
Well, I admit she plays
her cards close to the vest,

78
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:21,553
but some of you could benefit
from that kind of quiet dignity,

79
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:24,515
Miss I-chew-gum-like-a-1930s-gun-moll.

80
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:30,103
Bree, you can talk Katherine up all you want,
but she is just never gonna be one of us.

81
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,898
Anybody home?

82
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:37,819
We were just talking about you.

83
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,655
Random chitchat, nothing specific.

84
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,407
That's nice. 
Could I talk to you for a minute?

85
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:44,660
What's going on?

86
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,578
Okay, I know it's last minute,
but I have to leave town,

87
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:49,957
so I'm not gonna be able to help
you cater the commitment ceremony.

88
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:51,667
It's tomorrow!

89
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:55,462
A hundred gay men are descending on this
street, and they're expecting a fabulous party.

90
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:59,842
I feel awful, but I wouldn't bail
on you if it weren't important.

91
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,510
Okay. Well, what's going on?

92
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:04,638
I can't tell you. Again, I'm so sorry.

93
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,807
Good luck.

94
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:17,067
All right, you can all wipe
those smug looks off your faces,

95
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:20,654
because every one of you
has just become my employee.

96
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:26,910
Hey, got any plans tomorrow at 5:00 am?
'Cause now you do.

97
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:31,081
Bree needs about two truckloads
of flowers picked up from...

98
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:32,791
What?

99
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,085
Guess who got off the
wait list at Princeton!

100
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:37,546
Oh my God. Oh my God!

101
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:40,716
I'm so proud of you!

102
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:43,010
Okay, I am going to need
a bumper sticker right away

103
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,220
so I can start annoying
all the other parents!

104
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:47,472
Sure. I'll snag you one
when I get there on tuesday.

105
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,433
Tuesday? What are you talking about?

106
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:52,060
Okay, you know that professor
who read my senior thesis?

107
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:55,105
Well, he was so impressed that he asked
me to come out and do a summer internship.

108
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:56,273
I'm leaving next week.

109
00:05:56,315 --> 00:05:58,025
Next week?

110
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:01,403
W-well, that is a big... no.

111
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:04,198
No? Mom, I have to. It's a huge honor.

112
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:08,285
Yes... to be chosen,
and you have been chosen.

113
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,580
So congratulations,
and you're staying home.

114
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:13,457
Oh, you're not letting her go?

115
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:15,375
But it's a huge honor.

116
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:18,587
Yes, we've established that.
It's huge. It's an honor.

117
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:20,547
We get it.

118
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,425
Give me one good reason why I can't go.

119
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:27,012
Well, the first thing
off the top of my head...

120
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,474
we can't afford it.

121
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,686
Susan, can I talk to you for a sec?

122
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:39,441
You know, I just inherited 5 grand
from grandpa Maynard, and I...

123
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,736
I'd really like to help Julie do this.

124
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,323
Mike, that is so sweet.

125
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,408
Mike makes another good point.

126
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:50,911
Who is this professor? I don't know him.

127
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:54,665
I am certainly not going to give
my daughter to him for a summer.

128
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:57,334
I'm sorry, Julie. This is not happening.

129
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:58,377
This totally sucks.

130
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:02,214
Well, yes, but don't forget-- 
it is a huge honor.

131
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:15,352
You know what we haven't
done in a really long time?

132
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,647
Made 250 mini pizzas in one afternoon.

133
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,649
What are you talking about?

134
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:25,362
Bree's in a horrible jam, and I told her we'd
help cater the commitment ceremony tomorrow.

135
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:26,989
I can't. I'm busy, remember?

136
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:31,618
I'm taking this stuff to Kayla, my daughter
who lives four and a half hours away now.

137
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:36,582
Okay, so at the risk of cracking these
eggshells I've been walking on all week,

138
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:40,335
any idea when you're
gonna stop being so angry?

139
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:42,045
I'm not angry at you.

140
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,339
'Cause you know we
didn't have a choice, Tom.

141
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:45,924
We had to get her out of the house.

142
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:47,801
I know. I am angry at the situation.

143
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,429
- Can you please just let me be angry?
- Fine.

144
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:53,515
You can be as angry and
sulky and pissy as you want,

145
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,687
just so long as you're here tomorrow,
helping me crank out 250 mini pizzas.

146
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:05,611
You know, I've been told that some wives ask their
husbands for favors and actually say, "please."

147
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:10,449
Oh, Tom. don't you know an
urban myth when you hear one?

148
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:17,414
Okay, so here's the deal.

149
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:19,875
Bree needs all of these wedding
favors wrapped by tomorrow,

150
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:23,420
and she's really counting on me, so...

151
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:25,005
I'm gonna need you to hurry.

152
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:27,966
I just got off the phone
with the credit card company.

153
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:30,177
Do you have something
that you wanna tell me?

154
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,472
Well, it would be easier
if I knew what you knew.

155
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:35,098
Damn it, Gaby, enough shopping!

156
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,476
You've maxed out every
credit card we own.

157
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:40,812
I mean, we are so broke right now, it's gonna
be a miracle if we don't end up on the street.

158
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,648
Okay, when you yell at me, I get upset.

159
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:44,942
And you know what I do
when I get upset? I shop.

160
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:48,028
So if we do end up homeless,
guess whose fat it'll be.

161
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,616
Whatever. I'm gonna go read porn...

162
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,202
In braille.

163
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,042
Hello?

164
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,836
Gaby, it's Ellie.

165
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:05,963
Ellie, you can't call me!

166
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,715
The cops are all over my ass because
they think I helped you escape.

167
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:12,219
I'm sorry. I just need one more favor,
and then I'll never bother you again.

168
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:14,596
Ellie, I don't know. What is it?

169
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,807
I left my teddy bear in the coat closet.

170
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:18,684
I need you to bring it to me.

171
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:21,270
Teddy bear? What is that,
code for "a pound of blow"?

172
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:24,106
No, it's an actual teddy bear.

173
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:29,778
My dad gave it to me when I was 5, and it's
the only thing I have left to remember him by.

174
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:31,738
Crap.

175
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,616
Ya had to play the daddy card.

176
00:09:56,889 --> 00:09:59,558
So after the ceremony,
we'll open up the buffet...

177
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,894
Uh, chicken masala, 
and pasta for the vegetarians.

178
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,938
And dancing, roll out the cake,
you leave for your honeymoon,

179
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:07,524
and I will collapse in a tasteful heap.

180
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:10,110
Hold it. You dn't say anything
about the ice sculpture.

181
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:13,238
Yes, I'm sorry. 
One cherub, delivered at 1:30.

182
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:14,114
Cherub?

183
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:17,826
No, I specifically told Katherine we
were gonna go with the enchanted castle.

184
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:21,580
And I told her we'd go with the cherub
because we are not 8-year-old girls.

185
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:24,875
Bob, all my life I have dreamt
of having a wedding reception

186
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:29,838
in which I would serve drinks from a vodka moat
surrounding an enchanted castle rendered in ice,

187
00:10:29,922 --> 00:10:32,132
and I don't think
that's too much to ask.

188
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:34,927
Remember when you asked me to tell you
when you start acting like Faye Dunaway

189
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:38,347
from the boardroom scene
in "Mommie Dearest"?

190
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:41,850
Uh, why don't I let
you two work this out?

191
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:45,938
Fine, we'll go with
the stupid baby angel.

192
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:50,067
I need some coffee.

193
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:51,610
Why are you here?

194
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:54,446
And don't say for the pizza, because
I know you're lactose-intolerant.

195
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:56,365
I heard Katherine left you in the lurch.

196
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:58,116
I'm here to offer my assistance.

197
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:01,745
Oh, I get it. So I'm desperate and vulnerable,
and you're gonna swoop in and save the day.

198
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:03,330
Well, thank you very much. I'm fine.

199
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,456
Darling, don't be stubborn.

200
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:08,001
You're gonna need place cards, and
you know I have excellent penmanship.

201
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:11,755
Don't you dare throw your calligraphy skills
in my face when you know I'm at a low point.

202
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,675
Now go! And stop following me.

203
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,598
You're doomed.

204
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:23,267
Excuse me?

205
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:25,769
The way you just caved
on that sculpture thing?

206
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:27,938
You're setting the tone
for your entire marriage.

207
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,689
I am?

208
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,524
Yeah. You gotta dig in your heels.

209
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:33,652
Otherwise, you're gonna be
pushed around for the next...

210
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:36,321
Let's see. How long have I been married?

211
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:39,491
Ten and a half years.

212
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:44,997
- I want my castle.
- Lee...

213
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,959
it is the only thing I've asked
for, and damn it, I'm entitled to it.

214
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:53,046
Fine.

215
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:56,925
Thank you.

216
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:03,682
All right, so I will call the
ice sculptor and see if we can--

217
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:06,226
Forget it. 
We're sticking with the cherub.

218
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:10,480
And later, when he bitches about
it, I'll just buy him some jewelry.

219
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:13,609
You sure you haven't been married before?

220
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:14,651
Hey, Gaby?

221
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:16,737
Over here, Carlos.

222
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:21,116
You know, I got a theory as to why
all this bad stuff has happened to us--

223
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,328
my blindness and losing all our money...

224
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:25,454
it's karma.

225
00:12:25,621 --> 00:12:26,788
You know, we've been selfish and greedy,

226
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,833
and the universe is telling us
to start being better people.

227
00:12:31,043 --> 00:12:34,713
I just found $118,000
in Ellie's teddy bear.

228
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:38,800
Hey, universe? Bite me!

229
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:40,802
- Hello?
- Hey, Wayne?

230
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:42,304
It's Pete Romslo.

231
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:45,057
Pete! How's tricks?

232
00:12:45,057 --> 00:12:46,892
Listen, uh, I'm just calling
to give you a heads-up.

233
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:49,353
Um, I finally met your ex.

234
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,688
She came in to file a report.

235
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,024
Apparently, you, uh,
kidnapped her husband.

236
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,818
No kidding? Am I asking for ransom?

237
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:58,820
Well, you always said she was crazy.

238
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:00,822
Now I feel your pain.

239
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:02,991
Anyway, I-I just thought
you should know, huh?

240
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:04,910
- Take care.
- Thanks.

241
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:12,376
Okay, enough kiddin' around.

242
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:14,753
Tell me where my daughter is.

243
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:23,846
Oh, for-- 
did you die on me?

244
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:31,478
Damn it!

245
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:49,079
Okay, so you have another one
of those in the truck? Thank you.

246
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:51,748
I'll be back in ten minutes!

247
00:13:51,707 --> 00:13:54,001
We need more settings on five, please.

248
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:56,336
Lynette, I wish I had time to
be more tactful, but I don't.

249
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:59,214
Your swan is pathetic, and I'm
firing you from napkin duty.

250
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:01,967
No, no, give me another chance. 
I will get it.

251
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:05,888
yes? Oh, there you are!
Where is my ice sculpture?

252
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:09,474
No! No, 6:00 is too late. 
I need it now.

253
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:13,061
Oh, forget it. 
I'll pick it up myself.

254
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:18,650
Why don't you fill water glasses?
That's an important job, too.

255
00:14:24,156 --> 00:14:28,118
Andrew... look, I'm on my way back,
but it's imperative that you...

256
00:14:28,619 --> 00:14:31,121
Andrew? Oh, dear God.

257
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:34,124
Oh, no. Don't die on me now!

258
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:41,840
oh, dear God.

259
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:18,752
Help me! Help!

260
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:28,262
I'm just saying we should pay off all
of our bills and put the rest in savings.

261
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:30,472
Savings? Nobody does that anymore.

262
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:32,599
Well, I mean, you never know. 
We might have kids.

263
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,893
Oh, Carlos, we're never gonna have kids.

264
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:36,562
Shoes are my kids.

265
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:39,106
Let me be the mother I was meant to be.

266
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:42,526
Hello?

267
00:15:42,526 --> 00:15:44,945
Where's my bear?

268
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:48,365
Right. The bear.

269
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:53,036
Well... I looked all over
and just couldn't find it.

270
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:54,746
I guess the cops took it.

271
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:56,957
I'm really sorry, Ellie.

272
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:58,292
I know it was a gift from your dad.

273
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:00,419
It just breaks my heart.

274
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,046
You found the money, didn't you?

275
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,256
Money? What money?

276
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:06,466
You're lying. 
I can hear it in your voice.

277
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:07,801
What's wrong with my voice?

278
00:16:07,843 --> 00:16:09,344
Okay, listen, bitch.

279
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:11,805
You do not wanna screw with me.

280
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:15,684
How about we split it 50-50?

281
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:19,563
I'm coming to get my money,
and if one dime is missing,

282
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:22,691
I will throw acid in your face.

283
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:29,781
Okay, we really need to get caller ID.

284
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:53,055
What more can you do to me?

285
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:01,522
Need a lift?

286
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:09,571
Is, uh, Dylan here by any chance?

287
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:11,615
Uh, um, no, I-I haven't seen her.

288
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:12,824
Okay. Thanks.

289
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:14,952
Hey, Katherine, are you all right?

290
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:19,373
Dylan and I, we... had a big fight.

291
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:24,294
Well, I'm sure she's just upset, and
she'll come home after she cools off.

292
00:17:24,378 --> 00:17:27,965
Not this time. I lied to her.

293
00:17:29,508 --> 00:17:33,512
Well... we all lie to
our kids sometimes, right?

294
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:38,267
I've been doing it her whole life-- one
lie on top of another-- and the thing...

295
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:43,105
I learned too late is that eventually
they all come crashing down on you.

296
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:47,484
Anyway, if you see her, let me know? 
Thanks.

297
00:17:54,867 --> 00:17:57,452
What's your hurry, Kathy?

298
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:21,602
What happened to my daughter?

299
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:26,273
I'm not telling you anything,
so you might as well kill me.

300
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:29,318
I don't care.

301
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:32,654
I believe you. I do.

302
00:18:33,572 --> 00:18:36,283
But what about Dylan?

303
00:18:36,325 --> 00:18:40,913
Or should I say, that girl
that lives here with you?

304
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:44,750
I bet you'd care if I killed her.

305
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,968
There are no wings.

306
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:58,764
Yes, and the Venus de Milo is
missing two arms. What's your point?

307
00:18:58,764 --> 00:19:01,475
It's... stunning.

308
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:14,655
well, I suppose I should say thank you.

309
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:16,365
Oh, it's no big deal.

310
00:19:16,365 --> 00:19:19,076
You're just lucky I was there.

311
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:22,162
Was I lucky, or were you following me?

312
00:19:24,498 --> 00:19:27,084
I thought you might need my help.

313
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,796
And you were right. I did.

314
00:19:30,796 --> 00:19:32,881
You just think I'm being
stubborn, don't you?

315
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:37,177
Making you jump through hoops when
it's so clear we belong together.

316
00:19:37,678 --> 00:19:39,471
I don't think anything, Bree.

317
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:43,892
I'm just trying to be there for you
and hoping eventually you'll forgive me.

318
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,186
But that's just it, Orson.

319
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:49,565
If I forgive you, then I
forgiving what you did to Mike.

320
00:19:49,565 --> 00:19:52,484
I can't do that.

321
00:19:52,484 --> 00:19:53,777
And-- and you
wouldn't want me to.

322
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:55,279
I mean, be honest with yourself.

323
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:59,366
If I took you back now, I
wouldn't be the woman you love.

324
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,578
Then what can I do?

325
00:20:02,995 --> 00:20:06,999
I've already told you. Turn yourself in to
the police and let justice run its course.

326
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:09,668
I can't do that, Bree.

327
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:15,465
I want to, for you, more than anything.

328
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:19,469
But I don't think I could survive it.

329
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:24,391
Well... so here we are.

330
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:35,194
what is this?

331
00:20:35,194 --> 00:20:37,070
- It's your ice sculpture.
- No, it's not.

332
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:40,365
I see no turrets. I see no flags.
I see no moat full of vodka.

333
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:44,995
What I see is a giant,
icy slap in the face.

334
00:20:45,871 --> 00:20:47,664
Bob!

335
00:20:51,293 --> 00:20:53,670
What's that?

336
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:58,175
I want to be able to reach you this
summer when you're doing that internship.

337
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:02,179
You changed your mind?

338
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:05,098
Here's the thing.

339
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:08,894
You and I have always had kind
of an unconventional relationship,

340
00:21:08,894 --> 00:21:13,774
and the reason that worked was because
we always tell each other the truth...

341
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:15,984
until yesterday.

342
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:20,572
Julie, I lied about not having
enough money to send you.

343
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:23,075
Why?

344
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:27,371
Because I just freaked
out about you leaving.

345
00:21:27,371 --> 00:21:29,289
But you knew I was
going away to college.

346
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:30,666
Yes, in the fall.

347
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:34,461
And I needed those extra
three months to get ready. I...

348
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:40,217
I still have not figured out

349
00:21:40,217 --> 00:21:43,220
how I'm gonna get by without you.

350
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:46,098
Mom...

351
00:21:46,098 --> 00:21:48,183
seriously...

352
00:21:49,977 --> 00:21:53,772
I just lean on you in
ways you don't even know.

353
00:21:54,773 --> 00:21:58,485
I think you are stronger than
you give yourself credit for.

354
00:21:58,485 --> 00:22:02,865
Well... I spend more time with
me than you do, and I'm a mess.

355
00:22:02,906 --> 00:22:05,534
Well, you were when dad left.

356
00:22:05,576 --> 00:22:06,785
I had my hands full then.

357
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:11,039
But you've grown so much
these last five years.

358
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,833
Really?

359
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:16,670
You are a secure, confident woman now.

360
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,881
You're ready to spread
your wings and fly.

361
00:22:18,881 --> 00:22:21,300
Frankly, my work here is done.

362
00:22:22,217 --> 00:22:24,303
Thanks.

363
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:28,098
Now I want you to have that
phone on you at all times...

364
00:22:28,098 --> 00:22:31,685
because I'm still not sure
how to work the dishwasher.

365
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,192
Can you help me?

366
00:22:38,692 --> 00:22:40,694
For God sake, Lee! 
It's just an ice sculpture!

367
00:22:40,736 --> 00:22:43,405
It is not "just an ice sculpture"!

368
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:45,991
It's the sculpture and
making me move to the suburbs

369
00:22:45,991 --> 00:22:49,369
and forcing me to be nice to your homophobic boss. 
You know what? Tom's right.

370
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:52,873
If I don't start standing
up for myself, I'm doomed.

371
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:57,085
I don't believe 
I used the word "doomed."

372
00:22:57,169 --> 00:22:58,795
You're always overruling me.

373
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:01,465
You treat me like a child. 
Well, I've had it!

374
00:23:01,465 --> 00:23:04,092
Ceremony's off, mein Führer!

375
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:07,221
It's a chunk of ice, you drama queen!

376
00:23:09,598 --> 00:23:10,974
Okay...all I said was--

377
00:23:11,016 --> 00:23:14,019
I don't care what you
said. We have to fix this!

378
00:23:14,603 --> 00:23:17,189
Or do you want to tell Bree
that you torpedoed her ceremony?

379
00:23:17,189 --> 00:23:19,274
I did not tell you to put
mums in that arrangement!

380
00:23:19,316 --> 00:23:22,444
And don't point your finger at
me or I'll snap it right off.

381
00:23:22,736 --> 00:23:25,030
- I'll find Bob.
- I'll get Lee.

382
00:23:26,824 --> 00:23:29,409
- You can't make me talk to him.
- Yeah, I can. Sit down.

383
00:23:30,035 --> 00:23:33,413
Earlier, my husband, in an attempt
to help you with your relationship,

384
00:23:33,372 --> 00:23:38,168
mistakenly gave you some advice, which
he would now like to take back. Tom?

385
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:41,088
Actually, I stand by everything I said.

386
00:23:41,088 --> 00:23:43,173
- My mistake was in not going far enough.
- What?

387
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:45,968
If you're willing to break
up over an ice sculpture,

388
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:48,929
you guys should
absolutely not get married.

389
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:50,639
Where the hell are you going with this?

390
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:54,476
Because who gets to choose the ice
sculpture, who should take out the trash,

391
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:57,563
who has to stay home and
make the mini pizzas--

392
00:23:57,604 --> 00:23:59,314
that's the little stuff.

393
00:23:59,273 --> 00:24:01,900
What are you gonna do when
the big stuff comes along?

394
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,068
- Could you give us a second?
- No.

395
00:24:03,068 --> 00:24:06,363
What are you gonna do when
a tornado hits your house,

396
00:24:06,363 --> 00:24:07,781
or you have problems with your kids,

397
00:24:07,823 --> 00:24:10,409
or one of you gets cancer?

398
00:24:11,743 --> 00:24:16,123
At some point, the crap is going
to hit the fan, and that is why now,

399
00:24:16,123 --> 00:24:19,710
before you make the commitment,
you have to ask yourself,

400
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:25,007
is that person in bed next
to you worth the trble?

401
00:24:27,426 --> 00:24:31,138
Do you love him... or her so much that

402
00:24:31,138 --> 00:24:34,725
no disease, no disaster

403
00:24:34,725 --> 00:24:37,644
could possibly pull you apart?

404
00:24:42,316 --> 00:24:44,526
Answer him.

405
00:24:44,902 --> 00:24:46,403
- Sure.
- Of course I do.

406
00:24:46,445 --> 00:24:49,406
Good. Good, then...

407
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,327
get out there and get
committed, you crazy kids.

408
00:25:13,639 --> 00:25:16,225
Oh my God. Are you okay?

409
00:25:16,225 --> 00:25:18,810
- You need some help?
- Yes.

410
00:25:21,939 --> 00:25:23,941
Thanks for stopping.

411
00:25:27,361 --> 00:25:30,072
Yes, officer. I see you.
Thank you for coming.

412
00:25:30,364 --> 00:25:31,865
Now remember, Ellie's dangerous.

413
00:25:31,824 --> 00:25:35,327
So if she shows up, feel
free to use excessive force.

414
00:25:37,371 --> 00:25:40,165
Carlos, are you almost ready?

415
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:45,671
Carlos? Did you hear me?

416
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:50,717
I'm just getting my jacket.

417
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:03,522
Oh, honey, can you carry the house
keys? They don't fit in my purse.

418
00:26:03,522 --> 00:26:05,816
Ellie's upstairs.

419
00:26:06,024 --> 00:26:07,025
What?

420
00:26:07,025 --> 00:26:10,112
She's in our bedroom. I heard
her breathing. Call the cops.

421
00:26:10,195 --> 00:26:12,030
Wait! She's gonna steal our money!

422
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,699
You can't go up there.
It's too dangerous.

423
00:26:13,699 --> 00:26:16,326
Well, not as dangerous as poverty!

424
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:18,996
Gaby.

425
00:26:49,693 --> 00:26:52,112
Gaby? What's going on?

426
00:26:58,494 --> 00:27:02,289
Carlos! Carlos, don't just stand there! 
Go get help!

427
00:27:02,498 --> 00:27:03,999
Help! Police!

428
00:27:03,999 --> 00:27:06,084
That's the closet!

429
00:27:11,256 --> 00:27:16,553
Police! Police! Get in here now!

430
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:40,077
Wayne.

431
00:27:40,744 --> 00:27:42,746
I don't think you've
thought this through.

432
00:27:42,788 --> 00:27:44,373
Shut up.

433
00:27:44,456 --> 00:27:48,752
If I tell you what happened,
if I don't tell you...

434
00:27:49,378 --> 00:27:51,964
you're gonna kill me anyway.

435
00:27:52,089 --> 00:27:54,758
Who you gonna pin it on?

436
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:00,472
We have history.

437
00:28:00,514 --> 00:28:03,433
Right now I'm just
your bitter, crazy ex.

438
00:28:03,392 --> 00:28:06,895
But if I turn up dead,
and you have no alibi--

439
00:28:06,895 --> 00:28:09,481
you let me worry about that.

440
00:28:19,408 --> 00:28:21,034
Look, I'm having a
little problem right now.

441
00:28:21,034 --> 00:28:23,537
I just need to hide here for a sec.

442
00:28:23,537 --> 00:28:27,124
And I don't wanna hurt
you, so don't make me.

443
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:29,126
All right?

444
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:34,673
Good. I'm glad we understand each other.

445
00:28:48,562 --> 00:28:51,064
And with your gun, too.

446
00:28:51,857 --> 00:28:54,651
I guess I just found my alibi.

447
00:28:59,448 --> 00:29:02,075
And now we will do the
exchanging of the rings...

448
00:29:02,117 --> 00:29:03,494
Snappy ceremony, Bree.

449
00:29:03,452 --> 00:29:05,579
You and Katherine
really did a bang-up job.

450
00:29:05,621 --> 00:29:07,122
No, I did a bang-up job.

451
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,583
Katherine bailed on me
and left town last night.

452
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:11,710
I think you got hosed. 
I just saw her an hour ago.

453
00:29:11,668 --> 00:29:15,255
... at this joyous and festive occasion.

454
00:29:15,297 --> 00:29:18,008
Please join hands.

455
00:29:19,092 --> 00:29:22,888
She was on the run, she broke in, 
she stabbed you, you shot her.

456
00:29:22,888 --> 00:29:25,098
Case closed.

457
00:29:25,098 --> 00:29:28,393
It's like the alibi fairy 
left me a present.

458
00:29:29,186 --> 00:29:32,523
But I do wonder...

459
00:29:32,564 --> 00:29:35,442
what if Dylan doesn't come back?

460
00:29:37,486 --> 00:29:39,905
We had a fight.

461
00:29:40,864 --> 00:29:44,243
She said she hated me,
said she was leaving...

462
00:29:44,243 --> 00:29:46,161
for good.

463
00:29:46,161 --> 00:29:48,038
Is that the best you can do, Kathy?

464
00:29:48,038 --> 00:29:50,040
I know it sounds convenient.

465
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,751
But what happens if it's true?

466
00:29:52,835 --> 00:29:55,963
Because you don't have another plan.

467
00:29:56,046 --> 00:30:00,050
Was the only way you couldmake
me tell you the truth.

468
00:30:07,099 --> 00:30:10,978
Katherine? It's Bree.
We need to talk now!

469
00:30:16,275 --> 00:30:18,277
That girl that was
living with the Solises?

470
00:30:18,277 --> 00:30:22,072
Actually, I thought I saw
her heading down that way.

471
00:30:22,072 --> 00:30:24,074
Hope you find her.

472
00:30:24,074 --> 00:30:28,078
I'd hate to think there was some maniac 
running around our neighborhood.

473
00:30:33,917 --> 00:30:35,419
I'm so sorry about this.

474
00:30:35,335 --> 00:30:37,045
Shut it!

475
00:30:37,087 --> 00:30:39,173
So let me catch you up.

476
00:30:39,173 --> 00:30:42,885
I need to know something that only my ex-wife 
can tell me, but she doesn't want to.

477
00:30:42,885 --> 00:30:45,554
She needs a little incentive.
So that's where you come in.

478
00:30:45,554 --> 00:30:47,472
Wayne...

479
00:30:47,598 --> 00:30:48,724
please don't.

480
00:30:48,682 --> 00:30:51,560
Yeah? How is it gonna feel knowing...

481
00:30:51,602 --> 00:30:54,396
that you could've stopped this?

482
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:02,112
All right!

483
00:31:04,406 --> 00:31:06,825
I'll tell you.

484
00:31:13,916 --> 00:31:16,502
After I left you...

485
00:31:17,294 --> 00:31:23,008
a few months passed,
and I convinced myself

486
00:31:23,717 --> 00:31:26,303
that you'd forgotten about us.

487
00:31:26,803 --> 00:31:29,014
But I was wrong.

488
00:31:32,768 --> 00:31:34,686
How was Dylan? Did she behave herself?

489
00:31:34,728 --> 00:31:36,897
She's an angel.

490
00:31:37,397 --> 00:31:40,400
I... just hope I didn't
do something wrong.

491
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,401
What do you mean?

492
00:31:41,527 --> 00:31:44,530
Well, your ex-husband was
here earlier, and, of course,

493
00:31:44,571 --> 00:31:48,367
I didn't know it was him
until Dylan called him "Daddy."

494
00:31:48,867 --> 00:31:52,538
I-I'm sorry, I should've called you,
but Dylan was just so happy to see him.

495
00:31:52,538 --> 00:31:54,373
He bught her a bicycle and a doll.

496
00:31:54,414 --> 00:31:57,334
And won't let that doll out of her sight.

497
00:31:58,627 --> 00:32:01,421
Katherine, what's going on?

498
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:06,176
I was going to run again, 
but you didn't give me enough time.

499
00:32:07,261 --> 00:32:09,137
Wayne just drove up.

500
00:32:09,137 --> 00:32:11,348
Should we call the police?

501
00:32:11,765 --> 00:32:15,143
No. Let him in.

502
00:32:18,856 --> 00:32:23,777
I knew it was time to faceou and let
you know you were not welcome in my home,

503
00:32:23,777 --> 00:32:26,572
and neither were your gifts.

504
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:40,294
Do you know how much money
I spent looking for you?

505
00:32:40,252 --> 00:32:43,046
Well, I'm sure you still had enough
to buy liquor by the caseload.

506
00:32:43,672 --> 00:32:46,341
Look who's gotten sassy
while she's been away.

507
00:32:46,383 --> 00:32:48,093
Well, I think I like it.

508
00:32:48,051 --> 00:32:50,470
- What do you want, Wayne?
- I want my daughter back.

509
00:32:50,512 --> 00:32:52,681
Why? You gotten lazy in your old age?

510
00:32:52,806 --> 00:32:54,391
You need somebody smaller to pound on?

511
00:32:54,391 --> 00:32:56,101
I never touched a hair on her head!

512
00:32:56,059 --> 00:32:59,438
Yeah, but now she's gotten 
older and sassier,

513
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:01,106
I'm sure you'll find all
sorts of reasons to hit her.

514
00:33:01,106 --> 00:33:02,399
I don't have to ask, you know.

515
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:03,692
I could just go up there if I want.

516
00:33:03,692 --> 00:33:04,902
She is asleep!

517
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,445
- Get the hell out!
- I'm her father!

518
00:33:06,445 --> 00:33:08,572
I said no!

519
00:33:20,292 --> 00:33:21,585
I'm bleeding.

520
00:33:21,585 --> 00:33:23,212
Profusely.

521
00:33:23,212 --> 00:33:25,506
You should see a doctor.

522
00:33:32,179 --> 00:33:34,181
I'll be back for my daughter.

523
00:33:34,223 --> 00:33:35,933
You just
understand this--

524
00:33:35,891 --> 00:33:41,104
there is nothing that I will not do
to keep you away from her. Nothing.

525
00:33:47,861 --> 00:33:49,738
Are you all right? I heard a crash.

526
00:33:49,738 --> 00:33:52,825
Yeah, I-I hit him with
the candlestick, and...

527
00:33:52,908 --> 00:33:56,119
- he went down pretty hard.
- Thank God.

528
00:33:56,203 --> 00:34:01,708
You know, I think now would be a good time to
break out the 10-year-old scotch I've been saving.

529
00:34:04,628 --> 00:34:08,131
I honestly thought it was finally over.

530
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:11,218
I don't know how I could've been so wrong.

531
00:34:16,348 --> 00:34:18,559
Katherine!

532
00:34:20,727 --> 00:34:24,022
I came in to give her another blanket.

533
00:34:24,022 --> 00:34:27,234
Her hand is ice-cold!

534
00:34:33,657 --> 00:34:36,827
Aunt Lily told me I
couldn't go to the police.

535
00:34:36,827 --> 00:34:41,623
She'd said you'd make it seem like I
killed Dylan to keep you from taking her,

536
00:34:41,623 --> 00:34:44,960
so I let her bury my baby in the woods.

537
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,756
I knew I'd have to run away again, but I
also knew you'd never stop looking for me,

538
00:34:49,715 --> 00:34:52,301
so I came up with a plan.

539
00:34:52,342 --> 00:34:56,138
I found a girl in a Romanian orphanage 
who looked just like Dylan.

540
00:34:56,221 --> 00:34:58,140
The resemblance was uncanny.

541
00:34:58,182 --> 00:35:02,686
Her mother had died in childbirth,
and her father had been murdered.

542
00:35:03,061 --> 00:35:07,024
As I looked into those big,
blue eyes, I knew right then...

543
00:35:07,024 --> 00:35:10,736
she needed me as much as I needed her.

544
00:35:20,996 --> 00:35:23,790
I've never told that to anyone.

545
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:27,294
I even lied to Adam and
said it was your fault.

546
00:35:27,294 --> 00:35:31,089
And that's how I've
spent the last 12 years...

547
00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:34,593
just telling one lie after another.

548
00:35:37,846 --> 00:35:39,431
Hold it, hold it. 
I'm sorry, sir.

549
00:35:39,473 --> 00:35:42,267
We're having a party.
You can't park here.

550
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:45,354
So you let her die.

551
00:35:47,689 --> 00:35:51,276
If you don't mind, I need you
to park around the corner, okay?

552
00:35:52,694 --> 00:35:54,863
Thank you.

553
00:36:02,412 --> 00:36:05,624
You let my daughter die...

554
00:36:05,624 --> 00:36:07,835
like a dog.

555
00:36:07,835 --> 00:36:09,711
It was an accident.

556
00:36:09,837 --> 00:36:12,339
Then you buried her like one.

557
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,008
Because I had to.

558
00:36:15,133 --> 00:36:18,345
I knew if you
found out, you--

559
00:36:18,345 --> 00:36:20,138
that I would kill you.

560
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,569
Katherine! Where are you?

561
00:36:34,111 --> 00:36:37,239
Adam! Get out! He's got a gun!

562
00:37:05,517 --> 00:37:08,312
You just watch over him for a sec,
okay? I'm gonna call the cops.

563
00:37:08,353 --> 00:37:11,481
First we have to do something
to stop that bleeding.

564
00:37:20,407 --> 00:37:23,619
Go ahead. You call the cops.

565
00:37:24,244 --> 00:37:26,830
Ask for my buddy Romslo...

566
00:37:27,414 --> 00:37:30,042
or Captain McMurphy.

567
00:37:30,959 --> 00:37:34,171
We play softball together.

568
00:37:34,171 --> 00:37:37,257
Those guys'll take care of me.

569
00:37:37,257 --> 00:37:40,677
And even if I do a little time...

570
00:37:40,969 --> 00:37:43,847
you know this isn't over.

571
00:37:43,847 --> 00:37:49,186
I'll get out, and I'll find you, 
and I'll make you pay.

572
00:37:50,354 --> 00:37:53,273
I know you will.

573
00:38:19,883 --> 00:38:22,886
- Oh my God! Bree, are you all right?
- What the hell is going on?

574
00:38:22,928 --> 00:38:27,099
We don't have much time before
the police get here. Please talk.

575
00:38:29,351 --> 00:38:32,271
Excuse me. Susan!

576
00:38:32,813 --> 00:38:34,314
- Come here, come here.
- What's going on?

577
00:38:34,314 --> 00:38:36,400
Okay, just listen to me.

578
00:38:40,529 --> 00:38:42,406
Ma'am, you have to talk to us.

579
00:38:42,531 --> 00:38:46,201
We need to know what happened. Ma'am?

580
00:38:48,203 --> 00:38:51,123
Then he raised the
gun and came toward us.

581
00:38:51,123 --> 00:38:54,001
Thank God, Katherine grabbed
his arm and got the gun away.

582
00:38:54,042 --> 00:38:57,254
That lunatic would've killed us all.

583
00:38:57,212 --> 00:39:00,591
I knew Wayne was the reason she moved
away, and the second she moved back,

584
00:39:00,591 --> 00:39:02,926
he started stalking her again.

585
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:06,221
She was always telling
us how terrified she was.

586
00:39:06,221 --> 00:39:10,017
We always knew he'd do something
like this eventually, and he did.

587
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,445
Look...

588
00:39:21,403 --> 00:39:23,906
this was obviously self-defense.

589
00:39:23,947 --> 00:39:26,658
Take the cuffs off,
get her to the hospital.

590
00:39:44,968 --> 00:39:48,347
Mom? Mom! Oh, my!

591
00:39:49,473 --> 00:39:52,267
I'm so sorry, Mom.

592
00:40:00,943 --> 00:40:03,237
"Five Years Later"

593
00:40:07,241 --> 00:40:10,744
<i>There's a ritual my friends
have observed for years.</i></i>

594
00:40:10,744 --> 00:40:15,666
<i>Once a week, they meet to play a game
of cards and talk about their lives.</i></i>

595
00:40:15,707 --> 00:40:18,585
<i>Of course, there's another
aspect to these gatherings</i></i>

596
00:40:18,544 --> 00:40:22,256
<i>that has nothing to do
with gossip or poker.</i></i>

597
00:40:22,297 --> 00:40:27,594
<i>Every seven days, my friends are
reminded of a basic human truth:</i></i>

598
00:40:27,594 --> 00:40:32,099
<i>There is nothing more important
than friendships that endure,</i></i>

599
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:36,395
<i>especially in a world
that insists on changing.</i></i>

600
00:40:36,854 --> 00:40:39,356
Okay, my friends are gone.

601
00:40:39,398 --> 00:40:42,109
I'm ready to fix you dinner.

602
00:40:42,985 --> 00:40:45,112
What the hell are you doing?

603
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:48,365
Hey, Mommy, we're playing fashion model!

604
00:40:48,407 --> 00:40:50,701
Look at this mess!

605
00:40:50,784 --> 00:40:54,580
You are lucky I got in here
before you touched my dresses!

606
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:57,207
Run, Celia, run!

607
00:40:57,624 --> 00:41:00,127
My Vera Wang?

608
00:41:02,129 --> 00:41:03,630
I'm home!

609
00:41:03,589 --> 00:41:05,215
Oh, thank God.

610
00:41:05,257 --> 00:41:07,050
The publisher sent over
the galley for the cookbook.

611
00:41:07,009 --> 00:41:08,510
He needs you to proof them tonight.

612
00:41:08,552 --> 00:41:10,929
I've also got the woman from
the New York Times on the phone.

613
00:41:10,888 --> 00:41:12,389
She wants to do the interview now.

614
00:41:12,431 --> 00:41:13,849
Is that you, Bree?

615
00:41:13,849 --> 00:41:15,225
The water's getting cold.

616
00:41:15,225 --> 00:41:18,854
Uh, leave the galleys in my office and tell the
woman from the Times to call me back in the morning.

617
00:41:19,146 --> 00:41:22,024
I'm gonna have a nice
bubble bath with my husband.

618
00:41:22,024 --> 00:41:24,234
Coming, Orson!

619
00:41:26,236 --> 00:41:29,031
Why is there a police
car in our driveway?

620
00:41:28,989 --> 00:41:30,699
I was telling your husband
we just picked up your son.

621
00:41:30,782 --> 00:41:33,911
He broke into a car at the
mall and took it for a joyride.

622
00:41:33,911 --> 00:41:35,579
Again?

623
00:41:35,621 --> 00:41:37,456
I am so sorry, officer.

624
00:41:37,414 --> 00:41:40,083
We have talked to Porter
till we're blue in the face.

625
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:43,045
It's like he's determined
to go back to juvenile halL.

626
00:41:43,045 --> 00:41:45,839
Honey, it wasn't Porter this time.

627
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:48,217
They arrested Preston.

628
00:41:51,136 --> 00:41:53,430
It's me, Mom. I'm back from Paris.

629
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:57,518
It was just as gorgeous as you said it
would be, and you're not gonna believe this.

630
00:41:57,518 --> 00:42:01,438
Bradley finally asked me to marry him
right there under the Eiffel tower.

631
00:42:01,438 --> 00:42:04,024
I'm so happy. Call me back.

632
00:42:09,363 --> 00:42:11,865
Honey? I'm home.

633
00:42:14,368 --> 00:42:16,286
Did you miss me?

634
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:18,413
You know I did.
