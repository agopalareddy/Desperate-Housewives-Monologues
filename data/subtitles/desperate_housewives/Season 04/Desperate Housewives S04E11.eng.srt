1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,630
Previously on...

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:03,850
Bree moved in...

3
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:06,920
You can stay as long as you want. mike went to rehab...

4
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:08,770
I will fix this.

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,740
Carlos faced a permanent illness...

6
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,760
She's not gonna leave you because you lost your sight.

7
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,400
you don't know gaby.

8
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,540
Dylan had questions about her father...

9
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:17,480
The only thing you need to know

10
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,610
About that man is he was a monster. why would you not tell me that?

11
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,310
And adam uncovered a secret...

12
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,070
You told me it was all his fault.

13
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:28,560
Now I find out it was yours.

14
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:32,620
That one person wished he hadn't.

15
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,110
Katherine mayfair

16
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,580
Was not the kind of woman who liked to relive the past.

17
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:45,920
But when her husband adam left her,

18
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,280
Katherine's life began to unravel,

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,350
And the mistakes of her youth

20
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,220
Started to flash through her mind.

21
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:58,210
She thought of wayne davis,the first man she married...

22
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:01,610
And the first time he had hit her.

23
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:05,120
She thought of how sincerely he apologized...

24
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:08,410
And how meaningless his apologies were...

25
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,910
And how she finally decided...

26
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,680
To hit back.

27
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,880
These were the thoughts going through katherine's mind....

28
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:19,820
When her friends and neighbors arrived...

29
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,280
Bearing gifts.

30
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,440
Well,hello there.

31
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,530
What's all this?

32
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,760
We brought you muffins.

33
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:29,600
And jam.

34
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,540
Okay,uh,what's the occasion?

35
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,940
Well,we heard you were having a rough time.

36
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,780
So we just wanted you to know that we're here for you.

37
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,400
Ah,so word is out that adam's left me,

38
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:43,440
And you thought thatmuffins and jam

39
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,790
Would help me pick up the pieces.

40
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,060
The jam was bree's idea.

41
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,240
Susan! I wanted to bring flowers,and I was shot down.

42
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:54,180
That's all I'm saying. katherine,we didn't come here to upset you.

43
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,890
No,we thought that you just might need someone to talk to.

44
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,130
No,you just thought you'd get the juicy details. no,we came here.

45
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:05,510
We wanted to help you,to fix you lunch or clean your house.

46
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,830
Or offer up our own houses for you to clean,

47
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:11,960
If that's your thing.

48
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,670
I'm fine,truly,

49
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,520
And I do appreciate your concern,

50
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,880
But... you know...

51
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:20,780
Okay.

52
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,440
I told them you weren't into jam.

53
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:24,970
Susan!

54
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,720
Look,I don't mean to pry,

55
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,290
But given what I know about you and adam,

56
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,930
I'm surprised he was the one to do the leaving.

57
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,430
Well,bree,the truth is...

58
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,520
I really don't want to talk about it.

59
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,060
I understand,but whatever you do,

60
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,750
Don't keep your feelings bottled up.

61
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,600
You've got to let 'em out.

62
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,340
I'll do that.

63
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,000
Yes,katherine mayfair

64
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,130
Was not a woman who liked to relive the past.

65
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,210
But lately,her life had begun to unravel.

66
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,000
And she couldn't help thinking

67
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:29,790
Of all the mistakes she had made...

68
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,090
And especially...

69
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,030
The ones she had buried.

73
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,210
It happened once a week on wisteria lane

74
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,320
Like clockwork.

75
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,940
The faithful would emerge from their homes

76
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:56,440
In their sunday best...

77
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:59,080
With their family bibles...

78
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,360
And their rosary beads...

79
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:04,570
And they would head off

80
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:07,270
To their various houses of worship,

81
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,920
Passing by a certain nonbeliever

82
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:13,510
Who had never taken an interest in their ritual.

83
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,720
But on this day,

84
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,490
Lynette scavo,for the first time in her life,

85
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,230
Was struck by something...

86
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,870
Get the ball.

87
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,270
Something she would later think of

88
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:32,580
As divine inspiration.

89
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,250
We should go to church.

90
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,380
What? why? what did we do?

91
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,220
Ah,it's just...

92
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,150
We've been through a lot lately,

93
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,500
And we have a lot to be thankful for.

94
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:49,900
Don't you think we owe the big guy a little face time?

95
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,760
Fine,fine. we'll go to church...

96
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:54,290
Next week.

97
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,180
Tom...

98
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:59,980
I'm serious. what's the rush? god will still be there next sunday.

99
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,360
The pistons,on the other hand...

100
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:05,380
They lose today,they're gone for good. so I'm clear,

101
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,870
You can't be bothered with saving your eternal soul

102
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,570
Because the pistons have no defense?

103
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,140
Okay,look.

104
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,250
You didn't grow up going to church. I did.

105
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:18,190
My parents dragged me to st. anthony's every sunday.

106
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,050
I've done my time.

107
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,420
Well,I haven't.

108
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,390
I have some questions I would like answered.

109
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:27,080
And I don't know anything about god or jesus,

110
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,590
And our kids don't either. well,

111
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,610
you don't have to go to church to learn that stuff.

112
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,400
Yeah,I know about jesus.

113
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,260
See?

114
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,320
He's the guy who helps out santa claus.

115
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:47,150
Get dressed,kids. we're going to church.

116
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,560
Mm-hmm. right.

117
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,290
Orson,I don't want to be late.

118
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:59,340
Services don't start 30. yes,

119
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,460
but I'm sure edna fletcher has been there since 9:00,

120
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,830
Kissing up to reverend sykes.

121
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,310
Is this about the ladies' auxiliary again? damn right.

122
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,860
Bree,please,such language on a sunday. I am sorry,

123
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:08,260
but I have to make sure

124
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,670
That he doesn't let her chair that committee. well,how could he?

125
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,180
you plan every pancake breakfast.

126
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,380
You organize every bake sale. you'd be a saint

127
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,950
If our church believed in that sort of hogwash.

128
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,300
Exactly,and all the while,where was edna?

129
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:20,310
Lounging around in zimbabwe in the peace corps.

130
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:23,270
She won't let any of us forget it. well,I wouldn't worry.

131
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,550
Edna's "curing the village of dysentery" story

132
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,880
Has long since lost its novelty.

133
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,020
Oh,lynette. hi. you look pretty.

134
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,570
What are you all dressed up for?

135
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,650
Well,I decided I should go to church today.

136
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:38,360
Yeah,tom said the same thing.

137
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,990
Anyway,since you're the most religious person I know,

138
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:44,410
I was wondering if you would take us to your church. I would love that.

139
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,320
We're--we're leaving right now. you can follow us.

140
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:49,620
Great! just give me a second to sell tom on the idea.

141
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:53,130
You know,he was raised catholic. oh,don't go catholic.

142
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,940
All that standing and kneeling and genuflecting--

143
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,830
I go for worship,not a workout.

144
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,160
Mm. not to mention the incense,which smells good at first

145
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:04,570
Until you feel your breakfast coming back up.

146
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:05,820
Okay.

147
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,880
Well,I'll be right back.

148
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,230
Oh,this is so exciting. I'm going to church.

149
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,840
By the way,what am I now?

150
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,890
Presbyterian.

151
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:19,470
Right.

152
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,620
Thank you. thank you for coming.

153
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,080
Oh,shoot.

154
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,500
Did I miss mass?

155
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,840
Was it at 9:00?

156
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,370
Yes,gabrielle. 9:00 mass is still at 9:00.

157
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,640
Oh,that's good to know.

158
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,880
Uh,father,can I talk to you?

159
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:45,540
Of course. I've actually been expecting you to come by.

160
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,450
Why?

161
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,830
Well,I thought you might need some comforting

162
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,490
After your husband's death.

163
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,170
Oh,that.

164
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:55,400
Yeah,I was a little blue,

165
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,580
But the good news is,I've bounced back.

166
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,230
Really?

167
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,840
Okay,this may come as a little shock to you...

168
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,770
But guess who's getting married again?

169
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,660
And I was thinking,

170
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,890
Maybe you could perform the ceremony.

171
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,230
Is tuesday good for you?

172
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,160
Uh...

173
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,550
Victor's only been dead two weeks.

174
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:22,320
Yeah,I know,but I'm no good single.

175
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:24,310
Honestly,I don't know how you do it.

176
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,620
Well,who is this man? did you just meet him?

177
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,470
No. no,no,no,no. it's carlos.

178
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:31,820
Carlos? i-i didn't know you two were even speaking.

179
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,340
Oh,yeah. we bumped into each other a few months ago,

180
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,250
And we just fell in love all over again.

181
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,180
Uh,a few months ago?

182
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:42,600
But you were married six months ago.

183
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,610
Boy,you are just determined to make this awkward,aren't ya?

184
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:46,950
Oh,gabrielle.

185
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,550
Okay,look,in the eyes of the church,

186
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,400
Carlos and I were never divorced.

187
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,980
Technically,the affair was with victor,

188
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,860
And god smote him.

189
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,140
So we're good.

190
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,270
All right,yes,I've been a bad catholic.

191
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:05,300
Enough with the guilt thing. are you gonna marry us or not?

192
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,010
Fine,as long as you promise

193
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:11,400
To stay married to carlos for the rest of your life.

194
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,300
Absolutely.

195
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,530
Oh,but if I don't,I promise you,

196
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,750
I will change religions.

197
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:21,620
Thank you.

198
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,850
Sorry. no,this is good.

199
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:31,150
Accountants always appreciate it when people take the time

200
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,720
To develop a sophisticated filing system.

201
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,820
Are you always this sarcastic with your clients?

202
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:38,270
Nope,just my favorite cousin.

203
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,570
I so appreciate you helping us out.

204
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,190
Mike would be doing our taxes,but he's off...

205
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,640
Getting better.

206
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:48,220
Mom told me. besides,I'm happy to have the work.

207
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,200
Yeah,I was sorry to hear about your job.

208
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,020
You know,ever since n.a.f.t.a.,

209
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:56,700
Corporate outsourcing has been the bane of the american worker.

210
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,400
Is that right? I heard somebody say that on n.p.r.,

211
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,360
And I just keep repeating it to people.

212
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:06,200
Actually,I wish I could blame losing my job on n.a.f.t.a.,

213
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:09,570
But it really has more to do with chloe.

214
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,850
My boss' daughter.

215
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:13,230
Oh,tim.

216
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:16,730
I don't know why he got so mad. I mean,she was 18.

217
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:18,470
Okay,so back to these receipts.

218
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,880
What is it about a girl in a cheerleader outfit?

219
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:25,020
Done catching up. all about accounting now.

220
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:27,280
Come on,susan. you're acting like I'm some sort of creep. no,

221
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,870
i know you're not.

222
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,810
I mean,18's legal.

223
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,510
I checked with a lawyer before I did anything.

224
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,280
These receipts are self-explanatory.

225
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,190
I'd even know why I'm here.

226
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,130
This is the nourishment

227
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:48,610
Each soul requires to go from acorn to oak.

228
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:51,490
And this is what should bring us peace in our hearts--

229
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,030
The blessed knowledge that god's love for us

230
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,490
Is as sure as the sunlight

231
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:58,720
And that it is always shining.

232
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,420
We only need see it.

233
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:01,850
Amen? amen.

234
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,580
Now if you'll take out your hymnals

235
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:08,010
And turn to page 335.

236
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,910
What are you doing? I've got a question about his sermon.

237
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:15,480
What? no. put your hand down.

238
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:18,920
It'll just take a sec. lynette,please,we don't do that here.

239
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:21,480
Uh,yes,can I help you?

240
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,950
Hi. I'm lynette scavo.

241
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:29,040
I'm a friend of bree hodge. and your sermon was lovely,

242
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:31,500
Especially the part about the trees.

243
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,530
Thank you. but here's where you lost me--

244
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,240
"god's love is as sure as the sunlight."

245
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:39,690
Yes,absolutely.

246
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,860
There. you have your answer. now sit.

247
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:46,400
The reason I ask is,there are wars all over the world,

248
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,530
And it seems like every month,

249
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,350
Some dumb-ass walks into a school

250
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,940
And starts shooting children.

251
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,060
So I'm thinking,god's love?

252
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,860
Not so sure.

253
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:00,100
Did she just say "dumb-ass"?

254
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,370
Ah,the eternal question--

255
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:05,410
"why do bad things happen to good people?"

256
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:09,530
What you have to remember is,god gave us free will.

257
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:14,250
Much of the evil in the world is brought on by man himself.

258
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,670
Oh,lord.

259
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:17,970
Yes,lynette?

260
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,920
Okay,I give you that one.

261
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:21,810
But what about the tornado that just happened?

262
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,820
You can't blame man for that.

263
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:26,010
Get the keys ready. we'll slip out the back.

264
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,120
you bring up a big theological issue,

265
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,750
One that deserves a lot more time to explore.

266
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,300
Why don't you come to our tuesday night bible study?

267
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:35,260
We can discuss it then.

268
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:39,080
Well,sure. I'm easy. thanks.

269
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:50,010
Katherine,dylan,hi. what's up?

270
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:52,170
Julie and I have a study date,

271
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:55,220
And my mom wants to apologize for being rude...

272
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,130
Again.

273
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,930
Is this about the other day?

274
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:01,060
Yes. you were just trying to help,

275
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:04,210
And I shouldn't have reacted the way I did.

276
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,360
Oh,please. after what you've been through,

277
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,840
No one is judging. come on in.

278
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,360
I'll put on some coffee.

279
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:15,540
Oh,um,this is my cousin tim. tim,this is the neighbors.

280
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,310
Mrs. davis?

281
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,530
Davis? nobody's called me that in years.

282
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,440
Do we know each other?

283
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,340
Oh,of course you do. that's right!

284
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,670
This is my cousin timmy.

285
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:29,120
He stayed with us

286
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,230
That summer that he went to band camp.

287
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:34,020
Oh! yes.

288
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:34,820
I remember.

289
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:37,930
Gosh,you're all grown up. it's nice to see you again.

290
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,660
You,too. hold it. is this little dylan?

291
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,040
Can you believe it?

292
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,650
Wow! the last time I saw you,you were pulling a wagon.

293
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,310
Oh.

294
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:51,740
How old are you now? I turn 18 next week.

295
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,850
Really?

296
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,430
18?

297
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,410
Julie,dylan's here! study time!

298
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,170
I'm... sorry.

299
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,610
That was probably a little louder than it needed to be.

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Over p.a.)

301
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,250
Edie,is that you?

302
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,080
Oh,my god. you knew it was me

303
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,510
Just from the sound of my footsteps?

304
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,200
No,from your perfume.

305
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,110
I smelled it the moment you hit the parking lot.

306
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:29,770
Look,there's no reason to be pissy.

307
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:32,090
I'm here to do something nice.

308
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:32,980
Really?

309
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:37,100
I feel bad about the whole losing-all-of-your-money thing.

310
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,940
Even though we know tornado-- clearly not my fault.

311
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,040
Um...

312
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:46,260
Anyway,i-i thought maybe this...

313
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,490
Would help.

314
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,280
It's the diamond bracelet you gave me.

315
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,220
It must be worth thousands of dollars.

316
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,490
Do you think you still have the receipt for it?

317
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:02,630
Uh... I think I threw it out.

318
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,030
Oh. well,you said it was from cartier,right?

319
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,830
I'm sure they have some sort of record.

320
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,750
Carlos?

321
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:14,860
Actually,the box was from cartier.

322
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,400
The bracelet's from...

323
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,540
A swap meet.

324
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,100
Hold it.

325
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,950
Are you saying

326
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,170
That those diamonds are cubic zirconias?

327
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,720
If we're lucky.

328
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:34,110
You son of a bitch. I gave you my heart,

329
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,660
And all you could give me was fake jewelry?

330
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:41,420
Edie...  I'm sorry. I never thought you'd find out.

331
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,260
I just spat on one of your jell-o cubes.

332
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,810
Happy hunting.

333
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:56,570
Hey,you. do you know how long it's gonna be

334
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,120
Until carlos gets his sight back?

335
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,350
Because I have a 2-word sentence I'd like to say to him,

336
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,900
And there's a hand gesture that goes along with it.

337
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:07,240
I don't know. mr. solis' condition is very serious.

338
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,510
Serious? what's wrong?

339
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:09,970
Well...

340
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,980
You know,you should really talk to the doctor about this.

341
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,690
I don't even think his girlfriend knows.

342
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,740
You mean gaby?

343
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,860
I'm sorry. I said too much already.

344
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:28,920
Oh,please don't tell me that's your lunch.

345
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,560
Yeah. I'm sort of on a budget.

346
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:34,350
No,no,no. if you're gonna give quality care,

347
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,320
You're gonna need some quality food.

348
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:39,120
Now I know of this great,little french bistro.

349
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,150
It's the perfect place for lunch...

350
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:45,220
And conversation.

351
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,880
"your father was murdered."

352
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,530
Wow.

353
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,410
I know.

354
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,530
Are you sure your aunt knew what she was writing?

355
00:16:55,690 --> 00:17:01,230
She was pretty sick. no,she had it together,even on that last day.

356
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:03,430
I remember aunt lily really wanted to tell me something,

357
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:06,430
And then my mom just came in and stopped her.

358
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:07,850
Does your mom know you found this?

359
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,710
No,and I'm not gonna tell her either.

360
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,710
Why give her another chance to lie to me?

361
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,870
That's why I'm going to adam.

362
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:21,000
I can trust him to tell me the truth.

363
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:23,040
I just don't get it.

364
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,400
I mean,why would your mom lie about your dad being murdered?

365
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,910
Are you serious?

366
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:32,490
Julie...

367
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,610
She's the one who killed him.

368
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:41,420
Hi,babe.

369
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,390
I'm about to do something that's gonna make you very happy.

370
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,020
Great,but close the curtain first.

371
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,360
Last time,the nurse almost walked in

372
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:50,540
When you were about to-- carlos! I have a priest with me.

373
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,910
Priest? what,is there something

374
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,600
The doctors aren't telling me?

375
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,560
No,no,no. I wanted it to be a surprise,

376
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:01,080
But we're getting married!

377
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:05,200
Father,hit it.

378
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:07,570
Dearly beloved,we are gathered here

379
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,710
In the presence of-- whoa,whoa,whoa.

380
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:12,300
Gaby,what's the rush?

381
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:15,290
I don't know. just after everything we've been through,

382
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:17,240
There's nothing in our way now.

383
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,430
We can finally be together.

384
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,310
And I really need that.

385
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,710
I need a happy ending,carlos.

386
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:29,620
So what do you say? will you marry me?

387
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,830
Okay.

388
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:38,680
Holy matrimony. bring it on.

389
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,990
Gaby,before we get started,

390
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:43,000
There's something that I need to tell you...

391
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,970
In private.

392
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In distance)

393
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,940
Okay,he's gone. what's up?

394
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:56,370
Look,I haven't been completely honest with you

395
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,770
About the extent of my injury.

396
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,360
Okay.

397
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,740
The doctor says...

398
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:06,090
I might not get my sight back.

399
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,450
For three months. four,tops.

400
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:13,110
I-i just want to make sure that you can handle that.

401
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,240
Wow.

402
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:18,740
That's... a really long time.

403
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:24,910
But for better or worse,right?

404
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,540
Right.

405
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,520
Okay,padre.

406
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:35,150
We're ready. let's take it from the top.

407
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:37,770
Dearly beloved,we are gathered here in the sight of god

408
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,860
To join this man and this woman

409
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:43,090
In the holy sacrament of matrimony.

410
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:50,190
You're out of milk. you want me to pick some up?

411
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:51,580
No,that's okay. it can wait.

412
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,690
I don't mind. I could use a little air anyway.

413
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:54,690
Mm.

414
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,020
Hmm.

415
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:02,540
Mm.

416
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:16,210
Tim! where's that milk?

417
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,650
Oh,I thought you didn't want any. uh...

418
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,530
I'm having a baby.

419
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,570
I can't give birth with brittle bones. go!

420
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,550
Bye!

421
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:35,010
Hey,church buddy. look what I got.

422
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,980
Wow,you bought a bible.

423
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:39,640
Yeah,and I'm breaking her in tonight.

424
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,790
Nothing like that new bible smell.

425
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,910
Oh,so you're...

426
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:47,830
Coming to bible study. yeah,and I hope the reverend's ready,

427
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:51,690
Cause I got about a zillion questions for him.

428
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:53,030
Lynette,i-i realize

429
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,800
You don't have much experience with churches,

430
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,890
So this really isn't your fault.

431
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,470
What isn't my fault?

432
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,800
Well,last sunday,when you kept raising your hand...

433
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,860
We don't really do that.

434
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,740
The church isn't a place for questions.

435
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,950
It's a place for answers.

436
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,870
Yeah,but how do you get the answers

437
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,700
If you don't ask the questions?

438
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,940
Well,typically,we sit there and let the preacher preach,

439
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:18,430
And eventually,our questions are answered,

440
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,000
And no one is humiliated.

441
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,700
I'm sorry. did I embarrass you on sunday?

442
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:26,280
Well,it's just that in our church,

443
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,080
People don't talk back to the minister.

444
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,470
Well,what if I need to?

445
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,100
What if that's the kind of church I'm looking for?

446
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,890
Well,then maybe you should explore other options.

447
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:39,360
I mean,if you really enjoy talking ck to the pulpit,

448
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,590
Why don't you try

449
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,240
That gospel church by the airport?

450
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,010
Okay.

451
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,530
Or,uh,the unitarians.

452
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,920
From what I hear,those folks are "anything goes."

453
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,090
Hey,adam. it's dylan.

454
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,190
I waited at your hotel all day,but you never came back.

455
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,950
You have to call me. I found this note that aunt lily wrote.

456
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,030
Mom threw it in the fireplace,but I fished it out,

457
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,000
And I have to talk to you.

458
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,310
Call me on my cell,not at home,'cause i--

459
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:26,550
She doesn't know anything. I can hear it in her voice.

460
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:30,360
But she's got the note. maybe a few burnt pieces.

461
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,490
Trust me,all she's got are questions.

462
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:35,940
Well,I could,um,refuse to see her.

463
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:39,540
Yeah,'cause that won't arouse her suspicion.

464
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:44,180
No. you are going to ask her to come here,

465
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,340
And then you're going to find out

466
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,800
Exactly what she knows and what she doesn't.

467
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,770
After all these years,maybe it would be easier

468
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,730
Just to finally tell her the truth.

469
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:55,530
And you would just wave good-bye as they cart me off to jail?

470
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:58,030
She wouldn't call the police.

471
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,240
Seriously,I think you two have a great relationship.

472
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:05,410
Then you have not been paying attention.

473
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,590
Give me a chance to get home,

474
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:11,730
Then call her and set up a time for you two to meet. okay.

475
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:15,370
You know...

476
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:19,300
When you called me tonight,

477
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:23,210
I was half hoping you missed me.

478
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,290
Really?

479
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:30,250
I miss you.

480
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,290
I'm so terribly lonely.

481
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:39,540
You know I don't do well on my own.

482
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:44,340
Is there any chance we could...

483
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:48,420
Get past this,and you could come back home?

484
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,240
I will talk to dylan.

485
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:57,410
I will provide you one last alibi.

486
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:00,440
After that,I'm done.

487
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:16,930
Are you guys outta here? yes,I'm gonna run some errands,

488
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,840
And orson's gonna take benjamin to the park.

489
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:21,060
Actually,I thought I might take him to the museum.

490
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,820
You know how much benjamin loves matisse.

491
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:26,440
Benjamin doesn't love matisse. he loves purple. oh.

492
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:29,830
Please stop trying to turn our son into an intellectual. mm.

493
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:36,010
If you saw how her first two turned out,

494
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,920
You'd understand how important it is

495
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,230
For me to fight the van de kamp d.n.a.

496
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:58,620
Hey,it's tim.

497
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,910
It was great seeing you the other day.

498
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:05,220
Yeah,I can't stop thinking about you either.

499
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:10,010
So listen,um,I've got the whole place to myself.

500
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:12,380
You wanna come over?

501
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,880
Hey,gaby.

502
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:17,640
I heard you and carlos got married yesterday.

503
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,950
Guess this means you win.

504
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:22,860
Oh,edie,it wasn't a competition,

505
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:25,150
But,yeah,I guess I did.

506
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,250
Yeah,but I think it's all for the best.

507
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,000
I mean,after all,I could have never been

508
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:32,470
The hero that you're about to be.

509
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,790
Hero? why am I a hero?

510
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,400
Committing your life to a man who's blind?

511
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,640
My god,you're gonna have to do everything for him--

512
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:42,780
Dress him,shave him,lead him to the bathroom,

513
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:46,080
Pray that his aim is halfway decent. it's not a big deal.

514
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,300
Carlos is gonna get his sight back in three months.

515
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,560
Four,tops.

516
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:54,110
Is that what he told you? you poor,gullible fool.

517
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,030
What are you talking about?

518
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:00,610
I hate to be the one to tell you this,

519
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:02,220
But I talked to the nurse,

520
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,600
And she said that his condition is...

521
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,370
Oh,what's the word? um...

522
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:07,610
Oh,yeah.

523
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,050
Permanent.

524
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,250
I don't believe you.

525
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,690
Call the doctor if you'd like.

526
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:16,490
And apparently,he was begging carlos to tell you.

527
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:20,150
No. no,no,no. this can't be true.

528
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,420
Look on the bright side.

529
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,080
Women who are married to blind guys

530
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:27,300
Don't have to worry about makeup or getting fat.

531
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:32,140
Are you sure you didn't already know about this?

532
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,950
Okay,I'm calling dr. dunlap.

533
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:38,430
You do that. oh,and by the way,

534
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,200
Congrats on your big win.

535
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,800
So how's your occupational therapy going?

536
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:51,030
Do they still have you scrubbing pots in the kitchen?

537
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:53,440
No,no. once they found out I'm a professional plumber,

538
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,810
I got promoted to scrubbing toilets. mm,well,maybe you won't mind

539
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:58,780
Doing a little scrubbing when you come home next week. actually,

540
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,450
the doctors kinda frown on that.

541
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:02,990
They encourage us to leave that sort of stuff behind.

542
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:04,100
Well,it doesn't have to be toilets.

543
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:05,910
I mean,it could be sinks,bathtubs.

544
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:08,860
You're making me wanna use,susan.

545
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,970
This junkie thing's awesome.

546
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:14,020
Oh,I forgot. uh,tim has some questions about the taxes.

547
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:17,210
Do you mind talking to him? no,I don't mind. though I can't believe

548
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:21,330
He'd have any trouble with your cookie tin filing system.

549
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:27,590
Hello? hey,uh,tim,I've got mike here.

550
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:28,780
Do you want to talk to him?

551
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,550
Uh,can I do that later? I'm sort of taking a nap.

552
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:38,310
What was that? is someone there?

553
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,900
What? no. no. unh-unh. no--no one's here.

554
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,810
Really? cause it sounded like a girl.

555
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:46,710
No,uh,it--it was just the tv.

556
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:49,100
I thought you were taking a nap.

557
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:51,440
Uh,the tv helps me sleep.

558
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:54,430
Uh,tell mike I'll call him later.

559
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,930
I've gotta go.

560
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,580
What? what? you just got here.

561
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:03,780
I know,but this visit was really more for julie.

562
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:06,230
For me? yeah,you're going to college soon,

563
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,960
And I want him to tell you about the dangers of drugs.

564
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:11,930
Scare her straight,mike.

565
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:16,620
Honey,you down here?

566
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:18,230
Yes,sweetheart.

567
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:21,160
I'm in the kitchen making dinner.

568
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:23,290
Mmm. smells good.

569
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,110
It's a new recipe for beef stew.

570
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,980
I think you're gonna love it.

571
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,400
Why don't we let that simmer?

572
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,550
During my nap,I had the filthiest little dream.

573
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:36,140
I was kinda hoping maybe we could...

574
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,140
Skip straight to dessert?

575
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,680
Yeah.

576
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:41,590
What do you say?

577
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,950
I'd say I'm one step ahead of you.

578
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:47,770
I have already slipped into my pink lace teddy,

579
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:50,580
And I'm wearing those whore-y pumps that you love.

580
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,290
Ooh,I like that image. where are you?

581
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,310
I'm right here,babe.

582
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,800
Ow!

583
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,280
Oh,I'm sorry. I forgot that was open.

584
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,080
Let's do it over here,on the table.

585
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,790
Can you give me a hand?

586
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,570
Can't. my legs are in the air.

587
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,600
Just follow the sound of my voice.

588
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:15,690
There you go.

589
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:18,410
I'm over here,sweetie.

590
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,960
Whoa! uhh! son of a bitch!

591
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,230
Ooh,I meant to move that.

592
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:27,240
Hang on. let me just pull my panties up so I can help you.

593
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,540
Okay. here.

594
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,950
Let's go do it over here.

595
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:37,760
Aah! damn it! what the hell is going on?!

596
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:39,320
I'll tell you what's going on.

597
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:43,040
"in three months. four,tops."

598
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,290
Uh-oh.

599
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:46,150
"uh-oh" is right,you blind bastard!

600
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:50,170
Ow! all right,I'm sorry. I shouldn't have lied! oh,no,no.

601
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:51,930
i think it was a fantastic plan.

602
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,920
I mean,there's no way I ever would have figured out

603
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:58,400
That I was married to a permanently blind guy!

604
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,910
Ow!

605
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:03,060
All right,I just thought that by the time you did,

606
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:04,890
You'd be used to the idea,

607
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:08,090
And maybe then you wouldn't leave me.

608
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,060
Leave you?

609
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,870
Do you really think I'm that shallow?

610
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,250
Gaby,I'm poor and I'm blind,

611
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,470
And let's face it.

612
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:22,610
There is nothing about that that is your type.

613
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:26,030
Wow. thanks for the vote of confidence.

614
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,710
Y-yes,the truth would have freaked me out,

615
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,270
But I would have come around.

616
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:36,140
If you had just had a little faith in me,

617
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,230
I could have proven to you that I was up for the challenge,

618
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,360
But you robbed me of that chance. I'm sorry.

619
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,860
Good.

620
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,960
To avoid future confusion,I love you,

621
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:51,370
And I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

622
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:57,660
Gaby,this is not going to be easy.

623
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:00,080
I know,

624
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,000
But like I said,

625
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,790
"for better or for worse."

626
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:12,800
Think you can forgive me?

627
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:15,040
I'll work on it.

628
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,630
While you're working on it,

629
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:19,770
Mind if I dig into some of that stew?

630
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,290
Sure.

631
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,140
Ugh! get off that poor girl right now!

632
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,880
I finished your taxes.

633
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:51,670
What the hell is going on here? susan,I'm so sorry.

634
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:52,580
No,katherine,

635
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,870
I know what you've been going through emotionally,

636
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,230
So you don't have to apologize.

637
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:59,650
And by the way,your boob is out. oh.

638
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,740
You,on the other hand-- I know. I know.

639
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,930
I don't understand you. is this something you do?

640
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,840
You worm your way into a neighborhood

641
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:08,070
With the promise of free tax preparation,

642
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:11,210
And then you jump on the nearest middle-aged divorcéE? hey!

643
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,250
It's not like that. she came over for some drinks,

644
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:15,510
And we got to talking and started reminiscing,

645
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,090
And all these old feelings came rushing back.

646
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:21,530
Oh,nice try,timmy. like I'm really going to believe that.

647
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:25,340
Shame on you. just... shame!

648
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,230
What do you mean,"old feelings"?

649
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:36,910
Do we really need to get into this?

650
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:38,930
What do you have to reminisce about?

651
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:41,250
He was here for a week when he was 16.

652
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:43,770
What could you two have even...

653
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,670
Oh,my god,you slept together.

654
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:46,220
Okay,

655
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,330
before you get some sordid image in your head-- she took my virginity.

656
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,720
Do you have to say it like that?

657
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:53,300
that's how I said it to every single guy at band camp.

658
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:55,530
Shame on you!

659
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:57,170
His mother trusted me to take care of him,

660
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,280
And you swoop in

661
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,090
Like some swooping,sex-craved--

662
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,660
Oh,for god sakes,tim! pull up the blanket!

663
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:06,500
You can't blame it on katherine. I knew exactly what I was doing.

664
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,990
I don't want to hear this. I'm done with both of you.

665
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,520
If anybody needs me,I'll be at the mall...

666
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,650
Buying sheets.

667
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,010
Good morning. I'll see you after service.

668
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:19,200
Oh! good morning,reverend.

669
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:21,790
I brought your favorite-- blueberry scones.

670
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:23,510
Thank you,bree.

671
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,020
By the way,I'm sorry I've taken so long

672
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,360
To make a decision about the ladies' auxiliary.

673
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:30,420
Oh,is that happening now? I'd forgotten all about it.

674
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:32,360
So is your,uh,delightful neighbor coming?

675
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,630
The one with all the questions?

676
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,350
Delightful? I thought she annoyed you.

677
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:39,720
No,I found her refreshing.

678
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:41,410
It's like I always say.

679
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:43,560
Church is not a place for answers.

680
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,950
It's a place for questions.

681
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,480
You don't say that.

682
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:51,120
I've--i've never heard you say that,not once. yes,well,anyway,

683
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:53,320
I want to thank you for taking the initiative.

684
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,390
New members are crucial to the health of this church.

685
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:58,310
I won't forget you brought them... or these.

686
00:33:58,490 --> 00:33:59,310
Thank you,reverend,

687
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:03,420
And I'm--i'm sure the scavos will be here soon.

688
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:05,670
Why did you just say that?

689
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:07,180
You know very well they went to catholic church.

690
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:11,080
Which is just down the street. I'll be right back.

691
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,650
Psst!

692
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,850
Not you.

693
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:26,580
Lynette.

694
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,050
What are you doing here?

695
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,620
I was gonna ask the same of you.

696
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,810
Why are you in a catholic church?

697
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,120
Because we're catholic. oh,please.

698
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,070
Mowing your lawn in a notre dame sweatshirt

699
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:38,050
Doesn't make you catholic.

700
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:41,820
You're presbyterian now. come on. let's go.

701
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,760
Weren't you the one who said I should explore other churches?

702
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:48,410
I meant sample,like a buffet.

703
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,780
You take a little plate of everything,

704
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,600
And then you sit down for the main course,

705
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:52,750
Which is across the street...

706
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:54,310
At the presbyterian church.

707
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:57,020
No. I just put 10 bucks in the collection plate,

708
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:59,640
And I'm gonna get my money's worth. is there a problem?

709
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:05,090
No,no problem. just talking to my friend. she's trying to poach her.

710
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:07,530
I am not!

711
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,510
My friend's just a little confused.

712
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:10,950
She forgot that she's presbyterian

713
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:14,220
And wandered into the wrong church. I'm not presbyterian.

714
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,600
I'm a free agent.

715
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:20,120
And if you're open to a little q and a,you've got me.

716
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:22,110
Lynette,please.

717
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:25,720
Can't we just go outside and talk for a moment?

718
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,520
Okay,what gives?

719
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:32,110
Well,I was at the service this morning,

720
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:36,780
And it's just not the same without you. bree...

721
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:40,450
And I am... up for the head of the ladies' auxiliary,

722
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:42,000
And reverend sykes was so impressed

723
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:45,510
That I brought a new family into church,so...

724
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,060
If you don't come back,then--

725
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:51,130
Oh,then you won't get what you want? well,yes.

726
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,120
Well,forget it.

727
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:55,220
Let someone else help you with your power grab.

728
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,330
Lynette!

729
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,740
You were the one who came to me. you sought me out.

730
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,020
Yes,and do you know why?

731
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,710
Because out of all my friends,

732
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,180
You are the one who had real faith.

733
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,590
You had an actual relationship with god.

734
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,260
At least,that's what I thought.

735
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:10,720
Lynette--

736
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:15,120
Because I have had a rough few months.  okay?

737
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:16,890
But I know you've had rough times,too,

738
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:17,940
And I always assumed

739
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:21,430
That your faith had helped you get through them.

740
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,770
I envied you that,to be honest.

741
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:28,630
It did. it did help me.

742
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:30,270
Really?

743
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:34,430
Okay. how?

744
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:37,990
It just did.

745
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:39,550
Well,that's not a good answer.

746
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,370
I have been through cancer and a tornado,

747
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:45,990
And I don't know why I survived,and so many other people didn't.

748
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:50,430
I don't understand,and I need to.

749
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:52,300
Lynette,why didn't you tell me?

750
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:54,940
Why didn't you ask?

751
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,380
Oh,that's right.

752
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,640
You don't like asking questions.

753
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:12,790
Hey,lynette.

754
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:14,880
Hi there.

755
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,420
Just... wanted to tell you

756
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,720
That I'm out of the running for the ladies' auxiliary.

757
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:25,600
I told reverend sykes to,uh,give it to edna fletcher.

758
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,840
She was in the peace corps,you know.

759
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,070
Huh. that's nice of you.

760
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:34,050
I suppose. I just wanted to let you know that.

761
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:37,720
And also to... apologize.

762
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,610
Oh,you don't have to do that.

763
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:42,660
Yes,I do. you were right. faith shouldn't be blind.

764
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:45,280
You don't threaten it by asking questions.

765
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,250
You make it stronger,and I lost sight of that.

766
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:50,910
Well,maybe a little.

767
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:55,360
And it meant a lot that you came to me for guidance,and...

768
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:58,690
I'm sorry that I wasn't there for you.

769
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:03,740
I want you to have faith in me and our friendship.

770
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:07,260
Well...

771
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,090
There are some things that are easy to believe in.

772
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,250
How's catholicism going,by the way?

773
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:18,410
Meh.

774
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,300
Well,if you ever wanna try us again...

775
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:25,200
Oh,well,I'm pretty comfortable with the catholics.

776
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,280
They're the only ones who don't judge me

777
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:28,490
For having so many kids.

778
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,990
Hey.

779
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:35,640
Hey.

780
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:39,620
Okay,so I have to ask.

781
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,380
This thing that happened with you and katherine

782
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:43,170
12 years ago--

783
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:45,030
Was it an ongoing affair?

784
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:48,480
No. no,it was just the one time,

785
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,680
And I think she felt pretty guilty about it afterwards.

786
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:54,260
She told me not to come around anymore.

787
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:57,580
So you didn't go back?

788
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:01,410
It's weird. I tried to.

789
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:03,650
It was the last night of my visit.

790
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:05,300
I thought if I brought her some flowers,

791
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,220
Maybe I could get something going,you know?

792
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,240
But when I got up to the front door,

793
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:11,740
I heard all this yelling. ...say good night to my daughter.

794
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:14,490
She is asleep. get the hell out. I went around to the window

795
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:17,340
Just to get a look at what was going on... remember? she's my daughter!

796
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:21,190
I'm her father! and I could see she was having a fight with someone.

797
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,730
I was about to rush in and help her

798
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:26,170
When I saw katherine pick up this candlestick

799
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:28,790
And just wail on him.

800
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:31,070
He went down pretty hard.

801
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,430
Katherine was just standing over him

802
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:35,250
With this look in her eye.

803
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:40,550
It scared the hell out of me,so I got out of there.

804
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,470
I left the next morning

805
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:45,820
And never talked to katherine again.

806
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:51,500
So... this man-- who do you think it was?

807
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,920
Don't know.

808
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:56,140
I sort of got the impression he was her ex-husband.

809
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,800
Does she ever talk about him?

810
00:39:57,990 --> 00:39:59,450
Not really.

811
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:03,170
Mm. have you seen him lately?

812
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,580
No.

813
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,930
Ever since I can remember,I've had this feeling

814
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,800
That something's not right.

815
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:22,070
Weird dreams that don't seem like dreams at all.

816
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,150
People telling me I forgot things

817
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,180
That I know I would've remembered.

818
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,220
And now finally,

819
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:36,610
I find a sentence on a piece of paper...

820
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:39,390
That could explain all of it

821
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:43,020
And prove that I am not crazy.

822
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:47,280
And the best that you can come up with

823
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,440
Is that aunt lily was losing it

824
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:53,280
And she didn't know what she was writing?

825
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:59,470
I need the truth,adam.

826
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:01,590
Please.

827
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,140
Please.

828
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,220
The truth,dylan...

829
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,260
Is that...

830
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:16,330
Your mother didn't kill your father.

831
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:22,600
And she loves you more than you will ever know.

832
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,510
Faith is a belief in something

833
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:36,540
That cannot be proven.

834
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,200
So we trust in the words

835
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:43,450
Of the only father we've ever known.

836
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:50,320
We believe the promises of the woman who shares our bed.

837
00:41:50,800 --> 00:42:01,340

838
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:55,910
We rely on the example of dear friends

839
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:59,180
Who help us to be better people.

840
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:07,220
Yes,we all want to believe in those we are closest to,

841
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,190
But where there is doubt,

842
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:13,490
Our faith begins to vanish...

843
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:17,680
And fear rushes in to take its place.
