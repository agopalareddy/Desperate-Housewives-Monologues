<i>Gaby's new tenant...</i>

00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:07,190
i understand you got a room to rent. we like you.

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,760
if you have first and last months' rent,

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,860
<i>we'd like you even more. ... came with a dangerous secret.</i>

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,030
<i>i'm your father. wayne's return meant trouble for Katherine.</i>

7
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,840
she doesn't know you, but i do.

8
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,910
did you have anything to do with the fire at rick's restaurant?

9
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,350
<i>Lynette tried to warn tom about kayla...</i>

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,020
i think we have a seriously troubled young girl.

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,320
<i>and in his time of weakness,</i>

12
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:36,400
<i>Orson chose the wrong shoulder to cry on.</i>

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,410
i don't... think...

14
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,590
you're right.

00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:51,150
<i>the incident- as it would come to be known-</i>

16
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:54,480
<i>happened late on a tuesday afternoon.</i>

17
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,180
<i>witnesses included an old woman...</i>

18
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:02,630
<i>a blind man...</i>

19
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,400
<i>and a young boy.</i>

20
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,450
<i>the old woman,whose hearing was not what it used to be,</i>

21
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,630
<i>saw Bree hodge emerge from her house</i>

22
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,010
<i>in a way that told her</i>

23
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,050
<i>she was upset about something.</i>

24
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,120
<i>the blind man,whose hearing had become more acute,</i>

25
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:26,750
<i>heard Edie say... oh,hey,Bree. what's up?</i>

26
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:28,130
<i>...in a way that suggested</i>

27
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,250
<i>Edie wasn't expecting any trouble.</i>

28
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,350
<i>the young boy, who was not yet 11,</i>

29
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,140
<i>heard Bree hodge say...</i>

30
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,780
i saw you kissing my husband.

31
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:40,090
<i>but he couldn't understand</i>

32
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,160
<i>why someone would be angry about kisses,</i>

33
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:46,040
<i>which he thought grown-ups liked.</i>

34
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,040
<i>as the old woman pretended</i>

35
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,220
<i>to clip hedges she'd already clipped,</i>

36
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:54,340
<i>she saw the body language of her neighbors change.</i>

37
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,190
<i>as the blind man listened in,</i>

38
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,850
<i>he heard Bree say...</i>

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,220
what were you thinking,Edie? we're supposed to be friends.

40
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,780
<i>we are friends. i am not interested in Orson.</i>

41
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,370
<i>the young boy then heard Edie add...</i>

42
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:11,110
so stop acting like such a bitch!

43
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:15,640
<i>...which included a word he was not allowed to use.</i>

44
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:21,000
<i>the old woman then saw Bree hodge clench her fist.</i>

45
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,400
<i>a second later, the blind man heard a slap...</i>

46
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,790
<i>and the young boy saw Edie grab her cheek.</i>

47
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,970
<i>as the two women parted company,</i>

48
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,140
<i>a thought occurred</i>

49
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,720
<i>to all those who had witnessed the incident...</i>

50
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,670
<i>that right there on peaceful wisteria lane,</i>

51
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:45,120
<i>the battle lines had been drawn,</i>

52
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,940
<i>and someone...</i>

53
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,950

<i>children purchase tasteful bouquets...</i>

59
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:11,000

hey,mama. hey,baby.

00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,080
oh,my gosh!

67
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,570
is this my daughter-in-law?

68
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
well,i'm gonna hug her. oh! it's nice to meet you.

69
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:35,620
oh,my goodness! oh!

70
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,130
oh,okay.

71
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,760
oh,my son was right.

72
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:43,790
you are the prettiest thing!

73
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,830
michael, i'm just taken with her.

74
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,720
oh,well,good. thank you. come on,mama. let's get you unpacked.

75
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:53,460
oh,yes,let's do,'cause i brought you a present. oh! oh!

76
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,650
let's go. come on.

77
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,330
wow!

78
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,160
it's all recipes.

79
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,460
not just any recipes.

80
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,280
some of these have been in my family

81
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:12,700
since before the war of northern aggression.

82
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,210
you mean the civil war?

83
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,760
i mean what i mean.

84
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:20,950
um,well...

85
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:22,780
i guess Mike didn't tell you

86
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,590
that i'm,uh, really not a cook.

87
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,700
oh,no,he told me.

88
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,080
that's why i gave you these recipes,

89
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,410
and i'm gon' teach you how to make 'em,too.

90
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,980
isn't that nice,honey?

91
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,570
oh, my meemaw always told me

92
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:40,550
that a lady should be a chef in the kitchen,

93
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,410
a maid in the living room and a whore in the bedroom.

94
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,920
and michael says you've only got one of those covered,

95
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,910
so i'm gon' help you with the other two.

96
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,490
excuse me.

97
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,220
the one she won't be helping me with-

98
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:02,600
please tell me it's "whore."

99
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,480
i call the computer. no way! i called it on the bus.

100
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:11,280
whoa! whoa,whoa,whoa! guys, wait a minute. wait a minute.

101
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,170
there's somebody i want you to meet.

102
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,600
this is dr. dolan. hey,guys. i'm joshua.

103
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,500
he's gonna hang out and watch us,

104
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:20,250
you know,be a family.

105
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,100
why?

106
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,520
because we've had a couple of...

107
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,840
problems lately.

108
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,530
and my job is to find out what's causing those problems,

109
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:31,950
and then i can help you be a stronger family. can we be a stronger family

110
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,530
while playing "age of empires iii"?

111
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,690
yeah,sure. i wanna learn how to play that game.

112
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,460
go get started. i'll join you in a minute.

113
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,120
so i like what you said

114
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,130
about making the family stronger,

115
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:49,390
but as i told you,kayla's the one you wanna focus on.

116
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,870
well,i prefer to look at the big picture.

117
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,150
you see,if a family is dysfunctional,

118
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,740
it can lead to a child with problems.

119
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,970
<i>yeah, or a child with problems</i>

120
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,940
can lead to a dysfunctional family.

121
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,830
i mean,kayla's the one that got my kids to light a fire

122
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,070
and jump off the roof. honey,it-it sounds like

123
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:08,490
dr. dolan has,um, kind of a plan here.

124
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,870
i understand. it just seems like...

125
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,990
at $140 an hour,we could skip straight to the part

126
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,900
where you sit down with kayla

127
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:20,300
and tell her to stop being so evil.

128
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,220
mommy?

129
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,750
yeah? um... i forgot to give you something.

130
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:26,720
oh. it's a drawing i made for you in school.

131
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:30,470
oh,well,thank you. it's beautiful. thank you.

132
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:34,650
she never does this.

133
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,610
mmm. don't. we're waiting for ellie.

134
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:42,200
she's finishing up with a customer.

135
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,930
well,maybe when she's done tattooing him,

136
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,870
she can put "stop hitting the blind guy" on my forehead.

137
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:49,560
you know,i've been hitting you a lot less lately,

138
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,550
and i don't feel

139
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,510
like i'm getting enough credit for that.

140
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,370
<i>you're right. i'm a bad husband.</i>

141
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:56,960
no,seriously.

142
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,370
we're getting along better. have you noticed that?

143
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,500
yeah,i think it's because of ellie.

144
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:05,020
me,too. it's impossible to argue with her in the house.

145
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,130
she makes us laugh.

146
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,850
she takes you off my hands every once in a while. plus,she's always helping around the house.

147
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,040
i mean,yesterday, without even being asked,

148
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,130
she washed all the windows.

149
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,750
she's amazing. i don't know where she gets all her energy.

150
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,010
okay,so we're square.

151
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,420
dude,you gotta call me next week.

152
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,610
i got some great stuff coming in. all right.

153
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:29,020
ellie,it's getting cold! i'll be right down!

154
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:30,610
so should i sneak out the back?

155
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,470
oh,no. that's my landlady. she's cool.

156
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,070
she knows you're dealing?

157
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,570
<i>well,she's not that cool.</i>

158
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:41,020
oh,hey,guys!

159
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:44,840
you were up there a while. can i see it?

160
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:49,120
um,she- she means the tattoo.

161
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,200
i would love for you to see it...

162
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,640
but it's kind of down south.

163
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,300
oh,on his... got it.

164
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,780
does it hurt?

165
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,560
it's okay.

166
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:07,400
ellie gave me something for the pain.

167
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:13,760
and fairview has a top-rated school district,

168
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,320
which,uh...

169
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:18,300
you'll appreciate in a couple of years.

170
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:21,370
well,come on in. i'll show you the inside. you go ahead,honey.

171
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,730
i'll wait until mark wakes up from his nap. all right,we'll see you in a minute.

172
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,740
okay. all right...

173
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,730
hi! oh,hi!

174
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,410
i'm Bree hodge. lauren baxter. nice to meet you.

175
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:39,590
so are you thinking of moving onto the lane?

176
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,820
yes. this house is exactly what we've been looking for.

177
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,600
do you mind if i ask- is it a safe neighborhood?

178
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,970
oh,yes, the neighborhood's safe.

179
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,610
i wish i could say the same for your real estate agent.

180
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,090
well,what do you mean?

181
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:01,310
what is this? you left it in the printer.

182
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,300
it's a house listing.

183
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,430
yeah, for a house in baltimore.

184
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:08,790
yeah,wait till you see it. it's got a pool and a garden. this is about dad,isn't it?

185
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,720
i'm doing this to protect us.

186
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,310
<i>we don't need to be protected. he's changed.</i>

187
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,590
it's all an act, sweetheart.

188
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,650
you don't see it now, but you will.

189
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:23,480
he's only back because he wants something.

190
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,280
i don't know what exactly. i just know we're not safe here.

191
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,690
oh,sure. that's it. dad has some evil plan.

192
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:33,080
it couldn't be that he wants to be in my life,

193
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:36,520
that he loves me. he isn't capable of love,dylan.

194
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,310
i found that out the hard way,

195
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,380
and we need to leave

196
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,800
before you learn the same horrible lesson.

197
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,580
move if you want.

198
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,430
i'm staying here with my father.

199
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:01,370
but what happened? things were going fine.

200
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,760
i'm sorry. we need another realtor.

201
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,180
all right.

202
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:21,670
biscuits are the foundation of any southern meal.

203
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,050
like my meemaw used to say, "ain't nothin' you can make

204
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,500
don't taste better on a biscuit."

205
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,890
a fount of wisdom, your meemaw.

206
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,120
uh-huh.

207
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:31,490
well...

208
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,540
i really appreciate this. thanks,adele.

209
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,800
"adele"? if you don't call me "mama," i'm gon' scream.

210
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,820
don't do that... mama.

211
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,690
now let's get started.

212
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,660
we're gonna need a flour sifter.

213
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,660
i don't have one.

214
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:49,040
pastry cutter? sorry.

215
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:52,590
dough hooks? don't even know what they are.

216
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,110
that's fine. we can improvise.

217
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:59,560
why don't you start by measuring out our dry ingrEdients?

218
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,960
the flour and such?

219
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,110
oh.

220
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,430
michael is gonna be so happy.

221
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:08,730
after a long day of work,

222
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:13,350
he can come home to a nice, home-cooked southern meal.

223
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,640
although he also enjoys

224
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,510
coming home to sesame chicken from red panda,

225
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:19,690
and they deliver.

226
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,790
you know,it's a shame that michael has to work so hard.

227
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,990
but i guess with all the money troubles

228
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,550
you two have been havin'... he told you that?

229
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,710
well,we're getting past it.

230
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:36,210
only because my son is working himself to the bone.

231
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:39,810
you know,it wouldn't hurt for you to get a job. i have a job.

232
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:43,240
oh,you mean your little drawings?

233
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,080
well,it's great for a woman to have a hobby.

234
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,720
personally,i decoupage,

235
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,750
but i'm talking about something that pays.

236
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,210
children's books pay.

237
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,370
really? how much?

238
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:56,480
you know,i think,actually,

239
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,220
i might have those dough hooks somewhere.

240
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,500
oh,dear. i've insulted you.

241
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,880
now i'm just trying to be helpful.

242
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:07,530
no,no. it's fine,adele.

243
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,620
mama.

244
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:16,170
so we were sort of surprised to get your call.

245
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,440
don't you need to see kayla a few more times

246
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,200
before you report back to us? well,before continuing with her,

247
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:27,410
i thought it might be helpful to ask you a few questions. oh,go ahead. shoot.

248
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,040
do you love kayla?

249
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,440
Lynette? hmm?

250
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:35,760
i was talking to you.

251
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:39,550
oh. well... s-sure.

252
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,020
i've been very good to her.

253
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,550
that wasn't his question.

254
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,390
do you have a diploma on your wall,tom?

255
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,200
i don't think so. zip it.

256
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,470
again,um...

257
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,840
do you love her?

258
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,300
of course i do...

259
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:02,510
as much as i can,given the way she joined our family.

260
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,790
it's just-it's complicated.

261
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:08,020
i understand. the problem is,

262
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,560
kayla has picked up on your ambivalence,

263
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,950
and she's become a very angry girl.

264
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,620
so what do we do?

265
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:19,870
oh,god. is this gonna be one of those therapy things

266
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,280
where she hits me with a foam bat?

267
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,010
there's a bond that develops

268
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,230
between an infant and her mother.

269
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,910
you and kayla never formed that bond,

270
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:31,690
so what we need to do is recreate it.

271
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,220
it's called attachment parenting,

272
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:37,600
and it starts with kayla being by your side

273
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,830
as often as possible.

274
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:43,650
that sounds like exactly what they need.

275
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:46,070
i mean,i don't have a diploma or anything,but...

276
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,730
i'd really like to give this a try.

277
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,000
whatever keeps you and kayla close and interacting-

278
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,750
go to the movies, go shopping,

279
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:56,470
maybe take a little trip together,just the two of you.

280
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,810
could we revisit the foam bat idea for just a second?

281
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:02,780
the plan sounds great,doc. don't worry.

282
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:06,350
i will make sure that they are together constantly.

283
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:10,410
<i>as me if i love tom right now.</i>

284
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,900
go ahead. i dare ya.

285
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:20,040
may i help you?

286
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,250
i haven't seen benjamin in a week.

287
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:26,040
i was thinking i'd take him for a few hours. it's not really a good time.

288
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,150
well,Bree,whenever i call, it's not a good time,

289
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,430
so if you don't mind,

290
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,910
i'd like to take my son to the carnival. well,that sounds boring.

291
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:35,560
i know. why don't you take him to Edie's house,

292
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:39,930
and he can watch you give her a dental exam with your tongue?

293
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:43,250
Bree,you don't understand.

294
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:46,100
what you saw was bad judgment on Edie's part

295
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,600
and good judgment on my part. i pushed her away.

296
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,110
yes,eventually,with a big, dopey grin on your face.

297
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,650
can we please put this behind us?

298
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:57,360
i would like to take benjamin. i don't think so. i'd hate for him to be around

299
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,730
when you had another attack of delayed morality,

300
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,540
either with Edie or behind the wheel of your car.

301
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,130
i am not having this argument.

302
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:08,610
he is my son,too.

303
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:11,510
not exactly.

304
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,770
what? don't even-

305
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:17,150
strictly speaking, you're not even related to him.

306
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:19,700
i mean,it was fine for you to masquerade as his father

307
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:21,140
when we were together, but now that we're not-

308
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:25,300
this is wrong. i will hire a lawyer.

309
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:29,770
i've already hired one. you'll be hearing from him shortly.

310
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:34,560
oh,and if you're in the mood for a carnival,

311
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,050
why not call Edie?

312
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:40,810
i hear you get three throws for a dollar with her,too.

313
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,610
bye,Gaby.

314
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,840
you guys going for another walk?

315
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,400
yeah. we found this sweet hiking trail-

316
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,320
goes right through the middle of the woods. yeah,and unlike some people,

317
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:54,400
ellie doesn't let the branches hit me in my face.

318
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,860
you're spoiling him.

319
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,180
what the hell?

320
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,280
ellie,your door is locked!

321
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,220
ellie!

322
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,600
oh,shut up already.

323
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:54,810
mom,guess what?

324
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:56,840
dad's coming to my senior recital next week.

325
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:59,560
<i>i could swing by and pick you up,if you want.</i>

326
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,900
we could make it a real family outing.

327
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:06,370
dylan,your father and i need to talk... in private.

328
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,320
i'm not done saying good-bye.

329
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,870
yes,you are. please get rid of that gum.

330
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:15,540
i can hear you smacking all the way in the house.

331
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,160
bye,sweetheart. bye,dad.

332
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,270
just so we're clear,

333
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,910
there will be no family outings.

334
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,860
now,kathy, you shouldn't be rude

335
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,510
to a man who still has feelings for you.

336
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,670
meaning what? you still love me?

337
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:40,480
i do. and i know i'm somewhat to blame

338
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,760
for what's happened between us.

339
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,020
that's why i've forgiven you for kidnapping our daughter.

340
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:48,820
<i>the least you can do is meet me halfway.</i>

341
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:51,700
oh,wayne.

342
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,660
i don't deserve your forgiveness.

343
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,070
maybe not,but i'm gonna give it to you anyway 'cause...

344
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:01,550
i still think we could be happy together.

345
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:04,020
<i>could we?</i>

346
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,840
given all the things i did

347
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,770
that you don't know about?

348
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:10,800
what's that?

349
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,570
i'm talking about all those men i was with

350
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,900
while we were married.

351
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:19,420
how can you forgive something like that?

352
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,300
that's a lie.

353
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:22,810
you wouldn't have dared.

354
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:26,340
unhappy women do dangerous things.

355
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,370
i think the worst

356
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:30,410
was when i tricked you

357
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:33,720
into thinking dylan was yours.

358
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:38,580
i wanted to tell you the truth, but i was scared...

359
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:42,010
for obvious reasons.

360
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:44,310
i don't believe you.

361
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:48,510
but i'm not worried anymore

362
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,790
because you've changed.

363
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,550
so what are you waiting for, wayne?

364
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,960
forgive me.

365
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:02,060
hey there! mrs. mccluskey.

366
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,950
if she's not mine, then whose is she?

367
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:12,800
does it matter?

368
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:18,870
oh,i guess i won't be seeing you at the recital now.

369
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:22,380
hmm. what a shame.

370
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,870
are you sure it was cocaine?

371
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,880
Carlos,i was a fashion model in the '90s.

372
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,480
i know cocaine.

373
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,780
damn it.

374
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,100
what are you doing? i'm calling the police.

375
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,310
whoa,whoa,whoa,whoa!

376
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:57,080
shouldn't we hear ellie's side of the story first? here's ellie's side.

377
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,800
"selling drugs brings in more money than waiting tables."

378
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,920
there you go. were you moved?

379
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,850
okay,look, maybe i was wrong.

380
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:07,890
maybe it was flour. maybe she's a pastry chef.

381
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:10,720
yeah! and she came up with that tattoo cover story

382
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,520
to hide her illicit baking.

383
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,090
all right,look, i know we have to do something,

384
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,410
but this woman's our friend.

385
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:21,010
yes,and i'm a convicted felon still on probation.

386
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:23,060
now if the police find out we're harboring a drug dealer,

387
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:28,000
they're gonna fry me. we have to turn her in.

388
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,500
well,the priority for me

389
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,740
is working out custody of benjamin.

390
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:36,960
to that end,i've written down

391
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:39,920
all the pertinent facts about the situation.

392
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,970
no,i don't want to do this over the phone.

393
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,660
uh,listen. i'm gonna hop in the shower.

394
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:48,010
how about we meet in your office in about an hour? great. thanks.

395
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,270
Orson?

396
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,320
Orson?

397
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,430
the,uh,the door's open.

398
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,000
Edie? what are you doing here?

399
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,140
get out here,you wuss.

400
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:07,280
that puritanical robot bitch of yours

401
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,190
is sabotaging my business.

402
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:14,530
okay,hang on a second. i'll be right out.

403
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:35,670
you know,uh,Orson... forget it.

404
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,710
just-just take a nice,long shower.

405
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:40,970
really? you sure?

406
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:43,960
yeah. uh, now that i think about it,

407
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:47,470
i can handle Bree all by myself.

408
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:58,820
so that's when i saw all those bricks of cocaine under her bed.

409
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,650
i mean,i-i mean, i think it was cocaine,

410
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:03,020
and i think they're called bricks.

411
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:06,490
i'm just a simple housewife. i don't know what i'm saying.

412
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,660
well,you've done the right thing,and it's thanks

413
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,550
to the cooperation of citizens like you-

414
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:14,510
yeah,yeah,yeah. when are you gonna get her out of our house?

415
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:18,560
well,it's a little more complicated than that.

416
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:20,530
meaning?

417
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,860
bullock!

418
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,260
oh,my god!

419
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:31,180
<i>what? what? i can't see anything.</i>

420
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:32,950
it's one of ellie's customers.

421
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,110
actually, i'm detective bullock.

422
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,870
we've been tracking miss leonard for several months now.

423
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,000
okay,so if you know what she's doing,

424
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:43,050
then why don't you just bust her? she's small-time.

425
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,220
we're trying to get to her supplier,

426
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:46,680
so we need her to keep dealing.

427
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:50,850
wait. so you're just gonna leave a drug dealer in our house?

428
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:52,990
yes. for now we just need you

429
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:55,740
to act normal,pretend like you don't know anything.

430
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:59,430
we'll move in when the case is made. okay,look,

431
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,950
i'm all for doing my civic duty,

432
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:06,260
but this woman- she's... sort of a... friend.

433
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:07,700
and now you're asking us to trick her?

434
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:11,120
i'm not sure we're comfortable with this.

435
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:15,080
mr. Solis, you're on probation,right?

436
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,810
<i>how'd you like not to be?</i>

437
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,950
<i>what on earth could you possibly want?</i>

438
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,730
oh,i wanted to thank you.

439
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,190
after you scared off that couple

440
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,250
that were going to buy the young house,

441
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,280
i,uh,found another buyer,

442
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,120
and they're willing to go 10% over asking.

443
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:43,290
well,good,when they drop by for their inspection,

444
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:46,310
i'll just have to have a nice little chat with them,too.

445
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,590
you wouldn't wanna do that to me.

446
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:52,110
and after all, we're family.

447
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,350
family?

448
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,560
well,yes, since my nephew austin

449
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,240
is benjamin's biological father,

450
00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:01,630
that makes me benjy's great-aunt-

451
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,010
a term i don't exactly love,

452
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:05,680
but it's better than "grandma,"

453
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:08,700
<i>which is what you are.</i>

454
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:10,290
how did you...

455
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,360
cute story.

456
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:15,460
i- i went over to Orson's to ask him to get you off my back,

457
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:16,660
and the poor sap-

458
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:18,940
he-he'd written the whole sordid tale down

459
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,460
and left it right there on the table.

460
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:23,770
Edie,if word got out,

461
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:26,980
my whole family would be... humiliated.

462
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,440
oh,i don't want word to get out.

463
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:32,240
that would ruin everything, because right now i...

464
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,940
well,i own you.

465
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,340
what does that mean?

466
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,300
glad you asked.

467
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,530
from this moment on, i am your best friend.

468
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,670
you're gonna invite me to all of your fancy parties,

469
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,560
set me up with all your single friends,

470
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:50,120
and,well,if i'm ever in the mood for muffins,

471
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:51,850
you're gonna bake 'em for me.

472
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,070
Edie... please.

473
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,930
and if you don't,

474
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:59,780
if for one second i don't feel the love,

475
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,350
i'm gonna bury you.

476
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:04,580
you understand?

477
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,400
yeah.

478
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,190
good.

479
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:12,340
oh,by the way,um,i'm having an open house tomorrow.

480
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:16,010
a plate of banana nut muffins sure would set the mood.

481
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:18,670
don't you think?

482
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,150
oh! oh!

483
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,110
hey,honey, could you get that? thank you.

484
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,110
hey,Bree,perfect timing.

485
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:37,650
<i>we were just getting ready to deal the cards. Bree,are you okay?</i>

486
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:45,730
there's something i've been... keeping from all of you,

487
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:47,490
and,um...

488
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,820
we need to talk.

489
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,850
hey,wayne.

490
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:59,590
i finished that d.n.a. you wanted.

491
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:00,580
i'm probably gonna get in trouble

492
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,990
because i put it in front of martin's triple homicide.

493
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:04,650
you bad girl.

494
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,500
well,i owe you. i just needed to confirm

495
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:11,510
that the vic and my suspect are related. oh,well,actually,they're not.

496
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,190
i ran the samples from the cheek swab

497
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,190
and the wad of gum you gave me,

498
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:17,600
and your suspect's not related to the victim at all.

499
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:22,830
are you sure? mm-hmm. oh, yeah,it's 100% exclusion.

500
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:25,440
are you hungry? 'cause i worked all through lunch,

501
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,610
and i thought that you and i could go get-

502
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:31,920
wayne?

503
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:36,980
oh,my god.

504
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:40,020
and Edie threatened to use that to...

505
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:41,280
yes.

506
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,750
okay,first of all, you're,like,

507
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:46,060
the greatest mom ever to wanna protect danielle like that.

508
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,870
thank you.

509
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,560
i can't believe she was blackmailing you.

510
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,680
i can't believe she made a play for Orson.

511
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,750
<i>i can. she went after Carlos and Mike and karl.</i>

512
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:58,880
the only person she hasn't gone after is tom.

513
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,510
<i>yet.</i>

514
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:03,180
this woman is outta control.

515
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,620
what are you gonna do?

516
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,450
<i>no. what are we gonna do?</i>

517
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:40,410
hey,guys,what's going on?

518
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:42,560
i told them everything, Edie,

519
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:44,450
about Orson,benjamin,

520
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,360
everything. you did?

521
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,720
she did, so you can kiss

522
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:50,540
that little blackmail scheme good-bye.

523
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,900
well,i was only doing it because-

524
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:55,130
you were only doing it because you're the devil.

525
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:58,570
okay,fine,chew me out and let's get on with it.

526
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:00,630
it's not like all the other times,Edie.

527
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:02,310
we're done.

528
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,290
done?

529
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,390
we're not inviting you to poker. we're not talking to you.

530
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,120
we're not even gonna wave when you jog by.

531
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:13,320
from now on,you are invisible. and we're gonna make sure every woman in a 5-mile radius

532
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:15,020
knows the kind of crap you pulled.

533
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:17,440
we tried to be your friends, but you don't even understand

534
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:19,930
what that word means, so now we're gonna be something

535
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,450
you do understand.

536
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:28,520
guys,wait. wait. i know i crossed a line this time,

537
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:30,970
and,well,i'm-i'm sorry.

538
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:32,270
did you hear something?

539
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,250
mnh-mnh.

540
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,810
neither did i.

541
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:44,760
<i>over here, honey,look at the camera.</i>

542
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:48,810
<i>look at the camera. you ready to ride,dylan?</i>

543
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:51,390
<i>now look,if you're scared, you don't have to. i want to.</i>

544
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,180
<i>no,you're a brave girl.</i>

545
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,630
<i>hold up your arm for the camera,sweetheart.</i>

546
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:58,060
<i>how many stitches is that? 11.</i>

547
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:00,400
<i>and you didn't cry once, did you?</i>

548
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,790
<i>can i ride now,please, daddy?</i>

549
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,680
<i>of course,baby.</i>

550
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,680
<i>i love you,daddy.</i>

551
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,860
dylan,it's me.

552
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:20,030
uh,you need to come over here tomorrow.

553
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:23,860
yeah,i know it's mother's day, but it's okay.

554
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:27,510
i got some things to tell you about your mother.

555
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:34,150
ooh,i want this one.

556
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:37,900
oh. yow! it's a little pricey.

557
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:41,490
but i want it. you're the one who asked me to go shopping.

558
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:43,730
well,i know,but we're supposed to be spending time together,

559
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,170
not going into debt.

560
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:50,010
oh.

561
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:51,980
how about this one?

562
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,990
what do you mean, "supposed to"?

563
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,490
i just...

564
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:59,540
it's good for us to hang out. i enjoy it.

565
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:01,540
is this something that the doctor made you do?

566
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,460
no. all my idea.

567
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:07,760
i just wanted to treat you to a real fun day.

568
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:10,210
all right. you want me to have fun?

569
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:10,890
mm-hmm.

570
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:13,560
buy me this.

571
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:18,390
okay.

572
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,500
good times.

573
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:24,730
i'd like an old-fashioned, please.

574
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:28,390
what's the matter,michael? you tuckered out?

575
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,210
oh,yeah,i just didn't get much sleep.

576
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:32,300
<i>honestly,i wonder how you ever get any,</i>

577
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:34,410
well,considering you got Susan in the bed

578
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,960
sawing wood all night.

579
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,380
i'm doing what now?

580
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:42,420
snoring.

581
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,330
what'd you say it sounded like,michael?

582
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,070
a bunch of bulldogs in a bag?

583
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:50,290
but it is a sound that i've come to love.

584
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:53,210
you know what my meemaw did to grandpa boo?

585
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:56,020
she sewed a marble in the back of his pajama top,

586
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:58,130
then if he rolled on his back to start snorin',

587
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:02,000
it'd wake him right up. but i guess you can't do that,

588
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,280
seeing as how you sleep in the nude and all.

589
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,750
well, that's gonna change real soon.

590
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:14,670
i'm gon' fix my face before i order. excuse me.

591
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,880
oh,this is nice.

592
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:20,190
nice? she's driving me crazy.

593
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,680
you have got to stop complaining about me to her.

594
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,880
i don't... complain.

595
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:28,820
well,you could see how i, as the nude,snoring whore,

596
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,380
would think so.

597
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:32,120
okay, now i might vent a little bit,

598
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,540
but she's just trying to help. well, the next time she tries to help,

599
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,620
she's gonna get an old-fashioned in her face,

600
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:41,910
so you better step up and start defending me. okay,okay.

601
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:44,680
well,lovely powder room.

602
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,840
it's amazing that such a busy restaurant

603
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:50,820
can keep their bathroom cleaner than yours.

604
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:55,780
now,mama,that's- that's not very nice.

605
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:56,880
well,you're the one who told me

606
00:31:57,050 --> 00:32:00,180
you didn't marry her for her housekeepin'.

607
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,000
you just need someone to teach these things.

608
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,320
you know what?

609
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:07,110
why don't i stay a few extra weeks,

610
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:09,760
and you and i can spruce the house up?

611
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:11,910
and don't worry. i'll leave when the baby comes.

612
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:15,810
at my age,all that crying just cuts my nerves to shreds.

613
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:18,630
now the first thing we're gonna do...

614
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:21,380
<i>is wash your walls.</i>

615
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:23,760
just 'cause we don't walk on 'em

616
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,710
doesn't mean they don't get dirty.

617
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:30,030
now how do you remember that?

618
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,550
...science project. now when you used to read...

619
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,620
oh,my god! my water broke. what?

620
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,920
my water just broke. i'm in labor.

621
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,160
we have to go. you're not due for a month.

622
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,240
i don't know what to tell you, mama. look at me.

623
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,260
aah! come on. we have to get you to the hospital.

624
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:58,760
well,yes,let's go.

625
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:02,230
no,no,no,you should take a cab home and start packing.

626
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:04,270
this one feels like a crier.

627
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:05,600
well, are you sure i should-

628
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,730
aah! aah! come on.

629
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:12,140
aah! aah! aah!

630
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:15,050
ah. ah.

631
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,330
you're doing great,honey. just keep breathing.

632
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:18,990
how close are the contractions?

633
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:22,690
a few weeks apart. wanna go to the movies?

634
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,410
what?

635
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:25,530
i'm not in labor,okay?

636
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,390
but your water broke. i saw it.

637
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:28,380
that was club soda.

638
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:32,180
amniotic fluid doesn't have ice cubes and a lemon wedge. what,you faked that?

639
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,700
i'm sorry. i panicked.

640
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:36,530
your mother just invited herself to stay with us for three weeks,

641
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:39,200
and you said nothing. i had to come up with a plan.

642
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:41,150
well,what happens if we go home with no baby?

643
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,490
i didn't say it was a good plan.

644
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,890
do you see the effect she has on me?

645
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:47,340
i just thank god i wasn't drinking coffee.

646
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:53,270
i could've hurt myself. okay, i get it. i'll talk to her.

647
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,040
thank you.

648
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:59,140
do you wanna go back in there right now and tell her?

649
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,460
no. no. the restaurant just comped our drinks.

650
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,780
we'll tell her at home.

651
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:09,500
well,we've done enough damage for one day.

652
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,370
let's go home.

653
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:12,010
i want a corn dog first.

654
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,710
oh,honey,we're about to have dinner.

655
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,580
but i'm hungry now. i want a corn dog.

656
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,390
all right. thank you. if you're hungry,

657
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:23,200
i'll get you something healthy, and you can have it in the car.

658
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:27,060
corn. dog. why can't i have one?

659
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,160
well,at this point,

660
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,360
because of the way you're acting.

661
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,660
please don't do this, kayla.

662
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,710
we have been having such a nice time.

663
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:37,010
and we can keep having a nice time.

664
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:39,070
just give me what i want,

665
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,970
or you're not gonna like what happens.

666
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,910
are you... threatening me?

667
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:46,260
i'm just saying,

668
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:48,990
i got that idiot preston to jump off the roof.

669
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:53,080
wonder what i could get penny to do.

670
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,310
i'm sorry.

671
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:00,720
i'm sorry. i shouldn't have done that,but that was...

672
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,470
that was horrible,what you said.

673
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:06,260
and-and...

674
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:09,180
you should never say that again.

675
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,740
okay,so...

676
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:15,250
come on. let's go. come on.

677
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,610
oh,Susan,you're up.

678
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:22,680
michael told me about your false labor.

679
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:25,990
that was unusual. well,it happens.

680
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:28,450
i know,but usually your water doesn't break.

681
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,390
oh,that. um...

682
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:33,280
turns out i spilled some club soda.

683
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:35,860
well,no surprise there.

684
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:40,060
michael told me what a klutzy kathy you are.

685
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:43,210
i'm glad he finds that cute.

686
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:46,300
i myself don't have the patience.

687
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,700
hey,mama.

688
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,350
hello,michael.

689
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:57,130
do you have a mother's day present for me?

690
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,210
he sure does, but i want mine first.

691
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,400
mama,we need to talk.

692
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:07,360
about what? about the way you talk to people.

693
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:12,910
i mean,um,sometimes you can be a little too... honest.

694
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:19,630
sorry. go on.

695
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:22,600
it's just... you don't realize how things sound

696
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:23,700
when they're coming out of your mouth.

697
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:26,970

00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:31,170

699
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:34,440
it's just that,mama,sometimes when you're talking to Susan-

700
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,220
Susan,you look a little pale. are you okay?

701
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,890
oh,she's fine. and i wish she'd cut it out.

702
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:42,030
no,i'm not trying to-ow!

703
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,760
Susan?

704
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,460
are-are you going into labor? for real?

705
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,050
maybe. who cares? let her have it.

706
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,200
okay,okay.

707
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:52,260
mama,you've gotta stop taking potshots at Susan.

708
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,800
she's my wife, and i love her,

709
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,590
and i can't have you upsetting her.

710
00:36:55,750 --> 00:37:00,630
sweetheart,i-i am deeply sorry and mortified.

711
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:03,100
if-if i've caused you any distress,

712
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,390
i never meant to hurt your feelings.

713
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:08,260
apology accepted. let's go.

714
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,140

717
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,770

718
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:24,010

719
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:26,420

720
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,220

721
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,610

722
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:33,200

723
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:36,120
no kayla?

724
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,240
well, she's still pretty upset.

725
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:40,490
again, i know i crossed the line,

726
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:42,110
and i am so sorry.

727
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:43,290
you know what? let's not get into this.

728
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:45,270
i'm just gonna get angry all over again.

729
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:49,260
tom,if you had been there and heard what she said...

730
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:53,670
it doesn't matter. you hit her.

731
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:56,000
honey, she's just a little girl.

732
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,760
and now thanks to you, she's a frightened little girl.

733
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,460
sorry to bother you, dr. dolan,

734
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,820
but you said i could call anytime.

735
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,110
my mom...

736
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:11,020
she hit me.

737
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:13,820
no,it's not the first time.

738
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:14,960
i was afraid to tell you

739
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:17,610
'cause i knew what she would do if she found out.

740
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:19,230
please help me.

741
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,050
i don't feel safe here.

742
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:25,960
i have to go. she's coming.

743
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:42,690
uh,sorry about the mess. the maid took the week off.

744
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:45,950
you said you wanted to talk to me and...

745
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,250
tell me things about mom?

746
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:51,500
you know what,kiddo? i-i had kind of a bad day yesterday.

747
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:55,210
i sat around here drinking, feeling sorry for myself.

748
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,060
and... and then i called you.

749
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,110
that's okay.

750
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,120
if you're feeling sad or whatever,

751
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,390
you should always call me.

752
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,860
<i>none of this is your fault. i hope you know that.</i>

753
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,650
none of what?

754
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:12,640
i tried so hard to let the past just be the past.

755
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,990
i didn't- i didn't wanna bring up

756
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:16,570
who did what to who or why.

757
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:17,830
what did mom say to you?

758
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,790
and it turns out i've been kidding myself all this time.

759
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:22,510
this family that i've been fighting for-

760
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:25,680
it just- it doesn't even...

761
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:28,680
exist.

762
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,270
we don't need her.

763
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:32,250
i'm fine with just you and me.

764
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:34,940
i'm happy now.

765
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:40,550
ow! dad,you're hurting me.

766
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:44,750
dad,what's the matter?

767
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,270
you have to go.

768
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,660
what's wrong? did i do something?

769
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:56,930
<i>get outta here! now!</i>

770
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:15,300
ellie? brunch is almost ready!

771
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:17,150
this is gonna be so hard.

772
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,800
you can't think of her as your friend.

773
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,930
think of her as a drug dealer

774
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:23,890
who could've gotten us into a lot of trouble. i'll try.

775
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:29,380
oh! shoot.

776
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,340
i wanted to surprise you. what's this?

777
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:35,020
well,you know, it's mother's day,and...

778
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:38,580
i have kind of a crappy relationship with my mom,

779
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:40,230
so...

780
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:42,370
this is my way of saying thanks for being nicer to me

781
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:45,130
than she ever was.

782
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,720
oh.

783
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,890
oh,honey!

784
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:55,490
i'm glad i didn't get you the chocolates.

785
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:01,480
no,travers,no,i decided spending mother's day with you

786
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,690
is more important

787
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:07,130
than spending time showing people stupid houses.

788
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:10,550
oh,love you,too,sweetheart.

789
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:12,800
actually,i think mommy's gonna be spending

790
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,260
a lot more time with you from now on.

791
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:18,150
but we'll talk about that when i get there,okay?

792
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,730
i love you,baby. i'll see you soon.

793
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:33,230
<i>it happens the second sunday of every may.</i>

794
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:36,030
<i>we celebrate the women</i>

795
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,830
<i>who give us life...</i>

796
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,530
<i>and so much more.</i>

797
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,500
<i>the ones who protect us at all costs...</i>

798
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:54,090
<i>who have the courage to fight those who would do us harm...</i>

799
00:41:56,070 --> 00:42:00,430
<i>who put our happiness ahead of their own.</i>

800
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:03,590
<i>but mostly...</i>

801
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:06,490
<i>we celebrate a mother's love,</i>

802
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:10,840
<i>which is constant,eternal...</i>

803
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,760
<i>and there from the very beginning.</i>
