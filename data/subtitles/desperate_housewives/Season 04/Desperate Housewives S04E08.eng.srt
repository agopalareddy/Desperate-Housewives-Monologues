1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,230
Previously in Desperate Housewives.

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,340
Mike was the victim...

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:06,930
Of a hit and run.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,260
Lynette couldn't forgive her mother's past.

5
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,380
You had tom to come home to.

6
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,540
I had your stepfather.

7
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:17,960
Hey, glen may have bored you, but the years we had 
a father in that house were the happiest of my life.

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,220
You drove him away.

9
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,000
Mom, where's grandma going?

10
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,430
Bree got her second chance to be a good mother.

11
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,960
Mike's dependency grew...

12
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,240
Addicts are experts at deception.

13
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,210
Victor!

14
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:33,710
Get up.

15
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,330
I wanna see the look on your face 
when the knife goes in.

16
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,380
And victor was lost at sea.

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,520
We think of the past as water under the bridge, 

18
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:51,460
a current  that carries away 
the mistakes of our youth--

19
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,900
 the loves we lost...

20
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,710
The addictions we gave into...

21
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:02,000
The opportunities we threw away...

22
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:09,910
But sooner or later, 
reminders drift back into our lives...

23
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,630
Of the mistakes we made...

24
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:15,900
And the sins we committed.

25
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,900
Carlos, why are you calling me?

26
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,300
I told you we can't be seen together.

27
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:22,560
I can't take it anymore.

28
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,600
We gotta go to the cops.

29
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,360
Oh, okay.
And say what?

30
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,620
"yes, officer, "my lover and i knocked 
my husband overboard twice and left him for dead.

31
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,830
Okay.Bye-bye.

32
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:31,810
" i don't think so.

33
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,260
But he's the mayor.

34
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,460
You know, people are gonna notice he's missing, 
and then they're gonna ask questions.

35
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:37,720
Let them ask.

36
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,530
No one knows we were on that boat.

37
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,270
Let's just play dumb and ride this thing out.

38
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,200
Gaby, don't you feel guilty?
A man is dead.

39
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,860
Yes, i feel awful, but he threatened our lives.

40
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:47,990
It was self-defense.

41
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:48,760
Exactly.

42
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,100
So then why don't we go and tell the police?

43
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,180
He took the lord's name in vain.

44
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:03,300
Look, we have a good plan.

45
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,570
Let's just stick to it.

46
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:05,750
Okay, okay.

47
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,060
I won't say anything.

48
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:07,720
Good.

49
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,100
Now until this blows over, don't call me again.

50
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,620
What are you doing now?

51
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,750
I'm praying for a miracle.

52
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,710
Carlos, if victor had lived, 
he would've killed us.

53
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,860
I'm thinking we already had our miracle.

54
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:39,110
Yes, the mistakes of our past have 
a way of drifting back into our lives...

55
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,590
And when they do...

56
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:45,180
We have to pay for them.

60
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,340
One day in the early fall,

61
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:05,690
Mike Delfino hurted his shoulder...

62
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:08,290
God.

63
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:13,660
To ease his pain, he took a little 
white pill recommended by his doctor.

64
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:17,700
The pain persisted, so he took another...

65
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:19,960
And another.

66
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:27,970
Unfortunately, when mike's pain began to subside, 
his need for the little white pills...

67
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,180
Did not.

68
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,630
But mike never shared this 
with those who cared about him, 

69
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:40,250
only with those who could not have cared less.

70
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,660
Hey, it's mike.
I'm out.

71
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,710
I need to meet you tomorrow.

72
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:46,250
Great.

73
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,490
Got that money you owe me?

74
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,890
No, but you know i'm good for it.

75
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,680
You price chistry textbooks lately?

76
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,070
They're, like, 300 bucks.

77
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,760
I need my money, mike.

78
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,760
And you'll get it, all right?

79
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,040
Can't you just front me something for now?

80
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,350
Well, advice is free.

81
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,430
Pills aren't.

82
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:04,820
My advice--get some cash.

83
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,180
So, hey, you know, i better get going.

84
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,160
Yeah, um, i should, too.

85
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,170
Mom.

86
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,440
Can we talk?

87
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,900
This will just take a second.

88
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,890
Did you kiss thaboy?

89
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,490
No, i was kind of interrupted.

90
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,780
Oh, well, you're gonna thank me.

91
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,870
Do you know that he has his tongue pierced?

92
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,080
Yeah.
He showed me.

93
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,730
How do you know?

94
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:48,740
I checked out his web page.

95
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,440
You did not.

96
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,640
I did, too, and do you know what else he has pierced?

97
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,710
And if you do, you're grounded.

98
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,290
Okay, yes, mom, derek has bought 
into the who piercing craze, 

99
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:58,000
but aren't you the one 
who told me to not judge a book by its cover?

100
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,990
If the cover has holes in it, 
the book is no good.

101
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,810
Okay, this conversation is over.

102
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:03,890
I am going to kiss derek good night.

103
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:04,660
Oh, fine.

104
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,640
Break my heart.

105
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,590
Why are you freaking out?

106
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:08,360
We're just dating.

107
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,490
It's not like he's trying 
to put a ring on my finger.

108
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:11,160
Trust me.

109
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,950
Your finger is not where he'd put it.

110
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:29,630
Aw, he's so beautiful when he sleeps.

111
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,770
I'll put him in the crib.

112
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,870
No, he'll be sleeping with us.

113
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,730
Why?
Is he running a fever?

114
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,190
He's fine, but i've been doing so reading, 

115
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:40,540
and more and more people say that 
babies sleep better next to their parents.

116
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,290
It's called the "family bed.

117
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:43,820
" no, i've heard of that.

118
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,590
Isn't it designed to facilitate breast-feeding?

119
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:47,540
Partly.

120
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:48,860
What's your point?

121
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,120
You're not lactating.

122
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,390
If our son wants to be near the milk, 
he'll have to sleep in the refrigerator.

123
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,350
This isn't just for me and benjamin.

124
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,960
This will help you bond with him, too.

125
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:01,960
Oh, perhaps, but it's sure not 
gonna help me bond with you.

126
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,180
Darling, sex is the last thing women 
want right after they've given birth.

127
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,200
But you didn't give birth.

128
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,210
You watched and served refreshments.

129
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:13,200
Well, that doesn't make caring 
for an infant any less tiring.

130
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,830
Can't we just give it a chance?

131
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:19,880
I suppose.

132
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,080
What if i roll over and crush him?

133
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:30,770
Don't.

134
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:38,780
Yes, hi.

135
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,250
I'm looking for my mom.

136
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,080
She hangs out at your bar sometimes.

137
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,570
Stella wingfield?

138
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:47,480
Uh, older lady, big smoker, talks like a teamster.

139
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,740
Well, that's your fault for letting her run a tab.

140
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,760
Look, if you see her, 
could you tell her to call lynette?

141
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,920
Thank you.

142
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:00,350
I know that you are worried, 
but i am sure your mother is fine.

143
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,420
She's broke and old and rude.

144
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,820
That is not a winning combination on the street.

145
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,800
Stella is very resourceful.

146
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,220
Didn't you tell me that she once made her own booze 
by putting a bag of oranges under the radiator?

147
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,110
Lucy, lydia and i fought over who had to take her.

148
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,240
She was right outside.

149
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,970
God only knows what she heard us say.

150
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:20,380
Yeah, well, after the crap she push you guys through, 
you have every right to resent her.

151
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:24,810
It is a lot easier to resent your parents 
when you know they're safe in some retirement village,

152
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:29,000
 but to know that she's out there, 
maybe lying facedown in an alley...

153
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,120
This is exactly what she wants you to do.

154
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,460
She wants you to feel guilty.

155
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,430
Don't buy into it.

156
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,310
Okay.

157
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:36,850
Okay.

158
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,610
I guess you're right.

159
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,290
Lynette.

160
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,880
The morgue is listed under government offices, right?

161
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,620
Mrs.Lang?

162
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:56,320
The police are here.

163
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,400
Ma'am.

164
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:21,790
I'm detective berry.

165
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,070
This is detective lyons.

166
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,490
Can we ask you a few questions?

167
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:25,190
Of course.

168
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,960
When was the last time you saw mr.Lang?

169
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,060
I guess two days ago.

170
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:30,880
Why?What's wrong?

171
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,680
His office has reported him missing.

172
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:34,660
Oh, no.
They did?

173
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:37,860
And this morning, the coast guard 
found his empty boat floating in the y.

174
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,890
Oh, my god.

175
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,690
I hope this isn't...

176
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,940
Last time i saw him, 
i to him i was leaving him.

177
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,950
How did he react to that news?

178
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,200
Well, he took it pretty hard.

179
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,750
Oh, you don't think he did anything stupid, do you?

180
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,420
Well, actually, we don't.

181
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:01,970
You don't?

182
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:06,570
When we examined the boat, 
we didn't find a single fingerprint, not even mr.Lang's.

183
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,660
Well, that's weird.

184
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,230
What--what do you think that means?

185
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:15,370
It would indate somebody wiped 
that boat down after mr.Lang was...

186
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,940
Gone.

187
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,430
Whoever was on that boat is clearly not that bright.

188
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,140
Okay, this is no time for name-calling.

189
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,060
A man is missing.

190
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,300
Well, don't worry, ma'am.

191
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,910
We got our best men on this case, 'round the clock.

192
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,250
We'll find out exactly what happened to your husband.

193
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,140
Great.

194
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:43,970
mom Went to mall with derek. Back late.

195
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,060
I'm barrett.

196
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:55,850
Is mike home?

197
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:56,940
No, he's at work.

198
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:57,900
Oh, shoot.

199
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,160
I needed to talk to him.

200
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,380
Wee, uh, just doing some business together.

201
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,160
Well, i don't know when he's gonna be home, 
but you could come back later tonight.

202
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,240
Oh, i can't do that.

203
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,120
I have to study for an orgo test.

204
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,850
Orgo?

205
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,460
Organic chemistry.

206
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,440
I'm pre-med.

207
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:12,700
Pre-med?

208
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:14,710
Really?

209
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,460
Oh, hello, dear.

210
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,540
Andrew, get orson's plate from the oven.

211
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,280
Ask me how my morning was.

212
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,710
All right.
How was it?

213
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:37,300
After two nights of sleepless bonding with my son,

214
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,330
 i nearly dozed off while repairing 
mrs. Colby's cracked molar.

215
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,110
I doubt if the crown i put in will last her a year.

216
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,320
So you'll replace it for free.

217
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,780
That's not the point.

218
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,790
How is a dentist supposed to feel 
when he can't give a 90-year-old a lifetime guarantee?

219
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:57,500
Bree, i'm sorry, but this whole family bed thing has to stop.

220
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,740
Oh, give it some time.

221
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,010
We're still adjusting, and benjamin is sleeping so soundly.

222
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:05,070
Well, he can sleep just as soundly in a crib.

223
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:09,320
From what you've told me, 
you and rex didn't haul andrew into bed with you.

224
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,030
No, and i wish we had.

225
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,320
If we did, he mightn't have turned out so...

226
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,580
So what?

227
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,790
Stupid?

228
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:16,680
Lazy?

229
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:17,840
Short?

230
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:24,750
I was going to say angry, and perhaps 
that anger began when we exiled you to the nursery.

231
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,590
I'm just trying to learn from my mistakes.

232
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:31,100
So i'm--i'm what, like the first pancake?

233
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,410
Don't be so sensitive.

234
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:36,090
We'll find something to help you sleep--
maybe some warm milk.

235
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:38,220
I know something that used to help me sleep.

236
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,570
Of course, that's off the menu these days.

237
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:42,670
Could the mistake have the salt?

238
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:46,410
D if you're as tired as you say you are, 
then you're bound to sleep better tonight.

239
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:49,040
Yes, i will, because i'll be sleeping in the den.

240
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,040
You're leaving our bed?

241
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,810
Darling, i need to either sleep or get lucky tonight.

242
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:56,740
I'll have a better shot at both if i'm alone.

243
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:05,370
Gosh, you're studying to be a doctor.

244
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,120
That must not leave you a lot of free time for hobbies or...

245
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:10,810
A girlfriend.

246
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,060
Well, i have the time.

247
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,510
I just don't have the girlfriend.

248
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,290
Well, no rush.

249
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:21,390
You know, just yesterday, i was telling my daughter julie-- 
oh, you know, that is so rude.

250
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:25,100
I-i'm talking about daughter, 
and you don't even know what she looks like.

251
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,300
That's her.

252
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,890
She's cute.

253
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:32,570
Oh, barrett, i wasn't fishing for compliments.

254
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:33,500
If i was...

255
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,740
I would've shown you this one.

256
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,850
Oh, excuse me.

257
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,540
I'm sorry.
I gotta take this.

258
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,190
Oh, sure.

259
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:44,590
I have to check on the laundry.

260
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,130
Yeah?

261
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,220
No, bonehead, i don't sell that stuff.

262
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,660
Just pills, smokes and 'shroomage.

263
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,160
That's it.

264
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,210
20 bucks, cash only.

265
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:03,280
Meet y at the dorm.

266
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,650
Look what i found on the dryer.

267
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:10,350
Julie won second place in the state science fair.

268
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,710
That's awesome.

269
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,950
Yeah, good-looking and smart.

270
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:17,600
Only problem is, where is she gna 
find someone else like that?

271
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:20,540
Well, i gotta get going.

272
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,910
My study partner's giving me 
a harde about that test, so...

273
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:23,650
Oh, that's okay.

274
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:27,910
You know, why don't you come back tomorrow to see me, 
and if julie happens to be here, 

275
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:31,770
maybe you can give her some advice on 
picking out colleges and stuff.

276
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,140
Yeah, sounds great.

277
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:34,800
See you tomorrow, mrs.Delfino.

278
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,060
Oh, please, call me "mom.

279
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:38,780
" uh, because...

280
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,580
That's what all the kids call me.

281
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:50,950
Oh, thank you.

282
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,700
Hey, bree.

283
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,600
Table for, uh, one and a half?

284
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,260
No, thanks.

285
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,830
I'm just dropping off andrew's cell phone.

286
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,250
He forgot it again.

287
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,420
Okay.
I'll give it to him.

288
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,470
Um, tom, may i ask you something?

289
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,150
Did you and lynette do the family bed 
when your children were babies?

290
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,850
Well, it wasn't exactly a choice.

291
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,250
They just kept crawling in there.

292
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:19,580
So, um, not to pry, but, um, did that create any, 
uh, issues for you?

293
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,300
You mean sex?

294
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,810
Apparently, "not to pry" wasn't necessary.

295
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,970
Well, it did put a crimp on things at first, 
but that just forced us toe more creative.

296
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:33,170
- Again, not to pry, but-
- the office.

297
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,150
We did it at the office, once in the car, 

298
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:39,250
and you remember when youasked us to wa 
when you guys were going out of town?

299
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,300
Okay.

300
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:41,770
Thanks.

301
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,180
Yes, um, we'll be going now.

302
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,250
Hey, other than your issue, 
how does orson like being a dad?

303
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,650
Oh, he just adores it.

304
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:53,410
The three of us are such a happy little family.

305
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:54,650
Aren't we?

306
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,080
That is great.

307
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,880
- Bye.
- Bye.

308
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,350
♪♪♪♪♪♪

309
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,130
Shouldn leak anymore.

310
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:09,770
Great.

311
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,700
Why don't you grab us a couple beers?

312
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:18,850
Sylvia.

313
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,840
What are you doing here?

314
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:22,900
Beautiful house.

315
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,920
Look, you need to leave.

316
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,480
I don't want katherine finding you here.

317
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,620
Oh, but katherine's gone.

318
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,920
I waited until she drove away so we could be alone.

319
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,640
Aren't you gonna invite me in?

320
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,820
After you ruined my life?

321
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,770
I don't think so.

322
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:38,540
You ruined your own life.

323
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,390
You should have told the truth about us.

324
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:45,290
Sylvia, why don't you do us both 
a favor and go back to chicago?

325
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,580
Adam, let me in.

326
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,380
Hey, man.

327
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,940
Your, uh, your beer's getting warm.

328
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,790
Oh, you have guests.

329
00:15:55,630 --> 00:16:01,020
Well, i guess i'll just drop by some other time.

330
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:09,520
I'm sorry, man.

331
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,330
It just sounded like you needed a little help.

332
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:11,900
Thanks.

333
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,700
That's, um, a-an ex-patient...

334
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,310
With some pretty serious mental problems.

335
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,800
Uh, could you do me a big favor?

336
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:24,120
I'd rather katherine didn't know she was here.

337
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,780
Yeah, that's no problem.

338
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,010
You know, actually, i was gonna ask you a favor, too.

339
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:34,700
I've got this pain in my shoulder.

340
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:37,250
You--you think you could write me a prescription?

341
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:42,190
Oh, i wish i could help you out, 
but a gynecologist writing a prescription for a man?

342
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:44,030
It kind of raises a red flag.

343
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,900
Ah, don't worry about it.

344
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:52,120
This favor tng doesn't have to go both ways.

345
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,070
Linda, is mrs.Zimmerman here?

346
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:07,560
Hello, doctor.

347
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,390
Bree.

348
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:09,740
What a wonderful surprise.

349
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,710
Uh, i've got a new patient coming in.

350
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,800
Mmm, yes, you do.

351
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:16,610
I'm mrs.Zimmerman.

352
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:21,770
Uh, your message said you had 
a cavity that needed filling?

353
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:26,980
I was in a very naughty mood when i left that.

354
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:36,560
You're waiting outside.

355
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,660
Why are you waiting outside?

356
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:39,810
Everything is fine.

357
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:42,040
It's just, um, someone's here.

358
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,260
Oh, my god.

359
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,100
It's the police?

360
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,810
No, no.
No, nothing like that.

361
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,590
It's your stepfather.

362
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:02,740
Glen?

363
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,370
I don't believe it.

364
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:09,790
Lynnie.

365
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,870
Oh, it's been a long time.

366
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:12,910
Oh, god.

367
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:17,540
Only three decades give or take a year, but who cares?

368
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,140
Oh, gosh.

369
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,450
You look great.

370
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:24,050
Oh, so do you, although what--what--what's this?

371
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:25,380
Oh, just a little cancer.

372
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,610
No, but i kicked its ass.
I'm good now.

373
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,130
You come here.

374
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,550
Oh!

375
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,180
So why--why are you here?

376
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:40,210
Well...

377
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,230
Your mother called me.

378
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,330
She did?
Is she okay?x

379
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,340
Uh, she sounds fine.

380
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,000
She asked for money.

381
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,730
- I didn't know you guys had kept in touch.
- ????

382
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:57,890
?????At fairview park to give it to her, 
and i'm guessing you'll want to come with me.

383
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:01,350
Yes, yes, thank you, but where has she been staying?

384
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:04,840
She broke into a car and spent the night there.

385
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,440
Oh, my god.

386
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,820
But she did say it was a cadillac.

387
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,650
Oh, well, good.

388
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,440
At least she's not living like a hobo.

389
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:14,890
Oh, my god.

390
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,770
I'm so glad to see you again.

391
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,450
Oh, you, too, lynnie.

392
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,340
Hey, bree.

393
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,740
Hello, adam.

394
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,890
I just dropped by to see your husband.
Is he here?

395
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:33,070
He's in the exam room, readjusting the chair.

396
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:41,810
Look, i'm sorry mike is in such pain, 
but it's not really ethical for me to write him a prescription.

397
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:45,400
Know it's a little dicey, 
but you'd really be doing me a big favor.

398
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,330
By the way, bree looks great.

399
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:49,160
I haven't seen her since i delivered danielle's baby.

400
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:51,710
Sorry.

401
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,400
Your baby.

402
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:00,900
Hey, andrew.

403
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,770
What are you doing?

404
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:06,290
Just giving you that sewing room you always wand.

405
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,140
You're moving out?

406
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:12,380
But you can't afford an apartment.

407
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:16,500
I can afford this one, 
which will give you some idea how crappy the neighborhood is.

408
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:17,590
I'm sorry.

409
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,070
I don't--i don't understand.

410
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,230
Why are you doing this?

411
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,130
I'm doing this for you.

412
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:26,470
How are you gonna get a fresh start with 
your past mistakes stinking up the place?

413
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,920
Is this about the other morning?

414
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:32,140
Oh, for heaven sakes, you can't be serious.

415
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,200
I am.

416
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,100
In fact, i already gave the landlord a check.

417
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,300
So i hope the three of you are very happy.

418
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,900
Well, to be honest, 

419
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,200
i'm not entirely comfortable giving this to you, mike.

420
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,400
Pain medication only helps your symptoms.

421
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,900
If this is chronic, you need to be seeing a physical therapist.

422
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,000
You know what i need, orson?

423
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,900
I need to take a few weeks off, but i can't, 

424
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,300
'cause i've got to work...

425
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,100
For the baby, for julie's class trip,
the patio furniture 

426
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,100
and everything else susan's got me paying for.

427
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,000
Are you okay, mike?

428
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,300
You sound a little unhappy.

429
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,100
No, no, i'm happy,

430
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,600
and i don't mean to put all of this on susan.

431
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,900
It's just, when i signed up for this suburn dad thing,

432
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,700
i didn't exactly know what i was getting myself into.

433
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,200
No, i understand.

434
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,900
Still, this is no way to deal with stress.

435
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,300
It's not about stress.

436
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,000
It's about the pain i've been in every day
since i got hit by that car.

437
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,800
You mean this pain is related to your accident?

438
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,400
It wasn't an accident.

439
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,200
Some son of a bitch ran me down and took off.

440
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,500
Right.

441
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,400
Well, i hope this helps.

442
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,200
Oh, mike, you're home.

443
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,900
I was dreaming we were ponies.

444
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,100
That's nice.

445
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,500
Go back to sleep.

446
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,700
Hey, that kid, um,
barrett me by today.

447
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,300
What?

448
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,400
Yeah, he said that you owed him money for some...

449
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,500
Plumbing job that he helped you on.

450
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,100
Yeah.

451
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,300
Yeah, i gotta get that to him.

452
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,300
Oh.

453
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,700
He's coming back tomorrow.

454
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,400
Don't you think he would be perfect for julie?

455
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,200
Barrett, it's delfino.

456
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,500
I'm only gonna say this once.

457
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,800
I'll get you your money,
but don't ever come to my house again.

458
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,000
You got it?

459
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,300
Ever.

460
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,700
MAYOR MISSING

461
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,300
Yes, hello.

462
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:19,300
I'd, uh, like to leave an anonymous tip
about something important.

463
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,800
Uh, do you have some kind of voice mail menu for that?

464
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,700
Well, it's about the mayor.

465
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,000
Oh, i don't think he's missing.

466
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,300
I think he's dead.

467
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,200
Look, that's it.
We gotta go to the cops.

468
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,500
Carlos, please.

469
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,700
Look, we blew it with the fingerprints, all right?

470
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,600
Now they know someone else was with him on the boat.

471
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,500
They don't know that someone else was us.

472
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,900
It's just a matter of time.

473
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,900
I mean, make a list of people with a motive to kill victor.

474
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,100
Number one--you.

475
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,000
Number two--you.

476
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,200
Number three--maybe me, probably still you.

477
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,300
Okay, if we just stay lm and stick to the story...

478
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,600
We tried that.

479
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,600
It's not working.

480
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,100
I'm going to the cops.

481
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,500
Now you can either come with me or wait for them to come and get you.

482
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,300
Fine.

483
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,400
I'll go.

484
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,100
Thank you.

485
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,700
Can we at least have a drink before we go?

486
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,300
Calm our nerves?

487
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,900
I mean, you can't talk to the cops
the way you've been babbling to me.

488
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,500
I guess one drink wouldn't hurt.

489
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,800
You okay with tequila?

490
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,300
Only if it's the good stuff!

491
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,100
Oh, i think you'll find this has a real kick.

492
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,600
SLEEPING AID

493
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,100
Oh, and this is the worst.

494
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:54,700
During a dissection, my anatomy lab partner squirted stomach juice in my eye.

495
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,500
Ew.That is so disgusting.

496
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,600
Oh, it was terrible.

497
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,200
So gross.

498
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,800
Hey.

499
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,000
- What are you smiling about?
- My matchmaking skills.

500
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,500
Julie and barrett are really hitting it f.

501
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,000
- Barrett?
- Yeah, your friend.

502
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,300
I told you last night he was coming by again.

503
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,500
I appreciate all the pressure you're putting on me.

504
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,600
You're welcome.

505
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,500
Uh, julie, could you give us a minute?

506
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,900
Barrett and i have a little business to discuss.

507
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,600
Sure.

508
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,800
I'll just grab my jacket.

509
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,500
I thought i told you to stay away from my house.

510
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,200
But your wife invited me.

511
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,700
And, hey, you married into a cute family.

512
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,600
Kudos.

513
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:48,800
Here's your money.

514
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,200
Now get out.

515
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
We were just leaving.

516
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,700
I'm taking julie on a tour of my campus.

517
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,000
♪♪♪

518
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,800
??
With a lowlife drug dealer.

519
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,700
Lowlife?

520
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,600
Dude, i'm a pre-med student

521
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,000
who's found an enterprising way
to earn his way through college.

522
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,100
You, on the other hand, are a junkie, 

523
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,600
and i don't think you want your cute family knowing that, do ya?

524
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,100
I'll have her home by 10:00.

525
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,100
- This is delicious, mrs.Delfino.
- Thank you.

526
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,900
Hey, you know, would you like me
to pack some up for you guys to take?

527
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,800
This guy's a drug dealer.

528
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,200
What?

529
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,100
You remember those pills you found?

530
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,900
He sold them to me.

531
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,300
- Look, mrs.Delfino--
- get out of my house.

532
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,400
- Get him out of my house!
- Okay.

533
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,100
I'll go.

534
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,100
It's a shame, though.

535
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,800
He was such a good customer.

536
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:12,900
Hey.

537
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,900
Where'd barrett go?

538
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,200
Why am i so sleepy all of a sudden?

539
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,800
Oh, i don't know, 

540
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,700
but if you're not feeling well, maybe we should put this off.

541
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,300
No, no, no. We gotta go now.

542
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,600
Crap!

543
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:31,800
What?

544
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,000
Oh!

545
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,600
Detectives!

546
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,900
Any, uh, news on my husband?

547
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,600
Not yet, but we've got some more questions for you.

548
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,600
Oh, okay.

549
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,400
So ask away.

550
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,700
Mrs.Lang, were you having an affair with your ex-husband?

551
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,400
Carlos?

552
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,500
That's crazy.

553
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,600
Where'd you hear that?

554
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,100
Your neighbor called us.

555
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,600
Oh.

556
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,100
Well, you tell edie britt just because carlos dumped her,

557
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,500
doesn't mean she has to go around trashing my reputatn,

558
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,400
especially when she's the slut.

559
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,800
Well, have you seen him lately?

560
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:10,100
Boy, let me think
Uh...

561
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,800
Mm...

562
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,600
No.

563
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,900
No, i haven't.

564
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,200
This is lyons.

565
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,700
We're on our way.

566
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,500
Good news, mrs.Lang.

567
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,700
They found your husband.

568
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,300
Huh?

569
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,700
A couple of fishermen found him washed up on the beach.

570
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,700
He's unconscious but in stable condition.

571
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,800
Would you like to go to the hospital?

572
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,700
Well, why wouldn't i?

573
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,200
Just let me grab my purse.

574
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,200
Well, you can stop feeling guilty.

575
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,800
Victor's alive, and we're screwed.

576
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,700
Okay, what's the plan?

577
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,500
Once she shows up, you'll meet her and give her the money.

578
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,800
Then ask her to walk you back to the car.

579
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:16,100
I'll jump out, grab her, and while you open the trunk...

580
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,100
Lynette.

581
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,400
Fine, the backseat, but you're just gonna spoil her.

582
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,400
I see you still have that wicked sense of humor.

583
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,200
Yeah.

584
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,800
It's the one good thing you get from a crappy childhood.

585
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,400
You know, i...

586
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,800
I always regretted the way things ended.

587
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Why?

588
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,100
Mom cheated on you.

589
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,900
No one blames you for leaving.

590
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,600
It was, uh, more complicated than that.

591
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,200
- Hey, i'm not complaining.
- Well-- 

592
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,800
ah, there's booze-illa now.

593
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,500
All right, i'll go get her.

594
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:03,200
He bought those pills a long time ago
and never got around to paying the guy.

595
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,400
Wow.

596
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,600
Julie, it's not like 
it was heroin or crack.

597
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,100
It was just pain pills 
for his shoulder,

598
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,700
but we had a talk, and he has 
totally stopped taking them.

599
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,200
- Are you absolutely sure?
- Yeah.

600
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,200
Why?

601
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:23,300
Well, i was at the drugstore this morning, 
and i saw mike there, picking up a prescription.

602
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,300
Hello, stella.

How is it you look 
so much better than me?

607
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:46,800
- Well, i don't drink or sleep in cars
- oh, so that's your secret.

608
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,700

00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,900
So ashamed.

706
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,900
What does it matter anyway?

707
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,500
It wouldn't have changed 
anything between us.

708
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,800
Are you kidding?

709
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,000
It would've changed everything.

710
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:54,200
Oh, y-you would've given me a pass
on my drinking and my--my swearing, my--my men?

711
00:35:54,500 --> 00:36:00,500
If i understood why you couldn't stay married to
the only father, the only stable parent i'd ever known,

712
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,700
yeah, i could've found a way 
to forgive you all sorts of things.

713
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,400
We can talk about this later.

714
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,600
Let's go home.

715
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,200
I don't think so.

716
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,700
Listen to me.

717
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,600
I would be honored if you would 
come and live with us.

718
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:20,200
Having you around these 
past few months was sort of...

719
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,500
Fun.

720
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,000
It was great.

721
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:30,200
We actually figured out a way 
to stop torturg each other.

722
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,900
Then why not come back?

723
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,600
Because i don't want 
to screw that up,

724
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,900
and let's face it, lynette.

725
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,200
You know i would.

726
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:43,700
So why don't we just take our chips 
and leave the table winners?

727
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,200
But where will you live?

728
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,900
Actually, i have a thought.

729
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,500
Uh, sorry. I didn't mean 
to eavesdrop, but, um...

730
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:00,600
I happen to have an immaculately 
decorated guest room.

731
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,700
You know, he's always talked like that.

732
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,600
How did i not know you were queer?

733
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,300
I'm sorry.You want this aroun 

734
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,700
well, we always had a good time, 

735
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,800
and to tell the truth, 
i've been a little lonely lately.

736
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,500
Oh.

737
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,100
So i would be doing you a favor.

738
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,200
Fine, but i'm keeping the money.

739
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,400
It's a deal.

740
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,900
Does this work for you?

741
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,600
It does.

742
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,000
It really does.

743
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:42,300
Some stretches,
and the shoulder feels great.

744
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,000
That's a relief.

745
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,700
You, uh, gonna take a shower?

746
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:46,700
Yeah.

747
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,700
I might, um, 
go down for a snack in a minute.

748
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,800
Okay.

749
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,900
Mrs.Lang?

750
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,000
Uh, i'm dr.Wheeler,
your husband's neurologist.

751
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,300
How is he?

752
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:26,800
Uh, he's starting to wake up now.

753
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,100
Would you like to talk to him?

754
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,700
Of course!

755
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,000
I-i bet he's pretty delirious.

756
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:36,800
I mean, after his ordeal, i wouldn't be surprised
if he's just babbling like a crazy person!

757
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,400
Mr.Lang, your wife is here.

758
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,000
Gaby.

759
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,000
Hi.

760
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,700
Don't strain yoursel victor.

761
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,900
There's plenty of time to talk later.

762
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,000
Wh's important now is that you rest.

763
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,800
Just stay quiet and rest...

764
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:00,900
Quietly.

765
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,700
Mr.Mayor, i'm detective berry.

766
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,500
We need to ask you a few questions.

767
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,600
What time did you take your boat out?

768
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,500
I was on the boat?

769
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,100
We think.

770
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,500
We found it floating in the bay,

771
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,400
and, uh, obviously, you'd been 
in the water for quite some time.

772
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,600
Uh, the last thing i remember...

773
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,700
Was friday's staff meeting.

774
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,600
Really?

775
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,200
I mean, what?

776
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,000
Gaby, do you remember anythi 
about me being on the boat?

777
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:32,800
No.

778
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,100
No.

779
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:35,800
Sorry.

780
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,700
I guess i don't remember anything.

781
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,600
Not uncommon in these situations.

782
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,500
He's suffered both 
a mild concussion and hypothermia, 

783
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,500
either of which could 
result in memory loss.

784
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,000
Well, who cares?

785
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,300
The important ing is that he's safe, 
and we're gonna nue you back to health, 

786
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,300
and i think that would happen 
a lot faster if we all clear out.

787
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,400
Thank you.

788
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,200
Gaby, 

789
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,300
can you stay with me 
for a little while?

790
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,400
Of course.

791
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,500
Sounds like i was 
in pretty bad shape there.

792
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,700
But you're okay now.

793
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,000
That's the important thing.

794
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,400
Come here.

795
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,900
I remember everything.

796
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,700
What?

797
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,800
I think i will rest now.

798
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:39,200
I'm gonna need all my strength.

799
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:57,200
The past is never truly behind us.

800
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:04,700
Ghosts lurk in the shadows, eager to 
remind us of the choices we made.

801
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,300
But if we look back,

802
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:13,100
we might find an old friend 
with open arms...

803
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:19,000
Or an old enemy 
with a hidden agenda.

804
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:26,900
Or a grown-up son 
with a forgiving heart...

805
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:33,500
Sadly, some of us 
refuse to look back, 

806
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,900
never understanding that 
by denying the past...

807
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,400
We are condemned...

808
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,200
To repeat it.
