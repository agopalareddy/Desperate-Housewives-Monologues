1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,130
previously on.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:06,780
susan and mike finally tied the knot.

3
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:09,220
Lynette got some disturbing news.

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,950
Where the hell do you get off having cancer and not telling me about it?

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,000
Mom.

6
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,000
Bree returned from her trip.

7
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:16,800
holy crap!

8
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:18,500
- With a surprise.
- There you go.

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,700
Gaby married victor.

10
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,600
Gaby is the smartest thing you've ever done.

11
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:24,090
With her bringing in the latino vote,

12
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,660
the governor's mansion's as good as yours.

13
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:26,850
While carlos.

14
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,320
why are you so reluctant to make a commitment to me?

15
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:30,980
Ended it with edie.

16
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,920
I am done with you.

17
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,530
But the search for true happiness

18
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,960
led to events that were unexpected and distinctly.

19
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:45,720
desperate.

20
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:55,760
the first thing you should know is that edie britt never actually intended to die,

21
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,350
but someone she loved was trying to leave her.

22
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,180
So she planned every detail,

23
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:12,420
from the silk scarf she'd hang by to the suicide note detailing her despair.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,860
Now all edie had to do.

25
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,120
was wait.

26
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,290
for her beloved to come home.

27
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,620
Hey,edie!

28
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,200
I'm here to get my stuff.

29
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,640
You see,to hold on to her man,

30
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:33,220
edie knew she'd have to find the perfect moment to let go.

31
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,280
Hey,carlos!

32
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,040
Sadly for edie.

33
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:40,200
can I talk to you?

34
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:44,200
Her timing was fatally flawed.

35
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:45,220
mrs.Mccluskey?

36
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,550
I need to show you something.

37
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,490
Come here.

38
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:53,840
What's this?

39
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,920
those are trash cans.

40
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:59,390
I know they're trash cans,smart-ass.

41
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:04,410
I'm asking what they're doing out on a saturday night when the trash got picked up on thursday.

42
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:09,100
Fine.

43
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,380
I will take them in.

44
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:11,640
Happy now?

45
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,150
Carlos.

46
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,500
what the hell is that?

47
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,610
And this is how carlos solis arrived just in the nick of time to save the life of edie britt.

48
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,080
oh,baby.

49
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,580
What did you do?

50
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,130
Come on,you gotta wake up.

51
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,720
Come on,please?

52
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:47,840
Of course,had he known what she was about to do to his life.

53
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,870
he would've let her hang there.

Season 4 Episode 1</font>

57
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,350
There is a certain time of night,

58
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,110
after children have been put to bed and husbands have begun snoring,

59
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:17,070
that women lie awake and think of the secrets they've been keeping from their friends.

60
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,530
It might be an impromptu wedding.

61
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,920
or a recently diagnosed tumor.

62
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,820
or a make-believe pregnancy.

63
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,250
Regardless,it's all they will think of.

64
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:41,560
until something comes along to remind them that other people have secrets,too.

65
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,050
Carlos.

66
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,200
how is she?  What did the doctors say?

67
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:52,380
Uh,theye got edie on a ventilator,but she's gonna be okay.

68
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,010
What the hell happened? How could she pull a stunt like this?

69
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,730
Uh,she left a note which pretty much blames me.

70
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,620
Oh,sweetie.

71
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,070
I can't believe this is happening.

72
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,590
It's like mary alice all over again.

73
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,940
Yes,but the good news is she's gonna live.

74
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,470
I know it's her wedding night,but do you think we should call gaby?

75
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,490
Oh,crap.

76
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:18,970
gaby?

77
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,840
You know,this betr be one hell of a wedding night,

78
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:22,460
considering how long you're taking in there.

79
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,840
Trust me,victor.

80
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,220
This will be a night you'll never forget.

81
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:30,920
let's get out of here.

82
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:31,570
what?

83
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,860
I'm serious.You,me-- just screw it all.

84
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,040
Let'S.

85
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,440
let's run away together.

86
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,880
I just got married.

87
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:40,590
There are 200 people out there waiting for me to lead a conga line.

88
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,940
Gaby,you just said you don't feel like victor really loves you,

89
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,740
and you know I do.I've never stopped.

90
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,260
I can't dump him on our wedding day.

91
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,140
That's a horrible thing to do,even to vict.

92
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,660
He'll get over it,but I've never gotten over losing you,

93
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,120
and I won't let it happen again!

94
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,480
gaby,you in here?

95
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,270
Gaby?

96
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,810
I was.

97
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,660
just counting gifts.

98
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:14,190
oh,that's fine.I-I was actually looking for that publicist guy.

99
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,810
- You haven't seen him,have you?
- Nope.

100
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,750
Okay.

101
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,260
I'll give you a holler when I need you.

102
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,220
come on!

103
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:28,000
Who doesn't wear underwear on their wedding day?

104
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,440
oh,focus,you idiot!

105
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,210
Come on.When are we leaving?

106
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,240
so we're doing this?

107
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,070
Great.

108
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,630
Uh,it'll take me a few hours to get stuff together.

109
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:41,200
I'm gonna pick you up tonight.Just be packed and ready to go.

110
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,380
Okay.Wait!

111
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,550
Aren't you gonna kiss the bride?

112
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,820
finally!

113
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,780
carlos,where the hell are you?

114
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,890
I'm at the hospital.

115
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,330
Edie tried to kill herself tonight.

116
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,710
Oh,my god! Is she okay?

117
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,120
I found her just in time,but obviously,i can't come pick you up tonight.

118
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:05,920
Okay,that's all right.

119
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,500
I'll just take a cab and meet you.

120
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,410
Gaby,I can't leave edie now.

121
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,550
Look,maybe in a couple weeks.

122
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,960
In a few weeks? What?

123
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,600
No! It has to be tonight!

124
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,620
Victor's in the bedroom right now waiting to consummate.

125
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,890
And edie's on a ventilator.

126
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,710
Look,you don't have to stay with victor.

127
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,850
You have a house.

128
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:26,680
Okay,you know,running away with you on my wedding night was crazy enough.

129
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:29,060
But runninaway to be alone is insane!

130
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:31,460
Gaby,please,she needs me.

131
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:32,390
Can't you just wait?

132
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,330
No!

133
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,960
I would rather try and work it out with victor.

134
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:43,330
gaby,are you coming to bed?

135
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,500
one month later

136
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,720
Happy 1-month anniversary.

137
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:57,770
I didn't know we were doing this.

138
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:01,330
Well,we've just been so happy thlast four weeks,I thought we should celebrate.

139
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,180
you are happy,right?

140
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,490
Yeah.

141
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,960
I've never been happier.

142
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,630
Aw,that's sweet.

143
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,430
I don't believe you.

144
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,560
- Susan
- I watch you sometimes,and you seem very.

145
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:27,120
disconnected,like something's missing.

146
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,670
Nothing is missing.

147
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,810
So our life together is exactly how you pictured it?

148
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,040
You've gotten everything you wanted?

149
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,260
Yeah,pretty much.

150
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:40,150
"Pretty much" means there is something that you want that you don't have.

151
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,570
How can I give it to you if you don't tell me what it is?

152
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:49,730
Susan,I swear,I am ecstatically,beyond my wildest dreams,lip-smackingly happy.

153
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,210
You got it?

154
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,230
This marriage is doomed.

155
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:03,550
hey,a moving van just pulled up.

156
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,720
Oh,andrew,I'm having problems with my strap.

157
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:07,670
Could you help me?

158
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,720
Look,I told you three weeks ago I was no longer participating in your little hoax,

159
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:13,360
and that includes strapping you in.

160
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:14,780
Oh,for heaven's sakes.

161
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:17,910
Orson,could you come help me,please?

162
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:21,120
I'll remember this the next time you want money for leather pants.

163
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,270
People are gonna find out,all right?

164
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,000
And then we're gonna all look like idiots.

165
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,590
Well,not if we're careful.

166
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,160
This isn't the '50s,okay?

167
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,790
Teenage girls get pregnant all the time.

168
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,340
I mean,my ex-lab partner's practically a grandmother.

169
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:36,490
Look,this family's reputation is already hanging by a thread.

170
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,740
I mean,first people thought that your stepfather was a wife killer,

171
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,700
then your sister takes up with her history teacher,

172
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:44,220
and now we're supposed to parade a little bastard up and down the street.

173
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:46,580
We might as well sit on the porch and play banjos.

174
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:52,210
Bree,you know,there's a moving van next door.

175
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,790
mom,are you awake?

176
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,270
Okay,honey.

177
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,000
Just give me a minute.

178
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,860
Give me a minute.

179
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,260
My wig is gone.

180
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,720
- Where is it?
- It's on the nightstand.

181
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:15,940
No! No,I'm looking at the nightstand,and all I see are a few stray hairs

182
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:20,150
and this sports blooper dv you thought would cheer me up.

183
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,350
Peyton manning is funny.

184
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:22,960
mom!

185
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:24,790
Hey,I'm coming!

186
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,510
Hey,don't just sit there like a lump!

187
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,240
Come on! Help me look!

188
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:33,180
Oh,goD.Honey,this is one of those moments when it occurs to me that wouldn't it be easier

189
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:35,890
if we just told everyone that you have cancer?

190
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,250
I found it.

191
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,500
Look,I mean,I get not wanting to scare the kids,

192
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,810
buto keep all of our friends in the dark.

193
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,680
look,I can deal with the chemo.

194
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:46,170
I can deal with people telling me my hair has never looked better.

195
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:50,180
But what I cannot deal with is the pity,so we are doing it my way.

196
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,370
You were crooked.

197
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,930
hey,sweetie,what's up?

198
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,840
There's a moving van across the street.

199
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:07,390
so you want it listed right away?

200
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,910
And don't worry about getting top dollar.

201
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,620
I want this place priced to move.

202
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,600
What's going on here?

203
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,080
I'm meeting with our realtor.

204
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,490
Gaby,you remember gil.

205
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,530
I remember telling you I wasn't ready to sell the house yet.

206
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,080
Gil,could you give us a minute,please?

207
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,070
Yeah.

208
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,310
Gaby,we agreed that after we got married,you would sell the house.

209
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,210
I still have a lot of stuff here.

210
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,330
Well,my house is over 10,000 square feet.

211
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,970
I'm pretty sure there are closets.

212
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,400
I'm just not in a rush to unload this house,okay?

213
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,430
This was my home.I was very happy here.

214
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,710
But we've got a new home now.

215
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,040
Aren't you happy there?

216
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,500
Yeah,it's a great house.

217
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:46,030
Well,good.

218
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,520
Then sell this place.

219
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:49,980
What are you waiting for?

220
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,640
I'm not waiting for anything.

221
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,470
Look,a moving van.

222
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,810
New neighbors.What do we know?

223
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,450
Well,uh,dining chairs.There's a clue.

224
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,400
Yes.It proves they eat sitting down.

225
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:12,920
No,I mean they're stickley.

226
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,130
It means they have taste.

227
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,030
And money.

228
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,810
They've been remodeling for weeks.

229
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,170
I wish edie were here.

230
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,250
Without her,there's no one to give us the dish.

231
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:25,270
Yet another illustration of the fundamental selfishness of suicide.

232
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:31,150
Do you think this is them?

233
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:45,580
oh,my god.Katherine.

234
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,720
katherine!

235
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,500
susan!

236
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,440
I cannot believe it has been 12 years.

237
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:02,470
You haven't changed a bit.

238
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,650
Well,you clearly have.Your eyesight's going.

239
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,080
How's your aunt?

240
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:10,490
Katherine used to live here with mrs.Sims.

241
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,320
not very well,I'm afraid.

242
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:14,530
That's really the reason why we moved back.

243
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:18,270
I didn't want poor aunt lily to spend her final days in a nursing home.

244
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,460
That is so kind of you.

245
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,130
yeah,it is.

246
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:25,870
oh,and as luck would have it,my husband found a job here.

247
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,910
Adam,could you wave or something?

248
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,220
Hello,ladies.

249
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,510
I look forward to meeting you when I'm a little less sweaty.

250
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,380
he's a cutie.

251
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,320
What does he do?

252
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:37,550
He's a doctor.

253
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,850
Okay,don't take this personally,but we hate you.

254
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,540
Mom?

255
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,610
I finished unpacking my room.

256
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,640
Do you need any help?

257
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:46,940
Oh,my god.

258
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:49,010
This is not little dylan.

259
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,390
I'm susan,julie's mom.

260
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,590
She is gonna be so excited to see you.

261
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,900
Great.

262
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,620
Who's julie again?

263
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:59,510
Honey,you remember--your best friend when you were little.

264
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,630
Oh,right.

265
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,580
Why don't you go help your stepfather with the last few boxes?

266
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,490
It's nice meetg you all.

267
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,320
what a beautiful family.

268
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:09,670
I feel so lucky to have you for a neighbor.

269
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,520
No,i am the lucky one.

270
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:12,900
Look at my view.

271
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:15,990
Your garden is absolutely breathtaking.

272
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,120
And that pine tree in the backyard.

273
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,810
it's my pride and joy.

274
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:25,160
Oh,it absolutely kills me to have to ask you to cut it down.

275
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,690
Excuse me?

276
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:32,600
Well,I'm sorry,but I'm not gonna be able to grow my prize-winning vegetables with that tree blocking all the sunlight.

277
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,500
Oh,well,I'm--I'm sorry about your vegetables,

278
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:39,680
but that pine shields my view of the purcells' backyard,

279
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,850
and if you had ever seen mr.Purcell sunbathe,

280
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,690
well,you'd know exactly what that tree means to me.

281
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,390
well,I don't want to quarrel.

282
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,470
We will not touch that tree until we have come up with a solution to our problem.

283
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,780
Curtains,perhaps.

284
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,060
So you're back.

285
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,410
How fun.

286
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,870
I should have a brunch so that everyone can get to know you.

287
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,820
No,no need.

288
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:05,960
I'm having a barbecue this saturday.

289
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,630
I'm inviting the whole neighborhood.

290
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,980
Oh,you don't need to do that.

291
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:10,920
I insist.

292
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:13,120
I have missed wisteria lane so much,

293
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,330
and I wanna do something special for my dear,old friends.

294
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,630
and all you lovely newcomers.

295
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:31,220
the nice thing about this fake pregnancy is my feet don't swell.

296
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:36,920
I mean,I'd never be able to squeeze into these sling-backs if I really was 8 12 months pregnant.

297
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:41,980
bree!

298
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,830
Don't you look radiant!

299
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:46,150
Well,hello,mrs.Mckeever.

300
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,990
Well,I heard that you were expecting,but I had no idea how far along you were.

301
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,320
May I?

302
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:53,900
There's no need.

303
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,430
the baby's just not kicking right now.

304
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,240
Sometimes,if you give them a little jiggle,you can get them to move.

305
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,680
Oh,she doesn't really wanna be jiggled right now.

306
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,150
She's very sensitive down there.

307
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,540
But I'll be gentle.

308
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:09,130
You know,in my day,mothers thought that it was good luck.

309
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:12,490
Perhaps I need to make my point a little more clearly.

310
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:15,720
Bree,you're hurting me!

311
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,430
Is there a problem here?

312
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,900
No,not at all!

313
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:22,670
I'm just saying hello to a very dear friend of mine.

314
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,930
are you gonna back off now?

315
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,090
car's here,dear.

316
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,320
Lovely to see you,mrs.Mckeever.

317
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,800
Why must old ladies always do that?

318
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:42,230
I don't know,but you've got to stop roughing them up.

319
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:47,310
I'm sorry,susan.

320
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,610
Dr.Gorenberg just had a patient go into labor.

321
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,180
His new partner is covering for him,if you're comfortable with that.

322
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,280
Sure.

323
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:54,980
I'm just here for a checkup.

324
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,930
Doctor?

325
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,270
Thank you.

326
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:01,530
I'm dr.Mayfair.

327
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,010
I'm gonnA.

328
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,720
hold it.Have we met?

329
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,060
Yes.Yesterday.

330
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,050
Susan mayer.

331
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,370
Your new neighbor.

332
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,750
Right.

333
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,270
I-I didn't know you were.

334
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,170
this kind of doctor.

335
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,030
I sure am.

336
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:23,620
Listen,um.

337
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:27,270
- maybe this isn't-
- feet up,please.

338
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,110
Okay.

339
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,870
And scootch down.

340
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:43,250
It's just that it's weird,you know,considering you're.

341
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,370
where'd you go?

342
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,670
and relax.

343
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,670
sorry.

344
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,680
And relax.

345
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,920
sorry.

346
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:04,320
And relax.

347
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:05,220
Sorry.

348
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:09,410
Um,hey,not to change the subject,but when is dr.Gorenberg coming back?

349
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,320
Almost done.

350
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,300
you know,katherine has talked about you for years.

351
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:18,610
It's nice to finally put a face to the name.

352
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,650
lynette!

353
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:40,000
Muriel.How are you doing?

354
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:40,990
What's up?

355
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,300
You look good.

356
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,440
Don't try to sweet-talk me,lynette scavo.

357
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:47,830
I am fit to be tied.

358
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,210
Did you or did you not volunteer to run the fund-raising gala?

359
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,230
Yeah.

360
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,700
Things have been a little weird lately--

361
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:58,010
don't even think of wriggling out of this,lynette.

362
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,630
Every other third grade mom has chaired an event.

363
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,540
It is your tur

364
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:07,180
okay.I'll jump right on it.

365
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,250
Great.

366
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,690
Okay.

367
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,120
See.

368
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:16,530
that's where someone with half a brain would have played the cancer card.

369
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,580
I can handle it.

370
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,700
Like hell.

371
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:20,200
You've been nauseous all day from the chemo.

372
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,890
you shouldn't even be here!

373
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,870
It's my life.

374
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,400
Some stupid disease is not gonna keep me from living it.

375
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:27,940
Besides,parker's expecting to see me.

376
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,280
There.

377
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:33,350
He saw you.

378
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,370
We'll duck out when the lights go down.

379
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,080
He's gonna be watching for me all day.

380
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,060
He's one of the leads.

381
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,740
He's friar tuck.

382
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,270
It's a thankless role.

383
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:51,630
well,everything seems normal.

384
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,750
But you say you've been having irregular periods.

385
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,830
Yeah.

386
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,200
You know,one month off,two months on.

387
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:59,580
That happens,right?

388
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,390
Ever experience night sweats?

389
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,070
Um,sometimes.

390
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,350
But mike's a big spooner.

391
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,380
He's like sleeping with a hibachi.

392
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,720
um,how about hot flashes?

393
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:12,010
Okay,whoa.

394
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,590
I'm gonna stop you right there.

395
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,890
I am way too young for that.Please refer to your chart.

396
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:20,610
Susan,I know for a lot of women the word "menopause" has negative connotations.

397
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:26,090
They hear,um,"aging," "brittle bones," um,"loss of sexual desire."

398
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,220
Okay,before we go any further,can I check those diplomas?

399
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:32,960
'Cause I would just like to make sure that they're not from some med school in the philippines.

400
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:34,710
Look,there's a simple blood test we can use to find out.

401
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,880
I don't need any test!

402
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:37,740
I am not old enough for menopause.

403
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:41,870
Now I don't know what kind of nonsense they taught you at.

404
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:47,130
harvard medical school,class of.'97?

405
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,610
Oh,my god!

406
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,240
I am old!

407
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,490
Just give me the damn test.

408
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,060
we will live in these woods till our work is donE.

409
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:02,060
If the sheriff comes,we will drive him away with our bows and arrows.

410
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,630
You okay?

411
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,420
I'm feeling a little.

412
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:09,270
god save all ye merry men!

413
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,040
I beseech thee!

414
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:15,030
Pray that I may join your man-- band of merry men.

415
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:21,430
I am more than just a jolly friar,for I can have both a sword and an arrow!

416
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,740
We must support robin hood.

417
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,810
oh,I'm gonna be sick!

418
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,730
Right there with you,lady.

419
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,840
All hail robin hood!

420
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,570
okay,let's go.

421
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,560
No! It's too late!

422
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,420
bravo!

423
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,250
I'm sorry.

424
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,720
I'll get you a new purse.

425
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:52,760
Fine,but that wasn't my purse.

426
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,610
hello. You have everything you need?

427
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,620
You just let me know.
Hi!Good to see you!

428
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,470
Oh,you look great!

429
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,490
Mrs.Mccluskey. Hello.

430
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:21,460
how are you? Do you remember me?

431
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:24,620
You're bess truman,right?
Of course I remember you.

432
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:28,370
If that's your way of checking if
my brain's gone all tapioca,I'm fine.

433
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,930
sorry.

434
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,810
So I saw your kid and your
new husband. Nice catch.

435
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,240
Oh. Well,thank you.

436
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,660
I'm very eager for him to
experience life on wisteria lane.

437
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:41,620
The times that dylan and I spent
here were the happiest of our lives.

438
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,470
Yeah? Then why'd you
take off so suddenly?

439
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,250
You skipped town without
even saying good-bye.

440
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:49,720
My,you do remember a lot,don't you?

441
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,530
Excuse me. Really must mingle.

442
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,540
I think these eggs are past their prime.

443
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:08,380
So you just shun them
and throw them away.

444
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:12,320
Well,yeah,since mayonnaise
left out in the sun can kill ya.

445
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:16,650
Everything okay? You
seem kinda moody today.

446
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,490
Yeah,get used to it.

447
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,530
Okay,did I do something
wrong? No.I'm sorry.

448
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,390
I'm just a little.

449
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:26,010
you know what? Forget it.

450
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,620
Let's eat.

451
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:30,730
yoo-hoo,susan! We saved you a place!

452
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:35,830
come on! We want you over here.Come on.

453
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,390
oh,my god! Dylan!

454
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,520
Hi.

455
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:48,170
It's me. julie.

456
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,860
Julie's the one we were talking about.

457
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:50,690
- Hi,honey!
- Hi!

458
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,690
She was your best friend.

459
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,200
Yeah,and I-I brought you a little
wcome back gift. Your favorite.

460
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,190
Oh,my goodness.

461
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,570
You remember how much
you used to love licorice?

462
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,580
I did?

463
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:06,330
Okay.

464
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:11,600
Come on. I've got some of the
old gang I want you to meet.

465
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:13,190
Have fun!

466
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,190
menopause?

467
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,780
Aren't you a little young for that?

468
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,430
I know.

469
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,990
And you thought you married a vibrant woman
in her prime,and instead,you got a wife who'S.

470
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,670
dry and dusty.

471
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,970
oh,honey.

472
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:32,040
No,it's--it's a
natural part of life.

473
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:34,830
Yeah,the part before death. Oh!

474
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:38,610
Look,I know that it's upsetting,but
it's really not that big a deal.

475
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,770
Yes,it is! What if you wanna have kids?

476
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,940
We agreed that we didn'T.

477
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:42,910
No,you said you did.

478
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,690
I said I didn't,then
you changed your mind.

479
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,760
What if you change it back?

480
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:46,610
That's not gonna happen.

481
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:51,130
Listen,my last egg could be on its
way down the chute at this very moment.

482
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:55,240
If you wanna have kids,you
might wanna jump on it right now.

483
00:23:56,070 --> 00:24:00,690
All righ this is all very romantic,but
let me be clear about this,okay?

484
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:06,150
I love you,and if kids don't
happen,I'm fine with that.

485
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,590
I don't want you to be fine.

486
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,160
I want you to be happy.

487
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:14,650
All right,I'm just trying to
find a nice way to shut you up,so.

488
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,350
yep,we're doomed.

489
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:29,420
hey. Hey,look who's back.

490
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:32,550
oh,my gosh. She's out of the clinic.

491
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,670
Thanks,darling.

492
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,270
- Hi!
- Hi!

493
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,760
How are you?

494
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:42,730
- Oh,careful--the
neck. - Oh,sorry.

495
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,960
Thank you all so much for the cards.

496
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:49,800
Sometimes it takes a near tragedy to
realize just how much you're loved.

497
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:54,480
So why don't you talk to your
friends,and I'll go unpack the car?

498
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:56,580
Oh,thanks,sweetheart.

499
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,390
I have to admit that I was.

500
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,020
a little concerned about how
you'd react when you saw me.

501
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:06,740
But this. throwing me a party?

502
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,820
well. we just all love ya.

503
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:16,750
and,edie,you look great. Especially.

504
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,540
you know,given the circumstances.

505
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:22,360
You mean that I tried to hang myself.

506
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:23,480
it's okay.

507
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:25,880
The doctor encouraged
me to talk about it.

508
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:28,080
Surely not over food.

509
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:30,370
Well,carlos and i talk
about it all the time.

510
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:34,500
You know,and this whole thing has
just brought us closer together.

511
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:37,690
We've actually talked about marriage.

512
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,720
hello. I don't think we've met.

513
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:45,860
I'm katherine mayfair,your new neighbor.

514
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:48,840
Oh,edie. It's a pleasure to meet you.

515
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,860
Welcome to my party.

516
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,160
So I hear congratulations are in order.

517
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:01,280
Edie just announced
you're getting married.

518
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:02,710
Best wishes!

519
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,880
We're not engaged.

520
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:07,440
That was just a kind of
a what if conversation.

521
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:10,170
Really? Because she thinks
you're getting married.

522
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,830
Everyone else thinks
you're getting married.

523
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,120
So,again,best wishes.

524
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:16,120
Gaby,the woman tried to kill
herself because I left her.

525
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:17,780
She's not real good with disappointment.

526
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,760
Neither am I!

527
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:22,710
You told me you wanna run away together,and
then I don't hear from you for a month!

528
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,320
That was only because I was
going through stuff with edie,

529
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:26,910
but it doesn't mean that I wasn't
thinking about you constantly.

530
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,660
you were not.

531
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,030
Yes,I was.

532
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,050
Every second of every day.

533
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:36,770
Yeah,well,I.

534
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:39,250
kind of thought about you,too.

535
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:43,150
- I need to be with you,gaby.
- Yeah?

536
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,280
Prove it.

537
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:47,030
Can you get away tonight?

538
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,540
Oh,my god,are you serious?

539
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,340
Damn right I am.

540
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:59,520
I just have to be back by
midnight to give edie her pills.

541
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:00,420
What?

542
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:02,530
If we're gonna have an
affair,we've gotta be discreet.

543
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,650
Affair?

544
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,850
I thought we were talking
about runng away together.

545
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:06,880
I can't do that.

546
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:08,920
Edie's too fragile right now.

547
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:13,120
That old battle-ax is
gonna outlive us all!

548
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:14,690
Hey,don't talk about her like that.

549
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:18,840
Oh,far be it for me to speak ill
of the future mrs.Carlos solis.

550
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:20,120
We are not getting married!

551
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:21,680
Best wishes!

552
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,080
no. Absolutely not.

553
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:32,590
That's my final answer.

554
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,780
Well,talk to you later.

555
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:36,990
That was danielle.

556
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,750
Now she wants us to send
a dvd player for her room.

557
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,260
Well,that hardly seems extravagant.

558
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:44,140
You're missing the point! It's
a convent,not the four seasons.

559
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:46,170
You have mustard on your chin.

560
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:51,180
I mean,it's one thing to forgive bad
behavior. It's another thing to reward it.

561
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:53,860
There are consequences for her mistakes.

562
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,970
Bree! Oh,my god!

563
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,250
Are you all right?

564
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,780
Oh! No,no,I'm fine!I'm fine!

565
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,270
- You're bleeding!
- No,no,no!

566
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,260
It's just,uh--oh,it's
a little barbecue sauce.

567
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:06,210
Where is katherine's husband?

568
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,880
- He's a doctor.
- She's fine.

569
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:10,010
Adam! Adam!

570
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,320
Get over here right now!

571
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:14,190
Bree got stabbed in the belly!

572
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,660
Oh,my god,are you all
right? Let me take a look.

573
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:16,620
No,it's nothing!

574
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:19,830
Ah,uh,we were just teasing ida.

575
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,560
- It's something we do.
- Yes.

576
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,600
look,it's a. trick
ba--barbecue fork.

577
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:27,030
We got it at a magic shop.

578
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,560
Uh,see? Retractable!

579
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:31,970
Oh,my baby!

580
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:36,500
That's quite a trick.

581
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:39,810
hey,let's go freak out mrs.Mccluskey.

582
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:43,500
he's such a scamp.

583
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:51,980
Psycho mom at 5:00.

584
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:54,720
You say the word,she gets
a face full of pig bones.

585
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:58,150
Aw,my hero.

586
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,060
I can handle her.

587
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:02,690
lynette.

588
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,530
I just spoke with helen,and
imagine my surprise when she told me

589
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:08,430
that you'd not started on
the decorations for the gala.

590
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,850
I'm in charge of decorations?

591
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:14,670
Yes,which you would've known had
you bothered to pick up the packet.

592
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,590
I don't want to hear it.

593
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,310
Okay.

594
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,950
piggyback,mommy.

595
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,370
I'm sorry,sweetie.

596
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:35,360
I'm just-- I'm just
too tired right now.

597
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:38,150
Here,honey,I'll get ya.

598
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:41,740
yes!

599
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,870
Mommy has to conserve her
energy for more important things.

600
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:58,900
We are not throwing in the
towel over a minor mishap.

601
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:01,120
How many more mishaps are
we gonna get away with?

602
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:03,190
Yesterday,it was an old woman
in the macy's shoe department.

603
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,920
Today,a magic fork in the belly.

604
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:09,220
Pretty soon,this whole charade will
completely unravel,and we will be humiliated.

605
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:10,630
We're already in too deep.

606
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,330
We could go on a trip,tell people
you miscarried while we were away.

607
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,210
And then what would happen to the baby?

608
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,990
Well,danielle would keep it.

609
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,350
You think danielle
could raise this child?

610
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,350
Orson,you've seen her in action.

611
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,010
She's--she's shallow,and
she's--she's selfish!

612
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,240
She would ruin this child's life!

613
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,970
How can you say that?

614
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,230
Because I'm her mother.

615
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:34,840
And I know what I've created,and
that's the real humiliation.

616
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,320
Orson.

617
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:44,020
is child deserves better.

618
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:46,830
And I know what to do now. Please.

619
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:49,830
please let me try.

620
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:53,550
So.

621
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,690
really,what you want is a second chance?

622
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:59,860
Well,would that be so horrible?

623
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:06,660
Well,then.

624
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:11,310
let the charade continue.

625
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,470
- So you're bailing on me now?
- I know.

626
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,570
- The timing is terrible.
- Damn right!

627
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,050
It's three weeks before the gala.

628
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:28,500
I just didn't realize how tired
I would be when I took this on.

629
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:29,760
Oh,we're all tired,lynette.

630
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:32,130
But some of us still manage
to honor our commitments.

631
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,330
Okay,I'm gonna be honest with you.

632
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:38,240
- I haven't been feeling that great lately.
- Oh,don't whine to me about your aches and pains.

633
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:40,410
I've had the sammigraine since '87.

634
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:44,070
And my knee's so bad,I can't
even use the treadmill anymore.

635
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:45,940
Yeah.

636
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,410
That's rough.

637
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,860
By the way.

638
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,410
I have cancer.

639
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:04,080
I'll give helen a call.

640
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:24,530
so I am halfway through chemo,and
my doctor is very confident

641
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:28,360
that I'm going to beat
this,so you can all relax.

642
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:30,230
I'm not going to die.

643
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:38,250
Well,not unless we kill you.

644
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:42,670
Damn it,lynette. What did
we say after mary alice.

645
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,470
after edie? Why didn't they tell us?

646
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,510
We're your friends. Why
would you shut us out?

647
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:54,600
I just liked being able to throw on my
wig and join you guys for a cup of coffee

648
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:57,520
and a good gossip
about the new neighbors.

649
00:32:57,530 --> 00:33:01,360
You know,for five minutes,I could
pretend I wasn't a sick person.

650
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:06,530
But once your friends know you're
sick,you can't pretend anymore

651
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:10,110
'cause you can see
it in their eyes--

652
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:13,050
the fear,the pity.

653
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:16,610
Is that all you see in our eyes?

654
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,480
No. No,of course not.

655
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,020
You know what? Let's make a pact.

656
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:32,100
No more secrets.

657
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:38,480
From now on,we tell each other
every shocking detail of our lives.

658
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,860
- I'm in.
- Me,too.

659
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,020
You with us?

660
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:52,780
Absolutely.

661
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:57,450
No more secrets.

662
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:07,430
You're right. I'm not happy.Let's talk.

663
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:15,480
All I'm saying is I just wanna
know that i come first with you.

664
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:18,690
Sometimes I feel less like
your wife than a possession.

665
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:21,070
It's demeaning.
It's--it'S.

666
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,750
why are you smiling right now?

667
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,030
Because this is fantastic.

668
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:27,330
After weeks of shutting me out,you're
finally telling me how you feel.

669
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,480
We should do this all the time.

670
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:31,140
Well,it's hard when you're so busy.

671
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:39,950
maybe we should go away and just
take a couple weeksr a month.

672
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:43,930
Let's rediscover wt it was that
made us fall in love to begin with.

673
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,940
That is a great idea. Let's do it.

674
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:48,560
How's next week?

675
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:50,110
Let's see here.

676
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:55,820
well,I've got the meeting with
the school board on tuesday.

677
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,860
And the end of the month,I've got that
conference in washington--oh,shoot.

678
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:03,280
I've got the groundbreaking
for the new civic center.

679
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:05,090
dad's birthday.

680
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,780
economic development forum.

681
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:09,890
how about april?

682
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:13,380
I can give you two whole weeks in april.

683
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:19,190
I'll see you later,babe.

684
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,640
Where you going?

685
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,270
To scavo's for a few beers.

686
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,910
Can I come?

687
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,410
- no.
- Why not?

688
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:32,210
Edie,I know you've been through a lot
lately,but I can't hold your hand 24 hours a day.

689
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:37,870
If you want this relationship to
work,you gotta give me some downtime.

690
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:51,090
okay,so I managed to get away from edie.

691
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:53,010
What do you want?

692
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:55,660
To get you away from edie.

693
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,460
oh,come on. You have to remember
your boyfriend joey miller.

694
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,440
You used to chase him
around the jungle gym.

695
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:15,190
Really?

696
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,870
You'd think I would've gone for this
guy with the sexy finger up his nose.

697
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,480
so you don't remember any of
the kids we used to play with?

698
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:23,880
No.

699
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,870
To be honest,I don't remember
anything about living here.

700
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,580
Really?

701
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:35,170
So. what is your earliest memory?

702
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:40,150
I don't know if this is a memory,but.

703
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,800
for years,I've had this creepy dream.

704
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:47,700
I'm really little,

705
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:52,350
and there's a guy in my
room,and he tries to grab me.

706
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:54,890
That is creepy.

707
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:57,850
Have--have
you ever.

708
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:00,220
talked to somebody about it?

709
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,560
You mean like a therapist?

710
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:09,730
my old babysitter suggested
that,but my mom got mad and said no.

711
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:12,800
- Really?
- Yeah.

712
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,910
Then she fired the babysitter.

713
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,670
- susan?
- I'm in here.

714
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:28,020
Uh,your front door was open.

715
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:29,650
No problem.

716
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,810
Um,what's up?

717
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:35,780
First,let me just say this is one of the
more embarrassing moments of my career,

718
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:38,580
and you have every right to hate me.

719
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:41,300
Adam,I have no idea what
you're talking about.

720
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:45,130
Well,your test results came back,and
your estrogen levels are fine.

721
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,650
You're not about to start menopause.

722
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:50,170
Really? that's fantastic!

723
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:53,160
- There's more.
- More?

724
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:56,010
You're pregnant.

725
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:00,710
What? Wh-what did he just say?

726
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,330
I'm pregnant?

727
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:09,100
He said I'm pregnant.

728
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:23,020
I have never been happier.

729
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,350
Well,now I believe you.

730
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:35,210
there you are.

731
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:37,130
I'm sorry.

732
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,460
I got in late last night.
I didn't want to wake you.

733
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:42,230
You don't have to explain.

734
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,000
I trust you.

735
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:46,610
well,good. Yoshould.

736
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:49,500
I just wish you trusted me a bit more.

737
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:51,090
What are you talking about?

738
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:54,430
Why didn't you ever tell me
about your offshore bank account?

739
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,670
What?

740
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:04,580
Well,you know,the one in the cayman
islands with $10 million in it.

741
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:11,360
I miss you when you're gone.

742
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,300
Going through your things makes
me feel like you're with me.

743
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:19,250
Okay,um,I know how this looks.

744
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,680
What did you think I was gonna do?

745
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:22,480
Tell people?

746
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:26,030
Turn you in? Try to get
my little hands on it?

747
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:30,180
I don't care about money,carlos.

748
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:32,780
All I care about is you.

749
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:38,110
That's why this relationship
is going to work.

750
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:42,650
You can trust me with your secrets,

751
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:48,050
just like I can trust
you not to hurt me.

752
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:02,940
there is a certain time of morning.

753
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:06,000
It occurs after kids
have left for school

754
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:09,210
and husbands have headed off for work.

755
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:15,770
It's a time when women think of the secrets
they've been keeping from their friends.

756
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:21,190
and how shocked they would be
if the truth was discovered.

757
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:27,330
and how they'll do everything in their
power to keep that from happening.

758
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:32,690
But what of those lucky women
who have no secrets left to keep?

759
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,450
What do they think about every morning?

760
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,250
Hey!

761
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:42,090
Is something wrong?

762
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,130
It's just.

763
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:47,880
dylan and i used to be best friends.

764
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,040
I mean,we did everything together.

765
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:54,000
I know. She was like a sister to you.

766
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:55,860
Well.

767
00:40:56,570 --> 00:40:59,310
that girl that I've
been hanging out with.

768
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:03,530
and I know this is
gonna sound crazy,but.

769
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:07,080
that's not the same girl.

770
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:18,400
these women spend their mornings
thinking of their neighbors

771
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:22,050
and the secrets.they may be keeping.

772
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:32,860
There you are. I've been calling you.

773
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:44,140
- Is this the room?
- Yes.

774
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:48,390
Dylan's been asking me
if she can move in here.

775
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,170
So let her.

776
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:53,620
You may remember what
happened here,but she can'T.

777
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:55,580
Doesn't matter.

778
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:59,260
- I won't allow it
- hey,you okay?

779
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:03,180
Did we make a mistak coming back here?

780
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:05,840
Did we have a choice?

781
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:13,450
