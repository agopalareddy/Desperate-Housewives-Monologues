1
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,830
You embezzled $10 million?

2
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,130
On a hotel voice mail.

3
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,830
Actually, now it's only about $9.5. It cost me half a mil

4
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:18,830
To hide it from the government and certain other people. Mm.

5
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,330
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

6
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:25,200
If this is Tanaka money, then you had it when we were married?

7
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:28,000
Okay, i can sense where you're going with this.

8
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:31,300
Which also means you had it when we got divorced.

9
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:33,800
Look, if i had told you about it,

10
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:36,800
You'd have taken me to the cleaners. Carlos, we were married.

11
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:39,200
I was entitled to half of everything you embezzled.

12
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:41,600
Look, we're back together now. What does it Matt er?

13
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:44,300
Well, it Matt ers that you lied to me.

14
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:46,000
I can't trust you.

15
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:49,600
Gaby! If i can't trust you, i don't think i can be with you.

16
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,100
Oh, come on!

17
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,400
No, i'm serious. After everything i have been through?

18
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,630
No! No, get out!

19
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,630
Gaby, you should be happy right now.

20
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:01,200
I have millions of dollars, and i want you to be with me.

21
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:04,200
Oh, so you want me to s Lee p with you and take your money.

22
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:07,230
Gee, if that were a job, what would they call it?

23
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:23,060
Thanks, kid.

24
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,460
Bear claw?

25
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,060
Uh, no. Thank you, nick.

26
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:31,400
So, uh, Mike said you had some medical questions for me?

27
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:34,430
Um, yes, the, uh,

28
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:38,400
Genetic counselor, um, wanted to know a couple of things.

29
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,400
Um, i-is there any cancer in your family?

30
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:47,560
No.

31
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,400
Great.

32
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,400
Uh, diabetes?

33
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,300
Wonderful.

34
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:55,830
Who did you kill?

35
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,430
Couldn't have covered this in the car?

36
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,560
I thought she should hear it from you.

37
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:12,730
I killed my boss.

38
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,400
Uh-huh. Okay.

39
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:17,900
He wasn't my boss when i met him.

40
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:20,930
He was just another guy on the loading dock, like me.

41
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,930
A supervisor's job came up,

42
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,430
And, uh, we were both angling for it.

43
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,200
And then arnie-- that was his name--

44
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:31,500
He went to the head of the company

45
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,530
And told him some lies about me,

46
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,400
And he got the job.

47
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:38,130
So you killed him?

48
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,630
No. I stewed about it for a few weeks.

49
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:44,930
I'd see arnie walking around with that smirk,

50
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,200
And, uh, and that tie, and i thought to myself,

51
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:50,960
"you know, arnie, you don't deserve that job.

52
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,960
"you don't deserve that tie,

53
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,230
And you don't deserve to live."

54
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,100
So you killed him?

55
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,030
No. I confronted him.

56
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,630
I said, "arnie, what you did wasn't right."

57
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,130
He just laughed in my face and said, uh,

58
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,630
"what are you gonna do about it?"

59
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,930
Then i killed him.

60
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:17,630
Uh, and how did you...

61
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:21,030
With the tie. I thought it was a nice touch.

62
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:27,900
Well, now you know.

63
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,930
Hey, Adam , Katherine .

64
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,860
Or should i say frankenstein and... Marie antoinette?

65
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,460
Nice.

66
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,460
You came as a self-important queen who lost all her power.

67
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,660
Isn't that a bit on the nose?

68
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,160
Lee making jokes about a queen.

69
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,560
Isn't that a bit ironic?

70
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:20,330
You two look adorable.

71
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,800
And who are you supposed to be?

72
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,960
Cher, the beloved pop diva.

73
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,600
It was my mom's idea.

74
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:30,600
You know, the woman who freaked when she found out i was gay?

75
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:36,860
Oh, my god. Is that Danielle ?

76
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:41,930
I expressly forbade her from coming tonight.

77
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,860
Who does she think she is?

78
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,700
Apparently, you.

79
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,760
Danielle, you're back!

80
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,760
I'm not Danielle .

81
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,060
I am Bree Van De Kamp Hodge .

82
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,030
Oh, no, no, no. No hugs, please.

83
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:01,600
I'm uncomfortable with needless displays of emotion.

84
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,060
Your costume looks great. It's so real.

85
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,430
Ooh! I could swear i felt a kick.

86
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:09,100
You stop that, baby Hodge . We do not kick people,

87
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:11,030
Unless they're servants.

88
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:14,030
Why didn't you tell me she was home?

89
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:17,060
Oh, it's just a quick visit. She's driving back Tom orrow.

90
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,300
To switzerland?

91
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:24,000
Let's go get some cake, dear.

92
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:30,600
What do you think you're doing? Exactly what my mother wants.

93
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:32,730
You did say to be more like you, right?

94
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,330
That's not what i meant, and you know it,

95
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,630
And as for your little imitation of me,

96
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,730
I don't sound anything like that.

97
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:43,800
Danielle? Who are you supposed to be?

98
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:46,300
Really, Karen , i don't think our lord is amused

99
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:48,300
When we make light of witchcraft,

100
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:50,900
And you might use a coaster.

101
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:56,930
Oh, i get it. She's you.

102
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:04,000
I just don't see how he could not feel bad about it.

103
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:07,330
I don't want to talk about this anymore.

104
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:16,130
You know, i expected to meet

105
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,130
A guy that was racked with remorse,

106
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,460
And instead,

107
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,200
I'm looking across the table at this...

108
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:25,830
Person. He's a person.

109
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:29,130
Yeah, an evil person.

110
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,960
No, he's a good guy who did an evil thing.

111
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,460
There's a difference.

112
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,230
Well, i don't see one.

113
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:38,600
Look, he snapped. It happens. People snap. I did.

114
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:40,030
I killed a guy.

115
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,530
You killed a crooked cop who was coming after you.

116
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,160
That's self-defense,

117
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,260
And even so, you regret it, right? Yes, of course.

118
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,800
Well, that's my point. When good people snap,

119
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:52,460
They feel bad about it. Your dad doesn't.

120
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,660
Susan, why are you getting so worked up over this?

121
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,730
I don't know. It just bothers me.

122
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,600
I mean... My god, Mike .

123
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:02,660
He's your dad.

124
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,500
Yeah, i know,

125
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:09,800
And this conversation is exactly why i told you he was dead.

126
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,160
Lynette!

127
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,200
Honey, are you out here?

232
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:01,060
It won't be a problem. Trust me.

233
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,060
Well, you say that now, but once you've held your child

234
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:07,230
And felt that rush of love, well...

235
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,760
It can change you.

236
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,700
Please. I hate this baby.

237
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,700
What has it done but make me fat

238
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,700
And ruin an entire year of my life?

239
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:17,830
I'm just saying, if i were you, i might be feeling--

240
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:21,560
Stop. Who says i have to feel the same things you'd feel?

241
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,660
I'm nothing like you.

242
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,330
You always say that like it's something to be proud of,

243
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,660
But the day i see even a glimmer of myself in you

244
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,260
Is the day that i realize

245
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,930
You've finally started... To grow up.

246
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,000
Well, don't hold your breath.

247
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:38,930
No, on second thought,

248
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,500
Do.

249
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,130
Hello, Gabrielle .

251
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,630
Milton... You scared me.

252
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,230
I thought you were in washington with Victor .

253
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:59,230
I was. I got to the messages first.

254
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:03,060
Oh. You can't leave him, Gabrielle .

255
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,130
Well, if he really wanted me to stay,

256
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:07,730
He would've come here himself, instead of siccing daddy on me.

257
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,730
Oh, Victor hasn't heard the message.

258
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,230
I erased it. Oh, great.

259
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:15,000
Now i have to break up with him all over again.

260
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,000
You know, there's a lot of talk

261
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,000
About Victor running for governor.

262
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:22,230
A divorce on the eve of a campaign could be...

263
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,900
Quite damaging.

264
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:27,700
And you flew all the way here to twist my arm?

265
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:32,030
No, i had something a little more subtle in mind.

266
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:35,660
Milton, there is no amount of money that is--wow!

267
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,930
Yeah. You start tacking on those zeros,

268
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,930
It gets hard to stop.

269
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,700
Hold on.

270
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,630
This check is dated for next year.

271
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,860
Exactly.

272
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,900
If you want this money, you're gonna have

273
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:50,760
To stay married to my son for the next 13 months.

275
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,060
And isn't there an election around that time?

276
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,760
My son is destined for greatness.

277
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,260
He will be governor.

278
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,260
He could be president.

279
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,100
And you're going to make sure

280
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:06,730
He goes straight to the top, aren't you?

281
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:11,230
Sometimes greatness needs a little nudge.

282
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:16,060
What do you mean, there's nothing there?

283
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,560
I'm sorry, ms. Britt.

284
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,000
I checked the number you gave me three times.

285
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:24,400
That offshore account simply doesn't exist.

286
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,960
Where is that $10 million?

287
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,730
What $10 million?

288
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:36,130
Give it a rest, Carlos . You moved that money.

289
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,860
First of all, i deny having any illegal money,

290
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,560
Let alone moving it.

291
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,500
Why are you talking like that?

292
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:45,630
I don't know. I thought you might be wearing a wire.

293
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,000
You're paranoid. You know that?

294
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,130
Well, don't i have reason to be?

295
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,130
And why would you care where the money is,

296
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,930
Unless you were planning on using it against me?

297
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,800
Oh, god. You think you are so clever. Well, you're not.

298
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:01,030
In fact, you--you are the stupidest man i've ever met.

299
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,530
You have no clue who you're dealing with,

300
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,700
But believe me, you're gonna pay

301
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:08,130
For what you've done to me, Carlos .

302
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,130
This game is not over.

303
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,630
Actually, it kinda is,

304
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,530
And if you hadn't noticed...

305
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,730
I won.

306
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,460
Bree.

307
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,300
Lynette, i was just thinking about you.

308
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:32,130
Did you get your test results yet?

309
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,330
Huh? Oh, the p.e.t. Scan. No, not till Tom orrow.

310
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,600
Listen, i need your help. There's a possum in my garden.

311
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,160
Ugh! I hate possums.

312
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,630
Not as much as me. I put out poison, but it ate around it.

313
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:46,160
I got one of those humane traps, but all i trapped was penny.

314
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,100
How can i help?

315
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:50,000
I want a gun.

316
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,360
Really?

317
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,030
I thought you were one of those liberal gun haters.

318
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,030
That was the old Lynette . The new Lynette 

319
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,460
Kills the possums and lets god sort 'em out.

320
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,460
Well, unfortunately, our b Lee ding-heart town council

321
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,860
Forbids us from using live ammo in our own backyards.

322
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,160
Wusses!

323
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,730
I suggest you get an air rifle.

324
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,230
It won't kill it,

325
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,730
But it'll sting it enough to keep it away for good.

326
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,300
Perfect. Where can i get one?

327
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:18,330
Try, um, gun city on route 6 by the baptist church.

328
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,160
Tell them i sent ya,

329
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,160
And they'll give you a nice discount.

330
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,660
Great.

331
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,560
What's so urgent?

332
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,030
Can't say hello to a girl?

333
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,530
Gaby, we had a deal.

334
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,030
We weren't gonna see each other for six months.

335
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,200
Oh, uh, yeah, about that...

336
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:42,230
What if we make it 13?

337
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:47,100
Okay, no, just go with me on this.

338
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:50,800
What i'm about to propose will give us total financial freedom

339
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:55,260
And... Help a conniving billionaire's dream come true.

340
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:58,100
Whoa. What's this for?

341
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,100
Milton lang doesn't want me to leave Victor 

342
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:01,560
Until after he runs for governor.

343
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,160
Once the election's over, ka-ching!

344
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,560
So basically, you're taking money

345
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,900
To s Lee p with a man you don't love.

346
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:13,100
Gee, if that were a job, what would you call it?

347
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:15,930
I don't have to s Lee p with him,

348
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:19,130
Just stay with him for political reasons.

349
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,730
It's basically a modeling fee for a 13-month photo op.

350
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:25,900
Absolutely not.

351
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:29,160
Carlos, you're not working right now,

352
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,160
And you know we'll never be happy if we're broke.

353
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,200
We need this.

354
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,700
What if we didn't?

356
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,030
What if i had some money stashed away?

357
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,360
Okay, remember a few years ago

358
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,400
When i was in business with Tanaka ?

359
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:53,160
I was always afraid that he was gonna double-cross me.

360
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,300
Which he did.

361
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:56,930
But before he did,

362
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,430
I skimmed a little off the top.

363
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:02,300
How much is "a little"?

364
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:04,630
$10 million.

497
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:25,200
Is that for the possum?

498
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:28,160
Yeah.

499
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,530
Now he's playing mind games with me,

500
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,930
But i laid out some halloween candy.

501
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,800
Pretty soon he'll get hungry, and when he does...

502
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:39,100
Trick or treat.

503
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:40,860
Lynette--

505
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:49,000
Shh! Do you hear that?

506
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,700
He's making his move.

507
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:52,700
Lynette, i think you should come inside

508
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:54,730
And lie down for a little while.

509
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,530
No way. He's here, Tom . I can tell.

510
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:02,530
Okay, now--now you're scaring me.

511
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,300
Why?

512
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:05,800
Look at yourself.

513
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:08,830
You've--you've declared jihad on a possum.

514
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,030
This is not a joke, Tom . Something has attacked our home,

515
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:17,530
And when that happens, you don't just stand by--you fight it.

516
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:20,630
Screw this creature that has come into our lives uninvited

517
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,860
And is trying to destroy us.

518
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:28,460
It will not defeat me.

519
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,560
Okay.

520
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:43,400
You do what you need to do.

521
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,200
Thank you.

522
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:01,460
So, Bree , have you, uh, picked a name for the baby yet?

523
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,460
Not yet, but i'm thinking

524
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,460
"you're not good enough" if it's a boy,

525
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,700
And "you'll always disappoint me" if it's a girl.

526
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:16,160
Okay, you made your point. Now go home.

527
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,160
Are you kidding me?

528
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:21,160
Do not test me, young lady,

529
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,660
Or i will drag you out of here myself.

530
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,500
You make a scene? Ha! That's a laugh.

531
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:28,460
What's wrong?

532
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,460
I think my water just broke.

533
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,600
Oh, dear heavenly lord.

535
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,360
What happened to my rug?

536
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,330
Danielle!

537
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,130
We agreed to save that till the end of the night.

538
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,130
The best part of the costume,

539
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,300
And she pops the water balloon when people aren't even looking.

540
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,160
Orson! Andrew!

541
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:01,830
Think we can make it to the hospital?

542
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,330
I don't think so! It's coming.

543
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,800
Okay, everybody, in the house now.

544
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,160
Not on the couch. I just had it reupholstered.

545
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,160
Andrew, take your sister into the kitchen.

546
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,160
Get some towels. Boil some water.

547
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,630
Everything is gonna be fine. I'm a doctor.

548
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:25,500
You're a dentist! What if there are complications?

549
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:28,960
Should an emergency arise, we will simply call an amulet.

550
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,300
A what?

551
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:31,660
Ambulance.

552
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,000
How many rum punches did you have?

553
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:35,800
There was punch in that rum?

554
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:38,330
I am going back to get Adam .

555
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,700
Bree. Bree, what's wng?

556
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:44,700
I need your services as a doctor,

557
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:46,700
But before i tell you what's going on,

558
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:49,700
I need you to promise that what you're about to learn

559
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:52,700
Will be kept in strictest confidence. Does this have anything to do

560
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,700
With the pregnancy you've been faking?

561
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,100
Okay, you're almost there.

562
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:03,900
Danielle, you're doing great. Push, baby, push.

564
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:14,260
Are they home? The lights are on.

565
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,760
Here it comes!

566
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:21,160
If they're not home, then what's that?

567
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,100
Probably just a tape they put on to scare us.

568
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:26,100
Well, you know the rule.

569
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:29,130
If we don't get our treat, they get a trick. Yeah.

570
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,560
Come on.

571
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,730
And... Thank you.

573
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:39,100
Okay.

574
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,730
It's a beautiful baby boy.

576
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,360
How are you feeling?

577
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,160
Tired.

578
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:13,300
Did Adam leave?

579
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:15,330
Uh, yeah, and he promised

580
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,600
That no one would ever know what happened here tonight.

581
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:22,760
That's good, i guess.

582
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,600
Is he okay?

583
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,800
He's perfect.

584
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:37,500
He's, um, he's all cleaned up now,

585
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:40,930
If... If you want to hold him.

586
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:55,000
Yeah.

587
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:29,560
He's so tiny.

588
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,700
He looks just like you did.

589
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:41,100
Do you want to be alone with him?

590
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,860
Do you want me to...

591
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,260
To go?

592
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,930
What should i do?

593
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,700
You should take him.

594
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:58,560
Are you sure?

595
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:07,060
Sweetheart, do you feel like you're making a mistake?

596
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,630
No, it's...

597
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:18,260
The right thing to do for everyone...

598
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:23,930
Especially him.

599
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,760
But you're right.

600
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,930
It's awful.

601
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,000
I'm gonna s Lee p now.

602
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:56,830
Okay, baby.

603
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,760
It's okay, little one.

604
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:12,900
Here we are. Here we go.

605
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:15,000
Yes, here we go.

606
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,860
Susan, hey, it's me.

607
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:29,230
Um, sorry to leave this message on your machine,

608
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:31,500
But can you tell the other girls

609
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:35,060
I'm, uh, going to be by myself for a while?

610
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:38,100
I... Just...

611
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:40,600
Going through some stuff and need to think.

612
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:46,030
Um--oh, god, that's my car ready to take me to the airport,

613
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:48,600
So i'll tell you everything when i get back.

614
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:50,100
Okay? Love you. Bye.

615
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,760
This is nice.

616
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:58,330
I didn't order a stretch, but i'll take it.

618
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,900
Victor.

619
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:03,900
I tried reaching you at the house,

620
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:05,900
But the maid said you'd moved out.

621
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:08,400
I took the next flight home. What's going on?

622
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:11,060
Well, i'm... Sort of leaving you.

623
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:14,530
Well, i guess "sort of" is better than "definitely."

624
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,430
What do i have to do to make it "absolutely not"?

625
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,430
I'll do anything. Just tell me.

626
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:22,460
Victor, it's not that simple. We have major problems,

627
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,460
And you never have time to talk about them, let alone fix 'em.

628
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,400
Well, i guess i better make some time.

629
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:31,000
Let's see.

630
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:33,200
Here's this weekend.

631
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,100
Here's next week.

632
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:39,700
The week after. Look at that. I've got a whole month.

633
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:41,300
You busy?

634
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:43,300
Victor, i know you're only doing this

635
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:45,760
Because a divorce would hurt your run for governor.

636
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:50,260
What if i don't run?

637
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,060
You mean that?

638
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,860
The governor's mansion is my father's dream.

639
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,900
You know what my dream is?

640
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,360
You.

641
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:07,630
Don't run away, Gaby ...

642
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:11,630
And if you do, please, take me with you.

643
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,760
So... Where's Mike ?

644
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,400
At the motel. I slipped out without waking him.

645
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,360
I've been up all night thinking,

646
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,830
And i have something to say to you.

648
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:39,000
I don't believe you.

649
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:42,930
I don't believe that you could kill a man and not regret it.

650
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,500
Why do you care?

651
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:50,460
Because i am carrying a baby that has your genes.

652
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,960
If my doctor told me that there was

653
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,460
Something wrong with this baby-- something physical,

654
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,160
I could handle that.

655
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,660
I would probably even love it more.

656
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:04,460
But if my baby was born without a conscience, without a soul,

657
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,960
I don't know what i would do.

658
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,060
You think i don't have a soul?

659
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:13,000
If you can't feel the tiniest bit of remorse

660
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:16,430
Over taking a human life...

661
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:19,830
No, i don't think you do.

662
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:24,260
If i were to think about what i did,

663
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,360
Really think about it,

664
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,030
Lay awake nights

665
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:31,600
Trying to remember the look on that guy's face

666
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:34,130
When i strangled the life out of him...

667
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,660
Pretty soon, i'd go crazy.

668
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,700
I should go.

669
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:46,130
You know what i do regret?

670
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:50,400
What i did to Mike .

671
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:52,030
What did you do?

672
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:56,530
He was a real popular kid. Everybody liked Mike y.

673
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,900
Then when i got sent away,

674
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:01,900
Suddenly the whole town

675
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:04,730
Just thinks of him as the son of a murderer.

676
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:11,730
He got some pretty serious demons as a result.

677
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:17,100
I'm not sure that kind of darkness

678
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:19,230
Ever truly goes away.

679
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,260
Well, you're wrong.

680
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,600
He's happy.

681
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:25,600
He's got a good job and a wife who loves him

682
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:27,600
And a baby on the way.

683
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:31,600
I had a lot going for me, too, before i threw it all away.

684
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:35,730
Just...

685
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,430
Keep on eye on him.

686
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,560
Edie, if you're looking for Gaby ,

687
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,960
She just left for her yoga class.

688
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,300
Yoga... Is that what she told you?

689
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,030
I'm sorry.

690
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:21,500
I know how angry and humiliated you must feel.

691
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:24,200
But don't take it all out on Gaby .

692
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:25,830
Carlos seduced her.

693
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:28,330
He hated you for taking his wife,

694
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:31,400
So he decided to make a fool out of you.

695
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:41,100
I think he deserves whatever's coming to him, don't you?

696
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:50,330
Hey! Hey! Hey, quiet. She's napping.

697
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,830
Finally. How'd you get her to do that?

698
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:56,730
Oh, i-i made her a margarita. The tequila did the rest.

699
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:04,430
Hmm, it's dr. Rushton.

700
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:06,000
Her oncologist?

702
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,060
Hey, dr. Rushton.

703
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,300
What--what are you doing here?

704
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:18,560
Well...  So much of my job is delivering bad news,

705
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,130
That i really wanted to tell you this in person.

706
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:25,000
Lynette, i got the test results back. You're clean.

707
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,700
Are you sure? Yeah.

708
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:31,730
Oh! Lymph nodes are completely clear. Congratulations.

709
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,000
I knew it. I knew it!

710
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:36,400
Did you hear that? Did you hear that?

711
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:38,400
This is so amazing. I'm gonna go get the kids.

712
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:40,560
Hey, doc, you look like you need a margarita.

713
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,560
And even if you don't, i ain't drinking alone.

714
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:58,330
I'm sorry.

715
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:19,400
There is much to be afraid of in this world,

716
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:23,200
But what we fear has nothing to do

717
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:25,400
With gruesome masks

718
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:28,060
Or plastic spiders

719
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:31,400
Or lifelike monsters.

720
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:34,260
No, it's the thoughts in our head

721
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:37,330
That terrify us the most...

722
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:45,430
What if she comes to regret her decision?

723
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:50,700
What if he really is unhappy?

724
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:57,330
What if the chance for love has passed forever?

725
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:03,830
How do we conquer these terrifying thoughts?

726
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:06,700
We start by reminding ourselves

727
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:09,360
What does not kill us...

728
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,060
Just makes us stronger.
