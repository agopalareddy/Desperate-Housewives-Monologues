1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,800
Previously on...

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,200
<i>The new neighbor...
oh, my god. Katherine.</i>

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,000
<i>Turned out to be
an old friend of Susan's...</i>

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,700
And that pine tree
in the back yard...
it's my pride and joy.

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,200
<i>who had a problem
making new friends.</i>

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,200
Oh, it absolutely kills me to
have to ask you to cut it down.

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,900
<i>Her daughter
couldn't recall the past.</i>

8
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,500
I'm Julie's mom.
Who's Julie again?

9
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,200
Your best friend
when you were little.

10
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,300
<i>But her husband had news for Susan.
You're pregnant.</i>

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,100
<i>Lynette revealed her condition.
I have cancer.</i>

12
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,300
<i>Gaby and Carlos
began a secret affair.</i>

13
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,400
Can you get away tonight?
Are you serious?

14
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,800
<i>And Edie uncovered a secret
of another sort.</i>

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,100
Why didn't you ever tell me

16
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,200
about your offshore
bank account?

17
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,300
The one with $10 million
in it?

18
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,800
<i>(Mary Alice) The great
crime wave hit wisteria lane</i>

19
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,400
<i>on a tuesday afternoon.</i>

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,300
<i>That's when residents found
their barbecues opended...</i>

21
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,400
<i>their clean laundry trampled...</i>

22
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,900
<i>and their skateboards missing.</i>

23
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,000
<i>Naturally,
everyone began to ask</i>

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,900
<i>who could be responsible
for such carnage.</i>

25
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,700
<i>The answer
lay in the home of a neighbor</i>

26
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,700
<i>Who, 20 minutes earlier,
had been engaging in...</i>

27
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,500
<i>an altogether
different type of crime.</i>

28
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,000
Oh, I gotta get back.

29
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,000
I told Edie I was just
going for a jog.

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,800
Do I look sweaty enough
for a 5-mile run?

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,400
Yeah. Unfortunately,
it's my sweat.

32
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,800
Mmm. Mmm.
When are you gonna dump her?

33
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,100
(sighs) It's complicated,
okay?

34
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,000
Besides, I don't see you
in any big hurry

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,300
to dump Victor.

36
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,900
Generally speaking,

37
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,700
women don't leave their husbands
for guys who have girlfriends.

38
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,600
Just boot the bitch.
What are you afraid of?

39
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,000
Hey, I am not afraid of--
(car door shuts in distance)

40
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,100
Oh, my god!

41
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,100
What the hell's
the matter with you?

42
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,700
(lowered voice) Edie!

43
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,700
(Edie) Gaby, you in there?
(whispers) Okay.

44
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,600
(normal voice) One second!

45
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,100
Edie! What brings you here?

46
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm looking for Carlos.
He went for a run,

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,800
but it was hours ago.
Sorry. Haven't seen him.

48
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,100
Really? Because Ida Greenberg
said that she thought

49
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,200
she saw him on your porch.

50
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,000
Uh, that's impossible, because
he's there! There he is!

51
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,300
What?

52
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,600
Carlos!
He's at your house.

53
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,400
Oh, he just let himself in.
Oh.

54
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,900
There you go. He's home.

55
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,500
Okay. Well, thanks.

56
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,600
You told her
I was at home.

57
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,000
So?

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,600
So I'm not at home.
I'm here.

59
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,900
What the hell
am I supposed to do?

60
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,300
Edie! Edie, wait!

61
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,900
Wait, wait, wait!
Don't go!

62
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,400
Don't go!
Why?

63
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:59,700
Uh, you, uh,
have a birthday coming up,

64
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,000
and, uh, I don't know
what to get ya.

65
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,600
Or maybe a coffeepot

66
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,200
Or scented hangers

67
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,700
Or... a nice clock radio.

68
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,300
Gaby, I don't have time
for this.

69
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,400
Why don't you just
surprise me?

70
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,400
Uh, wait, but don't go!
(tires screech)

71
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,500
I-I need a little more guidance!

72
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,900
Damn it, boys! You should not be
screwing around in the streets!

73
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,400
Somebody's gonna get hurt!
(both yelling)

74
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,600
Carlos!

75
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,500
Can you believe this?
Someone broke into our house.

76
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,900
Oh, my god.

77
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,700
<i>And so ended the great
crime wave on wisteria lane.</i>

78
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,200
<i>No one ever found out
who was responsible...</i>

79
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,000
Ew. Honey, you're all sweaty.
Go clean up.

80
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,200
<i>because it was an inside job.</i>

<i>That's why, in the suburbs,

90
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,700
<i>than a smile.</i>

91
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,500
So what did Julie say,
exactly?

92
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,800
She said Dylan's
not the same girl.

93
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,500
Not the same girl
like she's changed,

94
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,500
Or not the same girl because
she's been replaced by a robot?
I know it sounds weird,

95
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,300
but Julie says Dylan
does not remember anything

96
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,100
about living here.

97
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,700
Well,
maybe she blocked it out.

98
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,100
Did something bad happen
to her when she was young?
I'm not sure.

99
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,900
But there was something odd
about the way they left.

100
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,300
So...

101
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,300
If it isn't the early morning
gossip brigade.

102
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,200
Who are we dishing today?
Uh, Susan.

103
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,400
She's standing right there.

104
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,500
Oh, my god. Have you been there
this whole time?

105
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,800
Anyway, I wanted to talk
to you girls about lynette.

106
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,400
What about her?
Well, since she's been
so tired from chemo,

107
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,500
I thought it'd be nice
if we did something for her,

108
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,800
Like bring her lunch?

109
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,500
Uh, that sounds great.
Yeah, let's do it.

110
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,000
Um, Gaby, why don't you bring
your vegetable lasagna?

111
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,100
Susan, you do beverages,

112
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,000
and, uh, Katherine, why don't
you bring a simple green salad?

113
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,400
I'd rather bring dessert.

114
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,600
Oh, no need, dear.
I always bring dessert.

115
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,200
Oh, I'm thinking
my lemon meringue pie.

116
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,100
Oh, yum.

117
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,400
Yeah, here's the thing.
The movers lost my salad bowl.

118
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,100
My pie plates,
on the other hand--

119
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,600
Will not be needed.

120
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,000
As I said,
I always bring dessert.

121
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,500
I know.

122
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,900
I will lend you
my salad bowl.

123
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,600
You really don't wanna miss
bree's pie. It's perfect.

124
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,700
Who am I to argue
with perfection?

125
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,100
Sorry. It's just, something
has been driving me crazy.

126
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,200
Now you're perfect.

127
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,200
D-Does it hurt?

128
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,700
It's a little uncomfortable,
but I'm fine.

129
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,200
Take a card.

130
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,600
Hey, I told you
I'm collecting queens.

131
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,500
Pay attention.

132
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,900
You remember we played this

133
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,500
when you were in labor
with Parker?

134
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,200
42 hours without meds.

135
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,000
I'll never forget
what a trouper you were.

136
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,800
Well, let's not compose
my eulogy just yet.

137
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,900
I'm still troupin'.

138
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,500
Take a card.

139
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,400
Right.

140
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,400
It's funny.

141
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,200
We played cards on our honeymoon
the day that it rained.

142
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,300
Do you remember that?
We--We lit a fire--

143
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,500
You're doing it again.

144
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,400
Sorry.

145
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Hey, I told you
I'm collecting queens.

146
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,600
Shoot. That's right.

147
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,900
<i>Oh, my god.
are you letting me win?</i>

148
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,100
I just wanna make you
feel good.

149
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,600
By taking all the fun
out of the kill?

150
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,200
Honey, I'm sorry.
It's just...

151
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,800
(voice breaking)
I love you so much.

152
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,800
Out.

153
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,800
What?

154
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,000
You are supposed
to be distracting me,

155
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,400
not depressing
the hell out of me.

156
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,800
You're kicking me out
of chemo?

157
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,700
I'll see you at home.

158
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,800
Honey, I'm your ride.

159
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,200
Just go. I'll cab it.

160
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,800
There's that trouper
that I admire so much.

161
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,600
Out!

162
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,100
Carlos! Hi!

163
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,000
Hey,
there's my birthday girl.

164
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,100
Oh. Mmm!

165
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,200
(chuckles)
It's a nice car.

166
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,100
We got company?

167
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,300
No.

168
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,300
Then whose is it?
(chuckles)

169
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,900
It's... your birthday present
to me. Surprise!

170
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,300
A car. I was gonna get you
earrings.

171
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,700
So? Get 'em.

172
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,800
And I will drive around
with the top down

173
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,600
so everyone can see them.

174
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,600
Edie, I can't afford this.

175
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,200
Of course you can.

176
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,300
Just move some of
your offshore money onshore.

177
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,900
I told you,
that account was a secret,

178
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,600
which it's not gonna be
for long

179
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,600
if i start buying
$80,000 cars.

180
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,100
Now I'm sensing that
this little nest egg of yours

181
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,200
is a teensy bit illegal.

182
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,700
Where'd it come from?

183
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,500
You don't need to know that,
the I.R.S. doesn't, either.

184
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,500
You want me to go to jail?

185
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,300
Goodness, Carlos.

186
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,400
I-I had no idea
that your situation was so...

187
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:18,900
precarious.

188
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,600
Well... I guess

189
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,200
I'll just have to take this
back to the dealership.

190
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,400
Thank you for understanding,
babe.

191
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,300
Look, if... (sighs) if you
don't want the earrings,

192
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,100
just pick something else out
instead.

193
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,600
Just not too extravagant.

194
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,200
Don't worry.
I have a thought,

195
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,000
and it's right
in your price range.

196
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,400
Oh! Hi. Hi.

197
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,500
Hey, Katherine.
What's going on?

198
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,600
Why is there a moving van
in your driveway?

199
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,600
Oh, I meant to call you.
I, uh...

200
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:20,000
It's just been so nuts.
I got a new job... in Chicago.

201
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,800
What? You're just leaving,
like that?

202
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,600
I know! It's crazy, huh?

203
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I really wish I had time
to talk,

204
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,200
but i gotta finish packing.
Oh, whoa. No, hang on.

205
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:32,200
Let me just run and get Julie so
she can say good-bye to Dylan.
Oh, we're really in a rush.

206
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,700
I don't think we're gonna
have time--
(glass shatters)

207
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,800
Th-That's okay, guys!
Keep packing! I'll clean it up!

208
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,500
Katherine?

209
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,900
Are you okay?

210
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,500
You seem a little jumpy.

211
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:48,000
I just had a-a long night,
and I-I have a lot to do.

212
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,500
I'm really gonna miss you.

213
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,700
Katherine, hi.

214
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,800
Oh, uh, I brought you
that salad bowl.

215
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,600
Oh, thank you.
You're so thoughtful.

216
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,600
No problem. Hey, you know,
I was meaning to ask you,

217
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,900
How did that job
in Chicago work out?

218
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,100
Job?

219
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,400
You know, the one that
you left so suddenly for.

220
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,400
Oh, right. Yes, of course.
Uh, good.

221
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,200
Uh, it worked out well--
Very challenging.
Oh.

222
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,000
I've got something in the stove.
I've gotta go.

223
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,200
Oh.

224
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,200
Susan.

225
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,800
What?
I'm eating for two.

226
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,300
Well, do both of you
wanna be fat?

227
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,700
Okay, when I'm in labor
and I am pushing and screaming

228
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,300
<i>to bring your child
into the world,</i>

229
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
do you really want me
to remember

230
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,400
that you denied me syrup?

231
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,000
Carry on.

232
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,900
Mom, I need to talk
to you about tonight.

233
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,000
Oh, my god.

234
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,300
Is it about Matt's party?

235
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,800
Yeah. It turns out
it doesn't start until 10:00,

236
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,000
So can I stay out till 1:00?

237
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,000
Well, uh, well, the Johnsons
live right down the road.

238
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,900
Yeah, I guess that's fine.
Thanks.

239
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,500
Whoa, whoa. Is this
the Johnsons over on Crestview?
Yeah.

240
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,200
Yeah, I-I don't think
you should go to that.

241
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,700
Why not?
Well, I've done a couple jobs
at that house,

242
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,800
and they have some
really wild parties.

243
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,700
I don't even wanna tell you what
I've snaked out of that toilet.
Those are his brothers parties.

244
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,900
Matt's not like that.

245
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,300
All 17-year-old guys
are like that.

246
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,300
The only reason my buddies
and I even had parties

247
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,700
was to get girls wasted.
well, I don't drink.

248
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,400
Neither did Missy Taylor,

249
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,300
and fast-forward to her tying
her bra on my car antenna.

250
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,200
I really appreciate
your concern,

251
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,200
But my mom already told me
I could go.

252
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,100
(clicks teeth)
Well, that's true.

253
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,500
just giving my opinion.
it's up to your mom.

254
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,300
Uh, we...

255
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,700
I mean, you both make
a-a good case.

256
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,400
Um... But I think I'm gonna
have to agree with, uh...

257
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,500
and you know I love you both--
Decide.

258
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,500
Mike. I'm going with Mike.
What?

259
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,200
Well, it sounds like this party
could be on the wild side,

260
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,200
and it is starting very late.
This is so unfair.

261
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,400
I'm sorry, honey.

262
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,500
You wanted a decision.
This is my decision.

263
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,600
<i>More syrup?</i>

264
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,300
Missy Taylor?

265
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,500
Carry on.

266
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,800
Look at your little Dylan,
all grown up.

267
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,700
Karen McCluskey.

268
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,500
I babysat you
way back when

269
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,600
you were a biter.

270
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,400
Well,
I hope I didn't hurt you.

271
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,600
Nah, you were a cutie...
But loud.

272
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,300
I remember the racket you used
to make on your tricycle.

273
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,000
I gave your dad hell
for putting that horn on it.

274
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,200
My dad?

275
00:14:59,200 --> 00:14:59,900
Mm-hmm.

276
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,800
How could
you know my dad?

277
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,400
He left
when I was a baby.

278
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,100
Nah, he used to come around
once in a while.

279
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,500
Anyway,
nice to have you back.

280
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,000
Please let me help.

281
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,700
I feel so guilty
just sitting here.

282
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:20,700
Do not move. We want to
pamper you, so please let us.
Thank you.

283
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,600
Hey, so how's
the chemotherapy going?

284
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,300
Oh, no, no. She doesn't
want to talk about that.
I don't mind.

285
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,400
Oh, come on. Let's dig in
to the pie. Looks amazing.

286
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,900
Wow.

287
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,800
Oh, my god. Bree, that is, like,
the best pie you've ever made.

288
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:41,100
Well, thank you. I don't think
I did anything differently.

289
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,000
This is not my pie.

290
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,400
(laughs) Okay,
you caught me. It's mine.

291
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,800
What happened to the pie
that I brought?
Oh, I was a little sneaky,

292
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,700
and I put it in the fridge.
I just wanted you to try mine.

293
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,700
Well, did we
or did we not agree

294
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,200
that I would bring
the dessert?

295
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,600
I know, but everyone says
you're such an amazing baker,

296
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,900
and I was hoping
you would give me some tips

297
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,300
to improve my recipe.

298
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,800
Well, clearly no tips
are needed.

299
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,700
as my friends said,
"best pie ever made."

300
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,300
Well, then perhaps you
shouldn't have said anything.

301
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,400
I would have been happy for
everyone to think it was yours.

302
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,200
So back to chemo--

303
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,700
How's that been?

304
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,100
Yeah, so far...

305
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:44,800
not that bad.

306
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,100
Though I did have to
kick Tom out yesterday.

307
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,200
Why?

308
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,100
He was getting so emotional.

309
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,200
It felt like the last 20 minutes
of "Brian's song."

310
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,600
So... I guess I'm in the market
for a new chemo buddy.

311
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,900
Well, I would be more
than happy to go with you.

312
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,600
Count me in.

313
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,800
I'll sit with you.

314
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,500
I volunteer at the hospital,
so I'll be there anyway.

315
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Oh! My god, you guys.

316
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,700
I'm so touched you're all
willing to do this.

317
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,200
What are friends for?

318
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,200
Gaby?

319
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,800
No cream for me, thanks.

320
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,500
Staged
your lemon meringue pie?

321
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,100
You've gotta be kidding.

322
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,800
I'm not.
That despicable woman

323
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,600
was just supposed to bring
a simple green salad.

324
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,200
She not only brought
a pie--

325
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,500
she hid mine
and served hers.

326
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,500
Well, that's beyond despicable.
That's culinary terrorism.

327
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,900
Oh, it gets worse.
Her pie was better than mine.

328
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,200
(mixer whirring)
Impossible.

329
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,500
It's true.
Everyone thought so.

330
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,300
Even me. Oh, and that
simple green salad--

331
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,200
mache and baby arugula with
duck confit and candied walnuts!

332
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,600
My god, she plays to win.

333
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,200
I have been here for hours
trying to replicate her recipe,

334
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,600
and nothing has
even come close!

335
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,200
Don't be so hard on yourself.
This one's fantastic.

336
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,900
That's hers!

337
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,100
Sorry.

338
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,100
Orson, what am I gonna do?

339
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,600
You might have
to bite the bullet

340
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,200
and ask her for her recipe.

341
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,600
What? Surrender?
Debase myself?

342
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,500
Bree,
it's your signature pie.

343
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,400
You make it for parties,
church suppers, bake sales.

344
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,200
If she's always right there
behind you

345
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,300
with her superior version,
staking out her claim

346
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,300
as fairview's number one
homemaker...

347
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:48,700
she will have stolen
my entire identity.

348
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,100
Well,
I wouldn't go that far.

349
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,300
No, it's true.

350
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,300
The only thing about me
that's special

351
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,400
is what I can do
in the kitchen.

352
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,200
You're right.

353
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,400
I have got
to get that recipe...

354
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,800
by any means necessary.

355
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,900
Hey, Gaby.

356
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,000
Hey, what's up?

357
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,500
Well...
I felt a little weird

358
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,900
about something
that happened at lunch,

359
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,300
and I thought
we should talk about it.

360
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,600
I know. Do you believe
that pie business?

361
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,500
I thought Bree's head
was gonna explode.

362
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,100
(chuckles) Oh, not that.

363
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,100
Okay, I don't know how
to say this,

364
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,500
so I'm just gonna say it.

365
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,800
When everyone was offering
to come with me to chemo--

366
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,700
even Katherine,
who I don't even know,

367
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,000
you sort of clammed up.
What was that about?

368
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,300
Well, it just seemed like people
had it pretty well covered.

369
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,000
Yeah, but between us,

370
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,400
You're the one I really want there.

371
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,800
Out of everyone,
You're the most fun,

372
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,400
and I need that now.

373
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,900
Oh, that's sweet.

374
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,600
But to be honest,
I don't like hospitals.

375
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,700
Nobody likes hospitals.

376
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,600
Unfortunately, that's the place
you have to go

377
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,000
when you're sick,
or your friends are.

378
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,900
<i>You are my friend, right?</i>

379
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,100
What, is this a test
of our friendship?

380
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,400
Yeah... Kinda.

381
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,600
Can I pencil you in?

382
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,400
I can't wait.

383
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,300
(lowered voice) Psst! Come here.

384
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,700
Okay, I'll come there.

385
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,700
Are you still mad at me
about the party?

386
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,600
Oh, you picked up on that,
did you?

387
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,500
Okay, look, I've been
thinking about things, and...

388
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,100
(whispers) Just forget
what I said earlier.

389
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:52,700
(loudly)
You mean I can go?

390
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,700
Shh! Jeez! Ooh,
Mike's in the other room.
You're not gonna tell him?

391
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:00,100
No, and neither are you.
(scoffs) Why are you
walking on eggshells?

392
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,400
You are my mother. You have
every right to override him.
I know.

393
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,100
I just--I think it's sweet
that he worries about you,

394
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,100
and I want him to feel
like he's part

395
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,000
of the decision making
process.

396
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,900
Well, clearly he's not if
you're going behind his back.

397
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,800
Do you wanna go or not?

398
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,000
Yes! Yes, I really wanna
go to the party.

399
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,700
Party? You guys still
talking about that?

400
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,500
(sighs) Can you believe it?

401
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,700
Ugh! Let it go.
You know, Mike and I decided--

402
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,300
no party, and that's final.

403
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,500
Bree.

404
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,000
I hope this isn't
a bad time.

405
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,600
I just wanted to bring you
a housewarming gift.

406
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,700
It's the recipe for
my special mincemeat pie.

407
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,500
It wouldn't be thanksgiving
at my house without it.

408
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,800
Well...
Aren't you thoughtful?

409
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,300
Let me just file this
in my recipe box.

410
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,900
Well, as long as we're
swapping pie recipes,

411
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,400
I would love the one for
your fabulous lemon meringue.

412
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,500
Really? I'm so flattered
you'd ask.

413
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,900
but I don't share that.

414
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,200
Excuse me?

415
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,000
You have to understand--

416
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,300
<i>I experimented for years</i>

417
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,700
before I came up
with my secret ingredient.

418
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,900
Which is what?
Vanilla? Nutmeg? Cardamom?

419
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,700
If I told you, it wouldn't
be a secret anymore.

420
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,100
It would just be
an ingredient.

421
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,000
Well, that, um,
hardly seems neighborly.

422
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,300
After all, I just gave you
the recipe for my mincemeat pie.

423
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,200
Yes, and it's a very good one.
I have the book it came from.

424
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,700
That recipe is not
from a book.

425
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,500
That recipe was handed down
to me from my mother.

426
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,800
Well, unless your mother
was Betty Crocker,

427
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,000
she got it from a book.

428
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,900
Oh, dear.
Now I've upset you.

429
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,500
No. No, I am not upset.

430
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,500
I'm just confused as to why
you seem so determined

431
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,200
to get off
on the wrong foot.

432
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,500
First you bring a pie
to Lynette's,

433
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,100
when I clearly assigned you
the salad--

434
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,400
<i>Now, see,
that's where I'm confused.</i>

435
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,300
Just what, please,
gives you the right

436
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:16,900
to decide who brings what
to a luncheon that I suggested?

437
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,400
Well, it's tradition.

438
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,600
I always organize
our little get-togethers,

439
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,000
and I always bring dessert.

440
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,200
Well, then
how lovely that I'm back

441
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,200
and can shoulder
that burden for you.

442
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,400
Just... give me the recipe!

443
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,400
Sorry. I can't.

444
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,600
I do hope this doesn't
keep us from being friends,

445
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,800
because I like you, Bree.

446
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,800
And I'm sure
if you put your mind to it,

447
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,500
you can come up

448
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,200
with an even better
lemon meringue pie than mine.

449
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:54,200
The trick is finding that
perfect blend of sweet and sour.

450
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,500
Well, you've certainly
mastered that, dear.

451
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,600
So when do I get to see my big surprise?

452
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,600
Wait for it. Wait for it.

453
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,400
Ta-da.

454
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,300
Whoa.

455
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,200
All that syrup went straight to your boobs.

456
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,200
So it's not my imagination.
they're bigger, right?

457
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,800
Uh, yeah.

458
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,900
Especially the right one.

459
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,700
Mike!

460
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,300
Just kidding.
Pick those up and bring 'em over here.

461
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,500
Well, I'd better warn you.

462
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,100
I may have to work the shoulders.

463
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,900
Mmm. Hey.

464
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,100
That thing with Julie and the party this morning...

465
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,000
Mm-hmm?

466
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,400
Thanks for backing me up.

467
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,100
It meant a lot,
and I know it wasn't easy for you.

468
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,400
Uh, yeah, well, you know,
sometimes you gotta hang tough.

469
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,200
Mmm, well,
you did the right thing.

470
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,300
I drove by that house tonight.
Mm-hmm?

471
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,200
That party was out of control.

472
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,400
What?

473
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,400
Yeah, there were kids staggering around drunk...

474
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,500
puking in the gutter,

475
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,100
and then I saw some girls running around topless.

476
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,200
I'm sure the cops will be there any minute.

477
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,600
We need whipped cream.

478
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,000
What?

479
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:16,500
Well

480
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,600
I don't think that
you can have sexy date night without whipped cream.

481
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,000
Can't and won't.

482
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,800
Well, I...
I can go get some.

483
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,900
No, no, you've, uh, worked all day.

484
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,600
You stay here.
I'll go to the store.

485
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,700
Could you get more syrup?

486
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,500
Make a wish.

487
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,000
So I'm dying to see what I got you.

488
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,700
How thoughtful was I?

489
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,100
Very.

490
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,300
Open it.

491
00:25:59,400 --> 00:25:59,700
"Yes!"

492
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,700
Not yet.
I haven't asked the question.

493
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,400
Will you marry me, Carlos Solis?

494
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,300
And you say...

495
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,200
You're proposing?

496
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,500
You said you didn't want to spend too much.

497
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,600
So what's more affordable than a promise?

498
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:24,600
Look, Edie--

499
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,100
I'm doing this for you.

500
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,200
If the I.R.S. gets wind of your...

501
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,900
rainy day fund,

502
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,500
they could make me testify against you.

503
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,100
But if I were your wife...

504
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,700
how are they going to find out?

505
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,400
Oh, honey, people talk--

506
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,600
angry people, disappointed people.

507
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,600
Come on.
Say your line.

508
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,700
It's my birthday.

509
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,600
Fine.

510
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,600
We're engaged.

511
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,000
Oh! Carlos!

512
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,400
I think I'm gonna cry.

513
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,300
Yeah, me, too.

514
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,500
I mean, how weird is that?

515
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,800
My mom always told me that my dad took off

516
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,200
right after I was born.

517
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,500
So did she explain what McCluskey said?

518
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,500
I didn't tell her.

519
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,600
She kinda freaks out anytime I bring him up.

520
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,400
Dylan, you have a right to know about your dad.

521
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,400
You've got to confront her.

522
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,100
Yeah, right.

523
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,100
I could never do that.

524
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,100
She isn't cool like your mom.

525
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,600
Hi. It's my birthday.

526
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,800
Oh, that must mean you're Matt.

527
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,200
I'm Susan Mayer, and I'm--

528
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,100
All righty.

529
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,900
You magnificent bastard!
You actually did it!

530
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,800
It wasn't me,
but happy birthday, man.

531
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,300
Well, it was somebody.
Who cares? Gather 'round, men.

532
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
So you like this music?

533
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,200
Ah, it's fine.

534
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,400
Would somebody just tell me where I can find--

535
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,000
Hey, enough talking.
Just take it off.

536
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,000
We're feeling generous tonight.

537
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,600
Oh, my god!

538
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,600
I'm not a stripper.

539
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,300
You're not?

540
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,900
Is this gonna happen or what?

541
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,300
Boomer, she's not a stripper.

542
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,500
What's with the implants?

543
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,300
I'm pregnant.

544
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,200
That's hot.

545
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,600
Sorry.

546
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,600
Should've known you were Julie's mom.

547
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,800
You're way too gorgeous to be a stripper.

548
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,500
If that's your lame attempt

549
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,500
to keep me from calling your parents...

550
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,800
It worked. Well played.

551
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,300
Excuse me. Oh. Aah!

552
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,700
Uh, uh...

553
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,900
Mom, what are you doing here?

554
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,900
I am taking you home.
This party is out of control.

555
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:53,900
No, it's not.

556
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,400
Well, of course
you don't think it is

557
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,500
because yore knocking back a big cup of...

558
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,200
mmm... orange soda.

559
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,100
I don't believe this.

560
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,700
Well, believe it. We're going.
You, too, Dylan. Come on.

561
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,400
And what are you wearing?

562
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,300
It's embarrassing.

563
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,000
Yeah, well, Boomer likes it.

564
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:23,900
Call me tomorrow.

565
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,900
We'll go to a movie my mom can drag us out of.

566
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,500
Look, I get that you're upset.

567
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,000
No, I'm confused.

568
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,300
First, I can go to the party,

569
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,300
Then I can't because Mike says no.

570
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,200
Then I can, but "don't tell Mike and behave yourself."

571
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,800
So I behave myself,
and you punish me.

572
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,900
Okay, I admit that there's a certain
lack of consistency there.

573
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,600
It's like...

574
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,400
ever since you got married,
I can't win.

575
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,200
Do you think this is easy for me?

576
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,700
Trying to keep peace

577
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,300
between a new husband and a teenage daughter?

578
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,200
You're always putting me in the middle.

579
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,900
Ugh. I don't do that.

580
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:01,700
Please.

581
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,900
Every time you and Mike disagree on something,

582
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,400
you give me the look--
that pitiful face

583
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,800
that says if I don't back you up,

584
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,100
I love the other one more.

585
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,300
I don't expect you to side with me every time.

586
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,500
Just make a decision and stick to it.

587
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,500
And no more lying.

588
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,800
Well, you're right.

589
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,000
I'm an adult, and I need to be
honest about these things,

590
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:25,400
and I will be... starting tomorrow.

591
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,000
Hey.

592
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,100
Look who I picked up coming out of the movies--

593
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,900
A P.G. movie.

594
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,200
Is this the perfect teenager or what?

595
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,500
Oh, the movies, huh?

596
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,200
That's funny.

597
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,400
'Cause one of Julie's friends just called

598
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,000
to make sure she got home from the party.

599
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
She was worried

600
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,100
when she saw you leaving with a stripper.

601
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:51,900
The jig is up, mom.

602
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,500
No, no, we can salvage this.
Just work with me.

603
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,300
I did go to the party.

604
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,200
Mom went behind your back
and told me I could.

605
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,800
But I-I didn't drink or do
anything I shouldn't have.

606
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,700
Glad to hear it,

607
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,600
and, uh,
thanks for your honesty.

608
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,400
You know,
this perfect teenager thing

609
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,400
is really starting to chap my ass.

610
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,500
I'm going to bed.

611
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,900
Please tell me this isn't
gonna be one of those things

612
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,600
where you leave me and I go
screaming down the street.

613
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,500
Why'd you go behind my back?

614
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,700
I'm sorry.

615
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,800
You gotta understand, for so long,

616
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,599
it's just been
Julie and me,

617
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,300
and I've made
all the decisions alone.

618
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,400
You felt so strongly.

619
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,999
It was just an opinion, really.
She's your daughter.

620
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,899
I completely respect
your right

621
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,999
to raise her
however you want.

622
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,400
Thanks.

623
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,300
Now that being said,
this baby is ours.

624
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:50,999
So we'll get to make

625
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,100
all those parenting decisions
together, right?

626
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,800
Right.

627
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,100
So can we go back
to date night?

628
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,400
Only if you work
the shoulders.

629
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,100
Oh.

630
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,300
Mmm.

631
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,100
Gaby, where have you been?

632
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:23,700
You went to the bathroom,
like, half an hour ago.

633
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:23,700
Oh, sorry. I stopped off
to get you some magazines.

634
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,200
"Top ten new hairstyles."

635
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,900
Yeah, well, I'm kinda bald
right now, but thanks.

636
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,600
Why don't I go check
if there are some other ones?

637
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,400
No, no, I don't need magazines.

638
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:38,500
I need you've been bouncing around
since you got here.

639
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,700
So...

640
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,700
How do you like being
the first lady of fairview?
It's good.

641
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,900
Are you cold?
They keep it cold in here.

642
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:52,699
I'm fine.

643
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,000
So tell me something.
When you go to a ribbon cutting,

644
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,800
do you get to keep those
gigantic novelty scissors?

645
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,500
You must be freezing.

646
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,100
You know, I have
the cutest shawl in the car,

647
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,500
so I'm just gonna run out
and get it for you.

648
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:09,400
Boy, you really don't wanna
be here, do ya?

649
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,199
What are you talking about?
I'm trying to help.

650
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,600
Yeah, in any way
that gets you out of this room.

651
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,399
I'm sorry. It's just
hospitals are hard for me.

652
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,099
Yeah, you told me,
but, jeez, Gaby,

653
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,600
Don't you care enough
to make an effort?

654
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,200
You think I don't care?

655
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,200
I get it.
You're uncomfortable.

656
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:36,100
Just go. I'm fine.

657
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,300
I'm fine.

658
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,700
Did I ever tell you
about my father?

659
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,400
He had cancer, too.

660
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,700
Started in the liver,
went into his bones,

661
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,100
and ten months later,
he was dead.

662
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,299
Thanks for
that encouraging story.

663
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,200
I'm not finished.

664
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,599
Those last weeks,

665
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:15,200
every day we thought
we were gonna lose him.

666
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,999
And every day, before I
would go into his room,

667
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,499
my mom would say,
"No tears,

668
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,299
daddy wants to see you
smiling.

669
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,400
If you're gonna cry,
you can't go in."

670
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:30,900
So... On the last night...

671
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:34,300
I sat there
and I watched him die.

672
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,900
His eyes were closed,

673
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,900
but I thought
he could still see me.

674
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,900
So I kept smiling...

675
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,500
all night.

676
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,700
I was 5.

677
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,699
Oh, my god.

678
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,799
But on the plus side,

679
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,500
I made a pretty good career
out of knowing how to smile

680
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,900
when I didn't really feel
like it. (sniffles)

681
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:14,900
But I can't pretend
with you.

682
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:21,600
Not when I'm scared
I'm gonna lose you.

683
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,200
You're not gonna lose me.

684
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,100
You promise?

685
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,600
'Cause if I did...

686
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,900
Then...

687
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,499
(laughs)
God! I'm such a mess.

688
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:41,400
It's okay. Come here.
Let it go. Oh.

689
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,400
(Katherine) Honey?

690
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,100
I'm going to get Adam.
Be right back.

691
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,600
Mom?

692
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,500
Can I talk to you
about something?

693
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,700
Sure. If you don't mind
talking in the car.

694
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,000
<i>Bree Hodge persisted
in her effort</i>

695
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,300
<i>to unlock the secret</i>

696
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:44,000
<i>of Katherine Mayfair's
lemon meringue.</i>

697
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,400
<i>But after
several failed attempts,</i>

698
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,400
<i>it occurred to Bree
that while she might not have</i>

699
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,700
<i>the key
to Katherine's recipe...</i>

700
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,800
<i>she did have the key...</i>

701
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,300
<i>to Katherine's house.</i>

702
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,799
Oh, hey, what's up?
I was doing a little baking,

703
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,700
and I was wondering
if I could borrow something.

704
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,600
Sure. What do you need--
flour, sugar?

705
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,300
You can't believe what
Karen McCluskey tells you.

706
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:04,399
She's an old woman--
practically senile.

707
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,099
She didn't sound senile
to me.

708
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,400
Dylan, maybe this is not
the time, okay?

709
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,499
You said my father
didn't care about me,

710
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,600
but she says he came here.
He wanted to see me.

711
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,800
Why would you not
tell me that?

712
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,899
He's my father.
I deserve to know.

713
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,399
The only thing you need
to know about that man

714
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,100
is he was a monster.

715
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:27,600
I can decide that for myself.
Where is he?

716
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,400
I don't know.

717
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,300
You're lying.
No, she's not.

718
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,399
Yes, she is.

719
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,600
She has been lying to me
my whole life.

720
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:41,600
<i>I'm starting to think
maybe you're the monster.</i>

721
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,499
She can't talk to me
that way,

722
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,000
Not after everything
I've done for her.

723
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,400
Well, maybe that's
the problem.

724
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,200
She doesn't know
what you've done for her.

725
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,700
Nobody does,
and it's gonna stay that way.

726
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:02,499
Are you sure? She's just
gonna keep asking questions.

727
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,600
Then we'd better start
coming up with better lies.

728
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,000
Oh, there you are.

729
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,600
I was wondering
where you'd gone to.

730
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,700
I just let myself
into Katherine's house

731
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,400
to get that recipe.

732
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,100
Well, that seems
a bit extreme.

733
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:40,400
Well, at least
you know her secret now.

734
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,100
Yes, and it has nothing
to do with pie.

735
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,100
Ahh. Here's the thing.

736
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,300
I got a real chance at getting
back together with my ex,

737
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:58,300
but this woman
is standing in my way.

738
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,200
And she knows about the money,
and she's made it clear

739
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,600
that if I leave,
she's gonna blow the whistle.

740
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:09,000
You gotta understand...

741
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,900
I really did care
for Edie,

742
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,500
but I can't let her
ruin my life.

743
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,500
That's where you come in.

744
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,099
You guys, we better behave,

745
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,799
or the nurses
are gonna kick us out.

746
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,700
Hey, it's our chemo party,
and we'll laugh if we want to.

747
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,000
Gaby, this was
a wonderful idea.

748
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,200
I cannot tell you
how much it means to me.

749
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Well, don't get sappy on me.
I won't stand for it.

750
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,300
All right, Susan,
is the camera ready?

751
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,300
Yeah.
Got it.

752
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,300
Okay, once the light
starts blinking,

753
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,400
we've got three seconds,

754
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,000
So, everybody, say, "cheese"
and hold.

755
00:40:59,000 --> 00:40:59,300
Okay.

756
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,100
One, two, three.

757
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,400
(all) Cheese!

758
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:07,500
<i>There is nothing more deceptive
than a smile,</i>

759
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,100
<i>and no one knows this better</i>

760
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:13,500
<i>than the people
who hide behind them.</i>

761
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,600
<i>Some flash their teeth
as a polite warning</i>

762
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,800
<i>to their enemies.</i>

763
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,600
<i>Some put on beaming faces to
keep their tears from falling.</i>

764
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,500
<i>Others wear silly grins
to mask their fear.</i>

765
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,900
Mm!

766
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,700
<i>But then
there is that rare smile</i>

767
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,700
<i>that is actually genuine.</i>

768
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,900
I'll take care of it.

769
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:43,499
<i>It's the smile of a person
who knows his troubles</i>

770
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,600
<i>will soon be over.</i>

771
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:54,800
