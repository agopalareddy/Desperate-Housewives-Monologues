provided by Desperate Housewives...

2
00:00:02,377 --> 00:00:04,880
bree discovered a family secret.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,423
Oh,I'm gonna be sick.

4
00:00:06,465 --> 00:00:09,092
Lynette struggled with chetherapy...

5
00:00:10,052 --> 00:00:12,846
while susan took joy
in being pregnant...

6
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:14,222
I'm eating for two.

7
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:17,184
The biggest obstacle
to carlos and gaby...

8
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:19,519
the I.R.S.Could make
me testify against you.

9
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:22,481
Was the promise edie
forced carlos to make.

10
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:23,565
We're engaged.

11
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:28,028
I really did care for edie,but
I can't let her ruin my life.

12
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:31,990
trevor!Over here!

13
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:36,077
all children  love to play games.

14
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:38,830
But before  they can race their bikes

15
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:40,874
or jump their ropes

16
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:43,418
or toss their frisbees,

17
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:49,174
children understand they must  first convince
their friends  to play along with them.

18
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:52,927
The same is true for adults.

19
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,430
Hi,gaby.It's me.I'm throwing a
party saturday night.Guess what kind?

20
00:00:57,349 --> 00:01:00,101
A charades party?Didn't
you just throw one?

21
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:02,437
No,that was a year ago.

22
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:05,315
Oh.Right.Guess it's
time for another one.

23
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,066
Sure is.Can you come?

24
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,570
Um...sorry.Victor needs me at this...

25
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:13,781
political thing.Damn.Damn.Damn.

26
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:18,119
Aw!You have to come.You're the
best charades player I know.

27
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:21,080
That's sweet.and totally accurate.

28
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:23,916
But I'm really whipped
from the chemo,so...

29
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:27,170
oh,there's my other line.Can
you ask me next time,okay,hon?

30
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:29,213
Okay,bye.

31
00:01:30,214 --> 00:01:31,507
hello?

32
00:01:31,632 --> 00:01:34,427
Oh,hey,bree.Mm,what's up?

33
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:39,474
Well,I stopped by katherine's last night just to get
a recipe,and you'll never believe what I overheard.

34
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,018
She slapped her kid?!No!

35
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:46,189
Yes,and get this... when adam said dylan
was just going to keep asking questions,

36
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:48,399
katherine said... and I quote...

37
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:52,195
"well,we're just gonna
have to find better lies."

38
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,613
oh,hang on.I've got another call.

39
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:57,450
Don't answer it!It's susan.She's
hosting another game night.

40
00:01:57,533 --> 00:02:00,703
Another one? It's time
for an anonymous letter.

41
00:02:00,786 --> 00:02:05,166
- Wait...is katherine going to susan's charade night?
- Probably.Why?

42
00:02:05,249 --> 00:02:07,001
We should go,too.

43
00:02:07,126 --> 00:02:10,296
Get a few drinks in
her,see if she loosens up.

44
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:13,090
Well,I doubt a woman like katherine
is gonna spill her secrets just

45
00:02:13,132 --> 00:02:15,676
- because she's had a little win
- I don't know.

46
00:02:15,801 --> 00:02:19,513
You came out with some interesting
things before you swore off the sauc

47
00:02:19,555 --> 00:02:21,348
well,none that I recall.

48
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:23,851
Didn't you tell me you lost your
virginity in the backseat of a...

49
00:02:23,976 --> 00:02:26,937
point well taken.I'll bring the wine.

50
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:30,816
Susan,good news.We can
come to the party after all.

51
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:33,444
Hey,you know who else you should invite?

52
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:36,322
Yeah,I am feeling much
better,so count me in.

53
00:02:37,656 --> 00:02:40,075
- Will our new neighbor be coming?
- Of course!

54
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,913
I love your charades parties.And I hope you're
inviting that delightful katherine mayfair.

55
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:51,045
So you were pa a very
nice compliment today.

56
00:02:51,128 --> 00:02:52,337
- I was?
- Yes.

57
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:57,885
I am hosting a charades party,and all of my
friends went out their way to insist I invite you.

58
00:02:58,218 --> 00:03:00,345
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

59
00:03:00,429 --> 00:03:04,725
Yes,not all adults  like to play games.

60
00:03:05,058 --> 00:03:08,395
But the ones who do...

61
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,189
play to win.

00:03:22,868 --> 00:03:26,163
Stella wingfield hated to cook.

66
00:03:26,288 --> 00:03:31,042
Still,she spent  that friday
morning  grating cheese...

67
00:03:31,168 --> 00:03:33,545
and greasing a pan...

68
00:03:33,628 --> 00:03:36,673
and laying in macaroni

69
00:03:36,715 --> 00:03:39,718
because her eldest daughter  was sick,

70
00:03:40,218 --> 00:03:44,431
and stella could no longer
sit by and do nothing.

71
00:03:44,556 --> 00:03:47,142
- Lunchtime!
- Oh.No,thanks.

72
00:03:47,267 --> 00:03:51,271
Oh,come on.I made it for you
special.You've gotta keep your streng up.

73
00:03:51,354 --> 00:03:56,776
I appreciate the effort,but I told
you,I can't keep anything down,and F.Y.I.

74
00:03:56,901 --> 00:03:58,820
Mac and cheese is halfway to vomit.

75
00:03:58,945 --> 00:04:01,698
You might as well have given
me a plate of creamed corn.

76
00:04:01,823 --> 00:04:03,908
Aren't you taking the anti-nausea drug?

77
00:04:04,034 --> 00:04:06,119
Yeah,I am taking it.It's just...

78
00:04:06,244 --> 00:04:08,163
not working.

79
00:04:08,997 --> 00:04:10,415
Well,um...

80
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:15,420
I know something that might help
your nausea  and boost your appetite.

81
00:04:15,753 --> 00:04:16,838
Um...

82
00:04:16,921 --> 00:04:20,508
perhaps a little visit
from my old friend...

83
00:04:20,842 --> 00:04:23,428
mary jane?

84
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:27,640
- You're suggesting pot?
- A lot of chemo patients use it.

85
00:04:27,765 --> 00:04:29,809
- Hell,I did.
- Yeah.

86
00:04:29,934 --> 00:04:32,145
Oh,come on.

87
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:35,648
Let mama score you
some kick-ass chronic.

88
00:04:36,441 --> 00:04:39,444
"Kick-ass
chronic"? Uh-huh.

89
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:42,697
You're a grandmother.Shouldn't you
be off somewhere knitting an afghan?

90
00:04:42,739 --> 00:04:45,199
Just trying to ease your pain.

91
00:04:45,324 --> 00:04:50,788
Well,thks,but prefer not to get my
medication from some guy under a bridge.

92
00:04:55,293 --> 00:04:58,296
Suit yourself.

93
00:05:04,427 --> 00:05:06,178
Hey.

94
00:05:06,887 --> 00:05:10,057
- What's this?
-  A crib.

95
00:05:10,141 --> 00:05:12,310
Oh,and look...

96
00:05:12,601 --> 00:05:15,771
safety latch.I figured if
the baby takes after you,

97
00:05:15,771 --> 00:05:17,940
"accident-proof" is key.

98
00:05:17,982 --> 00:05:19,984
Honey,you know,I'm still
in my first trimester.

99
00:05:20,067 --> 00:05:23,404
Um,don't you think it's a
little early to be making cribs?

100
00:05:23,571 --> 00:05:26,365
Early would be painting
it pink or blue.But...

101
00:05:27,783 --> 00:05:30,703
I got both,so we're covered either way.

102
00:05:32,037 --> 00:05:33,372
great.

103
00:05:33,455 --> 00:05:37,167
And whether it's a boy
or a girl,colts fan.

104
00:05:37,251 --> 00:05:39,461
- That's
non-negotiable. - Mm.

105
00:05:39,545 --> 00:05:42,965
Um,bree's home.I'll be right back.

106
00:05:48,012 --> 00:05:49,763
look sharp.It's susan.

107
00:05:49,888 --> 00:05:53,142
God,it's getting harder and
harder to keep her at arm's length.

108
00:05:53,267 --> 00:05:55,018
I never knew she was such a hugger.

109
00:05:55,144 --> 00:05:57,271
- You want me to run interference?
- I'm getting good at props. No,no.

110
00:05:57,438 --> 00:05:59,648
Yeah? Good.

111
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,692
Hey,susan!What's up?

112
00:06:01,817 --> 00:06:02,860
I need a favor.

113
00:06:02,985 --> 00:06:05,487
Um,I remember you mentioning
that you liked your obstetrician.

114
00:06:05,612 --> 00:06:07,322
Can I get his number?

115
00:06:08,532 --> 00:06:10,742
I thought you were using dr.Mayfair.

116
00:06:10,868 --> 00:06:13,370
Yeah,I don't know.It's
getting a little weird.

117
00:06:13,495 --> 00:06:15,289
You know,adam is my neighbor.

118
00:06:15,414 --> 00:06:17,583
But you don't mind
orson being your dentist.

119
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:20,877
Well,that's because I don't
blush when orson says,"open wide."

120
00:06:22,212 --> 00:06:24,881
you know,my O.B.Is all
the way across town.

121
00:06:25,007 --> 00:06:27,134
You just do not want to drive that far.

122
00:06:27,217 --> 00:06:30,637
Oh,well,we could schedule our appointments
together and carpool.You know...

123
00:06:30,762 --> 00:06:33,098
pregnant gals on the road.

124
00:06:33,223 --> 00:06:37,310
it does sound fun,but I don't think
my doctor's taking on any new patients.

125
00:06:37,436 --> 00:06:39,813
Oh,I can talk him into
it.What's his name?

126
00:06:40,647 --> 00:06:44,651
I,uM...don't remember.

127
00:06:44,776 --> 00:06:45,861
You don't remember?

128
00:06:45,986 --> 00:06:49,364
No.You know,I usually
just call him "doctor."

129
00:06:49,698 --> 00:06:52,867
bree,just get me the number.

130
00:07:05,547 --> 00:07:07,590
Ooh.

131
00:07:09,092 --> 00:07:11,177
here you go,but please
don't mention my name.

132
00:07:11,302 --> 00:07:14,722
As I said,you know,he's overbooked,and
I just don't want to get on his bad side.

133
00:07:14,848 --> 00:07:18,685
I'm so excited.Pregnant
gals sharing a doctor!

134
00:07:20,353 --> 00:07:21,855
- ah-choo! -
Oh,bless you.

135
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:27,110
Oh!Sorry,probably just allergies,but,you
know,you don't want to take anchances.

136
00:07:27,735 --> 00:07:30,405
right.

137
00:07:35,827 --> 00:07:38,913
Hey.Can I get a drink?

138
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:41,207
Yeah,sure.

139
00:07:47,422 --> 00:07:49,841
By the way,you missed a spot.

140
00:07:49,966 --> 00:07:51,676
Oh,thanks.

141
00:07:51,801 --> 00:07:53,678
Anytime.

142
00:08:00,184 --> 00:08:02,979
- I'd say the car is clean enough.
- Katherine.

143
00:08:03,187 --> 00:08:05,439
You two seemed awfully friendly.

144
00:08:05,523 --> 00:08:08,150
- Do you know her?
- We said two words.No.

145
00:08:08,276 --> 00:08:10,778
- She criticized my car washing.
- Hmm.It's funny.

146
00:08:10,903 --> 00:08:13,948
When I criticize you,you
don't put on a big,goofy grin.

147
00:08:14,073 --> 00:08:15,658
You really need to stop this.

148
00:08:15,741 --> 00:08:18,327
Given our history,shouldn't
i be saying that to you?

149
00:08:18,452 --> 00:08:20,413
Katherine,I can't just
not speak to women.

150
00:08:20,538 --> 00:08:22,540
I'm a gynecologist,for god's sake.

151
00:08:22,665 --> 00:08:24,750
Yes,I know.

152
00:08:26,377 --> 00:08:29,255
But you don't have to bring
your work home with you.

153
00:08:40,432 --> 00:08:42,226
you leaving already?

154
00:08:42,351 --> 00:08:46,313
Ah,edie asked me to help her
pick out a gift for her sister,

155
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,316
so I gotta swing by the mall.

156
00:08:49,566 --> 00:08:51,735
Whenan I see you next?

157
00:08:52,152 --> 00:08:55,739
Well,victor has a teachers'
union thing on thursday.

158
00:08:55,906 --> 00:08:58,409
Guess I'llee you on thursday.

159
00:08:58,701 --> 00:09:01,578
Carlos,what's happening here?

160
00:09:01,954 --> 00:09:04,540
I mean,with us.Why are
we still sneaking around?

161
00:09:04,873 --> 00:09:07,501
- You know exactly why.
- Oh,come on.

162
00:09:07,626 --> 00:09:11,213
Edie's recovered from her little suicide
attempt.Don't you think it's time to move on?

163
00:09:11,338 --> 00:09:14,591
I've got some things going on,and I need
them to pay off before I can make a move.

164
00:09:14,716 --> 00:09:17,010
Really,I don't have a choice.

165
00:09:17,135 --> 00:09:20,764
Okay,but if you did have a
choice,would it be a hard one?

166
00:09:20,931 --> 00:09:23,976
I mean,it's not like you're
in love with edie,is it?

167
00:09:24,309 --> 00:09:26,228
No,I don't love edie.

168
00:09:26,353 --> 00:09:30,565
And I've got a plan to get her out of my
life forever.Just give me two weeks,okay?

169
00:09:32,859 --> 00:09:36,113
A bracelet's always nice.

170
00:09:38,156 --> 00:09:40,575
For edie's sister.

171
00:09:41,368 --> 00:09:43,995
Good idea.

172
00:10:05,767 --> 00:10:09,020
here's the thing...
my daughter has cancer.

173
00:10:09,145 --> 00:10:14,234
She's so nauseous,she's stopped eating,and I
can't just stand by and watch her waste away.

174
00:10:14,651 --> 00:10:19,364
So I asked around,and people thought
you might be able to get me what I need.

175
00:10:19,906 --> 00:10:22,117
You follow my drift?

176
00:10:22,242 --> 00:10:24,244
Um...yeah.You...

177
00:10:24,369 --> 00:10:26,454
you want me to score you some weed.

178
00:10:26,579 --> 00:10:27,997
The best stuff you can get.

179
00:10:28,122 --> 00:10:31,042
nothing's too good for my little girl.

180
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:38,758
Darling?

181
00:10:38,883 --> 00:10:40,677
What is it?

182
00:10:40,969 --> 00:10:42,804
Well,I don't want you to worry.

183
00:10:42,929 --> 00:10:46,140
I-I just got off the
phone with the convent.

184
00:10:46,224 --> 00:10:49,394
It seems danielle took a little spill.

185
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,646
You're 8 1/2 months pregnant!

186
00:10:51,771 --> 00:10:54,524
What in heaven's name were
you doing roller-blading?

187
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:57,318
I'm bored.All I do is lay around.

188
00:10:57,443 --> 00:10:59,654
In your condition,that's
what you should be doing.

189
00:10:59,737 --> 00:11:02,907
And where on earth did you
get skates in a convent?

190
00:11:03,074 --> 00:11:06,118
I borrowed them from one of
the eating disorder girls.

191
00:11:06,244 --> 00:11:07,995
They have all the good
exercise equipment.

192
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,665
Danielle,what if your reckless
behavior had hurt the baby?

193
00:11:10,748 --> 00:11:13,292
They're going to examine
me.I'm sure the baby's fine.

194
00:11:13,417 --> 00:11:14,961
Yes,and it is going to stay that way

195
00:11:15,086 --> 00:11:18,339
because I have instructed sister
theresa to keep you sequestered

196
00:11:18,464 --> 00:11:20,841
in your room until the baby is born.

197
00:11:20,925 --> 00:11:24,011
What am I supposed to do for fun?
You won't even get me a dvd player.

198
00:11:24,095 --> 00:11:29,642
Well,I was hoping that you could use these
last few wee for reflection and personal growth.

199
00:11:30,267 --> 00:11:32,478
I hate you.

200
00:11:32,812 --> 00:11:35,272
Clearly,it would be time well spent.

201
00:11:41,654 --> 00:11:44,740
- How was the lasagna?
- Why don't you ask it yourself?

202
00:11:44,865 --> 00:11:47,284
- Honey.
- Sorry.

203
00:11:47,409 --> 00:11:50,955
At least eat a little.We need you in
fighting form for charades tonight.

204
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,832
Yeah,about that... I don't
think I'm gonna make it.

205
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:57,628
You have to!You are
the charades assassin.

206
00:11:57,711 --> 00:12:01,799
They still talk about the night that you gueed
"the americanization of emily" in 15 seconds.

207
00:12:01,924 --> 00:12:04,009
12.And that's my point.

208
00:12:04,134 --> 00:12:07,971
I'm undefeated.Why spoil my winning
streak by playing when I'm not up to it?

209
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:11,683
Honey,people...know that you're sick.

210
00:12:11,767 --> 00:12:14,561
They don't expect you to
be at your absolute best.

211
00:12:15,437 --> 00:12:19,942
tom,hair loss and constant
nausea... those are inconveniences.

212
00:12:20,067 --> 00:12:25,072
Losing at charades to susan meyer...
that is just flat-out intolerable.

213
00:12:27,783 --> 00:12:28,617
- hey,andrew.
- Hey.

214
00:12:28,742 --> 00:12:31,954
What's up? Hey,mr.Scavo,um,a
package for lynette's mom

215
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,122
got delivered to our
house by mistake,so...

216
00:12:34,122 --> 00:12:38,669
I've got it,tom.It's a pattern.I'M...

217
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,631
knitting lynette an afghan.

218
00:13:23,254 --> 00:13:25,882
a friend of mine recommended this place.

219
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:30,011
It's not exactly what I expected.

220
00:13:32,222 --> 00:13:34,933
must be one heck of a doctor,though,huh?

221
00:13:35,058 --> 00:13:39,062
I don't know.I just come
here to buy clean urine.

222
00:13:41,564 --> 00:13:44,192
Shoo!Those are only for grown-ups.

223
00:13:44,317 --> 00:13:45,526
Why?

224
00:13:45,652 --> 00:13:48,029
Because that have
special medicine in them.

225
00:13:48,112 --> 00:13:50,615
Like the grown-up iced
tea you always drink?

226
00:13:50,615 --> 00:13:52,075
Similar.

227
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,536
How about some ice cream instead? And
you can watch tv till your eyes fall out.

228
00:13:55,661 --> 00:13:58,498
- Yeah!
- You stay.

229
00:13:59,999 --> 00:14:05,129
Grandma needs a favor,and
you've got justhe face for it.

230
00:14:08,549 --> 00:14:09,759
Wow,sweetie.

231
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:14,096
Those really look delicious,but I
just don't feel like eating right now.

232
00:14:14,096 --> 00:14:15,765
Just one,mom?

233
00:14:15,806 --> 00:14:17,725
I made them special...

234
00:14:17,725 --> 00:14:19,810
Just for you.

235
00:14:31,113 --> 00:14:34,116
This really is delicious.

236
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:42,958
Emergency,you can reach
me on my cell phone.

237
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,586
Or they can just walk across the street.

238
00:14:45,586 --> 00:14:47,880
Have fun,girls. Don't
do anything I would do.

239
00:14:51,383 --> 00:14:53,469
Adam seems really laid-back.

240
00:14:54,511 --> 00:14:56,222
Yeah,he's pretty cool.

241
00:14:57,306 --> 00:15:01,018
Of course,everyone seems
cool compared to robo-mom.

242
00:15:01,936 --> 00:15:03,479
Hey,you never told me.

243
00:15:03,479 --> 00:15:05,856
What happened when you asked
her about your real dad?

244
00:15:05,981 --> 00:15:08,984
She freaked out,just like I thought.

245
00:15:08,984 --> 00:15:11,653
She wouldn't tell me anything.

246
00:15:12,738 --> 00:15:13,989
Well...

247
00:15:13,989 --> 00:15:16,575
There are other ways to find things out.

248
00:15:16,575 --> 00:15:18,494
Does your mom keep any old papers?

249
00:15:18,535 --> 00:15:20,871
You know,letters,diaries?

250
00:15:20,871 --> 00:15:22,831
Not that she shows me.

251
00:15:22,831 --> 00:15:27,961
There's stuff in the storage room
upstairs,but it's locked,so forget about it.

252
00:15:31,548 --> 00:15:33,800
What kind of lock is it?

253
00:15:37,095 --> 00:15:38,096
Oh,come on in.

254
00:15:38,096 --> 00:15:40,223
I was hoping you were susan.

255
00:15:41,058 --> 00:15:41,600
She's not here?

256
00:15:41,642 --> 00:15:43,226
No,and she's not
answering her cell phone.

257
00:15:43,226 --> 00:15:44,061
Where is she?

258
00:15:44,061 --> 00:15:48,607
Well,she had an appointment with this new obstetrician
over on river street,but she should be here by now.

259
00:15:48,607 --> 00:15:51,068
Why would she see a doctor over
there? That's a terrible neighborhood.

260
00:15:51,068 --> 00:15:52,152
- It is?
- Yes.

261
00:15:52,194 --> 00:15:55,363
Don't you remember? That's where they
murdered those two prostitutes last year.

262
00:15:56,531 --> 00:15:58,784
We should help mike with the food.

263
00:15:59,409 --> 00:16:01,161
- Knock,knock.
- we're here.

264
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:05,707
Oh,good! Katherine,I was hoping
we'd get a chance to chat.

265
00:16:05,707 --> 00:16:08,126
Open this now.

266
00:16:09,461 --> 00:16:12,505
Susan's parties are
always such a snoozefest.

267
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:16,176
The only thing people will be miming
is get me the hell out of here.

268
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:18,553
Aren't you a little
overdressed for charades?

269
00:16:18,553 --> 00:16:23,016
Oh,I thought that I'd look
nice,just in case we decided to...

270
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:28,021
Oh,I don't know--
announce our engagement?

271
00:16:28,438 --> 00:16:31,149
We're not announcing anything.

272
00:16:32,734 --> 00:16:34,068
It's susan and mike's party.

273
00:16:34,068 --> 00:16:37,489
I do not want to make it all about us.

274
00:16:37,489 --> 00:16:39,616
You're right,darling.

275
00:16:40,325 --> 00:16:42,452
I may drop a few hints,though.

276
00:16:42,452 --> 00:16:43,995
Edie,let me be clear on this.

277
00:16:43,995 --> 00:16:47,373
You are not to tell anyone
about our engagement,got it?

278
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:48,875
Fine.

279
00:16:48,917 --> 00:16:51,461
I won't say a word.

280
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:08,061
Oh,this is fantastic.

281
00:17:08,102 --> 00:17:09,520
You know edward ferber?

282
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,647
- State senator?
- Yes.

283
00:17:11,689 --> 00:17:15,359
His wife just got picked
up for shoplifting.

284
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,778
Why is that fantastic?

285
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,448
He was making noises about
going against me for governor.

286
00:17:20,489 --> 00:17:23,201
I guess the light-fingered
mrs.Ferber just put an end to that.

287
00:17:23,201 --> 00:17:25,161
Why? It's not like he shoplifted.

288
00:17:25,161 --> 00:17:26,621
It doesn't matter. It's a scandal.

289
00:17:26,621 --> 00:17:28,497
You know what they do to poll numbers.

290
00:17:28,497 --> 00:17:29,165
Oh,that's right.

291
00:17:29,206 --> 00:17:32,960
I was reading about that in
politics is boring magazine.

292
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,630
I'm just glad I don't have to worry
about you pulling crap like that.

293
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:39,300
Yeah,you're lucky.

294
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:43,554
So where's lynette?

295
00:17:43,554 --> 00:17:46,098
She's usually your charades M.V.P.

296
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:50,895
Ah,she wasn't feeling so well,but,uh,you
are still going down,mister.

297
00:17:50,895 --> 00:17:54,732
It's just a game,tom-- a game
you wish you never played.

298
00:17:54,732 --> 00:17:56,358
So much work...

299
00:17:56,567 --> 00:17:58,277
Oh,hi,gaby.

300
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:01,614
Katherine and I were just
talking about the old days.

301
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:05,284
So when you were living with your
aunt,was dylan's father with you?

302
00:18:05,326 --> 00:18:07,328
No,just me and dylan.

303
00:18:07,328 --> 00:18:11,332
Were you widowed or divorced?

304
00:18:11,332 --> 00:18:15,294
Actually,I prefer not to
discuss my first marriage...

305
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:17,212
If you don't mind.

306
00:18:17,671 --> 00:18:20,841
We,we certainly didn't mean to pry.

307
00:18:20,841 --> 00:18:24,094
Let me just tidge that up for you.

308
00:18:24,595 --> 00:18:26,305
Hello,all.

309
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:29,016
Ah,it's so nice to see you.

310
00:18:29,683 --> 00:18:30,767
Some wine?

311
00:18:31,685 --> 00:18:33,478
Oh,no.

312
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:38,066
Oh,my contact slipped.

313
00:18:38,108 --> 00:18:40,485
Edie,is that an engagement ring?

314
00:18:41,278 --> 00:18:43,322
Uh,shoot.

315
00:18:43,697 --> 00:18:45,490
Pretend you didn't see that.

316
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:46,533
I promised my fianc?

317
00:18:46,533 --> 00:18:50,329
That I wouldn't say a word
until the official announcement.

318
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:53,832
Excuse me.

319
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:56,084
Gaby!

320
00:18:56,084 --> 00:18:57,544
Sorry I'm late.

321
00:18:57,586 --> 00:18:59,629
Oh,my god! You made it.

322
00:18:59,629 --> 00:19:01,047
That is such a beautiful dress.

323
00:19:01,047 --> 00:19:03,800
We're gonna have so much fun. You...

324
00:19:04,342 --> 00:19:05,844
Come with me.

325
00:19:07,053 --> 00:19:09,181
- She's got a ring!
- What?

326
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:12,767
Edie--she's wearing a big,honkin'
engagement ring the size of a peach pit.

327
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,269
Hey,I didn't get her a ring!

328
00:19:14,269 --> 00:19:16,730
Oh,so you're not engaged?

329
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:19,649
- Well,see,here's the thing-
- oh,you gotta be kidding me!

330
00:19:19,649 --> 00:19:20,984
- Let me explain!
- No,no,no.

331
00:19:20,984 --> 00:19:24,821
I am done with your explanations,and I am
done with just give me two more weeks,baby.

332
00:19:24,821 --> 00:19:27,157
Whatever games you're
playing,I'm sick of it.

333
00:19:27,198 --> 00:19:28,450
We're through.

334
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:32,370
So you're just gonna go and live
happily ever after with victor,huh?

335
00:19:33,455 --> 00:19:36,207
You think victor's my only option?

336
00:19:36,207 --> 00:19:38,042
Well,I got news for you,carlos.

337
00:19:38,084 --> 00:19:41,629
I can have any guy
I want,because this...

338
00:19:41,629 --> 00:19:44,174
Waits for no man.

339
00:19:51,598 --> 00:19:54,183
You bought yourself an engagement ring?

340
00:19:54,642 --> 00:19:55,977
It's been three days,carlos.

341
00:19:55,977 --> 00:19:57,186
How long was I supposed to wait?

342
00:19:57,186 --> 00:19:59,105
You agreed not to say anything.

343
00:19:59,105 --> 00:20:02,442
Ah,but I didn't agree
not to wear anything.

344
00:20:03,067 --> 00:20:04,360
Don't worry.

345
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,070
It wasn't expensive.

346
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:08,656
You can pay me back later.

347
00:20:08,656 --> 00:20:10,241
Count on it.

348
00:20:10,283 --> 00:20:14,287
And the whole time,I just kept
thinking,this is bree's doctor.

349
00:20:14,287 --> 00:20:15,955
Bree recommended him.

350
00:20:15,997 --> 00:20:17,498
He must be the best.

351
00:20:17,498 --> 00:20:20,668
So I didn't worry when it
was between a needle exchange

352
00:20:20,668 --> 00:20:23,629
And the area's only
transvestite bookstore.

353
00:20:23,629 --> 00:20:27,633
And I ignored that my
shoes stuck to the floor

354
00:20:27,633 --> 00:20:31,012
And there was a cigarette
machine in the waiting room,

355
00:20:31,012 --> 00:20:35,600
But when I saw the ant
traps on his speculum tray,

356
00:20:35,641 --> 00:20:37,768
I thought that you and
i should have a talk.

357
00:20:37,768 --> 00:20:39,603
Oh,susan,I am so sorry,and,of course,

358
00:20:39,645 --> 00:20:42,273
I will pay for the slashed
tire and the stolen cell phone.

359
00:20:42,273 --> 00:20:43,691
That is not the point!

360
00:20:43,691 --> 00:20:48,529
Why would you send me to somebody
who is obviously not your doctor?

361
00:20:49,238 --> 00:20:50,573
I can't tell you.

362
00:20:50,573 --> 00:20:52,283
Why not?

363
00:20:52,616 --> 00:20:54,326
It's private.

364
00:20:54,368 --> 00:20:55,744
You know what else is private?

365
00:20:55,744 --> 00:20:59,874
The parts of me that I'm pretty sure
he snapped with his camera phone.

366
00:21:01,917 --> 00:21:02,877
I have a party to throw.

367
00:21:02,877 --> 00:21:04,962
I will deal with you later.

368
00:21:10,217 --> 00:21:12,886
Look,al,she is totally out of control.

369
00:21:13,387 --> 00:21:15,848
I need her taken care of.

370
00:21:16,807 --> 00:21:19,268
Fine. I'll see what I can do.

371
00:21:20,686 --> 00:21:21,603
I promised my fianc?

372
00:21:21,645 --> 00:21:25,149
That I wouldn't say a word
until the official announcement.

373
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:29,403
Adam,I feel the tag of my dress
sticking out,and I can't reach it.

374
00:21:29,403 --> 00:21:31,613
- Do you mind?
- Oh,sure.

375
00:21:33,407 --> 00:21:34,283
There you go.

376
00:21:35,492 --> 00:21:37,244
I think I got a chill.

377
00:21:37,911 --> 00:21:40,247
Now let me see if I can give you one.

378
00:21:40,247 --> 00:21:41,915
Oh,yeah,it worked.

379
00:21:46,712 --> 00:21:49,464
We haven't been here an hour,and
you're already humiliating me?

380
00:21:49,464 --> 00:21:51,508
Are we really having
this conversation again?

381
00:21:51,508 --> 00:21:53,677
Oh,I guess you learned
nothing from chicago.

382
00:21:53,677 --> 00:21:55,595
For god sake,I was not flirting.

383
00:21:55,595 --> 00:21:57,222
- She asked me to fix her dress.
- Yeah.

384
00:21:57,222 --> 00:21:58,056
I saw your face.

385
00:21:58,056 --> 00:22:00,559
I could tell what a
chore it was for you.

386
00:22:01,017 --> 00:22:03,478
You know what? I think I'm a little
behind you in the alcohol department.

387
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,480
Let me go catch up.

388
00:22:09,484 --> 00:22:10,360
I'm sorry.

389
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:15,615
I,uh,didn't mean to eavesdrop,but you
really shouldn't take this out on adam.

390
00:22:15,949 --> 00:22:20,328
Gabrielle has a little bit of a
reputation,if you know what I mean.

391
00:22:20,954 --> 00:22:23,039
No,I don't.

392
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,375
But I'd certainly like to.

393
00:22:25,709 --> 00:22:28,253
Okay,everybody,let the games begin.

394
00:22:29,004 --> 00:22:31,798
Um,okay. I will be team captain one.

395
00:22:31,798 --> 00:22:33,883
Who wants to be captain number two?

396
00:22:33,883 --> 00:22:35,719
- i'll do it.
- Great.

397
00:22:35,719 --> 00:22:38,888
- okay,you pick first.
- Oh,okay.

398
00:22:39,347 --> 00:22:41,391
I will pick adam.

399
00:22:43,226 --> 00:22:45,019
I pick lynette.

400
00:22:45,478 --> 00:22:46,604
Where's lynette?

401
00:22:46,604 --> 00:22:50,775
Uh,she really wanted to be here
she's just feeling too sick to party.

402
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,990
That's funny,isn't it?

403
00:22:57,031 --> 00:22:59,200
Are you kidding? It's genius.

404
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,828
He's a sponge,but he talks!

405
00:23:04,247 --> 00:23:07,166
Well,looks like somebody
is feeling a little better.

406
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:08,459
Yeah.

407
00:23:08,459 --> 00:23:12,005
I guess that anti-nausea
medicine finally kicked in.

408
00:23:12,588 --> 00:23:14,507
That must be it.

409
00:23:17,677 --> 00:23:19,387
Orson.

410
00:23:19,387 --> 00:23:20,805
Carlos.

411
00:23:21,472 --> 00:23:22,682
Husband in the room?

412
00:23:22,682 --> 00:23:24,934
Honey,I love you,but I wanna win.

413
00:23:27,812 --> 00:23:29,856
You should pick edie.

414
00:23:29,856 --> 00:23:30,982
Why?

415
00:23:30,982 --> 00:23:33,693
The woman just tried to commit
suicide. Don't make her last pick.

416
00:23:33,693 --> 00:23:35,903
- She's still fragile.
- Good point.

417
00:23:35,903 --> 00:23:37,530
Mike!

418
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,490
Yes! Let's get started.

419
00:23:39,532 --> 00:23:40,616
No,no! Wait,wait,wait.

420
00:23:40,616 --> 00:23:41,826
Gaby,you know how it works.

421
00:23:41,826 --> 00:23:43,828
Okay,first,I have to
go over all the signals.

422
00:23:43,828 --> 00:23:48,499
Okay,so,um,this is movie,um,tv...

423
00:23:49,709 --> 00:23:51,293
Where did you learn to do this?

424
00:23:51,293 --> 00:23:55,965
When you live with a mother who constantly
locks herself out,you develop certain skills.

425
00:24:00,428 --> 00:24:01,220
I don't know.

426
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,722
Maybe this is a sign we should stop.

427
00:24:05,474 --> 00:24:08,018
What were you saying about signs?

428
00:24:10,145 --> 00:24:13,774
A whole concept,person,um,let's see.

429
00:24:13,774 --> 00:24:18,445
Shakespeare,book,and then
if you do the signal for book

430
00:24:18,445 --> 00:24:20,656
And you touch your
heart,then that's poem.

431
00:24:20,656 --> 00:24:23,409
Okay,when has anyone ever
used a poem as a clue?

432
00:24:23,409 --> 00:24:24,994
Yeah,come on. Let's play.

433
00:24:24,994 --> 00:24:26,745
Let's play!

434
00:24:26,995 --> 00:24:29,206
Yeah! Let's play!

435
00:24:29,665 --> 00:24:31,625
Hey,honey! You made it.

436
00:24:31,625 --> 00:24:33,752
Dibs on lynette! She's on my team!

437
00:24:33,752 --> 00:24:36,713
That's not fair. She's
like the charades ninja.

438
00:24:36,713 --> 00:24:38,549
That's me! The ninja!

439
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:44,346
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

440
00:24:44,346 --> 00:24:45,722
Okay.

441
00:24:45,764 --> 00:24:47,766
Okay! I'm ready.

442
00:24:51,103 --> 00:24:52,271
Okay,go.

443
00:24:52,271 --> 00:24:53,522
- shoe.
- Sock.

444
00:24:53,522 --> 00:24:54,523
- Working out.
- black.

445
00:24:54,564 --> 00:24:55,857
- sole.
- itch.

446
00:24:55,899 --> 00:24:57,317
- Itch.
- Scratch.

447
00:24:58,318 --> 00:24:59,653
A blister.

448
00:24:59,945 --> 00:25:00,696
Sounds like blister.

449
00:25:00,696 --> 00:25:02,280
- Sister.
- kissed her.

450
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,449
Two mules for sister sara!

451
00:25:05,826 --> 00:25:07,536
Okay,22 seconds.

452
00:25:07,577 --> 00:25:08,662
Lynette,you're up.

453
00:25:08,662 --> 00:25:09,830
Come on,babe.

454
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:10,956
We're 40 seconds down.

455
00:25:10,997 --> 00:25:12,916
We need you to make that time up.

456
00:25:12,916 --> 00:25:15,043
Who do you think you're talking to?

457
00:25:15,043 --> 00:25:16,628
- Right on.
- all right.

458
00:25:19,089 --> 00:25:20,090
Ready?

459
00:25:20,131 --> 00:25:22,884
- Get set...go.
- Okay.

460
00:25:31,393 --> 00:25:33,436
Honey,clock's ticking.

461
00:25:33,478 --> 00:25:34,604
I know.

462
00:25:34,604 --> 00:25:37,023
Just,this is a really hard one.

463
00:25:37,857 --> 00:25:39,150
Okay,come on,come on.
What is--what is it?

464
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:40,318
Is it a book? Is it a movie?

465
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,653
Movie.

466
00:25:41,653 --> 00:25:42,862
It's a western.

467
00:25:42,862 --> 00:25:44,698
- No talking.
- Sorry.

468
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,574
Honey,start with the first word.

469
00:25:46,574 --> 00:25:48,159
How many syllables?

470
00:25:55,041 --> 00:25:56,042
One word.

471
00:25:56,042 --> 00:25:58,795
Sweetie,act it out.
You're really good at that.

472
00:26:01,256 --> 00:26:03,633
Okay,okay. Whole idea.

473
00:26:04,676 --> 00:26:06,135
- Me.
- Edie.

474
00:26:06,177 --> 00:26:07,303
- Woman.
- Blonde.

475
00:26:07,345 --> 00:26:08,596
Bleach!

476
00:26:22,026 --> 00:26:23,194
Hang 'em high?

477
00:26:23,194 --> 00:26:26,030
Yes! Yes!

478
00:26:26,072 --> 00:26:27,865
Yes!

479
00:26:28,074 --> 00:26:31,619
Okay. Well,I think
it's time for a break.

480
00:26:31,619 --> 00:26:33,412
- Good idea.
- Yeah.

481
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,124
You feeling okay? 'Cause you're...

482
00:26:37,166 --> 00:26:38,501
Acting kinda spacey.

483
00:26:38,543 --> 00:26:40,044
Yeah,no,I'm good.

484
00:26:40,044 --> 00:26:43,464
Hey,do you think they
have any grapes or lobster?

485
00:26:43,506 --> 00:26:46,092
Why--why don't I go
get you some coffee,hon?

486
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:48,719
Uh,um,orson?

487
00:26:50,221 --> 00:26:54,183
Hey,um,there's a phone call for you at
the house. Yoshould probably take it.

488
00:27:06,195 --> 00:27:07,696
- Hi.
- Hello.

489
00:27:08,906 --> 00:27:10,074
Oh,tom.

490
00:27:10,074 --> 00:27:12,034
Stella,what-- what
are you doing here?

491
00:27:14,078 --> 00:27:17,873
I made some brownies
earlier,and I just...

492
00:27:17,873 --> 00:27:20,167
Noticed they were missing.

493
00:27:21,126 --> 00:27:24,046
Lynette didn't bring them here,did she?

494
00:27:24,046 --> 00:27:26,256
Why? Is that a problem?

495
00:27:26,298 --> 00:27:28,842
It's like chocolate love.

496
00:27:28,884 --> 00:27:30,928
Okay,wait,wait,wait.
Wait,wait,wait,wait,wait.

497
00:27:30,928 --> 00:27:33,347
Sorry,uh,don't eat those.
Don't eat those.Sorry.

498
00:27:33,389 --> 00:27:34,848
Uh,no!

499
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:36,517
Bad batch. Bad.

500
00:27:36,517 --> 00:27:39,144
Bad,bad,bad. Sorry.

501
00:27:39,645 --> 00:27:41,688
Full of trans fats.

502
00:27:44,274 --> 00:27:45,526
Tom,watch it!

503
00:27:45,526 --> 00:27:47,069
I am sorry.

504
00:27:47,069 --> 00:27:48,111
Oh,here.

505
00:27:48,111 --> 00:27:50,531
- Let me get that.
- Thank you.

506
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:53,367
- Okay.
- It's a little cold.

507
00:27:53,367 --> 00:27:55,244
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

508
00:27:55,827 --> 00:27:58,789
Would it be too much to ask you
to keep your hands off my husband?

509
00:27:58,789 --> 00:28:00,958
What? I spilled my drink on him.

510
00:28:00,958 --> 00:28:03,669
And you're trying to make up
for it by breast-feeding him?

511
00:28:03,669 --> 00:28:05,420
Uh,katherine?

512
00:28:05,462 --> 00:28:07,339
Look,lady,you need to calm down.

513
00:28:07,339 --> 00:28:10,342
You're getting a reputation around
here for having a stick up your ass.

514
00:28:10,342 --> 00:28:13,428
Better that reputation than
the one you're toting around.

515
00:28:13,428 --> 00:28:14,638
What do you mean by that?

516
00:28:14,638 --> 00:28:16,681
Okay,back to charades.

517
00:28:16,681 --> 00:28:17,724
Never mind. Forget it.

518
00:28:17,724 --> 00:28:19,184
Oh,no,no. Tell me.

519
00:28:19,184 --> 00:28:20,769
What's my reputation?

520
00:28:20,769 --> 00:28:23,230
Am I smug and
holier-than-thou?

521
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:25,857
Oh,no,wait. That's you.

522
00:28:25,857 --> 00:28:27,692
Let me be specific.

523
00:28:27,692 --> 00:28:30,362
By reputation,I mean that
you are the kind of woman that

524
00:28:30,362 --> 00:28:34,157
Treats a man like a plaything,whether
it's my husband or let's say...

525
00:28:34,157 --> 00:28:36,618
Your teenage gardener?

526
00:28:44,334 --> 00:28:46,836
Bree saw you slap your daughter.

527
00:28:47,295 --> 00:28:48,922
Excuse me?

528
00:28:48,922 --> 00:28:50,131
Gaby!

529
00:28:50,173 --> 00:28:52,675
Yeah,she asked about her
father and then you smacked her.

530
00:28:52,717 --> 00:28:54,886
Why'd you do that?

531
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:59,557
This is the last thing
that I will ever say to you.

532
00:28:59,557 --> 00:29:04,020
Yes,I lost my temper with dylan,but
her father is a horrible man.

533
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:08,233
I want you to imagine the worst thing
that a father can do to his daughter.

534
00:29:08,233 --> 00:29:11,319
What was I supposed to
tell dylan about that,hmm?

535
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:17,408
I hope that satisfies
everyone's curiosity.

536
00:29:24,749 --> 00:29:27,502
oh,my god.

537
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:30,838
"Hang 'em high" has three syllables.

538
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:39,013
I guess you...saw what
happened down there.

539
00:29:39,347 --> 00:29:40,515
Yep.

540
00:29:42,475 --> 00:29:46,646
Look,it was a long time
ago,and...and it didn't mean anything.

541
00:29:46,646 --> 00:29:48,898
How many people know about this?

542
00:29:49,565 --> 00:29:51,859
Now or before tonight?

543
00:29:54,111 --> 00:29:56,697
- how many?
- Look,I know you're upset.

544
00:29:56,697 --> 00:30:00,326
I'm not upset.I'm just trying
to work out how to spin this.

545
00:30:01,744 --> 00:30:04,246
Clearly,the boy was underage.

546
00:30:04,372 --> 00:30:06,791
Do you think money would shut him up?

547
00:30:07,166 --> 00:30:10,044
Victor,really,I don't
think it's a big deal.

548
00:30:10,127 --> 00:30:13,881
Hmm.That's because you're not me.

549
00:30:21,722 --> 00:30:23,599
Okay,you've got to remember this.

550
00:30:23,724 --> 00:30:25,893
This is bodsworth.You
took him everywhere.

551
00:30:26,018 --> 00:30:28,479
No,I think I'd remember
a bear that ugly.

552
00:30:28,604 --> 00:30:30,356
Well,clearly,it's yours.

553
00:30:30,439 --> 00:30:34,193
Your mom kept it all these
years,and he's here in your old room.

554
00:30:34,318 --> 00:30:37,154
Wait.This was my old room?

555
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:39,823
My mom told me I'm in my
old room down the hall.

556
00:30:39,948 --> 00:30:42,951
No,this was your room.What
are you talking about?

557
00:30:43,035 --> 00:30:45,204
Evening,girls.

558
00:30:46,497 --> 00:30:49,958
Hey.How was the party?

559
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:51,835
It was lovely.

560
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,922
I think your mother would
like you home to help clean up.

561
00:31:06,934 --> 00:31:09,227
I'm sorry,mom.

562
00:31:09,853 --> 00:31:13,273
It's okay,sweetie.

563
00:31:17,444 --> 00:31:20,822
But I don't want you
seeing that girl anymore.

564
00:31:33,084 --> 00:31:35,128
Orson,honey,where have you been?

565
00:31:35,253 --> 00:31:37,631
We got a call from danielle's doctor.

566
00:31:37,714 --> 00:31:40,550
Apparently,her fall caused
a placental abruption,

567
00:31:40,675 --> 00:31:43,219
- where the placenta separates from the uterus.
- Oh,my god.

568
00:31:43,386 --> 00:31:45,972
Now they said not to
panic.There are degrees of this.

569
00:31:46,097 --> 00:31:48,808
They're doing a sonogram,then
they're gonna call us.

570
00:31:48,933 --> 00:31:52,520
I can't wait that long.I
have to be with her.

571
00:31:52,645 --> 00:31:55,440
Okay.I'll get your purse.

572
00:31:58,485 --> 00:32:01,112
What do you think you're
doing? You can't leave yet.

573
00:32:01,112 --> 00:32:03,490
- Something's come up.We'll talk tomorrow.
- No,we'll talk now.

574
00:32:03,531 --> 00:32:07,076
You still owe me an explanation
for that scuzzy gyno you sent me to.

575
00:32:07,202 --> 00:32:10,413
I said I was sorry.For god
sakes,susan,not everything is about you.

576
00:32:14,334 --> 00:32:18,963
Oh,I know this night has been a
complete disaster,but all in all,

577
00:32:19,088 --> 00:32:21,841
it's still your best party ever.

578
00:32:38,065 --> 00:32:39,650
I'm confused.

579
00:32:39,776 --> 00:32:41,569
Ow!Now I'm confused,and my head hurts.

580
00:32:41,652 --> 00:32:44,322
That's for letting edie
think you're engaged.

581
00:32:44,447 --> 00:32:46,908
And the kiss?

582
00:32:47,033 --> 00:32:50,453
When you saw me
flirting,you smashed a glass.

583
00:32:50,578 --> 00:32:54,790
When victor heard I had an affair,he
started crunching poll numbers.

584
00:32:56,417 --> 00:33:01,255
I need a man who cares enough to explode
when he thinks he's gonna lose me.

585
00:33:01,672 --> 00:33:05,801
I don't just love you.I
lovethe way you love me.

586
00:33:08,054 --> 00:33:12,558
- So we're back on?
- See you thursday.

587
00:33:28,616 --> 00:33:31,118
Al,what have you got for me?

588
00:33:31,243 --> 00:33:33,120
I think I found a way
to make this happen,

589
00:33:33,203 --> 00:33:35,998
but it might take a week or
two to line everything up.

590
00:33:36,415 --> 00:33:38,000
Fantastic.

591
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:40,002
I'll call you when it's done.

592
00:33:40,377 --> 00:33:42,254
Shirley?

593
00:33:43,672 --> 00:33:46,258
Can you make some
copies of the britt file?

594
00:33:48,552 --> 00:33:51,263
Al Kanminsky Certified Puhlic Accountant

595
00:33:55,476 --> 00:33:57,895
ah seen gaby?

596
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:00,564
Uh,yeah,in the bathroom upstairs.

597
00:34:00,689 --> 00:34:02,482
Tell me something.

598
00:34:03,192 --> 00:34:08,739
When you found out that kid who you were
paying to mow your lawn was doing your wife,

599
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:11,950
how did you not kill him?

600
00:34:12,075 --> 00:34:15,120
Well,I wanted to at first,but...

601
00:34:15,203 --> 00:34:19,458
hey,we're all human,right?
We gotta forgive and forget.

602
00:34:19,583 --> 00:34:22,961
You're a very understanding man.If
she pulled something like that on me,

603
00:34:23,045 --> 00:34:26,339
yhat guy wouldn't be around for long.

604
00:34:26,715 --> 00:34:30,093
Yeah,but no woman's worth
going to jail for,right?

605
00:34:30,218 --> 00:34:34,139
If you have enough money,it's not
that hard to make someone disappear.

606
00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:41,354
let's go,honey.

607
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:44,024
Night,carlos.

608
00:34:56,995 --> 00:35:00,665
- darling,what are you doing?
- I have to bring this dvd player to danielle.

609
00:35:01,708 --> 00:35:06,337
- Honey,we really have to go.
- It'll just take a few seconds.These damn cords...

610
00:35:06,421 --> 00:35:10,341
- sweetheart,it's a long drive.
- It's the only thing she asked for.

611
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:18,099
yes.Hello?

612
00:35:18,183 --> 00:35:20,268
Hello,doctor.

613
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:22,812
How is she?

614
00:35:26,065 --> 00:35:29,068
- Thank god.
- oh,my god.

615
00:35:29,736 --> 00:35:33,114
It's gonna be okay.

616
00:35:45,126 --> 00:35:48,880
kids are all tucked in.They're
sleeping like angels.

617
00:35:48,963 --> 00:35:51,966
Great.Did you put
quaaludes in their cocoa?

618
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:54,427
Could you check on 'em for me,please?

619
00:35:57,471 --> 00:36:00,141
- So how was the party?
- You drugged me.

620
00:36:00,224 --> 00:36:02,310
Oh.Just a little.

621
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:06,147
What is wrong with you? I
told you,I didn't want any pot.

622
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:09,650
Before you slap me around,let
me ask you something.

623
00:36:10,318 --> 00:36:12,820
Do you feel better?

624
00:36:12,945 --> 00:36:16,866
That's not the point.And what were you
thinking,using my son as a drug mule?

625
00:36:16,991 --> 00:36:19,910
He didn't know what was going on,and why

626
00:36:20,035 --> 00:36:24,039
are you making such a big deal about it?

627
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:28,878
Let me ask you something.Do you
remember what I wore to the junior prom

628
00:36:29,128 --> 00:36:31,422
or what part I hadin the play that year?

629
00:36:31,547 --> 00:36:33,924
Who remembers that stuff?

630
00:36:34,049 --> 00:36:37,052
Parents who weren't stoned.

631
00:36:37,177 --> 00:36:42,808
My whole childhood passed in a blur
because you were medicating yourself...

632
00:36:42,808 --> 00:36:46,937
pot when you were sick,booze when
you weren'T.I am not going to do that.

633
00:36:47,062 --> 00:36:51,275
I wot miss a second of my kids'
lives,not if I can avoid it.

634
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:56,488
Well,I'd say I'm sorry,but I'm not.

635
00:36:57,239 --> 00:36:59,658
You're a mom.

636
00:36:59,908 --> 00:37:03,954
You know,there's nothing worse
than watching your kids suffer,

637
00:37:04,538 --> 00:37:07,082
and seeing you...

638
00:37:07,207 --> 00:37:12,087
act all goofy,watching
that cartoon,well...

639
00:37:12,504 --> 00:37:16,842
it was probably the
high point of my trip.

640
00:37:17,426 --> 00:37:20,053
I get it.

641
00:37:21,388 --> 00:37:24,474
But if you ever pull
something like this again...

642
00:37:24,558 --> 00:37:27,269
- I won'T.
- Okay.

643
00:37:27,602 --> 00:37:30,147
Well...

644
00:37:30,439 --> 00:37:34,192
I think I'll turn in.

645
00:37:34,317 --> 00:37:36,695
- Yenta.
- What?

646
00:37:37,028 --> 00:37:41,700
Junior year,you were yenta
in "fiddler on the roof."

647
00:37:41,825 --> 00:37:44,870
- You remembered.
- Yeah.

648
00:37:44,953 --> 00:37:50,375
There are some performances so
bad,even alcohol can't block them out.

649
00:38:00,635 --> 00:38:02,262
Bree?

650
00:38:04,222 --> 00:38:08,685
Can we call a truce,please?

651
00:38:10,687 --> 00:38:15,900
So you know I'm not
bluffing,um,I brought cake.

652
00:38:17,944 --> 00:38:21,698
I am so sorry that I
snapped at you tonight.

653
00:38:21,739 --> 00:38:23,992
It's okay.

654
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:27,829
I just wanna know what's going on.

655
00:38:27,954 --> 00:38:31,457
Ever since you've been pregnant,there's
been this wall between us.

656
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:34,752
It's like something's
changed,and I don't know why.

657
00:38:35,253 --> 00:38:38,256
Did I do something to offend you?

658
00:38:40,883 --> 00:38:45,513
It's not about you.I've just
been going through some things.

659
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:49,267
Like what? I mean,come on.Just tell me.

660
00:38:49,392 --> 00:38:52,186
We share everything.

661
00:38:52,478 --> 00:38:55,857
Okay.Um...

662
00:38:56,149 --> 00:39:00,027
I haven't told anybody this,but...

663
00:39:02,154 --> 00:39:05,783
it's,uh,about the baby.

664
00:39:07,577 --> 00:39:12,623
- There have been some complications.
- Oh,no.

665
00:39:12,832 --> 00:39:15,209
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah,everything's fine,

666
00:39:15,334 --> 00:39:18,546
but,uh,there was just a time
where I thought I might lose it.

667
00:39:18,671 --> 00:39:20,923
Oh,my god.

668
00:39:21,048 --> 00:39:25,010
And there I was,just bugging you
about your doctor.I am ssorry.

669
00:39:25,136 --> 00:39:27,972
- You should've just told me.
- No,you're pregnant,too.

670
00:39:28,097 --> 00:39:30,349
I'm not gonna tell you
anything that's gonna worry you.

671
00:39:30,432 --> 00:39:33,769
Oh,are you kidding? It's the
first baby I've had in 17 years.

672
00:39:33,894 --> 00:39:36,522
You know,I could not
possibly be more freaked out.

673
00:39:36,647 --> 00:39:40,985
- This morning,I caught mike building a crib.
- No.

674
00:39:41,068 --> 00:39:42,611
- This early?
- Yeah!

675
00:39:42,987 --> 00:39:48,117
I-I wanted to scream.You know,are
you nuts? Do you just wanna jinx it?

676
00:39:48,284 --> 00:39:53,539
This is what we get for having
kids at our age... anxiety,terror.

677
00:39:53,622 --> 00:39:55,374
It's just gonna get worse.

678
00:39:55,499 --> 00:40:00,129
Do you know,when our babies
go to college,we'll be like...

679
00:40:00,254 --> 00:40:02,965
dead?

680
00:40:03,048 --> 00:40:05,884
- If we are lucky
- Mm.

681
00:40:09,012 --> 00:40:10,681
Look at us.

682
00:40:10,806 --> 00:40:14,434
Pregnant gals,eating cake and bitchin'.

683
00:40:14,768 --> 00:40:19,189
- it's kinda nice,huh?
- It really is.

684
00:40:26,571 --> 00:40:29,741
- What are you doing?
- The hospital called.

685
00:40:29,866 --> 00:40:31,702
My aunt's ready to come home.

686
00:40:31,827 --> 00:40:34,538
- And you want her to stay in here?
- Yeah.

687
00:40:35,163 --> 00:40:37,958
I think making this room
off-limits was a mistake.

688
00:40:38,083 --> 00:40:41,253
If I want dylan to
focus on other things,

689
00:40:41,378 --> 00:40:44,339
I really need to make
it less intriguing.

690
00:40:45,257 --> 00:40:48,134
Speaking of intriguing,

691
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:51,179
what were you thinking last night?

692
00:40:51,513 --> 00:40:53,181
- What?
- Come on.

693
00:40:53,265 --> 00:40:57,769
"The worst thing a father could do"?
You realize what people are gonna think.

694
00:40:57,894 --> 00:40:59,437
Yeah.

695
00:40:59,562 --> 00:41:01,856
They're gonna be very uncomfortable,

696
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:05,860
and uncomfortable people
don't ask questions.

697
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:20,166
all children love games.

698
00:41:21,167 --> 00:41:26,339
But children grow up,and then
they find  new games to play.

699
00:41:27,048 --> 00:41:31,970
They pretend to be well  so
their families won't worry.

700
00:41:33,888 --> 00:41:39,018
They lie to their lovers  about
where they go  in the afternoon.

701
00:41:39,143 --> 00:41:41,104
So anyway,that's why it was so great.

702
00:41:41,187 --> 00:41:43,982
- Oh!
- They invent stories to hide

703
00:41:44,107 --> 00:41:46,275
- the truth from their friends.
- I got it,I got it.

704
00:41:46,401 --> 00:41:48,653
Oh,one more.Here you go.

705
00:41:48,778 --> 00:41:50,822
Yes...

706
00:41:50,947 --> 00:41:55,284
everyone has fun playing games

707
00:41:56,035 --> 00:41:59,831
right up until the moment...

708
00:42:00,373 --> 00:42:04,252
Someone gets hurt.
