1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,830
Mrs. mccluskey had reached her limit.

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:07,830
Five kids are tough enough, but your husband makes six,

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,200
And that's where I draw the line.

4
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:15,160
An old friend paid adam a visit.

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,900
Sylvia. aren't you gonna invite me in?

6
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,860
After you ruined my life? I don't think so.

7
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,300
You should've told the truth about us.

8
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,030
Mike got help...

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,360
From an unexpected source.

10
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,260
Victor! victor lashed out...

11
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,400
Come on! get up!

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,700
And carlos and gaby... we need to ask you a few questions.

13
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,200
Sorry. I guess I don't remember anything.

14
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,500
Finally met their match.

15
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,530
I remember everything.

16
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,660
It was supposed to be a beautiful day.

17
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:01,030
Kids should have been playing in the park.

18
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:05,600
Husbands should have been doing their chores.

19
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:09,460
Women should have been tending their flowers.

20
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,330
But at 2:26 that afternoon,

21
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,460
A tornado came to wisteria lane...

22
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,960
Bringing with it...

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,500
Unbelievable...

24
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:26,030
Destruction.

25
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:31,600
No one could have anticipated it...

26
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:35,430
Especially given how the day started.

27
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,930
Sorry. can you say that again?

28
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,760
I don't think I heard you right. carlos and I are back together.

29
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,100
Gaby, you just got married.

30
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:51,130
And some of us gave you very expensive wedding gifts.

31
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,130
Uh, you want the fondue set back? fine.

32
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,130
But don't act like it cost a bundle,

33
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,460
Cause it clearly didn't.

34
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,030
I got you the fondue set.

35
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,800
Oh. right. it's nice.

36
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:05,060
Oh, my god. this is gonna kill edie.

37
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,560
You would think so, but no such luck.

38
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,900
That vindictive hag told victor everything. victor knows?

39
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:14,060
Yeah, and seeing how he's the rich mayor of a small town

40
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:18,030
With various thugs and cops at his disposal,

41
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,460
Carlos and I thought it would be safer

42
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,460
If we got the heck out of dodge.

43
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,630
You're leaving fairview?

44
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,800
Yeah. this afternoon.

45
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:29,960
No.

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,330
You can't be serious.

47
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,200
Look, we'll be back... someday.

48
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:38,200
We just have to wait till this all blows over.

49
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,700
I can't believe this.

50
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:42,700
I know. this is... a lousy way to say good-bye.

51
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:46,600
And I'm sorry, but I don't have a choice.

52
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:49,530
Do you guys have any idea how much I'm gonna miss you?

53
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,100
Hey, you heard the news?

54
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,100
A tornado just hit mount pleasant,

55
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,600
And they think we could get one, too.

56
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:02,300
Y'all better head inside and start getting ready.

57
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:09,600
Um, go. you guys go.

58
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:12,100
Yeah, and--and we don't need to say good-bye anyway,

59
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,760
Cause we're gonna see you real soon.

60
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,860
And everything will be just the way it was.

61
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:21,500
Sadly, this was not to be. oh!

62
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,800
In four short hours,

63
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:27,360
One of these women would lose a husband,

64
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,830
And all of them would lose a friend.

65
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,330
But how could they have known this?

66
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:40,960
It was supposed to be a beautiful day.

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,960
Captioning provided by abc studios and abc, inc.

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,700
And brought to you by ford.

69
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:49,700
Captioned by closed captioning services, inc.

70
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,730
By noon that day,

71
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,960
A tornado watch was in effect on wisteria lane,

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,560
And every one of its residents was preparing for the storm--

73
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,630
Everyone, that is, except gabrielle solis,

74
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:10,900
Who was more concerned about another storm on the horizon.

75
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,930
Mayor lang, recovering from his injuries,

76
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,200
Will reportedly be released from the hospital tomorrow.

77
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,700
Until then, the deputy mayor

78
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,760
Will be coordinating fairview's emergency response

79
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,760
As the city remains on tornado watch.

80
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,760
It has been over 50 years... I turned off the gas

81
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,760
And locked your car in the garage.

82
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,100
I'm gonna go grab my passport from the safe-deposit box

83
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,030
Before they close the bank. ...we should understand is never underestimate

84
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,200
The power of mother nature. what's wrong?

85
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,600
They said victor's getting out of the hospital... tomorrow.

86
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,100
Relax. we're gonna be gone

87
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,100
Before they give him his last sponge bath.

88
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:39,100
And remember, the accountant's dropping off the papers

89
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,860
For my cayman island account. I can't deal with that right now.

90
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,860
i'm packing.

91
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,530
Gaby, those documents give us access to $10 million.

92
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,560
Multitask.

93
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,960
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

94
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,460
I told you just to pack the essentials.

95
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,160
That's what I'm doing.

96
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,060
Is that a boa?

97
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,400
Carlos, if you are taking me somewhere

98
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,400
Where I don't need a boa, then I don't want to go.

99
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,400
Fine. you could be a little bit more sensitive.

100
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,400
I had to say good-bye to my friends today. yes, I'm sorry.

101
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:11,200
And I should probably go over and say something to edie.

102
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,000
Like what?

103
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,730
"rot in hell, you maggoty whore"?

104
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,000
That woman ruined our lives.

105
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,600
If she had kept her mouth shut, we wouldn't be running away.

106
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,860
I know, but I can't help feeling a little guilty.

107
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,860
I mean, do you ever even think about what we did to edie?

108
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,360
Who cares?! thanks to her, I'm giving up my home,

109
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,860
My friends, half my wardrobe.

110
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,200
So do me a favor and never mention her name again

111
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,200
Unless it's followed by the phrase,

112
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,700
"that conniving skank."

113
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,730
Ya think you can do that?

114
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,530
Hey, lynette.

115
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,300
Hi. did you hear they declared a tornado watch?

116
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,630
Scary, huh? yeah, well, don't worry about me.

117
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,460
I'm ready for anything.

118
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,400
It's sweet of you to drop by, though. oh, yeah. well, you're welcome.

119
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,430
Okay.

120
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,230
Um...

121
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,200
Can we stay in your basement?

122
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,460
What?

123
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,460
Well, if this tornado watch gets upgraded to a warning,

124
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,530
We're gonna need a place to wait it out.

125
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,100
Who exactly is "we"?

126
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:18,200
"we"--me, tom, the kids.

127
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:20,700
That family you've come to know and love.

128
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,300
All seven of you?

129
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:23,430
Yeah.

130
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,630
Well, first of all,

131
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,630
I only love four of you.

132
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,160
And second,

133
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,500
No way in hell.

134
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,960
Mrs. mccluskey, please?

135
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,230
It's a small basement, lynette.

136
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,900
I've already invited ida over.

137
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,900
We just wanna play some cards

138
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:41,400
And wait this thing out in peace and quiet.

139
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:44,100
We can be quiet...

140
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,060
Relative to the storm.

141
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,060
Look, there's a shelter over at 3rd and grove.

142
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,060
Why don't you go over there? that's in the middle of skid row.

143
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,960
You think I want my kids around a bunch of winos?

144
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,060
Ida's off the wagon. it's not gonna be much better here.

145
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,700
I am asking you as a friend. please?

146
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:03,960
You're not gonna let this thing go, are you?

147
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,960
Thanks. and don't worry. I'll have a talk with my kids.

148
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,030
I promise they'll keep a lid on the destruction.

149
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,630
Relative to the storm.

150
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,330
Yeah. mm.

151
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,660
Dylan, we're fine. it's just a tornado watch.

152
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,030
No. we paid a lot of money for this class trip,

153
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,530
And I want you to stay and enjoy it.

154
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,030
Tell julie I'll keep an eye on her mom.

155
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,800
Gotta go.

156
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:51,400
What the hell are you doing here?

157
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,530
I just came to talk to adam.

158
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,200
I like your hair long.

159
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,700
This is harassment.

160
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:59,700
I will call the police.

161
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,200
I don't think so.

162
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,200
You'd have to tell them what happened

163
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,860
With me and your husband.

164
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,260
You don't want people knowing about that.

165
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,230
In case you'd forgotten,

166
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,730
Adam wants nothing to do with you.

167
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,930
Oh?

168
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,930
Didn't seem that way yesterday.

169
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,730
He didn't tell you I stopped by?

170
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,160
Uh-oh.

171
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,160
I hope he's not starting to keep things from you...

172
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,530
Again.

173
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,900
Here. I brought you a few things in case there is a tornado.

174
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:40,230
Wow. tape, batteries, a radio.

175
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,230
How'd you know I need this stuff?

176
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,600
An educated guess.

177
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,600
Hey, actually, um, since you're here,

178
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:49,600
I was thinking that maybe it would be a good idea

179
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,430
To tell orson about mike's, you know...

180
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,760
Drug problem.

181
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,760
Good, because I already... told him.

182
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,230
You did? when?

183
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,560
Last week.

184
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,560
I was afraid that mike might go to orson for pills.

185
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,830
I'm sorry, so...

186
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:09,030
Orson already knows about mike?

187
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,800
Did I do something wrong?

188
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:14,260
No. no, you didn't do anything wrong.

189
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,960
Thanks for the supplies.

190
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,730
I don't believe a word you say.

191
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,100
So you still don't think I slept with adam?

192
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:29,330
Of course not. oh, well, let me paint a picture for you.

193
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,930
Me lying in his arms,

194
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,400
Him wondering out loud how he ended up marrying

195
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,360
Such a cold, hard bitch.

196
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,160
Katherine, are you all right?

197
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,700
I-i couldn't help noticing--

198
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,230
Of course you couldn't.

199
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,960
And everything's fine. thank you.

200
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:26,830
Hi there.

201
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,460
I-i don't mean to intrude, but are you all right?

202
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,700
Not really, no.

203
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,260
Would you like a nice cup of tea?

204
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,960
The national weather service has extended the tornado watch

205
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,460
To the tri-county area.

206
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,300
Funnel clouds have been spotted

207
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,300
In the counties of mansfield and webster...

208
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,300
I can't believe you're being so nice.

209
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,030
You don't even know me.

210
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,530
Well, I know katherine, and believe me,

211
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,830
You're not the only person I've seen her reduce to tears.

212
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,830
Did you see her spit on me?

213
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,630
Yes. that was unfortunate.

214
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,560
If you need any antibacterial soap, i--

215
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,300
Nah, I'm good.

216
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:15,960
So, um, why on earth

217
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,300
Would katherine treat you so dreadfully?

218
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:22,660
Oh, she's just mad 'cause her husband's in love with me.

219
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,460
Really?

220
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,500
I was one of his patients back in chicago.

221
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:32,330
From the moment we met,

222
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,930
There was this intense passion.

223
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,960
We tried to fight it, but we couldn't.

224
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,630
Well, you're only human.

225
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,200
I know he's miserable without me,

226
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:47,700
Even though she tries to pretend that they're happy.

227
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:50,700
I mean, you're their neighbor. you think they're happy?

228
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:53,830
Well, they seem... content.

229
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,000
Well, they're not.

230
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,530
It was just an observation.

231
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,800
Yeah, a stupid one.

232
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,330
Okay.

233
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,900
This has been... lovely.

234
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:15,200
We really should, um, do it again sometime.

235
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,830
You think I'm making this up?

236
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,200
We were lovers. I can prove it.

237
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:23,430
He has a snake tattoo on his right shoulder.

238
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,600
I licked it.

239
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:29,100
Be that as it may, I really think you should go now.

240
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:32,960
No one believes me! she has you all brainwashed!

241
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,660
Sylvia, where are you going?

242
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,030
Sylvia, you need to come out of there.

243
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:48,060
Ask adam! he'll tell you the truth! well, adam is not here,

244
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,060
And there is a tornado coming. and as you may have gleaned

245
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,060
From the batteries and bottled water,

246
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,060
That bathroom is where we are planning on riding it out.

247
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,760
So would you please be a dear and come on out?

248
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,630
Go get adam!

249
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,760
And... open wide.

250
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,760
Orson, we need to talk.

251
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,760
Susan. I'm with a patient.

252
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,460
Yeah, I can see that.

253
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,060
Hi. I'm his neighbor. cute shoes.

254
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,960
Why the hell would you give mike drugs? uh...

255
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,030
Mrs. kowalsky...

256
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,100
We're gonna step out for just a moment.

257
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:26,100
No need. I'll be quick.

258
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:27,600
Cause I'm sure you have

259
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,600
A very good reason for giving mike pills

260
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:32,100
When you know that he has a drug problem.

261
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:34,360
So... what is your very good reason?

262
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:41,100
Okay, this may take a while. you might want to spit.

263
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:45,400
Mike was having a lot of pain with his shoulder.

264
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:48,430
Oh, of course, and you know all about shoulder pain...

265
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,100
Being a dentist.

266
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,830
I thought I was helping.

267
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,160
By giving pills to an addict?

268
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,660
Does that sound helpful to you, mrs. kowalsky?

269
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,200
Thank you. finally, some sanity.

270
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:03,200
Susan, you have to leave.

271
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:05,500
Fine.

272
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:07,500
But you know, if I find out

273
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:11,000
That you have given mike so much as a breath mint,

274
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:14,000
Trust me, there is not enough novocaine in this office

275
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:17,200
To numb the pain I will inflict on you.

276
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,730
Hi, miss britt.

277
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,830
You need some bottled water before the storm hits?

278
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,960
Well, thanks, jeremy.

279
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,130
20 bucks.

280
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,460
Hold it.

281
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,460
You are price gouging right before a tornado?

282
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,660
I was just trying to make some money.

283
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,830
You really wanna make some money?

284
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,500
Go hit up gabrielle solis.

285
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:46,160
She hasn't met a price tag she didn't like.

286
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,660
I already tried.

287
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,860
She and mr. solis are moving.

288
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,030
Moving?

289
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:55,060
Yeah. they're loading up their car and everything.

290
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,160
They didn't tell you?

291
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:01,830
Well, they probably didn't want a big emotional scene.

292
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,460
Too bad.

293
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:11,000
Leaves rustling)

294
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,960
What was I supposed to do, mike? leave 'em in your truck?

295
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,960
I'm not gonna sit back and watch you spin out of control.

296
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,230
Out of control? have I ever missed a mortgage payment? what?

297
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,200
Or disappeared for days on end, or o.d.'d in an alley?

298
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,560
No. I go to work every day. I help out around the house.

299
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,900
I take care of you and julie. what's the problem?

300
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:48,100
What's the problem? let's see. you lied to me.

301
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:50,100
Uh, your drug dealer almost dated my daughter.

302
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:52,760
You lied to me some more, and then I find out that you

303
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,760
Hit up my best friend's husband for more pills.

304
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,760
You're blowing this out of proportion.

305
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,730
And you're kind of yelling at me--also a problem.

306
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,160
I'm sorry. I'm in pain.

307
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,460
You might think you have things under control,

308
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,460
But they're only gonna get worse...

309
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,460
And with a baby on the way. I'm sick of explaining myself.

310
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,930
If I need a pill now and then, I'll take one.

311
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,930
So where are they?

312
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,660
I'm serious, susan. give 'em to me. forget it.

313
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,760
Hey, don't walk away from me! susan! let go of me!

314
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,660
Aah! oh!

315
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,760
And we are now getting reports of two more tornadoes

316
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,430
Touching down outside mount pleasant.

317
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,530
We can confirm 6 dead and more than 200 injured,

318
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,060
With the total only expected to rise...

319
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,060
My wife needs to be seen immediately.

320
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,060
She's pregnant. she fell down the stairs.

321
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,560
Any bleeding? uh, no.

322
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,760
Cramping? uh, I think I just twisted my ankle,

323
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,430
But I would like to get checked out anyway. sure,

324
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,930
But for non-emergency cases, it's gonna be a long wait.

325
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,000
Well, she's pregnant. doesn't that make it an emergency?

326
00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:00,000
Sir, I'm sorry. you're just gonna have to wait.

327
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,160
It's okay.

328
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,030
How could you not have told me sylvia was here?

329
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,030
i was trying not to upset you.

330
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,530
Well, you failed.

331
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,530
At least if you had warned me, I wouldn't have been blindsided

332
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,200
When she showed up on our front lawn. I'm sorry.

333
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:16,130
Look, I'll call the police. I'll get a restraining order.

334
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,130
I'll do whatever it takes to get this woman out of our lives.

335
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,830
Bree. hello.

336
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,160
Hi, katherine.

337
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,400
Could I borrow adam for a second?

338
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:37,130
I have a... situation on my hands.

339
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,300
She's over there, first door on the left,

340
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,830
And please hurry.

341
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,760
What is she doing there in the first place?

342
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,760
I saw her weeping. I wanted to help.

343
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,430
You wanted dirt, and I'll bet she told you plenty.

344
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,560
I can't help having a sympathetic face.

345
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,400
Sylvia? I need you to come out here, okay?

346
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,560
Adam?

347
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,160
Is that you, darling?

348
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,330
Don't call him that!

349
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,560
Katherine?! I'm not coming out if she's here!

350
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,560
I'm not leaving you alone with my husband.

351
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,560
Just come out! I'll get rid of her!

352
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,900
Ladies.

353
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:33,000
So what'd she tell you?

354
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,560
That she had an affair with adam.

355
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,130
Well, she didn't.

356
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,460
She was his patient--

357
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,900
A pathetic, lonely woman.

358
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:50,800
One day, for no other reason than sheer pity,

359
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,330
He gave her a little kiss.

360
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,100
Sylvia took this to mean that they were in love.

361
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:59,260
And when adam told her otherwise,

362
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,760
She had a breakdown

363
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,930
And accused him of sexual assault.

364
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,230
Oh, my god.

365
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,900
What did you do?

366
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:10,360
We settled out of court.

367
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,360
I wanted to fight it,

368
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,430
But adam was afraid of losing his license.

369
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,430
Of course, we lost everything else--

370
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:21,030
Our home, our...  savings

371
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,500
And our friends.

372
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:26,630
So this is why you moved back to fairview?

373
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:29,760
It was supposed to be our fresh start.

374
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:36,030
So...

375
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,700
Now you know our dirty little secret.

376
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:42,830
Well, katherine, for what it's worth...

377
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:46,600
I would've spit in her face, too.

378
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:57,360
What's that noise? is... is that the tornado?

379
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,230
Worse. it's the scavos.

380
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,900
Hey, we're here! I know!

381
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:07,500
All right, guys. come on. stake out your places.

382
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:11,500
This is our spot! we called it! you can't call a spot this soon!

383
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:14,500
Can so!

384
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:16,000
Ow, my head!

385
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:19,000
Loud banging)

386
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,360
Lynette? I'm begging.

387
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,330
Oh. sorry. kinda get used to it.

388
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,330
Come here. give that to mama.

389
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,560
Hey, guys? come on now.

390
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,860
Knock it off. here you go.

391
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,700
And... first base, second base, third base, sit.

392
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:39,260
We gonna have a nice, quiet tornado watch,

393
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:42,530
And nobody's gonna cause any problems. is there a cat here?

394
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,700
Oh, yes. I brought toby.

395
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,500
Is something wrong?

396
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:52,830
I didn't realize there'd be a cat.

397
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,500
Tom's really allergic.

398
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:56,230
It sets off my asthma.

399
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,430
Ida, is there any chance

400
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:01,230
That we could put little toby upstairs?

401
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,830
Upstairs?

402
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:07,430
Yeah. he'd be very safe. we could put him in a closet.

403
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,760
Sure.

404
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,130
Why don't we put penny with him, since it's safe?

405
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,730
What?

406
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,400
Toby is ida's baby, lynette.

407
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:20,230
No, toby's an animal, and my husband, a human being,

408
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,730
Will get very sick if he stays down here,

409
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,900
So, please, put the cat upstairs.

410
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:27,060
Look, I invited ida to come here.

411
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,060
You, I'm doing a favor for.

412
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,060
If you're not happy with the accommodations,

413
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,260
You're free to leave.

414
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,260
Hey, I'll just stay over here.

415
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,260
May--maybe it won't get any worse.

416
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,860
No, that's ridiculous.

417
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,660
Karen, come on.

418
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,700
Sorry. the cat stays.

419
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:52,700
Knock yourself out.

420
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,230
Start him on i.v. I'll be with you in one minute!

421
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:02,630
Are you okay? yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I'm just worried about you.

422
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:05,130
How long are they gonna keep us waitin'?

423
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,960
Are you sure that's all it is?

424
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,460
Hey! hey, we were here way before these people.

425
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,930
Sir, they're seeing everyone on an emergency basis.

426
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,500
This woman is hemorrhaging. danny, can you take her in?

427
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:19,300
What, you gotta see blood before you'll treat somebody?

428
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:23,000
My wife's pregnant, and she fell down a flight of stairs. I'm sorry,

429
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:23,000
but I'm gonna have to ask you to be patient.

430
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:27,000
These people are bleeding. I can absolutely wait.

431
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:27,000
i'm just asking them to take a look at you, okay?

432
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:29,760
Hell, you could've done it while you're standing here

433
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,360
Talking to me, right? sir, we'll get to your wife as soon as we can.

434
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,500
Now please take a seat. just take a look at her!

435
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:37,530
Get the hell off of me! mike, stop!

436
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,860
Whoa! uhh! I need security here now.

437
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,900
Hey, we need help here!

438
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,830
Dr. roth, blood lab 7.

439
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:51,560
Dr. roth, blood lab 7.

440
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,430
Hey.

441
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,900
When you gonna let me out of these things?

442
00:22:56,930 --> 00:23:00,160
When your wife's done and you're ready to go home.

443
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:07,960
The doctor said the baby's fine.

444
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,460
Oh, thank god.

445
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,000
Yeah.

446
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:16,160
And, uh, your ankle?

447
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,360
Just a mild sprain.

448
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,930
How you doing?

449
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,260
I've had better days.

450
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:38,230
I am so sorry.

451
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,030
It's gonna be okay.

452
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,800
I talked to the doctor, and, um,

453
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:52,600
They have a rehab facility they work with.

454
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:55,160
Thanks.

455
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,430
I don't need rehab. I can kick this myself.

456
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,430
I've done it before.

457
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:05,200
You keep saying that, and it just keeps getting worse.

458
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:07,030
Susan, look at me.

459
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:10,100
I'm handcuffed to a chair.

460
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:12,300
I think I've hit bottom here.

461
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,100
I will fix this.

462
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:19,800
Just no rehab.

463
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,300
Mrs. delfino?

464
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:27,500
The doctor asked me to give you these, for the pain.

465
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:41,560
Oh, my god. are you kidding me?

466
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,760
I've kind of had a rough day here.

467
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:47,860
No.

468
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,860
Susan...

469
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:54,200
I've just gotta get through this.

470
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:05,730
No.

471
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,230
There's no tomorrow. it's now.

472
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,230
You will quit this now.

473
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:14,830
You will go to rehab, or so help me, I will leave you.

474
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:21,160
I will take this baby, and I will leave you.

475
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,960
You win.

476
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:32,400
I'll go.

477
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,800
Wind chimes ringing)

478
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:57,930
Gabrielle?!

479
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,300
Excuse me?

480
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:01,660
Sorry. I'm in a rush.

481
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,660
My wife's alone with the kids,

482
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,160
And I have to get home before the storm hits.

483
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,230
This is the information carlos asked for.

484
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,230
About what?

485
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,600
About the cayman island account.

486
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:15,200
Didn't he tell you I was coming?

487
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:17,200
Yeah, of course he did.

488
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:19,300
Uh, he said you'd be stopping by.

489
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:21,130
Duh.

490
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,430
This is everything you need to access the money.

491
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,930
I washed my hands of this, so whatever you do,

492
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,960
Don't lose that folder. got it? believe me,

493
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,960
i won't let it out of my sight.

494
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,460
All right. nice to finally meet you, gabrielle.

495
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,030
You're just as pretty as carlos said you were.

496
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,700
Oh, no.

497
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:39,060
I'm prettier.

498
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,260
Edie, what have you got there?!

499
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:10,060
Oh, crap!

500
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:13,700
Residents are advised to seek shelter at once.

501
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:15,400
Again, do not evacuate.

502
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:18,400
Stay where you are and seek shelter in a basement

503
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:20,230
Or any windowless room.

504
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,530
You okay?

505
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,860
My throat is closing up. I think I gotta go upstairs.

506
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,730
No. no, no, no, no, no.

507
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:41,300
You stay here.

508
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:03,260
Edie, you thief! open this door now!

509
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,930
I've called the police!

510
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,460
They're on their way,

511
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,660
And they are going to taser your ass!

512
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,860
Oh!

513
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,030
Gaby?

514
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,660
Oh, good. you're home.

515
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:45,230
Lynette! what--

516
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,400
What the hell did I tell you?!

517
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:49,800
I'm not gonna sit and watch my husband suffocate.

518
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:52,500
Well, I don't want ida to wake up and find her cat missing.

519
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,730
Karen, after all our years of friendship,

520
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,230
How can you choose a cat over my husband?

521
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,900
You think we're friends?

522
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:00,130
Of course.

523
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,830
Really?

524
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:05,230
You ever stop by just to say hi or invite me for a cup of tea?

525
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,560
Ida does. what are you talking about?

526
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,500
I had you over for lemonade last week. while I was drinking it,

527
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:12,530
You went to the store, and I watched the kids.

528
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,760
Face it. the only time we're friends

529
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,460
Is when you need something. that is not true. I genuinely care about you.

530
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,460
You mean like today, when you came by to check on me?

531
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,300
Oh, that's right, you only wanted a basement,

532
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,700
Oh!

533
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:29,030
Damn it, toby!

534
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,460
Hey, hold it! hold it! you can't go out there!

535
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,600
That stupid cat is the only family that ida's got!

536
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:37,060
Now this is what friends do! karen!

537
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:49,060
Give me the damn folder, edie! not gonna happen!

538
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:52,460
It's worthless to you! oh! you and carlos

539
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,660
Are screwed without it, and that is worth a lot to me. give me my money!

540
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,760
Ah!  your money?

541
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,800
Carlos embezzled it.

542
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:02,030
Oh, now you're moral all of a sudden?

543
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:04,030
You didn't care where the money was coming from

544
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:06,530
When you thought carlos was gonna spend it on you!

545
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,460
Okay, I'm not unreasonable.

546
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,960
Cut me in for, say, 60%, and I'll go away.

547
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,600
How's that sound?

548
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,500
No!

549
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:24,130
Aah!

550
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,530
Get you!

551
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,430
Aah!

552
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,930
Edie! give me that!

553
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,000
No! let go! no, you!

554
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,000
Let go!

555
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:37,230
You! aah! oh! oh! no!

556
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,260
No!

557
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,260
What did you do?!

558
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:44,100
What did you do, edie?!

559
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:48,000
Get in the house.

560
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:49,160
Now!

561
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,830
Aah!

562
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,800
Toby!

563
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:56,130
Toby.

564
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:59,030
Karen! you gotta get inside now!

565
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:01,300
He's right there! damn it!

566
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:04,100
I'm not gonna let you die, so don't make me drag you!

567
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:06,360
Oh, crap.

568
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:15,400
Oh! hurry! go! go!

569
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:17,030
Aah!

570
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:19,260
No! come on! come on!

571
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,030
Come on, come on!

572
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:21,960
Get in!

573
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:27,720
I have a crawl space.

574
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:30,620
I think we can both fit.

575
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:32,320
Oh!

576
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:34,820
You just threw my money in a tornado.

577
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:36,820
I am not getting in there with you.

578
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:39,650
Fine! then stay out there and die.

579
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:41,720
Move your ass! oh!

580
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,750
Come on, sylvia.

581
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:46,050
Please open the door.

582
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:48,790
Sylvia.

583
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:53,950
Thank god you're here. we need to get into the bathroom.

584
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:56,050
We can't. there's a woman in there.

585
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:58,750
Well, tell her to hurry it up.

586
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:01,950
No, no, no, she's barricaded herself in there.

587
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:05,920
She's a patient of mine who's had a little meltdown.

588
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:10,790
Just give me five minutes. we don't have time.

589
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:10,790
there's a funnel cloud out there.

590
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,490
Sylvia! open the damn door!

591
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,650
Go to hell!

592
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:19,650
Quick! in here, in here.

593
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:22,290
Come on.

594
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,420
Quickly. quickly.

595
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,720
Come on! hurry up!

596
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:30,020
Go! get in, get in! get in!

597
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:34,350
Uhh! hang on! hang onto this!

598
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:49,390
Can I say something?

599
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,020
What?

600
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,420
I'm sorry carlos and I lied to you.

601
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,150
I know we hurt you,

602
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:03,350
And I wish it didn't happen the way it did,

603
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:05,850
And i-i just want you to know that.

604
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:08,590
Why are you talking like that?

605
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,390
Well, I thought just in case we--

606
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:13,390
Oh, no, you don't. you just shut the hell up.

607
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:15,490
We're not doing deathbed confessions here.

608
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,490
We're gonna get through this.

609
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,820
I'm gonna go on hating you for years to come.

610
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:25,920
You really hate me?

611
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,290
Yes.

612
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:35,490
No.

613
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,990
It's just that

614
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:43,150
I really let myself fall for him,

615
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:45,650
Which was stupid because I always knew

616
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,550
That he'd go back to you.

617
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:53,250
Oh.

618
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:56,220
Well, I'm still sorry, though.

619
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:59,320
I said shut the hell up.

620
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:07,450
I think it's possible benjamin might need changing.

621
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:09,450
That went beyond the hypothetical

622
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:13,950
A good ten minutes ago. we're giving you shelter.

623
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:13,950
you could at least be gracious.

624
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:17,420
We wouldn't need shelter if you hadn't dragged us over here.

625
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:19,420
Oh, so now it's my fault that

626
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:21,920
That lunatic commandeered our safe room?

627
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:24,950
If you hadn't been dying to know our business,

628
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:27,990
She wouldn't have gotten in there. can we stop pointing fingers?

629
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,490
This isn't bree's fault.

630
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,020
You're right.

631
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:35,820
Sorry.

632
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:38,650
But you can understand why I'm upset,

633
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:41,150
Having that insane woman back in our lives.

634
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,650
I can only imagine.

635
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:45,920
I had to listen to her babble for an hour.

636
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:48,650
What kind of things was she saying?

637
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:51,150
She said that she and adam were lovers

638
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:54,120
And she could prove it because he had a tattoo, and...

639
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:57,120
What?

640
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:59,620
She said he had a tattoo on his shoulder,

641
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:02,620
Which I know isn't true because I've seen him at the pool,

642
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:04,120
And I would've remembered

643
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:07,590
Because tattooed people make me very uncomfortable.

644
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:12,650
Did she say what kind of tattoo it was?

645
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:14,650
Um... a snake. what's the difference?

646
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:16,890
He doesn't have one.

647
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,950
He did...

648
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:24,490
Back in chicago.

649
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,620
He had it removed.

650
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:37,250
Oh.

651
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:38,890
Sorry.

652
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,150
Katherine...

653
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:44,350
So... that's why we settled?

654
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:47,350
Why we lost everything?

655
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:49,490
I'm sorry, but you have to understand--

656
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,650
No, I do not.

657
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:02,950
Sorry.

658
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,190
Not here.

659
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,320
Not now.

660
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,520
Gaby!

661
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,020
Change of plans!

662
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:24,520
We gotta get in the basement now!

663
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:29,220
Gaby?

664
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:31,490
Damn it. where are you?

665
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,920
Where's gaby?

666
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:46,650
I thought she was with you.

667
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:48,950
I don't know where she is.

668
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:51,390
I guess we'll have to wait for her together.

669
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:05,020
Do you mind if I say something?

670
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:09,820
Look, gaby and I never planned to get back together, victor.

671
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:12,720
We tried to keep away from each other.

672
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:14,390
We really did.

673
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:16,390
But... I don't know.

674
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:19,390
It's like we're two halves of the same person or somethin'.

675
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:21,990
And when we're apart, w...

676
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:25,090
We just aren't happy, which is why we...

677
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:33,550
We never set out to hurt you, victor,

678
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:36,490
And I'm sorry we did.

679
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,620
Are you done?

680
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:40,120
Yeah.

681
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:52,090
Come on, carlos!

682
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:55,190
You better get in the house!

683
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,190
You could get hurt out here!

684
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:11,320
Oh!

685
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,350
Uhh!

686
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:53,920
Uhh!

687
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:06,220
Uhh!

688
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:16,920
In distance)

689
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:19,490
Adam!

690
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,550
Hello!

691
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:24,590
Where is everyone?!

692
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:28,550
Did you hear that?

693
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:32,450
Adam, I'm leaving!

694
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:35,350
This is your last chance to come with me,

695
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:38,390
Or I'm gonna tell everyone exactly what happened!

696
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:44,050
Okay.

697
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:48,020
You've made your choice! here I go!

698
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:50,650
Aah!

699
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:53,290
It's here.

700
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,490
Aah!

701
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,620
Oh!

702
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:16,050
It was supposed to be a beautiful day.

703
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:22,420
But then the winds came and changed everything...

704
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,490
And not just the houses and the lawns.

705
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:31,020
Oh, my god.

706
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:34,590
The people had changed, too.

707
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:41,150
While the storm had raged,

708
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:45,820
Each of them had learned something...

709
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:51,290
About friendship...

710
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:57,790
And forgiveness...

711
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:04,120
And redemption.

712
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:13,190
And some had learned the hardest lesson of all...

713
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:21,520
That life is always fragile

714
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:23,750
And very often...

715
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:27,150
Unfair.

716
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:50,850
Oh, my god! oh, my god!

717
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:54,420
Tom! help me!

718
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:56,850
Help me, tom!
