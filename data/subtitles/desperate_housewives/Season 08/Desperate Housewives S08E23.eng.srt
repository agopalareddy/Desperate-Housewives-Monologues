1
00:00:02,236 --> 00:00:03,580
<i>- Previously on</i>
- Desperate Housewives...

2
00:00:03,604 --> 00:00:04,903
<i>Susan had a secret.</i>

3
00:00:04,972 --> 00:00:06,032
Have you told
the girls you're moving?

4
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:07,188
Not yet.

5
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:09,235
I got an offer on your house.

6
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:12,127
<i>Carlos and Gaby got competitive.</i>

7
00:00:12,196 --> 00:00:13,578
I'll see you tonight.

8
00:00:13,647 --> 00:00:15,158
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
I can't take the girls
to school.

9
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:16,215
You always take them.

10
00:00:16,267 --> 00:00:17,710
I have to go to
work early today.

11
00:00:17,734 --> 00:00:19,434
Well, I'm at work right now.

12
00:00:19,503 --> 00:00:21,569
<i>Renee made her wedding plans.</i>

13
00:00:21,639 --> 00:00:23,817
That's a cake
I made for a wedding
a few years ago.

14
00:00:23,841 --> 00:00:25,081
I know what you're gonna say,

15
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:26,919
it's too extravagant.
It's not big enough.

16
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:28,655
Oh. Well,
I suppose we could
add another tier.

17
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:30,011
Make it two.

18
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,814
<i>Bree ended her relationship
with her lawyer.</i>

19
00:00:32,883 --> 00:00:33,883
You've lied to me.

20
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,183
To win this case.

21
00:00:35,252 --> 00:00:36,946
You're just pretending
there's something between us

22
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,298
so you could get
information from me.

23
00:00:38,322 --> 00:00:39,399
I wasn't trying to get...

24
00:00:39,423 --> 00:00:41,923
And you are not
welcome in my home.

25
00:00:41,992 --> 00:00:45,627
<i>And Tom and Lynette
finally got back together.</i>

26
00:00:53,587 --> 00:00:56,671
<i>This is how it started.</i>

27
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:01,126
<i>The woman who had lived</i>
<i>on the street for years</i>
<i>came outside</i>

28
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:05,364
<i>and introduced herself</i>
<i>to the woman</i>
<i>who was moving in next door.</i>

29
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:10,168
Welcome to the neighborhood!
I'm Martha Huber.

30
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:11,854
Mary Alice Young.

31
00:01:11,922 --> 00:01:14,389
So, you got a husband?
Mine's dead.

32
00:01:15,025 --> 00:01:16,174
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:17,875
Me, too, in theory.

34
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:18,961
Oh.

35
00:01:19,029 --> 00:01:20,362
I have a husband and a son.

36
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,342
They're in the other van.
They'll be here soon.

37
00:01:22,366 --> 00:01:24,666
Oh! I used to have
a chair just like that.

38
00:01:24,734 --> 00:01:26,846
It kept breaking,
so I threw it away.

39
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,403
I hate cheap furniture.

40
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:34,792
Yes. Well,
I should go help the movers.
Nice to meet you.

41
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:37,529
Wait! I hardly know
anything about you.

42
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:40,465
You didn't even mention
where you folks are from.

43
00:01:41,302 --> 00:01:42,684
Up north.

44
00:01:42,753 --> 00:01:44,686
"Up north."
That doesn't tell me anything.

45
00:01:44,755 --> 00:01:45,755
Where exactly?

46
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:48,901
Small town.
You wouldn't know it.

47
00:01:48,925 --> 00:01:50,025
Try me.

48
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:54,273
Why do you need to know that?

49
00:01:54,297 --> 00:01:55,530
Why don't you wanna tell me?

50
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:59,717
Well, it's no big deal.
It's just...

51
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:02,037
<i>And just like that,</i>

52
00:02:02,105 --> 00:02:05,874
<i>Martha Huber figured out
I was hiding something.</i>

53
00:02:05,943 --> 00:02:08,543
Oh. You're busy.

54
00:02:08,612 --> 00:02:13,381
We'll just have a long chat
once you've settled in. Okay?

55
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,785
<i>And my new neighbor</i>
<i>made it her mission</i>
<i>to find out</i>

56
00:02:17,922 --> 00:02:20,155
<i>what my secret was.</i>

57
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:24,525
<i>And this was the beginning</i>

58
00:02:25,161 --> 00:02:26,628
<i>of the end.</i>

59
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:56,424
<i>It was just after breakfast</i>
<i>when Susan Delfino</i>
<i>told her friends</i>

60
00:02:56,493 --> 00:03:00,745
<i>she'd soon be moving
from Wisteria Lane.</i>

61
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:05,433
<i>They were shocked</i>
<i>their old friend</i>
<i>was actually leaving.</i>

62
00:03:05,502 --> 00:03:08,770
<i>So shocked, it took them
a moment to notice</i>

63
00:03:08,839 --> 00:03:12,040
<i>another old friend had returned.</i>

64
00:03:14,378 --> 00:03:15,727
Oh, my God.

65
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:21,466
Hello, ladies.
Did you miss me?

66
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:24,975
So, three months
after we got to Paris,
Robin and I broke up.

67
00:03:25,022 --> 00:03:26,488
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:26,557 --> 00:03:29,157
Yeah, a long distance move
can be tough
on a relationship.

69
00:03:29,225 --> 00:03:32,005
That, and I decided
I just wasn't
into women anymore.

70
00:03:32,029 --> 00:03:34,140
Although, in Paris,
it's hard to
tell the difference.

71
00:03:34,164 --> 00:03:36,492
The women don't shave,
and the men carry purses.

72
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,518
So, what team are
you playing for now?

73
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:41,820
I'm out of the game.

74
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,328
I decided to channel
my sexual frustration

75
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:47,826
into starting my own business,
a line of frozen
French pastries.

76
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,094
Bree, you remember
how my croissants

77
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,674
were always
the best on the lane.

78
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:54,015
I remember you thinking that.

79
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:57,618
So, basically, you sell
microwavable French food

80
00:03:57,687 --> 00:03:59,082
to the French?
Yep.

81
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:02,040
As they got lazier and fatter,
I got thinner and richer.

82
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:04,203
Now my accountant
has me buying chateaus

83
00:04:04,227 --> 00:04:07,279
just to do something
with all my money.

84
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:11,816
So, other than wanting to
rub your success in our faces,

85
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:13,802
what brings you back?

86
00:04:13,871 --> 00:04:16,071
I have a little
business proposition

87
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:17,422
for Lynette.

88
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:23,194
Tighter.

89
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:25,564
If I go any tighter,
you won't be able to breathe.

90
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:28,366
Jean, you're talking
to a woman
who gave herself salmonella

91
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,401
to lose 10 pounds before prom.

92
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,038
Beauty is suffering.
Now, tighter!

93
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:34,807
Hey.

94
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,827
What are you doing here?

95
00:04:38,895 --> 00:04:42,063
You can't see me
before the wedding.
It's bad luck!

96
00:04:42,131 --> 00:04:44,799
So, I picked up the programs
from the printer.

97
00:04:51,007 --> 00:04:53,742
Oh, my God.
Do I have to do everything?

98
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,461
This is ivory.
I told you to get beige.

99
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,929
Are you color-blind?

100
00:04:57,998 --> 00:04:59,397
You do know I'm black, right?

101
00:05:01,335 --> 00:05:03,768
Honey,
I can't help but notice,
you seem a little...

102
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:04,970
Bitchy?

103
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,605
No, I was gonna say,
less angelic than usual.

104
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:11,259
I am busting my ass
to plan the happiest day
of your life.

105
00:05:11,328 --> 00:05:14,329
So let's ditch the sarcasm,
shall we?

106
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:15,997
You know what?

107
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:17,877
It is bad luck for the groom
to see the bride
before the wedding.

108
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,234
And I just realized why.

109
00:05:22,873 --> 00:05:26,742
Jean, I told you, tighter.
I don't care if I can breathe.

110
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,810
At this point, neither do I.

111
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,448
What was going on out there?

112
00:05:33,516 --> 00:05:34,861
Katherine came back for a visit.

113
00:05:34,885 --> 00:05:36,062
And before you get too excited,

114
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:37,463
no, she's not a lesbian anymore.

115
00:05:37,487 --> 00:05:39,921
Really? Damn.

116
00:05:39,989 --> 00:05:41,834
Hey, while you were out
dishing with your friends,

117
00:05:41,858 --> 00:05:43,190
our gardener quit.

118
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,992
He wouldn't name names,
but apparently,

119
00:05:45,061 --> 00:05:47,345
one of us is
a little too hard to please.

120
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:49,113
Yeah, you should work on that.

121
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,292
So you're gonna get a new one?

122
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:51,316
When?

123
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:52,867
I have a job, too, you know.

124
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:55,056
Carlos, you help the poor
and downtrodden,

125
00:05:55,122 --> 00:05:56,602
a group with a very
flexible schedule.

126
00:05:57,874 --> 00:06:01,309
I'm working crazy hours.
House stuff is up to you now.

127
00:06:01,378 --> 00:06:02,627
Oh! It's my boss.

128
00:06:04,047 --> 00:06:05,287
Hello, Mr. Hoffman.

129
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:08,633
Really? Me?

130
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:14,172
Yes, I'm very interested.
Thank you.

131
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,480
I don't know what to say.

132
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:18,860
Okay, I'll see you then, sir.

133
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,363
What was that about?

134
00:06:22,432 --> 00:06:25,183
I just got a huge promotion.

135
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:26,918
I'm the new head of VIP Sales.

136
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:29,054
Seriously?

137
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:31,138
Babe, that's amazing.

138
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:33,892
What's wrong?

139
00:06:33,961 --> 00:06:36,994
I don't know. It's so big.

140
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:38,896
It's a whole department.

141
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:41,716
They're really trusting me.
What if I can't do it?

142
00:06:41,785 --> 00:06:46,438
Gabby, don't you know how
smart and talented you are?

143
00:06:46,507 --> 00:06:47,507
You deserve this.

144
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:53,623
Yeah. You know what,
you're right.

145
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:55,592
I just gotta learn
how to be the boss.

146
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:57,394
I don't even know
how to talk to employees.

147
00:06:57,418 --> 00:06:59,384
Yeah, I think
our gardener would agree.

148
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:02,821
Please.
That sad sack was a moron.

149
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:06,091
So, how you been feeling?

150
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:08,342
I've been craving
chocolate constantly.

151
00:07:08,411 --> 00:07:10,462
But that's okay, right?

152
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,930
Within moderation,
but I'm not worried.

153
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:14,263
You look great.

154
00:07:14,802 --> 00:07:15,934
Thank you.

155
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,805
You know,
Julie is getting her Ph.D.

156
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:22,741
So soon,
she'll be a doctor, too.

157
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:26,361
Maybe you two
should have lunch
sometime and talk shop.

158
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:31,160
Yeah, that would be nice.
I'm sorry,
I have to take this.

159
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:32,424
I'll be right back.

160
00:07:34,471 --> 00:07:35,520
What the hell was that?

161
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:36,988
He was flirting with you.

162
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:38,322
He's my obstetrician.

163
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:40,842
Well, he knows you're fertile.
Men like that.

164
00:07:40,911 --> 00:07:43,144
Enough. I don't need you
to fix me up.

165
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:46,130
I'm just worried about you.
I don't want you to be lonely.

166
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,777
Well, good news.
In three weeks,

167
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,918
I will have
a permanent house guest.

168
00:07:49,987 --> 00:07:52,954
I'm talking about
the other kind of lonely.

169
00:07:53,023 --> 00:07:56,324
Even single mothers have needs.

170
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:59,239
Childbirth can't possibly
be as painful as
this conversation.

171
00:07:59,263 --> 00:08:03,298
You don't know
how hard it's gonna be.
Having a kid is exhausting.

172
00:08:03,367 --> 00:08:06,668
You have no time to exercise
or eat right.

173
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:07,969
The great news is,

174
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:10,705
you don't have to
let yourself go.

175
00:08:10,774 --> 00:08:12,840
I'll be there,
helping with the baby.

176
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,976
So you'll have time
to go to the gym.

177
00:08:15,045 --> 00:08:17,962
I'll let myself go.
I don't mind.

178
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:22,817
Mom, I just felt the baby
tap out "Make her stop"
in Morse Code.

179
00:08:22,886 --> 00:08:25,820
It's hard to find a man
when you're a single mom.

180
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:27,688
That's my point. I'm done.

181
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,341
As I remember, you found Mike.

182
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:38,300
Yes, well, I was very lucky.

183
00:08:40,503 --> 00:08:41,786
You sure were.

184
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:46,958
There you go.

185
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:50,061
Beautiful day, isn't it?

186
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:54,649
One of the nice things
about dying is,
every day seems beautiful.

187
00:08:54,717 --> 00:08:57,035
You always wince
when I say things like that.

188
00:08:57,103 --> 00:09:00,321
I don't mean to.
It's just hard for me.

189
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:01,672
For you?

190
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,674
You wanna switch places
with her?

191
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,827
Be nice, Roy.

192
00:09:05,895 --> 00:09:09,881
By the way, Karen,
I got that song you wanted
for your funeral.

193
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:13,017
Thank you, Bree.
Johnny Mathis.

194
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:15,164
My girlfriends and I
taught each other to dance

195
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:17,308
listening to
<i>Wonderful! Wonderful!</i>

196
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:20,558
I was only able
to get it on a CD.

197
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:24,295
No, no. It's gotta be
on a 45 that I can play
on a record player,

198
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:26,524
just like I did
when I was a kid.

199
00:09:28,117 --> 00:09:30,917
By the way,
I'll also need
the record player.

200
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:33,487
You know,
it's really hard
to find those 45s.

201
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:37,462
But I'm gonna keep looking.

202
00:09:39,129 --> 00:09:40,161
Hello.

203
00:09:41,764 --> 00:09:43,631
Oh. Hello, Trip.

204
00:09:46,036 --> 00:09:48,202
I already told you,
I'm not interested.

205
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,923
Please stop calling.

206
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,688
Is that your lawyer friend?

207
00:09:55,712 --> 00:09:57,244
Well, you're half right.

208
00:09:57,313 --> 00:09:58,930
I thought you liked him.

209
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:03,000
I did, more than
I've liked anybody
in a very long time.

210
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:05,753
But then I realized
that he just
manipulates people

211
00:10:05,822 --> 00:10:07,756
so that he can
get what he wants.

212
00:10:07,824 --> 00:10:10,675
I can't trust him.

213
00:10:10,744 --> 00:10:13,878
All right, you two,
I will check in on you later.

214
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:20,735
Roy, be a peach
and look up
a phone number for me.

215
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:23,087
Karen, what are you up to?

216
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:24,722
I don't know.

217
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,469
I thought it would be fun to
screw with people's lives

218
00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:28,659
one last time
before I check out.

219
00:10:33,082 --> 00:10:34,649
Wow.

220
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:37,985
Sounds like you're doing
pretty good.
I mean, your own company?

221
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,999
Yeah.
I didn't wanna brag
in front of the girls,

222
00:10:40,023 --> 00:10:42,156
but it's worth a few bucks.

223
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:43,558
That was you not bragging?

224
00:10:43,627 --> 00:10:46,277
Well, just look at
our last financial statement.

225
00:10:50,684 --> 00:10:51,883
I love doing that!

226
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:54,686
Have a seat.

227
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:57,705
In fact, we are doing so well

228
00:10:57,774 --> 00:11:00,892
that we are looking
to expand worldwide.

229
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,895
And I would like you to
head our US division

230
00:11:03,947 --> 00:11:05,396
in New York.

231
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:10,768
Oh, my God.

232
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,570
That's a huge job.

233
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:15,373
Why me?

234
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:18,476
Because you're the smartest
businesswoman I know.

235
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:20,056
And when I heard
that you and Tom split,

236
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,224
I thought there's nothing
tying you to Fairview.

237
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:23,547
Well, here's the thing...

238
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:26,044
Twenty minutes
until my job interview,
and I lose a button.

239
00:11:26,068 --> 00:11:27,668
Can you... Katherine.

240
00:11:27,737 --> 00:11:29,837
That's the thing.

241
00:11:29,905 --> 00:11:31,717
What brings you back
to the States?

242
00:11:31,741 --> 00:11:36,260
Your wife, actually.
I came to offer her a job
in New York.

243
00:11:37,814 --> 00:11:39,030
Wow!

244
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:43,251
But obviously,
I'm not taking it.

245
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:48,356
We just got back together,
and I couldn't be happier.

246
00:11:48,425 --> 00:11:51,404
Sorry, Katherine.
I know how painful
it is to lose Lynette,

247
00:11:51,428 --> 00:11:53,788
and how sweet it is
to get her back.

248
00:11:54,564 --> 00:11:56,592
Here.
Leave the shirt with me, babe.
I got it.

249
00:11:56,616 --> 00:11:57,649
Thanks.

250
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:01,585
Well, I'm in town for three days

251
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:03,832
if you wanna keep
talking about this.

252
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:06,607
No. I feel pretty comfortable
with my decision.

253
00:12:06,676 --> 00:12:09,743
Okay.
But the Lynette that I knew

254
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:13,965
was never happy with
a life of sewing buttons.

255
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,658
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Sorry I'm late.

256
00:12:23,726 --> 00:12:25,193
I'm starving.
What are we having?

257
00:12:26,363 --> 00:12:27,862
I had a lovely steak.

258
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:29,925
Then, an hour later,
I had your lovely steak.

259
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:32,784
So I guess you're having cereal.

260
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:36,254
Come on, you know how it is.
First day of a new job?
It was crazy.

261
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,134
And what, you lost your phone?

262
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:42,043
I know, I know.
I'm a terrible, awful person.

263
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:46,047
But maybe you can
find a way to forgive me

264
00:12:46,115 --> 00:12:49,050
after you see this.

265
00:12:50,387 --> 00:12:51,797
Whoa!

266
00:12:51,821 --> 00:12:53,533
I know. I saw it,
and all I could
think about was

267
00:12:53,557 --> 00:12:57,725
how sexy it would look
on that big, strong
wrist of yours.

268
00:12:58,995 --> 00:13:01,355
I don't think I've
ever seen anything...

269
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:04,866
Oh, my God. Wait a minute.

270
00:13:04,935 --> 00:13:05,935
What?

271
00:13:07,737 --> 00:13:11,539
I know this move.
I invented this move.

272
00:13:11,608 --> 00:13:13,152
I don't know what
you're talking about.

273
00:13:13,176 --> 00:13:15,409
It's what I used to do to you.

274
00:13:15,478 --> 00:13:18,858
I'd buy you jewelry
to compensate for
being a lousy husband.

275
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:21,766
And it worked beautifully.
So shut up and enjoy.

276
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:24,513
I can't believe
you're trying to
buy me off with a watch.

277
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:26,082
Oh! When you shake
your wrist like that,

278
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:27,583
the diamonds
really catch the light.

279
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:29,352
Oh, my God!
You're even quoting me!

280
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,226
You don't want the watch?
Fine.

281
00:13:32,295 --> 00:13:33,994
But everyone has a price.
You name it.

282
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,731
Sex, massage,
Three Stooges marathon.

283
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:40,535
The price for my forgiveness

284
00:13:40,603 --> 00:13:43,148
is you paying
a little more attention
to me.

285
00:13:43,172 --> 00:13:46,357
Being more present,
more respectful
of my feelings and needs.

286
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:48,326
You want a new car.

287
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:49,560
I'm going to bed.

288
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:52,997
What? No, come back.
You're sexy
when you're angry.

289
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:54,932
Yep, that's mine, too!

290
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:02,123
Lynette Scavo?

291
00:14:03,126 --> 00:14:04,692
Oh, my God.

292
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,077
How long has it been?

293
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:09,480
Oh! A long time.
How are you doing, Natalie?

294
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:11,048
I'm great.

295
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:14,769
The question is, how are you?
I heard about you and Tom.

296
00:14:14,838 --> 00:14:17,772
Oh! Yeah, we went
through a rough patch.

297
00:14:17,841 --> 00:14:21,075
But we're back together now,
and things are
better than ever.

298
00:14:21,143 --> 00:14:22,743
What a relief.

299
00:14:22,812 --> 00:14:25,079
I just kept thinking,
"Poor Lynette.

300
00:14:25,147 --> 00:14:26,881
"Sacrificed her whole career
for that man,

301
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,799
"and then
it didn't even work out?"

302
00:14:28,851 --> 00:14:32,353
Just to be clear,
I didn't sacrifice
my career for anyone.

303
00:14:32,422 --> 00:14:33,954
Well, I didn't mean
anything by it.

304
00:14:34,023 --> 00:14:35,490
If anything, I'm jealous of you.

305
00:14:35,558 --> 00:14:36,858
Oh?

306
00:14:36,926 --> 00:14:40,361
My company has branches in
15 cities around the world.

307
00:14:40,429 --> 00:14:42,663
I live out of a suitcase.
And you?

308
00:14:42,732 --> 00:14:46,050
There must be days
when you don't even
leave the house.

309
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:47,619
The simple life.

310
00:14:50,106 --> 00:14:51,673
I got a job offer yesterday.

311
00:14:51,741 --> 00:14:52,907
Really?

312
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:54,953
Yeah. This big
European food company

313
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,755
is taking its brand
to the States,

314
00:14:56,779 --> 00:14:58,862
and they want me
to run it, so...

315
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:02,550
Impressive.
When do you start?

316
00:15:02,619 --> 00:15:05,987
Well, it's in New York,
so it's a lot
to consider, and...

317
00:15:06,055 --> 00:15:08,439
And that is the difference
between me and you.

318
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:11,241
I'd grab
an opportunity like that
in a second.

319
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,944
But not you.

320
00:15:13,696 --> 00:15:15,195
In your heart of hearts,

321
00:15:15,264 --> 00:15:18,549
you're a wife and a mommy.
Congrats.

322
00:15:19,035 --> 00:15:20,035
See you.

323
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:32,029
Katherine, it's Lynette.
Call me back.
We have to talk.

324
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:37,067
Hey, gotta run.

325
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:39,098
Huge day.
E-mails have been coming in
since 7:00.

326
00:15:39,122 --> 00:15:41,199
Just so you know,
our new gardener
started today.

327
00:15:41,223 --> 00:15:42,635
Great.
Mind running defense for me?

328
00:15:42,659 --> 00:15:44,120
I really don't have time
to chit-chat with the help.

329
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:45,993
It'll be my pleasure.

330
00:15:50,933 --> 00:15:53,000
Oh! <i>Hola!</i>

331
00:15:53,069 --> 00:15:54,368
I'm Carmen.

332
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,322
Uh-huh.

333
00:15:58,908 --> 00:16:00,524
What the hell is that?

334
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:01,842
That's our new gardener.

335
00:16:01,911 --> 00:16:03,160
She's gonna take care of

336
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:05,709
everything around here
that's been neglected.

337
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:07,582
You think that's funny?

338
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:09,841
Just making a point.

339
00:16:10,704 --> 00:16:12,836
You crossed the line, Carlos.

340
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,538
You've crossed the line!

341
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:17,074
Gabby, come on.

342
00:16:18,745 --> 00:16:20,544
Gabby!

343
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:43,401
Watch the dirt.
And watch the grass.

344
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,069
Focus, ladies!

345
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:47,082
This dress costs
more than your houses,

346
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:48,373
put together!

347
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:50,102
Okay. You know what, Renee,
I know this is your day,

348
00:16:50,126 --> 00:16:51,871
but it's only 10:00
and you're already
a huge pain in the ass.

349
00:16:51,895 --> 00:16:53,038
Well, then, I'm running late.

350
00:16:53,062 --> 00:16:55,913
I should've been
a huge pain in the ass
by 9:00.

351
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:59,817
You in the stupid hat,
open the door!

352
00:17:04,657 --> 00:17:06,173
Oh! Wow!

353
00:17:06,242 --> 00:17:08,593
Where you going all dolled up?

354
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:10,061
Renee's wedding.

355
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:12,641
I just wanted
to check on Karen
before I left.

356
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:13,797
She's sleeping.

357
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:16,417
I don't think it'll be long now.

358
00:17:19,322 --> 00:17:22,990
Roy, I'm so sorry.

359
00:17:23,058 --> 00:17:24,542
Would you like me to stay?

360
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:28,011
No.
This is our time together.

361
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,496
We'll be fine.

362
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,617
Good, you found Karen's record.

363
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:35,953
Not me, that lawyer guy.

364
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:37,121
Trip?

365
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:40,040
Karen told him
she really wanted it.

366
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:43,994
The son of a gun
must have gone to
20 different record stores.

367
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:46,897
Well, that's lovely.

368
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:49,917
You should have seen
the smile on her face
when he brought it in.

369
00:17:52,255 --> 00:17:54,672
He's a good guy.

370
00:17:59,762 --> 00:18:02,229
Do you seriously need to
stretch out on her?

371
00:18:02,298 --> 00:18:04,131
What do you want
me to do, crease?

372
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:09,620
Hello, Ben.

373
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:13,224
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't raise your voice to me.

374
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:15,059
Hair and make-up took forever,

375
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:17,606
and then we had
to wait 20 minutes
for Susan and...

376
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,463
I was totally on time.

377
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:21,265
He does not need to know that.

378
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,100
Yeah, we're on our way now.

379
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:25,636
I promise we'll be
there no later than...

380
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:28,105
We're going through a tunnel!

381
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:29,317
How late are we?

382
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:32,443
I should have been
cutting the cake by now!

383
00:18:32,512 --> 00:18:34,992
Okay, not a good day
to hand her a knife.

384
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:39,717
Julie, are you okay?

385
00:18:39,769 --> 00:18:40,979
Oh, my God.

386
00:18:41,003 --> 00:18:43,354
What? What's wrong?

387
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:45,382
I think my water just broke.

388
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:52,330
How could you do this to me?

389
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:54,298
She's in labor!

390
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:55,966
Nine months!

391
00:18:56,035 --> 00:18:58,502
You had nine months,
and this is the moment
you pick?

392
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:00,871
Renee, I am so sorry.

393
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,506
Hold on.
Everything's gonna be fine.

394
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:04,542
How? My dress is ruined!

395
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:05,943
I got an idea.

396
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:09,814
Hey, driver, we need you to
swing by Cumberly's.

397
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:11,882
My store has
an amazing bridal department.

398
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:14,117
Are you insane?
Take us to the hospital!

399
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:16,303
Come on.
She just started labor.

400
00:19:16,372 --> 00:19:18,505
Keep your legs together, honey.

401
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:20,569
We're just gonna run in
and grab a dress.

402
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:22,192
And shoes.

403
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:23,372
You need shoes, too?

404
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:24,978
Thanks to Old Faithful here.

405
00:19:25,047 --> 00:19:26,647
My daughter is having a baby,

406
00:19:26,716 --> 00:19:29,016
and you wanna go
on a shopping spree?

407
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:31,652
Could someone please
just tell me where to go?

408
00:19:31,721 --> 00:19:33,641
Cumberly's!
Hospital!

409
00:19:34,557 --> 00:19:36,234
Let's just go to Cumberly's.
Julie!

410
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:39,410
Mom,
my contractions just started.
We have time. Ah!

411
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:41,279
Ugh! Do you have
to keep doing that?

412
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:49,364
Okay, size sixes are over there.

413
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:50,421
Hey.

414
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:52,356
Don't lie to me.

415
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:55,560
Ugh.

416
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:57,595
No. No.

417
00:19:57,664 --> 00:19:59,396
God, no.

418
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:04,936
Now, that is beautiful.

419
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:07,054
My daughter's looking at this.

420
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:08,733
When's her wedding?
Three months.

421
00:20:08,757 --> 00:20:09,823
Mine's in five minutes.

422
00:20:10,893 --> 00:20:11,942
Unzip me.

423
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:17,582
Oh! Hi, hi.

424
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:21,235
I'm Gabrielle Solis,
Head of VIP Sales
here at Cumberly's.

425
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:24,054
I'm Kent, minimum wage worker
stuck here on a Saturday.

426
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:25,605
Can I help you?

427
00:20:25,675 --> 00:20:27,485
I need to borrow a bridal gown.

428
00:20:27,509 --> 00:20:28,509
"Borrow"?

429
00:20:28,595 --> 00:20:29,621
Just for the afternoon.

430
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:32,078
We don't lend bridal dresses.

431
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:34,281
Well, I know it's not policy,

432
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:36,428
but can't you do a favor
for a fellow worker?

433
00:20:36,452 --> 00:20:38,802
Ma'am, I've never heard of you.

434
00:20:38,871 --> 00:20:41,288
Do you have your
employee ID card?

435
00:20:41,356 --> 00:20:45,258
No. I'm not one
of those nerds
who carries her ID card on

436
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:49,213
a handsome lanyard.

437
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:51,882
So, you want me to give you
a $6,000 wedding dress?

438
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:54,785
Five thousand
with my employee discount.

439
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:55,853
Go away, ma'am.

440
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,318
Oh!

441
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:00,941
That was a big one.

442
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:04,662
They seem to be
coming a lot faster.

443
00:21:04,731 --> 00:21:07,131
Excuse me,
would you mind going in

444
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,593
and finding out
what's keeping them?

445
00:21:08,617 --> 00:21:11,068
Things seem to be
speeding up a bit back here.

446
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:12,377
Right away.

447
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:16,273
Mom, what are you doing?

448
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:19,910
You are not
having my granddaughter
in the back of a limousine.

449
00:21:23,983 --> 00:21:25,198
Keep breathing!

450
00:21:33,742 --> 00:21:35,076
So, are we set?

451
00:21:35,144 --> 00:21:36,955
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Told you I was
a big shot here.

452
00:21:36,979 --> 00:21:38,446
Now walk with me.

453
00:21:38,514 --> 00:21:39,980
There's only one tiny hiccup.

454
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:41,226
Hey, where are you going
with that dress?

455
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,016
And now we run.

456
00:21:51,627 --> 00:21:53,260
Where... Where's the limo?

457
00:21:53,329 --> 00:21:55,107
I don't know, it was right here.

458
00:21:55,131 --> 00:21:57,331
And we're running again.

459
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:09,726
Do you not have a car?

460
00:22:09,779 --> 00:22:12,579
Does it look like
we have a car? Huh?

461
00:22:13,282 --> 00:22:14,815
Does it?

462
00:22:14,884 --> 00:22:16,928
Okay, all right.
Again,
late for your own wedding.

463
00:22:16,952 --> 00:22:18,318
Maybe kill this guy later.

464
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:24,502
Don't say a word.
You hear me?

465
00:22:24,526 --> 00:22:28,145
You have no idea
what I had to go through
to get here,

466
00:22:28,214 --> 00:22:32,216
so if you even give me
one syllable of grief,

467
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:35,986
I will kick your sorry ass
all the way
back to Australia!

468
00:22:40,743 --> 00:22:43,293
I've never seen anyone
look so beautiful.

469
00:22:53,322 --> 00:22:56,290
Let's go inside
and get started on
our wedded bliss.

470
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:05,266
No, no, Katherine, I am excited.

471
00:23:05,334 --> 00:23:07,601
I just need to
talk to Tom first.

472
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:10,737
Well, can you give me
till the end of the day?

473
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,739
Okay, thanks. Bye.

474
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,453
Talk to me about what?
Hi.

475
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:15,809
Hi.

476
00:23:15,878 --> 00:23:17,244
Oh, um...

477
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:19,913
Katherine keeps pushing me
about this job thing.

478
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:21,081
I thought you told her no.

479
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,550
I did,

480
00:23:22,618 --> 00:23:24,218
but once she
started talking about

481
00:23:24,287 --> 00:23:26,253
compensation packages and the...

482
00:23:28,357 --> 00:23:30,123
You're negotiating a salary?

483
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,959
Lynette, we...

484
00:23:33,028 --> 00:23:36,263
We just got back together.
What are you doing?

485
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:40,901
It could be
the last time an opportunity
like this comes along for me.

486
00:23:40,969 --> 00:23:43,904
If I don't take it,
I'm afraid that...

487
00:23:43,972 --> 00:23:45,305
You won't be happy?

488
00:23:45,941 --> 00:23:46,941
Well...

489
00:23:48,377 --> 00:23:49,377
Yeah.

490
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:57,167
Hey. Hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey!

491
00:23:57,235 --> 00:24:00,403
Lynette, I would do anything,

492
00:24:00,473 --> 00:24:03,574
I would go anywhere in the world

493
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:07,811
if I believed it would
finally make you happy.

494
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,390
But for as long as
I have known you,

495
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:11,125
you've always thought you needed

496
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:13,550
something else
to make you complete.

497
00:24:15,888 --> 00:24:20,390
And I'm starting to realize,
nothing ever will.

498
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:46,797
Hello, Trip.

499
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,186
Ben invited me.

500
00:24:49,255 --> 00:24:52,556
So if you wanna slug somebody,
slug him.

501
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:54,891
No. I'm glad to see you.

502
00:24:57,596 --> 00:25:00,442
I wanted to thank you
for what you did
for Mrs. McCluskey.

503
00:25:00,466 --> 00:25:02,566
That was very kind.

504
00:25:02,635 --> 00:25:03,783
She's an awesome lady.

505
00:25:04,971 --> 00:25:08,205
And she once helped out
a client of mine.

506
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:13,577
Well,
that's all I wanted to say.
Enjoy the reception.

507
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:16,063
Really? You can't think of
anything else to say to me?

508
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,199
Like what?

509
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:21,852
I don't know. Like...

510
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,436
How about, "Hey, Trip.

511
00:25:23,505 --> 00:25:27,391
"Maybe you are a good guy.
I should give you
another chance."

512
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:31,562
Is that why you
found that old record?
To impress me?

513
00:25:33,466 --> 00:25:34,748
Do you really think that?

514
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:38,953
Look,

515
00:25:41,073 --> 00:25:42,656
I know I wanna be with you.

516
00:25:44,659 --> 00:25:48,112
But if you don't think
you can ever trust me again,

517
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,430
well, I'm not gonna beg.

518
00:25:55,671 --> 00:25:56,686
Why?

519
00:25:58,557 --> 00:25:59,923
Why?

520
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:03,961
Yes.
Why do you wanna be with me?

521
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:05,762
You were my lawyer.

522
00:26:05,831 --> 00:26:07,865
You know all the ugliest
details of my life,

523
00:26:07,934 --> 00:26:12,702
my lying, my drinking,
my promiscuity.

524
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:15,066
I was actually relieved
when you put Gabby
on the witness stand,

525
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:17,207
because it explained
why you kissed me.

526
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:21,694
It was a manipulation, I got it.

527
00:26:21,763 --> 00:26:23,230
But to keep saying you want me

528
00:26:23,298 --> 00:26:27,834
when you know
how horribly flawed I am.

529
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:34,541
I don't trust you because
it just doesn't make sense.

530
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:39,112
How about

531
00:26:40,382 --> 00:26:42,549
I explain it?

532
00:26:52,228 --> 00:26:53,560
That clear it up for you?

533
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:56,096
Almost.

534
00:26:56,165 --> 00:26:58,965
Look, Bree,

535
00:26:59,035 --> 00:27:01,801
all those ugly details
you're talking about,

536
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,405
they just prove
that you're human.

537
00:27:04,473 --> 00:27:08,475
Okay?
I don't wanna love an ideal.
I wanna love a real person.

538
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:12,830
So, what happens now?

539
00:27:13,582 --> 00:27:15,148
Well,

540
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:17,161
first, we're gonna
walk out onto
that dance floor

541
00:27:17,185 --> 00:27:19,665
and show your friends
how it's really done.

542
00:27:20,589 --> 00:27:22,840
Hopefully, by then,
I'll get up the courage to

543
00:27:22,908 --> 00:27:25,442
once again ask you to
go out on a date with me.

544
00:27:25,511 --> 00:27:26,721
Of course,
even as I'm saying that,

545
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:29,065
I'm still not sure
what you're gonna say.

546
00:27:33,602 --> 00:27:35,735
Did that clear it up for you?

547
00:27:57,209 --> 00:28:00,910
Hey. You wanna dance?
They're playing a tango.

548
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:04,881
Wow, you're finally
talking to me again.
I must be out of the doghouse.

549
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:07,183
No, I'm still pretty mad.

550
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:09,753
Why? It was a joke.

551
00:28:09,822 --> 00:28:12,055
All those years ago, when I...

552
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:14,007
I did what I did
with John Rowland,

553
00:28:14,076 --> 00:28:16,743
that's the most
shameful thing in my life.

554
00:28:16,812 --> 00:28:19,846
You can't make jokes about it.
It's too painful.

555
00:28:19,915 --> 00:28:21,155
Fair enough.

556
00:28:22,484 --> 00:28:23,984
You know,

557
00:28:24,053 --> 00:28:26,814
it was
the most shameful thing
in my life, too.

558
00:28:27,022 --> 00:28:28,022
I'm sorry.

559
00:28:28,507 --> 00:28:30,173
No.

560
00:28:30,242 --> 00:28:33,176
What's shameful is
that I neglected you.

561
00:28:33,245 --> 00:28:36,997
I had this beautiful wife,

562
00:28:37,065 --> 00:28:39,346
but I focused on
all the wrong things.

563
00:28:41,087 --> 00:28:43,220
It was a tough time
for both of us.

564
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:47,691
I guess that's the point
I was making hiring Carmen.

565
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,554
Our roles are reversed now,

566
00:28:49,578 --> 00:28:51,222
but we can't start
drifting away
from each other.

567
00:28:51,246 --> 00:28:55,014
I never want to go
back to that again.

568
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:58,117
We won't.
We've grown up since then.

569
00:29:06,712 --> 00:29:09,713
Although,
for two smart grown-ups,
we sure seem to fight a lot.

570
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:13,563
Why is it other couples
seem to waltz through life?

571
00:29:14,936 --> 00:29:16,303
Well, that's easy.

572
00:29:17,939 --> 00:29:19,172
You and me?

573
00:29:20,642 --> 00:29:22,292
We're doing a tango.

574
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:28,882
Hey. I hear
someone's having a baby.

575
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:31,150
Yes, a little ahead
of schedule. Sorry.

576
00:29:31,219 --> 00:29:32,285
No, it's no problem.

577
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:34,304
I was just playing
hoops down the block.

578
00:29:34,373 --> 00:29:35,655
Don't worry, I'm gonna wash up

579
00:29:35,724 --> 00:29:37,601
and then we'll get
this show on the road.
Okay?

580
00:29:37,625 --> 00:29:38,658
Okay.

581
00:29:38,727 --> 00:29:39,727
All right.

582
00:29:41,747 --> 00:29:43,747
Did you see his legs?

583
00:29:43,816 --> 00:29:45,916
How can you not wanna be
married to those legs?

584
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:47,417
Mom, please.

585
00:29:47,486 --> 00:29:50,436
Right. I'm annoying. Sorry.

586
00:29:50,505 --> 00:29:52,438
You know,
in honor of this special day,

587
00:29:52,507 --> 00:29:55,547
I promise to
never again bug you
about finding a husband.

588
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:00,980
Even the baby
knows you're lying.

589
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:07,471
What about you?

590
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:09,299
Do you think
you'll ever get married again?

591
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:10,341
Julie.

592
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:12,042
No, I'm serious.

593
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,661
You're still young,
and gorgeous.

594
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:17,129
I don't know.

595
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:22,819
There's a saying,

596
00:30:22,888 --> 00:30:25,267
"You know
you've hit middle-age
when your memories become

597
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:27,611
"more important to you
than your dreams."

598
00:30:29,195 --> 00:30:32,479
And I have such
wonderful memories,

599
00:30:32,547 --> 00:30:34,280
of Mike,

600
00:30:34,349 --> 00:30:37,034
and you kids growing up,

601
00:30:37,102 --> 00:30:39,569
all our friends on the lane.

602
00:30:43,525 --> 00:30:46,459
Do I have one last

603
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:49,596
torrid romance in me?

604
00:30:49,665 --> 00:30:50,680
Maybe.

605
00:30:54,069 --> 00:30:57,871
But I know if I am
ever cold and lonely,

606
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:00,841
I can wrap myself up
in all those memories,

607
00:31:00,909 --> 00:31:02,709
and I will be content.

608
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:16,740
So, Renee and Ben, never forget

609
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:20,526
that it takes
a lot of love to make
a house a home.

610
00:31:20,595 --> 00:31:22,107
And when you're in the market
for a new home,

611
00:31:22,131 --> 00:31:23,864
consider Lee McDermott, 1-800...

612
00:31:23,932 --> 00:31:25,699
Give me that!

613
00:31:25,768 --> 00:31:28,184
Okay, matron of honor's turn.

614
00:31:29,004 --> 00:31:31,605
Lynette Scavo, give us a toast.

615
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:37,094
Renee and Ben,

616
00:31:37,162 --> 00:31:40,079
your wedding
is one of the best days
of your life.

617
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,748
'Cause it's the day you realize,

618
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:45,552
"I finally have the thing
I need to be happy."

619
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,740
And then you forget.

620
00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:53,977
So then what happens is,

621
00:31:54,046 --> 00:31:56,780
instead of waking up
every morning and shouting,

622
00:31:56,848 --> 00:32:00,016
"Somebody loves me,"
you start looking around
and thinking,

623
00:32:00,986 --> 00:32:02,652
"What do I want now?

624
00:32:02,721 --> 00:32:06,890
"What's the next thing
I need to be happy?"

625
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:11,611
So you look and you look,

626
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:15,098
and you keep thinking
you've found it,
but nothing works.

627
00:32:15,167 --> 00:32:19,569
And the reason
that nothing works,
is because

628
00:32:22,007 --> 00:32:25,108
that hole in your heart
that you're trying to fill

629
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:29,045
is already filled.

630
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:35,034
You just forgot.

631
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:46,847
Don't ever forget.

632
00:32:46,915 --> 00:32:50,700
Always remember
how much you
wanted to be loved

633
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:55,488
and how much you are loved.

634
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:58,437
And I think
if you can do that,
and it isn't easy,

635
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:03,079
you will stop
looking and realize

636
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:05,298
you already are happy.

637
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:08,434
To Renee and Ben,

638
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,604
and to remembering.

639
00:33:10,672 --> 00:33:11,672
Cheers.

640
00:33:14,175 --> 00:33:15,558
I love you.

641
00:33:15,627 --> 00:33:17,961
I love you.

642
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:33,910
So, you meant that?

643
00:33:33,979 --> 00:33:37,881
I'm happy.
Right here, right now.

644
00:33:41,553 --> 00:33:45,121
I bet someone like that
could be happy anywhere.

645
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:52,195
Even New York.

646
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:03,539
Again?

647
00:36:20,963 --> 00:36:25,548
<i>Susan Delfino</i>
<i>moved from Wisteria Lane</i>
<i>on a Thursday.</i>

648
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,234
<i>But before she left,</i>

649
00:36:28,302 --> 00:36:31,988
<i>she went to spend</i>
<i>a few more moments</i>
<i>with her friends,</i>

650
00:36:32,057 --> 00:36:34,674
<i>doing what they loved best.</i>

651
00:36:35,894 --> 00:36:39,863
I see your $25,
and I raise you $50.

652
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:44,133
I know you're bluffing.

653
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,384
How?

654
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,848
For the last 10 years,
every time
you have a bad hand,

655
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,472
you tap the side of your glass.

656
00:36:50,859 --> 00:36:51,941
No, I don't.

657
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:53,010
Yeah, you do.

658
00:36:53,078 --> 00:36:55,811
You totally do.
Absolutely.

659
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,648
I have a tell,
and you guys never told me?

660
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:01,217
All right,
you each owe me $12,000.

661
00:37:03,371 --> 00:37:07,990
I just realized this might be
the last time we'll
play poker together.

662
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,325
Don't say that.

663
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:11,294
Well, you're moving,

664
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:13,863
and Lynette's talking about
taking that job in New York.

665
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:15,197
We'll still get together.

666
00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:17,717
I guess. It's just...

667
00:37:18,219 --> 00:37:19,985
What?

668
00:37:20,054 --> 00:37:21,954
I just always had this fantasy.

669
00:37:22,023 --> 00:37:25,542
The four of us staying here,
growing old together.

670
00:37:25,611 --> 00:37:27,677
You know, our grandkids
coming to visit.

671
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:31,214
Me staying gorgeous
while the three of you
age horribly.

672
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:37,164
You know,
she's actually
dreamed about that.

673
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:38,554
Of course she has.

674
00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:41,024
No, seriously,

675
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:45,511
I'm gonna miss this so much.

676
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,297
I'm gonna miss us.

677
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:51,483
It's funny.

678
00:37:51,552 --> 00:37:54,487
Some people never get to know
the folks next door.

679
00:37:54,556 --> 00:37:56,837
They share a fence
and nothing else.

680
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,609
And we've shared everything.

681
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:05,348
How did we get to be so lucky?

682
00:38:05,417 --> 00:38:09,886
I am so crazy nuts
about you guys.

683
00:38:09,955 --> 00:38:11,365
Promise me this is
not the last time

684
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:12,767
we're gonna play poker together.

685
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,223
Absolutely not.

686
00:38:14,293 --> 00:38:15,770
We'll just have
to make the time.

687
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:16,959
Of course we will.

688
00:38:20,448 --> 00:38:23,716
<i>It was a promise
made in all sincerity.</i>

689
00:38:23,785 --> 00:38:27,152
<i>But, sadly,
it was not meant to be.</i>

690
00:38:29,156 --> 00:38:33,926
<i>Lynette and Tom Scavo</i>
<i>left the lane</i>
<i>four weeks later.</i>

691
00:38:36,163 --> 00:38:41,133
<i>They moved to New York</i>
<i>where Lynette learned</i>
<i>the joy of being a CEO.</i>

692
00:38:42,937 --> 00:38:48,958
<i>She and Tom</i>
<i>soon bought a penthouse</i>
<i>overlooking Central Park</i>

693
00:38:49,027 --> 00:38:52,762
<i>where years later</i>
<i>she'd take her</i>
<i>six grandchildren</i>

694
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,531
<i>and yell at them.</i>

695
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:03,172
<i>Gabrielle and Carlos Solis</i>
<i>left the neighborhood</i>
<i>the following year.</i>

696
00:39:03,241 --> 00:39:05,808
<i>This was after
Carlos helped her develop</i>

697
00:39:05,877 --> 00:39:09,078
<i>a personal shopping web site</i>

698
00:39:09,147 --> 00:39:11,781
<i>which led to Gabrielle
getting her own show</i>

699
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,801
<i>on the Home Shopping Network.</i>

700
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:17,203
<i>They soon bought
a mansion in California</i>

701
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:20,706
<i>where they argued
happily ever after.</i>

702
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:24,727
<i>Two years later,</i>

703
00:39:24,796 --> 00:39:28,681
<i>Bree and her new husband
left Fairview.</i>

704
00:39:29,818 --> 00:39:31,484
<i>They moved to Louisville,</i>

705
00:39:31,552 --> 00:39:36,239
<i>where Bree joined a club
for conservative women.</i>

706
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:40,410
<i>Trip then encouraged her
to enter into local politics.</i>

707
00:39:41,646 --> 00:39:43,612
<i>The following November,</i>

708
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:47,300
<i>Bree was elected</i>
<i>to the Kentucky</i>
<i>State Legislature.</i>

709
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:56,843
<i>But Susan Delfino</i>
<i>was the first to move</i>
<i>from Wisteria Lane.</i>

710
00:39:56,911 --> 00:39:59,512
<i>And this is how it ended:</i>

711
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:03,899
<i>she introduced herself to
the woman who was moving in.</i>

712
00:40:04,836 --> 00:40:06,268
You must be Jennifer.

713
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:07,554
And you must be Susan.

714
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:09,588
Nice to meet you.

715
00:40:09,658 --> 00:40:10,857
Sorry if I'm early.

716
00:40:10,925 --> 00:40:12,645
I made better time
than I thought I would.

717
00:40:12,694 --> 00:40:15,094
We were just about to leave.

718
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:16,629
My house is your house.

719
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:20,867
I mean, legally,
this is your house.

720
00:40:25,273 --> 00:40:27,840
Hey, I hope that
you'll be happy here.

721
00:40:27,909 --> 00:40:31,711
Thanks. Steve's so excited to
finally live in the suburbs.

722
00:40:31,779 --> 00:40:33,840
I'm a little worried
it's going to be boring.

723
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:36,115
I wouldn't worry about that.

724
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:38,350
Yeah, this street
is a lot of things.

725
00:40:38,419 --> 00:40:40,086
Boring is not one of them.

726
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:49,495
Can we go now?

727
00:40:49,564 --> 00:40:52,131
Yeah, we're going.

728
00:40:58,139 --> 00:41:01,423
Hey, you guys mind
if I take one last spin
around the block?

729
00:41:02,594 --> 00:41:04,043
Go for it.

730
00:41:08,149 --> 00:41:10,649
<i>As Susan left her driveway,</i>

731
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:13,452
<i>she had a feeling
she was being watched.</i>

732
00:41:14,589 --> 00:41:16,923
<i>And she was.</i>

733
00:41:16,992 --> 00:41:21,193
<i>The ghosts of people</i>
<i>who had been a part</i>
<i>of Wisteria Lane</i>

734
00:41:21,263 --> 00:41:24,947
<i>were gazing upon her
as she passed.</i>

735
00:41:25,016 --> 00:41:29,185
<i>They watched her,
as they watch everyone,</i>

736
00:41:29,254 --> 00:41:31,721
<i>always hoping the living
could learn to</i>

737
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:34,106
<i>put aside rage and sorrow,</i>

738
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:37,092
<i>bitterness and regret.</i>

739
00:41:38,146 --> 00:41:41,047
<i>These ghosts watch,</i>

740
00:41:41,115 --> 00:41:43,365
<i>wanting people to remember</i>

741
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:47,302
<i>that even
the most desperate life</i>

742
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:51,841
<i>is, oh, so wonderful.</i>

743
00:41:59,284 --> 00:42:04,620
<i>But only a lucky few realize
the gift they've been given.</i>

744
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:10,960
<i>Most people just go on,
day after day,</i>

745
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:13,379
<i>trying in vain</i>

746
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:16,015
<i>to keep secrets</i>

747
00:42:17,335 --> 00:42:20,053
<i>that will never stay hidden.</i>
