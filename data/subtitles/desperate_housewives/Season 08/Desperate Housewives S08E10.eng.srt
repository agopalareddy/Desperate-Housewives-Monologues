- Do you think we need a lawyer?
- Lawyers won't be necessary, ladies.

11

- What? Why didn't you stop him?

12
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,700

Come back in the morning.

26
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,000

27
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,900
- open the door.
- Renee?

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,500
You have to the count of three. One...

Ben.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The man you're trying
to steal from me.

34
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,800
I don't understand.

35
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,800
Do you think i won't hit you?

36
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,000
I once slapped a waitress
because she forgot my croutons!

37
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,800
You are dead.

38
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,500

I asked you a question.
Why is there a gun on the table?

46
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,100
No, don't read that.

47

00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,900
hey, mom.
Look who didn't go to paris.

66
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,200
I know.
Your dad had to cancel his trip.

67
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,500
- Because some work meetings came up.
- Nice for us, huh?

68
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,100
Hey, if you guys are done, Why don't you
go grab your books? And i'll drop you off at school.

69
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,300
- Okay.
- All right.

70
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,700
no.

You ever expected to have to deal with--

73
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,500
Yeah, you could say that. How could you
let yourself get involved in this?

74
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,500
It's--It's
gaby and carlos' mess.

75
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,800
I was... helping a friend.

76
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,800
Oh! Helping a friend.

77
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,200
because when i'd ask you
To bring my shirts to the cleaners,

78
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,000
That was always this big hassle,
But burying a body in the woods--

79
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
hey, would you lower your voice?

80
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,500
look, i do not know
What is supposed to happen now.

81
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,100
And what, is chuck gonna just
show up and arrest you? What?

82
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,800
He told gaby that he was starting
A formal investigation this morning,

83
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,600
S-So... yes,
they could arrest me.

84
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,100
Damn it, lynette!
How could you let this happen?!

85
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,900
<i>Out of the four, you're supposed

Yeah, i'll meet you at the car.

- all right.
- okay.

88
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,800

right now, not a lecture.

89
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,500
Okay, you're right.

90
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,700
I'm sorry.

91
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,500
I will find a way
to fix this.

<i>and now the news. Detective charles vance</i>
<i>Was killed last night in fairview square,</i>

How could he just
check himself out?!

97
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,800
As i told you on the phone,
as i replied to your texts,

98
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,400
And as i'm telling you
in person,

99
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,900
This is a rehab center,
not a jail.

100
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,900
Yeah, well, it's not much of a rehab center
If you let patients out in time for happy hour!

101
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,000
Please lower your voice.
you'll wake the crackheads.

102
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,400
I'm sorry, but do you have
any idea how worried i am?

103
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,100
My husband has been gone
all night.

104
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,400
I don't know where he is
or what he's been doing.

105
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,800
Look, even if he did have a relapse,
I'm sure he'll be back soon.

106
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,700
Then we'll call you at home,

107
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,200
So you should go there.

108
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,400
Could you at least
pretend to care?

109
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,000
Not with what i'm paid.

110
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,000
You're making a big mistake,
nursie.

111
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,600
I've got a lot of drunk friends,
And i'm not recommending this place!

00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,800
<i>When he was run down by a dark sedan.</i>

119
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,500
Hello, sunshine.
How you feelin' this mornin'?

120
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,700
Groggy... and nauseous.

121
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,400
Mm. I'm afraid
that's my fault.

122
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,800
I slipped a few sedatives
in your tea last night

123
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,400
And sort of forgot
to say "when."

124
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,000
You drugged me?

125
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,600
I had to make sure
you'd sleep through the night.

126
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,300
Didn't wanna find you sprawled out
On the oriental with your wrists slashed.

127
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,900
Spanish omelet?

128
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,200
If you really want to protect the oriental...
you'll put that away.

129
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,900
<i>Fine. Let me know what
you do like for breakfast,</i>

130
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,900
And i will make that
for you tomorrow.

131
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,200
Tomorrow?
You'll be here tomorrow?

132
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,400
And into the foreseeable future.
Didn't you see my louis vuitton bags upstairs?

133
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,900
I'm moving in.

134
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,600
no, no, no, no, no.
You--You don't have to do that.

135
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,600
After what you tried to do
last night, I don't have a choice.

136
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,600
But i'm fine.

137
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,600
Last night was just
a moment of temporary insanity.

138
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,400
In the light of day,
i feel absolutely...

139
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,700
Did you take the laces
out of all my sneakers?

140
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:14,000
Yeah, and i also got rid of
all your knives, razors,

141
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,600
Pills, cleaning fluid,
and your shower curtain.

142
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,000
How could i kill myself
with a shower curtain?

143
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,600
You can't.
I just thought it was ugly.

144
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,700
Okay. See, this is why
you can't stay here.

145
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,900
you will drive me
absolutely crazy.

146
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,200
Mm. I'd rather see you
in a straitjacket than a coffin.

147
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,400
All right, that's very sweet,
but i am fine now.

148
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:37,000
It's a brand-New morning,
and i am loving life.

149
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,100
Okay.

150
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,300
Now that you are of sound mind,

151
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,700
Why did you want to kill yourself?

152
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,600
It's complicated.

153
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,500
I'm sure it is,

154
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,800
And i'm also sure
i'm not going anywhere

155
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,400
Till i know exactly what made
you bring a gun to that motel.

156
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,400
Renee, please,
this is so unnecessary.

157
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,200
What's wrong?

158
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,600
I... just got some bad news
About your friend,
chuck vance.

159
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,800
Susan?

160
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,900
susan.

161
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,000
Can you help me with my bag?

162
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,500
No! No, nobody's helping her
with her bag.

163
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,200
Mike, you're supposed
to be sleeping.

164
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,700
So are you. Where do
you think you're going?

165
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,300
You know where. New york.

166
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,400
I wrote it all on the note
i left on your nightstand.

167
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,100
- But i thought--
- Looking good, mike.

168
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,800
I thought we discussed
this last night.

169
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,500
You can't just pick
up and leave like this.

170
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,700
You discussed it. I waited
till you went to bed,

171
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,400
And then i... reconfirmed
my plane reservation.

172
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,600
Well, if you're going,
you're going without clothes.

173
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,100
Mike! Wh--

174
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,400
Can you wait a sec?

175
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,900
It feels like you've
packed for a month.

176
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,000
Three weeks.

177
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,800
Felix set up meetings
with gallery owners,

178
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,500
And then if all goes well,
we can discuss moving there.

179
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,900
- I'm not moving to new york.
- Why not?

180
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,600
My plumbing business
is here.

181
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,600
Well, think how much
more exciting it'll be.

182
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,200
You'll be unclogging
pipes in the big city.

183
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,300
Okay, just stop. This is not
about you becoming an artist.

184
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,300
- It's not?
- No.

185
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,000
It's about you running
away from chuck vance.

186
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,800
Okay. You're right.

187
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,300
I'm a mess.

188
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,900
One more interrogation
by chuck,

189
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,900
And i will crack like an egg,
and then i'll go to jail

190
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,600
And take half
the neighborhood with me.

191
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,800
I'm sorry.
I can't risk it.

192
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,400
You have to
let me go.

193
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,200
Hey. What's going on?

194
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,200
Oh, my god.
Chuck's dead?

195
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,500
It was some sort of hit and
run. That's--That's all we know.

196
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,200
So... what happens now?

197
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,400
Nothing. It's all good.

198
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,900
The only person tying us to
alejandro's murder is gone.

199
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,600
Gaby, he was bree's boyfriend.

200
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,400
Yeah, and if she'd dumped
him when i told her,

201
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,200
We wouldn't have gotten in
trouble in the first place.

202
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,500
If you're done,

203
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,400
i think it's time That we ask
the obvious question.

204
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,600
Which is?

205
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,900
Did somebody do
this on purpose?

206
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,800
Oh, my god.
He was murdered?

207
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,300
No! No, no, no, no,
no. It was an accident.

208
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,300
It does seem a bit...
convenient.

209
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,200
Well, maybe god decided
to answer our prayers

210
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,600
Through one of his
drunk-Driving angels on earth.

211
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,300
who are we to
question god?

212
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,800
Look, okay, i admit we were
in a lot of trouble there,

213
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,600
But none of us are that
cold-Blooded, right?

214
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,600
Could it be someone's
trying to protect us?

215
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,500
Oh, my god. Carlos.

216
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,100
- Hey.
- Carlos couldn't have done it.

217
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,000
He's still in rehab, isn't he?

218
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,900
Of course he is!
Oh, my god, you guys.

219
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,900
We finally get a lucky
break. Let's just go with it.

220
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,400
We wanted chuck gone,
and now he's gone.

221
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,900
It's just a coincidence.

222
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,200
Coincidence?

223
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,600
Yes, bree,
coincidences happen,

224
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,400
Otherwise there wouldn't
be a word for them.

225
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,900
So, uh, i guess we should
just put this behind us

226
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,900
And... get back to normal.

227
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,300
Sounds like a plan.

228
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,200
Are we good, susan?

229
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,400
Sure.

230
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,200
Bree?

231
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,900
We all agree this was
just an accident?

232
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,100
If you say so.

233
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,000
Tom?

234
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,200
Tom, i've got big news!

235
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,100
You are not gonna believe
what has happened to--

236
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,100
- Bob?
- What did you do?

237
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,600
- Huh?
- You buried a man in the woods?

238
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,000
She was merely helping a
friend. Don't forget that.

239
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,300
You t-Told bob?

240
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,400
Of course i told bob.
If they arrest you,

241
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,700
You're gonna need an attorney.

242
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,800
Tom, i just found out
that everybody i invited

243
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,100
To my last barbecue
is involved in murder,

244
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,600
And this is water.

245
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,900
Scotch. Coming right up.

246
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:33,100
You shouldn't have done
that. We don't need a lawyer.

247
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,000
We have to prepare
for the worst, lynette.

248
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,500
I am not gonna have the kids visit
you behind bars Next mother's day.

249
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,600
No, no, listen to me.

250
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,400
Chuck vance died
last night.

251
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,900
- What?
- Hit by a car.

252
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,200
Oh, my god! Was
that you guys, too?

253
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,600
No!

254
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,100
Are you serious?

255
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,800
And--And chuck was the only
one who knew about the...

256
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,700
Yeah.

257
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,600
okay.

258
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,600
So, bob...

259
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,400
I guess we're not gonna
need you after all.

260
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,400
But if you want, you can
totally bill me for this hour.

261
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,000
Count on it.

262
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,500
Taking this scotch.

263
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,400
So it's over?

264
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,800
I think so.

265
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,700
Okay, what's wrong?

266
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,700
Huh?

267
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,600
The one man who could have
put us all in jail is gone.

268
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,400
We're home free, but
you're still sitting there,

269
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,900
More depressed than ever.

270
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,400
I'd like to know why.

271
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,600
I don't know.

272
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,400
Are you... upset
that chuck got killed?

273
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,400
A little.

274
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,700
Not so much.

275
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,000
Well, then why are
you getting all misty?

276
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,400
i don't know.

277
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,000
Why don't you?

278
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,900
Why are you getting mad?

279
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,100
Because we've been riding
this emotional roller coaster

280
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,700
For months now,
and i'm ready to get off.

281
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,200
Well, i'm sorry

282
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,000
if i'm not all giggles
and sunshine,

283
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,000
But i am walking around
with a pretty big secret.

284
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,200
So what? Everybody's
got a secret.

285
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,400
Not as big as mine.
I helped bury a body.

286
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,200
And our mechanic
does crystal meth.

287
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,700
Our butcher beats
up homeless guys,

288
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,200
And the librarian's
a nymphomaniac.

289
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,700
The world is filled

290
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,400
With ordinary people
that do nasty things.

291
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,400
So man up or
dump the guilt.

292
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,500
Let's get on
with our lives.

293
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,100
I know you're right. Uh...

294
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,400
It makes no sense for
me to be depressed,

295
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,400
And i know alejandro
was a bad guy.

296
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,000
And he deserved to die.

297
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,900
He did. He absolutely did.

298
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,800
Why are you still so...

299
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,500
I don't know.

300
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,000
But i'll figure it out. I swear.

301
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,100
Thank you.

302
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,600
Our librarian's a nymphomaniac?

303
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,900
I made that up.

304
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,200
'Cause i always got a vibe.

305
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,800
Let's just eat.

306
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,700
- Detective murphy
- Yeah.

307
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,800
Hi. I just wanted to stop
by and say how sorry i was

308
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,900
To hear about officer vance.

309
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,700
It's so tragic. Any idea
who could have done this?

310
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,900
Who are you?

311
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,500
Oh, i'm gabrielle solis.

312
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,100
I met chuck through his
girlfriend, bree van de kamp.

313
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,500
She's a friend of mine.

314
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,200
Woman's a first
class bitch.

315
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:47,100
Who i rarely talk to
'cause of the bitch thing.

316
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,500
Ahem. So, um,

317
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,100
were there any witnesses?

318
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,500
Everyone here knows
what she did to chuck--

319
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,100
Led him on and then broke
his heart like it was nothing.

320
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,500
Can't believe he
wanted to marry her.

321
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,100
Yeah, i know. Marrying bree
would have been the worst thing

322
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,400
To ever happen to him.

323
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,900
Well, second worst.

324
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,200
So any clues--
Anything at all?

325
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,700
Not yet. Excuse me.

326
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,700
Um...

327
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,500
Well, you know what
i think happened?

328
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,000
- Drunk teenagers hitting people with cars.
- Yeah.

329
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,800
It's a rite of passage with
them, like spring break.

330
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,700
If i were you guys, i'd
be checking the grills

331
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,800
Of every acne-Covered kid
within a 100-Mile radius.

332
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,700
It wasn't an accident.

333
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,700
It wasn't?

334
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,300
There were no
skid marks,

335
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,400
No attempt to
slow down or swerve.

336
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,500
Whoever did this
was gunning for chuck.

337
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,600
So... anyone get
the make of the car

338
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,900
Or... race of the driver?

339
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,100
No, ma'am, but we're monitoring
every body shop in the state.

340
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,800
Oh. Okay.

341
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,000
Don't worry. A cop was killed.

342
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,500
We'll find whoever's responsible,

343
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:57,400
And when we do, they
are gonna pay, big-Time.

344
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,200
Okay.

345
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,800
I'll be sure to tell bree.

346
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,100
That bitch!

347
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,000
How's the history
project coming?

348
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,500
Good. I'm drawing a picture
of lincoln's assassination.

349
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:22,400
Um... sweetie, i don't think
he was shot with a stapler.

350
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,100
That's a gun, and i
think we're done here.

351
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,400
Sorry for just dropping
by without calling,

352
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,600
Especially with the way things
have been between us lately.

353
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,600
What's wrong?

354
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,800
It's this whole
chuck thing.

355
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,100
Hey, penny, would you
mind throwing those clothes

356
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,800
In the washing
machine for me?

357
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Sure.

358
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,700
Thanks.

359
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,100
Come on in.

360
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,500
You don't think it was
an accident, do you?

361
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,500
No. Who could do
something like that?

362
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,500
It had to be someone who
was trying to protect us.

363
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,100
But that means they would
have to know about what we did.

364
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,100
Who else knows? I mean, other
than the four of us and carlos?

365
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,700
Well, susan told mike.

366
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,600
- And i told ben.
- And i told tom.

367
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,400
- You told tom?
- Well, you told ben.

368
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,100
Okay, so ben and mike and
tom, but that's it, right?

369
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,600
No one else has
been told?

370
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,600
No one.

371
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,400
Except tom told bob.

372
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,500
We're gonna need
to write this down.

373
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,700
Okay, the people who
were there are in orange.

374
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,800
The people who were told
by people who were there

375
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,500
Are in blue, and the green
arrows represent Who told whom.

376
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,600
Wow. We may be good
at arts and crafts,

377
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,600
But we suck at conspiracy.
What's the purple question mark?

378
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,100
That's whoever wrote the letter.

379
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,300
You think they killed chuck?

380
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,500
Who knows? We're not sure why
the letter was sent In the first place.

381
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,800
"I know what you did.
It makes me sick.

382
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,100
I'm going to tell"?
Sounds like a threat to me.

383
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,700
But why kill someone else
who has the same goal?

384
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,400
It doesn't make any sense.

385
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,400
None of it makes any sense.
I mean, we know these people.

386
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,200
None of them would commit
a cold-Blooded murder.

387
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,800
Oh, god.

388
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:02,000
Oh, god. What if someone else knows?

389
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,600
Hey. How are the girls?

390
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,900
Juanita demanded ice cream for lunch.

391
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,900
What'd you say?

392
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,400
She's bigger than me.
What do you think i said?

393
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,300
And don't give me that look.
You said you'd be home by feeding time.

394
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,000
Sorry. I've been all over town
looking for my husband.

395
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,400
Carlos went a.W.O.L. From rehab last
night, And i have no idea where he is.

396
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,100
Want a hint?

397
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,300
You know?

398
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,900
He dragged his can upstairs
about two hours ago,

399
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,500
Drunk as a red sox pitcher
in the bottom of the 9th.

400
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,600
Karen, i don't know how to thank you.

401
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,800
I'm on a fixed income.
Let's use our imagination?

402
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,900
Oh, thank god! I was so worried!
Where were you last night?

403
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:52,700
You can tell me the truth. I won't
judge. I'll be totally supportive.

404
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,700
Wake up, you pathetic boozehound!
Where the hell were you last night?!

405
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,000
Oh, where am i now?

406
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,900
Ohh! I'm home!

407
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,300
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Open your eyes. Focus.

408
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,500
Okay, after you checked yourself
out of rehab, You got in the car.

409
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,900
Where did you go?

410
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,700
I drove to a bar.

411
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,800
I drank a lot of shots...

412
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,700
And i don't remember much else.

413
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,500
Do you remember killing someone?

414
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Huh?

415
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,100
Oh, look who's sober now.

416
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,800
What are you talking about?

417
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:27,100
chuck vance was killed last night
By a hit and run driver.

418
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,000
Chuck's dead?

419
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,600
And you think i did it?

420
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,500
Well...

421
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,000
You think i killed someone?

422
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,700
Ahem. Alejandro.

423
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It's not like potato chips, gaby!

424
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,200
You were upset, and you were drinking.
He was hit on lake street.

425
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,100
That's only a few blocks
from the rehab center.

426
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,200
I don't remember.

427
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,300
You have to.
The police are all over this thing.

428
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,500
They're looking for witnesses.
They're trying to find the car.

429
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,900
Oh, wait. That's it. The car.

430
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:02,200
All we have to do is check the car.
If you hit him, it'll be obvious.

431
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,200
Honey, where's your car?

432
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,500
That's a really good question.

433
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,600
Why did you turn the light on?

434
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,400
I'm checking up on you. How you doing?

435
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,100
Fine.

436
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,100
Really? 'Cause last night
you were suicidal,

437
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,200
And that was before you found out
Your boyfriend was dead.

438
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,100
I would think you'd be
an emotional mess Right about now.

439
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,600
It's been an interesting couple of days,
But i'm holding my own.

440
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,100
See, here's my problem.

441
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,600
I don't believe you.

442
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,500
You don't have to believe me.

443
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,700
All you have to do is turn off the light
As you leave the room.

444
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,600
Bree, you need to talk about this.

445
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,600
Repressing your feelings is not healthy.

446
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,000
And since when are you a therapist?

447
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,500
Uh, excuse me. I took intro to psych

448
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,600
And once slept with my shrink.
I think i'm qualified.

449
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,000
Well, as impressive as
those credentials are,

450
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,100
My feelings are not your concern.

451
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,700
They became my concern
when i caught you

452
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:23,000
About to swallow the business
end of a smith & wesson.

453
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,800
Now i'm not leaving this room

454
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,000
until you tell me why.

455
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,800
I can't.

456
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,100
Other people are involved--
People that you know.

457
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:39,600
Well... i can keep my mouth shut.

458
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,400
Renee...

459
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,400
Oh, you can trust me.
We're friends, right?

460
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,500
Not really.

461
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,700
Not really?

462
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,700
I'm not trying to be rude.
Yes, i mean, we're--

463
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,500
Well, we socialize. You've been
to my home. I've been to yours.

464
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,900
We're friendly,
But that doesn't make us friends.

465
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,200
Okay.

466
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,700
You know what i mean.

467
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,900
You and i don't
talk about important things.

468
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,700
We've never had a deep conversation.
We're not...

469
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,600
Friends.

470
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:17,000
And now i've upset you,
and that wasn't my intention.

471
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,400
Don't worry about me. I'm fine.

472
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,000
And by the way,

473
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I don't think you have any friends.

474
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,200
In fact, i don't think
you care about anyone at all,

475
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,800
Because if you did,
you never would have considered

476
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,200
Splattering your brains
against the wall Of some cheap motel.

477
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:39,400
Okay, that's it.
Would you please get out of my house?

478
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,500
No!

479
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,400
Not until i'm convinced you are
no longer A danger to yourself.

480
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:48,500
I will not allow anyone
to kill themselves, Not on my watch.

481
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,700
I will not go through that again.

482
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,600
This is a funeral.
You have got to stop smiling.

483
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,600
Sorry. I'm just so relieved.

484
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,900
I really thought
i was dead in the water there.

485
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,100
Yeah, we were very lucky.

486
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,600
Listen, i can't thank you enough
For everything you have done for me.

487
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,200
It's no big deal.

488
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,500
One minute
you're boarding a plane to paris,

489
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,400
Then the next, you rush to my side.

490
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,000
Well, you do know
in spite of everything,

491
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,200
You still mean the world to me?

492
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,600
If i didn't before, i do now.

493
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,400
Hey, I-I know it's not paris,

494
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,400
But you wanna come over later
for movie night with the kids?

495
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,100
That'd be great.

496
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,700
I'll bring a pizza
so you don't have to cook.

497
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,500
Fantastic.

498
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,000
Lynette.

499
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,200
Sorry.

500
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,200
Here you go, dear.

501
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,300
Oh. Thank you.

502
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,300
I can't believe i forgot
to bring tissue to a funeral.

503
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,600
Oh, you keep it.

504
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:45,200
I don't really cry at funerals,
Not anymore.

505
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,200
No?

506
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,000
No. Well, when you're young,

507
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,200
Death always comes as such a shock,

508
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,900
As if the universe is unfair.

509
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,000
But when you get to my age,

510
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
You realize that death
is just the end of the story.

511
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,600
The phone call comes.

512
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,200
You shed a few tears,

513
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:09,400
And then you get together
And celebrate the life that was.

514
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,600
That's it.

515
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,600
- What?
- Thank you so much!

516
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:16,400
You will never know
how helpful you've been.

517
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,300
Oh, i'm so glad.

518
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,900
Were you close with my nephew?

519
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,600
- Oh, no.
- Oh.

520
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,700
Ah. But he did interrogate me once.

521
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,500
He did a lovely job.

522
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,200
Hey, gaby, have you got a minute?

523
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,500
listen. What was alejandro's alias?

524
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,100
seriously?
We're talking about this here?

525
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,900
Chuck told me in my interrogation,
But i can't remember.

526
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,700
- Pablo? Paco?
- Ramon sanchez.

527
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,800
Right, right, and he was living in...

528
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:50,900
(Lowered voice) 

529
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,000
oklahoma city.
What do you need this for?

530
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,200
I... w-Wanna light a candle for him,

531
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,200
And i thought
i should know all of his names.

532
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,400
You only light candles
for people who you want to bless.

533
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,300
That's right, and he was a bad guy.

534
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,000
I'm gonna go blow out that candle.

535
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
What the hell are we doing here?
There are cops everywhere.

536
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,600
It's a cop funeral.
What'd you expect? Clowns?

537
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,200
I am taking a huge risk by being here.

538
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:22,800
No, you're paying your respects.
That's what innocent people do.

539
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,200
Okay.

540
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:30,300
If i'm so innocent,
Then why is that cop staring at me?

541
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,600
Just stop acting so guilty.

542
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,700
He takes one look at your face,
And you say--

543
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,100
Hi, officer.

544
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,800
Hello. Carlos, right? Remember me?

545
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,900
No.

546
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,200
I'm not surprised.

547
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:48,300
You were pretty wasted When you
came into the station the other night.

548
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,300
you went to the police station?

549
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,500
Yeah. He said he wanted
to make a confession--

550
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,300
Something about
beating somebody with a candlestick?

551
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,900
Oh, carlos,
you shouldn't have done that.

552
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,000
What else did he say?

553
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,600
Well, that's when the news
came in about detective vance,

554
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,500
And, uh, all hell broke loose.

555
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,500
By the time things settled, he was gone.

556
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,900
So who's this person you assaulted?

557
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,900
Oh! Uh...

558
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,300
That would be me.

559
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,800
You?

560
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,400
Yeah. I'm a bit of a handful.

561
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,300
You hit your wife with a candlestick?

562
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,800
He hit me back.

563
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,500
In his defense, i'd just
popped him with a baseball bat.

564
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,600
So do you wanna file charges?

565
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,600
Or do you?

566
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,700
Oh! We're good.

567
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,400
This thing we got
isn't pretty, but it works.

568
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,800
So who was it?

569
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,600
Who was what?

570
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:00,700
the person you knew
who committed suicide.

571
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,500
That's something
i only discuss with friends.

572
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,100
It was my mother.

573
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,900
She'd tried it once before.

574
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,700
Pills.

575
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,100
But i found her in time.

576
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:28,100
And then... one morning
i saw that look in her eyes again.

577
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,400
Not... sad, just...

578
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,700
Empty.

579
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,200
She swore to me she'd be fine, so i...

580
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,000
I went to school.

581
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,800
And by the time i got back...

582
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,900
Well... how was i supposed to know
She was gonna pull it off this time?

583
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,600
Oh, Renee, i am so sorry.

584
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,600
yeah.

585
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,400
That's what the note said--
"I'm sorry."

586
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,400
That's it.

587
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,600
I don't have a mom
for the rest of my life,

588
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,100
And she thinks those two little words...

589
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,200
Are gonna make up for that?

590
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,000
Many years ago,

591
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,800
A neighbor and a good friend of ours...

592
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,000
Took her life.

593
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,700
And that left us
all heartbroken

594
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,700
and perplexed.

595
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
But somehow, when i was alone
in that hotel room,

596
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,600
I forgot about all the pain she caused.

597
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,900
In those awful moments,

598
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,700
I thought maybe she had the answer.

599
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:14,500
But then you showed up. Thank god.

600
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:22,700
You will always be the person
who saved my life.

601
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:27,100
And now that i've had time
to think about it...

602
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:32,100
I realize that makes you
the best friend i'll ever have.

603
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:57,500
Hey! Look who's here
with a pizza and a dvd.

604
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,000
Ooh, mario's. That's excellent.

605
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,300
Mom, you let dad pick out the movie?

606
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,900
Hey, my taste in movies
is as good as my taste in pizza.

607
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,500
Great, that means the pizza's gonna
be black and white And three hours long.

608
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,900
Oh, excuse me.

609
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,100
"Citizen kane," "marty," "casablanca"--

610
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,800
What do all these movies have in common?

611
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,400
We fell asleep during them?

612
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,100
They're classics.

613
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,500
"Here's looking at you, kid."

614
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,600
Here's looking at my iphone, dad.

615
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,000
Hey! Be nice.

616
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,600
I'm sure your dad picked out
Something really fun this time.

617
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,700
What'd you get?

618
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,700
"Old yeller."

619
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,200
Oh, tom, you make this so hard.

620
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,600
Why? What i've seen of it is great.

621
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,600
My folks always sent me to bed
before the ending.

622
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,500
Is there--Is there
swearing or something?

623
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,000
Eh. Something. How about we eat?

624
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,600
Huh.

625
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,600
Everything good?

626
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,600
Yeah. It's just,

627
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:51,700
you never remember
i like the thin crust.

628
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,100
But it doesn't matter.
Thank you for getting it.

629
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,000
Who's hungry?

630
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,400
- mmm.
- oh, i am.

631
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,100
Good news. The police found the car.

632
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,200
You left it in their parking lot.

633
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,600
Thank god.

634
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:13,500
Mrs. Mccluskey's gonna drive us
over there after breakfast,

635
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:17,000
Then i will drive you back to rehab.

636
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,500
Sounds like a plan.

637
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,100
Babe.

638
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,400
I'm sorry about all this.

639
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,400
I know i've put you
and the kids through so much.

640
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,500
I'm gonna try and get back here
as soon as i can.

641
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,100
You forget about us.

642
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:49,200
You just worry about getting better.
I can hold down the fort. No problem.

643
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,200
I have something else
i need to tell you.

644
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,200
What's that?

645
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,200
I love you.

646
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,700
I know you know that.

647
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,700
I just don't think
we say it enough.

648
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,000
I love you, too.

649
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,700
One more thing.

650
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,400
What?

651
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:35,500
<i>If you ever go
to the police again</i>

652
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,000
And confess something
without talking to me first,

653
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I will be burying
another body in the woods.

654
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,000
You got it?

655
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:51,200
Good.
I'll see you in the morning.

656
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,700
Hey, you want a beer?

657
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,500
Oh, you got the belgian kind?

658
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,600
- <i>I love that stuff.</i>
- I know.

659
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,700
Thanks for clearing the table.

660
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,000
i believe that has been
the hardest part Of our separation.

661
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,200
God, for me?
It's the laundry.

662
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:17,200
- I-I found out i am more
inclined to buy new socks...
- Ah.

663
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,400
Than to wash the dirty ones.

664
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:24,400
Hey, thanks again for giving up your trip.
It really meant a lot to me.

665
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,000
No problem.

666
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:31,200
<i>And please apologize
to jane.</i>

667
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,900
She must be furious.

668
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
i doubt it.
She's not really like that.

669
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,400
Tom, i know women.

670
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:41,600
There's a lynette voodoo doll Being
dropped off the eiffel tower as we speak.

671
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,300
no, it's weird,
but, uh,

672
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,100
Jane doesn't hang on to anger.

673
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,600
Ah. Uh, okay.

674
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,900
You don't--You don't-- You don't know her.
She's-- She's very forgiving.

675
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,900
Ah. Fine. Got it.
She's terrific.

676
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,300
Well, i'll give you an example. She would never
criticize the pizza i brought over.

677
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,500
What?

678
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:06,600
Well, you had to point out that
i didn't get the thin crust.

679
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:09,300
I know, i know.
The second i said it,

680
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,500
I realized i shouldn't have.
It just... came out.

681
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,600
Exactly. It's just a--
It's a reflex for you.

682
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,900
You can't help it.

683
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,300
Well...

684
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,700
Maybe that's because i keep hoping
If i say something enough,

685
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,900
you'll finally hear me.
I mean...

686
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,300
23 years of telling you
the kind of pizza i like,

687
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,200
And it still doesn't occur
to you to get it.

688
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,400
It makes me feel like
i don't matter.

689
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,500
Wow, i didn't realize.

690
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,000
I know.

691
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,200
I shouldn't have compared you to jane.

692
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,700
that wasn't right.

693
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,600
That's okay.

694
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,900
She's really good to you,
huh?

695
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,100
Then i think you should go to paris.

696
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,400
What?

697
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:26,800
Yeah.

698
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,500
'Cause otherwise, you'll always wonder
If she could make you happy.

699
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,400
And didn't we say that was
the point of us separating?

700
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,500
Could i still stay
and watch the movie?

701
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,400
Of course.

702
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,100
susan?

703
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,800
You gotta be kidding me.

704
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,400
Susan, what do you think
you're doing?

705
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,500
Oh, i remember this house.

706
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,600
The half naked guy runs out,
and i don't get my fare.

707
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:46,500
- Here. Huh?
- Oh, no, no, put that back.
You'll get your fare this time.

708
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,800
Honey, i'm sorry,
but i have to go.

709
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
- I-It's all in my note.
- What is it with you and notes lately?

710
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,500
You were asleep when i came home
from the funeral.

711
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,000
Well, if you're taking off
to new york, you wake me up!

712
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,800
i'm not going to new york.
I'm going to oklahoma.

713
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:03,500
And now i'm... just confused.

714
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,700
okay, two minutes.

715
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,600
you asked me why
i still feel so guilty.

716
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:17,800
I finally figured it out.
He got a phone call.

717
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,400
- Who got a phone call?
- Alejandro.

718
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,800
When we were putting his body
into the ground,His phone rang.

719
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,500
Do you know what that means?

720
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,700
He had really good
cell phone service?

721
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:32,700
It means he has a family,
And they have no idea where he is.

722
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,100
It must be
tearing them apart.

723
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:38,600
<i>I mean, he did something horrible,
not them.</i>

724
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,500
They shouldn't have to suffer, too.

725
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,000
And what exactly are you
gonna do about it?

726
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,100
I'm not sure yet.

727
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:52,400
I just know i have to see
if they're okay.

728
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,400
I think it's the only way
I'm ever getting back to normal.

729
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,800
well, then i guess
you gotta go.

730
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,100
Hey! Where are you off to?

731
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:33,400
I'm just...
visiting some family.

732
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:36,600
Oh, that sounds like fun.
Well, have a good trip.

733
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,300
<i>It's a lonely business
keeping secrets.</i>

734
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:47,700
<i>That's why we all search for
someone we can confide in...</i>

735
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,400
<i>An ally who will understand.</i>

736
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,900
<i>An advisor we can trust.</i>

737
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:08,300
<i>A friend who will never judge.</i>

738
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,800
<i>Yes, we all need help hiding</i>

739
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,500
<i>The darkest truths of our lives.</i>

740
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,000
<i>Because as soon
as you've told one secret...</i>

741
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:31,900
<i>Another is likely to appear.</i>
