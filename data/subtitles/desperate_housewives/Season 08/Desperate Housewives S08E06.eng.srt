1
00:00:03,914 --> 00:00:07,130
In therapy, the subject
was Tom's new girlfriend.

2
00:00:07,131 --> 00:00:09,390
What about sex? 
Not yet.

3
00:00:09,391 --> 00:00:12,384
I... he wants to end the marriage.

4
00:00:12,385 --> 00:00:14,337
Susan wanted to quit...

5
00:00:14,371 --> 00:00:15,805
Maybe I'm not a real artist.

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,691
This class has been really good for you.

7
00:00:17,982 --> 00:00:20,712
But decided to face the challenge instead.

8
00:00:21,213 --> 00:00:22,081
You're hiding something,

9
00:00:22,082 --> 00:00:23,448
and I'm gonna pull it out of you.

10
00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:26,737
There is a chance that you might
actually become an artist.

11
00:00:26,738 --> 00:00:29,457
Carlos tried to drown his guilt...

12
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,193
Carlos!

13
00:00:31,194 --> 00:00:32,007
Hey, Gaby.

14
00:00:33,323 --> 00:00:36,133
And Ben showed Bree the
site where construction

15
00:00:36,134 --> 00:00:37,485
was about to begin.

16
00:00:37,486 --> 00:00:39,022
Have you ever been here before?

17
00:00:42,222 --> 00:00:43,646
Once.

18
00:00:43,671 --> 00:00:53,871

19
00:00:55,879 --> 00:00:57,714
Paranoia...

20
00:00:59,283 --> 00:01:03,519
It's the irrational fear
that someone is after you...

21
00:01:08,388 --> 00:01:11,894
That you're going to be
exposed at any moment.

22
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:17,526
Paranoia can sneak up on you...

23
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,139
Causing you to stumble at every turn.

24
00:01:26,176 --> 00:01:29,479
And just when you think
you're in the clear...

25
00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:33,516
And the danger has passed...

26
00:01:34,752 --> 00:01:36,753
Paranoia reminds you...

27
00:01:36,787 --> 00:01:38,588
Gaby?

28
00:01:38,622 --> 00:01:40,790
Lynette?

29
00:01:40,824 --> 00:01:44,660
That no place is truly safe.

30
00:01:45,195 --> 00:01:47,130
Oh, my God.

31
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,172
Where'd he go? 
Is he gone?

32
00:01:54,672 --> 00:01:56,187
For now, but we gotta hurry.

33
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,400
I think we're close. I recognize this area.

34
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,777
God, this is creeping me out.

35
00:02:00,811 --> 00:02:02,378
Well, it doesn't help that it's Halloween.

36
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:04,638
Let's just dig him up
and get this over with.

37
00:02:04,915 --> 00:02:05,931
Ladies?

38
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:07,949
Ladies!

39
00:02:08,185 --> 00:02:09,022
Bree?

40
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:15,392
Bree? 
Honey? Are you okay?

41
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,814
Paranoia--

44
00:02:27,137 --> 00:02:30,139
it can still scare you to death.

45
00:02:30,174 --> 00:02:31,682
No!

46
00:02:51,795 --> 00:02:55,541
Susan Delfino had always
been a great student.

47
00:02:56,946 --> 00:03:00,927
That's because she knew how
to be the teacher's pet.

48
00:03:01,836 --> 00:03:03,785
Some liked gifts.

49
00:03:05,491 --> 00:03:07,609
Some liked extra credit.

50
00:03:09,837 --> 00:03:12,648
And some just liked her.

51
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,125
But in her new class,

52
00:03:17,126 --> 00:03:19,785
Susan would learn that not every teacher...

53
00:03:19,786 --> 00:03:20,911
Happy Halloween.

54
00:03:21,687 --> 00:03:23,825
Was in the market for a pet.

55
00:03:24,357 --> 00:03:26,054
I thought you might like a little treat

56
00:03:26,055 --> 00:03:27,550
complete with candy corn.

57
00:03:28,111 --> 00:03:29,416
Who doesn't like candy corn?

58
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,103
Apparently you.

59
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:40,345
It appears some of you have remembered

60
00:03:40,346 --> 00:03:42,613
today is the day I select my intern.

61
00:03:42,614 --> 00:03:43,818
Oh, is that today?

62
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:45,353
I have a commission due Tuesday,

63
00:03:45,354 --> 00:03:47,430
and I need all the help
I can get this weekend.

64
00:03:47,431 --> 00:03:50,507
Now this is obviously a prestigious honor.

65
00:03:50,508 --> 00:03:51,720
That goes without saying.

66
00:03:51,721 --> 00:03:54,167
And it won't be awarded
based on brownnosing,

67
00:03:54,168 --> 00:03:56,077
bootlicking or cupcake making.

68
00:03:56,577 --> 00:03:58,072
That about covers all your moves.

69
00:03:58,073 --> 00:04:00,862
My decision will be made solely on talent,

70
00:04:00,863 --> 00:04:04,284
experience, and who irritates me the least.

71
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:05,261
Oh, crap.

72
00:04:05,262 --> 00:04:07,922
And that's why--
Stand up, Amy.

73
00:04:09,162 --> 00:04:10,559
I've chosen...

74
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,717
Susan Delfino.

75
00:04:14,396 --> 00:04:15,757
Sit down, Amy.

76
00:04:15,758 --> 00:04:16,942
That was fun.

77
00:04:16,943 --> 00:04:17,801
Me?

78
00:04:18,231 --> 00:04:20,609
Meet me at 5:00 tomorrow.
We'll discuss your duties.

79
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:23,418
Thank you so much. I-I'm so grateful.

80
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:27,027
But could we make it 5:15?
My son has soccer practice--

81
00:04:27,028 --> 00:04:28,142
I have no kids.

82
00:04:29,065 --> 00:04:30,722
And he's not very good
so he won't be going.

83
00:04:30,723 --> 00:04:31,908
See you at 5:00.

84
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,103
Hey, babe. How you doing?

85
00:04:42,005 --> 00:04:43,079
Fine.

86
00:04:44,352 --> 00:04:45,245
Good.

87
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,052
Great.

88
00:04:48,328 --> 00:04:49,256
Glad to hear it.

89
00:04:58,154 --> 00:04:59,759
Would you like your own cup?

90
00:05:01,365 --> 00:05:02,368
Sorry.

91
00:05:03,661 --> 00:05:04,575
Just...

92
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:07,074
That night really scared
the hell out of me.

93
00:05:07,826 --> 00:05:09,040
Scared me, too.

94
00:05:09,552 --> 00:05:11,236
Yeah, but you haven't
done anything about it.

95
00:05:11,237 --> 00:05:12,986
I thought you were gonna check out
an A.A. meeting.

96
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:14,845
Gaby, I'm not an alcoholic.

97
00:05:14,846 --> 00:05:16,515
Tell that to the cab driver who helped me

98
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:17,953
carry you inside the house.

99
00:05:17,954 --> 00:05:21,283
Fine. If it will keep your
fingers out of my coffee,

100
00:05:21,284 --> 00:05:22,600
I'll go to a meeting.

101
00:05:22,601 --> 00:05:23,924
Thank you.

102
00:05:25,903 --> 00:05:26,642
I love you.

103
00:05:28,386 --> 00:05:29,862
We're gonna get through this, okay?

104
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,524
Oh! And do me a favor.

105
00:05:33,525 --> 00:05:35,299
If it turns out you are an alcoholic,

106
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,189
promise you won't be one
of those whiny ones.

107
00:05:46,716 --> 00:05:48,411
Okay, we gotta talk.

108
00:05:49,386 --> 00:05:50,799
Oh, God, he brought Jane?

109
00:05:55,716 --> 00:05:58,468
Hey, sweetie. How was your dad's?

110
00:05:58,469 --> 00:05:59,450
It was fun.

111
00:05:59,451 --> 00:06:00,117
Good.

112
00:06:00,981 --> 00:06:03,530
Look. It's my Halloween costume.

113
00:06:04,142 --> 00:06:04,973
I'm gonna be a swan.

114
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:07,419
Right. How about you be something

115
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,261
mommy can actually make, like a ghost

116
00:06:09,262 --> 00:06:11,849
or a 13-year-old American teenager?

117
00:06:12,401 --> 00:06:14,990
You don't have to make it.
Jane said she would.

118
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:18,834
Of course she did.

119
00:06:19,537 --> 00:06:23,872
Well, I should go thank her
for helping me to parent you.

120
00:06:26,472 --> 00:06:29,743
Jane, it's okay.
You don't have to stay in the car.

121
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,924
Or maybe you should.

122
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:35,265
I mean, I don't wanna show
you up with my fancy sweats.

123
00:06:35,266 --> 00:06:37,221
Oh, stop. You look great.

124
00:06:37,222 --> 00:06:39,640
Look, I think it's sweet
that you volunteered

125
00:06:39,641 --> 00:06:41,073
to help Penny make her costume.

126
00:06:41,074 --> 00:06:42,518
Hey, I hope I didn't overstep.

127
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:44,245
You know, it's just, before medical school,

128
00:06:44,246 --> 00:06:46,061
I dabbled a bit in fashion design.

129
00:06:46,934 --> 00:06:48,430
- Of course you did.
- It's nothing.

130
00:06:48,431 --> 00:06:50,055
Couple of semesters in Paris.

131
00:06:50,867 --> 00:06:53,539
Ah, Paris. C'est la plus
belle ville du monde, no?

132
00:06:54,031 --> 00:06:55,416
Oui. Oui, oui. Yes.

133
00:06:55,417 --> 00:06:57,292
She's-- she's teaching me.

134
00:06:58,848 --> 00:07:00,002
Of course she is.

135
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:02,424
Anyway, making Penny's Halloween costume

136
00:07:02,425 --> 00:07:04,975
is sort of a... mother/daughter tradition.

137
00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:07,113
Since when?

138
00:07:07,905 --> 00:07:09,159
Since always.

139
00:07:10,173 --> 00:07:13,697
Actually, I started it already,
and I don't want to oversell,

140
00:07:13,698 --> 00:07:15,180
but it's gonna be pretty great.

141
00:07:15,181 --> 00:07:16,873
I'm sorry. She didn't say anything.

142
00:07:16,874 --> 00:07:18,761
I'm sure she didn't want
to hurt your feelings.

143
00:07:18,762 --> 00:07:21,543
Well, if you change your mind,
it's really no trouble.

144
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:23,667
I've already made a bunch of costumes

145
00:07:23,668 --> 00:07:24,934
for the kids in the cancer ward.

146
00:07:28,816 --> 00:07:29,932
Of course she did.

147
00:07:33,674 --> 00:07:35,211
Oh, God. You're closing the curtains.

148
00:07:35,212 --> 00:07:35,837
This can't be good.

149
00:07:35,838 --> 00:07:37,632
It isn't. I just heard the details

150
00:07:37,633 --> 00:07:39,728
of Ben's latest real estate project.

151
00:07:39,729 --> 00:07:41,810
- Mom! 
- Oh, honey, not right now.

152
00:07:41,811 --> 00:07:42,744
We're talking.

153
00:07:43,346 --> 00:07:44,832
You told me to try on my costume.

154
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,377
You said you'd fix the yolk.

155
00:07:46,869 --> 00:07:48,384
Oh, this is will take two seconds.

156
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,134
Celia's going as bacon.

157
00:07:54,135 --> 00:07:55,870
This works a lot better
when we're together.

158
00:07:57,676 --> 00:07:59,231
So what were you guys talking about?

159
00:08:02,051 --> 00:08:03,664
Um, I was just telling your mother

160
00:08:03,665 --> 00:08:07,731
a very scary Halloween story
about these four witches

161
00:08:07,732 --> 00:08:09,891
who buried a monster deep in the woods.

162
00:08:10,653 --> 00:08:11,745
Cool.

163
00:08:11,746 --> 00:08:12,840
And after they buried the monster,

164
00:08:12,841 --> 00:08:13,842
they went on with their lives

165
00:08:13,843 --> 00:08:17,174
until this big, frightening real
estate developer came along

166
00:08:17,685 --> 00:08:18,749
and decided to build condos

167
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,569
right where the monster was buried!

168
00:08:21,862 --> 00:08:24,500
- Ow!
- Oh! Sorry, sorry.

169
00:08:24,501 --> 00:08:25,883
Are you sure?

170
00:08:25,884 --> 00:08:27,219
Yeah. Witches always lie.

171
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,813
- Not this witch. 
- Ha.

172
00:08:28,814 --> 00:08:30,238
Well, I think one of those witches

173
00:08:30,239 --> 00:08:32,367
better go see what she can
do to kill the project.

174
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,583
How?!

175
00:08:33,584 --> 00:08:35,140
I don't know. It's your story.

176
00:08:35,924 --> 00:08:36,998
Fine.

177
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:43,568
Yeah. That actually was
kind of a lame story.

178
00:08:43,569 --> 00:08:44,934
It wasn't even scary.

179
00:08:46,579 --> 00:08:49,912
Trust me, honey.
It is really, really scary.

180
00:09:04,943 --> 00:09:05,784
Hi.

181
00:09:06,768 --> 00:09:09,075
Sorry I've been A.W.O.L.
for the past t two week,

182
00:09:09,076 --> 00:09:10,026
but, uh, that's only 'cause I--

183
00:09:10,027 --> 00:09:13,268
I'm sorry. Have we met? Ben, is it?

184
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:14,774
I know, I know. I...

185
00:09:15,204 --> 00:09:17,151
I've been swamped getting
my new project under way.

186
00:09:17,152 --> 00:09:19,379
But I wanna make it up to you.

187
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:20,732
How?

188
00:09:20,733 --> 00:09:23,192
Tomorrow night, my place, dinner for two,

189
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:25,060
cooked by one.

190
00:09:26,344 --> 00:09:27,327
Tomorrow's Halloween.

191
00:09:27,328 --> 00:09:28,901
So? It'll be fun.

192
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,493
We can, uh, pass out candy
to trick-or-treaters.

193
00:09:32,223 --> 00:09:33,112
And then maybe later,

194
00:09:33,113 --> 00:09:35,870
we can... trick a little... treat of our...

195
00:09:37,235 --> 00:09:38,712
I don't know where I was going with that.

196
00:09:39,774 --> 00:09:41,620
All right, you want a date with me?

197
00:09:41,621 --> 00:09:42,536
Yeah.

198
00:09:43,348 --> 00:09:44,473
Beg.

199
00:09:45,006 --> 00:09:46,229
Excuse me?

200
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,596
On your knees, soldier.

201
00:09:56,374 --> 00:09:59,908
Renee, dear, sweet, horrible girl,

202
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:02,295
would you do me the honor of dining with me

203
00:10:02,296 --> 00:10:03,620
on the morrow?

204
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:06,460
I would.

205
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:11,322
Was that really necessary?

206
00:10:11,784 --> 00:10:13,239
It was for me.

207
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,106
I had to make sure I wasn't rolling over

208
00:10:15,107 --> 00:10:16,872
for a guy with a bald spot.

209
00:10:23,287 --> 00:10:26,799
Intern Susan Delfino
reporting for duty, sir.

210
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:29,762
I was wondering how long it
might take me to regret this.

211
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:33,143
Wait. I just want to say how honored I am

212
00:10:33,144 --> 00:10:34,288
that you chose me.

213
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,928
It's nice to know that when the
history of art is written,

214
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,638
there'll be one small
footnote with my name on it.

215
00:10:44,775 --> 00:10:48,418
Susan, Jasper, Jasper, Susan.
I'll pick him up Monday night.

216
00:10:49,151 --> 00:10:50,867
I don't understand. 
Well, he's my son.

217
00:10:50,868 --> 00:10:52,204
You're watching him for the weekend.

218
00:10:52,665 --> 00:10:55,706
My ex says he's deathly
allergic to tree nuts, cats...

219
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:58,326
And something else. I can't remember.

220
00:10:58,327 --> 00:10:59,803
Uh, wait a-- wait a minute.

221
00:11:00,275 --> 00:11:04,742
So... you have a son? Somebody married you?

222
00:11:04,743 --> 00:11:06,503
Briefly. I was young and needed money.

223
00:11:06,504 --> 00:11:08,057
She was rich and wanted a child,

224
00:11:08,058 --> 00:11:09,709
and now one weekend a month,

225
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,865
Jasper and I spend some
quality time together.

226
00:11:12,668 --> 00:11:13,622
See you Monday.

227
00:11:14,035 --> 00:11:15,650
Uh, wait a minute. Um, so...

228
00:11:16,181 --> 00:11:17,078
That's what this is.

229
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:20,080
I'm just a... glorified babysitter.

230
00:11:20,081 --> 00:11:21,156
No, no, no, no.

231
00:11:21,697 --> 00:11:24,648
As per school policy, we're
calling it an internship.

232
00:11:25,621 --> 00:11:27,095
That way, I don't have to pay you.

233
00:11:37,612 --> 00:11:40,371
So, Jasper, looks like
it's just you and me.

234
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:41,816
What are you reading?

235
00:11:42,297 --> 00:11:44,627
"Tips for surviving a nuclear attack."

236
00:11:45,067 --> 00:11:47,928
The people of Nagasaki never saw it coming.

237
00:11:49,262 --> 00:11:50,407
I know how they feel.

238
00:11:57,662 --> 00:12:01,153
So Ben and I are having sex tomorrow.

239
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:03,663
Ew. Not in front of my kid's costume.

240
00:12:03,664 --> 00:12:06,561
Sorry. It's our first time.
It's kind of a big deal.

241
00:12:06,562 --> 00:12:09,200
First time? I thought sex was
like shaking hands for you.

242
00:12:09,201 --> 00:12:11,413
It is. I like to get it over with early

243
00:12:11,414 --> 00:12:12,750
so there's no pressure.

244
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:18,045
But with Ben, there's been
all this buildup, so...

245
00:12:18,046 --> 00:12:19,701
- Pressure? 
- Yeah.

246
00:12:21,046 --> 00:12:23,333
I like him... a lot.

247
00:12:24,067 --> 00:12:25,733
And I want our first time to be great.

248
00:12:25,734 --> 00:12:27,379
That's sweet.

249
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:31,727
That's why I got some
sex drugs in Chinatown.

250
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,663
Less sweet.

251
00:12:34,134 --> 00:12:35,790
"Woman love fluid."

252
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:37,817
I gotta put some tape over that.

253
00:12:37,818 --> 00:12:39,141
This stuff work?

254
00:12:39,142 --> 00:12:41,271
Even if it all it Jacks
up is my confidence,

255
00:12:41,272 --> 00:12:42,817
that is good enough for me.

256
00:12:43,348 --> 00:12:45,045
Okay. What do you think?

257
00:12:45,947 --> 00:12:48,336
This looks like a cat, right?

258
00:12:51,599 --> 00:12:54,197
Sure, after it's passed through a coyote.

259
00:12:54,198 --> 00:12:55,529
What is going on?

260
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:58,330
You always go for easy costumes.

261
00:12:58,331 --> 00:13:01,277
Didn't you once staple math
tests to Penny's jeans

262
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:03,239
and send her out as "Smarty Pants"?

263
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,545
Yes, but this year, Tom's new girlfriend

264
00:13:05,546 --> 00:13:07,586
offered to make Penny's costume,

265
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:09,495
so I, of course, said I would.

266
00:13:09,496 --> 00:13:12,588
Damn, why is there no
Chinese costume fluid?

267
00:13:13,089 --> 00:13:14,635
Well, you're in luck.

268
00:13:14,636 --> 00:13:17,218
I have a friend in New York
that is a costume designer,

269
00:13:17,219 --> 00:13:18,934
and he has three Tony awards.

270
00:13:19,474 --> 00:13:21,773
And he'll make my kid's cat outfit?

271
00:13:22,264 --> 00:13:24,228
Sadly, he'll do anything for cash.

272
00:13:24,229 --> 00:13:26,018
He's a huge cokehead.

273
00:13:26,489 --> 00:13:29,108
That means he'll do it fast, too.
That's great!

274
00:13:30,312 --> 00:13:31,757
I-I mean, for us.

275
00:13:32,259 --> 00:13:34,697
Poor guy needs help.
My thoughts and prayers are with him.

276
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,405
Hey there.

277
00:13:40,838 --> 00:13:43,123
If you're, uh, here for the
meeting, it just ended,

278
00:13:43,124 --> 00:13:45,895
as I'm sure you can tell by the
massacre at the doughnut box.

279
00:13:48,422 --> 00:13:50,077
Actually, I was just...

280
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,705
really looking to talk to somebody.

281
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:53,677
Well, I'm Allen.

282
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:55,431
Carlos.

283
00:13:55,432 --> 00:13:56,921
Why don't you tell me what's
going on with you, Carlos?

284
00:13:56,922 --> 00:13:57,726
Come on in.

285
00:13:59,774 --> 00:14:01,029
Okay. All right.

286
00:14:02,011 --> 00:14:05,414
I, uh... had a little incident

287
00:14:06,017 --> 00:14:06,929
a few nights ago.

288
00:14:07,332 --> 00:14:08,355
Uh-huh.

289
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,270
Got loaded... and I left the house,

290
00:14:13,772 --> 00:14:16,792
and, uh... I don't remember doing it.

291
00:14:17,255 --> 00:14:18,881
Uh-huh, you blacked out, huh?

292
00:14:19,381 --> 00:14:21,069
Yeah, I'm so jealous of you guys.

293
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,073
Uh, I was always cursed with total recall

294
00:14:24,074 --> 00:14:26,524
of every horrifying second of my benders.

295
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,844
So how often does this happen?

296
00:14:30,659 --> 00:14:31,742
It doesn't.

297
00:14:31,743 --> 00:14:34,858
I usually don't drink that much.
Just lately.

298
00:14:34,859 --> 00:14:36,927
Yeah? Oh. So what's "lately"?

299
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,004
I don't know.

300
00:14:39,704 --> 00:14:41,020
Two months, maybe.

301
00:14:41,021 --> 00:14:42,604
Something happen two months ago?

302
00:14:43,588 --> 00:14:44,293
You lose your job?

303
00:14:44,294 --> 00:14:46,955
Did your wife leave you? Dog die?

304
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:51,980
No.

305
00:14:53,114 --> 00:14:54,528
Nothing I can think of.

306
00:14:56,715 --> 00:14:58,111
'Cause usually this sort
of thing is triggered

307
00:14:58,112 --> 00:14:59,837
by some kind of traumatic incident.

308
00:14:59,838 --> 00:15:02,394
You know, I don't think
this was such a good idea.

309
00:15:02,704 --> 00:15:04,622
Hey, I wasn't trying to pry.

310
00:15:04,623 --> 00:15:07,278
Allen, thanks, but I really gotta be going.

311
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,012
Was good meeting you, Carlos.

312
00:15:09,418 --> 00:15:10,565
Listen, if, uh,

313
00:15:10,645 --> 00:15:13,202
you ever wanna talk, here's my cell.

314
00:15:13,902 --> 00:15:15,099
Day or night, I'll pick up.

315
00:15:17,413 --> 00:15:18,142
Appreciate it.

316
00:15:18,143 --> 00:15:19,212
Good luck to you.

317
00:15:53,136 --> 00:15:53,976
Bree.

318
00:15:55,074 --> 00:15:56,360
What? Is everything all right?

319
00:15:57,585 --> 00:16:00,846
I just saw some miscreants
throwing eggs at your house.

320
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:02,844
I tried to run over and catch them,

321
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,510
but I was too late.

322
00:16:04,511 --> 00:16:07,560
Ah, it's probably some kids
warming up for Halloween.

323
00:16:07,561 --> 00:16:11,438
No, no, it wasn't kids, and
they shouted something

324
00:16:11,439 --> 00:16:13,577
unpleasant about real estate developers,

325
00:16:13,578 --> 00:16:16,042
including an anti-Australian slur.

326
00:16:17,181 --> 00:16:19,659
Uh, I've never heard an
anti-Australian slur.

327
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,511
What was it?

328
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,270
I'd rather not repeat it.

329
00:16:23,271 --> 00:16:26,595
The point is, there seems to
be some strenuous opposition

330
00:16:26,596 --> 00:16:27,942
to the Chapman Woods development,

331
00:16:27,943 --> 00:16:29,571
and as your liaison,

332
00:16:29,775 --> 00:16:32,061
I think you should consider relocating it.

333
00:16:32,062 --> 00:16:33,056
All right.

334
00:16:33,501 --> 00:16:34,670
Let me consider it.

335
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,488
Nah. Screw 'em.

336
00:16:38,337 --> 00:16:39,380
Excuse me?

337
00:16:39,757 --> 00:16:42,738
I already sunk $100,000
into moving this project

338
00:16:42,739 --> 00:16:43,799
from Hawkins Lake,

339
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,693
and there's...

340
00:16:45,996 --> 00:16:49,266
Well... what happened at Hawkins Lake?

341
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:54,289
We were all set to go,
bulldozers at the ready,

342
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,170
and then the environmental impact study

343
00:16:56,171 --> 00:16:59,907
turns up five endangered
yellow-spotted frogs.

344
00:17:00,372 --> 00:17:00,905
Frogs?

345
00:17:00,906 --> 00:17:03,576
Yeah. The slimy little bastards
are now the proud owners

346
00:17:03,577 --> 00:17:05,880
of 50 acres of waterfront real estate.

347
00:17:08,837 --> 00:17:11,653
I'm just curious. Have you had
your environmental impact study

348
00:17:11,654 --> 00:17:13,032
in Chapman Woods yet?

349
00:17:13,363 --> 00:17:15,568
Uh, tomorrow, but I'm not worried.

350
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:17,559
My guys have been over every inch of it.

351
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,122
Not a miserable amphibian in sight.

352
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:22,746
Yes.

353
00:17:23,474 --> 00:17:25,930
And I can't imagine that
would change overnight.

354
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:37,728
A construction project for a frog?

355
00:17:37,729 --> 00:17:40,248
If it's an endangered
yellow-spotted frog, they will.

356
00:17:40,249 --> 00:17:42,017
Now come on. Help me find some.

357
00:17:42,238 --> 00:17:44,427
Ugh. Things creep me out.

358
00:17:45,928 --> 00:17:46,789
You know that story

359
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,238
where the princess has to kiss the frog,

360
00:17:48,239 --> 00:17:50,142
turn him back into a prince?
So not worth it.

361
00:17:50,143 --> 00:17:51,847
I don't care how rich his dad was.

362
00:17:51,848 --> 00:17:53,682
Gaby, you know where they don't have frogs?

363
00:17:53,683 --> 00:17:56,201
Prison! Which is where we're
gonna be if we don't plant some

364
00:17:56,202 --> 00:17:57,675
at Ben's construction site.

365
00:17:58,075 --> 00:17:59,231
Fine. I'll help.

366
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:02,213
Oh. Saw one. Ohh!

367
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:06,620
Oh, is that one?

368
00:18:06,905 --> 00:18:07,878
Does he have spots on his legs?

369
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:09,738
He has to have spots on his legs.

370
00:18:09,739 --> 00:18:12,206
Well, you're good with crafts.
You can stencil some on later.

371
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:14,395
Aah! Ohh!

372
00:18:14,396 --> 00:18:15,257
Damn it!

373
00:18:16,207 --> 00:18:19,099
This is more of a boys thing.
Why isn't Carlos here?

374
00:18:19,659 --> 00:18:21,741
Because I didn't tell him
about the construction.

375
00:18:21,847 --> 00:18:23,112
What? Why not?

376
00:18:23,113 --> 00:18:24,936
Because he's got a lot
on his plate right now.

377
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:26,951
Or, actually, in his glass.

378
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:30,238
He's been drinking a lot.

379
00:18:31,503 --> 00:18:33,470
Really? Do you want me to speak to him?

380
00:18:33,471 --> 00:18:36,671
No. No. He's been going to A.A. meetings.

381
00:18:36,672 --> 00:18:39,016
He said he met a great sponsor.
He's doing fine.

382
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:41,306
I certainly understand
what he's going through.

383
00:18:41,307 --> 00:18:42,095
It's kind of a miracle

384
00:18:42,096 --> 00:18:44,067
that I've stayed sober through all of this.

385
00:18:45,447 --> 00:18:48,931
Don't move. There's one by your foot.

386
00:18:51,146 --> 00:18:52,810
Aah!

387
00:18:56,363 --> 00:18:58,659
This is gonna be a long day.

388
00:19:02,634 --> 00:19:05,705
So... you wanna play some video games?

389
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:07,062
That's original.

390
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,060
Okay. Um...

391
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:13,967
Something more creative.

392
00:19:15,128 --> 00:19:16,526
You wanna carve a Jack-o'-Lantern?

393
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:19,790
I'd rather stick a knife in my eye.

394
00:19:22,196 --> 00:19:24,353
Only 36 hours to go.

395
00:19:24,354 --> 00:19:26,907
37. He's always late.

396
00:19:29,191 --> 00:19:32,068
I am the Candy-Bot 3000.

397
00:19:32,069 --> 00:19:34,296
Please give candy.

398
00:19:35,377 --> 00:19:38,045
Aw, M.J., you look amazing. I mean...

399
00:19:38,046 --> 00:19:40,950
I am Mom-Bot 3000.

400
00:19:40,951 --> 00:19:42,929
Costume approved.

401
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:45,259
You guys sound stupid.

402
00:19:46,072 --> 00:19:48,758
Your insult does not compute.

403
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:52,228
Shut up! Nobody cares
about being a dumb robot!

404
00:20:12,099 --> 00:20:13,353
Hey, what's going on?

405
00:20:13,887 --> 00:20:16,136
I just hate all this Halloween stuff.

406
00:20:16,884 --> 00:20:19,912
How can you hate a holiday
that's all about dressing up

407
00:20:19,913 --> 00:20:21,686
and getting free candy?

408
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:23,194
It's the best day of the year.

409
00:20:29,068 --> 00:20:31,704
Jasper, does your dad not let
you celebrate Halloween?

410
00:20:32,647 --> 00:20:34,150
He says it's for kids.

411
00:20:35,408 --> 00:20:39,038
You do know you're a kid, right?

412
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:44,683
Okay, that's it.

413
00:20:44,717 --> 00:20:48,220
You and your father are coming
trick-or-treating with us.

414
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,512
He'll never go for that.

415
00:20:50,513 --> 00:20:52,858
Oh, you just let me talk to him.

416
00:20:52,892 --> 00:20:55,559
I can be pretty persuasive.

417
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:58,099
I'd rather stick a knife in my eye.

418
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,953
Oh, come on. Your son is dying
to go trick-or-treating.

419
00:21:00,954 --> 00:21:02,759
It's just a couple hours.

420
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,102
Until I deliver these paintings,

421
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:06,071
it's the only thing I care about.

422
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:08,098
That and a cigarette.

423
00:21:09,609 --> 00:21:11,403
Don't look at this. It's not done.

424
00:21:35,136 --> 00:21:37,047
Gaby, will you stop with the sanitizer?

425
00:21:37,048 --> 00:21:38,943
Your hands are gonna slide
right off the wheel.

426
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,169
I can't help it.

427
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:41,540
I can still feel those slimy things

428
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:43,136
crawling through my fingers.

429
00:21:43,997 --> 00:21:44,770
Speaking of which,

430
00:21:44,771 --> 00:21:47,036
how come I don't hear
anything moving in that box?

431
00:21:47,037 --> 00:21:48,764
Shouldn't they be croaking or something?

432
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:51,379
- Maybe they're resting.
- Or dead.

433
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,279
You don't think they're dead, do you?

434
00:21:54,366 --> 00:21:56,695
Oh, God! Don't bring
that in the front seat.

435
00:21:58,430 --> 00:21:59,780
I don't hear anything.

436
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:05,219
All right. I'm trying to remain calm.

437
00:22:05,293 --> 00:22:07,913
Please tell me those are
your long-webbed fingers

438
00:22:07,914 --> 00:22:09,258
on my arm.

439
00:22:09,259 --> 00:22:12,160
Gaby, do not panic.

440
00:22:16,671 --> 00:22:18,960
Aah! Get it off!

441
00:22:18,961 --> 00:22:20,761
Stay calm! Stay calm!

442
00:22:20,762 --> 00:22:21,768
Don't panic!

443
00:22:22,147 --> 00:22:24,753
- Watch the road!
- Oh, God! I think it's on my leg!

444
00:22:24,754 --> 00:22:25,651
Stop swerving!

445
00:22:25,652 --> 00:22:27,313
I'm trying to get the lid back on!

446
00:22:27,314 --> 00:22:30,625
- Get it off me!
- Careful! It's crawling
under the brake pedal!

447
00:22:30,626 --> 00:22:32,120
Not anymore!

448
00:22:37,495 --> 00:22:40,542
Oh, they're getting away! They're so fast!

449
00:22:40,543 --> 00:22:42,430
What the hell could endanger them?!

450
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:45,776
Ohh! Detailing is never gonna get that out!

451
00:22:58,518 --> 00:23:00,297
We're so screwed.

452
00:23:00,298 --> 00:23:02,441
Will you please stop saying that?

453
00:23:02,837 --> 00:23:05,174
In 12 hours, those bulldozers
are gonna break ground.

454
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,642
I think the phrase "we are so screwed"

455
00:23:06,643 --> 00:23:07,789
cannot be said enough.

456
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,411
There must be something we can do.

457
00:23:09,412 --> 00:23:11,616
They're gonna find Alejandro's body.

458
00:23:11,617 --> 00:23:12,990
They'll... they'll do an investigation.

459
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:14,873
They'll learn he's my stepfather.

460
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:17,407
Unless...

461
00:23:17,878 --> 00:23:19,321
Unless what?

462
00:23:21,941 --> 00:23:23,612
There's no body to be found.

463
00:23:36,194 --> 00:23:38,188
Mom, I need my cat costume.

464
00:23:38,189 --> 00:23:39,845
Dad and Jane will be here soon.

465
00:23:40,061 --> 00:23:42,632
I'm just putting on the finishing touches.

466
00:23:42,667 --> 00:23:46,536
The tracking number is jhkwrxa.

467
00:23:46,571 --> 00:23:48,205
I'm not sure why the tracking numbers

468
00:23:48,239 --> 00:23:51,108
are all letters, but it's your system, so--

469
00:23:51,142 --> 00:23:52,460
Oh, forget it, forget it.
There he is.

470
00:23:54,592 --> 00:23:55,861
Hey! Psst!

471
00:23:55,862 --> 00:23:58,743
Up here! Up here!
Don't--don't ring the doorbell.

472
00:23:58,744 --> 00:24:00,344
I just put my baby down for a nap.

473
00:24:00,345 --> 00:24:02,451
Toss the package up here.

474
00:24:02,854 --> 00:24:05,387
I'll catch it. I have three sons. Come on!

475
00:24:13,164 --> 00:24:14,983
Nice.

476
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,541
I can't wait any longer. Let me see.

477
00:24:24,575 --> 00:24:26,243
Mm!

478
00:24:26,277 --> 00:24:28,078
Finished. All yours.

479
00:24:28,112 --> 00:24:29,379
Thanks, mom.

480
00:24:29,414 --> 00:24:31,515
I can't believe you made
this all by yourself.

481
00:24:31,549 --> 00:24:34,184
Mrs. Scavo! I need a signature!

482
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:36,830
Let's go try it on. Come on.

483
00:24:36,831 --> 00:24:37,834
Okay. Go, go.

484
00:24:42,427 --> 00:24:44,575
I'm just saying you are one good wig

485
00:24:44,576 --> 00:24:48,014
away from being a fantastic cowardly lion.

486
00:24:48,015 --> 00:24:49,338
Drop it, witch.

487
00:24:50,414 --> 00:24:52,016
Just say it for me once.

488
00:24:52,017 --> 00:24:53,667
"I do believe in spooks."

489
00:24:53,668 --> 00:24:55,694
"I do, I do, I do believe in spooks."

490
00:24:55,695 --> 00:24:58,040
Look, I'm only here because
you kidnapped my painting.

491
00:24:58,041 --> 00:24:59,920
The ransom was two hours
of trick-or-treating,

492
00:24:59,921 --> 00:25:02,043
no costume, no chitchat.

493
00:25:02,044 --> 00:25:03,193
All I'm doing is counting the minutes

494
00:25:03,194 --> 00:25:04,561
till I can get back to work.

495
00:25:07,485 --> 00:25:08,528
Score. Check it out.

496
00:25:08,529 --> 00:25:10,750
They had giant peanut butter cups.

497
00:25:10,856 --> 00:25:11,870
Nice going, sweetie.

498
00:25:13,194 --> 00:25:15,427
I got a chocolate bomb. You want some?

499
00:25:15,428 --> 00:25:17,236
No, thanks, pal. What I want is to go.

500
00:25:18,015 --> 00:25:20,312
But we've only done half the street.

501
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,534
Okay, well, tell you what.

502
00:25:22,535 --> 00:25:24,434
What if we leave now, and
I'll give you 20 bucks?

503
00:25:24,469 --> 00:25:26,203
You can buy all the candy you like.

504
00:25:26,237 --> 00:25:28,946
Your father's just messing with you.
Run on ahead.

505
00:25:29,205 --> 00:25:31,156
I promise I'll go fast, Andre.

506
00:25:32,109 --> 00:25:34,554
He calls you "Andre"?

507
00:25:34,555 --> 00:25:35,811
Oh, yeah, I prefer it.

508
00:25:36,514 --> 00:25:38,090
"Dad" isn't an accurate characterization

509
00:25:38,091 --> 00:25:39,710
of our relationship.

510
00:25:40,761 --> 00:25:42,068
He's your son.

511
00:25:42,687 --> 00:25:43,541
He's her son.

512
00:25:44,489 --> 00:25:46,207
Biologically, he's yours.

513
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:48,600
Ontologically, he's getting
in the way of my work.

514
00:25:48,601 --> 00:25:51,654
Well, psychologically,
you're a freakin' sociopath.

515
00:25:51,655 --> 00:25:54,108
Do you see how desperately that boy

516
00:25:54,109 --> 00:25:55,531
is trying to connect with you?

517
00:25:55,532 --> 00:25:57,760
And you do everything you
can to push him away.

518
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,625
I'm not interested in the relationship.

519
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:02,599
Tough.

520
00:26:02,803 --> 00:26:06,345
I mean, he's not a novel
you can just toss aside

521
00:26:06,346 --> 00:26:07,609
if it's boring.

522
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:09,947
Or a painting you just walk past

523
00:26:09,948 --> 00:26:11,476
'cause it's not interesting.

524
00:26:11,505 --> 00:26:13,489
He's a person with feelings.

525
00:26:13,637 --> 00:26:17,336
Okay, just keep going.
This is really making the time fly by.

526
00:26:19,907 --> 00:26:23,791
I have spent the last few weeks
trying to get you to like me,

527
00:26:24,847 --> 00:26:28,201
and I just realized something.
I don't like you.

528
00:26:30,438 --> 00:26:32,193
Your painting is in the utility closet

529
00:26:32,194 --> 00:26:33,550
next to your classroom.

530
00:26:34,636 --> 00:26:36,677
Go take care of your masterpiece.

531
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,038
I'll take care of your son.

532
00:26:44,715 --> 00:26:45,785
Hi.

533
00:26:46,284 --> 00:26:48,571
Thank you for letting me tag
along trick-or-treating.

534
00:26:49,086 --> 00:26:51,779
Chloe's 20 now, so I'm nostalgic
for things like this.

535
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,509
Aw, you're lucky. My older kids

536
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:56,628
are 20 as well, but this
one kept knocking me up

537
00:26:56,629 --> 00:26:59,646
so now I won't get to be
nostalgic until I'm 90.

538
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:05,316
So... is Penny ready?
'Cause we gotta get to the McAllisters'

539
00:27:05,317 --> 00:27:06,807
before they run out of popcorn balls.

540
00:27:07,231 --> 00:27:09,198
She's just putting on her costume...

541
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,775
That I sewed with my hands,

542
00:27:11,809 --> 00:27:13,143
and I'm pretty proud of it.

543
00:27:13,954 --> 00:27:14,977
Mom!

544
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,338
This is amazing.

545
00:27:19,334 --> 00:27:21,544
Look. I'm a kitten with a whip.

546
00:27:22,795 --> 00:27:23,991
Meow.

547
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:28,462
This is just

548
00:27:28,463 --> 00:27:30,186
in case she's attacked by dogs.

549
00:27:30,521 --> 00:27:32,187
You're proud of this?

550
00:27:33,613 --> 00:27:35,972
Yep. I thought it was cute.

551
00:27:36,316 --> 00:27:39,251
Yeah, if she's trick-or-treating
for dollar bills!

552
00:27:39,252 --> 00:27:41,602
It's completely inappropriate!

553
00:27:41,603 --> 00:27:43,352
Honey, go back upstairs

554
00:27:43,353 --> 00:27:45,274
and see if you can find
those "Smarty Pants."

555
00:27:45,275 --> 00:27:46,390
Do I have to?

556
00:27:49,185 --> 00:27:52,374
Penny, are you sure you
put the whole costume on?

557
00:27:52,603 --> 00:27:53,247
I think so.

558
00:27:53,248 --> 00:27:55,533
There wasn't a skirt that went with it?

559
00:27:55,534 --> 00:27:58,271
'Cause I'm pretty sure a skirt
was a part of that pattern.

560
00:27:58,272 --> 00:27:59,068
Right?

561
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:02,471
Yeah, yeah. There was.

562
00:28:03,168 --> 00:28:05,913
Well, I'd bet I could help you
find that skirt your mom made.

563
00:28:08,739 --> 00:28:10,079
I bet you could.

564
00:28:12,436 --> 00:28:13,227
Go on.

565
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,588
Trick or treat?!

566
00:29:02,912 --> 00:29:04,131
Hold that thought.

567
00:29:12,242 --> 00:29:14,387
Trick or treat?!

568
00:29:14,388 --> 00:29:16,074
What amazing costumes.

569
00:29:16,075 --> 00:29:18,096
Now don't get me with your hook.

570
00:29:18,097 --> 00:29:21,164
And look at you.
Aren't you the prettiest little princess

571
00:29:21,165 --> 00:29:22,433
in the whole... world...

572
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,061
Uh...

573
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:30,813
Now... let's see if we can
find something "fun size"

574
00:29:30,814 --> 00:29:32,426
for me to enjoy.

575
00:29:43,707 --> 00:29:46,833
Whoa! Is it, uh...

576
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:48,790
Is it hot in here?

577
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:50,460
Uh... don't think so.

578
00:29:50,461 --> 00:29:51,423
Okay.

579
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:55,668
Maybe I should, uh, take off a layer.

580
00:30:02,109 --> 00:30:03,277
Mmm.

581
00:30:06,713 --> 00:30:07,751
You all right?

582
00:30:07,752 --> 00:30:10,233
I'm not sure. I've got this...

583
00:30:11,321 --> 00:30:13,372
this tightness in my throat.

584
00:30:13,527 --> 00:30:16,203
Yeah, and your eyes look a little glassy.

585
00:30:16,204 --> 00:30:17,668
Uh, you sure you're okay?

586
00:30:17,669 --> 00:30:19,066
We can do this another night, you know.

587
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,802
No, no, no. I'm fine, really.

588
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:27,058
Now... get over here, big man.

589
00:30:36,928 --> 00:30:39,576
What about the house with the
spiderwebs and the bats?

590
00:30:39,577 --> 00:30:40,988
That didn't scare you?

591
00:30:40,989 --> 00:30:45,053
Nah, it takes a lot more
than that to scare me. Aah!

592
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:48,591
How did you get in here?

593
00:30:49,392 --> 00:30:50,704
This was under the mat.

594
00:30:50,705 --> 00:30:52,145
It's a great hiding place, by the way.

595
00:30:52,146 --> 00:30:54,099
Had me stumped for a good four seconds.

596
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,052
Mommy?

597
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:56,651
Can we go trade candy?

598
00:30:56,652 --> 00:30:58,732
Well, you'll have to ask Jasper's...

599
00:30:59,226 --> 00:31:00,407
Andre.

600
00:31:01,917 --> 00:31:03,068
Yeah, it's fine.

601
00:31:03,224 --> 00:31:04,560
All right. Yeah.

602
00:31:05,127 --> 00:31:06,956
Thought you were gonna
finish your painting.

603
00:31:07,889 --> 00:31:08,880
I will.

604
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,741
But I was thinking about what you said.

605
00:31:11,891 --> 00:31:13,597
And you realized the error of your ways

606
00:31:13,598 --> 00:31:15,029
and came to tell me that?

607
00:31:15,233 --> 00:31:19,241
God. Is that how things work in your world?

608
00:31:20,251 --> 00:31:23,188
Look, I get you don't like me.
Most people don't.

609
00:31:23,823 --> 00:31:26,769
I've learned to live with
that mainly by not caring.

610
00:31:26,773 --> 00:31:28,900
Oh. I think you care.

611
00:31:29,677 --> 00:31:31,442
I swear to God I don't.

612
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:33,477
You have to understand, Susan.

613
00:31:33,478 --> 00:31:35,485
My work is always gonna come first.

614
00:31:36,607 --> 00:31:38,403
Even before Jasper?

615
00:31:38,867 --> 00:31:41,235
That's what I was getting to.
I heard what you said.

616
00:31:41,236 --> 00:31:42,542
He is my son.

617
00:31:43,343 --> 00:31:45,560
And I'm gonna try to be a better dad.

618
00:31:47,381 --> 00:31:49,651
Well, I bet it'll make
you a better painter.

619
00:31:49,652 --> 00:31:51,062
I bet it won't.

620
00:31:52,307 --> 00:31:55,446
You need to know something
about being a true artist.

621
00:31:56,279 --> 00:31:59,592
This--this gift, this curse,
whatever it is--

622
00:32:00,437 --> 00:32:03,194
it consumes you and blots out
everything else--

623
00:32:03,195 --> 00:32:05,989
friends, family, everything.

624
00:32:07,531 --> 00:32:09,459
I would never let that happen to me.

625
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,481
You may not have a choice.

626
00:32:24,851 --> 00:32:26,694
Trick or...

627
00:32:33,862 --> 00:32:37,224
That's weird.
They didn't even wait for the candy.

628
00:32:37,629 --> 00:32:38,946
How's dinner coming?

629
00:32:38,947 --> 00:32:41,434
Oh, it's just about r--
Oh, my God.

630
00:32:41,435 --> 00:32:42,663
What happened to you?

631
00:32:43,697 --> 00:32:44,678
What?

632
00:32:45,345 --> 00:32:46,588
You need to see a doctor.

633
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:49,621
Oh. Over this little rash? Don't be silly.

634
00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:55,259
I'm not moving.

635
00:32:55,397 --> 00:32:57,228
Oh, that's not good.

636
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,670
You know, o-on second thought,

637
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,010
I'm not really feeling very...

638
00:33:03,011 --> 00:33:05,571
Oh, okay. Okay.

639
00:33:05,756 --> 00:33:07,533
Definitely time for a doctor.

640
00:33:17,624 --> 00:33:18,923
Almost finished.

641
00:33:18,924 --> 00:33:21,974
Wow, from cathouse to
house cat in ten minutes.

642
00:33:21,975 --> 00:33:23,464
You could do this professionally.

643
00:33:23,621 --> 00:33:25,521
You mean like the person who made it?

644
00:33:27,409 --> 00:33:30,681
Yeah. I may have...

645
00:33:30,682 --> 00:33:33,175
slightly overexaggerated my sewing skills.

646
00:33:33,176 --> 00:33:36,229
I guess... I was feeling...

647
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:39,252
This is new for me.

648
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,787
It's new for me, too.

649
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,417
You gonna bust me?

650
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:44,941
For trying to look good?

651
00:33:45,552 --> 00:33:48,293
Lynette, when my husband left
me for our Swedish au pair,

652
00:33:48,294 --> 00:33:50,346
I went out and bought my daughter a car.

653
00:33:51,082 --> 00:33:52,311
She was 13.

654
00:33:54,066 --> 00:33:55,655
Well, then it's official.

655
00:33:55,841 --> 00:33:57,762
You're better at everything, even bribery.

656
00:33:57,763 --> 00:34:01,117
Please. You had a career
and raised five kids.

657
00:34:01,118 --> 00:34:02,796
I could barely keep it together with one.

658
00:34:02,797 --> 00:34:04,293
Who says I kept it together?

659
00:34:04,294 --> 00:34:05,891
I think you're doing pretty great.

660
00:34:06,425 --> 00:34:08,750
You're smart, confident.

661
00:34:09,287 --> 00:34:11,774
In fact, this might sound a little weird,

662
00:34:11,775 --> 00:34:15,152
but... you seem like the kind of
person I could be friends with.

663
00:34:17,633 --> 00:34:18,962
It doesn't sound weird.

664
00:34:18,963 --> 00:34:22,638
Before, when you saved my ass out there,

665
00:34:22,689 --> 00:34:24,864
that was the kind of thing a friend does.

666
00:34:25,753 --> 00:34:26,970
Happy to help.

667
00:34:28,998 --> 00:34:30,267
Then...

668
00:34:34,213 --> 00:34:36,259
can I ask you to help
me with something else?

669
00:34:36,703 --> 00:34:37,915
Sure.

670
00:34:38,607 --> 00:34:40,107
You think maybe you could stop

671
00:34:40,108 --> 00:34:41,796
trying to take my husband away from me?

672
00:34:43,307 --> 00:34:44,537
What?

673
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:46,348
Your marriage ended.

674
00:34:48,597 --> 00:34:51,476
Whoa. Whoa. That's not fair.

675
00:34:51,609 --> 00:34:54,416
The circumstances were
completely different.

676
00:34:54,925 --> 00:34:56,241
Maybe they were.

677
00:34:56,539 --> 00:34:58,509
But you still know how it hurts.

678
00:34:58,768 --> 00:35:00,939
So I'm asking you, please,

679
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,632
back off.

680
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,101
Okay?

681
00:35:05,676 --> 00:35:07,129
You think I'm gonna give up on him

682
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:09,754
just because you can't accept
your marriage is over?

683
00:35:11,528 --> 00:35:13,408
We have five kids.

684
00:35:13,693 --> 00:35:15,270
One of them is just a baby.

685
00:35:15,271 --> 00:35:17,573
I'm not letting my husband
go without a fight.

686
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:20,071
Well, according to Tom, you're
always looking for a fight.

687
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:22,923
My ex was like that, too.

688
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,558
You know, and when you
find somebody who isn't,

689
00:35:26,269 --> 00:35:27,838
you wanna hang on to them.

690
00:35:35,308 --> 00:35:36,831
You should give this to Penny.

691
00:35:46,578 --> 00:35:49,217
Okay, the girls are asleep.
Listen for the doorbell

692
00:35:49,218 --> 00:35:51,107
in case there are some
late trick-or-treaters.

693
00:35:51,116 --> 00:35:52,623
I know the drill.

694
00:35:52,642 --> 00:35:55,565
Oh, and don't wait up for me. I'll be late.

695
00:35:55,566 --> 00:35:57,345
We're taking Lynette out for a drink.

696
00:35:58,113 --> 00:35:59,564
Oh. Sorry.

697
00:36:00,372 --> 00:36:01,599
I'm fine, Gaby.

698
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,825
It's just her first holiday
without Tom and the kids,

699
00:36:04,826 --> 00:36:06,607
so we wanna give her a fun night out,

700
00:36:06,608 --> 00:36:08,412
you know, to boost her spirits.

701
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:11,068
Bye.

702
00:36:13,808 --> 00:36:16,971
We're digging up the body tonight?

703
00:36:16,972 --> 00:36:18,172
We have no choice.

704
00:36:18,173 --> 00:36:21,099
Ben's bulldozers start tearing
up the woods tomorrow morning.

705
00:36:21,907 --> 00:36:23,688
Where are Carlos and Susan?

706
00:36:23,689 --> 00:36:25,916
Carlos is not in a good place right now.

707
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:27,165
I didn't wanna freak him out.

708
00:36:27,166 --> 00:36:29,889
And Susan has done nothing but
freak out, so it's just us.

709
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:30,738
Come on.

710
00:36:30,739 --> 00:36:33,980
Oh. Okay.

711
00:36:34,685 --> 00:36:37,269
I... I can't believe this.

712
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:39,407
We're getting rid of a dead body again.

713
00:36:39,408 --> 00:36:41,033
I know. I'm so sorry.

714
00:36:41,223 --> 00:36:42,406
No, I just spent the evening

715
00:36:42,407 --> 00:36:43,799
with my husband's new girlfriend.

716
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,245
This doesn't sound so bad.

717
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:53,690
How you feeling?

718
00:36:54,439 --> 00:36:55,574
Better.

719
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:57,904
They gave me a shot of cortisone.

720
00:36:57,905 --> 00:36:59,705
The doctor said it was something I ate.

721
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:03,087
Maybe strawberries or nuts.

722
00:37:03,325 --> 00:37:07,740
Really? Uh, he told me it
was the woman love fluid.

723
00:37:08,867 --> 00:37:10,873
Okay. Good-bye. Nice knowing you.

724
00:37:10,874 --> 00:37:11,805
I mean, you do know

725
00:37:11,806 --> 00:37:14,246
you're not supposed to
roofie yourself, right?

726
00:37:14,247 --> 00:37:15,637
Go away.

727
00:37:18,775 --> 00:37:21,117
Well, I don't get it.

728
00:37:22,021 --> 00:37:24,164
Now why would you take something like that?

729
00:37:25,825 --> 00:37:29,439
Because... I wanted tonight
to be special, okay?

730
00:37:29,675 --> 00:37:30,776
And...

731
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,786
Because I haven't been with
anyone since my divorce.

732
00:37:37,516 --> 00:37:38,560
You...

733
00:37:39,372 --> 00:37:41,104
When I moved here, you offered me sex

734
00:37:41,105 --> 00:37:42,749
before you even knew my name.

735
00:37:43,285 --> 00:37:45,677
Well, yeah, but that was before...

736
00:37:47,629 --> 00:37:49,146
Can I put the sheet back on?

737
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:50,244
Mm.

738
00:37:50,245 --> 00:37:54,416
That was before I realized
how much I like you.

739
00:37:56,969 --> 00:37:58,571
Well, I like you, too.

740
00:38:00,172 --> 00:38:04,202
Uh, would you like some,
uh, company under there?

741
00:38:23,568 --> 00:38:25,089
♪ Trick or treat? ♪

742
00:38:36,722 --> 00:38:38,372
♪ Trick or treat? ♪

743
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:43,996
Uh, so this is the part
where you give me candy.

744
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,928
I don't know about this. What ever happened

745
00:39:27,929 --> 00:39:30,346
to "never return to the
scene of the crime"?

746
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:32,242
She's got a point.

747
00:39:33,521 --> 00:39:34,579
We just need to do this

748
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,680
in the most efficient manner possible--

749
00:39:36,757 --> 00:39:38,509
find the grave, dig up the body...

750
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:39,638
Sounds easy so far.

751
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:42,032
Wrap it in a tarp, weight
it down with some bricks

752
00:39:42,033 --> 00:39:43,486
and toss it in the lake.

753
00:39:44,123 --> 00:39:45,529
I have all the supplies in my trunk,

754
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:47,297
along with clean towels, hand sanitizer,

755
00:39:47,298 --> 00:39:50,863
and breathing masks in case
the stench is overwhelming.

756
00:39:59,044 --> 00:40:01,834
Anyone wanna guess what a corpse looks like

757
00:40:01,835 --> 00:40:03,958
- after two months in the ground?
- Ohh.

758
00:40:03,959 --> 00:40:06,292
Oh, yeah. Is it just bones,

759
00:40:06,293 --> 00:40:08,219
or is there, like, other stuff, too?

760
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:08,779
- Ugh.
- Hey!

761
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:09,964
Shh!

762
00:40:10,882 --> 00:40:12,168
Did you hear something?

763
00:40:12,207 --> 00:40:13,997
Yeah. What is that?

764
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:15,171
Hey!

765
00:40:15,637 --> 00:40:16,594
Who's there?

766
00:40:16,595 --> 00:40:17,634
Who is that?!

767
00:40:17,635 --> 00:40:19,109
- I don't know.
- What do we do?

768
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:20,799
- Run.
- Okay!

769
00:40:20,814 --> 00:40:22,522
No! Split up.

770
00:40:49,097 --> 00:40:50,110
Aah!

771
00:41:09,657 --> 00:41:11,775
Where'd he go? Is he gone?

772
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:13,807
For now, but we gotta hurry.

773
00:41:14,129 --> 00:41:16,807
I-I think we're close.
I recognize this area.

774
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:18,334
Oh, God, this is creeping me out.

775
00:41:18,335 --> 00:41:19,916
Well, it doesn't help that it's Halloween.

776
00:41:19,917 --> 00:41:21,895
Let's just dig him up
and get this over with.

777
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:22,849
Okay.

778
00:41:24,009 --> 00:41:25,113
Gaby?

779
00:41:25,677 --> 00:41:26,808
Lynette?

780
00:41:32,576 --> 00:41:33,802
Oh, my God.

781
00:41:39,822 --> 00:41:40,977
Ladies?

782
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:43,013
Ladies!

783
00:41:44,083 --> 00:41:45,044
Bree?

784
00:41:48,609 --> 00:41:49,961
Paranoia...

785
00:41:51,511 --> 00:41:53,384
It's the irrational feeling

786
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:56,111
that the whole world is against you.

787
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:57,617
No.

788
00:41:58,136 --> 00:42:02,575
But it's no longer paranoia
when you discover...

789
00:42:04,751 --> 00:42:08,365
that someone really is out to get you.
