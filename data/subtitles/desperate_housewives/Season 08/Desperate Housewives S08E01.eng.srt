1
00:00:01,495 --> 00:00:03,945
Previously on...

2
00:00:03,945 --> 00:00:06,271
I wanna get things right this time.

3
00:00:06,403 --> 00:00:10,433
Bree's relationship
with detective Vance got serious.

4
00:00:11,538 --> 00:00:13,129
What are we gonna say to people?

5
00:00:13,129 --> 00:00:16,257
Tom and Lynette decided to separate.

6
00:00:16,257 --> 00:00:18,428
We shouldn't tell anyone
until we tell the kids.

7
00:00:18,588 --> 00:00:20,436
Oh, god. The kids.

8
00:00:20,668 --> 00:00:22,022
Sit down. Ow!

9
00:00:22,025 --> 00:00:25,527
Gaby's stepfather returned
to terrorize her again...

10
00:00:25,527 --> 00:00:28,103
I remember those nights in your room, baby.

11
00:00:28,103 --> 00:00:29,403
No! Stop.

12
00:00:29,403 --> 00:00:31,523
Until Carlos stopped him...

13
00:00:31,894 --> 00:00:33,064
permanently.

14
00:00:33,776 --> 00:00:34,970
Gaby?

15
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,412
What happened?

16
00:00:36,616 --> 00:00:39,340
- I killed him.
- And now he's gonna go to jail

17
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,832
because he was trying to protect me.

18
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:42,779
Calm down. We just need time to think.

19
00:00:42,812 --> 00:00:44,192
We don't have time.

20
00:00:44,192 --> 00:00:46,720
Yes, there was the dinner party.

21
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,902
Everybody's coming.

22
00:00:47,902 --> 00:00:49,792
Including your boyfriend the detective.

23
00:00:49,978 --> 00:00:51,364
I killed the son of a bitch
who hurt my wife.

24
00:00:51,438 --> 00:00:52,905
If I have to go to prison, I will.

25
00:00:53,607 --> 00:00:55,086
That's not gonna happen.

26
00:01:06,824 --> 00:01:08,785
Every hostess knows

27
00:01:08,785 --> 00:01:12,815
there's work to be done after
the guests leave a party.

28
00:01:15,841 --> 00:01:20,849
And only the best of friends
will stay long after the party's over...

29
00:01:23,185 --> 00:01:25,378
to help clean up the mess.

30
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,295
They help with the heavy lifting...

31
00:01:35,067 --> 00:01:37,688
they work together to lighten the load.

32
00:01:40,712 --> 00:01:44,051
They take on the most unpleasant tasks.

33
00:01:47,656 --> 00:01:51,255
And, of course,
there's no task more unpleasant

34
00:01:53,052 --> 00:01:56,438
than getting rid of an unwanted guest.

35
00:01:59,188 --> 00:02:01,542
I should go move the car off the trail.
You gonna be okay?

36
00:02:06,294 --> 00:02:07,637
Is this happening?

37
00:02:07,703 --> 00:02:09,558
Are we really doing this?

38
00:02:09,558 --> 00:02:11,212
Everyone stay focused.

39
00:02:12,144 --> 00:02:13,238
The hardest part is over.

40
00:02:13,238 --> 00:02:15,001
Now all we have to do is fill this in.

41
00:02:26,929 --> 00:02:28,735
Oh, my god.

42
00:02:28,827 --> 00:02:30,511
I thought I got everything.

43
00:02:30,992 --> 00:02:32,139
No.

44
00:02:32,184 --> 00:02:33,898
No, you missed the phone.

45
00:02:34,127 --> 00:02:36,230
And if you missed that,
what else did you miss?

46
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,731
Susan, it's gonna be okay.

47
00:02:37,856 --> 00:02:41,594
How is it going to be okay?
Someone is calling the dead guy.

48
00:02:43,097 --> 00:02:44,872
- "Home."
- See?

49
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:48,277
He has a home... with
people who care about him,

50
00:02:48,277 --> 00:02:50,433
people who are going to
come looking for him,

51
00:02:50,433 --> 00:02:52,064
leading them straight to us.

52
00:02:52,064 --> 00:02:53,362
What do you want us to do?

53
00:02:53,362 --> 00:02:54,847
It's not too late. We...

54
00:02:54,847 --> 00:02:56,438
we could still go to the police.

55
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:58,563
And send my husband back to prison?

56
00:02:58,675 --> 00:03:00,075
This time for murder?

57
00:03:00,075 --> 00:03:01,959
No, not necessarily. It was self-defense.

58
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:04,679
He broke into your house.
He threatened you. We could explain that.

59
00:03:04,679 --> 00:03:07,629
Yeah, then we can explain how
we dumped him in a trunk,

60
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:10,282
ate some cheesecake,
and buried him in the woods!

61
00:03:10,282 --> 00:03:13,906
We are going to get caught.
People always get caught.

62
00:03:14,454 --> 00:03:18,060
We can't do this. We're not criminals.
We drive carpool.

63
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,246
That's enough.

64
00:03:21,032 --> 00:03:22,718
This is a very bad man.

65
00:03:23,823 --> 00:03:26,457
He attacked our friend,
and her husband protected her,

66
00:03:26,457 --> 00:03:28,465
and now we are gonna protect them.

67
00:03:31,771 --> 00:03:33,704
That means we tell no one.

68
00:03:34,331 --> 00:03:35,504
Not the police...

69
00:03:36,773 --> 00:03:38,175
not our families.

70
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:41,171
No one.

71
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:46,575
When we bury the body,
we bury the secret forever.

72
00:04:05,147 --> 00:04:06,126
Susan?

73
00:04:21,704 --> 00:04:24,774
Yes, it's only the best of friends

74
00:04:24,774 --> 00:04:27,038
who stay long after the party's over

75
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,785
to help clean up the mess...

76
00:04:31,274 --> 00:04:34,902
Even when that mess may be bigger

77
00:04:34,902 --> 00:04:36,714
than they bargained for.

78
00:04:48,567 --> 00:04:52,722
It has been said that change
doesn't happen overnight,

79
00:04:52,722 --> 00:04:54,773
but over the course of month,

80
00:04:54,849 --> 00:04:58,590
it's amazing how much the ground
can shift beneath us.

81
00:05:00,604 --> 00:05:03,027
A woman who helped conceal a crime

82
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,659
is now sleeping with a detective.

83
00:05:07,935 --> 00:05:11,119
A man who used to look forward to bedtime...

84
00:05:11,234 --> 00:05:14,166
is now finding himself dreading it.

85
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:19,496
A woman who once told her husband everything

86
00:05:20,358 --> 00:05:23,527
is now keeping a terrible secret.

87
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:29,852
And a couple who have decided to separate

88
00:05:29,852 --> 00:05:33,020
is now going to great lengths to show

89
00:05:33,021 --> 00:05:35,252
that nothing has changed.

90
00:05:40,902 --> 00:05:43,299
Crap! Crap! Crap! Crap!

91
00:05:50,586 --> 00:05:52,708
Aah! Son of a...

92
00:06:08,272 --> 00:06:10,007
Hey, hey, hey, guys!

93
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:12,587
Got up early, so I figured, what the heck?

94
00:06:12,587 --> 00:06:15,138
I'll go get your mom some coffee...
the good stuff.

95
00:06:15,159 --> 00:06:16,144
She deserves it.

96
00:06:16,144 --> 00:06:18,644
She needs it, too.
I didn't sleep last night.

97
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,977
But you would know that. You were there.

98
00:06:21,856 --> 00:06:24,558
Do not drink this.
It's been in my car for three days.

99
00:06:26,207 --> 00:06:27,686
Where are your shoes, dad?

100
00:06:28,664 --> 00:06:30,153
It's casual friday.

101
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,386
Casual thursday.

102
00:06:34,002 --> 00:06:35,979
Come on. We're gonna miss the bus.

103
00:06:36,877 --> 00:06:38,745
See ya later. I'll see ya at dinner.

104
00:06:38,745 --> 00:06:39,798
Love you.

105
00:06:40,947 --> 00:06:43,589
God, I practically lost a toe out there.

106
00:06:43,589 --> 00:06:45,887
It wouldn't have happened
if you hadn't overslept.

107
00:06:46,241 --> 00:06:48,800
Yeah, well, you know,
you took the good alarm clock

108
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,575
along with the good pillow and the house.

109
00:06:51,256 --> 00:06:54,643
This is ridiculous. We have to
tell the kids we've separated.

110
00:06:54,774 --> 00:06:57,539
We will, but this weekend
is Gaby's big barbecue,

111
00:06:57,539 --> 00:06:59,045
and I don't wanna ruin it for them.

112
00:06:59,045 --> 00:07:00,478
Yeah, and last weekend,

113
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:01,868
you didn't wanna ruin
the basketball tournament.

114
00:07:01,868 --> 00:07:05,108
The weekend before that,
Penny's birthday. Come on, Lynette.

115
00:07:05,795 --> 00:07:07,265
Are you sure this is about the kids?

116
00:07:07,265 --> 00:07:08,812
What else would it be?

117
00:07:10,156 --> 00:07:12,138
No, Tom, nothing's changed.

118
00:07:12,138 --> 00:07:14,242
We still need time away from each other.

119
00:07:14,242 --> 00:07:16,662
Yeah, I agree. We got a lot
of problems to work out,

120
00:07:16,662 --> 00:07:18,520
so why can't we tell the kids?

121
00:07:18,664 --> 00:07:21,536
I just think they deserve
one more happy weekend

122
00:07:21,536 --> 00:07:23,509
before we tear this family apart.

123
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:24,820
You know what? You're...

124
00:07:26,385 --> 00:07:27,463
Paige is up.

125
00:07:31,188 --> 00:07:32,035
Mmm.

126
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:33,369
Mmm. Mmm.

127
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:36,058
Don't take this the wrong way,

128
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:38,798
but you could do this professionally.

129
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,775
Coming from a man
who's on a first-name basis

130
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:43,657
with half the hookers in Fairview,

131
00:07:44,022 --> 00:07:46,235
that's quite a compliment, detective.

132
00:07:46,894 --> 00:07:49,693
Hey, I was thinking maybe this weekend,

133
00:07:49,693 --> 00:07:51,496
we could head up to that
place in the mountains,

134
00:07:51,496 --> 00:07:52,203
just the two of us.

135
00:07:52,203 --> 00:07:53,502
Oh, that sounds lovely,

136
00:07:53,502 --> 00:07:56,853
but Gaby is having her
annual barbecue on saturday.

137
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,591
Am I invited?

138
00:07:59,747 --> 00:08:01,570
Of course you are. Why wouldn't you be?

139
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:03,920
Oh, I don't know. Maybe because
your friends don't like me.

140
00:08:05,286 --> 00:08:08,335
What? You are imagining things.

141
00:08:08,335 --> 00:08:09,337
It's true.

142
00:08:09,337 --> 00:08:13,105
They don't talk to me.
They don't make eye contact.

143
00:08:13,105 --> 00:08:14,497
It's been that way for weeks,

144
00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:16,515
ever since the night of the dinner party.

145
00:08:18,694 --> 00:08:19,529
Why...

146
00:08:19,529 --> 00:08:21,251
Uh, why would you say that?

147
00:08:21,438 --> 00:08:25,231
Bree, I'm a cop.
I got an eye for human behavior.

148
00:08:25,231 --> 00:08:27,221
That was when everything changed.

149
00:08:29,194 --> 00:08:31,418
I just can't figure out why.

150
00:08:31,418 --> 00:08:34,260
I keep going over that night, hour by hour.

151
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:37,834
Well, stop... going over that night,

152
00:08:37,834 --> 00:08:40,497
because everything is fine.

153
00:08:40,497 --> 00:08:42,751
The girls are just as
crazy about you as I am.

154
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:45,169
I don't know. I'm not feeling it.

155
00:08:47,811 --> 00:08:49,134
Well...

156
00:08:50,185 --> 00:08:51,719
Are you feeling this?

157
00:08:57,479 --> 00:08:59,417
Bree, I know what's going on.

158
00:08:59,417 --> 00:09:01,509
You're trying to distract me with sex,

159
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:03,442
and if that's the case...

160
00:09:04,698 --> 00:09:05,333
Mmm.

161
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:06,537
Bring it on.

162
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:13,380
Wake up! I made you waffles.

163
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:16,404
Come back when you learn
how to make mimosas.

164
00:09:16,852 --> 00:09:19,808
Come on! I left Celia alone with them.
There won't be any left.

165
00:09:19,808 --> 00:09:21,755
Damn it, Juanita! That's enough!

166
00:09:22,424 --> 00:09:23,895
Get outta here now!

167
00:09:26,496 --> 00:09:27,626
Carlos!

168
00:09:29,326 --> 00:09:31,185
Juanita, honey, I'm sorry!

169
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,399
Why have you been so short-tempered lately?

170
00:09:34,863 --> 00:09:36,158
Gosh, I don't know.

171
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:40,911
Maybe I'm upset about
my golf swing or the economy...

172
00:09:41,612 --> 00:09:44,306
or maybe it's because I killed a guy.

173
00:09:45,526 --> 00:09:47,396
Look, I get it, okay?

174
00:09:47,396 --> 00:09:49,219
But we have to move on with our lives.

175
00:09:49,661 --> 00:09:51,358
Don't you think I want to?

176
00:09:52,674 --> 00:09:53,972
I just can't stop thinking about this.

177
00:09:53,972 --> 00:09:55,453
No matter what I do,

178
00:09:55,955 --> 00:09:59,350
it's this horrible thing
that is always there.

179
00:10:00,602 --> 00:10:02,414
I need to talk to someone.

180
00:10:02,963 --> 00:10:05,536
I know a guy named Tom Collins.
He's a great listener.

181
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:07,622
I meant father Dugan.

182
00:10:08,126 --> 00:10:10,778
Okay, are you crazy? You can't tell anyone.

183
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:12,134
That's too risky.

184
00:10:12,134 --> 00:10:14,702
A priest can't share
what you say in confession.

185
00:10:14,702 --> 00:10:17,080
Are you sure he's not just
gonna make you feel guiltier?

186
00:10:17,107 --> 00:10:18,853
I mean, that's their thing.

187
00:10:21,943 --> 00:10:23,775
Fine. We'll go see the priest.

188
00:10:25,335 --> 00:10:26,629
I have to.

189
00:10:27,732 --> 00:10:30,286
I'm turning into a terrible husband, father.

190
00:10:32,543 --> 00:10:34,317
I need to get this off my conscience.

191
00:10:34,923 --> 00:10:36,308
It's tearing me apart.

192
00:10:51,963 --> 00:10:52,963
Susan.

193
00:10:53,044 --> 00:10:54,399
What are you doing?

194
00:10:54,661 --> 00:10:56,789
Oh. I was looking out the window,

195
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:59,485
and I noticed dust in the
corner of each windowpane.

196
00:10:59,485 --> 00:11:01,011
It's been driving me nuts.

197
00:11:02,609 --> 00:11:03,755
Okay.

198
00:11:04,649 --> 00:11:06,037
What's going on with you?

199
00:11:06,803 --> 00:11:07,610
What do you mean?

200
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:10,374
Well, there's a lot of weird stuff
you like to do in the bedroom,

201
00:11:10,374 --> 00:11:12,546
but cleaning... not so much.

202
00:11:13,659 --> 00:11:14,628
Couldn't sleep.

203
00:11:15,405 --> 00:11:17,549
Yeah, that's been happening a lot lately.

204
00:11:17,549 --> 00:11:19,220
You don't sleep. You don't eat.

205
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,550
You never leave the house.

206
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:21,759
That's not true.

207
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,907
I'm substitute teaching today.

208
00:11:24,027 --> 00:11:26,446
And that's great, but...

209
00:11:28,257 --> 00:11:29,706
Did you have a fight with the girls?

210
00:11:30,376 --> 00:11:31,376
What?

211
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:33,458
Why would you say that?

212
00:11:34,341 --> 00:11:35,429
Well, a month ago,

213
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:37,604
you were so excited
to move back to the lane,

214
00:11:37,685 --> 00:11:39,162
and now you never see 'em.

215
00:11:40,498 --> 00:11:43,150
There's... no coffee, no poker,

216
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:47,100
no... bitching about husbands
over coffee and poker.

217
00:11:48,038 --> 00:11:49,474
The girls and I are fine.

218
00:11:49,954 --> 00:11:51,160
Then what is it?

219
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:56,704
Come on, Susan. It's me.

220
00:11:57,528 --> 00:11:59,082
You can tell me anything.

221
00:12:02,177 --> 00:12:03,525
I'm going for a run.

222
00:12:05,018 --> 00:12:06,007
Susan.

223
00:12:06,215 --> 00:12:08,202
Well, you said I should
get out of the house more.

224
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:48,901
Hey.

225
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,501
So what do we know
about the new guy?

226
00:12:50,501 --> 00:12:52,420
Definitely rich. Check out the car.

227
00:12:53,624 --> 00:12:55,799
Definitely single. Check out the fish.

228
00:12:57,129 --> 00:12:58,742
Rich and single...

229
00:12:58,742 --> 00:13:01,777
I wonder what he looks like.
You rarely get the trifecta.

230
00:13:01,777 --> 00:13:02,936
What's your guess?

231
00:13:02,974 --> 00:13:05,475
Wonky eye? Rabbit teeth? Comb-over?

232
00:13:05,475 --> 00:13:07,763
One normal eyebrow, one really big one?

233
00:13:07,979 --> 00:13:09,200
Baby hands?

234
00:13:10,775 --> 00:13:13,720
I had it all on one guy. Did not end well.

235
00:13:14,373 --> 00:13:16,802
Well, I actually saw our
new neighbor this morning.

236
00:13:16,802 --> 00:13:19,306
Hmm. 6'1". 190.

237
00:13:19,306 --> 00:13:22,079
He was wearing this
great-looking pair of jeans.

238
00:13:22,339 --> 00:13:23,394
And let me just say,

239
00:13:23,394 --> 00:13:25,312
I can tell you one thing that isn't wonky.

240
00:13:25,312 --> 00:13:26,567
Gaby.

241
00:13:27,036 --> 00:13:29,393
Oh, come on. I'm married. I'm not dead.

242
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:32,061
Can still imagine all
the dirty things I'd do to him.

243
00:13:32,205 --> 00:13:33,810
- Like what?
- Oh, god!

244
00:13:33,869 --> 00:13:37,025
Oh! I didn't know you were...

245
00:13:38,753 --> 00:13:40,120
I'm Susan Delfino.

246
00:13:40,258 --> 00:13:41,106
Ah.

247
00:13:41,106 --> 00:13:42,100
Nice to meet you.

248
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,194
Ben Faulkner.

249
00:13:43,194 --> 00:13:44,022
Hi.

250
00:13:44,022 --> 00:13:45,610
Well, I'm actually 6'2",

251
00:13:45,819 --> 00:13:47,926
and I haven't been 190
since I played rugby,

252
00:13:48,044 --> 00:13:49,094
but, uh, thank you.

253
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,186
Uh, and as for the jeans,

254
00:13:51,186 --> 00:13:52,602
you know, I could never figure out

255
00:13:52,602 --> 00:13:55,339
why they would cost 200 bucks. Now I know.

256
00:13:57,912 --> 00:13:59,118
Ladies, excuse me.

257
00:13:59,118 --> 00:14:01,038
- Oh. Okay.
- Thanks.

258
00:14:01,923 --> 00:14:02,743
Welcome.

259
00:14:04,904 --> 00:14:05,879
Dibs.

260
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,860
Look who's out.

261
00:14:10,457 --> 00:14:11,807
Hey, Susan!

262
00:14:11,807 --> 00:14:13,498
Uh, would you like
to join us for coffee?!

263
00:14:13,498 --> 00:14:15,599
Uh, sorry. I can't talk.

264
00:14:15,599 --> 00:14:17,632
I'm subbing today! Can't be late!

265
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,402
Is anyone talking to her?

266
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:22,246
I tried. She's not returning my calls.

267
00:14:22,246 --> 00:14:24,787
Same here. She's obviously avoiding us.

268
00:14:24,787 --> 00:14:27,039
I'm telling you, that is one loose cannon.

269
00:14:27,526 --> 00:14:29,271
Well, we have got
to get her back in the fold.

270
00:14:29,271 --> 00:14:30,812
This is too risky.

271
00:14:32,155 --> 00:14:34,213
Says the woman
who's dating a cop.

272
00:14:35,138 --> 00:14:37,966
Did it ever occur to you that
it might be good to keep him close?

273
00:14:38,171 --> 00:14:39,693
If there's ever an investigation,

274
00:14:39,693 --> 00:14:41,279
I will be the first to know.

275
00:14:43,013 --> 00:14:44,766
I'm doing this for us.

276
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,458
He's that good in the sack?

277
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,576
You have no idea.

278
00:14:52,373 --> 00:14:55,141
And when you finish your
worksheets on ladybugs,

279
00:14:55,141 --> 00:14:57,866
we will go outside and
see if we can find some.

280
00:14:59,322 --> 00:15:01,681
Susan, how's it going?

281
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:02,816
Good.

282
00:15:03,683 --> 00:15:05,130
It's nice to be back.

283
00:15:06,264 --> 00:15:06,885
To be honest,

284
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,787
I've been feeling a little down lately.

285
00:15:08,822 --> 00:15:10,353
This is just what I needed.

286
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:11,642
Mrs. Delfino?

287
00:15:12,325 --> 00:15:13,684
Cupcake's not moving.

288
00:15:13,827 --> 00:15:15,600
She's probably sleeping, honey.

289
00:15:15,762 --> 00:15:18,096
No, I poked her with
my pencil a couple times.

290
00:15:18,131 --> 00:15:19,920
She is d-e-a dead.

291
00:15:20,537 --> 00:15:23,692
Uh... it's okay, kids. I know what to do.

292
00:15:24,737 --> 00:15:25,830
Oh, my god. What do I do?

293
00:15:26,472 --> 00:15:27,462
There's a little spot in the garden

294
00:15:27,462 --> 00:15:29,141
where we bury the class pets.

295
00:15:30,577 --> 00:15:31,847
- Bury?
- Yeah.

296
00:15:31,947 --> 00:15:34,334
Have a little funeral. Say a few words.

297
00:15:34,568 --> 00:15:35,714
Just don't mention god.

298
00:15:35,748 --> 00:15:39,402
Amanda's parents are atheists,
lawyers, and major douches.

299
00:15:48,716 --> 00:15:50,062
Bless me, father, for I have sinned.

300
00:15:50,096 --> 00:15:51,697
It's been a while since my last confession.

301
00:15:51,731 --> 00:15:53,046
Continue, my son.

302
00:15:54,534 --> 00:15:56,266
"My son." I'm sorry.

303
00:15:56,266 --> 00:15:59,084
It's just you're, like,
a thousand years older than me.

304
00:16:01,274 --> 00:16:03,275
Who are you and where's father Dugan?

305
00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:05,777
Leaving on sabbatical.
Fun for him and fun for me.

306
00:16:05,812 --> 00:16:08,013
This is my first week of confessions.

307
00:16:08,047 --> 00:16:09,052
It is?

308
00:16:09,337 --> 00:16:11,917
Yeah, and, man, the things I've heard.

309
00:16:11,951 --> 00:16:13,685
There was a lady yesterday who...

310
00:16:15,521 --> 00:16:16,889
No, no, no, I can't say it.

311
00:16:17,482 --> 00:16:19,057
I think I'll come back.

312
00:16:19,092 --> 00:16:20,959
Unh-unh. No. You're not going anywhere.

313
00:16:20,994 --> 00:16:22,394
I told you to wait in the car.

314
00:16:22,428 --> 00:16:24,252
Don't snap at me. That's why we're here.

315
00:16:24,342 --> 00:16:26,698
You keep saying you wanna talk to someone,
so talk to this guy.

316
00:16:26,733 --> 00:16:29,268
He seems perfectly... enthusiastic.

317
00:16:29,302 --> 00:16:32,104
He's 12 years old.
This will blow his collar off.

318
00:16:32,138 --> 00:16:34,072
Oh, man, this must be awesome.

319
00:16:34,107 --> 00:16:36,008
I'm so bummed I can't tweet anymore.

320
00:16:36,042 --> 00:16:38,424
Sorry. If it's not father Dugan,
I'm not doing this.

321
00:16:38,424 --> 00:16:39,502
No... let's go.

322
00:16:40,534 --> 00:16:41,474
Nuts.

323
00:16:42,215 --> 00:16:44,194
I was really hoping
this would be a good one.

324
00:16:45,114 --> 00:16:47,352
I made out with two chicks once in college.

325
00:16:49,355 --> 00:16:50,642
This job rocks!

326
00:16:58,731 --> 00:16:59,786
Uh...

327
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:02,276
I don't know if you've ever
buried anything before,

328
00:17:02,276 --> 00:17:04,004
but you have to dig a hole.

329
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:08,416
Right. Of course.

330
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:11,834
I knew that.

331
00:17:17,917 --> 00:17:20,652
It's funny the way life works
out sometimes, isn't it?

332
00:17:23,289 --> 00:17:25,996
I mean, I wasn't even
supposed to be here today.

333
00:17:27,952 --> 00:17:31,034
Once again, in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

334
00:17:33,399 --> 00:17:35,334
Now I have to carry this around with me

335
00:17:35,368 --> 00:17:36,766
for the rest of my life.

336
00:17:37,503 --> 00:17:39,366
Don't be sad, Mrs. Delfino.

337
00:17:39,772 --> 00:17:41,840
Cupcake was kind of a bad hamster.

338
00:17:41,874 --> 00:17:43,826
She had three babies and ate them.

339
00:17:44,043 --> 00:17:46,311
But does that mean she deserved to die?

340
00:17:46,346 --> 00:17:48,647
We don't get to make that call, Juanita.

341
00:17:48,681 --> 00:17:50,268
We're not god.

342
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:52,356
That's right, Amanda. I said it.

343
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,320
What have I done?

344
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:00,962
It's not your fault.

345
00:18:00,962 --> 00:18:02,694
I know it's not my fault,

346
00:18:02,729 --> 00:18:04,629
but try telling that to Cupcake's family

347
00:18:04,664 --> 00:18:06,582
when they show up looking for her.

348
00:18:11,344 --> 00:18:12,094
There.

349
00:18:12,879 --> 00:18:13,708
We're done.

350
00:18:14,013 --> 00:18:15,814
Now let's all slap on a happy face

351
00:18:15,849 --> 00:18:17,556
and pretend like this never happened.

352
00:18:26,961 --> 00:18:28,244
Can I come in?

353
00:18:28,696 --> 00:18:31,332
I'm really not feeling
like drinking right now.

354
00:18:31,632 --> 00:18:34,501
Great. Mmm.

355
00:18:37,805 --> 00:18:39,830
So... were you two close?

356
00:18:41,818 --> 00:18:42,642
Pardon?

357
00:18:42,676 --> 00:18:44,377
You and Cupcake.

358
00:18:44,412 --> 00:18:45,798
Juanita told me what happened.

359
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,708
I assume you two had a long history,

360
00:18:49,126 --> 00:18:51,898
went to college together,
backpacked through Europe.

361
00:18:52,109 --> 00:18:55,143
It just sort of hit me in a weird way.

362
00:18:57,658 --> 00:18:58,862
I'm worried about you.

363
00:18:59,827 --> 00:19:01,294
First, you stop talking to your friends.

364
00:19:01,328 --> 00:19:02,836
Now you're wigging out at a rat funeral.

365
00:19:02,836 --> 00:19:04,184
You're making me nervous.

366
00:19:04,498 --> 00:19:07,167
Well, I'm sorry I'm not
handling accessory to murder

367
00:19:07,201 --> 00:19:08,748
as well as the rest of you.

368
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,831
Susan, I'm begging you.

369
00:19:12,334 --> 00:19:15,014
This is my husband's
life we're talking about.

370
00:19:15,171 --> 00:19:17,539
If anything were to happen to him,

371
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,900
think of what would
happen to me and my girls.

372
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,411
I know you're having a hard time,

373
00:19:23,445 --> 00:19:25,112
but please hold it together.

374
00:19:25,952 --> 00:19:27,348
I'm trying.

375
00:19:29,242 --> 00:19:30,112
Try harder.

376
00:19:39,561 --> 00:19:40,495
Bree?

377
00:19:41,422 --> 00:19:42,564
Do I smell...

378
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,366
Yes, white chocolate macadamia nut...
your favorite.

379
00:19:45,401 --> 00:19:46,641
Oh!

380
00:19:46,641 --> 00:19:49,071
Now you're my favorite. Mwah.

381
00:19:49,071 --> 00:19:50,250
Hmm.

382
00:19:50,788 --> 00:19:52,025
How was your day?

383
00:19:52,112 --> 00:19:55,109
Terrific. I found a dead body.

384
00:19:56,412 --> 00:19:57,712
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.

385
00:19:57,746 --> 00:19:58,713
You don't wanna hear about this.

386
00:19:58,747 --> 00:20:01,983
No, I do. Your work is fascinating.

387
00:20:02,813 --> 00:20:06,164
So, um, where exactly
did you find this body?

388
00:20:06,355 --> 00:20:08,130
Warehouse out by the docks.

389
00:20:09,558 --> 00:20:12,480
So now I'm a big hero
because I cracked a case

390
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,761
those poor bastards in New haven P.D.

391
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:14,896
have been working on for months.

392
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:16,364
Oh, good for you.

393
00:20:16,398 --> 00:20:18,433
Mm. I got lucky.

394
00:20:18,748 --> 00:20:21,538
All I did was spot a sedan
with Connecticut plates,

395
00:20:23,294 --> 00:20:25,634
and I asked myself, "Who owns that car?"

396
00:20:27,498 --> 00:20:28,765
The dead man had a car.

397
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,567
Exactly. The killers did everything right,

398
00:20:30,601 --> 00:20:33,036
but they forgot to get
rid of the victim's ride.

399
00:20:33,612 --> 00:20:34,871
What idiots.

400
00:20:34,905 --> 00:20:36,239
Mm-hmm.

401
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:38,241
So you kept his keys,

402
00:20:38,275 --> 00:20:40,143
but it never occurred
to you he might have a car.

403
00:20:40,177 --> 00:20:42,045
I just threw all his stuff in our safe.

404
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:43,313
I didn't spend a lot of
time thinking about it.

405
00:20:45,349 --> 00:20:46,349
There it is.

406
00:20:49,987 --> 00:20:51,487
Drop it off in a bad part of town,

407
00:20:51,522 --> 00:20:53,806
and let social decay... take its course.

408
00:20:54,868 --> 00:20:56,566
Oh, god, do you have to tidy up?

409
00:20:56,566 --> 00:20:59,708
Get in. If anybody catches
us in this car, we're dead.

410
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:05,101
Oh, no, it's a stick.

411
00:21:05,135 --> 00:21:06,869
I can't drive a stick. Can you?

412
00:21:06,904 --> 00:21:08,108
I did once in high school.

413
00:21:08,222 --> 00:21:10,164
It's easy. Just one extra pedal.

414
00:21:14,545 --> 00:21:16,145
Oh.

415
00:21:17,214 --> 00:21:18,815
It was easier when I was drunk.

416
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,502
What should I do? Should I gun it?

417
00:21:30,652 --> 00:21:32,809
Gun it? You can't even drive it.

418
00:21:40,088 --> 00:21:41,394
I thought that was you.

419
00:21:45,126 --> 00:21:48,162
- Chuck. Look, Gaby, it's Chuck.
- Mm.

420
00:21:48,196 --> 00:21:50,632
I-I saw you were struggling.

421
00:21:51,499 --> 00:21:52,566
Whose car is this?

422
00:21:53,207 --> 00:21:54,902
- My aunt's.
- My friend's.

423
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:58,401
Her aunt and my friend.

424
00:21:58,475 --> 00:21:59,445
Aunt Shirley.

425
00:22:00,048 --> 00:22:03,689
She, uh, came over to my place
last night for book club, and...

426
00:22:03,812 --> 00:22:05,119
She had too much to drink.

427
00:22:05,318 --> 00:22:06,324
Classic Shirley.

428
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:08,449
So we told her we'd bring
her car back today.

429
00:22:08,483 --> 00:22:10,668
- In fact, she's waiting for us,
so we should scoot.
- Yeah.

430
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:11,470
No way.

431
00:22:13,688 --> 00:22:15,766
- I'll drive.
- What?

432
00:22:16,191 --> 00:22:18,468
The way you guys are going,
you're gonna kill someone.

433
00:22:18,993 --> 00:22:21,336
Go, Bob. I'll meet you back at the station.

434
00:22:21,532 --> 00:22:24,698
Oh, no, Bob, Bob, don't go! Bob? Oh.

435
00:22:28,036 --> 00:22:29,160
Well...

436
00:22:29,698 --> 00:22:32,473
Okay, a road trip in this neat old car

437
00:22:32,507 --> 00:22:34,859
with your cop boyfriend. Fun.

438
00:22:40,181 --> 00:22:42,024
So where does Shirley live?

439
00:22:42,784 --> 00:22:44,651
Yeah, Bree, where does she live?

440
00:22:44,686 --> 00:22:47,330
Why are you asking me? She's your aunt.

441
00:22:47,596 --> 00:22:49,952
Just keep driving.
I'll tell you when to turn.

442
00:22:52,861 --> 00:22:54,962
Huh. That's interesting.

443
00:22:54,996 --> 00:22:55,837
No, it's not.

444
00:22:56,631 --> 00:22:58,756
I mean... what is?

445
00:22:59,771 --> 00:23:02,232
Oklahoma city redhawks.
Is your aunt a fan?

446
00:23:02,337 --> 00:23:07,430
Oh, yeah, Shirley loves that... uh... sport.

447
00:23:08,309 --> 00:23:10,568
And... men's cologne?

448
00:23:11,012 --> 00:23:12,235
She's a lesbian.

449
00:23:13,564 --> 00:23:16,473
Yeah. She could've been married,
but, no, she's a lesbian.

450
00:23:19,582 --> 00:23:22,623
So, this, um, aunt or... friend,

451
00:23:22,657 --> 00:23:25,226
who's a men's cologne-wearing lesbian...

452
00:23:25,717 --> 00:23:27,929
she also likes to chew tobacco?

453
00:23:30,651 --> 00:23:32,890
'Cause I never met a woman
who likes to chew...

454
00:23:33,788 --> 00:23:35,030
ever.

455
00:23:37,643 --> 00:23:38,972
I chew tobacco.

456
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:41,114
And I'm a woman.

457
00:23:43,314 --> 00:23:44,364
Yeah.

458
00:23:45,102 --> 00:23:46,098
Mmm.

459
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:51,378
All that's missing is a glass of chardonnay.

460
00:23:52,894 --> 00:23:54,541
I keep telling her to quit.

461
00:23:55,131 --> 00:23:56,610
"Do you want mouth cancer?" I say,

462
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:58,182
but she won't listen.

463
00:24:00,637 --> 00:24:01,638
You okay?

464
00:24:01,878 --> 00:24:03,968
Yeah. Ugh!

465
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,796
No. Pull over. Now.

466
00:24:13,882 --> 00:24:17,570
Sorry! Shirley likes plain.
I prefer chocolate.

467
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:19,322
Oh!

468
00:24:23,651 --> 00:24:24,651
Get out.

469
00:24:24,686 --> 00:24:25,344
What?

470
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,594
I'm taking your car.

471
00:24:27,234 --> 00:24:29,134
Oh, my god. I could kiss you!

472
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,725
What? What are you... Just get out!

473
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:33,218
Shh! Keep your voice down.

474
00:24:33,218 --> 00:24:34,882
That man over there is a cop.

475
00:24:34,882 --> 00:24:35,856
A cop?

476
00:24:36,698 --> 00:24:38,432
No! Get back in here.

477
00:24:38,466 --> 00:24:40,645
When you start something,
young man, you see it through.

478
00:24:43,805 --> 00:24:44,905
Buckle up!

479
00:24:51,412 --> 00:24:53,971
Hey, what happened?

480
00:24:56,484 --> 00:24:58,640
Shirley. Just happened to be walking by.

481
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,273
Isn't that a stroke of luck?

482
00:25:02,465 --> 00:25:05,868
So do you think your friend
Bob could give us a ride home?

483
00:25:05,902 --> 00:25:08,194
Sure. I'll... I'll call him.

484
00:25:13,007 --> 00:25:15,345
So how's that dating a cop
while covering up a murder

485
00:25:15,345 --> 00:25:16,679
working out for you?

486
00:25:23,721 --> 00:25:26,290
Hey, Renee. Ladies.

487
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:30,086
Don't distract them.
They have an important job to do.

488
00:25:30,086 --> 00:25:31,720
I'm gonna go see the new neighbor.

489
00:25:31,755 --> 00:25:34,576
You know, give him a ride
on the ol' welcome wagon.

490
00:25:34,858 --> 00:25:35,500
Wow, that was fast.

491
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,065
- I didn't know you two had even talked.
- We haven't.

492
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:41,363
So what makes you think
he's gonna be interested?

493
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,408
Hear that, ladies? Watch and learn.

494
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:48,178
I will show you some of my secrets.

495
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:56,111
Hi. I'm gonna save us some time.

496
00:25:56,146 --> 00:25:58,480
Look, I'm single. You're single.

497
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:01,917
I'm hot. You're hot.
Assuming you're not gay,

498
00:26:01,952 --> 00:26:04,286
and those shoes tell me you're not,

499
00:26:04,321 --> 00:26:07,423
we could do that thing where
we flirt for a few weeks.

500
00:26:07,457 --> 00:26:09,558
You can stare at my ass getting the mail,

501
00:26:09,593 --> 00:26:12,702
and I do get my mail four times a day.

502
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:18,672
Or you... could invite me in
for... coffee...

503
00:26:19,336 --> 00:26:20,244
Right now.

504
00:26:21,151 --> 00:26:23,648
Thanks for the offer, but, uh, I'm good.

505
00:26:27,192 --> 00:26:29,378
Um, when I said "coffee,"

506
00:26:29,412 --> 00:26:33,015
you did know I meant sex, right?

507
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:36,569
Oh, you were subtle, but,
uh, yeah. I got it.

508
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:46,886
Wow. You should write a book.

509
00:26:46,992 --> 00:26:49,838
Otherwise, when you die,
your secrets will die with you.

510
00:26:57,004 --> 00:26:58,259
Father Dugan!

511
00:26:58,441 --> 00:27:00,058
I'm so glad I caught you.

512
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:01,384
I don't know if you remember me.

513
00:27:01,733 --> 00:27:04,647
Gabrielle Solis.
I assume you've come to apologize

514
00:27:04,681 --> 00:27:07,349
for taking a phone call
during my easter sermon?

515
00:27:07,384 --> 00:27:09,652
Oh! I'm sorry, father. But, you know,

516
00:27:09,686 --> 00:27:11,726
if you don't confirm those spa
appointments, you lose 'em.

517
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:12,565
Yeah.

518
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:15,818
Um, anyway, I came here about Carlos.

519
00:27:16,126 --> 00:27:17,375
He's in trouble, and he needs your help.

520
00:27:17,475 --> 00:27:19,561
Well, I'd love to help Carlos.
He's a good man.

521
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:20,830
But I'm afraid you're too late.

522
00:27:20,936 --> 00:27:24,226
What? You were the one who
kept blabbing in that sermon

523
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:26,480
how it's never too late
to confess your sins.

524
00:27:27,424 --> 00:27:29,363
See? I can listen and take calls.

525
00:27:29,718 --> 00:27:32,341
It's true. God waits
until the heart is ready.

526
00:27:32,813 --> 00:27:34,470
But the airlines are a little stricter,

527
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:37,175
and I'm not going overseas in a middle seat.

528
00:27:37,374 --> 00:27:38,625
So if you'll excuse me.

529
00:27:40,183 --> 00:27:41,644
You getting on, too, miss?

530
00:27:41,706 --> 00:27:45,098
Uh, yes, but I couldn't... manage my bag.

531
00:27:45,292 --> 00:27:47,347
Be a dear and grab it for me?

532
00:27:51,699 --> 00:27:52,699
Hey.

533
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,046
What are you doing?

534
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:56,841
Taking you to the airport...

535
00:27:57,167 --> 00:27:58,867
with one quick detour.

536
00:28:01,037 --> 00:28:03,772
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Stop it! Stop it!

537
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:06,097
Are you crazy? I can't miss my plane.

538
00:28:06,173 --> 00:28:08,678
Well, I'm sorry if I'm trying
to get you to do god's work

539
00:28:08,678 --> 00:28:10,957
instead of going on your
dream vacation to...

540
00:28:10,957 --> 00:28:15,315
Rwanda, where I'll be
digging wells... for lepers.

541
00:28:16,466 --> 00:28:18,060
Well, your little friends
are gonna have to wait.

542
00:28:19,055 --> 00:28:21,156
- Excuse me.
- Whoa.

543
00:28:22,375 --> 00:28:23,984
Well, where did you u me from?

544
00:28:24,121 --> 00:28:25,631
We're headed off on our honeymoon.

545
00:28:25,631 --> 00:28:27,104
And we can't have any detours.

546
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:29,414
They say you have to get to
the airport three hours early

547
00:28:29,414 --> 00:28:30,578
for international flights.

548
00:28:30,671 --> 00:28:32,925
Oh, honey, relax. Since we caught Bin Laden,

549
00:28:32,925 --> 00:28:34,902
you can stroll on
the plane anytime you want.

550
00:28:37,474 --> 00:28:39,858
It's just, I've done something, father,

551
00:28:40,043 --> 00:28:41,733
And I'm afraid that it's...

552
00:28:42,411 --> 00:28:43,480
unforgivable.

553
00:28:44,017 --> 00:28:45,737
God can forgive us for anything.

554
00:28:46,012 --> 00:28:47,520
Really? Anything?

555
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:48,650
Yes.

556
00:28:48,786 --> 00:28:51,791
If we're willing to show
that we are truly repentant.

557
00:28:51,959 --> 00:28:52,827
How?

558
00:28:53,222 --> 00:28:56,059
Well, it's not by what we say.

559
00:28:56,325 --> 00:28:57,470
It's by what we do.

560
00:28:59,451 --> 00:29:02,908
For instance, if we were
talking about a crime...

561
00:29:04,967 --> 00:29:06,934
then confessing to the authorities

562
00:29:06,969 --> 00:29:09,737
would prove the intentions of our heart.

563
00:29:12,374 --> 00:29:13,790
That...

564
00:29:14,943 --> 00:29:16,210
is not an option.

565
00:29:18,514 --> 00:29:20,682
There are other people involved...
innocent people.

566
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:23,718
You can't ask to be absolved

567
00:29:23,752 --> 00:29:25,993
for a sin that you intend to keep hidden.

568
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:31,978
You should go.

569
00:29:33,228 --> 00:29:34,627
You're gonna miss your flight.

570
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:36,817
I don't wanna leave you, Carlos,

571
00:29:37,132 --> 00:29:40,094
not till I'm sure that you're gonna be okay.

572
00:29:40,636 --> 00:29:44,371
Father Dugan, I don't see any way

573
00:29:44,773 --> 00:29:46,588
that I am ever going to be okay.

574
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:01,744
Hey.

575
00:30:03,611 --> 00:30:04,520
Hey.

576
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,364
I wish I could make you
stop thinking about this.

577
00:30:23,229 --> 00:30:24,433
Yeah, me, too.

578
00:30:30,426 --> 00:30:32,327
I don't even know what I was looking for.

579
00:30:36,966 --> 00:30:39,561
There is no absolution for this thing.

580
00:30:42,433 --> 00:30:43,886
I just have to live with it.

581
00:30:59,047 --> 00:31:01,580
Every noise I'd hear at night, it was him.

582
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:07,174
Every dark alley I passed,
he was waiting for me.

583
00:31:09,196 --> 00:31:10,764
When I'd lie in bed,

584
00:31:12,057 --> 00:31:14,140
I was afraid he'd come find me.

585
00:31:16,785 --> 00:31:20,228
He was in my dreams... and in my nightmares.

586
00:31:20,229 --> 00:31:21,809
I couldn't escape him.

587
00:31:29,683 --> 00:31:31,637
And that's what I had to live with...

588
00:31:33,533 --> 00:31:34,725
until now.

589
00:31:41,474 --> 00:31:44,201
For the first time, I'm not scared.

590
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:48,354
You did that for me.

591
00:31:51,087 --> 00:31:52,098
Yeah...

592
00:31:53,419 --> 00:31:55,154
by taking a man's life.

593
00:31:59,153 --> 00:32:02,398
Yes, you may have taken a life,
but you also saved one.

594
00:32:06,404 --> 00:32:09,096
So if it's absolution you're looking for...

595
00:32:11,305 --> 00:32:12,820
I give it to you.

596
00:32:57,909 --> 00:32:59,043
- Hey.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

597
00:32:59,044 --> 00:33:00,659
Hey, is everything okay with the kids?

598
00:33:00,791 --> 00:33:03,573
Yeah, yeah, the...
the kids are fine. I just...

599
00:33:03,574 --> 00:33:04,699
What? Did something happen?

600
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,361
I really... need you right now.

601
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:11,015
Okay.

602
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,322
Morning.

603
00:33:40,337 --> 00:33:41,447
Morning.

604
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,617
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

605
00:33:44,618 --> 00:33:46,386
Crap, crap, crap.

606
00:33:50,335 --> 00:33:52,203
- Come on. Come on.
- Okay.

607
00:33:52,204 --> 00:33:53,984
- Watch out for the, uh...
- Okay, okay, o...

608
00:33:54,877 --> 00:33:57,345
- Honey. Ooh.
- No, I'm okay. Okay, go.

609
00:33:57,484 --> 00:33:59,027
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

610
00:34:02,232 --> 00:34:03,969
They're still asleep.

611
00:34:04,594 --> 00:34:05,790
Thank god.

612
00:34:09,253 --> 00:34:10,217
I'll start the coffee.

613
00:34:10,273 --> 00:34:12,146
Okay, you read my mind.

614
00:34:15,121 --> 00:34:17,162
- Hey.
- Yeah?

615
00:34:17,503 --> 00:34:18,732
So last night...

616
00:34:20,381 --> 00:34:21,494
Yeah.

617
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:23,907
We should talk about it.

618
00:34:25,775 --> 00:34:26,790
Uh-huh.

619
00:34:29,054 --> 00:34:30,105
I mean...

620
00:34:31,177 --> 00:34:33,119
If you wanna get back together...

621
00:34:34,035 --> 00:34:35,374
I'm open to that.

622
00:34:36,124 --> 00:34:39,435
But we have some serious problems

623
00:34:39,436 --> 00:34:43,386
that are gonna require serious work.

624
00:34:44,288 --> 00:34:45,690
Oh, god.

625
00:34:47,501 --> 00:34:48,852
Last night...

626
00:34:50,439 --> 00:34:51,266
uh...

627
00:34:53,523 --> 00:34:54,524
was...

628
00:34:55,033 --> 00:34:57,231
not about getting back together.

629
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,751
Then what the hell was it about?

630
00:35:02,408 --> 00:35:04,024
I...

631
00:35:06,103 --> 00:35:07,579
I had a nightmare.

632
00:35:09,663 --> 00:35:11,848
Well... a-a nightmare? Are you kidding me?

633
00:35:11,947 --> 00:35:13,031
You've gotta understand.

634
00:35:13,031 --> 00:35:15,664
I'm having a lot of nightmares.

635
00:35:15,665 --> 00:35:19,725
This is such a scary time,
and I really need you.

636
00:35:19,726 --> 00:35:22,340
That's-that's why I didn't
want to tell the kids.

637
00:35:22,341 --> 00:35:25,873
Having you across
the street makes me feel safe.

638
00:35:26,801 --> 00:35:28,452
You're unbelievable.

639
00:35:29,497 --> 00:35:31,375
You know what you do when
you're scared, Lynette?

640
00:35:31,526 --> 00:35:33,001
You buy a night-light.

641
00:35:33,112 --> 00:35:35,353
You don't go have sex with the guy

642
00:35:35,354 --> 00:35:37,755
you are supposed to be separated from!

643
00:35:42,448 --> 00:35:43,740
I want french toast.

644
00:35:43,823 --> 00:35:46,136
- I hate french toast. I want pancakes.
- Oh.

645
00:35:55,101 --> 00:35:56,218
Kids...

646
00:36:03,449 --> 00:36:05,702
there's something your mom
and I need to tell you.

647
00:36:09,572 --> 00:36:10,550
Yeah.

648
00:36:14,353 --> 00:36:16,190
Why don't we sit down?

649
00:36:22,869 --> 00:36:24,385
Hey, I, uh, I know it's a barbecue,

650
00:36:24,386 --> 00:36:26,886
but isn't that a little casual?

651
00:36:28,795 --> 00:36:29,864
Yeah, um,

652
00:36:30,349 --> 00:36:32,658
I don't think I'm gonna go this year.

653
00:36:32,876 --> 00:36:34,631
Why don't you go without me?

654
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:42,069
Hey, do I need to be worried?

655
00:36:42,647 --> 00:36:45,596
I told you. I'm fine.

656
00:36:46,143 --> 00:36:47,733
I don't mean worried about you.

657
00:36:48,143 --> 00:36:49,666
I mean worried about us.

658
00:36:51,908 --> 00:36:55,193
I thought this was some problem
between you and your friends, but...

659
00:36:56,382 --> 00:36:58,628
the way you've been shutting me out,

660
00:36:58,937 --> 00:37:00,989
I'm starting to think you've
got a problem with me.

661
00:37:02,186 --> 00:37:03,966
How could you say that?

662
00:37:06,613 --> 00:37:09,364
No matter what I'm going through,

663
00:37:09,574 --> 00:37:12,325
I would never let anything come between us.

664
00:37:14,314 --> 00:37:17,280
Yeah, I'm sure Tom and
Lynette felt the same way.

665
00:37:18,297 --> 00:37:19,699
Look where they ended up.

666
00:37:28,964 --> 00:37:30,914
Well, I'm headed over there without you.

667
00:37:32,185 --> 00:37:35,309
No. I'm going with you.

668
00:37:37,124 --> 00:37:38,226
You're right.

669
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:40,683
I do have a problem with the girls.

670
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:44,145
It's about time I went over
there and straightened it out.

671
00:37:47,075 --> 00:37:50,178
No! No way. You are not
bringing Mike in on this.

672
00:37:50,357 --> 00:37:52,809
He's not gonna tell anyone.
We can trust him.

673
00:37:52,909 --> 00:37:54,089
Oh, just like I could trust you

674
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:55,780
when we agreed to keep this between us?

675
00:37:56,008 --> 00:37:57,812
Susan, we all empathize with your position,

676
00:37:57,812 --> 00:38:00,147
but I don't think it's smart to tell Mike.

677
00:38:00,367 --> 00:38:02,297
Well, he knows something is up.

678
00:38:02,468 --> 00:38:03,943
It's affecting our marriage.

679
00:38:04,179 --> 00:38:05,499
You know what's gonna affect my marriage?

680
00:38:05,499 --> 00:38:06,905
when my husband goes to prison.

681
00:38:07,005 --> 00:38:09,049
I think we should let her tell him.

682
00:38:10,535 --> 00:38:11,743
I can't believe this.

683
00:38:11,903 --> 00:38:12,855
We all made a pact that night.

684
00:38:12,856 --> 00:38:13,853
I don't remember anybody bringing up

685
00:38:13,854 --> 00:38:15,788
These extra conditions.

686
00:38:15,923 --> 00:38:17,797
Well, you weren't exactly asking
anyone's opinion that night,

687
00:38:17,797 --> 00:38:18,624
were you, Bree?

688
00:38:18,779 --> 00:38:19,955
What is that supposed to mean?

689
00:38:19,956 --> 00:38:22,048
It means you elected yourself chairman

690
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:23,617
of the... dead guy committee

691
00:38:23,618 --> 00:38:25,784
and started making decisions for everyone.

692
00:38:25,785 --> 00:38:26,834
Like you always do.

693
00:38:26,835 --> 00:38:28,007
Well, somebody had to, Susan,

694
00:38:28,008 --> 00:38:29,952
And it sure as hell wasn't gonna be you.

695
00:38:31,656 --> 00:38:32,901
I'm done talking about this.

696
00:38:32,902 --> 00:38:34,332
The only reason I came to this barbecue

697
00:38:34,332 --> 00:38:37,275
was to let you know that I am telling Mike.

698
00:38:37,798 --> 00:38:38,939
The hell you are.

699
00:38:39,329 --> 00:38:40,169
Aah!

700
00:38:40,169 --> 00:38:41,296
Oh, my god!

701
00:38:41,417 --> 00:38:43,770
Gaby! Gaby!

702
00:38:44,246 --> 00:38:46,233
- Trade Manning?
- What, are you out of your mind?

703
00:38:46,234 --> 00:38:49,271
Think for a minute. When is his
stock ever gonna be higher?

704
00:38:49,405 --> 00:38:50,307
Let me go!

705
00:38:52,081 --> 00:38:53,776
You could get a great player.

706
00:38:54,032 --> 00:38:58,064
Yeah, maybe a great quarterback,
like, I don't know. Manning?

707
00:39:00,804 --> 00:39:01,776
- Ow!
- Get off me!

708
00:39:01,777 --> 00:39:04,114
Girls, people can hear us!

709
00:39:04,114 --> 00:39:05,661
Ow! I told you we couldn't trust her!

710
00:39:05,661 --> 00:39:06,622
I can't see.

711
00:39:06,623 --> 00:39:08,564
Lynette! Aah!

712
00:39:08,565 --> 00:39:10,427
Oh! I got it!

713
00:39:14,058 --> 00:39:15,426
What the hell's going on?

714
00:39:17,659 --> 00:39:19,073
Uh, well...

715
00:39:19,433 --> 00:39:23,023
I... lost my earring,
and the girls here were

716
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:25,420
kind enough to help me look for it.

717
00:39:26,098 --> 00:39:27,778
Oh! There it is!

718
00:39:42,894 --> 00:39:44,725
I went food shopping yesterday.

719
00:39:45,463 --> 00:39:47,470
I kept having to put things back.

720
00:39:48,237 --> 00:39:50,508
I'd take a couple of cans of peaches.

721
00:39:52,939 --> 00:39:54,175
And then I'd remember that Tom

722
00:39:54,176 --> 00:39:57,628
was the only one who liked them,
put them back.

723
00:39:58,574 --> 00:40:01,434
Sweet pickles... Tom.

724
00:40:02,503 --> 00:40:04,077
Put them back.

725
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:06,840
I am so sorry.

726
00:40:06,901 --> 00:40:08,149
With everything that's been going on,

727
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:10,000
I haven't been there for you.

728
00:40:14,085 --> 00:40:15,966
I guess we've all been guilty of that.

729
00:40:20,013 --> 00:40:21,566
I'm sorry, Susan.

730
00:40:24,944 --> 00:40:26,795
This is so damn hard.

731
00:40:28,752 --> 00:40:30,184
You know, the good thing

732
00:40:30,185 --> 00:40:35,042
about Mike and Tom not knowing
is they can't be implicated.

733
00:40:36,918 --> 00:40:38,918
If something were to happen,

734
00:40:39,835 --> 00:40:41,255
at least they'd be okay.

735
00:40:49,829 --> 00:40:54,695
We are never gonna be able to
tell anybody about this, are we?

736
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,327
No.

737
00:41:02,317 --> 00:41:04,218
Are you gonna be able to live with that?

738
00:41:12,456 --> 00:41:14,304
I'm gonna try.

739
00:41:24,504 --> 00:41:26,566
It's only the best of friends

740
00:41:26,566 --> 00:41:29,469
who stay long after the party's over

741
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:31,294
to help clean up...

742
00:41:34,271 --> 00:41:38,089
To cleanse the pain of
a guilty conscience...

743
00:41:40,327 --> 00:41:42,421
to pick up the pieces...

744
00:41:42,789 --> 00:41:44,920
of a broken marriage...

745
00:41:46,574 --> 00:41:51,337
To sweep away the loneliness
of keeping a secret.

746
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,350
Yes...

747
00:41:53,567 --> 00:41:57,696
It's good to have friends who
help clean up our messes.

748
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,535
But every housewife knows

749
00:42:02,536 --> 00:42:05,596
that as soon as one mess is taken care of...

750
00:42:06,069 --> 00:42:08,311
another one appears.

751
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:13,794
And we may find ourselves...

752
00:42:14,024 --> 00:42:17,446
right back where we started.
