1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:02,479
<i>Previously on...</i>

2
00:00:03,908 --> 00:00:06,425
<i>Lynette found that dating Tom's boss...</i>

3
00:00:06,485 --> 00:00:08,687
If I asked you to have Tom
work a few nights this week,

4
00:00:08,733 --> 00:00:09,246
you'd do it?

5
00:00:09,246 --> 00:00:10,269
You just say the word.

6
00:00:10,319 --> 00:00:11,837
<i>Had its advantages.</i>

7
00:00:12,026 --> 00:00:15,583
I'm sending Tom to Mumbai for a year.

8
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:18,488
<i>Julie made a big decision about her baby...</i>

9
00:00:18,535 --> 00:00:19,830
I'm gonna keep her.

10
00:00:20,255 --> 00:00:22,749
<i>And the baby's father made a commitment.</i>

11
00:00:22,797 --> 00:00:24,475
I'll get a job.
I'll take... I'll take classes.

12
00:00:24,476 --> 00:00:26,151
I'll do whatever it takes.

13
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:27,821
- <i>Carlos and Gaby argued...</i>
- Carlos.

14
00:00:27,822 --> 00:00:29,113
I am not gonna let Bree

15
00:00:29,114 --> 00:00:30,981
take the fall for a crime I committed.

16
00:00:30,982 --> 00:00:33,364
<i>After Bree was arrested for murder.</i>

17
00:00:33,365 --> 00:00:36,000
This is one of those times where
the best things you can do

18
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:37,066
is do nothing.

19
00:00:37,067 --> 00:00:39,239
<i>But Bree's attorney was confident...</i>

20
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,138
Did you, uh, have some
new thoughts on the case?

21
00:00:41,139 --> 00:00:43,186
Why don't we discuss them over dinner?

22
00:00:43,187 --> 00:00:45,385
<i>As well as convincing.</i>

23
00:00:50,031 --> 00:00:52,413
<i>Since Bree Van de Kamp was arrested,</i>

24
00:00:52,414 --> 00:00:56,498
<i>she had experienced
a wide range of emotions.</i>

25
00:00:58,956 --> 00:01:01,621
<i>One moment, she felt afraid.</i>

26
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:06,249
<i>The next, she was angry.</i>

27
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,141
<i>And through it all, she felt ashamed.</i>

28
00:01:14,103 --> 00:01:16,361
<i>But now that her trial was approaching,</i>

29
00:01:16,362 --> 00:01:18,646
<i>she was beginning to feel...</i>

30
00:01:19,641 --> 00:01:21,450
<i>a little rattled.</i>

31
00:01:23,424 --> 00:01:24,195
Bree, are you okay?

32
00:01:24,196 --> 00:01:27,075
Yeah. Just all this witness preparation

33
00:01:27,076 --> 00:01:28,422
is making me nervous.

34
00:01:28,423 --> 00:01:29,970
Gaby's been in there for ages.

35
00:01:29,971 --> 00:01:31,293
Trip's very thorough.

36
00:01:31,294 --> 00:01:33,565
He just wants to make
sure we're all ready.

37
00:01:35,853 --> 00:01:38,339
- There you are. That took a while.
- No kidding.

38
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,136
I haven't been grilled like that

39
00:01:39,137 --> 00:01:41,476
since Carlos got my last credit card bill.

40
00:01:41,638 --> 00:01:42,824
Well, as alibi witnesses,

41
00:01:42,825 --> 00:01:44,858
you're gonna be asked about
every detail of the night

44
00:01:49,473 --> 00:01:52,672
So... how many dinner guests
were there that night?

45
00:01:52,673 --> 00:01:53,854
14.

46
00:01:54,285 --> 00:01:56,769
- What color dress was Bree wearing?
- Red.

47
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,754
What sauce did she serve with the chicken?

48
00:01:58,755 --> 00:02:00,129
Oh. I got this.

49
00:02:00,953 --> 00:02:01,663
Barbecue?

50
00:02:01,864 --> 00:02:03,864
Gaby, of all the things
I've been accused of,

51
00:02:03,865 --> 00:02:06,225
the idea that I would serve barbecue sauce

52
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:07,174
at a dinner party!

53
00:02:07,175 --> 00:02:08,429
Oh, you're right. I'm sorry.

54
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:11,154
That sounds way worse than
saying you killed Alejandro.

55
00:02:13,995 --> 00:02:16,509
Wait. Uh... Who's Alejandro?

56
00:02:17,088 --> 00:02:18,729
Uh, my gardener.

57
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:22,128
I'm always getting...
my mexicans confused...

58
00:02:22,129 --> 00:02:24,674
which I'm allowed to do,
because I'm mexican.

59
00:02:25,034 --> 00:02:28,501
I gotta run. You, uh,
you gonna be all right?

60
00:02:28,502 --> 00:02:30,053
Of course. With you in my corner,

61
00:02:30,054 --> 00:02:31,336
how can I not be?

62
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,896
Okay. What was that
little prom photo moment

63
00:02:41,897 --> 00:02:42,548
with the hands?

64
00:02:42,549 --> 00:02:44,009
We warned you about this.

65
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,668
You're still going after him, aren't you?

66
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:48,151
Of course not. I am totally
focused on the case,

67
00:02:48,152 --> 00:02:49,478
and so is he.

68
00:02:51,619 --> 00:02:54,161
Okay, fine. What am I supposed to do?

69
00:02:54,162 --> 00:02:57,431
He is the most intelligent,
caring, charming man

70
00:02:57,432 --> 00:02:59,687
I have met in ages.

71
00:02:59,937 --> 00:03:02,330
And by the way, it isn't
exactly a one-way street.

72
00:03:02,331 --> 00:03:05,117
He's been showing quite a bit
of interesting in me, too.

73
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:07,242
- Um, Bree...
- And besides, if I reject him,

74
00:03:07,243 --> 00:03:08,906
he might be too humiliated

75
00:03:08,907 --> 00:03:11,697
- to do a good job on my case.
- Yeah?

76
00:03:11,874 --> 00:03:14,248
Something tells me he's gonna bounce back.

77
00:03:20,402 --> 00:03:23,645
<i>Yes, after Bree Van de Kamp was arrested,</i>

78
00:03:23,646 --> 00:03:26,459
<i>she felt a range of emotions.</i>

79
00:03:29,031 --> 00:03:32,327
<i>But the one thing she
didn't expect to feel...</i>

80
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:35,788
<i>was jealousy.</i>

81
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,266
<i>At the Fairview childbirth center,</i>

82
00:03:50,267 --> 00:03:53,802
<i>there are certain conversations
you expect to hear...</i>

83
00:03:55,237 --> 00:03:58,307
<i>discussions about the magic
of a changing body...</i>

84
00:03:58,308 --> 00:04:00,354
Look at me. I'm a cow.

85
00:04:01,164 --> 00:04:03,442
<i>The beauty of natural childbirth.</i>

86
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:06,640
Just so you know, I'm getting the drugs.

87
00:04:07,152 --> 00:04:10,048
<i>Or the importance of healthy nutrition.</i>

88
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:11,922
Take a chip, lose a hand.

89
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:16,476
<i>But Julie Meyer found herself
having a conversation...</i>

90
00:04:16,477 --> 00:04:19,364
I can't believe Bree's
on trial for murder.

91
00:04:19,365 --> 00:04:23,078
I mean, come on.
Killers don't wear aprons.

92
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:25,945
<i>That was rather unexpected.</i>

93
00:04:26,223 --> 00:04:28,824
I know. It sucks.
You know what else sucks?

94
00:04:28,825 --> 00:04:31,729
Somebody trying to relax you
by talking about a murder.

95
00:04:32,155 --> 00:04:34,202
You're right. I'm sorry.

96
00:04:34,203 --> 00:04:36,838
So what would be a good
thing for you to visualize

97
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:38,531
that might help relax you?

98
00:04:38,552 --> 00:04:41,382
Me punching Porter in
the face for being late.

99
00:04:41,383 --> 00:04:45,113
Okay. Forget visualization.
How about we try

100
00:04:45,114 --> 00:04:46,743
some of that breathing stuff again?

101
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:49,830
Ugh. No. I hate that "Hee-hee-hee."

102
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:50,803
Feels stupid.

103
00:04:50,804 --> 00:04:52,729
I know. But it works.

104
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,705
Relaxes you when you start
to get stressed out.

105
00:04:54,706 --> 00:04:56,958
Okay, nice job, everyone.

106
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,146
We're gonna show the birthing DVD now.

107
00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:04,206
Julie, sorry, sorry, sorry.

108
00:05:04,741 --> 00:05:06,643
I had to clean out
the fryer before I could leave.

109
00:05:06,644 --> 00:05:08,798
No worries. Plus you
smell like french fries.

110
00:05:08,799 --> 00:05:10,306
I love french fries.

111
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,582
It's because you're about to go through...

112
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:14,326
You missed, like, the whole class.

113
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,586
She did great. Let me tell you,
this girl can visualize.

114
00:05:17,587 --> 00:05:19,628
I planned on getting out early,
but a shift opened up,

115
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:21,484
and I had to take it.
What do you want me to say?

116
00:05:21,485 --> 00:05:23,092
I want you to say that you'll be on time

117
00:05:23,093 --> 00:05:25,574
for one thing we do as
we get ready to have this baby.

118
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,033
"Hee-hee-hee-hee."

119
00:05:27,034 --> 00:05:28,955
It's not funny, Mrs. Delfino.

120
00:05:28,956 --> 00:05:31,585
Look. I said I'm sorry.

121
00:05:31,586 --> 00:05:32,742
The point is, I'm here now,

122
00:05:32,743 --> 00:05:35,486
and I'm 100% focused and ready to help.

123
00:05:35,487 --> 00:05:36,731
Just stay calm.

124
00:05:36,732 --> 00:05:37,717
The crowning begins,

125
00:05:37,718 --> 00:05:40,532
and the head of the baby becomes visible.

126
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,963
Hello. This is Bree Van de Kamp.
May I please speak with Trip?

127
00:05:54,757 --> 00:05:56,479
Oh. Was he having lunch alone?

128
00:05:58,931 --> 00:06:02,564
Oh, right. The blonde woman
with the convertible.

129
00:06:02,927 --> 00:06:05,032
I see. Right.

130
00:06:05,314 --> 00:06:06,526
Thank you.

131
00:06:10,194 --> 00:06:11,702
Okay, I know there's been a lot of talk

132
00:06:11,703 --> 00:06:13,396
about what you should wear to the trial,

133
00:06:13,397 --> 00:06:16,622
so I've selected a few outfits
that just scream "Acquittal."

134
00:06:17,368 --> 00:06:18,619
What do you think?

135
00:06:19,275 --> 00:06:20,715
Black and white stripes?

136
00:06:20,716 --> 00:06:23,916
Oh, good point. Don't need to
put an idea in the jury's mind.

137
00:06:24,086 --> 00:06:25,523
How about ruffles? I read somewhere

138
00:06:25,524 --> 00:06:28,154
that no one has ever been
convicted while wearing ruffles.

139
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:29,799
- Well...
- Okay. You're right.

140
00:06:29,947 --> 00:06:32,184
There's always a first time.
To hell with ruffles.

141
00:06:32,548 --> 00:06:33,669
How about this one?

142
00:06:33,907 --> 00:06:36,492
It's lovely, but I am
being accused of sleeping

143
00:06:36,493 --> 00:06:38,427
with a total stranger and killing him.

144
00:06:38,428 --> 00:06:42,726
And red is the color of
blood and whores. Got it.

145
00:06:43,334 --> 00:06:45,266
Don't worry. We'll find something else.

146
00:06:49,593 --> 00:06:50,863
Bree, something wrong?

147
00:06:51,465 --> 00:06:54,707
Apart from me standing trial
for murder in three days, no.

148
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,003
Life is good.

149
00:06:56,293 --> 00:06:58,484
Relax. It's gonna be okay.

150
00:06:59,061 --> 00:07:01,598
And remember, you're actually innocent.

151
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,141
Juries can sense things like that.

152
00:07:03,142 --> 00:07:05,158
- I hope you're right.
- Of course I am.

153
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:06,478
And Trip's a brilliant lawyer.

154
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:07,865
He's gonna get you off in no time.

155
00:07:07,866 --> 00:07:11,319
I'm just worried that he's been
a little distracted lately.

156
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,954
He seems fine to me.

157
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,851
I have some other dresses in the back.

158
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:16,556
Let me bring 'em out for you.

159
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:20,642
It's gonna turn out fine, Bree.

160
00:07:20,643 --> 00:07:22,809
Honestly, I'm not worried at all.

161
00:07:29,587 --> 00:07:30,536
India?

162
00:07:30,537 --> 00:07:32,533
Not India. He said he's going to Mumbai.

163
00:07:32,534 --> 00:07:34,563
That's in India, you idiot.

164
00:07:34,564 --> 00:07:37,083
- How long are you gonna be gone?
- A year.

165
00:07:37,084 --> 00:07:39,995
What? Dad, you're gonna miss
my eighth grade graduation.

166
00:07:39,996 --> 00:07:42,457
It won't be so bad.
We can send him pictures.

167
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:43,526
We can skype.

168
00:07:43,527 --> 00:07:45,702
So he's supposed to teach me
to drive over the computer?

169
00:07:45,703 --> 00:07:47,222
And he's gonna miss the birth of my baby.

170
00:07:47,223 --> 00:07:50,194
I am sorry, guys.
Look, I talked to my boss.

171
00:07:50,195 --> 00:07:53,247
He's not changing his mind.
There's nothing I can do.

172
00:07:53,248 --> 00:07:55,540
Besides, it's... it's just for a year.

173
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:56,946
It'll go by like that.

174
00:07:56,947 --> 00:07:58,177
Daddy, no!

175
00:07:58,792 --> 00:08:00,238
I don't want you to go.

176
00:08:00,437 --> 00:08:02,237
I know. I love you so much, baby.

177
00:08:06,788 --> 00:08:08,851
Guys, could I have
a minute alone with your dad?

178
00:08:08,852 --> 00:08:09,958
Yeah, sure.

179
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:12,424
Guys, it's gonna be okay.

180
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:14,638
We're gonna get through this!

181
00:08:15,521 --> 00:08:17,345
I don't know how we're
gonna get through this.

182
00:08:19,557 --> 00:08:21,472
So how did Jane take the news?

183
00:08:21,475 --> 00:08:23,718
Um, timing could've been better.

184
00:08:23,852 --> 00:08:26,450
We're not exactly in
a good place right now.

185
00:08:28,866 --> 00:08:31,583
Well, maybe some time
apart will do you good.

186
00:08:32,775 --> 00:08:34,127
Hmm. Maybe.

187
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:37,186
It's gonna be...

188
00:08:37,709 --> 00:08:40,723
really weird being so far away.

189
00:08:40,724 --> 00:08:44,136
I know. It's gonna be so hard on the kids.

190
00:08:45,213 --> 00:08:47,732
Actually, I was talking about you.

191
00:08:50,517 --> 00:08:52,012
I don't think we've ever been apart

192
00:08:52,013 --> 00:08:53,658
for more than a month.

193
00:08:54,557 --> 00:08:56,124
Who's gonna tell me what to do?

194
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,590
What to think?

195
00:08:58,415 --> 00:09:00,890
Whether your shoes are on the right feet.

196
00:09:01,914 --> 00:09:03,306
Exactly.

197
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,029
I'm really gonna miss you.

198
00:09:11,554 --> 00:09:12,760
I'm...

199
00:09:16,286 --> 00:09:18,239
so sorry.

200
00:09:18,327 --> 00:09:19,520
Why?

201
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:22,176
There's nothing you can do about it.

202
00:09:45,687 --> 00:09:46,780
Hello.

203
00:09:49,007 --> 00:09:50,536
Are you looking for Trip?

204
00:09:50,537 --> 00:09:53,928
Yes. Well, he's meeting
with the judge on my case.

205
00:09:53,929 --> 00:09:55,455
I'll wait for him.

206
00:10:02,662 --> 00:10:05,603
So how exactly do you know Trip?

207
00:10:05,604 --> 00:10:09,664
He... hires me from time to time.

208
00:10:10,172 --> 00:10:12,344
And what is the nature of your work?

209
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:14,207
I really can't say.

210
00:10:14,641 --> 00:10:16,702
Discretion's an important part of my job.

211
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:19,949
Oh. I see. Well, part of your discretion

212
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,878
is falling out of your blouse.

213
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:25,433
Excuse me? Look, this is
Mr. Weston's place of business.

214
00:10:25,434 --> 00:10:27,653
Maybe you should meet him
in your place of business...

215
00:10:27,654 --> 00:10:31,203
perhaps a seedy motel
room or a street corner.

216
00:10:31,204 --> 00:10:33,204
Are you calling me a hooker?

217
00:10:33,565 --> 00:10:36,505
Well, if the push-up bra fits,
or in your case, doesn't...

218
00:10:36,506 --> 00:10:38,490
That's it. Screw you, lady.

219
00:10:38,491 --> 00:10:40,225
Tell Trip I'm off his case.

220
00:10:42,436 --> 00:10:44,028
Lindsay. Lindsay.

221
00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:46,428
- Trip?
- What the hell?

222
00:10:46,429 --> 00:10:49,592
Uh, she wanted me to tell
you that she's off the case.

223
00:10:49,944 --> 00:10:51,347
What was she doing on the case?

224
00:10:51,348 --> 00:10:53,200
She's a private investigator

225
00:10:53,563 --> 00:10:56,119
who was working on
a really big lead for us.

226
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,911
Wh-why did she quit?

227
00:10:58,998 --> 00:11:00,082
No idea.

228
00:11:02,311 --> 00:11:03,204
I'd better go talk to her.

229
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:06,762
No! I mean, you know how careful
you have to be with some women.

230
00:11:06,763 --> 00:11:09,737
They can misinterpret the littlest things.

231
00:11:11,058 --> 00:11:12,328
I'll talk to her.

232
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:18,940
So what do you think, maid of honor?

233
00:11:20,042 --> 00:11:21,131
Nice.

234
00:11:22,104 --> 00:11:24,966
You do realize you're gonna
have to wear this... in public?

235
00:11:24,967 --> 00:11:26,145
You got a problem with it?

236
00:11:26,146 --> 00:11:31,109
No. It's just... the purple
is such a... bold choice.

237
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:33,792
Aren't you afraid it's gonna
pull focus from the bride?

238
00:11:34,153 --> 00:11:36,159
And the sky and the earth?

239
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,844
Lee, look at my wedding dress.

240
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:41,753
All of this wearing all of that...

241
00:11:41,873 --> 00:11:44,341
Santa Claus in a thong riding a unicorn

242
00:11:44,342 --> 00:11:46,358
would not be able to pull focus from me.

243
00:11:47,504 --> 00:11:48,965
Lynette, you okay? You seem a little...

244
00:11:48,966 --> 00:11:49,844
distracted.

245
00:11:49,845 --> 00:11:51,598
I think she's still in shock.

246
00:11:52,073 --> 00:11:55,899
No, it's just...
this whole thing with Tom.

247
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,351
Oh, Lynette, it's gonna be fine.

248
00:11:57,352 --> 00:12:00,388
My dad traveled all the time.
My siblings and I adjusted.

249
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:03,860
Yeah, but he said he was gonna miss me.

250
00:12:03,914 --> 00:12:06,870
Really? Suddenly I'm interested.
That's great.

251
00:12:06,871 --> 00:12:09,418
And it was the way he said it,
too, like...

252
00:12:09,705 --> 00:12:12,003
he'd been kind of missing me already.

253
00:12:13,407 --> 00:12:14,972
Well, what are you gonna do?

254
00:12:14,973 --> 00:12:16,153
I don't know.

255
00:12:16,373 --> 00:12:18,727
There's no way I can let him
get on that plane to Mumbai.

256
00:12:18,728 --> 00:12:21,804
Or eat these
if you're going to fit in that dress.

257
00:12:26,444 --> 00:12:27,951
Lindsay! Hi.

258
00:12:27,952 --> 00:12:31,242
I think we got off on
the wrong foot earlier.

259
00:12:31,243 --> 00:12:33,500
- Keep walking.
- I suppose I deserve that,

260
00:12:33,501 --> 00:12:34,305
but if I could just have a...

261
00:12:34,306 --> 00:12:37,949
I'm on surveillance! Stay down.

262
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:40,644
Ooh, how exciting.
What are we surveilling?

263
00:12:41,557 --> 00:12:44,893
well, nothing now.

264
00:12:45,382 --> 00:12:47,368
I've been waiting six weeks
for that cheating bastard

265
00:12:47,369 --> 00:12:48,434
to leave his curtains open.

266
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:49,685
I'm sorry.

267
00:12:51,447 --> 00:12:52,622
Trip told me where to find you,

268
00:12:52,623 --> 00:12:56,794
because I wanted to apologize
for my unkind words.

269
00:12:56,795 --> 00:12:59,639
You were merely doing your job,
and I was very rude.

270
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,673
Well, you were more than rude.

271
00:13:01,674 --> 00:13:03,704
Yes, I was also off-color.

272
00:13:03,705 --> 00:13:06,543
I never should have...
implied you're a hooker

273
00:13:06,544 --> 00:13:08,631
or insulted your bosoms.

274
00:13:08,632 --> 00:13:09,410
They're lovely.

275
00:13:09,411 --> 00:13:10,416
No.

276
00:13:10,417 --> 00:13:14,506
Not that. You like him.

277
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:16,548
You thought I was sleeping with him,

278
00:13:16,549 --> 00:13:17,550
and you got jealous.

279
00:13:17,551 --> 00:13:19,970
I'm not jealous of you and Trip.

280
00:13:20,497 --> 00:13:21,573
Is there a "You and Trip"?

281
00:13:21,574 --> 00:13:24,120
Oh, god, no. He's, like, 100.

282
00:13:24,996 --> 00:13:26,598
Look, I'll come back to your case,

283
00:13:26,599 --> 00:13:29,192
and I'll give you a free
pass on the crazy jealousy.

284
00:13:29,424 --> 00:13:30,955
It's not all your fault.

285
00:13:32,972 --> 00:13:34,580
- What do you mean?
- Trip's a good lawyer.

286
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:35,691
He listens carefully.

287
00:13:35,692 --> 00:13:37,519
He tells you he'll protect you.

288
00:13:37,554 --> 00:13:39,937
Female clients are always
getting the wrong idea.

289
00:13:42,752 --> 00:13:44,801
Well, that might be
the way it normally goes,

290
00:13:44,802 --> 00:13:46,908
but I happen to believe
there really is something

291
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,725
between Trip and me.

292
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:52,155
Sorry, but I know him.
He's all about the job.

293
00:13:52,156 --> 00:13:54,724
He's into your case, not you.

294
00:13:58,885 --> 00:14:01,639
Porter is going to be fine. Trust me.

295
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,521
Oh, sure. He'll just wear a helmet

296
00:14:03,522 --> 00:14:04,748
so he doesn't crack his head open

297
00:14:04,749 --> 00:14:06,788
when his head hits
the delivery room floor.

298
00:14:06,789 --> 00:14:08,785
Baby, I'm telling you,

299
00:14:09,575 --> 00:14:12,904
when the man gets in there with you,
it just clicks.

300
00:14:12,905 --> 00:14:16,192
They see the blood and stuff,

301
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,961
and it starts to seem
like a video game to them.

302
00:14:20,889 --> 00:14:23,155
I'm getting a bad feeling about this.

303
00:14:25,257 --> 00:14:26,529
Okay, you know what?

304
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:31,316
Mike almost passed out
when he saw that video.

305
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:34,683
And he was a little shaky
in the delivery room, too.

306
00:14:34,855 --> 00:14:36,802
But once M.J. was born,

307
00:14:37,931 --> 00:14:39,845
he was my rock.

308
00:14:43,123 --> 00:14:46,512
M.J. took his first step right there.

309
00:14:47,697 --> 00:14:49,169
We were so excited.

310
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:52,283
Then he took his second step right there.

311
00:14:53,257 --> 00:14:55,008
Fell right on his face.

312
00:14:55,534 --> 00:14:58,375
He was... bleeding and...

313
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,792
I was a mess.

314
00:15:01,622 --> 00:15:04,659
And Mike knew exactly what to do.

315
00:15:07,204 --> 00:15:08,652
He always did.

316
00:15:08,753 --> 00:15:10,780
Oh, mom.

317
00:15:15,152 --> 00:15:17,214
I'm okay.

318
00:15:19,183 --> 00:15:22,568
Just so many memories of him here.

319
00:15:25,737 --> 00:15:27,334
Anyway...

320
00:15:27,658 --> 00:15:30,760
the point is...

321
00:15:31,228 --> 00:15:35,507
you shouldn't worry about Porter.

322
00:15:35,572 --> 00:15:37,293
I just...

323
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:41,381
I think that he's not into this anymore.

324
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,620
That he's losing interest in being a dad.

325
00:15:44,669 --> 00:15:46,653
He was late for class because of work.

326
00:15:46,693 --> 00:15:47,842
You gotta cut him some slack.

327
00:15:47,862 --> 00:15:49,265
It's not just that.

328
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:51,503
He's missed some doctor's appointments,

329
00:15:51,528 --> 00:15:55,760
and he missed the tour of
the birthing room at the hospital.

330
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:57,241
We had a deal.

331
00:15:57,272 --> 00:16:01,101
He was supposed to help raise
the baby so that I could finish school.

332
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:03,751
But now I'm afraid that

333
00:16:03,787 --> 00:16:06,189
it's all falling apart.

334
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:19,749
That was delicious.

335
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:21,467
I'm glad you liked it.

336
00:16:21,997 --> 00:16:23,520
More wine?

337
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,356
Lynette, it's our third date.

338
00:16:25,408 --> 00:16:27,593
I'm pretty much a sure thing.

339
00:16:29,353 --> 00:16:31,157
Something wrong?
You're acting a little weird.

340
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:32,694
Yeah, there's...

341
00:16:32,718 --> 00:16:34,915
I have a little favor to ask you.

342
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:40,288
Please, don't send Tom to Mumbai.

343
00:16:41,123 --> 00:16:43,700
You have a very odd sense of foreplay.

344
00:16:43,755 --> 00:16:45,348
I know. It's just...

345
00:16:45,429 --> 00:16:47,955
the kids are upset, and Tom is a wreck,

346
00:16:47,995 --> 00:16:50,397
and I don't think I can
go through with it.

347
00:16:51,496 --> 00:16:53,183
Okay.

348
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:53,875
Really?

349
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,683
Yeah. I didn't want him to go.
I was just doing it for you.

350
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:58,286
I'll send McGuinness instead.

351
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,442
That son of a bitch had the nerve

352
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:01,421
to beat me in tennis last week.

353
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,162
Oh. Thank you.

354
00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:07,786
I am so grateful.

355
00:17:08,385 --> 00:17:09,689
Well...

356
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:11,267
I can think of one way

357
00:17:11,303 --> 00:17:13,192
that you can show your gratitude.

358
00:17:13,267 --> 00:17:14,573
- Mm.
- Whoa.

359
00:17:14,648 --> 00:17:17,647
Um, maybe you're the one who
needs another glass of wine.

360
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:19,764
Gregg. No.

361
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,815
Okay, what's going on?

362
00:17:20,868 --> 00:17:24,881
I just... I'm not ready for that step,

363
00:17:24,927 --> 00:17:26,659
and I don't know that I ever will be.

364
00:17:26,694 --> 00:17:27,633
Ever?

365
00:17:27,657 --> 00:17:31,311
I'm sorry. There's... someone else.

366
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:33,572
You just realized that?

367
00:17:33,607 --> 00:17:38,194
No. No, I just realized how
much I want it to work.

368
00:17:38,707 --> 00:17:39,770
So let me get this straight.

369
00:17:39,805 --> 00:17:41,715
You use me to get back at your ex,

370
00:17:41,771 --> 00:17:43,595
and now you're dumping
me for some other guy?

371
00:17:43,616 --> 00:17:45,698
That's unbelievable!

372
00:17:45,959 --> 00:17:48,018
Unbelievable.

373
00:18:08,819 --> 00:18:09,947
And in local news,

374
00:18:10,001 --> 00:18:13,506
the trial of Bree Van de Kamp
is set to begin tomorrow.

375
00:18:13,542 --> 00:18:16,645
Van de kamp is accused
of killing Ramon Sanchez,

376
00:18:16,705 --> 00:18:17,908
whose body was discovered

377
00:18:17,948 --> 00:18:21,512
beneath a condominium
development in Chapman woods.

378
00:18:24,387 --> 00:18:26,515
Hey. Couldn't sleep?

379
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,193
Hey. No.

380
00:18:28,332 --> 00:18:28,952
Huh.

381
00:18:29,495 --> 00:18:31,411
Thought I'd take a walk.

382
00:18:33,464 --> 00:18:36,464
Remember the last time
we were up this late together?

383
00:18:37,629 --> 00:18:39,781
The night we buried Alejandro.

384
00:18:40,777 --> 00:18:43,184
God, if we could only go back.

385
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,392
Hey.

386
00:18:47,441 --> 00:18:49,186
You having trouble sleeping, too?

387
00:18:49,267 --> 00:18:50,785
No, I woke up to get some water,

388
00:18:50,815 --> 00:18:52,021
and I saw you from the window.

389
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:53,482
What are you guys doing up?

390
00:18:54,057 --> 00:18:55,240
We can't sleep because our friend

391
00:18:55,297 --> 00:18:57,892
is going on trial tomorrow
morning for murder.

392
00:18:57,927 --> 00:19:00,929
Oh, relax. Bree's innocent.
The jury's gonna see that.

393
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:03,025
Juries make mistakes.

394
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:04,459
Well, you know, it doesn't help Bree

395
00:19:04,509 --> 00:19:05,988
for us to be negative right now.

396
00:19:06,295 --> 00:19:08,931
Do you know what I was thinking
we should do to help her?

397
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:12,199
Go to the judge and tell her the truth.

398
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,085
I was thinking the exact same thing.

399
00:19:14,136 --> 00:19:16,173
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.
What's going on here?

400
00:19:16,534 --> 00:19:18,897
What, it never even crossed your mind?

401
00:19:18,984 --> 00:19:20,532
Well, we have a plan in place,

402
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:22,842
and if we just hold on a little longer,

403
00:19:22,907 --> 00:19:24,315
everything will be back to normal.

404
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:26,122
And what if Bree is convicted, huh?

405
00:19:26,157 --> 00:19:27,730
What are we gonna do then?

406
00:19:27,811 --> 00:19:28,792
I don't know.

407
00:19:28,828 --> 00:19:30,331
Clearly. Do you even care?

408
00:19:30,407 --> 00:19:31,042
Lynette!

409
00:19:31,092 --> 00:19:34,000
Okay. It's late.

410
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:37,742
Well, let's just talk about it tomorrow.

411
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:43,247
Well, I don't get this.
Why are you guys mad at me?

412
00:19:43,755 --> 00:19:46,189
Because you're not having
any trouble sleeping.

413
00:19:57,866 --> 00:20:00,993
Don't freak out. It's just me.

414
00:20:04,506 --> 00:20:05,717
Trip, what are you doing here?

415
00:20:05,786 --> 00:20:07,106
It's the middle of the night.

416
00:20:07,162 --> 00:20:09,146
I had a feeling you might be up.

417
00:20:14,661 --> 00:20:16,040
Do we need to discuss my case?

418
00:20:16,219 --> 00:20:18,318
Nope. Just the opposite.

419
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:21,043
Doughnuts... "Casablanca."

420
00:20:21,068 --> 00:20:22,681
That's one of my favorite movies.

421
00:20:22,732 --> 00:20:24,208
- Yours, too?
- Never seen it.

422
00:20:24,262 --> 00:20:28,772
I'm, uh, more a "Caddyshack" kind of guy.

423
00:20:29,511 --> 00:20:31,524
But I had a feeling about you.

424
00:20:31,595 --> 00:20:33,215
- May I?
- Sure.

425
00:20:35,787 --> 00:20:37,466
My trial starts in six hours.

426
00:20:37,673 --> 00:20:39,861
Is this really what we should be doing?

427
00:20:40,454 --> 00:20:42,264
Do you know anything about sports?

428
00:20:42,378 --> 00:20:43,775
No more than I have to.

429
00:20:43,805 --> 00:20:46,132
This is just like going
to the championships.

430
00:20:46,197 --> 00:20:47,588
You practice your ass off to get there,

431
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:49,560
but the night before the big game,

432
00:20:50,297 --> 00:20:51,854
you just forget about it.

433
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:54,644
I can't believe I'm going through this.

434
00:20:54,846 --> 00:20:57,361
But if I have to...

435
00:20:57,447 --> 00:20:59,124
I guess what I'm saying is,

436
00:20:59,184 --> 00:21:03,029
of all the gin joints in all
the towns in all the world,

437
00:21:03,093 --> 00:21:05,598
I'm glad you walked into mine.

438
00:21:05,736 --> 00:21:07,903
Am I supposed to know what that means?

439
00:21:07,993 --> 00:21:09,998
Start the movie.

440
00:21:13,811 --> 00:21:15,007
Thank you.

441
00:21:33,481 --> 00:21:36,796
In the matter of people vs.
Bree Van de Kamp,

442
00:21:36,857 --> 00:21:39,175
we are here for opening statements.

443
00:21:39,225 --> 00:21:41,352
Ms. Stone, you may proceed.

444
00:21:45,351 --> 00:21:48,088
How well do we really know
our friends and neighbors?

445
00:21:48,143 --> 00:21:51,825
They borrow our lawn mowers,
sit with us in P.T.A. meetings,

446
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:54,083
Bring us tuna casseroles.

447
00:21:54,288 --> 00:21:56,117
But as this case will demonstrate,

448
00:21:56,167 --> 00:21:58,188
they also have secrets...

449
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:01,317
Secrets they keep from their neighbors,

450
00:22:01,513 --> 00:22:05,464
secrets that can poison
a place like Wisteria Lane.

451
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:09,695
Ms. Stone wonders how well
we know our neighbors.

452
00:22:09,776 --> 00:22:11,837
Well, in this case, as it turns out,

453
00:22:11,939 --> 00:22:13,762
pretty darn well.

454
00:22:13,877 --> 00:22:15,607
Breen Van de Kamp's friends will tell you

455
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:20,445
that she is a woman of honesty,
integrity, and compassion.

456
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:23,028
Bree Van de Kamp is an alcoholic,

457
00:22:23,088 --> 00:22:25,831
a woman of loose morals.

458
00:22:26,082 --> 00:22:28,798
She would pick up strange men in bars,

459
00:22:28,858 --> 00:22:30,152
have sex with them,

460
00:22:30,213 --> 00:22:34,313
frequently waking up with
no recollection of what happened.

461
00:22:34,468 --> 00:22:37,867
If picking up people in bars is a crime,

462
00:22:38,047 --> 00:22:42,249
there might be a criminal or
two in this very courtroom.

463
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:46,183
The defendant lured Ramon
Sanchez into her house,

464
00:22:46,287 --> 00:22:48,289
seduced him, and bludgeoned him.

465
00:22:48,354 --> 00:22:50,858
There is no connection whatsoever

466
00:22:50,898 --> 00:22:53,395
between my client and Mr. Sanchez.

467
00:22:53,426 --> 00:22:55,831
And while it isn't against
the law to sleep with any man

468
00:22:55,867 --> 00:22:59,535
who'd buy you a martini,
it is illegal to kill them.

469
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:02,858
Has Bree made some
questionable choices? Yes.

470
00:23:02,937 --> 00:23:04,692
Does that make her a killer?

471
00:23:05,257 --> 00:23:06,756
No.

472
00:23:07,033 --> 00:23:11,029
It makes her human... like the rest of us.

473
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:14,712
This is a case about a woman
who led a secret life,

474
00:23:15,216 --> 00:23:17,569
but here's the thing about secrets.

475
00:23:17,761 --> 00:23:21,399
Like bodies, they don't
always stay buried.

476
00:23:26,095 --> 00:23:27,551
Welcome to big top burger.

477
00:23:27,611 --> 00:23:29,227
Hi. I'm looking for Porter Scavo.

478
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:30,152
Is he done yet?

479
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:32,183
No, Porter's working the drive-thru.

480
00:23:34,908 --> 00:23:37,882
Oh. I thought he was
only working till 1:00.

481
00:23:37,932 --> 00:23:39,690
Well, I heard him say
he'd cover the afternoon shift,

482
00:23:39,728 --> 00:23:41,231
so that's till 6:00.

483
00:23:41,307 --> 00:23:43,459
Now can I get you something to eat?

484
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:46,522
No, I think I'll get something to go.

485
00:23:49,241 --> 00:23:51,723
Welcome to big top burger. Can I help you?

486
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:52,959
I've got a better idea.

487
00:23:53,035 --> 00:23:55,200
How about you help
the mother of your child?

488
00:23:55,669 --> 00:23:57,086
Mrs. Delfino?

489
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:59,108
Dear god. Is there another person

490
00:23:59,164 --> 00:24:00,640
who could say what I just said to you?

491
00:24:00,735 --> 00:24:02,117
No, of course not.

492
00:24:02,221 --> 00:24:03,879
Porter, why are you making julie

493
00:24:03,931 --> 00:24:05,784
do all of this stuff without you?

494
00:24:05,972 --> 00:24:08,567
I'm busting my butt trying to
make money for her and the baby.

495
00:24:08,668 --> 00:24:10,034
I'm working three jobs.

496
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:11,564
Well, then tell her that.

497
00:24:11,751 --> 00:24:15,781
She's worried that
you're losing interest in being a dad.

498
00:24:16,411 --> 00:24:19,055
I'm talking to the clown! Shut up!

499
00:24:19,144 --> 00:24:21,265
Can you please pull up to the window?

500
00:24:26,968 --> 00:24:28,624
Look, Mrs. Delfino,

501
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:31,113
I barely graduated high school,

502
00:24:31,177 --> 00:24:33,660
I ditched college,
and this is about as much

503
00:24:33,729 --> 00:24:36,014
as my baby's daddy is gonna achieve.

504
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:38,569
You can always go back to college.

505
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:39,390
When?

506
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,677
Everybody says how expensive
it is to have a kid.

507
00:24:41,733 --> 00:24:44,896
With the crap money I make,
I'll be working all the time.

508
00:24:44,975 --> 00:24:46,402
Look, I get it.

509
00:24:46,747 --> 00:24:50,316
It's just not right for Julie
to do this without you.

510
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:53,183
I totally agree. Julie's given up so much

511
00:24:53,314 --> 00:24:55,742
so I can be in this kid's life.

512
00:24:55,955 --> 00:25:00,730
But I'm starting to realize...
that was a bad trade for her.

513
00:25:06,725 --> 00:25:08,737
Look at her, a regular black widow.

514
00:25:08,801 --> 00:25:11,819
It says here she slept with
15 guys in a 2-month period.

515
00:25:11,884 --> 00:25:13,540
And she was drunk the whole time.

516
00:25:13,634 --> 00:25:15,191
Sounds like college.

517
00:25:16,428 --> 00:25:18,587
Excuse me. But you don't know
what you're talking about.

518
00:25:18,651 --> 00:25:20,107
Do you even know this woman?

519
00:25:20,253 --> 00:25:22,525
Actually, a friend of mine
used her to cater a party once.

520
00:25:22,616 --> 00:25:23,980
Said she had shifty eyes.

521
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:25,615
They do look pretty shifty.

522
00:25:25,781 --> 00:25:28,366
W-well, I do know her, and she's innocent.

523
00:25:28,592 --> 00:25:29,734
Yeah, I don't think the police go around

524
00:25:29,849 --> 00:25:31,167
arresting innocent people.

525
00:25:31,315 --> 00:25:33,132
She must have done something.

526
00:25:33,254 --> 00:25:35,113
Oh, so you guys read one article,

527
00:25:35,194 --> 00:25:36,623
and just like that, she's guilty?

528
00:25:36,739 --> 00:25:39,064
It's not just us.
Everyone says she killed the guy.

529
00:25:39,232 --> 00:25:42,325
She's the last person in this
world who would kill somebody.

530
00:25:42,449 --> 00:25:44,303
She's a friend and a mother

531
00:25:44,452 --> 00:25:46,881
and probably the most
decent person I know.

532
00:25:47,282 --> 00:25:48,371
And she would die if she knew

533
00:25:48,542 --> 00:25:50,496
how people are talking about her.

534
00:25:50,665 --> 00:25:52,219
Well, she better get used to it.

535
00:25:52,405 --> 00:25:57,282
If I'm a juror, she's going
away for a long, long time.

536
00:26:01,749 --> 00:26:03,912
And with every exhale,

537
00:26:04,065 --> 00:26:06,752
the tension is being blown out,

538
00:26:06,979 --> 00:26:11,358
and every inhale brings
in positive energy.

539
00:26:12,211 --> 00:26:13,952
Now you're imagining

540
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:16,467
a peaceful scene...

541
00:26:17,081 --> 00:26:20,654
that beautiful lawn by
the science building

542
00:26:20,751 --> 00:26:22,399
at your college.

543
00:26:22,531 --> 00:26:25,996
And you're walking
towards the chemistry lab

544
00:26:26,177 --> 00:26:29,497
to finish the research
for your dissertation.

545
00:26:29,641 --> 00:26:34,242
And now on that same lawn,
a graduation ceremony

546
00:26:34,339 --> 00:26:40,027
in which you are finally
receiving your PhD.

547
00:26:40,317 --> 00:26:42,070
Mom, what are you doing?

548
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:45,546
The other day, you were
talking about a murder trial,

549
00:26:45,641 --> 00:26:48,322
and now you're talking about
stuff that will never happen.

550
00:26:49,072 --> 00:26:50,926
I think it will.

551
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:52,609
How?

552
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,449
Because I am going to move
back up there with you

553
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:57,264
and help raise the baby.

554
00:26:58,095 --> 00:26:58,731
What?

555
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,583
I'm gonna sell this house, and M.J. and I

556
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:05,872
are going with you so you
can finish your degree.

557
00:27:06,037 --> 00:27:08,544
But... what about Porter?

558
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,086
Well, there will always be a place for him

559
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:12,712
in his child's life,

560
00:27:13,527 --> 00:27:18,460
but Porter needs to find
his own life right now.

561
00:27:19,034 --> 00:27:22,456
No. I can't let you do this.
You love the lane.

562
00:27:22,556 --> 00:27:26,631
Oh, I do, but nowhere near
as much as I love you.

563
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:30,187
And besides...

564
00:27:30,948 --> 00:27:33,353
I think it'll be good for me, too.

565
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:34,413
What do you mean?

566
00:27:34,442 --> 00:27:36,835
Well, I told you, honey.
There are memories here

567
00:27:36,911 --> 00:27:40,284
that are just too hard
to live with every day.

568
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,844
Mom...

569
00:27:48,065 --> 00:27:49,829
this would be awesome.

570
00:27:50,931 --> 00:27:54,399
But... are you sure you wanna do this?

571
00:27:56,308 --> 00:27:57,895
I'm sure.

572
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:04,024
Okay. Lay back down.

573
00:28:04,921 --> 00:28:07,053
As Mike used to say,

574
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:09,576
we gotta practice birthing a baby.

575
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:18,427
You are gonna love it there, McGuinness.

576
00:28:18,542 --> 00:28:21,723
And hey, if you don't, it's only a year.

577
00:28:22,381 --> 00:28:25,515
I'll give you my "India
on 50 rupees a day" book.

578
00:28:26,361 --> 00:28:28,271
All right, people, let's get started.

579
00:28:28,981 --> 00:28:32,802
Thanks again. I am so
glad to be staying here.

580
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:36,290
Yeah, well, thank your ex-wife.
She's the one who convinced me.

581
00:28:36,877 --> 00:28:39,734
Really? Lynette did that?

582
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,812
Yeah. Real piece of work, that one.

583
00:28:41,891 --> 00:28:43,883
I don't know how you put up with it.

584
00:28:45,195 --> 00:28:49,200
I'm sorry. Um... aren't you guys dating?

585
00:28:49,411 --> 00:28:50,883
No. She dumped me.

586
00:28:50,989 --> 00:28:53,529
Apparently, she's hung
up on some other guy.

587
00:28:55,036 --> 00:28:56,550
I'm surprised you didn't
wanna go to Mumbai

588
00:28:56,622 --> 00:28:59,057
just to get away from her crap.

589
00:29:01,135 --> 00:29:04,165
I know. She can be, uh,
a bit of a handful.

590
00:29:04,296 --> 00:29:05,595
Oh, yeah, that's why you dumped her,

591
00:29:05,682 --> 00:29:07,304
'cause she's a "Handful."

592
00:29:08,903 --> 00:29:09,593
I'm telling you, guys,

593
00:29:09,675 --> 00:29:11,873
23 years living with that psycho...

594
00:29:11,953 --> 00:29:15,406
He's either a saint or a masochist.

595
00:29:16,438 --> 00:29:19,617
Okay. Okay. Let's...
let's start the meeting.

596
00:29:19,689 --> 00:29:22,082
Oh, seriously. I barely survived one week

597
00:29:22,137 --> 00:29:23,138
with that ball-buster.

598
00:29:23,229 --> 00:29:25,402
Gregg, I'm asking you, drop it.

599
00:29:25,481 --> 00:29:28,969
I'm just saying Lynette
is a first class bitch.

600
00:29:29,593 --> 00:29:31,278
Uhh! Oh.

601
00:29:34,166 --> 00:29:36,139
Well, I hope that was worth it,

602
00:29:36,334 --> 00:29:37,794
'cause you're fired.

603
00:29:53,395 --> 00:29:55,611
Okay, Mr. Weston,

604
00:29:55,703 --> 00:29:57,985
is the defense ready to
call its first witness?

605
00:29:58,112 --> 00:30:01,295
We are, your honor.
The defense calls Susan Delfino.

606
00:30:04,371 --> 00:30:06,081
How long have you known my client?

607
00:30:06,327 --> 00:30:07,505
Nearly 20 years.

608
00:30:07,506 --> 00:30:09,841
So it's fair to say you
know each other well?

609
00:30:09,842 --> 00:30:10,819
We're like sisters.

610
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:13,057
She's the most honest
person I've ever met.

611
00:30:13,382 --> 00:30:15,857
Can you tell us what happened
on the night in question?

612
00:30:16,165 --> 00:30:18,049
It was a progressive dinner party.

613
00:30:18,139 --> 00:30:20,708
I'm sorry. I don't get out much.

614
00:30:20,709 --> 00:30:22,788
What is a progressive dinner party?

615
00:30:22,789 --> 00:30:24,000
The whole street throws it.

616
00:30:24,001 --> 00:30:26,477
Every house is responsible
for a specific course.

617
00:30:26,478 --> 00:30:29,001
- Oh, sounds like fun.
- Unless you don't know how to cook.

618
00:30:29,002 --> 00:30:31,017
They skipped my house that night.

619
00:30:31,018 --> 00:30:33,541
Now as you traveled from house to house,

620
00:30:33,658 --> 00:30:35,572
were you with Bree the whole time?

621
00:30:36,058 --> 00:30:37,045
No.

622
00:30:37,145 --> 00:30:38,214
Really?

623
00:30:38,328 --> 00:30:39,622
Where did she go?

624
00:30:39,977 --> 00:30:42,853
She left my house to
go check on her entree.

625
00:30:43,306 --> 00:30:45,704
Wouldn't that have given her
time to kill Mr. Sanchez?

626
00:30:45,705 --> 00:30:48,175
Or have sex with her boyfriend
while the chicken burned,

627
00:30:48,176 --> 00:30:50,410
which is what she was doing
when the whole neighborhood

628
00:30:50,411 --> 00:30:51,641
walked in on her.

629
00:30:51,642 --> 00:30:53,924
I imagine that must have been awkward.

630
00:30:53,946 --> 00:30:56,261
Clearly, you haven't spent
much time on my street.

631
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:58,230
And then what happened?

632
00:30:58,986 --> 00:31:00,665
The party finished at my house,

633
00:31:00,666 --> 00:31:02,712
and then Susan, Lynette,
and Bree stayed late

634
00:31:02,713 --> 00:31:03,836
to help me clean up.

635
00:31:03,837 --> 00:31:05,636
- How late?
- Around 2:00 in the morning.

636
00:31:05,637 --> 00:31:07,852
And the coroner's report
said that the time of death

637
00:31:07,853 --> 00:31:11,896
was between 10:00 P.M.
and midnight. Interesting.

638
00:31:13,422 --> 00:31:15,289
So there's no possible way

639
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:18,352
that Bree could have killed
Ramon Sanchez that night?

640
00:31:18,353 --> 00:31:21,597
No way. Bree couldn't hurt a fly.

641
00:31:22,496 --> 00:31:24,893
The only thing she killed
that night was the chicken.

642
00:31:25,729 --> 00:31:29,677
No. As god as my witness,
Bree did not kill him.

643
00:31:35,632 --> 00:31:36,897
That's it from the car.

644
00:31:36,898 --> 00:31:39,485
My assistant's gonna
pack up the rest of it.

645
00:31:39,678 --> 00:31:42,446
Security's been told not to
let me back in the building.

646
00:31:42,447 --> 00:31:44,612
I swear, Tom, I am
trying to be supportive,

647
00:31:44,613 --> 00:31:47,040
but I'm having a hard time following this.

648
00:31:47,109 --> 00:31:49,106
Why would you hit your boss?

649
00:31:50,118 --> 00:31:52,402
I just... never liked him.

650
00:31:52,406 --> 00:31:55,153
So? There's lots of people you don't like.

651
00:31:55,237 --> 00:31:58,325
Mr. Indich in 3F,
who never picks up after his dog...

652
00:31:58,326 --> 00:32:01,122
I can't even get you
to write an angry note.

653
00:32:01,173 --> 00:32:03,473
You know what? I lost my temper.

654
00:32:04,053 --> 00:32:05,969
Because he was going to transfer you?

655
00:32:07,573 --> 00:32:08,658
No.

656
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,129
Because he was dating Lynette.

657
00:32:17,893 --> 00:32:19,601
Oh, my god.

658
00:32:20,453 --> 00:32:22,161
Are you still in love with her?

659
00:32:25,012 --> 00:32:27,765
Jane, look, you have to understand.
Lynette has...

660
00:32:27,766 --> 00:32:30,995
Been a part of your life
for 23 years. I know.

661
00:32:31,127 --> 00:32:32,313
She's the mother of your children.

662
00:32:32,314 --> 00:32:35,057
I get it. You've given me
this speech a hundred times.

663
00:32:35,058 --> 00:32:36,722
Now answer the question.

664
00:32:36,723 --> 00:32:38,287
Do you still love her?

665
00:32:40,515 --> 00:32:41,662
Yes.

666
00:32:43,794 --> 00:32:44,879
Wow.

667
00:32:46,324 --> 00:32:47,568
And I was, what?

668
00:32:47,572 --> 00:32:51,345
Some... wall you built to try
and hide that from yourself?

669
00:32:51,346 --> 00:32:52,479
No.

670
00:32:53,811 --> 00:32:55,580
You were the woman who was there for me

671
00:32:55,581 --> 00:32:59,173
when I was broken and confused,

672
00:32:59,174 --> 00:33:01,588
and I-I still care about you very much.

673
00:33:01,589 --> 00:33:02,689
No.

674
00:33:03,477 --> 00:33:05,285
Tom, you don't get to
break somebody's heart

675
00:33:05,286 --> 00:33:07,346
and still say you care about them.

676
00:33:13,287 --> 00:33:14,739
If it matters...

677
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:16,787
I loved you.

678
00:33:28,102 --> 00:33:30,402
So you recognize this man as well?

679
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:34,050
Yes. I slept with him, too.

680
00:33:34,614 --> 00:33:36,659
I can imagine how painful this is,

681
00:33:37,509 --> 00:33:41,254
having to publicly acknowledge
liaisons with all these men.

682
00:33:41,255 --> 00:33:43,074
No. You can't.

683
00:33:43,164 --> 00:33:45,030
You didn't have to testify.

684
00:33:45,031 --> 00:33:46,973
Why did you subject yourself to this?

685
00:33:46,974 --> 00:33:50,133
Because I admit my transgressions.

686
00:33:50,134 --> 00:33:52,657
Was killing Ramon Sanchez one of them?

687
00:33:52,806 --> 00:33:55,587
No. Absolutely not.

688
00:34:03,862 --> 00:34:06,097
That seemed very heartfelt.

689
00:34:06,789 --> 00:34:08,801
So your conscience is clear?

690
00:34:09,365 --> 00:34:11,473
Yes. It is.

691
00:34:11,526 --> 00:34:14,613
Your honor, I'd like
to enter into evidence

692
00:34:14,614 --> 00:34:16,415
prosecution exhibit 24.

693
00:34:16,416 --> 00:34:19,898
Objection. We haven't seen this.
They can't blindside us...

694
00:34:19,899 --> 00:34:21,979
This just came into
our possession last night.

695
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,845
It rebuts Ms. Van de kamp's testimony

696
00:34:23,846 --> 00:34:26,017
regarding her clear conscience.

697
00:34:26,966 --> 00:34:28,353
I'll allow it.

698
00:34:29,685 --> 00:34:31,409
Does this letter look familiar?

699
00:34:37,477 --> 00:34:39,330
Yes. I wrote it.

700
00:34:39,669 --> 00:34:42,177
It's a suicide note, isn't it?

701
00:34:43,878 --> 00:34:45,042
Yes.

702
00:34:45,302 --> 00:34:47,969
This letter was discovered on
may 7th at the Frost Hotel,

703
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:50,221
where Ms. Van de kamp had taken a room.

704
00:34:50,241 --> 00:34:51,413
The manager heard shouting,

705
00:34:51,414 --> 00:34:53,153
including a reference to "A gun."

706
00:34:53,154 --> 00:34:55,439
Police were summoned, but
Ms. Van de kamp was gone.

707
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,420
This was found in the wastebasket.

708
00:34:57,617 --> 00:34:59,166
Proceed, Ms. Stone.

709
00:34:59,344 --> 00:35:02,669
Do you recall anything
else of significance

710
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:04,633
occurring on may 7th?

711
00:35:05,197 --> 00:35:06,156
No.

712
00:35:06,157 --> 00:35:08,773
That's the day your boyfriend,
Chuck Vance,

713
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:11,265
a decorated Fairview police detective,

714
00:35:11,365 --> 00:35:13,216
was killed in a hit and
run accident, wasn't it?

715
00:35:13,217 --> 00:35:15,140
Objection. My client isn't on trial

716
00:35:15,141 --> 00:35:17,557
- for killing detective Vance.
- Not yet.

717
00:35:17,558 --> 00:35:19,153
- Your honor...
- Withdrawn.

718
00:35:21,093 --> 00:35:23,057
Please. Read the letter.

719
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:40,792
"I never thought I could feel such...
remorse, such guilt."

720
00:35:40,793 --> 00:35:43,244
Your honor, if we could
take a short recess...

721
00:35:43,245 --> 00:35:44,458
Denied.

722
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:47,097
"No one knows who I really am."

723
00:35:47,485 --> 00:35:49,226
"I'm entirely alone."

724
00:35:49,677 --> 00:35:52,749
"Living with this secret is too painful."

725
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,170
"I can't go on."

726
00:35:57,565 --> 00:35:59,384
Doesn't sound like a clear
conscience, does it,

727
00:35:59,385 --> 00:36:00,614
Ms. Van de Kamp?

728
00:36:00,954 --> 00:36:02,405
No further questions.

729
00:36:06,136 --> 00:36:08,519
- Bree.
- Please, I just need to be alone.

730
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,205
Not until you tell me what that was about.

731
00:36:11,833 --> 00:36:13,429
I already told you.

732
00:36:13,993 --> 00:36:16,104
I was in a very dark place,
with the drinking

733
00:36:16,105 --> 00:36:18,054
and my friends abandoning me.

734
00:36:18,585 --> 00:36:20,757
But I did not kill anyone.

735
00:36:21,465 --> 00:36:22,871
You have to believe me.

736
00:36:22,872 --> 00:36:24,246
I do believe you.

737
00:36:24,665 --> 00:36:27,988
I just... hope the jury does.

738
00:36:31,386 --> 00:36:33,378
Come on. You don't know
that it's your fault.

739
00:36:33,379 --> 00:36:38,733
Please, Tom loses his job
the day after I dump his boss?

740
00:36:38,834 --> 00:36:40,313
There's gotta be some connection,

741
00:36:40,314 --> 00:36:42,157
and the worst part is this is exactly

742
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:43,553
what broke us up in the first place...

743
00:36:43,554 --> 00:36:46,126
me trying to control his life.

744
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:52,046
You really suck at this gay friend thing.

745
00:36:52,047 --> 00:36:53,300
I'm sorry.

746
00:36:53,301 --> 00:36:55,915
I can't take you seriously in that dress.

747
00:36:55,916 --> 00:36:58,309
You look like a giant taffeta bruise.

748
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:01,124
I know. It is horrible.
Maybe if I accessorize.

749
00:37:01,125 --> 00:37:03,810
Unless the accessories are
two hands over your eyes,

750
00:37:03,811 --> 00:37:07,133
forget it. Why don't you just
tell Renee you hate the dress?

751
00:37:07,134 --> 00:37:10,669
Because she'll pick another one,
and I'll hate that one, too.

752
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,108
It's what I do.

753
00:37:12,109 --> 00:37:15,130
I did it to Tom all the time.

754
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:18,972
I didn't want him to go to school,

755
00:37:18,973 --> 00:37:20,804
and then I didn't want him to quit.

756
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:22,306
I wanted him to get a new job,

757
00:37:22,307 --> 00:37:24,670
and then I hated it. I don't know.

758
00:37:24,834 --> 00:37:26,766
Maybe I wasn't unhappy with Tom.

759
00:37:26,767 --> 00:37:28,491
Maybe I was just...

760
00:37:29,503 --> 00:37:30,972
unhappy.

761
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:32,059
Well...

762
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,963
at least we know you were
right about that dress.

763
00:37:37,583 --> 00:37:39,979
Now turn around, let me get you out of it.

764
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,795
Seriously? We're this close?

765
00:37:45,017 --> 00:37:46,458
When I tell the whole
neighborhood about it,

766
00:37:46,459 --> 00:37:47,895
I will be kind.

767
00:37:49,099 --> 00:37:51,143
You're a good friend, Lee.

768
00:38:16,285 --> 00:38:18,508
Celia, give me the remote!

769
00:38:18,509 --> 00:38:20,820
No! Stop! Give it!

770
00:38:20,821 --> 00:38:22,962
Girls, don't make me come in there!

771
00:38:23,554 --> 00:38:25,535
- It's my turn!
- It's not!

772
00:38:29,954 --> 00:38:31,201
Who did this?

773
00:38:31,202 --> 00:38:32,057
Celia.

774
00:38:32,058 --> 00:38:33,462
Is that true, Celia?

775
00:38:33,675 --> 00:38:36,119
This belonged to my grandmother.

776
00:38:36,425 --> 00:38:38,122
You are in big trouble, young lady.

777
00:38:38,123 --> 00:38:40,054
Sweep up the rest, and go to your room.

778
00:38:40,699 --> 00:38:44,104
It's not my fault. She pushed me into it.

779
00:38:44,105 --> 00:38:47,654
- You pushed her?
- She wouldn't give me the remote,

780
00:38:47,655 --> 00:38:49,774
and it was my turn to pick what we watch.

781
00:38:49,775 --> 00:38:51,339
So you broke this.

782
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:53,673
It was my turn.

783
00:38:53,674 --> 00:38:56,290
Juanita Solis, you were gonna
let your sister take the blame

784
00:38:56,291 --> 00:38:57,804
for something you caused?

785
00:38:57,805 --> 00:38:59,241
That is horrible!

786
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:01,596
This is your fault. Own up to it.

787
00:39:01,597 --> 00:39:03,610
Don't you see how bad...

788
00:39:08,397 --> 00:39:11,064
Mom? I'm sorry.

789
00:39:14,334 --> 00:39:15,545
Mommy?

790
00:39:16,364 --> 00:39:17,480
It's okay.

791
00:39:17,612 --> 00:39:19,642
Go wash up for dinner.
I'll take care of this.

792
00:39:28,941 --> 00:39:30,904
And the fracture found
on the victim's head

793
00:39:30,905 --> 00:39:33,433
is consistent with a blunt force injury.

794
00:39:33,434 --> 00:39:34,648
A blunt force that someone

795
00:39:34,649 --> 00:39:37,880
of Ms. Van de kamp's size would
be capable of inflicting?

796
00:39:37,881 --> 00:39:39,157
In my opinion.

797
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:42,806
Your honor, the defense
asks the court for a recess.

798
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,572
How did you find that?

799
00:39:52,618 --> 00:39:56,501
When Gaby mentioned her
"Gardener," Alejandro,

800
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:57,530
my alarm bells went off.

801
00:39:57,531 --> 00:39:59,878
I had Lindsay do a little investigating.

802
00:40:00,507 --> 00:40:01,070
Oh.

803
00:40:01,071 --> 00:40:02,138
"Oh"?

804
00:40:02,287 --> 00:40:04,859
We're halfway through your murder trial,

805
00:40:05,151 --> 00:40:07,479
and I find out the victim
is Gaby's stepfather,

806
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,960
and all you can say is "Oh"?

807
00:40:08,961 --> 00:40:10,477
I'm sorry.

808
00:40:10,897 --> 00:40:13,465
I wanted to tell you, but we made a pact.

809
00:40:13,466 --> 00:40:14,567
Who did?

810
00:40:14,714 --> 00:40:15,895
You and Gaby?

811
00:40:16,187 --> 00:40:19,545
Me and Gaby and... other people...

812
00:40:19,546 --> 00:40:21,302
people that I care about.

813
00:40:21,674 --> 00:40:23,441
You care about them
enough to lie for them?

814
00:40:23,442 --> 00:40:24,638
To commit perjury?

815
00:40:24,961 --> 00:40:26,766
How about enough to go to jail?

816
00:40:28,513 --> 00:40:29,220
You don't actually think

817
00:40:29,221 --> 00:40:31,696
- that's gonna happen, do you?
- I don't know.

818
00:40:31,973 --> 00:40:34,144
After the D.A.'s suicide note stunt,

819
00:40:34,145 --> 00:40:35,421
it's possible.

820
00:40:35,553 --> 00:40:37,296
To the jury, you look like
you're hiding something,

821
00:40:37,297 --> 00:40:39,509
and the fact is, you are.

822
00:40:41,929 --> 00:40:46,437
Look, I just... I just...
I wanna win this case

823
00:40:46,729 --> 00:40:48,213
for you, okay?

824
00:40:48,586 --> 00:40:51,604
And if this is something
that can exonerate you...

825
00:40:51,605 --> 00:40:55,762
It can, but not without
betraying my friends.

826
00:41:03,937 --> 00:41:04,938
Bree...

827
00:41:06,031 --> 00:41:08,106
You're facing 20 years to life.

828
00:41:08,107 --> 00:41:10,150
This could be your only way out.

829
00:41:10,827 --> 00:41:13,495
I think it's time to tell
the truth about Gaby.

830
00:41:20,059 --> 00:41:24,049
<i>Yes, recent events in
the lives of my friends</i>

831
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:26,926
<i>had stirred up intense emotions...</i>

832
00:41:28,882 --> 00:41:32,510
<i>excitement about starting a new chapter...</i>

833
00:41:35,074 --> 00:41:38,479
<i>guilt over causing another's pain...</i>

834
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:45,358
<i>disappointment in a failure to change.</i>

835
00:41:47,666 --> 00:41:49,916
<i>Then there are those who are asked</i>

836
00:41:49,917 --> 00:41:52,460
<i>to put all emotion aside</i>

837
00:41:52,461 --> 00:41:56,442
<i>in order to make a coldhearted decision.</i>

838
00:41:57,277 --> 00:41:59,529
Gaby, what are you doing here?

839
00:42:01,374 --> 00:42:03,672
I finally found the perfect scarf.

840
00:42:03,853 --> 00:42:05,692
It's... elegant.

841
00:42:05,693 --> 00:42:08,089
It's dignified. It's beautiful.

842
00:42:08,542 --> 00:42:09,673
It's you.

843
00:42:10,174 --> 00:42:11,721
You are so sweet.

844
00:42:11,885 --> 00:42:13,545
You didn't need to do this.

845
00:42:13,901 --> 00:42:15,385
Yes, I did.

846
00:42:16,637 --> 00:42:19,161
I haven't truly thanked
you for what you're doing,

847
00:42:19,997 --> 00:42:23,113
the way you're sacrificing
yourself for me and my family.

848
00:42:25,053 --> 00:42:27,834
You're just a much better person
than I could ever hope to be.

849
00:42:29,315 --> 00:42:30,943
Oh, Gaby.
