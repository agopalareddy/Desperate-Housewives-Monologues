1
00:00:00,828 --> 00:00:03,044
<i>Previously on Desperate housewives.</i>

2
00:00:03,044 --> 00:00:05,290
We have some serious problems

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:08,471
that are gonna require serious work.

4
00:00:08,471 --> 00:00:11,951
<i>Lynette and Tom struggled
with their separation.</i>

5
00:00:12,428 --> 00:00:14,060
<i>Mike heard a confession...</i>

6
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,417
I killed Gaby's stepfather.

7
00:00:16,458 --> 00:00:17,411
Aah! Uhh!

8
00:00:17,411 --> 00:00:19,714
And me and the girls helped cover it up.

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,478
<i>That could change
his life with Susan forever.</i>

10
00:00:25,374 --> 00:00:27,474
<i>Bree showed Gaby the note...</i>

11
00:00:27,504 --> 00:00:29,217
Let's say someone knows.

12
00:00:29,217 --> 00:00:30,883
I say until they tell us what they want,

13
00:00:30,883 --> 00:00:33,604
we just act like everything's normal.

14
00:00:33,695 --> 00:00:37,108
<i>And decided she needed
to end her relationship</i>

15
00:00:37,108 --> 00:00:38,810
<i>with detective Vance.</i>

16
00:00:38,855 --> 00:00:41,852
You know, Bree, I would
have done anything for you.

17
00:00:44,518 --> 00:00:47,892
You have made a very big mistake.

18
00:00:56,157 --> 00:00:58,979
<i>It's often said that children learn</i>

19
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:02,220
<i>their most important lessons
outside the classroom.</i>

20
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:07,985
<i>They learn to find peaceful
ways to resolve conflict...</i>

21
00:01:09,728 --> 00:01:12,529
<i>to make smart choices about nutrition...</i>

22
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,291
<i>to master the art of conversation.</i>

23
00:01:20,301 --> 00:01:22,405
<i>But for Gabrielle Solis,</i>

24
00:01:22,405 --> 00:01:24,643
<i>the art of morning drop-off...</i>

25
00:01:24,735 --> 00:01:27,628
What's taking so long? Come on! Let's go!

26
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,490
<i>Was something she'd never learned.</i>

27
00:01:31,417 --> 00:01:34,117
You slow down, push the kid out,
and drive off!

28
00:01:34,117 --> 00:01:35,933
Why is it so hard?!

29
00:01:36,116 --> 00:01:38,567
You realize I have to go
to this school, right?

30
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,660
Oh, come on. I'm behind
the wheelchair kid?

31
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,947
That's it, Juanita. Get out.

32
00:01:42,947 --> 00:01:44,751
I'm not allowed till
we get to the green zone

33
00:01:44,751 --> 00:01:46,323
and a volunteer opens the door.

34
00:01:46,323 --> 00:01:47,699
Remember what happened last week?

35
00:01:47,699 --> 00:01:50,713
Yeah, last week I made it
to my hot stone massage.

36
00:01:50,773 --> 00:01:52,073
Just keep your head down,

37
00:01:52,073 --> 00:01:53,563
pretend like you don't
speak english, and run.

38
00:02:05,651 --> 00:02:06,771
Hold it!

39
00:02:07,033 --> 00:02:07,979
Ohh.

40
00:02:14,163 --> 00:02:16,364
Hi, Dana. I didn't see you there.

41
00:02:16,364 --> 00:02:18,195
Looks like someone didn't learn her lesson

42
00:02:18,195 --> 00:02:20,958
the last two times
she broke the drop-off rules.

43
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:22,822
Three strikes, Solis.

44
00:02:23,702 --> 00:02:24,754
You're out.

45
00:02:24,754 --> 00:02:26,759
Wh... Hey!

46
00:02:27,278 --> 00:02:28,457
I need that!

47
00:02:28,457 --> 00:02:30,628
Your drop-off privileges
have been revoked.

48
00:02:30,628 --> 00:02:32,251
From now on, you'll be
parking in the "B" lot

49
00:02:32,251 --> 00:02:34,356
- and walking Juanita to class.
- The "B" lot?

50
00:02:34,356 --> 00:02:36,956
That's, like, a mile away.
These don't walk.

51
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,115
They do now.

52
00:02:38,115 --> 00:02:40,896
Oh, yeah? Well, who died
and made you boss?

53
00:02:40,897 --> 00:02:42,897
Margaret Frye. Cancer.

54
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,128
Oh. Right. I still owe for those flowers.

55
00:02:47,613 --> 00:02:50,753
Oh, relax, Pam! You'll still
make it to weight watchers!

56
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:51,730
Problem here, Dana?

57
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,761
Oh, great. Now the pips are here.

58
00:02:54,012 --> 00:02:56,810
It's Solis again.
She's holding up traffic.

59
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:59,472
Yeah, and I'm not moving till
you give me back my placard.

60
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,784
Oh, Pam, eat a carrot!

61
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,391
Tell you what.

62
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:06,999
If you can take the placard
from me, you can keep it.

63
00:03:09,332 --> 00:03:10,925
You know what? I'm not a child.

64
00:03:10,925 --> 00:03:13,139
I'm not gonna give you the satisfaction...

65
00:03:18,888 --> 00:03:19,907
Oh!

66
00:03:20,723 --> 00:03:22,743
You know what, Dana?
Just because you're head of P.T.A.

67
00:03:22,743 --> 00:03:24,405
doesn't mean you get to make the laws!

68
00:03:24,405 --> 00:03:27,782
Oh, I have news for you.
Here at Oakridge, I am the law.

69
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:32,095
<i>Yes, some of our most important lessons</i>

70
00:03:32,095 --> 00:03:34,560
<i>are learned outside the class room.</i>

71
00:03:34,943 --> 00:03:37,433
<i>And when it came to school politics,</i>

72
00:03:38,119 --> 00:03:42,173
<i>Gabrielle's education was just beginning.</i>

73
00:03:54,538 --> 00:03:56,704
<i>When it came to her separation,</i>

74
00:03:56,704 --> 00:04:01,289
<i>Lynette Scavo was determined
to do everything by the book.</i>

75
00:04:02,574 --> 00:04:04,713
<i>She made sure her visitation days</i>

76
00:04:04,713 --> 00:04:06,602
<i>were evenly divided.</i>

77
00:04:07,826 --> 00:04:11,675
<i>She kept perfect records
of her household expenses.</i>

78
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,614
<i>She found healthy ways
to relieve her stress.</i>

79
00:04:18,115 --> 00:04:20,318
<i>Yes, Lynette was confident</i>

80
00:04:20,318 --> 00:04:23,053
<i>her by-the-book approach
was the right one,</i>

81
00:04:23,739 --> 00:04:27,151
<i>sadly, not everyone was on the same page.</i>

82
00:04:27,151 --> 00:04:29,387
Well, look who cleaned
out the sad-sack aisle

83
00:04:29,387 --> 00:04:30,722
at the bookstore.

84
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,124
At least your divorce is good
for the publishing industry.

85
00:04:33,124 --> 00:04:35,152
We're not using the "D" word.

86
00:04:35,152 --> 00:04:36,899
It's a separation.

87
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:40,694
Tom and I are going to
"Heal through counseling"

88
00:04:40,694 --> 00:04:44,389
so we can find "A road to reconnection"

89
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:45,960
and if not,

90
00:04:46,445 --> 00:04:48,559
"Murder on the orient express."

91
00:04:51,239 --> 00:04:53,827
Penny, your dad's here!

92
00:04:54,149 --> 00:04:55,364
Explain something to me.

93
00:04:55,364 --> 00:04:56,912
If you're trying to win back your husband,

94
00:04:56,912 --> 00:04:59,522
why do you dress like you
sell oranges by the freeway?

95
00:05:00,172 --> 00:05:02,141
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

96
00:05:02,238 --> 00:05:03,912
I had to stop at the store,

97
00:05:03,913 --> 00:05:05,465
and it took longer than I expected.

98
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,295
Because you tawt you taw a puddy tat?

99
00:05:08,693 --> 00:05:10,214
Ha ha.

100
00:05:12,216 --> 00:05:14,058
It's just a teeth whitener.

101
00:05:14,767 --> 00:05:16,079
Teeth whitening, huh?

102
00:05:16,632 --> 00:05:19,007
And unless sweat suits are
the new business casual,

103
00:05:19,007 --> 00:05:21,037
it looks like you're working out, too.

104
00:05:21,514 --> 00:05:25,238
I'm trying. It helps cheer me
up when the kids aren't around.

105
00:05:25,238 --> 00:05:26,753
- Daddy!
- Hey!

106
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,170
Oh! Remember to get Parker at practice.

107
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:31,771
- I love you. Have fun at your dad's.
- I love you. Bye.

108
00:05:31,771 --> 00:05:32,944
Drive safe.

109
00:05:36,407 --> 00:05:37,359
Hmm.

110
00:05:38,751 --> 00:05:40,782
I've got a new book title for you...

111
00:05:41,263 --> 00:05:43,565
"Your husband's banging somebody."

112
00:05:44,499 --> 00:05:45,545
What?

113
00:05:46,105 --> 00:05:48,304
Chapter one... white teeth.

114
00:05:48,304 --> 00:05:50,594
Chapter two... working out.

115
00:05:50,594 --> 00:05:53,032
Chapter three... the nasty.

116
00:05:53,594 --> 00:05:56,876
He's just trying to take
better care of himself.

117
00:05:56,876 --> 00:05:58,182
Oh, Lynette.

118
00:05:58,182 --> 00:06:01,179
I expect you to be naive about hair,
makeup, and fashion,

119
00:06:01,179 --> 00:06:02,427
but about this?

120
00:06:02,543 --> 00:06:05,313
Trust me. Tom has hooked up.

121
00:06:05,313 --> 00:06:07,852
He's not. He's not. If he was...

122
00:06:07,925 --> 00:06:09,606
dating someone,

123
00:06:09,606 --> 00:06:10,968
he would tell me.

124
00:06:13,325 --> 00:06:14,331
He would.

125
00:06:16,697 --> 00:06:17,578
Right?

126
00:06:37,033 --> 00:06:39,043
- That doesn't look too suspicious.
- Oh.

127
00:06:40,078 --> 00:06:41,969
I'm sorry. Just...
every time I check the mail,

128
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:44,208
I'm afraid it's gonna be
another one of those letters.

129
00:06:44,313 --> 00:06:46,663
It's been three weeks.
Maybe we're out of the woods.

130
00:06:46,826 --> 00:06:47,986
Please don't say "Woods."

131
00:06:47,986 --> 00:06:50,185
I'm just saying, if someone
was trying to blackmail us,

132
00:06:50,185 --> 00:06:51,481
they're not very good at it,

133
00:06:51,481 --> 00:06:53,248
since they haven't asked
for money or anything.

134
00:06:53,248 --> 00:06:56,330
Well, what happened to them?
Did they just disappear?

135
00:06:56,554 --> 00:06:57,677
If we're lucky.

136
00:06:58,113 --> 00:07:00,216
Now that Chuck the cop
is out of your life,

137
00:07:00,216 --> 00:07:01,545
Susan's acting normal,

138
00:07:01,545 --> 00:07:02,975
I think we're in the clear.

139
00:07:04,552 --> 00:07:06,976
Oh, good. Here they are. Hmm.

140
00:07:07,882 --> 00:07:10,114
Oh, Danielle and Benjamin.

141
00:07:10,832 --> 00:07:12,322
Fun. What's the occasion?

142
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:13,803
Her husband left her.

143
00:07:13,803 --> 00:07:16,057
Ugh. Okay. Well, I'd stay and say hi,

144
00:07:16,057 --> 00:07:18,595
but that would involve a lot
of listening and sad nodding.

145
00:07:21,318 --> 00:07:24,048
Oh, honey, I am so sorry
about you and Leo.

146
00:07:24,048 --> 00:07:24,966
Thanks, mom.

147
00:07:24,966 --> 00:07:26,719
Not that I didn't see it coming.

148
00:07:27,503 --> 00:07:28,646
That didn't take long.

149
00:07:28,646 --> 00:07:30,218
Neither did the marriage.

150
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:32,464
So how are you holding up?

151
00:07:32,464 --> 00:07:34,487
My husband left me. It sucks.

152
00:07:35,324 --> 00:07:36,908
But you know how that feels.

153
00:07:37,685 --> 00:07:39,978
You just got dumped by that cop, right?

154
00:07:40,561 --> 00:07:41,731
Um...

155
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,792
Actually, I am the one
who ended it with Chuck.

156
00:07:44,792 --> 00:07:47,285
He wanted to marry me, bought me a ring,

157
00:07:47,511 --> 00:07:49,704
but that's not important.

158
00:07:49,704 --> 00:07:51,198
This week...

159
00:07:53,232 --> 00:07:55,149
or weeks is about you.

160
00:07:55,149 --> 00:07:57,692
We are gonna make a plan to
put your life back together.

161
00:07:57,692 --> 00:07:59,994
A plan? Mom, this all just happened.

162
00:08:00,253 --> 00:08:03,590
Give me a few days to eat
ice cream and veg out.

163
00:08:03,694 --> 00:08:06,523
Of course, honey.
I promised you on your wedding day

164
00:08:06,523 --> 00:08:08,731
that I would be here when he left you.

165
00:08:10,589 --> 00:08:11,466
You know what?

166
00:08:11,466 --> 00:08:13,521
Maybe we'll just crash on Andrew's floor.

167
00:08:13,521 --> 00:08:15,564
What? That's so uncomfortable.

168
00:08:15,564 --> 00:08:18,790
Not as bad as staying here and
getting picked apart by you.

169
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,039
I promise I won't criticize you.

170
00:08:23,148 --> 00:08:24,725
Besides, if you sleep on Andrew's floor,

171
00:08:24,725 --> 00:08:26,250
you'll need a tetanus shot.

172
00:08:27,936 --> 00:08:29,711
What? I said I wouldn't criticize you.

173
00:08:29,711 --> 00:08:31,617
I didn't say anything about your brother.

174
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,263
Okay, I know that last night

175
00:08:46,263 --> 00:08:47,907
I said you could take
all the time you need

176
00:08:47,907 --> 00:08:50,229
to work through what
Carlos and I told you,

177
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:51,139
but...

178
00:08:51,946 --> 00:08:54,114
while you're taking all the time you need,

179
00:08:54,763 --> 00:08:56,200
you think you could maybe...

180
00:08:57,274 --> 00:08:59,122
tell me that you still love me?

181
00:08:59,856 --> 00:09:00,899
I mean...

182
00:09:01,563 --> 00:09:02,837
if you still love me?

183
00:09:07,411 --> 00:09:09,217
There is nothing you could do

184
00:09:10,192 --> 00:09:11,891
that would make me stop loving you.

185
00:09:13,391 --> 00:09:17,405
Mike, it was so hard
to keep this from you,

186
00:09:17,405 --> 00:09:19,241
like, the hardest thing I've ever done.

187
00:09:19,638 --> 00:09:22,906
Well, at least I understand
why you've been so distant.

188
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,081
And to be honest,

189
00:09:25,081 --> 00:09:26,937
I'm kind of relieved you
weren't having an affair.

190
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:29,065
Well, now that you know,

191
00:09:29,328 --> 00:09:31,344
I just want everything
to go back to normal.

192
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:36,947
Okay, but I hope you realize

193
00:09:36,947 --> 00:09:38,262
it might not be that easy.

194
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:43,765
Take it from a guy who's
done things like this.

195
00:09:43,765 --> 00:09:45,176
They don't just disappear.

196
00:09:47,035 --> 00:09:48,288
Yeah, I know that.

197
00:09:49,636 --> 00:09:52,626
But I think if I focus on other stuff

198
00:09:53,061 --> 00:09:54,768
and move on with my life,

199
00:09:54,778 --> 00:09:56,032
it'll be okay.

200
00:09:56,574 --> 00:09:57,606
Great.

201
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,078
And first step?

202
00:10:02,003 --> 00:10:04,094
I'm taking a painting
class at the college.

203
00:10:04,168 --> 00:10:06,447
It's being taught by Andre Zeller.

204
00:10:08,318 --> 00:10:10,064
Okay, that means nothing to you.

205
00:10:10,455 --> 00:10:12,905
It's like I'm taking a football class

206
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:14,496
from Peyton Manning.

207
00:10:14,496 --> 00:10:15,589
Whoa.

208
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:18,313
It's just what I need.

209
00:10:18,423 --> 00:10:19,644
I think it'll be a great way

210
00:10:19,644 --> 00:10:21,579
to take my mind off
everything that's happened.

211
00:10:22,417 --> 00:10:24,904
So I'm gonna get my portfolio together.

212
00:10:24,904 --> 00:10:27,287
Mr. Zeller has to approve
all his students.

213
00:10:27,287 --> 00:10:28,613
Not that I'm worried.

214
00:10:29,392 --> 00:10:30,689
Oh, and, Mike,

215
00:10:31,185 --> 00:10:33,401
from now on, I swear,

216
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,064
no more secrets between us.

217
00:10:45,199 --> 00:10:46,406
Is that my school?

218
00:10:46,406 --> 00:10:48,549
The tiny, little building way down there?

219
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,872
It would've been faster
if we just walked from home.

220
00:10:52,028 --> 00:10:53,004
Hey.

221
00:10:53,385 --> 00:10:55,019
First time in the "B" lot, huh?

222
00:10:56,664 --> 00:10:58,576
- Welcome.
- What are you in for?

223
00:10:59,037 --> 00:11:00,066
Practically nothing.

224
00:11:00,066 --> 00:11:02,053
I let my kid get out
of the car by herself.

225
00:11:02,085 --> 00:11:04,775
- Ooh.
- Dana take your placard?

226
00:11:04,775 --> 00:11:07,685
Yeah, but I'll get it
back in a day or two.

227
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,393
Are you kidding?

228
00:11:10,393 --> 00:11:12,430
She'll have you in here
for the rest of the year.

229
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,613
What? She can't do that.

230
00:11:14,613 --> 00:11:15,822
Oh, you wanna bet?

231
00:11:15,822 --> 00:11:18,587
I took a cell phone
call in the green zone.

232
00:11:18,986 --> 00:11:20,337
That was two months ago.

233
00:11:20,337 --> 00:11:23,514
My kid had peanut butter
crackers in his lunchbox.

234
00:11:23,514 --> 00:11:25,178
I'm looking at four to six.

235
00:11:25,178 --> 00:11:26,624
This is crazy.

236
00:11:26,624 --> 00:11:28,464
No, this is Dana.

237
00:11:28,464 --> 00:11:30,169
Dana "The pain-a." Pfft!

238
00:11:30,169 --> 00:11:32,083
Dana "You better not complain-a."

239
00:11:32,494 --> 00:11:34,565
Dana "Power's driving me insane-a."

240
00:11:35,546 --> 00:11:37,712
Oh, my god. Is this what
the "B" lot does to you?

241
00:11:37,712 --> 00:11:40,782
That, four kids,
and the flask in her purse.

242
00:11:40,792 --> 00:11:43,584
Well, if everyone thinks
she's such a pain-a,

243
00:11:43,584 --> 00:11:44,700
how'd she get the job?

244
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,607
It's an elected position.
We voted for her.

245
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:50,006
Well, not me. I don't vote.

246
00:11:50,673 --> 00:11:52,661
All right, when's the next P.T.A. meeting?

247
00:11:52,727 --> 00:11:54,055
There's one thursday.

248
00:11:54,055 --> 00:11:57,307
Okay. I say we band together,

249
00:11:57,434 --> 00:12:00,570
storm that meeting, and go all
"Braveheart" on Dana's ass.

250
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:01,796
Who's with me?

251
00:12:04,151 --> 00:12:05,604
You guys not seen "Braveheart"?

252
00:12:06,049 --> 00:12:09,085
I know it's an old reference,
but this is when you go, "Yeah!"

253
00:12:09,568 --> 00:12:11,197
Yeah.

254
00:12:11,334 --> 00:12:12,865
Oh, god. Come on.

255
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:15,431
If every fed-up mom in
this "B" lot shows up,

256
00:12:15,431 --> 00:12:17,845
we can break our shackles,
get our placards back.

257
00:12:17,845 --> 00:12:19,784
We can... oh! The movie "300."

258
00:12:19,784 --> 00:12:22,756
This is Sparta!

259
00:12:22,785 --> 00:12:23,804
You've seen that, right?

260
00:12:23,804 --> 00:12:25,225
Yeah!

261
00:12:25,225 --> 00:12:28,097
Okay. I'll see you ladies thursday.

262
00:12:34,085 --> 00:12:35,115
Mm-hmm.

263
00:12:36,761 --> 00:12:38,284
This is excellent work.

264
00:12:39,553 --> 00:12:41,118
Thank you, Mr. Zeller.

265
00:12:41,447 --> 00:12:43,243
Now I know what you're thinking...

266
00:12:43,631 --> 00:12:47,170
why does a professional
artist who can do this

267
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:48,833
want to take a painting class?

268
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,715
That is what I'm thinking.

269
00:12:50,715 --> 00:12:53,957
Well, mainly because I'm
a huge fan of your work.

270
00:12:53,957 --> 00:12:57,232
That series you did based
on Dante's "Inferno,"

271
00:12:57,232 --> 00:13:00,069
the one with the guy chewing
the other guy's head off...

272
00:13:00,894 --> 00:13:02,463
I wish I could paint like that.

273
00:13:02,863 --> 00:13:03,715
You're very kind,

274
00:13:03,715 --> 00:13:06,271
but then again, look what
you've done with these bunnies.

275
00:13:06,331 --> 00:13:08,006
Um, do you start with watercolor

276
00:13:08,006 --> 00:13:09,706
and then outline with rapidograph...

277
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,809
Actually, it's the other way around.

278
00:13:11,818 --> 00:13:13,611
I have a very steady hand.

279
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:14,961
Well, clearly.

280
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:17,030
My compliments, Ms. Delfino.

281
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,851
Technically, this is very impressive.

282
00:13:18,851 --> 00:13:20,728
Oh, thank you.

283
00:13:21,644 --> 00:13:22,806
So...

284
00:13:23,706 --> 00:13:25,384
obviously, I'm in.

285
00:13:25,556 --> 00:13:28,031
No. Obviously, you're out.

286
00:13:30,492 --> 00:13:31,495
What?

287
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,908
Don't get me wrong.
You're a fine illustrator,

288
00:13:33,908 --> 00:13:35,688
but this isn't what I call art.

289
00:13:35,688 --> 00:13:38,781
Excuse me, but my paintings
have been in dozens of books,

290
00:13:38,781 --> 00:13:40,477
some of them bestsellers.

291
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:43,912
Perhaps you've heard of
"Doctor porcupine"?

292
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:46,686
He has a very prickly bedside manner.

293
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:49,351
Right. But see, when you say "Art,"

294
00:13:49,558 --> 00:13:51,420
you mean a hedgehog with a stethoscope,

295
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,697
and to me, art means
reaching down your throat,

296
00:13:53,697 --> 00:13:56,726
tearing your guts out,
and smearing it all over canvas.

297
00:13:56,906 --> 00:14:00,377
Anger, passion... that's what interests me.

298
00:14:00,864 --> 00:14:01,846
Well, uh,

299
00:14:01,846 --> 00:14:04,822
"Doctor porcupine loses a
patient and kills a hooker"

300
00:14:04,822 --> 00:14:06,473
doesn't have the same ring to it.

301
00:14:06,657 --> 00:14:09,285
I'm looking for serious
students of the medium.

302
00:14:09,512 --> 00:14:11,490
You're a bored housewife
trying to kill time

303
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:14,625
between spin class and driving
your kid to soccer practice.

304
00:14:14,726 --> 00:14:15,920
Hey, that's not fair.

305
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,235
Um, just because
I've done children's books

306
00:14:19,235 --> 00:14:21,092
doesn't mean I can't do anything else.

307
00:14:21,137 --> 00:14:23,550
Really? Do you have any work

308
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,177
that reflects what
I've been talking about?

309
00:14:25,996 --> 00:14:27,361
Of course I do.

310
00:14:28,555 --> 00:14:30,041
I'll bring it in tomorrow.

311
00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:35,524
I would bring it in now,
but I have to pick up my son...

312
00:14:36,507 --> 00:14:37,595
from prison.

313
00:14:40,539 --> 00:14:43,255
In 1985, musician Bob Geldof

314
00:14:43,255 --> 00:14:46,252
organized a benefit concert
to fight famine in...

315
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:47,287
There you are.

316
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:48,991
Though I don't know why I'm surprised.

317
00:14:48,991 --> 00:14:50,994
It's where you've been
the last three days.

318
00:14:50,994 --> 00:14:52,987
Guatemala. It's Guatemala!

319
00:14:53,091 --> 00:14:55,067
- Ethiopia.
- Loser.

320
00:14:55,778 --> 00:14:58,771
Ethiopia is correct! Congratulations.

321
00:14:59,129 --> 00:15:00,863
Well, given that you won't be

322
00:15:00,864 --> 00:15:03,494
making your fortune off game shows,

323
00:15:04,201 --> 00:15:06,590
perhaps it's time we had
that talk about your future.

324
00:15:06,591 --> 00:15:08,386
Mom, I'm still healing.

325
00:15:08,387 --> 00:15:09,569
My marriage fell apart.

326
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:12,108
You, of all people,
should know how that feels.

327
00:15:12,109 --> 00:15:14,571
Yes, and I sat in that
same chair "Healing"

328
00:15:14,572 --> 00:15:17,583
and eventually turned
into a raging alcoholic.

329
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:18,654
Oh, man.

330
00:15:18,655 --> 00:15:20,490
Wine sounds really good right now.

331
00:15:20,491 --> 00:15:22,096
We should get a bottle.

332
00:15:23,581 --> 00:15:24,842
What, you can't even have a sip?

333
00:15:24,843 --> 00:15:27,092
No! Now you need to think about

334
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,611
putting your life back together,
getting a job.

335
00:15:29,612 --> 00:15:31,741
You have a son to consider.

336
00:15:32,272 --> 00:15:33,816
Oh, jeez.

337
00:15:35,292 --> 00:15:36,745
I found you!

338
00:15:36,746 --> 00:15:39,847
Now go hide, and we'll play again!

339
00:15:41,203 --> 00:15:44,664
One, two, three...

340
00:15:44,665 --> 00:15:46,786
Okay, there is something
I've been thinking about doing.

341
00:15:46,787 --> 00:15:48,908
Oh. What job?

342
00:15:48,909 --> 00:15:51,216
Retail? Waitressing?

343
00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:53,656
Better. My own business.

344
00:15:53,657 --> 00:15:56,333
I designed this exercise equipment,

345
00:15:56,334 --> 00:15:58,602
and I think I could
sell it on the internet.

346
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:02,374
Danielle, what do you know
about starting a business?

347
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:05,135
I already have the design,
and I wrote up a business plan.

348
00:16:05,136 --> 00:16:06,415
I think it could really work.

349
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:10,110
All I need is a little
seed money. Say $5,000?

350
00:16:10,111 --> 00:16:11,330
$5,000?

351
00:16:11,331 --> 00:16:12,722
Well, I need the supplies,

352
00:16:12,723 --> 00:16:14,732
and I have to rent a place to work out of.

353
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:20,701
I will give you $500,
and you can use the test kitchen.

354
00:16:21,065 --> 00:16:22,448
Seriously?

355
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,172
Mom, thank you so much.
This means a lot to me.

356
00:16:26,173 --> 00:16:28,495
Well, I am very proud of you.
And you know what?

357
00:16:28,496 --> 00:16:31,847
You are setting a wonderful
example for Benjamin.

358
00:16:31,848 --> 00:16:33,780
Oh, crap.

359
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,495
Ready or not, here I come!

360
00:16:40,358 --> 00:16:42,066
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

361
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:43,333
I hope you don't mind If I have my lunch

362
00:16:43,334 --> 00:16:45,040
while we go over our schedules.

363
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:46,274
That's lunch?

364
00:16:46,275 --> 00:16:47,436
Protein shake.

365
00:16:47,437 --> 00:16:51,441
Just trying to stay, uh, lean and mean.

366
00:16:51,843 --> 00:16:53,162
I did that once.

367
00:16:53,757 --> 00:16:55,099
All I got was mean.

368
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:58,970
Hey, I had to move my meeting
to wednesday afternoon.

369
00:16:58,971 --> 00:16:59,903
Think you can pick up the kids?

370
00:16:59,904 --> 00:17:02,333
I'll cover Penny's orthodontist on friday.

371
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,695
Sure. And saturday,
Parker has that birthday.

372
00:17:05,696 --> 00:17:06,626
Since that's your day,

373
00:17:06,627 --> 00:17:10,020
you can have him longer on sunday,
if you want.

374
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,226
Great. Yeah. Okay.

375
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:14,956
That is everything on my end. You?

376
00:17:15,227 --> 00:17:18,807
Um, I heard back from
that couples counselor.

377
00:17:18,808 --> 00:17:21,878
She can squeeze us in thursday at 6:00.

378
00:17:22,443 --> 00:17:25,495
I mean, if you still
want to go to therapy.

379
00:17:26,669 --> 00:17:28,004
Absolutely.

380
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,076
Oh.

381
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:30,991
I can make thursday work.

382
00:17:31,644 --> 00:17:33,851
Good. I'll book the appointment.

383
00:17:36,168 --> 00:17:37,117
Hello?

384
00:17:38,793 --> 00:17:39,622
Hey.

385
00:17:42,371 --> 00:17:44,296
Y... hey, can I call you back?

386
00:17:46,975 --> 00:17:49,244
Okay. O-okay. Hold-hold on a sec.

387
00:17:49,245 --> 00:17:51,683
Um, this is a work thing.

388
00:17:51,684 --> 00:17:52,997
Is there anything else you need from me?

389
00:17:52,998 --> 00:17:55,164
Uh, no.

390
00:17:55,505 --> 00:17:56,600
Okay. Okay.

391
00:17:56,601 --> 00:18:00,576
- I will... see you thursday.
- Okay.

392
00:18:03,074 --> 00:18:06,443
Hey, sorry about that. I, uh, I was in...

393
00:18:10,865 --> 00:18:11,966
Let me get this straight, Jill.

394
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:13,812
For back to school night appetizers,

395
00:18:13,813 --> 00:18:15,481
you're suggesting pretzels?

396
00:18:16,605 --> 00:18:18,421
What are we, a public school?

397
00:18:20,176 --> 00:18:21,860
- Hey. Sorry.
- Hey.

398
00:18:21,861 --> 00:18:24,270
Did you guys know there was
an A.A. meeting in the gym?

399
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:26,249
I sat through five
"I left my kid in the car"

400
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,210
"while drinking" stories

401
00:18:27,211 --> 00:18:29,230
before I realized I was
in the wrong place.

402
00:18:29,231 --> 00:18:30,815
Doughnut?

403
00:18:33,005 --> 00:18:34,809
Gabrielle Solis.

404
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:38,151
What brings you to your
first ever P.T.A. meeting?

405
00:18:40,462 --> 00:18:43,237
Same thing that brought
our founding fathers to...

406
00:18:44,361 --> 00:18:45,558
wherever they went

407
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:48,097
when all that crap happened
with England... freedom.

408
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,597
- Freedom?
- Yeah, that's right.

409
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:54,081
Freedom to oppose an unjust ruler

410
00:18:54,082 --> 00:18:56,436
and her unjust placard-stealing ways.

411
00:18:56,437 --> 00:18:59,849
We are here to tell you your
reign of terror is over.

412
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:01,226
Right, girls?

413
00:19:03,132 --> 00:19:04,978
Guys, come on!

414
00:19:06,093 --> 00:19:08,169
Melissa, have you forgotten about

415
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:10,632
the blood blister you got
hiking from the "B" lot?

416
00:19:10,633 --> 00:19:13,646
And you... other woman,

417
00:19:14,068 --> 00:19:15,774
you were 20 minutes late to your manicure.

418
00:19:15,775 --> 00:19:17,222
Show 'em your hands.

419
00:19:18,578 --> 00:19:20,192
This can't go on.

420
00:19:22,072 --> 00:19:23,345
She's right.

421
00:19:23,346 --> 00:19:26,172
Yeah. Tell her, Gaby.

422
00:19:26,173 --> 00:19:28,464
According to your sacred rule book,

423
00:19:28,465 --> 00:19:30,439
which, by the way, is a snore fest,

424
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,625
a group of five parents can
seek a vote of no confidence

425
00:19:33,626 --> 00:19:34,909
in a president.

426
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,990
So... I guess we'll be
taking that vote now.

427
00:19:40,991 --> 00:19:43,764
Melissa, Rachel...

428
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:47,187
You sure you want to do this?

429
00:19:52,626 --> 00:19:55,127
No. It's an obvious bribe.

430
00:19:55,128 --> 00:19:57,530
- Well, it worked.
- Yeah.

431
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:59,198
What?

432
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:08,407
Guess we won't be having
that vote after all.

433
00:20:08,552 --> 00:20:11,010
So what? What more can you do to me?

434
00:20:11,011 --> 00:20:13,174
I already park in the "B" lot.

435
00:20:25,927 --> 00:20:27,701
Nice, mom.

436
00:20:36,036 --> 00:20:37,637
Hello!

437
00:20:37,638 --> 00:20:41,374
Mom. I, uh, I asked you
not to come in here.

438
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:42,909
I am not staying. I just thought

439
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:46,791
my little entrepreneurs
could use some lemonade.

440
00:20:47,742 --> 00:20:48,781
So...

441
00:20:48,782 --> 00:20:52,051
This is it, the big internet start-up.

442
00:20:52,052 --> 00:20:53,753
Yes, and for your information,

443
00:20:53,754 --> 00:20:57,288
as soon as we put up the site,
they started selling like crazy.

444
00:20:57,991 --> 00:20:59,392
Over 200 of 'em.

445
00:20:59,393 --> 00:21:02,073
Well, I stand corrected. Good for you.

446
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:05,665
So how exactly does this
exercise equipment work?

447
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:08,301
Uh uh well, it kind of incorporates pilates

448
00:21:08,302 --> 00:21:10,169
and stretching.

449
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:13,084
It's really more for serious athletes.

450
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,975
That might be another order.
I should get that.

451
00:21:15,976 --> 00:21:18,311
But could you take Benjamin
to go get some lunch?

452
00:21:18,312 --> 00:21:20,413
Of course. Benjy.

453
00:21:25,786 --> 00:21:27,286
Hello. X-stasy sex swing.

454
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:29,922
We put the swing back in your sex life.

455
00:21:29,923 --> 00:21:32,191
Yes, it can support up to 300 pounds.

456
00:21:32,192 --> 00:21:33,926
And we guarantee maximum pleasure

457
00:21:33,927 --> 00:21:36,429
for you and your partner.

458
00:21:38,906 --> 00:21:40,220
Ready?

459
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,875
Is this for me?

460
00:21:43,876 --> 00:21:45,637
Unless you know another Penny Scavo

461
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:48,377
with an incredibly generous mom.

462
00:21:49,029 --> 00:21:51,948
- Look, it even has a camera.
- Cool!

463
00:21:52,278 --> 00:21:53,885
But my birthday was last month.

464
00:21:53,886 --> 00:21:57,044
I know, but this way,
when you're at your dad's,

465
00:21:57,045 --> 00:21:58,567
we can video chat,

466
00:21:58,568 --> 00:22:00,910
like, when you need help with homework

467
00:22:00,911 --> 00:22:02,676
or you've been having trouble with math.

468
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,108
No, I haven't.

469
00:22:04,109 --> 00:22:06,840
Well, you might. So... bring it.

470
00:22:07,112 --> 00:22:08,365
Okay?

471
00:22:15,685 --> 00:22:18,312
Hey, sweetie. Long time no see.

472
00:22:18,703 --> 00:22:21,012
Mom, you just dropped me off..

473
00:22:21,013 --> 00:22:23,000
Really? It feels like forever.

474
00:22:23,001 --> 00:22:25,799
The gum you gave me in
the car still has flavor.

475
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,424
Well, I miss you.

476
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:29,441
Actually, since you called,

477
00:22:29,913 --> 00:22:31,998
we're multiplying mixed fractions,
and I'm kind of...

478
00:22:31,998 --> 00:22:33,701
I know what you mean.
Can you move your head?

479
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:36,572
Uh, sure.

480
00:22:37,044 --> 00:22:39,082
So do I need a common denominator?

481
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:40,562
Honey, the sun's creating a glare.

482
00:22:40,563 --> 00:22:43,420
Would you mind turning
your screen just a scooch?

483
00:22:43,421 --> 00:22:44,825
Okay.

484
00:22:46,957 --> 00:22:49,023
Dad's new place looks nice.

485
00:22:49,024 --> 00:22:50,171
Yeah, it is.

486
00:22:50,172 --> 00:22:52,961
Hey! You know what might be fun?

487
00:22:52,962 --> 00:22:54,459
Why don't you give me a tour?

488
00:22:55,271 --> 00:22:58,622
Just turn your tablet
around and scan the room.

489
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:04,017
Oh, big-screen TV.

490
00:23:04,018 --> 00:23:06,978
There's a 9.0 on the predictability scale.

491
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:11,495
Empty pizza box, dirty plate, dirty glass.

492
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:14,324
It's nice he's kept
the same decorating scheme.

493
00:23:14,325 --> 00:23:16,020
My arms are getting tired.

494
00:23:16,021 --> 00:23:19,081
Little longer. Think light thoughts.

495
00:23:19,432 --> 00:23:20,895
Stop. Go back.

496
00:23:20,896 --> 00:23:25,131
I want to see your dad's
new lovely... curtains.

497
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:28,056
Wow.

498
00:23:29,123 --> 00:23:30,556
They're nice.

499
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:32,908
But they seem a little young for him.

500
00:23:35,487 --> 00:23:36,871
Who is that?

501
00:23:36,872 --> 00:23:38,175
That's Chloe.

502
00:23:38,176 --> 00:23:41,287
She lives in the building.
She's really nice.

503
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,905
Apparently.

504
00:23:45,271 --> 00:23:48,461
So... is Chloe around a lot?

505
00:23:48,862 --> 00:23:49,965
Sometimes.

506
00:23:49,966 --> 00:23:52,017
She teaches a Booty Burn Ballet class,

507
00:23:52,018 --> 00:23:54,325
so she's mostly at the fitness center.

508
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:57,669
Hey, Mom. Dad's got black toilets.

509
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:58,907
You wanna see them?

510
00:23:58,908 --> 00:24:01,731
No, thanks. I've seen enough.

511
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:04,051
Okay. So when I multiply these fractions...

512
00:24:04,052 --> 00:24:06,322
Okay, sweetie, I love you.

513
00:24:12,393 --> 00:24:15,102
- Oh, that's different.
- Mm-hmm.

514
00:24:15,103 --> 00:24:16,770
What does this mean to you?

515
00:24:16,771 --> 00:24:20,425
Loneliness, isolation,

516
00:24:20,508 --> 00:24:24,712
not long ago, this tree
was lush and green,

517
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:27,399
but now it's, uh, lost its leaves,

518
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,818
and winter's ahead.

519
00:24:31,145 --> 00:24:33,902
And it's just doing
what it can to survive.

520
00:24:37,506 --> 00:24:40,103
So let me guess... you're the tree.

521
00:24:44,322 --> 00:24:45,512
Oh, okay.

522
00:24:45,513 --> 00:24:48,825
You're... mocking me again.

523
00:24:48,826 --> 00:24:49,602
Well, good-bye.

524
00:24:49,603 --> 00:24:51,821
Hold on. We're having
an artistic dialogue here.

525
00:24:52,823 --> 00:24:54,800
I bet your night went
something like this...

526
00:24:54,801 --> 00:24:56,288
You went home and asked yourself,

527
00:24:56,289 --> 00:24:59,974
"How do I prove to Andre
Zeller that I'm deep?"

528
00:25:00,846 --> 00:25:02,848
So you dug down through the cupcakes

529
00:25:02,849 --> 00:25:03,995
and the throw pillows

530
00:25:03,996 --> 00:25:07,989
and the once-a-week sex of
your life to your very core,

531
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:10,533
and you found this sad little tree.

532
00:25:11,516 --> 00:25:13,169
"And it's so profound"

533
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:15,388
"because the tree's lonely, just like I am"

534
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:17,466
"now that 'oprah's' off the air."

535
00:25:20,718 --> 00:25:21,863
How dare you.

536
00:25:22,595 --> 00:25:24,429
You don't know anything about me.

537
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:26,859
What's to know? You're shallow,

538
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,698
and your work is shallow, and god bless,

539
00:25:28,699 --> 00:25:31,154
because if I had your life,
I'd be painting bunnies, too.

540
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:32,846
You want everything to be nice and pretty.

541
00:25:32,847 --> 00:25:34,793
You're afraid of ugly.

542
00:25:35,506 --> 00:25:37,494
You-you think I'm afraid of ugly?

543
00:25:41,979 --> 00:25:43,505
You want ugly?

544
00:25:44,499 --> 00:25:45,832
There.

545
00:25:45,833 --> 00:25:47,847
There's some ugly for you.

546
00:25:47,848 --> 00:25:49,544
You want passion?

547
00:25:50,339 --> 00:25:51,913
Well, here you go. There's passion.

548
00:25:51,914 --> 00:25:53,660
Passion all over the place.

549
00:25:54,663 --> 00:25:57,081
You know, I am not some
shallow soccer mom.

550
00:25:57,082 --> 00:25:58,851
I have done things that you can't believe.

551
00:25:58,852 --> 00:26:00,699
I have anger!

552
00:26:01,373 --> 00:26:02,946
And I have pain!

553
00:26:05,626 --> 00:26:07,825
I have secrets in me that I wish...

554
00:26:08,518 --> 00:26:10,955
I could get rid of, and I can't!

555
00:26:14,549 --> 00:26:17,717
It's fine. You know, you...
you've made your mind up about me.

556
00:26:17,718 --> 00:26:21,140
So screw your class, screw your medium.

557
00:26:21,499 --> 00:26:23,186
Screw you!

558
00:27:01,502 --> 00:27:02,957
Ah, there you are.

559
00:27:02,958 --> 00:27:05,369
Hey, do you have a recipe for...

560
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:08,882
Oh. Congratulations.

561
00:27:09,624 --> 00:27:10,420
For what?

562
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:13,379
Well, I didn't know you and
Chuck were back together.

563
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,767
We're not.

564
00:27:15,048 --> 00:27:18,212
Well, then why are you
wearing a sex swing?

565
00:27:18,493 --> 00:27:19,828
A what?

566
00:27:21,725 --> 00:27:24,600
Oh, no. This is, uh,
Danielle's new business.

567
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:28,002
She's making exercise equipment.

568
00:27:28,003 --> 00:27:29,347
Uh, yeah,

569
00:27:29,348 --> 00:27:33,638
for a very specific kind of exercise.

570
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,577
Sex swing?

571
00:27:39,237 --> 00:27:41,557
I've never even heard of such a thing.

572
00:27:47,447 --> 00:27:50,177
Now don't try this one
if you get dizzy easily.

573
00:27:50,358 --> 00:27:51,472
Mom?

574
00:27:51,843 --> 00:27:54,102
Exercise equipment?

575
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:57,554
When I get out of this,
you are in so much trouble!

576
00:27:57,873 --> 00:27:59,711
I'll write you a check later.

577
00:28:00,544 --> 00:28:02,394
A sex swing in my test kitchen?

578
00:28:02,395 --> 00:28:06,009
Do you realize I used to make
people wear hairnets in here?

579
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,641
Danielle, I am very disappointed in you.

580
00:28:09,642 --> 00:28:11,259
Gosh, where have I heard that before?

581
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:14,088
Oh, don't you try to
turn this around on me!

582
00:28:14,089 --> 00:28:15,825
For the first time in my life,

583
00:28:15,826 --> 00:28:19,128
I found something that
I'm good at and that's successful,

584
00:28:19,129 --> 00:28:21,195
and that's still not good enough for you!

585
00:28:21,917 --> 00:28:24,226
You just live to judge me.

586
00:28:25,211 --> 00:28:26,273
Danielle.

587
00:28:26,274 --> 00:28:28,089
Danielle, where are you going?!

588
00:28:30,829 --> 00:28:33,317
No, I'm telling you. It was bad.

589
00:28:33,728 --> 00:28:35,626
Andre probably called the looney bin,

590
00:28:35,627 --> 00:28:38,377
and they're on their way here
right now with a butterfly net.

591
00:28:38,378 --> 00:28:39,661
It's okay, babe.

592
00:28:39,662 --> 00:28:42,840
No, it's not. I just ran out of there.

593
00:28:42,841 --> 00:28:45,349
I-I-I forgot my portfolio.

594
00:28:46,031 --> 00:28:48,232
I don't know what the hell came over me.

595
00:28:49,204 --> 00:28:50,508
Susan...

596
00:28:51,201 --> 00:28:52,602
I know how badly you want

597
00:28:52,603 --> 00:28:54,588
what happened in the woods to go away,

598
00:28:54,837 --> 00:28:56,856
but I have to tell you the truth.

599
00:28:57,239 --> 00:28:58,773
It's not going to.

600
00:28:59,103 --> 00:29:00,639
It's part of you.

601
00:29:01,461 --> 00:29:03,716
No. N... mnh.

602
00:29:04,099 --> 00:29:05,913
I-I don't want it to be.

603
00:29:05,914 --> 00:29:07,165
I don't want it to be either,

604
00:29:07,166 --> 00:29:09,933
just like I don't want
my dark stuff to be part of me,

605
00:29:09,934 --> 00:29:11,490
but it is.

606
00:29:12,354 --> 00:29:15,091
Mike, please. Please stop saying this.

607
00:29:15,092 --> 00:29:16,818
I'm trying to protect you.

608
00:29:19,027 --> 00:29:22,850
If you can accept this as part of you,

609
00:29:23,987 --> 00:29:26,064
maybe you can figure out
how to live with it.

610
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:29,364
But if you don't,

611
00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:33,468
that's when it jumps out without warning.

612
00:29:35,405 --> 00:29:36,901
And trust me,

613
00:29:38,357 --> 00:29:40,273
that's a bad way to live.

614
00:29:47,629 --> 00:29:48,663
So...

615
00:29:49,636 --> 00:29:52,455
things are never gonna
be the way they were?

616
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,174
Things...

617
00:29:55,175 --> 00:29:57,080
are how they are.

618
00:30:02,833 --> 00:30:03,870
You okay?

619
00:30:04,266 --> 00:30:06,224
Mommy, will you check my math worksheet?

620
00:30:06,225 --> 00:30:07,724
It's really hard.

621
00:30:10,448 --> 00:30:12,092
Sure. Sure, honey.

622
00:30:30,198 --> 00:30:31,840
In case you're wondering how I got here,

623
00:30:31,841 --> 00:30:35,133
the U.P.S. man heard
my cries and cut me down.

624
00:30:35,308 --> 00:30:37,752
Suffice it to say, we're FedEx people now.

625
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,835
Look, I know you think
that I am judgmental.

626
00:30:42,267 --> 00:30:43,263
Think?

627
00:30:43,468 --> 00:30:45,422
"Danielle, you should've gone to college."

628
00:30:45,423 --> 00:30:47,676
"Danielle, you dress like a streetwalker."

629
00:30:47,677 --> 00:30:50,664
"Danielle, I knew
your marriage wouldn't last."

630
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:52,263
Yeah, a little bit.

631
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:55,458
What I was going to say is you're right.

632
00:30:57,106 --> 00:30:58,521
Why are you admitting this?

633
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,586
Because I thought about what you said,

634
00:31:00,587 --> 00:31:02,732
and I realize I am far from perfect.

635
00:31:02,733 --> 00:31:05,088
I have no right to be so critical.

636
00:31:05,923 --> 00:31:07,713
Okay, now you're freaking me out.

637
00:31:08,278 --> 00:31:09,756
Did something happen?

638
00:31:11,648 --> 00:31:15,196
Just know that a certain recent... event

639
00:31:15,272 --> 00:31:18,744
made me aware that I am
in no position to judge you

640
00:31:18,962 --> 00:31:20,519
or anyone else.

641
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,758
What are you talking about?

642
00:31:24,685 --> 00:31:25,356
It doesn't matter.

643
00:31:25,357 --> 00:31:26,597
The point is...

644
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,511
can you forgive me?

645
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,424
Wow.

646
00:31:34,594 --> 00:31:36,844
That's, like, the first
time you've ever said that.

647
00:31:39,122 --> 00:31:41,180
Thank you. And...

648
00:31:41,706 --> 00:31:43,640
yes, I forgive you.

649
00:31:44,508 --> 00:31:47,033
And to prove that I am sincere,

650
00:31:47,034 --> 00:31:48,881
I would like to invest in your business

651
00:31:48,882 --> 00:31:50,036
and support you in making

652
00:31:50,037 --> 00:31:54,544
those disgusting-ly happy swings.

653
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:56,866
You mean like a silent partner?

654
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:58,969
A silent, invisible,

655
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:01,518
and completely untraceable partner

656
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:05,127
who supports you from far, far away.

657
00:32:06,717 --> 00:32:08,137
I love you, sweetie.

658
00:32:08,777 --> 00:32:10,159
I love you, too.

659
00:32:14,237 --> 00:32:16,535
Now... go pack up your sex factory,

660
00:32:16,536 --> 00:32:18,669
and I will bake us some cookies.

661
00:32:24,632 --> 00:32:27,333
You're about to paint
a hundred bad paintings,

662
00:32:27,517 --> 00:32:28,789
so let's get those out of the way

663
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:31,487
so you can start painting the good ones.

664
00:32:33,933 --> 00:32:35,080
What are you doing?

665
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:38,086
Uh, I forgot my portfolio.

666
00:32:39,483 --> 00:32:40,509
Sit down.

667
00:32:41,179 --> 00:32:42,267
Excuse me?

668
00:32:42,775 --> 00:32:44,119
Sit down. You're late.

669
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:50,490
Does that mean you're
letting me join the class?

670
00:32:50,525 --> 00:32:51,692
For now.

671
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:55,452
But that woman who showed up
yesterday... the crazy one...

672
00:32:55,996 --> 00:32:58,004
she better be here every single day.

673
00:33:01,117 --> 00:33:03,000
I-I don't know if I like that woman.

674
00:33:03,001 --> 00:33:04,601
She scares me.

675
00:33:05,694 --> 00:33:06,657
Good.

676
00:33:08,819 --> 00:33:10,915
Okay, I want you to start

677
00:33:10,916 --> 00:33:13,876
by forgetting everything
you heard about brush technique.

678
00:33:13,877 --> 00:33:14,898
I've seen your painting.

679
00:33:14,899 --> 00:33:16,835
Either you heard it wrong,

680
00:33:17,353 --> 00:33:18,761
or it was wrong.

681
00:33:24,691 --> 00:33:26,491
Hey. Are you ready for our walk?

682
00:33:26,492 --> 00:33:27,623
Actually, change of plans.

683
00:33:27,624 --> 00:33:30,105
I thought we'd go to that
booty burn ballet class

684
00:33:30,106 --> 00:33:32,640
- at the fitness center.
- What's going on?

685
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:35,680
Nothing. Can't a woman
just wanna burn her booty?

686
00:33:37,131 --> 00:33:38,874
Fine. I think you're right
about Tom seeing someone.

687
00:33:38,875 --> 00:33:40,809
She's an aerobics teacher.

688
00:33:41,475 --> 00:33:44,010
Of course she is. Cliche much?

689
00:33:44,011 --> 00:33:46,469
So I'm thinking,
I'll go to her class, and I'll...

690
00:33:46,823 --> 00:33:48,802
Actually, I-I don't know
what the hell I'm thinking.

691
00:33:48,803 --> 00:33:50,493
You're thinking you
wanna spy on this woman

692
00:33:50,494 --> 00:33:52,711
and see what she's like,
then key her car on the way out.

693
00:33:52,712 --> 00:33:54,462
It's perfectly natural.

694
00:33:54,463 --> 00:33:56,651
So I'm not crazy?
I shouldn't just be direct

695
00:33:56,652 --> 00:33:58,549
and ask Tom if he's seeing someone?

696
00:33:58,550 --> 00:33:59,881
Why? So he can lie to you

697
00:33:59,882 --> 00:34:01,966
through his unnaturally white teeth?

698
00:34:02,572 --> 00:34:03,711
Okay, then.

699
00:34:03,883 --> 00:34:04,806
I guess we're going.

700
00:34:04,807 --> 00:34:07,488
Yeah. Uh, booty burn ballet...

701
00:34:07,489 --> 00:34:08,669
think we can do this?

702
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,686
Oh, please. How hard can it be?

703
00:34:12,514 --> 00:34:14,657
Am I the only one about to pass out?

704
00:34:14,658 --> 00:34:17,447
No. I keep seeing my dead grandfather

705
00:34:17,448 --> 00:34:18,272
at the end of the tunnel,

706
00:34:18,273 --> 00:34:21,126
saying "Come toward the light."

707
00:34:21,158 --> 00:34:24,967
Keep going, ladies.
Keep your eyes on the thighs!

708
00:34:24,968 --> 00:34:27,511
Did she just use a civil
rights rallying cry

709
00:34:27,512 --> 00:34:29,802
to get us to lose ass fat?

710
00:34:30,103 --> 00:34:31,314
First time, huh?

711
00:34:31,315 --> 00:34:33,516
Oh, what gave me away?

712
00:34:33,582 --> 00:34:36,156
The fact that this was
light blue when I came in?

713
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:38,073
Well, the good news is

714
00:34:38,074 --> 00:34:40,380
if you have a heart attack, I'm a doctor.

715
00:34:40,381 --> 00:34:43,249
The bad news is if you have one, I'm not.

716
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,784
Okay, so if I die,

717
00:34:46,049 --> 00:34:48,269
please put me ass up in the coffin.

718
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:50,737
I'd hate for all this work to go to waste.

719
00:34:51,501 --> 00:34:52,931
On your feet, ladies.

720
00:34:53,689 --> 00:34:56,188
Okay, we've checked out the competition.

721
00:34:56,189 --> 00:34:57,366
Can we go now?

722
00:34:57,367 --> 00:34:58,450
No.

723
00:34:58,547 --> 00:34:59,986
I want to talk to her.

724
00:34:59,987 --> 00:35:01,588
Okay, everybody,

725
00:35:01,615 --> 00:35:03,745
time to work those quads.

726
00:35:05,395 --> 00:35:07,769
I don't know who I hate
more right now... you or her.

727
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:09,114
50 lunges!

728
00:35:09,115 --> 00:35:11,719
Jump towards your skinny, skinny future.

729
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,502
And we have a winner.

730
00:35:19,285 --> 00:35:20,487
Hi. It's Mrs. Solis.

731
00:35:20,488 --> 00:35:22,551
Can you tell Sean I'm running
about 20 minutes late

732
00:35:22,552 --> 00:35:24,707
for my brow-waxing appointment?

733
00:35:26,198 --> 00:35:28,361
What? You can't hold it for me?

734
00:35:28,362 --> 00:35:30,850
But I've got caterpillars over my eyes.

735
00:35:32,331 --> 00:35:34,142
Fine. I'll be there in five minutes.

736
00:35:34,143 --> 00:35:36,489
Juanita, get back in the car.

737
00:35:37,618 --> 00:35:39,546
We're going drop-off.

738
00:35:48,577 --> 00:35:50,509
Gaby, what are you doin'?

739
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:52,800
You can't be in the carpool
lane without a placard.

740
00:35:52,801 --> 00:35:55,642
Don't give a crap. It's time
somebody taught Dana a lesson.

741
00:35:55,643 --> 00:35:58,224
We need to break
the back of our oppressor.

742
00:36:07,436 --> 00:36:09,232
Mobilize the cones!

743
00:36:15,534 --> 00:36:18,525
Get out, sweetie. Go. Go. Go, go, go!

744
00:36:31,986 --> 00:36:34,203
I'm never gonna get that eyebrow wax.

745
00:36:41,156 --> 00:36:44,617
Again, Dana, I am so sorry.

746
00:36:44,623 --> 00:36:48,092
On the upside, that cast is so slimming.

747
00:36:48,299 --> 00:36:50,031
It's like a hard spanx.

748
00:36:50,857 --> 00:36:54,025
Gaby, there's a reason I asked to see you.

749
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:56,453
You wanted to give me my placard back.

750
00:36:57,216 --> 00:37:00,427
No. Could you hand me those painkillers?

751
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,088
I just wanted to bring you up to date

752
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:06,239
on some school-related news.

753
00:37:06,605 --> 00:37:07,620
Given my condition,

754
00:37:07,621 --> 00:37:09,932
they've informed me
that I'm no longer able

755
00:37:09,933 --> 00:37:12,543
to carry out my duties
as P.T.A. president.

756
00:37:13,451 --> 00:37:14,892
That's a bummer.

757
00:37:15,096 --> 00:37:16,855
Yes, it is.

758
00:37:18,609 --> 00:37:22,122
The bylaws state I'm to
appoint an acting president,

759
00:37:22,123 --> 00:37:23,692
and I've made my decision.

760
00:37:25,587 --> 00:37:26,639
Me?

761
00:37:27,842 --> 00:37:29,231
Wait. You hate me.

762
00:37:29,422 --> 00:37:30,392
Very perceptive.

763
00:37:30,393 --> 00:37:32,711
That'll serve you well
as P.T.A. president.

764
00:37:33,738 --> 00:37:35,490
W... okay, wait.

765
00:37:35,491 --> 00:37:37,141
Why are you doing this?

766
00:37:37,518 --> 00:37:40,461
Let me tell you what I was
like before I took this job.

767
00:37:40,462 --> 00:37:41,759
I was fun.

768
00:37:41,923 --> 00:37:43,681
I drank at school functions.

769
00:37:43,682 --> 00:37:45,917
My boob fell out at the holiday party.

770
00:37:46,177 --> 00:37:48,065
I still had a husband.

771
00:37:49,372 --> 00:37:51,072
So what turned you into this?

772
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:53,210
The job did. Mm-hmm.

773
00:37:53,211 --> 00:37:55,696
And it's gonna do the same to you.

774
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:57,342
Yeah, no time for manicures

775
00:37:57,343 --> 00:38:00,260
'cause you'll be planning the winter gala.

776
00:38:01,043 --> 00:38:02,459
No more seeing your husband

777
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,875
because you'll be
organizing the bake sale.

778
00:38:04,876 --> 00:38:06,162
And no more friends,

779
00:38:06,163 --> 00:38:09,298
because you'll always be
hitting them up for something.

780
00:38:10,919 --> 00:38:13,455
Well, as attractive as your
little revenge fantasy sounds,

781
00:38:13,456 --> 00:38:14,785
I'm gonna pass.

782
00:38:14,786 --> 00:38:18,648
Then I guess I'm gonna have
to go ahead and press charges.

783
00:38:19,905 --> 00:38:22,293
What are you talking about?
It was an accident.

784
00:38:22,869 --> 00:38:24,468
I have witnesses

785
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:27,822
who heard you say you were
going to break my back.

786
00:38:28,203 --> 00:38:30,893
And I do have a broken back.

787
00:38:39,357 --> 00:38:41,026
So the winter gala...

788
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,550
it's in the winter, right?

789
00:38:46,076 --> 00:38:47,582
That's interesting. Interesting.

790
00:38:47,583 --> 00:38:49,662
So really, you have three careers.

791
00:38:49,663 --> 00:38:52,334
You're a aerobics instructor,
aromatherapist,

792
00:38:52,335 --> 00:38:54,232
and a lingerie model.

793
00:38:54,233 --> 00:38:57,587
Well, lingerie modeling is
more of a hobby than a career.

794
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:59,432
Oh. But when god gives you these...

795
00:39:00,026 --> 00:39:00,808
Right.

796
00:39:00,809 --> 00:39:02,826
Are you sure god gave you those?

797
00:39:03,932 --> 00:39:04,638
I'm just kidding.

798
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:06,914
I'm just kidding.
It's nice talking to you, Chloe.

799
00:39:07,842 --> 00:39:08,474
Ready to go?

800
00:39:08,475 --> 00:39:09,467
Yes.

801
00:39:09,468 --> 00:39:09,981
So?

802
00:39:09,982 --> 00:39:13,138
Well, obviously, I'm not thrilled.
Look at her.

803
00:39:13,139 --> 00:39:14,591
But it could be worse.

804
00:39:15,074 --> 00:39:15,899
How?

805
00:39:16,094 --> 00:39:17,114
She could look like that

806
00:39:17,115 --> 00:39:19,565
and have a single thought in her head.

807
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:21,519
I mean, there's no way Tom's
ever gonna get serious

808
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,866
about a woman like that, right?

809
00:39:22,867 --> 00:39:25,578
- Yeah. She's just a fling.
- Mm.

810
00:39:25,579 --> 00:39:27,105
A palate cleanser.

811
00:39:27,106 --> 00:39:29,428
The sorbet you eat between courses.

812
00:39:29,469 --> 00:39:31,475
I'm really sorry I said that.

813
00:39:32,113 --> 00:39:34,478
I give the whole thing three weeks.

814
00:39:34,723 --> 00:39:35,772
Lynette?

815
00:39:38,049 --> 00:39:42,693
Hey! Tom. What's-what's going on?

816
00:39:43,185 --> 00:39:44,936
- I'll meet you at the car.
- Okay.

817
00:39:46,928 --> 00:39:48,570
Wh-what are you doing here?

818
00:39:50,867 --> 00:39:51,960
I know.

819
00:39:52,882 --> 00:39:53,873
Know what?

820
00:39:54,985 --> 00:39:55,914
Wh...

821
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:58,811
Okay.

822
00:39:59,416 --> 00:40:01,665
We just had dinner a couple of times.

823
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:03,382
There's nothing going on.

824
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:06,390
Whatever.

825
00:40:08,455 --> 00:40:11,548
So this is how you're gonna be
spending your free time now,

826
00:40:11,549 --> 00:40:12,925
spying on me?

827
00:40:12,926 --> 00:40:14,598
Well, that's a brilliant strategy, Tom.

828
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:15,744
Act like I'm the one in the wrong.

829
00:40:15,745 --> 00:40:18,072
You're the one dating the underwear model.

830
00:40:18,073 --> 00:40:19,884
What are you talking about?

831
00:40:23,269 --> 00:40:25,273
Chloe? I'm not dating Chloe.

832
00:40:25,274 --> 00:40:27,727
Jeez, Lynette, give me a little credit.

833
00:40:27,728 --> 00:40:30,210
Then you have you been having
dinner with? Why are you here?

834
00:40:30,211 --> 00:40:33,453
I am picking up Jane, Chloe's mom.

835
00:40:40,322 --> 00:40:43,694
Like I said, it's just
a couple of dinners and coffee.

836
00:40:44,087 --> 00:40:45,569
Oh, it's coffee now?

837
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:48,122
God, Tom, when were you
gonna tell me this?

838
00:40:48,605 --> 00:40:51,172
Thursday, in counseling.

839
00:40:54,054 --> 00:40:55,148
You ready to go?

840
00:40:55,618 --> 00:40:56,664
Yeah.

841
00:40:57,996 --> 00:41:00,166
Lynette, we'll talk about
this thursday, right?

842
00:41:00,765 --> 00:41:02,106
What's the point?

843
00:41:05,784 --> 00:41:10,326
<i>Yes, we often learn
our most important lessons</i>

844
00:41:10,327 --> 00:41:12,573
<i>outside the classroom...</i>

845
00:41:15,028 --> 00:41:19,121
<i>The painful truth about
the state of a relationship...</i>

846
00:41:21,699 --> 00:41:25,497
<i>the ugly cost of challenging authority...</i>

847
00:41:27,185 --> 00:41:31,878
<i>the sad fact that life's
colors aren't always rosy...</i>

848
00:41:34,317 --> 00:41:35,588
<i>Then there are those</i>

849
00:41:35,589 --> 00:41:39,603
<i>who refuse to accept
these important lessons.</i>

850
00:41:40,366 --> 00:41:43,095
<i>They simply wait for the chance</i>

851
00:41:43,096 --> 00:41:46,320
<i>to teach a lesson of their own.</i>

852
00:41:49,748 --> 00:41:52,019
Don't tell me you're still
stewing about that redhead.

853
00:41:53,704 --> 00:41:55,524
Well, I'm not a big fan of getting led on

854
00:41:55,525 --> 00:41:58,794
and humiliated, so, yeah, I'm not...

855
00:41:59,302 --> 00:42:01,185
Don't think I'm letting
go of this one yet.

856
00:42:01,186 --> 00:42:02,439
Suit yourself.

857
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:05,446
I got some missing person
reports here for you.

858
00:42:06,052 --> 00:42:07,892
Just toss 'em over there.
