1
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:03,877
<i>Previously on...</i>

2
00:00:03,878 --> 00:00:05,586
<i>Susan discovered that Porter</i>

3
00:00:05,587 --> 00:00:07,534
<i>was the father of Julie's baby.</i>

4
00:00:07,535 --> 00:00:09,506
No, the father will be an adoptive parent

5
00:00:09,507 --> 00:00:10,798
who has gone through extensive interviews

6
00:00:10,799 --> 00:00:12,764
- and a background check.
- Both of you, stop.

7
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:14,315
I wanna keep it.

8
00:00:14,415 --> 00:00:15,983
<i>Then Lynette found out...</i>

9
00:00:15,984 --> 00:00:18,716
No, no, no! He can't be having a baby!

10
00:00:19,361 --> 00:00:21,050
<i>Gaby took in a houseguest...</i>

11
00:00:21,051 --> 00:00:22,813
Karen kicked me out.

12
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:24,989
<i>And Karen got bad news.</i>

13
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,667
The cancer's back.

14
00:00:27,294 --> 00:00:29,318
<i>Ben's money problems took a toll...</i>

15
00:00:29,319 --> 00:00:30,630
Let's get you to the hospital.

16
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:32,300
<i>And Renee stepped in.</i>

17
00:00:32,301 --> 00:00:34,145
Normally, I'd never take a check,

18
00:00:34,146 --> 00:00:35,442
but I know where you live.

19
00:00:35,443 --> 00:00:36,908
<i>Orson returned...</i>

20
00:00:36,909 --> 00:00:39,942
How would you feel about
a change of scenery... Maine?

21
00:00:40,105 --> 00:00:41,369
<i>With a plan.</i>

22
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,182
You won't believe where
it's going to end up.

23
00:00:50,087 --> 00:00:52,530
<i>When it came to raising her children,</i>

24
00:00:52,531 --> 00:00:56,686
<i>Lynette Scavo was used to
doing things without help.</i>

25
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:01,055
<i>Her husband would often
travel on business...</i>

26
00:01:03,603 --> 00:01:06,499
<i>or rush out to important meetings...</i>

27
00:01:09,143 --> 00:01:12,306
<i>or sneak out for a game of golf.</i>

28
00:01:16,182 --> 00:01:17,425
<i>But just because Lynette</i>

29
00:01:17,426 --> 00:01:20,157
<i>was used to doing everything herself...</i>

30
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,447
You done yet?

31
00:01:23,027 --> 00:01:25,231
Didn't mean she liked it.

32
00:01:26,515 --> 00:01:27,334
Yes, I'm done.

33
00:01:27,335 --> 00:01:29,202
Thank you for your help.

34
00:01:29,606 --> 00:01:32,898
Okay, uh, I wanna thank you
both for joining me.

35
00:01:32,899 --> 00:01:36,034
I know you're worried about
my decision to be a single father.

36
00:01:36,035 --> 00:01:39,854
No, not worried.
More like panicked and terrified.

37
00:01:39,874 --> 00:01:43,041
Well, I'm here to let
you know that as of today,

38
00:01:43,042 --> 00:01:44,718
I've got everything under control.

39
00:01:45,057 --> 00:01:46,239
I got a job.

40
00:01:47,101 --> 00:01:49,478
Just working in a restaurant,
but it's decent pay,

41
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:51,701
and there's health insurance
for me and the baby.

44
00:01:56,527 --> 00:01:57,889
I'm waiting for the "But."

45
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,079
There doesn't have to be a "But."

46
00:02:00,385 --> 00:02:02,290
It's Porter. There's always a "But."

47
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:05,922
But... they don't exactly
provide child care.

48
00:02:05,923 --> 00:02:07,489
At a restaurant? That's so weird.

49
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,102
They usually have a whole play area

50
00:02:09,103 --> 00:02:11,329
between the knife block
and the deep fryer.

51
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,375
So I'll need a little help with the baby.

52
00:02:13,891 --> 00:02:15,310
How much help?

53
00:02:15,555 --> 00:02:18,158
I don't know. Eight hours...

54
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,511
A day... every day until...

55
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,058
She turns 18?

56
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,050
No.

57
00:02:24,051 --> 00:02:27,298
She could be super smart and
end up going to college at 15.

58
00:02:27,299 --> 00:02:30,174
Aw, sweetie, she's not
gonna be super smart.

59
00:02:30,175 --> 00:02:31,229
Lynette.

60
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,701
Porter, I'm sorry.
I am not gonna keep telling you

61
00:02:34,702 --> 00:02:37,218
what a bad idea raising this baby is.

62
00:02:37,219 --> 00:02:39,742
You're a grownup and
you've made your own decision,

63
00:02:39,922 --> 00:02:42,479
and I'm even starting to
make my peace with it.

64
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:43,567
But?

65
00:02:43,603 --> 00:02:46,346
But I can't raise her for you.

66
00:02:46,347 --> 00:02:49,638
- We-we-we can barely take care of this one.
- Yeah.

67
00:02:50,186 --> 00:02:52,732
Wait. Wait. Where-where did she go?

68
00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:53,561
I thought you were watching her.

69
00:02:53,562 --> 00:02:55,718
Well, it's your house.

70
00:02:56,282 --> 00:02:58,774
I'm sorry. You're gonna have
to make other arrangements.

71
00:02:58,775 --> 00:02:59,894
I found her!

72
00:02:59,895 --> 00:03:02,355
Wow. I don't know what I was thinking,

73
00:03:02,534 --> 00:03:04,554
expecting you to care about my baby.

74
00:03:04,555 --> 00:03:06,486
I mean, you're only the grandmother.

75
00:03:10,763 --> 00:03:14,025
I am happy to be her grandmother.

76
00:03:14,026 --> 00:03:16,849
I will fill her room with stuffed animals.

77
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:18,861
I will feed her
ice cream behind your back.

78
00:03:18,862 --> 00:03:20,782
I will spoil her like nobody's business.

79
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:23,642
But when it comes to
the heavy lifting, I am done.

80
00:03:24,527 --> 00:03:26,331
Or will be very shortly.

81
00:03:27,071 --> 00:03:29,290
Okay. I see where you're coming from.

82
00:03:30,095 --> 00:03:31,494
I guess I'll have to find some stranger

83
00:03:31,495 --> 00:03:33,699
to watch over little baby Lynette.

84
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:37,156
Lynette?

85
00:03:37,574 --> 00:03:40,659
You were gonna name
your daughter after me?

86
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,926
That's incredibly touching.

87
00:03:43,963 --> 00:03:45,655
It changes nothing.

88
00:03:46,234 --> 00:03:51,262
<i>Yes, Lynette Scavo had raised
her children without much help...</i>

89
00:03:51,874 --> 00:03:53,526
Here you go. Practice.

90
00:03:53,527 --> 00:03:57,906
<i>And she was determined
that Porter do the same.</i>

91
00:04:10,554 --> 00:04:13,639
<i>Orson Hodge had a plan.</i>

92
00:04:15,892 --> 00:04:20,110
<i>He was determined to reclaim
the heart of a woman...</i>

93
00:04:21,715 --> 00:04:24,926
<i>whose loss he had never gotten over.</i>

94
00:04:26,886 --> 00:04:31,854
<i>He loved her so deeply that
he was willing to be patient...</i>

95
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:37,951
<i>and obsess over every detail</i>

96
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:41,932
<i>until at last, the moment arrived</i>

97
00:04:42,688 --> 00:04:45,515
<i>when she was just within reach.</i>

98
00:04:45,516 --> 00:04:46,809
Okay, open.

99
00:04:48,093 --> 00:04:49,091
What is this?

100
00:04:49,092 --> 00:04:50,365
It's a little book of inspiration

101
00:04:50,366 --> 00:04:52,634
I put together for you.

102
00:04:52,985 --> 00:04:56,133
I wanted to show you some
pictures of my cottage in Maine.

103
00:04:56,649 --> 00:04:59,360
It's right on the coast. Look.
See? There's the lighthouse.

104
00:04:59,361 --> 00:05:02,159
Oh! These photographs are breathtaking.

105
00:05:02,306 --> 00:05:04,014
It's even more beautiful in person,

106
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,606
when you hear the foghorn and you...

107
00:05:06,898 --> 00:05:08,926
you breathe in the sea air.

108
00:05:08,927 --> 00:05:12,058
Oh, I feel it already. Hmm.

109
00:05:12,447 --> 00:05:14,610
Oh, Orson, I can't tell you
how happy this makes me.

110
00:05:14,611 --> 00:05:16,515
This is exactly what I need right now.

111
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:18,179
Absolutely. You deserve a break

112
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,313
after all that ghastly business
you've been through lately.

113
00:05:21,356 --> 00:05:23,524
Yeah, the murder, the investigation,

114
00:05:23,525 --> 00:05:26,194
all those chilling letters you received.

115
00:05:27,701 --> 00:05:28,818
Letters?

116
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:31,075
Yes, the letter
you received after the murder

117
00:05:31,076 --> 00:05:33,360
and the one after Chuck Vance was killed.

118
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:38,001
I never told you about the second letter.

119
00:05:40,948 --> 00:05:43,973
That's right. I heard
about it from Lynette.

120
00:05:43,974 --> 00:05:46,004
You talked to Lynette about the letters?

121
00:05:46,005 --> 00:05:47,479
Yes. The other day,

122
00:05:47,703 --> 00:05:49,777
when she came over with the girls.

123
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,584
Personally, I thought it
was very indiscreet of her,

124
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:54,549
but, well...

125
00:05:55,081 --> 00:05:58,102
Yet another example of how
those women can't be trusted.

126
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:03,713
Oh, let me show you this one.

127
00:06:03,844 --> 00:06:05,088
It's my favorite.

128
00:06:06,197 --> 00:06:08,340
That patch of dirt is your favorite?

129
00:06:08,341 --> 00:06:11,901
Fresh-tilled soil in a raised bed,

130
00:06:11,902 --> 00:06:13,498
overlooking the ocean.

131
00:06:13,629 --> 00:06:15,660
The perfect place for
you to plant a garden.

132
00:06:15,661 --> 00:06:19,336
Oh, Orson, I can't remember
when I've been this excited.

133
00:06:21,453 --> 00:06:24,344
You have truly thought of
everything, haven't you?

134
00:06:25,571 --> 00:06:26,990
Let's hope so, darling.

135
00:06:29,732 --> 00:06:31,744
And our Doppler radar will be tracking

136
00:06:31,745 --> 00:06:33,233
those scattered showers

137
00:06:33,234 --> 00:06:35,485
as they move from eastern Pennsylvania

138
00:06:35,486 --> 00:06:38,146
right into the western Pennsylvania area.

139
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,118
Now when we come...

140
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:42,315
I could hear that at the store!

141
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,405
Oh, no. One of
your girls having a birthday?

142
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:47,533
I can only imagine them on cake.

143
00:06:47,534 --> 00:06:51,393
No. This is for Carlos.
He's coming home Thursday.

144
00:06:51,394 --> 00:06:55,328
You got a bottle of champagne
for a guy getting out of rehab?

145
00:06:55,329 --> 00:06:57,338
What, they were all out of opium?

146
00:06:57,339 --> 00:06:58,669
No, this is for me.

147
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:01,513
This whole rehab thing
has been very stressful.

148
00:07:01,756 --> 00:07:04,852
So this is his big homecoming,

149
00:07:04,853 --> 00:07:06,297
watching you get loaded?

150
00:07:06,428 --> 00:07:07,865
And a balloon.

151
00:07:08,349 --> 00:07:10,937
That guy puts up with a lot from you.

152
00:07:11,869 --> 00:07:13,028
What's that supposed to mean?

153
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:15,305
Why don't you think of
someone other that yourself

154
00:07:15,306 --> 00:07:17,925
just once in your life?

155
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,996
You're right. It's horrible here.

156
00:07:19,997 --> 00:07:21,748
So why don't you just
walk out the front door?

157
00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:24,657
Believe me, I would
if I had anyplace else to go.

158
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:27,178
Well, as the balloon tells us,

159
00:07:27,178 --> 00:07:28,788
Carlos is coming home soon.

160
00:07:28,789 --> 00:07:30,179
So what's your plan?

161
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,205
I thought we'd watch the basketball game,

162
00:07:32,206 --> 00:07:33,825
maybe do a little grilling.

163
00:07:33,826 --> 00:07:36,384
Carlos always liked my tri-tip.

164
00:07:36,385 --> 00:07:39,582
Well, you know who else
likes your tri-tip? Karen.

165
00:07:39,681 --> 00:07:41,230
Yeah, she does.

166
00:07:41,793 --> 00:07:43,758
I'm talking about steak, Roy!

167
00:07:43,842 --> 00:07:45,962
Isn't it time you two patched things up?

168
00:07:45,963 --> 00:07:47,532
Send her some flowers. Make nice.

169
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:49,085
I tried all that.

170
00:07:49,086 --> 00:07:52,088
If she wants me back,
she knows where to find me.

171
00:07:54,221 --> 00:07:55,352
Now after the break,

172
00:07:55,353 --> 00:07:57,596
we'll answer all your burning questions

173
00:07:57,597 --> 00:08:01,306
about barometric pressure,
so make sure you stick around.

174
00:08:01,885 --> 00:08:03,168
How'd it go with Julie?

175
00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:05,143
Made it to the train with time to spare.

176
00:08:05,144 --> 00:08:07,544
I think she was eager
to get back to school.

177
00:08:08,544 --> 00:08:09,900
I was sort of hoping she'd change her mind

178
00:08:09,901 --> 00:08:11,228
and come back with you.

179
00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:13,417
"Guess what, mom? I decided to stay."

180
00:08:13,677 --> 00:08:16,137
Well, give her some time. You never know.

181
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,753
I think I know.

182
00:08:29,325 --> 00:08:31,721
Porter? Is everything okay?

183
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:35,929
No. Everything pretty much sucks.

184
00:08:36,941 --> 00:08:37,780
I thought I had a job,

185
00:08:37,781 --> 00:08:41,041
but my mom says it's not good enough.

186
00:08:41,301 --> 00:08:42,946
So I wrote up a resume.

187
00:08:45,253 --> 00:08:46,881
Well, this looks great.

188
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:49,616
I mean, any boss would
be lucky to have you.

189
00:08:49,734 --> 00:08:52,433
I mean, you're young, energetic.

190
00:08:52,501 --> 00:08:53,836
You had a paper route

191
00:08:53,837 --> 00:08:56,296
and you're "proficient in martial arts",

192
00:08:56,297 --> 00:08:59,397
though not proficient in spelling it.

193
00:09:00,441 --> 00:09:02,981
What was the job that
your mom said wasn't good enough?

194
00:09:03,817 --> 00:09:05,764
Waiting tables at the Carlyle.

195
00:09:06,373 --> 00:09:08,289
I mean, I know it sounds kinda lame,

196
00:09:08,574 --> 00:09:09,884
but it's a stepping-stone.

197
00:09:09,885 --> 00:09:12,713
I'd take classes,
learn about the business...

198
00:09:14,205 --> 00:09:16,121
try to work my way into management.

199
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,790
Or even own my own restaurant,
just like my parents used to.

200
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:22,888
Wow, Porter, that sounds
like an actual plan,

201
00:09:22,889 --> 00:09:23,940
and a good one.

202
00:09:23,977 --> 00:09:26,251
Yeah. There's just one problem.

203
00:09:26,252 --> 00:09:27,545
It doesn't have day care.

204
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:33,112
You should take that job.

205
00:09:34,175 --> 00:09:35,673
What will I do with the baby?

206
00:09:35,997 --> 00:09:38,223
Well, lucky for you,
you happen to be looking

207
00:09:38,224 --> 00:09:41,261
at Fairview's finest day care provider.

208
00:09:43,936 --> 00:09:46,669
Porter, me. I'm the day care.

209
00:09:48,273 --> 00:09:49,639
When the baby is born,

210
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,376
you just drop her off
with me whenever you need.

211
00:09:52,377 --> 00:09:54,076
I will spoil the heck out of her.

212
00:09:54,077 --> 00:09:56,616
You don't mind being stuck
with a baby all day?

213
00:09:56,617 --> 00:09:59,349
It's a baby. Who could be stuck?

214
00:09:59,909 --> 00:10:01,088
My mother, for one.

215
00:10:01,285 --> 00:10:03,406
Well, for me, it's a dream come true.

216
00:10:03,407 --> 00:10:06,379
Honestly, you would be doing me a favor.

217
00:10:08,319 --> 00:10:10,272
Thank you, Mrs. Delfino.

218
00:10:10,273 --> 00:10:13,407
Oh, you know what? You're gonna
be raising my daughter's child.

219
00:10:13,408 --> 00:10:15,981
I think it's about time
you started calling me "Susan".

220
00:10:16,544 --> 00:10:18,334
Or better yet, "grandma".

221
00:10:19,057 --> 00:10:20,284
No. Susan.

222
00:10:37,915 --> 00:10:39,373
Son of a bitch!

223
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:46,068
What are you doing?

224
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:49,428
I... just noticed you had
some flowers delivered,

225
00:10:49,429 --> 00:10:52,161
and I was snooping to
see who they were from.

226
00:10:52,165 --> 00:10:53,729
- You wanna know who?
- No.

227
00:10:54,709 --> 00:10:57,176
They're from Roy! He wants you back!

228
00:10:57,177 --> 00:11:00,389
I just saw you cutting
those roses from Bree's garden.

229
00:11:01,337 --> 00:11:03,744
No, you didn't. You're old.
You can't see anything.

230
00:11:03,745 --> 00:11:05,805
You've got clippers in your pocket.

231
00:11:06,081 --> 00:11:07,888
You have clippers in your pocket!

232
00:11:07,889 --> 00:11:09,160
Your finger's bleeding.

233
00:11:09,161 --> 00:11:10,670
Your finger's bl...

234
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:12,180
All right, can I just come in?

235
00:11:14,104 --> 00:11:15,189
Come on.

236
00:11:16,029 --> 00:11:18,427
Look, Roy may be too proud
to send flowers himself,

237
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:19,929
but he misses you.

238
00:11:20,308 --> 00:11:21,532
Whatever.

239
00:11:21,533 --> 00:11:22,836
Why are you being like this?

240
00:11:22,837 --> 00:11:24,599
Just get over your silly
fight and take him back.

241
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,268
He's crazy about you.

242
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:29,785
Really? Then how come
you're over here and not him?

243
00:11:30,573 --> 00:11:33,033
'Cause I'm kinda to blame for this?

244
00:11:34,348 --> 00:11:36,504
I fed the flames of your little spat

245
00:11:36,505 --> 00:11:38,442
because, let's face it, I'm selfish.

246
00:11:38,443 --> 00:11:40,292
My girls were out of control,

247
00:11:40,293 --> 00:11:43,276
and Roy's a genius at scaring
the crap out of kids.

248
00:11:43,277 --> 00:11:44,563
But now Carlos is coming back,

249
00:11:44,564 --> 00:11:46,833
so I'm all about you two
being lovebirds again.

250
00:11:47,301 --> 00:11:50,129
Save your breath, Gaby.
It's not gonna happen.

251
00:11:50,245 --> 00:11:51,873
What's going on with you two?

252
00:11:52,021 --> 00:11:54,625
You know, none of your damn business!

253
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:57,777
Now take your stolen flowers
and your clippers and...

254
00:11:59,604 --> 00:12:00,914
Karen, what's the matter?

255
00:12:01,285 --> 00:12:02,367
Nothing.

256
00:12:02,368 --> 00:12:05,852
I'm on new medication.
Sometimes I get a little light-headed.

257
00:12:06,194 --> 00:12:07,116
You don't look so good.

258
00:12:07,117 --> 00:12:08,984
I'm-I'm gonna go and lie...

259
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,155
- Lie down.
- Karen!

260
00:12:11,156 --> 00:12:14,328
Karen! Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

261
00:12:14,329 --> 00:12:15,348
Okay.

262
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:19,048
Hi. I need an ambulance right away.

263
00:12:19,049 --> 00:12:21,988
4358 Wisteria Lane.

264
00:12:45,249 --> 00:12:46,381
Hey, guys.

265
00:12:47,105 --> 00:12:48,254
Whatcha doing?

266
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:52,442
I'm helping Mrs. Delfino
paint the nursery.

267
00:12:52,765 --> 00:12:53,866
Nursery?

268
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,505
It's a room where babies live.

269
00:12:55,506 --> 00:12:58,497
Yes, thank you.
Why would Susan need a nursery?

270
00:12:58,498 --> 00:12:59,695
You didn't tell her?

271
00:13:01,074 --> 00:13:02,585
I volunteered to look after the baby

272
00:13:02,586 --> 00:13:05,589
so Porter could start
that new restaurant job.

273
00:13:06,505 --> 00:13:08,852
Yeah. He said you didn't want
to be stuck taking care of her

274
00:13:08,853 --> 00:13:10,371
all the time,

275
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:11,456
and I'm thrilled to do it.

276
00:13:11,606 --> 00:13:15,121
That's... really nice of you.

277
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:17,244
And of course it goes without
saying that you are welcome

278
00:13:17,245 --> 00:13:20,280
to come over and play anytime
with my granddaughter.

279
00:13:22,492 --> 00:13:23,976
Our granddaughter.

280
00:13:23,996 --> 00:13:25,224
Uh, sorry.

281
00:13:26,236 --> 00:13:28,655
Oh, mom. I-I wanted to ask,

282
00:13:28,656 --> 00:13:30,107
can we take the old bassinet?

283
00:13:30,108 --> 00:13:33,036
My bassinet? The one all
five of you kids slept in?

284
00:13:33,037 --> 00:13:35,452
Yeah. That's why I thought it was cool.

285
00:13:35,453 --> 00:13:37,466
Now my kid gets to sleep in it.

286
00:13:39,245 --> 00:13:41,080
Doesn't it make you want to cry?

287
00:13:43,533 --> 00:13:45,753
Yeah. Yeah, it does.

288
00:13:51,733 --> 00:13:52,865
Renee.

289
00:13:53,621 --> 00:13:55,041
What are you doing here?

290
00:13:55,686 --> 00:13:58,081
Learning ten new ways to cook kale.

291
00:13:58,581 --> 00:14:01,521
And letting you know
your financial troubles are over.

292
00:14:02,357 --> 00:14:03,633
What do you mean?

293
00:14:04,676 --> 00:14:06,562
I met with your loan shark...

294
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:08,946
a sentence I never thought I'd be saying...

295
00:14:09,045 --> 00:14:11,266
and I settled your account.

296
00:14:11,605 --> 00:14:14,449
All you have to worry about
now is getting better.

297
00:14:14,694 --> 00:14:16,931
I told you I didn't want you to do that.

298
00:14:16,932 --> 00:14:19,039
I think the words
you're looking for are "Thank you."

299
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,938
I'm serious. I didn't want
you to get involved in this.

300
00:14:21,939 --> 00:14:24,138
Look, if you and I are
gonna keep hanging out,

301
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:26,294
there's something
you need to know about me.

302
00:14:26,554 --> 00:14:27,910
I do what I want.

303
00:14:32,794 --> 00:14:33,925
Thank you.

304
00:14:35,002 --> 00:14:36,224
But I want to be perfectly clear.

305
00:14:36,225 --> 00:14:38,492
I-I will be paying you that money back.

306
00:14:38,493 --> 00:14:39,657
Oh, I know.

307
00:14:40,414 --> 00:14:42,074
And it's probably gonna take a while.

308
00:14:42,221 --> 00:14:43,977
Good thing I'm not going anywhere.

309
00:14:45,053 --> 00:14:46,316
It could be years.

310
00:14:46,317 --> 00:14:50,266
Shh. Just lie there and look pretty.

311
00:14:58,669 --> 00:15:00,873
Uh, come in!

312
00:15:00,949 --> 00:15:02,976
And don't be an ax murderer!

313
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:07,277
Hey, kids, dad's home!

314
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:09,467
What's going on, Tom?
Kinda busy right now.

315
00:15:09,468 --> 00:15:11,815
Actually, that is why I am here.

316
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:13,942
Parker, Penny, you guys around?

317
00:15:14,698 --> 00:15:16,409
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, dad.

318
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:18,535
Go pack your bags.

319
00:15:18,874 --> 00:15:20,560
I've tried that, Tom. They come back.

320
00:15:20,561 --> 00:15:23,138
I figured I'd take 'em off
your hands for the rest of spring break.

321
00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:24,056
Oh, we're going to your place?

322
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:25,008
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!
- Cool!

323
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:26,462
And you already got plenty
of stuff there already,

324
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:28,041
so pack light!

325
00:15:28,042 --> 00:15:30,357
This is actually happening?

326
00:15:30,477 --> 00:15:33,018
You're taking the kids for an entire week?

327
00:15:33,101 --> 00:15:34,771
Well, um, after our talk with Porter,

328
00:15:34,772 --> 00:15:37,468
I got to thinking that you never
really get any time to yourself.

329
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:38,271
And when I was out of town,

330
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:40,077
you had the kids for weeks.

331
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:42,537
So... I owe ya.

332
00:15:44,494 --> 00:15:47,273
If we weren't separated,
the things I'd do to you...

333
00:15:50,269 --> 00:15:52,208
Anyway, uh, thank you.

334
00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:54,409
It'll be much easier getting
things done around here

335
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,841
when it's just me and the baby.

336
00:15:56,842 --> 00:15:58,660
No, no, no. I'm taking Paige, too.

337
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,036
Well, who's gonna watch
her while you're at work?

338
00:16:03,017 --> 00:16:04,021
Jane.

339
00:16:04,744 --> 00:16:06,831
She hasn't taken care
of a baby in forever.

340
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:09,390
She's-she's really looking forward to it.

341
00:16:09,826 --> 00:16:11,708
Okay, that's really generous.

342
00:16:12,193 --> 00:16:15,180
And here comes the herd.

343
00:16:15,564 --> 00:16:16,365
Later, mom.

344
00:16:16,366 --> 00:16:17,929
Wait, wait. Give me a hug.

345
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:19,604
- Bye.
- All right. Love you.

346
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:21,108
Have a good time. I love you.

347
00:16:21,109 --> 00:16:22,605
- Have a good time. Mwah!
- I love you, mom.

348
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:24,010
I love you, too.

349
00:16:28,014 --> 00:16:30,020
So what are you gonna do with
all this time to yourself?

350
00:16:30,021 --> 00:16:32,858
Oh, that is a problem
I look forward to solving.

351
00:16:34,533 --> 00:16:36,928
Bye, Paige. Thank you!

352
00:16:48,516 --> 00:16:50,561
I spoke with your doctor, and I know.

353
00:16:51,653 --> 00:16:52,705
What?

354
00:16:52,756 --> 00:16:55,848
Doctors aren't allowed to talk
about patients' conditions.

355
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:58,132
Well, they can if you're family, mom.

356
00:16:58,264 --> 00:17:00,724
Why didn't you tell
anyone the cancer's back?

357
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:04,485
Because this time, I ain't gonna beat it.

358
00:17:04,696 --> 00:17:06,326
Oh, you don't know that.

359
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:09,300
Yeah, I do.

360
00:17:14,504 --> 00:17:17,093
So this why you've been pushing Roy away.

361
00:17:17,178 --> 00:17:19,621
Look at my smart daughter,
piecing it together.

362
00:17:19,993 --> 00:17:21,480
He doesn't know about any of it?

363
00:17:21,481 --> 00:17:24,357
No, and he's not going to.

364
00:17:24,457 --> 00:17:25,590
But this is a scary thing.

365
00:17:25,591 --> 00:17:27,372
Maybe you should let him help you.

366
00:17:27,373 --> 00:17:29,356
Why, so he can be miserable, too?

367
00:17:29,357 --> 00:17:30,236
Karen!

368
00:17:30,237 --> 00:17:33,384
Roy went through this
when his first wife died.

369
00:17:33,501 --> 00:17:35,497
I'm not putting him through it again.

370
00:17:36,476 --> 00:17:38,698
Gaby, I'm begging you.

371
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:41,961
Don't do this to him.

372
00:17:42,653 --> 00:17:44,281
Just don't tell him.

373
00:17:51,917 --> 00:17:53,388
Oh! You know what we need here?

374
00:17:53,389 --> 00:17:57,753
Over the crib, a mobile with
twinkly little butterflies.

375
00:17:58,013 --> 00:17:59,432
Those were Julie's favorite.

376
00:17:59,433 --> 00:18:02,048
Twinkly butterflies.

377
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:04,929
And, you know, we could
put her name on the wall

378
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:06,814
in big, bright letters.

379
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:08,354
Do you have a name yet?

380
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:10,609
I was actually thinking about "Lynette."

381
00:18:10,914 --> 00:18:12,318
For a baby?

382
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,295
Let me think about that.

383
00:18:15,341 --> 00:18:16,838
Oh! You know what else we could do?

384
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:19,881
A mural. Like, winnie the pooh,

385
00:18:19,882 --> 00:18:22,758
and his head is stuck in the honey pot.

386
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:24,514
I brought you guys some coffee,

387
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:26,556
but it sounds like one
of you doesn't need it.

388
00:18:26,557 --> 00:18:28,154
Oh, I'm not caffeinated.

389
00:18:28,155 --> 00:18:29,593
I'm just high on baby.

390
00:18:30,365 --> 00:18:31,341
Is there any sugar?

391
00:18:31,342 --> 00:18:32,699
Uh, in the kitchen.

392
00:18:35,102 --> 00:18:37,528
That baby is gonna feel
right at home here.

393
00:18:37,529 --> 00:18:40,149
Oh, well, that's why I'm doing this.

394
00:18:40,696 --> 00:18:42,901
Uh-huh. Are you gonna keep Julie's bed?

395
00:18:43,576 --> 00:18:45,944
Well, she was here first.

396
00:18:45,945 --> 00:18:49,576
And besides, I mean,
if she... if she does come back,

397
00:18:49,577 --> 00:18:51,352
she'll need a place to stay.

398
00:18:51,353 --> 00:18:53,676
Right. So when Julie comes to visit,

399
00:18:53,677 --> 00:18:55,259
she'll be sleeping 4 feet away from

400
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,841
the baby she doesn't want.

401
00:18:59,197 --> 00:19:01,017
Think I should move Julie's bed?

402
00:19:01,693 --> 00:19:04,457
I think you should do
whatever makes you happy.

403
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:09,578
Hon, did you find the sugar?

404
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,097
That's what I was looking for.

405
00:19:16,012 --> 00:19:18,217
Lets just hope the baby takes after Julie.

406
00:19:21,932 --> 00:19:24,085
This is the kind of
thing that chaps my ass.

407
00:19:24,086 --> 00:19:25,842
If Marmaduke ate my pillow,

408
00:19:25,842 --> 00:19:27,777
I'd shoot him right in the head.

409
00:19:30,006 --> 00:19:32,263
- Hey, Roy?
- No, Gaby.

410
00:19:32,264 --> 00:19:35,717
I wouldn't actually shoot a dog.
It was a joke.

411
00:19:36,985 --> 00:19:38,662
I just realized the other day,

412
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:42,793
I don't think I've ever heard
you talk about your first wife.

413
00:19:43,036 --> 00:19:44,233
Miriam?

414
00:19:44,621 --> 00:19:45,993
I didn't even know her name.

415
00:19:46,525 --> 00:19:47,689
Miriam.

416
00:19:49,677 --> 00:19:51,096
How long were you guys married?

417
00:19:51,097 --> 00:19:52,394
39 years.

418
00:19:52,395 --> 00:19:55,837
She died 2 weeks before
our 40th anniversary.

419
00:19:55,838 --> 00:20:00,057
Oh, my god. Cancer, right?

420
00:20:00,734 --> 00:20:01,898
Brain.

421
00:20:02,253 --> 00:20:04,400
Son of a bitch, that kind.

422
00:20:04,401 --> 00:20:06,621
A real son of a bitch.

423
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:08,671
That must have been the worst thing

424
00:20:08,671 --> 00:20:10,046
you ever went through.

425
00:20:11,248 --> 00:20:12,398
You'd think.

426
00:20:14,384 --> 00:20:16,094
Wait, are you saying it wasn't?

427
00:20:16,122 --> 00:20:17,782
Sounds weird.

428
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,917
It-it's hard to understand.

429
00:20:24,904 --> 00:20:26,613
I wanna understand.

430
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:27,917
Okay.

431
00:20:29,634 --> 00:20:33,744
When you love somebody,
love them a long time,

432
00:20:33,745 --> 00:20:35,629
you get lazy.

433
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,250
You figure they know it,

434
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:41,858
so you stop saying it so much,
stop showing it.

435
00:20:42,263 --> 00:20:43,110
Yeah.

436
00:20:43,111 --> 00:20:46,194
But when you know you're gonna lose 'em,

437
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:50,082
that they won't be there
to hear you say it...

438
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:53,764
Oh, boy, you make damn sure they know it

439
00:20:53,765 --> 00:20:55,699
every second of every day.

440
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:58,243
I'm so sorry I brought it up.

441
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:00,626
Nah. These?

442
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:05,089
I earned 'em. I was there for Miriam.

443
00:21:06,827 --> 00:21:09,955
I told her everything
I needed to tell her,

444
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:13,166
held her hand when she was scared.

445
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:16,475
Nah, these don't bother me at all.

446
00:21:19,607 --> 00:21:22,939
Oh, Roy. I made a promise to someone,

447
00:21:22,939 --> 00:21:25,377
but I'm gonna have to break it.

448
00:21:31,438 --> 00:21:34,024
Renee. It's so good to see you again.

449
00:21:35,806 --> 00:21:38,170
A loan shark and a Jehovah witness?

450
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:40,333
Not a combo you see often.

451
00:21:42,362 --> 00:21:43,543
What?

452
00:21:43,888 --> 00:21:45,608
I'm kind of embarrassed to admit this,

453
00:21:45,609 --> 00:21:47,318
but I'm a terrible bookkeeper.

454
00:21:48,117 --> 00:21:50,589
The cheque you owe me to pay
off your boyfriend's loan,

455
00:21:50,889 --> 00:21:52,311
I had the amount wrong.

456
00:21:52,841 --> 00:21:54,980
Oh, so you're here to give me a refund?

457
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:56,922
Not exactly.

458
00:21:56,926 --> 00:21:58,868
I really like this house.

459
00:21:58,869 --> 00:22:01,593
Tell me, what does fire insurance cost

460
00:22:01,594 --> 00:22:03,177
for a place like this?

461
00:22:03,301 --> 00:22:06,103
Okay, why don't
you pick up your violin case

462
00:22:06,104 --> 00:22:07,580
and drive your big Cadillac back

463
00:22:07,581 --> 00:22:10,248
to the "Godfather"
movie you crawled out of?

464
00:22:10,249 --> 00:22:12,455
You are not gonna intimidate me.

465
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:14,567
You sure about that?

466
00:22:15,285 --> 00:22:19,142
It's how I make my living,
and business is good.

467
00:22:20,498 --> 00:22:22,463
Ah, I get it.

468
00:22:22,592 --> 00:22:25,084
You see the sweet suburban
neighborhood and think,

469
00:22:25,085 --> 00:22:27,193
"I can push those people around."

470
00:22:27,484 --> 00:22:28,473
Well, let me tell you something.

471
00:22:28,474 --> 00:22:31,326
I do not come from a place like this.

472
00:22:33,668 --> 00:22:36,377
You got all you're gonna get. We're done.

473
00:22:39,832 --> 00:22:42,194
I'm the one that decides when we're done.

474
00:22:45,168 --> 00:22:46,467
See ya around.

475
00:22:54,231 --> 00:22:55,195
Is that everything?

476
00:22:55,196 --> 00:22:58,017
- I think so.
- Have you taken one last look down the lane,

477
00:22:58,018 --> 00:22:59,331
fixed an image in your mind?

478
00:22:59,332 --> 00:23:01,261
Why? We'll only be gone for a month.

479
00:23:01,261 --> 00:23:03,754
Will we? Something tells
me that once you taste

480
00:23:03,755 --> 00:23:05,745
one of those delicious
Maine lobster rolls,

481
00:23:05,746 --> 00:23:07,371
you'll never want to come back.

482
00:23:07,931 --> 00:23:10,004
Aren't we getting ahead of ourselves?

483
00:23:10,217 --> 00:23:12,119
Promise me you'll keep an open mind.

484
00:23:12,288 --> 00:23:15,407
Fine. Mind open.

485
00:23:17,565 --> 00:23:18,474
This is gonna sound silly,

486
00:23:18,475 --> 00:23:21,247
- but you know what I'm most excited about?
- What?

487
00:23:21,248 --> 00:23:23,040
We finally get to wear those hats I bought

488
00:23:23,041 --> 00:23:25,610
for that alaskan cruise
we never got to take.

489
00:23:25,611 --> 00:23:29,076
Jiminy Christmas. I left mine at home.

490
00:23:29,077 --> 00:23:30,300
Orson!

491
00:23:30,645 --> 00:23:31,781
We'll buy another one.

492
00:23:31,782 --> 00:23:34,240
But it won't be the same thing.
I had them monogrammed,

493
00:23:34,241 --> 00:23:36,276
and I always imagined us wearing them

494
00:23:36,277 --> 00:23:39,532
on some wonderful adventure together.

495
00:23:39,594 --> 00:23:40,174
Oh, that's all right.

496
00:23:40,175 --> 00:23:42,921
We'll just stop and get
it from your apartment.

497
00:23:42,951 --> 00:23:44,248
My apartment?

498
00:23:45,068 --> 00:23:46,005
We don't have time for it.

499
00:23:46,006 --> 00:23:47,777
Don't be silly. It's on the way.

500
00:23:47,778 --> 00:23:49,622
And besides, most people
don't get to the airport

501
00:23:49,623 --> 00:23:51,594
four hours before their flight.

502
00:23:51,595 --> 00:23:53,306
No! No, we can't.

503
00:23:54,304 --> 00:23:55,206
Do you know how long it takes

504
00:23:55,207 --> 00:23:57,175
to go through security in a wheelchair?

505
00:23:57,176 --> 00:23:58,619
Certainly not four hours.

506
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,909
Bree, please.

507
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:04,554
Orson, is something wrong?

508
00:24:04,555 --> 00:24:06,295
No. No.

509
00:24:08,482 --> 00:24:09,774
You're trembling.

510
00:24:09,868 --> 00:24:11,778
It's-it's-it's nothing.

511
00:24:12,228 --> 00:24:14,681
It's just, you know me and punctuality.

512
00:24:15,988 --> 00:24:18,422
Well, this is hardly the way to start

513
00:24:18,423 --> 00:24:21,094
that relaxing vacation
you've been promising me.

514
00:24:22,425 --> 00:24:24,971
You're right. I'm sorry, dear.

515
00:24:26,766 --> 00:24:28,200
Apology accepted.

516
00:24:28,707 --> 00:24:29,778
Now let's make that

517
00:24:29,779 --> 00:24:32,346
the last time we quibble on this trip.

518
00:24:35,564 --> 00:24:37,369
Now we're off to your apartment.

519
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,924
- Lynette, Porter's not here.
- No, I know.

520
00:25:19,925 --> 00:25:22,065
I just felt bad you were doing
all the work on the nursery,

521
00:25:22,066 --> 00:25:24,286
so I freed up some time
in my schedule to help.

522
00:25:24,287 --> 00:25:26,990
You know, painting, moving furniture,
whatever you need.

523
00:25:26,991 --> 00:25:29,805
Uh, actually, we already finished.

524
00:25:29,806 --> 00:25:31,872
Oh. Can I see it?

525
00:25:32,169 --> 00:25:34,678
Of course. Uh, sure. Follow me.

526
00:25:36,819 --> 00:25:38,672
I know pink is a little traditional,

527
00:25:38,673 --> 00:25:39,691
but then I found

528
00:25:39,692 --> 00:25:43,485
this black and white bedding
for the bassinet I just love.

529
00:25:43,486 --> 00:25:45,171
Makes it feel like
a little French girl's room,

530
00:25:45,172 --> 00:25:46,357
don't you think?

531
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:48,031
Who's Sophie?

532
00:25:50,607 --> 00:25:54,621
Oh! Uh, that's what Porter
decided to name the baby.

533
00:25:55,041 --> 00:25:55,692
Uh-huh.

534
00:25:55,693 --> 00:25:59,108
Porter decided to name
the baby after your mother?

535
00:26:00,271 --> 00:26:02,616
He did ask me for some suggestions.

536
00:26:02,617 --> 00:26:05,705
Interesting. He told me
he was naming her Lynette.

537
00:26:05,706 --> 00:26:07,740
I know, but...

538
00:26:07,741 --> 00:26:09,394
baby Lynette?

539
00:26:09,959 --> 00:26:10,700
What's wrong with that?

540
00:26:10,701 --> 00:26:14,467
Oh, nothing. It's just, "Lynette" is so...

541
00:26:14,918 --> 00:26:16,076
You.

542
00:26:16,401 --> 00:26:18,335
- Really?
- Well, yeah.

543
00:26:18,336 --> 00:26:22,695
And you have set the bar
so high on that name.

544
00:26:23,027 --> 00:26:24,715
Do you want to burden a tiny little baby

545
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:27,056
with trying to live up to that?

546
00:26:28,961 --> 00:26:30,176
And nobody thought I'd be interested

547
00:26:30,177 --> 00:26:32,379
in hearing about this name change?

548
00:26:33,364 --> 00:26:34,808
Oh, my gosh.

549
00:26:35,228 --> 00:26:36,452
Are you upset about this?

550
00:26:36,453 --> 00:26:41,101
Oh. I thought you were into
being the hands-off grandma.

551
00:26:41,102 --> 00:26:44,404
Well, I'm trying to get my son
to stand on his own two feet,

552
00:26:44,405 --> 00:26:48,459
and I guess I didn't count on
you being the pushy grandma.

553
00:26:49,014 --> 00:26:50,949
I guess your definition of "Pushy"

554
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,939
is being helpful and
wanting to get involved.

555
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:55,171
Oh, I wanna be involved.
It's my granddaughter, too.

556
00:26:55,172 --> 00:26:57,472
Well , I don't see you setting
up a nursery in your house.

557
00:26:57,473 --> 00:27:00,739
Oh, well, maybe I will.
There's just one thing I need.

558
00:27:03,557 --> 00:27:05,343
- Lynette, give that back!
- No.

559
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,618
Porter wants it here.

560
00:27:06,619 --> 00:27:08,020
He says it pulls the whole room together.

561
00:27:08,021 --> 00:27:11,431
Oh, yeah, 'cause Porter has
such a keen eye for design.

562
00:27:11,432 --> 00:27:13,623
What is going on? What's wrong?

563
00:27:13,624 --> 00:27:14,982
What's wrong?

564
00:27:14,983 --> 00:27:16,461
You're calling Lynette "Sophie,"

565
00:27:16,462 --> 00:27:17,939
you're making my son a waiter,

566
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,491
and you're trying to turn my granddaughter

567
00:27:19,492 --> 00:27:21,123
into a French girl. That's what's wrong!

568
00:27:21,124 --> 00:27:23,714
Okay, that doesn't make any sense,

569
00:27:23,715 --> 00:27:24,766
and it's incredibly petty.

570
00:27:24,767 --> 00:27:28,040
Well, not as petty as trying
to steal somebody's grandchild!

571
00:27:37,635 --> 00:27:40,119
My first visit to your apartment.

572
00:27:40,335 --> 00:27:43,253
I must admit, I'm a bit ashamed
I never came by before.

573
00:27:43,254 --> 00:27:44,598
Yes, well, truth be told,

574
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:46,643
I'm a bit ashamed of how modest it is.

575
00:27:46,644 --> 00:27:49,620
So if it's all the same,
I'd prefer it if you wait out here.

576
00:27:49,621 --> 00:27:50,546
I'll just be a minute.

577
00:27:50,547 --> 00:27:51,617
Absolutely not.

578
00:27:51,618 --> 00:27:53,665
I'm sure it's perfectly charming.

579
00:27:54,343 --> 00:27:56,337
Actually, it's also a mess.

580
00:27:56,642 --> 00:27:59,720
There, I said it.
Oh, what you must think of me.

581
00:27:59,721 --> 00:28:00,674
Orson, I know you.

582
00:28:00,675 --> 00:28:02,245
A "Mess" means you haven't

583
00:28:02,246 --> 00:28:04,600
fluffed the sofa pillows today.

584
00:28:04,825 --> 00:28:06,569
Now come on. Let's get you that hat.

585
00:28:09,852 --> 00:28:10,775
Oh, hell's bells.

586
00:28:10,776 --> 00:28:13,453
- What?
- I seem to have forgotten my key.

587
00:28:13,454 --> 00:28:15,472
- Oh, dear.
- Sometimes I think I'd forget my head

588
00:28:15,473 --> 00:28:17,414
if it weren't attached to my body.

589
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:19,883
Of course, then I wouldn't
need to get my hat.

590
00:28:21,289 --> 00:28:22,926
The manager has a master key.

591
00:28:22,927 --> 00:28:25,446
Would you mind running down
to the office to get it?

592
00:28:25,521 --> 00:28:28,137
Of course not. I'll be back in a sec.

593
00:28:51,754 --> 00:28:54,511
Orson? I've looked everywhere
and I can't find the manager.

594
00:28:54,512 --> 00:28:56,503
Don't worry.

595
00:28:56,525 --> 00:28:58,432
I'm such a muddle head.

596
00:28:58,433 --> 00:29:01,875
I forgot that I keep
a spare key in the pouch.

597
00:29:02,411 --> 00:29:03,976
It's one of the good things
about being in a wheelchair.

598
00:29:03,977 --> 00:29:06,291
It's like having a mobile purse.

599
00:29:06,606 --> 00:29:07,938
After you.

600
00:29:12,291 --> 00:29:14,930
What a lovely place.

601
00:29:15,142 --> 00:29:17,467
And, of course, your pillows
are perfectly plumped.

602
00:29:17,468 --> 00:29:19,728
It served its purpose.

603
00:29:19,793 --> 00:29:20,983
And now...

604
00:29:20,984 --> 00:29:23,143
on to new adventures.

605
00:29:29,589 --> 00:29:33,143
- You look very dashing.
- Thank you.

606
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,724
Uh, let's not dillydally.

607
00:29:35,725 --> 00:29:37,650
We-we still have a plane to catch.

608
00:29:40,047 --> 00:29:42,680
Oh, we... and we must stop by
a newsstand in the terminal.

609
00:29:42,681 --> 00:29:45,621
The novel I'm reading is simply dreadful.

610
00:29:47,603 --> 00:29:50,097
Oh, and I know how much
you despise airplane food.

611
00:29:50,098 --> 00:29:53,033
Perhaps we can pick up
a little bite for you as well.

612
00:29:56,488 --> 00:29:57,751
Bree?

613
00:30:04,931 --> 00:30:06,323
It was you?

614
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:10,029
You did it?

615
00:30:11,223 --> 00:30:12,881
You wrote the letters?

616
00:30:16,973 --> 00:30:18,219
Oh, my god.

617
00:30:19,366 --> 00:30:20,802
You killed Chuck.

618
00:30:23,224 --> 00:30:24,516
Yes.

619
00:30:28,378 --> 00:30:29,634
For you.

620
00:30:30,556 --> 00:30:31,893
What?

621
00:30:32,885 --> 00:30:34,475
He was going to arrest you.

622
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,319
I had to do something to stop him.

623
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,866
Everything I did, Bree,
was to protect you.

624
00:30:39,867 --> 00:30:41,262
Protect me?

625
00:30:41,516 --> 00:30:44,193
How was writing the letters
supposed to protect me?

626
00:30:44,194 --> 00:30:46,231
They tormented me,
almost drove me to suicide.

627
00:30:46,232 --> 00:30:48,293
Well, I'm sorry it went that far.

628
00:30:48,804 --> 00:30:51,257
But I knew I had no
chance of winning you back

629
00:30:51,258 --> 00:30:55,042
unless I could isolate you from
those awful friends of yours.

630
00:30:55,043 --> 00:30:56,607
So I wrote the letters

631
00:30:56,608 --> 00:30:58,462
knowing those women
would turn against you,

632
00:30:58,463 --> 00:30:59,319
and they did.

633
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,880
But why would you want
to turn them against me?

634
00:31:00,881 --> 00:31:02,474
Because as long as they were in your life,

635
00:31:02,475 --> 00:31:04,594
I knew I would always be a distant second,

636
00:31:04,595 --> 00:31:07,081
and that wasn't going to
be good enough for me!

637
00:31:07,082 --> 00:31:08,307
Not this time!

638
00:31:08,722 --> 00:31:10,784
I had to have you all to myself.

639
00:31:11,512 --> 00:31:13,004
That's how much I love you.

640
00:31:16,669 --> 00:31:17,951
You're insane.

641
00:31:17,977 --> 00:31:19,078
Bree.

642
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:21,708
Bree, we both know what
it means to commit a crime

643
00:31:21,709 --> 00:31:22,628
for the greater good.

644
00:31:22,629 --> 00:31:24,821
Do not compare yourself to me!

645
00:31:24,865 --> 00:31:26,335
I was protecting people I love.

646
00:31:26,336 --> 00:31:28,493
You were only pursuing
your own selfish desires.

647
00:31:28,494 --> 00:31:30,134
No, I did it for both of us!

648
00:31:30,135 --> 00:31:31,835
You took advantage of me

649
00:31:31,836 --> 00:31:34,346
at the darkest moment of my life.

650
00:31:34,633 --> 00:31:36,979
You're a sick, pathetic man,

651
00:31:37,301 --> 00:31:39,651
and I know that someday
you will pay for your sins.

652
00:31:39,652 --> 00:31:42,221
Bree, don't go! You're everything to me!

653
00:31:42,222 --> 00:31:44,223
Well, you are nothing to me.

654
00:31:44,833 --> 00:31:46,788
And I never wanna see you again.

655
00:32:03,696 --> 00:32:05,081
You mind if I come in?

656
00:32:06,135 --> 00:32:07,606
Sure, but I've already been screamed at

657
00:32:07,607 --> 00:32:09,733
by one Scavo today,

658
00:32:09,734 --> 00:32:11,543
so can we keep it civil?

659
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,512
If this is about Susan,
you can save your breath.

660
00:32:15,513 --> 00:32:16,450
Oh, come on, Lynette.

661
00:32:16,451 --> 00:32:18,175
I know how much you guys
care about each other.

662
00:32:19,341 --> 00:32:21,243
Hey, you wanna have sex with me?

663
00:32:21,244 --> 00:32:22,793
That'd really piss her off.

664
00:32:22,862 --> 00:32:26,744
Uh, I'm going to pass on that, but thanks.

665
00:32:26,879 --> 00:32:28,091
Okay.

666
00:32:29,096 --> 00:32:31,250
I don't understand why she's so mad at me.

667
00:32:31,251 --> 00:32:34,491
She said she wanted nothing
to do with Porter's baby.

668
00:32:34,492 --> 00:32:35,840
Can I tell you a little secret?

669
00:32:35,841 --> 00:32:39,775
That was her first reaction
to all five of our kids.

670
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:41,269
Oh, I don't believe that.

671
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:43,364
I mean, she is a great mom.

672
00:32:43,365 --> 00:32:45,590
None of this makes any sense.

673
00:32:45,975 --> 00:32:47,619
Now we're gettin' somewhere.

674
00:32:48,621 --> 00:32:51,213
I just never thought
my life would end up like this.

675
00:32:51,374 --> 00:32:53,563
It's like I'm turning into white trash.

676
00:32:54,157 --> 00:32:56,048
Lynette, I come from white trash.

677
00:32:56,049 --> 00:32:57,972
You are nowhere near that.

678
00:32:57,973 --> 00:32:59,150
Really?

679
00:32:59,416 --> 00:33:00,656
I'm separated,

680
00:33:00,657 --> 00:33:02,880
my kid is having a baby out of wedlock,

681
00:33:02,881 --> 00:33:04,541
I'm getting into public fights...

682
00:33:04,542 --> 00:33:05,530
I'm two weeks away

683
00:33:05,531 --> 00:33:08,102
from having a washing
machine on the porch.

684
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:11,814
Meanwhile, Susan's getting
everything she wants.

685
00:33:11,848 --> 00:33:13,495
Yeah, I don't think Susan's life

686
00:33:13,496 --> 00:33:15,173
is going the way she'd hoped, either.

687
00:33:15,174 --> 00:33:16,614
All I know is, she's the one over there

688
00:33:16,615 --> 00:33:19,090
painting a nursery for our grandchild.

689
00:33:19,668 --> 00:33:20,816
Yeah...

690
00:33:20,817 --> 00:33:22,076
with your son,

691
00:33:22,718 --> 00:33:24,098
not her daughter.

692
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:26,508
That's the thing about Lynette.

693
00:33:26,509 --> 00:33:29,164
She always complains that
she has to do everything herself.

694
00:33:29,165 --> 00:33:32,561
But god help you if you try
to do anything for her.

695
00:33:32,562 --> 00:33:34,983
I have a bruised tailbone to prove it.

696
00:33:35,066 --> 00:33:37,137
I made the same mistake as you.

697
00:33:37,138 --> 00:33:39,771
And I was married to her. I should know.

698
00:33:40,232 --> 00:33:41,571
What did you do?

699
00:33:41,572 --> 00:33:43,515
I took the kids off her hands for a week.

700
00:33:43,516 --> 00:33:45,442
And she was fine at first.

701
00:33:45,443 --> 00:33:47,670
Then she started calling every ten minutes

702
00:33:47,671 --> 00:33:49,301
to remind me to give Paige her medicine

703
00:33:49,302 --> 00:33:52,372
or to make sure that
Parker wore his retainer.

704
00:33:53,217 --> 00:33:55,551
She needs to be needed.

705
00:33:55,824 --> 00:33:56,709
Exactly.

706
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:58,526
And given what I've been going through,

707
00:33:58,527 --> 00:33:59,786
I kinda get that.

708
00:33:59,993 --> 00:34:01,225
Yeah.

709
00:34:01,417 --> 00:34:05,672
So if you could, Susan, cut her a break.

710
00:34:05,673 --> 00:34:07,340
She's lost a lot.

711
00:34:08,334 --> 00:34:10,430
I don't want her losing you, too.

712
00:34:11,053 --> 00:34:13,090
I think that's why
she's going so overboard

713
00:34:13,091 --> 00:34:14,884
on this nursery thing.

714
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:18,333
She hopes it'll get Julie
excited about the baby,

715
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,101
maybe bring her back.

716
00:34:22,074 --> 00:34:23,765
You know, you're taking all my anger away,

717
00:34:23,766 --> 00:34:27,071
and that's not gonna leave me anything.

718
00:34:27,643 --> 00:34:29,030
Yeah, it will.

719
00:34:29,123 --> 00:34:30,761
It'll leave you your friend.

720
00:34:33,925 --> 00:34:35,666
Many holes in the metro area.

721
00:34:36,544 --> 00:34:38,070
Ladies and gentlemen...

722
00:34:38,231 --> 00:34:42,780
What you won't do to get
out of being married to me.

723
00:34:43,953 --> 00:34:45,484
Aw, crap.

724
00:34:46,616 --> 00:34:48,225
I knew I couldn't trust the jumping bean

725
00:34:48,226 --> 00:34:49,805
to keep her mouth shut.

726
00:34:50,654 --> 00:34:52,022
These are for you.

727
00:34:52,482 --> 00:34:54,605
Rushing things a bit, don't ya think?

728
00:34:54,606 --> 00:34:55,689
Not dead yet.

729
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:58,035
No, but I'm about to kill ya.

730
00:34:58,036 --> 00:35:00,985
What the hell were you thinking?

731
00:35:02,007 --> 00:35:04,398
I didn't want to put
you through this again.

732
00:35:04,439 --> 00:35:08,755
Karen, I married you for better or worse.

733
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:11,566
We had the better, and now...

734
00:35:11,833 --> 00:35:13,576
Well, what if I say I don't want you here?

735
00:35:13,577 --> 00:35:15,790
You're an old lady.
What are you gonna do about it?

736
00:35:25,893 --> 00:35:27,236
I'm scared.

737
00:35:28,642 --> 00:35:30,023
I know.

738
00:35:37,768 --> 00:35:38,657
Hey, Renee.

739
00:35:38,658 --> 00:35:40,410
Hey, uh, just wanted to let you know

740
00:35:40,411 --> 00:35:42,681
that Ben's test results just got back,

741
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:46,035
and, uh, everything is normal.
He's getting out tomorrow.

742
00:35:46,036 --> 00:35:47,929
- That great news.
- Oh, and I got more.

743
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:51,681
We're back together,
and I have you to thank for that.

744
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:53,297
Well, you don't have to give me credit.

745
00:35:53,298 --> 00:35:54,188
Uh, yeah, I do,

746
00:35:54,189 --> 00:35:56,374
because if he breaks my heart again,

747
00:35:56,375 --> 00:35:57,856
I'm giving you the blame.

748
00:36:02,763 --> 00:36:04,430
Hey, did you say you're at the hospital?

749
00:36:04,431 --> 00:36:05,251
Yeah.

750
00:36:05,252 --> 00:36:07,791
- Is anybody staying at your place?
- No. Why?

751
00:36:07,792 --> 00:36:09,694
I just thought I saw a light turn on.

752
00:36:10,597 --> 00:36:12,848
It's probably nothing,
but I'll go check it out.

753
00:36:24,361 --> 00:36:25,712
What the hell are you doin'?

754
00:36:27,234 --> 00:36:28,951
Some people use voice mail.

755
00:36:28,952 --> 00:36:31,777
I prefer to deliver my messages in person.

756
00:36:32,972 --> 00:36:34,141
So...

757
00:36:34,507 --> 00:36:38,390
Why don't you just move along
before you get involved?

758
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,647
Too late.

759
00:36:41,405 --> 00:36:44,281
I keep forgetting you're
the tough guy around here.

760
00:36:44,773 --> 00:36:45,997
Well...

761
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:48,306
I don't want any trouble.

762
00:37:14,709 --> 00:37:16,639
I don't ever wanna see you again.

763
00:37:18,387 --> 00:37:19,995
Then you should have killed me.

764
00:37:31,204 --> 00:37:32,324
Hang on.

765
00:37:32,386 --> 00:37:33,582
Wait, wait, wait.

766
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:36,848
Surprise! Welcome home!

767
00:37:36,849 --> 00:37:38,618
Whoa! Who did this?

768
00:37:38,619 --> 00:37:39,231
I did.

769
00:37:39,232 --> 00:37:40,342
Really?

770
00:37:40,955 --> 00:37:42,271
'Cause when I got home from prison,

771
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:44,209
all you left me was
a post-it note on the fridge,

772
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:46,639
and it said, "Take out the trash, ex-con."

773
00:37:46,833 --> 00:37:49,646
Well, I don't want to take
you for granted anymore.

774
00:37:52,208 --> 00:37:53,874
You sound like you actually mean that.

775
00:37:55,274 --> 00:37:56,371
What's going on?

776
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,014
Karen's cancer is back...

777
00:38:00,015 --> 00:38:01,309
and it's bad.

778
00:38:01,462 --> 00:38:03,045
That's why she threw Roy out.

779
00:38:03,046 --> 00:38:04,304
Oh, god.

780
00:38:06,844 --> 00:38:08,281
Kind of makes you think.

781
00:38:09,124 --> 00:38:09,919
I mean, when we got married,

782
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,170
I thought that was the finish line.

783
00:38:12,171 --> 00:38:16,142
But it's not. Death is.
No one told us that.

784
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:17,913
Yeah, they did.

785
00:38:17,913 --> 00:38:19,980
At our wedding, they said,

786
00:38:19,981 --> 00:38:21,088
"Till death do us part."

787
00:38:21,089 --> 00:38:22,207
Oh, Carlos, please.

788
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:24,839
I had four glasses of
champagne before the ceremony.

789
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,271
I almost married your uncle.

790
00:38:26,272 --> 00:38:27,266
Oh, come on, Gaby.

791
00:38:27,267 --> 00:38:29,185
I mean, the idea that we might die someday

792
00:38:29,186 --> 00:38:30,827
must have at least crossed your mind.

793
00:38:31,098 --> 00:38:33,697
I just never thought about
what it really means,

794
00:38:33,698 --> 00:38:34,917
that one of us is gonna die,

795
00:38:34,918 --> 00:38:37,122
and the other one's gonna live through it.

796
00:38:37,329 --> 00:38:39,684
And if it's you who's first?

797
00:38:40,002 --> 00:38:41,614
I don't think I can do it.

798
00:38:43,213 --> 00:38:44,548
Yes, you can.

799
00:38:45,869 --> 00:38:48,001
You're one of the bravest people I know.

800
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,107
Look at what we've been through this year.

801
00:38:51,293 --> 00:38:52,789
You've been my rock.

802
00:38:54,674 --> 00:38:55,822
I have?

803
00:38:56,552 --> 00:38:57,803
Well...

804
00:38:57,881 --> 00:38:59,961
you and scotch.

805
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:01,715
But from now on, just you.

806
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:03,924
Thank you.

807
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:08,570
And, hey, if it makes you feel any better,

808
00:39:08,571 --> 00:39:11,857
you can always take
the easy way out... die first.

809
00:39:22,665 --> 00:39:23,415
What's going on with the name?

810
00:39:23,416 --> 00:39:25,207
You didn't change it to "Sop," did you?

811
00:39:25,208 --> 00:39:27,197
'cause that's even worse than "Lynette."

812
00:39:30,278 --> 00:39:32,109
"Lynette" isn't so bad.

813
00:39:35,592 --> 00:39:36,998
Thanks for that.

814
00:39:36,998 --> 00:39:37,998
You can count it on.

815
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:40,630
Thank you for all the rest of this.

816
00:39:42,217 --> 00:39:43,526
So you need anything?

817
00:39:47,387 --> 00:39:50,222
The nail holes need to be spackled.

818
00:39:50,774 --> 00:39:51,977
Mm. I'm on it.

819
00:40:14,685 --> 00:40:16,805
Hello? Bree, it's Orson.

820
00:40:25,438 --> 00:40:26,884
Listen to me.

821
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:30,662
Don't you ever call my house again.

822
00:40:30,663 --> 00:40:33,676
I can assure you this is
the last you'll hear from me.

823
00:40:34,012 --> 00:40:35,255
What do you want, Orson?

824
00:40:35,256 --> 00:40:38,339
I've been thinking about what you said,
and you're right.

825
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:41,041
The sins that have been
committed are so reprehensible

826
00:40:41,042 --> 00:40:43,364
that a sacrifice must be made.

827
00:40:44,217 --> 00:40:46,363
The ultimate sacrifice.

828
00:40:47,985 --> 00:40:51,019
Do not consider suicide.

829
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:53,815
That would only be adding
more sins to your list.

830
00:40:53,964 --> 00:40:56,178
You don't have to judge, Bree.

831
00:40:56,263 --> 00:40:58,549
Someone else will do that for you.

832
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:02,225
Good-bye... forever.

833
00:41:08,088 --> 00:41:09,300
<i>Yes.</i>

834
00:41:09,301 --> 00:41:13,800
<i>There are times when we all
could use a little help.</i>

835
00:41:16,271 --> 00:41:21,128
<i>When our generosity has
been repaid with cruelty...</i>

836
00:41:24,245 --> 00:41:28,347
<i>when our behavior has
filled us with regret...</i>

837
00:41:32,995 --> 00:41:37,647
<i>and when our future has
become terribly uncertain.</i>

838
00:41:45,809 --> 00:41:50,587
<i>But then there are those who
are past the point of help,</i>

839
00:41:50,989 --> 00:41:52,646
<i>and in their wake,</i>

840
00:41:52,942 --> 00:41:56,886
<i>they leave nothing but destruction.</i>

841
