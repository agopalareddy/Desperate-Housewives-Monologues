1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,558
<i>Previously on Desperate Housewives...</i>

2
00:00:02,724 --> 00:00:04,505
<i>Tom moved out of the house.</i>

3
00:00:04,743 --> 00:00:06,198
Tom and I are separating.

4
00:00:06,198 --> 00:00:07,166
No.

5
00:00:07,266 --> 00:00:09,116
<i>After covering up a murder,</i>

6
00:00:09,116 --> 00:00:12,096
<i>Gaby warned Bree it was a bad time</i>

7
00:00:12,096 --> 00:00:13,610
<i>to be dating a cop.</i>

8
00:00:13,752 --> 00:00:15,988
Get rid of Chuck!
But you've got to end this,

9
00:00:15,988 --> 00:00:17,477
and you've got to end it now.

10
00:00:17,477 --> 00:00:20,110
<i>Bree showed the mysterious letter to Paul,</i>

11
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,112
<i>who'd seen one like it before.</i>

12
00:00:22,331 --> 00:00:23,950
I mentioned the letter to the police.

13
00:00:23,985 --> 00:00:25,519
The main detective was a tall guy

14
00:00:25,553 --> 00:00:27,421
with a short name like, uh, Pence.

15
00:00:27,455 --> 00:00:30,157
- Was it Vance? Chuck Vance?
- That's it.

16
00:00:30,191 --> 00:00:32,144
<i>Carlos struggled with remorse...</i>

17
00:00:32,144 --> 00:00:33,965
I just want us to get back to normal.

18
00:00:33,965 --> 00:00:35,768
We're never going back to normal!

19
00:00:35,768 --> 00:00:39,200
<i>And discovered he wasn't
the only one feeling guilty.</i>

20
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,395
It is nice to be able to talk about this.

21
00:00:41,873 --> 00:00:43,474
You wanna get some coffee?

22
00:00:48,764 --> 00:00:51,282
<i>Susan Delfino and Carlos Solis</i>

23
00:00:51,316 --> 00:00:54,077
<i>had never been the best of friends.</i>

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,762
<i>Susan thought Carlos
paid too much attention</i>

25
00:00:57,762 --> 00:00:59,769
<i>to other people's opinions.</i>

26
00:01:01,427 --> 00:01:05,390
<i>And Carlos thought Susan
didn't pay attention at all.</i>

27
00:01:07,832 --> 00:01:11,648
<i>Over the years, they'd never
had much to say to one another.</i>

28
00:01:12,807 --> 00:01:16,717
<i>But one night, Susan found
herself troubled by thoughts</i>

29
00:01:16,717 --> 00:01:18,878
<i>she couldn't share with her spouse.</i>

30
00:01:20,495 --> 00:01:21,874
<i>While two doors down,</i>

31
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:24,534
<i>Carlos was in the same predicament.</i>

32
00:01:27,386 --> 00:01:29,680
<i>And that's how it came to pass</i>

33
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,814
<i>that two people who'd never
had much to say to one another</i>

34
00:01:35,006 --> 00:01:36,692
<i>suddenly found...</i>

35
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,650
<i>they had a great deal to talk about.</i>

36
00:01:42,424 --> 00:01:45,696
So I leave the office,
walk into the parking garage,

37
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:48,844
and... there he is.

38
00:01:49,129 --> 00:01:50,267
Alejandro.

39
00:01:50,473 --> 00:01:51,466
Right in front of me.

40
00:01:51,466 --> 00:01:53,462
I practically jump out of my skin.

41
00:01:54,395 --> 00:01:55,649
Then I turn around again.

42
00:01:56,588 --> 00:01:58,460
It's just some guy getting into his car.

43
00:01:59,707 --> 00:02:00,847
This is not me.

44
00:02:01,134 --> 00:02:03,790
I can't sleep. I'm seeing ghosts.

45
00:02:04,102 --> 00:02:05,146
I feel like...

46
00:02:05,724 --> 00:02:08,159
I'm walking around with
a neon sign on my forehead,

47
00:02:08,193 --> 00:02:10,435
flashing "Guilty, guilty,"

48
00:02:10,435 --> 00:02:12,052
and everybody can see it.

49
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:15,199
Sometimes I think I'm losing it.

50
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:16,262
Me, too.

51
00:02:17,286 --> 00:02:18,907
I was getting ready to deck the guy.

52
00:02:19,186 --> 00:02:20,300
Can you imagine?

53
00:02:20,656 --> 00:02:22,340
Can I imagine?

54
00:02:22,341 --> 00:02:24,194
I assaulted a cop, remember?

55
00:02:24,672 --> 00:02:27,924
Oh, yeah. What happened with that?

56
00:02:28,082 --> 00:02:30,230
15 hours of community service.

57
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,666
And I can't tell Mike.

58
00:02:33,293 --> 00:02:35,368
It's one more thing
I'm lying to him about.

59
00:02:35,636 --> 00:02:38,256
Well, I can talk to Gaby,
but she's sick of listening.

60
00:02:39,589 --> 00:02:41,298
That's what this makes this feel so...

61
00:02:47,193 --> 00:02:48,261
I know.

62
00:02:51,152 --> 00:02:52,366
Can I tell you something?

63
00:02:53,928 --> 00:02:56,062
When I went out walking tonight,

64
00:02:57,631 --> 00:02:59,899
I was kind of hoping I'd run into you.

65
00:03:03,437 --> 00:03:05,181
I was kinda hoping that, too.

66
00:03:10,998 --> 00:03:14,541
You're kidding. You've never read
"To Kill a Mockingbird"?

67
00:03:15,026 --> 00:03:16,010
In my school, if you read a book,

68
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,966
it was more like "To Kill a Sophomore."

69
00:03:19,189 --> 00:03:22,734
Well, you would love it.
Um, it's about a guy

70
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,321
who tries to hang on
to his sense of right and wrong

71
00:03:27,752 --> 00:03:29,522
when the system fails him.

72
00:03:30,034 --> 00:03:31,273
Gee, I don't get that at all.

73
00:03:33,454 --> 00:03:37,266
Oh. Your jacket. Thank you.

74
00:03:39,176 --> 00:03:41,477
<i>Yes, Susan and Carlos</i>

75
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:44,317
<i>were starting to pay
attention to one another.</i>

76
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,066
Good night.

77
00:03:48,124 --> 00:03:50,446
<i>But what they didn't realize</i>

78
00:03:50,826 --> 00:03:54,512
<i>was that someone else was
paying attention, too.</i>

79
00:04:07,646 --> 00:04:10,379
<i>Wisteria Lane may look flawless,</i>

80
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:12,867
<i>but that's only because its residents</i>

81
00:04:12,901 --> 00:04:16,772
<i>are so good at concealing imperfections.</i>

82
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:22,289
<i>They know how to make something
old look new again...</i>

83
00:04:23,836 --> 00:04:27,090
<i>how to make an embarrassing
mistake disappear...</i>

84
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:32,779
<i>how to make a poor showing
look like a modest victory...</i>

85
00:04:33,695 --> 00:04:36,188
<i>and how to make a friend feel better</i>

86
00:04:36,624 --> 00:04:39,881
<i>after she's gone through a messy breakup.</i>

87
00:04:40,162 --> 00:04:41,990
Gaby, how thoughtful.

88
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,801
It's from that new place, Skinny Berry.

89
00:04:43,801 --> 00:04:46,036
Tastes like a milkshake
but only 18 calories.

90
00:04:48,647 --> 00:04:50,640
And I figured you could
use a little pick-me-up

91
00:04:50,674 --> 00:04:51,946
after you dumped Chuck.

92
00:04:53,012 --> 00:04:54,582
Yeah, well, about that...

93
00:04:56,813 --> 00:04:57,620
Morning, women.

94
00:04:59,137 --> 00:05:00,045
Morning.

95
00:05:01,118 --> 00:05:03,098
Oh, is that... is that from Skinny Berry?

96
00:05:03,212 --> 00:05:05,421
You know, the fraud unit's
all over that place, right?

97
00:05:05,421 --> 00:05:07,228
Apparently those things
are like pure ice cream.

98
00:05:07,502 --> 00:05:09,584
Huh! Guess you can't trust anybody.

99
00:05:13,085 --> 00:05:13,872
Have a good day.

100
00:05:17,598 --> 00:05:19,265
All right, I know what you're gonna say...

101
00:05:19,283 --> 00:05:21,100
Three words... first word, "You're,"

102
00:05:21,135 --> 00:05:22,368
third word, "Crazy,"

103
00:05:22,403 --> 00:05:24,564
middle word... what you
keep doing to that guy!

104
00:05:24,738 --> 00:05:25,583
You don't understand.

105
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:26,824
Damn right I don't.

106
00:05:27,007 --> 00:05:28,168
You said you were gonna dump him.

107
00:05:28,168 --> 00:05:29,340
I was.

108
00:05:30,327 --> 00:05:33,699
But... I think Chuck wrote the letter.

109
00:05:35,146 --> 00:05:36,674
The "I know what you did" letter?

110
00:05:37,094 --> 00:05:38,312
What makes you think that?

111
00:05:38,312 --> 00:05:39,713
I spoke to Paul Young, and...

112
00:05:39,747 --> 00:05:41,364
Whoa, whoa. Why would you talk to Paul?

113
00:05:41,691 --> 00:05:44,084
To find out who else knew
about Mary Alice's letter,

114
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:48,126
and he said that when he confessed
to killing Martha Huber,

115
00:05:48,127 --> 00:05:48,874
Chuck was there.

116
00:05:50,325 --> 00:05:53,103
Okay, but why would Chuck blackmail you?

117
00:05:53,261 --> 00:05:55,396
He's already got the milk and the cow.

118
00:05:56,082 --> 00:05:58,193
No offense. Just what else could he want?

119
00:05:58,367 --> 00:05:59,734
Maybe he wants to control me.

120
00:05:59,768 --> 00:06:01,789
Maybe he wants money. I don't know.

121
00:06:02,494 --> 00:06:04,064
You've gotta start snooping.

122
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,073
- What?
- Yeah. Go through his stuff,

123
00:06:06,108 --> 00:06:08,743
hack into his e-mails,
listen in on his phone calls.

124
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:09,960
I can't do that.

125
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,320
You have to, Bree.

126
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,418
Until we know what Chuck knows...
exactly what he knows,

127
00:06:14,653 --> 00:06:15,990
it's not just you who's in danger.

128
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,080
It's all of us.

129
00:06:25,098 --> 00:06:26,303
How's that pressure?

130
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:29,502
Ohh, perfect, and remember, Friedrich,

131
00:06:29,537 --> 00:06:31,934
I've hidden your tip somewhere on my body.

132
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:33,609
It's up to you to find it.

133
00:06:36,806 --> 00:06:38,039
Go away!

134
00:06:38,347 --> 00:06:40,144
Renee! I need you.

135
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,225
Lee?

136
00:06:41,225 --> 00:06:43,217
I am in crisis. I am at my wit's...

137
00:06:43,252 --> 00:06:44,296
Well, hello.

138
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,993
Lee McDermott. Nice to meet you.

139
00:06:47,322 --> 00:06:48,339
I'm Friedrich.

140
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,424
Ooh, like in "The sound of music"?

141
00:06:52,808 --> 00:06:54,894
Nothing? Okay. He plays for your team.

142
00:06:54,894 --> 00:06:56,695
Anyway, I need a huge favor.

143
00:06:56,695 --> 00:06:58,832
I don't do favors. You know that.

144
00:06:58,832 --> 00:06:59,822
It's for Jenny.

145
00:06:59,822 --> 00:07:00,863
Oh, your daughter?

146
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,605
- Yeah.
- No.

147
00:07:02,605 --> 00:07:04,087
Oh, please.

148
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,538
I am desperate.

149
00:07:06,538 --> 00:07:07,988
When Bob and I adopted her,

150
00:07:08,023 --> 00:07:11,094
we agreed that I would take care of
the "Time of the month" talk,

151
00:07:11,094 --> 00:07:13,184
and Bob would handle all things bra.

152
00:07:13,184 --> 00:07:14,830
Well, that bastard is in Tokyo,

153
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,839
and the boobie fairy has arrived.

154
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:18,975
The boobie fairy?

155
00:07:18,975 --> 00:07:21,128
See why I should not be
the one handling this?

156
00:07:21,924 --> 00:07:24,979
I was hoping... maybe you
could take her shopping?

157
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:27,313
Oh, man up. It's just a bra.

158
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:28,648
They terrify me.

159
00:07:28,902 --> 00:07:31,623
Too many numbers and letters and colors,

160
00:07:31,623 --> 00:07:33,308
and it's my little girl growing up,

161
00:07:33,308 --> 00:07:34,684
and I can't deal.

162
00:07:36,941 --> 00:07:38,294
Ohh, yes.

163
00:07:39,476 --> 00:07:40,302
So you'll do it?

164
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,929
No, he just found his tip.

165
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:45,342
Renee!

166
00:07:45,917 --> 00:07:48,552
Fine. I'll take her, but only for an hour,

167
00:07:48,586 --> 00:07:49,926
and no small talk.

168
00:07:49,926 --> 00:07:50,789
Oh, bless you.

169
00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:52,547
I will never forget you for this. Mwah.

170
00:07:53,842 --> 00:07:56,260
Look! Ricky Martin! Eating a banana!

171
00:07:58,745 --> 00:07:59,605
Just checking.

172
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:07,902
Oh, please come with us.
You've bra shopped with Penny.

173
00:08:08,173 --> 00:08:10,825
And maybe one of your older boys,
if I'm guessing right.

174
00:08:10,825 --> 00:08:12,420
I can't. I have plans.

175
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,845
Oh, that's right. Tom's got the kids,

176
00:08:14,845 --> 00:08:16,576
and you have this whole place to yourself.

177
00:08:17,454 --> 00:08:18,350
What are you gonna do?

178
00:08:19,613 --> 00:08:20,682
Oh, sweetie.

179
00:08:20,682 --> 00:08:22,249
Some man who's not married to you

180
00:08:22,249 --> 00:08:24,950
is gonna have to see that body soon.
Do not do this.

181
00:08:25,473 --> 00:08:27,392
It's not for me. My sister's coming.

182
00:08:27,726 --> 00:08:29,962
Lydia? The disaster?

183
00:08:29,962 --> 00:08:31,286
Yeah. Out of the blue, she called

184
00:08:31,286 --> 00:08:33,909
and says she wants to visit.
You know what that means.

185
00:08:34,061 --> 00:08:34,604
She got dumped.

186
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:36,272
After loaning him a lot of money.

187
00:08:36,272 --> 00:08:37,451
And finding out he's married.

188
00:08:37,451 --> 00:08:41,253
In two states. So... I gotta
get the whole toolkit ready

189
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:45,096
so after she crash-lands here,
I can pick up the pieces.

190
00:08:45,615 --> 00:08:47,526
Uh, I'm going out the back door.

191
00:08:47,544 --> 00:08:49,366
I hate to see people crying.

192
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:52,531
It reminds me how little
I actually care about others.

193
00:08:55,657 --> 00:08:56,418
Coming!

194
00:08:57,837 --> 00:08:59,662
Oh, hi.

195
00:08:59,662 --> 00:09:00,794
- Lynnie.
- Ohh.

196
00:09:00,794 --> 00:09:01,799
You look...

197
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,556
You look fantastic.

198
00:09:05,048 --> 00:09:07,127
You thought I'd be my usual blubbery mess

199
00:09:07,127 --> 00:09:08,943
of snot and tears, didn't you?

200
00:09:08,943 --> 00:09:10,490
What? No.

201
00:09:10,768 --> 00:09:12,551
Well, that's not me anymore.

202
00:09:12,937 --> 00:09:15,428
Thanks to Rashi, I'm a changed woman.

203
00:09:15,838 --> 00:09:18,759
Rashi? Oh, god. Did you get a dog?

204
00:09:18,846 --> 00:09:21,502
No, silly. I got engaged

205
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,987
to the greatest guy in the world.

206
00:09:28,738 --> 00:09:32,664
Oh, and, Lynette,
I'm so sorry about you and Tom.

207
00:09:33,241 --> 00:09:36,120
But don't worry. I'm here to help.

208
00:09:43,745 --> 00:09:45,815
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

209
00:09:45,815 --> 00:09:47,866
Grocery store was a madhouse.

210
00:09:47,866 --> 00:09:50,668
I actually had to fight
a woman over the last chicken.

211
00:09:50,668 --> 00:09:52,369
- Susan...
- Unfortunately, she was Slavic...

212
00:09:52,369 --> 00:09:55,958
a very sturdy people,
so I hope you like cereal.

213
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:58,786
Susan, stop. I just got off the phone

214
00:09:58,786 --> 00:10:00,005
with the guy from the county.

215
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,430
Something about your
court-ordered community service

216
00:10:02,464 --> 00:10:04,060
for assaulting a policeman.

217
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,880
Oh. That.

218
00:10:08,158 --> 00:10:09,440
Yeah, that.

219
00:10:12,563 --> 00:10:14,352
W... it's so ridiculous.

220
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:17,944
I was... trying to fight a...
parking ticket,

221
00:10:17,944 --> 00:10:20,008
and I knocked over the cop's bike.

222
00:10:20,008 --> 00:10:23,210
Um, and I maybe told
him his baby was ugly.

223
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:25,916
He... he blew the whole
thing out of proportion.

224
00:10:26,461 --> 00:10:28,007
Well, you know what
I'm blowing out of proportion?

225
00:10:28,368 --> 00:10:31,460
The guy on the phone
called me "Mr. Solis."

226
00:10:33,547 --> 00:10:34,348
Right.

227
00:10:34,812 --> 00:10:36,164
Because, um...

228
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:40,732
Carlos picked me up at
the, uh, police station,

229
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,300
which I know sounds weird...

230
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,527
why him and not you...

231
00:10:48,598 --> 00:10:51,696
I was just, uh, so embarrassed,

232
00:10:51,696 --> 00:10:53,917
I... I didn't wanna tell you.

233
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,878
So there's nothing going
on with you and Carlos?

234
00:11:02,406 --> 00:11:03,891
I shouldn't be worried

235
00:11:03,891 --> 00:11:06,558
about your little moonlight
stroll last night?

236
00:11:09,864 --> 00:11:12,036
Have you been taking fighting lessons

237
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,640
from that Slavic lady?

238
00:11:16,032 --> 00:11:16,821
Mike, come on.

239
00:11:17,328 --> 00:11:18,827
I couldn't sleep. Carlos couldn't sleep.

240
00:11:18,861 --> 00:11:21,030
We ran into each other, and we talked.

241
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,763
About what? You barely know him.

242
00:11:23,507 --> 00:11:24,816
The first eight years we lived here,

243
00:11:24,867 --> 00:11:26,372
you called him Ricky Ricardo.

244
00:11:27,383 --> 00:11:30,939
He's... going through something,

245
00:11:30,973 --> 00:11:32,729
and I'm helping him.

246
00:11:33,008 --> 00:11:35,816
Yeah? Tell me. What's he going through?

247
00:11:38,714 --> 00:11:40,001
It's personal.

248
00:11:42,718 --> 00:11:45,573
Okay, Mike, Carlos and I are just friends.

249
00:11:45,573 --> 00:11:47,528
I don't mind you being friends with a guy.

250
00:11:48,063 --> 00:11:49,946
It's all the sneaking around and the lying

251
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:51,693
I'm having a hard time with.

252
00:11:59,512 --> 00:12:02,519
So she waltzes in to
my advanced yoga class

253
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:05,041
even though, clearly,
she's never done yoga before.

254
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,366
Well, the teacher of the beginner's class

255
00:12:06,366 --> 00:12:08,119
wasn't nearly as cute as you.

256
00:12:08,747 --> 00:12:10,483
And then I, uh, go over

257
00:12:10,483 --> 00:12:13,065
and correct her cobbler pose, right?

258
00:12:13,845 --> 00:12:15,109
And our eyes meet.

259
00:12:16,239 --> 00:12:18,835
And three weeks later, he gives me this.

260
00:12:20,044 --> 00:12:21,427
Wow, that's some rock.

261
00:12:22,461 --> 00:12:23,685
Literally, it's a rock.

262
00:12:23,983 --> 00:12:25,705
I saw it on the beach after class.

263
00:12:26,185 --> 00:12:27,632
It calls out to me,

264
00:12:27,633 --> 00:12:30,165
and I feel like I might need it someday.

265
00:12:30,669 --> 00:12:34,375
And you did. Isn't the universe amazing?

266
00:12:34,681 --> 00:12:36,213
Amazingly thrifty.

267
00:12:37,525 --> 00:12:38,135
Okay.

268
00:12:38,135 --> 00:12:40,151
So this is my third glass.

269
00:12:40,697 --> 00:12:42,959
I'm saying mean things,
but I'm not getting a buzz.

270
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,496
The wine is alcohol-free.

271
00:12:46,227 --> 00:12:48,069
So this night's not getting any better.

272
00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:50,011
Ever since Rashi did
a liver cleanse on me,

273
00:12:50,011 --> 00:12:51,454
I haven't had a drop to drink.

274
00:12:53,617 --> 00:12:55,273
You got Lydia to give up wine?

275
00:12:55,584 --> 00:12:57,349
You should take your act to Vegas.

276
00:12:58,143 --> 00:12:59,165
It's not an act.

277
00:12:59,706 --> 00:13:01,903
I'm gonna go grab some
spices out of the van.

278
00:13:11,115 --> 00:13:12,863
Okay, who are you kidding?

279
00:13:13,427 --> 00:13:15,307
You can't marry that sunflower seed.

280
00:13:15,463 --> 00:13:16,905
I'm not kidding anybody.

281
00:13:17,793 --> 00:13:18,697
I love him.

282
00:13:19,747 --> 00:13:22,883
In fact, he's leading
a meditation seminar...

283
00:13:23,099 --> 00:13:24,435
at Kerrigan Park.

284
00:13:24,841 --> 00:13:25,819
Why don't you come?

285
00:13:26,549 --> 00:13:28,887
It might help you deal with
your marriage crashing.

286
00:13:30,119 --> 00:13:31,666
My marriage did not crash.

287
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:32,932
Tom and I are separated.

288
00:13:32,966 --> 00:13:34,136
Exactly why you should be

289
00:13:34,137 --> 00:13:35,201
doing some "Lynette work."

290
00:13:35,235 --> 00:13:37,185
Come on. It'll be fun.

291
00:13:37,437 --> 00:13:41,273
Six hours of silence in
a traditional mountain yurt.

292
00:13:42,415 --> 00:13:43,870
I promise you, Lydia,

293
00:13:43,871 --> 00:13:45,325
if you drag me to a yurt,

294
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,212
two will go in, one will come out.

295
00:13:55,848 --> 00:13:57,939
Careful. That's our tax
dollars you're dripping.

296
00:13:58,385 --> 00:13:59,407
Sorry.

297
00:14:00,104 --> 00:14:02,522
You need to pace yourself.
You're gonna need lots of paint

298
00:14:02,556 --> 00:14:04,509
to cover that gigantic banana over there.

299
00:14:06,327 --> 00:14:09,311
Uh... I don't think that's a banana.

300
00:14:16,595 --> 00:14:18,587
Hey, I worked hard on that graffiti.

301
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:20,579
What are you doing here?

302
00:14:22,817 --> 00:14:23,957
"To kill a mockingbird."

303
00:14:24,345 --> 00:14:25,609
I started reading it last night.

304
00:14:25,609 --> 00:14:26,191
It was so good.

305
00:14:26,192 --> 00:14:27,355
I couldn't wait to talk to you about it.

306
00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:29,771
Yeah, well, I'm kinda beautifying the city

307
00:14:29,771 --> 00:14:30,695
at the moment.

308
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:32,337
Don't you get a lunch?

309
00:14:35,168 --> 00:14:38,280
Look, Carlos, Mike found out
we were spending time together,

310
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,189
and he's a little weird about it,

311
00:14:40,189 --> 00:14:43,537
so I don't think we should be
having any intimate lunches.

312
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:47,584
Why is he weird? I mean,
nothing's going on.

313
00:14:47,584 --> 00:14:50,189
No, of course not, but somehow...

314
00:14:51,183 --> 00:14:52,795
us meeting in the middle of the night

315
00:14:52,795 --> 00:14:56,127
and me lying about it was
kind of a red flag for him.

316
00:14:59,405 --> 00:15:00,239
Okay.

317
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,204
Well, if lunch is too intimate...

318
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,845
How about... I help with the beautifying?

319
00:15:09,384 --> 00:15:10,988
I guess there's no harm in that.

320
00:15:12,002 --> 00:15:12,869
Excuse me.

321
00:15:13,334 --> 00:15:14,934
Are you here for community service?

322
00:15:15,298 --> 00:15:17,519
Nope, just trying to be a good citizen.

323
00:15:17,524 --> 00:15:19,912
Can't. Not unless you committed a crime.

324
00:15:22,152 --> 00:15:23,204
Are you serious?

325
00:15:23,312 --> 00:15:24,198
Yeah.

326
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:31,625
There.

327
00:15:32,318 --> 00:15:33,439
I littered.

328
00:15:42,612 --> 00:15:43,825
Jenny, trust me.

329
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,665
You want Jackson to notice you,

330
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:46,649
ice him out.

331
00:15:46,649 --> 00:15:48,868
Don't talk to him. Don't look at him.

332
00:15:48,897 --> 00:15:51,255
Maybe have sex with his best friend.

333
00:15:51,652 --> 00:15:53,771
I mean, have a soda. Got it?

334
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:54,888
Totes.

335
00:15:54,888 --> 00:15:55,988
What happened to you guys?

336
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:57,819
You were supposed to
be back two hours ago.

337
00:15:57,819 --> 00:16:00,612
Uh, we went shopping.
Here's your credit card.

338
00:16:00,612 --> 00:16:02,467
Oh, and by the way, I upped your limit.

339
00:16:02,467 --> 00:16:04,119
3 grand? What are you, a nurse?

340
00:16:04,754 --> 00:16:06,453
So... tell me all about your day.

341
00:16:06,453 --> 00:16:09,163
O.M.G. I want to see
everything you bought.

342
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:10,735
Dad, you're like a million years

343
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:12,500
too old for "O.M.G."

344
00:16:14,567 --> 00:16:16,236
I'm gonna try the makeup you got me.

345
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,672
Wait. You got her makeup?

346
00:16:18,672 --> 00:16:19,459
She's 11.

347
00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:20,991
Uh, she wears a bra now.

348
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:23,025
Think she's ready for
strawberry lip gloss.

349
00:16:23,429 --> 00:16:25,690
Tell me what happens with Jackson.

350
00:16:25,812 --> 00:16:27,406
I want all the deets.

351
00:16:27,859 --> 00:16:29,960
"Deets." I love you.

352
00:16:32,322 --> 00:16:35,008
Well, look at you two, all B.F.F.

353
00:16:35,668 --> 00:16:38,206
So who's this Jackson?
I would like those deets.

354
00:16:38,405 --> 00:16:41,381
Oh, she asked me not
to tell anyone about him.

355
00:16:41,618 --> 00:16:44,166
I'm not anyone. I'm her co-father.

356
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,392
Well, don't take it personally.

357
00:16:45,392 --> 00:16:47,327
There are just some things
girls would rather talk about

358
00:16:47,327 --> 00:16:48,657
with other girls.

359
00:16:49,131 --> 00:16:50,188
I could be a girl.

360
00:16:50,188 --> 00:16:51,753
I could totally be a girl!

361
00:16:52,051 --> 00:16:53,572
Well, you got the voice down.

362
00:17:00,564 --> 00:17:02,020
Hey, where are you?

363
00:17:02,109 --> 00:17:04,720
In the kitchen! Come join me.

364
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:10,250
Smells amazing. What are you making?

365
00:17:11,023 --> 00:17:13,774
Oh, seared tilapia, bearnaise sabayon,

366
00:17:13,774 --> 00:17:15,219
and a little bok choy.

367
00:17:15,273 --> 00:17:16,598
Mind giving me a hand?

368
00:17:16,598 --> 00:17:17,746
Bree, the only word I recognized

369
00:17:17,747 --> 00:17:19,240
in that sentence was "Hand."

370
00:17:19,357 --> 00:17:22,621
Come on. There's nothing to it.
This is bearnaise sauce.

371
00:17:22,651 --> 00:17:26,834
It just needs ten minutes
of constant whisking.

372
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,219
Constant.

373
00:17:29,877 --> 00:17:31,878
Look at you. You're a natural.

374
00:17:31,878 --> 00:17:33,584
I'm gonna go dress for dinner.

375
00:17:35,942 --> 00:17:38,022
Now remember, keep
whisking for ten minutes.

376
00:17:38,022 --> 00:17:41,247
If your hand starts to spasm,
it means you're doing it right.

377
00:18:06,609 --> 00:18:08,875
Bree, I think it's been ten minutes!

378
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,522
No! No, not even close!

379
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:12,940
Keep whisking till it's light and frothy!

380
00:18:31,949 --> 00:18:35,194
Okay, I don't care how long it's been,

381
00:18:35,798 --> 00:18:38,151
that stuff ain't getting any frothier.

382
00:18:40,215 --> 00:18:43,662
And I got a cramp in my shooting hand.

383
00:18:43,879 --> 00:18:47,625
So if a criminal gets away tomorrow,
it'll be your fault.

384
00:18:49,535 --> 00:18:50,628
I'm so sorry.

385
00:18:51,401 --> 00:18:55,438
Here. Let me, uh, massage it for you.

386
00:19:06,525 --> 00:19:08,669
He took a picture of your
hand while you were sleeping?

387
00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:09,554
How creepy is that?

388
00:19:09,555 --> 00:19:11,621
I know. Why would he do such a thing?

389
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:14,756
- Oh, my god.
- What?

390
00:19:15,414 --> 00:19:17,996
He must have found a
handprint at the crime scene.

391
00:19:17,996 --> 00:19:19,373
He pulled your print off the photo,

392
00:19:19,373 --> 00:19:20,404
and they were a match.

393
00:19:20,404 --> 00:19:22,367
- Is that possible?
- I don't know.

394
00:19:22,497 --> 00:19:24,212
Well, then what's in the envelope?

395
00:19:25,106 --> 00:19:27,902
Maybe the cell phone or a
piece of the shovel handle.

396
00:19:27,902 --> 00:19:30,103
Whatever it is, that's what
he's gonna use to nail us.

397
00:19:30,103 --> 00:19:31,497
Well, we have to get that envelope,

398
00:19:31,497 --> 00:19:34,503
and I can't keep distracting
him by having him stir sauces.

399
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,084
By the way, his bearnaise... disaster.

400
00:19:37,405 --> 00:19:39,428
Okay. Tonight when he gets home,

401
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,181
you take him for a long walk,

402
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:43,121
leave the back door open,
and I'll do the rest.

403
00:19:43,121 --> 00:19:44,040
Got it.

404
00:19:45,996 --> 00:19:47,767
What if the briefcase is locked?

405
00:19:47,894 --> 00:19:50,375
I can pick locks. Yeah.

406
00:19:51,002 --> 00:19:53,597
I can also disguise my voice,
forge people's signatures,

407
00:19:53,597 --> 00:19:54,992
and I'm a decent pickpocket.

408
00:19:55,164 --> 00:19:57,469
Adultery gave me some
valuable life skills.

409
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,711
Fractions are so stupid.

410
00:20:04,127 --> 00:20:06,356
I'm never gonna need this stuff anyway.

411
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:07,802
Are you kidding me?

412
00:20:08,389 --> 00:20:12,416
Let's say you marry a guy
who's worth $20 million.

413
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:14,784
You divorce him, and he gives you half,

414
00:20:14,784 --> 00:20:17,532
but your prenup says
you get three-quarters.

415
00:20:17,532 --> 00:20:20,428
That extra $5 million gets you a yacht,

416
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:23,026
because you learned your fractions.

417
00:20:24,366 --> 00:20:25,763
True story, by the way.

418
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,417
Hello? It's Lee!

419
00:20:28,417 --> 00:20:30,005
Hey! Come on up.

420
00:20:30,005 --> 00:20:32,668
You know, you'd be a really cool mom.

421
00:20:32,978 --> 00:20:34,017
You think so?

422
00:20:35,828 --> 00:20:39,429
No, I'd probably just leave
the kid in a nightclub

423
00:20:39,429 --> 00:20:40,541
or... Morocco.

424
00:20:41,398 --> 00:20:43,092
Hey. What are you doing here?

425
00:20:43,092 --> 00:20:44,705
What am I doing here?
I'm looking for my daughter,

426
00:20:44,705 --> 00:20:47,063
who said she'd be home by 5:00.

427
00:20:47,063 --> 00:20:50,056
- I guess we got carried away.
- Totes.

428
00:20:50,056 --> 00:20:53,057
Use the whole word!
How much time are you saving?

429
00:20:53,309 --> 00:20:55,489
- Calm down.
- Can you stay out of this?

430
00:20:55,489 --> 00:20:57,100
This is between me and my daughter.

431
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,240
Stop. You're embarrassing me.

432
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,410
I don't care.

433
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:02,499
You need to come home with me... now.

434
00:21:03,433 --> 00:21:04,996
What if I say I'm not ready to leave?

435
00:21:04,996 --> 00:21:06,579
What if I say you're grounded for a week?

436
00:21:06,579 --> 00:21:07,529
Should we keep going?

437
00:21:07,529 --> 00:21:10,365
What?! You are so unfair!

438
00:21:16,215 --> 00:21:17,818
Aren't you being a little hard on her?

439
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:20,074
Back off, Renee. You're not her mother.

440
00:21:24,892 --> 00:21:29,670
Mmm. My sweet, that was your
most delicious meal yet.

441
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:30,584
What was in this?

442
00:21:30,584 --> 00:21:32,778
Uh, just walnuts, hemp curds,

443
00:21:32,778 --> 00:21:35,523
and one very special ingredient.

444
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,279
Please don't say "Love,"

445
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,244
because I'm already nauseous.

446
00:21:39,752 --> 00:21:42,443
I find that a walk after a meal

447
00:21:42,443 --> 00:21:44,628
helps encourage my digestive flow.

448
00:21:44,628 --> 00:21:45,773
Anybody care to join me?

449
00:21:45,773 --> 00:21:47,396
You go. I'll clean up.

450
00:21:52,199 --> 00:21:54,189
No, Lynette!

451
00:21:54,368 --> 00:21:55,948
That's full of poison.

452
00:21:55,948 --> 00:21:57,966
Yes, delicious, creamy poison,

453
00:21:57,967 --> 00:21:59,054
which, by the way,

454
00:21:59,054 --> 00:22:01,025
you used to suck down by the gallon.

455
00:22:01,025 --> 00:22:03,909
Yes, I know, but I've changed.

456
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:07,048
And I wanna help you change, too.
It's why I'm here.

457
00:22:07,048 --> 00:22:09,195
Wow. That's a bigger load of crap

458
00:22:09,195 --> 00:22:10,371
than the one we just ate.

459
00:22:11,352 --> 00:22:12,362
Excuse me?

460
00:22:12,573 --> 00:22:15,811
You're not here for me.
You're here because for once,

461
00:22:15,811 --> 00:22:17,817
you're the one in the happy relationship,

462
00:22:17,817 --> 00:22:21,008
and you just couldn't
wait to rub my face in it.

463
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:22,264
How could...

464
00:22:22,747 --> 00:22:24,306
Why do you al... No.

465
00:22:24,424 --> 00:22:26,644
No, no, no, no. No.

466
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:29,304
You won't drag me down to your level.

467
00:22:29,304 --> 00:22:31,887
I am surrounded by a beautiful bubble

468
00:22:31,887 --> 00:22:33,515
of loving energy.

469
00:22:33,515 --> 00:22:34,447
Yes, Lydia,

470
00:22:34,448 --> 00:22:35,690
you are in a bubble,

471
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:37,799
but once the pebble collector

472
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,381
dumps you like they all do,

473
00:22:39,381 --> 00:22:41,844
you'll go right back to
being the ice cream-binging,

474
00:22:41,844 --> 00:22:43,922
wine-swilling,

475
00:22:43,923 --> 00:22:46,232
neurotic mess you really are.

476
00:22:46,233 --> 00:22:46,441
Pop!

477
00:22:46,938 --> 00:22:50,256
You are so mean. God, I hate you.

478
00:22:50,256 --> 00:22:51,437
There she is. Welcome back.

479
00:22:51,437 --> 00:22:54,145
My whole life, you've
treated me like a screwup.

480
00:22:54,145 --> 00:22:55,621
You always had to be the happy one,

481
00:22:55,621 --> 00:22:57,197
the smart one, the married one.

482
00:22:57,197 --> 00:23:00,450
Well, guess what?
Now you're the screwup, bitch.

483
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,556
You're alone and miserable,

484
00:23:02,557 --> 00:23:03,690
and I love it.

485
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:05,805
I love it, I love it,
I love it, I love it!

486
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:06,928
Wow.

487
00:23:08,874 --> 00:23:12,806
I just, uh, forgot my iPod.

488
00:23:17,872 --> 00:23:18,581
Wow.

489
00:23:45,637 --> 00:23:48,719
Uh-oh. A chardonnay float.

490
00:23:50,537 --> 00:23:51,655
Does that mean...

491
00:23:51,903 --> 00:23:52,670
Yes.

492
00:23:53,793 --> 00:23:56,628
Rashi's gone to the retreat alone,

493
00:23:56,628 --> 00:23:59,555
so... congratulations.

494
00:23:59,555 --> 00:24:01,923
Now I'm just as miserable as you are.

495
00:24:02,546 --> 00:24:04,872
Did he... dump you?

496
00:24:05,689 --> 00:24:08,154
He said now that he's seen the real me,

497
00:24:08,154 --> 00:24:11,103
he needs to meditate on whether
or not he can still marry me.

498
00:24:12,486 --> 00:24:14,584
I'm so screwed, dude.

499
00:24:18,982 --> 00:24:21,749
You know, if he was that quick to run off,

500
00:24:22,304 --> 00:24:23,752
maybe he's not the guy.

501
00:24:23,964 --> 00:24:25,054
He's the guy.

502
00:24:26,032 --> 00:24:27,481
I'm just not the girl.

503
00:24:28,772 --> 00:24:32,754
I thought I could put all
that loser stuff behind me

504
00:24:32,944 --> 00:24:35,677
and actually have
a functional relationship.

505
00:24:36,983 --> 00:24:38,761
I guess that's too much to ask for.

506
00:24:39,607 --> 00:24:41,157
Why don't you go talk to him?

507
00:24:41,163 --> 00:24:42,119
I can't.

508
00:24:43,531 --> 00:24:45,038
After how I behaved,

509
00:24:46,075 --> 00:24:49,487
I've been told my energy is
no longer welcome in the yurt.

510
00:25:02,568 --> 00:25:03,499
Where is she?

511
00:25:04,797 --> 00:25:05,539
Where is who?

512
00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:07,333
Jenny. She's supposed to be grounded,

513
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:09,447
but when I went to her room
to check on her, she was gone.

514
00:25:09,778 --> 00:25:12,501
Well, she's not here.
I've been out all afternoon.

515
00:25:12,508 --> 00:25:13,822
I don't think I trust you.

516
00:25:15,251 --> 00:25:16,905
Jenny? Are you in here?

517
00:25:18,344 --> 00:25:19,853
This is all your fault, you know.

518
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:21,564
My fault? How is it my fault?

519
00:25:21,564 --> 00:25:24,095
I'm sorry. I'm not
speaking to you right now.

520
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:25,575
We were a perfectly happy family

521
00:25:25,576 --> 00:25:27,283
before you got involved.

522
00:25:27,283 --> 00:25:29,631
Got involved? You made
me take her shopping

523
00:25:29,631 --> 00:25:30,864
'cause you're scared of boobs!

524
00:25:30,864 --> 00:25:32,314
Yeah, and then you glommed on

525
00:25:32,314 --> 00:25:34,180
because you don't have kids of your own.

526
00:25:34,346 --> 00:25:36,050
It's not her fault!

527
00:25:37,267 --> 00:25:38,099
Jenny.

528
00:25:39,285 --> 00:25:41,101
I snuck in a back window.

529
00:25:41,634 --> 00:25:42,482
Sorry.

530
00:25:42,572 --> 00:25:44,827
What's going on? Why are you here?

531
00:25:44,827 --> 00:25:47,332
I like it here. We did our nails.

532
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:49,409
More.

533
00:25:49,732 --> 00:25:50,650
I don't know.

534
00:25:51,732 --> 00:25:54,484
Sometimes I think it'd
be cool to have a...

535
00:25:55,757 --> 00:25:56,527
mother.

536
00:25:56,808 --> 00:25:58,344
Oh, my god. The "M" word.

537
00:25:58,344 --> 00:25:59,311
Easy.

538
00:26:01,139 --> 00:26:03,186
What can a mother do that I can't?

539
00:26:03,956 --> 00:26:05,061
You wanna do your nails?

540
00:26:05,061 --> 00:26:06,976
Mani-pedi Mondays start next week.

541
00:26:07,135 --> 00:26:08,400
You want to try on shoes?

542
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,062
I have the stilettos that Cher wore

543
00:26:10,062 --> 00:26:11,639
to the "Moonstruck" Premiere.

544
00:26:12,837 --> 00:26:15,121
You can't go in the ladies' room with me.

545
00:26:15,704 --> 00:26:17,152
So that's the problem?!

546
00:26:17,152 --> 00:26:18,639
Well, you've got me.

547
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:22,227
I see why having a dad and
a papa is so horrible.

548
00:26:22,227 --> 00:26:24,305
Jenny, why don't you go in the kitchen?

549
00:26:24,433 --> 00:26:25,946
The latest "Vogue" is in there.

550
00:26:27,274 --> 00:26:29,217
We have magazines at our house, too!

551
00:26:31,396 --> 00:26:32,327
Are you okay?

552
00:26:38,204 --> 00:26:40,082
This is my worst nightmare come true.

553
00:26:41,387 --> 00:26:42,492
I've worried about this moment

554
00:26:42,492 --> 00:26:43,949
ever since she came into our lives.

555
00:26:43,949 --> 00:26:45,824
What if Bob and I aren't enough?

556
00:26:49,327 --> 00:26:50,726
What if she does need a mother?

557
00:26:52,153 --> 00:26:53,493
Oh, shut up.

558
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:56,266
Excuse me?

559
00:26:57,556 --> 00:26:59,842
You took a girl who was bouncing

560
00:26:59,842 --> 00:27:01,316
from one foster home to another

561
00:27:01,316 --> 00:27:03,527
and gave her two great
parents who love her.

562
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,491
But you heard her. It's not enough.

563
00:27:05,491 --> 00:27:07,590
Oh, please, she's a kid.

564
00:27:07,845 --> 00:27:10,262
Today she wants a mom.
Tomorrow she'll want a car.

565
00:27:10,689 --> 00:27:12,489
Jenny is not lacking for anything,

566
00:27:12,489 --> 00:27:14,984
and you guys are doing
an amazing job with her.

567
00:27:16,795 --> 00:27:17,527
Really?

568
00:27:17,527 --> 00:27:18,699
Yeah, really.

569
00:27:18,867 --> 00:27:20,996
So amazing, that for
the first time in my life,

570
00:27:20,996 --> 00:27:24,436
I... actually enjoyed
hanging out with a kid.

571
00:27:26,876 --> 00:27:28,054
Aw. Thank you.

572
00:27:29,711 --> 00:27:31,348
And I take back everything I said

573
00:27:31,348 --> 00:27:33,390
about you being an insensitive bitch.

574
00:27:33,928 --> 00:27:35,466
Uh, you never said that.

575
00:27:37,002 --> 00:27:38,544
Don't open your e-mail.

576
00:27:43,864 --> 00:27:45,253
We are the sun,

577
00:27:45,687 --> 00:27:48,992
the warmth radiating from our hearts.

578
00:27:50,055 --> 00:27:55,510
We are the endless sea rolling
beneath the forever sky.

579
00:27:56,133 --> 00:28:01,395
We are the leaves.
The wind blows us from trees.

580
00:28:01,395 --> 00:28:04,273
Sorry, sorry. Stupid wind.

581
00:28:04,791 --> 00:28:06,682
We are the stars,

582
00:28:06,729 --> 00:28:08,690
glowing, growing,

583
00:28:08,874 --> 00:28:12,795
losing ourselves but gaining the universe.

584
00:28:15,605 --> 00:28:16,604
You got a sec?

585
00:28:16,744 --> 00:28:18,116
What are you doing here?

586
00:28:18,522 --> 00:28:20,730
Besides trying not to laugh my ass off?

587
00:28:20,791 --> 00:28:22,144
I need to talk to you.

588
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,101
Well, not now!

589
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:25,668
My students have been
meditating for six hours.

590
00:28:25,668 --> 00:28:27,366
They are very close to
finding their bliss.

591
00:28:27,366 --> 00:28:29,089
I'm sure they can spare
you for a few minutes,

592
00:28:29,089 --> 00:28:30,231
so come talk to me,

593
00:28:30,231 --> 00:28:30,830
or I will start singing Ethel Merman

594
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:33,335
at the top of my lungs.

595
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,795
There's no business like show business

596
00:28:37,795 --> 00:28:39,922
- there's no...
- So sorry.

597
00:28:39,922 --> 00:28:41,258
I'll be right back.

598
00:28:41,777 --> 00:28:42,555
Come on.

599
00:28:47,703 --> 00:28:49,041
You can't leave Lydia.

600
00:28:50,027 --> 00:28:52,320
I don't want to, but I didn't recognize

601
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,894
that person I saw yelling at you.

602
00:28:53,894 --> 00:28:56,504
I did. It's the person I turn her into

603
00:28:56,504 --> 00:28:57,782
every time we get together.

604
00:28:57,782 --> 00:28:59,862
The Lydia I didn't recognize was the one

605
00:28:59,862 --> 00:29:02,530
who breezed through my house,
happy and in love.

606
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:04,897
You don't understand. It's too hard for me

607
00:29:04,897 --> 00:29:06,751
to be around people like you and Lydia.

608
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:10,257
Then... eat a root or chant or whatever.

609
00:29:10,257 --> 00:29:11,533
It's not gonna help, okay?

610
00:29:11,533 --> 00:29:12,304
Why not?

611
00:29:12,304 --> 00:29:14,474
Because you are exactly like my family.

612
00:29:16,712 --> 00:29:18,215
My name is not Rashi.

613
00:29:19,015 --> 00:29:21,602
It's Herbert Brickmeyer,

614
00:29:21,603 --> 00:29:23,720
from Levittown, Long Island,

615
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,123
and that energy in your kitchen...

616
00:29:25,123 --> 00:29:26,803
that was pure Brickmeyer,

617
00:29:26,803 --> 00:29:28,538
and I can't be around that again.

618
00:29:28,538 --> 00:29:30,535
Okay. Okay, first of all,

619
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:34,313
Lydia doesn't act like that when
I'm not pushing her buttons.

620
00:29:34,313 --> 00:29:36,134
And even if she did, work it out.

621
00:29:36,134 --> 00:29:37,799
That's what a relationship is.

622
00:29:38,208 --> 00:29:40,113
And you're a relationship expert?

623
00:29:41,313 --> 00:29:43,296
I'm an expert on screwing them up.

624
00:29:46,167 --> 00:29:48,002
I'm guessing it took you a while

625
00:29:48,002 --> 00:29:51,176
to stop being a crazy
Long Island Brickmeyer,

626
00:29:51,281 --> 00:29:54,162
so give Lydia a little time
to find her bliss, too.

627
00:30:01,163 --> 00:30:02,534
I'll think about it.

628
00:30:05,037 --> 00:30:06,126
All this talk about my family's

629
00:30:06,127 --> 00:30:07,788
got me really jonesing for a cigarette.

630
00:30:07,789 --> 00:30:09,150
You wouldn't happen to...

631
00:30:10,037 --> 00:30:11,352
Sorry, Herb.

632
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:25,325
Hi.

633
00:30:25,327 --> 00:30:26,312
Hi.

634
00:30:29,887 --> 00:30:32,410
- What?
- Rashi called.

635
00:30:32,419 --> 00:30:34,776
He had an epiphany during the retreat.

636
00:30:35,004 --> 00:30:38,715
He knows I'm changing,
and he's willing to be patient.

637
00:30:44,246 --> 00:30:46,012
He's right. You are changing.

638
00:30:46,013 --> 00:30:48,596
I have never seen you like this before.

639
00:30:49,327 --> 00:30:49,943
Really?

640
00:30:49,944 --> 00:30:52,237
Yeah, really, honey.

641
00:30:52,345 --> 00:30:53,422
I think...

642
00:30:55,002 --> 00:30:58,106
I think that is why I have
been so rotten to you.

643
00:30:59,304 --> 00:31:00,604
I'm jealous.

644
00:31:04,966 --> 00:31:05,929
Why?

645
00:31:07,936 --> 00:31:11,926
I don't get in relationships, Lydia.
I get on them.

646
00:31:11,993 --> 00:31:15,283
I mount them and grab them by the hair

647
00:31:15,284 --> 00:31:16,961
and kick them in the sides

648
00:31:16,962 --> 00:31:19,246
until I make them go where I want.

649
00:31:19,247 --> 00:31:21,450
And god help the other person

650
00:31:21,451 --> 00:31:23,668
if they have a different idea than me.

651
00:31:24,923 --> 00:31:26,988
Is that what happened with you and Tom?

652
00:31:29,458 --> 00:31:30,813
Oh, yeah.

653
00:31:33,464 --> 00:31:36,158
You can change, too, Lynette.

654
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:39,131
I don't know if I can.

655
00:31:39,709 --> 00:31:41,999
I'm pretty sure this
is as good as it gets.

656
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,412
No, Lynette.

657
00:31:43,413 --> 00:31:46,513
No, because you recognize
your problem now.

658
00:31:47,996 --> 00:31:50,216
And a wise man once said

659
00:31:50,669 --> 00:31:52,333
that to begin the journey of change,

660
00:31:52,334 --> 00:31:55,519
we must pull on
the boots of self-awareness.

661
00:31:58,096 --> 00:32:00,472
And was that wise man Rashi?

662
00:32:01,899 --> 00:32:03,523
Isn't he adorable?

663
00:32:10,381 --> 00:32:11,996
And when he talks to Scout and Jim,

664
00:32:11,997 --> 00:32:13,987
you know he doesn't wanna
just do the right thing

665
00:32:13,988 --> 00:32:16,876
for the community. He wants to
do the right thing as a father.

666
00:32:16,877 --> 00:32:19,196
I know. It's like when Gregory Peck

667
00:32:19,197 --> 00:32:21,938
looks at those kids,
you can tell that he's...

668
00:32:21,939 --> 00:32:23,296
Gregory Peck?

669
00:32:24,465 --> 00:32:25,850
You didn't actually
read the book, did you?

670
00:32:25,851 --> 00:32:30,287
Yeah. I started, and then it was on cable.

671
00:32:31,571 --> 00:32:34,408
I'm sorry. It's just too many pages.

672
00:32:34,704 --> 00:32:35,661
Mike.

673
00:32:35,961 --> 00:32:37,130
What?

674
00:32:38,646 --> 00:32:40,595
Oh, god. He's turning around!

675
00:32:40,902 --> 00:32:41,856
Okay.

676
00:32:43,471 --> 00:32:46,008
Uh... Okay, come on.

677
00:32:53,739 --> 00:32:54,770
Do you think he saw us?

678
00:32:54,771 --> 00:32:55,731
I don't know.

679
00:32:57,828 --> 00:32:59,583
I don't see his truck. I think he left.

680
00:32:59,989 --> 00:33:01,118
Oh, thank god.

681
00:33:02,114 --> 00:33:03,604
Wow, that was close.

682
00:33:04,686 --> 00:33:06,228
Yeah, my heart's pounding.

683
00:33:06,422 --> 00:33:07,980
I know. I can feel it.

684
00:33:13,852 --> 00:33:15,278
What is going on here?

685
00:33:17,967 --> 00:33:18,961
Nothing.

686
00:33:21,521 --> 00:33:22,726
Are you sure?

687
00:33:23,535 --> 00:33:26,227
Yeah. We're just two friends

688
00:33:26,228 --> 00:33:28,383
who are going through
a tough time and are trying to

689
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:30,846
help each other through it, right?

690
00:33:32,805 --> 00:33:34,592
Then why are we hiding
in the back of a van

691
00:33:34,593 --> 00:33:35,998
from my husband?

692
00:33:42,195 --> 00:33:44,397
I don't think we should do this anymore.

693
00:33:45,817 --> 00:33:46,859
Yeah.

694
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,158
Mike! What are you doing?

695
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:55,930
When you're done helping your boyfriend,

696
00:33:56,204 --> 00:33:57,490
we need to talk.

697
00:33:59,623 --> 00:34:00,249
You okay?

698
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:01,269
Yeah.

699
00:34:08,681 --> 00:34:09,716
Hello.

700
00:34:10,952 --> 00:34:12,142
How was your day?

701
00:34:12,548 --> 00:34:14,156
It was a little stressful.

702
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:16,172
Ah. Mine, too.

703
00:34:17,319 --> 00:34:21,188
We need to unwind.
How about a nice, long walk?

704
00:34:21,364 --> 00:34:22,701
I have a better idea.

705
00:34:22,702 --> 00:34:25,125
There's someplace special
I'd like to take you.

706
00:34:25,828 --> 00:34:27,948
Oh? Where?

707
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:32,962
It's a surprise.

708
00:34:34,432 --> 00:34:36,462
I don't really like surprises.

709
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:39,690
I do. Shall we?

710
00:34:40,212 --> 00:34:41,159
Now?

711
00:34:41,961 --> 00:34:44,163
Uh, can I freshen up first?

712
00:34:44,164 --> 00:34:46,091
You look plenty fresh to me.

713
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:48,626
But I've been in these clothes all day.

714
00:34:48,627 --> 00:34:50,210
I'd really like to change.

715
00:34:51,112 --> 00:34:53,881
Okay. Don't keep me waiting.

716
00:35:02,554 --> 00:35:04,072
Bree, have you left yet?

717
00:35:04,073 --> 00:35:05,798
New plan. He's taking me out,

718
00:35:05,799 --> 00:35:07,429
and he's got the envelope.

719
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:08,873
- Where are you going?
- He won't say,

720
00:35:08,874 --> 00:35:10,317
but if he wrote that letter,

721
00:35:10,318 --> 00:35:12,581
and he's bringing me somewhere
with the evidence...

722
00:35:12,582 --> 00:35:14,505
This is when he gives you the shakedown!

723
00:35:14,506 --> 00:35:15,719
I'll follow you.

724
00:35:20,183 --> 00:35:21,740
I thought you were gonna change.

725
00:35:22,278 --> 00:35:23,364
I did.

726
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,786
My attitude. I didn't wanna go,

727
00:35:25,787 --> 00:35:27,765
but now I do.

728
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:44,693
Uh, what about that...
that table in the corner?

729
00:35:44,694 --> 00:35:45,570
We'd like some privacy.

730
00:35:45,571 --> 00:35:48,110
No, no, no, no. I hate privacy.

731
00:35:48,111 --> 00:35:50,985
I like noise and bustle
and lots of people.

732
00:35:50,986 --> 00:35:53,135
How about this one in the middle?

733
00:35:54,404 --> 00:35:55,598
Whatever you say.

734
00:36:04,181 --> 00:36:06,826
Oh, aren't you warm in that jacket?

735
00:36:06,986 --> 00:36:08,320
Actually, a little.

736
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:21,181
So, um, let's order first,
and then we can talk.

737
00:36:26,656 --> 00:36:29,021
Don't these appetizers sound delicious?

738
00:36:29,022 --> 00:36:30,877
Yum! Escargot, and I...

739
00:36:30,878 --> 00:36:32,537
I love onion soup.

740
00:36:32,538 --> 00:36:36,310
But it'll be hard to pass
up on the beef tartare.

741
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:40,642
Rustic country pate. Look.

742
00:36:40,753 --> 00:36:41,626
Uh, what am I looking at?

743
00:36:41,627 --> 00:36:44,233
It just says "Rustic country pate."

744
00:36:45,428 --> 00:36:47,501
Maybe we should look on
the left side of the menu.

745
00:36:47,502 --> 00:36:50,702
I definitely think we'll find
something good on the left side.

746
00:36:50,703 --> 00:36:53,519
We didn't get a wine list.
Where's our waiter?

747
00:37:06,105 --> 00:37:07,288
I'll be right back.

748
00:37:07,289 --> 00:37:08,370
Wait. Where... where are you going?

749
00:37:08,371 --> 00:37:09,786
To freshen up.

750
00:37:09,787 --> 00:37:10,893
Again?

751
00:37:18,059 --> 00:37:19,357
What do you think's in there?

752
00:37:19,358 --> 00:37:22,012
What if it's a bone? You open it!

753
00:37:29,674 --> 00:37:30,857
Oh, no.

754
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:33,202
Maybe it's a tooth?

755
00:37:36,328 --> 00:37:38,275
Ohh. The picture of my hand...

756
00:37:38,276 --> 00:37:40,781
He was trying to figure out my ring size.

757
00:37:40,886 --> 00:37:43,505
Well, this doesn't necessarily
mean he didn't send the letter.

758
00:37:43,527 --> 00:37:44,898
I think it does.

759
00:37:44,899 --> 00:37:46,339
Okay, well, this is a relief, right?

760
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:48,939
I mean, at least
he's not blackmailing you.

761
00:37:49,214 --> 00:37:51,801
No, it means he wants to marry me.

762
00:37:52,526 --> 00:37:53,870
So what are you gonna do?

763
00:37:55,078 --> 00:37:56,307
I like Chuck, but he's not the man

764
00:37:56,308 --> 00:37:58,632
I wanna spend the rest of my life with.

765
00:37:59,207 --> 00:38:02,435
You can go. I'll do my
best to let him down easy.

766
00:38:03,141 --> 00:38:06,079
Some rock, and on a cop's salary?

767
00:38:08,048 --> 00:38:09,550
But you should still dump him.

768
00:38:17,575 --> 00:38:18,619
Mike.

769
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,919
If you're gonna say it, say it fast.

770
00:38:21,523 --> 00:38:23,440
There is no fast way to say it, buddy.

771
00:38:25,017 --> 00:38:26,370
What the hell are you doing here?

772
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:29,974
We're finally gonna tell you the truth.

773
00:38:39,414 --> 00:38:41,485
About a month ago,
the progressive dinner...

774
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:42,984
you remember that night?

775
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:45,650
Just get to the part that's the truth.

776
00:38:48,905 --> 00:38:51,422
I killed Gaby's stepfather.

777
00:38:53,816 --> 00:38:56,038
And me and the girls helped cover it up.

778
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:09,081
I'm sorry that took so long.

779
00:39:09,082 --> 00:39:10,796
Oh, that... that-that's all right.

780
00:39:13,064 --> 00:39:14,819
It actually gave me a chance

781
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:17,949
to have a scotch and a glass of red wine.

782
00:39:18,052 --> 00:39:19,542
Calm my nerves a little.

783
00:39:19,673 --> 00:39:21,413
God, I wish I could have a drink.

784
00:39:22,309 --> 00:39:24,240
Why? What are you nervous about?

785
00:39:24,979 --> 00:39:27,874
I have something important to say.

786
00:39:28,078 --> 00:39:30,518
Huh. Um, I-I wonder

787
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:32,521
If it's the same thing that I'm gonna say.

788
00:39:32,522 --> 00:39:34,454
I'm pretty sure it's not.

789
00:39:36,266 --> 00:39:38,599
Chuck, you are a wonderful man,

790
00:39:38,962 --> 00:39:41,321
and I have enjoyed
our time together, but...

791
00:39:41,322 --> 00:39:42,593
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

792
00:39:42,594 --> 00:39:43,858
Are you... are you...

793
00:39:45,255 --> 00:39:46,490
you're dumping me?

794
00:39:50,466 --> 00:39:51,522
I was...

795
00:39:52,867 --> 00:39:54,708
I was about to propose to you.

796
00:39:55,169 --> 00:39:56,730
I'm sorry if I misled you...

797
00:39:56,731 --> 00:39:59,462
Hey, there's a fake apology.
You did mislead me.

798
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:00,664
Chuck, please...

799
00:40:00,665 --> 00:40:02,412
You know, it's like you're two people.

800
00:40:02,524 --> 00:40:03,896
There's the woman I have fun with,

801
00:40:03,897 --> 00:40:06,854
who I really... I really connect to,

802
00:40:06,855 --> 00:40:07,912
and there's this other woman who's...

803
00:40:07,913 --> 00:40:11,276
who's, uh, who's mysterious and-and weird

804
00:40:11,277 --> 00:40:14,393
and keeps sneaking out to "Run errands."

805
00:40:16,234 --> 00:40:18,039
There's another guy, isn't there?

806
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:20,301
No. I assure you, there's no one else.

807
00:40:20,302 --> 00:40:21,819
Don't lie to me!

808
00:40:26,092 --> 00:40:27,835
Was he the one who sent you that letter?

809
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:29,407
What letter?

810
00:40:29,408 --> 00:40:31,443
The one that you, uh,
you were reading the other night,

811
00:40:31,444 --> 00:40:33,053
you got all shook up about...

812
00:40:33,054 --> 00:40:34,126
Was that from him?

813
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:36,675
There is no "Him."

814
00:40:36,676 --> 00:40:38,362
You know, Bree,

815
00:40:38,363 --> 00:40:39,742
I would've done anything for you.

816
00:40:40,785 --> 00:40:43,729
I protect the people that I care about.

817
00:40:45,232 --> 00:40:47,134
I don't care about you now.

818
00:40:48,939 --> 00:40:50,943
So if you find yourself in trouble,

819
00:40:52,145 --> 00:40:54,441
and I'm pretty sure
that someday you will...

820
00:40:56,414 --> 00:40:58,208
Then don't come calling me.

821
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:03,462
You have made a very big mistake.

822
00:41:10,008 --> 00:41:13,045
<i>Yes, the residents of Wisteria Lane</i>

823
00:41:13,046 --> 00:41:15,912
<i>are skilled at the art of concealment.</i>

824
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:20,208
<i>They know how to cover</i>

825
00:41:20,209 --> 00:41:23,295
<i>the evidence of a messy breakup...</i>

826
00:41:27,329 --> 00:41:31,018
<i>to compensate for what their
children might be missing...</i>

827
00:41:34,327 --> 00:41:36,883
<i>and to spare the feelings of a loved one</i>

828
00:41:36,884 --> 00:41:39,638
<i>whose taste they may not share.</i>

829
00:41:42,517 --> 00:41:43,746
<i>But for some,</i>

830
00:41:43,747 --> 00:41:48,158
<i>the art of concealment
comes at too great a cost.</i>

831
00:41:48,834 --> 00:41:53,747
<i>And so they find themselves
forced to reveal the truth...</i>

832
00:41:56,019 --> 00:42:01,960
<i>even at the risk of facing
an uncertain future.</i>
