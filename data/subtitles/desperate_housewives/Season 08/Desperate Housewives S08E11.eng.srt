1
00:00:01,593 --> 00:00:03,820
<i>Previously on...</i>

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:06,496
<i>Susan left town with a secret agenda.</i>

3
00:00:06,496 --> 00:00:07,504
Where are you off to?

4
00:00:07,744 --> 00:00:09,842
I'm just visiting some family.

5
00:00:09,842 --> 00:00:10,825
Well, have a good trip.

6
00:00:11,973 --> 00:00:14,207
<i>Carlos was headed back to rehab.</i>

7
00:00:14,207 --> 00:00:15,276
You just worry about getting better.

8
00:00:15,276 --> 00:00:17,293
I can hold down the fort, no problem.

9
00:00:18,295 --> 00:00:21,115
<i>Tom's trip with
his girlfriend was encouraged.</i>

10
00:00:21,115 --> 00:00:22,557
I think you should go to Paris.

11
00:00:23,588 --> 00:00:27,446
<i>And Bree received another
mysterious letter.</i>

12
00:00:34,886 --> 00:00:37,867
<i>It's always easy to know
who our friends are.</i>

13
00:00:38,737 --> 00:00:41,929
<i>They're the ones who tell us
when we look ridiculous....</i>

14
00:00:44,023 --> 00:00:46,419
<i>or when we're deluding ourselves...</i>

15
00:00:48,396 --> 00:00:50,453
<i>or when we've had enough.</i>

16
00:00:53,023 --> 00:00:56,354
<i>But only the best of friends
will tell you the truth,</i>

17
00:00:56,779 --> 00:00:58,275
<i>even when they know...</i>

18
00:00:58,690 --> 00:00:59,512
What the hell is this?

19
00:00:59,805 --> 00:01:01,132
<i>It will upset you.</i>

20
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:04,137
That's what I found in my mailbox.

21
00:01:04,621 --> 00:01:06,801
"You're welcome"? I don't understand.

22
00:01:06,801 --> 00:01:08,943
Don't you recognize the stationery?

23
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:11,347
It's the same as Mary Alice's letter,

24
00:01:11,347 --> 00:01:13,535
and I got it right after Chuck's funeral.

25
00:01:13,535 --> 00:01:15,606
You think this is who killed Chuck?

26
00:01:15,606 --> 00:01:17,867
Well, it's the only logical explanation.

27
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:20,460
There's nothing logical about any of this.

28
00:01:20,885 --> 00:01:22,628
Don't you remember the first note?

29
00:01:22,628 --> 00:01:25,149
Yeah, whoever wrote
that was threatening us.

30
00:01:25,149 --> 00:01:26,870
Exactly. So now all of a sudden,

31
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,406
this person who "Knows what we did"

32
00:01:28,406 --> 00:01:31,287
and is "Going to tell"
is now killing cops for us?

33
00:01:31,287 --> 00:01:32,093
Doesn't make sense.

34
00:01:32,093 --> 00:01:33,597
Yeah, but the timing.

35
00:01:33,597 --> 00:01:34,897
It is weird.

36
00:01:38,404 --> 00:01:39,648
So what's the deal with us?

37
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:42,437
What do you mean?

38
00:01:43,007 --> 00:01:44,322
Are we still mad at each other?

39
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:46,872
I think so.

40
00:01:48,228 --> 00:01:49,582
Okay. Just asking.

41
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,483
Well, what are we gonna do about this?

44
00:01:57,554 --> 00:01:58,763
We don't know what they're gonna do next.

45
00:01:59,199 --> 00:02:00,486
Is there anything we do know?

46
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:04,368
Well... we know who these
letters are being sent to.

47
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:07,465
What's that supposed to mean?

48
00:02:07,665 --> 00:02:09,535
You're the one who keeps
finding these things.

49
00:02:09,535 --> 00:02:10,405
You tell me.

50
00:02:11,116 --> 00:02:13,174
I don't like your accusatory tone.

51
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:14,338
Well, I'd use a different tone,

52
00:02:14,338 --> 00:02:16,648
- but I'm trying to accuse you of something.
- Gaby!

53
00:02:16,648 --> 00:02:18,865
You have to admit, Bree,
there does seem to be a link

54
00:02:18,865 --> 00:02:21,484
between you and
Mr. Creepy letter writing guy.

55
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,782
I don't believe this.

56
00:02:22,782 --> 00:02:24,789
Why else would they keep
sending you the notes?

57
00:02:24,789 --> 00:02:26,854
Why not send copies to all of us?

58
00:02:26,854 --> 00:02:28,588
This is not about me.

59
00:02:28,588 --> 00:02:30,988
And if you two are gonna
just sit there and blame me

60
00:02:30,988 --> 00:02:33,507
for the actions of some
psychopath, then...

61
00:02:36,021 --> 00:02:36,996
I'm just gonna go home.

62
00:02:42,487 --> 00:02:44,656
I say we forgive each other
and just stay mad at Bree.

63
00:02:44,656 --> 00:02:45,647
Done.

64
00:02:46,254 --> 00:02:49,768
<i>Yes, only your friends
will tell you the truth.</i>

65
00:02:50,106 --> 00:02:53,459
<i>So when they warn you
about someone suspicious,</i>

66
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:58,576
<i>maybe you should listen to them.</i>

67
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:15,718
<i>Susan Delfino was on a mission,</i>

68
00:03:16,302 --> 00:03:19,583
<i>and she had planned it
down to the last detail.</i>

69
00:03:20,763 --> 00:03:22,809
<i>She brought the proper identification,</i>

70
00:03:24,484 --> 00:03:26,623
<i>she mapped out the correct route,</i>

71
00:03:28,242 --> 00:03:31,575
<i>and she brought plenty
of cash for emergencies.</i>

72
00:03:33,085 --> 00:03:36,246
<i>But the one small detail
she hadn't planned...</i>

73
00:03:37,053 --> 00:03:39,431
<i>was what to do once she got there.</i>

74
00:03:40,446 --> 00:03:41,759
Mike, I've got a problem.

75
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:44,033
Oh, what's wrong?
You can't find the house?

76
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:46,504
No, I'm standing in front of it right now.

77
00:03:47,091 --> 00:03:48,154
Then what's the problem?

78
00:03:48,614 --> 00:03:51,293
I have no idea how to get inside.

79
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:54,246
You just spent an entire day on a plane.

80
00:03:54,246 --> 00:03:55,651
You didn't give this any thought at all?

81
00:03:55,651 --> 00:03:58,478
I was going to, and then I got caught up

82
00:03:58,478 --> 00:03:59,677
in an in-flight movie.

83
00:04:00,028 --> 00:04:01,173
It was about a dolphin

84
00:04:01,173 --> 00:04:03,494
who joins an inner city
water polo team, and...

85
00:04:03,753 --> 00:04:04,529
Susan!

86
00:04:04,529 --> 00:04:05,718
Oh, my God.

87
00:04:05,718 --> 00:04:08,341
This was the stupidest
idea ever, wasn't it?

88
00:04:08,341 --> 00:04:11,175
No, you did this because
you're a good person.

89
00:04:12,463 --> 00:04:14,570
Honey, just leave some
flowers and come back home.

90
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:17,230
I can't. I came here for a reason.

91
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,509
I have to make sure that
Alejandro's family is okay.

92
00:04:21,081 --> 00:04:24,081
I just need to figure out some
cover story to get in there.

93
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,934
You're a little early!

94
00:04:28,297 --> 00:04:30,435
Oh, couldn't want to take
the first look, could you?

95
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,383
What?

96
00:04:31,863 --> 00:04:35,224
Oh, relax. I'm okay with early birds.

97
00:04:35,536 --> 00:04:37,795
Connie Thomas, Thomas realty.

98
00:04:37,795 --> 00:04:40,826
Officially, the open house
doesn't start for an hour,

99
00:04:41,296 --> 00:04:43,655
but if you help me lay out
the finger sandwiches,

100
00:04:44,221 --> 00:04:47,533
I'll let you sneak
the first peek. Come on!

101
00:04:49,182 --> 00:04:52,061
Mike, I've gotta go.
I'm about to buy a house.

102
00:04:53,655 --> 00:04:55,764
Listen, all I'm asking
for is an extension.

103
00:04:56,275 --> 00:04:57,794
Once I get a model unit open,

104
00:04:57,794 --> 00:04:59,891
these condos are gonna
be selling like crazy.

105
00:05:03,186 --> 00:05:04,143
Hi. What's going on?

106
00:05:04,143 --> 00:05:06,111
Hey, I was sitting over at Bree's,

107
00:05:06,111 --> 00:05:08,265
and I thought... I miss him.

108
00:05:08,265 --> 00:05:10,169
Yeah, I miss you, too.

109
00:05:11,355 --> 00:05:12,477
But I can get the numbers for you.

110
00:05:12,477 --> 00:05:13,737
Hold on. Here.

111
00:05:15,674 --> 00:05:18,172
Uh, did you hear me? I said I miss you.

112
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,112
Uh, that's my girlfriend. Just... j...

113
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,825
Hey. I don't miss people.

114
00:05:25,314 --> 00:05:26,488
I forget them.

115
00:05:26,815 --> 00:05:29,273
I ignore them. I verbally abuse them,

116
00:05:29,273 --> 00:05:32,429
but I am definitely not a
missing-people kind of person.

117
00:05:32,826 --> 00:05:33,919
Can you hang on for a second?

118
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,954
Listen, I love that you miss me,
but I'm really busy right now.

119
00:05:36,954 --> 00:05:38,606
Talk later. Hey, you still there?

120
00:05:39,017 --> 00:05:41,164
Yeah, I've got the numbers right here.

121
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:42,926
Yeah. Yeah.

122
00:05:46,818 --> 00:05:49,379
Let me tell you what
the man from down under

123
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:52,178
who will never again be
down under just did to me.

124
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:55,360
What's wrong?

125
00:05:56,369 --> 00:05:57,021
Nothing.

126
00:05:57,654 --> 00:05:59,650
Oh, god, it's like pulling teeth.

127
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:02,862
I saw you talking to Gaby and Lynette.

128
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,645
Did they say something to upset you?

129
00:06:04,645 --> 00:06:06,519
I don't want to discuss it.

130
00:06:08,165 --> 00:06:09,871
They suggested botox, didn't they?

131
00:06:09,871 --> 00:06:11,632
No. Why would you say that?

132
00:06:11,932 --> 00:06:13,870
You're having wine before lunch.

133
00:06:14,193 --> 00:06:17,044
That's what I did the first time
someone said I needed botox.

134
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:19,025
Yes, I am upset, but it's private,

135
00:06:19,025 --> 00:06:21,297
and I wanna process it... privately.

136
00:06:22,363 --> 00:06:24,683
Ohh, keeping stuff inside
is how you ended up

137
00:06:24,683 --> 00:06:26,042
in that motel with a gun.

138
00:06:26,448 --> 00:06:29,307
Relax. I am no longer suicidal.

139
00:06:29,921 --> 00:06:31,337
You don't wanna talk? Fine.

140
00:06:31,631 --> 00:06:34,079
But I'm not gonna let you sit
here for the next few days

141
00:06:34,392 --> 00:06:36,610
moping about god knows what.

142
00:06:37,132 --> 00:06:38,144
We're going out.

143
00:06:39,268 --> 00:06:40,032
What?

144
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,577
I know all sorts of naughty places

145
00:06:42,577 --> 00:06:44,573
filled with all sorts of naughty men.

146
00:06:44,874 --> 00:06:47,369
Be ready to leave by 8:00
and try to wear something

147
00:06:47,369 --> 00:06:49,469
that doesn't scream "Frigid schoolmarm."

148
00:06:49,469 --> 00:06:50,973
No! No, no, listen to me.

149
00:06:51,406 --> 00:06:53,947
I don't wanna go out.
I don't wanna talk about my feelings,

150
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:56,260
and I don't want you here anymore,
so please...

151
00:06:57,309 --> 00:06:58,183
go home.

152
00:07:01,574 --> 00:07:02,871
Another glass of wine?

153
00:07:07,707 --> 00:07:09,424
It's just, I've never seen you drink.

154
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:12,610
You know what? You're right.
I could use a night out.

155
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:13,662
Really?

156
00:07:13,662 --> 00:07:16,819
Yes, but my wardrobe is a bit frosty.

157
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:19,130
Do you think you could
run back to your house

158
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,013
and find something in your closet for me?

159
00:07:21,434 --> 00:07:23,059
Something sexy.

160
00:07:23,059 --> 00:07:25,619
Absolutely. Oh, Bree, you'll see.

161
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:29,020
A night out is exactly what
you need to lift your spirits.

162
00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:50,875
I'm tired.

163
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,065
I know, sweetie.

164
00:07:52,453 --> 00:07:54,720
Trying to teach you
the value of hard work.

165
00:08:00,025 --> 00:08:02,617
If you're wondering why
I'm pushing the leaves

166
00:08:02,617 --> 00:08:04,829
over to Ms. Kinsky's house,

167
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,067
it's 'cause I'm trying to teach her

168
00:08:06,067 --> 00:08:07,490
the value of hard work, too.

169
00:08:10,476 --> 00:08:12,512
Mrs. Solis, hello.

170
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,681
Hey... Carlos' secretary.

171
00:08:16,107 --> 00:08:16,642
Marilyn.

172
00:08:16,642 --> 00:08:18,698
Marilyn, of course. Yes. I knew that.

173
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,224
What can I do for you, Marilyn?

174
00:08:20,224 --> 00:08:21,092
I was in the neighborhood,

175
00:08:21,092 --> 00:08:23,264
and I thought I'd bring by Mr. Solis' mail.

176
00:08:23,264 --> 00:08:24,826
- Thank you.
- By the way,

177
00:08:25,145 --> 00:08:27,203
any chance that tomorrow
he can get out of his...

178
00:08:27,617 --> 00:08:28,440
rehab?

179
00:08:29,365 --> 00:08:31,271
Why do you need Carlos?
He's been trying to land

180
00:08:31,271 --> 00:08:33,159
this british firm as a client for months.

181
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,492
They're in town for a couple of days,

182
00:08:34,492 --> 00:08:36,357
and I think a little wining and dining

183
00:08:36,357 --> 00:08:37,457
would seal the deal.

184
00:08:37,457 --> 00:08:39,764
Well, I don't think it's a good idea to

185
00:08:39,764 --> 00:08:42,238
spring Carlos out of rehab for "Wining."

186
00:08:42,728 --> 00:08:44,424
Isn't there someone else
who can meet with them?

187
00:08:45,035 --> 00:08:46,129
What about the old guy?

188
00:08:46,129 --> 00:08:47,699
Robert? He retired.

189
00:08:48,165 --> 00:08:50,109
Oh. Oh! How about the fat chick?

190
00:08:50,109 --> 00:08:51,940
Celeste? Maternity leave.

191
00:08:53,027 --> 00:08:54,100
The nerve of these people.

192
00:08:55,313 --> 00:08:57,652
Sorry, Marilyn. You win some,
you lose some, right?

193
00:08:58,141 --> 00:08:59,263
Except in this case,

194
00:08:59,263 --> 00:09:01,383
we're losing a $90 million account.

195
00:09:04,057 --> 00:09:05,396
$90 million?

196
00:09:08,391 --> 00:09:10,881
And you think all it will take
is a little wining and dining?

197
00:09:13,479 --> 00:09:14,722
Why don't you go ahead
and set up that meeting?

198
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:15,636
I have an idea.

199
00:09:15,658 --> 00:09:16,962
Okay, I'll get right on it.

200
00:09:20,737 --> 00:09:22,927
Do you know why the owners are selling?

201
00:09:24,321 --> 00:09:26,393
That's a bit of a scandal.

202
00:09:26,393 --> 00:09:27,754
I really shouldn't say.

203
00:09:28,925 --> 00:09:29,476
Okay.

204
00:09:30,829 --> 00:09:34,637
The husband disappeared four months ago,

205
00:09:34,637 --> 00:09:36,606
and he hasn't been heard from since.

206
00:09:36,606 --> 00:09:39,811
I think it's drugs or maybe another woman.

207
00:09:40,995 --> 00:09:41,858
Could be anything.

208
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:44,610
Poor child.

209
00:09:45,095 --> 00:09:46,089
Stepchild.

210
00:09:46,632 --> 00:09:48,939
Oh, but you got the "Poor" part right.

211
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,993
The wife had to take a second job,

212
00:09:51,662 --> 00:09:54,450
and now she still can't
even make ends meet.

213
00:09:56,188 --> 00:09:56,989
Yeah.

214
00:09:57,485 --> 00:09:59,143
Tell the buyers how desperate we are.

215
00:09:59,143 --> 00:10:00,651
That'll jack up the sale price.

216
00:10:01,046 --> 00:10:03,636
Oh. Mrs. Sanchez, so sorry.

217
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:05,708
I didn't realize you
were coming back so soon.

218
00:10:05,947 --> 00:10:06,761
I bet.

219
00:10:07,997 --> 00:10:10,214
By the way, you dropped some
of your flyers on my lawn.

220
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:12,660
Oh, I should get those. Excuse me.

221
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:20,567
It's not completely her fault.
I was sort of... prying.

222
00:10:20,567 --> 00:10:21,361
Sorry.

223
00:10:21,874 --> 00:10:23,500
Are you sorry enough to buy my house?

224
00:10:24,274 --> 00:10:27,253
Oh, well, uh... actually, I was...

225
00:10:28,464 --> 00:10:30,079
looking for something a little larger.

226
00:10:31,818 --> 00:10:32,720
Well, that's too bad.

227
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:42,723
Maybe, uh, there's something
that I can do for you.

228
00:10:45,525 --> 00:10:49,799
Because... I am a
collector of Americana...

229
00:10:50,263 --> 00:10:53,179
and some of your fabulous knickknacks

230
00:10:53,179 --> 00:10:54,811
have really caught my eye.

231
00:10:55,236 --> 00:10:56,863
I have fabulous knickknacks?

232
00:10:56,863 --> 00:10:58,126
You sure do.

233
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:02,652
Like-like this, for instance.

234
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:04,853
Those are Legos.

235
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:07,465
I know what they are.

236
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,878
But what you don't know

237
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:14,198
is that these are... phase one Legos.

238
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:15,415
Very rare.

239
00:11:17,169 --> 00:11:18,725
I would love to buy them

240
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,271
if you're willing to sell.

241
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:22,992
Seriously?

242
00:11:24,162 --> 00:11:27,585
'Cause I got, like,
a whole coffee can full of those.

243
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:30,615
That's... jackpot.

244
00:11:30,615 --> 00:11:34,242
Oh! I-I, um, I will take them all.

245
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:35,701
Hey, Marisa!

246
00:11:36,205 --> 00:11:36,997
What?

247
00:11:36,997 --> 00:11:38,733
This lady's buying all your old Legos.

248
00:11:38,733 --> 00:11:40,768
You still have that box
full of headless barbies?

249
00:11:40,768 --> 00:11:42,711
Oh! Oh, that's okay. I'm good. Uh...

250
00:11:43,952 --> 00:11:45,629
here... is your check.

251
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,722
Oh, I think you added an extra zero.

252
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,390
That's because I...
I wanna do something to help.

253
00:11:55,707 --> 00:11:58,305
You know, because of your... situation.

254
00:11:58,305 --> 00:11:59,886
Look, whatever my realtor said,

255
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:00,962
you don't gotta feel sorry for me.

256
00:12:00,962 --> 00:12:02,302
I know my husband will come back.

257
00:12:03,417 --> 00:12:08,245
But... on the off chance
that he... doesn't,

258
00:12:09,476 --> 00:12:11,814
please, take my check.

259
00:12:14,598 --> 00:12:16,332
Okay. Thank you.

260
00:12:19,225 --> 00:12:21,040
But stop giving me the sad eyes.

261
00:12:21,613 --> 00:12:23,890
Ramon does this sort
of thing all the time.

262
00:12:24,316 --> 00:12:25,940
He goes on a little bender,
then comes home,

263
00:12:26,234 --> 00:12:29,434
but mostly, he's a good
husband and a loving father.

264
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:43,863
Well, thank you again.

265
00:12:45,311 --> 00:12:46,241
It was a...

266
00:12:46,876 --> 00:12:49,094
pleasure doing business with you.

267
00:12:50,162 --> 00:12:51,335
You've really helped us out.

268
00:13:04,971 --> 00:13:06,016
Wow, that smells great.

269
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,473
Where'd you learn to make a pot pie?

270
00:13:07,473 --> 00:13:10,231
I looked it up on a little place
you kids call the internet.

271
00:13:10,688 --> 00:13:11,923
This is nice, huh?

272
00:13:12,138 --> 00:13:13,432
Perfect family dinner.

273
00:13:19,635 --> 00:13:20,559
It's doing it again.

274
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:22,393
No, it's not. Everything's perfect.

275
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:23,913
It's flickering, mom.

276
00:13:24,256 --> 00:13:25,893
Had to happen while dad
was in Paris, right?

277
00:13:25,893 --> 00:13:28,016
Hey! What's that supposed to mean?

278
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:30,412
I can handle it.
I'll just do what your dad does.

279
00:13:31,719 --> 00:13:32,842
What does your dad do?

280
00:13:33,537 --> 00:13:36,458
He goes to the circuit box and...
jiggles something.

281
00:13:40,292 --> 00:13:41,304
I can do that.

282
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:48,440
You know exactly what he
jiggles or... Never mind.

283
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,199
I'll do it.

284
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:51,242
Anything?

285
00:13:52,115 --> 00:13:54,704
- You're making it worse.
- Wait, wait.

286
00:13:54,948 --> 00:13:56,321
This is it. This is definitely it.

287
00:14:02,473 --> 00:14:03,806
Well, it stopped flickering.

288
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,484
What time is it in Paris?

289
00:14:05,484 --> 00:14:07,992
No. We are not going to call your dad.

290
00:14:07,992 --> 00:14:09,513
We just need some flashlights.

291
00:14:10,405 --> 00:14:12,223
Where does your dad keep the flashlights?

292
00:14:21,621 --> 00:14:22,354
Boss.

293
00:14:22,354 --> 00:14:24,594
Hi, Mike. Everything okay?

294
00:14:24,594 --> 00:14:26,746
Well, I, uh, I just bounced a check.

295
00:14:27,322 --> 00:14:28,115
Ouch.

296
00:14:28,115 --> 00:14:30,958
and it was to buy bats for M.J.'s
little league team, so...

297
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,520
- Embarrassing.
- Exactly.

298
00:14:32,582 --> 00:14:34,642
So I called my bank to tear 'em a new one,

299
00:14:34,642 --> 00:14:35,968
and they told me my last paycheck

300
00:14:35,968 --> 00:14:37,858
was returned for insufficient funds...

301
00:14:39,054 --> 00:14:39,968
boss.

302
00:14:40,523 --> 00:14:42,623
Oh. Look, uh...

303
00:14:44,086 --> 00:14:45,140
Let me cover that for you.

304
00:14:46,229 --> 00:14:48,608
I'm sorry about that.
I don't know what could have happened.

305
00:14:48,608 --> 00:14:49,868
I just switched banks.

306
00:14:49,868 --> 00:14:51,702
Maybe there was some kind of
problem with the transfer.

307
00:14:53,608 --> 00:14:54,660
You sure that's it?

308
00:14:55,418 --> 00:14:58,297
I know the condo project's
going a little slow.

309
00:14:58,297 --> 00:14:59,274
Is everything okay?

310
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:02,196
Absolutely. Nothing to worry about. Here.

311
00:15:02,988 --> 00:15:04,343
Grab the kids a few extra bats.

312
00:15:04,343 --> 00:15:07,864
Oh, no, I don't need a tip.
Uh, just-just my pay.

313
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:20,757
Did you fix it?

314
00:15:20,792 --> 00:15:22,859
No, but I figured out it's not the light,

315
00:15:22,859 --> 00:15:23,981
so I'm going over the blueprints

316
00:15:23,981 --> 00:15:25,719
to find out where the real problem is.

317
00:15:25,719 --> 00:15:27,726
Or you could just call an electrician.

318
00:15:28,148 --> 00:15:29,333
Why do that?

319
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,311
I went on the internet.
I did a little research.

320
00:15:31,676 --> 00:15:33,458
And other than a few
electrocution stories,

321
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:34,660
it doesn't sound that hard.

322
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:36,587
Seems like a lot of work.

323
00:15:37,253 --> 00:15:40,356
All dad had to do was... jiggle something.

324
00:15:41,225 --> 00:15:44,336
You know, the jiggle is just a band-aid.

325
00:15:44,868 --> 00:15:46,231
That was your dad's
approach to everything.

326
00:15:46,231 --> 00:15:48,112
Just patch it up and pretend it's fixed.

327
00:15:48,112 --> 00:15:51,074
That's why we've had these
problems all these years.

328
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,652
The light. I'm talking about the light.

329
00:15:57,828 --> 00:15:59,270
At least the doorbell's working again.

330
00:16:00,702 --> 00:16:03,161
Hey! How are you?

331
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,509
That's the "Hey" that means
"I need something."

332
00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:08,852
No, come on. This is important.

333
00:16:10,299 --> 00:16:12,668
Okay, Carlos is away, and I need
some help with his business,

334
00:16:13,036 --> 00:16:15,605
and you're the only friend
I have who knows this stuff.

335
00:16:15,606 --> 00:16:17,033
- What stuff?
- I don't know.

336
00:16:17,033 --> 00:16:18,884
Some big british company.

337
00:16:19,215 --> 00:16:20,299
Bennett something.

338
00:16:21,437 --> 00:16:22,350
The Bennett group?

339
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,276
Yeah! See? You get it.

340
00:16:24,594 --> 00:16:26,741
Anyway, they're on the verge
of signing with Carlos,

341
00:16:26,741 --> 00:16:28,055
and since he's not "Free,"

342
00:16:28,499 --> 00:16:30,357
I thought I'd take 'em to
dinner and close the deal.

343
00:16:30,696 --> 00:16:33,034
You? How would you even
know what to talk about?

344
00:16:33,777 --> 00:16:36,016
Hey, that's where you come in.

345
00:16:37,005 --> 00:16:38,138
You used to work for Carlos.

346
00:16:38,138 --> 00:16:39,678
Maybe you can give me a few pointers.

347
00:16:40,063 --> 00:16:43,327
I have spent my life learning
about the world of finance.

348
00:16:43,327 --> 00:16:45,155
I can't just teach it to
you in a couple of weeks.

349
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:47,575
Could you teach it to
me in a couple hours?

350
00:16:47,575 --> 00:16:48,762
'Cause the meeting's tomorrow.

351
00:16:49,617 --> 00:16:52,121
- Gaby.
- I'm a fast learner, I swear.

352
00:16:52,447 --> 00:16:54,439
And from what I understand,
the deal's as good as done.

353
00:16:54,439 --> 00:16:56,339
This is just a formality.

354
00:17:01,072 --> 00:17:02,368
Okay. Fine.

355
00:17:03,111 --> 00:17:04,656
Come back tonight after the kids are done.

356
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:05,785
I'll do my best.

357
00:17:05,785 --> 00:17:07,753
- Oh, you're the greatest.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

358
00:17:07,753 --> 00:17:09,030
Hey, could you at least bring...

359
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:11,142
Bring some wine.
I'm one step ahead of you.

360
00:17:11,142 --> 00:17:13,013
I was going to say Carlos' files.

361
00:17:13,013 --> 00:17:16,149
Oh, jeez. Those are at his office,

362
00:17:16,149 --> 00:17:17,827
and that's all the way across town.

363
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:20,355
Hey!

364
00:17:20,994 --> 00:17:21,795
No.

365
00:17:39,235 --> 00:17:42,221
I don't suppose the bartender
has any anti-bacterial wipes.

366
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,975
You can ask again, but I don't think so.

367
00:17:45,573 --> 00:17:46,848
Will you stop?

368
00:17:46,848 --> 00:17:50,142
The fun of a place like this is
getting germs on your elbows.

369
00:17:50,142 --> 00:17:51,456
I don't understand why anyone

370
00:17:51,456 --> 00:17:53,469
would want to come to a dive like this.

371
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:55,319
You say "Dive" like it's a bad word.

372
00:17:55,721 --> 00:17:57,646
Look around. People are having fun.

373
00:17:58,412 --> 00:18:01,985
Now look in that mirror, hmm? Not fun.

374
00:18:02,892 --> 00:18:04,882
Why are you so uptight?

375
00:18:04,882 --> 00:18:08,009
Well, compared to you,
a woman who paid for our drinks

376
00:18:08,009 --> 00:18:10,423
by... showing off the Bronte sisters.

377
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,083
The Bronte sisters?

378
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:15,610
Jeez. Even your boob jokes are repressed.

379
00:18:15,736 --> 00:18:16,886
What happened to you?

380
00:18:16,886 --> 00:18:18,341
Nothing happened to me.

381
00:18:18,341 --> 00:18:20,487
Well, someone made you this way.
Was it your mother?

382
00:18:20,487 --> 00:18:22,415
My mother passed away when I was 10.

383
00:18:22,415 --> 00:18:24,489
Ohh. That explains it.

384
00:18:24,823 --> 00:18:27,011
Remember my mom died
when I was a kid, too.

385
00:18:27,011 --> 00:18:29,280
When parents die,
you can go one of two ways...

386
00:18:29,301 --> 00:18:32,895
Daddy's little girl or
daddy's little nightmare.

387
00:18:33,617 --> 00:18:36,677
Well, I suppose my father did
have certain expectations.

388
00:18:36,677 --> 00:18:38,573
He... raised me to be a lady,

389
00:18:38,573 --> 00:18:40,439
and I've done my best to make him proud.

390
00:18:40,439 --> 00:18:41,873
Mm, hello, repression.

391
00:18:42,384 --> 00:18:44,926
Well, I'm glad that
he insisted on good behavior.

392
00:18:45,348 --> 00:18:47,044
Your dad is not here, Bree.

393
00:18:47,452 --> 00:18:49,368
No one's gonna tell him if you cut loose,

394
00:18:49,779 --> 00:18:51,014
have a little fun.

395
00:18:52,901 --> 00:18:55,481
You look hot in my dress.

396
00:18:55,911 --> 00:18:59,524
Be bad. Be naughty. Hit on a stranger.

397
00:18:59,524 --> 00:19:01,672
I wouldn't take a breath
mint from these people...

398
00:19:03,363 --> 00:19:05,254
As if any of them would have one.

399
00:19:05,254 --> 00:19:08,787
Fine. Sit here alone like daddy wanted.

400
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:10,599
I'm mad at Ben.

401
00:19:11,088 --> 00:19:12,455
I need to work out those issues

402
00:19:12,455 --> 00:19:14,394
with strange men on the dance floor.

403
00:19:14,394 --> 00:19:15,934
You're gonna leave me
sitting here by myself?

404
00:19:16,892 --> 00:19:19,262
It's a dive, Bree. Dive in.

405
00:19:25,027 --> 00:19:26,901
The main thing that distinguishes you

406
00:19:26,901 --> 00:19:29,805
from a corporate firm
is custom benchmarking.

407
00:19:29,805 --> 00:19:32,199
Let them know you provide
superior customer service,

408
00:19:32,199 --> 00:19:34,560
even though your responsibilities
are not fiduciary.

409
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,550
Ooh, "Fiduciary." I love how that sounds.

410
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,378
Can you spell it for me?

411
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:40,236
- Well, let me explain it first.
- No, no, no, no, no.

412
00:19:40,236 --> 00:19:42,445
Your explanations take forever.
Just spell it.

413
00:19:42,445 --> 00:19:44,367
Gaby, you can't write
down a bunch of buzzwords

414
00:19:44,367 --> 00:19:46,139
and read them off a piece
of paper at the meeting.

415
00:19:46,932 --> 00:19:49,222
Good point. I should
hide a piece of paper.

416
00:19:49,632 --> 00:19:52,231
Or you could actually buckle down

417
00:19:52,231 --> 00:19:54,220
and learn the concepts.

418
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,971
It's just fancy lingo.
You throw it around.

419
00:19:55,971 --> 00:19:57,698
You sound smart. Clients are happy.

420
00:19:57,879 --> 00:19:59,545
I mean, who really understands this stuff?

421
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,516
- Everybody.
- Really?

422
00:20:01,736 --> 00:20:04,836
Everybody? Okay. Hey, Penny.

423
00:20:05,336 --> 00:20:07,239
What is "Fiduciary" mean?

424
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,867
Um, I think it's like someone
who's allowed to manage

425
00:20:09,868 --> 00:20:13,145
to someone else's money... like...
a bank or something.

426
00:20:14,525 --> 00:20:16,791
Okay. Guess who's going
to their prom alone.

427
00:20:17,004 --> 00:20:19,817
Look, can we take a break?
We've been at this for hours.

428
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,016
43 minutes.

429
00:20:21,017 --> 00:20:22,794
Well, it feels like hours.

430
00:20:22,795 --> 00:20:24,799
Just give me a couple more smart words,
and we'll be done.

431
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,811
What happens when they have a question?

432
00:20:26,812 --> 00:20:30,555
You can't just spout off a bunch
of terms you don't understand.

433
00:20:30,556 --> 00:20:31,947
Of course I can.

434
00:20:31,948 --> 00:20:34,235
You think when I was
a spokesmodel at car shows

435
00:20:34,236 --> 00:20:37,307
I knew what rack and pinion steering was?

436
00:20:37,308 --> 00:20:39,231
I didn't have to, 'cause I had charm.

437
00:20:39,232 --> 00:20:42,168
And a tight little dress that
barely covered your hoo-ha.

438
00:20:42,169 --> 00:20:44,150
I wonder if I still fit into that dress.

439
00:20:44,361 --> 00:20:46,072
Well, here's a thought.

440
00:20:46,073 --> 00:20:49,925
How about for once in your
life you apply yourself?

441
00:20:50,536 --> 00:20:51,287
What does that mean?

442
00:20:51,288 --> 00:20:53,299
It means for as long as I've known you,

443
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:56,415
you have been skating by
on your looks and charm.

444
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:58,567
For as long as you've known me?

445
00:20:58,568 --> 00:21:00,900
Wow, you've been holding
on to that for a long time.

446
00:21:00,901 --> 00:21:01,730
Tell me I'm wrong.

447
00:21:01,731 --> 00:21:03,447
No, Lynette, I can't.

448
00:21:03,448 --> 00:21:05,909
No one can tell you you're wrong,
'cause you're always right.

449
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:08,655
Okay. What does that mean?
It means you're a know-it-all.

450
00:21:08,656 --> 00:21:11,975
I have never once heard you
say the words "I don't know."

451
00:21:11,976 --> 00:21:13,132
Well, get ready to,

452
00:21:13,133 --> 00:21:16,052
because I don't know why
I agreed to help you.

453
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:18,360
This is a complete waste of my time.

454
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:20,595
It's a bigger waste of my time,

455
00:21:20,596 --> 00:21:22,953
'cause listening to you, time goes slower.

456
00:21:22,954 --> 00:21:24,259
Good luck at your meeting.

457
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:27,792
Yeah, well, thanks for nothing.
What a fi-douche.

458
00:22:01,252 --> 00:22:03,728
- Hello.
- Hi.

459
00:22:07,677 --> 00:22:09,391
Oh, lord. I was hoping
you'd take it from there.

460
00:22:09,392 --> 00:22:12,236
I have absolutely no
idea what to say next.

461
00:22:12,544 --> 00:22:15,356
Uh... sorry. Neither do I.

462
00:22:15,952 --> 00:22:16,543
Well, hey, look at that.

463
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:18,300
We already have something in common.

464
00:22:18,656 --> 00:22:20,892
Hey. You using this?

465
00:22:21,744 --> 00:22:24,028
Well, it looks like we might
have to make a commitment here.

466
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:25,932
You ready to take that step?

467
00:22:27,777 --> 00:22:30,412
Sorry. I'm afraid this chair's taken.

468
00:22:35,376 --> 00:22:37,519
- I'm Bree, by the way.
- Bradley.

469
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,552
So what is a man wearing
a custom-made suit

470
00:22:40,553 --> 00:22:41,828
doing in a place like this?

471
00:22:41,829 --> 00:22:44,327
Uh, well, actually, I'm not
supposed to be in a place like this.

472
00:22:44,328 --> 00:22:46,230
I'm supposed to be across
town at the four seasons

473
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:47,943
attending my high school reunion.

474
00:22:47,944 --> 00:22:49,371
Oh, and you decided not to go.

475
00:22:49,372 --> 00:22:52,985
No, no, I went, for about,
uh, six minutes.

476
00:22:53,316 --> 00:22:54,847
Ah, all these people full of regrets

477
00:22:54,848 --> 00:22:56,831
trying to recapture their glory days.

478
00:22:56,832 --> 00:22:58,445
I was about to blow my brains out.

479
00:22:59,776 --> 00:23:00,633
That sound crazy?

480
00:23:00,634 --> 00:23:02,694
Not as much as you might think.

481
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,669
I sometimes think I married
him just to lose my virginity.

482
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:18,700
I've never said that to anyone.

483
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:22,316
I can't believe I just told
that to a total stranger.

484
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:26,325
I don't know why everyone's so
afraid of telling their secrets.

485
00:23:26,326 --> 00:23:27,572
It's freeing, isn't it?

486
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:29,727
Yeah, you're right. You know,
I think there's a lot of things

487
00:23:29,728 --> 00:23:31,803
I've been afraid of for no good reason,

488
00:23:31,804 --> 00:23:35,657
like pigeons and cilantro.

489
00:23:38,923 --> 00:23:42,201
Well, I don't have any pigeons
or cilantro at my house.

490
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,147
You know, I'm-I'm sorry.

491
00:23:46,148 --> 00:23:48,316
I-I bet you're too much of a lady

492
00:23:48,317 --> 00:23:50,103
to go home with somebody
you just met at a bar.

493
00:23:50,104 --> 00:23:53,355
Yes, a lady usually likes to know a man

494
00:23:53,356 --> 00:23:55,096
a little bit longer.

495
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,881
All right, that's long enough. Let's go.

496
00:24:16,924 --> 00:24:18,361
It's Marisa, right?

497
00:24:19,211 --> 00:24:22,107
Uh, I'm Susan. I don't
know if you remember me

498
00:24:22,108 --> 00:24:23,511
from the open house.

499
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,403
My mom's inside. I'll go get her.

500
00:24:25,404 --> 00:24:28,983
No, no, um, actually.
I wanted to talk to you alone,

501
00:24:28,984 --> 00:24:30,373
if that's okay.

502
00:24:31,465 --> 00:24:32,468
Why?

503
00:24:32,585 --> 00:24:33,892
I, uh...

504
00:24:36,089 --> 00:24:39,125
I wanna ask you about your dad.

505
00:24:39,304 --> 00:24:40,534
Stepdad.

506
00:24:40,728 --> 00:24:43,172
Stepdad. Right.

507
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:51,604
He wasn't a very good man, was he?

508
00:24:53,864 --> 00:24:55,444
When your mom mentioned him,

509
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:58,939
I noticed the look on your face,
and I had this feeling that

510
00:25:00,254 --> 00:25:04,994
maybe there was a problem
between you two.

511
00:25:07,743 --> 00:25:08,995
I don't wanna talk about this.

512
00:25:08,996 --> 00:25:10,144
It's okay.

513
00:25:10,851 --> 00:25:14,320
I know him a little bit, enough to know...

514
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,304
the kind of person he is.

515
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:21,745
You can tell me.

516
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,000
Did he ever hurt you?

517
00:25:29,508 --> 00:25:30,480
Why?

518
00:25:31,667 --> 00:25:37,408
I know that you just met me,
and this must seem very strange.

519
00:25:39,219 --> 00:25:40,881
But I came here...

520
00:25:42,277 --> 00:25:44,800
because I know what he did.

521
00:25:45,347 --> 00:25:49,312
And even though I can't
take away the pain,

522
00:25:49,685 --> 00:25:52,384
I can promise you one thing.

523
00:25:53,284 --> 00:25:58,225
Your stepfather will never hurt you again.

524
00:26:00,197 --> 00:26:01,696
How can you know that?

525
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:04,481
I just know.

526
00:26:07,427 --> 00:26:10,825
He is never... coming back.

527
00:26:12,427 --> 00:26:14,024
I promise.

528
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:31,171
Oh, my, a pool, too?

529
00:26:31,239 --> 00:26:34,130
I wish I'd known. I would
have brought my bathing suit.

530
00:26:39,063 --> 00:26:40,846
This is wonderful, by the way.

531
00:26:40,847 --> 00:26:42,483
Yeah, it was one of my favorites.

532
00:26:42,484 --> 00:26:43,829
I picked it up on a wine tasting trip

533
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,675
through the south of France last summer.

534
00:26:45,676 --> 00:26:47,208
It's got a nice...

535
00:26:51,935 --> 00:26:53,302
Well, I guess you like it, too.

536
00:26:53,303 --> 00:26:56,500
Oh, my goodness. I've never
done anything like that before.

537
00:26:56,631 --> 00:26:58,355
Well, here's to trying new things.

538
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:04,876
You know what?

539
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,541
I just thought of something
else I've never tried before.

540
00:27:17,959 --> 00:27:21,080
This is so crazy.
I'm in a pool. I'm naked.

541
00:27:21,081 --> 00:27:22,468
And I love it.

542
00:27:22,469 --> 00:27:24,464
Well, get ready to love it even more.

543
00:27:24,692 --> 00:27:27,343
Our very own... floating bar.

544
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,600
You know what?

545
00:27:29,763 --> 00:27:34,136
I just thought of something else
I've never done in a pool before.

546
00:27:40,248 --> 00:27:41,475
Oh, crap.

547
00:27:42,313 --> 00:27:43,650
Did someone just break into the house?

548
00:27:43,651 --> 00:27:45,502
Yeah. Me.

549
00:27:45,922 --> 00:27:47,278
Is someone out there?

550
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:49,230
What's happening?

551
00:27:50,722 --> 00:27:53,742
It's a funny story. He's my boss.
I'm his assistant.

552
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,911
We need to get out of here.

553
00:27:54,912 --> 00:27:57,508
You're an assistant? Aren't you over 40?

554
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,792
Jeez, you're worse than
those people at my reunion!

555
00:28:03,424 --> 00:28:04,684
Bradley?

556
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,686
Mr. Jacobs, you'll be happy to know

557
00:28:06,687 --> 00:28:09,091
that I have watered your plants
and picked up your suits.

558
00:28:09,092 --> 00:28:10,635
Oh, and your, uh, daughter called.

559
00:28:10,636 --> 00:28:12,215
What the hell are you doing?

560
00:28:12,216 --> 00:28:15,173
I'm sorry. I thought you weren't
gonna be back till Monday.

561
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,261
Oh, you two have a lot to talk about.

562
00:28:18,281 --> 00:28:19,559
Could I trouble you for a towel?

563
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,854
So you thought in the meantime

564
00:28:20,855 --> 00:28:23,396
you could take over my house, my pool,

565
00:28:23,896 --> 00:28:25,604
my pants?!

566
00:28:26,125 --> 00:28:28,467
Speaking of clothes,
I'd love to be wearing some

567
00:28:28,468 --> 00:28:29,923
from that pile right there.

568
00:28:29,924 --> 00:28:31,088
Who are you?

569
00:28:34,964 --> 00:28:37,920
Ooh. Uh, I can assure you,
I never do this sort of thing.

570
00:28:37,921 --> 00:28:39,532
Just get out!

571
00:28:44,208 --> 00:28:46,669
You have a lovely, lovely home.

572
00:28:52,539 --> 00:28:54,953
Whoa, no, we're not
done with that one yet.

573
00:28:55,019 --> 00:28:56,235
Don't know what to tell you.

574
00:28:56,236 --> 00:28:58,760
Lease hasn't been paid,
and I got sent to take it back.

575
00:28:58,871 --> 00:29:01,180
Guy with the funny accent
asked me to wait a half-hour

576
00:29:01,181 --> 00:29:03,736
while he meets with some, uh, bankers.

577
00:29:12,828 --> 00:29:15,048
Mike, hey. Private meeting.

578
00:29:19,436 --> 00:29:22,404
Yeah, do me a favor, bud.
Step back outside.

579
00:29:23,256 --> 00:29:24,392
Are you crazy?

580
00:29:24,393 --> 00:29:27,451
Well, it's just a
stop-gap loan. No worries.

581
00:29:27,452 --> 00:29:29,524
- Who is this guy?
- Sorry, pal.

582
00:29:29,525 --> 00:29:31,667
The deal's off.
He's not taking your money.

583
00:29:31,668 --> 00:29:34,099
If he's a friend, I suggest you urgently

584
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,952
get the hell out of my face.

585
00:29:36,501 --> 00:29:38,848
Mike, I'm not asking you. I'm telling you.

586
00:29:38,849 --> 00:29:40,027
Mind your own business.

587
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,424
Ben, when you're dead or on the lam

588
00:29:42,425 --> 00:29:44,319
because you can't pay them back,
and trust me,

589
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,228
you will never be able to pay them back...

590
00:29:49,202 --> 00:29:53,113
I'm gonna lose my job.
That is my business.

591
00:29:57,565 --> 00:29:58,761
You can go.

592
00:30:05,068 --> 00:30:06,775
"Mike," was it?

593
00:30:07,484 --> 00:30:08,520
Yeah.

594
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:11,801
Yeah. Mike.

595
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:26,065
My whole life, money's been
the boot on my throat, you know?

596
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:30,321
When I was a kid, when I was
a young guy starting out,

597
00:30:30,869 --> 00:30:34,865
and even now when I'm supposedly
some sort of a success.

598
00:30:35,235 --> 00:30:36,833
Yeah, it's a pain in the ass.

599
00:30:37,556 --> 00:30:40,449
Even Renee, as rich as she is,
still complains about it.

600
00:30:40,757 --> 00:30:43,219
Yeah, yeah, she, uh,
she divorced some athlete

601
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,595
or something, right?

602
00:30:44,596 --> 00:30:47,232
Some athlete? Try Doug Perry.

603
00:30:48,835 --> 00:30:50,112
The New York Yankee.

604
00:30:50,276 --> 00:30:51,824
Oh. Sorry, mate.

605
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:53,151
If she divorced a cricket player,

606
00:30:53,152 --> 00:30:54,860
I might recognize the name.

607
00:30:55,121 --> 00:30:56,259
If she divorced a cricket player,

608
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:58,496
she wouldn't have gotten $12 million.

609
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,272
Another?

610
00:31:01,008 --> 00:31:02,396
Uh... yeah.

611
00:31:05,469 --> 00:31:07,389
Yeah, yeah, another.

612
00:31:11,852 --> 00:31:15,564
Well, Gaby, we are very fond of
Carlos and everyone at global,

613
00:31:15,565 --> 00:31:16,773
but help me out here.

614
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:18,915
How can I tell our board
we're going with your firm

615
00:31:18,916 --> 00:31:21,649
instead of a larger one
with a longer track record?

616
00:31:22,515 --> 00:31:26,209
Four words... "Open-architecture
investment platform."

617
00:31:27,661 --> 00:31:30,450
So as opposed to tightly
controlling our portfolio,

618
00:31:30,451 --> 00:31:33,696
you would open it up to
a number of asset managers.

619
00:31:35,044 --> 00:31:36,561
Isn't that what I just said?

620
00:31:38,572 --> 00:31:41,705
So where do you see
the greatest opportunity for growth?

621
00:31:42,572 --> 00:31:44,152
Five words...

622
00:31:45,692 --> 00:31:48,488
debt management and emerging markets.

623
00:31:48,845 --> 00:31:52,163
Yes, because the I.M.F.
has vowed to support those economies.

624
00:31:52,164 --> 00:31:53,984
We like what we're hearing, Gaby.

625
00:31:54,388 --> 00:31:56,208
Two words... me, too.

626
00:31:58,372 --> 00:32:00,688
Oh. Sorry.

627
00:32:01,508 --> 00:32:02,735
It's my daughter.

628
00:32:03,892 --> 00:32:05,697
Juanita, I'm in a business meeting.

629
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:07,552
Yes, I have business meetings.

630
00:32:08,163 --> 00:32:09,953
Since now. What do you want?

631
00:32:10,021 --> 00:32:12,272
No, you cannot give your sister a haircut.

632
00:32:13,156 --> 00:32:14,583
Oh, okay. Well, I'll fix it later.

633
00:32:14,584 --> 00:32:16,613
Just don't let her look in any mirrors.

634
00:32:18,041 --> 00:32:20,187
Sorry about that. Where were we?

635
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,159
Well, I was just about
to ask you your opinion

636
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,667
of the long-term viability of the euro.

637
00:32:25,471 --> 00:32:26,813
Ah, well...

638
00:32:28,241 --> 00:32:29,404
Where's my menu?

639
00:32:29,745 --> 00:32:32,078
- The waiter took it.
- What? Wait.

640
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:33,615
We haven't even ordered yet.

641
00:32:33,616 --> 00:32:36,041
Oh, the chef is creating
a tasting menu for us.

642
00:32:36,042 --> 00:32:37,178
Isn't that nice?

643
00:32:37,179 --> 00:32:40,455
No! No, no. I... need my menu.

644
00:32:51,384 --> 00:32:54,100
Come on. Gotta be in here.

645
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,207
Reservation under commerson.

646
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:59,573
Oh. Here. Sit wherever you want.

647
00:33:04,905 --> 00:33:06,436
Is there a problem, Gaby?

648
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,004
No. Uh...

649
00:33:11,128 --> 00:33:13,316
No, no. No problem.

650
00:33:14,023 --> 00:33:15,668
Everything is fine.

651
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:20,120
Enough business talk. Let's just eat.

652
00:33:20,121 --> 00:33:22,155
Oh, no, I love this stuff.

653
00:33:22,156 --> 00:33:26,124
In fact, I am going to pick
your brain for the entire meal.

654
00:33:27,264 --> 00:33:28,444
Yay!

655
00:33:28,964 --> 00:33:31,131
So you were just about
to tell us your feelings

656
00:33:31,132 --> 00:33:34,424
about the future of
a unified european currency.

657
00:33:38,604 --> 00:33:40,104
Fiduciary.

658
00:33:48,605 --> 00:33:50,039
Hey, how was practice?

659
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,412
Coach is an idiot.

660
00:33:53,049 --> 00:33:54,772
You still can't fix it?

661
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,784
Well, I'm sure I could, but you know,

662
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:59,300
I'm starting to like it that way.

663
00:33:59,301 --> 00:34:00,647
Gives the place ambiance.

664
00:34:00,648 --> 00:34:01,683
Mom!

665
00:34:02,131 --> 00:34:04,111
Like a flickering candle.

666
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,640
Mom?!

667
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,936
Can you come up here?

668
00:34:09,299 --> 00:34:10,433
Yes, honey?

669
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:12,067
What did you do?

670
00:34:12,068 --> 00:34:14,479
I was trying to fix the
light in the kitchen.

671
00:34:14,499 --> 00:34:16,519
And now my wall has
a huge hole bashed in it?

672
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,931
Hey, hey, don't get all high and mighty.

673
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:20,619
There are several walls in this house

674
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,295
That have huge holes bashed in them.

675
00:34:22,296 --> 00:34:23,455
And you thought I wouldn't notice

676
00:34:23,456 --> 00:34:25,915
if you... covered it
with a unicorn poster?

677
00:34:25,916 --> 00:34:28,891
Well, Parker, you didn't notice
when I was bald from chemo,

678
00:34:28,892 --> 00:34:30,395
so, yeah, it was worth a shot.

679
00:34:30,396 --> 00:34:33,368
Why is there a map of Canada on my wall?

680
00:34:35,771 --> 00:34:37,283
Oh, my god!

681
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:38,855
I don't wanna see into his room!

682
00:34:38,856 --> 00:34:40,883
It's bad enough hearing
what goes on in there.

683
00:34:40,884 --> 00:34:42,528
Shut up. I'm not the one
who practices kissing

684
00:34:42,529 --> 00:34:43,667
with a stuffed dolphin.

685
00:34:43,668 --> 00:34:44,991
Hey, hey!

686
00:34:45,652 --> 00:34:47,431
Mom, what happened?

687
00:34:47,432 --> 00:34:51,439
I was looking for a thing
called the secondary fuse box,

688
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,155
which is supposed to be in the wall,

689
00:34:53,156 --> 00:34:56,519
but it turns out the
internet can be wrong.

690
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,263
Unbelievable.

691
00:34:57,264 --> 00:35:00,940
Mom, we told you two days ago,
just call an electrician.

692
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:05,940
No.

693
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,428
No. I have to be able to figure this out.

694
00:35:08,429 --> 00:35:09,526
Your father is gone,

695
00:35:09,527 --> 00:35:12,291
and lots of things like
this are going to happen,

696
00:35:12,292 --> 00:35:16,348
and I need to know how to fix them.

697
00:35:16,576 --> 00:35:18,791
If I had known he was
going to really leave,

698
00:35:18,792 --> 00:35:20,851
then I would have had
him teach me this stuff

699
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:22,704
while he was still here!

700
00:35:29,429 --> 00:35:30,437
I...

701
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:33,406
should go get dinner ready.

702
00:35:43,557 --> 00:35:45,364
I'm sorry. I don't have
time for you right now.

703
00:35:45,365 --> 00:35:46,687
I'm on the phone.

704
00:35:47,412 --> 00:35:48,753
I don't see a phone.

705
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,064
Yeah. It's just my boyfriend.

706
00:35:56,196 --> 00:35:57,488
She'll call you back.

707
00:35:59,859 --> 00:36:01,023
I'm sorry.

708
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:04,721
And no matter how busy I was,
I should've made time for you.

709
00:36:06,548 --> 00:36:08,196
How much did the wine cost?

710
00:36:08,197 --> 00:36:09,505
$115.

711
00:36:10,724 --> 00:36:12,225
Okay, you're sorry.

712
00:36:14,325 --> 00:36:15,985
I gotta be honest.

713
00:36:16,076 --> 00:36:19,092
I was worried you were
losing interest in me.

714
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:21,636
Lose interest in you?

715
00:36:22,584 --> 00:36:23,848
Renee...

716
00:36:27,196 --> 00:36:29,319
you got everything a man could want.

717
00:36:43,389 --> 00:36:44,283
I'm busy.

718
00:36:44,284 --> 00:36:45,705
Too busy for Bourbon?

719
00:36:46,091 --> 00:36:47,196
Or ice cream?

720
00:36:47,197 --> 00:36:50,024
Hey, we can make a Bourbon float.

721
00:36:52,044 --> 00:36:56,444
Okay. Terrible idea.
I just came to say you were right.

722
00:36:56,445 --> 00:36:59,560
I am a pain-in-the-ass know-it-all,
and I am sorry.

723
00:37:01,963 --> 00:37:03,256
You were right, too.

724
00:37:05,692 --> 00:37:07,737
Bourbon float's a terrible idea.

725
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:10,424
But an Amaretto float...

726
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:18,103
It's just so typical.
You came to me for help,

727
00:37:18,104 --> 00:37:19,880
but instead, I gave you a lecture,

728
00:37:19,881 --> 00:37:21,420
and when you wouldn't do what I said,

729
00:37:21,421 --> 00:37:23,091
- I kicked you out.
- It's okay.

730
00:37:23,092 --> 00:37:24,504
No, it's not.

731
00:37:24,505 --> 00:37:27,012
I have been doing this to Tom forever...

732
00:37:27,608 --> 00:37:29,476
till he got fed up and left.

733
00:37:30,201 --> 00:37:33,157
I really don't want that to
happen with my friends, too.

734
00:37:33,213 --> 00:37:35,514
Honey, I deserved it. You're right.

735
00:37:35,515 --> 00:37:37,032
I do fake my way through life

736
00:37:37,033 --> 00:37:39,415
by batting my eyes and looking pretty.

737
00:37:39,416 --> 00:37:41,701
And the problem is,
I can't do that anymore.

738
00:37:41,833 --> 00:37:44,325
Right. Because you're getting older.

739
00:37:44,713 --> 00:37:46,244
No, 'cause Carlos is gone.

740
00:37:47,016 --> 00:37:48,388
Oh, sorry.

741
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,151
I just have all these responsibilities.

742
00:37:50,152 --> 00:37:51,588
I have to grow up.

743
00:37:52,009 --> 00:37:53,907
Well, he should be back in a few weeks.

744
00:37:53,908 --> 00:37:56,864
What if he isn't?
What if he can't kick this thing?

745
00:37:56,884 --> 00:37:59,664
Then I'm gonna be on my own,
and I am helpless on my own.

746
00:37:59,941 --> 00:38:01,087
And that's why I came to you.

747
00:38:01,088 --> 00:38:03,112
I just wanted someone
to take care of things

748
00:38:03,113 --> 00:38:04,517
so I wouldn't have to.

749
00:38:06,264 --> 00:38:08,116
I wanted you to be my Carlos.

750
00:38:13,737 --> 00:38:15,668
I just miss him so much.

751
00:38:17,016 --> 00:38:18,412
I miss Tom, too.

752
00:38:20,912 --> 00:38:22,669
But at least we have each other.

753
00:38:24,673 --> 00:38:26,176
We're gonna get through this.

754
00:38:26,177 --> 00:38:27,196
How do you know?

755
00:38:27,197 --> 00:38:28,312
Because...

756
00:38:29,021 --> 00:38:30,760
I know everything, remember?

757
00:38:43,384 --> 00:38:44,452
Hey.

758
00:38:44,712 --> 00:38:46,104
You look exhausted.

759
00:38:46,105 --> 00:38:48,603
I am. I was gonna sleep
on the plane, but...

760
00:38:48,604 --> 00:38:50,095
But they had a movie about a parrot

761
00:38:50,096 --> 00:38:52,267
that coaches an inner city debate team?

762
00:38:53,712 --> 00:38:55,437
Hey, I haven't heard that in a while.

763
00:38:55,438 --> 00:38:56,618
It's nice.

764
00:38:56,937 --> 00:39:01,080
Oh, this trip, Mike...
it did what I needed it to do.

765
00:39:01,081 --> 00:39:02,371
Oh, I'm glad.

766
00:39:02,697 --> 00:39:03,652
Yeah.

767
00:39:04,089 --> 00:39:07,556
I think this whole Alejandro
nightmare is finally over.

768
00:39:11,783 --> 00:39:14,631
Please don't cancel the card.
My husband's been out of town,

769
00:39:14,632 --> 00:39:15,555
but I have some money now,

770
00:39:15,556 --> 00:39:18,239
and I can make
the minimum payment tomorrow.

771
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:23,040
Thank you.

772
00:39:26,068 --> 00:39:27,327
Marry a rich man, Marisa,

773
00:39:27,328 --> 00:39:28,932
because the only thing guaranteed in life

774
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:30,880
is that the bills will never stop.

775
00:39:32,154 --> 00:39:34,047
Maybe you should sell his motorcycle.

776
00:39:34,048 --> 00:39:36,300
Your stepfather loves that thing.
He'd kill me.

777
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,123
But... what if he never comes back?

778
00:39:40,368 --> 00:39:43,948
Of course he's coming back.
Why would you even say that?

779
00:39:48,095 --> 00:39:49,564
Did he contact you?

780
00:39:50,352 --> 00:39:51,469
No.

781
00:39:51,504 --> 00:39:52,524
Then what?

782
00:39:53,874 --> 00:39:54,972
Tell me.

783
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:59,356
That woman who bought all that stuff...

784
00:40:00,001 --> 00:40:01,564
She came to talk to me.

785
00:40:03,631 --> 00:40:07,356
It was weird, but
she promised he'd never come back.

786
00:40:07,687 --> 00:40:08,786
How would she know?

787
00:40:10,165 --> 00:40:11,377
That's what she said.

788
00:40:12,614 --> 00:40:14,802
And she seemed pretty sure about it.

789
00:40:33,398 --> 00:40:36,338
Turns out the car was his boss', too.

790
00:40:36,422 --> 00:40:38,724
I had to walk a mile and
a half to the bus stop.

791
00:40:38,725 --> 00:40:41,408
Have you ever taken a bus at
1:00 in the morning, Renee?

792
00:40:41,409 --> 00:40:43,756
It makes you stop believing in god.

793
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,043
Okay, Bree, I get it.

794
00:40:45,044 --> 00:40:47,568
And did I mention that I was soaking wet?

795
00:40:47,861 --> 00:40:48,387
Three times.

796
00:40:48,388 --> 00:40:49,833
Good, because I wanna be very clear

797
00:40:49,834 --> 00:40:51,927
just how your advice worked out.

798
00:40:54,697 --> 00:40:56,582
Can I say something?

799
00:40:57,866 --> 00:41:01,270
I... think you had a blast.

800
00:41:01,643 --> 00:41:03,479
Why would you say that?

801
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,592
I can see it in your eyes.

802
00:41:05,593 --> 00:41:07,779
You're telling me about
this horrible story,

803
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,939
but you love telling it.

804
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:13,280
That is... ridiculous.

805
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:21,117
Although... I suppose it was...

806
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,853
a little exhilarating.

807
00:41:25,041 --> 00:41:27,616
<i>Yes, good friends are the ones</i>

808
00:41:27,617 --> 00:41:30,444
<i>who tell us the truth about ourselves.</i>

809
00:41:31,585 --> 00:41:35,804
Look at you. You're a bad, bad girl.

810
00:41:36,128 --> 00:41:38,507
<i>Even when the truth might be something</i>

811
00:41:38,508 --> 00:41:40,920
<i>we're reluctant to admit...</i>

812
00:41:43,884 --> 00:41:46,776
<i>that we still have a great deal to learn...</i>

813
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:53,721
<i>that we sometimes need to ask for help...</i>

814
00:41:57,804 --> 00:42:01,944
<i>that we may be overlooking
a golden opportunity.</i>

815
00:42:06,508 --> 00:42:08,695
<i>Yes, hearing the truth</i>

816
00:42:08,696 --> 00:42:11,956
<i>can often set us on a different path.</i>

817
00:42:13,624 --> 00:42:16,912
Hey there. Can I buy you another drink?

818
00:42:16,913 --> 00:42:18,781
<i>But we never know...</i>

819
00:42:19,089 --> 00:42:21,099
You can buy me breakfast.

820
00:42:21,439 --> 00:42:23,997
<i>Where that path might take us...</i>

821
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,811
<i>or who might be watching.</i>

822
00:42:30,935 --> 00:42:34,883
