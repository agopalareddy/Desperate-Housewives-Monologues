1
00:00:01,424 --> 00:00:03,819
<i>Previously on...</i>

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:05,975
<i>Ben took money from a loan shark.</i>

3
00:00:05,976 --> 00:00:06,827
If you're not good for it,

4
00:00:06,828 --> 00:00:09,797
I understand that pretty
girlfriend of yours is loaded.

5
00:00:09,988 --> 00:00:12,619
<i>Julie had more then
one surprise for Susan.</i>

6
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:13,912
I'm giving it up for adoption.

7
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:14,847
What?

8
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:17,452
You slammed your doors in my face!

9
00:00:17,452 --> 00:00:18,954
<i>Bree rejected her friends.</i>

10
00:00:18,954 --> 00:00:20,224
Let go of me!

11
00:00:20,225 --> 00:00:22,836
<i>But it was Orson who came to her rescue.</i>

12
00:00:22,837 --> 00:00:24,445
Your friends called me.

13
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,739
<i>Orson Hodge had always known one thing...</i>

14
00:00:33,984 --> 00:00:37,895
<i>Bree Van de Kamp was
the perfect woman for him.</i>

15
00:00:40,651 --> 00:00:44,333
<i>When he was sick,
she nursed him back to health.</i>

16
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,056
<i>When he was arrested,</i>

17
00:00:49,095 --> 00:00:51,546
<i>she promised to wait for him.</i>

18
00:00:54,108 --> 00:00:57,350
<i>And when he suffered a terrible injury,</i>

19
00:00:57,655 --> 00:01:00,420
<i>she did everything he couldn't.</i>

20
00:01:02,622 --> 00:01:04,972
<i>So now that Bree was suffering,</i>

21
00:01:05,042 --> 00:01:07,827
<i>Orson intended to care for her.</i>

22
00:01:09,225 --> 00:01:11,801
I've found that whatever the problem,

23
00:01:12,516 --> 00:01:15,544
a cup of tea always makes
things a little better.

24
00:01:15,555 --> 00:01:16,843
Thank you.

25
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:19,776
To think, if you hadn't been there,

26
00:01:19,777 --> 00:01:21,702
what that terrible man might've done...

27
00:01:21,703 --> 00:01:23,290
Don't think about that.

28
00:01:23,605 --> 00:01:25,523
You're safe now. I'm here.

29
00:01:25,891 --> 00:01:27,967
You really are a good friend.

30
00:01:29,767 --> 00:01:31,457
Perhaps my only one.

31
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:33,078
What a thing to say.

32
00:01:33,544 --> 00:01:36,604
You're still close with Gabrielle,
Lynette, and Susan, aren't you?

33
00:01:39,602 --> 00:01:40,831
Is something wrong?

34
00:01:42,622 --> 00:01:44,623
We're estranged.

35
00:01:45,804 --> 00:01:46,901
Really?

36
00:01:48,327 --> 00:01:50,441
I thought the four of
you were inseparable.

37
00:01:50,442 --> 00:01:53,492
I know, but something happened
a few months ago, and...

38
00:01:53,653 --> 00:01:54,788
Bree?

39
00:01:57,441 --> 00:01:59,274
After everything we've been through,

40
00:01:59,866 --> 00:02:01,580
I promise you can trust me.

41
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,181
I don't want you to know.

44
00:02:09,752 --> 00:02:11,843
Please, I can see this is tearing you up.

45
00:02:11,844 --> 00:02:13,700
For your own good tell me.

46
00:02:17,922 --> 00:02:19,673
About six months ago...

47
00:02:22,832 --> 00:02:24,606
we threw a dinner part

48
00:02:25,827 --> 00:02:28,528
but before the guests arrived at Gaby's,

49
00:02:29,218 --> 00:02:31,550
something terrible happened.

50
00:02:38,677 --> 00:02:41,839
Orson, I understand you're shocked,
but please talk to me.

51
00:02:42,417 --> 00:02:43,882
I am shocked.

52
00:02:45,059 --> 00:02:47,234
You agree help cover up Carlos' crime,

53
00:02:47,235 --> 00:02:50,470
and then they just abandon you?
How can your friends do that?

54
00:02:51,123 --> 00:02:52,636
You're angry at them?

55
00:02:52,683 --> 00:02:53,623
Yes.

56
00:02:53,624 --> 00:02:56,856
They took advantage of you
and then hung you out to dry.

57
00:02:57,034 --> 00:02:58,354
It's appalling.

58
00:02:58,355 --> 00:03:00,015
So even after hearing what I've done,

59
00:03:00,016 --> 00:03:01,811
you still believe in me?

60
00:03:02,084 --> 00:03:07,522
<i>Yes, Orson Hodge knew that Bree
was the perfect woman for him.</i>

61
00:03:07,836 --> 00:03:09,894
<i>And now that he had her back...</i>

62
00:03:09,895 --> 00:03:12,299
I believe in you more than ever.

63
00:03:12,345 --> 00:03:16,184
<i>He had no intention of letting her go.</i>

64
00:03:29,547 --> 00:03:31,649
<i>Lynette Scavo had discovered</i>

65
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:34,540
<i>the silver lining of separation...</i>

66
00:03:36,138 --> 00:03:38,117
<i>shared custody.</i>

67
00:03:39,876 --> 00:03:42,330
<i>For three glorious days a week,</i>

68
00:03:42,331 --> 00:03:45,434
<i>she had no child demanding her attention...</i>

69
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,699
<i>no one to set an example for...</i>

70
00:03:53,563 --> 00:03:56,713
<i>and plenty of time to exercise.</i>

71
00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:03,101
<i>But Lynette forgot that when
it comes to being a mother,</i>

72
00:04:03,102 --> 00:04:04,513
<i>you can run...</i>

73
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:05,813
Hey, mom!

74
00:04:06,963 --> 00:04:09,120
<i>But you can never hide.</i>

75
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:11,579
Hey, guys. What's going on?

76
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,620
Nothing. Jeez, do we need
a reason to bring flowers

77
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,569
to the woman who gave us life?

78
00:04:18,866 --> 00:04:20,928
Suitcases? Why are there suitcases?

79
00:04:22,643 --> 00:04:25,193
Okay, we had a little
disagreement with our landlord,

80
00:04:25,194 --> 00:04:27,693
and we were kind of evicted.

81
00:04:33,322 --> 00:04:34,605
No! No! No! No! No!

82
00:04:34,606 --> 00:04:37,101
Go away! You are not moving back here.

83
00:04:37,102 --> 00:04:38,040
Mom, come on...

84
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:39,582
I spent 18 years getting you out of here.

85
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:42,736
There's no damn way
I'm letting you back in.

86
00:04:45,584 --> 00:04:46,688
Okay, mom.

87
00:04:47,979 --> 00:04:48,900
We understand.

88
00:04:48,901 --> 00:04:51,117
Yeah, we have to learn to live on our own.

89
00:05:02,027 --> 00:05:02,554
No.

90
00:05:02,555 --> 00:05:04,244
Come on! Just for a week.

91
00:05:04,245 --> 00:05:06,818
I know you guys.
A week would turn into a year,

92
00:05:06,819 --> 00:05:08,034
a year into 20,

93
00:05:08,035 --> 00:05:10,115
and pretty soon, you're
taking me off the respirator,

94
00:05:10,116 --> 00:05:12,229
saying "It's what mom would've wanted."

95
00:05:14,668 --> 00:05:16,944
Please let us in.
We're children of divorce.

96
00:05:16,945 --> 00:05:19,034
Exactly. Go to your dad's.

97
00:05:19,436 --> 00:05:21,015
But we like you so much more.

98
00:05:21,089 --> 00:05:22,524
Don't give me that.

99
00:05:22,525 --> 00:05:24,521
No, seriously, dad has
that stupid girlfriend.

100
00:05:24,522 --> 00:05:26,317
And he's been so unfair to you.

101
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:32,593
You had me at "Stupid girlfriend."

102
00:05:37,269 --> 00:05:39,399
Hey, sweetie. Whatcha doing?

103
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,696
Oh, the adoption agency sent me
a few more couples to check out.

104
00:05:42,811 --> 00:05:45,140
Okay, that guy's got serial killer eyes.

105
00:05:45,141 --> 00:05:47,567
Oh, he does not. That's from the flash.

106
00:05:47,567 --> 00:05:49,875
Fine. You want your baby to be on the run.

107
00:05:49,876 --> 00:05:51,200
Any other choices?

108
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:52,972
I like them.

109
00:05:52,973 --> 00:05:54,296
Oh, gay couple.

110
00:05:54,297 --> 00:05:56,480
Uh, that's not a man.

111
00:05:56,678 --> 00:05:58,923
Oh, too bad. They're great with kids.

112
00:05:58,934 --> 00:06:01,631
Okay, that's it. Nobody's ever
gonna be good enough for you.

113
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:03,333
So you've totally ruled out keeping it?

114
00:06:03,334 --> 00:06:04,431
Yes, totally.

115
00:06:04,432 --> 00:06:06,429
And I get no say in the matter?

116
00:06:06,792 --> 00:06:08,031
Now you're talkin'.

117
00:06:11,087 --> 00:06:12,249
You need to stop hassling her.

118
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,805
I just wish there was something I could do

119
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:16,259
to keep her from giving this baby away.

120
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:21,338
Hey, what if I talk to the father?

121
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:21,949
Susan...

122
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:24,125
No, does he even know
that she's doing this?

123
00:06:24,127 --> 00:06:26,207
Maybe if I find him,

124
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,602
I tell him, and then he'll stop her.

125
00:06:28,907 --> 00:06:31,140
That's a very bad idea.

126
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:34,182
- Says you.
- What do your friends think?

127
00:06:34,586 --> 00:06:37,118
I don't know. Not allowed to tell them.

128
00:06:37,119 --> 00:06:38,894
Julie wants to keep this a big secret.

129
00:06:38,895 --> 00:06:42,281
So you are the only one
I'm allowed to talk to,

130
00:06:42,406 --> 00:06:45,182
and I would really appreciate
it if you would agree with me.

131
00:06:46,109 --> 00:06:47,378
Look, this is killing me, too.

132
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:48,733
But it's her decision.

133
00:06:49,369 --> 00:06:50,681
You keep pushing her,

134
00:06:50,682 --> 00:06:52,859
it's not just a grandkid
you're gonna lose.

135
00:06:59,441 --> 00:07:01,804
Girls, let's go home now.

136
00:07:03,034 --> 00:07:04,727
All right, I'm gonna count to three.

137
00:07:05,032 --> 00:07:06,085
One...

138
00:07:06,951 --> 00:07:08,090
two...

139
00:07:09,372 --> 00:07:10,888
two and a half...

140
00:07:12,013 --> 00:07:13,946
two and three-quarters...

141
00:07:14,249 --> 00:07:16,548
You don't know any more fractions, do you?

142
00:07:16,794 --> 00:07:18,387
All right, that is it, smart-ass.

143
00:07:18,388 --> 00:07:20,020
I am calling your father.

144
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:20,856
And you better watch out,

145
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:23,131
because this phone has a whup-ass app.

146
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:32,690
Hi, sweetie. I am just
getting ready to meditate.

147
00:07:32,691 --> 00:07:33,480
Can I call you back?

148
00:07:33,481 --> 00:07:35,982
No! No, no, no. Enough
nurturing your inner child.

149
00:07:35,983 --> 00:07:37,197
I need you to come home

150
00:07:37,198 --> 00:07:39,460
and whack a couple of your outer ones.

151
00:07:39,461 --> 00:07:42,971
I can't come home until
my treatment is complete.

152
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:44,990
That's another 16 days.

153
00:07:44,991 --> 00:07:46,540
In 16 days, I can't guarantee

154
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:48,429
you're gonna have
children to come home to.

155
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,910
You wouldn't believe the things
that are going through my mind.

156
00:07:50,945 --> 00:07:51,529
Gaby.

157
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:54,179
I'm just saying, I've got rocks,
they've got backpacks,

158
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,196
and there's a lake on the way to school.

159
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,796
Look... I know that
it has been tough on you

160
00:07:59,797 --> 00:08:01,214
with me being in rehab.

161
00:08:01,215 --> 00:08:04,451
You have no idea. I am losing my mind.

162
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,621
I'm looking after your business,

163
00:08:06,622 --> 00:08:07,993
I'm running the house,

164
00:08:07,994 --> 00:08:09,723
I'm trying to keep the girls in line.

165
00:08:09,724 --> 00:08:11,161
Let me talk to Juanita.

166
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:14,028
Juanita, talk to your father.

167
00:08:16,024 --> 00:08:17,151
Hey, daddy.

168
00:08:27,734 --> 00:08:29,055
Anything biting?

169
00:08:29,906 --> 00:08:31,419
Karen kicked me out.

170
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,905
Oh, my god. What happened?

171
00:08:32,906 --> 00:08:34,183
I don't know.

172
00:08:34,619 --> 00:08:37,487
Seems like everything
I do lately gets her mad.

173
00:08:37,488 --> 00:08:39,938
"Lately"? She's a grouchy old lady.

174
00:08:39,939 --> 00:08:42,445
That's why we love and fear her.

175
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,128
Nah, this is different.

176
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:47,026
I think it's gonna take
a while for her to cool down.

177
00:08:47,046 --> 00:08:50,442
And in the meantime, I got no place to go.

178
00:08:52,877 --> 00:08:56,316
Yeah. Well, you know,
it's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.

179
00:08:56,317 --> 00:08:57,444
Not for me.

180
00:08:57,445 --> 00:08:58,693
I slept there once.

181
00:08:58,694 --> 00:09:02,433
Woke up at 2:00 in the morning
with a guy massaging my feet.

182
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:05,067
Well, at least she gave me my fishing pole

183
00:09:05,068 --> 00:09:07,239
so I won't starve to death.

184
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,994
The church has a koi pond, right?

185
00:09:11,825 --> 00:09:13,162
There's that frontier spirit.

186
00:09:13,163 --> 00:09:16,523
Okay, Gaby. It's obvious
you're not picking up my hints.

187
00:09:16,524 --> 00:09:18,877
No, I am. I'm just ignoring them.

188
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:22,179
Look, I'd offer you a room at my place,

189
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,424
but my kids are young and loud...

190
00:09:24,425 --> 00:09:27,016
And I'm old and deaf. It's perfect.

191
00:09:27,017 --> 00:09:28,190
Thanks, Gaby.

192
00:09:28,191 --> 00:09:30,233
I'd ask Bree if I could crash with her,

193
00:09:30,234 --> 00:09:32,175
but she's got Orson over there.

194
00:09:36,349 --> 00:09:38,241
You need to be helping
your mother out more.

195
00:09:38,242 --> 00:09:39,236
You know, helping around the house...

196
00:09:39,237 --> 00:09:40,142
Thanks, honey. You've been a big help.

197
00:09:40,143 --> 00:09:41,888
- I gotta call the girls. Bye.
- Gaby!

198
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:49,002
Ladies.

199
00:09:49,184 --> 00:09:50,699
I saw you through the window

200
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,973
and just had to come out to say hello.

201
00:09:53,357 --> 00:09:54,460
Orson.

202
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:55,694
You're back.

203
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,190
I am back.

204
00:09:57,191 --> 00:09:59,122
Keenly observed, Susan.

205
00:09:59,312 --> 00:10:01,462
She just meant it's unexpected,

206
00:10:01,463 --> 00:10:03,303
seeing you after all this time.

207
00:10:03,814 --> 00:10:04,961
Building a ramp.

208
00:10:04,962 --> 00:10:05,708
You and Bree...

209
00:10:05,709 --> 00:10:08,365
Gonna be spending more time together? Yes.

210
00:10:08,366 --> 00:10:12,115
As you know, she's been going
through a rough patch of late.

211
00:10:12,618 --> 00:10:13,962
The other night, she was at a bar,

212
00:10:13,963 --> 00:10:16,071
and there was an incident.

213
00:10:16,072 --> 00:10:17,108
An incident?

214
00:10:17,109 --> 00:10:19,942
Something unpleasant with
an aggressive stranger.

215
00:10:20,904 --> 00:10:22,017
She's fine.

216
00:10:22,261 --> 00:10:24,140
Thank god I happened to be driving by.

217
00:10:24,141 --> 00:10:25,495
Thank god is right.

218
00:10:25,496 --> 00:10:27,588
But as you can imagine,
she's still a little shaken up,

219
00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:29,429
so I'm gonna be spending some time here

220
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,069
until the dust settles.

221
00:10:31,141 --> 00:10:32,374
Can we see her?

222
00:10:32,962 --> 00:10:36,389
You know, I don't think
she's up for that yet.

223
00:10:37,597 --> 00:10:39,171
I'm not surprised.

224
00:10:39,785 --> 00:10:41,550
Yeah, last time we saw her,

225
00:10:41,783 --> 00:10:43,178
it didn't go so well.

226
00:10:43,654 --> 00:10:46,799
Will you at least tell her
we love her and we're here for her?

227
00:10:46,957 --> 00:10:48,781
I'll be sure to relay the message.

228
00:10:49,431 --> 00:10:50,832
- Thanks.
- Bye.

229
00:10:58,315 --> 00:11:00,153
Who were you, uh, talking to?

230
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:02,774
Just the men installing my ramp.

231
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,471
Now how about I make us some lunch?

232
00:11:13,038 --> 00:11:15,619
No, you've gotta deliver
that cement tomorrow.

233
00:11:16,694 --> 00:11:18,959
Look, I don't know why Ben didn't pay you,

234
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,004
but I drove back to the site.

235
00:11:20,005 --> 00:11:22,577
I'm gonna find your check,
and I'll get it to you tonight.

236
00:11:28,177 --> 00:11:29,188
Hey!

237
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,957
Hey, this is private property!

238
00:11:57,779 --> 00:11:59,059
What the hell?!

239
00:11:59,289 --> 00:12:02,487
Damn it, Mike.
Why'd you have to come back?

240
00:12:14,657 --> 00:12:16,063
Are you out of your mind?

241
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:17,867
This doesn't concern you.

242
00:12:17,868 --> 00:12:20,425
You almost killed me, so I say it does.

243
00:12:23,365 --> 00:12:25,487
I'm in over my head with this loan shark,

244
00:12:25,488 --> 00:12:27,705
and his late fee comes with a crowbar.

245
00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:30,999
Sorry... some of this equipment blows up,

246
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,082
the insurance company
writes me a big check,

247
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:35,525
and I'm able to keep
my knees a little longer.

248
00:12:35,526 --> 00:12:36,824
That's fraud, Ben.

249
00:12:36,825 --> 00:12:39,922
I know what it's called.
I just didn't know what else to do.

250
00:12:39,923 --> 00:12:41,272
Well, not this.

251
00:12:41,273 --> 00:12:42,968
Then what? 'cause I've been trying

252
00:12:42,969 --> 00:12:45,685
to fix this for weeks, Mike,
but it just keeps getting worse.

253
00:12:45,686 --> 00:12:46,971
I've lost every cent I have.

254
00:12:46,972 --> 00:12:48,457
I've lost Renee.

255
00:12:49,637 --> 00:12:52,026
I've... I've screwed everything up.

256
00:12:55,628 --> 00:12:56,782
Are you okay?

257
00:12:57,535 --> 00:13:00,238
My chest feels tight.
That's not good, is it?

258
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:01,746
No, it's not.

259
00:13:05,213 --> 00:13:06,934
Let's get you to the hospital. Come on.

260
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:10,150
Thanks.

261
00:13:10,151 --> 00:13:11,198
Yeah.

262
00:13:11,543 --> 00:13:12,951
I see the twins are home.

263
00:13:12,952 --> 00:13:14,926
Really? What gave it away?

264
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:18,943
Guys! Get your boxers off the table!

265
00:13:18,944 --> 00:13:20,131
They're not mine.

266
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,978
Me neither. I'm wearing...

267
00:13:22,189 --> 00:13:23,339
Oh, wait.

268
00:13:23,699 --> 00:13:24,535
Be right down.

269
00:13:24,536 --> 00:13:26,260
I swear, they're like termites.

270
00:13:26,261 --> 00:13:28,252
Just when I think I've
gotten rid of 'em...

271
00:13:28,253 --> 00:13:30,739
At least they come back to
you when they're in trouble.

272
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,246
And that's a good thing?

273
00:13:32,477 --> 00:13:33,706
Yes.

274
00:13:33,891 --> 00:13:35,688
Because they listen to you.

275
00:13:36,047 --> 00:13:37,697
They let you help them.

276
00:13:37,969 --> 00:13:40,119
They don't keep
their problems secret for six months

277
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,865
and then completely shut you out,

278
00:13:41,866 --> 00:13:43,710
ignoring all your advice.

279
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:46,811
What's wrong?

280
00:13:46,812 --> 00:13:48,337
I'm not supposed to tell you...

281
00:13:49,683 --> 00:13:51,349
that Julie's pregnant,

282
00:13:51,924 --> 00:13:54,151
and she's giving the baby up for adoption.

283
00:13:54,152 --> 00:13:56,638
Wow. Where's the dad in all this?

284
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,146
"Who's the dad?" is more like it.

285
00:13:58,147 --> 00:13:59,639
She won't tell me anything.

286
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,134
I'm sorry.

287
00:14:03,313 --> 00:14:05,370
You know, right when Julie was born,

288
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,174
they took her away to
give her a vitamin shot,

289
00:14:08,175 --> 00:14:12,115
and that was the longest hour of my life.

290
00:14:12,116 --> 00:14:16,045
And now she's talking about
giving the baby away for good.

291
00:14:16,493 --> 00:14:19,667
I mean, she just has no idea
how hard that's gonna be.

292
00:14:19,881 --> 00:14:20,922
Do you want me to talk to her?

293
00:14:20,923 --> 00:14:23,558
She might react differently
to someone who's not her mom.

294
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:24,674
No.

295
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,486
In fact, you can't even
tell her I told you.

296
00:14:27,487 --> 00:14:30,645
Julie doesn't want anyone
knowing she's pregnant.

297
00:14:36,999 --> 00:14:39,366
Oh, mornin'. How'd you sleep?

298
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:42,579
Terribly. I'd ask you, but I already know.

299
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,522
How can someone use the bathroom
five times in one night?

300
00:14:45,619 --> 00:14:47,040
Heart of a lion,

301
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:49,127
bladder of a fruit fly.

302
00:14:50,429 --> 00:14:52,904
Well, you do know they make
bathrobes with belts on them?

303
00:14:52,905 --> 00:14:53,916
I'm sorry.

304
00:14:53,917 --> 00:14:56,793
I didn't mean to let the old komodo dragon

305
00:14:56,794 --> 00:14:58,526
peek out of the cage.

306
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,456
Don't mention it...

307
00:15:00,634 --> 00:15:02,137
ever again.

308
00:15:04,472 --> 00:15:06,260
Girls, school starts in 20 minutes.

309
00:15:06,261 --> 00:15:07,641
Why aren't you dressed?

310
00:15:07,642 --> 00:15:08,771
'Cause then we'd be ready,

311
00:15:08,772 --> 00:15:10,915
then we'd have to go, and we hate school.

312
00:15:10,925 --> 00:15:12,559
Here. I made breakfast.

313
00:15:12,728 --> 00:15:14,203
Ooh. Toast.

314
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:16,421
Let me know when your cookbook comes out.

315
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:21,109
Okay.

316
00:15:21,178 --> 00:15:23,198
Let's talk about how
we're getting you off my couch

317
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,211
and back with the lady you love.
What's our plan?

318
00:15:25,212 --> 00:15:27,187
Doesn't look good.
I've been calling all morning.

319
00:15:27,188 --> 00:15:29,045
She doesn't even pick up the phone.

320
00:15:29,046 --> 00:15:30,616
Roy, you've got to put
some effort into it.

321
00:15:30,617 --> 00:15:33,210
Woo her. March over there
and sweep her off her feet.

322
00:15:33,211 --> 00:15:34,651
I don't think it's gonna work.

323
00:15:34,652 --> 00:15:36,535
No, no, here's what doesn't work...

324
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:38,921
me being awakened at 2:00
A.M. by that pep talk

325
00:15:38,922 --> 00:15:41,234
you give your dragon when
you're trying to pee.

326
00:15:42,774 --> 00:15:44,397
You want me out.

327
00:15:44,873 --> 00:15:45,484
I'm sorry.

328
00:15:45,485 --> 00:15:47,871
It's just, my life's really
stressful right now.

329
00:15:48,004 --> 00:15:49,182
No apologies.

330
00:15:49,183 --> 00:15:52,360
It was very kind of you to take me in.

331
00:15:52,747 --> 00:15:55,549
I'm sure I can find another place to stay.

332
00:15:58,231 --> 00:16:00,822
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
I told you to get dressed!

333
00:16:00,823 --> 00:16:01,809
I don't wanna.

334
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:03,956
Damn it, girls! Listen to your mother.

335
00:16:04,739 --> 00:16:06,738
You can't talk to me like that.
You're not my dad.

336
00:16:06,739 --> 00:16:11,203
Exactly. So I don't give
a crap if you live or die.

337
00:16:11,582 --> 00:16:14,573
Here. You see the notches on this belt?

338
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:18,289
Thos are all the men I killed in Korea.

339
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:20,326
First time, it was a little rough,

340
00:16:20,327 --> 00:16:24,794
but after that,
you develop a taste for blood.

341
00:16:25,553 --> 00:16:27,156
So listen up, soldiers.

342
00:16:27,157 --> 00:16:29,307
You are gonna march up those stairs,

343
00:16:29,308 --> 00:16:33,682
put on your school gear,
and be back down by 8:00 sharp.

344
00:16:33,683 --> 00:16:35,707
Is that clear?

345
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:37,895
All right. Now move!

346
00:16:41,109 --> 00:16:43,382
Well, I guess I better go start packing.

347
00:16:43,501 --> 00:16:45,056
No! No, no, no, no.

348
00:16:45,136 --> 00:16:48,191
I can't send a war
veteran out on the street.

349
00:16:48,192 --> 00:16:51,389
As long as America is free,
you have a place here.

350
00:16:57,236 --> 00:16:58,369
Let me finish.

351
00:16:58,370 --> 00:16:59,825
See, this is why I didn't tell you.

352
00:16:59,826 --> 00:17:01,275
I knew you were gonna freak.

353
00:17:01,984 --> 00:17:03,389
Because it's not your decision.

354
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,941
I don't care if you're the father.

355
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,404
Okay, you know what?
I'm not doing this on the phone.

356
00:17:07,405 --> 00:17:09,787
Just meet me at the coffee
cup in half an hour.

357
00:17:37,198 --> 00:17:38,243
Hey.

358
00:17:40,698 --> 00:17:41,647
You using this chair?

359
00:17:41,648 --> 00:17:43,367
Uh, no, go ahead.

360
00:17:49,137 --> 00:17:50,462
Mrs. Delfino?

361
00:17:51,394 --> 00:17:52,662
Oh, Porter. Shh.

362
00:17:52,663 --> 00:17:54,388
I don't want to Julie to know I'm here.

363
00:17:54,389 --> 00:17:55,516
Why not?

364
00:17:55,714 --> 00:17:57,586
Oh, she's meeting a guy.

365
00:17:57,587 --> 00:17:59,295
I need to find out who it is.

366
00:17:59,334 --> 00:18:00,989
Oh, hey, Porter.

367
00:18:01,709 --> 00:18:02,868
Over here.

368
00:18:04,323 --> 00:18:05,562
Mom?

369
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:13,110
Oh, my god.

370
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:14,555
You're the guy.

371
00:18:17,171 --> 00:18:20,973
Porter Scavo is
the father of my grandchild.

372
00:18:22,046 --> 00:18:23,258
Oh!

373
00:18:26,613 --> 00:18:28,107
I can't believe you spied on me.

374
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:29,482
And I can't believe you shacked up

375
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:32,288
- with a kid you used to babysit.
- Can I just say something?

376
00:18:33,225 --> 00:18:34,390
Are you two in a relationship?

377
00:18:34,391 --> 00:18:36,531
Oh, god, no. Never in a million years.

378
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:37,953
I can hear you!

379
00:18:37,954 --> 00:18:39,699
We ran into each other at a bar, okay?

380
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,100
And I-I'd just broken up with Wwill,

381
00:18:41,101 --> 00:18:42,202
and I was feeling really depressed,

382
00:18:42,203 --> 00:18:44,085
and Porter bought me a few drinks.

383
00:18:44,327 --> 00:18:45,465
And then we went back to my place and...

384
00:18:45,466 --> 00:18:47,659
Apparently, forgot everything
I taught you about condoms.

385
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,868
No.

386
00:18:49,243 --> 00:18:50,447
It broke.

387
00:18:51,738 --> 00:18:54,270
What'd you expect? It's Porter Scavo.

388
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:57,122
He probably found it on
the floor of a movie theater.

389
00:19:05,418 --> 00:19:06,500
Great.

390
00:19:07,099 --> 00:19:08,721
Well, you better get used to it.

391
00:19:09,084 --> 00:19:11,147
This snot-nosed kid,

392
00:19:11,148 --> 00:19:13,697
the boy who got
his head stuck in our fence,

393
00:19:13,698 --> 00:19:14,946
is the father of your baby.

394
00:19:14,947 --> 00:19:16,938
No, the father will be an adoptive parent

395
00:19:16,939 --> 00:19:18,293
who has gone through extensive interviews

396
00:19:18,294 --> 00:19:20,337
- and a background check.
- Both of you, stop.

397
00:19:20,713 --> 00:19:23,582
No more fighting. All this
stress is bad for my baby.

398
00:19:24,295 --> 00:19:25,553
Your baby?

399
00:19:25,639 --> 00:19:27,882
Yeah. I wanna keep it.

400
00:19:28,507 --> 00:19:29,579
You do?

401
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,625
Yeah.

402
00:19:30,931 --> 00:19:32,488
Oh, I was just doing some research online.

403
00:19:32,489 --> 00:19:34,126
You might want to eat
something called folic acid,

404
00:19:34,127 --> 00:19:36,883
- or the baby could have a weird head.
- You can't be serious.

405
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,202
There is no way
we are raising a baby together.

406
00:19:39,203 --> 00:19:40,020
Then I'll do it myself.

407
00:19:40,021 --> 00:19:41,600
Oh, please. You can't do that.

408
00:19:41,601 --> 00:19:44,248
Well, uh, legally...

409
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:45,496
he can.

410
00:19:45,689 --> 00:19:47,984
I mean, fathers do have rights.

411
00:19:48,037 --> 00:19:49,226
Mom, what are you doing?

412
00:19:49,227 --> 00:19:51,611
Nothing. I'm just reminding Porter

413
00:19:51,612 --> 00:19:54,185
that he does have a say in this

414
00:19:54,237 --> 00:19:56,491
and letting him know that
if he wants to raise the baby,

415
00:19:56,492 --> 00:19:57,911
he'll have my support

416
00:19:58,306 --> 00:19:59,564
And unlimitebabysitting.

417
00:19:59,564 --> 00:20:01,957
No! No, no, no.
This is none of your business.

418
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:03,181
Stay out of it!

419
00:20:05,575 --> 00:20:08,595
Porter, if you're serious about this,
I will help you.

420
00:20:08,596 --> 00:20:09,513
Just tell me what you need.

421
00:20:09,514 --> 00:20:10,608
Thank you.

422
00:20:12,647 --> 00:20:13,991
Could you tell my mom?

423
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:18,103
Oh, hey.

424
00:20:18,157 --> 00:20:20,427
I brought those contracts.
Your secretary says

425
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:22,274
to sign them so I can
bring 'em back tomorrow.

426
00:20:22,275 --> 00:20:23,678
Aw. Thanks, babe.

427
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,222
Listen, I want you to understand

428
00:20:25,223 --> 00:20:28,885
I get how much you've had
to do with me in here.

429
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,233
But I talked to my counselor,

430
00:20:30,234 --> 00:20:34,188
and he said that I don't
have to do the full 16 days.

431
00:20:34,189 --> 00:20:37,110
I can get out a few days early,
help out with the girls.

432
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:39,381
Oh, honey, you don't worry about that.

433
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:40,478
Really?

434
00:20:40,479 --> 00:20:41,732
Because yesterday on the phone,

435
00:20:41,733 --> 00:20:44,117
you had that whole drowning fantasy.

436
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:46,198
I know, but I got help at home.

437
00:20:46,199 --> 00:20:49,398
- What, a nanny?
- Better. A sergeant.

438
00:20:49,399 --> 00:20:50,925
I got Roy.

439
00:20:50,926 --> 00:20:53,076
McCluskey kicked him out,
so I took him in.

440
00:20:53,077 --> 00:20:54,991
You wouldn't believe how
he's getting the girls in line.

441
00:20:54,992 --> 00:20:56,539
McCluskey kicked him out? why?

442
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:59,855
Who knows? By the way,
big oil stain in the garage?

443
00:20:59,856 --> 00:21:01,640
He had the girls in there all afternoon.

444
00:21:01,641 --> 00:21:02,722
It's gone!

445
00:21:02,723 --> 00:21:05,985
Wow. Those two seemed so
perfect for each other.

446
00:21:05,986 --> 00:21:07,839
And it's perfect for me!

447
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,416
Roy's a genius.

448
00:21:09,417 --> 00:21:10,873
Simply by yelling at the girls

449
00:21:10,874 --> 00:21:11,968
and threatening 'em with violence,

450
00:21:11,969 --> 00:21:13,780
he has made our home a happy place.

451
00:21:13,781 --> 00:21:15,489
But aren't you the least bit interested

452
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:17,276
in what drove them apart?

453
00:21:17,716 --> 00:21:19,399
I know what's gonna drive us apart...

454
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,877
If you keep asking
those kinds of questions!

455
00:21:27,484 --> 00:21:30,148
Hey, I, uh, I need to
talk to you about Ben.

456
00:21:30,149 --> 00:21:33,044
After what he did to me, I don't care.

457
00:21:34,761 --> 00:21:36,101
He's in the hospital.

458
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:38,628
He is?

459
00:21:39,922 --> 00:21:41,080
What happened?

460
00:21:42,114 --> 00:21:44,059
He started having chest pains.

461
00:21:45,423 --> 00:21:46,698
They say it's not a heart attack,

462
00:21:46,699 --> 00:21:48,996
but they want to monitor
him for a couple days.

463
00:21:49,621 --> 00:21:52,356
But Ben's a young guy. He's healthy.

464
00:21:52,524 --> 00:21:53,889
Why is he having chest pains?

465
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:56,315
Oh, he's been under a lot of stress.

466
00:21:56,476 --> 00:21:58,318
Oh, is it the money thing?

467
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:00,190
Yeah. It's worse than you think.

468
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:03,317
He's in pretty deep to this... guy.

469
00:22:03,318 --> 00:22:05,399
Guy? What kind of guy?

470
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,305
Let's just say he's not
exactly a licensed banker,

471
00:22:08,306 --> 00:22:10,790
which is what I wanted
to talk to you about.

472
00:22:11,412 --> 00:22:12,780
Ben's in trouble.

473
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,055
This is nice.

474
00:22:19,056 --> 00:22:20,970
It's like you never left,

475
00:22:20,971 --> 00:22:22,135
like all of those terrible things

476
00:22:22,136 --> 00:22:24,248
I told you about never happened,

477
00:22:24,249 --> 00:22:26,404
and we've been here in this kitchen,

478
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,246
safe.

479
00:22:28,743 --> 00:22:30,666
It does feel very comfortable.

480
00:22:30,854 --> 00:22:32,562
We're like a pair of old jeans.

481
00:22:32,563 --> 00:22:34,437
Well, we can only assume,
since neither one of us

482
00:22:34,438 --> 00:22:36,691
has ever owned a pair of old jeans.

483
00:22:38,987 --> 00:22:40,712
I want to run something by you.

484
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,158
Of course.

485
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,282
Given everything
you've been through lately,

486
00:22:44,283 --> 00:22:46,334
how would you feel about
a change of scenery?

487
00:22:46,335 --> 00:22:47,907
How big of a change?

488
00:22:48,472 --> 00:22:49,731
Maine.

489
00:22:51,006 --> 00:22:53,243
- My aunt recently passed.
- Oh.

490
00:22:53,244 --> 00:22:56,309
Ah, no need for sympathy.
She was a wretched woman.

491
00:22:56,313 --> 00:22:58,558
She left her coastal cabin to me.

492
00:22:58,689 --> 00:23:00,503
Well, it might be nice to
get away for a couple weeks.

493
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,970
Yes. And if you like it,

494
00:23:02,971 --> 00:23:05,061
maybe we could make it more permanent,

495
00:23:05,692 --> 00:23:08,307
you know, move there.

496
00:23:09,531 --> 00:23:11,881
Are you talking about us
getting back together?

497
00:23:11,882 --> 00:23:13,909
Because I'm not sure I'm ready for that.

498
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:17,182
All I'm talking about is a fresh start,

499
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:20,214
a new chapter in your life.

500
00:23:20,389 --> 00:23:23,111
I don't know, Orson.
It's such a massive change.

501
00:23:23,112 --> 00:23:26,323
I'd be saying good-bye to all my friends.

502
00:23:26,324 --> 00:23:28,923
You mean the women who involved
you in a murder cover-up

503
00:23:28,924 --> 00:23:30,196
and then abandoned you?

504
00:23:30,197 --> 00:23:31,922
Well, in all fairness, they did attempt

505
00:23:31,923 --> 00:23:33,770
that intervention I told you about.

506
00:23:33,771 --> 00:23:36,939
Mm-hmm. And yet they haven't
come by since, have they?

507
00:23:38,949 --> 00:23:39,920
Come on.

508
00:23:39,921 --> 00:23:41,157
Come to the cabin.

509
00:23:41,855 --> 00:23:44,845
Just for a few weeks,
to see if you like it.

510
00:23:47,684 --> 00:23:50,154
You know what? Let's do it.

511
00:23:50,235 --> 00:23:51,471
Wonderful.

512
00:23:51,565 --> 00:23:53,001
I'll book the flight.

513
00:23:54,327 --> 00:23:55,880
How's the sauce?

514
00:23:58,782 --> 00:24:01,015
It's all coming together perfectly.

515
00:24:13,671 --> 00:24:15,259
What was that for?

516
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:17,010
For giving me the day off.

517
00:24:17,011 --> 00:24:19,643
I was able to hit the entire
left side of the mall.

518
00:24:19,644 --> 00:24:21,943
And if you're willing to
keep torturing my kids,

519
00:24:21,944 --> 00:24:23,464
tomorrow I'll hit the right side.

520
00:24:23,465 --> 00:24:24,571
Hi, mom.

521
00:24:25,814 --> 00:24:27,103
What's all this?

522
00:24:27,501 --> 00:24:30,535
The girls and I tackled
that dead tree out back.

523
00:24:30,536 --> 00:24:35,108
I taught them some basic
forestry procedure.

524
00:24:35,652 --> 00:24:38,005
The older one is pretty good with an ax.

525
00:24:38,006 --> 00:24:40,877
You might want to keep an eye on that.

526
00:24:41,002 --> 00:24:43,587
Well, I can't thank you enough.

527
00:24:43,588 --> 00:24:46,114
You are absolutely welcome to stay here...

528
00:24:46,598 --> 00:24:48,327
for the next 16 days.

529
00:24:48,328 --> 00:24:51,221
Yeah, well, I don't know if
I'm gonna make it that long.

530
00:24:51,222 --> 00:24:54,296
I'm thinking about begging
Karen to take me back.

531
00:24:54,297 --> 00:24:55,396
What?

532
00:24:55,428 --> 00:24:57,332
I really miss her.

533
00:24:57,519 --> 00:24:59,163
No, you don't.

534
00:24:59,669 --> 00:25:02,381
I mean, what's there to miss?

535
00:25:02,382 --> 00:25:04,897
You know, the foul moods and the nagging

536
00:25:04,898 --> 00:25:06,665
and the...

537
00:25:06,723 --> 00:25:09,709
Yeah, she can be a little gruff.

538
00:25:09,768 --> 00:25:12,455
And god knows I got my own baggage.

539
00:25:12,456 --> 00:25:15,693
But today, when I was telling the girls

540
00:25:15,694 --> 00:25:18,431
we could have a cozy fire tonight,

541
00:25:18,432 --> 00:25:22,433
all I could think about
was having one with Karen.

542
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:26,474
Well... I...

543
00:25:28,963 --> 00:25:32,559
I... think you just need
to get your mind off her.

544
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,992
You know what would help?
A nice, long bath.

545
00:25:34,993 --> 00:25:36,457
Yeah. Come on. Come on.

546
00:25:36,458 --> 00:25:38,908
You can, uh, use my lavender bath salts.

547
00:25:38,909 --> 00:25:40,910
Oh, I do like lavender.

548
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,326
That reminds me of a funny story.

549
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:44,296
Hilarious.

550
00:25:44,297 --> 00:25:46,783
Okay, into the bath. Chop chop.

551
00:25:52,492 --> 00:25:54,673
Karen! Is that for me? How thoughtful.

552
00:25:54,674 --> 00:25:57,006
No, it's for Roy,
kind of a peace offering.

553
00:25:57,007 --> 00:26:00,457
No. I mean, don't back down.

554
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:02,087
I've only lived with the guy for one day,

555
00:26:02,088 --> 00:26:03,923
and I can tell he's a handful.

556
00:26:04,237 --> 00:26:06,861
Well, the truth is, I'm the handful,

557
00:26:06,914 --> 00:26:08,324
and I really need to talk to him.

558
00:26:08,325 --> 00:26:10,837
I have to clear the air
about a few things.

559
00:26:10,883 --> 00:26:13,432
Mm. Uh, I don't think that's gonna work.

560
00:26:13,433 --> 00:26:15,320
Why not? Is he still angry?

561
00:26:15,321 --> 00:26:16,460
Livid.

562
00:26:16,531 --> 00:26:20,693
Yeah, he took an ax to
a tree in my backyard.

563
00:26:21,229 --> 00:26:22,682
He just kept hacking at it

564
00:26:22,683 --> 00:26:26,625
and muttering "Take that,
Karen!" under his breath.

565
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:27,991
- Really?
- Yeah,

566
00:26:27,992 --> 00:26:30,784
you should go and look.
Nothing left but a stump.

567
00:26:31,021 --> 00:26:32,120
Oh.

568
00:26:32,635 --> 00:26:33,967
Okay.

569
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:38,232
You know what? Don't worry.
You let me work on him.

570
00:26:38,233 --> 00:26:40,234
I bet you he'll come around in,

571
00:26:40,511 --> 00:26:42,396
I don't know, 16 days.

572
00:26:42,981 --> 00:26:44,679
Well, can you give this to him anyhow?

573
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,084
It's french apple. It's his favorite.

574
00:26:47,085 --> 00:26:48,861
I will make sure he gets it.

575
00:26:48,862 --> 00:26:49,976
Yeah.

576
00:26:56,186 --> 00:26:57,579
Make this disappear.

577
00:26:59,156 --> 00:27:01,019
If you insist.

578
00:27:08,772 --> 00:27:09,894
Hey.

579
00:27:09,895 --> 00:27:11,059
Hey.

580
00:27:12,001 --> 00:27:13,233
You okay?

581
00:27:13,371 --> 00:27:16,294
They say they want to run more tests,
but I'm fine.

582
00:27:16,295 --> 00:27:18,132
Well, you look like crap.

583
00:27:18,231 --> 00:27:21,261
Thanks. So other than boosting my spirits,

584
00:27:21,262 --> 00:27:23,284
uh, what are you here for?

585
00:27:23,285 --> 00:27:26,372
Mike told me you borrowed
money from a loan shark.

586
00:27:27,177 --> 00:27:28,546
Mike should learn to keep his mouth shut.

587
00:27:28,547 --> 00:27:30,966
Look, I don't want
you reading anything into this.

588
00:27:30,967 --> 00:27:33,023
I just don't want to see you dead,

589
00:27:33,024 --> 00:27:34,926
from that guy or stress.

590
00:27:34,927 --> 00:27:37,209
So how much do you need?

591
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:40,160
From you? Not a cent.

592
00:27:40,161 --> 00:27:41,632
Ben, don't be stupid.

593
00:27:41,633 --> 00:27:44,191
You're in trouble. I can help you.

594
00:27:44,192 --> 00:27:45,433
You want to help me?

595
00:27:47,554 --> 00:27:49,878
Wait till I get myself out of this mess,

596
00:27:49,879 --> 00:27:50,954
then let me come back to you

597
00:27:50,955 --> 00:27:53,411
and apologize to you for what I did,

598
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:57,697
then allow me to propose to you again...

599
00:27:58,636 --> 00:28:01,107
this time as the kind of man you deserve.

600
00:28:02,217 --> 00:28:03,326
Wow.

601
00:28:03,327 --> 00:28:05,973
I mean it. I'm still crazy about you.

602
00:28:05,974 --> 00:28:07,390
That's terrific.

603
00:28:07,391 --> 00:28:09,967
But if you don't pay those
thugs what you owe them,

604
00:28:09,968 --> 00:28:11,885
they're gonna disassemble you.

605
00:28:12,496 --> 00:28:14,053
And if we're getting back together,

606
00:28:14,054 --> 00:28:16,856
I want the whole package,

607
00:28:17,105 --> 00:28:19,010
not just parts.

608
00:28:19,646 --> 00:28:22,455
Well, don't worry about me.
I can take care of myself.

609
00:28:22,574 --> 00:28:23,766
Yeah.

610
00:28:24,105 --> 00:28:25,935
You're doing a hell of a job.

611
00:28:32,517 --> 00:28:35,178
Is there a better way
to wake up from a nap

612
00:28:35,179 --> 00:28:38,396
then to the smell of
fresh-baked croissants?

613
00:28:38,997 --> 00:28:43,123
The question is rhetorical,
but the answer is still no.

614
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,614
I've left some for you.

615
00:28:46,811 --> 00:28:48,695
These are for the girls.

616
00:28:48,706 --> 00:28:49,915
The girls?

617
00:28:50,074 --> 00:28:52,638
Yes. I've been doing some thinking,

618
00:28:52,639 --> 00:28:56,019
and it's time for reconciliation.

619
00:28:57,198 --> 00:29:00,610
What a good heart you have, my dear.

620
00:29:00,704 --> 00:29:02,376
But you also have a good head,

621
00:29:02,377 --> 00:29:04,132
and maybe you should give
this a second thought.

622
00:29:04,133 --> 00:29:05,928
No, I've given it a lot of thought,

623
00:29:05,929 --> 00:29:09,198
and there's blame enough for
all four of us in what happened.

624
00:29:09,199 --> 00:29:12,830
Beside if you think about it,
they actually help save me.

625
00:29:12,831 --> 00:29:13,641
How?

626
00:29:13,642 --> 00:29:14,983
By calling you.

627
00:29:15,009 --> 00:29:17,417
You told me so yourself
that night outside the bar.

628
00:29:17,418 --> 00:29:20,475
And if they hadn't, who knows
what might have happened to me?

629
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,802
Well, I-I suppose one could
make that argument, but...

630
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:25,746
But nothing. I am gonna thank them

631
00:29:25,747 --> 00:29:27,601
for bringing you back into my life

632
00:29:27,602 --> 00:29:30,017
and tell them about our trip together.

633
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,417
And besides,

634
00:29:31,761 --> 00:29:34,239
it's time one of us made the first move.

635
00:29:36,296 --> 00:29:37,558
They already did.

636
00:29:38,019 --> 00:29:39,272
I'm sorry?

637
00:29:40,108 --> 00:29:43,893
They came by the other day when
I was outside checking the ramp.

638
00:29:44,316 --> 00:29:46,130
I didn't tell you because...

639
00:29:46,821 --> 00:29:48,889
it was an unkind visit.

640
00:29:49,868 --> 00:29:51,250
What are you talking about?

641
00:29:51,251 --> 00:29:52,591
At first, I thought they were here

642
00:29:52,592 --> 00:29:55,243
to apologize for how they treated you.

643
00:29:55,272 --> 00:29:57,838
But then the comments started...

644
00:29:57,862 --> 00:30:00,749
how you "Deserve" what happened

645
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,138
and how they regret calling me

646
00:30:02,139 --> 00:30:04,970
because now I was "Stuck" with you.

647
00:30:06,347 --> 00:30:07,995
They said those things?

648
00:30:08,586 --> 00:30:10,191
And more.

649
00:30:10,393 --> 00:30:11,716
Worse.

650
00:30:17,138 --> 00:30:19,538
I swore I wasn't gonna tell you, Bree,

651
00:30:19,539 --> 00:30:21,818
but I couldn't let you humiliate yourself

652
00:30:21,819 --> 00:30:26,267
by extending kindness to
people so undeserving of it.

653
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:31,966
No, I'm glad you didn't hide it from me.

654
00:30:36,527 --> 00:30:39,286
You're always trying to
protect me, aren't you?

655
00:30:44,035 --> 00:30:46,433
Lynette, oh, I'm so glad
you could come over.

656
00:30:46,434 --> 00:30:48,419
Oh, you said you wanted to talk.
What's going on?

657
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,646
Come sit down.

658
00:30:49,904 --> 00:30:51,787
Put your feet up.

659
00:30:52,695 --> 00:30:53,893
Have a cookie.

660
00:30:54,179 --> 00:30:55,336
Okay.

661
00:30:57,842 --> 00:30:58,980
Look at us,

662
00:30:59,444 --> 00:31:01,646
beings friends...

663
00:31:02,707 --> 00:31:04,406
eating cookies.

664
00:31:07,024 --> 00:31:10,790
Can you imagine us being even
closer than we are right now?

665
00:31:12,132 --> 00:31:15,365
Um... I think we're pretty close already.

666
00:31:15,366 --> 00:31:16,541
I'm just saying,

667
00:31:16,745 --> 00:31:19,924
wouldn't it be great if we were family?

668
00:31:19,966 --> 00:31:22,205
Okay, Susan, if you need
a ride to the airport...

669
00:31:22,206 --> 00:31:24,107
No, not that.

670
00:31:24,888 --> 00:31:28,539
I just want to share some amazing news...

671
00:31:29,452 --> 00:31:30,891
about our children.

672
00:31:32,053 --> 00:31:33,251
No!

673
00:31:33,317 --> 00:31:35,622
No! No! No! He can't be having a baby!

674
00:31:35,623 --> 00:31:37,809
Here! Honey, breathe into this!

675
00:31:40,237 --> 00:31:42,422
Okay. It's gonna be okay.

676
00:31:42,979 --> 00:31:45,071
Julie's gonna give
the baby up for adoption.

677
00:31:45,072 --> 00:31:46,749
I don't know why people do this.

678
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:49,131
Uh, actually, in a very mature move,

679
00:31:49,132 --> 00:31:51,858
Porter says he wants to keep the baby.

680
00:31:52,551 --> 00:31:53,266
What?

681
00:31:53,267 --> 00:31:55,739
Yeah. He wants to raise it himself.

682
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:58,260
He can't raise a baby!

683
00:31:58,261 --> 00:31:59,532
He can't even take care of himself.

684
00:31:59,533 --> 00:32:02,293
All he eats are frozen waffles...
still frozen!

685
00:32:02,294 --> 00:32:04,415
Okay, you just need to calm down.

686
00:32:04,416 --> 00:32:07,132
No, what I need is...
is a time machine to go back there

687
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:08,994
so I can slap some sense into that idiot.

688
00:32:08,995 --> 00:32:11,038
In fact, I'm gonna do
the slapping part right now.

689
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:14,147
No, no, no, no. You...
you can't be mad at Porter.

690
00:32:14,148 --> 00:32:15,287
I mean, you should've heard the way

691
00:32:15,288 --> 00:32:18,243
he was talking about the baby.
He's so excited.

692
00:32:18,244 --> 00:32:20,921
Yeah, and he'll stay
excited for about a week,

693
00:32:20,922 --> 00:32:23,640
just like he did with the puppy
we gave him in fifth grade.

694
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:25,490
- Know what happened to that puppy?
- No.

695
00:32:25,491 --> 00:32:28,828
No one does. And...
and what was Julie thinking?

696
00:32:28,829 --> 00:32:29,355
Julie?

697
00:32:29,355 --> 00:32:31,915
Yeah, she should have some sense.
She's getting a PhD.

698
00:32:31,917 --> 00:32:34,155
My kid eats waffsicles.

699
00:32:34,156 --> 00:32:36,092
You're missing the point here.

700
00:32:36,093 --> 00:32:37,127
- Your son...
- Yeah.

701
00:32:37,128 --> 00:32:40,856
And my daughter... they made this
sweet little baby together,

702
00:32:40,857 --> 00:32:42,537
and we could help raise it.

703
00:32:42,538 --> 00:32:48,031
Oh. I... I already have
a sweet little baby,

704
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:50,156
who is only months away from day care.

705
00:32:50,157 --> 00:32:53,241
I am not going right
back to the beginning.

706
00:32:53,378 --> 00:32:54,506
I see.

707
00:32:54,507 --> 00:32:58,949
You're afraid of being inconvenienced,

708
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:02,049
so you want to give
the baby away to strangers.

709
00:33:03,037 --> 00:33:04,316
No.

710
00:33:05,645 --> 00:33:06,918
I want to give that baby away

711
00:33:06,919 --> 00:33:08,671
to people who are ready to be parents.

712
00:33:08,672 --> 00:33:10,521
It's better for Porter,
it's better for Julie,

713
00:33:10,522 --> 00:33:13,006
And it's sure as hell
better for that baby.

714
00:33:27,883 --> 00:33:29,496
- Hey!
- Look at what I'm doing.

715
00:33:29,497 --> 00:33:31,942
- Pay attention to me. Tell me I'm great.
- What is happening?

716
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:34,478
I'm thirsty. I want a glass of water now!

717
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:35,835
Water! Water! Water!

718
00:33:35,836 --> 00:33:38,003
Oh. You're a baby. I get it.

719
00:33:38,004 --> 00:33:41,051
No, Porter, you don't get it.

720
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:44,435
When this baby comes,
it's gonna want food and clothes

721
00:33:44,436 --> 00:33:45,521
and a home to live in,

722
00:33:45,522 --> 00:33:48,481
because babies are selfish that way.

723
00:33:48,482 --> 00:33:49,740
I think I can handle it.

724
00:33:49,741 --> 00:33:51,208
Are you serious?

725
00:33:51,209 --> 00:33:52,960
You've never been able
to commit to anything.

726
00:33:52,961 --> 00:33:54,973
Maybe if Julie was giving
birth to a video game

727
00:33:54,974 --> 00:33:56,362
or a new porn site,

728
00:33:56,363 --> 00:33:59,249
but there is no way in hell
you are ready for this!

729
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:01,194
- Can I talk now?
- Yes, go ahead, but if I happen

730
00:34:01,195 --> 00:34:03,725
to roll my eyes and snort,
just know I was provoked.

731
00:34:03,726 --> 00:34:05,471
Everything you said is true.

732
00:34:06,186 --> 00:34:08,042
I-I'm not ready for this.

733
00:34:08,116 --> 00:34:09,940
I have $17 in my checking account

734
00:34:09,941 --> 00:34:12,401
and no clue how to write a resume.

735
00:34:12,662 --> 00:34:14,299
Yeah, a couple days ago,
that didn't bother me,

736
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,957
but now it's all I can think about.

737
00:34:15,958 --> 00:34:17,755
Well, you're gonna have
to do more than think.

738
00:34:17,756 --> 00:34:20,482
I will. I'll get a job.
I'll take... I'll take classes.

739
00:34:20,483 --> 00:34:22,308
I'll do whatever it takes.

740
00:34:24,342 --> 00:34:25,598
Okay.

741
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,559
Okay, that's great, but...

742
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:33,988
when you are a parent,

743
00:34:34,317 --> 00:34:37,363
there is so much you are
gonna have to give up.

744
00:34:37,364 --> 00:34:40,225
Your whole life just...

745
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:45,253
It is gonna change forever.

746
00:34:46,107 --> 00:34:47,456
It already has.

747
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:50,231
She's not even born yet,
and I can't believe

748
00:34:50,232 --> 00:34:53,752
how much I'm dying to... see her.

749
00:34:54,852 --> 00:34:56,076
Mom...

750
00:34:57,018 --> 00:34:58,441
I love her.

751
00:34:58,702 --> 00:35:01,133
I really, really love her.

752
00:35:12,315 --> 00:35:14,682
I hope you're happy,
Porter hired a lawyer.

753
00:35:14,746 --> 00:35:15,892
He wants to raise the baby.

754
00:35:15,893 --> 00:35:18,263
Hey, is that such a terrible thing?

755
00:35:18,422 --> 00:35:21,864
I mean, he's not gonna be doing
it on his own. I'll help.

756
00:35:21,865 --> 00:35:23,415
You think that makes it better?

757
00:35:23,416 --> 00:35:26,495
Now when I come home,
I'll have to see her.

758
00:35:26,596 --> 00:35:29,476
Do you have any idea how
painful that's gonna be?

759
00:35:30,786 --> 00:35:32,076
I just...

760
00:35:32,662 --> 00:35:35,304
want to forget this ever happened.

761
00:35:36,172 --> 00:35:38,400
Julie, it's your daughter.

762
00:35:38,885 --> 00:35:40,864
You're never gonna forget.

763
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:43,557
You don't know that.

764
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:44,988
Yes, I do,

765
00:35:45,702 --> 00:35:48,237
because I've had a daughter.

766
00:35:49,054 --> 00:35:52,562
You can't possibly understand
this until you have one, too,

767
00:35:52,563 --> 00:35:56,261
but every single day
that you're not with me,

768
00:35:56,262 --> 00:35:58,116
I think about you.

769
00:35:59,495 --> 00:36:01,974
I wonder what you're doing,

770
00:36:02,054 --> 00:36:04,148
I worry if you're safe,

771
00:36:05,509 --> 00:36:08,284
and I hope you are happy.

772
00:36:11,543 --> 00:36:12,677
No!

773
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,412
This was my decision to make,

774
00:36:16,809 --> 00:36:18,528
and you took it away.

775
00:36:20,558 --> 00:36:22,476
I can't forgive you for that.

776
00:36:30,718 --> 00:36:34,048
Oh, there you are.
I can't get Celia to take a bath.

777
00:36:34,049 --> 00:36:35,946
Do you still have that dummy grenade?

778
00:36:39,532 --> 00:36:40,833
You okay?

779
00:36:41,988 --> 00:36:46,378
I just didn't think
it was gonna end like this.

780
00:36:46,379 --> 00:36:48,466
After all these years,

781
00:36:48,467 --> 00:36:51,286
I thought I'd finally found the one.

782
00:36:52,646 --> 00:36:54,620
Oh, it's just a rough patch.

783
00:36:54,621 --> 00:36:56,796
You two will come out of
this stronger than ever.

784
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:58,745
I don't know about that.

785
00:36:58,746 --> 00:37:01,417
At my age, falling in love

786
00:37:01,418 --> 00:37:06,052
is not about all that drama
you young people go through.

787
00:37:06,226 --> 00:37:10,028
It's about finding
the one who'll be there,

788
00:37:10,683 --> 00:37:13,558
holding your hands, at the end.

789
00:37:14,453 --> 00:37:15,698
I thought...

790
00:37:15,982 --> 00:37:19,641
Karen would be that person for me.

791
00:37:19,835 --> 00:37:22,935
But I-I guess I was wrong.

792
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:39,365
So we got your M.R.I. back,

793
00:37:39,846 --> 00:37:44,642
and I'm afraid the results
are not what we'd hoped for.

794
00:37:44,643 --> 00:37:46,297
The cancer is back.

795
00:37:46,298 --> 00:37:49,275
It's metastasized to the brain.

796
00:37:52,888 --> 00:37:55,958
So the drugs have stopped working, huh?

797
00:37:55,959 --> 00:37:57,408
I'm afraid so.

798
00:37:57,965 --> 00:37:59,119
But we'll start you

799
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:02,445
on an aggressive course
of radiation right away,

800
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:05,362
and there are new therapies we can try.

801
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:08,460
Thanks for giving it to me straight.

802
00:38:10,238 --> 00:38:11,513
Karen...

803
00:38:13,308 --> 00:38:15,435
We've been through this before,

804
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,640
and you are a fighter,

805
00:38:17,641 --> 00:38:19,660
but this is gonna be tough.

806
00:38:19,698 --> 00:38:23,191
You're gonna need a lot
of support from Roy.

807
00:38:24,647 --> 00:38:27,548
Actually, uh, Roy's out of the picture.

808
00:38:28,193 --> 00:38:29,824
He and I split.

809
00:38:29,883 --> 00:38:31,777
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

810
00:38:32,386 --> 00:38:33,630
I'm not.

811
00:38:34,204 --> 00:38:37,273
He had to watch his first
wife get sick and die.

812
00:38:37,476 --> 00:38:39,097
He doesn't need
to go through that again.

813
00:38:41,501 --> 00:38:42,768
Trust me.

814
00:38:46,621 --> 00:38:48,157
This is for the best.

815
00:39:01,481 --> 00:39:02,208
If you don't mind,

816
00:39:02,209 --> 00:39:04,554
I'd like to just pay the entire bill today

817
00:39:04,555 --> 00:39:06,510
and close out this account.

818
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:11,222
And, uh, I assume
you'll honor our agreement

819
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:13,814
to keep this just between you and me.

820
00:39:13,815 --> 00:39:15,036
Yeah, sure.

821
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:18,101
You have a lovely home.

822
00:39:18,263 --> 00:39:20,509
I can tell you like the finer things.

823
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,438
You were married to that yankee, right?

824
00:39:24,709 --> 00:39:26,335
I heard he cheated on you.

825
00:39:26,336 --> 00:39:29,666
Man, you must have cleaned
up in that divorce.

826
00:39:35,073 --> 00:39:36,704
It always amazes me how much power

827
00:39:36,705 --> 00:39:38,436
is in this little piece of paper.

828
00:39:38,437 --> 00:39:41,789
I mean, with it,
all your problems disappear.

829
00:39:42,021 --> 00:39:43,415
Without it,

830
00:39:43,939 --> 00:39:45,451
your aussie friend...

831
00:39:47,734 --> 00:39:49,180
he ends up begging one of my guys

832
00:39:49,181 --> 00:39:51,165
not to shoot him in the kneecap.

833
00:39:53,244 --> 00:39:56,149
Uh, you... have your money.

834
00:39:56,889 --> 00:39:58,209
Are we done?

835
00:39:58,237 --> 00:39:59,670
Sure, we're done.

836
00:39:59,671 --> 00:40:01,160
Normally, I'd never take a check

837
00:40:01,161 --> 00:40:04,365
but you seem like a classy lady,

838
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:07,147
and I know where you live.

839
00:40:15,223 --> 00:40:16,708
I remember this.

840
00:40:18,001 --> 00:40:19,936
I bought it for you in Milan.

841
00:40:20,395 --> 00:40:21,687
Cashmere.

842
00:40:22,713 --> 00:40:24,482
It's one of my favorites.

843
00:40:25,375 --> 00:40:28,015
Much too fussy for where we're going.

844
00:40:28,774 --> 00:40:32,655
You want to stick with more comfortable,
casual things, Bree.

845
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:35,977
Is everything okay?

846
00:40:35,978 --> 00:40:38,927
Yes. It's just that I don't think

847
00:40:38,928 --> 00:40:41,752
I've ever seen you this confident.

848
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:46,087
Well, I'm not the same
man I was two years ago.

849
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,365
I've let go of a lot,

850
00:40:48,422 --> 00:40:50,301
changed my life completely.

851
00:40:50,495 --> 00:40:51,988
How did you do that?

852
00:40:52,009 --> 00:40:55,592
Well, it started when
I learned to drive again.

853
00:40:55,832 --> 00:40:56,943
- Really?
- Mm.

854
00:40:57,519 --> 00:40:58,548
I know it sounds strange,

855
00:40:58,549 --> 00:41:03,908
but for me, in my condition,
that freedom changed everything.

856
00:41:08,979 --> 00:41:09,702
Driving was a way

857
00:41:09,703 --> 00:41:12,190
for me to move forward with my life,

858
00:41:12,988 --> 00:41:14,910
to let go of the past.

859
00:41:18,825 --> 00:41:22,793
Being on the road gave
me a new perspective.

860
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,496
I started to see the silver lining

861
00:41:28,497 --> 00:41:30,957
in even the worst situations.

862
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:36,940
I learned to be calmer,

863
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:38,679
more patient.

864
00:41:40,827 --> 00:41:44,049
I even began spending more time in nature.

865
00:41:48,507 --> 00:41:51,551
And I started reaching out to old friends.

866
00:41:57,875 --> 00:41:59,307
It took time,

867
00:41:59,915 --> 00:42:03,081
but little by little, I became a new man.

868
00:42:03,919 --> 00:42:06,192
What an inspiring story.

869
00:42:07,654 --> 00:42:08,682
Perhaps when we're in Maine,

870
00:42:08,683 --> 00:42:12,903
you can help me start
the process of changing my life.

871
00:42:12,904 --> 00:42:14,653
Oh, Bree, don't you see?

872
00:42:15,229 --> 00:42:18,078
The process has already started for you.

873
00:42:19,938 --> 00:42:21,889
I suppose it has.

874
00:42:22,641 --> 00:42:24,145
Trust me, darling.

875
00:42:24,368 --> 00:42:27,259
You won't believe where
it's going to end up.
