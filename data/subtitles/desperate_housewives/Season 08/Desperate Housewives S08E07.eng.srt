1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,410
<i>Previously on...</i>

2
00:00:02,725 --> 00:00:05,203
<i>Lynette confronted Tom's new girlfriend.</i>

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:06,355
You think maybe you could stop

4
00:00:06,388 --> 00:00:07,890
trying to take my husband away from me?

5
00:00:07,972 --> 00:00:09,281
You think I'm gonna give up on him

6
00:00:09,323 --> 00:00:11,622
just because you can't accept
your marriage is over?

7
00:00:11,686 --> 00:00:12,394
Hey, Mike!

8
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,979
<i>Ben found out about Mike's past...</i>

9
00:00:14,997 --> 00:00:15,673
Ex-con?

10
00:00:15,899 --> 00:00:16,831
<i>And hired him.</i>

11
00:00:17,554 --> 00:00:18,960
I can definitely use you.

12
00:00:19,434 --> 00:00:21,883
<i>Bree showed Gaby the threatening note.</i>

13
00:00:22,028 --> 00:00:23,730
I'm sorry to burden you with this...

14
00:00:23,755 --> 00:00:25,033
Why did you have to tell me?

15
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:28,757
<i>And then she discovered
the location of Ben's new development.</i>

16
00:00:29,047 --> 00:00:31,000
We're digging up the body?

17
00:00:31,049 --> 00:00:33,866
Ben's bulldozers start tearing up
the woods tomorrow morning.

18
00:00:33,924 --> 00:00:35,393
Where are Carlos and Susan?

19
00:00:35,499 --> 00:00:36,648
I didn't wanna freak 'em out.

20
00:00:36,665 --> 00:00:39,369
And Susan has done nothing but
freak out, so it's just us.

21
00:00:39,563 --> 00:00:41,802
- </i>But when they got there...</i>
- No!

22
00:00:41,836 --> 00:00:44,866
<i>They found someone had beaten them to it.</i>

23
00:00:51,101 --> 00:00:53,484
<i>No matter what the circumstances,</i>

24
00:00:53,558 --> 00:00:57,304
<i>Bree Van de Kamp always found
a way to stay in control.</i>

25
00:01:00,136 --> 00:01:02,086
<i>She curbed her impulses.</i>

26
00:01:05,214 --> 00:01:07,453
<i>She enforced a strict dress code.</i>

27
00:01:11,768 --> 00:01:14,753
<i>She maintained a strong moral center.</i>

28
00:01:16,894 --> 00:01:19,936
<i>Yes, Bree was always in control,</i>

29
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:22,882
<i>so when it came to handling a crisis...</i>

30
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,668
This is a nightmare. What are we gonna do?

31
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:30,063
<i>It made perfect sense that
she was in the driver's seat.</i>

32
00:01:30,665 --> 00:01:32,341
Yeah. I mean, I can't
believe the worst thing

33
00:01:32,374 --> 00:01:34,902
that happened tonight was not
getting to move a dead body.

34
00:01:34,952 --> 00:01:37,488
Ladies, please,
I need to hear myself think.

35
00:01:38,072 --> 00:01:40,198
Oh, my god! What if he's alive?

36
00:01:40,264 --> 00:01:42,720
Right, and after a 2-month dirt nap,

37
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:43,670
he clawed his way out.

38
00:01:44,048 --> 00:01:45,959
No, someone must have dug him out.

39
00:01:45,976 --> 00:01:48,296
But who? What if it was the cops?

40
00:01:48,639 --> 00:01:50,364
No! I can't go to jail!

41
00:01:50,415 --> 00:01:51,388
What, and we can?

44
00:01:55,678 --> 00:01:57,389
I am so ending up somebody's bitch!

45
00:01:57,446 --> 00:01:59,839
Shh! It wasn't the police.

46
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:01,613
They would have treated
it like a crime scene,

47
00:02:01,646 --> 00:02:04,127
and that awful yellow tape
would have been everywhere.

48
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:07,491
Okay, then. Think about this, Bree.

49
00:02:07,912 --> 00:02:10,686
What if it's someone
who knows what we did,

50
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,381
and it made them sick...

51
00:02:12,431 --> 00:02:13,788
and now they're going to tell?

52
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,275
Why is she talking like that?

53
00:02:15,381 --> 00:02:17,348
Gaby is engaging in wild speculation,

54
00:02:17,382 --> 00:02:18,899
which isn't at all productive.

55
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,857
There has to be a simple explanation.

56
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:25,762
We just need to take
a deep breath and think,

57
00:02:25,795 --> 00:02:27,938
and the answer will be right in front of us.

58
00:02:36,534 --> 00:02:37,113
Susan.

59
00:02:38,077 --> 00:02:40,341
Oh, my god. Of course!

60
00:02:40,398 --> 00:02:42,212
Why would Susan move the body?

61
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,694
Because she's cuckoo crazy.

62
00:02:43,918 --> 00:02:46,005
She's been flipping out ever
since we buried the guy.

63
00:02:46,102 --> 00:02:48,940
Okay, then what if it was her?
What do we do?

64
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,505
We march over and we ask if she did it,

65
00:02:51,522 --> 00:02:52,094
and if she did,

66
00:02:52,143 --> 00:02:54,254
I know an empty grave
that's going to waste.

67
00:02:54,344 --> 00:02:55,468
But if she didn't,

68
00:02:55,494 --> 00:02:57,782
then we just admitted that
we went to the woods without her.

69
00:02:57,807 --> 00:03:00,119
Imagine what cuckoo will do with that.

70
00:03:00,304 --> 00:03:03,666
Clearly, we have to be diplomatic, crafty.

71
00:03:04,028 --> 00:03:07,286
We'll ask indirect questions,
scan her house for clues.

72
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:10,457
We'll gather information
without arousing suspicion.

73
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,803
Okay, Bree. Well, seems like
you got a good handle on this.

74
00:03:18,402 --> 00:03:20,033
Definitely. Let us know how it goes.

75
00:03:22,543 --> 00:03:25,327
<i>Yes, when it came to a crisis,</i>

76
00:03:25,366 --> 00:03:28,732
<i>everyone was happy to have
Bree in the driver's seat...</i>

77
00:03:28,934 --> 00:03:30,852
Fine. I'll talk to Susan.

78
00:03:31,747 --> 00:03:36,118
Even if Bree herself would have
preferred to be a passenger.

79
00:03:48,471 --> 00:03:49,812
<i>As the mother of five,</i>

80
00:03:49,878 --> 00:03:53,329
<i>Lynette scavo was used to
uncomfortable questions.</i>

81
00:03:55,093 --> 00:03:57,019
Why are you eating Santa's cookies?

82
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:03,196
What happened to my goldfish?

83
00:04:07,469 --> 00:04:10,007
Why were you and daddy making
funny noises last night?

84
00:04:12,782 --> 00:04:14,997
<i>Yes, after five children,</i>

85
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:16,893
<i>Lynette thought she'd heard it all,</i>

86
00:04:17,648 --> 00:04:19,518
<i>until there was one question...</i>

87
00:04:20,168 --> 00:04:21,744
Are dad and Jane gonna get married?

88
00:04:22,066 --> 00:04:23,616
<i>She never saw coming.</i>

89
00:04:24,503 --> 00:04:25,479
Why would you ask that?

90
00:04:26,163 --> 00:04:26,774
I don't know.

91
00:04:27,505 --> 00:04:29,088
They're spending a lot
of time together, and...

92
00:04:31,205 --> 00:04:32,514
It's okay. You can say it.

93
00:04:33,414 --> 00:04:34,627
They seem really happy.

94
00:04:35,911 --> 00:04:37,204
You told her to say it.

95
00:04:38,961 --> 00:04:40,817
Honey, just because people are happy

96
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,095
and spend time together,

97
00:04:42,169 --> 00:04:43,559
it doesn't mean they're gonna get married.

98
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,336
I mean, your aunt Renee
and I spend time together.

99
00:04:46,698 --> 00:04:47,837
And we're not getting married

100
00:04:47,862 --> 00:04:49,364
till your mom makes a lot more money.

101
00:04:52,045 --> 00:04:53,249
- I'll get it.
- Yeah.

102
00:04:54,462 --> 00:04:56,979
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
You all ready to see "Wicked"?

103
00:04:57,205 --> 00:04:58,627
- Hello, Lynette.
- Hello.

104
00:04:59,493 --> 00:05:01,087
Oh, my god. Look at your hair.

105
00:05:01,545 --> 00:05:02,687
We're twins.

106
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:05,893
Yes, you are.

107
00:05:06,174 --> 00:05:07,799
Penny, where did you learn to do that?

108
00:05:07,901 --> 00:05:08,850
Jane taught me.

109
00:05:09,911 --> 00:05:11,434
Oh, it's easy. I could teach you, too.

110
00:05:11,489 --> 00:05:12,520
Oh, I know how to do it.

111
00:05:14,167 --> 00:05:15,811
Okay. Uh, we should go.

112
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,003
We might not be home until 11:00.

113
00:05:18,223 --> 00:05:20,095
- On a school night?
- It's my fault.

114
00:05:20,096 --> 00:05:21,540
I went to high school
with the wicked witch,

115
00:05:21,615 --> 00:05:24,333
and she invited us backstage.
Is that okay?

116
00:05:25,563 --> 00:05:26,758
O-oh, my god.

117
00:05:27,498 --> 00:05:28,293
Can I, mom?

118
00:05:29,491 --> 00:05:32,373
What can I say? Since you
asked me in front of Penny.

119
00:05:35,856 --> 00:05:36,891
- Let's go, zuzu.
- Yeah.

120
00:05:37,752 --> 00:05:38,386
Bye.

121
00:05:43,312 --> 00:05:44,154
"Zuzu"?

122
00:05:45,353 --> 00:05:48,328
Yeah. She's got a cute nickname for Penny.

123
00:05:48,926 --> 00:05:52,878
I bet she's got one for you,
too... "doormat."

124
00:05:53,442 --> 00:05:54,092
What?

125
00:05:54,136 --> 00:05:56,093
It's bad enough she stole your husband,

126
00:05:56,368 --> 00:05:58,567
and now you're letting
her take your daughter, too?

127
00:05:58,826 --> 00:06:00,112
What am I supposed to do?

128
00:06:00,113 --> 00:06:02,353
I'm not gonna drag Penny
into the middle of this.

129
00:06:02,354 --> 00:06:05,450
Well, apparently, Jane doesn't
play by the same rules.

130
00:06:06,261 --> 00:06:08,763
I think it's time to fight dirty.

131
00:06:09,585 --> 00:06:10,923
I don't know how to do that.

132
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:12,363
Well, you're in luck.

133
00:06:12,775 --> 00:06:14,573
She might have gone to
school with the wicked witch,

134
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:16,835
but you went to school with me.

135
00:06:20,135 --> 00:06:21,882
It's portfolio review time.

136
00:06:22,029 --> 00:06:24,510
That's the special moment
where I tell you all

137
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,555
how you're letting me down.

138
00:06:26,207 --> 00:06:28,710
Okay, uh, speaking as a former teacher...

139
00:06:28,738 --> 00:06:29,997
Still pontificating.

140
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:31,949
Now some might say,

141
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,768
"He must think pretty highly of himself"

142
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:35,491
"to judge other people so harshly,"

143
00:06:35,504 --> 00:06:38,735
to which I say, yeah, he does.

144
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,439
Can you believe this guy?

145
00:06:40,795 --> 00:06:42,134
I would die for him.

146
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,577
Yeah. That's a healthy attitude.

147
00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:47,455
So while you're opening your portfolios

148
00:06:47,456 --> 00:06:48,582
and arranging your works,

149
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,211
let me tell you what I do not wanna see.

150
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:52,219
Bowls of fruit.

151
00:06:55,678 --> 00:06:56,865
Portraits of children.

152
00:06:59,329 --> 00:07:01,390
Frigid winter landscapes.

153
00:07:02,692 --> 00:07:04,249
Lush summer vistas.

154
00:07:06,689 --> 00:07:09,776
However, I do enjoy a nice ocean scene...

155
00:07:11,302 --> 00:07:12,417
Just so it's not ruined

156
00:07:12,453 --> 00:07:14,754
by the addition of a sad, little sailboat.

157
00:07:16,065 --> 00:07:18,054
Did you look in my portfolio?

158
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:19,556
As a matter of fact, I did.

159
00:07:20,345 --> 00:07:22,663
I wanted to steel myself
for disappointment.

160
00:07:22,955 --> 00:07:25,618
Okay, again, as a former teacher,

161
00:07:26,151 --> 00:07:27,730
that's not how you motivate people.

162
00:07:27,774 --> 00:07:28,802
Apparently not.

163
00:07:28,803 --> 00:07:31,186
You haven't grown an inch
since you started my class.

164
00:07:31,711 --> 00:07:33,662
Your work's the same as it's always been...

165
00:07:33,663 --> 00:07:35,707
technically proficient but totally boring.

166
00:07:36,531 --> 00:07:37,555
You never surprise me.

167
00:07:39,827 --> 00:07:42,457
Amy, on the other hand,
is nothing but surprises.

168
00:07:43,528 --> 00:07:44,185
Thank you.

169
00:07:44,284 --> 00:07:45,143
Don't talk, dear.

170
00:07:46,116 --> 00:07:47,792
Her technique is atrocious.

171
00:07:48,294 --> 00:07:51,148
Cats with crayons could
draw more convincingly,

172
00:07:51,272 --> 00:07:52,802
but what she does is real,

173
00:07:53,136 --> 00:07:54,267
and it bleeds.

174
00:07:54,783 --> 00:07:55,954
And I love it.

175
00:07:59,349 --> 00:08:00,984
I would follow him into hell.

176
00:08:02,574 --> 00:08:03,800
I think we already have.

177
00:08:05,206 --> 00:08:07,448
Celia, get back here! Give me that now!

178
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:09,591
Hey, hey, hey, enough with the screaming!

179
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:11,495
Come on. Sit down. Come on.

180
00:08:17,294 --> 00:08:19,644
What are we having?
Spaghetti and meat-shapes?

181
00:08:19,704 --> 00:08:21,873
Well, they started off as balls.
What do you want from me?

182
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,497
Is daddy eating with us?

183
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,937
No, sweetie. He's taking a nap.

184
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,661
Celia! Use a fork, not the doll.

185
00:08:32,889 --> 00:08:34,734
Mom, remember that cabin on the lake?

186
00:08:34,761 --> 00:08:36,557
Can we rent it again for spring vacation?

187
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:38,918
Spring? It isn't even Thanksgiving yet.

188
00:08:39,876 --> 00:08:42,223
I know, but we always plan
our vacations in the fall.

189
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:44,239
Well...

190
00:08:45,109 --> 00:08:46,513
who knows what we'll be doing then?

191
00:08:46,676 --> 00:08:49,434
Let's... just worry
about that later, okay?

192
00:08:51,146 --> 00:08:54,548
But we know we wanna go there.
Why can't we plan it now?

193
00:08:54,549 --> 00:08:55,287
Will you just stop?!

194
00:08:57,785 --> 00:08:58,795
Just eat your food.

195
00:09:01,364 --> 00:09:02,558
And what am I gonna tell her?

196
00:09:02,594 --> 00:09:04,224
"Sorry, sweetie. We can't rent that cabin"

197
00:09:04,225 --> 00:09:06,271
"'cause daddy and I might
be in jail by spring."

198
00:09:06,627 --> 00:09:08,752
Will you stop? We're not going to jail.

199
00:09:09,068 --> 00:09:10,704
You can't promise that, Carlos.

200
00:09:10,756 --> 00:09:14,027
It's been two months.
Nothing's happened. Relax.

201
00:09:16,026 --> 00:09:17,013
Where's this coming from?

202
00:09:17,546 --> 00:09:20,200
I'm just saying, a cop could
show up at the door any day

203
00:09:20,211 --> 00:09:21,751
and destroy our family.

204
00:09:21,818 --> 00:09:24,128
And we don't even have someone
to take care of the kids.

205
00:09:24,172 --> 00:09:27,291
Sure, we do. We named
a guardian when we did our will.

206
00:09:27,303 --> 00:09:29,822
Yeah, Susan. She'll be my cellmate,

207
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:32,382
and we'll be making license
plates with Bree and Lynette.

208
00:09:32,466 --> 00:09:33,717
Ah, right.

209
00:09:34,298 --> 00:09:36,393
Well, we'll just find someone else.

210
00:09:37,718 --> 00:09:38,744
How about McCluskey?

211
00:09:39,493 --> 00:09:40,287
Are you kidding?

212
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:41,491
I've got meat in the freezer

213
00:09:41,492 --> 00:09:43,201
that's gonna be around longer than she is.

214
00:09:45,369 --> 00:09:47,646
Oh, I know. I know, and they're perfect.

215
00:09:48,034 --> 00:09:49,414
Bob and Lee.

216
00:09:51,353 --> 00:09:52,411
No, think about it.

217
00:09:52,607 --> 00:09:55,946
Two gay guys who could have
been out dancing every night,

218
00:09:55,947 --> 00:09:57,110
adopted a child?

219
00:09:57,162 --> 00:09:58,245
They chose this?

220
00:09:58,705 --> 00:10:01,231
Yeah, what does that tell us?
They're unstable.

221
00:10:02,124 --> 00:10:04,249
No, I'm serious. They're great parents.

222
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:05,505
Yeah, they are.

223
00:10:07,848 --> 00:10:09,956
Okay. Bob and Lee. We'll ask 'em.

224
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,168
But don't worry. We're not going anywhere.

225
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:18,158
Can't promise that.

226
00:10:28,165 --> 00:10:30,619
Dad and Jane are coming.
I'm gonna wait on the porch.

227
00:10:32,628 --> 00:10:34,641
Oh, and Jane's cooking,
so I won't need dinner.

228
00:10:42,782 --> 00:10:43,585
Everything okay?

229
00:10:45,205 --> 00:10:46,730
I'm sorry. I was just looking

230
00:10:46,731 --> 00:10:49,281
at all these pictures in your baby book.

231
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,915
I guess I was getting a little nostalgic.

232
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,872
Mom, my baby book has, like,
five pictures in it.

233
00:10:55,996 --> 00:10:58,930
But they're really good.
You wanna see? Look.

234
00:10:59,182 --> 00:11:02,229
Here's you with me and
your dad at your 1st birthday.

235
00:11:02,485 --> 00:11:03,614
Look at us.

236
00:11:05,187 --> 00:11:07,585
We were really a family then.

237
00:11:10,158 --> 00:11:12,386
We're a family now. Aren't we?

238
00:11:12,487 --> 00:11:15,839
Of course. Oh, of course. It's just...

239
00:11:18,736 --> 00:11:19,508
Just what?

240
00:11:20,104 --> 00:11:21,459
Well, since you asked,

241
00:11:21,952 --> 00:11:23,301
things are going to be different

242
00:11:23,302 --> 00:11:25,315
since your dad brought
Jane into the picture.

243
00:11:27,435 --> 00:11:28,558
You don't like her, do you?

244
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:32,241
Oh, I didn't say that.
She's a very smart lady,

245
00:11:32,365 --> 00:11:35,220
and she obviously knows
how to get what she wants...

246
00:11:35,256 --> 00:11:37,672
medical career, other people's husbands.

247
00:11:38,261 --> 00:11:39,779
But I'm not gonna say anything bad.

248
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,919
I know. You like her.

249
00:11:42,317 --> 00:11:44,490
Well... I thought she was nice.

250
00:11:44,782 --> 00:11:47,318
She is... to you.

251
00:11:47,834 --> 00:11:50,159
Maybe that's because
she's trying to steal you, too.

252
00:11:50,724 --> 00:11:51,499
But like I said,

253
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,629
I don't wanna say anything bad.

254
00:11:52,977 --> 00:11:54,501
You should go wait out on the porch.

255
00:11:54,528 --> 00:11:56,430
You don't need to sit
here listening to my...

256
00:11:58,028 --> 00:11:59,424
legitimate whining.

257
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:02,393
I don't wanna go over there.

258
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:07,743
I wanna stay here... with you.

259
00:12:08,187 --> 00:12:11,548
Well, if you feel strongly about it,

260
00:12:11,549 --> 00:12:12,716
and I can tell you do,

261
00:12:12,717 --> 00:12:15,106
I could call your dad and make an excuse.

262
00:12:15,663 --> 00:12:16,386
Would you?

263
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:19,605
Sweetie, I would do anything for you.

264
00:12:19,695 --> 00:12:21,034
You are my daughter...

265
00:12:21,568 --> 00:12:23,605
my biological daughter.

266
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:27,264
Thanks. I love you, mom.

267
00:12:27,629 --> 00:12:29,713
I love you, too, bobo.

268
00:12:32,659 --> 00:12:33,502
"Bobo"?

269
00:12:35,093 --> 00:12:35,918
We'll work on it.

270
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:41,975
Ugh! I hate you, Andre!

271
00:12:43,917 --> 00:12:44,639
Susan.

272
00:12:45,525 --> 00:12:47,939
I rang your doorbell twice.
Is everything okay?

273
00:12:47,949 --> 00:12:50,251
Oh, I can't get his voice out of my head.

274
00:12:51,449 --> 00:12:52,187
Voice?

275
00:12:52,904 --> 00:12:55,958
Yeah. He keeps telling me how bad I am.

276
00:12:56,298 --> 00:12:56,924
Oh, really?

277
00:12:57,873 --> 00:13:01,218
Uh, does this voice also
tell you to do things?

278
00:13:01,659 --> 00:13:03,676
Sorry. I know I must sound crazy.

279
00:13:03,677 --> 00:13:08,475
It's just, I've been staring at
this blank canvas for two days.

280
00:13:08,476 --> 00:13:10,326
I don't sleep. I don't eat.

281
00:13:10,404 --> 00:13:11,663
Do you dig things up?

282
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,912
- What?
- What?

283
00:13:14,404 --> 00:13:17,174
Did you just ask me if I dug something up?

284
00:13:17,507 --> 00:13:20,649
Oh! I think someone's been staring
at a blank canvas too long.

285
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,451
Bree, what's going on?

286
00:13:24,104 --> 00:13:25,027
Why are you here?

287
00:13:29,093 --> 00:13:31,643
Okay, I'm just gonna come
right out and ask you.

288
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:33,226
- Did you...
- Hey.

289
00:13:33,767 --> 00:13:34,858
Mike, what are you doing home?

290
00:13:34,998 --> 00:13:37,130
I-I thought you were
meeting Ben about the job.

291
00:13:37,182 --> 00:13:39,243
Yeah, I was, and then he called
and said he had to cancel.

292
00:13:39,864 --> 00:13:41,283
Something happened at the site,

293
00:13:41,447 --> 00:13:43,059
and they had to shut
down the whole project.

294
00:13:43,703 --> 00:13:44,461
That's weird.

295
00:13:44,726 --> 00:13:46,498
Y-yeah. Did he say what it was?

296
00:13:47,113 --> 00:13:47,818
No.

297
00:13:48,367 --> 00:13:49,611
But he sure didn't sound good.

298
00:13:54,641 --> 00:13:56,165
Well, I really should be going.

299
00:13:56,722 --> 00:13:59,384
Wait. You said you were
gonna ask me something.

300
00:14:00,154 --> 00:14:00,992
No, I didn't.

301
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,183
You really need to get away
from those paint fumes.

302
00:14:10,338 --> 00:14:11,301
Guardians?

303
00:14:11,737 --> 00:14:12,443
Yeah!

304
00:14:12,455 --> 00:14:14,895
You know, in case something happens to us,

305
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:17,615
we think you guys would be
terrific parents to our girls.

306
00:14:19,129 --> 00:14:19,947
What an honor.

307
00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:23,487
Well, you know, we love Juanita and...

308
00:14:24,574 --> 00:14:26,473
- the other one.
- Celia.

309
00:14:26,502 --> 00:14:27,360
Tip of my tongue.

310
00:14:27,827 --> 00:14:30,557
But you have so many
closer friends on the lane.

311
00:14:30,558 --> 00:14:31,352
What about Susan?

312
00:14:31,677 --> 00:14:32,895
Yeah, that'd never work.

313
00:14:33,548 --> 00:14:34,190
Why not?

314
00:14:34,522 --> 00:14:36,583
Um, well, Susan...

315
00:14:37,436 --> 00:14:37,989
is...

316
00:14:38,189 --> 00:14:39,020
a racist.

317
00:14:40,371 --> 00:14:42,361
What? I-I've known her for years.

318
00:14:42,362 --> 00:14:44,175
I've never seen her be racist.

319
00:14:44,691 --> 00:14:45,775
- It's new.
- Yeah.

320
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,567
What about Bree?

321
00:14:47,947 --> 00:14:51,461
Yeah! An alcoholic with
a house full of guns? Genius.

322
00:14:52,005 --> 00:14:54,358
Lynette? McCluskey? Anyone at all?

323
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:55,901
Hang on.

324
00:14:57,613 --> 00:14:59,338
You guys have a problem
with the girls?

325
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,249
It's just, we're still learning
how to take care of one kid.

326
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:04,066
You've got two, and they're both...

327
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:07,147
You know.

328
00:15:08,061 --> 00:15:09,004
What?

329
00:15:09,004 --> 00:15:10,340
Monsters.

330
00:15:10,783 --> 00:15:13,153
You know it. We know it.
Why are we dancing around it?

331
00:15:13,153 --> 00:15:14,510
I was gonna say "Spirited."

332
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:17,469
No, no, no, no.
See, they used to be like that.

333
00:15:17,469 --> 00:15:19,325
They've changed. They're all grown up now.

334
00:15:19,737 --> 00:15:20,950
I babysat them two months ago.

335
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:23,621
Juanita punched me in the neck,
and the other one bit me.

336
00:15:23,621 --> 00:15:25,995
Celia. Her name is Celia.

337
00:15:25,995 --> 00:15:27,081
Okay, you know, seriously, guys,

338
00:15:27,081 --> 00:15:28,691
they're like different people now.

339
00:15:28,691 --> 00:15:30,647
So well-behaved.

340
00:15:30,647 --> 00:15:33,768
Yeah. Y-you have to see it to believe it.

341
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:37,915
You know what? That's a great idea.

342
00:15:38,908 --> 00:15:40,002
What? What is?

343
00:15:40,863 --> 00:15:43,004
Why don't you have us
over for dinner tomorrow?

344
00:15:43,816 --> 00:15:47,027
And we can see how
well-behaved they truly are.

345
00:15:49,495 --> 00:15:50,605
Oh, my god!

346
00:15:50,605 --> 00:15:52,763
That is a great idea.

347
00:15:53,464 --> 00:15:56,024
But I don't know about tomorrow,
because the girls...

348
00:15:56,426 --> 00:15:59,382
are busy with their bible pageant,

349
00:15:59,382 --> 00:16:02,323
and their extensive charity work.

350
00:16:02,323 --> 00:16:03,487
Tomorrow.

351
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:05,372
Tomorrow.

352
00:16:06,459 --> 00:16:08,101
- Bye, guys.
- See you at dinner.

353
00:16:09,531 --> 00:16:10,683
- We're dead.
- Yeah.

354
00:16:16,252 --> 00:16:19,358
Okay, Bob and Lee are coming
over for dinner tonight.

355
00:16:19,358 --> 00:16:21,128
That gives me nine hours to teach you

356
00:16:21,128 --> 00:16:24,022
to be courteous, gracious,
and well-mannered...

357
00:16:24,022 --> 00:16:26,781
exact opposite of what you usually are.

358
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,610
This is why you kept us home from school?

359
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:33,623
Oh, you're in school,
and class is in session.

360
00:16:34,073 --> 00:16:36,983
Okay, now which one is the salad fork?

361
00:16:37,485 --> 00:16:38,608
What's salad?

362
00:16:43,918 --> 00:16:46,446
When is the last time you brushed your...

363
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,662
Is this a lollipop?!

364
00:16:51,756 --> 00:16:53,582
Told you it wasn't a good hiding place.

365
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:56,978
Come on. Think!

366
00:16:56,978 --> 00:17:00,008
Who won the Tony for best musical in 1995?

367
00:17:00,459 --> 00:17:03,490
This is too hard. Why can't
gay people like cartoons?

368
00:17:05,719 --> 00:17:07,394
Did you get that out of the garbage?

369
00:17:14,653 --> 00:17:15,914
Didn't you get my message?

370
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:18,471
About Penny not being
able to come over? Yeah.

371
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:20,601
Been getting a lot of
those messages lately.

372
00:17:20,601 --> 00:17:22,476
Penny?! So why are you here?

373
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:24,224
To see my daughter.

374
00:17:26,714 --> 00:17:28,067
I wanna find out what's going on.

375
00:17:29,101 --> 00:17:30,464
Hey!

376
00:17:30,837 --> 00:17:31,801
Hey, dad.

377
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,746
I haven't seen you this week.

378
00:17:33,746 --> 00:17:34,939
Is everything okay?

379
00:17:34,939 --> 00:17:37,800
Yeah. I've just had a lot
of homework and stuff.

380
00:17:38,281 --> 00:17:39,486
Why don't you do it at my place?

381
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,031
You know, if it... if it's science,

382
00:17:42,031 --> 00:17:45,771
Jane lives right upstairs,
and she's a real Brainiac.

383
00:17:45,771 --> 00:17:46,885
No, thanks.

384
00:17:48,571 --> 00:17:49,936
I'd rather have mom help.

385
00:17:58,145 --> 00:18:00,091
Do you have a problem with Jane, sweetie?

386
00:18:05,468 --> 00:18:07,310
I've got a really big test
tomorrow, so I should...

387
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:09,851
Hang on. Hang on.

388
00:18:10,342 --> 00:18:14,256
May-maybe you and I need
a little one-on-one time.

389
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:17,324
You-you remember that park where
I taught you to play catch?

390
00:18:18,879 --> 00:18:22,392
Well, I'm gonna be there
tomorrow after school... just me.

391
00:18:22,871 --> 00:18:25,626
We can hang out or...
or do whatever you want.

392
00:18:26,107 --> 00:18:27,072
What do you say?

393
00:18:27,513 --> 00:18:28,526
Okay.

394
00:18:38,459 --> 00:18:41,033
That's weird. Penny and Jane
were getting along great,

395
00:18:41,067 --> 00:18:42,835
and then, uh, all of a sudden...

396
00:18:42,869 --> 00:18:43,724
All of a sudden what?

397
00:18:43,724 --> 00:18:45,803
Did you say anything to her
about not liking Jane?

398
00:18:46,264 --> 00:18:48,621
Penny's a big girl.
She has her own opinions.

399
00:18:51,058 --> 00:18:51,992
Okay.

400
00:18:52,483 --> 00:18:54,056
I just wanna make sure that we remember

401
00:18:54,056 --> 00:18:57,921
that this thing between us
is between us, not the kids.

402
00:18:57,921 --> 00:18:59,781
Hey, don't blame me.

403
00:18:59,781 --> 00:19:01,591
I'm not the one who
jumped into a relationship

404
00:19:01,591 --> 00:19:03,125
without thinking about the consequences.

405
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:05,375
You made your bed... with someone else.

406
00:19:06,389 --> 00:19:08,063
I'm gonna go help our
daughter with her homework.

407
00:19:23,944 --> 00:19:25,133
Bree?

408
00:19:26,727 --> 00:19:27,770
Hello.

409
00:19:28,141 --> 00:19:30,672
I wanted to celebrate
your first day of construction

410
00:19:31,384 --> 00:19:32,367
with lunch.

411
00:19:32,801 --> 00:19:34,025
I'm already eating.

412
00:19:36,552 --> 00:19:38,570
There was a little problem.

413
00:19:39,584 --> 00:19:42,975
Really? I hope you don't
think me nosy if I ask...

414
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,687
My guys found a body buried in the woods.

415
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:48,946
Oh, my. Did you call the police?

416
00:19:48,946 --> 00:19:50,080
Not yet.

417
00:19:55,019 --> 00:19:57,899
So they found a body. How?

418
00:19:57,899 --> 00:19:59,869
Uh, doing soil samples.

419
00:19:59,869 --> 00:20:02,249
Um, they dug it up halloween night,

420
00:20:02,249 --> 00:20:04,065
put it in a storage shed.

421
00:20:04,545 --> 00:20:06,523
And why have you waited
so long to call the police?

422
00:20:07,023 --> 00:20:09,243
'Cause I keep hoping
I'll find a way out of this.

423
00:20:10,184 --> 00:20:11,269
'Cause once I call,

424
00:20:11,269 --> 00:20:13,186
my project becomes a crime scene.

425
00:20:13,186 --> 00:20:15,498
They shut it down. I lose a lot of time,

426
00:20:15,498 --> 00:20:18,317
and... a lot of money.

427
00:20:20,313 --> 00:20:21,326
What a shame.

428
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,592
It must be so tempting to just...

429
00:20:25,295 --> 00:20:27,080
make the body disappear.

430
00:20:29,067 --> 00:20:32,308
I'm sure you've considered re-burying it

431
00:20:32,308 --> 00:20:35,489
or dissolving it in acid or
wrapping it in heavy chains

432
00:20:35,489 --> 00:20:37,397
and dropping it in a lake.

433
00:20:39,443 --> 00:20:41,019
I'm sure you've considered that.

434
00:20:42,203 --> 00:20:43,515
Y-yeah, yeah. Of course I have.

435
00:20:43,897 --> 00:20:48,432
Uh... but if I hide this,
and it comes out later,

436
00:20:48,893 --> 00:20:50,379
I'm committing a felony.

437
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,013
And I...

438
00:20:52,013 --> 00:20:53,508
I can't take that risk.

439
00:20:53,991 --> 00:20:57,110
I know, but think of all
the people who'll lose their jobs,

440
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,415
and-and what about the...

441
00:20:58,415 --> 00:21:00,256
the poor men who dug up the body?

442
00:21:00,256 --> 00:21:01,738
They-they could face charges.

443
00:21:01,738 --> 00:21:03,353
I know that, Bree.

444
00:21:07,789 --> 00:21:10,019
I'm sorry. You're just
saying the same stuff

445
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,535
I've been thinking all day.

446
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:17,798
But there's no way out of this.

447
00:21:20,999 --> 00:21:22,404
There isn't, is there?

448
00:21:27,725 --> 00:21:29,993
I got to go call the cops,
get this over with.

449
00:21:58,913 --> 00:21:59,957
Bree?

450
00:22:13,837 --> 00:22:15,474
He was a horrible man.

451
00:22:16,883 --> 00:22:18,828
Wh-what? You know who this was?

452
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:21,026
He hurt a child...

453
00:22:22,714 --> 00:22:24,690
Someone I care about very much,

454
00:22:26,617 --> 00:22:28,081
and he was gonna hurt her again.

455
00:22:35,914 --> 00:22:37,449
Bree, did you kill him?

456
00:22:40,388 --> 00:22:41,641
Well, tell me you didn't kill him.

457
00:22:41,641 --> 00:22:43,688
I need to know before I go to the police.

458
00:22:43,688 --> 00:22:45,133
I didn't kill him.

459
00:22:46,659 --> 00:22:48,873
My friend did, and I helped bury him here.

460
00:22:48,873 --> 00:22:51,090
Oh, god.

461
00:22:53,351 --> 00:22:57,496
And you want me to... to make this go away.

462
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,845
I know it's a lot to ask.

463
00:23:00,347 --> 00:23:01,501
But yes.

464
00:23:02,564 --> 00:23:03,770
That's what I want.

465
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,415
Well, I'm sorry, Bree.

466
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,323
I can't.

467
00:23:32,179 --> 00:23:34,360
And thank you, lord,
for this wonderful food.

468
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:37,085
And bless our good friends, Bob and Lee.

469
00:23:37,085 --> 00:23:39,800
We are so grateful to have
them as our neighbors.

470
00:23:41,998 --> 00:23:44,911
And bless their daughter Jenny
who is away at her sleepover.

471
00:23:45,434 --> 00:23:47,150
We miss her so much.

472
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,366
And bless all the children of the world

473
00:23:49,938 --> 00:23:51,635
whether they have a mommy and daddy,

474
00:23:52,617 --> 00:23:53,823
two mommies,

475
00:23:53,823 --> 00:23:55,207
or two daddies.

476
00:23:56,432 --> 00:23:58,237
- Amen.
- Amen.

477
00:23:59,221 --> 00:24:00,325
That was really nice.

478
00:24:00,325 --> 00:24:02,214
We never pray before meals at our house.

479
00:24:02,214 --> 00:24:04,744
Well, some meals
you just need to pray before.

480
00:24:05,646 --> 00:24:07,332
That's a beautiful dress, Juanita.

481
00:24:08,135 --> 00:24:08,897
I guess.

482
00:24:08,897 --> 00:24:12,540
Oh, Juanita. Don't be modest.

483
00:24:14,046 --> 00:24:16,804
Isn't there a story behind
that dress you'd like to tell?

484
00:24:18,399 --> 00:24:19,793
Well, actually,

485
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:22,651
it's kind of like Anita's dress in
"West side story,"

486
00:24:22,651 --> 00:24:24,551
my all-time favorite musical.

487
00:24:26,046 --> 00:24:27,521
You like musicals?

488
00:24:29,298 --> 00:24:31,646
Hmm. Do I like musicals?

489
00:24:32,198 --> 00:24:35,029
Of course you do, silly. You love them!

490
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:39,358
All right, I'm gonna have to owe you.

491
00:24:39,392 --> 00:24:41,580
I'm out of singles. I can break a $5.

492
00:24:42,132 --> 00:24:44,801
Such a good girl.

493
00:24:45,253 --> 00:24:46,368
She sure is.

494
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:49,191
- Anyone need salt?
- No.

495
00:24:57,076 --> 00:24:58,932
- Oh, god.
- You broke me.

496
00:25:00,156 --> 00:25:01,751
And now you're inside.

497
00:25:02,222 --> 00:25:04,228
I can't paint.

498
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:07,120
I just stare at the empty canvas

499
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,290
and wonder how much
you're gonna hate what I do next.

500
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:11,534
Oh, I can help you with that.

501
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:13,491
You can?

502
00:25:13,491 --> 00:25:16,913
Yes. I'll hate it a lot. We good?

503
00:25:17,996 --> 00:25:20,335
What do I have to do to get
you to take me seriously?

504
00:25:22,307 --> 00:25:23,181
Hey.

505
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,435
O-of course.

506
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:29,651
It makes perfect...

507
00:25:30,787 --> 00:25:33,249
This is why you like Amy better in class.

508
00:25:33,249 --> 00:25:36,448
No, I like Amy better in class
because she's a better artist.

509
00:25:36,448 --> 00:25:38,175
This is why I like her in bed.

510
00:25:40,076 --> 00:25:41,130
See ya.

511
00:25:42,353 --> 00:25:44,060
So as you can see, Susan,
I'm a little busy,

512
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,115
so if we're done...

513
00:25:45,115 --> 00:25:45,881
We're not done.

514
00:25:46,982 --> 00:25:49,490
I am totally adrift in that class.

515
00:25:50,093 --> 00:25:51,106
Okay.

516
00:25:51,106 --> 00:25:53,013
Would it help if I told
you what your grade is?

517
00:25:54,167 --> 00:25:56,996
No. I-I-I-I mean, that's not what I was...

518
00:25:56,996 --> 00:25:59,014
- You're getting an "A."
- Really?

519
00:25:59,014 --> 00:26:00,780
Well, actually, an "A"-plus.

520
00:26:01,391 --> 00:26:03,190
Oh, wait. I'm sure that's
not enough for you.

521
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:06,542
You probably also need to know
everybody else will get a "D."

522
00:26:06,542 --> 00:26:08,166
Amy, you're getting a "D."

523
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:09,331
Okay!

524
00:26:09,875 --> 00:26:11,278
Congratulations, Susan.

525
00:26:12,906 --> 00:26:15,935
I do not want you to give me a fake grade.

526
00:26:15,935 --> 00:26:18,253
It doesn't mean anything if you're lying.

527
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:19,973
Well, why not?

528
00:26:20,478 --> 00:26:21,943
You're lying.

529
00:26:22,595 --> 00:26:24,079
No, I'm not.

530
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:26,450
Every time you sit down to paint

531
00:26:27,091 --> 00:26:29,719
and don't paint the fear
and pain that's in you,

532
00:26:29,719 --> 00:26:30,984
you're lying.

533
00:26:31,505 --> 00:26:32,451
Every time you care

534
00:26:32,451 --> 00:26:35,201
what somebody else thinks
about your art, you're lying.

535
00:26:36,936 --> 00:26:38,119
Uh, I have to go.

536
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:41,090
I used to think you were
holding something back,

537
00:26:42,596 --> 00:26:45,069
and now I wonder if there
just isn't anything there.

538
00:26:45,069 --> 00:26:46,724
So enjoy your "A"-plus,

539
00:26:47,717 --> 00:26:50,437
but don't come to my class
anymore. We're done.

540
00:26:56,719 --> 00:26:58,144
Gaby, it was a wonderful night.

541
00:26:58,696 --> 00:26:59,794
And you were so right about the girls.

542
00:26:59,794 --> 00:27:01,901
They are an absolute delight.

543
00:27:01,901 --> 00:27:03,681
When they sang the "Dreamgirls" number...

544
00:27:03,681 --> 00:27:05,338
goose bumps, seriously.

545
00:27:05,338 --> 00:27:07,336
Aw, I'm just glad you could come.

546
00:27:07,827 --> 00:27:09,382
You guys are so special to us.

547
00:27:10,335 --> 00:27:11,839
Gaby, did you leave the garage door open?

548
00:27:12,353 --> 00:27:14,248
Oh, I mean, you're practically family.

549
00:27:15,643 --> 00:27:16,868
That's why when we were thinking

550
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:20,335
who we'd want to be guardians
of our precious angels,

551
00:27:20,915 --> 00:27:23,246
you two were the only ones we considered.

552
00:27:23,707 --> 00:27:26,495
I mean, the girls
absolutely adore you, and...

553
00:27:29,237 --> 00:27:30,219
What?

554
00:27:35,647 --> 00:27:36,732
Oh, dear.

555
00:27:39,399 --> 00:27:41,765
This aside, it was a pretty
good evening, wasn't it?

556
00:27:57,555 --> 00:27:59,832
I don't get it. What were you thinking?

557
00:27:59,832 --> 00:28:02,402
Your father and I did
not raise you like this.

558
00:28:03,546 --> 00:28:04,669
Sorry.

559
00:28:04,669 --> 00:28:06,235
Can you just tell me why?
I want to understand.

560
00:28:06,235 --> 00:28:07,930
I thought you liked Bob and Lee.

561
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,157
I do. They're nice.

562
00:28:11,261 --> 00:28:12,875
Then I'm confused. Why'd you do it?

563
00:28:17,431 --> 00:28:18,636
Fine. Go to bed.

564
00:28:18,636 --> 00:28:20,160
We'll talk about your punishment tomorrow

565
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,856
and how you're gonna make this up to them.

566
00:28:23,783 --> 00:28:25,128
Is daddy dying?

567
00:28:26,592 --> 00:28:27,737
What?

568
00:28:28,217 --> 00:28:29,882
No! Why would you even say that?

569
00:28:31,267 --> 00:28:33,836
Because you guys have
been acting different,

570
00:28:34,298 --> 00:28:36,104
and daddy sleeps a lot,

571
00:28:36,657 --> 00:28:39,426
and... everyone seems sad.

572
00:28:40,311 --> 00:28:42,033
Even when we're happy, it's like...

573
00:28:42,927 --> 00:28:44,342
I don't know. Just sad.

574
00:28:49,847 --> 00:28:51,068
Daddy's fine,

575
00:28:51,497 --> 00:28:53,105
and mommy's fine, too.

576
00:28:54,727 --> 00:28:57,146
Then why do you want us to
go live with Bob and Lee?

577
00:28:59,263 --> 00:29:02,595
I heard you guys talking about it. Sorry.

578
00:29:04,091 --> 00:29:05,867
Honey, it's called being a guardian.

579
00:29:06,378 --> 00:29:09,027
Every family has that. It's just in case.

580
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:12,058
But trust me, nothing's gonna happen.

581
00:29:14,737 --> 00:29:18,140
So... we can rent that
cabin for spring vacation?

582
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,722
Sure.

583
00:29:21,017 --> 00:29:22,573
And everything's going to be okay?

584
00:29:23,134 --> 00:29:24,157
You promise?

585
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,795
Cross my heart.

586
00:29:43,396 --> 00:29:45,988
Okay, last week it was a teething biscuit

587
00:29:45,988 --> 00:29:47,722
caked to my ass, and now this?

588
00:29:48,807 --> 00:29:51,164
Why are we stopping?
What are you looking at?

589
00:29:51,755 --> 00:29:53,629
Penny's meeting Tom here
for some one-on-one time,

590
00:29:53,629 --> 00:29:54,794
And I wanted to make sure

591
00:29:54,794 --> 00:29:57,593
Saint Jane didn't make it a threesome.

592
00:29:58,751 --> 00:30:02,190
Threesome? Looks more
like a lonesome to me.

593
00:30:04,349 --> 00:30:05,630
She didn't come.

594
00:30:05,749 --> 00:30:09,455
Well, maybe she's busy.
You said Jane's a doctor, right?

595
00:30:10,036 --> 00:30:11,898
I was talking about Penny.

596
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,203
She didn't come.

597
00:30:17,272 --> 00:30:20,328
Well... at least you don't
have to worry about Jane

598
00:30:20,328 --> 00:30:21,949
busting up your family.

599
00:30:23,587 --> 00:30:24,691
You're right.

600
00:30:24,691 --> 00:30:27,750
I seem to be doing that
just fine on my own.

601
00:30:33,336 --> 00:30:34,402
Hello, Bree.

602
00:30:35,374 --> 00:30:38,289
Chuck. What are you doing here?

603
00:30:39,181 --> 00:30:42,410
Relax. Just police business.

604
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:44,946
Following up on a missing person report.

605
00:30:45,662 --> 00:30:46,989
Have you seen this man?

606
00:30:51,351 --> 00:30:52,614
Two months ago?

607
00:30:53,052 --> 00:30:54,799
The night of that dinner party.

608
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,877
We were walking to your house,
and we passed him.

609
00:30:58,785 --> 00:31:00,266
Right here. You remember?

610
00:31:02,335 --> 00:31:04,484
I've never seen that
man before in my life.

611
00:31:04,484 --> 00:31:08,364
Have you ever heard of
microexpressions, Bree?

612
00:31:09,923 --> 00:31:11,929
They flash across a person's face

613
00:31:11,929 --> 00:31:13,355
for a fraction of a second,

614
00:31:13,355 --> 00:31:14,958
revealing their true emotion,

615
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:17,092
instead of the one they're covering with.

616
00:31:17,505 --> 00:31:19,676
It's how cops know when people lie.

617
00:31:20,623 --> 00:31:21,824
Well, that's all very fascinating,

618
00:31:21,824 --> 00:31:23,249
but I don't have time for this.

619
00:31:23,249 --> 00:31:24,452
For example, um,

620
00:31:24,452 --> 00:31:29,078
when a person is distressed,
their eyebrows go up,

621
00:31:29,339 --> 00:31:32,318
causing lines to appear
across the forehead.

622
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:33,741
Don't touch me.

623
00:31:35,047 --> 00:31:36,594
Do you know, the funny thing is...

624
00:31:37,808 --> 00:31:40,861
I don't need a microexpression
to tell me when you're lying.

625
00:31:41,755 --> 00:31:43,969
'Cause I know that look
from personal experience.

626
00:31:43,969 --> 00:31:46,210
I saw it every time I was in your bed

627
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:48,296
and you said you loved me.

628
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:51,268
So since I know you're lying,

629
00:31:51,351 --> 00:31:53,436
why don't you start telling me the truth?

630
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,309
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

631
00:31:59,222 --> 00:32:00,465
I'm a cop.

632
00:32:00,775 --> 00:32:03,145
I know. Keep harassing this woman,

633
00:32:03,145 --> 00:32:05,007
and you're gonna wind up an ex-cop.

634
00:32:06,262 --> 00:32:09,595
Um, you might want to watch it
with the tough guy act, buddy.

635
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:13,666
Oh, unlike you, officer, it's not an act.

636
00:32:19,917 --> 00:32:21,216
I'll be seeing you.

637
00:32:25,731 --> 00:32:27,412
Big mistake.

638
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:36,661
Well, he's a delight.

639
00:32:36,965 --> 00:32:38,810
Oh, god. I'm shaking.

640
00:32:39,444 --> 00:32:41,119
Hey, hey, hey.

641
00:32:44,303 --> 00:32:47,065
Does this have something to do with, uh...

642
00:32:47,348 --> 00:32:49,216
what we talked about in the woods?

643
00:32:49,314 --> 00:32:50,262
Yes.

644
00:32:51,464 --> 00:32:53,714
Then you've got nothing
to be scared about.

645
00:32:57,064 --> 00:32:59,886
Well, it's pretty hard to
build a case without a body.

646
00:33:05,999 --> 00:33:09,016
Oh, my. Thank you.

647
00:33:10,139 --> 00:33:12,026
Why would you do that for me?

648
00:33:14,637 --> 00:33:17,200
Ah, you never know. Maybe someday...

649
00:33:17,652 --> 00:33:19,471
I might need something from you.

650
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:36,260
What are we... what?

651
00:33:37,188 --> 00:33:38,493
I thought we were going to the mall.

652
00:33:42,111 --> 00:33:43,915
- No.
- Sweetie, listen...

653
00:33:43,915 --> 00:33:45,259
Can we get outta here?

654
00:33:45,669 --> 00:33:46,533
Please?

655
00:33:46,533 --> 00:33:48,177
No, we can't.

656
00:33:48,177 --> 00:33:50,378
You need to spend some time with your dad.

657
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,534
I don't want to.

658
00:33:52,835 --> 00:33:57,361
I'm not giving you a choice.
Look at him. Look.

659
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,315
You know why he's sitting over there?

660
00:34:00,315 --> 00:34:03,350
Because he misses you so much.

661
00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:06,581
Then he shouldn't have left us for Jane.

662
00:34:07,771 --> 00:34:09,627
Well, that's not what happened.

663
00:34:11,939 --> 00:34:14,159
He didn't leave us. He left me.

664
00:34:15,496 --> 00:34:18,273
And he didn't do it for Jane.
He did it because...

665
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:24,295
we just don't make each other happy,

666
00:34:25,256 --> 00:34:28,138
and then he met Jane,
and I guess she does...

667
00:34:29,348 --> 00:34:32,022
make him happy, so...

668
00:34:34,728 --> 00:34:35,802
here we are.

669
00:34:37,481 --> 00:34:38,699
But you said that Jane...

670
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:39,916
I-I know.

671
00:34:40,092 --> 00:34:42,448
I said a lot of things I shouldn't have.

672
00:34:42,597 --> 00:34:43,679
I'm sorry.

673
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,660
He loves you, Penny.

674
00:34:52,405 --> 00:34:53,727
We both do.

675
00:34:54,995 --> 00:34:56,579
There's no bad guys here.

676
00:34:56,801 --> 00:34:59,679
There's just people trying
to figure things out,

677
00:35:00,447 --> 00:35:02,282
and there's one of those people.

678
00:35:03,946 --> 00:35:07,563
And I know he would love to
play catch with his daughter.

679
00:35:29,697 --> 00:35:31,277
You're way prettier than her.

680
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,253
You, uh, want something to drink?

681
00:36:23,253 --> 00:36:24,480
Uh, no.

682
00:36:25,857 --> 00:36:28,676
This isn't a social visit.
I need to ask you something,

683
00:36:28,676 --> 00:36:30,376
and I couldn't do it over the phone.

684
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,768
Oh?

685
00:36:32,451 --> 00:36:35,147
Remember when I said
I might need you to, uh,

686
00:36:35,147 --> 00:36:37,460
color outside the lines from time to time.

687
00:36:37,542 --> 00:36:38,489
Yeah.

688
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,591
We found a body out in Chapman woods.

689
00:36:42,699 --> 00:36:45,494
Now it's probably just some homeless guy.

690
00:36:45,877 --> 00:36:47,404
But if we report it...

691
00:36:47,404 --> 00:36:48,759
I'll take care of it.

692
00:36:50,129 --> 00:36:51,438
Just like that?

693
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,492
There's nothing else you need to know?

694
00:36:54,429 --> 00:36:55,734
It's better if I don't.

695
00:36:57,616 --> 00:36:58,372
I owe you one.

696
00:36:58,372 --> 00:36:59,223
Ah.

697
00:37:01,645 --> 00:37:02,185
Oh, hey, Ben.

698
00:37:02,185 --> 00:37:04,726
Hey, Susan. Uh, I'm just leaving.

699
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:06,504
See you at work.

700
00:37:09,981 --> 00:37:12,075
So you got the job? That's great.

701
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:13,626
Yeah.

702
00:37:14,358 --> 00:37:16,913
Just wait till you hear what the job is.

703
00:37:18,878 --> 00:37:21,871
So... Ben will dispose of the body,

704
00:37:21,871 --> 00:37:25,465
permanently, he assures me,
and we will be in the clear.

705
00:37:26,651 --> 00:37:28,146
Wow, just like that.

706
00:37:29,453 --> 00:37:32,125
- Bree? It's me!
- Come in!

707
00:37:32,235 --> 00:37:35,973
Did anybody else think
this would feel... better?

708
00:37:36,155 --> 00:37:39,346
I think it feels great.
Well done, Bree.

709
00:37:40,437 --> 00:37:42,329
Guess we got away with it.

710
00:37:42,448 --> 00:37:44,504
Oh, thank god you're here.

711
00:37:44,504 --> 00:37:46,107
Susan, what's wrong?

712
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:50,626
Okay, uh... you know
how Ben is putting up these new condos?

713
00:37:50,958 --> 00:37:52,557
He's doing it in Chapman woods.

714
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:56,781
And some of his guys found the body.

715
00:37:56,781 --> 00:37:59,293
He just asked Mike to get rid of it.

716
00:37:59,312 --> 00:38:00,690
- What?
- You're kidding.

717
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:02,122
Get out of town!

718
00:38:04,567 --> 00:38:05,794
What's going on?

719
00:38:09,462 --> 00:38:11,484
Sweetie, we kind of already knew.

720
00:38:11,506 --> 00:38:12,629
Who told you?

721
00:38:12,629 --> 00:38:16,475
No one. We k-kinda went out
there to move the body,

722
00:38:16,475 --> 00:38:17,624
but it was gone.

723
00:38:17,624 --> 00:38:20,713
And-and then I went to Ben,
and he had it,

724
00:38:20,713 --> 00:38:22,940
and he was planning on getting rid of it.

725
00:38:23,883 --> 00:38:25,102
So, wait.

726
00:38:26,616 --> 00:38:28,350
Y-you knew all of this,

727
00:38:28,494 --> 00:38:30,977
and it never occurred to you to tell me?

728
00:38:32,124 --> 00:38:33,123
Yeah.

729
00:38:33,958 --> 00:38:36,338
But bright side is we're
all in the clear now.

730
00:38:36,338 --> 00:38:37,456
- Yeah.
- Chardonnay?

731
00:38:37,525 --> 00:38:40,423
I don't believe it.
You drag me into this thing.

732
00:38:40,423 --> 00:38:42,421
I am out of my mind with guilt,

733
00:38:42,421 --> 00:38:44,795
then there's this massive complication

734
00:38:44,795 --> 00:38:47,214
which could endanger me and my family,

735
00:38:47,214 --> 00:38:48,809
and you don't even tell me?

736
00:38:49,865 --> 00:38:51,518
And here's why we didn't tell her.

737
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:54,069
What the hell does that mean?

738
00:38:54,366 --> 00:38:57,165
Oh, let's face it, Susan.
You're kind of a loose cannon.

739
00:38:57,595 --> 00:39:00,384
Yeah, I mean, 15 minutes
after we made a pact

740
00:39:00,384 --> 00:39:03,069
to keep this secret,
you were begging us to tell Mike.

741
00:39:03,069 --> 00:39:05,280
Oh, yeah? Well, guess what?
I didn't tell Mike.

742
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,034
Carlos did. So who's
your loose cannon now?

743
00:39:08,434 --> 00:39:10,979
What? Why would Carlos do that?

744
00:39:10,979 --> 00:39:12,983
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe because unlike you,

745
00:39:12,983 --> 00:39:13,915
he has a conscience.

746
00:39:13,915 --> 00:39:15,089
Oh, don't push it, Susan!

747
00:39:15,089 --> 00:39:16,591
Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy.

748
00:39:16,591 --> 00:39:18,790
The important thing is the body is gone.

749
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:20,212
We're gonna be okay.

750
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:23,319
Yeah, as long as we don't
get another letter.

751
00:39:26,086 --> 00:39:27,150
What letter?

752
00:39:27,662 --> 00:39:28,821
Yeah, what letter?

753
00:39:29,977 --> 00:39:32,074
Gaby, we never told them about the letter.

754
00:39:33,417 --> 00:39:34,452
Crap.

755
00:39:36,615 --> 00:39:37,519
Susan, wait.

756
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:39,930
No, no, you get a blackmail letter...

757
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:43,017
The same one Mary Alice got,
and you don't tell me?

758
00:39:43,107 --> 00:39:44,472
We didn't think you could handle it.

759
00:39:44,472 --> 00:39:47,319
You said it yourself.
You're out of your mind with guilt.

760
00:39:47,319 --> 00:39:49,939
Our pact was to keep this thing a secret,

761
00:39:49,939 --> 00:39:51,942
not to keep secrets from each other.

762
00:39:52,415 --> 00:39:53,466
We're done.

763
00:39:53,722 --> 00:39:56,323
Oh, don't you think you're
overreacting a little?

764
00:39:58,465 --> 00:39:59,872
I don't think she is.

765
00:40:01,318 --> 00:40:03,686
What's your excuse for not
telling me about the letter?

766
00:40:04,589 --> 00:40:06,578
Well, honey, you were going
through all that stuff with Tom.

767
00:40:06,578 --> 00:40:08,209
Yeah, we were trying to protect you.

768
00:40:08,209 --> 00:40:10,724
Protect me? What am I, a child?

769
00:40:10,724 --> 00:40:13,725
Someone knows what we did.
I have a right to know that.

770
00:40:13,725 --> 00:40:14,666
Of course you do.

771
00:40:14,666 --> 00:40:16,938
You know what my life
feels like right now?

772
00:40:16,938 --> 00:40:18,056
Everything I thought I knew,

773
00:40:18,056 --> 00:40:20,426
everything I could count on is going away.

774
00:40:20,426 --> 00:40:22,583
That's not true. You can count on us.

775
00:40:22,583 --> 00:40:24,532
No! Apparently I can't!

776
00:41:32,041 --> 00:41:37,655
<i>Yes, we're all seeking control
over something in our lives.</i>

777
00:41:42,652 --> 00:41:44,648
<i>We may want to cover up</i>

778
00:41:44,648 --> 00:41:47,488
<i>the remains of a troubling secret...</i>

779
00:41:52,164 --> 00:41:55,440
<i>or ease the pain of letting go...</i>

780
00:41:59,264 --> 00:42:02,558
<i>or erase the mistakes of our children.</i>

781
00:42:08,236 --> 00:42:13,325
<i>But sometimes the only way we
can truly change our lives...</i>

782
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:14,690
Finally.

783
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:17,377
<i>Is by letting go completely...</i>

784
00:42:18,338 --> 00:42:21,379
<i>no matter what the cost.</i>

785
