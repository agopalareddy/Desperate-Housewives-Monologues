1
00:00:00,649 --> 00:00:02,746
<i>Previously on...</i>

2
00:00:02,747 --> 00:00:06,559
<i>At Mike's funeral,
Susan and M.J. said good-bye.</i>

3
00:00:07,044 --> 00:00:09,145
<i>Gaby gave her blessing.</i>

4
00:00:09,145 --> 00:00:10,038
You should quit your job.

5
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:12,140
If being a counselor
is gonna make you happy,

6
00:00:12,141 --> 00:00:13,669
then that's what you should do.

7
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,687
<i>Lynette spoke her mind
about Tom's girlfriend...</i>

8
00:00:16,688 --> 00:00:19,236
I actually don't think
it's gonna last that much longer.

9
00:00:19,237 --> 00:00:21,693
<i>And the police gathered more evidence.</i>

10
00:00:21,694 --> 00:00:24,418
Someone is accusing you
of killing Mr. Sanchez.

11
00:00:24,419 --> 00:00:25,744
That's just silly.

12
00:00:25,746 --> 00:00:26,951
I wanna make sure we get enough

13
00:00:26,952 --> 00:00:28,881
to put this bitch away for good.

14
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:37,407
<i>Renee Perry had waited
many months for a proposal,</i>

15
00:00:37,407 --> 00:00:41,434
<i>and for many months,
she had been disappointed.</i>

16
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:45,705
<i>There had been cozy evening by the fire...</i>

17
00:00:46,606 --> 00:00:49,455
<i>that didn't go the way she had hoped.</i>

18
00:00:51,313 --> 00:00:54,579
<i>A romantic moment in Wisteria park...</i>

19
00:00:55,429 --> 00:00:58,931
<i>that wasn't so romantic after all.</i>

20
00:01:00,824 --> 00:01:03,567
<i>And a beautiful picnic by a lake...</i>

21
00:01:04,068 --> 00:01:05,976
<i>that turned out to be</i>

22
00:01:06,501 --> 00:01:09,325
<i>nothing more than a picnic.</i>

23
00:01:11,718 --> 00:01:14,735
<i>So when disappointment struck again...</i>

24
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:19,559
<i>Renee decided to speak up.</i>

25
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,178
Dessert?

26
00:01:20,179 --> 00:01:23,073
That's the big finale to a 6-course meal?

27
00:01:23,074 --> 00:01:23,790
Dessert?

28
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:25,891
Were you expecting, like, a cheese course?

29
00:01:25,892 --> 00:01:26,990
No!

30
00:01:27,076 --> 00:01:28,927
I was expecting a ring.

31
00:01:28,928 --> 00:01:31,323
You have red roses, champagne.

32
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:33,331
You are sending me every
signal in the world

33
00:01:33,332 --> 00:01:35,332
that I'm about to get a big proposal

34
00:01:35,353 --> 00:01:37,353
and instead, I get a cookie.

35
00:01:37,354 --> 00:01:38,878
Well, it's a chocolate souffle.

36
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:41,649
Whatever. I am not a young woman.

37
00:01:42,062 --> 00:01:44,823
I don't know how many more
fake outs my heart can take.

38
00:01:45,742 --> 00:01:48,491
Okay, fine. I-I was gonna propose tonight.

39
00:01:48,492 --> 00:01:50,663
I just did such a horrible
job the first time,

40
00:01:50,664 --> 00:01:53,736
I-I... I wanted this to be exceptional.

41
00:01:53,885 --> 00:01:55,781
They call it "Popping the question,"

44
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,713
Can I at least, uh,
read you the speech that I wrote?

45
00:02:01,714 --> 00:02:06,351
Oh, lord. Just give me the last paragraph.

46
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,789
Okay.

47
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,630
"For all these reasons and more,"

48
00:02:14,631 --> 00:02:18,214
"it is with great honor,
that I ask you if you"...

49
00:02:19,544 --> 00:02:21,653
Uh, we're ignoring that. Keep going.

50
00:02:21,654 --> 00:02:23,568
"i-if you would consider making me"

51
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:25,495
"the happiest man in the"...

52
00:02:25,496 --> 00:02:27,042
Go away!

53
00:02:27,043 --> 00:02:28,280
It's the police.

54
00:02:29,702 --> 00:02:31,768
We're looking for Mr. Ben Faulkner.

55
00:02:39,303 --> 00:02:41,312
I'm Ben Faulkner. How can I help you?

56
00:02:41,313 --> 00:02:42,746
You own the condominium project

57
00:02:42,747 --> 00:02:44,667
under construction at Chapman woods?

58
00:02:44,668 --> 00:02:46,485
I used to. Bank owns it now.

59
00:02:46,486 --> 00:02:48,404
You mind coming down
to the station with us?

60
00:02:48,405 --> 00:02:51,093
I want to ask you about
a body we found on the site.

61
00:02:52,163 --> 00:02:53,914
Is... he under arrest?

62
00:02:53,915 --> 00:02:57,359
No, ma'am. We just want to ask
you boyfriend a few questions.

63
00:02:58,754 --> 00:02:59,907
Wait!

64
00:03:10,011 --> 00:03:12,738
He's not my boyfriend. He's my fiance.

65
00:03:13,546 --> 00:03:18,526
<i>Yes, Renee Perry had waited
a long time for a proposal...</i>

66
00:03:18,533 --> 00:03:20,296
Okay. Now you can take him.

67
00:03:21,227 --> 00:03:25,810
<i>And she wasn't about to let
it slip through her fingers.</i>

68
00:03:39,783 --> 00:03:42,048
<i>Bree Van de Kamp started every morning</i>

69
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:44,921
<i>by catching up on the latest news,</i>

70
00:03:46,473 --> 00:03:51,170
<i>but sometimes the news came
from an unexpected source.</i>

71
00:03:51,171 --> 00:03:54,239
Hey, Bree. Look what happened to my hand.

72
00:03:55,329 --> 00:03:56,599
Oh, my goodness!

73
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,555
Are you...

74
00:03:57,556 --> 00:03:59,102
We're getting married.

75
00:03:59,103 --> 00:04:00,936
Oh, how wonderful!

76
00:04:00,937 --> 00:04:03,310
- Yeah, we're pretty happy.
- "Pretty happy"?

77
00:04:03,311 --> 00:04:05,048
Oh, we're ecstatic. Knickers to the wind.

78
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:05,750
Over the moon.

79
00:04:05,751 --> 00:04:07,774
Congratulations. When did this happen?

80
00:04:07,775 --> 00:04:09,825
Last night. Oh, and get this...

81
00:04:09,826 --> 00:04:12,188
In the middle of his big,
romantic proposal,

82
00:04:12,189 --> 00:04:14,681
the cops come by to ask
about some dead body

83
00:04:14,682 --> 00:04:16,876
they found at the construction site.

84
00:04:18,672 --> 00:04:20,115
So tell me more.

85
00:04:20,116 --> 00:04:23,469
Well, I definitely want a big wedding.
Bridesmaids, the works.

86
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,636
I was talking about the body.
What did the police say?

87
00:04:25,637 --> 00:04:27,078
Uh, not much. You know, I told them

88
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:29,847
that I didn't know anything about it,
and they believed me.

89
00:04:29,848 --> 00:04:30,946
Good.

90
00:04:31,881 --> 00:04:32,483
Although I have to say,

91
00:04:32,484 --> 00:04:34,306
I'm surprised you didn't tell me sooner.

92
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:36,466
- You know...
- Oh, we're sorry. Uh, it was late,

93
00:04:36,467 --> 00:04:38,219
And I wanted to tell my sister first.

94
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,057
Again, talking about the body.

95
00:04:40,058 --> 00:04:41,644
Why would we tell you that?

96
00:04:41,645 --> 00:04:43,920
And why are we talking
about this and not me?

97
00:04:43,921 --> 00:04:47,392
Quite right. I-I just would
hate to see this tragic news

98
00:04:47,393 --> 00:04:48,923
interfere with your happy day.

99
00:04:48,924 --> 00:04:50,363
And I don't think it will,

100
00:04:50,364 --> 00:04:52,661
but I really don't think
you should worry about it.

101
00:04:52,662 --> 00:04:55,606
Uh, the police don't seem like
they're gonna pose a problem.

102
00:04:58,507 --> 00:04:59,570
That was judge Kemp.

103
00:04:59,571 --> 00:05:01,337
He just signed off on that warrant.

104
00:05:01,338 --> 00:05:02,773
For Bree Van de Kamp?

105
00:05:03,847 --> 00:05:05,161
That was fast.

106
00:05:05,231 --> 00:05:07,088
I might've called in some favors.

107
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:09,276
The sooner I can prove she's guilty,

108
00:05:09,277 --> 00:05:11,633
the sooner I can watch her pay for it.

109
00:05:12,738 --> 00:05:15,960
We got another one. Um, Mitzi Kinsky.

110
00:05:16,407 --> 00:05:19,390
"Mike was a ray of sunshine on our street."

111
00:05:19,588 --> 00:05:21,041
"He will be missed dearly."

112
00:05:21,042 --> 00:05:24,083
Isn't that lovely?
Everybody's been so generous.

113
00:05:24,804 --> 00:05:27,349
Yeah. Ten jars of homemade jam.

114
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,681
I don't know if she was being generous

115
00:05:28,682 --> 00:05:30,380
or just cleaning out her basement.

116
00:05:31,088 --> 00:05:34,977
Well, either way,
it's a gesture of love and support.

117
00:05:35,746 --> 00:05:37,205
Makes me feel better.

118
00:05:38,313 --> 00:05:40,629
There is my baby boy.

119
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,977
Morning, bub.

120
00:05:42,971 --> 00:05:44,851
Eggs on a raft,

121
00:05:44,852 --> 00:05:46,409
just the way you like 'em.

122
00:05:47,832 --> 00:05:49,692
These smell gross.

123
00:05:50,215 --> 00:05:51,494
Okay, um, not a problem.

124
00:05:51,495 --> 00:05:53,477
Is there something else you'd like me to...

125
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:54,664
M.J.

126
00:05:55,635 --> 00:05:56,861
It's okay, honey.

127
00:05:56,862 --> 00:05:58,725
Um, what do you want?

128
00:05:58,726 --> 00:06:00,656
Strawberry ice cream.

129
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:02,152
Uh, buddy, I don't think

130
00:06:02,152 --> 00:06:03,651
that's the healthiest way
to start your day.

131
00:06:03,712 --> 00:06:05,447
I don't care what you think.

132
00:06:05,575 --> 00:06:06,674
Well...

133
00:06:07,447 --> 00:06:09,027
Maybe just this once.

134
00:06:09,504 --> 00:06:10,943
I'll get you a bowl.

135
00:06:16,071 --> 00:06:18,097
Or, uh, no bowl is good.

136
00:06:18,098 --> 00:06:19,745
I'm gonna eat this in front of the TV.

137
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:21,421
Can you bring me some sprinkles?

138
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:23,577
Of course, honey.

139
00:06:25,317 --> 00:06:26,680
Uh, mom.

140
00:06:26,681 --> 00:06:29,626
What? It's just ice cream, okay?

141
00:06:31,087 --> 00:06:32,624
He lost his dad.

142
00:06:34,117 --> 00:06:35,222
Okay.

143
00:06:35,223 --> 00:06:38,094
Mom, where's my sprinkles?

144
00:06:39,254 --> 00:06:40,462
Coming!

145
00:06:42,162 --> 00:06:44,079
What's... going on here?

146
00:06:44,497 --> 00:06:46,731
I thought I'd kick off
your big resignation day

147
00:06:46,732 --> 00:06:48,434
with a power breakfast.

148
00:06:49,262 --> 00:06:51,652
Plus the expiration on
this sausage was yesterday.

149
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:52,974
I gotta say,

150
00:06:53,606 --> 00:06:54,637
now that the day is finally here,

151
00:06:54,638 --> 00:06:56,036
I'm starting to get a little freaked out.

152
00:06:56,037 --> 00:06:57,778
Don't you worry.

153
00:06:57,779 --> 00:06:59,340
I've made a decision.

154
00:06:59,543 --> 00:07:00,858
I'm getting a job.

155
00:07:00,973 --> 00:07:03,611
What? You don't have to do that.

156
00:07:03,612 --> 00:07:05,852
No, I want to. It's time I help out.

157
00:07:05,853 --> 00:07:07,262
I owe it to you.

158
00:07:08,255 --> 00:07:10,328
So I wrote up a resume,

159
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:13,236
I booked a meeting
at an employment agency,

160
00:07:13,237 --> 00:07:17,544
and I even bought myself
a girlie briefcase.

161
00:07:17,545 --> 00:07:19,582
But I thought we were just gonna cut back,

162
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:20,976
live a smaller life?

163
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,269
Yeah, I thought about that.

164
00:07:23,865 --> 00:07:25,938
Then I decided I want
a slightly bigger life,

165
00:07:25,939 --> 00:07:27,323
So I figure if I work,

166
00:07:27,324 --> 00:07:30,539
the girls can stay in private school,
we can keep both cars,

167
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,438
and maybe even take

168
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:34,422
one of those ski trips
we talked about canceling.

169
00:07:34,423 --> 00:07:37,454
Gaby, I love that you're trying to help,

170
00:07:37,455 --> 00:07:40,419
but an entry-level salary is not
gonna cover the cost of skis,

171
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,058
let alone five nights at the Ritz.

172
00:07:42,059 --> 00:07:44,824
Well, maybe not now,
but if I work my way up the ladder,

173
00:07:44,825 --> 00:07:46,692
in a few years, I'll be
pulling in the big bucks,

174
00:07:46,693 --> 00:07:47,956
just like you do.

175
00:07:48,408 --> 00:07:49,526
Or did.

176
00:07:50,615 --> 00:07:52,509
What kind of ladder are
we talking about here?

177
00:07:53,236 --> 00:07:54,993
What is it that you're gonna do?

178
00:07:54,994 --> 00:07:57,387
I don't know yet. That's where
the employment lady comes in.

179
00:07:57,388 --> 00:07:58,721
She's gonna help me figure out

180
00:07:58,722 --> 00:08:01,957
How to best utilize my "Skill set."

181
00:08:02,476 --> 00:08:04,973
Yeah, I read that one
in your business magazines.

182
00:08:04,974 --> 00:08:07,417
I'm proud of you stepping up like this.

183
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:10,911
I hope you find a job
that has health care,

184
00:08:10,912 --> 00:08:12,586
'cause my benefits end today.

185
00:08:12,587 --> 00:08:13,596
What?

186
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,264
No risky meat without benefits.

187
00:08:19,615 --> 00:08:20,909
Yeah, Doug and I eloped,

188
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:23,622
so this time, I want an
over-the-top wedding...

189
00:08:23,623 --> 00:08:26,170
horse-drawn carriages, fireworks,

190
00:08:26,171 --> 00:08:28,218
poodles dyed purple.

191
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,020
Uh, is this weird,

192
00:08:32,021 --> 00:08:34,233
me going on about how happy I am

193
00:08:34,234 --> 00:08:36,361
while you're all sad and single?

194
00:08:36,362 --> 00:08:39,822
Actually, I'm hoping
I won't be single for long.

195
00:08:40,798 --> 00:08:42,765
I've decided to try to get Tom back.

196
00:08:42,766 --> 00:08:44,414
So we're done talking about me?

197
00:08:44,415 --> 00:08:46,060
Yeah. Kinda.

198
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:47,727
Great.

199
00:08:47,926 --> 00:08:49,380
So what are you thinking?

200
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:51,193
I figure I'll just come clean,

201
00:08:51,194 --> 00:08:54,549
tell him I screwed up,
and beg him to come back.

202
00:08:55,044 --> 00:08:57,445
It's amazing you landed
a man in the first place.

203
00:08:57,446 --> 00:08:58,774
Well, what do you think I should do?

204
00:08:58,775 --> 00:09:00,996
Oh. Throw yourself at him.

205
00:09:00,997 --> 00:09:04,813
Next time he stops by,
let a boob fall out of your blouse

206
00:09:04,814 --> 00:09:08,371
or maybe bend over in
those tight-ass jeans.

207
00:09:08,372 --> 00:09:09,429
That's not gonna work.

208
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:10,546
You're right. Sorry.

209
00:09:10,547 --> 00:09:12,401
What do I know about getting a man?

210
00:09:13,089 --> 00:09:14,411
Oh, wait.

211
00:09:14,515 --> 00:09:15,240
A lot.

212
00:09:15,241 --> 00:09:17,216
Come on. Help.

213
00:09:17,309 --> 00:09:18,945
It's not gonna be easy splitting them up.

214
00:09:18,946 --> 00:09:21,753
They just moved in together
and they seem so happy.

215
00:09:21,754 --> 00:09:24,046
Of course they're happy.
They're in that honeymoon phase.

216
00:09:24,047 --> 00:09:25,579
They're still taking trips,

217
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,160
laughing at each other's jokes,

218
00:09:27,161 --> 00:09:29,185
pretending they're interested in museums.

219
00:09:29,186 --> 00:09:31,269
We had a honeymoon phase, too.

220
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,171
Maybe I need to remind him of that.

221
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:34,573
Well, remind him naked.

222
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,029
The only tricky part is
gonna be getting him alone.

223
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:39,587
Jane watches him like a hawk,

224
00:09:39,931 --> 00:09:41,276
a tall, bitchy hawk.

225
00:09:41,277 --> 00:09:43,473
Well, whatever you do, do it soon.

226
00:09:43,756 --> 00:09:45,629
I'm not gonna waste
a plus one at my wedding

227
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:48,071
unless I know it's serious.

228
00:09:51,414 --> 00:09:53,530
Hey. Mom?

229
00:09:53,865 --> 00:09:55,094
Andrew!

230
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,157
It's wonderful to see you. How are you?

231
00:09:59,158 --> 00:10:01,291
I'm good. I'm good. I'm really good.

232
00:10:01,552 --> 00:10:04,405
Really? Because your sister
told me you lost your job.

233
00:10:04,406 --> 00:10:06,053
I've been so worried.

234
00:10:06,095 --> 00:10:07,689
Didn't you get any of the messages I left?

235
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,384
I've just been really busy.
Uh, but everything's fine.

236
00:10:10,385 --> 00:10:11,559
In fact, I met someone.

237
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,581
You did? That's wonderful.

238
00:10:14,582 --> 00:10:17,360
I know how hard
your breakup from Alex was.

239
00:10:17,361 --> 00:10:19,461
I'm so happy that you're moving on.

240
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,654
Yeah, well, you know,
it's only been a few months,

241
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:24,040
but, uh, it's pretty serious.

242
00:10:24,268 --> 00:10:25,023
How serious?

243
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:26,779
Serious enough that
we were driving through town,

244
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:29,292
and I thought the two of you should meet.

245
00:10:29,485 --> 00:10:30,603
He's here?

246
00:10:32,426 --> 00:10:34,017
Uh, yeah, well, I...

247
00:10:34,242 --> 00:10:35,822
I want you to keep an open mind.

248
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:43,379
Who's this?

249
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,722
This is Mary Beth,

250
00:10:44,896 --> 00:10:46,094
my fiancee.

251
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,040
I'm so glad to finally meet you.

252
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:57,407
I've been telling this guy

253
00:10:57,408 --> 00:11:00,894
I can't marry him until I meet his mom.

254
00:11:01,487 --> 00:11:03,656
So you're really engaged

255
00:11:03,657 --> 00:11:05,579
to... each other?

256
00:11:05,772 --> 00:11:06,605
Uh, yeah.

257
00:11:06,606 --> 00:11:09,904
Yeah, and remember,
you're happy I've moved on, right?

258
00:11:09,905 --> 00:11:11,512
I just have so many questions.

259
00:11:11,513 --> 00:11:14,206
I know what you must be thinking.
It's too soon.

260
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:16,306
No, that's not what I'm thinking.

261
00:11:16,307 --> 00:11:17,349
Mom.

262
00:11:18,895 --> 00:11:20,343
I'm sorry. It's just that
you're very different

263
00:11:20,344 --> 00:11:23,602
than all of the other...
dates Andrew's brought home.

264
00:11:23,603 --> 00:11:26,400
Well, you know, people change.

265
00:11:27,941 --> 00:11:29,307
So how did you two meet anyway?

266
00:11:29,308 --> 00:11:30,734
Oh, it's a real cute story.

267
00:11:30,735 --> 00:11:32,184
I was at the community center

268
00:11:32,185 --> 00:11:34,400
for my overeaters anonymous meeting,

269
00:11:34,401 --> 00:11:37,588
but I went into
the A.A. meeting by mistake.

270
00:11:37,724 --> 00:11:38,374
And by "Mistake,"

271
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:41,332
I mean I remembered how
drunks love their doughnuts.

272
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:44,202
So as I was reaching for
a buttermilk glazed,

273
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,194
there was Andrew.

274
00:11:45,195 --> 00:11:46,673
You were in overeaters anonymous?

275
00:11:46,674 --> 00:11:49,727
Yeah, I actually lost 220 pounds

276
00:11:49,728 --> 00:11:54,847
and then gained 160 pounds
of grade "A" beefcake!

277
00:11:55,546 --> 00:11:57,755
- Isn't she adorable?
- Uh-huh.

278
00:11:58,597 --> 00:12:00,137
Andrew, would you help me in the kitchen?

279
00:12:00,138 --> 00:12:01,778
I'd like to get some tea biscuits,

280
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:03,307
and they're on a very high shelf.

281
00:12:03,308 --> 00:12:05,193
Ooh, tea biscuits.

282
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,968
46 calories.

283
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,792
Andrew, I do not understand.

284
00:12:14,793 --> 00:12:16,121
What is going on here?

285
00:12:16,122 --> 00:12:18,513
Look, I-I know it's not
who you were expecting,

286
00:12:18,514 --> 00:12:21,724
but remember how you always said
that being gay was just a phase,

287
00:12:21,725 --> 00:12:23,258
that I-I just needed
to meet the right girl?

288
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:25,474
Well, you were right.

289
00:12:25,524 --> 00:12:27,327
Just be happy for me.

290
00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:39,089
Come on. Back to bed.

291
00:12:39,504 --> 00:12:41,551
M.J., it is 2:00 in the morning.

292
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:42,656
You should be in bed.

293
00:12:42,719 --> 00:12:44,350
You can't tell me what to do.

294
00:12:45,844 --> 00:12:47,274
What did you just say to me?

295
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,980
Hey. Turn that back on!

296
00:12:51,981 --> 00:12:53,178
Mnh-mnh.

297
00:12:53,963 --> 00:12:55,020
Guys?

298
00:12:55,602 --> 00:12:56,412
What's going on in here?

299
00:12:56,413 --> 00:12:58,692
I am trying to get M.J. back to bed.

300
00:12:58,693 --> 00:12:59,497
I can't sleep.

301
00:12:59,498 --> 00:13:01,324
Yeah, well, blowing up
aliens isn't gonna help.

302
00:13:01,325 --> 00:13:02,275
Come on.

303
00:13:02,276 --> 00:13:04,163
No, I wanna play my game.

304
00:13:04,164 --> 00:13:05,581
Turn it back on now!

305
00:13:05,582 --> 00:13:07,885
Shh. Shh. Don't get upset.

306
00:13:08,011 --> 00:13:09,637
You can finish your game.

307
00:13:11,766 --> 00:13:12,813
What?

308
00:13:14,568 --> 00:13:15,835
Just for a little while,

309
00:13:16,234 --> 00:13:18,064
then you have to go back to bed, okay?

310
00:13:19,211 --> 00:13:21,533
Mom, can I talk to you for a second?

311
00:13:27,326 --> 00:13:28,859
I think you're making a mistake.

312
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:31,016
It's not that big a deal.

313
00:13:31,017 --> 00:13:32,185
Yes, it is.

314
00:13:32,477 --> 00:13:36,511
Look, I know what
he's going through is awful,

315
00:13:36,835 --> 00:13:38,242
but this isn't helping.

316
00:13:38,969 --> 00:13:40,709
He's totally taking advantage of you.

317
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,449
He's not taking advantage.

318
00:13:43,982 --> 00:13:45,895
He's traumatized,

319
00:13:45,896 --> 00:13:48,552
and it's killing me to see
what he's going through,

320
00:13:48,553 --> 00:13:51,055
so if I can give him a little joy

321
00:13:51,056 --> 00:13:53,359
by letting him play video games,

322
00:13:53,813 --> 00:13:55,296
that's what I'm gonna do.

323
00:14:00,827 --> 00:14:03,290
So I'm looking to make
in the 6-figure range,

324
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:05,016
plus benefits, of course.

325
00:14:05,495 --> 00:14:09,019
And I have two young girls,
so flexible hours would be good.

326
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,377
And we always take this big vacation,

327
00:14:11,378 --> 00:14:13,785
so I'll need two weeks off. Maybe three.

328
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:15,661
You know what? Just give me all of august.

329
00:14:17,465 --> 00:14:19,532
So what do you got for me?

330
00:14:20,937 --> 00:14:22,230
A reality check.

331
00:14:23,072 --> 00:14:24,142
Excuse me?

332
00:14:24,143 --> 00:14:27,216
Mrs. Solis, you're gonna have
to adjust your expectations.

333
00:14:27,217 --> 00:14:28,295
Up?

334
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:31,551
No. Have you not been
reading the newspapers?

335
00:14:31,552 --> 00:14:33,254
The job market right now is brutal.

336
00:14:33,255 --> 00:14:35,752
I have people with PhDs
that I can't find jobs for,

337
00:14:35,753 --> 00:14:40,303
and frankly, your job
experience is very limited.

338
00:14:40,304 --> 00:14:42,487
Modeling, modeling, modeling.

339
00:14:42,488 --> 00:14:44,571
Okay. Okay. Okay.

340
00:14:44,703 --> 00:14:45,780
Print,

341
00:14:45,887 --> 00:14:46,980
runway,

342
00:14:47,104 --> 00:14:48,250
boat show.

343
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,608
Who's the job expert here?

344
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,567
Plus, there's a 15-year gap here.

345
00:14:52,568 --> 00:14:56,079
Yeah, to be a doting wife
and a loving mother of two.

346
00:14:56,132 --> 00:14:57,843
You have experience with children.

347
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:01,215
I have a job at a day care center.

348
00:15:01,686 --> 00:15:03,257
And deal with other people's kids?

349
00:15:03,391 --> 00:15:04,981
I don't even like my own.

350
00:15:05,445 --> 00:15:07,369
Look, you didn't go to college,

351
00:15:07,369 --> 00:15:08,928
you didn't even graduate high school,

352
00:15:08,929 --> 00:15:10,838
and your only references are

353
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,178
photographers and aging rock stars.

354
00:15:13,295 --> 00:15:16,455
In today's market,
you're basically unemployable.

355
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,109
And you actually get paid for this?

356
00:15:20,074 --> 00:15:21,643
So now what am I supposed to do?

357
00:15:21,864 --> 00:15:24,767
Well, you could start planning
that august vacation.

358
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:34,344
<i>Gabrielle Solis was depressed,</i>

359
00:15:34,622 --> 00:15:36,338
<i>and when she was depressed,</i>

360
00:15:36,449 --> 00:15:40,328
<i>nothing lifted her spirits
like a good workout...</i>

361
00:15:40,432 --> 00:15:42,579
<i>of her credit card.</i>

362
00:15:43,106 --> 00:15:43,752
May I help you?

363
00:15:43,805 --> 00:15:47,300
Yeah, uh, I just wanna get that
little red scarf I saw in the window.

364
00:15:47,356 --> 00:15:48,619
Then I'll be on my way.

365
00:15:48,724 --> 00:15:49,294
All right.

366
00:15:49,465 --> 00:15:52,353
Although that...

367
00:15:52,479 --> 00:15:54,608
black sheath dress would
go perfect with it.

368
00:15:54,695 --> 00:15:55,733
Mm.

369
00:15:56,995 --> 00:15:58,682
Look at those over-the-knee boots!

370
00:15:59,757 --> 00:16:01,194
Okay. Who am I kidding?

371
00:16:01,337 --> 00:16:03,402
Get me a double cappuccino
and a muscular stock boy.

372
00:16:03,513 --> 00:16:05,687
Mama needs a new pair of everything.

373
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,306
I said taupe. This is clearly beige.

374
00:16:15,406 --> 00:16:16,194
We don't have it in taupe.

375
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:19,232
Second floor, third mannequin
from the left. Look alive.

376
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,227
I'll try these in plum,

377
00:16:22,303 --> 00:16:24,097
these in leopard,

378
00:16:24,239 --> 00:16:26,174
these... oh, forget it.

379
00:16:26,242 --> 00:16:28,437
No lady wants to see
anything under 4 inches.

380
00:16:32,064 --> 00:16:33,929
You go with you. You go with you.

381
00:16:35,258 --> 00:16:36,278
You go away.

382
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:43,443
No one's been able to
make that romper work.

383
00:16:43,514 --> 00:16:44,382
Should we help her?

384
00:16:44,428 --> 00:16:47,791
Stay back. She knows what she's doing.

385
00:16:49,202 --> 00:16:52,408
Navy blazer, silver hoop earrings,
platform wedge.

386
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,789
And a red patent leather clutch.

387
00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:01,990
Genius! Genius.

388
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:12,452
Everything looks and smells so amazing,
Mrs. Van de Kamp.

389
00:17:12,563 --> 00:17:14,289
Do you mind if I take a picture?

390
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:15,202
Of the food?

391
00:17:15,272 --> 00:17:17,145
That way I eat just a little bit now,

392
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:18,563
and then later, when I'm hungry,

393
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:21,374
I can look at the picture
and get full on the memory.

394
00:17:22,118 --> 00:17:23,448
Don't you just wanna eat her up?

395
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:25,625
Not before I take a picture of her.

396
00:17:26,691 --> 00:17:27,529
You know, Mary Beth,

397
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:30,225
I just realized I don't
know a thing about you.

398
00:17:30,304 --> 00:17:31,353
What do you do?

399
00:17:31,469 --> 00:17:32,598
Well, actually, nothing.

400
00:17:32,845 --> 00:17:34,633
My parents have been pretty generous.

401
00:17:34,734 --> 00:17:36,451
Oh, really? What, uh,
sort of work are they in?

402
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:37,581
None of your business, mom.

403
00:17:37,676 --> 00:17:38,972
No, no. It's okay.

404
00:17:39,145 --> 00:17:42,267
They invented Mary Beth's frozen custard.

405
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:45,268
Mary Beth? You're that Mary Beth?

406
00:17:45,377 --> 00:17:47,946
Recognize me? The kid on the carton?

407
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:50,553
It's in every supermarket in the country.

408
00:17:50,651 --> 00:17:56,011
It must be a multibillion dollar...

409
00:17:56,113 --> 00:17:59,009
Oh.

410
00:18:00,649 --> 00:18:02,643
Would you help me in the kitchen, Andrew?

411
00:18:02,744 --> 00:18:04,173
Now.

412
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,185
Andrew, I knew you were
having financial troubles,

413
00:18:09,246 --> 00:18:11,099
but I never thought you'd stoop to this.

414
00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:13,011
- What?
- She's an heiress.

415
00:18:13,082 --> 00:18:15,131
You're obviously marrying her
for her money.

416
00:18:15,206 --> 00:18:17,625
I'm marrying her because
I'm crazy about her.

417
00:18:17,695 --> 00:18:19,678
We love the same movies.
She makes me laugh.

418
00:18:19,764 --> 00:18:22,405
She gets me. She's really an amazing girl.

419
00:18:22,536 --> 00:18:25,086
I think I found your good side!

420
00:18:25,282 --> 00:18:26,689
Smile, gnocchi.

421
00:18:26,745 --> 00:18:28,262
She's disturbed.

422
00:18:28,304 --> 00:18:30,887
Okay. All right. She's a little eccentric,

423
00:18:30,991 --> 00:18:33,355
but you know what? I love her.

424
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:36,318
Andrew Van de Kamp,
you love italian shoes.

425
00:18:36,441 --> 00:18:38,600
You love mid-century modern furniture.

426
00:18:38,752 --> 00:18:41,473
And according to
your internet history, you love...

427
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:44,465
army doctors giving elaborate
physicals to young recruits.

428
00:18:44,551 --> 00:18:47,279
But you do not love girls.

429
00:18:47,351 --> 00:18:48,811
Why can't you accept that I've changed?

430
00:18:48,842 --> 00:18:50,879
Because homosexuality is not a choice.

431
00:18:50,937 --> 00:18:52,339
You were born this way.

432
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,807
I'm the one who told you that.

433
00:18:53,917 --> 00:18:55,031
And it took me a long time,

434
00:18:55,307 --> 00:18:58,201
but I was finally able to
wrap my head around it.

435
00:18:58,352 --> 00:19:02,350
Honey, you're here, you're queer,
and I'm used to it.

436
00:19:02,445 --> 00:19:04,670
You know what, mom?
I'm not here anymore, all right?

437
00:19:05,605 --> 00:19:08,214
Mary Beth, let's go.

438
00:19:09,086 --> 00:19:09,804
Hey.

439
00:19:09,887 --> 00:19:11,269
How was your dad's?

440
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:12,298
Fine.

441
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,400
Aw!

442
00:19:13,436 --> 00:19:15,022
She was in a bit of a mood,

443
00:19:15,068 --> 00:19:18,005
but I still love you unconditionally.

444
00:19:18,076 --> 00:19:19,500
Let me guess... did it have something to do

445
00:19:19,589 --> 00:19:23,056
with a certain Taylor Swift
concert this Thursday night?

446
00:19:23,131 --> 00:19:24,321
I'm just saying,

447
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:25,875
all my friends' moms are taking them.

448
00:19:25,935 --> 00:19:28,798
And all your friends' moms are
gonna be deaf for two weeks,

449
00:19:28,881 --> 00:19:30,769
like I was the last time
I went to a concert.

450
00:19:30,849 --> 00:19:31,754
I'm not doing it.

451
00:19:31,859 --> 00:19:32,642
It's not fair.

452
00:19:32,723 --> 00:19:35,402
I am gonna go give Paige a bath.

453
00:19:35,614 --> 00:19:37,164
Thank you for bringing her home.

454
00:19:37,883 --> 00:19:40,146
I'm gonna go grab your suitcase.

455
00:19:41,218 --> 00:19:43,578
Mom! Please!

456
00:19:43,624 --> 00:19:46,901
It'd make you the bestest
mom in the whole wide world!

457
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:48,990
Nope. The matter is closed.

458
00:19:49,056 --> 00:19:50,156
This sucks.

459
00:19:52,265 --> 00:19:53,131
Hey.

460
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:56,439
You know who else likes Taylor Swift?

461
00:19:56,556 --> 00:19:57,554
Me.

462
00:19:58,081 --> 00:20:00,548
I mean, if your parents are okay
with it, I'll take you.

463
00:20:00,905 --> 00:20:02,345
Oh, my god!

464
00:20:02,456 --> 00:20:03,775
Oh!

465
00:20:03,834 --> 00:20:07,172
You're the best! I'll check
with my mom and call you?

466
00:20:07,328 --> 00:20:07,864
Can't wait.

467
00:20:07,944 --> 00:20:09,426
Okay!

468
00:20:13,397 --> 00:20:15,211
So?

469
00:20:15,543 --> 00:20:17,442
Totally worked.

470
00:20:17,664 --> 00:20:19,589
You'll have dad all to yourself
Thursday night.

471
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:23,243
You are the bestest girl
in the whole wide world.

472
00:20:37,004 --> 00:20:38,516
Gaby!

473
00:20:48,358 --> 00:20:49,700
Hi, babe.

474
00:20:50,075 --> 00:20:51,419
What is that?

475
00:20:51,496 --> 00:20:52,913
This?

476
00:20:53,069 --> 00:20:54,685
It's a boot.

477
00:20:54,771 --> 00:20:55,444
I bought a boot.

478
00:20:55,532 --> 00:20:58,082
You bought... one boot?

479
00:20:58,147 --> 00:21:00,025
Yep. 'Cause I'm frugal.

480
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,271
One day I'll buy the other one.

481
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,877
That's all you bought?

482
00:21:03,963 --> 00:21:05,521
Because I got a call from the bank.

483
00:21:05,609 --> 00:21:09,897
Seems somebody was going crazy
with your credit card.

484
00:21:09,992 --> 00:21:12,264
Huh. Maybe it was stolen.

485
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:13,469
Yeah.

486
00:21:13,567 --> 00:21:17,848
By a size 0 with
incredibly expensive taste.

487
00:21:17,992 --> 00:21:19,480
What is this shopping bag
doing under the bed?

488
00:21:19,573 --> 00:21:22,077
I bought a gift for a woman

489
00:21:22,479 --> 00:21:25,516
whose husband is in Iraq,
fighting for our freedom.

490
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:28,790
Gaby! You're taking it all back.

491
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:30,722
I can't.

492
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:33,300
Not if I've worn it.

493
00:21:34,505 --> 00:21:36,813
Can't take it back.
Can't take it back now.

494
00:21:36,847 --> 00:21:37,782
See? It's all...

495
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,556
Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop!

496
00:21:40,102 --> 00:21:42,954
Our lives have changed.
We can't afford this anymore.

497
00:21:43,034 --> 00:21:47,623
Not unless you got some big
job you haven't told me about.

498
00:21:50,873 --> 00:21:52,269
What's wrong?

499
00:21:53,153 --> 00:21:54,627
I met with that job lady.

500
00:21:54,702 --> 00:21:57,576
But she basically said
I'm not qualified to do anything.

501
00:21:57,641 --> 00:22:00,145
I didn't finish school.
I've never had a real job.

502
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:03,024
The only thing I've ever gotten
paid for is being pretty.

503
00:22:03,118 --> 00:22:03,950
I just feel like my life

504
00:22:03,981 --> 00:22:06,153
has been one bad decision after another.

505
00:22:07,021 --> 00:22:10,982
Uh... what about the girls?

506
00:22:11,425 --> 00:22:13,325
What about marrying me?

507
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:15,992
That's the part that hurts the most.

508
00:22:16,097 --> 00:22:17,478
You guys are the only good thing
I've ever done,

509
00:22:17,563 --> 00:22:19,492
and I feel like I'm letting you down.

510
00:22:21,027 --> 00:22:23,670
Gaby...

511
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:25,840
you are smart.

512
00:22:26,724 --> 00:22:28,355
You'll figure something out,

513
00:22:28,495 --> 00:22:30,148
something great.

514
00:22:30,233 --> 00:22:31,590
But in the meantime,

515
00:22:34,157 --> 00:22:35,730
all these clothes

516
00:22:35,815 --> 00:22:37,657
have to go back.

517
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:39,492
I know.

518
00:22:39,699 --> 00:22:42,544
Could you just give us a moment alone?

519
00:22:48,015 --> 00:22:49,715
Hello?

520
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:52,775
Yes, this is his mother.

521
00:22:53,356 --> 00:22:54,936
He did what?

522
00:22:55,043 --> 00:22:56,869
He threw a stapler at you?

523
00:22:56,946 --> 00:22:58,955
Yes, right at my head.

524
00:22:59,429 --> 00:23:01,095
Are you sure it wasn't an accident?

525
00:23:01,186 --> 00:23:03,833
He couldn't have been aiming at your head.

526
00:23:03,929 --> 00:23:04,993
What he said was...

527
00:23:05,064 --> 00:23:07,928
and I wrote this down
because I wanted to be exact...

528
00:23:08,004 --> 00:23:08,820
"Leave me alone,"

529
00:23:08,868 --> 00:23:12,322
"or I'm going to throw
this stapler at your head."

530
00:23:12,428 --> 00:23:14,016
I-I'm so sorry.

531
00:23:14,089 --> 00:23:16,567
You do know that M.J.
just lost his father, right?

532
00:23:16,637 --> 00:23:19,359
I do. My heart goes out to both of you.

533
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:21,992
But there is no place for
violence in my classroom,

534
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,938
no matter what
the circumstances are at home.

535
00:23:25,058 --> 00:23:26,418
"Circumstances"?

536
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:28,078
Um...

537
00:23:28,153 --> 00:23:32,112
I mean, it's not like
he just lost his favorite toy

538
00:23:32,151 --> 00:23:33,982
or a pet turtle.

539
00:23:34,067 --> 00:23:36,098
He... lost his dad.

540
00:23:36,177 --> 00:23:39,010
Yes, but if M.J. had thrown
that stapler a little harder,

541
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,044
my grandkids might have lost
their grandmother.

542
00:23:42,857 --> 00:23:44,895
Well, I'm sure that he is sorry.

543
00:23:44,976 --> 00:23:47,773
He isn't. In fact, he said... and I quote...

544
00:23:48,116 --> 00:23:49,485
"Bull's-eye."

545
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:52,285
I'm considering having him
removed from my class.

546
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:54,103
Okay. Uh...

547
00:23:55,146 --> 00:23:57,647
What M.J. did was wrong,

548
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:01,228
but... I'm finding it hard to believe

549
00:24:01,284 --> 00:24:04,301
that a person that spends
so much time with children

550
00:24:04,402 --> 00:24:07,667
could be so oblivious to a child's pain.

551
00:24:07,763 --> 00:24:10,620
I have 20 other children
I need to protect.

552
00:24:10,736 --> 00:24:13,553
And M.J. is a very angry little boy.

553
00:24:13,639 --> 00:24:16,061
Well, of course he's angry.

554
00:24:16,162 --> 00:24:17,324
He's 9,

555
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:21,236
and one of the most important
and loving people

556
00:24:21,371 --> 00:24:24,310
in his life has just been
ripped away from him,

557
00:24:24,415 --> 00:24:27,119
and now he has to live with the fact

558
00:24:27,197 --> 00:24:29,865
that his father is never coming back.

559
00:24:29,947 --> 00:24:31,176
Inside voices, please.

560
00:24:31,222 --> 00:24:33,138
Oh, to hell with your "Inside voices."

561
00:24:33,229 --> 00:24:35,161
His father is dead.

562
00:24:35,231 --> 00:24:37,753
My husband is dead!

563
00:24:38,928 --> 00:24:42,560
Oh! My foot.

564
00:24:49,165 --> 00:24:51,306
It's her.

565
00:24:56,498 --> 00:24:58,481
Why is everyone looking at me?
Did I do something wrong?

566
00:24:58,553 --> 00:25:00,586
No. No, in fact, we have done nothing

567
00:25:00,647 --> 00:25:03,806
but talk about your shopping skills
for the last 24 hours.

568
00:25:05,002 --> 00:25:05,502
Really?

569
00:25:05,502 --> 00:25:06,677
Yes. We even went back

570
00:25:06,747 --> 00:25:08,796
and watched the security tape
to see it again.

571
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:11,167
Well, keep the tape. It was my last show.

572
00:25:11,249 --> 00:25:13,798
- What?
- Uh, circumstances have changed.

573
00:25:13,913 --> 00:25:16,992
My shopping days are over.
So just do me a favor.

574
00:25:17,053 --> 00:25:18,712
Wait till I'm gone to restock the boots.

575
00:25:18,727 --> 00:25:20,736
I can't cry again today.

576
00:25:20,781 --> 00:25:23,061
Uh, wait. Wait.

577
00:25:23,182 --> 00:25:25,214
Take care of these for Mrs. Solis

578
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:27,784
and bring her a glass of champagne.

579
00:25:28,006 --> 00:25:29,264
- Champagne?
- Mm-hmm.

580
00:25:29,292 --> 00:25:30,678
Did you not hear me? I'm broke.

581
00:25:30,907 --> 00:25:32,360
You have no reason to
suck up to me anymore.

582
00:25:32,433 --> 00:25:36,146
Well, I do if I want you to work here.

583
00:25:36,687 --> 00:25:37,188
Huh?

584
00:25:37,188 --> 00:25:40,655
You see, you're like a...
a shopping savant,

585
00:25:40,726 --> 00:25:43,754
and every day, women come in here
with all the money in the world

586
00:25:43,805 --> 00:25:46,033
and no clue what to spend it on.

587
00:25:46,092 --> 00:25:47,029
You could help them.

588
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,675
You mean like a personal shopper job?

589
00:25:48,862 --> 00:25:50,966
No, do not think of it as a job.

590
00:25:51,092 --> 00:25:52,824
For you, my dear, it is a calling.

591
00:25:54,237 --> 00:25:55,055
I don't know.

592
00:25:55,106 --> 00:25:56,899
Employees get a 40% discount.

593
00:25:57,333 --> 00:25:58,765
Hi. Welcome to Cumberly's.

594
00:25:58,822 --> 00:26:01,238
My name's Gabrielle. Can I help you?

595
00:26:13,091 --> 00:26:16,256
I want to thank you
for accepting my apology

596
00:26:16,295 --> 00:26:18,164
and coming over before you left town.

597
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:20,996
I feel like I haven't had
the appropriate reaction

598
00:26:21,084 --> 00:26:22,191
to this wedding.

599
00:26:22,291 --> 00:26:24,753
No. No, no, you've been wonderful.

600
00:26:24,847 --> 00:26:26,068
Well,

601
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:30,494
to show you how excited I am that
my little boy is getting married,

602
00:26:30,837 --> 00:26:33,904
I've thrown you
a surprise engagement party.

603
00:26:44,294 --> 00:26:45,799
Mom, what the hell is this?

604
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:48,024
Oh, I just invited some
of your old friends over

605
00:26:48,095 --> 00:26:49,858
to congratulate you.

606
00:26:49,971 --> 00:26:51,945
Hey, girl. I haven't seen you in ages.

607
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:54,652
Those shoes are ferosh.

608
00:26:56,868 --> 00:26:58,311
Who's this hag?

609
00:26:58,386 --> 00:27:01,651
This is Andrew's fiancee Mary Beth.

610
00:27:02,416 --> 00:27:04,835
Hi, Mary Beth. I'm Brian with an "I."

611
00:27:04,895 --> 00:27:07,362
This is Bryan with a "Y."

612
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:10,051
What is this about you getting
married? We need to dish.

613
00:27:10,578 --> 00:27:11,944
Um, uh, sweetie, why don't...

614
00:27:12,035 --> 00:27:13,995
why don't you go in
the kitchen and grab a drink?

615
00:27:17,709 --> 00:27:19,394
I just love those boys.

616
00:27:19,479 --> 00:27:21,630
They used to be here all the time.

617
00:27:22,478 --> 00:27:25,061
So what did you think of Andrew's friends?

618
00:27:25,161 --> 00:27:28,390
They seem sweet and very well-groomed.

619
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:31,261
Well, yeah, but don't they seem,

620
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:34,254
I don't know, a little... disco-y?

621
00:27:34,447 --> 00:27:37,668
Mrs. Van de Kamp, I know Andrew's gay.

622
00:27:37,758 --> 00:27:38,903
You do?

623
00:27:38,963 --> 00:27:40,736
We've never actually made love,

624
00:27:40,776 --> 00:27:44,214
and he has a picture of
Michael Phelps next to his bed.

625
00:27:44,282 --> 00:27:46,923
Says it's patriotic, but...

626
00:27:47,439 --> 00:27:49,784
I don't understand.
If you know about him...

627
00:27:49,845 --> 00:27:51,360
You have to understand,

628
00:27:51,426 --> 00:27:52,981
I grew up fat and lonely.

629
00:27:54,353 --> 00:27:55,215
When I lost all the weight,

630
00:27:55,288 --> 00:27:59,315
I thought men would look at me
differently, but they didn't.

631
00:28:00,028 --> 00:28:02,173
I just kind of gave up.

632
00:28:02,289 --> 00:28:03,381
Oh, Mary Beth.

633
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:06,786
But then I met Andrew. He's sweet, fun,

634
00:28:06,835 --> 00:28:09,230
and I just thought...

635
00:28:09,502 --> 00:28:11,153
I could do a lot worse.

636
00:28:11,233 --> 00:28:14,352
No. No. No. Now you listen to me.

637
00:28:14,689 --> 00:28:18,708
You deserve real romance
and passion in your life.

638
00:28:18,838 --> 00:28:19,827
I know all about this.

639
00:28:19,913 --> 00:28:22,614
I have been with plenty
of men for companionship

640
00:28:22,632 --> 00:28:24,830
when it should've been for love.

641
00:28:24,916 --> 00:28:27,137
The right man for you
is out there somewhere.

642
00:28:27,232 --> 00:28:29,120
You just can't settle.

643
00:28:29,235 --> 00:28:32,233
It's not fair to you or to Andrew.

644
00:28:47,724 --> 00:28:49,873
I think we need to talk.

645
00:28:51,868 --> 00:28:53,319
All right.

646
00:28:57,136 --> 00:29:01,073
Coming! Coming! Coming!

647
00:29:01,117 --> 00:29:02,152
Okay.

648
00:29:02,378 --> 00:29:03,787
Oh, no.

649
00:29:08,587 --> 00:29:09,204
Hey.

650
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:12,252
Hey. I-I came as soon
as I got your message.

651
00:29:12,322 --> 00:29:13,719
So power's out, huh?

652
00:29:13,779 --> 00:29:14,814
I know. This is so embarrassing.

653
00:29:14,866 --> 00:29:16,952
I just got off the phone
with the electric company,

654
00:29:17,009 --> 00:29:19,069
and it turns out it's a faulty line,

655
00:29:19,129 --> 00:29:21,434
so they're gonna fix it first
thing tomorrow morning.

656
00:29:21,513 --> 00:29:23,248
So you don't need me to
look at anything or...

657
00:29:23,312 --> 00:29:24,882
I'm sorry. I feel terrible dragging you

658
00:29:24,968 --> 00:29:25,582
all the way over here,

659
00:29:25,654 --> 00:29:28,738
so you want something for
your trouble? A drink or...

660
00:29:28,795 --> 00:29:30,929
Nah. No. No. I don't...
I don't want to be in your hair.

661
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,481
No, no. You're not.

662
00:29:32,612 --> 00:29:34,323
Honestly, it's a little scary

663
00:29:34,404 --> 00:29:37,386
being all alone in a dark house.

664
00:29:37,628 --> 00:29:39,808
Hence the hundreds of candles.

665
00:29:40,564 --> 00:29:43,486
Yeah, I did go a little overboard, huh?

666
00:29:44,104 --> 00:29:45,055
What are you cooking?

667
00:29:45,118 --> 00:29:46,938
It smells amazing in here.

668
00:29:47,033 --> 00:29:49,851
Yeah? I'm trying out
a new recipe for the kids.

669
00:29:49,977 --> 00:29:51,804
Beef bourguignon.

670
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:52,884
But Penny's with Jane

671
00:29:52,986 --> 00:29:55,373
and Parker's having pizza
with the Martindales.

672
00:29:55,471 --> 00:29:57,654
I love beef bourguignon.

673
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:00,828
Oh, that's right. I totally forgot.

674
00:30:00,916 --> 00:30:03,109
Y-you remember the first time we tried it?

675
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:05,562
New York. Our second anniversary.

676
00:30:05,563 --> 00:30:08,230
Oh, that must be where I got the idea.

677
00:30:08,231 --> 00:30:10,691
I was just looking at
pictures from that trip.

678
00:30:10,692 --> 00:30:13,047
Oh, yeah? You-you got
out the old photo album?

679
00:30:13,048 --> 00:30:13,995
Yeah.

680
00:30:13,996 --> 00:30:16,360
Oh, ho ho. Man!

681
00:30:16,924 --> 00:30:19,048
Look at us.

682
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:20,952
Hey.

683
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,880
Why don't you stay for dinner?
I'll make you a plate.

684
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,894
Yeah, I don't know.

685
00:30:25,895 --> 00:30:28,470
Come on. Jane's at the concert.

686
00:30:28,471 --> 00:30:29,594
What would you rather do...

687
00:30:29,595 --> 00:30:33,305
eat a microwave dinner all
alone in your apartment or...

688
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,817
beef bourguignon?

689
00:30:35,981 --> 00:30:36,985
Well...

690
00:30:37,758 --> 00:30:39,945
I hate for it to go to waste.

691
00:30:48,829 --> 00:30:50,636
Well, I hope you're happy.

692
00:30:50,637 --> 00:30:52,914
Mary Beth is on her way back to Wisconsin.

693
00:30:52,915 --> 00:30:54,049
I'm sorry.

694
00:30:54,195 --> 00:30:56,435
Why are you so concerned about her life?

695
00:30:56,436 --> 00:30:58,110
What about me?! I'm your son.

696
00:30:58,111 --> 00:31:00,922
I did this for you.
Can you look me in the eye

697
00:31:00,923 --> 00:31:02,146
and tell me you would've been happy

698
00:31:02,147 --> 00:31:04,591
spending the rest of
your life with that woman?

699
00:31:04,772 --> 00:31:07,983
That marriage really
could have helped me out,

700
00:31:07,987 --> 00:31:10,211
and you have no idea how much help I need.

701
00:31:10,212 --> 00:31:12,128
Why? What is going on?

702
00:31:12,628 --> 00:31:14,350
Where do I start? Um...

703
00:31:15,555 --> 00:31:18,079
Well, I took a loss on
the house that you got me,

704
00:31:19,154 --> 00:31:21,646
I, uh, I lost my job,

705
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:23,135
can't find a new one.

706
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,972
I have a ton of credit card debt,

707
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:29,630
and Mary Beth was willing to
help me out with all of that.

708
00:31:29,631 --> 00:31:32,878
Well, so would I. Why didn't
you come to me for help?

709
00:31:32,879 --> 00:31:35,114
Do you know what it feels like
to have to keep running back

710
00:31:35,115 --> 00:31:37,207
to your mother to fix your problems?

711
00:31:37,819 --> 00:31:40,647
My whole life,
you've been propping me up...

712
00:31:40,652 --> 00:31:44,695
when I needed a job, when I was dumped,
when I was drinking.

713
00:31:44,876 --> 00:31:46,262
I'm just... I'm so tired

714
00:31:46,263 --> 00:31:49,311
of you seeing me as a failure.

715
00:31:49,312 --> 00:31:51,462
Andrew, if you would
go through all of this

716
00:31:51,463 --> 00:31:53,270
rather than come to me for help,

717
00:31:53,271 --> 00:31:55,683
then I am the one who's failed.

718
00:31:59,895 --> 00:32:02,515
How about we just agree
that we both failed?

719
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:07,556
So what are you gonna do now?

720
00:32:07,703 --> 00:32:10,074
I don't know. I had a
pretty good setup there...

721
00:32:10,075 --> 00:32:12,487
a place to live, somebody who needed me,

722
00:32:13,427 --> 00:32:15,338
all the frozen custard I could eat.

723
00:32:15,339 --> 00:32:17,162
Well, I don't have any custard,

724
00:32:17,163 --> 00:32:19,610
but I can offer you a place to stay,

725
00:32:19,611 --> 00:32:23,639
and... someone else who needs you.

726
00:32:26,219 --> 00:32:27,335
All right.

727
00:32:28,315 --> 00:32:30,886
But just until I get
back on my feet again.

728
00:32:36,219 --> 00:32:38,072
Now let's talk about that party.

729
00:32:38,463 --> 00:32:42,753
I could swear I saw Bryan with
a "Y" checking you out.

730
00:32:42,754 --> 00:32:44,718
Ah, well, actually,

731
00:32:44,719 --> 00:32:47,475
I am more into Geoffrey with a "G."

732
00:32:47,476 --> 00:32:49,311
Now that's my gay son.

733
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:55,086
God, look at all the stuff we're doing.

734
00:32:55,087 --> 00:32:56,490
We used to be interesting.

735
00:32:56,491 --> 00:32:59,590
I know. We-we hiked.
We went to the theater.

736
00:32:59,591 --> 00:33:02,774
We-we took salsa lessons.

737
00:33:02,775 --> 00:33:05,044
And then came the kids.

738
00:33:05,128 --> 00:33:07,779
Ah, fun killers. Huh.

739
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,642
Mmm. This is amazing.

740
00:33:12,643 --> 00:33:14,979
It's even better than that
restaurant in New York.

741
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:17,039
I don't know. That place was pretty good.

742
00:33:17,697 --> 00:33:18,922
How did we even find it?

743
00:33:18,923 --> 00:33:20,535
- You don't remember?
- Mnh-mnh.

744
00:33:21,019 --> 00:33:23,698
We got caught in that torrential downpour.

745
00:33:23,699 --> 00:33:25,962
We ducked in there to dry off.

746
00:33:25,963 --> 00:33:29,602
Right. And then the owner insisted
on making us a special meal

747
00:33:29,603 --> 00:33:31,760
because we had that newlywed look.

748
00:33:36,479 --> 00:33:38,676
A lot of water under that bridge, huh?

749
00:33:39,985 --> 00:33:42,333
Yeah, but it was a pretty strong bridge.

750
00:33:46,322 --> 00:33:47,804
Look how young we were.

751
00:33:49,105 --> 00:33:50,252
Yeah.

752
00:33:52,177 --> 00:33:55,933
Back then I could actually see
without my reading glasses.

753
00:33:56,113 --> 00:33:58,371
Here you go. Best I can do for light.

754
00:33:58,372 --> 00:33:59,759
Thank you.

755
00:34:05,283 --> 00:34:06,479
Ha ha ha.

756
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:09,060
I'm glad you kept these.

757
00:34:10,263 --> 00:34:11,843
Good memories, huh?

758
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,308
Yeah.

759
00:34:14,311 --> 00:34:16,131
You know, sometimes you just get...

760
00:34:17,976 --> 00:34:20,787
overwhelmed by work and...

761
00:34:21,864 --> 00:34:23,851
kids and life, and it's just...

762
00:34:24,905 --> 00:34:26,883
so easy to...

763
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,180
forget.

764
00:34:30,551 --> 00:34:31,523
Yeah.

765
00:34:33,048 --> 00:34:35,635
Yeah, it is.

766
00:34:37,862 --> 00:34:39,114
I'm on fire.

767
00:34:39,115 --> 00:34:40,582
Oh, my god. Oh, my god! I'on fire!

768
00:34:40,583 --> 00:34:42,835
Oh! Oh, my god! Oh!

769
00:34:48,232 --> 00:34:48,786
Are you okay?

770
00:34:48,787 --> 00:34:50,582
I think I burnt the skin.

771
00:34:50,583 --> 00:34:52,770
Oh, jeez. Let me see.

772
00:34:56,999 --> 00:34:58,899
Oh, it doesn't look so bad.

773
00:34:59,511 --> 00:35:01,363
I thought the power was out.

774
00:35:02,711 --> 00:35:05,363
They must have... fixed it.

775
00:35:05,959 --> 00:35:07,139
You set this up.

776
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,936
You know, in-in my defense, I...

777
00:35:08,937 --> 00:35:10,018
What the hell is going on?

778
00:35:10,019 --> 00:35:12,374
I just wanted to see where we stood,

779
00:35:12,375 --> 00:35:14,374
if there was still anything between us,

780
00:35:14,375 --> 00:35:18,539
if we could find our way back
to those people in the pictures.

781
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:20,060
By tricking me?

782
00:35:20,191 --> 00:35:22,151
I'm-I'm sorry about how I did it,

783
00:35:22,152 --> 00:35:24,611
but you can't deny what just happened.

784
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,604
You still feel something.

785
00:35:28,184 --> 00:35:30,899
Jane just moved in with me,

786
00:35:31,336 --> 00:35:33,170
and you do this now?

787
00:35:49,672 --> 00:35:50,311
Hey mom.

788
00:35:50,326 --> 00:35:52,471
Hey. How was the concert?

789
00:35:52,472 --> 00:35:53,444
Awesome.

790
00:35:53,831 --> 00:35:55,156
How'd it go with dad?

791
00:35:55,671 --> 00:35:56,845
Not so awesome.

792
00:35:56,846 --> 00:35:59,365
Yeah, I kinda got that
from the sweatpants.

793
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:00,884
Mm. Come here, you.

794
00:36:02,738 --> 00:36:04,314
- Hi.
- Mm. Hi.

795
00:36:07,391 --> 00:36:08,602
So now what?

796
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:11,420
I... don't know.

797
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:14,811
Well, I'll tell you what you can't do.

798
00:36:15,512 --> 00:36:16,500
Give up.

799
00:36:17,976 --> 00:36:19,587
Taylor Swift has this song...

800
00:36:21,895 --> 00:36:23,684
"You belong with me." It's...

801
00:36:24,167 --> 00:36:25,858
about how she won't stop loving this guy

802
00:36:25,859 --> 00:36:28,544
even though he's with the wrong girl.

803
00:36:28,676 --> 00:36:30,752
And when she sang it tonight,

804
00:36:31,827 --> 00:36:33,680
all I could think about was you and dad.

805
00:36:35,173 --> 00:36:36,879
And this guy she loves...

806
00:36:37,331 --> 00:36:39,408
does he eventually come to his senses?

807
00:36:40,483 --> 00:36:42,495
It wouldn't be a very
good video if he didn't.

808
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:45,983
And don't worry.

809
00:36:46,548 --> 00:36:47,680
Dad will, too.

810
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,903
You think?

811
00:36:50,547 --> 00:36:53,503
Mom, you're fighting for him.

812
00:36:54,164 --> 00:36:56,080
What guy doesn't like that?

813
00:36:57,283 --> 00:36:58,528
You know...

814
00:37:00,115 --> 00:37:01,855
when you say something
really smart like that,

815
00:37:01,856 --> 00:37:04,364
it makes me think I did a really good job.

816
00:37:08,864 --> 00:37:10,507
You think it's gonna blister?

817
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,250
It's a first-degree burn.

818
00:37:12,251 --> 00:37:13,816
Tom, you'll be fine.

819
00:37:14,266 --> 00:37:16,120
But as your physician,

820
00:37:16,139 --> 00:37:19,400
let me recommend...
no more candlelit baths alone.

821
00:37:19,675 --> 00:37:21,687
Yeah, I don't know what I was thinking.

822
00:37:21,803 --> 00:37:24,042
Well, the good news is I can
declare you healthy enough

823
00:37:24,043 --> 00:37:27,415
for any and all sexual activity.

824
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,276
Actually...

825
00:37:33,336 --> 00:37:35,563
I need to get some work done.

826
00:37:37,727 --> 00:37:38,891
Okay.

827
00:37:38,988 --> 00:37:41,262
Well, the nice thing about
us living together...

828
00:37:41,263 --> 00:37:44,300
if you change your mind,
you know where to find me.

829
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,583
Okay.

830
00:37:53,731 --> 00:37:55,647
That's the last of them.

831
00:37:55,883 --> 00:37:56,888
Okay.

832
00:37:57,148 --> 00:38:00,199
Actually, we're not done here.

833
00:38:01,677 --> 00:38:03,352
I want to talk to you.

834
00:38:04,635 --> 00:38:06,640
Is this about what happened at school?

835
00:38:06,641 --> 00:38:07,739
Yes.

836
00:38:12,048 --> 00:38:14,330
You need to know that it is never okay

837
00:38:14,331 --> 00:38:16,392
to throw a stapler at someone.

838
00:38:16,923 --> 00:38:18,014
I know.

839
00:38:18,015 --> 00:38:19,250
It's also never okay

840
00:38:19,251 --> 00:38:22,298
to sweep a bunch of
stuff off someone's desk

841
00:38:22,299 --> 00:38:25,080
because you don't like what
they're saying about your son.

842
00:38:26,892 --> 00:38:30,023
Particularly if they've
just had bunion surgery.

843
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:32,063
You did that to Mrs. Butters?

844
00:38:32,064 --> 00:38:34,363
I'm not proud of it, but yeah.

845
00:38:34,955 --> 00:38:36,567
I was really mad.

846
00:38:38,491 --> 00:38:39,896
Just like you.

847
00:38:41,533 --> 00:38:45,816
M.J., something horrible happened to you,

848
00:38:47,084 --> 00:38:50,166
and every time you started
to get angry about it,

849
00:38:51,243 --> 00:38:56,665
I wanted to cover it up with
ice cream or video games,

850
00:38:57,436 --> 00:39:00,584
but the truth is,
we shouldn't cover it up.

851
00:39:01,435 --> 00:39:03,080
We should let it out.

852
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:08,567
Now we can't hurt people...

853
00:39:11,404 --> 00:39:12,792
but we can...

854
00:39:13,912 --> 00:39:15,299
hurt jam.

855
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,068
Mom!

856
00:39:26,407 --> 00:39:28,803
People sent us this to
help us feel better,

857
00:39:29,256 --> 00:39:30,612
and it's going to,

858
00:39:31,431 --> 00:39:33,315
just not in the way they thought.

859
00:39:37,624 --> 00:39:38,883
Come on, buddy.

860
00:39:39,703 --> 00:39:41,923
You got a lot to be angry about.

861
00:39:43,895 --> 00:39:47,140
What happened... sucks.

862
00:40:14,232 --> 00:40:15,555
Oh, sweetie.

863
00:40:18,025 --> 00:40:19,775
I love you.

864
00:40:19,776 --> 00:40:21,167
I love you.

865
00:40:21,984 --> 00:40:24,315
I love you so much.

866
00:40:27,747 --> 00:40:29,758
That's a cake I made for a
wedding a few years ago.

867
00:40:29,759 --> 00:40:30,834
I know what you're gonna say.

868
00:40:30,835 --> 00:40:32,703
- It's too extravagant.
- It's not big enough.

869
00:40:33,555 --> 00:40:36,385
Oh. Well, I suppose
we could add another tier.

870
00:40:36,915 --> 00:40:38,079
Make it two.

871
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:41,408
I really appreciate this, Bree.

872
00:40:41,827 --> 00:40:43,759
Ben is such a guy.

873
00:40:43,971 --> 00:40:46,079
He's not gonna be any help
planning this wedding.

874
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,642
Yes, especially since he's dealing

875
00:40:47,643 --> 00:40:50,567
with the nasty business of the body.

876
00:40:50,603 --> 00:40:53,239
Oh, that? No, Ben's in the clear.

877
00:40:53,419 --> 00:40:54,318
Really?

878
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:56,006
Yeah, the cops called this morning.

879
00:40:56,007 --> 00:40:59,078
Uh, they figured out the guy they found

880
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:00,598
died eight months ago.

881
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:03,027
That was way before Ben
started construction.

882
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:06,691
Yeah, the cops think the guy
was just some poor drifter.

883
00:41:06,692 --> 00:41:07,691
Anyway, it's over.

884
00:41:07,692 --> 00:41:08,823
Oh, good.

885
00:41:09,164 --> 00:41:10,987
Well, now we can focus all our energy

886
00:41:10,988 --> 00:41:13,912
on giving you the best
wedding in the world.

887
00:41:14,828 --> 00:41:16,984
Tomorrow we'll start our planning.

888
00:41:20,332 --> 00:41:22,210
<i>Yes, in life,</i>

889
00:41:22,211 --> 00:41:26,175
<i>when we see an opportunity,
we have to take it,</i>

890
00:41:29,251 --> 00:41:30,570
<i>whether it's the hope</i>

891
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:33,879
<i>of winning back the love of our life...</i>

892
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:39,079
<i>a shot at proving our worth...</i>

893
00:41:41,323 --> 00:41:45,943
<i>or the chance to show a
child the right path.</i>

894
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:54,375
<i>But sometimes when we answer the call...</i>

895
00:41:54,554 --> 00:41:55,075
Hello?

896
00:41:55,076 --> 00:41:56,450
Hi. It's Bree.

897
00:41:56,451 --> 00:42:00,763
<i>We have no idea what
opportunity awaits us.</i>

898
00:42:00,764 --> 00:42:02,664
Renee just told me the good news,

899
00:42:03,083 --> 00:42:06,603
and I wanted to thank you
for keeping my secret.

900
00:42:06,604 --> 00:42:08,990
Ah, no worries. I told you I would.

901
00:42:09,182 --> 00:42:11,813
I know but even when suspicion
moved on to you,

902
00:42:11,813 --> 00:42:14,267
you still protected me,
and that's very honorable.

903
00:42:14,268 --> 00:42:15,786
Really, it was no big deal.

904
00:42:15,787 --> 00:42:16,986
Maybe not to you.

905
00:42:16,987 --> 00:42:19,606
You're not the one who
put a body in the ground.

906
00:42:19,607 --> 00:42:21,542
You have to understand,
a day doesn't go by

907
00:42:21,543 --> 00:42:24,836
when that does not weigh
heavily on my conscience.

908
00:42:25,639 --> 00:42:26,804
Gotcha.
