1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:02,202
<i>Previously on...</i>

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,760
<i>Susan tracked down the wife
of the man she helped bury</i>

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,770
<i>and tried to make things right.</i>

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,520
I think you added an extra zero.

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,380
I wanna do something to help.

6
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,680
<i>Lynette adjusted to life without Tom.</i>

7
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,050
Lots of things like this
are going to happen.

8
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,180
I have to be able to fix them.

9
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,790
<i>Mike stopped Ben from making a mistake...</i>

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,740
- Are you crazy?
- Who is this guy?

11
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:24,740
Sorry, pal,

12
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,410
the deal's off.
He's not taking your money.

13
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,290
<i>Then told him something
he didn't know about Renee.</i>

14
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:31,090
If she divorced a cricket player,

15
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:32,110
I might recognize the name.

16
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,360
If she divorced a cricket player,

17
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,330
she wouldn't have gotten $12 million.

18
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,680
<i>And Bree's falling out with her friends</i>

19
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,670
<i>led to some dangerous behavior.</i>

20
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:40,920
Can I buy you another drink?

21
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,900
You can buy me breakfast.

22
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:52,010
<i>Bree Van de Kamp had always
enjoyed a sterling reputation.</i>

23
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,500
<i>She was known for being kind to strangers</i>

24
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,010
<i>and for greeting them with a warm welcome.</i>

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,690
<i>She made sure every guest felt comfortable</i>

26
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:13,530
<i>and that no part of her
home was off-limits.</i>

27
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,140
<i>She never had the heart
to turn anyone away,</i>

28
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:23,500
<i>because no matter how many
guests she was hosting</i>

29
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,980
<i>or how late she was entertaining,</i>

30
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,840
<i>her generosity knew no bounds.</i>

31
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,080
That was amazing.

32
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,000
It was nice.

33
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,510
And unexpected.

34
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,540
An hour ago, when I offered
to buy you that glass of wine,

35
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,950
I didn't know what a good
investment it would be.

36
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,970
I don't waste any time...

37
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,020
when I see something I like.

38
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,400
Decisive.

39
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,130
And sexy. You may be the perfect woman.

40
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,250
Get out.

41
00:01:58,670 --> 00:01:59,710
What?

44
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,700
Yeah, and my neighbor, Karen McClusky,

45
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,670
starts her day at 5:00
with a pot of coffee

46
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,440
and a seat near her front window.

47
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,140
This is my only chance
to get you out of here

48
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,450
without her noticing.

49
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,080
Who cares if she notices?

50
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,820
I do. I have a certain
reputation on this street,

51
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:24,650
and I don't want to become
the subject of idle gossip.

52
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:25,860
Now come on.

53
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:33,010
Well, uh... thanks again.
This-this was terrific.

54
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,010
Ah, yes, here are your pants.

55
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:38,790
Thanks. Uh, really love to see you again.

56
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,880
Aw, that's sweet.
Don't forget your jacket.

57
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,490
It's quite chilly out tonight.

58
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,130
I'm serious. Let's do this again.

59
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,460
How about Friday?

60
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,100
Oh, I'm afraid I'm busy.

61
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,640
Thursday or Wednesday?

62
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,690
Can I at least get your phone number

63
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,780
or your last name?

64
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,280
You seem like a good person,

65
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,600
so I'm gonna be honest.

66
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,320
I have no interest in having
a relationship with you.

67
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,010
Why not?

68
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,960
Because I am past the point in my life

69
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,540
where I hope every date will flower

70
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,650
into a meaningful relationship.

71
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,300
I have had husbands and boyfriends,

72
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,360
and they've brought me nothing
but heartbreak and pain.

73
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:21,790
So now all I want is a body
in my bed at night, briefly.

74
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,160
So that's it?
You're just gonna kick me out?

75
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:28,120
I am so sorry. Where are my manners?

76
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:34,780
<i>Yes, Bree had always enjoyed
a sterling reputation...</i>

77
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,810
It was lovely having sex with you.

78
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,860
Have a wonderful day.

79
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:46,030
<i>And she saw no reason that should change.</i>

80
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:02,490
<i>In the life of every housewife,</i>

81
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:05,720
<i>there comes a time for renovation...</i>

82
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:12,160
<i>when an eager child learns a new skill...</i>

83
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:19,050
<i>when a romantic evening
becomes an unsightly mess...</i>

84
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:26,460
<i>or when a dinner party
comes to an unexpected end.</i>

85
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:32,540
<i>But sometimes the only thing
that needs to be removed...</i>

86
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,230
<i>is a memory.</i>

87
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,680
So basically I want a whole new look...

88
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,650
new furniture, new paint, you name it.

89
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,770
So we can get rid of everything,

90
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:47,170
including the Virgin Mary and her kid?

91
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:50,300
Ah. No, no, no, no.
My faith is very important to me.

92
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,240
Name three apostles.

93
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,690
Okay, fine. Move it to the guest room.

94
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,050
Hey, can you guys get this
all done in two weeks?

95
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,860
- Probably.
- Why the rush?

96
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,920
That's when Carlos is done with rehab.

97
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,430
I don't want him coming
back into the room.

98
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,590
It just freaks him out.

99
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,510
Why would this room freak him out?

100
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,910
'Cause it was where Celia was conceived,

101
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,860
and frankly, that kid's
been nothing but trouble.

102
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:18,010
Uh, so, Lynette, is Tom back from Paris?

103
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:20,490
Not yet. Jane arranged for them...

104
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:23,100
to pop over to London for a couple days.

105
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,000
That slut.

106
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,920
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no.

107
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,400
I mean, yeah, she's a slut,

108
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,920
but I'm done feeling sorry for myself.

109
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,260
It's the kick in the pants
I need to start dating again.

110
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,310
- Good for you.
- Yeah, it's a big step.

111
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:38,530
I know, which is why I'm hoping
you two might know someone

112
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,040
you could set me up with.

113
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:44,920
Uh, sure. We will think about it.

114
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,110
What was that?

115
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,050
What was what?

116
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,990
What was that look thing you just did?

117
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,800
Oh. There it is. You did it again.

118
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:57,530
It... Lynette, you're a wonderful person.

119
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,300
You are strong and sexy and smart,

120
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:04,030
so... fixing you up would
be a bit of a challenge.

121
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,350
Why?

122
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,000
Well... because you're so unique.

123
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,930
Such an original.

124
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:16,280
Feisty and so certain of what you believe.

125
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,610
Stop trying to make all those
sound like compliments.

126
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,850
You're basically telling me I'm a bitch.

127
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:24,930
Oh, my god!

128
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:29,950
We're just saying it takes
a certain kind of man

129
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,690
to appreciate all you have to offer.

130
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,860
Preferably one with a hide like a rhino

131
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,270
and the fighting spirit
of a baby harp seal.

132
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,090
Okay, so we're done sugarcoating?

133
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,670
Okay, look, I've met me.

134
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,710
I know I can come on a little strong,

135
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,980
but I have to believe there's
a guy out there somewhere

136
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,740
that finds that appealing.

137
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:53,760
And... you two are gonna
help me find that guy.

138
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,880
Ohh, fine. You win.

139
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,590
You always do, because you're so...

140
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:00,880
feisty.

141
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,700
Oh, my god.

142
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,450
Aah! Oh, my god!

143
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:14,240
Why are you still here?!
Didn't the alarm go off?

144
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,360
Yeah, 4 o'clock in the morning.
I shut it off.

145
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,880
No. That's when you leave.
That's when all the men leave.

146
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,150
It's the rule.

147
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,610
Okay, I'll get rid of whoever's knocking,

148
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,330
and you can sneak out the back. Stay put.

149
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:26,870
Yeah, but I have...

150
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,320
And don't move.

151
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:32,440
Karen, hi.

152
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:34,000
Th-this is not a good time.

153
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,510
I am so angry, I could spit.

154
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,080
You've gotta help me, Bree.

155
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,210
With what?

156
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,150
The church bake sale.

157
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,470
Everyone knows I make the lemon bars,

158
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:47,890
but this year, Helen Simpson
says she's making them, too,

159
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:51,730
and I can't compete with her.
She uses real lemons.

160
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:53,370
And what do you use?

161
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,230
I'm on a fixed income, okay?

162
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,670
Oh, God!

163
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,390
I mean... that must be so hard for you.

164
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,850
You're the head of the Women's Auxiliary.

165
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,200
What should I do?

166
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,160
Have you considered covering your lemons?

167
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,280
What?

168
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,440
I-I mean, you have lemon bars covered,

169
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:19,060
so I'm gonna ask Helen to
make blueberry cheesecake.

170
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,390
Okay, thanks.

171
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,310
Now off you go.

172
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,960
I will. I'm just waiting
for the naked guy behind me

173
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,530
to finish getting dressed.

174
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,150
Sorry. Couldn't wait.

175
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,290
I've got a meeting.
Have you seen my pants?

176
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,950
Uh, you left them on the kitchen island.

177
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,800
Don't give me the judgmental eyebrow.

178
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,840
He is a dear old friend of mine

179
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,670
visiting from out of town.

180
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,490
See you later, Dan.

181
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,790
Don. Hi.

182
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,010
Just go.

183
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,840
Now can I give you the eyebrow?

184
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,560
Fine. I met him last night at Murray's.

185
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,580
My car broke down, and I...

186
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,640
I went inside to wait for a tow truck.

187
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,270
And how about the guy I saw
leaving the other morning?

188
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,300
My god. What time are you getting up?

189
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,390
Caught that one on the way to the can.

190
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,620
What is going on, Bree?

191
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,780
You don't seem... yourself lately.

192
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:21,750
I am absolutely fine.

193
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,690
Okay. Whatever you say.

194
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,550
Come on.

195
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,280
What is your big surprise?

196
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,460
Just a few more feet.

197
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,610
Because if it's a 3-way, I gotta warn you,

198
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,330
that's how I met my ex-husband.

199
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,200
Uh, no, it's not that.

200
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:52,200
Your fish.

201
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,050
You're getting rid of it?

202
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:56,130
Well, I know how much you hate it.

203
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,700
Well, it meant so much to you...

204
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,540
for some stupid-ass reason
you once explained to me.

205
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,440
Yeah.

206
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,290
Bruce and I had some good times together.

207
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:05,180
But you and I have been
having our share, too,

208
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:08,130
and, uh, you know,
if I have to pick one of you

209
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:10,620
for the long haul, well...

210
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,990
The long haul? What are you trying to say?

211
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:15,550
I'm trying to say...

212
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,350
I want you to come to
dinner tomorrow night.

213
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:22,690
Ah. Sounded like there
was more to it than that.

214
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,040
Well, maybe there is,

215
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,400
but you'll have to come
to dinner to find out.

216
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,580
Sounds intriguing.

217
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,590
We're not having swordfish, are we?

218
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:36,900
Work.

219
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,870
I will be upstairs.

220
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,050
Keep it short.

221
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,510
Hey, Carl. What's up?

222
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,490
No, no, don't send out the layoff notices.

223
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,780
We'll make payroll. I've got this covered.

224
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,670
No, not the bank.

225
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,240
I'm working on something else.

226
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,090
Claudia.

227
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,850
Where the hell is my husband?

228
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:22,890
Oh, hey, I'm sorry. The door slipped.

229
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,840
Whoa. Okay. I just vacuumed,
so if you could...

230
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:25,970
Ramon!

231
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,570
Ramon!

232
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:30,130
He isn't here. H-how did you find me?

233
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:32,550
Your address was on the check, genius.

234
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,410
When I find you,

235
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:35,590
I'm gonna wring your neck like a chicken!

236
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,920
You seem a little tense.
Do... do you want some herbal tea?

237
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,660
I want my husband!

238
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,080
What makes you think I know where he is?

239
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,260
You told my daughter
he was never coming back.

240
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,130
You think it's that easy
to steal my man, bitch?

241
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:52,950
Wait. You think that
I'm having an affair with Ramon?

242
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:54,770
Did he give these to you?

243
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,680
No! No! These are from my husband.

244
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,210
So you're cheating on your husband,
too. You whore.

245
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:03,170
Okay, look, I swear
there is no possible way

246
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,960
I could be having an affair
with your husband. Trust me.

247
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,620
Well, I think you're lying.

248
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,860
And you wanna see what I do to liars?

249
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,450
Hey, mom. Who's that?

250
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,170
Please don't.

251
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,810
You're the home wrecker, not me.

252
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,440
But this isn't over.

253
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:42,260
I wanna get to the carpet
store before it closes.

254
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,760
Oh, relax. It's a block away.

255
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,060
Just need to confirm my appointment.

256
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:49,210
Hi. Making sure I'm still
on with Frank 2:00 Thursday,

257
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,970
and reminding you what
happened the last time

258
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,720
you screwed up my appointment.

259
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,700
She hasn't forgotten, Renee.
None of us have.

260
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:57,260
Hello.

261
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,440
How are you? This is my friend Lynette.

262
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,510
Hi.

263
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,770
Who's the lucky guy doing you?

264
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,120
Actually...

265
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,230
Nobody. My husband and I are separated,

266
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,870
and he just took
his girlfriend to London and...

267
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,200
He was talking about your hair.

268
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,720
Oh, of course you were.

269
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:22,100
I'm gonna meet you at the carpet store.

270
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,250
Seriously, your hair is amazing.

271
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:26,180
Any chance you'd ever let me style you?

272
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:28,400
Uh, well, I've been going to
Gustave on main for years.

273
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,390
I'd feel like I was cheating on him.

274
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,680
Well, he doesn't have to know.

275
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:36,820
Yeah, but...

276
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:40,250
Gustave is jealous and french,

277
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,560
and I wouldn't want this ending up

278
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,870
a pistols-at-dawn kind of thing.

279
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,970
Loyalty. Just makes me want you more.

280
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,840
All right. Stop sniffing each other.

281
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,950
I need a bottle of conditioner.

282
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,490
Coming right up.

283
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,950
Well, he seems great.

284
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,870
Why don't you set me up with him?

285
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,590
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

286
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,350
Why not? You saw he was flirting.

287
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,150
Well, no, he's not right for you.

288
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,880
He just got divorced,

289
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,870
and he's not looking for anything serious.

290
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,190
Neither am I. It's perfect.

291
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:14,040
Honey, you're about to go on
your first date in 20 years.

292
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,450
I really don't wanna see you get hurt.

293
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,610
Don't worry about me.

294
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:19,760
I'm feisty, remember?

295
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,550
No.

296
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,790
Don't make me use the baby voice.

297
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:27,190
Oh, not the baby voice.

298
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,180
Pwease.

299
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,900
I even hate when babies
use the baby voice.

300
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,610
Pwease, Wenee,

301
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:36,800
help Wynette date the big,
sexy hair dwesser.

302
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,250
- pwease.
- Okay, okay.

303
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,550
Okay. Oh, thanks.

304
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:44,480
Look, Lynette may be
loyal to her hairdresser,

305
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,110
but she is single.

306
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,670
So maybe the two of...

307
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:50,410
I'd love to. How about tonight?

308
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:52,480
Sounds great.

309
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,740
Leave your number with Linda.
I'll call you when I'm done.

310
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,550
Great. Thank you.

311
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,720
To thank you, I will never
again do the baby voice.

312
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,630
Ah, I appreciate it.

313
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,020
But I've still got the british one.

314
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,510
Pip, pip, cheerio,
jolly ol' crumpets and tea,

315
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,170
let's go. Ta-ta.

316
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,550
Oh, my god.

317
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,310
Oh, my god!

318
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,900
Why can't we walk to the bus by ourselves?

319
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,240
All of our friends do.

320
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,040
I'm not trusting you with Celia.
Remember your gerbil?

321
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:43,280
I was younger then.

322
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,330
I didn't know how to make a parachute yet.

323
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,180
Okay, fine. Go.

324
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,190
Seriously?

325
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,610
Yeah. Walk, run. Whatever.

326
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,450
Quick, before she changes her mind!

327
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,190
Susan!

328
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:07,310
And that's when I decided
to fly to Oklahoma city

329
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:08,390
and visit them.

330
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:09,550
Unbelievable.

331
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,800
And I obviously didn't have $1,000 cash,

332
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,100
so I had to write a check.

333
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:15,120
With your address on it. Perfect.

334
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,900
And I was hoping that
when she calmed down,

335
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,450
she would realize
we weren't having an affair.

336
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,920
Apparently not.

337
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,730
I can't believe
you would go to his family.

338
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:25,470
Why would you do that?

339
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:28,690
I felt so guilty. Oh, it was eating me up.

340
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:29,600
The guilt again?

341
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,390
You feel guilty, so you assault a cop.

342
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,000
You feel guilty,
so you paint the murder scene.

343
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,020
You feel guilty, so you go to his house?

344
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,730
When is this gonna end?

345
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,350
I just needed to make sure they were okay.

346
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:40,830
You know, they didn't do anything.

347
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,360
Susan, we were in the clear.

348
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:44,950
There was nobody who
could connect him to us,

349
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,770
and then you had to go tell his wife...

350
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:48,920
No, no, no, his widow...

351
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,880
he was never coming back.

352
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,200
I didn't tell Claudia. I told Marisa.

353
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,690
Who the hell is Marisa?

354
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:59,440
His 15-year-old stepdaughter.

355
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,760
Wait. You talked to her?

356
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:09,880
Do you think he was...

357
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:18,660
Well, how do you know? Did she tell you?

358
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,860
She didn't have to.

359
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,660
I've only seen that look in
someone's eyes once before...

360
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,030
yours.

361
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,730
Do you think she's told her mother?

362
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,730
It didn't seem like she told anyone.

363
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,300
She needs to.

364
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:54,300
Keeping a secret like that...
it just... tears you up.

365
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,420
I'm so sorry. I...

366
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:02,670
I don't know how
we're gonna get out of this one.

367
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,490
I do.

368
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,140
Call Claudia and tell
her I wanna talk to her.

369
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,520
Who do I say you are?

370
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:21,720
The woman's who gonna tell her
the truth about her husband.

371
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,900
So... what's your feeling on carpaccio?

372
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,780
My feeling is I'd like to
be locked inside a room

373
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,990
made of carpaccio and eat my way out.

374
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,060
I am so happy to hear you say that.

375
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,970
My ex never let me order anything raw

376
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,220
without giving me a lecture
about the dangers of E. coli.

377
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:54,070
Ugh. Sexy.

378
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:58,370
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
be talking about her.

379
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,810
No, it's nice to hear

380
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:01,880
about someone else's marriage
problems for a change.

381
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,280
Oh, there was no problem,

382
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,060
as long as we did
everything exactly her way.

383
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,320
"Why do you have to
work for somebody else?"

384
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,500
"Why don't you get your own salon?"

385
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,020
I can see how that would be frustrating.

386
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:17,880
Although...

387
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,140
I suppose someone could argue

388
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,210
that she was just trying to help you.

389
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:25,500
Help me? By making me feel
like a failure all the time?

390
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,690
Yeah, that is pretty awful.

391
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,860
Although...

392
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,030
maybe she meant it as
a motivational technique.

393
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:37,170
So you agree with her?

394
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,540
I am just trying to understand

395
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,830
what she might have been thinking.

396
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:44,700
I mean, you don't wanna be
a stylist forever, right?

397
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,040
Why not?

398
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,470
Because...

399
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:49,890
who wants to be cutting
hair when they're 60?

400
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,340
I mean, wouldn't you rather be
checking in on your own salon

401
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,370
from a beach in Bali?

402
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,080
I like cutting hair.

403
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,840
Then that is all that matters.

404
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:04,080
Although...

405
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:10,850
My goodness, you certainly do work out.

406
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:14,290
I just love a man with a firm bicep.

407
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:15,800
You want to feel mine?

408
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,660
Reverend Sykes, what are you doing here?

409
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:21,580
The more pertinent question is,
what are you doing here?

410
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,750
Well... as you always say,

411
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,180
there's no point in
preaching to the choir.

412
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,880
You've gotta go out into the world

413
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:31,380
and... try to set
the youth on a different path.

414
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:33,840
I think your path should
take you elsewhere,

415
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,590
perhaps to one of those ladies

416
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:37,710
not so burdened down with clothing.

417
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:42,880
I can only imagine what you must think.

418
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:46,170
Oh, what I think is,
as Karen McCluskey put it,

419
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:48,660
"You're back on the yahoo juice."

420
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,710
Oh, that's not mine.

421
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:52,880
Some poor soul who was here
before me must have left it.

422
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:05,980
I suppose I have allowed myself
to slip back into some...

423
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,650
old habits.

424
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:08,830
Well, that's why I'm here,

425
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,270
to keep you from slipping any further,

426
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,730
so gather up your things and let's go.

427
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,160
You must be so disappointed in me.

428
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,480
It's all right, Bree.
I've been your pastor for years,

429
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,300
and you're the most proper
and appropriate woman

430
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,290
I've ever come across.

431
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,970
This is obviously a temporary lapse

432
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:25,150
and not who you truly are.

433
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:29,890
- How can you say that?
- Excuse me?

434
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:32,210
How can you say who I truly am

435
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:33,380
when I don't even know myself?

436
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,810
We can discuss this later.
Now come on. Follow me.

437
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:37,710
But I have been following you for years,

438
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:40,770
and I am still terribly lost.

439
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,700
I need to find out who I really am,

440
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:47,370
and I think... maybe the place
I need to search is right here.

441
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:52,520
You do realize,
if you continue to do this,

442
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,780
I can no longer let you
lead the Women's Auxiliary.

443
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,450
You can't do that.
The bake sale is this sunday.

444
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,290
It would be a disaster without me.

445
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,590
I'm looking at a much
bigger disaster right here.

446
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,560
Now you're just being cruel.

447
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:09,340
That's not very ministerial of you.

448
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,730
I didn't only come here as your minister.

449
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,680
I also came as your friend.

450
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,970
But clearly, you have no
interest in either right now.

451
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:28,850
So as you can see,

452
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:30,770
within two years of opening the salon,

453
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:33,850
you will have amortized
all the start-up costs.

454
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,330
Uh, we are not ready yet.

455
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:36,900
At that point, there's no reason

456
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:39,030
you couldn't consistently turn a profit.

457
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,160
Oh, my god.

458
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:42,660
Can we talk about something else?

459
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:45,320
I'm just trying to help.
From what Renee tells me,

460
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,010
people go to the salon because of you,

461
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:49,670
and yet half that money... your money...

462
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:50,880
is going to the owner.

463
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,620
Seriously, this is making my stomach hurt.

464
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,390
Could it be 'cause you're scared?

465
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,400
How could you say that?
You know nothing about me.

466
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:01,290
I know. I know. It's just...
we've spent an hour

467
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:03,510
coming up with a perfectly
reasonable 5-year plan,

468
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:05,710
and it just makes your stomach hurt.

469
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:09,360
You know who else had
a 5-year plan? Stalin.

470
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:17,710
Okay. Oh, I'm sorry I said anything.

471
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:21,630
You're happy where you are. That's great.

472
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:24,090
There's nothing wrong with being average.

473
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,010
I am not average.

474
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,220
I'm sorry. Adequate, settled, comfortable.

475
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,640
Whatever you wanna call it.

476
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:31,170
Why don't we just order?

477
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,480
Good idea.

478
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:39,390
Oh, the salmon looks good.

479
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,790
At a steakhouse?

480
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:44,270
You're right. I'm sure
it's perfectly adequate...

481
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,610
settled, comfortable.

482
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,640
I don't know what Ben has up his sleeve,

483
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,480
but it's gonna be a special night,

484
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,260
so I really wanna look great.

485
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,270
Speaking of which,

486
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:03,270
how was your, uh, big date with Lynette?

487
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,810
Ah! Little tight.

488
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,220
- Sorry.
- Oh.

489
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,490
The date was interesting.

490
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,120
I really owe you one.

491
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,840
What happened to your hair?

492
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,300
You happened to my hair.

493
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,090
Frank was the one guy in this podunk town

494
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:26,570
who knew how to relax
a black woman's hair.

495
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,400
Now I look like an extra from
"Foxy brown."

496
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:32,280
And thanks to you,
our relationship is ruined.

497
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:33,870
Wait. Frank did that?

498
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:36,160
I had no idea our date was that bad.

499
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,350
Oh, really?

500
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:40,010
Did you or did you not
give him a 5-year plan

501
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,530
on a cocktail napkin?!

502
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:45,440
Well, I may have made a few
constructive suggestions,

503
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,540
but only because I saw
potential in the guy.

504
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,740
He could really be something.

505
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,630
He is something, and he likes who he is.

506
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:55,100
He doesn't need you telling
him that it isn't good enough.

507
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:58,170
I am not going to apologize
for trying to help the guy.

508
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,350
If he can't handle it, that's his problem.

509
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,600
Ah, I see.

510
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,470
So it's his fault
you tried to control him?

511
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:08,390
Just like it was Tom's fault
you tried to control him?

512
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:12,010
What did both of those
guys have in common?

513
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:15,580
Oh, wait. Give me a second.
Uh, I'll think of it.

514
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,130
I'd say put on a thinking cap,

515
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:18,650
but I don't think there's one big enough.

516
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,440
Well, at least I can cover up this mess.

517
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:23,240
That one is gonna take
a hell of a lot more work.

518
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:32,400
Come on. Take off the scarf.

519
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,320
How bad could it be?

520
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:38,190
You'd be surprised.
I look like a bottle brush.

521
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,740
So what's the big occasion here?

522
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,810
First, a toast.

523
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,990
To the woman who came roaring into my life

524
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,330
like a one-eyed wombat.

525
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:49,890
Uh, it's a good thing.

526
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:51,640
A force who makes each day

527
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,590
more exciting and
surprising than the last.

528
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:03,640
Now... I realize
it's only been a few months,

529
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,600
but, uh...

530
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,190
I found myself falling for you, Renee.

531
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,550
And, uh...

532
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:14,450
I know a keeper when I see one.

533
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:17,200
Oh, Ben.

534
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,610
You like it?

535
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:21,690
- I love it.
- Yeah?

536
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,630
It's just... it's so fast.

537
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,600
Well, if you need to
take your time, I under...

538
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,100
No, no, I don't need to take my time. Yes!

539
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,520
I'll marry you!

540
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:37,850
You have made me so happy.

541
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,910
You don't know what you've done for me.

542
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:45,400
When my... marriage ended,

543
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,360
I felt so betrayed.

544
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,870
I decided I would never
trust anyone again.

545
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,010
And then you came along.

546
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:58,130
I just feel so safe with you

547
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:00,720
in a way that I've never felt before.

548
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:04,820
And I know that...

549
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:07,620
in my heart this is right.

550
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,170
I can't do this.

551
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,080
What?

552
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:20,810
Just forget I said anything, okay?

553
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:23,220
Forget you asked me to marry you?

554
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,580
What? Give me the ring.

555
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:27,260
You don't wanna marry me, Renee.
I'm an awful person.

556
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,910
You're an amazing person.

557
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,830
Now slide it on right there.

558
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,850
- I can't.
- Why?

559
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,130
What is going on?

560
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:36,390
Oh, god. You're gonna hate me for this.

561
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:42,960
I'm having some financial problems,

562
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:43,880
and...

563
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,610
I guess I thought if we pooled
our resources, that... oh.

564
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,330
You wanted to marry me for my money?

565
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:53,340
I know.

566
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,950
I'm sorry.

567
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:05,130
Look, Renee...

568
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:09,640
I meant every word I said.

569
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,080
I do love you.

570
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,720
There's really no way for me
to know that now, is there?

571
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,540
Hi, Claudia.

572
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,770
I'm Gaby. Thanks for coming.

573
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:49,460
Yeah. This one said
you wanted to talk to me?

574
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,260
What about?

575
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,600
We should go inside.

576
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:01,150
- You're not coming?
- No.

577
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,750
I'm-I'm gonna wait out here.

578
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:05,380
I think you two could
probably use some privacy.

579
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,010
It's not usually this messy in here.
We're redecorating.

580
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,930
Excuse me, Mrs. Solis?
Do you have a second?

581
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,180
What-what is that?

582
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,890
Red wine. New year's eve party.

583
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:31,870
We were playing... smash-the-bottle,

584
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,030
which is a terrible game.

585
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,200
Okay. Uh, we're taking lunch.

586
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:37,440
Just wanted to give you
a heads-up before we replace it.

587
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:40,880
Great! Great. Don't need any
reminders of that crazy night.

588
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:44,790
Can I get you something to drink?

589
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,690
No. You can tell me what
the hell I'm doing here.

590
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:47,540
Where's Ramon?

591
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:50,620
Well... how to start this...

592
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:57,660
First of all, the man you're looking for...

593
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,600
his real name is Alejandro Perez.

594
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,380
What?

595
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,570
No, it's not.

596
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,000
Trust me.

597
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,150
I knew him before he ever met you.

598
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,440
How?

599
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,940
He was my stepfather.

600
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:25,490
You okay?

601
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:28,030
I just want all this to be over.

602
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:30,150
Me, too.

603
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,330
But it's never going to end.

604
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,480
She won't stop looking for him.

605
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,790
She still loves him.

606
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,520
So you didn't tell her?

607
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,690
No way.

608
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,300
She would never believe me.

609
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,280
Did you tell anyone?

610
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:50,690
No.

611
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,900
Marisa, I'm not gonna
pretend to understand

612
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,150
what you're dealing with.

613
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:59,470
But I have a friend who
went through the same thing,

614
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:04,200
and she said that as awful as it was,

615
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:09,510
keeping the secret only makes it worse.

616
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:15,430
So if he left you and your mom,

617
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:18,110
changed his name,
started a whole new life,

618
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:20,740
why'd he come back to see you?

619
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:25,060
I had visited my hometown.
I said some things about him.

620
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,590
He heard, and he wanted me to stop.

621
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,520
What kind of things?

622
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,210
Look, this isn't easy for me...

623
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:33,570
What kind of things?

624
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:37,690
When I was 15, he molested me.

625
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:46,890
You expect me to believe that?

626
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:50,120
I was a virgin, and he hurt me.

627
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:51,540
Liar.

628
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,570
Claudia.

629
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,800
I know this is hard to hear.

630
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,140
I don't know what you and your friend did.

631
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,810
I don't know what happened to my husband.

632
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:01,130
All I know is everything
I'm being told is a lie.

633
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,340
It's not! He was a child molester.

634
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:06,840
Shut up! You can make it
sound as bad as you want.

635
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,480
You can tell all the disgusting
lies you can think of.

636
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,970
I will never believe you.

637
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:12,740
Then believe me.

638
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:17,660
What?

639
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,880
I was too scared to tell you.

640
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,370
I know how much you love him.

641
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,190
Oh, my god.

642
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,050
Are you saying...

643
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,450
I kept thinking it would stop.

644
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:35,160
No. No.

645
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,910
Not my baby.

646
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,060
No.

647
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,020
No.

648
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,730
It is all my fault.

649
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:06,540
Come in.

650
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,020
You were right.

651
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,780
All those years, I thought I pushed Tom

652
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,420
because he needed me to.

653
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,050
Well, he did.

654
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:20,780
No, he didn't, and that guy wasn't Tom.

655
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,780
He was just a perfectly lovely guy,

656
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,370
perfectly content with his life

657
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:26,620
until hurricane Lynette hit him.

658
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,490
At least you recognize it.

659
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,640
They always say that's the first step.

660
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:32,600
Mm, can I tell you the truth?

661
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:36,300
There was a part of me that
recognized it the whole time.

662
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:39,060
A little voice inside my head telling me,

663
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:42,100
"You like this guy,
and you're driving him nuts. Stop."

664
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,230
But I couldn't.

665
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:48,010
What if after all these years,
I can't stop?

666
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:50,970
What if this is who I am?

667
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:55,670
Remember in college
you used to bite your nails?

668
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:56,960
You stopped that.

669
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:59,700
Yeah, by taking up smoking.

670
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,950
Remember how you quit smoking?

671
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:03,540
Yoga.

672
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:05,500
I've never seen you more relaxed

673
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,330
than when you were taking those classes.

674
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,690
I don't know.

675
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:10,300
All I'm saying is

676
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:12,400
you are the most determined person I know.

677
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,670
You can do anything you want.

678
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,450
I just wanna be different.

679
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:20,700
I'm sick of being
this hypercritical nut job.

680
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:22,830
It'll get better.

681
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:26,220
Trust me. And so will dating.

682
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,800
You will find somebody.

683
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,650
I hope you're right.

684
00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:33,810
I mean, hell, if you found Ben...

685
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:40,320
I'm joking. I'm joking.

686
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:42,680
Ben and I...

687
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,100
it's over.

688
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,840
So that's where the tough guy lives, huh?

689
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,240
Can we just do our business, please?

690
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:13,860
You pay every week, everyone's happy.

691
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:16,350
You miss one, it'll cost you.

692
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:17,570
You miss two...

693
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,760
You don't wanna miss two.

694
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,690
Don't worry.

695
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:23,540
I just have to get past this rough patch,

696
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,250
and then the money will be rolling in.

697
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:26,300
Take your time.

698
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:28,170
Besides, if you're not good for it,

699
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:30,880
I understand that pretty
girlfriend of yours is loaded.

700
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:34,520
She's got nothing to do with this.

701
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:37,600
You keep her out of it. You understand me?

702
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:41,550
There's a lot of tough
guys on this street.

703
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,670
Hi! Come in.

704
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:56,580
We're not staying.

705
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,960
Just... came to say good-bye.

706
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,440
And thank you.

707
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,990
You sure you don't wanna stay?
I have a guest room.

708
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,550
No, we need to be getting back.

709
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:06,330
This one's missed enough school already.

710
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,300
Give me a second, mija.

711
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,780
I still don't know how
this could have happened

712
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:26,810
under my nose.

713
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:29,190
You must think I'm
the worst mother in the world.

714
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:30,820
No.

715
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:34,140
At least you believe her.
My mother never did.

716
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:37,720
But I'm the one who brought
that man into her life.

717
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:40,360
You didn't know. Nobody ever knew...

718
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,680
What a monster he was?

719
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:44,440
I know now, thanks to you.

720
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,920
You said that stain was red wine?

721
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,420
You should probably get rid of that.

722
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,330
Bree, what are you doing here?

723
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:22,540
Oh, I've been running
this bake sale for eight years.

724
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:23,680
Why wouldn't I be here?

725
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,720
I told everyone you weren't feeling well

726
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,060
and had decided to sit this one out.

727
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:30,140
Well, I'm feeling better now.

728
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:32,020
Besides every bake sale

729
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:34,660
needs... a tart.

730
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,940
While I appreciate a good
culinary double entendre

731
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,100
as much as the next man,

732
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,430
I really don't think you should
be here in your condition.

733
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:47,400
I'm fine. Look how beautifully
my dessert came out.

734
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,940
Shortcrust pastry, fresh strawberries...

735
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,450
You've obviously been drinking.

736
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:53,750
I don't want you to embarrass yourself.

737
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:56,700
Well, I appreciate your concern, reverend,

738
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:58,890
but I can take care of myself.

739
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:06,950
You're very welcome.

740
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:09,120
Tell all your friends to come to my table.

741
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,480
All right, who's next?

742
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,620
Greg.

743
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,080
Oh, my god. Bree.

744
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,120
Wh-what are you doing here?

745
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,410
This is my church.

746
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:21,500
Are you a member?
I've never seen you here before.

747
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:25,010
I, uh, just joined. Yes.
Nice talking to you.

748
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:25,930
Wait, wait.

749
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:28,210
Can't I tempt you with a slice

750
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:30,790
of my famous strawberry... tart?

751
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:32,770
I, uh, I should probably get going...

752
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:35,320
What a funny coincidence this was.

753
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,260
Will I see you at Murray's later?

754
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:39,820
Or... we could just
skip the Murray's part,

755
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:42,300
and you could come...
straight to my house.

756
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:45,580
Greg, who is this woman?

757
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:49,600
Uh, this is Bree.
She, um, she goes to this church.

758
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:52,390
Doesn't sound like you met her in church.

759
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,580
Excuse me. What business
is it of yours how we met?

760
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:56,700
I'm his wife.

761
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:00,740
I guess it is your business.

762
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,550
Unbelievable.

763
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,630
You're always going on about working late

764
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:11,190
and sleeping in the office, and meanwhile,

765
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,390
you're hanging out at dive
bars picking up trash.

766
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,740
I don't like your accusation.

767
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,530
Oh, yeah? Guess what I don't like?

768
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:22,500
You screwing my husband!

769
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:24,280
Bree, this is what I was worried about.

770
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:25,540
You need to leave.

771
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,920
You're kicking me out?
She's the one making a scene,

772
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,690
and a dry batch of cupcakes,
by the looks of it.

773
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:35,300
Thanks, but I'm not
looking for baking tips

774
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,550
from the town whore.

775
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,560
Don't listen to her, Bree.
She doesn't know who you are.

776
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,450
Actually, Karen...

777
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,930
I think she does.

778
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,960
Now I know you're all anxious to dig in

779
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,020
to the delicious gossip
I've provided for you.

780
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:03,100
And I could really use a drink.

781
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:13,000
<i>Yes, in the life of every housewife,</i>

782
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,720
<i>there comes a time for renovation.</i>

783
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,490
<i>She may be doing away with
an unpleasant memory...</i>

784
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:29,160
<i>breaking up a once happy relationship...</i>

785
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:37,710
<i>or making the necessary changes
to prepare for a new one.</i>

786
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:43,300
<i>But no matter how much a housewife</i>

787
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,980
<i>may embrace the way her life is changing,</i>

788
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:49,670
<i>the people in her neighborhood</i>

789
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:52,610
<i>may take a different view.</i>

790
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,600
What's the matter?

791
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,090
Maybe we should, uh, go inside.

792
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:03,000
Or maybe we shouldn't.
