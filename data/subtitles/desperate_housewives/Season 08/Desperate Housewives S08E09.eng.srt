1
00:00:00,178 --> 00:00:02,550
<i>Previously on...</i>

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,412
<i>Renee confronted Lynette.</i>

3
00:00:04,413 --> 00:00:07,656
Look, you and Tom tried to
make it work, and you couldn't.

4
00:00:07,657 --> 00:00:09,092
Now he's moved on.

5
00:00:09,257 --> 00:00:12,093
<i>Carlos agreed to go into rehab.</i>

6
00:00:12,094 --> 00:00:14,816
I know a great place. I can call tomorrow.

7
00:00:14,825 --> 00:00:17,070
<i>Susan's secret work of art...</i>

8
00:00:17,071 --> 00:00:18,921
No one can see these!

9
00:00:18,922 --> 00:00:21,411
<i>Fueled the detective's suspicions...</i>

10
00:00:21,412 --> 00:00:24,352
All I see is four women that killed a guy

11
00:00:24,353 --> 00:00:25,585
with a candlestick

12
00:00:25,586 --> 00:00:27,450
and dumped his body in the woods.

13
00:00:27,451 --> 00:00:30,243
<i>And drove a wedge between friends.</i>

14
00:00:30,244 --> 00:00:31,953
More secrets?

15
00:00:31,962 --> 00:00:34,763
- What did you think you were doing?
- I was protecting you!

16
00:00:34,764 --> 00:00:36,338
Yeah, well, great job.

17
00:00:43,871 --> 00:00:47,085
<i>Whenever Bree Van De
Kamp was feeling low...</i>

18
00:00:48,303 --> 00:00:51,627
<i>she found solace in the act of baking.</i>

19
00:00:54,324 --> 00:00:56,743
<i>When her first husband passed away,</i>

20
00:00:57,011 --> 00:00:59,002
<i>she made coffee cake.</i>

21
00:01:00,818 --> 00:01:03,279
<i>When her second husband went to jail,</i>

22
00:01:03,443 --> 00:01:05,592
<i>she made sugar cookies.</i>

23
00:01:07,617 --> 00:01:10,779
<i>And when her teenage
daughter got pregnant,</i>

24
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,164
<i>she made crÃ¨me brÃ»lée.</i>

25
00:01:14,156 --> 00:01:17,569
<i>So when Bree's best friends
stopped speaking to her,</i>

26
00:01:17,823 --> 00:01:21,000
<i>she hoped that her warm cherry scones</i>

27
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:24,962
<i>might thaw their chilly relationship.</i>

28
00:01:28,398 --> 00:01:29,552
Susan.

29
00:01:42,392 --> 00:01:43,865
Hey, sweetie. Is your mom home?

30
00:01:43,866 --> 00:01:47,096
Uh, no. She's at... church.

31
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,427
On a thursday?

32
00:01:49,741 --> 00:01:51,660
She told you to say that, didn't she?

33
00:01:51,661 --> 00:01:52,942
Only if it was you.

34
00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:53,996
If it was the priest,

35
00:01:53,997 --> 00:01:56,675
I'm supposed to say
she's reading to the blind.

36
00:02:05,178 --> 00:02:06,917
Will you stop pounding?

37
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:09,380
I just put Paige down.

38
00:02:10,027 --> 00:02:12,239
I'm sorry, but no one will talk to me.

39
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,807
Really? I wonder why that is.

40
00:02:14,808 --> 00:02:16,160
Look, I have made a mess of things,

41
00:02:16,161 --> 00:02:18,430
but I want to make it up to you all.

44
00:02:23,754 --> 00:02:25,322
a way to begin the conversation.

45
00:02:25,323 --> 00:02:26,762
I have nothing to discuss with you,

46
00:02:26,763 --> 00:02:29,377
not after the way you and Gaby lied to me.

47
00:02:29,574 --> 00:02:30,550
Lynette, please understand.

48
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:33,215
I was only trying to protect you,
all of you.

49
00:02:33,216 --> 00:02:35,977
No! You were trying to control us

50
00:02:35,978 --> 00:02:38,882
the way you try and control everything.

51
00:02:38,883 --> 00:02:40,030
That's not fair.

52
00:02:40,031 --> 00:02:42,410
You told us that as long
as we trusted each other

53
00:02:42,411 --> 00:02:45,063
and stuck together,
everything would be fine.

54
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:47,998
It will be. As long as
we have our friendship,

55
00:02:47,999 --> 00:02:49,689
they can't do anything to us.

56
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:52,516
Don't you get it? There is no us.

57
00:02:52,517 --> 00:02:55,071
There is no friendship. Not anymore.

58
00:02:55,489 --> 00:02:56,891
You're on your own.

59
00:02:58,394 --> 00:02:59,577
We all are.

60
00:03:04,437 --> 00:03:08,716
<i>Yes, Bree had always
taken comfort in baking.</i>

61
00:03:10,394 --> 00:03:12,612
<i>But when baking failed her,</i>

62
00:03:14,012 --> 00:03:17,260
<i>she took comfort in something else.</i>

63
00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:33,383
<i>In a place as peaceful as Wisteria lane,</i>

64
00:03:33,384 --> 00:03:37,060
<i>the smallest crime can prompt
a call to the police...</i>

65
00:03:38,533 --> 00:03:41,853
<i>When a neighborhood kid
makes a reckless mistake...</i>

66
00:03:44,293 --> 00:03:47,208
<i>when children need to
be taught a lesson...</i>

67
00:03:49,918 --> 00:03:53,243
<i>when the teenagers next door start a band.</i>

68
00:03:56,228 --> 00:03:58,560
<i>Yes, the women of Wisteria lane</i>

69
00:03:58,561 --> 00:04:00,894
<i>were used to calling the police.</i>

70
00:04:00,955 --> 00:04:06,290
<i>What they weren't used to was
having the police... call them.</i>

71
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:08,703
So... what's going on?

72
00:04:08,704 --> 00:04:09,786
Not sure.

73
00:04:10,424 --> 00:04:12,079
No one's talked to us yet.

74
00:04:12,722 --> 00:04:14,319
Do you think we need a lawyer?

75
00:04:14,357 --> 00:04:17,194
I don't know. Maybe Susan
can paint one for us.

76
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:20,175
Lawyers won't be necessary, ladies.

77
00:04:20,543 --> 00:04:22,160
This is not an official investigation.

78
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:25,795
It's just a... it's just a casual
conversation among friends.

79
00:04:25,796 --> 00:04:27,001
But if you want to bring lawyers into it,

80
00:04:27,002 --> 00:04:29,807
I can open a case file,
take your fingerprints.

81
00:04:29,808 --> 00:04:32,654
No. No. We like the friend thing.

82
00:04:32,964 --> 00:04:37,891
Great. So the first friend
I'd like to talk to is... Susan.

83
00:04:41,716 --> 00:04:42,955
Try my coffee.

84
00:04:45,338 --> 00:04:47,666
The guys are always
complimenting me on it.

85
00:04:48,016 --> 00:04:51,144
Thanks. I'm trying to
cut down on caffeine.

86
00:04:51,849 --> 00:04:53,273
Gets you all jittery and nervous?

87
00:04:53,274 --> 00:04:54,738
Yeah. I hate that.

88
00:04:54,739 --> 00:04:56,478
So you feeling jittery
and nervous right now?

89
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:57,477
What?

90
00:04:57,566 --> 00:04:59,650
N-no. Absolutely not.

91
00:05:06,415 --> 00:05:07,755
Uh, yum.

92
00:05:07,768 --> 00:05:09,065
My compliments.

93
00:05:14,157 --> 00:05:15,585
Why'd you paint this?

94
00:05:18,747 --> 00:05:20,048
Uh, why?

95
00:05:20,049 --> 00:05:22,020
It's... hard to say

96
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:25,487
why artists... paint what they do.

97
00:05:26,551 --> 00:05:30,459
Gosh, that probably sounded so... artsy.

98
00:05:30,867 --> 00:05:32,248
No, not really.

99
00:05:32,724 --> 00:05:34,611
I would imagine it's even possible

100
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:39,101
that the artist herself doesn't
really know why she did it.

101
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:42,738
Sometimes you say to yourself...

102
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:46,143
"Where the heck did that come from?"

103
00:05:46,144 --> 00:05:47,982
"Maybe I shouldn't have eaten"

104
00:05:47,983 --> 00:05:50,553
"that pepperoni pizza before bed."

105
00:05:52,476 --> 00:05:54,249
Or maybe you say to yourself,

106
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:57,071
"I feel so guilty about what I did."

107
00:06:00,008 --> 00:06:01,622
I-I-I don't...

108
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:04,803
I mean, who... who is that?

109
00:06:04,804 --> 00:06:06,272
The guy in your painting.

110
00:06:06,481 --> 00:06:07,946
The one in the grave.

111
00:06:08,611 --> 00:06:09,639
No.

112
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:11,201
Uh, uh, no.

113
00:06:11,629 --> 00:06:14,059
That came from my imagination.

114
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,732
Bull. It's him.

115
00:06:15,733 --> 00:06:17,815
Ramon Sanchez.

116
00:06:17,937 --> 00:06:20,143
A missing person from Oklahoma.

117
00:06:21,754 --> 00:06:23,483
I don't know anything about that.

118
00:06:23,524 --> 00:06:25,670
That isn't a painting, Susan.

119
00:06:26,277 --> 00:06:28,522
It's a guilty conscience
trying to find peace,

120
00:06:28,523 --> 00:06:30,230
but it never will, ever...

121
00:06:30,775 --> 00:06:32,661
until you tell the truth.

122
00:06:36,475 --> 00:06:38,538
So you've never seen this guy before?

123
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:39,763
You already asked me that,

124
00:06:39,764 --> 00:06:42,017
and I told you. No.

125
00:06:42,018 --> 00:06:44,432
You know something, Lynette?
You'd have made a good cop.

126
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:48,398
You know how to stay cool,
keep your emotions in check.

127
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,950
Listen to me.

128
00:06:53,087 --> 00:06:55,186
You women are good people. I know that.

129
00:06:55,709 --> 00:06:58,197
But you're obviously
covering something up.

130
00:06:58,198 --> 00:07:00,065
Now forget about me being a cop, okay?

131
00:07:00,066 --> 00:07:01,391
Let me tell you something as a friend.

132
00:07:01,392 --> 00:07:03,322
A jury will forgive
a lot when they understand

133
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:04,867
why something happened.

134
00:07:04,868 --> 00:07:08,091
But first, you have to stop lying.

135
00:07:08,137 --> 00:07:09,509
I'm not lying.

136
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,187
How much more of a toll

137
00:07:13,188 --> 00:07:15,347
are you gonna let this thing take on you?

138
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:16,262
What does that mean?

139
00:07:16,263 --> 00:07:19,337
It means that whatever it is you've done,

140
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:22,465
it's clearly the reason
your husband walked out on you.

141
00:07:25,274 --> 00:07:26,326
Sorry.

142
00:07:26,616 --> 00:07:28,545
But you said to forget you were a cop.

143
00:07:30,381 --> 00:07:32,149
Huh. Look at that.

144
00:07:32,988 --> 00:07:35,233
What happened to keeping your cool?

145
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:42,001
Recognize him?

146
00:07:42,299 --> 00:07:43,376
Sorry.

147
00:07:44,203 --> 00:07:46,860
You wanna look at it for
two seconds before you answer?

148
00:07:49,353 --> 00:07:50,565
I got nothing.

149
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,373
Can I go?

150
00:07:51,374 --> 00:07:53,238
He's a person, Gaby.

151
00:07:53,285 --> 00:07:54,528
He has two kids,

152
00:07:54,529 --> 00:07:56,056
not much older than yours.

153
00:07:56,057 --> 00:07:58,770
Two girls, who may never
see their daddy again.

154
00:08:03,211 --> 00:08:04,600
I don't know him.

155
00:08:04,601 --> 00:08:07,249
Now may I leave?
I have a lot of things to do.

156
00:08:08,534 --> 00:08:09,828
Oh, yeah? Like what?

157
00:08:10,851 --> 00:08:12,608
Visiting your husband in rehab?

158
00:08:13,621 --> 00:08:14,374
I heard about his drinking.

159
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:15,573
I'm sorry.

160
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,054
Yeah. Well, the good news is

161
00:08:19,055 --> 00:08:21,170
it looks like we nipped it in the bud.

162
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,221
Oh, it's a new problem?

163
00:08:23,771 --> 00:08:24,674
Yeah. Why?

164
00:08:24,675 --> 00:08:25,709
Usually there's a trigger

165
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:28,376
when somebody starts abusing
alcohol out of the blue.

166
00:08:29,288 --> 00:08:31,915
Anything come to mind? Anything stressful?

167
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:35,939
He...

168
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,055
he had an affair.

169
00:08:38,056 --> 00:08:39,318
Carlos?

170
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,715
That's hard to believe.

171
00:08:41,716 --> 00:08:44,375
I know, right? I mean,
who would cheat on this?

172
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,475
I meant because he seems
like such a good man.

173
00:08:48,151 --> 00:08:51,470
Well, he's not. He's a cad,
a philandering S.O.B.,

174
00:08:51,471 --> 00:08:52,981
but I love him.

175
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,574
So if I go there tomorrow

176
00:08:55,575 --> 00:08:58,631
and ask Carlos that same question...

177
00:08:59,962 --> 00:09:01,556
he'd give me the same answer?

178
00:09:02,984 --> 00:09:04,102
You bet.

179
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:05,379
Great.

180
00:09:06,005 --> 00:09:07,449
I might just do that.

181
00:09:15,404 --> 00:09:17,152
I'll have another, please.

182
00:09:18,253 --> 00:09:19,469
Okay.

183
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:23,850
You got a friend who can drive you home?

184
00:09:25,701 --> 00:09:26,330
No.

185
00:09:26,331 --> 00:09:28,875
Turns out I'm friendless at the moment.

186
00:09:29,117 --> 00:09:31,617
But don't worry. I'll take a taxi.

187
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:44,525
You ladies sound like you're having fun!

188
00:09:44,582 --> 00:09:46,083
What's the occasion?

189
00:09:46,084 --> 00:09:47,849
Just, you know, girls' night out.

190
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:50,042
Left the kids and husbands at home.

191
00:09:50,043 --> 00:09:51,468
Whoo-hoo! I'll drink to that.

192
00:09:51,469 --> 00:09:52,045
Yeah.

193
00:09:52,046 --> 00:09:53,305
Amen to that, sister.

194
00:09:53,306 --> 00:09:55,971
I mean, who needs families
when we've got girlfriends?

195
00:09:55,972 --> 00:09:57,080
Am I right?

196
00:09:58,652 --> 00:10:00,586
I'm sorry. Who are you?

197
00:10:00,587 --> 00:10:03,010
Oh, where are my manners?

198
00:10:03,011 --> 00:10:04,394
Bree Van De Kamp.

199
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,904
I heard you all carrying on, and, well,

200
00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:09,638
really, I've been feeling
a little disconnected lately,

201
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:12,334
and I thought, "Bree,
a little human contact is"

202
00:10:12,335 --> 00:10:14,094
"just what you need."

203
00:10:14,241 --> 00:10:16,870
Uh, yeah, Kelly just had a baby,

204
00:10:16,871 --> 00:10:20,052
and we haven't seen each other
for a while, so we were hoping...

205
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:24,198
A baby! Oh, that's wonderful.
Well, we need to celebrate.

206
00:10:24,199 --> 00:10:25,770
Bottle of champagne!

207
00:10:25,771 --> 00:10:26,966
It's on me.

208
00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:30,720
So how do we all know each other?

209
00:10:31,317 --> 00:10:33,852
Well, these two I know from college,

210
00:10:33,853 --> 00:10:38,385
and you I know from randomly
sitting down at our table.

211
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:43,473
God, I miss this.

212
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,977
And then one day,

213
00:10:47,978 --> 00:10:51,238
you wake up and you realize
you've got nothing.

214
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,647
Nothing.

215
00:10:52,787 --> 00:10:54,948
Your children abandon you.

216
00:10:55,018 --> 00:10:56,212
Even the gay one.

217
00:10:56,213 --> 00:10:57,714
I mean, aren't gay men

218
00:10:57,715 --> 00:11:00,230
supposed to be obsessed
with their mothers?

219
00:11:00,342 --> 00:11:03,022
As far as relationships go, forget it.

220
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:04,412
Two of them left me.

221
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:06,016
Three of them are dead.

222
00:11:06,315 --> 00:11:09,862
And all of this I could bear as
long as I had my girlfriends.

223
00:11:09,863 --> 00:11:12,159
But now they've abandoned me, too.

224
00:11:13,225 --> 00:11:15,214
Everything I touch...

225
00:11:16,216 --> 00:11:17,776
everything I love...

226
00:11:20,093 --> 00:11:23,192
Well, on that note,
I think I'll call it a night.

227
00:11:23,193 --> 00:11:23,981
Same here.

228
00:11:23,982 --> 00:11:25,931
Wait. It's barely midnight...

229
00:11:25,932 --> 00:11:28,864
Awfully early for four
single gals like us.

230
00:11:28,865 --> 00:11:30,823
We're all married.

231
00:11:30,897 --> 00:11:32,171
You don't have to rub it in, Lynette.

232
00:11:32,172 --> 00:11:34,936
Stop calling me Lynette.
It's really creeping me out.

233
00:11:34,937 --> 00:11:37,165
Wait. I've got an idea.

234
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,223
Why don't you all come back to my place

235
00:11:39,224 --> 00:11:41,074
and we can have a sleepover?

236
00:11:41,174 --> 00:11:42,097
Good night.

237
00:11:42,098 --> 00:11:44,325
No. No, please... please come home with me.

238
00:11:44,326 --> 00:11:47,876
I-I have a really big house
with lots of empty rooms and...

239
00:11:52,621 --> 00:11:54,643
Okay, lady. You want me
to call you your cab yet?

240
00:11:54,644 --> 00:11:55,740
No.

241
00:11:57,058 --> 00:11:59,429
I'm just gonna finish Lynette's champagne.

242
00:12:11,247 --> 00:12:12,300
Ben.

243
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:13,721
Hello.

244
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,121
How you feeling?

245
00:12:15,762 --> 00:12:18,141
Fine. Why do you ask?

246
00:12:18,262 --> 00:12:20,267
You don't remember last night, do you?

247
00:12:20,857 --> 00:12:22,165
Of course I do.

248
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,938
Really? What do you remember?

249
00:12:24,941 --> 00:12:27,609
I went out to dinner
with a few girlfriends,

250
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,142
came home, and went to bed.

251
00:12:29,143 --> 00:12:30,818
Uh, close.

252
00:12:31,522 --> 00:12:33,685
You knocked on my door
at 2:00 in the morning

253
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:34,973
to borrow money,

254
00:12:35,136 --> 00:12:36,394
'cause the cab driver wouldn't take

255
00:12:36,395 --> 00:12:38,978
the fried zucchini you had in your purse.

256
00:12:39,165 --> 00:12:41,752
Then you cursed at me for
not making you pancakes

257
00:12:41,753 --> 00:12:44,371
before you stumbled back to your house.

258
00:12:53,193 --> 00:12:54,553
How long you been off the wagon?

259
00:12:54,554 --> 00:12:55,761
A few days.

260
00:12:56,353 --> 00:12:58,609
I'd appreciate it
if you wouldn't tell anyone.

261
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:01,093
It's just a temporary relapse.

262
00:13:01,094 --> 00:13:02,751
I'll get it under control.

263
00:13:03,411 --> 00:13:04,452
Look...

264
00:13:05,093 --> 00:13:08,101
isolating yourself is only
gonna make matters worse.

265
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,861
You got a great group of friends.

266
00:13:11,608 --> 00:13:13,021
Reach out to them.

267
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:14,193
I can't.

268
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,416
We're not on speaking terms right now.

269
00:13:16,578 --> 00:13:18,364
Well, I'm sure you can fix that.

270
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:19,678
I tried.

271
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,360
But they all seem to hate me.

272
00:13:22,805 --> 00:13:24,867
Well, my recommendation?

273
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,966
Start with the one
who hates you the least.

274
00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:37,253
Oh. Not ready for that.

275
00:13:38,422 --> 00:13:39,939
It's a beautiful day.

276
00:13:40,206 --> 00:13:43,425
I'd hate for you to waste
another one with a hangover.

277
00:13:44,518 --> 00:13:45,787
Thank you, Ben.

278
00:13:51,822 --> 00:13:52,950
See ya.

279
00:14:01,835 --> 00:14:04,483
I know Chuck could tell I was lying.

280
00:14:04,484 --> 00:14:06,951
I always do that thing when I lie.

281
00:14:06,952 --> 00:14:08,725
Wh-what thing?

282
00:14:08,726 --> 00:14:10,322
Oh, like I'm gonna tell you.

283
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:14,087
You have no idea how terrifying it was.

284
00:14:14,088 --> 00:14:17,163
Look, have a drink. It'll calm you down.

285
00:14:17,164 --> 00:14:18,657
I don't want a drink.

286
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,733
- Really?
- Of course I want a drink.

287
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:23,276
See? I'm a terrible liar.

288
00:14:24,383 --> 00:14:27,237
Look, if Chuck had something
concrete, we'd know.

289
00:14:27,683 --> 00:14:29,179
I'm sure he's just fishing.

290
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:31,585
He is not gonna let up.

291
00:14:31,586 --> 00:14:34,256
He is just waiting till I crack.

292
00:14:34,257 --> 00:14:37,191
Honey, you're panicking over nothing.
The body's gone.

293
00:14:37,192 --> 00:14:39,038
Chuck doesn't have a case without it.

294
00:14:39,623 --> 00:14:42,638
No, the only way this thing
blows up is if somebody talks.

295
00:14:43,306 --> 00:14:44,796
Are you not listening to me?

296
00:14:44,797 --> 00:14:46,285
I talk. Me.

297
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:49,311
I'm the one who's gonna send us away.

298
00:14:50,778 --> 00:14:52,314
We need to get out of town,

299
00:14:52,315 --> 00:14:53,634
just for a few weeks,

300
00:14:53,635 --> 00:14:57,014
until Chuck finds someone
else to focus on.

301
00:14:57,498 --> 00:14:59,822
Not only would that look
incredibly suspicious,

302
00:15:00,034 --> 00:15:02,259
we don't have the kind of money
to do something like that.

303
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,889
Okay. Money.

304
00:15:04,035 --> 00:15:05,215
We need money.

305
00:15:05,761 --> 00:15:07,021
We can have a garage sale.

306
00:15:07,022 --> 00:15:09,406
Grab some chairs. I'll put up some flyers.

307
00:15:09,648 --> 00:15:10,886
Trust me.

308
00:15:11,093 --> 00:15:12,333
We're gonna stay here,

309
00:15:12,675 --> 00:15:15,209
and everything is gonna be fine.

310
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,380
Wow.

311
00:15:18,554 --> 00:15:20,747
You're an even worse liar than I am.

312
00:15:26,846 --> 00:15:28,279
Oh. Hello.

313
00:15:28,444 --> 00:15:30,440
Excuse me. Hello?

314
00:15:30,441 --> 00:15:32,825
Someone is never gonna finish "The help."

315
00:15:33,026 --> 00:15:33,859
What can I do for you?

316
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,296
I need to speak with my husband,
Carlos Solis.

317
00:15:36,297 --> 00:15:38,043
Is it an emergency?

318
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:40,964
No. I just need to tell him something.

319
00:15:41,364 --> 00:15:42,595
Then I can't allow you.

320
00:15:42,596 --> 00:15:45,062
Mr. Solis is still on restricted access.

321
00:15:45,063 --> 00:15:45,903
What does that mean?

322
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:48,002
Uh, first week after admission,
no visitors,

323
00:15:48,003 --> 00:15:49,931
cell phones, or e-mails. No distractions.

324
00:15:49,932 --> 00:15:52,125
We only want our patients
to focus on getting better.

325
00:15:52,126 --> 00:15:54,584
Okay, but I really need to talk to him.

326
00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:56,003
I'm sorry.

327
00:15:56,004 --> 00:15:57,236
Those are the rules.

328
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,119
Well, rules are made to be broken.

329
00:16:03,388 --> 00:16:06,268
I'm sure there's a
"No boobs on the counter" rule, too.

330
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,929
Seriously?

331
00:16:10,431 --> 00:16:11,678
Male nurse.

332
00:16:13,925 --> 00:16:15,067
Right.

333
00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:17,637
You can come back on Tuesday.

334
00:16:20,244 --> 00:16:21,722
- It's all my fault!
- It wasn't your fault.

335
00:16:21,723 --> 00:16:23,102
- I should've seen the signs.
- It was mine. I was never around.

336
00:16:23,103 --> 00:16:24,452
- Kid didn't have a role model.
- We're getting you help, Jimmy.

337
00:16:24,453 --> 00:16:26,429
- They're gonna take care of you here.
- I don't need this place.

338
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:29,729
- I told you. I don't have a problem.
- Manzani. We called.

339
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:31,116
Admissions is right through that door.

340
00:16:31,117 --> 00:16:33,966
Thank you. Come on.
It's gonna be all right.

341
00:16:36,777 --> 00:16:38,698
We should've seen this coming.

342
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,374
Jimmy, we're only doing
this because we love you.

343
00:16:44,457 --> 00:16:47,634
Such a tragedy. So much potential.

344
00:16:48,547 --> 00:16:49,775
All right, gotta go.

345
00:16:52,381 --> 00:16:53,580
Excuse me.

346
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:55,761
Where are you supposed to be?

347
00:16:56,021 --> 00:16:58,695
Oh, uh, I'm with them... the Manzinis.

348
00:16:58,696 --> 00:16:59,560
If you're with the family,

349
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:01,277
you need to stay for group counseling.

350
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:03,448
Oh, I don't think
I have much to contribute.

351
00:17:03,449 --> 00:17:05,150
It's vital.

352
00:17:05,151 --> 00:17:06,306
This way.

353
00:17:10,345 --> 00:17:11,628
Come on, Tom.

354
00:17:12,112 --> 00:17:13,487
I know you're there.

355
00:17:16,534 --> 00:17:17,695
Fine. I'll get in another way

356
00:17:17,696 --> 00:17:19,869
and pound on your door until you open up.

357
00:17:20,892 --> 00:17:21,549
Yes?

358
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,654
Hola.

359
00:17:22,655 --> 00:17:24,627
My name is Maria.

360
00:17:24,654 --> 00:17:27,629
I forgot the keys to Mr. Tom's casa.

361
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,636
Could you let me in, por favor?

362
00:17:29,637 --> 00:17:32,692
There's no Mr. Tom here.
You have the wrong apartment.

363
00:17:32,693 --> 00:17:33,858
No.

364
00:17:33,859 --> 00:17:38,094
I am doing the cleaning for Mr. Tom.

365
00:17:38,095 --> 00:17:41,681
Wow. Impersonating a maid stereotype.

366
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:42,848
Pathetic much?

367
00:17:42,849 --> 00:17:44,448
Oh, Chloe, look,

368
00:17:44,449 --> 00:17:46,836
I know your mother and my
husband are leaving for Paris.

369
00:17:46,837 --> 00:17:48,723
I just need to talk to
Tom for five minutes

370
00:17:48,724 --> 00:17:50,192
before they head to the airport.

371
00:17:50,193 --> 00:17:51,739
They left an hour ago.

372
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,953
Who's there?

373
00:17:53,109 --> 00:17:54,898
I got it, Ms. Schoenfield.

374
00:17:54,899 --> 00:17:56,438
This is Ms. Schoenfield.

375
00:17:56,439 --> 00:17:57,421
Do you know what flight they're taking?

376
00:17:57,422 --> 00:17:59,246
It's really important I talk with Tom.

377
00:17:59,247 --> 00:18:00,857
He's not picking up his phone.

378
00:18:00,858 --> 00:18:02,962
Jeez, stalk much?

379
00:18:03,091 --> 00:18:05,528
Come on. Come on. I'm not a stalker.

380
00:18:05,529 --> 00:18:08,833
Seriously? My mom told me
you were hiding under his bed

381
00:18:08,834 --> 00:18:10,238
while they were in it.

382
00:18:10,239 --> 00:18:11,821
So I'm certainly not going to help you

383
00:18:11,822 --> 00:18:13,225
sabotage her trip to Paris.

384
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:16,311
Listen to me. Something
happened yesterday.

385
00:18:16,312 --> 00:18:19,272
And I can't go into it,
but Tom needs to be here...

386
00:18:19,273 --> 00:18:20,798
not for me, for the kids.

387
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,332
Please. Please.

388
00:18:25,668 --> 00:18:26,828
Fine.

389
00:18:26,917 --> 00:18:28,873
I've got their flight
information upstairs.

390
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:30,060
Thank you.

391
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:33,121
It's clear Jimmy feels conflicted

392
00:18:33,122 --> 00:18:35,529
about whether or not he belongs in rehab,

393
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:36,595
but his loved ones...

394
00:18:36,596 --> 00:18:38,240
all of you in this room...

395
00:18:38,241 --> 00:18:40,796
are here because you care
deeply about helping him.

396
00:18:40,797 --> 00:18:42,653
So let's start by sharing with Jimmy

397
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:46,368
the ways his drinking
has impacted your lives.

398
00:18:46,369 --> 00:18:48,695
Mrs. Manzani, go ahead.

399
00:18:48,944 --> 00:18:50,661
Well, actually, can I go first?

400
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:52,819
I have somewhere I need to be.

401
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:56,914
Who are you?

402
00:18:57,771 --> 00:18:59,200
I thought you worked here.

403
00:18:59,201 --> 00:19:01,050
No. No. No. I am...

404
00:19:01,789 --> 00:19:02,829
his girlfriend.

405
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:05,719
Ex-girlfriend, you know,
since all the problems started.

406
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,018
Girlfriend?

407
00:19:08,017 --> 00:19:09,801
Another thing you didn't tell us about.

408
00:19:09,802 --> 00:19:11,461
She's not my girlfriend.

409
00:19:11,537 --> 00:19:13,097
I never seen her before.

410
00:19:17,722 --> 00:19:19,470
Yeah. That's the problem right there.

411
00:19:19,471 --> 00:19:21,142
You know, how can you have a relationship

412
00:19:21,143 --> 00:19:23,690
when your boyfriend drinks and
doesn't even remember you?

413
00:19:23,691 --> 00:19:25,858
Why are you wearing a wedding ring?

414
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,365
Oh...

415
00:19:28,366 --> 00:19:29,744
'cause I moved on.

416
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,292
That's right, Jimmy. You had to hear it.

417
00:19:31,293 --> 00:19:33,666
I seriously had you for a girlfriend?

418
00:19:34,509 --> 00:19:36,283
You are smoking hot.

419
00:19:36,569 --> 00:19:37,705
Yeah, I am.

420
00:19:37,706 --> 00:19:40,067
Oh, my god. I do have a problem.

421
00:19:40,564 --> 00:19:43,142
I was with someone like you.
I don't even remember it.

422
00:19:43,533 --> 00:19:44,903
Mom, pop,

423
00:19:45,528 --> 00:19:46,939
I want to get better.

424
00:19:47,612 --> 00:19:48,421
Oh, Jimmy!

425
00:19:48,422 --> 00:19:50,433
That's the spirit, Jimmy!

426
00:19:50,848 --> 00:19:53,338
Now there's a lot of people
in here just like you

427
00:19:53,339 --> 00:19:54,765
who can help you,

428
00:19:54,929 --> 00:19:57,209
like, uh, like Jason Hurwitz

429
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:00,708
and Peter Morton and
Carlos Solis, room 247.

430
00:20:00,709 --> 00:20:02,198
Okay. Good luck.

431
00:20:11,124 --> 00:20:12,880
Gaby, what are you doing here?

432
00:20:13,389 --> 00:20:14,316
Are the kids okay?

433
00:20:14,317 --> 00:20:16,570
Yeah, the kids are fine.
I just needed to talk to you.

434
00:20:16,996 --> 00:20:18,936
What's this? You don't
lift a finger at home,

435
00:20:18,937 --> 00:20:20,109
but here you vacuum?

436
00:20:20,235 --> 00:20:21,932
This is my group task.

437
00:20:21,933 --> 00:20:24,228
Recovery here is based
on two core principles...

438
00:20:24,229 --> 00:20:26,648
responsibility and total honesty.

439
00:20:26,723 --> 00:20:27,848
Okay. Great.

440
00:20:27,928 --> 00:20:29,869
Come in here. I need to
talk to you about a lie.

441
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:34,469
So when Chuck asks what
made you start drinking...

442
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:35,946
and I'm guessing he will...

443
00:20:36,075 --> 00:20:37,446
say you cheated on me.

444
00:20:37,722 --> 00:20:39,534
- With who?
- It doesn't matter.

445
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,791
Someone ugly. Don't go overboard.

446
00:20:42,137 --> 00:20:43,285
So...

447
00:20:43,329 --> 00:20:46,022
Chuck saw Susan's paintings,
he's questioned each of you,

448
00:20:46,023 --> 00:20:48,574
and you think this one lie
is going to throw him off?

449
00:20:48,575 --> 00:20:49,709
He's got nothing else.

450
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,410
Gaby, let me tell you
something about cops.

451
00:20:51,582 --> 00:20:55,603
What you think he knows is about
one-tenth of what he does know.

452
00:20:57,515 --> 00:20:58,881
We have got to stop this guy.

453
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:02,294
God, this is a hell of a time
for me to be stuck in here.

454
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:04,659
No, honey. Hey, hey,
it's gonna be fine, okay?

455
00:21:04,991 --> 00:21:06,428
You just focus on getting better.

456
00:21:08,296 --> 00:21:09,335
I'll try.

457
00:21:09,336 --> 00:21:12,769
Okay, well, I should get out
of here before they find me.

458
00:21:13,516 --> 00:21:14,887
Tell the girls I miss 'em?

459
00:21:15,658 --> 00:21:16,822
They miss you, too.

460
00:21:23,777 --> 00:21:26,248
Mr. Bergman, hi. Uh, remember me?

461
00:21:26,249 --> 00:21:30,303
Remember you? Susan Delfino,
you sold five paintings

462
00:21:30,304 --> 00:21:32,887
20 minutes into your first art show.

463
00:21:32,888 --> 00:21:34,814
You are my prodigy.

464
00:21:34,815 --> 00:21:37,486
Are you here to revel in your glory?

465
00:21:37,825 --> 00:21:40,109
Actually, no, uh, see, I'm...

466
00:21:41,185 --> 00:21:43,157
uh, kind of in a rough spot right now.

467
00:21:43,489 --> 00:21:46,936
Oh, dear. You seem a bit agitated.

468
00:21:47,299 --> 00:21:49,796
You're not considering jumping
off a bridge, are you?

469
00:21:49,999 --> 00:21:52,342
But if you are,
could you please leave behind

470
00:21:52,343 --> 00:21:55,610
a large body of work for me to sell?

471
00:21:56,174 --> 00:21:58,242
No. Uh, it's just, um...

472
00:22:00,198 --> 00:22:03,539
I need the money from
my paintings, please.

473
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:06,244
Oh. I just started on the paperwork.

474
00:22:06,536 --> 00:22:09,321
You should receive a check in uh,
four to six weeks.

475
00:22:09,322 --> 00:22:12,166
Oh, no, no, no. I-I need it now.

476
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:14,279
I, um...

477
00:22:15,802 --> 00:22:17,830
Have to get out of town for a while.

478
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:22,054
My housewife just got
even more interesting.

479
00:22:22,363 --> 00:22:23,709
Are you a junkie?

480
00:22:24,058 --> 00:22:24,848
Gambler?

481
00:22:24,849 --> 00:22:27,150
Are you on the run from the mob?

482
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:29,206
I can't tell you what it is.

483
00:22:30,121 --> 00:22:31,432
I just really need that money.

484
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,126
Well, here's the thing...

485
00:22:33,127 --> 00:22:37,491
um, I am having a teensy
bit of a cash-flow problem.

486
00:22:37,492 --> 00:22:39,259
But I assure you,

487
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,427
eight to ten weeks...

488
00:22:40,428 --> 00:22:42,345
I thought you said four to six.

489
00:22:42,346 --> 00:22:44,207
Okay, not so teensy.

490
00:22:44,594 --> 00:22:48,081
Mr. Bergman, I wouldn't ask
if it wasn't really important.

491
00:22:48,082 --> 00:22:50,212
No, I will see what I can do,

492
00:22:50,213 --> 00:22:51,841
but no promises...

493
00:22:52,873 --> 00:22:55,517
my mysterious little housewife.

494
00:23:01,045 --> 00:23:02,126
That's nice.

495
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:04,146
What's that for?

496
00:23:04,285 --> 00:23:07,121
Oh, you were right.
A hug should be for something,

497
00:23:07,517 --> 00:23:10,165
like the one I saw you
giving Bree this morning.

498
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:11,156
What was that for?

499
00:23:11,157 --> 00:23:12,395
Oh, Renee.

500
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:13,753
That was nothing.

501
00:23:13,896 --> 00:23:16,494
Oh, so you're just going
door-to-door giving hugs?

502
00:23:16,733 --> 00:23:18,179
What, is that an australian thing?

503
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:21,585
Look, there is nothing
between me and Bree.

504
00:23:22,445 --> 00:23:24,497
She's just going through
something right now.

505
00:23:25,099 --> 00:23:26,943
I was a shoulder to cry on.

506
00:23:28,215 --> 00:23:31,734
Oh, as long as that shoulder
isn't a gateway body part.

507
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:37,536
Oh, I'm sorry to interrupt.
I only need a minute.

508
00:23:38,302 --> 00:23:39,378
I just have to ask you

509
00:23:39,379 --> 00:23:41,111
a couple questions about your girlfriend.

510
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:43,423
So ask me.

511
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:44,988
I'm standing right here.

512
00:23:45,391 --> 00:23:46,507
Not you. Bree.

513
00:23:48,782 --> 00:23:49,755
Funny.

514
00:23:50,006 --> 00:23:52,754
We were just talking about
your girlfriend Bree.

515
00:23:53,078 --> 00:23:54,178
Good-bye.

516
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:56,067
Renee...

517
00:23:58,356 --> 00:23:59,937
Why the hell would you do that for?

518
00:24:00,269 --> 00:24:01,048
I don't know.

519
00:24:01,049 --> 00:24:03,037
Just trying to make your life miserable.

520
00:24:03,449 --> 00:24:04,453
Oh, and I got more.

521
00:24:04,856 --> 00:24:06,259
I'm tracking down a missing person.

522
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,400
It turns out his last phone signal

523
00:24:08,787 --> 00:24:11,201
came from somewhere on
your construction site.

524
00:24:11,588 --> 00:24:13,065
I don't know anything about that.

525
00:24:13,066 --> 00:24:15,407
Doesn't matter. Still a great
reason to shut you down.

526
00:24:17,293 --> 00:24:18,030
How long?

527
00:24:18,031 --> 00:24:20,226
Two weeks. Maybe a month. I don't know.

528
00:24:20,526 --> 00:24:21,970
Oh, let me guess...

529
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,978
as long as it takes for me
to lose my investment, yeah?

530
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,354
That sounds about right.

531
00:24:29,053 --> 00:24:31,682
You're not getting on that
property without a warrant.

532
00:24:33,886 --> 00:24:35,622
Oh, jeez.

533
00:24:35,623 --> 00:24:37,970
Where would a detective get one of those?

534
00:24:41,197 --> 00:24:42,315
See you Monday.

535
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,225
Oh, my god. This tastes so good.

536
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:56,748
I know. It reminds me of the first time

537
00:24:56,749 --> 00:24:58,745
Lynette and I ever flew first class.

538
00:24:59,141 --> 00:25:00,865
We had been so used to traveling coach...

539
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:02,566
- Tom?
- Yeah?

540
00:25:02,937 --> 00:25:05,150
Please don't take this
the wrong way, but...

541
00:25:06,817 --> 00:25:09,405
you're on a romantic trip
with your girlfriend.

542
00:25:09,672 --> 00:25:11,765
Do you think it could
just stay the two of us?

543
00:25:13,441 --> 00:25:14,541
I'm sorry.

544
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:17,245
Old habits.

545
00:25:17,593 --> 00:25:21,308
That is the last time
you'll hear of Lynette.

546
00:25:24,694 --> 00:25:25,948
To Paris...

547
00:25:26,395 --> 00:25:27,438
ma chérie.

548
00:25:31,194 --> 00:25:33,598
Good. Stay close with that mop.

549
00:25:33,938 --> 00:25:36,573
Flight 502 to Paris will be
boarding in five minutes.

550
00:25:36,574 --> 00:25:38,626
I'm gonna run to the men's room.
It's a long flight,

551
00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:41,544
and airplane bathrooms freak me out.

552
00:25:41,545 --> 00:25:43,565
Well, there goes one fantasy.

553
00:25:53,798 --> 00:25:54,899
Hey, Lynette.

554
00:25:55,768 --> 00:25:57,466
What the hell are you doing here?

555
00:25:57,467 --> 00:25:58,405
I need to talk to you.

556
00:25:58,406 --> 00:25:59,475
I can't believe you.

557
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:01,801
You think I want to chase you
down in an airport men's room?

558
00:26:01,802 --> 00:26:02,937
Now listen to me.

559
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:04,918
I can only breathe through
my mouth for a few minutes.

560
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:06,539
Well, you can save your breath,

561
00:26:07,998 --> 00:26:09,002
'cause I am going...

562
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:13,940
I am going to Paris with Jane,

563
00:26:13,941 --> 00:26:15,955
and I'm sorry if you're
having a hard time with it.

564
00:26:15,956 --> 00:26:18,984
This isn't about you and Jane.
Look. See? Good with it. Okay?

565
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:21,920
Okay, good. Then-then why are you here?

566
00:26:22,152 --> 00:26:26,310
Because you can't go to Paris, not now.

567
00:26:26,311 --> 00:26:27,660
Okay, I'm confused.

568
00:26:28,102 --> 00:26:29,165
You don't care if I go to Paris with Jane,

569
00:26:29,166 --> 00:26:30,765
but you're telling me
I can't go to Paris with Jane.

570
00:26:30,766 --> 00:26:32,311
I'm sorry. I have to tell you something,

571
00:26:32,312 --> 00:26:33,881
but it's just really hard to say...

572
00:26:33,882 --> 00:26:36,414
I'm sorry, but my plane
is boarding. I have to go.

573
00:26:37,135 --> 00:26:38,619
I'm an accessory to murder.

574
00:26:50,157 --> 00:26:51,738
Here. Let me help you with this.

575
00:26:52,101 --> 00:26:53,426
I think you've helped enough.

576
00:26:54,542 --> 00:26:56,962
Gaby, please. I can't stand this anymore.

577
00:26:56,963 --> 00:26:58,338
Can't we talk for a minute?

578
00:26:58,339 --> 00:26:59,108
To be honest,

579
00:26:59,109 --> 00:27:01,370
after what Chuck put me through,
I'm kind of talked out.

580
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:02,850
Wait. What do you mean?

581
00:27:03,173 --> 00:27:05,922
He interrogated us... me,
Lynette, and Susan.

582
00:27:05,923 --> 00:27:08,835
He called us down to the station
and grilled us one by one.

583
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:10,425
Why didn't he call me down there?

584
00:27:10,426 --> 00:27:12,768
Good question, given
this whole thing is about you.

585
00:27:12,918 --> 00:27:14,054
What are you talking about?

586
00:27:14,055 --> 00:27:17,308
Bree, he wants revenge.
He wants to bring you down,

587
00:27:17,309 --> 00:27:19,025
and we're all gonna go down with you.

588
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:20,837
Gaby, please.

589
00:27:20,838 --> 00:27:23,132
I will figure out a way
to make things better.

590
00:27:23,133 --> 00:27:24,404
No, you won't.

591
00:27:24,405 --> 00:27:26,777
This isn't gonna stop
until Chuck is stopped.

592
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,408
Say something.

593
00:27:37,875 --> 00:27:39,162
Why didn't you tell me this?

594
00:27:39,163 --> 00:27:42,570
I wanted to, a hundred times,
but we weren't together anymore,

595
00:27:42,571 --> 00:27:45,143
and it seemed wrong to drag you into it.

596
00:27:45,875 --> 00:27:47,015
Tom?

597
00:27:47,403 --> 00:27:48,574
Plane's boarding.

598
00:27:51,619 --> 00:27:53,362
You've got to be kidding me.

599
00:27:53,363 --> 00:27:56,707
Jane, I'm sorry.
I know what this must look like.

600
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:57,718
Really?

601
00:27:58,819 --> 00:28:01,442
You know what it looks like
to walk into a men's room

602
00:28:01,443 --> 00:28:03,728
and find your boyfriend's
ex chatting him up

603
00:28:03,729 --> 00:28:05,297
before your flight to Paris?

604
00:28:05,298 --> 00:28:06,497
It's not like that.

605
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:09,472
Of course not. I'm the crazy one.

606
00:28:09,473 --> 00:28:12,073
You two rendez-vous-ing
in an airport toilet?

607
00:28:12,074 --> 00:28:14,531
I'm the nut job.
She's hiding under your bed?

608
00:28:14,532 --> 00:28:16,315
Jane's the one who needs to be sedated.

609
00:28:16,316 --> 00:28:20,222
Tom, I really can't deal with
this right now. Can we just go?

610
00:28:29,409 --> 00:28:32,692
You are not doing this to me right now.

611
00:28:34,926 --> 00:28:37,178
We will go at the end of this month.

612
00:28:38,638 --> 00:28:39,722
I promise.

613
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:51,954
Jane. Jane, it's really not Tom's fault.

614
00:28:56,437 --> 00:28:57,417
Tom...

615
00:28:58,365 --> 00:28:59,217
honey...

616
00:28:59,573 --> 00:29:01,721
you know what she's doing, right?

617
00:29:02,109 --> 00:29:03,921
You give in here, now,

618
00:29:04,024 --> 00:29:05,619
it'll never stop.

619
00:29:06,439 --> 00:29:07,972
I am so sorry.

620
00:29:08,272 --> 00:29:09,331
It... but...

621
00:29:10,321 --> 00:29:13,804
- there are extenuating circumstances.
- Okay.

622
00:29:14,208 --> 00:29:15,291
Then tell me.

623
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:17,243
Tell me what they are.

624
00:29:17,647 --> 00:29:19,907
I think I at least deserve that.

625
00:29:30,743 --> 00:29:31,811
Okay.

626
00:29:37,433 --> 00:29:39,020
I'm going to Paris,

627
00:29:39,812 --> 00:29:42,720
and if you want, you can meet me there.

628
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:51,677
I'm so sorry.

629
00:29:51,678 --> 00:29:52,842
Lynette, don't.

630
00:29:54,655 --> 00:29:55,627
Just...

631
00:29:56,021 --> 00:29:57,787
don't talk.

632
00:30:08,942 --> 00:30:11,013
Oh, my god! You brought it.

633
00:30:11,014 --> 00:30:14,714
Now before I give it to you... oh,
well, that never works.

634
00:30:15,126 --> 00:30:16,754
What I was going to say...

635
00:30:17,095 --> 00:30:19,866
I have a little proposition for you.

636
00:30:20,165 --> 00:30:22,577
Oh, calm down. It's not sex.

637
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,233
Dang it.

638
00:30:25,421 --> 00:30:27,584
I believe you have that certain something

639
00:30:27,585 --> 00:30:30,004
that makes a great artist.

640
00:30:30,425 --> 00:30:31,900
Maybe it's talent.

641
00:30:31,999 --> 00:30:33,619
Maybe it's mental illness.

642
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:36,018
All I heard was "Great artist."
Keep going.

643
00:30:36,019 --> 00:30:40,993
Fairview is not the fertile
ground required for you to grow.

644
00:30:41,893 --> 00:30:45,372
I think we need to move your skinny
little tush to New York City.

645
00:30:45,373 --> 00:30:48,021
Move? Uh, no.

646
00:30:48,022 --> 00:30:50,283
I just need to get away for a few weeks.

647
00:30:50,284 --> 00:30:51,859
I'll set you up in an apartment.

648
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:52,976
You paint.

649
00:30:53,324 --> 00:30:55,723
I'll take 50% of whatever I sell,

650
00:30:55,724 --> 00:30:59,411
but let's not get bogged down
in how the sausage gets made.

651
00:30:59,412 --> 00:31:00,813
What about my family?

652
00:31:00,814 --> 00:31:03,537
My son is in the middle of third grade.

653
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,205
New York has the best private
schools in the world.

654
00:31:06,206 --> 00:31:09,201
He can wear a little blazer to school.

655
00:31:09,907 --> 00:31:12,133
Heck, if he can fit into a child's medium,

656
00:31:12,134 --> 00:31:13,931
I can loan him one of mine.

657
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:20,206
I never really thought
about moving before.

658
00:31:20,207 --> 00:31:22,484
Well, what is keeping you here?

659
00:31:28,477 --> 00:31:29,571
Yeah, not much.

660
00:31:30,422 --> 00:31:32,562
Okay. Think it over.

661
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:35,563
But if you turn me down, then I'll know...

662
00:31:36,471 --> 00:31:38,067
it's mental illness.

663
00:31:49,751 --> 00:31:51,015
I want to offer you a deal.

664
00:31:51,333 --> 00:31:52,575
A deal?

665
00:31:52,931 --> 00:31:53,862
Really?

666
00:31:54,571 --> 00:31:55,585
Terms?

667
00:31:56,438 --> 00:31:57,258
Whatever I've done...

668
00:31:57,259 --> 00:32:00,053
or whatever it is you think I've done...

669
00:32:00,054 --> 00:32:03,426
you... write it up,
and I'll sign a confession.

670
00:32:04,749 --> 00:32:06,134
In exchange for...

671
00:32:06,135 --> 00:32:07,682
you leave my friends out of it.

672
00:32:08,405 --> 00:32:09,885
Oh, darn.

673
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,699
I was actually interested
there for a minute.

674
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,139
What do you hope to gain
by harassing my friends?

675
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,325
What do you want?

676
00:32:15,326 --> 00:32:16,432
This.

677
00:32:17,693 --> 00:32:19,033
You in pain.

678
00:32:19,397 --> 00:32:20,426
You see,

679
00:32:20,836 --> 00:32:24,728
I could never figure out a way
to hurt you the way you hurt me.

680
00:32:24,883 --> 00:32:28,122
If you had any idea how
much I'm hurting already...

681
00:32:28,123 --> 00:32:29,854
It's not enough. You know why?

682
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:31,350
Because you're too resilient.

683
00:32:31,351 --> 00:32:33,922
Husbands die, kids leave,
businesses collapse,

684
00:32:33,923 --> 00:32:36,426
and Bree always bounces back.

685
00:32:36,427 --> 00:32:38,022
But threaten her friends?

686
00:32:40,066 --> 00:32:41,182
Please.

687
00:32:42,081 --> 00:32:44,157
You're talking about the people I love.

688
00:32:45,064 --> 00:32:47,533
They're my whole world.
I have nothing else.

689
00:32:48,969 --> 00:32:50,589
You have nothing else?

690
00:32:52,434 --> 00:32:54,662
That's a bad position to make a deal from.

691
00:32:59,025 --> 00:33:00,067
Sorry.

692
00:33:03,469 --> 00:33:05,695
Hey, you remember that deal
I wanted to make with you?

693
00:33:07,473 --> 00:33:10,182
You marry me and I take care
of you the rest of your life?

694
00:33:13,218 --> 00:33:14,455
Maybe you should've taken it.

695
00:33:32,645 --> 00:33:35,118
Hey. You're old and
pretty much housebound.

696
00:33:36,182 --> 00:33:40,498
Have you noticed if Ben's been
"Entertaining" a lot lately?

697
00:33:40,534 --> 00:33:42,817
This is what I get for
not having a pit bull.

698
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:45,513
I think he's cheating on me.

699
00:33:45,514 --> 00:33:48,696
Ben? No, he-he seems like a great guy.

700
00:33:48,697 --> 00:33:51,957
My ex was a great guy, too.
Ask any stripper in New York City.

701
00:33:52,344 --> 00:33:55,372
Oh, my god! I cannot
go through that again.

702
00:33:55,373 --> 00:33:57,060
I-I just can't.

703
00:33:57,061 --> 00:34:01,138
Renee, I may not be your biggest
fan or... even like you,

704
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:03,858
but there's one thing
no one can argue with...

705
00:34:04,214 --> 00:34:05,714
you are hot.

706
00:34:07,318 --> 00:34:09,367
Pardon? Look at you.

707
00:34:09,716 --> 00:34:11,215
You're a knockout...

708
00:34:11,612 --> 00:34:14,504
those gams, those curves,
that killer smile.

709
00:34:14,876 --> 00:34:17,048
Basically you're me 35 years ago.

710
00:34:18,698 --> 00:34:20,254
So this is my future?

711
00:34:21,283 --> 00:34:22,737
The point is,

712
00:34:22,738 --> 00:34:25,118
whoever this woman is,
she can't hold a candle to you.

713
00:34:25,994 --> 00:34:27,765
Oh, thank you, Karen.

714
00:34:28,174 --> 00:34:30,052
Now go out there and fight for your man.

715
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:34,136
You're right. Tonight I will
throw on a little nothing

716
00:34:34,468 --> 00:34:35,896
and make a house call.

717
00:34:36,299 --> 00:34:37,505
Thatta girl.

718
00:34:40,884 --> 00:34:41,928
You know what?

719
00:34:42,097 --> 00:34:44,379
I wish I had known you 35 years ago.

720
00:34:44,718 --> 00:34:46,178
We would've made a hell of a team.

721
00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:48,746
Hey, we still can if the aussie's into it.

722
00:34:53,617 --> 00:34:55,503
Stop packing. We're not moving.

723
00:34:55,504 --> 00:34:57,223
Don't you see how great this is?

724
00:34:57,224 --> 00:34:59,620
Living in New York,
getting paid to paint...

725
00:34:59,621 --> 00:35:01,141
it's an amazing opportunity.

726
00:35:01,142 --> 00:35:02,448
To uproot our family

727
00:35:02,449 --> 00:35:04,168
and move somewhere we've
never lived before?

728
00:35:04,169 --> 00:35:06,732
So we'll go for a few weeks
and see how we like it.

729
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,725
Susan, you do know that if
Chuck wants to take you down,

730
00:35:09,726 --> 00:35:11,569
moving to New York's not gonna stop him.

731
00:35:12,328 --> 00:35:13,188
I know that.

732
00:35:14,069 --> 00:35:16,014
Well, then why would you want to
give up the life we have here,

733
00:35:16,015 --> 00:35:17,403
after all this time?

734
00:35:17,766 --> 00:35:19,402
Because it's different.

735
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:23,768
Before, all I had to do
was look out that window

736
00:35:23,769 --> 00:35:25,417
and I'd see a true friend...

737
00:35:25,418 --> 00:35:29,081
someone who would do anything
for me or my family, but now...

738
00:35:30,733 --> 00:35:31,961
it's all gone.

739
00:35:32,055 --> 00:35:34,043
You think you're gonna
find that somewhere else?

740
00:35:35,477 --> 00:35:36,635
You're just running.

741
00:35:37,062 --> 00:35:38,930
Okay. So I'm running.

742
00:35:39,828 --> 00:35:44,042
Mike, if I get caught,
I could go away for a lot of years.

743
00:35:44,438 --> 00:35:45,930
So in the meantime,

744
00:35:46,806 --> 00:35:49,717
why not try to live
the life I've dreamed of?

745
00:35:49,718 --> 00:35:51,417
It's not my dream.

746
00:35:51,821 --> 00:35:53,548
And if this is something
that you need to do,

747
00:35:53,549 --> 00:35:54,761
you're on your own.

748
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:06,710
- Hello, Gaby.
- Celia, get back here!

749
00:36:06,711 --> 00:36:08,861
- Is this a bad time?
- Give me that now! Celia!

750
00:36:09,779 --> 00:36:11,626
Chuck, I have 2 daughters under 13.

751
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:12,864
It's always a bad time.

752
00:36:12,865 --> 00:36:14,964
Yeah, why don't you just step
outside here for a second?

753
00:36:21,843 --> 00:36:23,347
So did you talk to Carlos?

754
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:26,231
He's obviously ashamed of his affair.
The whoremonger.

755
00:36:26,658 --> 00:36:29,015
But at least he's honest about it.

756
00:36:29,467 --> 00:36:32,368
No. I wound up taking a different
angle on the investigation.

757
00:36:32,369 --> 00:36:35,077
Actually, you were the reason for that.

758
00:36:35,432 --> 00:36:37,509
Me? What do you mean?

759
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:41,438
Do you remember when
we were talking about this guy?

760
00:36:42,593 --> 00:36:43,540
Vaguely.

761
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,188
I remember it vividly,

762
00:36:45,552 --> 00:36:47,275
'cause it was the oddest thing...

763
00:36:47,485 --> 00:36:50,592
You see, when Susan saw this picture,
she nearly passed out.

764
00:36:51,045 --> 00:36:52,313
And when Lynette saw it,

765
00:36:52,314 --> 00:36:55,261
she willed herself into not reacting.

766
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:57,221
But you...

767
00:36:58,673 --> 00:36:59,557
you smirked.

768
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:05,781
That's crazy. Why would I do that?

769
00:37:06,208 --> 00:37:07,963
Same question I asked myself.

770
00:37:08,383 --> 00:37:11,619
So I started doing some
digging into your background.

771
00:37:12,823 --> 00:37:13,875
Turns out,

772
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:17,883
Ramon Sanchez, formerly of Oklahoma,

773
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,106
is actually...

774
00:37:21,549 --> 00:37:23,723
Alejandro Perez...

775
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:26,585
your stepfather.

776
00:37:28,449 --> 00:37:30,117
And you never mentioned that.

777
00:37:31,376 --> 00:37:34,364
Oh, come on, Chuck.
You can't even see who...

778
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,824
at this point, I don't think
you should say anything

779
00:37:36,825 --> 00:37:38,316
without a lawyer present.

780
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,964
Wait. Am I under arrest?

781
00:37:41,326 --> 00:37:42,209
Not yet.

782
00:37:42,504 --> 00:37:44,927
But based on this, I have to
start an official case file.

783
00:37:44,928 --> 00:37:46,660
I'm gonna need you to
come down to headquarters

784
00:37:46,661 --> 00:37:49,961
for an interview.
Be there tomorrow at 10:00.

785
00:37:53,397 --> 00:37:54,857
And, Gaby, if you don't...

786
00:37:56,548 --> 00:37:58,265
I'll send a squad car to get you.

787
00:38:12,615 --> 00:38:14,877
Hi. I need to speak with
Carlos Solis immediately.

788
00:38:14,878 --> 00:38:16,657
- I'm sorry, but Mr. Solis...
- Yeah, I know.

789
00:38:16,658 --> 00:38:18,605
I know you have that
anoying no-contact policy,

790
00:38:18,606 --> 00:38:19,779
but this is an emergency.

791
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:22,439
Mr. Solis isn't here.
He checked himself out two hours ago.

792
00:38:22,852 --> 00:38:24,529
What? Why didn't you stop him?

793
00:38:24,906 --> 00:38:27,151
He was not in a mood to be stopped.

794
00:38:33,011 --> 00:38:35,591
Ben, are you in there?

795
00:38:36,411 --> 00:38:39,063
I'm wearing leather and I'm getting cold.

796
00:38:41,953 --> 00:38:42,909
Ben?

797
00:39:22,748 --> 00:39:24,576
Bree, no need to call me back.

798
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:26,557
Just wanted to let you know that

799
00:39:26,558 --> 00:39:29,130
my unofficial investigation's
about to go official.

800
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:31,842
Be at the station
tomorrow morning at 10:00.

801
00:39:32,181 --> 00:39:33,346
Bring a lawyer.

802
00:39:46,448 --> 00:39:49,660
<i>Just when my friends
needed each other most,</i>

803
00:39:49,661 --> 00:39:52,457
<i>they found themselves utterly alone...</i>

804
00:39:54,565 --> 00:39:58,146
<i>One with the frantic need
to find her husband...</i>

805
00:40:00,403 --> 00:40:05,141
<i>One with the consequences of
revealing a painful secret...</i>

806
00:40:07,904 --> 00:40:12,802
<i>And one with the feeling that
she simply no longer belonged.</i>

807
00:40:16,775 --> 00:40:18,942
<i>But for one of my friends,</i>

808
00:40:18,943 --> 00:40:22,155
<i>the sense of isolation was so complete...</i>

809
00:40:22,156 --> 00:40:23,480
Here you go.

810
00:40:23,572 --> 00:40:26,311
<i>There might be no escaping it.</i>

811
00:40:26,312 --> 00:40:27,942
Continental breakfast runs till 10:30,

812
00:40:27,943 --> 00:40:29,947
but the good stuff's gone by 8:00.

813
00:40:30,846 --> 00:40:33,372
Oh, I don't think I'll be
having breakfast. Thank you.

814
00:40:35,127 --> 00:40:36,275
Suit yourself.

815
00:41:07,399 --> 00:41:11,516
Do you remember how wonderful
things used to be on the lane?

816
00:41:15,919 --> 00:41:17,667
I had the perfect life.

817
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:21,530
Doctor husband...

818
00:41:23,118 --> 00:41:25,291
two beautiful children...

819
00:41:26,718 --> 00:41:28,434
oh, and such dear friends.

820
00:41:32,766 --> 00:41:33,994
What happened?

821
00:41:34,382 --> 00:41:36,121
How did I lose it all?

822
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,809
Things change, Bree.

823
00:41:43,005 --> 00:41:44,618
I'm so unhappy.

824
00:41:53,274 --> 00:41:54,935
Are you happy now?

825
00:41:59,831 --> 00:42:01,339
I'm not unhappy.

826
00:42:20,923 --> 00:42:26,400
