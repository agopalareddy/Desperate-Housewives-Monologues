1
00:00:01,259 --> 00:00:03,734
<i>Previously on...</i>

2
00:00:03,746 --> 00:00:06,910
<i>Tom and Lynette drifted further apart,</i>

3
00:00:06,911 --> 00:00:09,275
<i>and Jane took advantage.</i>

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,670
I'm scared.

5
00:00:10,671 --> 00:00:13,362
<i>Roy helped Karen face her cancer.</i>

6
00:00:13,363 --> 00:00:14,432
We're done.

7
00:00:14,687 --> 00:00:16,638
I'm the one that decides when we're done.

8
00:00:16,639 --> 00:00:19,162
<i>The loan shark threatened Renee.</i>

9
00:00:19,163 --> 00:00:20,758
<i>But Mike stepped in.</i>

10
00:00:20,759 --> 00:00:23,751
- I don't ever wanna see you again.
- Then you shoulda killed me.

11
00:00:23,752 --> 00:00:25,906
<i>Bree discovered the truth about Orson...</i>

12
00:00:25,907 --> 00:00:28,163
You wrote the letters? You killed Chuck?

13
00:00:28,164 --> 00:00:30,391
<i>And cut off all contact with him.</i>

14
00:00:30,392 --> 00:00:32,999
Don't you ever call my house again.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,579
I can assure you this is
the last you'll hear from me.

16
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,504
<i>But Orson had the last word.</i>

17
00:00:43,612 --> 00:00:44,759
<i>In our neighborhood,</i>

18
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,779
<i>there are people we see every day,</i>

19
00:00:48,728 --> 00:00:52,163
<i>and every day, we take them for granted.</i>

20
00:00:53,896 --> 00:00:55,783
<i>As we go about our lives,</i>

21
00:00:55,784 --> 00:00:58,947
<i>we may be busy with a mundane task</i>

22
00:00:59,193 --> 00:01:01,699
<i>and miss one another completely.</i>

23
00:01:04,007 --> 00:01:06,627
<i>Or we might give a polite wave,</i>

24
00:01:06,839 --> 00:01:09,619
<i>only to return to what we were doing.</i>

25
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,267
<i>One minute, we're spending
time with a loved one...</i>

26
00:01:17,816 --> 00:01:20,933
<i>and the next,
we're wrapped up in our work.</i>

27
00:01:23,559 --> 00:01:27,076
<i>Or preoccupied with our own problems.</i>

28
00:01:28,999 --> 00:01:32,804
<i>What a shame these neighbors
take each other for granted...</i>

29
00:01:33,687 --> 00:01:35,956
<i>because in just a few days...</i>

30
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:40,516
<i>one of these people will be dead.</i>

31
00:01:52,591 --> 00:01:55,546
<i>That afternoon, old friends got together</i>

32
00:01:55,547 --> 00:01:59,291
<i>to share coffee and
gossip and to discover...</i>

33
00:01:59,292 --> 00:02:00,695
Is there a cup for me?

34
00:02:01,675 --> 00:02:05,433
<i>That they were still
old friends after all.</i>

35
00:02:08,284 --> 00:02:12,163
So Orson was behind everything...
Chuck, the letters?

36
00:02:12,951 --> 00:02:14,547
Do you know why he did it?

37
00:02:14,808 --> 00:02:15,368
He thought the only way

38
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:17,790
he could have me to himself
was by tearing me away

39
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:18,994
from you three.

40
00:02:18,995 --> 00:02:21,255
Well, guess what? He failed.

41
00:02:21,256 --> 00:02:24,346
That's right, because
we are still here for you.

44
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:30,264
He better not show his face
around here ever again.

45
00:02:34,652 --> 00:02:35,800
What's wrong?

46
00:02:36,028 --> 00:02:37,651
The last time I spoke to Orson,

47
00:02:37,652 --> 00:02:41,411
he... intimated that
he would take his own life.

48
00:02:41,412 --> 00:02:42,895
Oh, sweetie.

49
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:44,058
And I should have done something.

50
00:02:44,059 --> 00:02:46,450
I should have made him
tell me where he was

51
00:02:46,451 --> 00:02:47,879
and gone to him.

52
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,730
Why? So he could torture you some more?

53
00:02:49,731 --> 00:02:52,159
I know what he's become, but you all know

54
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,792
there was a time when
I loved that man very much.

55
00:02:54,793 --> 00:02:57,076
Well, he's not that man anymore.

56
00:03:02,792 --> 00:03:04,750
Okay, have we been sad long enough?

57
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:06,812
Because I'd just like
to point something out.

58
00:03:06,992 --> 00:03:09,340
We are finally in the clear.

59
00:03:09,488 --> 00:03:13,211
She's right. The letters were
the last question mark left.

60
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,962
So maybe now we can get back to normal.

61
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:20,647
Yes. Our nightmare is finally over.

62
00:03:35,508 --> 00:03:36,640
Thanks.

63
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:46,102
Is everything all right over here?

64
00:03:46,103 --> 00:03:48,911
Doctors... they should learn
how to talk to people.

65
00:03:48,912 --> 00:03:50,654
I'm afraid I don't understand.

66
00:03:50,655 --> 00:03:53,067
We just got back from my appointment.

67
00:03:53,456 --> 00:03:56,607
Looks like the cancer's spreading
faster than anyone thought.

68
00:03:56,608 --> 00:03:58,300
Oh, Karen.

69
00:03:58,384 --> 00:03:59,671
Yep. He gave me

70
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:02,739
the ol' "Put your affairs
in order" speech.

71
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,656
Only not that nice.

72
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,063
These are people these
doctors are talking to,

73
00:04:07,064 --> 00:04:09,640
not just some name on a chart.

74
00:04:09,641 --> 00:04:11,830
They can all go to hell!

75
00:04:13,673 --> 00:04:15,054
I'm so sorry.

76
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:17,420
He's just pissed at the world.

77
00:04:18,176 --> 00:04:19,555
Oh, I've got it. I've got it.

78
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,463
How about you?

79
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:27,132
I can't even imagine what
you're going through.

80
00:04:28,719 --> 00:04:31,818
I'm really gonna miss
the Christmas festival.

81
00:04:32,719 --> 00:04:35,403
The lane looks so pretty when
the lights are, you know...

82
00:04:37,376 --> 00:04:38,428
Karen...

83
00:04:39,472 --> 00:04:41,996
if there's anything I can do for you...

84
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,699
I mean it. Anything.

85
00:04:45,232 --> 00:04:47,308
Yeah. Thanks, Bree.

86
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,611
Come in!

87
00:04:57,744 --> 00:05:00,754
Wow! The place looks great.

88
00:05:00,755 --> 00:05:04,042
You are going all out.

89
00:05:04,043 --> 00:05:06,026
Ever since Porter's big announcement,

90
00:05:06,027 --> 00:05:08,871
I have a new policy for all our kids.

91
00:05:09,051 --> 00:05:10,758
If you can resist procreating,

92
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:13,154
I will throw you a bitchin' party.

93
00:05:13,754 --> 00:05:14,401
Well, I just...

94
00:05:14,402 --> 00:05:17,090
I wanted to drop off
Penny's present, so...

95
00:05:17,091 --> 00:05:19,442
Champagne? Isn't that taking
the bitchin' party idea

96
00:05:19,443 --> 00:05:20,969
a little too far?

97
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,475
That is for you.

98
00:05:22,476 --> 00:05:24,206
You went through 22
hours of labor with her.

99
00:05:24,207 --> 00:05:26,619
Seems like you should
get to celebrate, too.

100
00:05:26,672 --> 00:05:28,508
That is so thoughtful.

101
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:32,263
Uncharacteristically thoughtful,
and now that I think about it,

102
00:05:32,264 --> 00:05:34,628
you could have brought
Penny's present to the party,

103
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:36,260
So, um...

104
00:05:37,944 --> 00:05:39,108
what's going on?

105
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,580
Okay, um... I was just wondering...

106
00:05:43,964 --> 00:05:45,512
if you wouldn't mind...

107
00:05:47,163 --> 00:05:48,606
maybe we should open that champagne now.

108
00:05:48,607 --> 00:05:50,192
Just say it.

109
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:52,859
I-I want to bring Jane to Penny's party.

110
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,340
Oh, god.

111
00:05:55,566 --> 00:05:57,519
Look, I know it's a little awkward.

112
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,623
Bringing a date to
your daughter's birthday party

113
00:05:59,624 --> 00:06:00,503
when you're still married?

114
00:06:00,504 --> 00:06:03,759
Yeah, it's a little awkward.
This is a family event.

115
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,727
I know, but Jane is part of my life now.

116
00:06:05,728 --> 00:06:07,582
Yeah. Your life.

117
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:10,059
I'm sorry, Lynette, but...

118
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:13,227
I really want to start including
Jane in some of these things.

119
00:06:13,472 --> 00:06:14,683
Why?

120
00:06:15,328 --> 00:06:16,004
Well...

121
00:06:16,005 --> 00:06:17,039
Dad!

122
00:06:17,523 --> 00:06:18,978
Hey, you.

123
00:06:19,652 --> 00:06:21,459
- Is that for me?
- Ahem.

124
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,735
Can I open it?

125
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:25,422
Hey, I know this trick,
and if I let you open it today,

126
00:06:25,423 --> 00:06:27,454
you are gonna guilt me
into buying you another one

127
00:06:27,455 --> 00:06:29,196
on your actual birthday.

128
00:06:29,311 --> 00:06:31,179
That's totally what I'm going to do.

129
00:06:32,303 --> 00:06:34,187
And I am totally gonna fall for it.

130
00:06:34,188 --> 00:06:35,422
What... hey!

131
00:06:35,423 --> 00:06:36,651
Hey, hey, hey.

132
00:06:36,911 --> 00:06:38,590
Didn't you wanna finish our conversation?

133
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:41,052
Another time. Just enjoy the champagne.

134
00:06:45,295 --> 00:06:47,562
You had to get the girls a cat,
didn't you?

135
00:06:47,563 --> 00:06:49,002
Even though you know I'm allergic.

136
00:06:49,003 --> 00:06:51,406
Oh, you say you're allergic
to everything you don't like...

137
00:06:51,407 --> 00:06:54,814
Cats, raisins, the vacuum cleaner.

138
00:06:54,815 --> 00:06:56,846
Hey, that is medically verified.

139
00:06:56,847 --> 00:06:58,207
Girls, show mommy how sad we'd be

140
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,236
if she made us give back Rufus?

141
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,018
Oh, how could I say "No" to such sad

142
00:07:06,019 --> 00:07:08,832
and obviously rehearsed faces?

143
00:07:10,788 --> 00:07:12,496
Daddy, you wanna see him do a trick?

144
00:07:13,044 --> 00:07:14,479
Kitty, fetch.

145
00:07:17,748 --> 00:07:19,054
Now come back.

146
00:07:19,683 --> 00:07:20,911
Rufus?

147
00:07:22,596 --> 00:07:24,960
He kinda does whatever he wants.

148
00:07:27,636 --> 00:07:29,938
Well, he should fit right in around here.

149
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:33,231
I'm not the one who just brought
kitty litter into our lives.

150
00:07:33,378 --> 00:07:37,071
Look... if the cat makes them happy,

151
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,511
then it makes me happy.

152
00:07:38,995 --> 00:07:40,359
One thing I realized in rehab...

153
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,167
there is nothing more important to me

154
00:07:42,168 --> 00:07:44,084
than taking care of you guys.

155
00:07:44,783 --> 00:07:47,516
I love you for that. Mmm.

156
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,151
Ah! Before I forget,

157
00:07:49,152 --> 00:07:51,180
I got you a present.

158
00:07:54,912 --> 00:07:56,299
A tie.

159
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:59,467
It's for your first day
back at work after rehab.

160
00:07:59,504 --> 00:08:02,398
Something that says,
"I'm sober, I'm stylish,"

161
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,908
"and my wife has excellent taste."

162
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,422
I was having so much fun
with you and the girls,

163
00:08:09,423 --> 00:08:13,116
I... kinda forgot I have to work tomorrow.

164
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:16,256
Well, you could say "Thank you."

165
00:08:16,257 --> 00:08:17,851
I spent a lot of your money on it.

166
00:08:18,975 --> 00:08:20,683
Sorry, babe. Thank you.

167
00:08:21,104 --> 00:08:24,539
Okay. Bedtime for bonzos!

168
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,641
Hello there.

169
00:08:41,557 --> 00:08:43,696
Thank you for fixing my car today.

170
00:08:43,894 --> 00:08:45,582
I like a man who's good with his hands.

171
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,260
It's very sexy.

172
00:08:47,935 --> 00:08:52,780
Although I think my engine is
still running a little hot.

173
00:08:55,056 --> 00:08:56,332
Vroom.

174
00:08:57,344 --> 00:08:59,355
Susan, what are you doing?

175
00:08:59,552 --> 00:09:00,370
The question is,

176
00:09:00,371 --> 00:09:03,903
"Who am I doing?" the answer is "You."

177
00:09:05,028 --> 00:09:09,231
Oh. I'm sorry. I'm just really beat.

178
00:09:10,852 --> 00:09:14,175
All that hard work really
took it out on you, huh?

179
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:17,712
Well, hey...

180
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,895
maybe this is something
that will relax you.

181
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:23,327
Hello.

182
00:09:23,716 --> 00:09:24,802
That a gun in your pocket,

183
00:09:24,803 --> 00:09:26,863
or are you just happy to see me?

184
00:09:28,483 --> 00:09:30,639
Oh, my god. It is a gun.

185
00:09:30,931 --> 00:09:32,675
You've got a gun in your pocket?

186
00:09:32,676 --> 00:09:33,978
Susan, don't freak out.

187
00:09:33,979 --> 00:09:35,432
Why do you have a gun?

188
00:09:37,724 --> 00:09:38,840
Sit down.

189
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:41,240
I have something I need to tell you.

190
00:09:47,931 --> 00:09:49,912
Did you mean what you said today?

191
00:09:51,612 --> 00:09:52,696
Karen.

192
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:54,435
About helping me with anything I need?

193
00:09:54,436 --> 00:09:57,027
'cause a lot of people say that,
but they don't mean it.

194
00:09:57,028 --> 00:09:58,746
No. No, I meant it.

195
00:09:58,747 --> 00:10:00,568
You sure? Because let's be honest.

196
00:10:00,569 --> 00:10:02,566
You and I never really liked each other.

197
00:10:02,713 --> 00:10:04,405
- We haven't?
- No.

198
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,412
Well, I definitely meant what I said.

199
00:10:06,413 --> 00:10:08,502
Whatever you need, consider it done.

200
00:10:08,503 --> 00:10:10,436
Good. I want you to help kill me.

201
00:10:12,998 --> 00:10:16,194
Um... maybe we should
talk about this inside.

202
00:10:19,142 --> 00:10:22,377
Karen, you can't seriously
be considering this.

203
00:10:22,378 --> 00:10:25,560
Listen, cancer's a bully,

204
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,635
and when it's as bad as mine,

205
00:10:26,636 --> 00:10:30,524
it laughs at our pathetic
little attempts to fight it.

206
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:32,876
So here's how I win...

207
00:10:34,271 --> 00:10:36,442
by making sure that I'm the one

208
00:10:36,443 --> 00:10:39,784
that says when and how I go.

209
00:10:40,796 --> 00:10:43,143
So... will you help me?

210
00:10:46,052 --> 00:10:47,315
What does Roy think?

211
00:10:47,316 --> 00:10:49,536
Well, Roy was the first one I went to.

212
00:10:49,698 --> 00:10:53,135
He couldn't do it.
Too much of a marshmallow.

213
00:10:53,683 --> 00:10:56,351
I need someone cold and heartless.

214
00:10:57,103 --> 00:10:58,267
And that's me?

215
00:10:58,287 --> 00:10:59,611
A dying woman's sitting in front of you,

216
00:10:59,612 --> 00:11:01,098
and you haven't even
offered a cup of coffee.

217
00:11:01,099 --> 00:11:02,471
What does that tell ya?

218
00:11:06,844 --> 00:11:09,559
I don't... I don't know
if I could do that.

219
00:11:12,107 --> 00:11:14,343
I don't want to die alone, Bree.

220
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:17,511
And the chemo's just kicking my ass.

221
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:21,015
I don't want to waste
away in some hospital bed.

222
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,943
Please help me go the way I want to.

223
00:11:31,004 --> 00:11:32,103
All right.

224
00:11:33,212 --> 00:11:34,551
I'll help you.

225
00:11:52,055 --> 00:11:54,660
Sorry to keep you waiting,
Mr. and Mrs. Delfino.

226
00:11:54,711 --> 00:11:55,987
What can I do for you?

227
00:11:56,436 --> 00:11:58,548
My husband did something really stupid,

228
00:11:58,549 --> 00:12:00,426
and now we need police protection.

229
00:12:00,427 --> 00:12:01,959
Susan, please, just let me handle this.

230
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,458
And by "Handle this," he means,

231
00:12:03,459 --> 00:12:06,144
"Stare out the window
with a gun in his pants."

232
00:12:06,307 --> 00:12:09,152
Could you... start from
the beginning, please?

233
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,512
A buddy of mine...
and I'm not telling you who...

234
00:12:12,547 --> 00:12:14,400
borrowed some money from a loan shark,

235
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:15,746
and things got a little out of hand,

236
00:12:15,747 --> 00:12:16,742
and I had to help him out.

237
00:12:16,743 --> 00:12:18,390
Oh, and by "Help him out," he means

238
00:12:18,391 --> 00:12:21,316
"Beat up a mob guy,
putting our whole family in danger."

239
00:12:21,591 --> 00:12:22,465
Does your friend know it's illegal

240
00:12:22,466 --> 00:12:24,493
to use the services of a loan shark?

241
00:12:25,633 --> 00:12:26,479
He does.

242
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,038
Do you know it's illegal
to assault someone?

243
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:30,051
The guy was breaking into
our neighbor's house.

244
00:12:30,108 --> 00:12:31,916
I tried to get him to leave,
he threw a punch,

245
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,276
and I defended myself.

246
00:12:33,277 --> 00:12:36,038
And now this lowlife
wants to kill my husband,

247
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:38,411
- so you need to arrest him.
- Well, if you had called us

248
00:12:38,412 --> 00:12:40,379
after he broke into your neighbor's house,

249
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,672
maybe we could have.

250
00:12:41,771 --> 00:12:46,427
Oh. So it would have been
smarter to call the cops

251
00:12:46,428 --> 00:12:48,946
instead of slapping Jimmy Knuckles

252
00:12:48,947 --> 00:12:50,687
around the living room. Huh.

253
00:12:51,075 --> 00:12:53,551
Where have I heard that before?

254
00:12:53,588 --> 00:12:55,775
Oh, that's right... from me.

255
00:12:57,283 --> 00:12:58,672
What's this about a gun?

256
00:12:58,884 --> 00:13:00,848
Do you have a permit for a gun, sir?

257
00:13:01,107 --> 00:13:02,979
All right, detective,
I think we're wasting your time.

258
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,855
I can take care of this.

259
00:13:03,856 --> 00:13:06,359
No, Mike. You've been taking care of it,

260
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,610
and look where it got us.

261
00:13:07,611 --> 00:13:09,959
We have a 9-year-old son.

262
00:13:10,716 --> 00:13:13,894
Okay. Okay, look, here's what I can do.

263
00:13:13,895 --> 00:13:14,974
We have your address.

264
00:13:14,975 --> 00:13:17,411
I'll make sure the patrol
car keeps an eye on things.

265
00:13:17,412 --> 00:13:20,416
and if you see this guy, call us.

266
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:22,963
Wait. That's it?

267
00:13:22,964 --> 00:13:24,430
Ma'am, I'm afraid that's all we can do

268
00:13:24,431 --> 00:13:26,252
until something else happens.

269
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:29,607
Great. Well, maybe we'll get lucky,

270
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:31,460
and something else will happen.

271
00:13:41,272 --> 00:13:42,102
Honey, there's fresh coffee.

272
00:13:42,103 --> 00:13:43,911
You want me to put some in a travel mug?

273
00:13:43,912 --> 00:13:45,076
Okay.

274
00:13:45,767 --> 00:13:46,851
What's wrong?

275
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,147
30 days with the rehab hippies,

276
00:13:48,148 --> 00:13:50,023
and you've already
forgotten how to tie a tie?

277
00:13:50,024 --> 00:13:51,143
I've just been thinking.

278
00:13:51,144 --> 00:13:53,310
I've worn a tie every day for 25 years,

279
00:13:53,311 --> 00:13:57,468
and I've always hated 
the way it feels around my neck.

280
00:13:57,888 --> 00:14:01,644
So? I wear lots of uncomfortable things...

281
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:04,511
High-heeled shoes,
bras that mash my boobs together.

282
00:14:04,512 --> 00:14:05,954
I'm starting to think that a tie

283
00:14:05,955 --> 00:14:08,831
is basically just a fancy noose.

284
00:14:09,411 --> 00:14:10,767
Oh, honey.

285
00:14:12,196 --> 00:14:14,671
You're not nervous about
your first day back, are you?

286
00:14:15,732 --> 00:14:16,799
I don't know.

287
00:14:17,988 --> 00:14:20,112
I just thought I'd be
more excited than I am.

288
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:21,113
Well, you're the boss.

289
00:14:21,114 --> 00:14:22,806
You want excitement, shake things up.

290
00:14:22,806 --> 00:14:24,239
Buy a new xerox machine

291
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:26,989
or get some post-its in crazy colors.

292
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,595
Take the staff to happy hoho.
Get stinking drunk.

293
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,793
Okay, maybe not the stinking drunk part,

294
00:14:32,794 --> 00:14:33,919
but you know what I mean.

295
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:35,898
I gotta get the girls to school.

296
00:14:35,899 --> 00:14:36,993
See you tonight.

297
00:14:44,129 --> 00:14:46,496
I'm just saying, you didn't
have to fight that woman

298
00:14:46,497 --> 00:14:47,531
over a pair of boots.

299
00:14:47,532 --> 00:14:49,409
I saw 'em first.

300
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:51,208
On her feet.

301
00:14:51,209 --> 00:14:53,720
Sorry. I shop New York style.

302
00:14:53,721 --> 00:14:55,633
Until someone is either
bruised or bleeding,

303
00:14:55,634 --> 00:14:56,999
no sale is final.

304
00:15:03,018 --> 00:15:04,182
Hello?

305
00:15:05,457 --> 00:15:06,953
Oh, hi, Karen.

306
00:15:08,652 --> 00:15:11,306
No. No, now is not a good time.

307
00:15:11,307 --> 00:15:12,830
Uh, Renee's visiting.

308
00:15:14,365 --> 00:15:16,072
Well, uh, I'm open tomorrow.

309
00:15:16,073 --> 00:15:18,606
Perhaps I could euthanize
you in the morning.

310
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:21,637
Great. I will see you then.

311
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:24,710
So I couldn't help but overhear.

312
00:15:28,204 --> 00:15:31,719
It's Karen. Her cancer's spreading.

313
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,565
- Oh, no.
- Yeah.

314
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,061
She's... depressed and...

315
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:42,869
wants me to help her die with dignity.

316
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:45,295
Oh, my god. Are you gonna do it?

317
00:15:45,296 --> 00:15:46,570
Of course not.

318
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:48,444
She just got devastating news.

319
00:15:48,445 --> 00:15:50,270
She's in a state of shock.

320
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,039
I'm just trying to string her along

321
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,672
and buy some time until
she's thinking clearly again.

322
00:15:55,781 --> 00:15:57,090
Think that'll work?

323
00:15:57,405 --> 00:15:58,650
It's got to.

324
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:01,702
By the way, to help her
keep her mind off it,

325
00:16:01,703 --> 00:16:05,014
I'm having people stop by and have tea,

326
00:16:05,015 --> 00:16:06,535
You know, play scrabble with her,

327
00:16:06,536 --> 00:16:08,647
maybe give her a foot massage.

328
00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:11,711
Do you think tomorrow maybe
you could stop by and...

329
00:16:11,712 --> 00:16:13,345
Bree, if I touch that woman's feet,

330
00:16:13,346 --> 00:16:15,163
you're gonna have to euthanize me.

331
00:16:19,129 --> 00:16:21,013
Billy, where are you?

332
00:16:23,117 --> 00:16:26,640
Oh, look, look! There's a gold!
Come on! The gold!

333
00:16:27,002 --> 00:16:27,966
Aah! Hi!

334
00:16:30,158 --> 00:16:31,668
- Mom?
- Yeah?

335
00:16:31,977 --> 00:16:35,313
This party is amazing. Thank you so much!

336
00:16:35,314 --> 00:16:38,594
Oh, I just wanted
your birthday to be perfect.

337
00:16:39,971 --> 00:16:41,294
Happy birthday, Penny.

338
00:16:41,295 --> 00:16:43,012
Then again, nothing's perfect.

339
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:45,638
Hey, Jane. Tom went to pick up the cake,

340
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:47,929
so if you wanna wait in the car or...

341
00:16:48,909 --> 00:16:51,559
Oh! I didn't know you
were bringing a guest.

342
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,876
Actually, this is my gift for Penny.

343
00:16:53,877 --> 00:16:55,011
A geisha?

344
00:16:55,617 --> 00:16:57,750
My niece Cindy. She's a photographer.

345
00:16:57,751 --> 00:16:59,581
Hi. Nice to meet you.

346
00:17:00,476 --> 00:17:01,698
She's gonna take pictures of the party,

347
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:04,373
and then I'm gonna make a memory book.

348
00:17:05,244 --> 00:17:06,000
Cool!

349
00:17:06,001 --> 00:17:07,527
I knew you would love it.

350
00:17:08,376 --> 00:17:09,469
Come here.

351
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:12,472
Funny faces.

352
00:17:14,174 --> 00:17:15,134
Perfect.

353
00:17:44,581 --> 00:17:46,278
Can I talk to you for a second?

354
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:47,463
Okay.

355
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,601
What are you doing?

356
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,798
Just making sure I'm in the memory book.

357
00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:00,448
You're invading every photo
that Penny and I are in.

358
00:18:00,614 --> 00:18:02,724
I'm her mother. Maybe you're the invader.

359
00:18:02,725 --> 00:18:04,495
And we're back to this.

360
00:18:04,496 --> 00:18:06,078
I spent weeks planning this party,

361
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:07,802
making it perfect for her,
and then you come in

362
00:18:07,803 --> 00:18:09,315
and upstage me?

363
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:12,398
I'm just trying to forge
a relationship with Penny.

364
00:18:12,399 --> 00:18:14,732
Well, stop forging. You're not family.

365
00:18:14,733 --> 00:18:16,803
You're just some woman her father is...

366
00:18:18,491 --> 00:18:19,593
"seeing."

367
00:18:19,594 --> 00:18:20,777
Well...

368
00:18:21,212 --> 00:18:22,947
"Well," what?

369
00:18:22,948 --> 00:18:24,190
Well...

370
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,787
that's not all I am.

371
00:18:26,201 --> 00:18:27,449
What does that mean?

372
00:18:29,034 --> 00:18:31,849
You know, you should probably talk to Tom.

373
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:37,497
Tom's not here, so why don't you tell me

374
00:18:37,498 --> 00:18:38,982
what the hell you're talking about?

375
00:18:38,983 --> 00:18:40,174
Okay.

376
00:18:41,306 --> 00:18:42,651
I really didn't want you
to hear this from me,

377
00:18:42,652 --> 00:18:44,407
but since you're insisting...

378
00:18:45,213 --> 00:18:46,955
Tom asked me to move in with him.

379
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,087
So now you know.

380
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:06,732
Sorry!

381
00:19:06,733 --> 00:19:09,883
The cake took longer than I thought.

382
00:19:11,918 --> 00:19:12,743
What?

383
00:19:12,744 --> 00:19:13,522
This is how I find out

384
00:19:13,523 --> 00:19:15,798
you and Jane are going to
live together? From her?

385
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:19,173
Oh, no, no, no, no.
She wasn't supposed to say anything.

386
00:19:19,174 --> 00:19:21,498
Well, she didn't get the memo
because she did say something

387
00:19:21,499 --> 00:19:23,526
in my house... the house you and I lived in.

388
00:19:23,527 --> 00:19:25,136
I didn't deserve that.

389
00:19:25,667 --> 00:19:28,443
I am so sorry, Lynette.

390
00:19:30,655 --> 00:19:32,516
I really need to put this cake down.

391
00:19:32,517 --> 00:19:34,467
Why didn't you tell me?

392
00:19:34,504 --> 00:19:35,671
I tried the other day,

393
00:19:35,672 --> 00:19:37,239
but Penny wanted to open her present,

394
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,158
and I didn't want to ruin her birthday.

395
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,775
God, Tom.

396
00:19:41,954 --> 00:19:44,117
You've only known her three months.

397
00:19:44,118 --> 00:19:46,232
We were talking about the future,

398
00:19:46,233 --> 00:19:48,946
and living together is the next step.

399
00:19:48,947 --> 00:19:51,280
Oh, you're talking about steps now?

400
00:19:51,281 --> 00:19:53,396
Jeez, I wonder what
the step after that could be.

401
00:19:53,397 --> 00:19:55,195
We haven't talked about that.

402
00:19:55,196 --> 00:19:56,197
That's good,

403
00:19:56,198 --> 00:19:58,420
- since you and I aren't even divorced yet.
- I know.

404
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,965
I thought maybe we should
talk to a lawyer or something

405
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:02,057
this week.

406
00:20:08,995 --> 00:20:10,171
Really?

407
00:20:13,389 --> 00:20:15,989
I thought this was a trial separation,

408
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:20,207
to see how we did apart,
to see if we could be happy.

409
00:20:24,353 --> 00:20:25,589
That's the thing.

410
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,249
I am happy.

411
00:20:30,421 --> 00:20:32,528
And if you're not, I'm really sorry.

412
00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:36,519
Can I get a picture of mom and dad?

413
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:58,803
Karen, what in the world are you doing?!

414
00:20:59,751 --> 00:21:01,408
I lost a contact.

415
00:21:02,144 --> 00:21:04,536
Oh, my god. You were hoping
I would run you over.

416
00:21:04,537 --> 00:21:06,528
Well, what choice do I have?
You said you'd help me,

417
00:21:06,529 --> 00:21:08,227
and then you keep blowing me off.

418
00:21:08,228 --> 00:21:10,391
Now are you gonna kill me today or what?

419
00:21:10,392 --> 00:21:13,638
No, I cannot kill you today.
I have pilates.

420
00:21:14,395 --> 00:21:16,689
You know, Bree, it sounds
like we're just playing games.

421
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,002
Karen, I really wanna do this.

422
00:21:20,047 --> 00:21:23,648
I mean, I don't want to,
but... let's go for tomorrow.

423
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:24,956
No excuses.

424
00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:26,948
Really?

425
00:21:27,014 --> 00:21:28,220
Really.

426
00:21:32,018 --> 00:21:34,183
'Cause I'm serious about doing this...

427
00:21:34,714 --> 00:21:36,082
with or without you.

428
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:46,768
Hello?

429
00:21:46,769 --> 00:21:47,819
Mrs. Solis?

430
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:50,030
It's Marilyn, your husband's secretary.

431
00:21:50,031 --> 00:21:51,920
Hi, Marilyn. Why are we whispering?

432
00:21:51,921 --> 00:21:54,127
I don't want Mr. Solis
to know I'm calling you.

433
00:21:54,128 --> 00:21:55,102
Why? What's wrong?

434
00:21:55,103 --> 00:21:56,191
Uh...

435
00:21:57,156 --> 00:21:59,194
He's been acting a little strange,

436
00:21:59,195 --> 00:22:02,509
and I just really need
you to come down here.

437
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:04,430
He's coming.

438
00:22:11,254 --> 00:22:12,405
Excuse me.

439
00:22:12,972 --> 00:22:14,516
Marilyn, what's going on?

440
00:22:14,517 --> 00:22:17,195
What's going on?
He's giving away all our money!

441
00:22:17,444 --> 00:22:18,557
Who's this guy?

442
00:22:18,783 --> 00:22:20,986
Patrick McDonald, our C.F.O.

443
00:22:21,211 --> 00:22:22,859
Do you see all these people?

444
00:22:22,945 --> 00:22:24,828
A while back, we took
over a steel company,

445
00:22:24,829 --> 00:22:27,127
chopped it up, sold it,
made a nice profit.

446
00:22:27,128 --> 00:22:30,470
These are some of
the workers who got laid off.

447
00:22:31,434 --> 00:22:33,214
Okay, so what are they doing here?

448
00:22:33,675 --> 00:22:36,885
Carlos has taken it upon
himself to make things right

449
00:22:36,886 --> 00:22:41,281
by writing each of them
a check for $50,000.

450
00:22:43,316 --> 00:22:45,046
Uh... okay.

451
00:22:45,524 --> 00:22:46,526
Excuse me.

452
00:22:48,691 --> 00:22:49,745
Excuse me.

453
00:22:51,876 --> 00:22:53,297
Oh, boy. He keeps this up,

454
00:22:53,298 --> 00:22:55,564
and we'll be bankrupt
in a couple of weeks.

455
00:22:55,565 --> 00:22:57,547
Uh, Mrs. Solis,

456
00:22:57,677 --> 00:23:01,006
I'm a party girl with a taste
for young brazilian gentlemen.

457
00:23:01,007 --> 00:23:02,544
I really need this job.

458
00:23:03,622 --> 00:23:04,750
I'm on it.

459
00:23:08,436 --> 00:23:09,519
Honey?

460
00:23:10,011 --> 00:23:11,922
Hey, babe, took your advice.

461
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:13,103
My advice?

462
00:23:13,215 --> 00:23:14,092
You told me to shake things up,

463
00:23:14,093 --> 00:23:16,890
so I decided to make work
a place I want to be.

464
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:21,140
Hope this helps.

465
00:23:21,813 --> 00:23:25,617
And remember, you can be
anything you wanna be.

466
00:23:26,088 --> 00:23:27,770
Nothing is out of reach.

467
00:23:27,771 --> 00:23:29,044
What do you say, Skip?

468
00:23:29,524 --> 00:23:31,021
Thanks, mister.

469
00:23:31,897 --> 00:23:33,528
Honey, this is how you shake things up?

470
00:23:33,529 --> 00:23:35,201
By giving away all the company money?

471
00:23:35,202 --> 00:23:37,333
Oh, actually, I was afraid that
Patrick would put a stop payment

472
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:39,499
so I decided to start using
our personal account.

473
00:23:40,065 --> 00:23:41,816
All right, run along, tiny tim.

474
00:23:42,276 --> 00:23:43,778
Okay, let's go.

475
00:23:47,961 --> 00:23:49,246
Sweetheart...

476
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,230
you can be honest with me.

477
00:23:52,668 --> 00:23:54,428
Have you been drinking again?

478
00:23:54,765 --> 00:23:57,359
Nope. Haven't had a drink in 34 days.

479
00:23:57,526 --> 00:24:00,148
Then why the hell are you
acting like a crazy person?!

480
00:24:00,805 --> 00:24:02,233
You think this is crazy?

481
00:24:03,816 --> 00:24:04,940
No.

482
00:24:05,252 --> 00:24:09,529
What's crazy is making a fortune
off of other people's misery

483
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:12,460
without thinking for one minute
how they're suffering.

484
00:24:12,461 --> 00:24:15,369
What's crazy is thinking
you can find happiness

485
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:18,835
in a paycheck or behind
the wheel of a sports car.

486
00:24:18,836 --> 00:24:21,200
What's crazy is thinking that

487
00:24:21,201 --> 00:24:23,729
you're doing something
important with your life

488
00:24:24,792 --> 00:24:26,503
just because you're wearing a tie.

489
00:24:43,669 --> 00:24:44,302
What?

490
00:24:44,303 --> 00:24:46,479
I'm trying to find Ben.
He's not at his house.

491
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,575
- Is he here?
- No.

492
00:24:47,576 --> 00:24:49,022
What do you need Ben for?

493
00:24:49,023 --> 00:24:51,628
I want him to tell me where
that loan shark lives

494
00:24:51,629 --> 00:24:53,946
- so I can go to his house.
- To do what?

495
00:24:53,947 --> 00:24:56,221
I don't know. May-maybe
I'll give him some money.

496
00:24:56,222 --> 00:24:57,948
Maybe I'll kill him.
I haven't decided yet.

497
00:24:57,949 --> 00:24:59,688
Okay, sweetie, you're a little worked up.

498
00:24:59,689 --> 00:25:01,504
Sit down. I'll pour you a glass of wine.

499
00:25:01,505 --> 00:25:04,345
No, I have to fix this. I'm terrified.

500
00:25:04,346 --> 00:25:06,049
I haven't slept in days.

501
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:09,192
And my husband is walking
around our house with a gun.

502
00:25:09,316 --> 00:25:10,787
Ooh, sorry.

503
00:25:10,887 --> 00:25:12,436
Why are you apologizing?

504
00:25:12,437 --> 00:25:14,692
Mike's the one who started this mess.

505
00:25:14,843 --> 00:25:17,183
You mean when he stuck
his neck out for Ben

506
00:25:17,184 --> 00:25:20,092
and protected me? Is that
the mess you're talking about?

507
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:24,240
Look, when you've been burned
by men as often as I have,

508
00:25:24,241 --> 00:25:27,548
you stop believing in that fairy tale idea

509
00:25:27,549 --> 00:25:30,609
of the guy on the white horse
who comes in to save you.

510
00:25:31,146 --> 00:25:35,430
But... meeting Mike and
seeing how he is as a husband

511
00:25:35,431 --> 00:25:38,233
and a father and a friend,

512
00:25:38,807 --> 00:25:42,347
well... he got me believing again.

513
00:25:44,082 --> 00:25:44,816
Susan...

514
00:25:44,817 --> 00:25:47,208
he is a good man.

515
00:25:49,453 --> 00:25:50,806
You really think that?

516
00:25:50,807 --> 00:25:53,408
Or are you just trying to calm me down?

517
00:25:53,436 --> 00:25:54,899
I really think that.

518
00:25:55,526 --> 00:25:57,598
And I really wanna calm you down.

519
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:59,213
So if I pour this glass of wine,

520
00:25:59,214 --> 00:26:01,867
will you not go and kill anyone?

521
00:26:03,112 --> 00:26:04,368
Okay.

522
00:26:04,825 --> 00:26:06,046
Okay.

523
00:26:11,935 --> 00:26:15,395
Bree! How you doing? Karen's taking a nap.

524
00:26:15,396 --> 00:26:17,111
Actually, it's you I wanna talk to.

525
00:26:17,112 --> 00:26:18,321
May I come in?

526
00:26:18,588 --> 00:26:19,762
Sure.

527
00:26:23,745 --> 00:26:25,580
Mmm! That pie smells wonderful.

528
00:26:25,581 --> 00:26:28,087
Yeah. Karen made rhubarb.
I don't know why.

529
00:26:28,088 --> 00:26:29,673
She knows I don't like it.

530
00:26:29,674 --> 00:26:30,568
How could you not like it?

531
00:26:30,569 --> 00:26:32,997
It's the one pie
she makes better than I do.

532
00:26:32,998 --> 00:26:35,391
Well, may I cut you a slice?

533
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,568
Sure.

534
00:26:37,227 --> 00:26:38,423
So...

535
00:26:39,157 --> 00:26:40,445
What's going on?

536
00:26:41,414 --> 00:26:44,536
We have a real problem on our hands.

537
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,861
I can't believe she asked you to do this.

538
00:26:50,862 --> 00:26:52,143
She doesn't even like you.

539
00:26:52,144 --> 00:26:54,124
Yes, we've established that already.

540
00:26:54,125 --> 00:26:56,763
I figured when I said no,
that would be the end of it.

541
00:26:56,764 --> 00:26:59,318
No, she seems more determined than ever.

542
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:01,288
What the hell are you doing?!

543
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:02,362
What?

544
00:27:02,363 --> 00:27:04,282
That's my suicide pie.

545
00:27:04,388 --> 00:27:07,268
Your what? I made it to kill myself.

546
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:10,138
It's full of sleeping
pills and tranquilizers,

547
00:27:10,139 --> 00:27:11,859
and a bottle of liquid something.

548
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:15,349
Oh, my god. I ate two pieces!

549
00:27:15,495 --> 00:27:17,201
Oh, I'm so sorry, Bree.

550
00:27:19,088 --> 00:27:20,694
So you wanna go to
the hospital or somethin'?

551
00:27:20,695 --> 00:27:22,897
Yes, I wanna go to the hospital!

552
00:27:25,932 --> 00:27:29,510
What were you doing making suicide pies?

553
00:27:29,511 --> 00:27:31,817
Well, if you two would grow
a pair and help me out...

554
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:34,005
Oh, sure, I'm the problem

555
00:27:34,006 --> 00:27:35,954
because I didn't wanna murder my wife.

556
00:27:35,955 --> 00:27:37,565
Can we please continue this in the car?

557
00:27:37,566 --> 00:27:38,445
In case you've forgotten,

558
00:27:38,446 --> 00:27:41,182
we need to get to the emergency room now!

559
00:27:43,834 --> 00:27:45,725
What are you doing?
You're going the wrong way.

560
00:27:45,726 --> 00:27:47,561
She can't make a 3-point turn.

561
00:27:47,562 --> 00:27:49,024
I can make a 3-point turn.

562
00:27:49,025 --> 00:27:50,298
This is just easier.

563
00:27:50,299 --> 00:27:51,916
Okay, can we just please stay focused

564
00:27:51,917 --> 00:27:53,077
on getting to the hospital?

565
00:27:53,078 --> 00:27:54,938
And F.Y.I.... your turn signal is on.

566
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:57,280
Yeah, I'm gonna make
a left up on Oakhurst.

567
00:27:57,281 --> 00:27:58,430
You're not gonna take the interstate?

568
00:27:58,431 --> 00:28:00,677
- Wouldn't that be faster?
- She can't merge.

569
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:04,188
I can merge. The interstate
is always jammed.

570
00:28:04,189 --> 00:28:05,427
Plus I gotta stop and get gas.

571
00:28:05,428 --> 00:28:08,558
Okay, that's it. Stop! Stop the car!

572
00:28:13,428 --> 00:28:14,664
Ugh!

573
00:28:15,504 --> 00:28:17,282
Get out! I'm driving.

574
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:20,510
There's no need to get so nasty.

575
00:28:20,511 --> 00:28:22,375
I have every right to get nasty.

576
00:28:22,376 --> 00:28:23,692
You poisoned me!

577
00:28:23,693 --> 00:28:25,902
Making that pie was a stupid thing to do.

578
00:28:25,903 --> 00:28:28,198
You have no idea what I'm going through.

579
00:28:28,199 --> 00:28:29,693
Oh, yes, I do.

580
00:28:29,983 --> 00:28:32,843
Three months ago, I was this
close to killing myself.

581
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:35,320
It was a quick fix on
a very depressing night.

582
00:28:35,321 --> 00:28:36,912
But in the morning, I realized

583
00:28:36,913 --> 00:28:39,251
it was the most selfish thing I could do.

584
00:28:39,418 --> 00:28:43,198
It's not the same.
You weren't dying. I am.

585
00:28:43,199 --> 00:28:44,323
I know.

586
00:28:44,324 --> 00:28:47,069
But if you take your life,
it'll ruin the memory

587
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,921
of everything you were before that.

588
00:28:48,922 --> 00:28:51,334
It's all anyone will remember.

589
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:53,537
Look at Roy.

590
00:28:53,538 --> 00:28:55,814
Is that what you wanna do
to the man who loves you?

591
00:28:55,815 --> 00:28:59,931
Baby, I don't want you
to go before your time.

592
00:29:03,014 --> 00:29:04,299
Okay.

593
00:29:04,524 --> 00:29:06,906
I'll stick around for as long as I can.

594
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,351
Ohh, that's lovely,

595
00:29:13,352 --> 00:29:15,961
but we still need to get
to the emergency room.

596
00:29:16,295 --> 00:29:18,052
Oh, for heaven's sake.

597
00:29:31,866 --> 00:29:33,147
It's open!

598
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,505
Ah.

599
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,797
What are you gonna share with me today?

600
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,207
The results from my colonoscopy?

601
00:29:42,466 --> 00:29:43,734
My mom died?

602
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:46,358
I shouldn't have said what I did.

603
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,996
It was wrong, and I'm truly sorry.

604
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,497
Are those the cheese puffs I brought?

605
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:02,344
Yeah. I guess nobody liked 'em.

606
00:30:03,598 --> 00:30:04,952
Well, more for me.

607
00:30:07,735 --> 00:30:12,477
23 years I've been married
to that man. 23 years.

608
00:30:12,572 --> 00:30:15,199
And then we hit a rough patch,
and we stumbled,

609
00:30:15,595 --> 00:30:17,864
- and then he finds you...
- I totally get it.

610
00:30:17,865 --> 00:30:19,442
I'm talking!

611
00:30:21,805 --> 00:30:23,304
He finds you,

612
00:30:23,938 --> 00:30:28,528
and it kind of makes him
stop trying to find me again.

613
00:30:30,462 --> 00:30:32,030
And then when someone has to tell me

614
00:30:32,031 --> 00:30:33,672
that you're moving in together,

615
00:30:33,673 --> 00:30:36,145
and we both know what that means,

616
00:30:37,581 --> 00:30:38,756
you do it.

617
00:30:39,173 --> 00:30:40,545
I said I'm sorry.

618
00:30:40,546 --> 00:30:42,995
And it almost sounded sincere.

619
00:30:46,775 --> 00:30:49,534
Fine. Have it your way.

620
00:30:49,535 --> 00:30:52,789
I only came because Tom
asked me to apologize.

621
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:54,394
I don't care what you think of me.

622
00:30:54,395 --> 00:30:56,474
Of course you don't.
You only care about you.

623
00:30:57,418 --> 00:30:59,368
I think you're sneaky, Jane.

624
00:31:00,794 --> 00:31:02,994
I think everything you do,
you do on purpose.

625
00:31:02,995 --> 00:31:05,859
I think you couldn't wait
to see the look on my face

626
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:08,253
when you told me you and Tom
were moving in together.

627
00:31:08,254 --> 00:31:09,963
I think you actually liked it.

628
00:31:09,964 --> 00:31:13,315
I think you enjoyed it. I-I think...

629
00:31:33,202 --> 00:31:35,195
What the hell?

630
00:31:35,196 --> 00:31:36,673
I couldn't breathe!

631
00:31:36,776 --> 00:31:39,475
I-I'm sorry. I panicked, and I mean,

632
00:31:40,145 --> 00:31:42,089
n-not all of us are doctors.

633
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:46,482
I think I'll go.

634
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:11,887
Hey, Murphy.

635
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:12,858
Yeah?

636
00:32:12,859 --> 00:32:14,466
You better take a look at this.

637
00:32:18,972 --> 00:32:20,551
Some crazy stuff in there, huh?

638
00:32:20,552 --> 00:32:21,632
Yeah.

639
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,138
Any chance this could be on the level?

640
00:32:25,173 --> 00:32:26,780
Bree van De Kamp.

641
00:32:27,106 --> 00:32:30,227
I know her. She's the one who
ripped Chuck's heart out.

642
00:32:32,606 --> 00:32:34,098
I got a feeling about this.

643
00:32:35,303 --> 00:32:38,089
Enough of a feeling to go
dig up a construction site?

644
00:32:41,571 --> 00:32:42,739
Yeah.

645
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,376
Are you sure you looked under your bed?

646
00:32:49,377 --> 00:32:51,682
I looked everywhere. Rufus is lost.

647
00:32:51,683 --> 00:32:53,155
Okay. Honey, mommy can't
help you right now.

648
00:32:53,156 --> 00:32:54,526
Go look in the backyard.

649
00:32:56,742 --> 00:32:58,757
So just you, or did
you adopt a bunch of orphans

650
00:32:58,758 --> 00:32:59,939
on your way home?

651
00:33:04,922 --> 00:33:07,178
Come on, Carlos. Talk to me.

652
00:33:07,179 --> 00:33:08,700
What was that about today?

653
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,117
Do you remember Bill,

654
00:33:11,118 --> 00:33:13,560
that guy from rehab I was
always talking about?

655
00:33:13,561 --> 00:33:14,862
Oh, yeah, Bill.

656
00:33:16,355 --> 00:33:18,000
He was my counselor?

657
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:20,653
Oh. Yeah. Bill.

658
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:24,129
He told me this story about his dad.

659
00:33:24,976 --> 00:33:26,803
He was a pilot in Vietnam,

660
00:33:27,571 --> 00:33:28,992
and he'd be flying his plane,

661
00:33:28,993 --> 00:33:32,494
3,000 feet up, drop his bombs,
go back to base.

662
00:33:32,992 --> 00:33:35,386
It wasn't until someone
sent him a "Life" magazine

663
00:33:35,387 --> 00:33:37,291
that he saw the results of his...

664
00:33:39,433 --> 00:33:40,932
missions.

665
00:33:42,163 --> 00:33:43,481
It ruined him.

666
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:44,861
What, he didn't know?

667
00:33:44,862 --> 00:33:47,381
He was dropping bombs.
Things were going "Boom."

668
00:33:47,382 --> 00:33:48,807
It was the distance.

669
00:33:49,583 --> 00:33:52,776
And that's what I've been
doing all these years...

670
00:33:52,777 --> 00:33:55,244
dropping bombs from that skyscraper,

671
00:33:55,245 --> 00:33:57,971
and I can't keep doing it.

672
00:33:58,356 --> 00:34:02,534
I can't keep destroying lives for some...

673
00:34:04,163 --> 00:34:05,442
bottom line.

674
00:34:10,308 --> 00:34:13,903
Rufus! Here, kitty, kitty!

675
00:34:20,713 --> 00:34:23,125
So what are you saying,
you're gonna quit your job?

676
00:34:23,126 --> 00:34:24,371
Yes.

677
00:34:24,406 --> 00:34:25,611
Oh, my god.

678
00:34:26,438 --> 00:34:28,064
But not until I find a new one.

679
00:34:28,065 --> 00:34:29,528
And what will that be?

680
00:34:29,529 --> 00:34:31,296
Well, I was thinking...

681
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:34,242
maybe counseling.

682
00:34:34,818 --> 00:34:36,721
In one week, Bill does more good

683
00:34:36,722 --> 00:34:38,223
than I've done in my entire life.

684
00:34:38,224 --> 00:34:39,788
Yeah, and in one week, you make more money

685
00:34:39,789 --> 00:34:41,695
than Bill will make in his entire life.

686
00:34:41,907 --> 00:34:44,429
I'm not saying that
we wouldn't have to cut back.

687
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:46,253
You know, we may have to
do a little downsizing.

688
00:34:46,254 --> 00:34:49,827
Whoa! Whoa! Like what?
I need specifics, Gandhi.

689
00:34:50,184 --> 00:34:51,271
I don't know!

690
00:34:51,272 --> 00:34:53,440
It just seems like
we have a bunch of stuff

691
00:34:53,441 --> 00:34:56,858
That we don't need...
big-screen TVs, two cars,

692
00:34:56,859 --> 00:34:58,493
a really big house.

693
00:34:58,512 --> 00:35:00,269
Well, you want us to move?

694
00:35:00,396 --> 00:35:03,235
Yeah! Maybe to someplace
with a good public school.

695
00:35:03,236 --> 00:35:05,885
Uh, not you're yanking
the kids out of private school,

696
00:35:05,885 --> 00:35:08,315
which they love, that's your solution?

697
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,301
Help! Help!

698
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,579
Juanita?

699
00:35:15,481 --> 00:35:16,676
Juanita?

700
00:35:16,854 --> 00:35:18,092
Mommy!

701
00:35:21,713 --> 00:35:22,866
Oh, my god!

702
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:26,194
Okay. Baby, don't move!

703
00:35:26,648 --> 00:35:27,801
I'm scared!

704
00:35:27,851 --> 00:35:30,613
It's okay, sweetie!
Daddy's coming. Just hold on.

705
00:35:31,454 --> 00:35:32,696
Aah!

706
00:35:33,028 --> 00:35:34,238
And don't look down.

707
00:35:38,649 --> 00:35:39,988
Okay, baby,

708
00:35:40,548 --> 00:35:42,875
you think you can walk
slowly over to daddy?

709
00:35:42,908 --> 00:35:45,309
No. I-I can't move.

710
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,754
Okay, then I'm coming out to get you.

711
00:35:46,755 --> 00:35:48,737
No, wait, Carlos! Be careful!

712
00:35:54,128 --> 00:35:55,597
We are gonna take this...

713
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,458
nice and slow.

714
00:35:59,701 --> 00:36:01,088
Okay, just keep your eyes on me.

715
00:36:14,541 --> 00:36:15,694
Oh, my god!

716
00:36:15,866 --> 00:36:18,030
It's okay, it's okay.
I got you. I got you.

717
00:36:36,629 --> 00:36:38,432
Juanita's finally asleep.

718
00:36:40,142 --> 00:36:41,360
She okay?

719
00:36:42,225 --> 00:36:44,172
Yeah, thanks to you.

720
00:36:44,173 --> 00:36:45,760
God, that was so scary.

721
00:36:47,317 --> 00:36:48,691
You know, if anything
had happened to her...

722
00:36:48,692 --> 00:36:51,174
It really puts things into
perspective, doesn't it?

723
00:36:52,037 --> 00:36:53,326
Sure does.

724
00:36:54,664 --> 00:36:56,011
Reminds you nothing's more important

725
00:36:56,012 --> 00:36:57,719
than taking care of family.

726
00:36:58,861 --> 00:37:00,501
I could not agree more.

727
00:37:01,772 --> 00:37:02,984
Good.

728
00:37:04,009 --> 00:37:05,191
So does this mean you're giving up

729
00:37:05,192 --> 00:37:08,183
all that crazy talk and
going back to work?

730
00:37:09,463 --> 00:37:10,664
No!

731
00:37:12,754 --> 00:37:14,417
The exact opposite.

732
00:37:14,418 --> 00:37:18,373
It means I'm more aware than
ever of what really matters...

733
00:37:18,374 --> 00:37:19,565
giving back.

734
00:37:19,566 --> 00:37:21,249
Why do you keep calling it that?

735
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:24,211
You're not giving. You're taking...
from us, your family.

736
00:37:24,212 --> 00:37:26,369
I don't know why I thought
you'd understand this.

737
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:28,218
You have always been selfish.

738
00:37:28,219 --> 00:37:30,133
Guilty! I am selfish.

739
00:37:30,134 --> 00:37:31,581
But you knew that when we got married.

740
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:32,558
That was the deal...

741
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:34,134
You make the money, I spend it.

742
00:37:34,135 --> 00:37:35,567
And I'm still holding up my end.

743
00:37:35,568 --> 00:37:39,786
Gaby, I am miserable at work.
I can't do it anymore.

744
00:37:39,787 --> 00:37:41,813
Do you know how many times
I thought to myself,

745
00:37:41,814 --> 00:37:43,478
"I can't do it anymore"?

746
00:37:43,479 --> 00:37:45,739
When you were drowning
your guilt in booze,

747
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:48,073
when you disappeared in rehab,

748
00:37:48,074 --> 00:37:50,404
But I willed myself to
hold this family together

749
00:37:50,405 --> 00:37:52,270
because someone had to!

750
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:53,969
And guess what?!

751
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,866
Now it is your turn.

752
00:38:12,752 --> 00:38:14,479
I've got something to tell you.

753
00:38:14,601 --> 00:38:18,200
Oh. You're still mad, aren't you?

754
00:38:18,952 --> 00:38:20,227
No.

755
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:23,768
You're a hard guy to stay mad at,
Mike Delfino.

756
00:38:24,459 --> 00:38:26,519
And I think I figured out why.

757
00:38:27,737 --> 00:38:33,109
I figured out what it was about you

758
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:36,968
that flipped my switch
the very first time I met you.

759
00:38:37,558 --> 00:38:39,788
Gotta be the rugged good looks.

760
00:38:39,789 --> 00:38:43,159
No. But they didn't hurt.

761
00:38:46,439 --> 00:38:49,029
Okay. So what was it?

762
00:38:51,768 --> 00:38:53,226
You don't get scared.

763
00:38:53,751 --> 00:38:54,707
Me?

764
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:55,507
Nah, that's not true.

765
00:38:55,508 --> 00:38:58,502
No, it is. You don't get scared.

766
00:38:59,262 --> 00:39:02,005
It's what everyone thinks
when they meet you.

767
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,089
Because you always take care of people.

768
00:39:09,828 --> 00:39:11,183
Why are you like that?

769
00:39:12,672 --> 00:39:13,843
Hmm.

770
00:39:16,565 --> 00:39:18,987
Uh, my, um...

771
00:39:20,652 --> 00:39:23,832
my dad beat the crap out of my mom

772
00:39:25,245 --> 00:39:26,439
when I was little.

773
00:39:27,912 --> 00:39:29,158
Bad.

774
00:39:32,729 --> 00:39:34,113
I'd hear it happening.

775
00:39:36,059 --> 00:39:36,814
And there wasn't anything

776
00:39:36,815 --> 00:39:39,118
a 10-year-old kid could do about it.

777
00:39:45,194 --> 00:39:46,488
So...

778
00:39:46,677 --> 00:39:49,573
maybe this came from that, and, uh...

779
00:39:50,065 --> 00:39:53,667
but... my whole life...

780
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:56,994
when I see somebody in trouble,

781
00:39:58,372 --> 00:39:59,759
I can't walk away.

782
00:40:05,146 --> 00:40:07,396
But I can tell you
something I am scared of.

783
00:40:08,729 --> 00:40:12,284
I get scared that maybe somehow...

784
00:40:13,653 --> 00:40:17,064
because I'm not the most
expressive guy in the world...

785
00:40:19,241 --> 00:40:23,626
maybe I never made it clear
to you how much I love you.

786
00:40:26,288 --> 00:40:27,576
No.

787
00:40:28,365 --> 00:40:29,929
No, I got that.

788
00:40:40,106 --> 00:40:42,098
I should start dinner.

789
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:50,173
I thought you said you were
gonna fix that fence post.

790
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:53,250
Tomorrow.

791
00:40:53,424 --> 00:40:55,240
Ohh, tomorrow.

792
00:40:58,583 --> 00:40:59,753
Hey.

793
00:41:01,128 --> 00:41:02,085
One more thing.

794
00:41:02,086 --> 00:41:03,403
Delfino!

795
00:41:13,112 --> 00:41:16,713
<i>We all take the gift of life for granted.</i>

796
00:41:17,196 --> 00:41:20,765
<i>If only we could slow things down.</i>

797
00:41:21,939 --> 00:41:23,402
I'm Mike Delfino.

798
00:41:23,403 --> 00:41:25,471
I just started renting
the Simms' house next door.

799
00:41:25,472 --> 00:41:27,929
Susan Mayer. I live across the street.

800
00:41:28,439 --> 00:41:32,121
- Whatcha doin'?
- Locked myself out, naked.

801
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:33,692
So how are you?

802
00:41:33,742 --> 00:41:35,892
I've never seen you look so beautiful.

803
00:41:38,674 --> 00:41:40,221
He said I'm pregnant.

804
00:41:47,185 --> 00:41:48,451
Mike?

805
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:05,286
<i>Because before you know it...</i>

806
00:42:09,908 --> 00:42:11,625
<i>the gift is gone.</i>

807
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:14,830
Mike. Mike? Oh, god.

808
00:42:14,831 --> 00:42:17,047
Mike! No.

809
00:42:17,048 --> 00:42:20,196
No. Mike. No.

810
00:42:21,224 --> 00:42:22,453
No!

811
00:42:24,171 --> 00:42:25,433
Mike!

812
00:42:28,541 --> 00:42:30,852
No!

813
00:42:32,245 --> 00:42:35,668
