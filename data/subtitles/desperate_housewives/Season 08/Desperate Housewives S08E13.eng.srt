1
00:00:00,162 --> 00:00:02,383
<i>Previously on...</i>

2
00:00:02,384 --> 00:00:03,890
I'm done feeling sorry for myself.

3
00:00:03,891 --> 00:00:05,746
<i>Lynette made an announcement.</i>

4
00:00:05,747 --> 00:00:07,615
I need to start dating again.

5
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:11,074
- <i>But her first attempt...</i>
- Oh, the salmon looks good.

6
00:00:11,075 --> 00:00:12,082
At a steak house?

7
00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:13,775
<i>Was a disaster.</i>

8
00:00:14,562 --> 00:00:16,630
<i>The stress of covering up a crime...</i>

9
00:00:16,631 --> 00:00:19,100
You told us that as long as
we trusted each other,

10
00:00:19,101 --> 00:00:21,597
everything would be fine.
You're on your own!

11
00:00:21,598 --> 00:00:24,414
<i>Drove a wedge between
Bree and her friends...</i>

12
00:00:24,415 --> 00:00:27,407
A night out is exactly what
you need to lift your spirits.

13
00:00:27,408 --> 00:00:29,949
<i>Leading her back to an old addiction</i>

14
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,051
<i>and down a very dangerous path.</i>

15
00:00:38,494 --> 00:00:41,963
<i>Being in love can bring
out the worst in people.</i>

16
00:00:42,735 --> 00:00:44,939
<i>They may become stingy...</i>

17
00:00:47,022 --> 00:00:48,571
<i>or hostile...</i>

18
00:00:51,839 --> 00:00:54,104
<i>or simply indifferent.</i>

19
00:00:56,587 --> 00:01:00,471
<i>But in the beginning when
love is still a promise,</i>

20
00:01:01,052 --> 00:01:04,040
<i>people bring their best to the table.</i>

21
00:01:04,236 --> 00:01:05,655
Here's to second chances.

22
00:01:06,356 --> 00:01:09,822
Oh, here's to you for
giving me a second chance.

23
00:01:11,621 --> 00:01:14,499
I really... didn't expect you
to be so nice on the phone.

24
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,712
I guess you were charmed by my groveling.

25
00:01:18,419 --> 00:01:20,142
But now I'm kind of in a pickle.

26
00:01:20,675 --> 00:01:21,698
I spent the last week complaining

27
00:01:21,699 --> 00:01:23,244
about the crazy bitch I went out with.

28
00:01:23,245 --> 00:01:24,971
Now I have to go back and tell everyone

29
00:01:24,972 --> 00:01:27,033
this is one of the best dates of my life.

30
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,903
Aw, that's so sweet.

31
00:01:29,904 --> 00:01:32,077
Ah, not so fast.
We haven't had dessert yet.

32
00:01:32,256 --> 00:01:33,337
We still could blow it.

33
00:01:33,338 --> 00:01:35,849
Oh. I hadn't thought of that.

34
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,183
Well... how about we get outta here?

35
00:01:38,859 --> 00:01:40,454
We would have dessert at my place.

36
00:01:40,843 --> 00:01:42,119
That sounds great.

37
00:01:44,731 --> 00:01:46,490
So I have half an apple pie.

38
00:01:46,491 --> 00:01:48,294
I've got some of those
little pudding cups,

39
00:01:48,295 --> 00:01:50,175
and I think there are
some ice cream sandwiches

40
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:51,404
in the freezer.

41
00:01:53,283 --> 00:01:57,087
Come on. Who can resist a pudding cup?

44
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,508
for... dessert.

45
00:02:06,745 --> 00:02:08,610
Oh. Dessert.

46
00:02:08,611 --> 00:02:09,970
You thought I meant...

47
00:02:09,971 --> 00:02:11,551
Sex.

48
00:02:12,067 --> 00:02:15,986
Right. That's... why
you ran all those red lights.

49
00:02:15,987 --> 00:02:17,606
I figured you had a sweet tooth.

50
00:02:17,607 --> 00:02:18,706
Yeah.

51
00:02:20,695 --> 00:02:22,515
So just the three choices?

52
00:02:25,366 --> 00:02:26,596
I think so.

53
00:02:28,601 --> 00:02:30,791
Don't get me wrong.
I love dessert... both kinds.

54
00:02:30,792 --> 00:02:32,181
It's just so soon,

55
00:02:32,424 --> 00:02:34,040
and it's only our second date.

56
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:35,742
Only the first one that's gone well...

57
00:02:35,743 --> 00:02:37,155
I get it. No problem.

58
00:02:37,156 --> 00:02:40,133
Plus there's a certain...
amount of prep work involved

59
00:02:40,134 --> 00:02:41,601
that I would have done had I known

60
00:02:41,602 --> 00:02:44,402
we were thinking of...
and I didn't make my bed,

61
00:02:44,403 --> 00:02:45,859
and there are no clean towels.

62
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,184
I misunderstood.

63
00:02:48,516 --> 00:02:49,735
And now I've made you feel uncomfortable.

64
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:51,250
- I'm so sorry.
- No.

65
00:02:52,503 --> 00:02:53,699
We had a great night.

66
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:54,933
Yes.

67
00:02:54,934 --> 00:02:56,359
I look forward to doing it again.

68
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,568
Oh, yes. Sounds good.

69
00:02:58,569 --> 00:02:59,651
Okay.

70
00:03:01,463 --> 00:03:03,274
Just... please don't think that this means

71
00:03:03,275 --> 00:03:05,598
I never wanna have sex with you,
'cause you're great,

72
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,909
and-and sex is great. I love sex.

73
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,595
I always have. I was
a total whore in college.

74
00:03:13,043 --> 00:03:15,918
All right, well,
I guess this is good night, then.

75
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:17,467
Okay. Good night.

76
00:03:17,854 --> 00:03:22,538
<i>Yes, the promise of love can
bring out the best in us...</i>

77
00:03:23,207 --> 00:03:28,065
<i>unless we find that we're
a little out of practice.</i>

78
00:03:41,511 --> 00:03:42,974
<i>After a disaster,</i>

79
00:03:42,975 --> 00:03:46,347
<i>every housewife has her own way of coping.</i>

80
00:03:47,806 --> 00:03:49,723
<i>Some turn to drink...</i>

81
00:03:52,302 --> 00:03:54,458
<i>some turn to sweets...</i>

82
00:03:56,623 --> 00:04:00,859
<i>and some turn to
the people they trust the most.</i>

83
00:04:02,015 --> 00:04:03,845
So then I said I'd love
to have sex with him,

84
00:04:03,846 --> 00:04:05,201
but I'm not sure I'm ready yet,

85
00:04:05,202 --> 00:04:08,098
and now we're going to have
this awkward thing hanging over us.

86
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:10,993
Nobody expects you to hop right
into bed with someone new.

87
00:04:10,994 --> 00:04:12,447
Why not? Tom did.

88
00:04:14,052 --> 00:04:15,651
I'm just trying to motivate her.

89
00:04:15,652 --> 00:04:17,168
To do what?

90
00:04:17,476 --> 00:04:20,384
Have random sex with
the first guy she meets?

91
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:21,534
You don't wanna be that girl.

92
00:04:21,535 --> 00:04:24,429
Yeah, because that
sounds like too much fun.

93
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,126
Susan, Lynette is pushing 50.

94
00:04:26,127 --> 00:04:28,578
With a very long stick.

95
00:04:28,579 --> 00:04:30,419
Point is, she should be
out there getting some

96
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,499
while she's still limber
enough to enjoy it.

97
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,303
Are you supposed to be on my side here?

98
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,583
Of course.

99
00:04:35,748 --> 00:04:38,864
First things first...
do you really like this guy?

100
00:04:39,829 --> 00:04:41,409
Yeah, I think I do.

101
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:42,770
Then what's the problem?

102
00:04:42,771 --> 00:04:44,454
Well, for starters, I'm a little rusty.

103
00:04:44,455 --> 00:04:45,639
It's been a while.

104
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,396
The last guy who saw me naked

105
00:04:47,431 --> 00:04:50,180
told me not to wait so
long between pap smears.

106
00:04:51,147 --> 00:04:53,653
Okay, you're putting too
much pressure on yourself,

107
00:04:53,654 --> 00:04:55,016
and if you really like this guy,

108
00:04:55,017 --> 00:04:56,302
you should take it slow.

109
00:04:56,303 --> 00:04:57,614
Yeah, but not too slow.

110
00:04:57,615 --> 00:04:58,646
You're starting a new relationship,

111
00:04:58,647 --> 00:05:00,342
and sex is a big part of it.

112
00:05:00,343 --> 00:05:02,494
You don't buy a car without
giving it a test drive.

113
00:05:02,495 --> 00:05:05,179
So drive this guy, Lynette.
Drive him hard.

114
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:10,174
So... how much longer is
Carlos gonna be in rehab?

115
00:05:10,175 --> 00:05:11,595
14 1/2 days.

116
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,370
I don't know. The first time with somebody

117
00:05:13,371 --> 00:05:15,662
is always awkward and weird.

118
00:05:15,663 --> 00:05:18,123
And exciting and great.

119
00:05:18,991 --> 00:05:20,198
Come on. In 20 years of marriage,

120
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:22,623
you never fantasized about
being with someone else.

121
00:05:22,624 --> 00:05:24,940
Constantly. Sometimes during.

122
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,507
Well, here's your chance.

123
00:05:26,766 --> 00:05:30,707
Huh. I guess this is the upside
to having your marriage collapse.

124
00:05:30,743 --> 00:05:34,883
Okay. I just have to figure
out how to make my first move.

125
00:05:36,648 --> 00:05:38,643
I know who could give you some tips.

126
00:05:41,335 --> 00:05:43,075
Oh, my god. Is that another one?

127
00:05:43,191 --> 00:05:45,771
I know. What happened to
the blond guy from last week?

128
00:05:45,772 --> 00:05:48,697
Blond guy? The guy I saw had
dark hair and a sports car.

129
00:05:48,698 --> 00:05:50,602
The guy I saw drove a motorcycle.

130
00:05:50,603 --> 00:05:52,599
What is that, five guys in a week?

131
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,676
Is she starting a basketball team?

132
00:05:56,728 --> 00:05:58,531
Should we be worried about her?

133
00:05:58,663 --> 00:06:00,804
After the way she treated us, unh-unh.

134
00:06:00,984 --> 00:06:03,108
She's not our problem anymore.

135
00:06:07,927 --> 00:06:09,972
Who are these women staring at us?

136
00:06:12,711 --> 00:06:14,083
Nobody I know.

137
00:06:16,984 --> 00:06:19,791
Juanita, why do you insist on
giving out Valentine cupcakes

138
00:06:19,792 --> 00:06:21,882
when I bought you a box
of perfectly good cards?

139
00:06:21,883 --> 00:06:23,584
Store-bought cards are lame.

140
00:06:23,585 --> 00:06:25,706
Who cares? I could be
watching TV right now

141
00:06:25,707 --> 00:06:28,679
instead of trying to cram the name
"Harrison" onto a cupcake.

142
00:06:29,115 --> 00:06:32,582
I wish daddy was here.
He always helps me with stuff.

143
00:06:33,963 --> 00:06:35,434
You really miss him, huh?

144
00:06:35,435 --> 00:06:38,998
Yeah. Why'd he have to go
to stupid Europe, anyway?

145
00:06:40,187 --> 00:06:42,590
Well, you know, business
trips are very important.

146
00:06:42,591 --> 00:06:45,916
That's why they call them...
business trips.

147
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:47,409
But he's never been gone this long.

148
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:48,798
It feels like forever.

149
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:50,922
I know, but when he gets home,

150
00:06:50,923 --> 00:06:52,564
everything's gonna be great again.

151
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,555
Do you have any more of those sprinkles?

152
00:06:56,697 --> 00:06:59,524
You're spending a lot of
time on that one cupcake.

153
00:06:59,525 --> 00:07:00,979
Is it for someone special?

154
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,704
No, it's for nobody.

155
00:07:03,908 --> 00:07:05,525
Juanita, what's his name?

156
00:07:05,526 --> 00:07:06,583
He doesn't have a name.

157
00:07:06,584 --> 00:07:09,059
Ha! So you admit he exists.

158
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,361
Fine.

159
00:07:11,362 --> 00:07:13,216
His name is Ryan Vayo.

160
00:07:13,217 --> 00:07:16,110
He's so cool. He can
dislocate his shoulder

161
00:07:16,111 --> 00:07:18,571
so it looks like he was in a car accident.

162
00:07:18,943 --> 00:07:21,814
Mm. You and me... we go for the bad boys.

163
00:07:21,815 --> 00:07:24,838
So I just want it to be special.
Do you think that's dumb?

164
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:28,546
No. I think you need more candy hearts.

165
00:07:34,991 --> 00:07:36,854
Hey, I've been, uh,
I've been meaning to ask.

166
00:07:36,855 --> 00:07:38,212
Do we have any cereal?

167
00:07:38,311 --> 00:07:39,763
It's for Julie.

168
00:07:40,247 --> 00:07:41,668
For the rest of her life?

169
00:07:41,943 --> 00:07:42,664
When she was a kid,

170
00:07:42,665 --> 00:07:45,942
our favorite thing was
to have cereal dinner.

171
00:07:45,943 --> 00:07:48,154
But I couldn't remember her favorite,
so I got 'em all.

172
00:07:48,155 --> 00:07:50,239
I can't believe it's been six months

173
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,358
since she's been home.

174
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:52,778
Yeah. Why the visit?

175
00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:54,593
I think she just misses her mom.

176
00:07:54,594 --> 00:07:56,622
She sounded a little blue on the phone.

177
00:07:56,738 --> 00:07:58,926
Well, we should think of
some stuff to cheer her up.

178
00:07:59,249 --> 00:08:00,895
Way ahead of you.

179
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:02,698
We are gonna do all the things

180
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:04,407
she loved to do when she was a kid.

181
00:08:04,408 --> 00:08:07,362
Oh, hey. Do we still have
that trampoline in the garage?

182
00:08:07,363 --> 00:08:09,975
She would jump on that thing for hours.

183
00:08:09,976 --> 00:08:11,479
I would be up in my room, reading,

184
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,559
and her head would keep
popping up in the window.

185
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,070
"Hi, mom. Hi, mom. Hi, mom."

186
00:08:16,071 --> 00:08:18,489
- Hi, mom.
- Oh! Julie.

187
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,403
Hi. Hey, Mike.

188
00:08:20,404 --> 00:08:21,949
Hey, kiddo. You look great.

189
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:24,894
Oh, you do. You look wonderful.

190
00:08:24,895 --> 00:08:26,266
Can I get you something?

191
00:08:26,511 --> 00:08:27,769
Uh, yeah, sure, some water.

192
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,367
Oh. Here.

193
00:08:29,368 --> 00:08:31,842
We are gonna have so much fun this week.

194
00:08:31,843 --> 00:08:33,323
I thought we'd start at the amusement park

195
00:08:33,324 --> 00:08:35,896
with some high-risk roller coastering.

196
00:08:36,507 --> 00:08:38,475
Uh... Susan?

197
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,798
And then I am gonna take you

198
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:42,978
to my kick-ass kickboxing class.

199
00:08:43,142 --> 00:08:44,937
Yeah... uh, babe?

200
00:08:44,938 --> 00:08:45,589
And to top it off,

201
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:47,832
Mike is gonna dig out that
trampoline so that you can...

202
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,253
Oh, my god!

203
00:08:51,144 --> 00:08:52,260
Yeah.

204
00:08:52,808 --> 00:08:54,932
I don't think we're gonna
be needing that trampoline.

205
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:04,919
Oh, my god.

206
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,316
You're... pregnant.

207
00:09:07,703 --> 00:09:10,403
Yeah. Six months.

208
00:09:12,407 --> 00:09:15,635
You didn't even tell me
you were in a relationship.

209
00:09:17,336 --> 00:09:19,092
Oh, god.

210
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,524
Is there something wrong with the guy?

211
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,797
I'm gonna hate him, aren't I?

212
00:09:22,798 --> 00:09:26,458
No, 'cause... you're not gonna meet him.

213
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:30,123
It was just kind of a casual thing,

214
00:09:30,124 --> 00:09:33,721
and he's not really interested
in following through.

215
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,944
I was right. I do hate him.

216
00:09:37,036 --> 00:09:38,633
And you're okay with that?

217
00:09:39,068 --> 00:09:40,487
Mm, yeah.

218
00:09:40,924 --> 00:09:42,536
Yeah, I am.

219
00:09:42,668 --> 00:09:44,345
Then we are, too.

220
00:09:45,324 --> 00:09:46,456
Of course.

221
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,368
And we are gonna be here for you.

222
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:50,819
You can move back home,

223
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,520
and Mike and I will help
take care of the baby.

224
00:09:53,523 --> 00:09:55,618
Oh, my god. I can't
believe I didn't even ask.

225
00:09:55,619 --> 00:09:57,775
Is it a boy or a girl?

226
00:09:58,610 --> 00:09:59,950
It doesn't matter.

227
00:10:01,586 --> 00:10:03,342
I'm giving it up for adoption.

228
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:05,295
What?

229
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:07,354
No, you're not.

230
00:10:07,355 --> 00:10:09,318
Mom, look at my life.

231
00:10:09,563 --> 00:10:11,141
I-I live in a crappy apartment.

232
00:10:11,142 --> 00:10:13,644
I'm working part-time
while I finish my PhD.

233
00:10:13,645 --> 00:10:15,753
But you always said you wanted children.

234
00:10:15,754 --> 00:10:17,606
Yeah, with a husband.

235
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:20,734
I'm not in a place to do this right now.

236
00:10:20,735 --> 00:10:25,067
No, no, no. Slow down.
We need to think this through.

237
00:10:25,119 --> 00:10:26,490
I already have.

238
00:10:27,454 --> 00:10:28,841
And I'm working with this agency,

239
00:10:28,842 --> 00:10:30,605
and they set up a meeting
with a great couple

240
00:10:30,606 --> 00:10:32,410
who doesn't live too far from here.

241
00:10:32,926 --> 00:10:34,395
Oh, god.

242
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,618
I'm supposed to meet them tomorrow night,

243
00:10:36,974 --> 00:10:40,523
and they wanna meet you, too,
to learn about my background.

244
00:10:41,184 --> 00:10:45,402
So that's why you came home...
not just to break my heart.

245
00:10:48,254 --> 00:10:52,189
Okay, well, guess what?
No one is meeting anyone,

246
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:55,179
- and no one is going to give away this baby.
- Susan.

247
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,640
Mom, you just said you'd be there for me.

248
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:00,663
I really need your support.

249
00:11:02,688 --> 00:11:03,741
Please?

250
00:11:07,008 --> 00:11:10,844
Okay, I'll do it.
We'll have them over for dinner.

251
00:11:12,736 --> 00:11:13,837
Thank you.

252
00:11:17,521 --> 00:11:19,932
Happy sucky Valentine's day.

253
00:11:20,672 --> 00:11:22,158
What happened?

254
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:23,980
Ryan didn't like your cupcake?

255
00:11:25,295 --> 00:11:28,509
He ate it, but he didn't
even give me a card.

256
00:11:28,592 --> 00:11:31,067
Oh, who cares about him?

257
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:34,028
Plenty of other people
gave you Valentines.

258
00:11:34,239 --> 00:11:35,899
Like Jacob.

259
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,413
"Dear Juanita, my parents...
made me write this.

260
00:11:39,414 --> 00:11:41,122
"You smell like ham."

261
00:11:43,046 --> 00:11:44,482
Well, you like ham.

262
00:11:45,111 --> 00:11:47,813
I like Ryan. Why doesn't he like me?

263
00:11:47,814 --> 00:11:49,186
What's wrong with me?

264
00:11:49,271 --> 00:11:52,963
Nothing is wrong with you.
You are wonderful. Come here.

265
00:11:58,075 --> 00:12:01,735
Hey, sweetie, are you sure
Ryan didn't give you a card?

266
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:03,349
Yeah.

267
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,863
Maybe you should
double-check your backpack.

268
00:12:05,864 --> 00:12:07,958
He could have slipped it in
when you weren't looking.

269
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:09,364
Why would he do that?

270
00:12:09,783 --> 00:12:12,419
Boys are weird. Take a look.

271
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,631
Pen, pen, pen, pen.

272
00:12:21,531 --> 00:12:22,534
No.

273
00:12:36,346 --> 00:12:37,235
What are you doing?

274
00:12:37,236 --> 00:12:41,167
Nothing. Hey, what's, uh, what's that?

275
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:42,512
What?

276
00:12:42,707 --> 00:12:45,168
That thing that just fell
out of your backpack.

277
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,979
Oh, my god. Oh, my god! It's from him.

278
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,192
"Happy Valentine's day. X.O.X.O. Ryan."

279
00:12:54,195 --> 00:12:55,379
What's "X.O.X.O."?

280
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,088
Hugs and kisses.

281
00:12:57,427 --> 00:13:01,247
Hugs and kisses? Oh, he does like me.

282
00:13:02,163 --> 00:13:03,362
I'm going to call him.

283
00:13:03,363 --> 00:13:04,401
No, no, no, you can't do that!

284
00:13:04,402 --> 00:13:06,425
- Don't do that!
- And why not?

285
00:13:06,426 --> 00:13:10,861
Because boys don't like it
when girls tell them they like them.

286
00:13:11,616 --> 00:13:12,782
Then how will he know?

287
00:13:12,783 --> 00:13:14,465
Oh, sweetie, he knows, you know,

288
00:13:14,466 --> 00:13:16,206
so neither of you need to say it.

289
00:13:16,207 --> 00:13:18,009
It's much more romantic this way.

290
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:20,190
I'm serious. Don't talk to him, ever.

291
00:13:20,191 --> 00:13:21,866
It'll wreck the relationship.

292
00:13:22,527 --> 00:13:23,859
But... if we don't talk,

293
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,745
what kind of relationship is that?

294
00:13:25,812 --> 00:13:28,113
The very best kind.

295
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:30,560
Oh, my god. Is this...

296
00:13:33,347 --> 00:13:36,384
chocolate? He's perfect!

297
00:13:39,908 --> 00:13:42,049
Susan, this was delicious.

298
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:44,415
Ah, just a little something I whipped up.

299
00:13:44,706 --> 00:13:47,909
A toast to Julie and Susan for inviting us

300
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,207
into your beautiful home,

301
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:52,131
and offering us this amazing gift of life.

302
00:13:57,862 --> 00:13:59,379
You're not drinking, Debbie?

303
00:13:59,511 --> 00:14:03,859
Oh. I'm abstaining in a show
of solidarity with Julie.

304
00:14:04,263 --> 00:14:06,199
I may not be able to carry my own baby,

305
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,692
but I can support the woman who is.

306
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:11,845
Oh, that's sweet. But word of advice...

307
00:14:11,846 --> 00:14:15,170
drop that plan when the doctor
starts talking episiotomy.

308
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:22,234
Susan, I can't believe how great
you're being about this.

309
00:14:22,782 --> 00:14:25,563
It's wonderful that
your mother is so supportive.

310
00:14:25,934 --> 00:14:28,658
Yeah, well, she understands
how this is going to be

311
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,414
so much better for everyone.

312
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:34,130
Absolutely. Can't think of
a better home for this baby

313
00:14:34,131 --> 00:14:35,806
than with the two of you.

314
00:14:40,802 --> 00:14:43,926
Julie, do you mind getting the dessert?

315
00:14:43,927 --> 00:14:45,186
Oh, sure.

316
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,227
And, Debbie, if you're
peeing in solidarity with me,

317
00:14:48,228 --> 00:14:50,529
then, uh, that's where
I'll be heading first.

318
00:14:53,381 --> 00:14:55,480
You have done an incredible job with her.

319
00:14:55,481 --> 00:14:56,969
She seems great.

320
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:00,466
Yeah. She's having one of her good days.

321
00:15:03,351 --> 00:15:04,742
Her good days?

322
00:15:04,743 --> 00:15:05,679
Yeah.

323
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:11,187
Seems Dr. Cohen finally got
her meds perfectly balanced.

324
00:15:11,271 --> 00:15:13,635
It's why I'm letting her
use a knife tonight.

325
00:15:13,767 --> 00:15:17,303
Wait. Meds? She never mentioned anything

326
00:15:17,304 --> 00:15:19,175
on her application about...

327
00:15:19,176 --> 00:15:20,740
Mental illness?

328
00:15:22,392 --> 00:15:23,572
Yeah.

329
00:15:23,928 --> 00:15:27,722
Grandma used to say our family
tree grew nothing but bananas...

330
00:15:29,903 --> 00:15:31,610
before she hung herself.

331
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:36,258
I think legally she had
to disclose this to us.

332
00:15:36,259 --> 00:15:38,694
Oh, don't talk to Julie about legal.

333
00:15:38,695 --> 00:15:42,307
Then we'll have to see
all of her jail tattoos.

334
00:15:43,178 --> 00:15:44,262
Bill?

335
00:15:44,938 --> 00:15:49,206
Um... what else didn't she tell us?

336
00:15:49,722 --> 00:15:50,982
I don't know.

337
00:15:52,554 --> 00:15:55,450
Did she tell you she can hold her hand

338
00:15:55,451 --> 00:15:58,520
over an open flame without crying?

339
00:15:58,828 --> 00:15:59,942
Yeah, her eyes water,

340
00:15:59,943 --> 00:16:02,355
but she just keeps laughing and laughing.

341
00:16:05,846 --> 00:16:07,522
But it's not all her fault.

342
00:16:07,542 --> 00:16:09,318
I should've stopped drinking
when I was pregnant,

343
00:16:09,319 --> 00:16:11,475
but I likes my wine.

344
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:16,994
I'm back. Who's ready for dessert?

345
00:16:25,974 --> 00:16:27,251
You don't have to do that.

346
00:16:32,456 --> 00:16:34,068
Still not talking to me, huh?

347
00:16:34,456 --> 00:16:36,643
I'm channeling my anger into cleaning.

348
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,385
Well, I was going to apologize,

349
00:16:38,386 --> 00:16:41,294
but maybe I should wait until
you tackle the bathroom.

350
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,239
You do realize that
scaring those people off

351
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,627
doesn't change anything.

352
00:16:47,847 --> 00:16:50,838
I'm healthy. I'm white.
I'm a year away from my PhD.

353
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:53,059
You can't imagine how many
people want this baby.

354
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:56,051
Including me.

355
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,347
I'm sorry. It's my grandchild.

356
00:17:01,927 --> 00:17:05,895
And I know that you think
you have thought this all out,

357
00:17:05,896 --> 00:17:09,010
but until you have held
that baby in your arms,

358
00:17:09,011 --> 00:17:11,503
yu have no idea what you're giving up.

359
00:17:12,008 --> 00:17:12,685
I'm going to bed.

360
00:17:12,686 --> 00:17:15,863
No, please, hear me out.

361
00:17:16,522 --> 00:17:18,984
You're scared. I get it.

362
00:17:19,116 --> 00:17:20,515
But you can do this.

363
00:17:20,516 --> 00:17:22,415
I don't wanna be a single mother!

364
00:17:22,932 --> 00:17:24,541
Why can't you respect that?

365
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:27,466
It's not so bad being a single mother.

366
00:17:27,471 --> 00:17:29,097
We had a great time.

367
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:31,258
We were like best friends.

368
00:17:31,358 --> 00:17:33,967
Remember? We would have cereal for dinner,

369
00:17:33,968 --> 00:17:36,089
and we'd stay up in my bed all night,

370
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:38,214
telling each other our secrets.

371
00:17:38,288 --> 00:17:40,267
It's funny you remember it that way,

372
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,139
because I don't.

373
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,152
I was 12, mom.

374
00:17:46,796 --> 00:17:49,009
I slept in your bed because
you couldn't handle

375
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:50,862
looking at the empty side.

376
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,654
And how about those fun
drives past dad's apartment

377
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:55,683
to see if he was bringing anyone home?

378
00:17:56,311 --> 00:17:58,753
And the only reason we had cereal dinner

379
00:17:58,754 --> 00:18:00,509
was because that's
the only food I could make,

380
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,602
since you were too upset to cook.

381
00:18:11,886 --> 00:18:13,002
I...

382
00:18:14,878 --> 00:18:16,330
I had no idea.

383
00:18:17,871 --> 00:18:21,293
That is why I don't wanna
have this baby on my own.

384
00:18:23,167 --> 00:18:25,050
Because I already raised a child...

385
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,323
you.

386
00:18:48,183 --> 00:18:50,418
What are you staring at?

387
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:52,515
Shh. Don't talk.

388
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:54,164
Why not?

389
00:18:54,165 --> 00:18:56,370
You'll ruin our relationship.

390
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:59,187
Oh, we don't have a relationship.

391
00:18:59,318 --> 00:19:01,986
Right, that's why you gave me the X-O's.

392
00:19:02,869 --> 00:19:04,819
X-O's? what's that mean?

393
00:19:04,955 --> 00:19:06,071
I'll show you.

394
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:09,907
Sexual harassment? Are you kidding me?

395
00:19:09,908 --> 00:19:11,338
She's a 9-year-old with a crush,

396
00:19:11,339 --> 00:19:13,286
not a presidential hopeful.

397
00:19:13,658 --> 00:19:15,401
Regardless, here at Oakridge,

398
00:19:15,402 --> 00:19:19,745
we have a zero tolerance
policy for unwanted advances.

399
00:19:19,746 --> 00:19:23,253
Honey, I was a model.
I know all about unwanted advances.

400
00:19:23,254 --> 00:19:26,323
Try being being stuck in a limo
with a tipsy David Lee Roth.

401
00:19:26,983 --> 00:19:30,725
Your daughter forced this boy
to the ground and kissed him

402
00:19:30,726 --> 00:19:32,294
against his will.

403
00:19:32,295 --> 00:19:34,858
Oh, and we all know how
much boys hate being kissed.

404
00:19:34,859 --> 00:19:37,149
He cried for 20 minutes.

405
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,910
He could barely tell me what happened.

406
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,810
Oh, so he's a snitch and a crybaby.

407
00:19:40,811 --> 00:19:42,871
That kid's not gonna last
a day in high school.

408
00:19:43,871 --> 00:19:47,317
Mrs. Solis, I don't think
you realize the gravity

409
00:19:47,318 --> 00:19:48,899
of this situation.

410
00:19:48,983 --> 00:19:51,861
I mean, it's not like when we were kids.

411
00:19:51,862 --> 00:19:55,603
Hey, hey, cotton top,
you and I are not the same age.

412
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,914
You need to talk to your daughter,

413
00:19:59,355 --> 00:20:01,381
because if she so much as glances

414
00:20:01,382 --> 00:20:03,003
in that boy's direction again,

415
00:20:03,004 --> 00:20:06,579
we will have no choice but to expel her.

416
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,238
Hi.

417
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:30,869
I don't usually do this,

418
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,774
but I'm feeling rather bold tonight.

419
00:20:32,775 --> 00:20:34,156
Can I buy you a drink?

420
00:20:36,448 --> 00:20:37,433
Sure.

421
00:20:38,664 --> 00:20:41,362
Matt, drink for my friend here.

422
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:42,912
What's your poison?

423
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,181
Whiskey, straight up.

424
00:20:45,504 --> 00:20:47,359
I'm Bree, by the way.

425
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:51,980
Jerry.

426
00:20:51,981 --> 00:20:54,355
- Jerry.
- Nice to meet you, Jerry.

427
00:20:57,814 --> 00:20:59,022
Not much of a talker, huh?

428
00:20:59,023 --> 00:21:01,747
Well, that's okay.
I will ask all the questions.

429
00:21:03,016 --> 00:21:04,702
What do you do for a living, Jerry?

430
00:21:05,384 --> 00:21:06,556
I'm a roofer.

431
00:21:07,463 --> 00:21:09,548
Same thing I was two nights ago

432
00:21:11,045 --> 00:21:12,483
when you took me home.

433
00:21:14,925 --> 00:21:16,030
Jerry.

434
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,958
Jerry, I'm so sorry. Ohh!

435
00:21:18,959 --> 00:21:20,474
It's just so dark in here, And I...

436
00:21:20,475 --> 00:21:24,787
It's okay. It happens,
especially with this crowd.

437
00:21:27,344 --> 00:21:32,000
Well, I can assure you that
I will not forget you twice.

438
00:21:35,813 --> 00:21:38,759
Is there, uh, any way
I can make it up to you?

439
00:21:39,201 --> 00:21:40,424
Well, I, uh...

440
00:21:41,595 --> 00:21:43,569
I do remember the other night.

441
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,771
Mm?

442
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:47,688
And, yeah, you have several ways.

443
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:52,420
Well, then, um...

444
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:56,741
let's not waste any time.

445
00:22:23,044 --> 00:22:26,776
Hey, kid. Want a beer? Oh, right.

446
00:22:28,904 --> 00:22:30,294
Thanks.

447
00:22:32,894 --> 00:22:35,749
It's so weird to remember
being a kid here and...

448
00:22:37,025 --> 00:22:38,189
now to be...

449
00:22:39,384 --> 00:22:40,428
Yeah, I'll bet.

450
00:22:40,889 --> 00:22:42,608
Imagine how weird it is for your mom.

451
00:22:43,694 --> 00:22:44,747
I get that.

452
00:22:46,294 --> 00:22:47,686
I just wish she'd...

453
00:22:47,687 --> 00:22:49,121
Julie, if you're about to wish

454
00:22:49,122 --> 00:22:52,047
that your mom would stop trying
to figure out your life for you,

455
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:54,192
you're about to waste a wish.

456
00:22:56,253 --> 00:22:58,876
Sounded like you were kinda
rough on her last night.

457
00:23:00,449 --> 00:23:01,528
I was.

458
00:23:02,845 --> 00:23:04,160
She told you, huh?

459
00:23:04,826 --> 00:23:07,237
The fact that she didn't tell
me is how I knew it was rough.

460
00:23:08,314 --> 00:23:09,779
I was just really angry.

461
00:23:10,353 --> 00:23:12,062
It's like she doesn't
realize this whole thing

462
00:23:12,063 --> 00:23:13,836
is killing me, too.

463
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:15,657
No, believe me, she does.

464
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,885
That's why she won't stay out of it.

465
00:23:18,973 --> 00:23:21,151
Well, it's not making it any easier on me.

466
00:23:24,705 --> 00:23:26,289
When it comes to her kids,

467
00:23:26,455 --> 00:23:28,780
your mom has one gear, Julie...

468
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:31,505
love. That's it.

469
00:23:32,153 --> 00:23:34,558
And if you sort through
all the times in your life

470
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,143
that she drove you nuts,

471
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:39,346
what she did, what she said,
or how she acted...

472
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:41,908
you're gonna find love.

473
00:23:45,271 --> 00:23:46,361
I know.

474
00:23:49,113 --> 00:23:52,496
And... as far as flaws in a mom go...

475
00:23:54,013 --> 00:23:55,325
that's a pretty good one.

476
00:24:04,701 --> 00:24:05,480
What's the big deal?

477
00:24:05,481 --> 00:24:07,196
I kissed him. It's a free country.

478
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:09,541
Well, some people at school
think that's inappropriate

479
00:24:09,542 --> 00:24:10,964
to do on the playground.

480
00:24:11,752 --> 00:24:15,714
Oh. Well, I know a spot at
the park where we can kiss.

481
00:24:15,715 --> 00:24:18,288
No, no, no, no kissing Ryan anywhere.

482
00:24:18,893 --> 00:24:20,518
But that's how it works.

483
00:24:20,784 --> 00:24:22,915
First, kissing, then get married,

484
00:24:22,916 --> 00:24:24,439
then he buys me presents.

485
00:24:24,714 --> 00:24:26,671
Oh, my god. You are my daughter.

486
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,145
Honey...

487
00:24:30,566 --> 00:24:34,280
Uh, I don't think Ryan
likes you like that.

488
00:24:34,449 --> 00:24:36,529
What do you mean? He sent me a Valentine.

489
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:40,701
Actually, he didn't.

490
00:24:41,832 --> 00:24:42,940
I did.

491
00:24:46,125 --> 00:24:49,413
I signed his name, and I let
you think it was from him.

492
00:24:51,952 --> 00:24:53,470
It's just when
you didn't get a Valentine,

493
00:24:53,471 --> 00:24:55,201
you seemed so upset,

494
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,247
and I just wanted to see you happy again.

495
00:25:01,387 --> 00:25:02,753
I'm sorry, Juanita.

496
00:25:02,754 --> 00:25:05,381
I hate seeing you sad like this.

497
00:25:06,431 --> 00:25:08,102
I'm not sad. I'm mad.

498
00:25:08,912 --> 00:25:10,320
You always lie to me.

499
00:25:11,099 --> 00:25:12,489
I don't lie to you.

500
00:25:12,939 --> 00:25:14,847
Okay, then, where's daddy?

501
00:25:16,945 --> 00:25:18,630
'Cause I know he's not in Europe.

502
00:25:20,346 --> 00:25:21,527
How do you know that?

503
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:24,799
I can tell. I'm not a kid anymore.

504
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,590
I know when you're hiding stuff.

505
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,317
Well...

506
00:25:31,745 --> 00:25:33,881
you're growing up so fast.

507
00:25:36,978 --> 00:25:38,738
Oh, honey, a part of me still sees you

508
00:25:38,739 --> 00:25:43,091
as this cute little baby
I used to bathe in the sink.

509
00:25:45,927 --> 00:25:48,640
But every day you're getting
stronger and smarter.

510
00:25:50,706 --> 00:25:54,233
So maybe I don't need to
protect you quite so much.

511
00:25:57,628 --> 00:25:59,383
Why don't we get some cupcakes?

512
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:02,094
You and I are gonna have a little talk.

513
00:26:10,422 --> 00:26:11,461
Mom...

514
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,254
what are you doing?

515
00:26:13,428 --> 00:26:15,648
Don't worry. I'm putting them away.

516
00:26:17,726 --> 00:26:18,812
Aw.

517
00:26:19,863 --> 00:26:21,029
Remember these?

518
00:26:21,245 --> 00:26:23,213
No, mom, I was 1.

519
00:26:24,761 --> 00:26:26,441
I had a pair that matched.

520
00:26:26,981 --> 00:26:28,721
People would always look at us.

521
00:26:29,228 --> 00:26:32,168
Because you were a grown woman
in pink striped overalls.

522
00:26:32,234 --> 00:26:34,737
They probably thought we were
a christian singing group.

523
00:26:35,622 --> 00:26:38,413
They'd say we looked sweet together.

524
00:26:39,803 --> 00:26:41,997
I wouldn't trade that memory for anything.

525
00:26:48,331 --> 00:26:50,110
I know this is hard.

526
00:26:51,661 --> 00:26:54,184
And I'm really sorry for
the way I went off on you.

527
00:26:54,185 --> 00:26:58,034
No. I'm the one who should apologize.

528
00:26:59,412 --> 00:27:02,757
I had no right to lie to those people.

529
00:27:05,712 --> 00:27:10,009
And I know that I made mistakes
with you... a lot of them.

530
00:27:14,103 --> 00:27:16,208
I guess I just told myself it was okay

531
00:27:16,209 --> 00:27:18,576
because you turned out so great.

532
00:27:22,461 --> 00:27:24,238
You did the best you could.

533
00:27:25,917 --> 00:27:27,041
I know that.

534
00:27:29,605 --> 00:27:31,035
You're a great mom.

535
00:27:37,306 --> 00:27:39,040
I'd do it again in a heartbeat.

536
00:27:42,769 --> 00:27:44,983
Because no matter how hard it was...

537
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:50,040
you're always the best thing in my life.

538
00:27:51,956 --> 00:27:56,951
Mom, I've given this a lot of thought.

539
00:28:01,226 --> 00:28:03,521
And it's the toughest decision

540
00:28:03,522 --> 00:28:04,976
I've ever had to make.

541
00:28:09,089 --> 00:28:10,411
But I've made it.

542
00:28:13,749 --> 00:28:14,928
I understand.

543
00:28:19,345 --> 00:28:21,601
I'm just trying to do what's best for her.

544
00:28:23,811 --> 00:28:24,832
"Her"?

545
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,564
It's a girl.

546
00:28:40,979 --> 00:28:41,962
Hey, you.

547
00:28:41,963 --> 00:28:44,203
Sorry I'm late. Stupid traffic.

548
00:28:45,029 --> 00:28:47,076
We should get a move on
if we're gonna make our reservations.

549
00:28:47,077 --> 00:28:49,420
No. No, no, we have time. Come on in.

550
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:53,492
So can I, um, get you
anything before we go?

551
00:28:53,493 --> 00:28:55,785
Coffee or a drink or...

552
00:28:57,458 --> 00:28:58,516
Dessert?

553
00:28:59,011 --> 00:29:01,468
Dessert? We haven't eaten yet.

554
00:29:01,469 --> 00:29:05,018
I know. I'm talking about... dessert.

555
00:29:06,118 --> 00:29:07,710
I'm not falling for this again.

556
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,060
Are you talking about...

557
00:29:09,061 --> 00:29:12,196
Sex. I'm talking about sex.
Would you like to have sex?

558
00:29:12,656 --> 00:29:14,302
- Now?
- Mm.

559
00:29:14,424 --> 00:29:16,140
You said the kids are
at your ex's all night.

560
00:29:16,141 --> 00:29:17,696
We could still go to dinner.

561
00:29:17,697 --> 00:29:18,557
No, no, no, no,

562
00:29:18,558 --> 00:29:20,071
'cause then It'll be hanging
over our heads all night,

563
00:29:20,072 --> 00:29:21,248
and I'll be drinking too much

564
00:29:21,249 --> 00:29:23,539
and laughing too hard at your jokes,

565
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,217
and I really don't have any more reasons,

566
00:29:25,218 --> 00:29:27,068
so could we please just go have sex?

567
00:29:36,763 --> 00:29:37,982
Mmm.

568
00:29:40,283 --> 00:29:42,399
I was kinda hoping that
we could leave that on.

569
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,227
Five kids. Trust me. It's better off.

570
00:29:45,228 --> 00:29:46,579
Oh, you have nothing to worry about.

571
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,108
You look amazing.

572
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,193
Tell you what.

573
00:29:53,685 --> 00:29:55,532
I turn the bedside lamp on,

574
00:29:55,984 --> 00:29:57,528
and you get the candles.

575
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,583
How about... I'll see your bedside lamp...

576
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:04,295
and I'll raise you..

577
00:30:04,296 --> 00:30:05,164
A floor lamp?

578
00:30:05,165 --> 00:30:07,430
Unh-unh. Floor lamp's out.

579
00:30:07,851 --> 00:30:09,902
I'm not going over 25 watts.

580
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:11,874
Uh, how about...

581
00:30:11,875 --> 00:30:14,808
closet light on...

582
00:30:15,116 --> 00:30:17,493
and I'll crack the door, and...

583
00:30:20,663 --> 00:30:21,812
you...

584
00:30:22,911 --> 00:30:24,283
get to keep the candles?

585
00:30:26,002 --> 00:30:29,194
Sorry. That's as high
as I can go this round.

586
00:30:34,592 --> 00:30:35,839
Then I'm all in.

587
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,201
Oh!

588
00:30:38,357 --> 00:30:39,478
Lynette?

589
00:30:39,479 --> 00:30:40,693
Sweetheart?

590
00:30:42,358 --> 00:30:43,589
What is going on?

591
00:30:43,693 --> 00:30:45,399
I couldn't understand your message.

592
00:30:47,335 --> 00:30:48,800
That's what you left on my machine.

593
00:30:48,801 --> 00:30:51,091
Can you use your words, please?

594
00:30:52,305 --> 00:30:55,149
Is this about your date
with Frank last night?

595
00:30:55,532 --> 00:30:58,090
Grunt once for a "Yes," twice for "No."

596
00:30:59,408 --> 00:31:00,850
Did you have sex with him?

597
00:31:02,406 --> 00:31:03,508
Sort of.

598
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:05,472
Sort of? What does that mean?

599
00:31:06,291 --> 00:31:07,622
I don't wanna talk about it.

600
00:31:08,565 --> 00:31:10,174
This is ridiculous.

601
00:31:10,175 --> 00:31:13,414
You called me over.
Now tell me what happened.

602
00:31:16,613 --> 00:31:17,924
I cried.

603
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:21,871
Oh, no. When? After?

604
00:31:22,009 --> 00:31:23,712
Right in the middle.

605
00:31:24,661 --> 00:31:27,978
God. Is there any way he didn't notice?

606
00:31:27,979 --> 00:31:31,045
I blew my nose in the sheets.

607
00:31:31,552 --> 00:31:33,000
Kinda hard to ignore.

608
00:31:34,169 --> 00:31:35,641
What made you cry?

609
00:31:37,743 --> 00:31:40,419
I opened my eyes, and-and I saw him...

610
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,695
this lovely man I have
a really nice time with...

611
00:31:42,696 --> 00:31:44,167
and I realized...

612
00:31:44,812 --> 00:31:46,514
my marriage is over.

613
00:31:46,865 --> 00:31:47,795
Now didn't you realize that

614
00:31:47,796 --> 00:31:49,933
when Tom took his girlfriend to Europe?

615
00:31:49,964 --> 00:31:52,039
No, I didn't,

616
00:31:52,252 --> 00:31:56,174
because that was Tom, and I kept thinking,

617
00:31:56,183 --> 00:32:00,250
"Boy, Tom's moving on," but this is me.

618
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:03,116
This is really happening to me.

619
00:32:11,178 --> 00:32:12,802
Love bites, doesn't it?

620
00:32:14,216 --> 00:32:16,853
What did, uh, Frank do?

621
00:32:17,211 --> 00:32:18,530
He was really sweet.

622
00:32:18,531 --> 00:32:22,078
Handed me a box of kleenex,
said all the right things.

623
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:25,327
But trust me, I'm never seeing him again.

624
00:32:26,898 --> 00:32:28,588
Well, think of it this way.

625
00:32:29,124 --> 00:32:31,638
It cost you one guy to face the truth.

626
00:32:32,154 --> 00:32:33,824
Your marriage is over.

627
00:32:34,929 --> 00:32:37,259
Now you can move on just like Tom.

628
00:32:38,925 --> 00:32:40,511
Yippee for me.

629
00:32:41,004 --> 00:32:42,046
Mm-hmm.

630
00:32:43,199 --> 00:32:45,004
I'm gonna tell you
the same thing I told Bree

631
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:46,388
when I took her out drinking.

632
00:32:46,389 --> 00:32:50,697
The only way to live life is wildly.

633
00:32:53,434 --> 00:32:54,449
What?

634
00:32:54,569 --> 00:32:56,468
You took Bree out drinking?

635
00:32:56,658 --> 00:32:58,168
Yeah. Why?

636
00:32:58,885 --> 00:32:59,912
Is that bad?

637
00:33:00,149 --> 00:33:01,866
How the hell could Renee
take her out drinking?!

638
00:33:01,867 --> 00:33:04,433
Doesn't she know Bree's an alcoholic?

639
00:33:04,434 --> 00:33:06,162
I have known Renee a long time,

640
00:33:06,163 --> 00:33:09,082
and she's not exactly what
you'd call a detail person.

641
00:33:09,083 --> 00:33:11,063
Well... at least this helps explain

642
00:33:11,064 --> 00:33:13,068
The way Bree's been acting lately.

643
00:33:13,069 --> 00:33:15,228
I don't know. There's not
enough booze in the world

644
00:33:15,229 --> 00:33:17,747
to justify the skeezes
coming out of that house.

645
00:33:17,748 --> 00:33:19,568
How could we not know this?

646
00:33:19,569 --> 00:33:21,030
'Cause we're not speaking to her,

647
00:33:21,031 --> 00:33:22,991
you know, 'cause of what she did.

648
00:33:22,992 --> 00:33:25,385
I was so mad. I thought
I'd stay mad a long time,

649
00:33:25,386 --> 00:33:27,920
but now, knowing that she's hurting...

650
00:33:27,921 --> 00:33:29,222
It just seems mean.

651
00:33:29,576 --> 00:33:30,661
Yeah.

652
00:33:31,413 --> 00:33:34,807
I miss her. I miss us being us.

653
00:33:35,418 --> 00:33:37,423
So whatever happened,
we need to put it behind us

654
00:33:37,424 --> 00:33:38,720
and go help Bree.

655
00:33:40,175 --> 00:33:41,606
Do you think we can get through to her?

656
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:44,101
I don't know, but we have to try.

657
00:33:52,573 --> 00:33:55,374
Uh, you sure this is your house?

658
00:33:59,856 --> 00:34:01,162
What the hell?

659
00:34:01,653 --> 00:34:04,626
Wow. Booze, loose morals,
and now swearing?

660
00:34:04,689 --> 00:34:06,345
Too late. There's no Bree left.

661
00:34:06,352 --> 00:34:07,804
Why are you in my house?

662
00:34:07,805 --> 00:34:09,841
This is an intervention, Bree.

663
00:34:10,068 --> 00:34:13,154
This isn't for TV, is it?
'cause I'm married.

664
00:34:13,334 --> 00:34:14,061
I was gonna tell you.

665
00:34:14,062 --> 00:34:16,545
An intervention?
You've gotta be kidding me.

666
00:34:16,546 --> 00:34:18,729
We're your friends. We wanna help.

667
00:34:18,842 --> 00:34:20,771
Get out! All of you!

668
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:23,516
Not you.

669
00:34:25,203 --> 00:34:26,216
Idiot.

670
00:34:26,477 --> 00:34:28,780
Talk to us, sweetie.
Why are you behaving like this?

671
00:34:28,781 --> 00:34:30,384
I don't know what you're talking about.

672
00:34:30,385 --> 00:34:32,475
It's not like we can't
see what's going on.

673
00:34:32,662 --> 00:34:34,591
We know you're drinking again.

674
00:34:35,686 --> 00:34:37,952
And what about all these men?
We know about that, too.

675
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:41,185
Wow, can't hide anything
from you girls, huh?

676
00:34:43,233 --> 00:34:45,781
And did you also know
I tried to kill myself?

677
00:34:47,115 --> 00:34:48,124
What?

678
00:34:48,529 --> 00:34:49,626
Oh, my god.

679
00:34:49,785 --> 00:34:51,695
How'd that little nugget of information

680
00:34:51,696 --> 00:34:55,289
slip past my nearest and dearest friends?

681
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:58,039
If this is a joke, it's not funny.

682
00:34:58,227 --> 00:34:59,499
It's not a joke.

683
00:35:00,908 --> 00:35:02,565
I checked into a motel room

684
00:35:02,566 --> 00:35:05,817
with nothing but a bottle and a gun.

685
00:35:06,384 --> 00:35:08,731
And you're wrong, Susan. It is funny...

686
00:35:08,764 --> 00:35:13,665
funny that the women
standing here before me...

687
00:35:14,966 --> 00:35:17,617
professing to be my supportive friends...

688
00:35:18,942 --> 00:35:21,722
are the reason
that I was in that motel room.

689
00:35:21,782 --> 00:35:22,539
Bree, stop.

690
00:35:22,541 --> 00:35:24,998
No! Don't give me this "Friends" nonsense.

691
00:35:25,059 --> 00:35:27,683
All I ever was to you was the organizer,

692
00:35:27,684 --> 00:35:29,325
the problem solver,

693
00:35:29,551 --> 00:35:31,880
a leader when you needed one,

694
00:35:32,446 --> 00:35:36,194
which is exactly what
I was that horrible night

695
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,138
when we buried your stepfather.

696
00:35:39,886 --> 00:35:41,686
And I was so grateful for that.

697
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:44,650
Liar! All of you, liars!

698
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:47,295
Because as soon as it got rough,

699
00:35:47,296 --> 00:35:49,081
as soon as there was any trouble,

700
00:35:49,907 --> 00:35:51,465
it all became my fault,

701
00:35:51,466 --> 00:35:52,919
and off you went.

702
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:56,213
We had no idea.
I wish you would have told us.

703
00:35:56,214 --> 00:35:57,399
Oh, I tried.

704
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,982
But even when I came to you to apologize,

705
00:35:59,983 --> 00:36:02,762
you slammed your doors in my face!

706
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:06,721
Okay, fine, you're right.

707
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:08,638
We did. We screwed up.

708
00:36:08,872 --> 00:36:10,343
We let this pull us apart,

709
00:36:10,344 --> 00:36:12,066
but that's not gonna happen again.

710
00:36:12,882 --> 00:36:14,683
Because no matter what you think,

711
00:36:14,795 --> 00:36:17,237
we love you, Bree.
We'll do whatever it takes.

712
00:36:17,238 --> 00:36:19,832
We just want things to be
back the way they were.

713
00:36:24,717 --> 00:36:25,982
Well, I don't.

714
00:36:35,813 --> 00:36:36,896
Frank.

715
00:36:37,652 --> 00:36:38,780
What's all this?

716
00:36:38,822 --> 00:36:42,030
Well, this is something
I recently discovered

717
00:36:42,031 --> 00:36:43,313
called pizza.

718
00:36:43,663 --> 00:36:44,964
I think you're gonna like it.

719
00:36:45,253 --> 00:36:48,654
I'm sorry. Did we have plans?

720
00:36:49,098 --> 00:36:51,972
Nope. This is more of a stealth date.

721
00:36:52,318 --> 00:36:54,934
Every time we made plans,
there's been too much pressure.

722
00:36:54,935 --> 00:36:57,134
So I figured, maybe things would be better

723
00:36:57,135 --> 00:36:58,514
if we sneak up on each other.

724
00:36:59,498 --> 00:37:02,147
Do you have some unresolved
mother issues or something?

725
00:37:02,373 --> 00:37:05,630
Well, actually, my mother
and I get along quite well.

726
00:37:05,631 --> 00:37:06,498
Why do you ask?

727
00:37:06,499 --> 00:37:08,537
Because that's the only
reason I can think of

728
00:37:08,538 --> 00:37:11,027
of why you would keep coming back here.

729
00:37:11,207 --> 00:37:13,912
Oh, I can think of another. I like you.

730
00:37:14,324 --> 00:37:18,074
You do remember I cried in
the middle of sex, right?

731
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,597
Lynette, you lived with
the same guy for 20 years.

732
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,362
It only makes sense that
he'd be in your head.

733
00:37:25,363 --> 00:37:28,020
And frankly, I'd think twice
about you if he weren't.

734
00:37:29,405 --> 00:37:31,659
Is it weird to say "Frankly"
When your name is Frank?

735
00:37:31,965 --> 00:37:33,164
Not until now.

736
00:37:35,809 --> 00:37:37,023
Look, I'm a guy.

737
00:37:37,709 --> 00:37:40,223
So obviously, I'm a complete idiot.

738
00:37:41,179 --> 00:37:41,984
But the one thing I do know

739
00:37:41,985 --> 00:37:44,282
is that if you're lucky
enough to meet someone

740
00:37:44,607 --> 00:37:47,441
who's sexy, smart, and funny,
and who actually likes you,

741
00:37:48,711 --> 00:37:50,580
you give that person
all the time they need.

742
00:37:53,992 --> 00:37:55,169
Now where's your corkscrew?

743
00:37:58,043 --> 00:38:00,301
Uh, middle drawer on the right.

744
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,514
Hey, hey.

745
00:38:07,847 --> 00:38:08,850
Mmm.

746
00:38:10,658 --> 00:38:13,900
Mmm. Mmm, mmm, mnh-mnh. Wait.

747
00:38:15,013 --> 00:38:16,765
I know you're more comfortable like this.

748
00:38:19,936 --> 00:38:20,949
Leave it on.

749
00:38:28,943 --> 00:38:30,308
Evening, Bree.

750
00:38:30,636 --> 00:38:31,660
The usual?

751
00:38:32,866 --> 00:38:35,461
I suppose it has become
"The usual," hasn't it?

752
00:38:37,449 --> 00:38:38,553
Yes, please.

753
00:38:42,521 --> 00:38:43,411
Hey.

754
00:38:46,447 --> 00:38:48,278
You know, I got a thing for redheads.

755
00:38:49,331 --> 00:38:50,467
Wanna see it?

756
00:38:51,425 --> 00:38:52,523
Charming.

757
00:38:54,655 --> 00:38:55,714
It's Bree, right?

758
00:38:55,858 --> 00:38:57,935
Listen, I just came here to have a drink.

759
00:38:57,936 --> 00:38:59,908
I really don't feel like talking.

760
00:38:59,909 --> 00:39:00,864
Yeah?

761
00:39:02,028 --> 00:39:04,954
Well... it wasn't the chance
to have a conversation

762
00:39:04,955 --> 00:39:06,363
that brought me over.

763
00:39:07,607 --> 00:39:08,626
I beg your pardon?

764
00:39:08,627 --> 00:39:10,821
I know what you come here for.
We can stop the game.

765
00:39:10,822 --> 00:39:11,958
We can stop everything,

766
00:39:11,959 --> 00:39:14,252
including this unfortunate encounter.

767
00:39:15,271 --> 00:39:16,725
Now please leave me alone.

768
00:39:18,999 --> 00:39:19,929
Wait.

769
00:39:20,167 --> 00:39:21,219
Wait, wait. So...

770
00:39:21,979 --> 00:39:25,228
so suddenly you're some high-class lady?

771
00:39:26,469 --> 00:39:29,073
Hmm? Give me a break.

772
00:39:30,628 --> 00:39:32,835
Everybody in this bar knows what you are.

773
00:39:35,934 --> 00:39:37,465
You want me to start a tab for you?

774
00:39:45,614 --> 00:39:46,600
No.

775
00:39:47,571 --> 00:39:49,157
No, I don't. I have to go.

776
00:39:57,596 --> 00:39:58,689
I'll drive.

777
00:40:01,205 --> 00:40:02,839
Please give me my keys.

778
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,959
Come on, Bree.

779
00:40:03,986 --> 00:40:05,910
I see some of the dirtbags
you drag out of this place.

780
00:40:05,911 --> 00:40:07,919
What? I don't make the cut?

781
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,486
No, you're vile.

782
00:40:09,487 --> 00:40:12,604
Now give me my keys and get away from me.

783
00:40:12,811 --> 00:40:15,872
Whoa. This is a new low for me.

784
00:40:15,942 --> 00:40:18,202
I'm not good enough for the town pump.

785
00:40:20,998 --> 00:40:22,175
You know what?

786
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,130
- I think we'll take my car.
- Aah!

787
00:40:26,417 --> 00:40:28,147
I'm not going anywhere with you!

788
00:40:28,208 --> 00:40:29,249
Get your hands off of me!

789
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:32,526
You like a fight, huh?
I can play rough. Aah!

790
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,022
Let go of me. Let go!

791
00:40:34,023 --> 00:40:35,242
You heard her.

792
00:40:36,482 --> 00:40:37,533
Let go.

793
00:40:39,962 --> 00:40:41,061
Orson!

794
00:40:41,213 --> 00:40:44,175
Hello, Bree. We'll catch up in a moment.

795
00:40:44,466 --> 00:40:45,725
If you're smart,

796
00:40:46,015 --> 00:40:47,248
you'll step away from her

797
00:40:47,249 --> 00:40:49,904
and go back to the hole
you crawled out of.

798
00:40:50,268 --> 00:40:52,724
Buddy, I got a rule about not
hitting guys in wheelchairs,

799
00:40:52,725 --> 00:40:55,220
but you-you're begging for an asterisk.

800
00:41:04,776 --> 00:41:05,981
Turn it off!

801
00:41:10,827 --> 00:41:12,819
I also have pepper spray.

802
00:41:16,231 --> 00:41:17,966
Orson, what are you doing here?

803
00:41:17,967 --> 00:41:19,863
- How did you...
- Your friends called me.

804
00:41:21,393 --> 00:41:23,488
They said you were going
through a rough time.

805
00:41:30,438 --> 00:41:33,163
Orson, I've made such a mess of my life.

806
00:41:35,308 --> 00:41:36,421
Don't worry, dear.

807
00:41:38,589 --> 00:41:40,384
The one thing you and
I were always good at

808
00:41:40,385 --> 00:41:42,138
was cleaning things up.

809
00:41:49,185 --> 00:41:53,061
<i>Yes, love can bring out the best in us...</i>

810
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,648
<i>the confidence to move on...</i>

811
00:42:02,778 --> 00:42:05,566
<i>the courage to tell the truth...</i>

812
00:42:09,263 --> 00:42:11,968
<i>the strength to keep hoping...</i>

813
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,982
<i>but sometimes what surprises us most</i>

814
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:22,958
<i>isn't what love brings out...</i>

815
00:42:23,876 --> 00:42:26,996
<i>but who it brings back.</i>

816
