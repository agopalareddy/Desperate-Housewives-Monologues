1
00:00:00,496 --> 00:00:02,563
<i>Previously on...</i>

2
00:00:02,888 --> 00:00:04,703
<i>After an incident at school...</i>

3
00:00:06,748 --> 00:00:09,548
<i>Gaby was forced to replace
the P.T.A. president.</i>

4
00:00:09,548 --> 00:00:10,472
Me?

5
00:00:11,775 --> 00:00:14,447
<i>Carlos was struggling with his guilt.</i>

6
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:18,639
This is not me. I can't sleep.
I'm seeing ghosts.

7
00:00:18,639 --> 00:00:19,758
I know.

8
00:00:20,176 --> 00:00:22,043
<i>Susan found a way to cope.</i>

9
00:00:22,043 --> 00:00:25,339
I'm taking a painting class
being taught by Andre Zeller.

10
00:00:25,339 --> 00:00:26,151
Great.

11
00:00:26,187 --> 00:00:29,389
<i>But the famous painter
didn't make it easy.</i>

12
00:00:29,423 --> 00:00:31,224
You're a bored housewife
trying to kill time

13
00:00:31,258 --> 00:00:34,767
between spin class and driving
your kid to soccer practice.

14
00:00:35,372 --> 00:00:38,331
<i>And Lynette discovered that
since their separation,</i>

15
00:00:38,365 --> 00:00:40,500
<i>Tom had started dating.</i>

16
00:00:40,534 --> 00:00:42,435
It's just a couple of
dinners and... coffee.

17
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:45,188
God, Tom. When were you
gonna tell me this?

18
00:00:50,482 --> 00:00:52,545
<i>In their 20 years together,</i>

19
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:56,683
<i>Tom and Lynette Scavo had
followed a few simple rules...</i>

20
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:00,587
<i>Always share the housework...</i>

21
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:06,392
<i>never waste the hot water,</i>

22
00:01:07,114 --> 00:01:10,687
<i>and never, ever go to bed angry.</i>

23
00:01:12,084 --> 00:01:15,179
<i>Yes, the rules for being
together were simple.</i>

24
00:01:15,179 --> 00:01:17,738
<i>But the rules for being apart...</i>

25
00:01:18,189 --> 00:01:20,040
<i>were anything but.</i>

26
00:01:20,768 --> 00:01:22,633
Stop calling it "Dating."

27
00:01:22,633 --> 00:01:24,399
It's dinner with a friend.

28
00:01:25,393 --> 00:01:28,200
Do not do that. Do not do the snort.

29
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,287
Could you make her stop snorting?

30
00:01:30,287 --> 00:01:32,169
Lynette, I find it more effective

31
00:01:32,169 --> 00:01:36,001
when we use words rather
than inflammatory noises.

32
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:37,460
You want words? Here are some words.

33
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,255
Liar, liar, pants on fire.

34
00:01:39,255 --> 00:01:43,180
Lobster for two at Chez nous is not
"Dinner with a friend."

35
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,879
A $300 night at Sakura

36
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:47,237
is not strapping on
a feedbag with a buddy.

37
00:01:47,778 --> 00:01:50,215
I still do our credit card bills, genius.

38
00:01:50,215 --> 00:01:51,321
All right, enough words.

39
00:01:51,321 --> 00:01:53,332
Hey, it's not like
I went looking for this.

40
00:01:53,332 --> 00:01:55,178
Jane lives in the building.
We got to talking.

41
00:01:55,178 --> 00:01:57,635
You know what?
She was actually nice to me...

44
00:02:01,761 --> 00:02:04,418
All right, emotions are
running a little hot,

45
00:02:04,418 --> 00:02:05,713
but I think I know why.

46
00:02:06,889 --> 00:02:09,194
You two embarked on this separation

47
00:02:09,194 --> 00:02:11,111
without a clear goal in mind.

48
00:02:12,045 --> 00:02:13,921
Are you trying to get back together,

49
00:02:14,414 --> 00:02:15,707
or are you trying to find

50
00:02:15,707 --> 00:02:17,753
a graceful way to end the marriage?

51
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:23,373
We don't have to decide this right now,

52
00:02:23,834 --> 00:02:28,039
but we do need to lay
down some ground rules.

53
00:02:29,521 --> 00:02:31,694
For example, are you dating?

54
00:02:32,156 --> 00:02:34,587
- He is.
- Two dinners.

55
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:36,123
All right, so you are dating.

56
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:37,507
What about sex?

57
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:43,105
No.

58
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,824
Not yet.

59
00:02:45,824 --> 00:02:47,208
I-I...

60
00:02:47,671 --> 00:02:49,581
He just answered your first question.

61
00:02:49,581 --> 00:02:51,112
He wants to end the marriage.

62
00:02:51,112 --> 00:02:52,326
No, Lynette, that's not what I'm saying.

63
00:02:52,326 --> 00:02:53,328
I'm not giving up.

64
00:02:53,328 --> 00:02:54,174
"Not yet"?

65
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:57,347
Look, I still hope that we can
find a way to work things out,

66
00:02:57,347 --> 00:02:58,362
but...

67
00:02:59,735 --> 00:03:01,722
we don't make each other happy.

68
00:03:02,484 --> 00:03:04,772
We haven't for a long time.

69
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:08,129
So what if... I mean,

70
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:10,596
what if there was someone
out there who could?

71
00:03:13,475 --> 00:03:15,463
I just feel like if we don't...

72
00:03:16,104 --> 00:03:17,560
explore...

73
00:03:18,844 --> 00:03:21,566
then we are gonna end up right
back in here, on this couch,

74
00:03:21,566 --> 00:03:23,149
hating each other.

75
00:03:25,277 --> 00:03:27,766
Sounds like you have a lot to consider.

76
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,707
There's nothing to consider.

77
00:03:30,707 --> 00:03:33,020
We're... cleared for sex.

78
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,906
Let the dating begin.

79
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:40,497
<i>Yes, Tom and Lynette were
learning the rules of separation.</i>

80
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,369
<i>And the first rule?</i>

81
00:03:42,369 --> 00:03:43,734
And I can't wait to let my new boyfriend

82
00:03:43,734 --> 00:03:45,640
do that thing I never let you do.

83
00:03:46,467 --> 00:03:48,617
<i>There are no rules.</i>

84
00:04:02,678 --> 00:04:03,463
<i>In any group,</i>

85
00:04:03,463 --> 00:04:06,639
<i>there are roles that people
are destined to play...</i>

86
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:10,423
<i>The perfect homemaker to bring the snacks,</i>

87
00:04:11,216 --> 00:04:13,965
<i>the financial wizard to keep the books...</i>

88
00:04:14,577 --> 00:04:17,637
<i>and the busybody to share the gossip.</i>

89
00:04:19,195 --> 00:04:22,256
<i>But sometimes the most
important role of all</i>

90
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,402
<i>goes to someone</i>

91
00:04:24,402 --> 00:04:26,996
<i>who's not the slightest
bit prepared for it.</i>

92
00:04:26,996 --> 00:04:30,650
Hi, guys. I know, I'm a little bit late.

93
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,485
A little? Try 45 minutes.

94
00:04:32,485 --> 00:04:34,261
Well, once you hear
what I've been through,

95
00:04:34,261 --> 00:04:36,175
you will totally understand.

96
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:40,138
So... you know how
it's called a hot stone massage?

97
00:04:40,138 --> 00:04:41,601
So there I am at the spa,

98
00:04:41,601 --> 00:04:44,025
laid out with my mojito,
my "Marie claire,"

99
00:04:44,025 --> 00:04:47,507
and all of a sudden,
I feel a cold rock on my ass.

100
00:04:49,474 --> 00:04:50,910
I know!

101
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:53,947
So Armando was all apologetic.
He wanted to reheat the rocks.

102
00:04:53,947 --> 00:04:54,964
But at this point, I'm like,

103
00:04:54,964 --> 00:04:57,483
"I'm sorry. I've got
a P.T.A. meeting to run."

104
00:04:57,483 --> 00:04:59,039
If you left, why are you late?

105
00:04:59,528 --> 00:05:00,940
Oh, Armando felt so bad,

106
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,407
he gave me a complimentary seaweed wrap.

107
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,006
So... what's on the agenda here?

108
00:05:06,489 --> 00:05:09,369
We're supposed to plan
teacher appreciation night.

109
00:05:09,369 --> 00:05:12,369
Mm. Right, right.
So who's doing what for that?

110
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,384
Cindy, you wanna handle the food?

111
00:05:14,756 --> 00:05:15,651
No.

112
00:05:16,674 --> 00:05:17,566
Okay.

113
00:05:17,956 --> 00:05:20,676
Rachel, you never stop talking.
You wanna emcee?

114
00:05:21,078 --> 00:05:22,153
No.

115
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:24,662
Okay, what's going on here?

116
00:05:25,094 --> 00:05:27,803
What's going on is you've wasted our time.

117
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,441
I'm leaving. I have to pick up my kids.

118
00:05:31,003 --> 00:05:32,518
I have to get back to my job.

119
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:34,946
I need to take my mother to chemo.

120
00:05:35,398 --> 00:05:37,826
Wh... okay, okay. Let's not
play sad-life poker here.

121
00:05:37,826 --> 00:05:38,951
I need your help.

122
00:05:38,951 --> 00:05:42,141
You know, we would love
to fritter away our days

123
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:45,013
with manicures and hairdressers
and spa appointments,

124
00:05:45,013 --> 00:05:47,794
but we're not like you. We have lives.

125
00:05:47,794 --> 00:05:51,315
So you can do teacher
appreciation night on your own.

126
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,384
Wh...

127
00:05:53,384 --> 00:05:55,584
Well, could you at least
fold up your chairs

128
00:05:55,584 --> 00:05:57,472
and stack 'em on the rolling cart?

129
00:05:57,472 --> 00:05:59,100
And can someone empty the coffeepot?

130
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,434
You'd really do...

131
00:06:03,323 --> 00:06:06,135
Jeez! Talk about selfish.

132
00:06:13,615 --> 00:06:16,001
Oh, thank goodness. You're alive.

133
00:06:17,897 --> 00:06:18,877
I'm sorry, reverend.

134
00:06:18,877 --> 00:06:22,078
I know that I haven't been
to church for a few sundays.

135
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:25,149
A few? Try five.

136
00:06:25,149 --> 00:06:28,466
You know who's been bringing
snacks to fellowship hour?

137
00:06:29,183 --> 00:06:30,716
Helen Johnson.

138
00:06:30,751 --> 00:06:31,884
Ugh. Let me guess.

139
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,046
Bran muffins from the mini-mart?

140
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:36,856
Why hast thou forsaken me?

141
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,594
I should've called you.

142
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,858
It's just, I haven't been feeling...

143
00:06:44,922 --> 00:06:46,708
very spiritual lately.

144
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:48,095
It's not uncommon for us

145
00:06:48,095 --> 00:06:51,056
to lose our way spiritually
from time to time,

146
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:53,031
to feel...

147
00:06:53,542 --> 00:06:54,769
in the woods.

148
00:06:56,212 --> 00:06:58,179
Interesting choice of words.

149
00:07:00,116 --> 00:07:01,251
It's just that I...

150
00:07:02,836 --> 00:07:04,724
feel like maybe I'm not worthy of...

151
00:07:05,476 --> 00:07:06,993
god's love right now,

152
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:08,717
that...

153
00:07:08,717 --> 00:07:10,695
I've lost my connection to him.

154
00:07:11,658 --> 00:07:13,521
But here's the good
thing about god, Bree...

155
00:07:13,521 --> 00:07:15,135
he's easy to find.

156
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:18,918
Just seek out the people
who are in need, and there he is.

157
00:07:18,918 --> 00:07:21,728
It always comes back to
the needy with you, doesn't it?

158
00:07:21,728 --> 00:07:23,896
It's kind of in the job description.

159
00:07:24,909 --> 00:07:26,655
I hear your new neighbor Ben Faulkner

160
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:28,485
does wonderful work with the homeless.

161
00:07:28,485 --> 00:07:30,205
Why don't you speak to him?

162
00:07:30,849 --> 00:07:32,322
Perhaps I will.

163
00:07:33,096 --> 00:07:34,883
Thank you, reverend.

164
00:07:36,739 --> 00:07:39,819
I did mention that Helen's
doing the snacks, right?

165
00:07:41,464 --> 00:07:45,060
I just finished a batch
of macadamia nut scones.

166
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:46,633
Would you like one?

167
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,430
Bless you, my child.

168
00:07:49,174 --> 00:07:51,111
And maybe one for the car?

169
00:07:55,568 --> 00:07:57,864
I get so nervous every time
I walk into this class.

170
00:07:57,864 --> 00:08:00,452
I mean, Andre Zeller, right?

171
00:08:00,884 --> 00:08:02,389
Between you and me,

172
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:04,223
he doesn't think I'm a serious artist.

173
00:08:04,223 --> 00:08:06,863
But I'll show him. I have pain.

174
00:08:06,863 --> 00:08:07,876
I mean, like this morning,

175
00:08:07,876 --> 00:08:10,222
my 9-year-old walked right into school

176
00:08:10,222 --> 00:08:11,737
without even saying good-bye.

177
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:13,915
No hug, no kiss.

178
00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:16,013
Nothing.

179
00:08:17,467 --> 00:08:20,539
Well, I'm gonna take that
misery and use it in my art.

180
00:08:22,064 --> 00:08:24,119
I'm using my father's suicide.

181
00:08:28,063 --> 00:08:30,270
Today we'll be working
with light and shadow.

182
00:08:32,126 --> 00:08:34,486
Ooh! Eggs. Cool.

183
00:08:35,178 --> 00:08:36,972
Ms. Delfino, this is my breakfast.

184
00:08:41,249 --> 00:08:42,572
You will not be sketching eggs

185
00:08:42,572 --> 00:08:45,040
or any other hackneyed still lifes today.

186
00:08:46,475 --> 00:08:48,122
You'll be drawing the male form.

187
00:08:49,383 --> 00:08:50,327
Emile.

188
00:09:01,765 --> 00:09:02,707
Sorry.

189
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:06,040
Takes some... getting used to.

190
00:09:09,392 --> 00:09:11,198
As you begin to sketch,

191
00:09:11,198 --> 00:09:13,807
think of the human form as an object.

192
00:09:14,256 --> 00:09:15,913
What is it that catches your eye?

193
00:09:18,784 --> 00:09:21,364
Mm. Didn't mean it. Just popped out.

194
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:23,838
I want you to pay close attention

195
00:09:23,838 --> 00:09:26,165
to which parts of
the human body reflect light

196
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:28,422
and which parts cast a shadow.

197
00:09:31,182 --> 00:09:32,425
I'm sorry, Ms. Delfino.

198
00:09:32,425 --> 00:09:34,991
I didn't realize we were in junior high.

199
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,081
Have you never seen a penis before?

200
00:09:37,081 --> 00:09:39,430
No. No. Yes, I have.

201
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:41,105
Uh, lots. Well, not lots.

202
00:09:42,338 --> 00:09:44,566
The appropriate... amount.

203
00:09:45,089 --> 00:09:46,397
Please try to be professional.

204
00:09:46,397 --> 00:09:47,782
I am. I am professional.

205
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,227
Penis, penis, penis.

206
00:09:53,334 --> 00:09:54,999
Just trying to take the power out of it.

207
00:10:04,911 --> 00:10:05,541
Quick.

208
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:07,047
Tell me about your father's suicide.

209
00:10:15,678 --> 00:10:17,002
Hey. What are you doing?

210
00:10:19,109 --> 00:10:20,776
I was, uh, looking for my phone,

211
00:10:22,002 --> 00:10:22,994
and, uh...

212
00:10:23,658 --> 00:10:25,153
I know this is gonna sound stupid, but...

213
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:27,841
I couldn't go in there.

214
00:10:29,297 --> 00:10:31,356
Oh, god. I don't mean
to sound insensitive,

215
00:10:31,356 --> 00:10:32,482
but is this dead guy angst?

216
00:10:32,482 --> 00:10:34,220
'Cause I am really pooped right now.

217
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,890
It's just, every time I go into that room,

218
00:10:37,782 --> 00:10:38,997
I think about that night.

219
00:10:38,997 --> 00:10:41,165
Well, here's an idea.
Don't go in that room.

220
00:10:41,165 --> 00:10:43,535
Look, there's the kitchen.
No one died in there.

221
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:46,868
You know what? We're both stressed.

222
00:10:46,868 --> 00:10:48,403
I'll pour us a couple of drinks.

223
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:51,239
No, thanks. I've been hitting
that stuff pretty hard lately.

224
00:10:51,239 --> 00:10:52,454
I don't want it to become a thing.

225
00:10:53,239 --> 00:10:55,547
Well, after the day I had,
I'll finish the bottle myself.

226
00:10:56,049 --> 00:10:58,427
This P.T.A. gig is turning
into a serious pain in the ass.

227
00:10:59,812 --> 00:11:02,560
- Yeah.
- I show up the teensiest bit late,

228
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,335
and the girls are all over me.

229
00:11:04,335 --> 00:11:05,833
They're like, "Gaby, why are you late?"

230
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,943
"You should be sad and miserable
and on time, just like us."

231
00:11:09,495 --> 00:11:11,042
It's like they're jealous or something.

232
00:11:13,179 --> 00:11:14,142
Oh, my god.

233
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,751
They're jealous.

234
00:11:16,751 --> 00:11:19,792
I know what to do. Thanks for listening.

235
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:38,031
It's nothing fancy, but,
uh, I'm proud to say

236
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,399
we feed hundreds of
homeless people every day.

237
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:42,868
Oh. Wonderful.

238
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:44,737
This is exactly what I'm looking for.

239
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:46,143
Well, great.

240
00:11:46,143 --> 00:11:47,960
But, uh, just out of curiosity...

241
00:11:48,612 --> 00:11:50,348
Uh, what did you do?

242
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,093
Excuse me?

243
00:11:52,093 --> 00:11:53,809
Well, when most people wanna give back,

244
00:11:53,809 --> 00:11:55,436
it usually means they've done something

245
00:11:55,436 --> 00:11:57,402
they're, uh, ashamed of.

246
00:11:57,402 --> 00:11:59,489
You know, embezzlement, adultery.

247
00:12:00,393 --> 00:12:01,496
What's your story?

248
00:12:04,075 --> 00:12:06,144
I suppose I could ask you the same thing.

249
00:12:06,144 --> 00:12:08,311
And I'd have the good sense not to answer.

250
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:09,246
Mm-hmm.

251
00:12:09,246 --> 00:12:11,405
I've just been feeling
disconnected lately,

252
00:12:11,405 --> 00:12:14,878
and I thought by doing something
meaningful with my days

253
00:12:14,878 --> 00:12:16,512
that I could change that.

254
00:12:16,512 --> 00:12:19,303
Actual selflessness. That's refreshing.

255
00:12:19,845 --> 00:12:22,113
I wish the city council
was as enlightened as you.

256
00:12:22,113 --> 00:12:23,138
Oh?

257
00:12:23,138 --> 00:12:24,852
Ah, they're holding up
one of my developments

258
00:12:24,852 --> 00:12:26,728
'cause it includes low-income housing.

259
00:12:26,728 --> 00:12:29,377
Ah. Typical "Not in my backyard" attitude.

260
00:12:30,227 --> 00:12:30,891
By the way...

261
00:12:30,891 --> 00:12:32,347
It's not in your backyard.

262
00:12:35,466 --> 00:12:37,207
Uh, I'm gonna have to take this.

263
00:12:37,207 --> 00:12:39,169
But, uh, I will leave
you in the capable hands

264
00:12:39,169 --> 00:12:40,563
Of, uh, Donnie here.

265
00:12:41,035 --> 00:12:42,873
Excuse me. Hello?

266
00:12:43,335 --> 00:12:44,247
Who are you?

267
00:12:44,247 --> 00:12:46,986
Oh, I am Bree, your humble sous chef.

268
00:12:47,445 --> 00:12:50,718
What do you need me to do?
Prep? Saute? Chop?

269
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:52,393
You wanna prep?

270
00:12:56,055 --> 00:12:57,319
Start prepping.

271
00:12:58,091 --> 00:12:59,677
That's... it?

272
00:13:00,201 --> 00:13:02,066
Oh, I forgot to show you the spice rack.

273
00:13:02,066 --> 00:13:05,094
Here you go. Salt. Pepper.

274
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,002
And we're out of pepper.

275
00:13:07,002 --> 00:13:08,175
If I may,

276
00:13:08,175 --> 00:13:11,450
have you ever considered
making the soup from scratch?

277
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:12,648
We don't have time for that.

278
00:13:12,648 --> 00:13:13,766
Just get 'em in and get 'em out.

279
00:13:13,766 --> 00:13:14,772
Yes, because we all know

280
00:13:14,772 --> 00:13:17,109
how pressed for time the homeless are.

281
00:13:17,109 --> 00:13:19,314
Look, these people may not have homes,

282
00:13:19,314 --> 00:13:21,073
but they do have taste buds.

283
00:13:21,604 --> 00:13:22,311
Would you be offended

284
00:13:22,311 --> 00:13:25,374
if I tried whipping up
a batch of homemade soup?

285
00:13:26,457 --> 00:13:28,152
Can you get it done by noon?

286
00:13:29,195 --> 00:13:31,322
Oh, dear. I guess I'll
have to keep it simple.

287
00:13:32,054 --> 00:13:35,007
It's just a rustic acorn squash bisque

288
00:13:35,007 --> 00:13:36,929
Finished with a dot of
maple-infused creme fraiche

289
00:13:36,929 --> 00:13:39,334
and a little crumble of fried sage.

290
00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:44,900
Holy crap!

291
00:13:45,904 --> 00:13:48,663
Finally, a blurb for my next cookbook.

292
00:13:50,018 --> 00:13:51,786
I understand that some
of you are uncomfortable

293
00:13:51,786 --> 00:13:54,065
with the naked body,
maybe even find it laughable.

294
00:13:54,065 --> 00:13:55,881
Mr. Zeller, I'm so sorry.

295
00:13:55,881 --> 00:13:57,485
One cannot create real art

296
00:13:57,485 --> 00:13:59,945
if one is crippled by
one's own inhibitions.

297
00:14:00,749 --> 00:14:01,550
I'm gonna strip them away.

298
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:05,885
So... for our next class,
we're not gonna have nude models.

299
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:08,737
- Phew.
- We're gonna have nude painters.

300
00:14:09,841 --> 00:14:10,614
What?

301
00:14:10,614 --> 00:14:11,965
Painting in the nude will force you

302
00:14:11,965 --> 00:14:14,765
to create from a place of total honesty.

303
00:14:15,568 --> 00:14:17,765
And if you're serious
about being an artist,

304
00:14:18,851 --> 00:14:20,435
you shouldn't have a problem with it.

305
00:14:21,841 --> 00:14:24,560
Nope. No problem at all.

306
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,634
What's going on, Gaby?

307
00:14:34,634 --> 00:14:36,571
Yeah. Why'd you call us here?

308
00:14:37,082 --> 00:14:38,264
I just want to apologize

309
00:14:38,264 --> 00:14:40,632
for what happened at the last meeting.

310
00:14:41,383 --> 00:14:42,508
Keep talkin'.

311
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:45,209
It was wrong of me to blow
you off for a spa appointment

312
00:14:45,209 --> 00:14:46,844
when you have such busy lives.

313
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,073
Message received, loud and clear.

314
00:14:49,563 --> 00:14:50,626
Thank you.

315
00:14:50,626 --> 00:14:54,139
So to show you I've taken
your complaint to heart,

316
00:14:54,139 --> 00:14:57,761
may I present my beauty team!

317
00:14:58,287 --> 00:15:00,811
Armando, the best masseuse in town,

318
00:15:00,811 --> 00:15:01,919
Kay, my hairdresser,

319
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:03,437
and Ping on nails.

320
00:15:03,591 --> 00:15:07,687
You no longer have to be
jealous of my fabulous life.

321
00:15:07,687 --> 00:15:11,303
For one day, you can be me.
My treat. Go crazy.

322
00:15:11,893 --> 00:15:14,833
Wow. Good to know you got our message.

323
00:15:14,937 --> 00:15:16,200
You'r' welcome.

324
00:15:16,808 --> 00:15:19,748
So you think you might want
to reconsider doing the food?

325
00:15:19,915 --> 00:15:21,334
I'd love to.

326
00:15:21,732 --> 00:15:23,193
Uh, I'll handle decorations.

327
00:15:23,193 --> 00:15:24,804
Yeah, whatever you need from us.

328
00:15:24,804 --> 00:15:26,156
That's more like it.

329
00:15:26,156 --> 00:15:27,642
Now today, relax.

330
00:15:27,642 --> 00:15:31,488
Take a break from grocery
shopping and spanking.

331
00:15:31,488 --> 00:15:33,789
I have to go meet my travel agent.

332
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:38,376
Are you guys serious?
Are we really helping her?

333
00:15:38,376 --> 00:15:41,933
No. We're helping ourselves
to a free spa day,

334
00:15:42,162 --> 00:15:46,250
then we're going to leave
her twisting in the wind.

335
00:15:46,307 --> 00:15:47,487
Oh! Hey, ladies,

336
00:15:47,487 --> 00:15:50,324
Anyone know of a good hotel
in the south of France?

337
00:15:52,186 --> 00:15:54,141
I'm sorry. I did it again!

338
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:56,034
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

339
00:15:59,424 --> 00:16:00,471
Hey, Lynette,

340
00:16:00,471 --> 00:16:02,707
Did I leave those fabric samples?

341
00:16:03,687 --> 00:16:05,129
Busted!

342
00:16:05,227 --> 00:16:07,930
That is a porn slam if I've ever seen one.

343
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:08,703
- Porn?
- Mm.

344
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:10,576
No. I was checking my e-mail.

345
00:16:11,112 --> 00:16:14,437
Come on. It's okay. We all look at porn.

346
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,942
What are you into?

347
00:16:15,942 --> 00:16:19,799
Straight, bi, solo, bald guys,

348
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:22,221
fuzzy whispers, cinnamon cakes,

349
00:16:22,436 --> 00:16:23,567
poodling?

350
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:25,277
Do I have to learn what those are?

351
00:16:25,277 --> 00:16:27,552
'Cause I really don't want to know.

352
00:16:27,552 --> 00:16:30,986
Oh, come on. Let me see.
I promise I will not judge.

353
00:16:30,986 --> 00:16:33,840
No. I signed up for an
online dating service,

354
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,771
and I took a stab at
my introduction video.

355
00:16:38,326 --> 00:16:39,449
Hi, I'm Lynette.

356
00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:41,757
I'm 35 to 45-ish.

357
00:16:41,757 --> 00:16:44,101
I'm a cancer, and I beat cancer.

358
00:16:44,101 --> 00:16:46,400
Coincidence or not? You decide.

359
00:16:47,604 --> 00:16:49,758
That is more disturbing

360
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,592
than any porn I've ever seen.

361
00:16:51,673 --> 00:16:53,124
You said you wouldn't judge.

362
00:16:53,124 --> 00:16:55,870
Oh! Online dating sucks.

363
00:16:55,947 --> 00:16:58,633
It's full of guys who
photoshop hair on their heads

364
00:16:58,633 --> 00:17:01,424
and crop out their man boobs.

365
00:17:01,424 --> 00:17:04,311
You want to meet men?
I'm taking you to a bar.

366
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,548
A bar? Oh, I don't know.

367
00:17:06,548 --> 00:17:09,834
It's been 25 years since
I tried to pick up a guy.

368
00:17:10,226 --> 00:17:13,379
Well, with me as your wingwoman,
you can have any man you want.

369
00:17:13,652 --> 00:17:14,886
Friday okay?

370
00:17:15,364 --> 00:17:16,914
I thought you had a date with Ben.

371
00:17:16,914 --> 00:17:19,461
Mm. He canceled. Again.

372
00:17:19,691 --> 00:17:22,759
Some stupid real estate
development for the poor.

373
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:23,911
Bastard.

374
00:17:23,972 --> 00:17:25,101
Well, his loss.

375
00:17:25,101 --> 00:17:26,574
If he doesn't appreciate what he's got,

376
00:17:26,574 --> 00:17:28,248
I will find someone who does.

377
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:31,227
Oh, and lay off the ice cream.

378
00:17:31,604 --> 00:17:33,562
There's no photoshop in real life.

379
00:17:39,604 --> 00:17:41,829
Morning. What's for breakfast?

380
00:17:43,659 --> 00:17:46,954
Eggs. I was gonna make bacon,
but it seemed a little risky.

381
00:17:48,513 --> 00:17:52,441
Susan, you get upset if I take
my socks off in the kitchen.

382
00:17:54,096 --> 00:17:55,170
What's going on?

383
00:17:55,898 --> 00:17:59,087
Andre feels "Until we
shed our inhibitions,"

384
00:17:59,087 --> 00:18:01,684
"our art will be only superficial."

385
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:03,417
Anyway,

386
00:18:04,122 --> 00:18:07,419
for our next class,
we have to paint in the nude.

387
00:18:08,801 --> 00:18:11,138
So I'm trying to get used to it.

388
00:18:12,212 --> 00:18:15,087
And I want to prove to him
that I can be a real artist.

389
00:18:16,546 --> 00:18:18,331
Wow, that guy is good.

390
00:18:19,401 --> 00:18:22,356
He gets to see a bunch of
coeds naked and call it work.

391
00:18:26,233 --> 00:18:28,117
Oh, honey, I'm kidding.

392
00:18:28,117 --> 00:18:30,072
No, I can't do it.

393
00:18:30,967 --> 00:18:32,773
I'm not a naked person.

394
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,366
Maybe I'm not a real artist either.

395
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:38,448
- Susan.
- No, I mean it.

396
00:18:38,448 --> 00:18:40,432
Andre doesn't like any of my work.

397
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,607
I'm not serious like the other students.

398
00:18:45,509 --> 00:18:47,326
I think I'm just gonna quit the class.

399
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:50,889
Quit? But this class
has been really good for you.

400
00:18:51,311 --> 00:18:52,708
It seems like it was pulling you

401
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:54,450
out of that dark place you've been in.

402
00:18:55,341 --> 00:18:56,454
You think so?

403
00:18:56,454 --> 00:18:59,735
Yeah, and I feel like
I'm getting my old Susie back.

404
00:19:00,691 --> 00:19:03,062
Besides, this guy sounds like a jackass.

405
00:19:03,062 --> 00:19:04,396
Don't let him win.

406
00:19:05,842 --> 00:19:06,989
You're right.

407
00:19:07,301 --> 00:19:09,392
I am a serious artist.

408
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:12,472
I just need to get used
to people seeing me naked.

409
00:19:13,682 --> 00:19:15,836
Susan! It's Lee. You home?

410
00:19:16,066 --> 00:19:18,266
Perfect. My best gay.

411
00:19:19,109 --> 00:19:20,757
Who better to practice on?

412
00:19:22,926 --> 00:19:23,827
Good morning, Lee.

413
00:19:23,827 --> 00:19:25,690
This is Bob's... mother of god!

414
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:26,797
Ohh!

415
00:19:31,331 --> 00:19:33,580
Gay marriage doesn't seem
so freaky now, does it?

416
00:19:38,627 --> 00:19:41,882
Looks like my tuscan bean with
parmesan crostini is a hit.

417
00:19:41,882 --> 00:19:44,421
Yeah, it is, but I think you're starting

418
00:19:44,421 --> 00:19:46,576
to attract the wrong sort of crowd.

419
00:19:50,627 --> 00:19:54,544
Excuse me, but, uh, you don't
exactly look homeless to me.

420
00:19:54,664 --> 00:19:56,683
Yeah, I-I'm homeless.

421
00:19:57,035 --> 00:19:59,819
And yet you have a $2,000 laptop?

422
00:20:00,106 --> 00:20:02,091
But I live in the box it came in?

423
00:20:02,545 --> 00:20:04,506
Okay, I-I'm a college student.

424
00:20:04,506 --> 00:20:06,301
But my parents did stop talking to me

425
00:20:06,301 --> 00:20:09,493
when I switched from pre-med
to creative writing.

426
00:20:09,785 --> 00:20:11,595
Well, I'm afraid you're
gonna have to leave.

427
00:20:11,693 --> 00:20:15,491
Too bad. I just gave you
mad props on my blog.

428
00:20:15,653 --> 00:20:16,930
Is that a good thing?

429
00:20:17,498 --> 00:20:18,382
Yeah.

430
00:20:20,014 --> 00:20:21,163
"Homey but refined,"

431
00:20:21,163 --> 00:20:23,157
"Bree van de Camp's tuscan bean soup"

432
00:20:23,157 --> 00:20:24,963
"is a revelation in a bowl."

433
00:20:26,486 --> 00:20:27,796
Revelation, you say?

434
00:20:27,796 --> 00:20:30,451
Uh-huh. And it's already been
"Liked" on facebook

435
00:20:30,451 --> 00:20:32,569
and retweeted 200 times...

436
00:20:33,746 --> 00:20:35,411
which is also a good thing.

437
00:20:35,411 --> 00:20:36,355
Oh.

438
00:20:36,355 --> 00:20:38,256
But hey, if I gotta go...

439
00:20:38,256 --> 00:20:39,423
Hold on.

440
00:20:39,423 --> 00:20:43,304
I can't let a talented
near-orphan like you go hungry.

441
00:20:43,498 --> 00:20:44,908
Let me get you a refill.

442
00:20:45,527 --> 00:20:48,750
Oh, and it's "Van de Kamp"... with a "K."

443
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:55,920
Hey, Mike. Need a hand?

444
00:20:57,878 --> 00:20:59,019
No, I'm okay.

445
00:21:01,178 --> 00:21:02,541
Uh, Susan around?

446
00:21:02,939 --> 00:21:04,910
Uh, she's at her painting class.

447
00:21:05,941 --> 00:21:06,938
Okay.

448
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:09,321
I'll... stop by later.

449
00:21:09,714 --> 00:21:11,342
I don't think that's a good idea.

450
00:21:15,957 --> 00:21:17,648
You need to say something to me, Mike?

451
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:19,394
Yeah, I do.

452
00:21:19,595 --> 00:21:20,863
If things were different,

453
00:21:20,952 --> 00:21:22,994
if it had been me that killed somebody,

454
00:21:22,994 --> 00:21:24,392
and your wife walked in,

455
00:21:24,392 --> 00:21:26,616
I'd have gone to the cops
and turned myself in.

456
00:21:26,616 --> 00:21:28,748
I wouldn't have dragged Gaby into it.

457
00:21:29,846 --> 00:21:32,147
There's a lot I would've done
differently about that night

458
00:21:32,147 --> 00:21:33,278
if I could.

459
00:21:33,278 --> 00:21:34,897
Yeah, well, you can't.

460
00:21:35,117 --> 00:21:38,392
But here's what you can do...
you can leave Susan alone.

461
00:21:39,242 --> 00:21:42,968
Just let her find a way to deal
with what you put her through.

462
00:21:44,115 --> 00:21:45,922
It just really helps

463
00:21:46,209 --> 00:21:47,408
to talk to her.

464
00:21:50,174 --> 00:21:51,621
But it doesn't help her.

465
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:56,682
Then...

466
00:21:56,965 --> 00:21:58,515
I won't do it anymore.

467
00:22:01,346 --> 00:22:02,345
Yeah.

468
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:21,295
Remember, technique is a crutch.

469
00:22:22,156 --> 00:22:23,508
Learn it and throw it away.

470
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:26,110
That way you can begin
to find your own voice

471
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,432
and that's what that...

472
00:22:36,425 --> 00:22:37,816
Oh, my god.

473
00:22:38,335 --> 00:22:39,253
Oh!

474
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:44,078
Taking casual friday a bit to the extreme,

475
00:22:44,078 --> 00:22:45,477
aren't we, Ms. Delfino?

476
00:22:46,467 --> 00:22:47,934
Isn't this the day we were...

477
00:22:48,889 --> 00:22:50,291
Aren't we all supposed to be...

478
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:53,500
The school put the kibosh on
my little artistic experiment.

479
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,007
It was all there in the e-mail.

480
00:22:55,351 --> 00:22:56,333
What e-mail?

481
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,256
The one you obviously didn't open.

482
00:22:59,433 --> 00:23:01,102
Maybe you didn't send me one.

483
00:23:02,586 --> 00:23:03,808
Why would I do that?

484
00:23:03,808 --> 00:23:05,253
To humiliate me.

485
00:23:05,253 --> 00:23:07,163
To punish me for laughing.

486
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:12,423
You have singled me out since day one.

487
00:23:12,423 --> 00:23:14,955
Why not try to make a fool of me?

488
00:23:17,582 --> 00:23:20,876
Because in the vast landscape
of my interior life,

489
00:23:20,876 --> 00:23:22,811
you're merely a dust speck.

490
00:23:23,849 --> 00:23:25,406
Now get dressed and sit down.

491
00:23:26,237 --> 00:23:27,220
No.

492
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:32,102
I signed up for this
class to learn something,

493
00:23:32,167 --> 00:23:34,547
not to be a punching bag

494
00:23:34,547 --> 00:23:36,334
for an egomaniac

495
00:23:36,334 --> 00:23:37,902
with a paintbrush!

496
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,522
I quit!

497
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:01,129
Hello and welcome to our soup kitchen.

498
00:24:01,129 --> 00:24:03,033
I hope you're hungry,
because I have prepared

499
00:24:03,033 --> 00:24:05,458
a hearty italian wedding soup today.

500
00:24:06,452 --> 00:24:07,873
Donnie, two.

501
00:24:15,016 --> 00:24:17,409
Reverend Sykes. What a nice surprise!

502
00:24:17,459 --> 00:24:18,929
That's quite a crowd out front.

503
00:24:18,929 --> 00:24:20,802
I practically had to fight my way in.

504
00:24:20,802 --> 00:24:22,710
Well, ever since I took over the kitchen,

505
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:24,181
we've been jam-packed.

506
00:24:24,181 --> 00:24:26,814
Thank you so much for
suggesting I get involved.

507
00:24:26,814 --> 00:24:31,420
I have never felt more needed
or important in my whole life.

508
00:24:31,951 --> 00:24:35,412
The intention of charity is
not to make us feel important.

509
00:24:35,412 --> 00:24:37,390
Of course not. It's to help people.

510
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:39,525
Feeling important's just a bonus.

511
00:24:40,057 --> 00:24:41,334
So what brings you by?

512
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:44,128
I was hoping you could tell me

513
00:24:44,128 --> 00:24:47,183
where a homeless person
could get a hot meal.

514
00:24:48,448 --> 00:24:49,942
Well, right here, of course.

515
00:24:49,942 --> 00:24:51,468
No, Bree.

516
00:24:51,952 --> 00:24:53,760
Ever since you've turned this soup kitchen

517
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,155
into a bisque kitchen,

518
00:24:55,155 --> 00:24:57,351
the homeless don't feel comfortable here.

519
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:00,852
Why? I was just trying to
make this place special.

520
00:25:00,852 --> 00:25:03,806
It was already special.
It was home for them,

521
00:25:04,517 --> 00:25:06,394
until you took that away.

522
00:25:18,963 --> 00:25:20,068
Excuse me.

523
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:26,713
I'm sorry, but you're gonna need to leave.

524
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:28,382
Hey, we're still eating.

525
00:25:28,382 --> 00:25:30,514
Well, then go eat somewhere else.

526
00:25:30,623 --> 00:25:32,513
You certainly look like you can afford to.

527
00:25:32,588 --> 00:25:34,978
Whoa. Whe's the attitude coming from?

528
00:25:34,978 --> 00:25:36,567
We made this place a success.

529
00:25:36,567 --> 00:25:40,016
No. This place is supposed
to feed homeless people.

530
00:25:40,016 --> 00:25:41,647
It's a dismal failure.

531
00:25:43,706 --> 00:25:45,979
This food isn't for you.
It's for the hungry and the poor...

532
00:25:45,979 --> 00:25:48,472
the people we walk past every day.

533
00:25:49,399 --> 00:25:50,858
Everyone deserves to have a place,

534
00:25:50,858 --> 00:25:53,942
and this place was theirs
until I made it mine.

535
00:25:53,942 --> 00:25:58,442
So please, pack up your laptops
and your smartphones and go.

536
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,568
Please go.

537
00:26:06,514 --> 00:26:09,253
Ben, I'm sorry. I have made
a terrible mess of things.

538
00:26:09,253 --> 00:26:10,526
Don't worry about it.

539
00:26:10,993 --> 00:26:13,993
You think you can make a speech
that good again tomorrow?

540
00:26:14,769 --> 00:26:16,019
Speech?

541
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:19,017
You're gonna help me push that
low-income housing project

542
00:26:19,017 --> 00:26:20,479
through city council.

543
00:26:28,136 --> 00:26:29,711
This is where you live, huh?

544
00:26:30,553 --> 00:26:32,869
Norman Rockwell would
walk down this street

545
00:26:32,869 --> 00:26:35,241
and say, "A little much."

546
00:26:36,188 --> 00:26:37,274
Can I come in?

547
00:26:37,275 --> 00:26:39,507
Of course. How else are you gonna make fun

548
00:26:39,507 --> 00:26:41,291
of the inside of my house?

549
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:44,061
By the way, I, uh, checked my e-mail,

550
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:46,338
and, uh, you never sent me one.

551
00:26:46,873 --> 00:26:48,726
Did you check your campus e-mail?

552
00:26:49,644 --> 00:26:51,299
I have a campus e-mail?

553
00:26:51,952 --> 00:26:53,495
Okay, I'm gonna make this brief,

554
00:26:53,495 --> 00:26:55,712
mainly because I've got
a dinner engagement

555
00:26:55,712 --> 00:26:58,407
with someone infinitely
more interesting than you.

556
00:26:58,976 --> 00:26:59,927
Wow.

557
00:26:59,927 --> 00:27:02,671
Climb down from your cross
and come back to my class.

558
00:27:02,671 --> 00:27:05,715
Why? So you can abuse me more?

559
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:08,905
Yes, I will abuse you and scream at you,

560
00:27:08,905 --> 00:27:11,024
make you paint in
the nude and do anything else

561
00:27:11,024 --> 00:27:13,521
I have to do to get you
to stop being so scared.

562
00:27:13,521 --> 00:27:15,234
I'm not scared.

563
00:27:15,234 --> 00:27:18,213
I showed up at your class naked.

564
00:27:18,776 --> 00:27:20,117
Then you ran away.

565
00:27:20,907 --> 00:27:23,317
It seems to me you do
a lot of running away

566
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:25,549
and nervous giggling.

567
00:27:26,501 --> 00:27:28,344
You act like someone who's...

568
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:32,214
What?

569
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,690
You're hiding something,

570
00:27:35,477 --> 00:27:37,009
and I'm gonna pull it out of you,

571
00:27:37,045 --> 00:27:39,262
and when that happens, there is a chance...

572
00:27:39,572 --> 00:27:42,741
the remotest, slimmest wisp of a chance...

573
00:27:43,436 --> 00:27:45,734
that you might actually become an artist.

574
00:27:45,734 --> 00:27:49,078
Oh, god. Is this
the part where you tell me

575
00:27:49,078 --> 00:27:51,499
that the reason you're being so hard on me

576
00:27:51,499 --> 00:27:55,780
is because I'm the only one
in the class with potential?

577
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:56,795
No.

578
00:27:57,426 --> 00:28:00,785
Amy Yamata's the only one
in the class with potential.

579
00:28:01,285 --> 00:28:05,152
You're a bizarre car crash
that somehow fascinates me.

580
00:28:05,932 --> 00:28:07,085
Thank you?

581
00:28:07,428 --> 00:28:08,547
Now if you'll excuse me,

582
00:28:08,547 --> 00:28:10,418
this is about as long as I can spend

583
00:28:10,418 --> 00:28:13,626
in a room decorated
with ceramic elephants.

584
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:27,235
Hi, ladies. Someone wanna
help me with these flowers?

585
00:28:28,709 --> 00:28:31,019
Okay, no worries. I got it.

586
00:28:40,188 --> 00:28:41,812
What have you guys been doing?

587
00:28:41,812 --> 00:28:44,594
People are gonna be here in two hours.
Nothing's been set up.

588
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:48,113
Well, I'm just so relaxed
from that massage.

589
00:28:48,113 --> 00:28:50,613
I'd hate to lift something
and tense up again.

590
00:28:50,657 --> 00:28:52,882
Yeah, and-and Ping worked
so hard on these nails.

591
00:28:52,882 --> 00:28:54,325
I would hate to chip them.

592
00:28:54,629 --> 00:28:58,332
And I... can't think of
anything witty to say

593
00:28:58,332 --> 00:29:02,231
about my fabulous new 'do,
but I'm not doing squat either.

594
00:29:03,371 --> 00:29:04,771
Why are you doing this to me?

595
00:29:04,771 --> 00:29:07,189
I went out of my way to help you people.

596
00:29:07,189 --> 00:29:09,363
Oh, my god, you are so out of touch.

597
00:29:09,435 --> 00:29:11,256
Do you really think a hot stone massage

598
00:29:11,256 --> 00:29:12,754
is gonna solve my problems?

599
00:29:12,754 --> 00:29:16,378
You don't understand the kinds
of things real people deal with.

600
00:29:16,653 --> 00:29:18,637
You live in this perfect
little fairy tale.

601
00:29:18,637 --> 00:29:20,763
Fine. I don't need your help.

602
00:29:20,763 --> 00:29:23,818
I have two hours and
a very capable husband.

603
00:29:23,818 --> 00:29:26,350
This event is going off without a hitch.

604
00:29:27,061 --> 00:29:28,774
Oh, and one more thing.

605
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:33,979
Hello?

606
00:29:33,979 --> 00:29:35,695
Honey, sorry to bother you at work,

607
00:29:35,695 --> 00:29:37,205
but this is an emergency.

608
00:29:37,535 --> 00:29:38,524
Whoa. What's going on?

609
00:29:38,524 --> 00:29:40,114
I need you to meet me at the school.

610
00:29:40,114 --> 00:29:42,016
These P.T.A. beeyotches...

611
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,879
Yeah, I'm talking to you, Cindy...

612
00:29:44,252 --> 00:29:45,458
are refusing to help me.

613
00:29:45,458 --> 00:29:47,228
I need an extra pair of hands.

614
00:29:47,815 --> 00:29:49,762
Sure. I'll be-be right there.

615
00:29:50,127 --> 00:29:52,260
Ha! He's on his way.

616
00:29:52,997 --> 00:29:54,791
Thanks. You're a lifesaver.

617
00:30:15,649 --> 00:30:17,911
Wow. When I pictured this in my head,

618
00:30:17,912 --> 00:30:20,271
I wasn't as old as all the other people...

619
00:30:20,338 --> 00:30:21,615
combined.

620
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:24,635
Uh, two martinis, dirty.

621
00:30:24,636 --> 00:30:26,961
Oh, wait. That's me.

622
00:30:28,499 --> 00:30:30,531
Feel free to use that if you want.

623
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:33,448
Maybe I will... at home,
'cause that's where I'm going.

624
00:30:33,449 --> 00:30:34,718
Oh, relax.

625
00:30:34,719 --> 00:30:36,734
Look at this place like a candy store.

626
00:30:36,735 --> 00:30:38,885
You just have to figure out
what you're in the mood for.

627
00:30:38,886 --> 00:30:41,124
Obviously, something with nuts.

628
00:30:42,231 --> 00:30:44,210
I thought I was done with this.

629
00:30:44,257 --> 00:30:47,860
I dated, I combed through all the losers,

630
00:30:47,861 --> 00:30:49,935
and I finally found a guy,

631
00:30:49,936 --> 00:30:52,596
someone who was smart and made me laugh.

632
00:30:52,597 --> 00:30:55,626
And now to be back here, at my age,

633
00:30:55,627 --> 00:30:58,859
doing it all over again, it's depressing.

634
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,311
Oh, my god. You're right.

635
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:05,688
What?

636
00:31:05,689 --> 00:31:07,818
- It is depressing.
- Renee.

637
00:31:07,819 --> 00:31:09,754
What am I doing in hell's candy store?

638
00:31:09,755 --> 00:31:12,737
I have a guy. He's smart
and he makes me laugh.

639
00:31:12,738 --> 00:31:14,994
I thought you said Ben works too much.

640
00:31:14,995 --> 00:31:18,164
Oh, he's passionate about his job,
but he's a 10.

641
00:31:18,165 --> 00:31:21,976
You add up every guy in
this place and you get a 6.

642
00:31:25,453 --> 00:31:29,095
But you stay. There's definitely
somebody here for you.

643
00:31:34,171 --> 00:31:35,430
Orange cable...

644
00:31:35,431 --> 00:31:37,698
goes around here...

645
00:31:39,316 --> 00:31:40,985
this one goes here.

646
00:31:41,254 --> 00:31:43,782
Ha! And... presto!

647
00:31:44,263 --> 00:31:45,433
Oh!

648
00:31:45,993 --> 00:31:47,272
Ow.

649
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:51,527
So is "Presto" spanish for
"Cover your ears"?

650
00:31:52,516 --> 00:31:53,719
That's hilarious, Cindy.

651
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,990
You know, you should've been a comic

652
00:31:54,991 --> 00:31:57,500
instead of a pint-sized pain in my ass!

653
00:31:57,713 --> 00:31:59,992
Oh, it's getting late.

654
00:31:59,993 --> 00:32:01,385
Looks like your perfect husband

655
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:03,633
isn't gonna be here to bail you out.

656
00:32:07,412 --> 00:32:10,688
Aha! Look who's here.

657
00:32:10,689 --> 00:32:12,628
There's my hero!

658
00:32:12,629 --> 00:32:14,840
Now hurry up. We need
to get cracking here.

659
00:32:15,168 --> 00:32:16,792
Hey, what are you doing?

660
00:32:21,966 --> 00:32:23,443
Carlos.

661
00:32:25,183 --> 00:32:26,564
Hey, Gaby.

662
00:32:28,742 --> 00:32:31,192
Carlos, you can't be here like this.
You've gotta go.

663
00:32:31,193 --> 00:32:32,600
No, no, no. Gonna help, okay?

664
00:32:32,601 --> 00:32:35,125
No. Please. You need to leave.

665
00:32:35,126 --> 00:32:36,959
No, I'm gonna help, okay? Gonna help.

666
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,715
No, honey. You have to leave, please.

667
00:32:39,716 --> 00:32:41,305
Hang on. Hang on.

668
00:32:41,762 --> 00:32:42,925
Whew!

669
00:32:54,068 --> 00:32:55,829
Rachel, get the soundboard set up.

670
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:58,619
Melissa, Megan,
start putting out the food.

671
00:32:59,969 --> 00:33:01,598
Melissa, now.

672
00:33:06,247 --> 00:33:07,433
It's okay, Gaby.

673
00:33:07,434 --> 00:33:08,626
We got it.

674
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,491
I don't know what to say.

675
00:33:13,708 --> 00:33:15,327
Just take care of your husband.

676
00:33:21,764 --> 00:33:22,753
Hello.

677
00:33:22,754 --> 00:33:25,292
I'm Phil, and you're beautiful.

678
00:33:25,515 --> 00:33:27,690
You're just saying that.

679
00:33:27,691 --> 00:33:29,222
But I'll take it.

680
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:32,024
God knows it took me long
enough to get ready tonight.

681
00:33:32,025 --> 00:33:34,447
I even had to pay
the sitter to come early.

682
00:33:34,495 --> 00:33:36,718
Sitter? So you have kids?

683
00:33:36,719 --> 00:33:37,506
Yeah.

684
00:33:37,507 --> 00:33:40,090
Five. Five kids.

685
00:33:40,091 --> 00:33:42,205
Wow. That sounds like a lot.

686
00:33:42,206 --> 00:33:44,639
I actually have a husband,
too, but we're separated,

687
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,909
and we're seeing other people.
Or he is, and I'm trying to.

688
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:48,980
Not that I'm doing it to retaliate,
it's just that...

689
00:33:48,981 --> 00:33:51,344
Wow. I can't seem to stop talking.

690
00:33:51,551 --> 00:33:53,490
Maybe you could say something now.

691
00:33:54,353 --> 00:33:55,665
Bye.

692
00:33:57,351 --> 00:33:58,648
Bye-bye.

693
00:34:03,998 --> 00:34:06,981
Crowd's a little light tonight,
don't you think?

694
00:34:09,486 --> 00:34:12,172
Can I buy you a drink
or are you already lit?

695
00:34:13,824 --> 00:34:16,102
Oh, come on. I'll let
you play with my tie.

696
00:34:16,103 --> 00:34:17,789
Here's the remote.

697
00:34:27,489 --> 00:34:29,323
Don't I know you from somewhere?

698
00:34:29,925 --> 00:34:32,478
Okay. Not the most original line,

699
00:34:32,479 --> 00:34:36,098
But you're cute, so... Lynette.

700
00:34:36,099 --> 00:34:39,152
Right. Right. You're
Porter and Preston's mom.

701
00:34:39,153 --> 00:34:40,558
Oh, god.

702
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:42,836
Mrs. Scavo was the coolest mom.

703
00:34:42,837 --> 00:34:44,191
She used to make us grilled cheese

704
00:34:44,192 --> 00:34:48,041
in the shape of dinosaurs.
So what are you doing here?

705
00:34:49,503 --> 00:34:51,174
I have no idea.

706
00:34:58,309 --> 00:34:59,176
Here you go.

707
00:34:59,177 --> 00:35:01,533
It's probably the only set of
keys with a purple lanyard.

708
00:35:01,534 --> 00:35:03,186
My kid made it at camp.

709
00:35:04,517 --> 00:35:07,507
Look, I'm wearing something
called skinny jeans,

710
00:35:07,508 --> 00:35:08,520
which are very painful

711
00:35:08,521 --> 00:35:10,766
because I don't have
something called skinny legs,

712
00:35:10,767 --> 00:35:13,403
so I just wanna go home and
peel them off. Do you mind?

713
00:35:13,404 --> 00:35:16,548
No, not at all. I just...
I don't... I don't work here.

714
00:35:16,704 --> 00:35:17,723
Oh.

715
00:35:17,724 --> 00:35:20,756
Oh, god. I'm sorry. You're not the valet.

716
00:35:21,522 --> 00:35:23,072
I knew this vest was a bad idea,

717
00:35:23,073 --> 00:35:25,667
but the gay guy in my
office told me they're back.

718
00:35:25,668 --> 00:35:28,212
No, the vest is great.

719
00:35:28,743 --> 00:35:30,181
I have it in navy.

720
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:33,159
It's just... I haven't been out in so long,

721
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,982
I figured I'd try to mix things up.

722
00:35:34,983 --> 00:35:36,974
You haven't been out in so long?

723
00:35:36,975 --> 00:35:38,768
Last time I was at a bar like this,

724
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:40,645
beeper numbers were exchanged.

725
00:35:41,198 --> 00:35:43,482
I didn't even know
they banned smoking in bars.

726
00:35:43,483 --> 00:35:46,199
And how did the good, old,
reliable martini lose its job?

727
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:50,098
Apple? Cherry? Watermelon?
Those are slushie flavors.

728
00:35:51,562 --> 00:35:52,859
I'm Lynette.

729
00:35:53,088 --> 00:35:54,375
Scott.

730
00:35:54,563 --> 00:35:56,406
By the way, not that it's a competition,

731
00:35:56,407 --> 00:35:58,613
but I have two lanyards on my keychain.

732
00:35:58,672 --> 00:35:59,990
They're pink.

733
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,746
- Daughters?
- Yes.

734
00:36:01,747 --> 00:36:02,536
Divorce?

735
00:36:02,537 --> 00:36:04,434
No, thanks. I already had one.

736
00:36:05,479 --> 00:36:06,801
You?

737
00:36:06,932 --> 00:36:08,282
Uh, separated.

738
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:15,635
Hey. Um...

739
00:36:15,644 --> 00:36:19,851
Listen, this is the first decent
conversation I've had all night.

740
00:36:20,796 --> 00:36:23,229
What do you say we go back
inside and continue it?

741
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:25,924
I say...

742
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:28,699
pomegranatinis are on me.

743
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,630
All right. That was easy.

744
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:32,233
You calling me easy?

745
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:33,559
Not yet.

746
00:36:36,368 --> 00:36:38,147
Um, please.

747
00:36:38,148 --> 00:36:39,316
Ah.

748
00:36:39,926 --> 00:36:42,655
Uh, can I get you something to drink?

749
00:36:42,656 --> 00:36:44,858
I have, uh, vodka.

750
00:36:44,871 --> 00:36:47,410
I have milk. I have chocolate milk.

751
00:36:47,411 --> 00:36:48,947
I have juice boxes.

752
00:36:49,693 --> 00:36:52,336
Having kids has really
ruined my game, huh?

753
00:36:52,337 --> 00:36:54,123
Vodka and chocolate milk...

754
00:36:54,124 --> 00:36:57,205
that's exactly what I give
my baby to calm her down.

755
00:36:59,648 --> 00:37:00,612
Cheers.

756
00:37:00,613 --> 00:37:01,829
Cheers.

757
00:37:15,895 --> 00:37:17,314
Now what do we do?

758
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:21,581
I'd put on some music,
but my ex got all my CDs.

759
00:37:21,607 --> 00:37:22,332
Mm.

760
00:37:22,333 --> 00:37:26,153
I could turn on a black light,
but I'm not 16.

761
00:37:26,562 --> 00:37:29,028
Maybe I could light some candles,

762
00:37:29,029 --> 00:37:32,558
But that seems like kind
of an obvious move, right?

763
00:37:34,144 --> 00:37:36,171
Not as obvious as this.

764
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,410
Maybe obvious isn't so bad.

765
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,100
Ohh.

766
00:37:48,101 --> 00:37:49,708
Oh, wow!

767
00:37:50,499 --> 00:37:53,224
- No?
- No. Oh, no, it's good.
It's good. Keep going.

768
00:37:53,225 --> 00:37:54,650
Mmm. Mmm.

769
00:37:56,094 --> 00:37:58,662
I have another room that
I would love to show you.

770
00:37:59,129 --> 00:38:00,020
Really?

771
00:38:00,021 --> 00:38:01,112
Uh-huh.

772
00:38:01,113 --> 00:38:03,886
You're getting... better at this.

773
00:38:05,664 --> 00:38:06,973
Mmm.

774
00:38:19,077 --> 00:38:20,282
Ow.

775
00:38:20,283 --> 00:38:22,567
Oh! Hang on. Hang on.

776
00:38:22,568 --> 00:38:23,573
Shoot!

777
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:27,806
Oh. Right here?

778
00:38:27,807 --> 00:38:28,722
Okay.

779
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:31,051
No, I... dropped something.

780
00:38:31,052 --> 00:38:33,225
Oh. Can I help?

781
00:38:33,419 --> 00:38:36,011
My ring fell off. You had
to have shag carpeting, huh?

782
00:38:36,012 --> 00:38:39,364
Ugh. That gay guy at my
office said shag was back.

783
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:42,736
Really need to start getting
my style tips from someone else.

784
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:44,638
Damn it. Where is it?

785
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:45,977
This rug... it swallows everything.

786
00:38:45,978 --> 00:38:47,761
There used to be an end table here and...

787
00:38:47,762 --> 00:38:50,282
Oh, my god! Please don't
be funny right now.

788
00:38:51,754 --> 00:38:54,110
Wait. Wait. Wait.

789
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,432
Here it is.

790
00:38:56,419 --> 00:38:57,561
Oh.

791
00:38:57,959 --> 00:38:59,122
Thank you.

792
00:39:02,622 --> 00:39:05,294
So, uh, where were we?

793
00:39:13,752 --> 00:39:15,903
I'm sorry. I can't.

794
00:39:18,844 --> 00:39:21,196
You're a really great guy.

795
00:39:21,197 --> 00:39:24,159
You're nice and you're funny and...

796
00:39:24,396 --> 00:39:26,157
whatever you were doing...

797
00:39:26,803 --> 00:39:29,077
to-to my neck was really working for me,

798
00:39:29,078 --> 00:39:31,571
but the idea of walking
10 feet into your bedroom

799
00:39:31,572 --> 00:39:34,944
is about the scariest thing
I can think of right now.

800
00:39:38,462 --> 00:39:39,766
Okay.

801
00:39:42,271 --> 00:39:43,631
I'm...

802
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:47,115
hoping to work things out with my husband,

803
00:39:47,116 --> 00:39:48,394
and I guess I just...

804
00:39:48,395 --> 00:39:49,642
I get it.

805
00:39:50,677 --> 00:39:52,152
You're not there yet.

806
00:39:53,877 --> 00:39:55,262
I'm not.

807
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,670
Well, I think I should go.

808
00:40:05,439 --> 00:40:06,869
Come on.

809
00:40:16,967 --> 00:40:18,288
Bye.

810
00:40:19,825 --> 00:40:21,808
I understand your hesitation.

811
00:40:21,876 --> 00:40:24,963
I am one of those people
with a manicured lawn

812
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:27,176
who would object

813
00:40:27,177 --> 00:40:30,223
when a proposal like this
threatens her community.

814
00:40:30,224 --> 00:40:31,437
But my eyes have been opened,

815
00:40:31,438 --> 00:40:34,241
and I will personally go door-to-door

816
00:40:34,242 --> 00:40:38,358
to help other people see how
essential this project is,

817
00:40:38,359 --> 00:40:42,995
so that where we live can
truly be called a community.

818
00:40:52,685 --> 00:40:55,038
You were amazing.

819
00:40:55,218 --> 00:40:56,858
Well, I meant every word.

820
00:40:56,859 --> 00:40:58,779
I want to help you any way I can.

821
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,484
Great. Well, uh, first thing tomorrow,

822
00:41:00,485 --> 00:41:02,869
I'll take you out to see
the construction site.

823
00:41:04,658 --> 00:41:07,862
<i>Yes, we may think we're all destined</i>

824
00:41:07,863 --> 00:41:10,235
<i>to play certain roles.</i>

825
00:41:10,778 --> 00:41:15,700
<i>But sometimes those roles
can unexpectedly change.</i>

826
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:21,768
<i>A nervous student may
discover a hidden confidence.</i>

827
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:27,604
<i>A longtime wife may confront
a harsh new reality.</i>

828
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:30,032
<i>A busy mother</i>

829
00:41:30,033 --> 00:41:34,222
<i>May find her attention
is needed elsewhere.</i>

830
00:41:35,916 --> 00:41:39,582
<i>And a woman who wanted to
do a little bit of good</i>

831
00:41:39,583 --> 00:41:43,384
<i>may find herself playing
a much bigger role</i>

832
00:41:43,385 --> 00:41:45,712
<i>than she intended.</i>

833
00:41:46,321 --> 00:41:49,435
I was searching and searching
for the perfect spot,

834
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:51,384
and then I found it...

835
00:41:51,385 --> 00:41:53,138
Chapman woods.

836
00:41:53,908 --> 00:41:55,962
Have you ever been here before?

837
00:42:03,619 --> 00:42:04,866
Once.

838
00:42:04,867 --> 00:42:08,544
Well, they're finally gonna
break ground on tuesday,

839
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:10,566
and it's all thanks to you.

840
00:42:12,017 --> 00:42:13,567
Glad I could help.
