00:00:03,636 --> 00:00:05,031
<i>Renee had good news.</i>

3
00:00:05,094 --> 00:00:06,423
We're getting married.

4
00:00:06,469 --> 00:00:08,793
Oh, how wonderful.

5
00:00:08,892 --> 00:00:11,855
<i>Gaby's talent for shopping
became an opportunity.</i>

6
00:00:11,855 --> 00:00:12,915
The personal shopper job?

7
00:00:12,916 --> 00:00:14,884
For you, my dear,
it is a calling.

8
00:00:14,885 --> 00:00:17,850
<i>Things heated up
between Tom and Lynette.</i>

9
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,212

- Oh!

10
00:00:19,213 --> 00:00:21,908
Aah! Oh!

00:00:21,909 --> 00:00:24,837
<i>M.J. and Susan began

12
00:00:24,838 --> 00:00:26,537

13
00:00:26,607 --> 00:00:27,673
Oh, sweetie.

14
00:00:27,674 --> 00:00:31,699
<i>The police questioned Bree
and advanced their case.</i>

15
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:33,586
Judge Kemp just signed off
on that warrant.

16
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,757
That was fast.

17
00:00:34,758 --> 00:00:36,699
Sooner I can prove
she's guilty,

18
00:00:36,699 --> 00:00:38,737
sooner I can watch her
pay for it.

19
00:00:44,762 --> 00:00:47,732
<i>When it came
to throwing a bridal shower,</i>

20
00:00:47,733 --> 00:00:49,690
<i>Bree Van de Kamp believed</i>

21
00:00:49,691 --> 00:00:53,786
<i>that everything should be done
with taste and dignity.</i>

22
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:58,715
<i>There should be
personalized party favors...</i>

23
00:00:58,716 --> 00:01:02,786
<i>delicate pastel flowers...</i>

24
00:01:02,787 --> 00:01:07,732
<i>elegant refreshments...</i>

25
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:10,765
<i>and she insisted
on traditional gifts,</i>

26
00:01:10,766 --> 00:01:15,765
<i>even if they received
an untraditional response.</i>

27
00:01:15,766 --> 00:01:18,720
What the hell? Mixing bowls?

28
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,783
<i>Nesting </i>mixing bowls.

29
00:01:19,784 --> 00:01:21,757
Come on. This is a shower.

30
00:01:21,758 --> 00:01:25,707
Isn't there one gift over there
that's, uh,

31
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:27,786
you know, <i>buzzing?</i>

32
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:29,723
Oh! I know just the one.

33
00:01:29,724 --> 00:01:31,708
Oh, here we go.

34
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:32,779
I use mine all the time.

35
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,748
I used to do it by hand,

36
00:01:34,749 --> 00:01:36,807
but this gets the job done
so much faster.

37
00:01:36,808 --> 00:01:39,778
Ah. Now we're talking.

38
00:01:39,779 --> 00:01:43,723
It's a brand-new...

39
00:01:43,724 --> 00:01:45,757
immersion blender?

40
00:01:45,758 --> 00:01:48,752
Now you can puree soups
right in the pot.

41
00:01:48,753 --> 00:01:52,794
So is every gift gonna be
kitchen-related?

44
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,395
Okay, I might have to send
someone out on a beer run.

45
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:01,700
Well, I am sorry to disappoint
you, but if you're looking

46
00:02:01,707 --> 00:02:03,791
for <i>that </i>kind of shower,
you're in the wrong place.

47
00:02:03,792 --> 00:02:06,699
Oh, Bree, can I talk to you
for a second?

48
00:02:11,795 --> 00:02:14,757
Okay, so I had a feeling
your shower might be kind of a dud,

49
00:02:14,758 --> 00:02:18,291
so I may have sort of hired
a male stripper.

50
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:19,326
Gaby, you didn't.

51
00:02:19,327 --> 00:02:22,308
There he is, so yay!

52
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,354
No. Male strippers are
beyond degrading,

53
00:02:24,355 --> 00:02:27,305
and I don't choose to be
humiliated in my own home.

54
00:02:27,305 --> 00:02:29,305
Now please, get rid of them.

55
00:02:34,401 --> 00:02:37,868
Bree Van de Kamp, we have
a warrant for your arrest.

56
00:02:37,868 --> 00:02:40,123
Yeah, yeah, yeah. She also has
the right to remain horny.

57
00:02:40,123 --> 00:02:41,270
Listen, change of plans...

58
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,319
Ma'am, I'm gonna need
you to stand aside.

59
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,223
Just take the money and go.
And tell the agency

60
00:02:46,223 --> 00:02:48,285
three dumpy strippers
does not equal one hot one.

61
00:02:50,323 --> 00:02:51,393
What?

62
00:02:51,473 --> 00:02:54,401
You're under arrest
for the murder of Ramon Sanchez.

63
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:56,490
<i>What? </i>Oh, my God.

64
00:02:56,491 --> 00:02:58,507
Bree, what's going on?

65
00:02:58,508 --> 00:03:01,066
Oh, I'm sure it's just
a misunderstanding.

66
00:03:01,066 --> 00:03:02,556
Is there anything we can do?

67
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,512
Yes. I just put the mini quiches
in the oven.

68
00:03:04,513 --> 00:03:07,466
Would you be a dear and take
them out before they burn?

69
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:14,462
<i>Yes, Bree Van de Kamp believed</i>

70

<i>for a crime that everyone
thought was shared.</i>

83
00:04:19,065 --> 00:04:21,014
Honey, are you okay?

84
00:04:21,015 --> 00:04:23,376
Yeah, thanks to Bob.
He bailed me out.

85
00:04:23,392 --> 00:04:25,913
- What happened?
What do they have on you?
- Very little...

86
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:29,153
Orson's ridiculous letter,
which is inadmissible in court,

87
00:04:29,223 --> 00:04:31,355
since he's... gone,

88
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:33,429
and a very cryptic
phone conversation

89
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,433
which can easily
be explained away.

90
00:04:35,462 --> 00:04:36,520
Oh, thank God.

91
00:04:36,521 --> 00:04:39,478
Well, they also have
Bree's fingerprint.

92
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:40,504
On what?

93
00:04:40,504 --> 00:04:42,496
A button on the victim's shirt.

94
00:04:43,529 --> 00:04:45,796
When we were wrapping him up
in the tablecloth,

95
00:04:45,893 --> 00:04:47,920
I noticed that his shirt
was unbuttoned.

96
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:49,479
You tidied up the dead guy?

97
00:04:49,563 --> 00:04:51,509
I felt it was respectful
at the time.

98
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,567
Obviously, I see things
differently now.

99
00:04:54,601 --> 00:04:56,604
Wh...

100
00:04:56,605 --> 00:04:59,516
Well, we're not gonna let her
take the blame for this.

101
00:04:59,517 --> 00:05:01,541
- Yeah, we're all in this together.
- Whoa, whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

102
00:05:01,542 --> 00:05:03,559
If we confess,
they'll find out about Carlos,

103
00:05:03,559 --> 00:05:05,547
and they could put him
away forever.

104
00:05:05,548 --> 00:05:07,629
So what? We let Bree
take the fall for us?

105
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,591
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

106
00:05:09,592 --> 00:05:11,708
- No, I'm just saying, we should
think this through.
- Well...

107
00:05:11,722 --> 00:05:12,952
Ladies, stop.

108
00:05:13,576 --> 00:05:16,570
Nothing is gonna happen to me.
The police have no case.

109
00:05:16,888 --> 00:05:18,834
And of all of us,

110
00:05:18,834 --> 00:05:20,926
I am in the best position
to take this on right now.

111
00:05:20,927 --> 00:05:24,887
I have no job, no small children
to look after.

112
00:05:24,888 --> 00:05:26,887
But you do have a halo
over your head.

113
00:05:26,888 --> 00:05:31,846
Yeah, Bree.
It's incredibly generous.

114
00:05:31,847 --> 00:05:33,879
Bob, you swear you're gonna
get her off, right?

115
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,933
Actually, she needs
a criminal defense attorney.

116
00:05:35,934 --> 00:05:38,897
I know the perfect guy.
He's a real shark.

117
00:05:38,897 --> 00:05:40,880
He's not cheap,
but he's worth it.

118
00:05:40,881 --> 00:05:43,842
Well, obviously,
we're gonna pay for it.

119
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,842
- Yes.
- You don't have to do that.

120
00:05:45,843 --> 00:05:48,937
No arguing. You are doing
something huge for us.

121
00:05:48,938 --> 00:05:51,829
Well, thank you, but I promise
you, it's not going to be huge

122
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:55,850
because nothing is
going to happen.

123
00:05:55,851 --> 00:05:57,925
I swear to God,
this woman is guilty.

124
00:05:57,926 --> 00:05:59,914
If she walks,
I am gonna lose it.

125
00:05:59,914 --> 00:06:02,862
You don't have to convince me, but
a jury's a whole nother story.

126
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,826
There's no motive,
no connection to the victim.

127
00:06:04,827 --> 00:06:07,930
Then we have to find one,
all right? Fast.

128
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:10,893
Are you sure you're not overreacting
because she dumped your partner?

129
00:06:10,894 --> 00:06:13,880
I don't think
she just dumped him.

130
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,859
I think she might be the reason
Chuck's dead.

131
00:06:16,118 --> 00:06:17,176
Come on.

132
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:19,130
We need to keep digging.

133
00:06:26,088 --> 00:06:27,937
No. No way.

134
00:06:27,938 --> 00:06:28,946
Carlos!

135
00:06:29,002 --> 00:06:30,057
I am not gonna let Bree

136
00:06:30,087 --> 00:06:32,081
take the fall
for a crime I committed.

137
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:33,771
Okay. Wait, wait, wait.
Before you do anything stupid

138
00:06:33,771 --> 00:06:36,890
and macho and noble, just sit
your ass down and listen to me!

139
00:06:38,086 --> 00:06:39,805
Or stand your ass there
and listen to me.

140
00:06:39,863 --> 00:06:41,134
You can't turn yourself in.

141
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:43,042
Why not?
I'm the one who did it.

142
00:06:43,115 --> 00:06:44,703
You've already been to jail
twice.

143
00:06:44,859 --> 00:06:46,959
You get a third strike,
they're gonna put you away for life.

144
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:49,244
So what, I'm supposed to
send Bree in my place?

145
00:06:49,273 --> 00:06:50,821
Bree's not going anywhere.

146
00:06:50,968 --> 00:06:52,942
The evidence against her
is very flimsy,

147
00:06:52,943 --> 00:06:55,019
and we're getting her
some hotshot defense attorney.

148
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,447
<i>We?</i>

149
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,608
Who is "we"?

150
00:06:57,608 --> 00:06:58,650
The girls and I.

151
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:00,715
We decided since Bree's
in the hot seat,

152
00:07:00,716 --> 00:07:02,595
the least we could do is
pay her legal fees.

153
00:07:02,596 --> 00:07:06,570
Yeah, a... and I'm
all in favor of that, but...

154
00:07:06,571 --> 00:07:09,574
How are
we supposed to afford this?

155
00:07:09,575 --> 00:07:13,553
I just quit my job and I have
a lead on a nonprofit,

156
00:07:13,554 --> 00:07:15,591
but it is hardly
gonna pay anything.

157
00:07:15,591 --> 00:07:18,600
Okay, relax.
Relax. Sit down.

158
00:07:19,645 --> 00:07:21,565
Look...

159
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:24,608
I'm working now.

160
00:07:24,608 --> 00:07:26,583
No offense, but I don't think
personal shoppers

161
00:07:26,584 --> 00:07:28,508
make hotshot defense attorney
money.

162
00:07:28,569 --> 00:07:30,573
Okay, seriously, you need to
keep your mouth shut and lie low

163
00:07:30,613 --> 00:07:32,553
until this Bree thing
plays out.

164
00:07:32,713 --> 00:07:34,774
I just wish that there was
something I could do.

165
00:07:34,775 --> 00:07:36,779
Carlos,

166
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,691
look...

167
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:42,713
this is one of those times
when the best thing you can do

168
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:44,696
is do nothing.

169
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,796
What about his suits?

170
00:07:52,796 --> 00:07:55,746
I'm giving it all away.

171
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:58,753
It's what Mike would've wanted.

172
00:08:02,725 --> 00:08:04,770
I think I'll keep these.

173
00:08:04,771 --> 00:08:08,799
M.J. always says he's gotta
fill daddy's shoes.

174
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,809
So if I save a pair, someday...

175
00:08:11,809 --> 00:08:13,813
he will know that he did.

176
00:08:17,771 --> 00:08:18,771
Are you crying?

177
00:08:18,772 --> 00:08:20,750
No. No.

178
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:27,734
- Can you grab that stuff
on the shelf?
- Yeah.

179
00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:31,192
What's this?

180
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:34,191
I don't know.

181
00:08:34,192 --> 00:08:37,116
Never seen it before.

182
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:40,145
Hmm. I'll grab Mike's keys.

183
00:08:40,146 --> 00:08:44,108
Um, maybe you opening it
is not a good idea.

184
00:08:44,109 --> 00:08:45,129
Why not?

185
00:08:45,129 --> 00:08:48,141
Because it's in your house, in
your bedroom, but it's locked.

186
00:08:48,142 --> 00:08:51,096
So maybe Mike didn't want you
to know what was in it.

187
00:08:51,104 --> 00:08:52,198
That's ridiculous.

188
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,146
I have a box like this
in my house

189
00:08:54,147 --> 00:08:56,129
that I would not want
Bob to see.

190
00:08:56,129 --> 00:08:59,137
Why? What's in it?
No. Don't answer that.

191
00:09:02,104 --> 00:09:05,166
It's probably
just papers and stuff.

192
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:07,108
You're probably right,

193
00:09:07,108 --> 00:09:12,087
but if it's something else,
you may not want to know.

194
00:09:13,716 --> 00:09:16,715
Well, what do you suggest I do?

195
00:09:16,716 --> 00:09:18,728
Throw it away?

196
00:09:18,728 --> 00:09:19,803
Keep it on the shelf?

197
00:09:22,712 --> 00:09:25,695
Okay, how about this... you go
make yourself a nice cup of tea,

198
00:09:25,695 --> 00:09:27,807
I will open it, and if it's
just papers, I'll tell you?

199
00:09:27,808 --> 00:09:29,786
And if it's something else?

200
00:09:29,787 --> 00:09:31,812
I will decide
if you should see it.

201
00:09:31,812 --> 00:09:33,783
I'm just trying
to protect you, Susan.

202
00:09:33,784 --> 00:09:35,719
Men have secrets.

203
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,699
Mike didn't.

204
00:09:37,699 --> 00:09:40,733
He kinda did.

205
00:09:45,741 --> 00:09:47,241
Hey, thanks for
bringing that over.

206
00:09:47,241 --> 00:09:48,208
You can keep it.

207
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:51,207
Who thinks a cake stand's
a good gift for a bridal shower?

208
00:09:51,517 --> 00:09:52,597
Me. I gave it to you.

209
00:09:53,036 --> 00:09:56,063
Oh. Well, you owe me
a less sucky present.

210
00:09:56,064 --> 00:09:59,050
And by the way, I think you guys
owe me a whole new shower.

211
00:09:59,051 --> 00:10:01,050
I mean, when the host
gets arrested for murder,

212
00:10:01,051 --> 00:10:02,988
it kinda puts a damper
on things.

213
00:10:02,989 --> 00:10:04,967
Yeah, weird.

214
00:10:04,968 --> 00:10:06,468
And what's up
with the cops in this town?

215
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:09,040
Last week, they hauled Ben
in about some body they found.

216
00:10:09,112 --> 00:10:10,127
Now Bree?

217
00:10:10,137 --> 00:10:12,139
I'm sure they'll straighten it out.
Thanks again for this.

218
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,035
Who's the cake for?

219
00:10:14,036 --> 00:10:15,980
Tom.
It's his birthday tomorrow,

220
00:10:15,981 --> 00:10:19,975
and I am implementing phase two
of operation get Tom back.

221
00:10:19,976 --> 00:10:22,954
I'm guessing phase one
was a success.

222
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,013
It was great, right up
until he caught on fire

223
00:10:25,014 --> 00:10:28,063
and then realized the entire
evening had been a web of lies.

224
00:10:28,064 --> 00:10:30,013
But right before that,

225
00:10:30,014 --> 00:10:33,996
there was this moment,
this look between us,

226
00:10:33,997 --> 00:10:36,038
like we were
Tom and Lynette again.

227
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:38,009
Really?

228
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:40,955
I could see it in his eyes.

229
00:10:40,955 --> 00:10:43,026
Tom still loves me.

230
00:10:44,947 --> 00:10:46,024
So birthday boy,

231
00:10:46,025 --> 00:10:48,012
what do you wanna do
for your big day tomorrow?

232
00:10:48,013 --> 00:10:50,060
Oh, let's just, uh, go out
for dinner or something.

233
00:10:50,061 --> 00:10:52,947
That's it?
I could have a party.

234
00:10:53,981 --> 00:10:56,593
Invite your friends over,
open up some champagne.

235
00:10:56,601 --> 00:10:57,654
Oh, you don't have to worry
about that.

236
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,624
The kids are throwing me
a little party Thursday.

237
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,669
Oh. Well, then I guess

238
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:05,598
we'll have to come up with
some other way to celebrate.

239
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,602
Sounds good.

240
00:11:07,847 --> 00:11:10,126
Hey. Aren't you
forgetting something?

241
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,313
Oh.

242
00:11:13,108 --> 00:11:15,036
Mwah.

243
00:11:15,037 --> 00:11:17,069
Thank you, but I meant
your divorce papers.

244
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,133
Oh.

245
00:11:18,226 --> 00:11:20,282
As much as I have enjoyed
sleeping next to them

246
00:11:20,311 --> 00:11:22,265
for the past three weeks,

247
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:24,115
maybe they could make their way
over to Lynette sometime soon?

248
00:11:24,203 --> 00:11:26,193
It's just been
so hectic at work.

249
00:11:26,193 --> 00:11:28,187
I haven't had a second to call
the process server.

250
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,154
No, but anybody
can deliver them, right?

251
00:11:30,155 --> 00:11:32,097
I mean, what about
your assistant?

252
00:11:32,098 --> 00:11:34,188
I don't think that
that's appropriate.

253
00:11:34,189 --> 00:11:37,142
Well, I could...
have a messenger?

254
00:11:37,143 --> 00:11:40,142
Jane, honey, it'll get done.

255
00:11:40,143 --> 00:11:42,688
I'm just really busy right now.

256
00:11:42,731 --> 00:11:44,834
Okay.

257
00:11:44,975 --> 00:11:46,966
I love you, and I look forward

258
00:11:46,967 --> 00:11:49,899
to spending many more birthdays
together.

259
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:53,567
You are the best,
and now I really am late.

260
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:54,687
I will see you tonight.

261
00:12:03,963 --> 00:12:05,933
Bob just called.
I gotta run.

262
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:08,833
Whoa. Whoa. Hang on.
What about the box?

263
00:12:08,837 --> 00:12:09,852
Huh? The what?

264
00:12:09,853 --> 00:12:11,844
The box...

265
00:12:11,845 --> 00:12:13,844
that's in your hands?

266
00:12:13,845 --> 00:12:15,861
Oh, the box. I...

267
00:12:15,862 --> 00:12:17,840
actually couldn't open it.

268
00:12:17,841 --> 00:12:19,773
You were up there
for 20 minutes.

269
00:12:19,774 --> 00:12:21,890
I feel asleep.
Man, you have a comfortable bed.

270
00:12:21,891 --> 00:12:24,790
Talk to you later.

271
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:25,857
Oh, my God.

272
00:12:25,858 --> 00:12:27,865
Is it that bad?

273
00:12:27,866 --> 00:12:30,698
Listen to me.

274
00:12:30,752 --> 00:12:34,826
Mike is not defined by what is
or isn't inside this box.

275
00:12:34,827 --> 00:12:38,723
Okay. I have a right to know.
I'm his wife.

276
00:12:38,723 --> 00:12:40,827
I know. I'm just trying
to protect both of you guys.

277
00:12:40,891 --> 00:12:41,802
Lee...

278
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,768
Susan, please,
trust me on this.

279
00:13:10,841 --> 00:13:12,865
Hi!

280
00:13:12,866 --> 00:13:15,145
Welcome to Cumberly's
personal shopping service.

281
00:13:15,236 --> 00:13:16,392
Can I help you with something?

282
00:13:16,392 --> 00:13:20,260
I see we have
very... similar taste.

283
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:23,041
I always work with Margaret.
Is she here?

284
00:13:23,156 --> 00:13:24,419
Oh, you don't want Margaret.

285
00:13:24,569 --> 00:13:27,549
Her idea of fashion is wearing one
normal shoe and one clunky shoe.

286
00:13:28,264 --> 00:13:30,272
She has a prosthetic leg.

287
00:13:30,272 --> 00:13:32,306
And that's why she's my hero.

288
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:37,830
Lazaro! What gives?

289
00:13:37,831 --> 00:13:39,273
You said I'd be kicking ass
at this job.

290
00:13:39,273 --> 00:13:42,043
It takes time to build
a client base, Gaby.

291
00:13:42,047 --> 00:13:43,295
Stick with it, okay?

292
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,313
Five, six months from now,
you'll be our top seller.

293
00:13:45,314 --> 00:13:47,310
Six months? I don't have
that kind of time.

294
00:13:47,311 --> 00:13:49,285
I need money quick.

295
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:52,344
I'm sorry. Most of the ladies who come
in here already have a personal shopper.

296
00:13:52,345 --> 00:13:54,314
Oh.

297
00:13:54,315 --> 00:13:57,297
You know, you could try
the men's department.

298
00:13:57,298 --> 00:14:00,247
You would be very persuasive
over there.

299
00:14:00,248 --> 00:14:01,314
Huh.

300
00:14:01,315 --> 00:14:04,256
Well, I've always been able
to get men to buy things <i>for </i>me.

301
00:14:04,256 --> 00:14:06,080
How hard could it be to get
them to buy things <i>from </i>me?

302
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,260
Mm-hmm. Just wear something
sexy, show a little cleavage,

303
00:14:09,261 --> 00:14:11,285
and maybe lose
the wedding ring.

304
00:14:11,286 --> 00:14:12,289
Seriously?

305
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,319
Oh, yes.
Guys tend to spend more

306
00:14:14,319 --> 00:14:16,331
when they think they have a shot
with the hot salesgirl.

307
00:14:16,332 --> 00:14:18,327
- Lazaro...
- I know. It's demeaning and degrading.

308
00:14:18,328 --> 00:14:22,301
- I shouldn't have even...
- No, no, no, no. I just need to know,
show I lose the jacket?

309
00:14:22,302 --> 00:14:24,301
'Cause these things are
a lot more persuasive

310
00:14:24,302 --> 00:14:26,306
when they're out.

311
00:14:26,306 --> 00:14:29,286
Mm-hmm.

312
00:14:33,298 --> 00:14:36,301
I don't care
what the D.A. says.

313
00:14:36,302 --> 00:14:39,322
There's no case.
My guy's innocent.

314
00:14:39,323 --> 00:14:42,280
Please stop calling it a body.

315
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:45,302
It's a foot, an ear,
and a flap of skin.

316
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:47,331
Do these have raisins?
'Cause that grosses me out.

317
00:14:47,332 --> 00:14:49,272
No.

318
00:14:49,273 --> 00:14:51,301
No. Okay. Look, I gotta go.
Um, my 11:00's here.

319
00:14:51,302 --> 00:14:52,318
Yeah. Okay.

320
00:14:52,319 --> 00:14:54,343
Sorry I'm late.

321
00:14:54,344 --> 00:14:56,322
Uh, not a problem, Mr. Weston.

322
00:14:56,323 --> 00:15:00,256
Mmm.
Call me Trip.

323
00:15:00,256 --> 00:15:01,296
This is amazing.

324
00:15:01,297 --> 00:15:02,319
Well, I don't like to brag,

325
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,247
but I am famous
for my orange-glazed muffins.

326
00:15:05,248 --> 00:15:08,293
Yeah. Uh, Bob said that
you were one hell of a baker,

327
00:15:08,294 --> 00:15:10,314
but he didn't tell me much
about your case.

328
00:15:10,315 --> 00:15:13,326
Well, the whole thing is
quite ridiculous.

329
00:15:13,327 --> 00:15:16,297
The police found a dead man
at a construction site,

330
00:15:16,298 --> 00:15:18,318
and they think
that I killed him.

331
00:15:18,319 --> 00:15:21,305
Yeah. Everyone's guilty
until proven innocent.

332
00:15:21,306 --> 00:15:23,315
They must have something
on you.

333
00:15:23,315 --> 00:15:25,310
Well, they did receive
a letter from my ex-husband

334
00:15:25,311 --> 00:15:27,281
saying I did it.

335
00:15:27,281 --> 00:15:28,321
Well, that's nothing.

336
00:15:28,322 --> 00:15:30,294
The guy's got a vendetta
against you, right?

337
00:15:30,295 --> 00:15:32,248
Yes, he does.

338
00:15:32,248 --> 00:15:33,294
Uh, and then there's

339
00:15:33,295 --> 00:15:35,305
a slightly more damning
phone conversation

340
00:15:35,306 --> 00:15:37,297
in which I expressed remorse

341
00:15:37,298 --> 00:15:40,318
for, um, putting a body
in the ground.

342
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:42,297
Big deal.

343
00:15:42,298 --> 00:15:45,309
You were talking about
burying a dead pet.

344
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:48,264
I suppose I was.

345
00:15:48,265 --> 00:15:50,305
And then...
The police claim to have found

346
00:15:50,306 --> 00:15:53,276
one of my fingerprints
on the dead man's shirt.

347
00:15:53,277 --> 00:15:54,315
Hmm.

348
00:15:54,315 --> 00:15:57,306
That's bad, right?

349
00:15:58,306 --> 00:16:00,318
Actually...

350
00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:02,318
I think that it's Noble...

351
00:16:02,319 --> 00:16:06,252
Noble that you donate so much
of your clothing to Goodwill...

352
00:16:06,252 --> 00:16:10,323
And a shame that that poor sap
ended up with your shirt.

353
00:16:12,286 --> 00:16:13,301
Bob was wrong.

354
00:16:13,302 --> 00:16:16,260
You're not good.
You're amazing.

355
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,319
So you'll take my case?

356
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,305
Nope.

357
00:16:19,306 --> 00:16:21,301
"Nope"?

358
00:16:21,302 --> 00:16:24,339
No offense, but, um,
it's kind of a snooze.

359
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:27,165
Excuse me, but I have been
accused of murder.

360
00:16:27,165 --> 00:16:28,310
My life is on the line here.

361
00:16:28,311 --> 00:16:31,301
Oh, please. What jury is
gonna convict you,

362
00:16:31,302 --> 00:16:34,297
with your... your pearls
and your perfect hair

363
00:16:34,298 --> 00:16:37,294
and your subtle scent
of lavender?

364
00:16:37,302 --> 00:16:38,344
Well, I would think
that a lawyer

365
00:16:38,404 --> 00:16:40,827
would enjoy defending
an innocent client.

366
00:16:40,843 --> 00:16:42,176
You would think so,
wouldn't you?

367
00:16:42,266 --> 00:16:44,297
But I love a challenge.

368
00:16:44,298 --> 00:16:47,305
Last year, I defended a guy
who was found standing

369
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:50,301
over his dead father
with a bloody knife in his hand.

370
00:16:50,302 --> 00:16:53,339
Not only did I exonerate
his guilty ass,

371
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:57,268
I got him 50% of the estate.

372
00:16:57,269 --> 00:16:59,306
That is reprehensible.

373
00:16:59,306 --> 00:17:00,336
Thank you.

374
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:04,272
I'm sorry, Ms. Van de Kamp,

375
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,322
but this is just...
it's too easy.

376
00:17:06,323 --> 00:17:10,323
I mean, people who are famous
for their muffins...

377
00:17:10,323 --> 00:17:12,306
not generally killers.

378
00:17:38,327 --> 00:17:40,256
Good morning.

379
00:17:40,256 --> 00:17:41,323
My name's Gabrielle.

380
00:17:41,324 --> 00:17:44,272
I'm a personal shopper here.
Can I help you?

381
00:17:44,273 --> 00:17:47,322
No, no, no. I'm just trying
to find the men's department.

382
00:17:47,323 --> 00:17:49,273
I need some socks.

383
00:17:49,273 --> 00:17:52,323
Oh, I can help you with that.
May I?

384
00:17:56,315 --> 00:17:58,293
Oh, you're <i>right.</i>

385
00:17:58,294 --> 00:18:01,272
These ankles deserve
so much better.

386
00:18:01,273 --> 00:18:02,302
You think?

387
00:18:02,302 --> 00:18:04,344
I-I've always thought
they were just average ankles.

388
00:18:04,345 --> 00:18:08,293
Average? They're exquisite.

389
00:18:08,294 --> 00:18:09,309
Ooh!

390
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:11,302
Do you work out?

391
00:18:11,302 --> 00:18:15,248
I do
a little mall walking, yes.

392
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:20,280
Well, I don't say this
to every man,

393
00:18:20,281 --> 00:18:24,265
but you've got the perfect
ankles for cashmere.

394
00:18:24,265 --> 00:18:26,290
Let me show you a few pairs.

395
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:32,268
40 bucks for socks?

396
00:18:32,269 --> 00:18:35,343
I know. There's just something
irresistible about cashmere.

397
00:18:35,344 --> 00:18:38,264
Promise me you won't buy
one of these cashmere sweaters.

398
00:18:38,265 --> 00:18:40,298
I wouldn't be able
to keep my hands off you.

399
00:18:40,477 --> 00:18:41,498
Well...

400
00:18:43,473 --> 00:18:46,430
I really just need the tie.

401
00:18:46,431 --> 00:18:48,131
How can you take the tie
without the blazer?

402
00:18:48,164 --> 00:18:49,227
With your shoulders?

403
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:54,171
And this color up against
that beautiful silver hair...

404
00:18:54,172 --> 00:18:58,201
I'm sorry. I lost myself there
for a moment.

405
00:18:58,202 --> 00:19:01,180
Ooh! Hello, George Clooney!

406
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:03,201
It's just so expensive.
I don't know.

407
00:19:03,202 --> 00:19:04,218
You know what?

408
00:19:04,218 --> 00:19:08,231
Maybe I should measure
that inseam one more time.

409
00:19:10,214 --> 00:19:13,171
What if it was drugs?

410
00:19:13,172 --> 00:19:16,234
Seriously?
I just fell asleep.

411
00:19:16,235 --> 00:19:19,247
Oh. This baby's been working
on her black belt.

412
00:19:19,248 --> 00:19:22,213
I'm just saying,
Mike had a drug problem.

413
00:19:22,214 --> 00:19:24,213
Those things never go away.

414
00:19:24,214 --> 00:19:26,231
I'm sure it was
nothing like that.

415
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:28,231
You're right.

416
00:19:30,231 --> 00:19:32,251
It's probably porn.

417
00:19:32,252 --> 00:19:36,188
And you know what?
I'm cool with that.

418
00:19:36,189 --> 00:19:39,221
As long
as it was nothing weird.

419
00:19:39,222 --> 00:19:41,251
Oh, God. You think
it was something weird?

420
00:19:41,252 --> 00:19:43,171
Stop.

421
00:19:43,172 --> 00:19:45,171
Just trust Lee.

422
00:19:45,172 --> 00:19:48,227
If he thinks you shouldn't
see in the box,

423
00:19:48,227 --> 00:19:50,181
well, you don't want
to find something

424
00:19:50,182 --> 00:19:52,210
that would tarnish
your memories of Mike.

425
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:58,193
You're absolutely right.

426
00:19:58,193 --> 00:19:59,252
I should just leave this alone.

427
00:20:03,193 --> 00:20:04,234
Susan, it's...

428
00:20:04,235 --> 00:20:06,238
2:00 in the morning. I know.
But I can't sleep,

429
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:09,221
and I am never gonna sleep until
I know what's inside that box.

430
00:20:09,222 --> 00:20:12,177
So you can either let me in now
or we can do this again at 3:00

431
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:15,177
and then at 4:00
and then at... Thank you.

432
00:20:17,218 --> 00:20:20,217
So there's his passport,
letters from his mom,

433
00:20:20,218 --> 00:20:22,221
a really cute picture
of you and M.J.

434
00:20:22,356 --> 00:20:24,331
Just get to it.

435
00:20:24,332 --> 00:20:26,368
And a checkbook.

436
00:20:26,369 --> 00:20:30,364
Apparently, he set up an account
eight years ago.

437
00:20:30,365 --> 00:20:32,368
That's when we were divorced.

438
00:20:32,369 --> 00:20:34,369
And every month since,
he's written a check

439
00:20:34,369 --> 00:20:37,306
to some woman named
Jennie Hernandez.

440
00:20:40,311 --> 00:20:42,331
I've never heard of her.

441
00:20:42,332 --> 00:20:44,365
This is her address.

442
00:20:44,365 --> 00:20:47,365
Somewhere in mount pleasant.

443
00:20:56,377 --> 00:20:58,381
Oh, my God.

444
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,347
Any chance those are M.J.'s?

445
00:21:00,348 --> 00:21:02,322
No.

446
00:21:02,323 --> 00:21:04,314
Well, maybe it's...

447
00:21:04,315 --> 00:21:08,327
We both know what it is.

448
00:21:08,327 --> 00:21:10,294
There's a child out there.

449
00:21:11,348 --> 00:21:14,364
Mike's child.

450
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:22,142
77, 78, 79, 80.

451
00:21:24,115 --> 00:21:25,168
Hi, Lynette.

452
00:21:25,169 --> 00:21:27,598
81, 82, 83...

453
00:21:27,598 --> 00:21:28,610
What are you doing?

454
00:21:28,611 --> 00:21:30,680
84, 85. Making Tom a cake.
86, 87...

455
00:21:30,681 --> 00:21:35,614
- Gosh, how old is he gonna be?
46? 47? 48?
- 92, 93, 94, 95...

456
00:21:35,615 --> 00:21:37,635
I made dinner reservations
at 7:15.

457
00:21:37,636 --> 00:21:39,622
Or was it 7:16? 7:17?

458
00:21:39,623 --> 00:21:43,623
Nice try, but I am like
rain man. 98, 99, 100.

459
00:21:43,623 --> 00:21:44,658
Sorry to bother you.

460
00:21:44,659 --> 00:21:46,665
Penny and Parker left this stuff
over at our place,

461
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:48,626
so I thought I'd drop it by.

462
00:21:48,627 --> 00:21:50,656
Thanks. I see
they're making lab coats

463
00:21:50,656 --> 00:21:52,648
a <i>lot </i>tighter
than they used to.

464
00:21:52,649 --> 00:21:54,673
I see they're making sweatpants

465
00:21:54,673 --> 00:21:56,690
just as baggy as always.

466
00:21:58,627 --> 00:21:59,671
Besides, I'm not going to work.

467
00:21:59,672 --> 00:22:01,660
I'm taking Tom
to his favorite restaurant,

468
00:22:01,661 --> 00:22:05,635
because, you know,
it's his birthday.

469
00:22:05,636 --> 00:22:07,622
Yeah, I know.

470
00:22:07,623 --> 00:22:10,630
That's why I'm making him
his favorite cake.

471
00:22:10,631 --> 00:22:12,605
Looks appetizing.

472
00:22:12,606 --> 00:22:14,609
Don't forget to add
the eye of newt.

473
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:16,668
Oh, 'cause it's green?
It's a funny story.

474
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:18,626
When Tom and I were
first dating,

475
00:22:18,627 --> 00:22:21,597
he wanted a red velvet cake
for his birthday,

476
00:22:21,598 --> 00:22:23,622
but I only had
green food coloring,

477
00:22:23,623 --> 00:22:26,618
and he liked it anyway,
so it's become a tradition,

478
00:22:26,619 --> 00:22:31,601
one we have <i>shared
</i>for 25 years.

479
00:22:31,602 --> 00:22:33,640
I think we're
gonna keep sharing it.

480
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,606
Lynette,
stop embarrassing yourself.

481
00:22:35,607 --> 00:22:37,622
Tom is through with you.

482
00:22:37,623 --> 00:22:39,631
We have a family together.

483
00:22:39,631 --> 00:22:41,631
You don't just throw that away.

484
00:22:43,623 --> 00:22:45,618
Until you do.

485
00:22:45,619 --> 00:22:47,315
Mm-hmm. What is that?

486
00:22:47,384 --> 00:22:48,405
Your divorce papers.

487
00:22:51,384 --> 00:22:53,379
Tom already signed them.

488
00:22:53,379 --> 00:22:54,442
Now it's your turn.

489
00:22:59,396 --> 00:23:02,438
<i>What </i>the hell?!

490
00:23:02,438 --> 00:23:05,392
Oh, my God!

491
00:23:15,471 --> 00:23:17,494
You look beautiful.

492
00:23:17,495 --> 00:23:20,165
Oh. You're just saying that
'cause it's obvious.

493
00:23:20,174 --> 00:23:21,224
Mwah.

494
00:23:21,224 --> 00:23:23,237
I'll be home for dinner.

495
00:23:25,199 --> 00:23:27,229
Oh, by the way, think you
could mix things up?

496
00:23:27,229 --> 00:23:29,220
Getting a little tired
of chicken.

497
00:23:29,221 --> 00:23:31,207
You forgot something.

498
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:34,187
Oh. That.

499
00:23:34,187 --> 00:23:35,233
Here's the thing...

500
00:23:35,234 --> 00:23:37,798
it's better for business
if I don't wear it.

501
00:23:37,889 --> 00:23:38,893
Really?

502
00:23:38,893 --> 00:23:40,754
I have a lot of rich men
as clients.

503
00:23:40,781 --> 00:23:42,174
If I flirt with them,
they buy more stuff,

504
00:23:42,215 --> 00:23:43,909
which means I make more money,

505
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:47,834
and <i>you </i>can cook something
other than chicken for dinner.

506
00:23:47,835 --> 00:23:49,863
You know what?
I'm not comfortable

507
00:23:49,864 --> 00:23:52,855
with you dressing like that
and flirting with those guys.

508
00:23:52,856 --> 00:23:54,868
Oh, honey, you have nothing
to worry about.

509
00:23:54,869 --> 00:23:56,872
They're just a bunch of nerds
with money.

510
00:23:56,873 --> 00:23:58,035
This just helps.

511
00:23:58,111 --> 00:24:00,360
You can't dress for church
if you want to move the merch.

512
00:24:00,436 --> 00:24:01,485
Gaby...

513
00:24:01,485 --> 00:24:03,472
You gotta shake your rear
to get them to buy the gear.

514
00:24:03,473 --> 00:24:06,017
- Gaby...
- You wanna sell some
knits, you better flash your...

515
00:24:06,063 --> 00:24:08,087
Gaby! I got it.

516
00:24:08,088 --> 00:24:11,096
Too bad.
I have, like, 15 more.

517
00:24:11,096 --> 00:24:13,050
See you tonight.

518
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,059
Lynette?

519
00:24:28,495 --> 00:24:29,545
What are you doing here?

520
00:24:29,546 --> 00:24:32,507
Look, Jane's meeting me
for my birthday.

521
00:24:32,507 --> 00:24:33,524
Uh, Jane's running late.

522
00:24:33,525 --> 00:24:37,549
She had a little trouble
with your cake.

523
00:24:37,549 --> 00:24:38,566
You signed this?

524
00:24:38,567 --> 00:24:41,506
How did you get these?

525
00:24:41,507 --> 00:24:45,565
They were handed to me
personally by your new roommate.

526
00:24:45,566 --> 00:24:47,506
Answer the question.

527
00:24:47,507 --> 00:24:50,506
I did not ask Jane to bring
these to you, I swear.

528
00:24:50,507 --> 00:24:53,494
It doesn't matter
if Jane brought them.

529
00:24:53,495 --> 00:24:55,573
He's gonna need
a few more minutes.

530
00:24:55,574 --> 00:24:58,948
Look, I'm... I'm... I'm... I'm taken
a-a little off guard here.

531
00:24:58,968 --> 00:25:00,929
Can we talk about this later?

532
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,758
This is your signature,
isn't it?

533
00:25:02,806 --> 00:25:03,811
Yes.

534
00:25:03,906 --> 00:25:05,847
When did you sign it?

535
00:25:06,893 --> 00:25:09,143
I don't know.
A while ago, I guess. I...

536
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,247
You guess? Jeez.
This isn't a gym membership.

537
00:25:11,247 --> 00:25:13,804
This is for the dissolution
of our marriage.

538
00:25:13,877 --> 00:25:15,351
Look, I <i>know.</i>

539
00:25:15,351 --> 00:25:16,431
You think I don't know?

540
00:25:18,385 --> 00:25:20,389
This is hard for me, too, okay?

541
00:25:22,414 --> 00:25:24,376
But you gotta believe me.

542
00:25:24,377 --> 00:25:27,356
There is no way I meant for Jane
to bring this to you.

543
00:25:27,356 --> 00:25:31,364
Then just tell me,
what is it you do mean?

544
00:25:35,427 --> 00:25:38,414
Do you want
to end our marriage?

545
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,388
Sorry.

546
00:26:15,389 --> 00:26:17,417
Sorry.

547
00:26:17,418 --> 00:26:19,355
I'm sorry.

548
00:26:19,356 --> 00:26:21,371
I'm sorry.

549
00:26:21,372 --> 00:26:25,363
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

550
00:26:25,364 --> 00:26:28,409
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm s...

551
00:26:44,801 --> 00:26:47,351
Please talk to me.

552
00:26:49,003 --> 00:26:52,804
You know, it's just that you've
had so much going on lately,

553
00:26:52,805 --> 00:26:55,784
I-I-I, you know, I thought...
I thought it would be helpful

554
00:26:55,785 --> 00:26:57,821
if I took the papers over
for you.

555
00:26:57,822 --> 00:27:00,784
On what planet is

556
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:05,792
<i>you </i>serving my wife
divorce papers a good idea?

557
00:27:05,793 --> 00:27:07,809
I thought I was
doing you a favor.

558
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:09,817
<i>Me </i>a favor?

559
00:27:09,818 --> 00:27:11,946
Really? Me?!

560
00:27:11,962 --> 00:27:13,032
Fine. Us!

561
00:27:13,033 --> 00:27:15,987
I just want us to move forward.

562
00:27:15,987 --> 00:27:18,002
I can't stand this "one foot in,
one foot out" thing

563
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:19,994
that you've got going
with your ex.

564
00:27:19,995 --> 00:27:21,029
It's not what I signed up for.

565
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:24,024
I told you
I would take care of it.

566
00:27:24,025 --> 00:27:26,979
Now is not the time.

567
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:29,046
It's never the time, Tom,
until you make it the time.

568
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:31,975
You don't just th-throw papers
at someone

569
00:27:31,975 --> 00:27:33,033
and say, "Here. Sign this."

570
00:27:33,034 --> 00:27:36,028
"Everything that we have known
and worked for is over."

571
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:38,033
It's not that easy.

572
00:27:38,033 --> 00:27:41,016
It is when you know
what you want.

573
00:27:43,025 --> 00:27:45,986
Tom...

574
00:27:45,987 --> 00:27:47,049
I love you.

575
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:49,008
But if we're gonna be together,

576
00:27:49,008 --> 00:27:50,983
you've got to stop
thinking about her needs

577
00:27:50,984 --> 00:27:53,966
and start thinking about mine.

578
00:27:53,966 --> 00:27:57,041
I am always gonna care
about Lynette.

579
00:27:59,962 --> 00:28:03,996
She's the mother
of my children.

580
00:28:06,054 --> 00:28:10,979
So you need to decide
whether you can live with that.

581
00:28:20,012 --> 00:28:23,000
It's gonna be okay.

582
00:28:31,008 --> 00:28:32,982
Hi. I'm looking for Jennie.

583
00:28:32,983 --> 00:28:34,990
I'm Jennie. And you are?

584
00:28:34,991 --> 00:28:38,011
Susan Delfino, Mike's wife.

585
00:28:38,012 --> 00:28:40,007
Oh.

586
00:28:40,008 --> 00:28:41,019
Yeah.

587
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:44,015
I'm so sorry for your loss.

588
00:28:44,016 --> 00:28:47,003
Thank you for your sympathy,

589
00:28:47,004 --> 00:28:51,011
but what I really need from you
is an explanation.

590
00:28:51,012 --> 00:28:53,961
Why was Mike sending you
checks every month?

591
00:28:53,962 --> 00:28:56,007
They weren't for me.
They're for Laura.

592
00:28:56,008 --> 00:28:59,961
Okay.

593
00:28:59,962 --> 00:29:01,958
Who's Laura? Mike's daughter?

594
00:29:01,958 --> 00:29:03,020
No. His sister.

595
00:29:10,004 --> 00:29:12,028
So... this is a group home?

596
00:29:12,029 --> 00:29:13,982
For autistic adults.

597
00:29:13,983 --> 00:29:15,987
Laura's one
of our more severe cases.

598
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:17,000
She can't speak.

599
00:29:17,001 --> 00:29:19,024
Loves painting though.

600
00:29:19,025 --> 00:29:21,978
Spends hours every day
at that table.

601
00:29:21,979 --> 00:29:24,036
Did Mike ever mention
having a sister?

602
00:29:24,037 --> 00:29:25,995
No. Never.

603
00:29:25,996 --> 00:29:27,957
He was great with her.

604
00:29:27,958 --> 00:29:29,957
He came by every Monday night
to visit.

605
00:29:29,958 --> 00:29:32,019
Told me he had softball.

606
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,999
Excuse me a moment.

607
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,032
This is crazy.

608
00:29:37,033 --> 00:29:38,990
No. This is good.

609
00:29:38,991 --> 00:29:40,974
There's no other woman, no kid.

610
00:29:40,975 --> 00:29:43,982
Why wouldn't Mike tell me
he had a sister?

611
00:29:43,983 --> 00:29:46,000
I don't know.

612
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,662
Did he think I'd be upset
about the money?

613
00:29:47,712 --> 00:29:48,920
Because I wouldn't.

614
00:29:49,236 --> 00:29:50,256
I'm sure he knew that.

615
00:29:50,257 --> 00:29:54,239
But why did he think he had
to hide this from me?

616
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,240
I mean, did he think
I was the kind of person

617
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,290
that wouldn't accept her?

618
00:29:57,291 --> 00:29:59,268
Sorry about that.

619
00:29:59,269 --> 00:30:01,227
Would you like to meet Laura?

620
00:30:01,227 --> 00:30:03,261
We'd love to.

621
00:30:14,244 --> 00:30:17,244
His name is, uh, Ramon Sanchez.

622
00:30:17,402 --> 00:30:20,123
He would've stayed here
around, uh, six months ago.

623
00:30:20,171 --> 00:30:21,177
Mm-hmm.

624
00:30:21,313 --> 00:30:23,175
Hmm. Doesn't ring a bell.

625
00:30:23,272 --> 00:30:26,246
But he could be
in my treasure chest.

626
00:30:26,405 --> 00:30:29,425
I keep all the items
guests leave behind.

627
00:30:29,426 --> 00:30:32,434
My husband calls it hoarding.

628
00:30:32,434 --> 00:30:35,442
But I fancy myself
more of a collector.

629
00:30:38,455 --> 00:30:42,430
20 bucks says we're barking up
the wrong crazy here.

630
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:44,390
If the prosecutor
needs more connection

631
00:30:44,391 --> 00:30:46,484
to that Van de Kamp broad.
Trust me. I'll find it.

632
00:30:46,485 --> 00:30:48,475
Must be your lucky day.

633
00:30:48,476 --> 00:30:51,850
Room 208. Ramon Sanchez.

634
00:30:51,941 --> 00:30:52,929
Thank you.

635
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:56,904
Magazine with a map,
some receipts.

636
00:30:56,904 --> 00:30:58,879
I don't think
there's anything here.

637
00:31:00,594 --> 00:31:02,589
He circled Wisteria Lane.

638
00:31:02,589 --> 00:31:05,544
So what? It doesn't connect him
to her. Not directly.

639
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,064
It does if he was going
to her address.

640
00:31:34,924 --> 00:31:36,940
Bob should be here any minute.

641
00:31:36,941 --> 00:31:39,877
You really don't need
your lawyer.

642
00:31:39,878 --> 00:31:42,669
I just wanted to show you
something that we found.

643
00:31:42,723 --> 00:31:43,767
What is it?

644
00:31:43,768 --> 00:31:46,780
It was with some
of Mr. Sanchez's things.

645
00:31:46,781 --> 00:31:49,722
As you can see,
he wrote your address on it.

646
00:31:49,723 --> 00:31:52,714
But that doesn't make any sense.
Why would he...

647
00:31:52,714 --> 00:31:55,773
Look, if this goes too much farther,
there's nothing I can do to help you.

648
00:31:55,774 --> 00:31:57,717
But if you come forward now,

649
00:31:57,718 --> 00:31:59,744
tell me everything
that happened,

650
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:01,764
things will go a lot easier
for you.

651
00:32:04,731 --> 00:32:06,764
I think I should wait
for my lawyer.

652
00:32:07,789 --> 00:32:10,768
Is there someplace
I could get some water?

653
00:32:10,808 --> 00:32:12,799
Right outside.

654
00:32:19,841 --> 00:32:25,512
Mr. Conklin's parole hearing
is tomorrow at... 10:00.

655
00:32:25,516 --> 00:32:26,996
Do you really want me
telling the board

656
00:32:27,025 --> 00:32:28,782
that you couldn't find

657
00:32:28,783 --> 00:32:30,311
the documents
that I requested a week ago?

658
00:32:30,318 --> 00:32:32,259
I-I'll check again,
Mr. Weston.

659
00:32:32,259 --> 00:32:34,339
Don't check. <i>Find.</i>

660
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:54,300
Ms. Van de Kamp.

661
00:32:54,301 --> 00:32:56,288
You okay?

662
00:32:56,289 --> 00:32:58,250
I think so.

663
00:32:58,251 --> 00:33:01,300
Just, uh, waiting for Bob.

664
00:33:01,301 --> 00:33:03,259
They found some other evidence,

665
00:33:03,259 --> 00:33:05,255
and I'm just not sure
what to make of it all.

666
00:33:12,318 --> 00:33:14,283
Look, uh,

667
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:16,322
I'm trying
to help you out here.

668
00:33:16,322 --> 00:33:18,303
But there is a clock
on this deal,

669
00:33:18,304 --> 00:33:20,318
so I'm not sure how much longer
you wanna wait for your lawyer.

670
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:23,325
You must hate
being a detective, huh?

671
00:33:23,326 --> 00:33:25,268
Mr. Weston.

672
00:33:25,268 --> 00:33:27,318
Even a rookie cop knows
that interrogating a suspect

673
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:30,321
without counsel present is
a violation of their rights,

674
00:33:30,322 --> 00:33:34,342
so this must be your way of
trying to lose your gold shield,

675
00:33:34,343 --> 00:33:37,301
and you know what?
I think it's gonna work.

676
00:33:37,301 --> 00:33:39,318
We're just making small talk,
waiting for her lawyer.

677
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:41,346
Well, small talk's over.

678
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:44,665
I'm her lawyer.

679
00:33:44,665 --> 00:33:45,703
Let's go.

680
00:33:47,339 --> 00:33:49,363
You don't need his permission.

681
00:33:49,364 --> 00:33:51,417
You wanna talk to her,
you talk to me first.

682
00:33:51,418 --> 00:33:54,406
Is that clear,
soon-to-be-a-patrolman Murphy?

683
00:33:54,406 --> 00:33:56,389
Good evening, detective.

684
00:34:04,364 --> 00:34:06,409
I thought my case was
too boring for you.

685
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:11,342
It was, but I realized something
that made it interesting.

686
00:34:11,343 --> 00:34:13,397
You may not have done this,

687
00:34:13,397 --> 00:34:16,372
but you sure as hell know
who did.

688
00:34:24,397 --> 00:34:27,056
Thank you. Ooh. Wine list.
I'll take that.

689
00:34:27,102 --> 00:34:28,740
And be sure to bring <i>me
</i>the check.

690
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:31,409
Tonight's my treat.

691
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:33,143
Whoa. Kinda pricey.

692
00:34:33,223 --> 00:34:35,340
I thought we were supposed to be
saving for Bree's lawyer.

693
00:34:35,361 --> 00:34:37,405
We are, but I'm starting
to do really well,

694
00:34:37,406 --> 00:34:39,421
so I think we can afford
one splurge.

695
00:34:39,422 --> 00:34:41,400
I don't know.

696
00:34:41,401 --> 00:34:44,343
Oh, come on, Carlos.
I want to do this for you.

697
00:34:44,343 --> 00:34:45,431
Can't you just enjoy it?

698
00:34:45,432 --> 00:34:48,880
I guess I can do that.

699
00:34:48,977 --> 00:34:50,392
- Gaby?
- Jason!

700
00:34:50,397 --> 00:34:52,346
Hey! I thought that was you.

701
00:34:52,347 --> 00:34:53,376
Wow!

702
00:34:53,377 --> 00:34:54,396
Hi!

703
00:34:54,397 --> 00:34:55,406
Oh!

704
00:34:55,544 --> 00:34:56,569
Whoa!

705
00:34:58,489 --> 00:34:59,509
Who are you?

706
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:02,538
Oh, this is Jason,
one of my clients.

707
00:35:02,539 --> 00:35:05,506
Jason, this is Carlos, my...

708
00:35:05,506 --> 00:35:06,510
brother.

709
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:08,656
Oh, hey, man.
Nice to meet you.

710
00:35:12,264 --> 00:35:14,281
Grab a chair. Join us.

711
00:35:14,281 --> 00:35:15,335
Thanks.

712
00:35:16,348 --> 00:35:18,317
So, uh,

713
00:35:18,318 --> 00:35:20,923
your sister here is
quite the little saleswoman.

714
00:35:20,956 --> 00:35:23,690
You believe she talked me
into a $4,000 suit today?

715
00:35:23,715 --> 00:35:24,322
I mean...

716
00:35:24,323 --> 00:35:28,301
that is so... sis.

717
00:35:28,302 --> 00:35:32,288
Carlos, maybe you should go to
the bar and get us some drinks.

718
00:35:32,289 --> 00:35:35,281
Nah. I'm not thirsty.

719
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:37,931
So, uh, I'm wearing one
of the shirts you picked out.

720
00:35:37,931 --> 00:35:39,883
What do you think?

721
00:35:39,884 --> 00:35:42,853
Oh. I can't tell you what
I think in front of my brother.

722
00:35:42,854 --> 00:35:44,584
You're so funny.

723
00:35:44,664 --> 00:35:45,880
Hey, Carlos, how is it possible

724
00:35:45,901 --> 00:35:48,913
that someone as awesome
as your sister

725
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:50,880
hasn't been scooped up already?

726
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,930
My guess is it's the herpes.

727
00:35:56,289 --> 00:35:58,334
Sibling humor.

728
00:35:58,335 --> 00:36:01,284
You're right. All those trips
to the free clinic

729
00:36:01,285 --> 00:36:03,314
could've been for <i>anything.</i>

730
00:36:03,314 --> 00:36:04,346
Seriously, Carlos,

731
00:36:04,347 --> 00:36:06,317
some drinks for the table
would be really good.

732
00:36:06,318 --> 00:36:07,348
You know, what the hell?

733
00:36:07,349 --> 00:36:09,322
I'll take
a scotch on the rocks.

734
00:36:09,323 --> 00:36:11,280
Uh, a single malt.

735
00:36:11,281 --> 00:36:14,330
Actually, you're gonna have to
get that one yourself.

736
00:36:14,331 --> 00:36:17,306
I am going home to my wife.

737
00:36:17,306 --> 00:36:18,339
I'm married.

738
00:36:26,281 --> 00:36:27,329
I can't believe
you just did that.

739
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:29,321
That guy's
one of my best customers.

740
00:36:29,322 --> 00:36:31,329
Oh, are we talking about
that "nerd" you sell to?

741
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:33,331
Okay, maybe he's a little
better-looking than the others,

742
00:36:33,332 --> 00:36:35,326
but it's my job, Carlos.

743
00:36:35,327 --> 00:36:37,334
Fine. Whatever.
Let's just get out of here.

744
00:36:37,335 --> 00:36:39,323
You are such a hypocrite.

745
00:36:39,323 --> 00:36:41,333
How many times did you tell me
to show a little cleavage

746
00:36:41,334 --> 00:36:43,306
when meeting
your out-of-town clients?

747
00:36:43,307 --> 00:36:46,302
My breasts were practically
a tourist stop.

748
00:36:46,302 --> 00:36:47,373
This is different,

749
00:36:47,374 --> 00:36:49,322
and I don't like it.

750
00:36:49,323 --> 00:36:51,281
Well, too bad.
We need this job.

751
00:36:51,281 --> 00:36:52,314
I'm the breadwinner now.

752
00:36:52,315 --> 00:36:54,338
Yep. Throw that
in my face again.

753
00:36:54,339 --> 00:36:55,342
<i>What?</i>

754
00:36:55,343 --> 00:36:58,342
"Make me dinner, Carlos."
"Get me drinks."

755
00:36:58,343 --> 00:37:00,301
"Bring me the check."

756
00:37:00,302 --> 00:37:03,309
Yeah, Carlos,
I did offer to treat.

757
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:06,310
And you know what I was
thinking? How good it felt,

758
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:08,304
how for the first time
in 19 years

759
00:37:08,305 --> 00:37:09,339
I was able to treat <i>you,</i>

760
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:11,347
and I can't believe
that would bother you.

761
00:37:11,348 --> 00:37:14,330
Well, it does.

762
00:37:14,331 --> 00:37:16,347
It's driving me crazy
that you're the one

763
00:37:16,348 --> 00:37:18,363
making all the money
and calling all the shots.

764
00:37:18,364 --> 00:37:21,323
Well, get used to it,
because I did all this for you.

765
00:37:21,323 --> 00:37:23,289
This is what <i>you </i>wanted.

766
00:37:26,298 --> 00:37:28,293
Uh, give 'em to her.
She's driving now.

767
00:37:43,421 --> 00:37:44,441
You're up early.

768
00:37:44,442 --> 00:37:47,428
I'm up late.

769
00:37:47,429 --> 00:37:49,432
Once, in college,

770
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:52,420
I wrote Mike a letter
about how horrible you are.

771
00:37:52,421 --> 00:37:55,404
And good morning to me.

772
00:37:55,404 --> 00:37:57,391
We'd just had a fight
on the phone,

773
00:37:57,392 --> 00:37:59,465
and I needed to put my anger
somewhere.

774
00:37:59,466 --> 00:38:01,479
Anyway, when you said

775
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:03,458
that Mike had some old letters
in that box,

776
00:38:03,459 --> 00:38:06,436
I wanted to make sure
mine wasn't in it,

777
00:38:06,437 --> 00:38:08,470
so I checked...

778
00:38:08,471 --> 00:38:11,421
and I found these.

779
00:38:11,421 --> 00:38:13,421
They're from Mike's mom adele.

780
00:38:15,429 --> 00:38:17,410
It turns out you weren't
the only one

781
00:38:17,411 --> 00:38:19,106
who was in the dark
about Mike's sister.

782
00:38:19,147 --> 00:38:21,795
He didn't even know she existed
until eight years ago.

783
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,465
What? Why?

784
00:38:24,466 --> 00:38:27,420
It was clear early on

785
00:38:27,421 --> 00:38:30,425
that Laura was going to have
special needs.

786
00:38:30,425 --> 00:38:34,429
I guess Mike's parents
weren't up for it.

787
00:38:36,425 --> 00:38:41,390
"So, yes, Michael,
I am ashamed of myself,"

788
00:38:41,391 --> 00:38:43,444
"and I live with that decision
every day."

789
00:38:43,445 --> 00:38:46,453
"But life with your father
was always hard,"

790
00:38:46,454 --> 00:38:50,395
"and keeping Laura would have
been an inconvenience"

791
00:38:50,395 --> 00:38:52,466
"that might have destroyed
everything."

792
00:38:56,437 --> 00:38:59,428
This was the last letter
she wrote Mike.

793
00:38:59,429 --> 00:39:03,424
"And so now you know
the worst secret of my life,"

794
00:39:03,425 --> 00:39:05,449
"but I beg of you,
let it remain a secret."

795
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:07,470
"Your beautiful new family"

796
00:39:07,471 --> 00:39:10,437
"is one of the only joys
I have."

797
00:39:10,437 --> 00:39:14,387
"Don't let them know the kind
of person I really am."

798
00:39:15,421 --> 00:39:18,421
Mike wasn't keeping a secret
from you.

799
00:39:18,421 --> 00:39:21,437
He was keeping a secret
for her.

800
00:39:24,429 --> 00:39:29,382
Well, I know what Mike
would've wanted me to do.

801
00:39:29,383 --> 00:39:32,404
I am gonna keep writing
those checks,

802
00:39:32,404 --> 00:39:35,404
and I'm gonna keep Laura
in my life.

803
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:39,437
My God.

804
00:39:39,437 --> 00:39:43,445
Adele had to live with that
on her conscience.

805
00:39:46,458 --> 00:39:48,312
Yeah.

806
00:39:48,355 --> 00:39:49,763
How do you do
something like that?

807
00:39:49,819 --> 00:39:52,784
How do you give away
your own child

808
00:39:52,441 --> 00:39:54,450
just because it's inconvenient?

809
00:39:59,441 --> 00:40:02,458
Oh, no, no, no. No,
um, I-I didn't mean...

810
00:40:02,458 --> 00:40:04,445
it's... it's not like that
with you.

811
00:40:04,446 --> 00:40:08,416
No, mom, it is.

812
00:40:11,458 --> 00:40:16,461
All the stuff I've said
about being pregnant...

813
00:40:16,462 --> 00:40:19,421
that I'm not ready,

814
00:40:19,421 --> 00:40:22,441
or that I'm not sure
I'd be a good mom...

815
00:40:25,408 --> 00:40:26,462
It's all bull.

816
00:40:28,475 --> 00:40:33,433
What this baby really is to me
is inconvenient.

817
00:40:38,412 --> 00:40:42,416
I've been thinking about this
all night.

818
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,474
I don't want to make a decision

819
00:40:47,475 --> 00:40:53,421
that I'm going to be ashamed of
for the rest of my life.

820
00:40:53,421 --> 00:40:55,421
I can't live with that.

821
00:40:57,462 --> 00:40:59,466
I won't.

822
00:41:01,433 --> 00:41:02,458
Julie, are you saying...

823
00:41:02,459 --> 00:41:04,400
Yeah.

824
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,429
I'm gonna keep her.

825
00:41:10,458 --> 00:41:16,425
<i>Yes, in life,
we all make plans,</i>

826
00:41:16,425 --> 00:41:21,395
<i>but sometimes they don't
turn out the way we expected.</i>

827
00:41:22,421 --> 00:41:28,411
<i>By trying to help out,
we may damage a relationship.</i>

828
00:41:28,412 --> 00:41:31,449
<i>By attempting to reach out,</i>

829
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:35,436
<i>we may push someone
further away.</i>

830
00:41:35,437 --> 00:41:39,394
<i>By digging into the past,</i>

831
00:41:39,395 --> 00:41:43,436
<i>we may enrich our present.</i>

832
00:41:43,437 --> 00:41:45,461
<i>But then there are those</i>

833
00:41:45,462 --> 00:41:48,461
<i>who refuse to let go
of their plans,</i>

834
00:41:48,462 --> 00:41:52,428
<i>no matter how badly
they're turning out.</i>

835
00:41:52,429 --> 00:41:53,424
Hey.

836
00:41:53,425 --> 00:41:55,420
Can I buy you a beer?

837
00:41:55,421 --> 00:41:57,390
I figure you could use one.

838
00:41:57,391 --> 00:41:58,421
Why?

839
00:41:58,421 --> 00:42:00,416
Trip Weston's taking
the Van de Kamp case.

840
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:02,693
The guy won't quit
till he gets what he wants.

841
00:42:02,749 --> 00:42:06,491
Yeah, neither will I.

842
00:42:06,531 --> 00:42:07,962
So how about
you buy me that beer

843
00:42:08,011 --> 00:42:09,935
when the bitch goes to jail?

844
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:19,115
