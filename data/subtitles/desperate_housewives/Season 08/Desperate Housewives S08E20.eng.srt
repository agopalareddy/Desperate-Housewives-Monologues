1
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:03,940
<i>Previously on...</i>

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,290
<i>Lynette fought to save her marriage.</i>

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:09,230
I could see it in his eyes.
Tom still loves me.

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,660
<i>Carlos decided to change careers.</i>

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:12,540
Maybe counseling.

6
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,720
In one week, a counselor does more good

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,470
than I've done in my entire life.

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,610
<i>Good news...</i>

9
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:19,910
- We're getting married.
- Oh!

10
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:21,280
<i>Came with bad news.</i>

11
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,590
In the middle of his proposal,

12
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,950
the cops come by to ask
about some dead body

13
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,580
they found at the construction site.

14
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,000
So tell me more.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,770
I told 'em that I didn't
know anything about it,

16
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:32,560
and the police don't seem like
they're gonna pose a problem.

17
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,840
<i>But it became a problem for Bree...</i>

18
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,770
We're just making small
talk waiting for her lawyer.

19
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:40,040
- Small talk's over.
- <i>So she got the perfect lawyer.</i>

20
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,010
Let's go. You don't need his permission.

21
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,350
You wanna talk to her,
you talk to me first.

22
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,840
<i>When it came to her divorce,</i>

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,940
<i>Lynette Scavo was determined
to make things go smoothly.</i>

24
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:00,610
<i>So when Tom was late to pick up the kids,</i>

25
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,420
<i>she waited patiently.</i>

26
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:08,240
<i>When he got something in the mail,
she held on to it.</i>

27
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,840
<i>And when he left behind
something important,</i>

28
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,540
<i>she brought it to him.</i>

29
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,300
<i>Yes, after years of fighting
had led her nowhere,</i>

30
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,380
<i>Lynette decided to take the high road.</i>

31
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,100
- Lynette?
- Oh! Hey, Gregg.

32
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,100
Hey. Coming by to see
the new offices?

33
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,740
I bet I could get the C.E.O.
to give you a private tour.

34
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,680
Wait a second. I am the
C.E.O. I know I could.

35
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:33,750
No, thanks.

36
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,830
I'm just dropping something
off that Tom forgot at home.

37
00:01:36,864 --> 00:01:37,850
Oh, wow.

38
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,180
My ex wouldn't bring anything
by for me unless it was ticking.

39
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:40,813
Oh.

40
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:44,770
So... how's everything
going with your separation?

41
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,330
I'm guessing you know the answer
to that, having been there.

44
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,720
You know, it might not
be my place to say it,

45
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,420
but I think Tom's nuts for letting you go.

46
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,560
That's very sweet.

47
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,980
So are you seeing anyone?

48
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,290
That's... a little nosey.

49
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,500
Sorry. I-I'm just saying,
if you ever wanted

50
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,470
to have a drink and vent
with somebody who gets it,

51
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,550
- I would gladly be that person.
- Okay.

52
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,630
Sweet again, but I think
that might be a little weird

53
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,100
with you being Tom's boss.

54
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,370
Yeah, I get that.

55
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,710
I just wouldn't forgive
myself if I didn't ask.

56
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,420
But never worry
if you're gonna be okay, Lynette.

57
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,780
You will. You are the exact kind of woman

58
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,790
that most men out there are looking for.

59
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:30,080
Well, thanks. I-I always
liked this picture of us.

60
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,180
You're welcome.

61
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,890
Oh, hey, I'm off on Friday,

62
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,590
so we can leave early for the cabin.

63
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,090
Uh, bad news. Uh,
I checked the weather up there.

64
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,600
It looks like rain for this weekend.

65
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:43,440
So? I wasn't seeing us spending
a lot of time outdoors.

66
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,850
I think we have a little...

67
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,880
"Horizontal" to catch up on.

68
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,450
It's kind of been a while, hasn't it?

69
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:53,390
Well, I guess, with, uh,
work and everything.

70
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:55,740
A cabin, the rain...

71
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,330
a bed.

72
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,870
It's gonna be a good weekend.

73
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,970
<i>Yes, Lynette had tried hard</i>

74
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,680
<i>to take the high road in her divorce...</i>

75
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,380
Hey, Gregg.

76
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,170
That drink... I'd actually enjoy that.

77
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,940
<i>But sometimes, the low
road was easier to find.</i>

78
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:42,670
<i>Carlos Solis was used to
sitting in a position of power,</i>

79
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:47,340
<i>whether it was behind
the wheel of a powerful car...</i>

80
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,700
<i>at the head of a power lunch...</i>

81
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:57,240
<i>or at the helm of a powerful company.</i>

82
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:03,720
<i>But now that Carlos Solis
had started a new career,</i>

83
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,250
<i>he suddenly found himself
in a much humbler place.</i>

84
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,950
So... what do you think of my new office?

85
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,460
Okay, I'll admit it's a little
bit on the bare bones side...

86
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,600
Are you kidding?

87
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,600
All you need is some yellow tape

88
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,020
and a noose hanging from the ceiling,

89
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,600
and you'll be ready to entertain.

90
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,450
I like it, daddy.

91
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:25,580
Thank you, baby.

92
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,490
Aw, that's so sweet.

93
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,900
You're lying to spare
your daddy's feelings.

94
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,190
Seriously, honey, there's a guy
down at the department store

95
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,630
who dresses all the windows.
Maybe he could spruce it up.

96
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,710
"Spruce it up"?

97
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,270
Gaby, we can barely
keep the lights on here.

98
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,790
Our budget is tiny,
and every cent goes towards

99
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,310
helping addicts,
finding them jobs, housing...

100
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,660
Okay, okay. Save it for the pamphlet.

101
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,600
All I'm saying is, if I was an addict,

102
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:51,100
rooms like this are why
I shoot up in the first place.

103
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,410
Okay, behave. Listen to your daddy.

104
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,460
I'll see you tonight.

105
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,860
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
I can't take the girls to school.

106
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,680
You always take them.

107
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,180
I have to go to work early today.

108
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,810
Well, I'm at work right now.

109
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,190
Carlos, how much do you make in an hour?

110
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,570
$12.

111
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:08,380
I just made $12 listening
to you tell me you make $12.

112
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,290
Gaby, come on. This job
is very important to me.

113
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:13,550
I'm doing very meaningful work.
You should be proud of that.

114
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,750
Well, when we can pay
our mortgage in "Meaningful,"

115
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,770
I will be.

116
00:05:16,965 --> 00:05:17,965
Mwah.

117
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,940
Hey, buddy. How was school?

118
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:27,540
Okay. I'm starving.
Can I have some cookies?

119
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:28,670
Sure.

120
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,170
Didn't you like the turkey
sandwich I made you?

121
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,050
Not really.

122
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,250
I tried to trade it to John Gurry

123
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,620
for a book about worms,

124
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,550
but he backed out 'cause
you used too much mayo.

125
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:44,310
Sorry. Didn't realize
the worm kid was such a gourmet.

126
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,200
What's this?

127
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:48,490
Nothing.

128
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,910
Wait. Your school's
having a soapbox derby.

129
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:51,780
Yeah.

130
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,550
Well, that sounds like so much fun.

131
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,890
It's for dads and sons.

132
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,550
Yes... but it doesn't say
moms can't do it, too.

133
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,880
That's okay. I don't have to do it.

134
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,760
Besides, it's in three days.

135
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,590
Oh. That's really soon.

136
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,080
I guess we should get started.

137
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,820
Oh, come on.

138
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,860
I don't want you to
miss out on all the fun.

139
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,020
Mom, you can't make a car.

140
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,010
What makes you say that?

141
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:24,720
'Cause you can't even
make a turkey sandwich.

142
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:28,830
Well, thank goodness I have
the most talented partner.

143
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,750
Now come on. We're wasting time.

144
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,210
Let's get hammering.

145
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,750
Seriously? You're telling me

146
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,540
you're against the death penalty?

147
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,010
I've just seen too many cases

148
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:41,760
where the wrong person gets convicted.

149
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,720
Not my clients, of course.

150
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,490
Well, I just think
our society's gotten too soft.

151
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,550
We need a powerful deterrent
to stop these killers.

152
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,700
You do realize you're not on trial

153
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,930
for a parking ticket, right?

154
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,380
Kidding. Hey, I'm just...
just trying to lighten the mood.

155
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,320
Tomorrow's gonna be fine.
It's just a pre-trial hearing.

156
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,040
Yes, which brings me one step
closer to the real thing.

157
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,250
So what exactly... will we
be doing at this hearing?

158
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:11,860
You will sit there and
look classy and innocent.

159
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,130
I will try to get as much of
their case tossed as I can.

160
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,780
And your success rate at
this sort of thing is?

161
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,530
Impressive.

162
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,940
I once defended a woman who ran a brothel.

163
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:26,170
At the pre-trial,
I got the whole thing reduced

164
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,790
to operating a business
without a fire door.

165
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,150
That's terrible.

166
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,300
What? What, me being a great lawyer?

167
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,500
No, defending a prostitute.
Call me old-fashioned,

168
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,010
but I find that line of
work rather distasteful.

169
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,100
So-so if she ran a cigarette company,

170
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,930
or manufactured handguns, she's a-ok,

171
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,750
but-but selling men a little ring-a-ding

172
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,800
makes her a pariah.

173
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,340
Okay, first of all, "Ring-a-ding"?

174
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:52,500
Second, sex, isn't a commodity.
It's... sacred.

175
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,000
Yeah, I'll say, and for this woman,

176
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,240
sacred cost 400 bucks a pop.

177
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,990
Can we please stop talking
about it? It's tawdry.

178
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:01,540
And that little crack about
manufacturing handguns?

179
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,490
I hope that doesn't mean you're anti-gun.

180
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,750
I've sued the N.R.A. three times.

181
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:09,810
It is my dream to one day take
those sons of bitches down.

182
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:12,260
Well, when it comes to my guns,
you're gonna have to pry them

183
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,910
out of my cold, dead hands.

184
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,410
- "Guns"? Plural?
- Mm-hmm.

185
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:20,560
What, is that so you can, uh,
coordinate your firearms

186
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,920
with your shoes?

187
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,570
You and I are never gonna
agree on anything, are we?

188
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,090
This salad kind of sucks.

189
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,300
I agree.

190
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,580
Not with the language,
but with the observation.

191
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,320
I have never met anyone

192
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,380
who can pull off a cape
like you, Mrs. Duncan.

193
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,690
And this is our last one,

194
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,730
so I'm not letting you
leave here without it.

195
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:50,000
Uh-oh. Another stray from
the land of elastic waistbands.

196
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,970
Avert your eyes. I'll get rid of her.

197
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:53,970
Hello, dear.

198
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,730
You must have taken a wrong turn.

199
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,420
Sensible shoes are one floor down.

200
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,030
Oh, actually, I'm looking
for a personal shopper.

201
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,410
I need help.

202
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,760
Okay. Um...

203
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:10,710
you're welcome.

204
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,610
Oh, champagne. Oh...

205
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:17,860
Oh, no, no. This is just
for high-end customers.

206
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,910
And me. My husband's an alcoholic.

207
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,320
So I can only drink at work.

208
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,480
I'm looking to freshen up my wardrobe.

209
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,680
I haven't bought new clothes
in quite some time.

210
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,830
I understand. Fixed income?

211
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:33,860
No. My rich husband was
a stingy son of a bitch,

212
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:38,830
and now he's toes up. I am ready to spend.

213
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:39,870
Who was your husband?

214
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,410
William Hammond.

215
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,090
- As in the Hammond theater?
- Mm-hmm.

216
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,420
- And the Hammond hospital?
- Yep.

217
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,340
And the Hammond library?

218
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,510
- So you've heard of him.
- Are you kidding?

219
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,170
I've been to shows in that theater,

220
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,490
I've given birth in that hospital,

221
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,070
and I went into that library
once for directions.

222
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,780
Oh. Well, sit down

223
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,640
while I pull you some clothes.

224
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,850
Oh. There you go.

225
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,160
Well, thank you.

226
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,800
Oh, honey. Look at that cape.

227
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,400
That looks interesting.

228
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,200
Give me that. You look like batman.

229
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,700
There you go.

230
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:19,040
And for the reception,
I was thinking of a jazz band.

231
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,210
Wouldn't that be cool?

232
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:23,190
Eh, I like jazz.
Uh, but if you're interested

233
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,510
in a little, uh,
traditional australian music,

234
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:28,110
I know this guy who plays
a badass didgeridoo.

235
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,080
Jazz it is.

236
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,790
Okay, we've done enough.

237
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:36,730
Let me clean this up,
and then we can go upstairs

238
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:39,600
for a preview of our wedding night.

239
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,090
Oh, now you're talking.
I'll grab some wine.

240
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,070
I know this might surprise you,

241
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:46,740
but I actually have a few moves saved up

242
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,380
for my first night as Mrs. Ben Faulkner.

243
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,830
Uh... it's not that I don't believe it.

244
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:54,720
I just... can't imagine... what's left.

245
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:58,380
Oh, yeah, that's just some,
uh, some business stuff

246
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,690
- that I need to take.
- No, it's a subpoena.

247
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:06,180
You're on the witness list
for Bree's trial? Why?

248
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:08,970
Uh, beats me. I-I th-think
they made a mistake.

249
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,240
Kind of a coincidence, though.

250
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,830
Well... the cops questioning you

251
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,500
about that body they found on site

252
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,040
and then Bree getting
arrested for killing the guy?

253
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,820
Ben, don't lie to me.

254
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,860
I can handle anything you tell me,

255
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,550
just as long as it's the truth.

256
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,470
Um... okay.

257
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,540
Listen, Renee, let's just drop this, okay?

258
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:34,900
No. I'm about to become your wife.

259
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,980
You wanna keep a secret

260
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:39,260
about touching another boy's
didgeridoo at summer camp, fine.

261
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,700
But not about a murder.

262
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,620
Holy crap.

263
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,280
I'm right.

264
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:51,530
Tell me what's going on,
or I'm walking out of this house.

265
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:53,530
You're gonna need to
let me think about it.

266
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:57,720
I don't believe this.

267
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,960
My, uh, my first husband
kept secrets from me,

268
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,930
and it ended our marriage.

269
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,940
I'm not going down this road again.

270
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:18,930
Gaby, why is there an old lady

271
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,700
sitting at our dining room table?

272
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:23,010
Do you have any idea who that is?

273
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:25,610
I think my generic reference
to her as "Old lady"

274
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:26,670
kinda says I don't.

275
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:27,890
She's Doris Hammond,

276
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,620
as in Hammond investments.

277
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,830
Ring any bells?

278
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,180
Bill Hammond's widow?

279
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,820
Guy made a killing in private equity.

280
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,860
Why is she here?

281
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,000
She's my best customer down at Cumberly's,

282
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,130
I think mostly 'cause
she sees me as her friend.

283
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:43,050
Oh. So you thought you'd exploit that...

284
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,400
invite a lonely widow to dinner,

285
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,630
pretend she's your friend,

286
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,010
just to make money off of her.

287
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:48,480
Exactly.

288
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,350
Gaby, can't I just take my plate upstairs?

289
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,320
I'm exhausted.

290
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,260
You're exhausted?

291
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,470
I had to watch a 20 minute iPhone video

292
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,030
of her cat taking a nap
in a laundry basket

293
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,330
just to sell her a coat.

294
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:59,020
Now get out there, lose your top button,

295
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,100
and look pretty.

296
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:07,360
Doris, I can't get over how
lovely that jacket looks on you.

297
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:09,410
Isn't it lovely, Carlos?

298
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,690
Yeah, it's great.

299
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:17,060
Oh, I almost had a heart
attack when I saw the price.

300
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,160
I guess I just have to get comfortable

301
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,730
with the idea of spending money.

302
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:23,310
That's right, and tomorrow when
the new fall line comes in,

303
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:25,110
we're gonna get you real comfortable.

304
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,870
So, Carlos...

305
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,770
what is it you do?

306
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,860
I... work for a nonprofit
that helps recovering addicts.

307
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,390
Oh, I'm sorry.

308
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:43,320
Was Carlos talking about his charity?

309
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:45,020
Good thing we weren't
operating heavy machinery,

310
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,090
huh, Doris?

311
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,630
You'll have to excuse my wife.

312
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,110
Not the biggest fan of what I do.

313
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:53,150
Oh, that's silly.

314
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:55,790
Philanthropy is very important.

315
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:59,460
My Bill gave generously
to many worthy causes.

316
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,610
Okay, if we're gonna keep
talking about charity,

317
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:05,020
I'll make coffee. We're gonna need it.

318
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,800
Boy, Bill left quite a legacy.

319
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,580
Have you ever thought
about carrying that on?

320
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:17,100
Oh, I'd love to, but
I wouldn't know where to begin.

321
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:19,670
Maybe I could help.

322
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,580
So my ex's lawyer says,
"We believe it's fair"

323
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:26,910
"for Mr. Limon to pay
an additional $1 million."

324
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:29,670
And I said... and this is how my mouth

325
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,100
always gets me in trouble...

326
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,990
"So that comes out to what,"

327
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:35,030
"about $1 a pound"?

328
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:38,460
Oh, man. And the judge...

329
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,730
Not amused, which is why I wound up paying

330
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:43,020
an additional $2 million.

331
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:48,130
Ohh. Tom and I are going to try
to do this without lawyers.

332
00:14:48,176 --> 00:14:48,874
Huh.

333
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:50,170
What does that mean, "Huh"?

334
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:51,690
We've known each other 25 years.

335
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:52,640
We have kids together.

336
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,510
And that's great.

337
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:56,780
It's all great, but there
is another person involved.

338
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,840
Jane.

339
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,300
And trust me, she is gonna
be in his ear the whole time

340
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,550
about the settlement.

341
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:05,660
By the way, I do not get
the attraction there.

342
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,220
Well, let's save that
topic for another night.

343
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,700
We can do hours on that one.

344
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,440
Another night?

345
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,080
- So this is going pretty good.
- Yeah. It's been great.

346
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,480
Well, okay, we should do it again.

347
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,930
How about Saturday night?

348
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,840
This Saturday's bad.

349
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:22,420
Tom needs me to switch weekends

350
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,280
because he's going away with... Jane.

351
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:29,490
Well... it'd be kind of a shame

352
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:31,950
if some last-minute stuff came up at work,

353
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,110
and he wasn't able to go.

354
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,720
- Yeah.
- I guess that would mean

355
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:35,720
he wouldn't have to switch weekends,

356
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,970
and that would free you up for Saturday.

357
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:41,030
Did I get that calculus right?

358
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,060
Are you saying in order
to get a date with me,

359
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,340
you'd mess with Tom?

360
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,650
Don't think of it so
much as messing with Tom.

361
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,900
Think of it more as messing with...

362
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:52,960
- Jane.
- Jane.

363
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,440
Oh, my God. It's staying together.

364
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,200
How long is this race?

365
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,000
- Three minutes.
- Three minutes!

366
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,720
This can totally stay
together for three minutes.

367
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,630
Can I go now?

368
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,910
I was gonna have you help
me put on the wheels.

369
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,990
No, thanks. Juanita found a dead squirrel,

370
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,690
so I kinda wanna check it out.

371
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,230
Well, of course.

372
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:17,800
Gotta see the dead squirrel.

373
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,690
Only touch it with a stick!

374
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:22,050
No fingers!

375
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:25,470
Blown off for a dead squirrel?

376
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,700
Boy, does that bring back memories.

377
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,870
New hobby?

378
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,090
Oh, M.J. and I are building
this soapbox thingy car

379
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:35,620
for the school's big race.

380
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,860
You should get Tom to help.

381
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,530
He did it with all our boys.

382
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:39,810
It's how they learned to swear.

383
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:42,360
Oh. That's okay. I'll figure it out.

384
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,530
I am telling you, he loves this stuff.

385
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:46,020
I'm gonna give him a call.

386
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:49,580
Oh, thanks, but I really think
it's better if I do it myself.

387
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,650
But Tom can just...

388
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:54,370
Tom is not... gonna be
around all the time.

389
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:59,930
I'm sorry. I mean, you know what I mean.

390
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:02,430
I do. Since Tom and I split,

391
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:05,580
I know how hard it is
to be both Mom and Dad,

392
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:08,240
but I also know it's okay to ask for help.

393
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:12,500
No. I can do this. I have to.

394
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:16,210
And you know what?
I think it's gonna turn out great.

395
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:30,010
Do you always move
your lips when you read?

396
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:31,420
Do you always comment on everything

397
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,440
that bugs you about me?

398
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,430
I haven't said a word about your tie.

399
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:39,830
Okay, we're here for discovery
compliance, and trial setting.

400
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,840
Ms. Stone, Mr. Weston,
you've exchanged witness lists?

401
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:45,600
The people have no objection
to Mr. Weston's list.

402
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,850
Mr. Weston, any objections?

403
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:48,880
That depends.

404
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:52,560
Who are the gentlemen
from number 16 to 28?

405
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,440
I've never heard these names before.

406
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,810
Your client has.

407
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:59,270
They're men she met at a bar,
brought home, and had sex with.

408
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,150
This is ridiculous.

409
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,310
Your Honor, the defense
will argue that there's

410
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,920
no suggestion of a relationship

411
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,390
between Ms. Van De Kamp and Mr. Sanchez,

412
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:10,830
that she never even met him.

413
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:13,790
- Because she hadn't.
- Some of these men will testify

414
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:16,470
that she was so intoxicated
during their time together,

415
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,920
that she didn't remember
anything about the liaison.

416
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,530
Suggesting that she could
have slept with Mr. Sanchez.

417
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:29,160
So under Ms. Stone's
"forgetful slut" theory,

418
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,290
you can connect my client
to any man in Fairview.

419
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,210
Well, not every man in Fairview ended up

420
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:36,600
with the defendant's
fingerprint on his shirt,

421
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:38,330
But Mr. Sanchez did.

422
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:43,670
Your Honor, the idea that my client

423
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:46,510
would conduct herself in...
in that manner is absurd.

424
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:49,370
She is a paragon of
virtue in the community,

425
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:52,040
a champion of conservative values...

426
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:59,000
Short recess, Your Honor?

427
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:01,750
Bree...

428
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,800
Bree, is this true?
Did you sleep with Ramon Sanchez?

429
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:07,200
No.

430
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,610
But the other men?

431
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,560
How the hell could you not tell me this?

432
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,030
Oh, all right, okay. This...

433
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,350
this is okay as long as
we can stay in front of it.

434
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:26,680
Um... I need to know exactly
who you slept with and when...

435
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:29,360
Are you kidding me? No.

436
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,600
Bree, if I'm going to defend you,

437
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,840
I need to know the truth.

438
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,960
I'm sorry, but I can't
talk about this with you.

439
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,670
Gaby?

440
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,430
Doris, you won't believe
what just got off the plane.

441
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,420
The most beautifully
embroidered chinese silk,

442
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,780
and if you listen to it carefully,

443
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,710
you can hear little children asking,
"When's dinner?"

444
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,970
Oh, I'm gonna have to
stop you right there.

445
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:04,250
Okay, a little insensitive. My bad.

446
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,630
No, I-I've had a change of heart,

447
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:08,920
and I can't buy anything more from you.

448
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,130
In fact, I need to return these.

449
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,500
What? You can't. I work on commission.

450
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:16,320
I-I mean, you love these clothes.

451
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,230
Did you know that one of these scarves

452
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:20,540
could buy a month of vocational training

453
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,720
for a homeless addict?

454
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:25,250
No, but that sounds awfully familiar.

455
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:28,650
It was in the pamphlet that
Carlos slipped me last night.

456
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:30,080
He did what now?

457
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,870
And we talked on the phone this morning,

458
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:35,080
and he reminded me of what
my husband used to say...

459
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,000
that "Those who do well
must also do good."

460
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,500
That sounds like Carlos.

461
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,580
He's a very special guy.

462
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,910
Hold on to him.

463
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,460
Well, now that you mention it,

464
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,420
I can't wait to get my hands on him.

465
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,210
Do you have any idea how much commission

466
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,080
- I stood to make from this lady?
- Gaby.

467
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,730
Doris was my golden goose.
I was fattening her up,

468
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:59,050
and then you went and stole all her eggs,

469
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:01,230
and-and, well, I don't know
where this metaphor is going,

470
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:03,290
- but I am mad at you, mister.
- Gaby.

471
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:06,310
No, stop "Gaby"-ing me.
I will not be "Gaby"-ed.

472
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:09,310
Look, where Doris puts
her money is her decision.

473
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:12,470
Tomorrow morning, 9:00,
she's putting it here.

474
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,600
Okay. You don't have to be so smug

475
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,490
just 'cause you're "doing charity".

476
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:21,080
No quotation marks.
I'm actually doing charity,

477
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:22,790
helping people get their lives together.

478
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,680
And I'm helping people put
their wardrobes together.

479
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,190
Potato, potahto.

480
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:28,050
I got to run to a meeting.

481
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:29,200
Now? We're in the middle of an argument.

482
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,420
Yeah, but it's no fun to
argue when only one side

483
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:32,860
is morally defensible.

484
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,280
But you know what it is fun?

485
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,510
A little victory dance.

486
00:21:37,978 --> 00:21:40,057
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

487
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:49,560
Okay, it took me all night,

488
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,520
and I scraped off two of my knuckles,

489
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,810
and I drank so much green tea

490
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:54,560
that one of my eyes won't stop twitching,

491
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,490
but... it's... finished.

492
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,430
Okay. Before you say anything,

493
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:09,390
I designed the flame decals myself,

494
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:11,570
so if you don't like them,
they're totally removable.

495
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:14,610
but personally, I like them.
I think they're awesome.

496
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:18,480
And there's a basket on the
back for sundries or snacks

497
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,510
or thumb tacks to throw under
the competition's tires.

498
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:24,190
But why would you need to cheat
with a car like this, right?

499
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,540
Are you gonna say something?

500
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,060
Oh, I get it.

501
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,930
You hate the basket. Guess what.

502
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,520
Basket gone.

503
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:38,080
Oh, come on. I've been doing
this for two days straight.

504
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,570
You gotta give me something.

505
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:43,040
I... love it.

506
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,000
You do?

507
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,780
Hee hee! I mean, of course you do.

508
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,850
But seriously, if you have any
thoughts or tweaks, tell me.

509
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:52,410
'Cause we still have
a day before the race.

510
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:54,390
No, no, it's perfect.

511
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,490
Oh, I'm so relieved.

512
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:57,770
You wanna take it for a spin?

513
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,840
Yeah, but... I'm kind of thirsty.

514
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,450
Can you get me something to drink?

515
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:06,300
Of course. Two frosty
non-caffeinated root beers

516
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,780
coming right up.

517
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,460
Oh, my god! What did you do?

518
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,830
I didn't see it coming. I'm so sorry.

519
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:29,880
No, not you! My son! You can go.

520
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:37,380
M.J., did you wreck the car on purpose?

521
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:41,680
No. It just rolled down the driveway.

522
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:44,510
It's a flat driveway.

523
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,810
Okay, I did it.

524
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,980
Why?

525
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,660
I hate that car.

526
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:55,440
Well, then we'll change it.

527
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,380
We'll make it whatever you want to.

528
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:00,450
I don't wanna do it.
I don't wanna be the weirdo.

529
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:04,490
Honey, did someone call you a weirdo?

530
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:07,070
They don't have to.
They're always staring at me

531
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:10,270
and treating me different
'cause I don't have a dad.

532
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:11,980
Oh, honey.

533
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,020
And if I go to the Father-Son Derby,

534
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,120
and I'm the only kid with his mom,

535
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,390
it's gonna be even worse.

536
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,600
I'm so sorry. I had no idea.

537
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,890
What can I do to make it better?

538
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:27,290
Nothing. I just want dad.

539
00:24:39,216 --> 00:24:39,907
Hey!

540
00:24:40,006 --> 00:24:41,780
Hey! How was soccer?

541
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,440
Awesome. I think we're gonna

542
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,960
kick San Marino's ass on Saturday.

543
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:47,990
Nice. You want me to make
you something to eat?

544
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,590
Thanks. I'm gonna get changed.

545
00:24:49,812 --> 00:24:50,813
- Hey.
- Hey.

546
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:55,220
It's cute how her generation
thinks that sport is interesting.

547
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:57,870
Oh, and, um, I will bring
her to the game Saturday.

548
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:00,160
Looks like we won't
need to switch weekends.

549
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,030
I thought you and Jane were going away.

550
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:06,080
Can't. I got to work.

551
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:08,220
Gregg wants me to rework
the strategic plan

552
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,140
the international guys did, so...

553
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:12,010
Huh. Well, that sucks.

554
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,570
Never liked that guy.

555
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:16,110
Then why'd you go out with him?

556
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:20,130
I mean, he said you guys
had drinks the other night?

557
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:23,700
It was nothing. We just, you know...

558
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:26,050
hung out for a bit.

559
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:30,050
You do realize that that
could be awkward for me.

560
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:33,260
Huh. That's weird.

561
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,520
What?

562
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,600
I have an "Isn't That Ironic" app

563
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:39,110
that usually buzzes when
people say stuff like that.

564
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:42,450
I'm serious, Lynette. That's where I work.

565
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:45,050
It was just drinks with a guy I know,

566
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:46,610
who happens to be your boss.

567
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:48,750
I promise not to do anything embarrassing

568
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:52,080
like... kissing in the office.

569
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,180
Okay. You know what? You wanna see Gregg?

570
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,530
It's fine with me.

571
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:08,800
How about if instead of
eating this sandwich,

572
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,780
I just wanted to eat chocolate?

573
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:13,640
Hey. How about... "No"?

574
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:17,390
But what if I told you
something about dad and Jane

575
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:19,500
that would make you very happy?

576
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,210
Then could I?

577
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:24,680
Why, you little finagler.

578
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,820
How do I know your
information is even worth

579
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,970
the fine Belgian chocolates that
I have hidden in the pantry?

580
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,150
Oh, it is.

581
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:35,760
Oh. It would be wrong to teach you
that this kind of blackmail works.

582
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,110
Besides, I can see

583
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:39,210
you're just bursting to tell me anyway.

584
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,660
When dad told Jane he had
to work this weekend,

585
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,160
she kind of lost it.

586
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,560
Really? The chocolate that
I am in no way trading

587
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,810
for this information has almonds in it.

588
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,020
She was all, "We never have time together"

589
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:56,100
and "You still haven't
filed the divorce papers."

590
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,390
Is that true? He hasn't?

591
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:01,590
The envelope is still sitting
on a shelf in the kitchen.

592
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,940
Put the sandwich down,

593
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:06,310
or you won't have any
room left for chocolate.

594
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,390
Well, look who strolled
in from the outback.

595
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:18,900
Where the hell have you been?

596
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:22,590
Sorry. I really needed to
sort through some stuff.

597
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:25,030
Stuff? You mean what hors d'oeuvres

598
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,640
we'll be serving at the wedding,

599
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,160
or are you referring to the dead body?

600
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:35,840
Hey, if you plan on staying,
you'd better start talking.

601
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:40,670
I am impossibly in love with you, Renee.

602
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:44,170
And there's nothing I want
more than to come clean.

603
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:46,280
But if I tell you what's going on,

604
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,220
you could get dragged into this,

605
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:50,270
and then you're at risk, too.

606
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:56,270
You have to trust me.

607
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:59,500
Your ex kept secrets to hurt you.

608
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:02,640
I'm keeping them to protect you.

609
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,800
Okay.

610
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,310
Really? That was easy.

611
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:13,870
Well, while you were on your walkabout,

612
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:15,650
I remembered something.

613
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:20,280
Spousal privilege.

614
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:21,450
Which is?

615
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,350
It's a crazy law we have here.

616
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:26,870
You don't have to testify
against your husband.

617
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,580
So here's what's gonna happen.

618
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:31,650
We say "I do," we walk back up the aisle,

619
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:33,670
the second we're outside that church,

620
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,580
you tell me everything.

621
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:37,280
And if I don't?

622
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,480
Well, then I guess you won't be seeing

623
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,460
those wedding night
moves I told you about.

624
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:44,560
And trust me...

625
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:48,240
my secret is way better than yours.

626
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,990
Ahh, so you are alive.

627
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:59,980
You're just not answering your phone.

628
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,980
I'm sorry. I just...

629
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,720
can't imagine what you must think of me

630
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:05,530
after hearing all that.

631
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:13,180
Bree, listen, I don't judge people.

632
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,520
I defend them.

633
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,560
And if I'm gonna defend you,
I need to know everything.

634
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:21,820
Sexual history from your first husband

635
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:24,060
down to the last guy on
the D.A.'s witness list.

636
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,150
How about I go in the kitchen and say it,

637
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:28,660
and you just... listen from out here?

638
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:31,570
No dice. I need you to say it to my face.

639
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,720
Why?

640
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,440
Because you're gonna be sitting
at the defendant's table

641
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,080
while one guy after
another takes the stand

642
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,400
and goes into as much graphic detail

643
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,990
as the prosecutor wants him to,

644
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:46,040
and the whole time the jury is
gonna be looking at your face.

645
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,580
Oh, dear god.

646
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,860
And if the look on your face is guilt,

647
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,120
they're gonna think you're guilty.

648
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:57,220
So I need you to own
this part of your life,

649
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:00,210
and that starts with
you telling me everything.

650
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,880
Okay.

651
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,610
I hoped it wouldn't come to this, but, uh,

652
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:10,470
maybe it would be helpful if I told you

653
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:12,210
my sexual secrets first.

654
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:15,140
No, it most certainly
would not be helpful.

655
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:17,290
Besides, men aren't embarrassed

656
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:19,040
about their conquests.

657
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,670
I am gonna start talking now.

658
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:23,930
First time I had sex...

659
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,740
I was 24.

660
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:28,210
I was in law school.

661
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:31,540
She was a classmate and
rather experienced.

662
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,870
It didn't go very well,

663
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:35,300
or for that matter, last very long.

664
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,870
Yeah, yeah, it's hilarious.

665
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,910
In fact, every Christmas,

666
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:41,940
I get a card from her

667
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,530
that says, "Still laughing."

668
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,230
So you had an awkward first experience.

669
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:47,470
Who didn't?

670
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:50,740
You want worse? I-I can do worse.

671
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,980
Okay.

672
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:56,580
I don't know how to say this. Um...

673
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:02,420
I am... quite oversized down there.

674
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:06,260
Since when is a man being well endowed

675
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,840
considered humiliating?

676
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,660
I'm talking about my prostate...

677
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:12,090
my enlarged prostate.

678
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,890
Best part... your doctor tells you

679
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:16,960
it only happens to older men.

680
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:20,310
That's the reason you have
to pee 30 times a day.

681
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:24,900
So now you know I'm pushing 50,
borderline incontinent,

682
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,170
and women are scared of my junk.

683
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:30,460
Is that humiliating enough for you?

684
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,040
Yes, I think it is.

685
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,630
Glad to hear it.

686
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:38,580
I have to tell you now, don't I?

687
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,800
I was in a dark place...

688
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:52,520
lonely...

689
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:55,670
and in pain, I started...

690
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,110
drinking... again.

691
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:11,720
So the kicker to the story is,

692
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,290
the new international plan
that Tom came up with is...

693
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:15,590
is pretty awesome.

694
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:17,000
He may not have good taste in women,

695
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,750
but he is damn smart about finance.

696
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,960
Tom is really smart...

697
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,730
in that one area.

698
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,490
Poor Jane.

699
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,560
You're really enjoying this, aren't you?

700
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,610
A little, tiny bit.

701
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:31,170
You should.

702
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:32,580
I wish I had a way of getting back

703
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,390
at Crystal when we were breaking up.

704
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,930
Must feel good.

705
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,930
Jane was pretty pissed, huh?

706
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:38,700
Oh, apparently.

707
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:41,170
So even though that makes
me a terrible person,

708
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:42,410
thank you for that.

709
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:45,070
Anytime. I mean that.

710
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,020
Anytime.

711
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:49,190
So...

712
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:52,040
if I asked you to have Tom
work a few nights this week,

713
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:52,720
you'd do it?

714
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,920
If I could help you piss off your ex

715
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:58,410
and spend more time with you,
I see no downside in that.

716
00:32:58,410 --> 00:32:59,820
You just say the word.

717
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:00,830
Really?

718
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:02,120
Late nights, weekends.

719
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,820
Maybe even a few out-of-town trips?

720
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,040
You tell me what you want,

721
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,950
I'll make it happen.

722
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,930
I like the sound of that.

723
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:14,550
Must be why women fall for powerful men.

724
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,820
And then the prosecutor suggested

725
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:23,440
I was probably so drunk,
that I forgot the whole thing.

726
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,610
Well, hang on. Didn't your hotshot lawyer

727
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:27,350
get all up in her face
with the "Objections"

728
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:28,230
and the "Sidebars"

729
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:29,880
and the "You can't handle the truth!"?

730
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,890
Trip was amazing,

731
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:32,760
but she still said it was admissible.

732
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,750
My entire sordid past is admissible.

733
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,580
So just because you slept with a few guys

734
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,280
means you slept with Alejandro?

735
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,800
More than a few.

736
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,560
Sorry. Carry on.

737
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:47,090
You know what the worst thing was?

738
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,860
The look on Trip's face.
He was so disappointed in me.

739
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,520
Wait. That was the worst thing?

740
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:58,450
Worse than the whole
sharing-a-cell-for-20-years-
with-a-big-gal-named-Vern thing?

741
00:33:58,450 --> 00:33:59,950
Well, I'm not going to prison.

742
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,120
I mean, Trip says we're gonna win,

743
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,610
and I believe in him.

744
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:04,550
I just thank god that
even after all of this,

745
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:06,290
he still believes in me.

746
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,870
Okay, I'm gonna say it.

747
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:14,490
Bree, you have a crush on your lawyer.

748
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:16,240
Don't be ridiculous.

749
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:19,040
You do sound a teensy bit smitten.

750
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:23,560
I am not smitten. I-I happen to
admire his legal skills, and...

751
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,950
His dreamy blue eyes?

752
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:28,110
They're not blue. They're green,
flecked with hints of brown.

753
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:35,380
Okay, maybe I find him attractive,

754
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,590
but do you really think
I would put myself at risk

755
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:38,850
by dating my own attorney?

756
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:39,440
Oh, I don't know.

757
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,730
You put us all at risk
when you dated Chuck.

758
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:46,070
Look, having a crush is
nothing to be ashamed of.

759
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:49,450
He's rescuing you, and it's in our D.N.A.

760
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:51,620
to fall for guys who rescue us.

761
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:55,370
But in this case, it's just
not safe for you to act on it.

762
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,350
I guess you're right.

763
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,260
You're on trial for murder, Bree.

764
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,100
You got to keep a clear head.

765
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,960
And so does he.

766
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:08,060
Doris, I just want you
to know how grateful we are.

767
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:10,640
Your donation is gonna help
so many recovering addicts

768
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,110
get back on their feet.

769
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:14,920
Oh, stop. I should be thanking you

770
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,680
for letting me be a part of all this.

771
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,040
And please forgive
the appearance of my office.

772
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,140
Every penny that we get goes
directly to those in need,

773
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:24,860
so there's not a lot left over for...

774
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,640
nice... things.

775
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:34,200
Those in need, huh?

776
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,100
This is not my stuff!

777
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:39,160
I had a simple wooden desk,
an old coffee table.

778
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:40,740
Oh.

779
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:43,550
And a baby grand.

780
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:45,010
Well, that must come in handy

781
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:47,180
while you're all singing "Kumbaya"

782
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:49,680
during your clean needle exchange.

783
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,770
Doris, please.

784
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:53,120
This is not what we're about here.

785
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:56,330
Find yourself another old lady to fleece.

786
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:05,750
Honey, I need to show you
something in the garage.

787
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:07,240
Did you fix the car?

788
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,890
No. Juanita used the wood to
build a coffin for the squirrel,

789
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:12,710
but I do have a little surprise for you.

790
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,000
Oh, hey, perfect timing, M.J.

791
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,050
we could really use another pair of hands.

792
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:26,160
What are they doing here?

793
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,590
Well, I know I told you
that I could do this myself,

794
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:31,620
but I got to thinking
that every race car driver

795
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:34,310
has a pit crew, and this is yours.

796
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:35,750
We're here to help you.

797
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:38,130
And not just about car stuff, you know?

798
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:40,570
Anytime you need something,
give us a call.

799
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,620
- So what do you think of this design?
- Hey?

800
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:46,130
It... kind of looks like a Corvette.

801
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:48,400
Kind of? It's an exact rendering.

802
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,150
Look at the shading on the wheel well.

803
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:52,640
Calm down. You traced
it out of a magazine.

804
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,700
Can you guys really build this?

805
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,630
Um, well... not without your help.

806
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:01,160
So what do you think about color?

807
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,290
Red or blue?

808
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:05,340
Mom? What do you think?

809
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:09,630
I think, uh... this is
kind of a guy thing,

810
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,570
and I should let you guys get to work.

811
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,560
My dad loved Corvettes.

812
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:15,750
We know.

813
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:17,340
He always said if he ever won the lottery,

814
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:21,510
first thing he'd do is buy a
Corvette stingray convertible.

815
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:32,580
Come on in.

816
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:36,540
- Whoa. You look like a million bucks.
- Aw.

817
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,700
And trust me, I know what
a million bucks looks like.

818
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,470
What a lovely compliment...

819
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,180
for one of us.

820
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:45,610
So, uh, Gallo is
the best restaurant in town,

821
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:47,690
and after tonight, you will know why.

822
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:49,980
Well, can't wait.

823
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,260
Let's go.

824
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:56,490
But first... I have a gift for you.

825
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:01,410
A nail.

826
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:02,720
How thoughtful...

827
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,430
and... imaginary.

828
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:07,830
A nail in the coffin of Tom's happiness.

829
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:10,410
The end of Tom and Jane.

830
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,870
Completely baffled.

831
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:13,800
Every time this week
I told him I needed him late,

832
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,970
Tom would go in his office,

833
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:18,210
and I'd hear him on the phone
in a big fight with Jane.

834
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:21,530
You shouldn't be telling me this.

835
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,130
But... yay!

836
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:26,580
So how do you think
the persnickety Ms. Carlson

837
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:29,030
will handle the news of Tom's transfer?

838
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,560
His what?

839
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,970
The international plan needs a point man,

840
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:37,130
so I'm sending Tom to Mumbai for a year.

841
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:42,300
M-Mumbai like... India Mumbai?

842
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:46,260
Which means you and I will have Fairview

843
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,830
all to ourselves.

844
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,110
We got to go.

845
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,660
Lynette?

846
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:56,780
- Car.
- Huh?

847
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,100
I can't believe you did that to my office.

848
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,120
I had a butler lined up,

849
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,390
but he booked a commercial
at the last minute.

850
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:10,520
So I guess I'll call Doris
now and make an appointment

851
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,990
for shopping tomorrow.

852
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:14,040
Yeah, I don't think she'll be
answering either of our calls.

853
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,670
She thinks we're both nuts,
so thanks a lot, Gaby.

854
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,750
You started it. You're
the one who stole her from me

855
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:19,730
in the first place.

856
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:21,640
Yeah, for something that matters.

857
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,090
Oh, enough with
the Carlos of Nazareth act.

858
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,340
This wasn't about helping people.

859
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,990
This was about you smelling money

860
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,590
and going after it.

861
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:32,050
The money was for the center.
Those people need it.

862
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:35,080
The center? Please.
You were doing it to win.

863
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,220
And you know why?

864
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:38,320
'Cause you're a shark, Carlos.

865
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,320
You always have been,
and you always will be.

866
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,900
It's your nature.

867
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,060
Honey.

868
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,650
It's okay. I am, too.

869
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:54,430
That's why we're good together.

870
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,890
Look, I may not like that
you stole Doris from me,

871
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:02,240
but I do like that you're
the type of guy who can.

872
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,770
It's sexy.

873
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:05,570
But...

874
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:08,260
that's not who I want to be anymore.

875
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,060
Well, who do you want to be?

876
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,040
Somebody different.

877
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:16,640
Well, I hate to tell you this, babe,

878
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,560
but the best you can hope to be

879
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,490
is just a different kind of shark.

880
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:28,890
<i>Yes, it isn't easy giving up power...</i>

881
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:33,630
<i>admitting that we might need help</i>

882
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,510
<i>from friends and neighbors...</i>

883
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,460
<i>Deciding that a loved one...</i>

884
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,420
<i>might know what's best for us.</i>

885
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:48,670
<i>Giving up our better judgment</i>

886
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:52,240
<i>for a slightly darker agenda.</i>

887
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,590
<i>But for some,</i>

888
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,390
<i>the hardest kind of power to give up...</i>

889
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:04,980
<i>is the power to control their own desires.</i>

890
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:08,600
Hello. You wanted to see me?

891
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,880
Did you, uh, have some
new thoughts on the case?

892
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:14,950
Lots, but why don't
we discuss them over dinner?

893
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:18,120
Dinner. Um, can't we talk here?

894
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,440
No, I've been cooped up all day,

895
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:21,820
and I know this great,
little Italian place.

896
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,370
I don't think that's a good idea.

897
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:25,550
Oh, come on. I'm a much better lawyer

898
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,790
after a plate of spaghetti carbonara.

899
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:31,650
So? What do you say?

900
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:34,080
I say...

901
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:38,600
let's do it.
