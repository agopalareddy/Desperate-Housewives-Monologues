<i>Previously on
"Desperate Housewives"...</i>

2
00:00:04,126 --> 00:00:06,203
<i>Susan made a decision.</i>

3
00:00:06,204 --> 00:00:08,699
I'm gonna sell this house and
move back up there with you

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:10,261
and help raise the baby.

5
00:00:10,286 --> 00:00:11,499
- What about Porter?
- Well...

6
00:00:11,524 --> 00:00:14,839
There will always be a place for him
in this child's life.

7
00:00:14,891 --> 00:00:17,519
<i>Karen's health took a turn
for the worse.</i>

8
00:00:17,544 --> 00:00:20,946
Looks like the cancer's spreading
faster than anyone thought.

00:00:20,947 --> 00:00:22,978
<i>Ben was summoned
before the court.</i>

10
00:00:22,979 --> 00:00:25,749
You're on a witness list
for Bree's trial?

11
00:00:25,799 --> 00:00:27,937
<i>Bree's friends cautioned her.</i>

12
00:00:27,938 --> 00:00:30,225
You have a crush on your lawyer.

13
00:00:30,244 --> 00:00:33,454
You're on trial for murder, Bree.
You gotta keep a clear head.

14
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:34,999
And so does he.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,663
<i>Lynette ended her relationship
with Tom's boss.</i>

16
00:00:38,688 --> 00:00:41,612
She dumped me. Apparently she's
hung up on some other guy.

17
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:42,978
<i>And this led...</i>

18
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:45,953
You really suck
at this gay friend thing.

19
00:00:45,954 --> 00:00:48,259
I can't take you seriously
in that dress.

20
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:52,319
<i>To an unfortunate
misunderstanding.</i>

21
00:00:58,904 --> 00:01:02,125
<i>(Mary Alice) Karen McCluskey
had never been sure</i>

22
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:04,945
<i>what her neighbors thought
of her.</i>

23
00:01:06,598 --> 00:01:09,991
<i>Did they see her
as merely a babysitter...</i>

24
00:01:11,987 --> 00:01:14,994
<i>An entertaining source
for gossip...</i>

25
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:20,975
<i>Or just the mean old lady
who lived down the street?</i>

26
00:01:22,956 --> 00:01:25,667
<i>But for the first time
in her life,</i>

27
00:01:25,704 --> 00:01:29,137
<i>she found herself thinking
about such things...</i>

28
00:01:31,598 --> 00:01:34,529
<i>Because she knew that her life</i>

29
00:01:34,905 --> 00:01:37,142
<i>was coming to an end.</i>

30
00:01:37,185 --> 00:01:38,993
Roy, it's time to go!

31
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:43,670
What's going on, Karen?

32
00:01:44,023 --> 00:01:47,344
(Voice breaks) I'm, uh,
starting hospice care.

33
00:01:47,644 --> 00:01:49,928
I thought you told the doctors
that you wanted to...

34
00:01:49,929 --> 00:01:52,731
Croak at home? Yeah, I did.

35
00:01:52,768 --> 00:01:56,056
But the oncologist is convinced
this is for the best.

36
00:01:56,168 --> 00:01:57,885
What does he know?

37
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,966
Young quack thinks
I can't take care of wife.

38
00:02:00,967 --> 00:02:02,941
He's worried about you, Roy.

39
00:02:02,942 --> 00:02:04,978
You've got
high blood pressure, angina.

40
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:06,917
I'm racing you to the grave
as it is.

41
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:08,899
I don't want to push you in.

44
00:02:15,965 --> 00:02:18,903
- I know.
- Hang on.

45
00:02:18,904 --> 00:02:20,920
Karen...

46
00:02:20,921 --> 00:02:22,907
Would you prefer
to die at home?

47
00:02:22,908 --> 00:02:25,004
- Well, sure, but...
- Then...

48
00:02:27,942 --> 00:02:32,016
- We'll take care of you.
- Yeah. We can do it.

49
00:02:32,357 --> 00:02:34,582
We'll take shifts.
It won't be hard.

50
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:37,961
Whoa, Nelly.
No, this is sweet,

51
00:02:38,305 --> 00:02:41,982
but you gals have troubles of your own.
Bree's got her trial.

52
00:02:41,983 --> 00:02:44,632
Lynette's marriage
is falling apart.

53
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:47,982
Gaby, those kids of yours are turning
into serial killers before our very eyes.

54
00:02:47,983 --> 00:02:50,719
Okay, I'm not gonna argue
with you because you're sick...

55
00:02:50,756 --> 00:02:52,594
And totally correct.

56
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:55,850
But I'm with the girls on this.
Let us take care of you.

57
00:02:56,144 --> 00:02:58,734
I'm gonna require a lot of care,
you know.

58
00:02:58,802 --> 00:03:01,904
We know, and we're gonna
be there for you.

59
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,365
Hey, boy nurses!

60
00:03:06,396 --> 00:03:08,978
Bring the stuff back
in the house! She's staying.

61
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:11,900
- Come on. Let's go help.
- (Gaby chuckles) Okay.

62
00:03:11,903 --> 00:03:14,007
I'm... actually speechless.

63
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:16,737
I don't know why
you're all doing this.

64
00:03:16,788 --> 00:03:18,417
Don't you?

65
00:03:18,904 --> 00:03:21,941
<i>Yes, Mrs. McCluskey
had wondered</i>

66
00:03:21,942 --> 00:03:24,016
<i>what her neighbors thought
of her.</i>

67
00:03:24,017 --> 00:03:28,284
<i>She was pleased to discover
after all these years,</i>

68
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:31,728
<i>they thought of her
as a friend.</i>

<i>The town of Fairview
had been rocked by scandal.</i>

72
00:03:46,012 --> 00:03:49,450
<i>A housewife had been accused
of murder,</i>

73
00:03:49,494 --> 00:03:53,899
<i>and her trial was growing
more sensational each day.</i>

74
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,670
<i>It truly was

75
00:03:57,686 --> 00:03:58,957
- (Camera shutter clicks)

76
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,616
<i>Which is exactly
what another housewife</i>

77
00:04:01,653 --> 00:04:03,916

- (Closes door)
- Ah, there you are.

81
00:04:11,934 --> 00:04:14,974
Yep, just sitting here on the porch,
reading the ol'...

82
00:04:14,975 --> 00:04:16,974
Sports section.

83
00:04:16,975 --> 00:04:19,003
You hate sports...

84
00:04:19,004 --> 00:04:20,991
And reading.

85
00:04:20,992 --> 00:04:23,617
But I love you,
and you love sports,

86
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:27,368
so I've... started
to <i>really </i>get into it.

87
00:04:27,411 --> 00:04:28,899
<i>Really?</i>

88
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,929
What's your... favorite
basketball team?

89
00:04:33,715 --> 00:04:35,690
The... "Turtles".

90
00:04:41,938 --> 00:04:44,961
- What the hell is this?
- It's nothing.

91
00:04:44,962 --> 00:04:49,593
- You said the trial was going well.
- It was. It is! This is just a setback.

92
00:04:49,618 --> 00:04:52,475
Damn it! How... Gaby, how many
setbacks is it gonna take

93
00:04:52,507 --> 00:04:54,928
before Bree goes to prison
for something I did?!

94
00:04:54,929 --> 00:04:57,907
Hey, Lee! Sports talk.

95
00:04:57,908 --> 00:05:00,557
Gettin' a little heated
over here! (Chuckles)

96
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:06,571
I can't do this anymore, Gaby.
I have got to step up.

97
00:05:06,589 --> 00:05:08,443
Are you crazy? No!

98
00:05:08,461 --> 00:05:10,903
How do you not feel
guilty about this?

99
00:05:10,904 --> 00:05:12,928
I do, every second
of every day.

100
00:05:12,929 --> 00:05:14,945
We just have to hold on
a little longer.

101
00:05:14,946 --> 00:05:17,979
Bree says Trip knows what he's doing,
so we've just gotta give him a chance.

102
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,899
Yeah, I-I don't know.
I mean...

103
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,920
Turning yourself in now
would just be foolish.

104
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:25,739
You'd be throwing your whole life away,
abandoning our family. And for what?

105
00:05:25,777 --> 00:05:28,873
To prove a point about
what an honorable guy you are?

106
00:05:28,892 --> 00:05:30,957
Please, let's just see
how this plays out.

107
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,967
Okay.
(Sighs)

108
00:05:32,968 --> 00:05:35,256
But if things get any worse,
I'll have no choice.

109
00:05:35,286 --> 00:05:37,222

110
00:05:38,979 --> 00:05:40,674
(Sighs deeply)

111
00:05:43,954 --> 00:05:46,924
- Lee! No!
- What?

112
00:05:46,925 --> 00:05:49,008
- (Lowered voice) Stop!
- Don't tell me you've changed your mind.

113
00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:51,745
Oh! No. I still wanna sell.

114
00:05:51,776 --> 00:05:53,907
Thank God, 'cause I've already
spent my commission.

115
00:05:53,908 --> 00:05:56,937
- On what?
- Isn't it obvious?

116
00:05:56,938 --> 00:05:59,357
I had some
personal renovations done.

117
00:06:01,137 --> 00:06:02,883
(Whispers) Ahh.

118
00:06:03,908 --> 00:06:06,276
My ass!
I had my ass lifted.

119
00:06:06,476 --> 00:06:09,953
Oh!
Um... of course.

120
00:06:09,954 --> 00:06:11,949
How did I not notice?

121
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,924
That is one...

122
00:06:13,925 --> 00:06:16,911
Perky Fanny.
(Chuckles)

123
00:06:16,912 --> 00:06:19,916
I'm sorry. I've never been good
with ass compliments.

124
00:06:19,917 --> 00:06:23,928
- So why don't you want the sign up?
- Well... (Sighs)

125
00:06:23,929 --> 00:06:26,916
I haven't told the girls
I'm moving yet.

126
00:06:26,917 --> 00:06:29,000
- Why not?
- I don't know. (Sighs)

127
00:06:29,001 --> 00:06:32,911
Maybe because I can't even
believe I'm doing it myself.

128
00:06:32,912 --> 00:06:35,907
- It's always hard to move.
- Yeah.

129
00:06:35,908 --> 00:06:37,998
Putting my house on the market
in the middle of Bree's trial?

130
00:06:37,999 --> 00:06:40,458
I mean, I just feel like
a bad person.

131
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,945
Okay, the fact that you're
worried about your friend

132
00:06:42,963 --> 00:06:44,945
shows that you're not
a bad person.

133
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,231
(Sighs)

134
00:06:46,256 --> 00:06:49,622
By the way, if Bree gets convicted, do you
think she'll put her place on the market?

135
00:06:49,647 --> 00:06:51,508
- Lee!
- And if Lynette gets divorced,

136
00:06:51,526 --> 00:06:53,661
that house is gonna be
way too big for her.

137
00:06:53,692 --> 00:06:56,820
(Smack) Wow! I...

138
00:06:56,952 --> 00:06:58,977
It kinda smacked me back.

139
00:07:04,356 --> 00:07:06,953
(Cell phone rings)

140
00:07:06,954 --> 00:07:10,007
(Ring) (Grunts)
(Beep)

141
00:07:10,032 --> 00:07:12,004
Hello?
(Lowered voice) She's gone.

142
00:07:12,005 --> 00:07:14,777
Hey, Penny! What's going on?
Where are ya?

143
00:07:14,808 --> 00:07:17,903
Dad's. Did you hear me?
Jane's gone.

144
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:22,235
Whoa. Whoa. She's "gone" meaning...
She's not there right now?

145
00:07:22,262 --> 00:07:24,336
Or... or she's gone <i>gone?</i>

146
00:07:24,366 --> 00:07:26,916
<i>Her stuff is moved out.</i>

147
00:07:26,917 --> 00:07:29,570
Even her toothbrush, mom!

148
00:07:29,595 --> 00:07:32,920
- They broke up!
- Oh, my...

149
00:07:32,921 --> 00:07:36,817
Hang on.
(Gasps) Your dad's on the other line!

150
00:07:36,861 --> 00:07:38,920
Call me back!
Okay! Stay calm!

151
00:07:38,921 --> 00:07:41,621
- I am.
- I was talking to me!

152
00:07:41,646 --> 00:07:45,924
- Hey, Tom. What's up?
- Hey, are you gonna be around tonight?

153
00:07:45,925 --> 00:07:49,480
Uh... I don't know.
Maybe. Probably.

154
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:50,903
Yeah. Why?

155
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:54,318
Um, I need to talk to you about something,
and I'd... I'd like to do it face-to-face.

156
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:57,547
- Oh, okay. What time?
- (Sighs) How about 8:00?

157
00:07:57,585 --> 00:07:59,920
8:00?
8:00 is my favorite time.

158
00:07:59,921 --> 00:08:03,491
- What? Why?
- I don't know. It just... always has been.

159
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:06,953
You know, eight is great.

160
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:09,374
- You okay?
<i>- Uh, me? Oh, yeah. I'm just...</i>

161
00:08:09,418 --> 00:08:10,954
- (Bang)
- Cleaning the oven and...

162
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:12,917
(Clatters)
The fumes are getting to me,

163
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,408
and I'm drunk... a little.
(Laughs nervously)

164
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:16,928
So I'll see you tonight?

165
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:17,883
O-okay. Bye.

166
00:08:17,884 --> 00:08:20,587
Okay. Bye! (Chuckles) (Beep)

167
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,987
(High-pitched voice) Yeah!

168
00:08:22,005 --> 00:08:23,978
(Chuckles)

169
00:08:23,979 --> 00:08:26,979
(Indistinct conversations)

170
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:32,789
Thank you.

171
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,986
Yeah, mm. Don't
thank me just yet.

172
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:38,829
Mm. Bree...
I don't know exactly.

173
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:41,834
what Ben is gonna testify about,
but if it's as damning

174
00:08:41,847 --> 00:08:43,852
as the prosecution seems
to think it is...

175
00:08:43,877 --> 00:08:45,458
You don't have to
worry about Ben.

176
00:08:45,477 --> 00:08:48,342
If his testimony is damaging
in any way,

177
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,993
- I'm gonna have to put Gaby back on the stand.
- No.

178
00:08:55,631 --> 00:08:57,978
(Lowered voice) The dead guy
was her stepfather.

179
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,424
She has some connection
to this.

180
00:09:00,455 --> 00:09:02,055
Absolutely not.

181
00:09:02,087 --> 00:09:03,948
(Whispering) I'm the client.
You're the lawyer.

182
00:09:03,949 --> 00:09:06,469
- You have to do what I say.
- It's your call.

183
00:09:06,506 --> 00:09:07,915
But I've gotta tell you,
you're forcing me

184
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,919
to try this thing with one hand
tied behind my back.

185
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,676
Well, luckily, you have
more talent in that one hand

186
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,941
than most lawyers have
in their whole body.

187
00:09:14,942 --> 00:09:16,916
You can do this.

188
00:09:16,917 --> 00:09:18,925
I know you can.

189
00:09:23,845 --> 00:09:26,882
Mr. Faulkner,
I am ordering you to answer.

190
00:09:26,907 --> 00:09:29,030
Ms. Stone, repeat your question.

191
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,916
During your phone conversation
with the defendant,

192
00:09:31,917 --> 00:09:33,974
she thanked you
for protecting her.

193
00:09:33,975 --> 00:09:35,916
What was she referring to?

194
00:09:36,946 --> 00:09:39,596
I'm sorry. I really don't
remember the conversation.

195
00:09:40,477 --> 00:09:42,783
Maybe this will refresh
your memory.

196
00:09:43,942 --> 00:09:45,917
- Your honor?
- Go ahead.

197
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:47,886
Mm. (Click)

198
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:50,719
<i>(Bree) I know, but even when
suspicion moved on to you,</i>

199
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,953
<i>you still protected me,
and that's very honorable.</i>

200
00:09:52,954 --> 00:09:55,907
<i>- (Ben) Really, it was no big deal.
- Maybe not to you.</i>

201
00:09:55,908 --> 00:09:58,222
<i>You're not the one
who put a body in the ground.</i>

202
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:00,719
<i>You have to understand,
a day doesn't go by</i>

203
00:10:00,731 --> 00:10:03,916
<i>when that does not
weigh heavily on my conscience.</i>

204
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:05,504
(Click)

205
00:10:05,535 --> 00:10:06,937
So...

206
00:10:07,797 --> 00:10:10,831
What were you protecting her from?

207
00:10:12,437 --> 00:10:17,063
Again, sir, I'm ordering you to answer
the prosecutor's questions.

208
00:10:18,711 --> 00:10:22,326
All right. I've had enough.
You're in contempt.

209
00:10:22,351 --> 00:10:26,622
Bailiff, take Mr. Faulkner into custody.
Perhaps a night in jail

210
00:10:26,647 --> 00:10:28,911
will help him to see things
differently.

211
00:10:28,912 --> 00:10:32,916
- Can I at least make a call?
- One call. We're in recess.

212
00:10:32,917 --> 00:10:34,398
(Bangs gavel)

213
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,561
(Lowered voice)
So they're arresting him?

214
00:10:36,938 --> 00:10:39,410
- What happens now?
- They'll bring him back tomorrow.

215
00:10:39,442 --> 00:10:41,845
The D.A. will ask
the same question again.

216
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,899
And what if
he still doesn't answer?

217
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,903
Frankly, Bree,
I'm more worried if he does.

218
00:10:57,925 --> 00:10:59,992
(Shifts gears)
(Turns off engine)

219
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,140
(Gasps)

220
00:11:02,451 --> 00:11:04,471
Oh!

221
00:11:04,859 --> 00:11:07,346
Oh, my goodness, Renee.
You startled me.

222
00:11:07,603 --> 00:11:10,899
- Is everything all right?
- No, it's not.

223
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:14,327
I just got a phone call
from Ben. He's in jail.

224
00:11:14,364 --> 00:11:17,636
I know. I am deeply sorry
for this whole mess.

225
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,717
Do you wanna come inside?

226
00:11:19,855 --> 00:11:22,562
I'm really not in the mood
for tea and biscuits.

227
00:11:22,593 --> 00:11:24,527
Ben and I are
getting married next week,

228
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:27,837
and "correctional facility"
isn't exactly my dream venue.

229
00:11:27,994 --> 00:11:29,602
I wish there was something
I could do.

230
00:11:29,651 --> 00:11:33,002
There is. Ben is sitting
in that jail cell right now,

231
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:35,942
and I don't even know why,
and he won't tell me.

232
00:11:35,985 --> 00:11:38,439
So you have to fix this.

233
00:11:38,945 --> 00:11:41,554
Just release him from
whatever promise he made you.

234
00:11:41,585 --> 00:11:43,739
Believe me, I wish I could
do that, but I can't.

235
00:11:43,764 --> 00:11:45,648
Why not?

236
00:11:46,988 --> 00:11:49,112
- (Sighs) I just can't...
- Bree...

237
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,865
Did you... kill that man?

238
00:11:51,903 --> 00:11:55,937
Of course not. How could you
even think that? (Sighs)

239
00:11:55,938 --> 00:11:58,974
I'll apologize when someone
starts telling me the truth.

240
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,384
(Sighs)

241
00:12:04,848 --> 00:12:06,903
Okay, let's get those lips
a little more glossy.

242
00:12:06,904 --> 00:12:09,117
All right, enough, enough.
I'm meeting with Tom,

243
00:12:09,118 --> 00:12:10,924
not prepping for a shift
at a bordello.

244
00:12:10,925 --> 00:12:13,911
Yeah, but you're finally getting
back together. You've gotta look perfect.

245
00:12:13,912 --> 00:12:14,949
(Both chuckle)

246
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,965
Oh! And we still have time
for that Brazilian bikini wax.

247
00:12:17,853 --> 00:12:19,837
If you mention that again,
I will strike you.

248
00:12:19,859 --> 00:12:21,184
(Car door slams)

249
00:12:21,872 --> 00:12:23,921
What the hell?

250
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,949
(Gasps, whispers) It's Tom!

251
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:30,952
- You said 8:00!
- <i>He</i> said 8:00!

252
00:12:30,953 --> 00:12:32,917
I need to be alone with him.
You have to hide!

253
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,949
- Hide?!
- Yes!

254
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:36,445
What if you guys start
doing it right here?

255
00:12:36,446 --> 00:12:37,974
I can't listen to that!
Well, maybe I could.

256
00:12:37,975 --> 00:12:39,942
Hide! Hide! Put your fingers
in your ears! Go on!

257
00:12:39,943 --> 00:12:41,929
Oh!

258
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:44,966
Hey. (Giggles)
You're early.

259
00:12:44,967 --> 00:12:47,983
- Yeah. Sorry.
- You... you going somewhere?

260
00:12:47,984 --> 00:12:51,949
No. No, I was just...
No.

261
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:54,949
It's fine, Lynette.
I understand. Y-you...

262
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:58,941
- You got a life.
- (Chuckles) (Laughs) No. No, I <i>really </i>don't.

263
00:12:58,942 --> 00:13:00,929
Come on in. You want a drink
or something?

264
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:02,929
No, thanks.
I'll just be a minute.

265
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:04,904
Come in.

266
00:13:05,975 --> 00:13:06,996
Tom?

267
00:13:09,983 --> 00:13:12,950
I'm filing the divorce papers
tomorrow.

268
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:18,970
You're... what?

269
00:13:18,971 --> 00:13:21,907
We just gotta get out
of this gray area

270
00:13:21,908 --> 00:13:23,916
that we've been stuck in.

271
00:13:23,917 --> 00:13:25,982
It's... time

272
00:13:25,983 --> 00:13:28,975
for both of us
to move to the next phase.

273
00:13:31,954 --> 00:13:34,917
I just wanted
to tell you in person.

274
00:13:37,933 --> 00:13:40,946
That's all
I really have to say.

275
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:52,953
Aren't you going after him?

276
00:13:52,954 --> 00:13:53,982
Why not?

277
00:13:53,983 --> 00:13:56,983
Because now I know.

278
00:13:57,996 --> 00:14:01,961
Jane wasn't the problem.
It's me.

279
00:14:01,962 --> 00:14:03,992
(Whispers) He doesn't want
to be married to me.

280
00:14:13,967 --> 00:14:15,946
(Door opens)

281
00:14:17,967 --> 00:14:19,953
(Door closes)

282
00:14:19,954 --> 00:14:24,937
I guess we can both agree...

283
00:14:24,938 --> 00:14:26,904
Orange is not my color.

284
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:29,937
Look... (Sighs)

285
00:14:29,938 --> 00:14:33,689
I'm sorry I missed
the cake tasting, sweetheart.

286
00:14:33,764 --> 00:14:35,903
Uh... I mean, did you maybe
bring one of them with you?

287
00:14:35,904 --> 00:14:37,924
Mm, preferably
with a file in it.

288
00:14:37,925 --> 00:14:40,814
Really? You're making jokes?

289
00:14:40,851 --> 00:14:42,973
Hang in there, darling.
The trial can't last forever.

290
00:14:42,974 --> 00:14:45,745
They gotta let me
out of here some time.

291
00:14:45,783 --> 00:14:48,874
Or you could answer
their questions and get out now.

292
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:51,609
Yeah.
That's not how I'm built.

293
00:14:51,684 --> 00:14:53,899
Ben, you have no idea
how long this could go on.

294
00:14:54,743 --> 00:14:56,780
Am I gonna need
to cancel our wedding?

295
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,780
No! They got no motive,
no weapon.

296
00:14:59,837 --> 00:15:01,718
And Bree's alibi is solid.
She was with all of you

297
00:15:01,743 --> 00:15:04,733
at that...
that progressive dinner party.

298
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:07,907
Wait. That was the night
of the murder?

299
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:09,809
Yeah. Why?

300
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,699
- Oh, my God.
- Renee, what is it?

301
00:15:14,737 --> 00:15:16,937
(Sighs) Um...

302
00:15:16,938 --> 00:15:20,945
I remember something
about that night.

303
00:15:21,789 --> 00:15:25,494
I was looking out my
window, and it was late.

304
00:15:27,233 --> 00:15:29,892
And I saw Bree
getting out of her car.

305
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:38,814
Enjoy your visit,
Ms. Perry?

306
00:15:39,951 --> 00:15:42,426
- I'm sorry. Do I know you?
- Emily Stone.

307
00:15:42,451 --> 00:15:45,001
I'm the prosecutor
in Bree Van De Kamp's case.

308
00:15:45,063 --> 00:15:48,955
- I don't have anything to say to you.
- Oh, I think you do.

309
00:15:49,042 --> 00:15:51,667
You have something to say
about the night of the murder.

310
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,707
Back there, when you were
talking to your fiancé,

311
00:15:57,327 --> 00:16:00,367
- ...we heard every word.
- You can't do that.

312
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,941
There's no expectation
of privacy in jail.

313
00:16:02,942 --> 00:16:04,899
So... let's talk.

314
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,633
I'm not gonna help you try
to convict my friend.

315
00:16:07,677 --> 00:16:10,681
That's a shame,
because if you don't,

316
00:16:10,731 --> 00:16:12,304
I call Immigration,

317
00:16:12,329 --> 00:16:15,136
and Mr. Faulkner's on
a one-way flight back to Sydney.

318
00:16:16,477 --> 00:16:18,447
Ready to talk now?

319
00:16:26,466 --> 00:16:29,293
Mr. Faulkner, how are you today?

320
00:16:29,786 --> 00:16:32,156
Oh, good.
Yeah, refreshed.

321
00:16:32,287 --> 00:16:35,432
I asked you yesterday
if you were willing to discuss

322
00:16:35,482 --> 00:16:38,221
your telephone conversation
with the defendant.

323
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:41,622
I remember.
Still won't answer.

324
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:46,056
Uh, can we just save everyone some
time and send me back to jail?

325
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:49,089
Bailiff, remove Mr. Faulkner.

326
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:52,166
We'll see you back here
tomorrow.

327
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:56,117
Your Honor, the prosecution
calls Renee Perry to the stand.

328
00:17:00,702 --> 00:17:01,952
Renee?

329
00:17:04,804 --> 00:17:06,821
Renee, what are you doing?

330
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,828
(Speaks indistinctly)

331
00:17:09,842 --> 00:17:11,228
Renee!

332
00:17:14,806 --> 00:17:17,406
I was lying in bed

333
00:17:17,485 --> 00:17:19,843
when a noise from the street
woke me up.

334
00:17:20,167 --> 00:17:24,132
It was about...
(Sighs) 3:00 A.M.

335
00:17:24,133 --> 00:17:28,835
So I got up and I went
to the window.

336
00:17:28,891 --> 00:17:30,623
And what did you see?

337
00:17:30,647 --> 00:17:32,696
I saw Bree.

338
00:17:33,154 --> 00:17:36,157
Her clothes were
kinda muddy, um...

339
00:17:36,158 --> 00:17:38,111
Leaves in her hair.

340
00:17:38,112 --> 00:17:40,439
(Sighs) She was...

341
00:17:40,545 --> 00:17:42,196
Walking up her driveway.

342
00:17:42,197 --> 00:17:45,100
Was she carrying anything?

343
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:47,345
(Sighs) Yes.

344
00:17:47,372 --> 00:17:48,625
What was she carrying?

345
00:17:56,649 --> 00:17:57,937
A shovel.

346
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:04,650
No further questions.

347
00:18:09,112 --> 00:18:11,195
Renee, what did you just do?

348
00:18:11,196 --> 00:18:14,107
I did what I had to do.
I told the truth.

349
00:18:14,108 --> 00:18:16,149
What you said in there
could really hurt Bree.

350
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,761
Do you not understand
what's at stake here?

351
00:18:17,773 --> 00:18:19,973
Friends aren't supposed
to turn on each other.

352
00:18:19,992 --> 00:18:22,146
Oh, so I'm one of
the "friends" now?

353
00:18:22,147 --> 00:18:24,059
What is that
supposed to mean?

354
00:18:24,071 --> 00:18:27,107
All year long, you've been
keeping a secret from me.

355
00:18:27,108 --> 00:18:28,895
Hey, just so we're clear,

356
00:18:28,945 --> 00:18:31,608
I didn't want
to testify against Bree.

357
00:18:31,723 --> 00:18:34,747
The D.A. was gonna
have Ben deported.

358
00:18:35,856 --> 00:18:39,431
Oh, so, yeah, I picked
the man I love over you.

359
00:18:39,706 --> 00:18:42,187
And judging by the way
you guys have treated me,

360
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:44,138
I made the right choice.

361
00:18:48,108 --> 00:18:50,582
Trip. Trip!

362
00:18:50,619 --> 00:18:53,100
That was bad?

363
00:18:54,192 --> 00:18:56,137
Not out here.

364
00:18:56,138 --> 00:18:59,192
(Door opens)
I need the room.

365
00:18:59,193 --> 00:19:01,196
- Uh, but the judge asked me to...
- Get out.

366
00:19:01,199 --> 00:19:02,572
Okay.

367
00:19:08,616 --> 00:19:11,338
- Did you see their faces?
- Whose faces?

368
00:19:11,364 --> 00:19:13,354
The jurors.

369
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:15,795
I've been watching them.

370
00:19:17,171 --> 00:19:19,107
After Renee's little story,

371
00:19:19,108 --> 00:19:23,178
no one on that jury is buying
what you're selling.

372
00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:26,141
What about you?

373
00:19:26,142 --> 00:19:30,099
I don't know, Bree.

374
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:33,107
You haven't told me the truth yet.
Twice I've been blindsided

375
00:19:33,108 --> 00:19:35,107
because I don't know
what the hell is going on.

376
00:19:35,108 --> 00:19:38,141
You need to tell me
what happened that night.

377
00:19:38,142 --> 00:19:41,112
(Whispers) I made a promise
to my friends.

378
00:19:43,175 --> 00:19:45,178
You're gonna lose.

379
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:48,137
Do you understand that?
You are going to go to prison.

380
00:19:48,138 --> 00:19:52,178
- You're scaring me.
- Good. You should be scared.

381
00:19:52,179 --> 00:19:57,111
You're throwing your life away,
and it... and it pisses me off,

382
00:19:57,112 --> 00:20:00,192
- ...'cause this affects more than just you.
- I don't understand.

383
00:20:00,193 --> 00:20:03,137
Look, I-I-I'm saying
that you were wrong before.

384
00:20:03,138 --> 00:20:06,128
You're not just my client,
and I'm not just your lawyer.

385
00:20:06,129 --> 00:20:09,132
I'm also somebody who...

386
00:20:09,133 --> 00:20:11,128
Really...

387
00:20:11,129 --> 00:20:13,112
- Oh, to hell with it.
- (Gasps)

388
00:20:13,115 --> 00:20:14,408
Mmm.

389
00:20:17,146 --> 00:20:19,150
It was Carlos.

390
00:20:21,104 --> 00:20:22,325
Mmm.

391
00:20:23,154 --> 00:20:25,116
(Gasps)

392
00:20:25,117 --> 00:20:27,133
You have to promise me
not to use this against him...

393
00:20:27,134 --> 00:20:29,129
(Whispers) Or anyone else.

394
00:20:34,117 --> 00:20:35,375
Tell me everything.

395
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,120
(Sighs)

396
00:20:40,121 --> 00:20:42,124
It was self-defense.

397
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,141
Alejandro
broke into her house,

398
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:47,124
and when Gaby came home,
he attacked her.

399
00:20:52,701 --> 00:20:54,655
This gem
just came on the market,

400
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:58,153
and as you can see,
it's a warm, cozy, homey place.

401
00:20:58,154 --> 00:21:01,116
(Lowered voice) And don't worry,
they're taking the furniture.

402
00:21:01,117 --> 00:21:05,161
- I just love your kitchen.
- Oh, thank you.

403
00:21:05,162 --> 00:21:08,120
I can't tell you how many
mornings I've sat here,

404
00:21:08,121 --> 00:21:10,142
looking out on the Lane,
having a cup of... Gaby.

405
00:21:11,158 --> 00:21:14,146
- Gaby? - Gaby... who I haven't told
I'm moving yet. (lnhales sharply)

406
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:17,103
Okay, Mr. and Mrs. Newman,
let me show you the upstairs.

407
00:21:17,104 --> 00:21:20,138
- Uh, we're not done looking down here.
- Oh, but the upstairs is way better!

408
00:21:20,139 --> 00:21:22,138
It's... that much closer
to heaven.

409
00:21:22,139 --> 00:21:24,116
Come on, go, go!

410
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:26,196
- Hey.
- (Door closes) Hi! How's it going?

411
00:21:26,199 --> 00:21:28,070
Great. It's my turn
to take care

412
00:21:28,071 --> 00:21:30,169
of Mrs. McCluskey, so obviously,
I've been drinking.

413
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:32,121
- Can you take me to the courthouse?
- Sure.

414
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,112
- (Thud overhead)
- Someone upstairs?

415
00:21:34,115 --> 00:21:36,179
- Nope.
- (Mrs. Newman) Look at this closet space!

416
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:38,862
Just some old friends
from high school.

417
00:21:38,871 --> 00:21:41,436
(Mr. Newman)
Are these low-flow toilets?

418
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:44,116
Who are very eco-friendly.
So I should get back to them.

419
00:21:44,117 --> 00:21:45,774
I'll pick you up at noon.

420
00:21:46,695 --> 00:21:49,120
Hey, great place
you have here.

421
00:21:49,121 --> 00:21:53,124
Um... Gaby, uh,
these are my good friends

422
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,494
Fred and Jean.

423
00:21:57,129 --> 00:21:59,132
Hello. (Chuckles)

424
00:21:59,133 --> 00:22:01,104
(Clenched teeth)
What year did you graduate?

425
00:22:02,121 --> 00:22:03,141
(Chuckles)

426
00:22:04,797 --> 00:22:07,124
Mr. Weston,
if the defense rests,

427
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,183
we can move on
to closing arguments.

428
00:22:15,231 --> 00:22:17,137
Actually,
I have another witness.

429
00:22:17,138 --> 00:22:19,116
A new witness at this point?

430
00:22:19,117 --> 00:22:20,479
She's not new.

431
00:22:21,335 --> 00:22:23,191
The defense recalls...

432
00:22:23,192 --> 00:22:25,116
Gabrielle Solis.

433
00:22:25,117 --> 00:22:28,174
(Gallery murmuring)

434
00:22:28,175 --> 00:22:31,510
- (Whispers) You promised.
- I also promised to keep you out of jail.

435
00:22:33,158 --> 00:22:36,851
- (Lowered voice) What is he doing?
- I-I don't know.

436
00:22:44,142 --> 00:22:47,133
You understand that you are
still under oath?

437
00:22:48,146 --> 00:22:50,191
Ms. Solis,

438
00:22:50,192 --> 00:22:55,154
I'd like to show you
a picture of the victim.

439
00:22:57,121 --> 00:23:00,121
Do you recognize this man
as Ramon Sanchez?

440
00:23:06,192 --> 00:23:09,145
No.

441
00:23:09,146 --> 00:23:12,120
Your honor, I want a recess.

442
00:23:12,121 --> 00:23:15,128
Only your lawyer can ask
for a recess, Ms. Van De Kamp.

443
00:23:15,129 --> 00:23:16,836
Please sit down.

444
00:23:24,121 --> 00:23:26,117
Do you know this man
by another name?

445
00:23:31,689 --> 00:23:33,561
His name is Alejandro Perez.

446
00:23:36,002 --> 00:23:38,031
And how do you know
Mr. Perez?

447
00:23:46,167 --> 00:23:48,620
He was...

448
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:51,450
He was my stepfather.

449
00:23:51,475 --> 00:23:53,588
- (Gallery murmuring)
- Your Honor,

450
00:23:53,613 --> 00:23:56,103
I insist on another recess,
please.

451
00:23:56,104 --> 00:23:59,132
I'm... feeling a little...

452
00:23:59,133 --> 00:24:00,174
(Thud)

453
00:24:00,175 --> 00:24:02,129
(Gallery gasps)
Bree!

454
00:24:02,132 --> 00:24:05,110
- (Gavel banging)
- (Judge Conti) Order! Order!

455
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,142
We're in recess until tomorrow,
at which time we will see

456
00:24:08,143 --> 00:24:12,195
if Ms. Van De Kamp
is able to continue.

457
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:14,990
(Whispers) Bree?

458
00:24:15,014 --> 00:24:17,142
(Whispers) Don't touch me.

459
00:24:30,414 --> 00:24:32,812
(Whispering) Jeez! You scared
the crap out of me!

460
00:24:32,862 --> 00:24:35,137
They know it's Alejandro,
and you don't tell me?

461
00:24:35,138 --> 00:24:36,142
Shh!

462
00:24:37,162 --> 00:24:39,149
She just fell asleep.

463
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:41,137
Okay, this has
gone far enough.

464
00:24:41,138 --> 00:24:44,099
First thing tomorrow,
I am telling the D.A. the truth.

465
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,173
No, you're not!
You're not doing anything.

466
00:24:46,385 --> 00:24:49,170
- You got a better idea?
- Yes!

467
00:24:49,708 --> 00:24:51,694
I'm gonna
tell them it was me.

468
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:53,405
Are you out of your mind?!

469
00:24:53,423 --> 00:24:55,128
No! Look, listen to me.

470
00:24:55,129 --> 00:24:58,452
I am a victim of abuse.
The jury's gonna side with me.

471
00:24:58,483 --> 00:25:02,103
Who they're not gonna side with
is <i>you, </i>a 2-time felon.

472
00:25:02,104 --> 00:25:04,146
- Gaby, you're crazy.
- No, I'm not.

473
00:25:05,016 --> 00:25:08,157
Since the first moment we met,
you've protected me.

474
00:25:08,158 --> 00:25:10,117
And I've been happy
to let you do it

475
00:25:10,118 --> 00:25:13,170
because I've been
this selfish, spoiled brat.

476
00:25:13,171 --> 00:25:16,120
Well, I don't want to be
that person anymore.

477
00:25:16,121 --> 00:25:18,166
I'm tired
of taking from you.

478
00:25:18,167 --> 00:25:21,145
So, please, this time,
just let me protect you.

479
00:25:21,146 --> 00:25:25,157
You really think
that a jury is gonna believe

480
00:25:25,158 --> 00:25:29,120
that you dragged a dead body
through the woods yourself?

481
00:25:29,121 --> 00:25:30,131
Adrenaline. Fear.

482
00:25:30,132 --> 00:25:32,102
You'd be surprised
what people can do.

483
00:25:32,103 --> 00:25:34,127
I don't think that story's
gonna be enough, Gaby.

484
00:25:34,128 --> 00:25:36,188
Well, I'll tell them exactly
what happened that night.

485
00:25:36,189 --> 00:25:39,145
He came over,
he started attacking me,

486
00:25:39,146 --> 00:25:41,167
and instead of saying you
killed him with a candlestick,

487
00:25:42,311 --> 00:25:44,129
I'll say it was me.

488
00:25:51,142 --> 00:25:53,112
(Crickets chirping)

489
00:25:59,737 --> 00:26:01,791
Honey, it's 2:00 in the morning.
Are you okay?

490
00:26:04,043 --> 00:26:07,107
I was just thinking
how proud I am of you.

491
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,229
Really?

492
00:26:12,444 --> 00:26:16,740
You were just saying... (Sighs)
How much you wanna change, but...

493
00:26:17,563 --> 00:26:19,547
You already have.

494
00:26:21,274 --> 00:26:25,116
Five years ago, you never would
have offered to sacrifice yourself for me.

495
00:26:26,904 --> 00:26:28,479
Thank you.

496
00:26:31,196 --> 00:26:33,128
(Sighs deeply)

497
00:26:33,129 --> 00:26:36,535
But there is no way I'm letting
you take the fall for this.

498
00:26:37,078 --> 00:26:38,492
What?

499
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,100
But you just said you were proud
of how much I've changed.

500
00:26:41,134 --> 00:26:44,568
Exactly. You've become this amazing
role model for our daughters.

501
00:26:44,587 --> 00:26:46,451
They need you now
more than ever.

502
00:26:46,501 --> 00:26:47,989
Wait.
But they need you, too.

503
00:26:48,026 --> 00:26:52,232
No, they need a father who accepts
responsibility for his actions.

504
00:26:52,588 --> 00:26:56,153
It has taken me a year, but I'm
finally going to be that guy.

505
00:26:56,154 --> 00:27:00,120
Now I am going down to the court
first thing in the morning

506
00:27:00,121 --> 00:27:01,711
and confess everything.

507
00:27:01,798 --> 00:27:03,622
Carlos! Wait a minute!

508
00:27:03,653 --> 00:27:08,959
I love you very much, Gabrielle, but there
is nothing that you can do to stop me.

509
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:13,154
(Scoffs)

510
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,739
Why would I put you
on the stand?

511
00:27:24,777 --> 00:27:27,120
I was at
that progressive dinner party.

512
00:27:27,121 --> 00:27:29,187
I can testify that Renee was
so stinking drunk

513
00:27:29,188 --> 00:27:33,174
she couldn't tell her ass
from her elbow.

514
00:27:33,175 --> 00:27:34,989
Okay.

515
00:27:35,626 --> 00:27:37,104
That could be helpful.

516
00:27:38,074 --> 00:27:40,124
I think I can, uh...

517
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:42,099
Fit you in next Monday.

518
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,770
(Chuckles) Look at me.

519
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:47,107
I'm wearing a wig
and toting an oxygen tank.

520
00:27:47,108 --> 00:27:49,133
Do I look like I'm gonna
make it to Monday?

521
00:27:51,167 --> 00:27:53,174
Put me on the stand.

522
00:27:53,175 --> 00:27:55,158
You'll be glad you did.

523
00:27:57,196 --> 00:28:01,099
Gaby's running late.

524
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,146
What the hell?
Why don't you take a seat?

525
00:28:07,138 --> 00:28:10,138
(Indistinct conversations)

526
00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:14,178
Listen, if they take me
into custody right away,

527
00:28:14,179 --> 00:28:16,169
I won't get a chance
to talk to the girls.

528
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:17,532
Let's not talk
about that right now.

529
00:28:17,544 --> 00:28:19,142
I don't want them seeing this
on the news.

530
00:28:19,143 --> 00:28:20,590
- (Sighs)
- You need to tell them that I love them

531
00:28:20,621 --> 00:28:22,107
and that
you're in charge now.

532
00:28:22,108 --> 00:28:23,847
Honey, I've always been
in charge.

533
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,651
I don't know why you made me
wear this thing. (Sighs)

534
00:28:26,683 --> 00:28:29,103
No, it's, uh, it's freezing
in the courtroom.

535
00:28:29,104 --> 00:28:31,111
You'll thank me later.

536
00:28:31,112 --> 00:28:33,120
(Sighs)

537
00:28:33,786 --> 00:28:35,780
So handsome.

538
00:28:35,861 --> 00:28:37,150
I'm gonna miss this face.

539
00:28:37,151 --> 00:28:39,179
(Whispers) I love you.

540
00:28:43,167 --> 00:28:45,149
Ladies first.

541
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:47,554
G-Gaby? A little rude.

542
00:28:47,941 --> 00:28:49,911
You snooze, you lose.

543
00:28:50,175 --> 00:28:52,040
Gaby, wait!

544
00:28:53,112 --> 00:28:55,154
(Alarm beeps) Hold on.

545
00:29:00,133 --> 00:29:03,120
(Electronic whirring and
beeping) That's weird.

546
00:29:03,121 --> 00:29:05,100
Remove your coat, please.
(Wand clatters)

547
00:29:06,907 --> 00:29:08,213
Okay.

548
00:29:12,154 --> 00:29:14,104
(Rip)

549
00:29:14,827 --> 00:29:16,187
Sir...

550
00:29:16,188 --> 00:29:19,108
- (Click)
- Sir, you wanna explain this?

551
00:29:21,146 --> 00:29:24,170
I swear, I have no idea
how that...

552
00:29:24,171 --> 00:29:26,107
Bye, Carlos.

553
00:29:26,108 --> 00:29:28,124
Gaby, get back here!

554
00:29:28,125 --> 00:29:30,111
We need backup!

555
00:29:30,112 --> 00:29:32,462
- <i>Gaby!</i>
- Love you!

556
00:29:34,245 --> 00:29:38,175
And, Mrs. McCluskey, you are a resident
of Wisteria Lane. Is that correct?

557
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:41,103
I've lived in that neighborhood
for 35 years.

558
00:29:41,104 --> 00:29:44,150
Wow. That's a long time.
Now Renee Perry has testified...

559
00:29:44,151 --> 00:29:46,846
Let me tell you something
about a neighborhood.

560
00:29:46,958 --> 00:29:48,195
Okay.

561
00:29:48,196 --> 00:29:50,986
It's not just a bunch of houses
in the same place.

562
00:29:52,142 --> 00:29:54,149
It's a community.

563
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:57,120
It's lives
that are connected,

564
00:29:57,121 --> 00:30:00,103
people who care
about each other.

565
00:30:00,104 --> 00:30:02,137
That's beautiful.
Now back to Ms. Perry...

566
00:30:02,138 --> 00:30:06,158
I know it sounds sappy,
but damn it, it's true.

567
00:30:08,138 --> 00:30:11,167
And these wonderful people
I'd lived beside...

568
00:30:13,104 --> 00:30:16,170
Well, they're my family.

569
00:30:16,171 --> 00:30:20,116
Your honor, I'm... I'm not sure
what we're getting from this.

570
00:30:20,117 --> 00:30:22,108
Well, you will in a minute,
honey.

571
00:30:22,109 --> 00:30:26,103
When you're in a family,
like me and the girls,

572
00:30:26,104 --> 00:30:29,107
you protect each other.

573
00:30:29,108 --> 00:30:31,116
That's just the way
it has to be.

574
00:30:31,117 --> 00:30:34,182
So when, uh,
Gaby's stepfather came back...

575
00:30:34,183 --> 00:30:35,671
(Trip) Uh...

576
00:30:35,689 --> 00:30:38,100
After everything
he'd done to her...

577
00:30:38,101 --> 00:30:40,153
W-w-what do you mean?

578
00:30:40,154 --> 00:30:41,195
(Scoffs)

579
00:30:41,196 --> 00:30:44,141
It's no secret he abused her
when she was a kid.

580
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:46,162
- Objection.
- Overruled.

581
00:30:46,165 --> 00:30:49,120
So that night,

582
00:30:49,121 --> 00:30:51,821
when I saw him
creeping around the house,

583
00:30:53,138 --> 00:30:56,153
I followed him in,
I picked up the candlestick,

584
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:58,191
and I killed
that son of a bitch.

585
00:30:58,192 --> 00:31:00,145
(Gallery gasping and murmuring)

586
00:31:00,146 --> 00:31:04,129
- (Gavel banging)
- (Judge Conti) Order!

587
00:31:04,132 --> 00:31:07,138
- (Murmuring continues)
- Order!

588
00:31:07,139 --> 00:31:10,570
Order in this courtroom!
Quiet down,

589
00:31:10,571 --> 00:31:13,445
or I will clear
the courtroom!

590
00:31:15,171 --> 00:31:17,167
Stop the trial!
I have something to say.

591
00:31:17,168 --> 00:31:19,182
(Whispers)
McCluskey just confessed.

592
00:31:19,183 --> 00:31:22,103
Mine can wait.

593
00:31:22,104 --> 00:31:24,137
(Scoffs) Your honor,
this is preposterous.

594
00:31:24,138 --> 00:31:27,149
There's no way that frail woman
could've committed this crime.

595
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:29,117
Adrenaline.

596
00:31:29,173 --> 00:31:31,195
Fear.

597
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:34,100
You'd be surprised
what people can do.

598
00:31:39,146 --> 00:31:41,103
Counselors...

599
00:31:41,104 --> 00:31:43,183
- My chamber <i>now.</i>
- (Bangs gavel)

600
00:31:43,186 --> 00:31:46,183
(Murmuring resumes)

601
00:31:48,183 --> 00:31:52,103
What the hell was that?

602
00:31:52,104 --> 00:31:54,103
Your honor, I had no idea.

603
00:31:54,104 --> 00:31:56,112
- (Scoffs)
- She begged me to put her on the stand.

604
00:31:56,115 --> 00:31:58,814
I thought she was gonna
discredit Renee Perry.

605
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:00,467
Obviously, she needed to
get this off her conscience.

606
00:32:00,524 --> 00:32:02,161
Oh, you are such a liar!

607
00:32:02,162 --> 00:32:04,931
This is a stunt, a last-ditch
effort to save his client...

608
00:32:04,968 --> 00:32:07,174
- (Chuckles) And I want him sanctioned.
- Enough.

609
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:11,099
Mr. Weston, where do you plan
on going with this?

610
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:14,140
Well, now that the issue of
sexual abuse has been introduced,

611
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:16,102
I'll need to bring Ms. Solis
back on the stand.

612
00:32:16,103 --> 00:32:18,162
Of course, she'll talk about what
a monster her stepfather was,

613
00:32:18,163 --> 00:32:21,827
and as I recall,
most of our jurors are parents.

614
00:32:21,933 --> 00:32:24,137
After I've taken them
through the sordid details

615
00:32:24,138 --> 00:32:26,145
of what your victim did...

616
00:32:26,146 --> 00:32:28,821
You can't possibly allow this.

617
00:32:28,852 --> 00:32:32,104
Given the testimony
of the last witness, I have to.

618
00:32:35,336 --> 00:32:38,138
Okay, Ms. Stone,
what do you want to do?

619
00:32:45,104 --> 00:32:47,103
Ms. Stone?

620
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:49,125
(Sighs)

621
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:01,167
Your honor, at this time,

622
00:33:01,168 --> 00:33:05,103
we move to dismiss all charges
against Bree Van De Kamp.

623
00:33:05,104 --> 00:33:07,161
(Applause, gallery murmuring)

624
00:33:07,162 --> 00:33:10,166
(Exhales deeply)
(Gavel bangs)

625
00:33:11,167 --> 00:33:14,157
Ms. Stone,
is there anyone else

626
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:18,167
that you would like to file
charges against at this time?

627
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:31,178
Given her advanced age
and declining health,

628
00:33:31,179 --> 00:33:35,099
the people have decided not to press
charges against Karen McCluskey.

629
00:33:35,197 --> 00:33:38,107
(Judge Conti)
All right, in that case,

630
00:33:38,108 --> 00:33:41,141
Ms. Van De Kamp, Mrs. McCluskey,
you are both free to go.

631
00:33:41,142 --> 00:33:43,175
- Case dismissed.
- Aah! (Laughs)

632
00:33:43,178 --> 00:33:47,178
(Applause)

633
00:33:47,179 --> 00:33:49,174
Congratulations.

634
00:33:49,175 --> 00:33:51,196
Thank you.

635
00:33:54,158 --> 00:33:56,188
(Lynette) Hey! Oh!

636
00:33:58,167 --> 00:34:00,162
- Oh, God! Oh, God.
- Oh, thank you.

637
00:34:07,167 --> 00:34:09,157
(Crickets chirping)

638
00:34:10,164 --> 00:34:11,971
Roy?

639
00:34:12,708 --> 00:34:16,793
Why aren't you
at Bree's big victory party?

640
00:34:17,317 --> 00:34:19,112
Uh, thought I'd
sit this one out. (Chuckles)

641
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:24,116
Filed divorce papers today,
so I'm not really, uh,

642
00:34:24,117 --> 00:34:26,116
up to bumping into Lynette.

643
00:34:26,117 --> 00:34:28,149
Anyway, I, uh...

644
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:30,150
I wanted to come over
and see how Karen's doing.

645
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:35,120
Incredible thing
she did today.

646
00:34:35,121 --> 00:34:38,107
Yeah, I'm proud as hell.

647
00:34:38,108 --> 00:34:39,865
But it took
a lot out of her.

648
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:43,103
I brought her home, put her
right in bed. (Chuckles)

649
00:34:43,104 --> 00:34:46,149
Still, she is
one tough broad.

650
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,117
Ah.

651
00:34:48,118 --> 00:34:49,807
What you got there?

652
00:34:49,926 --> 00:34:52,099
Karen's pot roast recipe.

653
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,187
(Chuckles)

654
00:34:53,188 --> 00:34:55,170
Best one I ever tasted.

655
00:34:55,171 --> 00:34:58,157
She swore I'd never
get it out of her.

656
00:34:58,158 --> 00:35:00,153
So how'd you convince her?

657
00:35:00,154 --> 00:35:02,157
(Sighs) I...

658
00:35:02,158 --> 00:35:05,157
Told her
we have this gift.

659
00:35:05,158 --> 00:35:09,132
We know these are
our last days together.

660
00:35:09,133 --> 00:35:11,621
So what's the point
of holding back?

661
00:35:13,243 --> 00:35:17,705
I didn't want anything
to be left unsaid.

662
00:35:17,862 --> 00:35:20,174
So... (Sighs)

663
00:35:20,808 --> 00:35:24,117
We finally had <i>that </i>talk.

664
00:35:26,146 --> 00:35:28,157
Yes, sir.

665
00:35:28,158 --> 00:35:31,107
She told me... (Chuckles)

666
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,549
She was the one

667
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:36,124
that lost our passports
on the way to Mexico that time.

668
00:35:36,125 --> 00:35:37,166
(Chuckles)

669
00:35:37,167 --> 00:35:40,149
I told her the truth
about my time in the service,

670
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:46,116
how I wasn't some tough guy
but scared to death.

671
00:35:46,117 --> 00:35:50,121
She thanked me for always
being able to make her laugh.

672
00:35:52,121 --> 00:35:53,579
And I...

673
00:35:53,623 --> 00:35:56,852
(Voice breaks) I told her...

674
00:35:57,918 --> 00:36:00,196
(Sniffles) She was
the love of my life.

675
00:36:06,154 --> 00:36:08,178
Tom...

676
00:36:08,179 --> 00:36:12,195
It's so important
to say these things

677
00:36:12,196 --> 00:36:16,107
when you can,

678
00:36:16,108 --> 00:36:21,125
because when it's over,
it's over.

679
00:36:22,167 --> 00:36:23,182
I hear ya.

680
00:36:23,183 --> 00:36:26,146
Do you?

681
00:36:35,162 --> 00:36:36,182
(Pops)

682
00:36:36,183 --> 00:36:39,120
(Women scream and laugh)

683
00:36:39,121 --> 00:36:40,158
Yay.

684
00:36:41,196 --> 00:36:44,153
(Sighs)

685
00:36:44,154 --> 00:36:48,154
- Somebody make a toast.
- Uh... oh, to Bree,

686
00:36:48,198 --> 00:36:52,132
Um, who put her life on the line
to protect us,

687
00:36:52,133 --> 00:36:54,125
and we will never forget
what you did.

688
00:36:54,126 --> 00:36:55,345
- (Gaby) Aw.
- Hear, hear.

689
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:57,005
And... to Karen McCluskey,

690
00:36:57,024 --> 00:36:59,967
the bravest woman
I have ever known.

691
00:36:59,992 --> 00:37:01,150
- Aw.
- (Chuckles)

692
00:37:01,151 --> 00:37:04,348
And to you ladies, who could've
abandoned me during my hour of need.

693
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:07,104
Okay, okay.
Less thanking, more drinking.

694
00:37:07,112 --> 00:37:08,111
(Clinking)

695
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:10,605
- (Lynette) Cheers.
- Hey!

696
00:37:10,649 --> 00:37:13,368
- Hi!
- Congratulations, Bree.

697
00:37:13,399 --> 00:37:16,624
I cannot tell you how relieved
I am that you weren't convicted.

698
00:37:16,712 --> 00:37:18,601
Oh, that is so sweet.

699
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,127
Seriously,
do you have any idea how

700
00:37:20,128 --> 00:37:22,133
living across from a murderer
can affect housing prices?

701
00:37:22,134 --> 00:37:23,153
(Chuckles)

702
00:37:23,154 --> 00:37:25,157
Ah. (Sighs)

703
00:37:25,158 --> 00:37:28,129
- Do you have a sec?
- What's up?

704
00:37:28,132 --> 00:37:30,121
(Mouths words)

705
00:37:33,117 --> 00:37:35,145
Have you told the girls
you're moving?

706
00:37:35,146 --> 00:37:37,132
Um, not yet.

707
00:37:37,133 --> 00:37:39,161
Well, I thought it'd be easier
after the trial,

708
00:37:39,162 --> 00:37:41,157
but now
everybody's so happy.

709
00:37:41,158 --> 00:37:45,390
- I just haven't found the right time.
- Well, you're gonna have to find one.

710
00:37:45,434 --> 00:37:47,112
I got an offer
on your house.

711
00:37:51,108 --> 00:37:52,659
Oh, hey,
you're out of ice.

712
00:37:52,694 --> 00:37:54,697
- Oh, do you have any at your house?
- Ye... (Door opens)

713
00:38:00,417 --> 00:38:02,921
- I think I've got a bag.
- I'll be right back.

714
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:07,268
- What are you doing here?
- (Door closes)

715
00:38:07,313 --> 00:38:08,894
You left so quickly, I-I didn't
get a chance to m...

716
00:38:08,925 --> 00:38:10,328
I'm sorry,

717
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:13,264
a private party
for my neighbors and friends.

718
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:15,874
You're mad. I-I get that.

719
00:38:15,911 --> 00:38:17,751
But...
Please let me explain.

720
00:38:17,789 --> 00:38:19,353
There's nothing to explain.

721
00:38:19,354 --> 00:38:21,333
You swore to me you wouldn't
put Gaby on the stand,

722
00:38:21,334 --> 00:38:23,770
and then you did.
You lied to me.

723
00:38:23,782 --> 00:38:26,341
To win this case...
For you.

724
00:38:26,342 --> 00:38:27,660
(Sighs)

725
00:38:27,716 --> 00:38:29,354
And... and... and also for me.

726
00:38:29,355 --> 00:38:33,378
Bree, there was no way I was
gonna let you go to jail.

727
00:38:33,379 --> 00:38:35,358
Plus there's
this thing between us and...

728
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:38,365
Oh, please. You're just pretending
there's something between us

729
00:38:38,366 --> 00:38:40,354
so you could get information
from me.

730
00:38:40,355 --> 00:38:42,370
I-I wasn't trying to get...

731
00:38:42,371 --> 00:38:43,824
(Bree sighs)

732
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,382
Bree... (Sighs)

733
00:38:46,383 --> 00:38:48,717
I probably shouldn't even
be here.

734
00:38:49,585 --> 00:38:51,213
I had to tell you...

735
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:53,307
(Whispers) I'm so sorry.

736
00:38:53,308 --> 00:38:55,357
(Sighs) Renee,

737
00:38:55,358 --> 00:38:57,317
<i>you </i>I can forgive.

738
00:38:59,308 --> 00:39:01,672
And, Ben, you're my hero.

739
00:39:03,367 --> 00:39:06,321
(Chuckles) Come on in.

740
00:39:08,514 --> 00:39:11,679
And <i>you </i>are not welcome
in my home.

741
00:39:29,388 --> 00:39:32,299
Can I talk to you?

742
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:35,341
(Sighs)

743
00:39:35,342 --> 00:39:38,023
They're kinda waiting for me at Bree's.
(Bag rustles)

744
00:39:38,111 --> 00:39:41,354
I'm in charge
of the ice, so...

745
00:39:43,015 --> 00:39:45,316
Lynette!

746
00:39:45,317 --> 00:39:47,308
Lynette, please.

747
00:39:49,379 --> 00:39:51,051
Look...

748
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,378
At the end, before I left,

749
00:39:54,379 --> 00:39:57,391
our problems looked

750
00:39:58,010 --> 00:39:59,603
this big...

751
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:04,320
So I went away.

752
00:40:04,731 --> 00:40:06,357
But now...

753
00:40:06,358 --> 00:40:09,349
I realized they...
they only seem that way

754
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:12,332
because we were
so close up against them,

755
00:40:12,333 --> 00:40:15,357
and... and... and they were
blocking me from seeing

756
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:20,366
how much I <i>love </i>you,

757
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,367
which is...

758
00:40:27,333 --> 00:40:28,358
(Drops hands)

759
00:40:31,371 --> 00:40:34,357
I see that now,

760
00:40:34,358 --> 00:40:37,370
and I need
to tell you that...

761
00:40:37,371 --> 00:40:40,349
Because you have to
say these things

762
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:42,371
while you still can.

763
00:40:43,961 --> 00:40:46,378
Tom, my...

764
00:40:46,379 --> 00:40:48,895
Ice is melting,

765
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,338
and I'm not exactly sure
what you're saying.

766
00:40:56,358 --> 00:40:58,332
I'm saying...

767
00:40:58,333 --> 00:41:00,755
(Voice breaks) That I know
you've moved on,

768
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:04,317
and I hope
that you'll be happy.

769
00:41:06,779 --> 00:41:08,800
Because you, Lynette...

770
00:41:11,354 --> 00:41:13,321
You will...

771
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:18,329
Always be
the love of my life.

772
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:25,451
That's all.

773
00:41:27,367 --> 00:41:29,370
What do you mean
I've moved on?

774
00:41:30,575 --> 00:41:32,307
Gregg told me
that you broke up with him

775
00:41:32,308 --> 00:41:34,361
because you're in love
with someone else, so...

776
00:41:34,693 --> 00:41:36,681
Yeah, I am.

777
00:41:41,361 --> 00:41:42,837
You.

778
00:41:47,559 --> 00:41:49,337
Me?

779
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:51,837
You.

780
00:41:58,258 --> 00:42:00,274
You.

781
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:04,445
You.

782
00:42:10,076 --> 00:42:12,114
You.

783
00:42:25,317 --> 00:42:26,358

<i>The woman who had lived
on the street for years</i>

787
00:42:49,804 --> 00:42:51,665

790
00:42:57,383 --> 00:42:59,407
Welcome to the neighborhood!

791
00:42:59,445 --> 00:43:02,390
- I'm Martha Huber.
- Mary Alice Young.

792
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:05,440
So... you got a husband?
Mine's dead.

793
00:43:05,979 --> 00:43:08,503
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Me, too... in theory.

794
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:11,015
Oh. (Chuckles)
I have a husband and a son.

795
00:43:11,016 --> 00:43:13,000
They're in the other van.
They'll be here soon.

796
00:43:13,001 --> 00:43:15,978
Ooh! I used to have a chair
just like that.

797
00:43:15,979 --> 00:43:17,954
Kept breaking,
so I threw it away.

798
00:43:17,955 --> 00:43:19,967
I hate cheap furniture.

799
00:43:20,961 --> 00:43:22,880
Yes, well, uh,

800
00:43:22,979 --> 00:43:25,974
I should go help the movers.
Nice to meet you.

801
00:43:25,975 --> 00:43:28,399
Wait! I hardly know
anything about you.

802
00:43:28,418 --> 00:43:30,951
You didn't even mention
where you folks are from.

803
00:43:32,012 --> 00:43:33,392
Up North.

804
00:43:33,438 --> 00:43:36,911
"Up North"? That doesn't tell me
anything. Where exactly?

805
00:43:36,996 --> 00:43:39,555
Small town.
You wouldn't know it.

806
00:43:39,579 --> 00:43:40,961
Try me.

807
00:43:42,697 --> 00:43:44,957
Why do you need
to know that?

808
00:43:44,958 --> 00:43:46,991
Why don't you wanna
tell me?

809
00:43:46,992 --> 00:43:49,559
Well, it's no big deal.
It's just...

810
00:43:50,958 --> 00:43:52,974
<i>And just like that,</i>

811
00:43:52,975 --> 00:43:56,428
<i>Martha Huber figured out
I was hiding something.</i>

Ohh, you're busy.

00:43:58,904 --> 00:44:02,891
We'll just have a long chat

Oh, my God.

Hello, ladies.

829
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,282
Did you miss me?

830
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:08,270
So three months
after we got to Paris,

831
00:45:08,301 --> 00:45:10,678
- Robin and I broke up.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

832
00:45:10,704 --> 00:45:13,637
Yeah, a long distance move
can be tough on a relationship.

833
00:45:13,638 --> 00:45:16,116
That, and I decided I just
wasn't into women anymore.

834
00:45:16,148 --> 00:45:18,461
Although in Paris, it's hard
to tell the difference.

835
00:45:18,505 --> 00:45:20,840
The women don't shave,
and the men carry purses.

836
00:45:20,858 --> 00:45:22,607
(All laugh)

837
00:45:22,608 --> 00:45:24,687
So... what team
are you playing for now?

838
00:45:24,688 --> 00:45:26,641
Ah, I'm out of the game.

839
00:45:26,642 --> 00:45:29,624
I decided to channel my sexual frustration
into starting my own business...

840
00:45:29,625 --> 00:45:31,937
a line
of frozen French pastries.

841
00:45:31,969 --> 00:45:34,637
Bree, you remember
how my <i>croissants</i>

842
00:45:34,693 --> 00:45:36,134
were always the best
on the Lane.

843
00:45:36,178 --> 00:45:37,637
I remember you thinking that.

844
00:45:37,638 --> 00:45:38,657
(Chuckles)

845
00:45:38,658 --> 00:45:42,771
So, basically, you sell microwavable
French food... to the French?

846
00:45:42,809 --> 00:45:46,466
Yep. As they got lazier and
fatter, I got thinner and richer,

847
00:45:46,547 --> 00:45:48,470
now my accountant
has me buying "chateaux"

848
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:50,520
just to do something
with all my money.

849
00:45:50,537 --> 00:45:51,637
(Laughs)

850
00:45:51,638 --> 00:45:53,246
(Laughs)

851
00:45:53,271 --> 00:45:57,671
So other than wanting to rub your success
in our faces, what brings you back?

852
00:45:58,265 --> 00:46:01,662
I have a little business proposition...
For Lynette.

853
00:46:06,242 --> 00:46:07,611
Tighter.

854
00:46:07,612 --> 00:46:10,019
(Scoffs) If I go any tighter,
you won't be able to breathe.

855
00:46:10,063 --> 00:46:12,599
Jean, you're talking to a woman
who gave herself salmonella

856
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,632
to lose 10 pounds
before prom.

857
00:46:14,633 --> 00:46:17,611
Beauty is suffering.
Now tighter!

858
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:20,302
Hey.
(Gasps)

859
00:46:20,889 --> 00:46:23,025
What are you doing here?

860
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:25,628
You can't see me before
the wedding. It's bad luck.

861
00:46:25,629 --> 00:46:29,428
Uh, so I, uh, picked up
the programs from the printer.

862
00:46:29,486 --> 00:46:31,474
(Gasps)

863
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,607
Oh, my God.

864
00:46:36,608 --> 00:46:39,520
Do I have to do everything?
This is ivory.

865
00:46:39,539 --> 00:46:42,173
I told you to get beige.
Are you color-blind?

866
00:46:42,208 --> 00:46:44,200
You do know I'm black, right?

867
00:46:45,871 --> 00:46:48,577
Honey, I-I can't help but notice,
uh, you seem a little...

868
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:50,781
- Bitchy?
- No, I was gonna say, uh...

869
00:46:50,819 --> 00:46:52,194
Less angelic than usual.

870
00:46:52,219 --> 00:46:55,590
I am busting my ass to plan
the happiest day of <i>your </i>life.

871
00:46:55,621 --> 00:46:58,241
So let's ditch the sarcasm,
shall we?

872
00:46:58,278 --> 00:47:00,719
You know what?
It is bad luck

873
00:47:00,756 --> 00:47:02,531
for the groom to see the bride
before the wedding,

874
00:47:02,565 --> 00:47:04,514
and I just realized why.

875
00:47:05,725 --> 00:47:06,979
(Door closes)

876
00:47:07,485 --> 00:47:10,632
Jean, I told you tighter.
I don't care if I can breathe.

877
00:47:10,633 --> 00:47:13,455
(Under breath) At this point,
neither do I.

878
00:47:16,812 --> 00:47:18,107
What was going on
out there?

879
00:47:18,108 --> 00:47:19,582
Katherine came back
for a visit.

880
00:47:19,601 --> 00:47:22,058
And before you get too excited,
no, she's not a lesbian anymore.

881
00:47:22,095 --> 00:47:24,470
Really? Damn.

882
00:47:24,514 --> 00:47:28,017
Hey, while you were out dishing with
your friends, our gardener quit.

883
00:47:28,054 --> 00:47:31,906
He wouldn't name names, but apparently
one of us is a little too hard to please.

884
00:47:31,907 --> 00:47:33,867
(Crunches) Yeah,
you should work on that.

885
00:47:33,868 --> 00:47:36,020
- So you gonna get a new one?
- When? (Crunches)

886
00:47:36,058 --> 00:47:37,513
I have a job, too, you know.

887
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,738
Carlos, you help the poor
and downtrodden...

888
00:47:39,763 --> 00:47:41,850
a group with
a very flexible schedule.

889
00:47:41,851 --> 00:47:43,879
(Cell phone rings)
I'm working crazy hours.

890
00:47:43,882 --> 00:47:45,840
House stuff is up to you now.
(Ring)

891
00:47:45,887 --> 00:47:47,841
Mm! It's my boss.
(Ring and beep)

892
00:47:48,464 --> 00:47:50,183
Hello, Mr. Hoffman.

893
00:47:51,505 --> 00:47:53,809
Really? Me?

894
00:47:54,707 --> 00:47:57,371
Y-yes, I'm very interested.

895
00:47:57,409 --> 00:47:58,899
Thank you.

896
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:00,737
I-I don't know
what to say.

897
00:48:01,623 --> 00:48:04,135
Okay,
I'll see you then, sir.

898
00:48:04,821 --> 00:48:06,883
(Beep) What was that about?

899
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:09,459
I just got
a huge promotion.

900
00:48:09,735 --> 00:48:11,742
I'm the new head
of v.I.P. Sales.

901
00:48:12,370 --> 00:48:13,670
Seriously?

902
00:48:13,701 --> 00:48:16,209
- Babe, that's amazing.
- Mm.

903
00:48:16,854 --> 00:48:19,875
- What's... wrong?
- I don't know.

904
00:48:19,901 --> 00:48:23,467
It's so big.
It's a whole department.

905
00:48:23,581 --> 00:48:26,309
They're really trusting me.
What if I can't do it?

906
00:48:26,349 --> 00:48:30,148
Gaby, don't you know
how smart and talented you are?

907
00:48:30,891 --> 00:48:32,198
You deserve this.

908
00:48:35,483 --> 00:48:36,537
(Sighs) Yeah.

909
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:38,471
You know what? You're right.
(Chuckles)

910
00:48:38,496 --> 00:48:40,176
I just gotta learn
how to be the boss. (Chuckles)

911
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,040
I don't even know
how to talk to employees.

912
00:48:42,049 --> 00:48:44,008
Yeah, I think our gardener
would agree.

913
00:48:44,009 --> 00:48:47,079
Oh, please. (Chuckles)
That sad sack was a moron.

914
00:48:49,021 --> 00:48:50,121
So how you been feeling?

915
00:48:50,122 --> 00:48:53,003
I've been craving chocolate
constantly.

916
00:48:53,004 --> 00:48:55,078
But that's okay, right?

917
00:48:55,079 --> 00:48:57,095
Within moderation,
but I'm not worried.

918
00:48:57,096 --> 00:48:59,041
You look great.

919
00:48:59,042 --> 00:49:01,111
Mm, thank you.

920
00:49:01,947 --> 00:49:04,493
You know,
Julie is getting her PhD,

921
00:49:04,525 --> 00:49:07,020
so soon she'll be a doctor, too.

922
00:49:07,021 --> 00:49:11,049
Maybe you two should have lunch
sometime and talk shop.

923
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:12,367
(Pager beeps)

924
00:49:12,423 --> 00:49:14,183
Yeah, that would be nice.

925
00:49:14,215 --> 00:49:17,045
Uh, I'm sorry. I have to take
this. Uh, I'll be right back.

926
00:49:17,046 --> 00:49:18,078
(Door opens)

927
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:20,082
What the hell was that?

928
00:49:20,083 --> 00:49:21,104
- (Door closes)
- He was flirting with you.

929
00:49:21,107 --> 00:49:23,003
He is my obstetrician.

930
00:49:23,004 --> 00:49:25,070
Well, he knows you're fertile.
Men like that.

931
00:49:25,071 --> 00:49:28,007
Enough. I don't need you
to fix me up.

932
00:49:28,008 --> 00:49:30,121
I'm just worried about you.
I don't want you to be lonely.

933
00:49:30,122 --> 00:49:32,037
Well, good news.

934
00:49:32,038 --> 00:49:34,050
In three weeks, I will have
a permanent houseguest.

935
00:49:34,051 --> 00:49:37,078
I'm talking about
the other kind of lonely.

936
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:40,074
Even single mothers
have needs.

937
00:49:40,075 --> 00:49:43,095
Childbirth can't possibly be
as painful as this conversation.

938
00:49:43,096 --> 00:49:45,058
You don't know
how hard it's gonna be.

939
00:49:45,059 --> 00:49:48,016
Having a kid is exhausting.

940
00:49:48,017 --> 00:49:51,037
You have no time to exercise
or eat right.

941
00:49:51,038 --> 00:49:55,041
The great news is, you don't
have to let yourself go.

942
00:49:55,042 --> 00:49:57,091
I'll be there,
helping with the baby.

943
00:49:57,092 --> 00:49:59,083
So you'll have time
to go to the gym.

944
00:49:59,084 --> 00:50:02,028
I'll let <i>myself </i>go.
I don't mind.

945
00:50:02,029 --> 00:50:04,049
Mom, I just felt the baby

946
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:07,016
tap out "make her stop"
in Morse code.

947
00:50:07,017 --> 00:50:10,078
It's hard to find a man
when you're a single mom.

948
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:12,075
That's my point. I'm done.

949
00:50:15,108 --> 00:50:18,045
As I remember,
you found Mike.

950
00:50:18,046 --> 00:50:21,037
Yes. Well...

951
00:50:21,038 --> 00:50:24,099
I was very lucky.

952
00:50:24,968 --> 00:50:27,016
You sure were.

953
00:50:27,017 --> 00:50:29,045
(Sighs)

954
00:50:29,590 --> 00:50:31,432
There you go.
(Groans)

955
00:50:31,514 --> 00:50:34,785
Oh, beautiful day,
isn't it?

956
00:50:34,816 --> 00:50:38,054
One of the nice things about dying
is every day seems beautiful.

957
00:50:39,104 --> 00:50:41,457
You always wince
when I say things like that.

958
00:50:41,557 --> 00:50:45,049
I don't mean to.
Its just... hard for me.

959
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:48,066
For you? Hey, you wanna
switch places with her?

960
00:50:48,067 --> 00:50:50,024
Be nice, Roy.

961
00:50:50,025 --> 00:50:52,074
By the way, Karen,
I got that song you wanted

962
00:50:52,075 --> 00:50:54,074
for your... funeral.

963
00:50:54,075 --> 00:50:55,755
Oh, thank you, Bree.

964
00:50:55,786 --> 00:50:57,103
Johnny Mathis.

965
00:50:57,104 --> 00:50:59,111
My girlfriends and I
taught each other to dance

966
00:50:59,112 --> 00:51:01,079
listening to
"Wonderful! Wonderful!"

967
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:05,032
Aw. Oh, I was only able
to get it on a CD.

968
00:51:05,033 --> 00:51:06,078
No, no.

969
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:09,011
It's gotta be on a 45 that I can
play on a record player,

970
00:51:09,012 --> 00:51:10,574
just like I did
when I was a kid.

971
00:51:12,589 --> 00:51:15,028
By the way, I'll also need
the record player.

972
00:51:15,029 --> 00:51:18,092
You know, it's really hard
to find those 45s.

973
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:21,007
But I'm gonna keep looking.

974
00:51:21,008 --> 00:51:22,046
(Cell phone rings)

975
00:51:22,047 --> 00:51:23,099
(Beep)

976
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:26,078
Hello?

977
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:28,100
Oh. Hello, Trip.

978
00:51:30,092 --> 00:51:33,046
I already told you,
I'm not interested.

979
00:51:34,108 --> 00:51:37,024
Please, stop calling.

980
00:51:37,025 --> 00:51:38,045
(Beep)

981
00:51:38,046 --> 00:51:40,045
Is that your lawyer friend?

982
00:51:40,046 --> 00:51:42,024
Well, you're half right.

983
00:51:42,025 --> 00:51:43,117
I thought you liked him.

984
00:51:43,118 --> 00:51:47,066
I did, more than I've liked
anybody in a very long time.

985
00:51:47,067 --> 00:51:50,057
But then I realized that
he just manipulates people

986
00:51:50,058 --> 00:51:52,049
so that he can get
what he wants.

987
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:55,066
Can't trust him.

988
00:51:55,067 --> 00:51:59,004
All right, you two,
I will check in on you later.

989
00:52:01,033 --> 00:52:05,045
Roy, be a peach and look up
a phone number for me.

990
00:52:05,046 --> 00:52:07,116
Karen, what are you up to?

991
00:52:07,117 --> 00:52:09,045
I don't know.

992
00:52:09,046 --> 00:52:11,012
I thought it would be fun
to screw with people's lives

993
00:52:11,013 --> 00:52:13,099
one last time
before I check out.

994
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:15,049
(Chuckles)

995
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:17,049
(Laughs)

996
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:20,082
Wow. It sounds like
you are doing pretty good.

997
00:52:20,083 --> 00:52:22,061
I mean, your own company?

998
00:52:22,062 --> 00:52:24,083
Yeah, I didn't want to brag
in front of the girls,

999
00:52:24,084 --> 00:52:26,095
but it's worth a few bucks.

1000
00:52:26,096 --> 00:52:28,037
That was you not bragging?

1001
00:52:28,038 --> 00:52:31,042
Well, just look at our last
financial statement.

1002
00:52:34,042 --> 00:52:36,108
- (Gasps)
- Ha! I love doing that!

1003
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:39,016
Oh! (Laughs) Have a seat.

1004
00:52:39,017 --> 00:52:42,120
In fact, we are doing so well

1005
00:52:42,121 --> 00:52:45,091
that we are looking to expand
worldwide,

1006
00:52:45,092 --> 00:52:48,111
and I would like you to head
our U.S. division

1007
00:52:48,112 --> 00:52:50,054
in New York.

1008
00:52:53,012 --> 00:52:55,082
Oh, my God.

1009
00:52:55,083 --> 00:52:58,107
That's a huge job.

1010
00:52:58,108 --> 00:53:00,095
Why me?

1011
00:53:00,096 --> 00:53:03,011
Because you're the smartest
businesswoman I know.

1012
00:53:03,012 --> 00:53:04,092
And when I heard
that you and Tom split,

1013
00:53:04,093 --> 00:53:07,024
I thought, there's nothing
tying you to Fairview.

1014
00:53:07,025 --> 00:53:08,044
Well, here's the thing...

1015
00:53:08,045 --> 00:53:09,104
20 minutes
until my job interview,

1016
00:53:09,105 --> 00:53:12,049
and I lose a button. Can you...
Katherine?

1017
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:14,016
<i>That's </i>the thing.

1018
00:53:14,017 --> 00:53:16,061
What brings you back
to the states?

1019
00:53:16,062 --> 00:53:18,007
Your wife, actually.

1020
00:53:18,008 --> 00:53:21,037
I came to offer her a job
in New York.

1021
00:53:22,378 --> 00:53:26,057
- Wow.
- But obviously, I'm not taking it.

1022
00:53:26,058 --> 00:53:28,038
- (Chuckles)
- (Chuckles)

1023
00:53:28,041 --> 00:53:32,032
We just got back together,
and I couldn't be happier.

1024
00:53:32,033 --> 00:53:36,016
Mmm. Sorry, Katherine. I know how
painful it is to lose Lynette,

1025
00:53:36,017 --> 00:53:38,012
and how sweet it is
to get her back.

1026
00:53:38,013 --> 00:53:39,053
(Chuckles)

1027
00:53:39,054 --> 00:53:41,061
Here, leave the shirt with me,
babe. I got it.

1028
00:53:41,062 --> 00:53:42,763
Thanks.

1029
00:53:42,813 --> 00:53:44,070
Well...

1030
00:53:44,889 --> 00:53:48,062
I'm in town for three days if you
wanna keep talking about this.

1031
00:53:48,063 --> 00:53:51,087
No. I feel pretty comfortable
with my decision.

1032
00:53:51,088 --> 00:53:54,078
Okay, but the Lynette
that I knew

1033
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:58,120
was never happy with a life
of... sewing buttons.

1034
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:08,437
(Door closes)

1035
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:11,874
Hey, hey! Sorry I'm late. I'm starving!
What are we having?

1036
00:54:12,969 --> 00:54:14,820
I had a lovely steak.

1037
00:54:14,821 --> 00:54:16,808
Then an hour later,
I had your lovely steak.

1038
00:54:16,809 --> 00:54:19,832
So I guess you're having...
Cereal.

1039
00:54:19,833 --> 00:54:22,874
Oh, come on. You know how it is.
First day of a new job... it was crazy.

1040
00:54:22,875 --> 00:54:24,858
And what? (Sighs)
You lost your phone?

1041
00:54:24,859 --> 00:54:28,807
(Sighs) I know, I know.
I'm a terrible, awful person.

1042
00:54:28,808 --> 00:54:32,866
<i>But </i>maybe you can
find a way to forgive me

1043
00:54:32,867 --> 00:54:35,857
after you see this.

1044
00:54:37,133 --> 00:54:38,664
Whoa.
(Laughs)

1045
00:54:38,670 --> 00:54:40,558
I know. I saw it,
and all I could think about

1046
00:54:40,583 --> 00:54:43,857
was how sexy it would look on
that big, strong wrist of yours.

1047
00:54:43,858 --> 00:54:45,828
(Both chuckle)

1048
00:54:45,829 --> 00:54:47,850
Well, I don't think
I've ever seen anyth...

1049
00:54:49,485 --> 00:54:51,813
Oh, my God. Wait a minute.

1050
00:54:51,858 --> 00:54:53,861
What?

1051
00:54:53,862 --> 00:54:57,281
I know this move.
I <i>invented </i>this move.

1052
00:54:57,338 --> 00:54:59,882
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1053
00:54:59,883 --> 00:55:01,861
It's what
I used to do to you.

1054
00:55:01,862 --> 00:55:02,883
I'd buy you jewelry

1055
00:55:02,884 --> 00:55:05,861
to compensate
for being a lousy husband.

1056
00:55:05,862 --> 00:55:08,811
And it worked beautifully,
so shut up and enjoy it.

1057
00:55:08,812 --> 00:55:10,877
I can't believe you're trying
to buy me off with a watch.

1058
00:55:10,878 --> 00:55:12,815
(Gasps) Ooh! When you shake
your wrist like that,

1059
00:55:12,816 --> 00:55:14,519
the diamonds really catch
the light.

1060
00:55:14,525 --> 00:55:16,175
Oh, my God,
you're even quoting me!

1061
00:55:16,212 --> 00:55:18,849
(Scoffs) You don't want
the watch? Fine.

1062
00:55:18,850 --> 00:55:20,846
But everyone has a price.
You name it.

1063
00:55:20,847 --> 00:55:23,849
Sex? Massage?
Three stooges marathon?

1064
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:26,882
The price of my forgiveness

1065
00:55:26,883 --> 00:55:29,849
is you paying
a little more attention to me,

1066
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:32,887
being more present, more respectful
of my feelings and needs.

1067
00:55:33,961 --> 00:55:36,419
- You want a new car.
- I'm going to bed.

1068
00:55:36,456 --> 00:55:39,849
What? No, come back!
You're sexy when you're angry.

1069
00:55:39,850 --> 00:55:41,867
Yep! That's mine, too!

1070
00:55:46,821 --> 00:55:49,425
Lynette Scavo?

1071
00:55:49,775 --> 00:55:51,828
Oh, my God!

1072
00:55:51,829 --> 00:55:54,832
- How long as it been?
- Oh! A long time.

1073
00:55:54,833 --> 00:55:57,853
- How are you doing, Natalie?
- I'm great.

1074
00:55:57,854 --> 00:56:01,799
The question is, how are you?
I heard about you and Tom.

1075
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,870
Oh. Yeah, we went through
a rough patch,

1076
00:56:03,871 --> 00:56:06,861
but we're back together now,
and things are better than ever.

1077
00:56:06,862 --> 00:56:07,866
(Chuckles)

1078
00:56:07,867 --> 00:56:11,841
What a relief. I just kept
thinking, "poor Lynette..."

1079
00:56:11,842 --> 00:56:13,823
"sacrificed her whole career
for that man,

1080
00:56:13,824 --> 00:56:15,817
and then
it didn't even work out?"

1081
00:56:15,818 --> 00:56:18,837
Oh, just to be clear, I didn't
sacrifice my career for anyone.

1082
00:56:18,838 --> 00:56:20,816
Oh, I didn't mean anything
by it.

1083
00:56:20,817 --> 00:56:22,799
If anything,
I'm jealous of you.

1084
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:23,841
Oh?

1085
00:56:23,842 --> 00:56:26,861
My company has branches
in 15 cities around the world.

1086
00:56:26,862 --> 00:56:28,858
I live out of a suitcase.
And you?

1087
00:56:28,859 --> 00:56:31,866
There must be days when
you don't even leave the house.

1088
00:56:31,867 --> 00:56:34,812
Oh, the simple life.

1089
00:56:36,838 --> 00:56:38,832
I got a job offer yesterday.

1090
00:56:38,833 --> 00:56:39,853
Really?

1091
00:56:39,854 --> 00:56:41,825
Yeah, this big
European food company is

1092
00:56:41,826 --> 00:56:44,857
taking its brand to the states,
and they want me to run it.

1093
00:56:44,858 --> 00:56:45,861
So...

1094
00:56:45,862 --> 00:56:48,807
Impressive.
When do you start?

1095
00:56:48,808 --> 00:56:52,820
Well, it's in New York, so it's
a lot to consider, and...

1096
00:56:52,821 --> 00:56:54,866
And that is the difference
between me and you.

1097
00:56:54,867 --> 00:56:57,866
I'd grab an opportunity
like that in a second,

1098
00:56:57,867 --> 00:56:59,870
but not you.

1099
00:56:59,871 --> 00:57:00,887
(Chuckles)

1100
00:57:00,888 --> 00:57:03,857
In your heart of hearts,
you're a wife and a mommy.

1101
00:57:03,858 --> 00:57:05,828
Congrats.

1102
00:57:05,829 --> 00:57:07,808
See ya.

1103
00:57:09,838 --> 00:57:10,871
(Dials)

1104
00:57:14,829 --> 00:57:16,799
Katherine, it's Lynette.

1105
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,861
Call me back. We have to talk.

1106
00:57:18,862 --> 00:57:20,887
(Beep)

1107
00:57:22,465 --> 00:57:25,865
Hey, gotta run. Huge day. The e-mails
have been coming in since 7:00.

1108
00:57:25,866 --> 00:57:27,869
Just so you know,
our new gardener started today.

1109
00:57:27,870 --> 00:57:31,196
Great. Mind running defense for me? I really
don't have time to chitchat with the help.

1110
00:57:31,234 --> 00:57:32,858
It'll be my pleasure.

1111
00:57:37,804 --> 00:57:39,849
Oh. <i>Hola.</i>

1112
00:57:39,850 --> 00:57:41,279
I'm Carmen.

1113
00:57:42,191 --> 00:57:43,895
Uh-huh.

1114
00:57:45,502 --> 00:57:46,861
What the hell is that?

1115
00:57:46,862 --> 00:57:48,824
That's our new gardener.

1116
00:57:48,825 --> 00:57:51,854
She's gonna take care of everything
around here that's been neglected.

1117
00:57:52,837 --> 00:57:54,828
Oh, you think that's funny?

1118
00:57:54,829 --> 00:57:56,848
Just making a point.

1119
00:57:56,849 --> 00:57:59,592
You crossed a line,
Carlos.

1120
00:57:59,617 --> 00:58:00,879
You crossed a line!

1121
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,882
Gaby, come on!

1122
00:58:03,883 --> 00:58:05,824
(Car door closes, engine starts)

1123
00:58:05,825 --> 00:58:07,867
- Gaby!
- (Tires peal)

1124
00:58:28,271 --> 00:58:31,861
(Sighs) Watch the dirt.
And watch the grass.

1125
00:58:31,862 --> 00:58:33,799
Focus, ladies!

1126
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,896
This dress costs more than
your houses put together!

1127
00:58:35,897 --> 00:58:38,852
Okay, you know what, Renee? I know
this is your day, but it's only 10:00,

1128
00:58:38,853 --> 00:58:40,351
and you're already
a huge pain in the ass.

1129
00:58:40,389 --> 00:58:43,808
Well, then I'm running late. I should've
been a huge pain in the ass by 9:00.

1130
00:58:43,809 --> 00:58:46,879
You in the stupid
hat, open the door!

1131
00:58:52,854 --> 00:58:54,465
(Chuckles) Oh, wow!

1132
00:58:54,496 --> 00:58:56,845
Where are you going
all dolled up?

1133
00:58:56,846 --> 00:59:00,866
Renee's wedding. I just wanted
to check on Karen before I left.

1134
00:59:00,867 --> 00:59:02,799
She's sleeping.

1135
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,862
I don't think
it'll be long now.

1136
00:59:06,871 --> 00:59:10,878
Oh, Roy.
I am... so sorry.

1137
00:59:10,879 --> 00:59:12,845
Would you like me to stay?

1138
00:59:12,846 --> 00:59:15,991
No. This is our
time together.

1139
00:59:16,035 --> 00:59:17,435
We'll be fine.

1140
00:59:19,551 --> 00:59:21,571
Oh, good!
You found Karen's record.

1141
00:59:21,842 --> 00:59:23,866
Not me. That lawyer guy.

1142
00:59:23,867 --> 00:59:27,870
- Trip? - Karen told him
she really wanted it.

1143
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:32,816
The son of a gun must've gone
to 20 different record stores.

1144
00:59:32,817 --> 00:59:35,166
(Sighs)
Well, that's lovely.

1145
00:59:35,209 --> 00:59:38,811
You should've seen the smile on
her face when he brought it in.

1146
00:59:38,812 --> 00:59:40,084
Mm.

1147
00:59:40,341 --> 00:59:42,879
He's... a good guy.

1148
00:59:45,862 --> 00:59:47,807
(Inhales sharply)

1149
00:59:47,808 --> 00:59:50,861
Do you seriously need
to stretch out on her?

1150
00:59:50,862 --> 00:59:52,838
What do you want me to do?
Crease?

1151
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:54,837
(Cell phone rings and beeps)

1152
00:59:54,838 --> 00:59:57,866
(Scoffs) Hello, Ben.

1153
00:59:57,890 --> 01:00:01,429
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't raise your voice to me.

1154
01:00:01,479 --> 01:00:03,315
Well, hair and makeup
took forever,

1155
01:00:03,346 --> 01:00:05,857
and then we had to wait
20 minutes for Susan, and...

1156
01:00:05,858 --> 01:00:07,820
I was totally on time.

1157
01:00:07,821 --> 01:00:09,549
(Lowered voice) He does not
need to know that.

1158
01:00:09,586 --> 01:00:11,821
(Normal voice)
Yeah, we're on our way now.

1159
01:00:11,822 --> 01:00:13,853
I promise we'll be there
no later than...

1160
01:00:13,854 --> 01:00:15,879
- Oh! We're going through a tunnel!
- (Beep)

1161
01:00:15,882 --> 01:00:17,849
How late <i>are </i>we?

1162
01:00:17,850 --> 01:00:19,857
I should've been
cutting the cake by <i>now!</i>

1163
01:00:19,858 --> 01:00:22,857
Okay, not a good day
to hand her a knife.

1164
01:00:22,858 --> 01:00:24,845
Mm.

1165
01:00:24,846 --> 01:00:26,481
(Exhales deeply)

1166
01:00:26,525 --> 01:00:27,883
Julie, are you okay?

1167
01:00:27,884 --> 01:00:30,867
- Oh, my God.
- What? What's wrong?

1168
01:00:30,870 --> 01:00:33,866
(Exhales sharply)
I think my water just broke.

1169
01:00:33,867 --> 01:00:35,799
(All gasp)

1170
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,857
(Women scream)

1171
01:00:37,858 --> 01:00:38,888
- (Groans)
- Oh! Ah!

1172
01:00:38,889 --> 01:00:40,854
Aah! How could you do this
to me?!

1173
01:00:40,855 --> 01:00:42,496
She's in labor!

1174
01:00:42,527 --> 01:00:43,867
Oh! Nine months!

1175
01:00:43,868 --> 01:00:46,874
You had nine months, and <i>this </i>is
the moment you pick?!

1176
01:00:46,875 --> 01:00:48,891
Renee, I am so sorry. Aah! Aah!

1177
01:00:48,892 --> 01:00:50,875
Hold on.
Everything's gonna be fine.

1178
01:00:50,876 --> 01:00:52,837
How?! My dress is ruined!

1179
01:00:52,838 --> 01:00:54,825
- (Julie and Susan breathing deeply)
- Wait, I got an idea.

1180
01:00:54,828 --> 01:00:57,832
Hey, driver, we need you
to swing by Cumberly's.

1181
01:00:57,833 --> 01:01:00,807
My store has
an amazing bridal department.

1182
01:01:00,808 --> 01:01:02,800
Are you insane?!
Take us to the hospital!

1183
01:01:02,801 --> 01:01:04,846
- Oh, come on. She just started labor.
- (Groans)

1184
01:01:04,849 --> 01:01:06,853
Keep your legs together,
honey.

1185
01:01:06,854 --> 01:01:08,861
Look, we're just gonna run in
and grab a dress.

1186
01:01:08,862 --> 01:01:10,286
(Scoffs) And shoes.

1187
01:01:10,330 --> 01:01:11,845
You need shoes, too?

1188
01:01:11,846 --> 01:01:13,828
Thanks
to old faithful here.

1189
01:01:13,829 --> 01:01:16,846
My daughter is having a baby, and
you wanna go on a shopping spree?!

1190
01:01:16,847 --> 01:01:19,845
Uh, could someone please
just tell me where to go?

1191
01:01:19,846 --> 01:01:21,817
- Cumberly's!
- Hospital!

1192
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:23,891
(Breathing deeply)
Let's just go to Cumberly's.

1193
01:01:23,892 --> 01:01:25,883
- Julie!
- Mom, my contractions just started.

1194
01:01:25,886 --> 01:01:27,837
We have time. Aah!

1195
01:01:27,838 --> 01:01:29,846
Ohh! Do you have to keep
doing that?

1196
01:01:32,838 --> 01:01:34,866
(Brakes screech)

1197
01:01:34,867 --> 01:01:37,845
Okay,
size 6s are over there.

1198
01:01:37,846 --> 01:01:40,804
- Hey!
- Oh, don't lie to me!

1199
01:01:42,846 --> 01:01:44,887
(Scoffs) No.

1200
01:01:44,888 --> 01:01:46,807
No.

1201
01:01:46,808 --> 01:01:47,891
God, no.

1202
01:01:47,892 --> 01:01:51,446
(Gasps)

1203
01:01:51,465 --> 01:01:52,888
Now <i>that </i>is beautiful.

1204
01:01:52,889 --> 01:01:54,891
My daughter's looking at this.

1205
01:01:54,892 --> 01:01:56,888
- When's her wedding?
- Three months.

1206
01:01:56,891 --> 01:01:58,891
Mine's in five minutes.

1207
01:01:58,892 --> 01:02:00,804
Unzip me.

1208
01:02:01,871 --> 01:02:03,845
(Zip)

1209
01:02:03,846 --> 01:02:05,853
Oh! Hi. Hi. (Chuckles)

1210
01:02:05,854 --> 01:02:06,896
I'm, uh, Gabrielle Solis,

1211
01:02:06,897 --> 01:02:09,816
head of V.I.P. Sales
here at Cumberly's.

1212
01:02:09,817 --> 01:02:11,883
I'm Kent, minimum wage worker
stuck here on a Saturday.

1213
01:02:11,884 --> 01:02:13,832
Can I help you?

1214
01:02:13,833 --> 01:02:15,866
Uh, I need to borrow
a bridal gown.

1215
01:02:15,867 --> 01:02:17,871
- Borrow?
- Just for the afternoon.

1216
01:02:17,874 --> 01:02:19,887
We don't lend bridal dresses.

1217
01:02:19,888 --> 01:02:22,820
Well... (Chuckles)
I know it's not policy,

1218
01:02:22,821 --> 01:02:24,845
but can't you do a favor
for a fellow worker?

1219
01:02:24,846 --> 01:02:26,874
Ma'am,
I've never heard of you.

1220
01:02:26,875 --> 01:02:29,474
Do you have
your employee I.D. Card?

1221
01:02:29,499 --> 01:02:30,875
No. I'm not
one of those nerds

1222
01:02:30,876 --> 01:02:33,851
who carries her I.D. Card
on a...

1223
01:02:34,489 --> 01:02:36,853
Handsome Lanyard. (Chuckles)

1224
01:02:36,854 --> 01:02:40,318
So you want me to give you
a $6,000 wedding dress?

1225
01:02:40,337 --> 01:02:42,866
$5,000 with
my employee discount. (Chuckles)

1226
01:02:42,867 --> 01:02:44,804
Go away, ma'am.

1227
01:02:46,862 --> 01:02:48,854
- Ow!
- Ohh! Oh, that was a big one!

1228
01:02:48,857 --> 01:02:50,857
Oh! They seem to be coming
a lot faster.

1229
01:02:50,858 --> 01:02:52,108
Oh. (Sighs)

1230
01:02:52,876 --> 01:02:54,882
Excuse me,
would you mind going in

1231
01:02:54,883 --> 01:02:56,867
and finding out
what's keeping them?

1232
01:02:56,868 --> 01:02:59,803
Things seem to be
speeding up a bit back here.

1233
01:02:59,804 --> 01:03:00,825
Right away.

1234
01:03:02,817 --> 01:03:04,810
(Exhales sharply)
Mom, what are you doing?

1235
01:03:04,811 --> 01:03:06,883
You are not having my granddaughter
in the back of a limousine!

1236
01:03:06,884 --> 01:03:08,804
(Grunts)

1237
01:03:10,588 --> 01:03:11,816
Ooh!

1238
01:03:11,817 --> 01:03:12,854
(Exhales deeply) Keep breathing!

1239
01:03:12,855 --> 01:03:14,837
(Starts engine)

1240
01:03:14,838 --> 01:03:15,875
(Tires peal)

1241
01:03:18,858 --> 01:03:19,871
(Speaking inaudibly)

1242
01:03:20,896 --> 01:03:22,963
- Oh.
- Ahh. So we set?

1243
01:03:22,982 --> 01:03:25,046
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Told you I was
a big shot here. (Chuckles)

1244
01:03:25,077 --> 01:03:27,881
Now walk with me. Um, there's
only one tiny hiccup.

1245
01:03:27,882 --> 01:03:29,526
(Kent) Hey, where you going
with that dress?!

1246
01:03:29,545 --> 01:03:31,804
- And now we run.
- (Gasps)

1247
01:03:36,854 --> 01:03:39,837
(Both panting)

1248
01:03:39,838 --> 01:03:41,841
Where... where's the limo?

1249
01:03:41,842 --> 01:03:43,825
- I don't know. It was right here.
- (Alarm blaring)

1250
01:03:43,826 --> 01:03:46,878
And we're running again!
Aah!

1251
01:03:51,850 --> 01:03:54,812
(Both panting)

1252
01:03:56,808 --> 01:03:59,828
Do you... not have a car?

1253
01:03:59,829 --> 01:04:01,895
Does it look like
we have a car, huh?

1254
01:04:01,896 --> 01:04:03,875
- Does it?!
- Aah!

1255
01:04:03,878 --> 01:04:06,803
Okay, all right, again,
late for your own wedding.

1256
01:04:06,804 --> 01:04:08,261
- (Grunts)
- Maybe kill this guy later.

1257
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:10,326
(Breathing heavily)

1258
01:04:11,862 --> 01:04:14,799
Don't say a word.
You hear me?!

1259
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:17,832
You have no idea what I had
to go through to get here,

1260
01:04:17,833 --> 01:04:21,853
so if you even give me
<i>one syllable </i>of grief,

1261
01:04:21,854 --> 01:04:25,870
I will <i>kick </i>your sorry ass
all the way back to Australia!

1262
01:04:25,871 --> 01:04:28,871
(Breathing heavily)

1263
01:04:30,804 --> 01:04:32,892
I've never seen anyone
look so beautiful.

1264
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:38,821
(Sobbing)

1265
01:04:39,883 --> 01:04:41,828
(Renee laughs)

1266
01:04:41,829 --> 01:04:42,887
(Chuckles)

1267
01:04:42,888 --> 01:04:45,875
Let's go inside and get started
on our wedded bliss, eh?

1268
01:04:50,817 --> 01:04:52,820
(Jazz playing,
indistinct conversations)

1269
01:04:52,821 --> 01:04:54,832
No, no, Katherine,
I <i>am </i>excited.

1270
01:04:54,833 --> 01:04:56,882
I just need
to talk to Tom first.

1271
01:04:56,883 --> 01:05:01,883
Well, can you give me till the end
of the day? Okay, thanks. Bye.

1272
01:05:01,884 --> 01:05:03,803
Talk to me about what?
(Chuckles)

1273
01:05:03,804 --> 01:05:05,825
- Hi!
- Hi. Mmm.

1274
01:05:05,828 --> 01:05:09,557
Oh, um, Katherine keeps
pushing me about this job thing.

1275
01:05:09,582 --> 01:05:12,662
- I thought you told her "no."
- I did,

1276
01:05:12,674 --> 01:05:14,896
but once she started talking
about compensation packages

1277
01:05:14,897 --> 01:05:17,895
and... (Chuckles)

1278
01:05:17,896 --> 01:05:19,878
You're negotiating a salary?

1279
01:05:19,879 --> 01:05:22,828
Lynette, we... (Sighs)

1280
01:05:22,829 --> 01:05:25,807
We just got back together.
What... what are you doing?

1281
01:05:25,808 --> 01:05:26,879
It could be the last time

1282
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:29,878
an opportunity like this
comes along for me.

1283
01:05:29,879 --> 01:05:32,895
If I don't take it,
I'm... I'm afraid that...

1284
01:05:32,896 --> 01:05:34,878
You won't be happy.

1285
01:05:34,879 --> 01:05:37,861
Well...

1286
01:05:37,862 --> 01:05:38,883
Yeah.

1287
01:05:43,846 --> 01:05:44,866
Hey.

1288
01:05:44,867 --> 01:05:46,828
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1289
01:05:46,829 --> 01:05:48,853
Lynette...

1290
01:05:48,854 --> 01:05:52,895
I would do anything, I would
go anywhere in the world

1291
01:05:52,896 --> 01:05:56,897
if I believed it would
finally make you happy.

1292
01:05:57,416 --> 01:05:59,896
But for as long as I have known
you, you've always thought

1293
01:05:59,897 --> 01:06:03,917
you needed something else
to make you complete.

1294
01:06:05,736 --> 01:06:07,870
And I'm starting to realize

1295
01:06:07,871 --> 01:06:10,838
nothing ever will.

1296
01:06:19,829 --> 01:06:22,828
(Indistinct conversations
and laughter)

1297
01:06:22,829 --> 01:06:27,821
(Piano playing light jazz)

1298
01:06:35,650 --> 01:06:37,401
Hello, Trip.

1299
01:06:38,132 --> 01:06:41,853
Ben invited me, so if you wanna
slug somebody, slug him.

1300
01:06:41,854 --> 01:06:44,850
(Chuckles) No.
I'm glad to see you.

1301
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:50,537
I wanted to, uh, thank you for
what you did for Mrs. McCluskey.

1302
01:06:50,581 --> 01:06:52,381
That was very kind.

1303
01:06:52,412 --> 01:06:54,411
She's an awesome lady,

1304
01:06:54,812 --> 01:06:57,394
and she once helped out
a client of mine.

1305
01:06:59,821 --> 01:07:02,875
Well, that's all I wanted to say.
Enjoy the reception.

1306
01:07:02,876 --> 01:07:05,867
Really, you can't think
of anything else to say to me?

1307
01:07:06,896 --> 01:07:08,816
Like what?

1308
01:07:08,817 --> 01:07:11,799
I don't know. Like, um...

1309
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:14,799
How about, "hey, Trip,
maybe you <i>are </i>a good guy."

1310
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:15,883
I should give you
another chance"?

1311
01:07:15,884 --> 01:07:19,870
Is that why you found
that old record? (Chuckles)

1312
01:07:19,871 --> 01:07:21,816
To impress me?

1313
01:07:21,817 --> 01:07:24,829
Do you really think that?

1314
01:07:26,846 --> 01:07:28,867
Look...

1315
01:07:30,846 --> 01:07:32,812
I know I wanna be with you.

1316
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:37,866
But if you don't think
you can ever trust me again...

1317
01:07:37,867 --> 01:07:39,896
Well, I'm not gonna beg.

1318
01:07:45,821 --> 01:07:47,824
Why?

1319
01:07:47,825 --> 01:07:49,807
Why?

1320
01:07:49,808 --> 01:07:53,816
Yes. <i>Why </i>do you want
to be with me?

1321
01:07:53,817 --> 01:07:55,799
You were my lawyer.

1322
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:57,820
You know all the ugliest details
of my life...

1323
01:07:57,821 --> 01:08:01,861
my lying, my drinking,
my promiscuity.

1324
01:08:01,862 --> 01:08:04,857
I was actually relieved when you
put Gaby on the witness stand

1325
01:08:04,858 --> 01:08:07,887
because it explained
why you kissed me.

1326
01:08:07,888 --> 01:08:11,816
It was a manipulation.
I got it.

1327
01:08:11,817 --> 01:08:15,824
But to keep saying you want me
when you know how...

1328
01:08:15,825 --> 01:08:17,842
(Whispers)
Horribly flawed I am.

1329
01:08:19,892 --> 01:08:24,804
I don't trust you because
it just doesn't make sense.

1330
01:08:26,888 --> 01:08:28,882
How about...

1331
01:08:28,883 --> 01:08:32,804
I explain it?

1332
01:08:40,842 --> 01:08:41,861
Mmm.

1333
01:08:41,862 --> 01:08:43,820
Did that clear it up
for you?

1334
01:08:43,821 --> 01:08:45,857
Almost.

1335
01:08:45,858 --> 01:08:48,837
Look, Bree... (Sighs)

1336
01:08:48,838 --> 01:08:51,820
All those ugly details
you're talking about, I...

1337
01:08:51,821 --> 01:08:54,550
They just prove
that you're human.

1338
01:08:54,569 --> 01:08:55,883
I don't want to love
an ideal.

1339
01:08:55,884 --> 01:08:58,800
I wanna... I wanna love
a real person.

1340
01:09:00,892 --> 01:09:02,849
(Whispers)
So what happens now?

1341
01:09:02,850 --> 01:09:04,878
Well...

1342
01:09:04,879 --> 01:09:06,862
First, we're gonna walk out
onto that dance floor

1343
01:09:06,863 --> 01:09:08,874
and show your friends
how it's really done.

1344
01:09:08,875 --> 01:09:11,887
Hopefully by then,
I'll get up the courage

1345
01:09:11,888 --> 01:09:14,870
to once again ask you
to go out on a date me.

1346
01:09:14,871 --> 01:09:16,800
Of course,
even as I'm saying that,

1347
01:09:16,801 --> 01:09:18,879
I'm still not sure
what you're gonna say.

1348
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:25,820
Did that clear it up
for you?

1349
01:09:37,867 --> 01:09:40,867
(Tango music playing)

1350
01:09:48,812 --> 01:09:52,443
Hey, you wanna dance?
They're playing a tango.

1351
01:09:52,467 --> 01:09:54,389
Wow. You're finally talking
to me again.

1352
01:09:54,457 --> 01:09:56,398
I must be out
of the doghouse.

1353
01:09:56,468 --> 01:09:58,483
No, I'm still pretty mad.

1354
01:09:58,854 --> 01:10:01,095
Why? It was a joke.

1355
01:10:01,193 --> 01:10:03,201
All those years ago,
when...

1356
01:10:03,821 --> 01:10:05,820
I did what I did
with John Rowland?

1357
01:10:05,821 --> 01:10:07,882
That is the most shameful thing
in my life.

1358
01:10:07,883 --> 01:10:10,866
You can't make jokes about it.
It's too painful.

1359
01:10:10,867 --> 01:10:12,849
Fair enough.

1360
01:10:12,850 --> 01:10:14,887
You know...

1361
01:10:14,888 --> 01:10:17,837
It was the most shameful thing
in my life, too.

1362
01:10:17,838 --> 01:10:19,845
I'm sorry.

1363
01:10:19,846 --> 01:10:21,820
No.

1364
01:10:21,821 --> 01:10:23,891
What's shameful
is that I neglected you.

1365
01:10:23,892 --> 01:10:28,820
I had this beautiful wife,

1366
01:10:28,821 --> 01:10:30,883
but I focused
on all the wrong things.

1367
01:10:32,838 --> 01:10:34,845
It was a tough time
for both of us.

1368
01:10:34,846 --> 01:10:38,837
I guess that's the point
I was making hiring Carmen.

1369
01:10:38,838 --> 01:10:40,861
Our roles are reversed now,

1370
01:10:40,862 --> 01:10:42,825
but we can't start drifting away
from each other.

1371
01:10:42,826 --> 01:10:45,882
I <i>never </i>want
to go back to that again.

1372
01:10:45,883 --> 01:10:47,891
We won't.

1373
01:10:47,892 --> 01:10:50,874
We've grown up since then.

1374
01:10:50,875 --> 01:10:52,879
(Chuckles)

1375
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:59,807
Although,
for two smart grownups,

1376
01:10:59,808 --> 01:11:00,883
we sure seem
to fight a lot.

1377
01:11:00,884 --> 01:11:02,832
(Chuckles)

1378
01:11:02,833 --> 01:11:06,799
Why is it other couples
seem to waltz through life?

1379
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:08,895
That's easy.

1380
01:11:08,896 --> 01:11:11,866
You and me?

1381
01:11:11,867 --> 01:11:13,882
We're doing a tango.

1382
01:11:13,883 --> 01:11:15,800
(Kisses)

1383
01:11:16,883 --> 01:11:18,800
- (Exhales sharply)
- (Knocks on doorframe)

1384
01:11:18,801 --> 01:11:20,166
Hey. I hear someone's having
a baby.

1385
01:11:20,172 --> 01:11:22,874
Oh, yes, a little
ahead of schedule. Sorry.

1386
01:11:22,875 --> 01:11:25,310
No, it's no problem. I was just
playing hoops down the block.

1387
01:11:25,479 --> 01:11:29,499
Don't worry. I'm gonna wash up, and then
we'll get this show on the road. Okay?

1388
01:11:29,817 --> 01:11:31,940
- Okay.
- All right.

1389
01:11:32,828 --> 01:11:34,870
Did you see his legs?

1390
01:11:34,871 --> 01:11:36,846
How can you not want
to be married to those legs?

1391
01:11:36,847 --> 01:11:38,874
(Groans) Oh, mom, please.

1392
01:11:38,875 --> 01:11:41,878
Right. I'm annoying. Sorry.

1393
01:11:41,879 --> 01:11:43,846
You know, in honor
of this special day,

1394
01:11:43,847 --> 01:11:46,874
I promise to never again bug you
about finding a husband.

1395
01:11:46,875 --> 01:11:49,878
Oh. Ohh. (lnhales sharply)

1396
01:11:49,879 --> 01:11:51,866
Even the baby knows
you're lying.

1397
01:11:51,867 --> 01:11:53,837
(Chuckles)

1398
01:11:53,838 --> 01:11:55,812
- Ohh.
- (Sighs)

1399
01:11:55,815 --> 01:11:58,878
What about you?

1400
01:11:58,879 --> 01:12:00,846
Do you think you'll ever
get married again?

1401
01:12:00,847 --> 01:12:01,866
Julie...

1402
01:12:01,867 --> 01:12:03,811
No, I'm serious.

1403
01:12:03,812 --> 01:12:05,874
You're still young
and gorgeous.

1404
01:12:05,875 --> 01:12:07,861
(Laughs) Oh, I don't know.

1405
01:12:07,862 --> 01:12:11,874
(Inhales and exhales deeply)

1406
01:12:11,875 --> 01:12:14,820
There's a saying...

1407
01:12:14,821 --> 01:12:15,860
"you know
you've hit middle age

1408
01:12:15,861 --> 01:12:17,819
"when your memories become
more important to you

1409
01:12:17,820 --> 01:12:18,846
than your dreams."

1410
01:12:20,804 --> 01:12:23,878
And I have
such wonderful memories...

1411
01:12:23,879 --> 01:12:25,807
of Mike,

1412
01:12:25,808 --> 01:12:28,807
and you kids growing up,

1413
01:12:28,808 --> 01:12:30,871
all of our friends
on the Lane.

1414
01:12:33,804 --> 01:12:34,861
Mm.

1415
01:12:34,862 --> 01:12:40,878
Oh, do I have
one last torrid romance in me?

1416
01:12:40,879 --> 01:12:42,799
Maybe.

1417
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:43,896
(Chuckles)

1418
01:12:45,838 --> 01:12:48,887
<i>But </i>I know if I am
ever cold and lonely,

1419
01:12:48,888 --> 01:12:51,878
I can wrap myself up
in all those memories,

1420
01:12:51,879 --> 01:12:54,891
and I will be content.

1421
01:12:54,892 --> 01:12:57,833
(Sighs deeply)

1422
01:13:04,879 --> 01:13:06,875
(Amplified voice)
So, Renee and Ben,

1423
01:13:06,876 --> 01:13:09,866
never forget
that it takes a lot of love

1424
01:13:09,867 --> 01:13:12,242
to make a house a home.

1425
01:13:12,255 --> 01:13:13,888
And when you're in the market
for a new home,

1426
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:15,807
consider Lee McDermott,
1-800...

1427
01:13:15,808 --> 01:13:17,376
- Give me that!
- (Feedback whines)

1428
01:13:17,419 --> 01:13:19,866
(Amplified voice) Okay.
Matron of honor's turn.

1429
01:13:20,619 --> 01:13:22,891
Lynette Scavo, give us a toast.

1430
01:13:22,892 --> 01:13:25,842
- Oh!
- (Applause)

1431
01:13:25,845 --> 01:13:28,837
(Amplified voice)
Renee and Ben,

1432
01:13:28,838 --> 01:13:31,803
your wedding is one
of the best days of your life

1433
01:13:31,804 --> 01:13:33,625
because it's the day
you realize,

1434
01:13:33,663 --> 01:13:37,375
"I finally have the thing I need
to be happy."

1435
01:13:40,038 --> 01:13:41,878
And then you forget.

1436
01:13:41,879 --> 01:13:44,887
So... then what happens is,

1437
01:13:44,888 --> 01:13:46,883
instead of waking up
every morning

1438
01:13:46,884 --> 01:13:49,824
and shouting,
"somebody loves me!"

1439
01:13:49,825 --> 01:13:51,841
You start looking around
and thinking,

1440
01:13:51,842 --> 01:13:53,861
"what do I want now?

1441
01:13:53,862 --> 01:13:58,828
What's the next thing I need
to be happy?"

1442
01:13:59,956 --> 01:14:01,586
So...

1443
01:14:01,605 --> 01:14:02,879
You look and you look,

1444
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:06,849
and you keep thinking you've
found it, but nothing works.

1445
01:14:06,850 --> 01:14:09,861
And the reason
that nothing works

1446
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:12,016
is because...

1447
01:14:13,604 --> 01:14:16,715
That hole in your heart
that you're trying to fill...

1448
01:14:18,871 --> 01:14:20,829
Is already filled.

1449
01:14:24,994 --> 01:14:26,631
You just forgot.

1450
01:14:31,883 --> 01:14:34,878
(Chuckles)

1451
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:38,181
Don't ever forget.

1452
01:14:38,483 --> 01:14:42,791
Always remember how much
you wanted to be loved,

1453
01:14:43,871 --> 01:14:46,870
and how much you are loved.

1454
01:14:46,871 --> 01:14:49,861
And I think if you can do that...
and it isn't easy...

1455
01:14:49,862 --> 01:14:54,816
you will stop looking
and realize

1456
01:14:54,817 --> 01:14:56,882
you already are happy.

1457
01:14:56,883 --> 01:14:59,874
To Renee and Ben,

1458
01:14:59,875 --> 01:15:01,882
and to remembering. (Chuckles)

1459
01:15:01,883 --> 01:15:04,858

the four of us staying here,
growing old together.

01:19:31,988 --> 01:19:33,949
Of course she has.

1536
01:19:33,950 --> 01:19:35,961
No, seriously,

1537
01:19:35,962 --> 01:19:39,652
I'm gonna miss <i>this </i>so much.

1538
01:19:40,252 --> 01:19:42,239
I'm gonna miss <i>us.</i>

1539
01:19:43,754 --> 01:19:45,728
It's funny.

1540
01:19:46,298 --> 01:19:49,425
Some people never get to know
the folks next door.

1541
01:19:49,462 --> 01:19:52,503
They share a fence
and nothing else.

1542
01:19:52,967 --> 01:19:54,988
And we've shared everything.

1543
01:19:57,287 --> 01:19:59,345
(Sighs) How did we get to be
so lucky?

1544
01:19:59,971 --> 01:20:03,987
I am so crazy nuts
about you guys.

1545
01:20:03,988 --> 01:20:05,991
Promise me
this is not the last time

1546
01:20:05,992 --> 01:20:07,966
we're gonna
play poker together.

1547
01:20:07,967 --> 01:20:09,209
Absolutely not.

1548
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:11,962
- We'll just have to make the time.
- Of course we will.

1549
01:20:14,983 --> 01:20:18,949
<i>It was a promise made
in all sincerity,</i>

1550
01:20:18,950 --> 01:20:21,967
<i>but sadly,
it was not meant to be.</i>

1551
01:20:23,954 --> 01:20:28,971
<i>Lynette and Tom Scavo
left the Lane four weeks later.</i>

1552
01:20:30,971 --> 01:20:32,953
<i>They moved to New York,</i>

1553
01:20:32,954 --> 01:20:36,913
<i>where Lynette learned
the joy of being a C.E.O.</i>

1554
01:20:37,607 --> 01:20:41,950
<i>She and Tom soon bought a penthouse
overlooking Central Park...</i>

1555
01:20:43,748 --> 01:20:47,343
<i>Where, years later, she'd take
her six grandchildren</i>

1556
01:20:47,362 --> 01:20:49,345
<i>and yell at them.</i>

1557
01:20:52,465 --> 01:20:54,228
<i>Gabrielle and Carlos Solis</i>

1558
01:20:54,260 --> 01:20:57,526
<i>left the neighborhood
the following year.</i>

1559
01:20:57,933 --> 01:21:00,941
<i>This was after Carlos
helped her develop</i>

1560
01:21:00,942 --> 01:21:03,473
<i>a personal shopping web site,</i>

1561
01:21:03,954 --> 01:21:06,949
<i>which led to Gabrielle
getting her own show</i>

1562
01:21:06,950 --> 01:21:09,603
<i>on the home shopping network.</i>

1563
01:21:09,610 --> 01:21:11,974
<i>They soon bought a mansion
in California,</i>

1564
01:21:11,975 --> 01:21:15,801
<i>where they argued
happily ever after.</i>

1565
01:21:18,292 --> 01:21:19,962
<i>Two years later,</i>

1566
01:21:19,963 --> 01:21:23,966
<i>Bree and her new husband
left Fairview.</i>

1567
01:21:24,260 --> 01:21:26,242
<i>They moved to Louisville,</i>

1568
01:21:26,262 --> 01:21:29,970
<i>where Bree joined a club
for conservative women.</i>

1569
01:21:31,180 --> 01:21:35,506
<i>Trip then encouraged her
to enter into local politics.</i>

1570
01:21:36,550 --> 01:21:38,497
<i>The following November,</i>

1571
01:21:38,541 --> 01:21:42,354
<i>Bree was elected to
the Kentucky state legislature.</i>

1572
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:47,957
<i>But Susan Delfino</i>

1573
01:21:47,958 --> 01:21:50,978
<i>was the first to move
from Wisteria Lane.</i>

1574
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:53,991
<i>And this is how it ended.</i>

1575
01:21:53,992 --> 01:21:56,546
<i>She introduced herself</i>

1576
01:21:56,571 --> 01:21:59,128
<i>to the woman
who was moving in.</i>

1577
01:21:59,917 --> 01:22:02,632
- You must be Jennifer.
- And you must be Susan.

1578
01:22:02,670 --> 01:22:05,719
- (Chuckles) Nice to meet you.
- Sorry if I'm early.

1579
01:22:05,732 --> 01:22:07,933
I, uh, made better time
than I thought I would.

1580
01:22:07,934 --> 01:22:09,949
We were just about to leave.

1581
01:22:09,950 --> 01:22:11,899
My house is your house.

1582
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:12,920
(Both laugh)

1583
01:22:12,921 --> 01:22:15,483
I mean, legally,
this is your house.

1584
01:22:16,712 --> 01:22:18,661
(Sighs) Ahh.

1585
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:19,966
(Laughs)

1586
01:22:19,967 --> 01:22:22,945
Hey, I hope
that you'll be happy here.

1587
01:22:22,946 --> 01:22:26,553
Thanks. Steve's so excited
to finally live in the suburbs.

1588
01:22:26,584 --> 01:22:28,712
I'm a little worried
it's going to be boring.

1589
01:22:28,733 --> 01:22:30,766
Oh, I wouldn't worry
about that.

1590
01:22:30,967 --> 01:22:32,995
Now this street is
a lot of things.

1591
01:22:32,996 --> 01:22:35,958
- Boring is not one of them.
- (Laughs)

1592
01:22:39,908 --> 01:22:42,945
(Sighs)

1593
01:22:42,946 --> 01:22:45,958
- Can we go now?
- Yeah, we're going.

1594
01:22:45,959 --> 01:22:47,916
(Seat belt clicks)

1595
01:22:47,917 --> 01:22:48,975
(Starts engine)

1596
01:22:48,976 --> 01:22:50,975
(Sighs)

1597
01:22:52,946 --> 01:22:56,916
Hey, do you guys mind if I take
one last spin around the block?

1598
01:22:56,917 --> 01:22:58,970
Go for it.

1599
01:22:58,971 --> 01:23:02,941
(Shifts gears)

1600
01:23:02,942 --> 01:23:04,949
<i>As Susan left her driveway,</i>

1601
01:23:04,950 --> 01:23:08,974
<i>she had a feeling
she was being watched...</i>

1602
01:23:08,975 --> 01:23:11,970
<i>And she was.</i>

1603
01:23:11,971 --> 01:23:15,953
<i>The ghosts of people who had
been a part of Wisteria Lane</i>

1604
01:23:15,954 --> 01:23:18,961
<i>were gazing upon her
as she passed.</i>

1605
01:23:18,962 --> 01:23:23,903
<i>They watched her,
as they watch everyone,</i>

1606
01:23:23,904 --> 01:23:25,991
<i>always hoping
the living could learn</i>

1607
01:23:25,992 --> 01:23:28,991
<i>to put aside rage and sorrow,</i>

1608
01:23:28,992 --> 01:23:31,978
<i>bitterness and regret.</i>

1609
01:23:31,979 --> 01:23:35,920
<i>These ghosts watch,</i>

1610
01:23:35,921 --> 01:23:38,932
<i>wanting people to remember</i>

1611
01:23:38,933 --> 01:23:42,928
<i>that even
the most desperate life...</i>

1612
01:23:42,929 --> 01:23:48,526
<i>Is oh... so wonderful.</i>

1613
01:23:54,443 --> 01:23:59,831
<i>But only a lucky few realize
the gift they've been given.</i>

1614
01:24:01,768 --> 01:24:06,776
<i>Most people just go on
day after day,</i>

1615
01:24:06,971 --> 01:24:08,932
<i>trying in vain...</i>

1616
01:24:08,933 --> 01:24:11,921
<i>To keep secrets...</i>

1617
01:24:12,285 --> 01:24:15,649
<i>That will never stay hidden.</i>

1618
