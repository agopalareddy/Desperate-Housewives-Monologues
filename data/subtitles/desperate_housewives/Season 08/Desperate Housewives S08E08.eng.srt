1
00:00:00,169 --> 00:00:02,760
<i>Previously on...</i>

2
00:00:02,761 --> 00:00:05,183
<i>Detective Vance got aggressive...</i>

3
00:00:05,184 --> 00:00:06,691
Have you seen this man?

4
00:00:07,255 --> 00:00:08,677
<i>But Ben came to the rescue.</i>

5
00:00:08,678 --> 00:00:10,860
It's pretty hard to build
a case without a body.

6
00:00:10,861 --> 00:00:12,293
I'll take care of it.

7
00:00:12,967 --> 00:00:15,348
<i>And Mike got rid of the body.</i>

8
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,659
<i>But so many secrets led
to a falling-out...</i>

9
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,431
- We're done.
- Don't you think you're overreacting?

10
00:00:21,834 --> 00:00:23,236
I don't think she is.

11
00:00:24,554 --> 00:00:28,923
<i>And Susan expressed her anger
the only way she knew how.</i>

12
00:00:35,021 --> 00:00:36,746
<i>There is nothing more peaceful</i>

13
00:00:36,747 --> 00:00:40,062
<i>than the sounds of Wisteria lane at night.</i>

14
00:00:42,852 --> 00:00:46,311
<i>Whether it's the murmur of
a neighbor's television...</i>

15
00:00:49,343 --> 00:00:52,230
<i>the hum of the street lamps...</i>

16
00:00:55,714 --> 00:00:58,521
<i>or the songs of the night birds...</i>

17
00:01:01,025 --> 00:01:03,432
<i>Wisteria lane is so peaceful</i>

18
00:01:03,433 --> 00:01:06,217
<i>that even the slightest disturbance...</i>

19
00:01:07,238 --> 00:01:09,609
<i>can be very alarming.</i>

20
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:15,844
9-1-1.

21
00:01:15,845 --> 00:01:16,849
There's an intruder in my home.

22
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:20,058
I'm at 4355 Wisteria lane. Please hurry.

23
00:01:39,912 --> 00:01:41,115
Oh, my god.

24
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,463
Chuck.

25
00:01:43,945 --> 00:01:45,027
Hello, Bree.

26
00:01:46,987 --> 00:01:47,855
What are you doing here?

27
00:01:47,856 --> 00:01:48,962
I could have shot you.

28
00:01:48,963 --> 00:01:50,609
I heard your call over the radio.

29
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,118
When I got here,
the door was wide open, so...

30
00:01:56,792 --> 00:01:58,548
I'm just gonna have a look around.

31
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:02,371
If you don't mind putting
the gun in your pocket

32
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,519
while I do.

33
00:02:10,907 --> 00:02:12,810
So tell me again what you heard.

34
00:02:13,164 --> 00:02:17,589
Um, a loud bang and then some footsteps,

35
00:02:17,948 --> 00:02:21,293
like, um, like someone
had forced their way in.

36
00:02:21,874 --> 00:02:22,492
Are you sure you didn't

37
00:02:22,493 --> 00:02:24,527
accidentally leave the door open?

38
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,503
I'm positive I locked it.

39
00:02:26,522 --> 00:02:28,934
Well, I don't know what to tell you.

40
00:02:29,692 --> 00:02:31,602
Maybe it was just some drifter
looking for a few bucks,

41
00:02:31,603 --> 00:02:32,602
and you scared him off.

44
00:02:36,207 --> 00:02:38,308
right out front a few months ago.

45
00:02:40,176 --> 00:02:42,244
The one who turned up as a missing person?

46
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:44,634
I told you, I don't remember
anything about that.

47
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:47,300
And yet you're positive
you locked your door

48
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:49,197
before you went to bed last night.

49
00:02:49,682 --> 00:02:52,239
It's funny, the things we remember

50
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:54,354
and the things we don't.

51
00:02:54,976 --> 00:02:56,482
Are you interrogating me?

52
00:02:56,483 --> 00:02:58,528
No, of course not.

53
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:00,423
You're a victim.

54
00:03:01,783 --> 00:03:03,278
And why would you say that?

55
00:03:03,279 --> 00:03:06,456
Because it's obvious to
me what's going on here.

56
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:08,918
Someone's sending you a message.

57
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:12,476
What kind of message?

58
00:03:12,477 --> 00:03:14,646
Maybe they think you're hiding something.

59
00:03:15,665 --> 00:03:18,029
Maybe they're trying to rattle you,

60
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:19,716
hoping you'll slip up.

61
00:03:20,595 --> 00:03:21,641
Or maybe they just don't want you

62
00:03:21,642 --> 00:03:23,692
to feel safe in your own home.

63
00:03:27,543 --> 00:03:30,219
<i>Yes, there's nothing more peaceful</i>

64
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,913
<i>than a night on Wisteria lane.</i>

65
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,879
But I wouldn't lose any
sleep over this, Bree.

66
00:03:36,606 --> 00:03:38,453
I'll be keeping an eye on you.

67
00:03:39,363 --> 00:03:41,704
<i>Until someone comes along...</i>

68
00:03:43,578 --> 00:03:59,924
<i>and disturbs the peace.</i>

69
00:03:59,925 --> 00:04:01,462
<i>In a stressful world,</i>

70
00:04:01,462 --> 00:04:05,635
<i>we can all be forgiven for
having a few weaknesses.</i>

71
00:04:07,027 --> 00:04:10,180
<i>Some of us are lured by a sweet treat...</i>

72
00:04:11,088 --> 00:04:14,274
<i>others, by a sad face.</i>

73
00:04:17,033 --> 00:04:21,037
<i>And still others,
by the pull of a great novel.</i>

74
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:26,436
<i>But Gabrielle Solis was about to discover</i>

75
00:04:26,437 --> 00:04:28,353
<i>that some weaknesses...</i>

76
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,821
Is he yours?

77
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:34,237
<i>Aren't so easy to forgive.</i>

78
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,126
Depends. Is he drunk?

79
00:04:37,127 --> 00:04:40,435
Unless he throws up in
cabs when he's sober?

80
00:04:42,058 --> 00:04:43,343
I'm so sorry.

81
00:04:43,718 --> 00:04:46,283
Here's 20 bucks for the ride

82
00:04:46,641 --> 00:04:48,979
and another 20 for your upholstery.

83
00:04:52,595 --> 00:04:53,909
This will make you feel better.

84
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,352
Oh, it smells like hot sauce.

85
00:04:55,353 --> 00:04:57,331
Yeah, it's a mexican hangover cure.

86
00:04:57,332 --> 00:04:58,975
It's the only thing
I inherited from my family

87
00:04:58,976 --> 00:05:00,873
that's actually worth anything.

88
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,235
I'm really sorry about all this.

89
00:05:07,076 --> 00:05:09,983
I thought it would get better
after Ben did what he did, but...

90
00:05:11,504 --> 00:05:12,495
it hasn't.

91
00:05:12,496 --> 00:05:14,271
Maybe we need to get you help,

92
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:16,042
like rehab or something.

93
00:05:16,536 --> 00:05:18,343
I'm not addicted, Gaby.

94
00:05:18,496 --> 00:05:21,232
It's just when I'm stressed,
this is what I do.

95
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:23,775
Really? You were stressed on
the golf course this morning?

96
00:05:24,269 --> 00:05:25,236
It was work,

97
00:05:25,237 --> 00:05:28,078
and there's always
drinking when it's work.

98
00:05:28,587 --> 00:05:29,905
We're golfing with a client... beer.

99
00:05:29,906 --> 00:05:31,388
We're hammering out a deal... wine.

100
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:33,272
We make the deal... champagne.

101
00:05:33,273 --> 00:05:36,272
Well, maybe you need to take
a little time away from work.

102
00:05:36,273 --> 00:05:38,384
Dry out. Kick-start your sobriety.

103
00:05:38,385 --> 00:05:41,650
I am the C.E.O. If I do that,
the whole place will fall apart.

104
00:05:41,651 --> 00:05:44,123
And if you don't, you'll fall apart.

105
00:05:46,685 --> 00:05:47,907
Maybe you're right.

106
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:51,735
But I can't do it today.
I got payroll to sign.

107
00:05:51,736 --> 00:05:53,902
But you're sweating bourbon.
You're not going anywhere.

108
00:05:53,903 --> 00:05:55,405
I'll go in and I'll sign it for you.

109
00:05:55,406 --> 00:05:56,569
You can't sign my name.

110
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,839
Oh, please, I forge your
signature all the time.

111
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,076
How else do you think
I got that platinum card?

112
00:06:02,921 --> 00:06:03,981
Wow, I must be in bad shape.

113
00:06:03,982 --> 00:06:05,613
I don't even have the energy to get mad.

114
00:06:05,614 --> 00:06:07,693
Well, with any luck,
you'll forget I said it.

115
00:06:12,078 --> 00:06:12,954
I'm sure some of you feel

116
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:15,693
I've been too hard on you
these past few weeks.

117
00:06:15,694 --> 00:06:19,240
I think I speak for all of
us when I say "All of us."

118
00:06:19,241 --> 00:06:21,601
Well, after today,
you will long for the mother's milk

119
00:06:21,602 --> 00:06:23,509
that has been my criticism.

120
00:06:23,701 --> 00:06:26,514
Please meet our special guest,
my art dealer

121
00:06:26,627 --> 00:06:28,700
and the owner of the Bergman gallery...

122
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:30,756
Felix Bergman.

123
00:06:33,428 --> 00:06:36,295
I smell fear and mediocrity.

124
00:06:37,031 --> 00:06:37,824
Oh, god.

125
00:06:37,825 --> 00:06:41,121
It's like someone left Andre
in the dryer too long.

126
00:06:41,764 --> 00:06:43,832
Felix has agreed to evaluate your work,

127
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,020
give honest feedback,

128
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:47,469
and teach you the business of art.

129
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,980
So... what do you call this piece?

130
00:06:49,981 --> 00:06:52,852
"A celebration of the female nude."

131
00:06:53,715 --> 00:06:55,928
This is why I don't sleep with women.

132
00:06:55,929 --> 00:06:57,616
It's repulsive.

133
00:06:57,622 --> 00:06:59,087
Well, it's not a literal...

134
00:06:59,088 --> 00:07:02,786
Mind drifting, eyelids drooping, and...

135
00:07:02,787 --> 00:07:04,203
I'm gone.

136
00:07:04,433 --> 00:07:07,900
He's not a critic.
He's a little ball of hate.

137
00:07:08,234 --> 00:07:09,156
Oh, god.

138
00:07:09,157 --> 00:07:11,693
No art student's portfolio
would be complete

139
00:07:11,694 --> 00:07:15,392
without the obligatory squares
and circles colliding,

140
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:19,346
or what I like to call
man's inhumanity to art.

141
00:07:19,495 --> 00:07:21,864
Well, Amy's one of my
most promising students.

142
00:07:21,865 --> 00:07:26,001
I find her work to be bold,
defiant, and dazzlingly layered.

143
00:07:26,002 --> 00:07:28,805
You're shtupping her, aren't you?

144
00:07:30,288 --> 00:07:32,790
Regardless, I just think that
there's a place for her work.

145
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:36,044
I think you may be right.

146
00:07:37,811 --> 00:07:39,294
Found it.

147
00:07:42,247 --> 00:07:45,176
So... what do you have for me?

148
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:47,914
The same thing you have for us... contempt.

149
00:07:48,008 --> 00:07:50,418
- Excuse me?
- We get it.

150
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:54,076
You're a super sophisticated
art snob who hates everything.

151
00:07:54,321 --> 00:07:57,171
- Well, guess what? I'm not playing.
- Susan...

152
00:07:57,172 --> 00:07:59,378
No. I am not getting my teeth kicked in

153
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:02,159
just because your mother
didn't breast-feed you.

154
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,185
Go play your game with someone else.

155
00:08:07,805 --> 00:08:09,727
Look, if you wanna be
a professional artist,

156
00:08:09,728 --> 00:08:12,318
you need to develop a thick skin.

157
00:08:12,803 --> 00:08:14,513
Did you paint this?

158
00:08:17,473 --> 00:08:19,118
Yes, I did, and I have no interest

159
00:08:19,119 --> 00:08:20,763
in hearing what you think of it.

160
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,905
Well, that's too bad,
because I think it's brilliant.

161
00:08:24,222 --> 00:08:25,538
- Really?
- Really?

162
00:08:25,854 --> 00:08:27,096
It's original.

163
00:08:27,097 --> 00:08:29,482
Dark, brooding. It tells a story.

164
00:08:29,483 --> 00:08:31,328
I'm totally drawn in.

165
00:08:31,972 --> 00:08:33,946
Congratulations, Andre.

166
00:08:34,629 --> 00:08:37,472
I do believe you've struck artist.

167
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:40,874
Yeah, I suppose she shows promise.

168
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:42,879
She may amount to something one day.

169
00:08:42,896 --> 00:08:43,891
One day?

170
00:08:43,892 --> 00:08:45,878
This girl has arrived.

171
00:08:45,963 --> 00:08:49,273
In fact, she reminds me of a young... you.

172
00:08:52,373 --> 00:08:53,758
Now, now...

173
00:08:54,103 --> 00:08:57,107
where's that thick skin
you were crowing about?

174
00:09:00,693 --> 00:09:03,532
And for the den, Franklin
wants a southwestern look.

175
00:09:03,533 --> 00:09:06,426
You know, navajo rugs, red chili peppers,

176
00:09:06,427 --> 00:09:08,422
chairs made of horns.

177
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:10,808
Southwestern. Fun.

178
00:09:10,809 --> 00:09:14,493
And bound to come back in style
since it's been out so long.

179
00:09:14,494 --> 00:09:17,607
We can't wait to work with you, Cindy.

180
00:09:17,608 --> 00:09:20,437
Yes. All we need is a $5,000 deposit,

181
00:09:20,438 --> 00:09:22,761
and then I will saddle up,
mosey into town,

182
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:25,661
and rustle up that wagon wheel table.

183
00:09:25,662 --> 00:09:26,814
What's the date today?

184
00:09:26,815 --> 00:09:28,319
Oh, the 13th.

185
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:30,562
13th? No, can't be.

186
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:32,688
Yes. Why?

187
00:09:32,936 --> 00:09:37,206
It's my wedding anniversary. 22 years.

188
00:09:37,207 --> 00:09:41,146
Congratulations. 22 years.
What is that... copper? brass?

189
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:43,907
Separation, in my case.

190
00:09:43,908 --> 00:09:46,990
Oh. I'm sorry. I saw your ring,
and I just assumed that...

191
00:09:46,991 --> 00:09:49,186
Yeah. Still wearing it,

192
00:09:49,187 --> 00:09:52,596
- even though we're hanging on by a thread.
- You poor thing.

193
00:09:52,597 --> 00:09:55,618
Yes, we're all devastated.
Would you like a pen?

194
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:59,499
I remember what my mother said to me

195
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,746
on my wedding day.

196
00:10:00,747 --> 00:10:03,166
It's bad luck to get married on the 13th,

197
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:06,072
and for 21 years,
Tom and I have been laughing

198
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:08,050
about how wrong she was.

199
00:10:09,111 --> 00:10:10,309
Not this year.

200
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:13,641
Yeah, make it out Perry-Scavo designs.

201
00:10:13,642 --> 00:10:15,063
Well, don't give up, Lynette.

202
00:10:15,064 --> 00:10:16,485
It's never too late.

203
00:10:16,486 --> 00:10:19,302
Yeah. I think his girlfriend might disagree

204
00:10:19,303 --> 00:10:23,634
with you on that one...
His beautiful doctor girlfriend.

205
00:10:23,635 --> 00:10:25,900
That's P-E-R-R...

206
00:10:25,901 --> 00:10:27,289
Now you listen to me.

207
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:29,900
My Franklin and I almost
split up two years ago.

208
00:10:29,901 --> 00:10:31,611
He was getting bored, and I could see

209
00:10:31,612 --> 00:10:34,045
he was about to pronounce
our marriage dead,

210
00:10:34,046 --> 00:10:36,367
but then I said, "No."

211
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:37,714
"No"?

212
00:10:37,715 --> 00:10:39,471
"No." Splitting up wasn't an option.

213
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,352
I had waited too long to find this man.

214
00:10:41,353 --> 00:10:43,221
I wasn't going down without a fight.

215
00:10:43,222 --> 00:10:44,408
So what'd you do?

216
00:10:44,409 --> 00:10:45,986
I changed.

217
00:10:45,987 --> 00:10:48,141
I got a new 'do, new wardrobe.

218
00:10:48,258 --> 00:10:50,021
Franklin liked the new Cindy so much,

219
00:10:50,022 --> 00:10:51,773
he started to change, too.

220
00:10:51,774 --> 00:10:53,075
That's amazing.

221
00:10:53,076 --> 00:10:56,783
You know what? Just sign it.
We have a stamp.

222
00:10:57,829 --> 00:10:59,391
I will go to the tile yard

223
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:01,961
to see if they have those adobe shingles.

224
00:11:02,402 --> 00:11:04,091
You wanna check on the fabric?

225
00:11:05,106 --> 00:11:07,263
Do you think I fought enough?

226
00:11:08,646 --> 00:11:10,259
Lynette, you're taking marriage advice

227
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,694
from a woman who wants coyote sconces?

228
00:11:12,695 --> 00:11:15,708
I'm serious. Am I giving up
on my marriage too easily?

229
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:20,103
No! I think you knew when
it was time to call it quits.

230
00:11:20,341 --> 00:11:21,447
That's just it.

231
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:22,795
I'm quitting,

232
00:11:22,835 --> 00:11:25,346
instead of not taking "No" for an answer.

233
00:11:25,381 --> 00:11:27,300
Look, you and Tom tried to make it work,

234
00:11:27,301 --> 00:11:28,978
and you couldndn't.

235
00:11:29,713 --> 00:11:30,999
Now he's moved on.

236
00:11:31,767 --> 00:11:32,946
And you are an amazing woman

237
00:11:32,947 --> 00:11:35,055
with your whole life ahead of you.

238
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,033
So take off that wedding ring.

239
00:11:37,566 --> 00:11:38,828
Go live it.

240
00:11:47,468 --> 00:11:49,297
Hey, Gaby, do you have a minute?

241
00:11:49,612 --> 00:11:52,393
Oh. Now's not really a-a good time.

242
00:11:52,394 --> 00:11:53,373
Why don't we talk tomorrow?

243
00:11:53,374 --> 00:11:55,451
Oh, please. I don't know
who else to turn to.

244
00:11:55,452 --> 00:11:56,917
Susan won't return my phone calls,

245
00:11:56,918 --> 00:11:59,747
and when I went to Lynette's,
she pretended she wasn't home.

246
00:12:01,003 --> 00:12:02,672
Yeah. Okay.

247
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,316
How did things get so bad so quickly?

248
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:11,624
This morning, I was all set
to make food for poker night,

249
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:12,515
and then I remembered.

250
00:12:12,516 --> 00:12:13,988
No poker night.

251
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:17,135
I feel like I've lost the life I had.

252
00:12:17,841 --> 00:12:20,502
First, my family and now my friends.

253
00:12:20,503 --> 00:12:23,223
Who knows if Susan or Lynette
will ever speak to me again?

254
00:12:23,224 --> 00:12:25,628
They'll cool off once
they realize we're in the clear.

255
00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:27,383
What if we're not in the clear?

256
00:12:27,384 --> 00:12:28,359
What do you mean?

257
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,705
The body's 8 feet under dirt and concrete.

258
00:12:30,706 --> 00:12:32,241
No body, no crime.

259
00:12:32,242 --> 00:12:34,230
I know, but... well...

260
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,942
Chuck came by yesterday.

261
00:12:37,953 --> 00:12:40,362
Chuck? What did he want?

262
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,001
Oh. Hey.

263
00:12:45,028 --> 00:12:46,585
Babe, do we have any aspirin?

264
00:12:47,482 --> 00:12:48,523
Yeah.

265
00:12:49,804 --> 00:12:52,519
Um... are you feeling better?

266
00:12:57,967 --> 00:12:58,977
Is he...

267
00:13:00,224 --> 00:13:01,959
I thought he stopped drinking.

268
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:02,997
Me, too.

269
00:13:02,998 --> 00:13:05,174
Oh, Gaby, I'm so sorry.

270
00:13:05,561 --> 00:13:06,920
He keeps saying it's because of work,

271
00:13:06,921 --> 00:13:09,703
but I know it's the guilt
still eating away at him.

272
00:13:09,895 --> 00:13:12,131
I just don't understand
how drinking helps.

273
00:13:12,132 --> 00:13:13,056
I do.

274
00:13:13,057 --> 00:13:16,608
Sometimes a drink feels like
the only friend you have left.

275
00:13:16,609 --> 00:13:19,000
Well, I just thank god
this ordeal is behind us.

276
00:13:19,001 --> 00:13:20,730
We all need to move on.

277
00:13:22,311 --> 00:13:23,370
You're right.

278
00:13:23,654 --> 00:13:24,783
I'm gonna go.

279
00:13:26,126 --> 00:13:28,047
You never told me what Chuck wanted.

280
00:13:29,728 --> 00:13:31,733
Oh. Uh, what else?

281
00:13:31,734 --> 00:13:33,848
He wanted to get back together again.

282
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:36,317
Oh, god. Please tell me you said no.

283
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,093
Of course I did.

284
00:13:38,422 --> 00:13:39,739
Oh, and, Bree?

285
00:13:41,547 --> 00:13:43,779
Never think you lost me
as a friend, 'cause...

286
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:45,600
you're my rock.

287
00:13:56,855 --> 00:13:58,250
Oh! Hey, Marilyn.

288
00:13:58,278 --> 00:14:00,054
Oh, Mrs. Solis, thank god.

289
00:14:00,055 --> 00:14:01,100
I've been trying to reach Carlos,

290
00:14:01,101 --> 00:14:02,675
and it keeps going to voice mail.

291
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:04,634
Oh, it's okay. No need to bother Carlos.

292
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,108
I'm here to sign the payroll.

293
00:14:06,109 --> 00:14:07,838
This isn't about the payroll.

294
00:14:07,873 --> 00:14:10,233
Frank Sweeney,
one of our biggest clients...

295
00:14:10,234 --> 00:14:13,339
he's on his way here,
and he did not sound happy.

296
00:14:13,483 --> 00:14:14,698
I'm gonna try Carlos again.

297
00:14:14,699 --> 00:14:16,906
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait. I, uh...

298
00:14:17,061 --> 00:14:18,385
I don't wanna stress out Carlos.

299
00:14:18,386 --> 00:14:22,098
He's home with the flu. Besides, I'm here.

300
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:24,271
How does that help?

301
00:14:24,685 --> 00:14:25,946
I know Frank Sweeney.

302
00:14:25,947 --> 00:14:28,026
He grabbed my ass at the Christmas party.

303
00:14:28,605 --> 00:14:30,954
Actually, a lot of guys did.
That was a good party.

304
00:14:31,609 --> 00:14:33,162
Yes, it was.

305
00:14:34,228 --> 00:14:35,759
Leave this guy to me.

306
00:14:35,967 --> 00:14:38,117
I know I'm setting women's
lib back 20 years,

307
00:14:38,118 --> 00:14:39,849
but I can do this.

308
00:14:42,091 --> 00:14:43,659
So, Frank...

309
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,517
it's been forever.

310
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:47,777
When's the last time
we've seen each other?

311
00:14:47,997 --> 00:14:50,151
Uh... I'm not sure.

312
00:14:50,169 --> 00:14:51,462
I am.

313
00:14:52,172 --> 00:14:54,987
♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells ♪

314
00:14:54,988 --> 00:14:57,120
♪ Jingle all the way ♪

315
00:14:57,121 --> 00:15:00,449
I-is Carlos coming in?
I really need to speak with him.

316
00:15:00,605 --> 00:15:04,006
Well, aren't you all business?

317
00:15:04,007 --> 00:15:06,069
Ooh, and all muscle, too.

318
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:07,597
Does Carlos even know I'm here?

319
00:15:07,598 --> 00:15:10,562
I mean, if he doesn't take
an $80 million account seriously...

320
00:15:10,563 --> 00:15:13,589
No, no, of course he takes it seriously.

321
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:16,525
What are you doing?

322
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:17,645
In my modeling days,

323
00:15:17,646 --> 00:15:19,872
we called this "The money-maker."

324
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,471
Well, now it looks like a neck spasm.

325
00:15:23,676 --> 00:15:25,388
Look, where is Carlos?

326
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,061
I don't know what kind of
business he's running here,

327
00:15:27,062 --> 00:15:29,332
but if he thinks he can pawn
his clients off on his wife...

328
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:30,119
No, no, no, no.

329
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,770
We understand you've
been a little unhappy,

330
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,558
and we... want you to
know you've been heard.

331
00:15:36,996 --> 00:15:38,883
I haven't said anything yet.

332
00:15:40,871 --> 00:15:41,969
Knock, knock.

333
00:15:42,204 --> 00:15:44,934
Mr. Sweeney, sir.
Heard you were in the building.

334
00:15:44,935 --> 00:15:47,543
Just wanted to make sure you
were being taken care of.

335
00:15:47,897 --> 00:15:50,052
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.

336
00:15:50,053 --> 00:15:53,358
No, no, please, interrupt,
whoever you are.

337
00:15:53,596 --> 00:15:56,154
Geoffrey Mathers. Senior account manager.

338
00:15:56,477 --> 00:15:59,050
I understand you have some
concerns about the market.

339
00:15:59,051 --> 00:16:00,951
I do have three or four
real-world solutions

340
00:16:00,952 --> 00:16:03,114
to protect your money in this economy.

341
00:16:03,404 --> 00:16:05,098
That is, if you'd like to hear them.

342
00:16:05,116 --> 00:16:08,181
Actually, that's what
I came in to talk about today.

343
00:16:09,123 --> 00:16:10,678
Well, of course it is.

344
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:12,775
I was just getting to it.

345
00:16:13,149 --> 00:16:16,406
But, uh, seems like Geoffrey
here has a handle on things,

346
00:16:16,407 --> 00:16:19,151
so, please, join us, Geoffrey.

347
00:16:20,176 --> 00:16:21,530
Have a seat, sir.

348
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:25,457
So I noticed you aren't
using derivatives...

349
00:16:30,374 --> 00:16:33,269
That was fun. I like Felix.

350
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:35,224
I thought you were annoying
when you were cheerful,

351
00:16:35,225 --> 00:16:37,876
but this smugness is much worse.

352
00:16:37,877 --> 00:16:38,885
Oh, why would I be smug?

353
00:16:38,886 --> 00:16:41,913
Just because he called me the young you?

354
00:16:42,479 --> 00:16:47,628
Guess that makes you the,
uh... ooh, old you.

355
00:16:48,628 --> 00:16:49,852
He can be a touch theatrical.

356
00:16:49,853 --> 00:16:51,998
I wouldn't take his praise too seriously.

357
00:16:51,999 --> 00:16:53,341
Oh, I would.

358
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:56,911
I think this time I may have
laid it on a little too thin.

359
00:16:56,989 --> 00:16:59,361
I have not been this excited

360
00:16:59,362 --> 00:17:03,228
since I discovered Andre doing
caricatures at The Pier.

361
00:17:03,229 --> 00:17:04,649
They weren't caricatures.

362
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:07,274
They were images of
the american grotesque.

363
00:17:07,275 --> 00:17:10,951
Uh-huh, and if you bought two,
you got a free churro.

364
00:17:11,244 --> 00:17:13,895
I am not surprised
he didn't tell me about you.

365
00:17:13,896 --> 00:17:16,764
I'm sure he saw you in his rearview mirror

366
00:17:16,765 --> 00:17:19,705
gaining on him,
and it scared him to death.

367
00:17:20,438 --> 00:17:23,943
Why would a professional
like Andre be threatened by...

368
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:25,526
Oh, what did you call me?

369
00:17:25,749 --> 00:17:30,089
"A silly, bored housewife
unburdened by talent."

370
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,662
- You are a housewife?
- Mm.

371
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,229
I love it!

372
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:39,606
You're like a-a sexy,
suburban Georgia O'Keeffe...

373
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:43,022
without all the pesky vaginas.

374
00:17:43,033 --> 00:17:46,660
I can sell the heck out of
this story at my gallery.

375
00:17:48,824 --> 00:17:50,250
What? Uh, wait.

376
00:17:50,251 --> 00:17:52,577
You wanna show my painng in public?

377
00:17:52,578 --> 00:17:53,930
Welcome to the big time!

378
00:17:53,931 --> 00:17:56,719
No, no, no, no. That, uh,
no, that can't happen.

379
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,891
My dear, do you understand
what an opportunity this is?

380
00:17:59,892 --> 00:18:01,970
Hundreds of people will see your work.

381
00:18:01,971 --> 00:18:04,347
I'm sorry. I'm-I'm-I'm flattered,

382
00:18:04,348 --> 00:18:07,016
and, uh, thank you for your offer.

383
00:18:07,365 --> 00:18:09,645
Um, but I can't.

384
00:18:12,596 --> 00:18:13,940
Artists.

385
00:18:16,187 --> 00:18:17,737
My pleasure, Frank, and I'm serious.

386
00:18:17,738 --> 00:18:19,280
You call me anytime.

387
00:18:19,948 --> 00:18:21,936
Yeah, Frank, great talking to you.

388
00:18:25,743 --> 00:18:29,026
Ohh. Thank god you got here.

389
00:18:29,474 --> 00:18:31,654
I was 30 seconds away
from flashing him a boob.

390
00:18:31,655 --> 00:18:32,596
It was nothing.

391
00:18:32,597 --> 00:18:35,020
Carlos has done a lot
for me over the years.

392
00:18:36,113 --> 00:18:37,268
Is he okay?

393
00:18:38,397 --> 00:18:40,871
Yeah, yeah. He's just got the flu.

394
00:18:41,084 --> 00:18:42,083
Really?

395
00:18:42,084 --> 00:18:43,553
'Cause he usually comes running

396
00:18:43,554 --> 00:18:45,087
the second Sweeney pops into town,

397
00:18:45,088 --> 00:18:47,861
and I don't think
the flu would keep him away.

398
00:18:53,022 --> 00:18:54,375
Mrs. Solis...

399
00:18:54,704 --> 00:18:56,704
your husband has been like a father to me.

400
00:18:56,725 --> 00:18:58,449
I really wanna help if I can.

401
00:19:02,324 --> 00:19:03,327
Okay.

402
00:19:03,781 --> 00:19:05,586
He's been going through a rough time,

403
00:19:05,587 --> 00:19:08,951
and, well, he's been drinking a lot.

404
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,453
So he's gonna be staying home
for the next week or two,

405
00:19:11,454 --> 00:19:13,324
trying to pull himself together.

406
00:19:13,781 --> 00:19:16,803
That poor guy. Well, don't worry.

407
00:19:16,824 --> 00:19:18,387
You go home and you take care of him.

408
00:19:18,388 --> 00:19:19,980
I'll take care of things here.

409
00:19:20,158 --> 00:19:22,212
- Really?
- Just get him better.

410
00:19:22,325 --> 00:19:23,614
We need him back.

411
00:19:23,936 --> 00:19:25,108
Thank you.

412
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,444
You're a good kid. And you know what?

413
00:19:27,445 --> 00:19:29,728
I'm telling Carlos you deserve a raise.

414
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,178
Can you tell him when he's sober?

415
00:19:34,879 --> 00:19:36,990
Yeah. Yeah.

416
00:19:44,412 --> 00:19:45,252
Lynette Scavo?

417
00:19:45,253 --> 00:19:47,631
Yes. Wow. These are beautiful.

418
00:19:47,632 --> 00:19:48,944
Someone must be thinking of you.

419
00:19:48,945 --> 00:19:50,712
- Have a good one.
- Thanks.

420
00:19:58,505 --> 00:19:59,905
Who sent flowers?

421
00:20:02,014 --> 00:20:03,437
Just your aunt Renee.

422
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:04,740
That was nice.

423
00:20:04,741 --> 00:20:05,904
Right?

424
00:20:06,774 --> 00:20:09,688
A little unexpected, but very, very nice.

425
00:20:20,474 --> 00:20:22,956
Hey, honey, how was your day?

426
00:20:23,144 --> 00:20:25,121
Daytime TV sucks.

427
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:26,212
Just a bunch of women

428
00:20:26,213 --> 00:20:28,221
sitting around, talking about menopause

429
00:20:28,222 --> 00:20:29,700
and things they don't eat anymore.

430
00:20:29,701 --> 00:20:31,328
You did record that, right?

431
00:20:31,408 --> 00:20:32,706
Yes.

432
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,424
So how'd it go at the office?

433
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,424
Took you a long time to sign the payroll.

434
00:20:38,425 --> 00:20:39,390
Well, it wasn't just that.

435
00:20:39,391 --> 00:20:41,091
People were asking where you were.

436
00:20:41,639 --> 00:20:43,966
So what'd you say?
I told them you had the flu

437
00:20:43,967 --> 00:20:45,926
and you were very comfortable staying home

438
00:20:45,927 --> 00:20:48,622
because you had a great staff,
which you do, by the way.

439
00:20:48,623 --> 00:20:50,737
- Yeah, who'd you talk to?
- Bunch of people.

440
00:20:50,738 --> 00:20:53,184
Um, Steve, Marilyn, Geoffrey...

441
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:54,274
Geoffrey?

442
00:20:54,976 --> 00:20:56,118
Right.

443
00:20:56,358 --> 00:20:58,998
Guy probably started doing
cartwheels as soon as you left.

444
00:20:58,999 --> 00:21:00,685
What? Why would you say that?

445
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,225
He's a snake.

446
00:21:02,555 --> 00:21:05,862
Well, you mean like a... a nice snake.

447
00:21:05,898 --> 00:21:08,397
No, like a backstabber.

448
00:21:08,597 --> 00:21:10,429
His contract's up at the end of the month,

449
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:11,357
and I'm not keeping him on,

450
00:21:11,358 --> 00:21:13,445
so he's trying to poach
my biggest clients.

451
00:21:16,321 --> 00:21:18,735
Wow. What a day.

452
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:20,300
I really need a drink.

453
00:21:20,603 --> 00:21:21,583
Hon...

454
00:21:22,662 --> 00:21:25,194
You threw out all the booze
when I quit, remember?

455
00:21:25,195 --> 00:21:26,879
Oh, please, there's a bottle of chardonnay

456
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,547
in the tank of the guest toilet.

457
00:21:28,548 --> 00:21:30,189
It's like you don't know me at all.

458
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,523
Lynette, it's me!

459
00:21:38,524 --> 00:21:39,757
Come on in!

460
00:21:41,451 --> 00:21:42,683
♪ Ta-da ♪

461
00:21:43,092 --> 00:21:46,370
Oh, my god. Look at your hair!

462
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:47,569
Do you like it?

463
00:21:47,726 --> 00:21:49,817
- Is it permanent?
- No.

464
00:21:49,818 --> 00:21:51,644
Then I love it!

465
00:21:51,645 --> 00:21:52,838
Especially if it means

466
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:55,856
you're finally ready to put
yourself out there again.

467
00:21:55,857 --> 00:21:59,885
Not so much out there as...
back there... with Tom.

468
00:22:00,635 --> 00:22:02,145
Oh, Lynette.

469
00:22:02,146 --> 00:22:03,878
Stop it with that.

470
00:22:03,879 --> 00:22:05,245
He's moved on.

471
00:22:05,567 --> 00:22:08,811
Then why did he send me
flowers for our anniversary?

472
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:10,897
"Love always, Tom."

473
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:13,940
Well, I don't get it.
Isn't he seeing Jane?

474
00:22:14,118 --> 00:22:17,769
Yeah, but... maybe with
the anniversary coming up,

475
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,039
he started thinking about it

476
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,422
and... he wants to give it another try.

477
00:22:24,417 --> 00:22:25,749
What are you gonna do?

478
00:22:25,964 --> 00:22:29,384
Well, I got Penny's keys
to his apartment, and...

479
00:22:29,385 --> 00:22:31,521
Oh, I get it.

480
00:22:31,522 --> 00:22:33,721
He gets home. You meet him at the door

481
00:22:33,722 --> 00:22:36,901
wearing nothing but
whipped cream and a smile.

482
00:22:36,902 --> 00:22:40,826
No. I'm gonna put a bottle
of scotch on his nightstand.

483
00:22:40,827 --> 00:22:42,945
That is our anniversary thing.

484
00:22:42,946 --> 00:22:45,510
He sends me flowers, I give him scotch.

485
00:22:45,511 --> 00:22:47,458
Oh, now I get it.

486
00:22:47,459 --> 00:22:50,240
You get him all liquored up,
and then you undress him.

487
00:22:50,241 --> 00:22:52,213
No, Renee, no sex.

488
00:22:52,214 --> 00:22:53,841
Okay, I don't get it.

489
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:58,392
I was thinking maybe
he sees the outfit, the hair,

490
00:22:58,393 --> 00:23:01,149
and he realizes I've changed,

491
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:05,162
and then... maybe he wants to change, too.

492
00:23:05,983 --> 00:23:08,024
Are you sure that's what you want?

493
00:23:08,106 --> 00:23:10,414
All I know is we have been
walking away from each other

494
00:23:10,415 --> 00:23:12,652
since this thing started,
and this is the first time

495
00:23:12,653 --> 00:23:14,677
he's taken a step toward me.

496
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:18,237
I think I have to take a step, too.

497
00:23:18,629 --> 00:23:22,473
Well... you look... amazing.

498
00:23:22,712 --> 00:23:23,847
I hope it works.

499
00:23:23,848 --> 00:23:25,865
Thanks. I do, too.

500
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:27,313
And if it doesn't,

501
00:23:27,314 --> 00:23:30,331
I know this really hot thing you can do

502
00:23:30,332 --> 00:23:32,256
with a dinner mint and a feather.

503
00:23:32,257 --> 00:23:33,974
No sex.

504
00:23:34,065 --> 00:23:35,815
How are we even friends?

505
00:23:42,847 --> 00:23:44,079
You're an idiot.

506
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,320
And that's why
you're not getting any coffee.

507
00:23:48,835 --> 00:23:50,451
Susan, hanging your paintings in a gallery

508
00:23:50,452 --> 00:23:52,237
is a major opportunity.

509
00:23:52,811 --> 00:23:53,908
Listen to me.

510
00:23:54,371 --> 00:23:56,812
I consider myself a mentor to you.

511
00:23:56,845 --> 00:23:59,980
What? You have insulted and discouraged me

512
00:23:59,981 --> 00:24:01,631
since the day we met.

513
00:24:01,783 --> 00:24:03,667
What else does a mentor do?

514
00:24:05,182 --> 00:24:06,238
Okay, fine, you got me.

515
00:24:06,239 --> 00:24:08,555
I don't care about you. I care about me.

516
00:24:08,601 --> 00:24:10,123
You came over just to tell me that?

517
00:24:10,124 --> 00:24:11,840
I teach to support my painting.

518
00:24:11,841 --> 00:24:13,191
If one of my students does well,

519
00:24:13,192 --> 00:24:15,470
maybe I can teach at a better college,

520
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:16,792
like one that doesn't have a major

521
00:24:16,793 --> 00:24:18,651
in air conditioning repair.

522
00:24:18,652 --> 00:24:21,808
Look... if you taught me anything,

523
00:24:21,809 --> 00:24:24,242
it's that the only gallery that matters

524
00:24:24,334 --> 00:24:25,749
is the one in here.

525
00:24:26,837 --> 00:24:27,541
Was that a tuesday?

526
00:24:27,542 --> 00:24:29,954
Because I drink at lunch on tuesdays.

527
00:24:30,877 --> 00:24:34,159
I made those paintings for me,
and no matter what you say,

528
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,312
I'm not sharing them with anyone.

529
00:24:36,971 --> 00:24:38,088
You're scared.

530
00:24:38,986 --> 00:24:39,936
What?

531
00:24:39,972 --> 00:24:41,588
You're afraid of being judged.

532
00:24:44,447 --> 00:24:45,484
Yep.

533
00:24:45,983 --> 00:24:47,104
You're right.

534
00:24:47,879 --> 00:24:49,989
I'm a big, old scaredy cat,

535
00:24:50,042 --> 00:24:51,881
fear of rejection, never felt good enough,

536
00:24:51,882 --> 00:24:53,098
blah, blah, blah.

537
00:24:53,484 --> 00:24:56,234
Happy? Bye-bye.

538
00:25:05,256 --> 00:25:07,340
So did you get me the paintings?

539
00:25:07,341 --> 00:25:09,151
No, she still won't do it.

540
00:25:09,662 --> 00:25:11,367
But you know what they say.

541
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:14,713
Some are born great.
Some achieve greatness,

542
00:25:14,714 --> 00:25:17,112
and others have greatness
thrust upon them.

543
00:25:18,246 --> 00:25:20,484
Looks like it's time to start thrusting.

544
00:25:33,581 --> 00:25:36,411
If you're spying on me,
you're not very good at it.

545
00:25:37,056 --> 00:25:39,014
Oh, I thought I was pretty
good when I followed you

546
00:25:39,015 --> 00:25:40,541
to the gardening store on Euclid.

547
00:25:40,542 --> 00:25:42,861
And that stop you made for frozen yogurt...

548
00:25:43,202 --> 00:25:44,165
our little secret.

549
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,225
Isn't stalking illegal?

550
00:25:47,668 --> 00:25:49,824
We cops like to call it surveillance.

551
00:25:52,272 --> 00:25:54,673
Stay. I'm not done with you.

552
00:25:57,996 --> 00:26:01,999
This guy... the one you say
you don't remember seeing.

553
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:04,366
You think you might
remember seeing his car?

554
00:26:04,367 --> 00:26:05,751
- His car?
- Yeah.

555
00:26:06,123 --> 00:26:07,887
A silver ford focus,

556
00:26:07,888 --> 00:26:09,733
just like the one you and Gaby

557
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:12,382
were dropping back to her aunt Shirley

558
00:26:12,793 --> 00:26:14,207
The day I pulled you over.

559
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:15,271
What are the odds?

560
00:26:15,272 --> 00:26:17,547
I'm sure it's just a coincidence.

561
00:26:17,548 --> 00:26:19,158
You wanna hear another coincidence?

562
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:21,586
The missing guy's from Oklahoma city.

563
00:26:22,642 --> 00:26:27,359
Wasn't Gaby's aunt a big fan
of the Oklahoma city RedHawks?

564
00:26:28,282 --> 00:26:29,897
I don't know what personality deficiency

565
00:26:29,898 --> 00:26:32,156
causes you to act this way,
but I feel compelled

566
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:35,578
to inform you how utterly
unattractive it makes you.

567
00:26:35,579 --> 00:26:37,706
Fine. You don't wanna answer my questions?

568
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,033
Maybe Gaby does.

569
00:26:40,344 --> 00:26:42,974
You leave Gaby out of this.
Carlos has been sick.

570
00:26:42,975 --> 00:26:44,589
She has her hands full.

571
00:26:46,958 --> 00:26:48,654
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.

572
00:26:48,655 --> 00:26:50,810
Well, I'm patient.

573
00:26:50,811 --> 00:26:52,325
I can talk to her later.

574
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,113
Bree...

575
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:57,272
I've been a cop for a long time,

576
00:26:57,741 --> 00:27:01,236
and I can always feel when
I'm getting close to the truth.

577
00:27:01,237 --> 00:27:02,966
You wanna hear a wild guess?

578
00:27:02,967 --> 00:27:04,735
If it would allow me
to get on with my day,

579
00:27:04,736 --> 00:27:05,679
I would be delighted.

580
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,445
Something happened with this guy...

581
00:27:07,747 --> 00:27:09,894
something bad and permanent.

582
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,918
Now I don't think you did it,

583
00:27:14,812 --> 00:27:16,579
but I think you know who did.

584
00:27:17,813 --> 00:27:19,378
It's probably one of your friends,

585
00:27:20,456 --> 00:27:24,097
and you, being Bree, are protecting them.

586
00:27:24,791 --> 00:27:26,406
I do protect my friends,

587
00:27:27,191 --> 00:27:29,709
and I would do anything
for them... anything.

588
00:27:30,021 --> 00:27:32,067
They're the one thing in
my life that have never failed me,

589
00:27:32,068 --> 00:27:34,554
and I will never fail them.

590
00:27:34,955 --> 00:27:37,895
And against that, you are powerless.

591
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:41,463
Now I am tired of your little
guesses and your games,

592
00:27:41,464 --> 00:27:43,120
so if you wanna charge me with something,

593
00:27:43,121 --> 00:27:44,986
I suggest you take out your cuffs.

594
00:27:45,327 --> 00:27:48,659
If not, you get the hell off my street.

595
00:28:17,631 --> 00:28:19,215
You scum!

596
00:28:20,201 --> 00:28:22,317
Oh, not you, Mr. Sweeney.
Good to see you again.

597
00:28:22,318 --> 00:28:23,289
Mrs. Solis...

598
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:25,028
We're sort of in the middle
of something here.

599
00:28:25,028 --> 00:28:25,610
Yeah, I know.

600
00:28:25,612 --> 00:28:27,656
You're in the middle of
stealing my husband's client

601
00:28:27,657 --> 00:28:29,841
while sitting at
his desk in front of a photo

602
00:28:29,842 --> 00:28:31,788
of his wife and kids.

603
00:28:33,655 --> 00:28:34,999
Wait a minute. That's not me.

604
00:28:35,401 --> 00:28:38,350
That's me and my girlfriend...
in Belize...

605
00:28:38,351 --> 00:28:39,706
with our dog.

606
00:28:39,707 --> 00:28:43,289
What kind of man puts his
photos on another man's desk?!

607
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:45,322
Or takes his dog to Belize?

608
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:46,656
I'll tell you what kind of man...

609
00:28:46,657 --> 00:28:48,312
the kind that shows up for meetings,

610
00:28:48,313 --> 00:28:49,778
unlike your husband.

611
00:28:51,123 --> 00:28:53,360
I told you, he's got the flu.

612
00:28:53,812 --> 00:28:57,000
Gaby, I think Mr. Sweeney
deserves to know the truth.

613
00:29:00,986 --> 00:29:03,033
Fine. I'll tell him.

614
00:29:03,476 --> 00:29:04,881
Carlos is a drunk.

615
00:29:04,882 --> 00:29:06,833
He isn't here because he drinks too much

616
00:29:06,834 --> 00:29:08,684
and he's unable to perform
the responsibilities

617
00:29:08,685 --> 00:29:10,049
that come with the job.

618
00:29:10,571 --> 00:29:11,573
You know what?

619
00:29:11,574 --> 00:29:14,428
Carlos will get sober,
but you will always be

620
00:29:14,429 --> 00:29:16,978
just a... lowlife son of a bitch.

621
00:29:17,328 --> 00:29:18,432
Is this true?

622
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:21,603
Yeah.

623
00:29:21,604 --> 00:29:24,495
I need to speak to him... right now.

624
00:29:32,554 --> 00:29:34,098
Carlos, Carlos, wake up.

625
00:29:34,099 --> 00:29:35,151
Wake up!

626
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:39,056
Mm, babe, I was just dreaming about you.

627
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:41,314
You were wearing that little black number.

628
00:29:41,315 --> 00:29:43,944
Carlos! Mr. Sweeney's here.

629
00:29:44,357 --> 00:29:45,208
What?

630
00:29:45,209 --> 00:29:46,464
Hello, Carlos.

631
00:29:46,833 --> 00:29:48,111
Mr. Sweeney.

632
00:29:48,112 --> 00:29:49,495
Mr. Sweeney...

633
00:29:49,966 --> 00:29:51,329
- Yeah.
- In our house.

634
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:54,001
And I'm in pajamas, covered in chips.

635
00:29:54,491 --> 00:29:56,006
He knows what's going on.

636
00:29:57,642 --> 00:29:58,776
I'm sorry.

637
00:30:02,185 --> 00:30:05,319
Um... look, I am, uh, really sorry.

638
00:30:06,934 --> 00:30:09,313
I had a rough couple days,

639
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:13,377
but I'm fine now. You can count on me.

640
00:30:14,361 --> 00:30:15,684
You see this?

641
00:30:16,463 --> 00:30:18,379
14 years sober.

642
00:30:19,172 --> 00:30:21,147
But there was a time when I was standing

643
00:30:21,148 --> 00:30:22,743
right where you're standing.

644
00:30:23,216 --> 00:30:24,490
The only thing that got me back together

645
00:30:24,491 --> 00:30:27,802
was admitting I had a
problem and going to rehab.

646
00:30:28,194 --> 00:30:30,378
No, uh, that's not where I am.

647
00:30:30,379 --> 00:30:31,473
I mean...

648
00:30:32,948 --> 00:30:35,776
I know it looks bad,
but trust me, I'm fine.

649
00:30:36,549 --> 00:30:38,816
Hmm, well, you can tell yourself that.

650
00:30:39,849 --> 00:30:41,826
But it's time for you to make a choice.

651
00:30:42,228 --> 00:30:44,366
Either throw away everything
you've worked for,

652
00:30:44,367 --> 00:30:45,750
including your family,

653
00:30:46,101 --> 00:30:48,378
or take back control of your life.

654
00:30:50,266 --> 00:30:52,032
Honey, I think you should go.

655
00:30:52,033 --> 00:30:54,340
I know a great place... the place I went.

656
00:30:54,864 --> 00:30:57,874
I can call tomorrow and get
everything set up for you.

657
00:31:04,145 --> 00:31:05,882
It's gonna be okay, sweetie.

658
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:44,007
I'm sorry. That waiter was
totally flirting with you.

659
00:31:44,008 --> 00:31:45,259
He was not.

660
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:48,042
Oh, please, he kept asking
you how your potato was.

661
00:31:48,043 --> 00:31:52,456
I mean, look, it's a potato.
How many ways can it go wrong?

662
00:31:54,201 --> 00:31:55,785
Jared was just being attentive.

663
00:31:55,786 --> 00:31:57,300
Oh, oh, now it's Jared.

664
00:31:57,301 --> 00:31:59,939
I didn't realize you two
were on a first-name basis.

665
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,476
You know what?

666
00:32:01,866 --> 00:32:04,094
- I like seeing you jealous.
- I'm not jealous.

667
00:32:04,095 --> 00:32:05,413
He just spent so much time at our table,

668
00:32:05,414 --> 00:32:07,147
he should have split the bill with me.

669
00:32:07,148 --> 00:32:08,462
Jealous...

670
00:32:08,914 --> 00:32:12,888
Nah. Jared only got to bring you a potato.

671
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:14,340
I...

672
00:32:16,507 --> 00:32:18,172
got to bring you home.

673
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:22,101
Oh, stop! Stop! Stop,
stop, stop! I'm here!

674
00:32:22,102 --> 00:32:23,879
- Oh, my god.
- Lynette! What the hell?

675
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,388
- Oh, my god!
- I'm sorry!

676
00:32:25,389 --> 00:32:27,892
- What is she doing here?
- Yeah, what are you doing here?

677
00:32:27,893 --> 00:32:29,518
I didn't... I didn't think... I wasn't...

678
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:30,756
I think she's on a bender.

679
00:32:30,757 --> 00:32:32,332
No, no! I just...

680
00:32:32,733 --> 00:32:34,379
What? You just what?

681
00:32:41,103 --> 00:32:42,196
Okay.

682
00:32:44,202 --> 00:32:47,032
Why don't I give you guys some privacy?

683
00:32:47,403 --> 00:32:49,298
As ironic as that sounds right now.

684
00:32:51,275 --> 00:32:52,459
I'll be at Chloe's.

685
00:32:56,856 --> 00:33:00,328
Please tell me this is
the first time you have done this.

686
00:33:01,211 --> 00:33:05,506
I just wanted to bring you
your scotch, you know?

687
00:33:05,796 --> 00:33:07,331
For our anniversary.

688
00:33:07,973 --> 00:33:08,817
Anniversary?

689
00:33:08,818 --> 00:33:13,022
Yes. I got the flowers you sent me.

690
00:33:13,836 --> 00:33:14,928
Oh, my god.

691
00:33:14,929 --> 00:33:16,124
What?

692
00:33:19,816 --> 00:33:24,593
You... remember 12 years ago
when I forgot our anniversary?

693
00:33:25,216 --> 00:33:25,983
I felt so awful,

694
00:33:25,984 --> 00:33:28,433
I placed a standing order at the florist.

695
00:33:30,601 --> 00:33:33,079
I wanted to make sure you
got flowers every year.

696
00:33:34,583 --> 00:33:36,664
- Oh, god.
- I'm so sorry.

697
00:33:36,665 --> 00:33:39,523
No. No. Honest mistake.

698
00:33:39,524 --> 00:33:41,605
It w-will never happen again.

699
00:33:41,606 --> 00:33:43,642
I am canceling it first thing tomorrow.

700
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,274
Okay.

701
00:33:51,991 --> 00:33:53,506
I'm going to go.

702
00:33:59,598 --> 00:34:00,569
Lynette?

703
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,596
Your hair looks nice.

704
00:34:08,268 --> 00:34:09,317
Thank you.

705
00:34:22,814 --> 00:34:23,648
You made it.

706
00:34:23,649 --> 00:34:26,271
Oh, Felix was nice enough
to invite me to the opening.

707
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:27,736
It's the least I could do.

708
00:34:28,388 --> 00:34:29,924
Susan, that's art.

709
00:34:32,924 --> 00:34:33,887
Sorry.

710
00:34:38,736 --> 00:34:39,832
There's a lot of people here.

711
00:34:39,833 --> 00:34:41,952
Yep. And before the night's over,

712
00:34:41,953 --> 00:34:44,543
I believe they'll all
be talking about you.

713
00:34:45,517 --> 00:34:46,640
What?

714
00:34:47,011 --> 00:34:48,295
I did something,

715
00:34:48,939 --> 00:34:50,565
and you're gonna thank me for it.

716
00:34:53,112 --> 00:34:54,021
Oh, my god.

717
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:59,148
Oh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my god.

718
00:34:59,149 --> 00:35:00,203
You're welcome.

719
00:35:01,418 --> 00:35:02,880
What did you do?

720
00:35:03,794 --> 00:35:05,785
Well, you seemed so terrified
about displaying your work.

721
00:35:05,786 --> 00:35:08,555
I figured I'd rip off
the band-aid for you.

722
00:35:09,246 --> 00:35:11,745
And see? You're a hit.

723
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:14,847
Don't forget who made you.

724
00:35:28,703 --> 00:35:30,621
Sweetie, can I help you?

725
00:35:31,232 --> 00:35:33,821
Nope. Don't mind me. I'm just...

726
00:35:34,554 --> 00:35:36,310
adjusting the...

727
00:35:41,188 --> 00:35:43,510
That is really stuck on good, huh?

728
00:35:43,511 --> 00:35:44,673
What are you doing?

729
00:35:44,674 --> 00:35:46,918
Andre submitted these without my consent.

730
00:35:46,919 --> 00:35:49,466
They were meant to be private.
I really want them back.

731
00:35:49,467 --> 00:35:52,597
Oh, jeez! How many screws
have you got in there?

732
00:35:52,598 --> 00:35:53,619
Stop it!

733
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:56,865
The only way they're coming
down is if somebody buys them.

734
00:35:59,161 --> 00:36:01,923
Felix, please, please give them back.

735
00:36:01,924 --> 00:36:04,182
No one can see these!

736
00:36:08,015 --> 00:36:09,992
Oh, you are clever.

737
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:13,990
Creating a scene like a crazy artist.

738
00:36:14,411 --> 00:36:16,718
There is not a person in this room

739
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:18,675
who isn't looking this way.

740
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:19,425
You're a genius.

741
00:36:19,426 --> 00:36:21,896
No! No, I'm not a genius. I swear.

742
00:36:21,897 --> 00:36:23,438
I just need the paintings!

743
00:36:23,439 --> 00:36:24,867
Keep it up. Keep it up.

744
00:36:24,868 --> 00:36:27,011
I'm gonna grab the photographer
from the "Sentinel."

745
00:36:27,012 --> 00:36:28,497
The crazier, the better.

746
00:36:28,838 --> 00:36:31,471
Oh, her mind has snapped. Oh!

747
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:39,819
Stupid art!

748
00:36:52,052 --> 00:36:54,686
Bree, it's Susan. I know
we're not talking right now,

749
00:36:54,687 --> 00:36:56,866
but I really need you... and Gaby..

750
00:36:57,178 --> 00:36:58,433
and your checkbooks.

751
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:03,589
Susan, this isn't art.
It's an illustrated confession!

752
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:05,070
It's like a kid's book.

753
00:37:05,071 --> 00:37:07,190
"Meet Dick and Jane. See Jane kill Dick."

754
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:09,308
"See Jane bury Dick. Run, Jane, run!"

755
00:37:09,659 --> 00:37:10,757
Oh, I swear I didn't know.

756
00:37:10,758 --> 00:37:13,136
He just took them out of
the classroom and put them up.

757
00:37:13,137 --> 00:37:14,872
Well, we have to get
them down immediately.

758
00:37:14,873 --> 00:37:17,668
Hello, ladies. Are you enjoying the art?

759
00:37:17,669 --> 00:37:19,866
Yes, so much so, that we would like to buy

760
00:37:20,096 --> 00:37:21,728
this whole series of paintings.

761
00:37:21,729 --> 00:37:23,586
- And take them home with us.
- Immediately.

762
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:25,899
Uh, ordinarily, I would place

763
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:28,322
a-a sticker on the work that says "Sold,"

764
00:37:28,323 --> 00:37:30,706
and then I would contact
you when the show's over.

765
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:32,608
Yeah, well, you heard the lady.
We gotta have these paintings,

766
00:37:32,609 --> 00:37:34,324
and we gotta have 'em now. So how much?

767
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,947
Well... oh. Well, if you're
gonna buy the whole series,

768
00:37:36,948 --> 00:37:39,479
I suppose I can trim
a little off the price.

769
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,707
$10,000 should cover it.

770
00:37:41,708 --> 00:37:43,623
$10,000 for my art?

771
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:46,663
I mean, seems a little steep.

772
00:37:46,985 --> 00:37:49,958
Yeah. She painted my kids
a mural of monkeys playing soccer

773
00:37:49,959 --> 00:37:51,262
for a bottle of wine.

774
00:37:52,828 --> 00:37:54,030
Fine. We'll take 'em.

775
00:37:54,385 --> 00:37:56,703
Congratulations, Mrs. Delfino.

776
00:37:56,704 --> 00:37:59,092
You are officially sold out,

777
00:37:59,093 --> 00:38:01,898
thanks to this lovely lesbian couple.

778
00:38:01,899 --> 00:38:04,005
- Oh, we're not...
- You know what? This is not the time.

779
00:38:04,808 --> 00:38:07,125
Oh, we'll start pulling the pieces down.

780
00:38:08,612 --> 00:38:09,705
I'm so sorry.

781
00:38:09,706 --> 00:38:11,641
Tomorrow I'm back to
monkeys and squirrels.

782
00:38:12,366 --> 00:38:13,693
You bought these?

783
00:38:13,694 --> 00:38:16,224
Yep. They're ours, so stop looking at 'em.

784
00:38:16,663 --> 00:38:18,199
You really have a good eye.

785
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,697
Yes. They're so powerful.

786
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:23,275
It's clearly an allegory
for the bludgeoning

787
00:38:23,276 --> 00:38:26,086
and burying of the middle
class in this country.

788
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,149
Oh, I don't know.

789
00:38:29,493 --> 00:38:33,860
All I see is four women who
killed a guy with a candlestick

790
00:38:34,212 --> 00:38:36,177
and dumped his body in the woods.

791
00:38:37,825 --> 00:38:39,009
But then again...

792
00:38:39,742 --> 00:38:41,366
what do I know about art?

793
00:38:47,584 --> 00:38:49,150
Chuck, you followed me here?

794
00:38:49,643 --> 00:38:50,859
Why would he be following you?

795
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:51,711
Yeah, what's going on?

796
00:38:51,712 --> 00:38:53,850
I'm just trying to get a little culture.

797
00:38:54,533 --> 00:38:57,283
Susan, you painted these?

798
00:38:58,798 --> 00:38:59,942
Y-yes.

799
00:39:00,374 --> 00:39:04,189
Bravo. They are... amazing.

800
00:39:04,215 --> 00:39:06,693
I-I mean, this one, for example,

801
00:39:06,694 --> 00:39:09,925
I me, I'm-I'm getting
shivers just looking at it.

802
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,595
And... is it me...

803
00:39:13,027 --> 00:39:15,316
or do those women look familiar?

804
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:21,837
And the short one kind
of looks like you, Gaby.

805
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:24,968
And, uh, there's you, Susan,

806
00:39:25,338 --> 00:39:26,453
and your friend Lynette,

807
00:39:26,454 --> 00:39:28,762
and pretty one with the red hair...

808
00:39:28,763 --> 00:39:31,139
well... who else but Bree?

809
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:33,025
It's a work of art.

810
00:39:33,026 --> 00:39:35,064
I'm sure it's open to interpretation.

811
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:37,171
No, I'm pretty certain it's you.

812
00:39:38,672 --> 00:39:40,557
What I can't figure out is...

813
00:39:42,242 --> 00:39:43,667
who's that?

814
00:39:45,906 --> 00:39:46,763
Susan, you painted it.

815
00:39:46,764 --> 00:39:50,005
You can't tell me who that
dead body might represent?

816
00:39:52,302 --> 00:39:53,184
Bree?

817
00:39:53,185 --> 00:39:54,311
Any theories?

818
00:39:55,265 --> 00:39:58,567
Maybe a certain...
missing person from Oklahoma?

819
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,747
Okay, what the hell is he talking about?

820
00:40:05,041 --> 00:40:07,778
I am this close to putting this together,

821
00:40:08,532 --> 00:40:09,676
but you know what?

822
00:40:10,388 --> 00:40:12,596
I think I'm gonna take my time,

823
00:40:13,535 --> 00:40:17,715
because I want to enjoy
watching the ice princess melt.

824
00:40:24,577 --> 00:40:25,732
Bree?

825
00:40:25,733 --> 00:40:27,537
What is he talking about?

826
00:40:27,538 --> 00:40:30,026
Alejandro... somebody reported him missing,

827
00:40:30,027 --> 00:40:31,461
and Chuck thinks we're connected.

828
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:32,932
Oh, god.

829
00:40:32,933 --> 00:40:34,839
Is that why he was at
your house the other day?

830
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,658
- Yes.
- But I asked you about that.

831
00:40:36,659 --> 00:40:37,553
Why didn't you tell me?

832
00:40:37,554 --> 00:40:39,699
'Cause you're going through
such a hard time with Carlos.

833
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,420
I didn't wanna burden you.

834
00:40:41,421 --> 00:40:44,091
God, Bree. More secrets?

835
00:40:45,756 --> 00:40:47,451
What did you think you were doing?

836
00:40:47,452 --> 00:40:48,917
I was protecting you.

837
00:40:48,918 --> 00:40:50,484
I've been protecting all of you.

838
00:40:50,485 --> 00:40:51,411
Ever since that night,

839
00:40:51,412 --> 00:40:53,902
I am the one trying to
keep this thing together!

840
00:40:54,262 --> 00:40:55,265
Yeah, well, great job.

841
00:41:09,184 --> 00:41:11,141
There's the woman of the hour.

842
00:41:11,563 --> 00:41:12,827
How do you feel?

843
00:41:14,885 --> 00:41:17,321
I never wanted people
to see these paintings.

844
00:41:18,826 --> 00:41:20,606
I feel...

845
00:41:21,832 --> 00:41:22,865
miserable.

846
00:41:25,971 --> 00:41:27,799
Then congratulations.

847
00:41:30,499 --> 00:41:31,983
You're finally an artist.

848
00:41:36,018 --> 00:41:41,330
<i>Yes, there comes a time when
we must expose our weaknesses...</i>

849
00:41:44,541 --> 00:41:48,245
<i>when our secrets can no
longer remain private...</i>

850
00:41:50,824 --> 00:41:54,807
<i>when our solitude can
no longer be denied...</i>

851
00:41:59,794 --> 00:42:03,961
<i>when our pain can no longer be ignored...</i>

852
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:10,422
<i>but sometimes we feel so alone...</i>

853
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,953
<i>that a weakness
we thought we'd overcome...</i>

854
00:42:16,653 --> 00:42:20,649
<i>suddenly becomes too strong to fight.</i>

855
