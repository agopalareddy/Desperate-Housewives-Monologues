Previously on...
Dave got caught...
...changing your name and
living near your family,
it's not healthy or safe.
Gaby got leverage.
I'm getting
that bonus after all.
So, Brad, what sort of bonus
are we looking at?
Katherine dropped a bomb.
- Mike's moving in here.
What?
- Tom called it quits.
If we're gonna sell
this place,
We should probably know
exactly how much it's worth.
And Bree got honest...
You're paid based on your contribution.
- You're saying I'm worthless.
No, I'm just saying
you're worth... less.
Which resulted
in some strange behavior.
Everyone who met Orson Hodge
knew he believed
in being polite.
He greeted his neighbors
each day with a sunny...
Good morning.
He opened doors for young women
with a gallant...
Allow me.
If he bumped into a stranger
on the street...
Oh!
He'd cheerfully say...
- I beg your pardon.
And if one of his friends
was having a hard time,
Orson was the first to say...
- You need some help there?
Whether his friend
wanted his help or not.
Orson.
What are you doing here?
Well, I heard about
your going out of business sale,
and I thought
you could use a hand.
I'm good. Thanks.
Oh!
Wow. This is charming.
Oh, it's a salt shaker
my grandfather gave me.
Used to display it
on the shelf.
How much you want for it?
It's not for sale.
Everything in that box is
stuff I'm taking with me.
Oh. Okay.
Just trying to help out.
Know it's a difficult day,
And I think I, of all people,
understand what it is
you're going through.
Why you "of all people"?
Well, I know what it's like
to have your livelihood
suddenly vanish.
Remember,
I used to be a dentist.
Oh. Right.
Right.
Of course, it's not
really the same, is it?
What's not?
My business started going
south because of a bad economy.
It got worse when my son
was accused of a crime
that he didn't commit,
but you lost your license
because you went to prison
for a crime you did commit.
Why are you being this way?
Because what's happening
to me is unfair.
What happened to you was...
- Justice?
Yeah, and to compare
my situation with yours,
on a day like this,
well, I gotta tell you,
it's a little insulting.
Then I apologize.
My intention was
never to insult you.
I wanted to support you
in your--in your hour of need.
Uh-huh. Um, vultures
are starting to arrive.
I'll leave you to it, then.
Yes,
everyone who met Orson Hodge
knew he believed
in being polite.
What they didn't know is
that he also believed
in punishing those who weren't.

The day after Mike Delfino
moved in
with Katherine Mayfair,
she thought it would be nice
to share her happiness,
so she decided to throw
a housewarng party
for her friends and neighbors.
But from the moment the first
invitation was delivered,
her friends
began making assumptions
about those
who had been invited...
and about those who hadn't.
I know it's late notice,
but I do hope
you'll all be able to make it.
- Now does this really mean no gifts,
or is it like
when Gaby says "no gifts"
And she means no cheap gifts?
- You know, Katherine, if you need any help,
I would be happy to make my fam--
- Shh!
Hey, guys.
What are we talking about?
The federal deficit.
Whoo! That sucker's big!
Actually, Susan, we were talking
about my hsewarming party.
Oh, yeah. I'm so excited.
You got my R.S.V.P., right?
Yes. I'm so glad you're coming.
Oh, um, by the way,
can you bring your blue punch bowl?
- Absolutely. Anything else you need?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's happening here?
Why isn't hair being pulled?
Why would we do that?
Um, let's see.
She's shacking up with your ex?
Something which, when I do it,
I get an angry mob
on my front lawn.
- I mean, let's be honest, Susan.
You weren't exactly
over the moon
when you heard they
were gonna live together.
Well, yes, I was upset at first.
But, you know, Mike was gonna
be with someone eventually,
and I consider myself lucky
that it was someone, who,
after all is said and done,
has always been my true friend.
Susan, that's very sweet.
And admirable.
And abnormal.
Hey, Gaby, remember when I was with Carlos?
- Shut it, bitch.
See? That's normal.
I'll give you...
$6,000 for it.
What?
It's a $12,000 oven.
There's a dent in the door.
Not a dent. A fist print.
My husband's been
a little frustrated lately.
On the plus side,
it matches the shoe print
on the dishwasher.
$6,200--take it or leave it.
Yi, Yi, Yi, Yi.
Fine. Congratulations.
You just stole a pizza oven.
Hey.
- Hey. I got $6,200 for the oven.
What?! That guy is
ripping us off.
Yeah, well, putting
an "everything must go" sign
kind of eroded
our bargaining position.
How are we doing
on the other stuff?
Well, by the end of the day,
we should be able
to pay off our creditors,
give Bree back
the $20,000 that we owe her
and have enough
to live on for...
45 minutes.
Forget I asked.
I don't want to talk about it now.
Ohh.
Just...
Look, I know this is
a crappy day for you,
but we need to start thinking
About what our plans are going to be.
- I told you, I'm gonna get a job.
And that is so great.
So when do you think that
great thing might happen?
Lynette, don't.
It's taken everything I got
not to lose it right now.
Sorry.
You honestly think
you're gonna get $200
for that cappuccino machine?
I'll give you $50.
50 bucks?! Are you--
- You--ah. Hey.
I think you better stop
with the bargain hunting
unless you want your face
to match the oven
and the dishwasher.
Hey, guys!
What the hell
are they doing here?
They had theater tickets,
and their sitter canceled.
We're only gonna watch their
kids for a couple hours.
Good idea, Gaby.
We're helping the slimeball
cheat on his wife.
Why not babysit for him, too?
- Shh. Hi!
Oh, you guys are angels
for doing this.
Well, what are friends for?
Speaking of which,
thanks for hooking Brad up
with his new girl.
Uh, Shayla, right?
You know, that hairstylist
you recommended--
Uh, I was at the mall
making an appointment,
and Maria walked by.
Oh, that Shayla.
How many shaylas do
you know?
Two. Two.
There's, uh,
Shayla the hairstylist
and then there's
this other Shayla I know
who's a home-wrecking whore.
Hey, Carlos. Uh, why don't you
take, uh, Maria and the kids
Inside and introduce them to the girls?
- Come on, guys.
Come on in.
- All right. Let's go.
You're using me
as an alibi now?
I paid you 30 grand.
I want my money's worth.
And by the way, your tennis game
with Maria tomorrow--
You need to move it to noon.
Why? So you can go
get another "haircut"?
Shayla's got
a couple hours off,
and I want to spend 'em with her.
- Well, Bradley, we all want things.
For instance,
I would like Carlos
to have a week off next month.
Impossible.
It's our busiest time.
Come on, Brad.
We don't want to be late.
Oh, Gaby, we're still on
for tennis tomorrow, right?
4:00?
4:00? Let me think. Uh...
Um...
Actually, noon would be better
for me, could you do noon?
Oh, I was supposed
to have lunch with Brad.
Do you mind, sweetie?
Well, I was really
looking forward to it,
but, uh... go ahead.
You girls have fun.
Listen to him.
Can you believe this guy?
Nope.
He is not to be believed.
My, what an interesting
coat hanger.
It's shaped like a sofa.
Please put it in the closet.
Sorry, darling.
Orson?
Why do you have a salt shaker
from Scavo's Pizzeria?
Oh.
I stopped by to express
my sympathies with Tom,
and I-I remember
l-looking at it,
and I-I guess I absentmindedly
put it in my pocket.
Well, take it back now.
They're liquidating,
And they're gonna need
every penny they can get.
Ma...
I want to stay here
with you.
Me no like-a the Scavos
so much-a.
No?
No.
Oh. Very well.
Though I'm not looking forward
to going down there again.
Really?
Yes. I only went down there
to commiserate,
and he was very dismissive.
Tom has a lot on his mind.
I'm sure he didn't mean it.
You weren't there, Bree.
He was downright rude.
You know, it would serve him
right if I kept this.
Don't be ridiculous.
Tom's rudeness does not
give you license to steal.
Return it immediately.
Ma, you--
you such a pretty girl.
I wanna live-a here with you.
Mwah. Mwah.
Hmm?
Hey.
Oh, great.
You found the punch bowl.
Washed, cleaned, ready to go.
Sorry about the mess.
Mike's still unpacking.
Hey, did you manage to keep that
antler chandelier out of here?
Yeah. That went
right to the garage.
The tough one
was the framed towel
with some football guy's sweat
on it.
That "football guy" is
Peyton Manning.
You would do well to learn that name.
- Ah.
Oh. Wow.
Oh, now that I really love.
I almost couldn't believe
he had something that nice.
Thank you.
- For what?
I painted it.
It was a gift for him.
Really?
You painted that.
He didn't mention it.
Yeah. It was a little beach
we went to for our honeymoon.
Uh, I mean, you know how much
Mike loves the ocean.
Yeah.
Now I can see it every day.
Anyway, um, can't wait
for the party.
It's gonna be fun.
Yep.
I'm sorry you have to go through
this. It must be so hard.
The hard part was when my friend
tried  help me with a loan,
and I thanked her
by becoming a lunatic
and denting her car.
Now that you brought it up,
Lynette, I've been feeling
just awful about the way
I took over your restaurant
and insulted you
and...
what can I say?
I think we have
the kind of friendship
where you don't have
to say anything.
Let's just hug and move on.
Okay?
Oh. How's Tom holding up?
He's doing great.
Isn't it noon?
Yeah. He's up early today.
He just doesn't know
what he's doing next.
Maybe I can help.
My publisher is thinking about
doing his advertising in-house,
and he's been looking
for someone.
Seriously?
- Yeah.
Oh, my God.
That would be great.
And if he gets the job,
you can actually cash the check.
I tell you what.
I will invite Bruce
over for dinner,
you and Tom can join us,
and we'll turn it
into a low pressure job interview.
Thank you.
This will really cheer Tom up.
Great. I'll call Bruce
this afternoon.
Could you call him now?
Hey, Mike.
Oh, I'm looking forward to one
of your world-famous martinis.
So was Mrs. Mccluskey.
She got here early.
Ah.
Yeah, but don't panic. I
sent Edie out for more booze.
Ah. So you sent the mouse
to buy the cheese. Well done.
Well, look who's here.
Somebody owes me $20.
How about we let it ride?
Double or nothing--McCluskey
slugs someone by 5:00.
Katherine and I told you guys
we were taking the high road.
Why won't you believe us?
- Because I vividly remember yesterday,
and I wasn't born during it.
Okay, you know what?
Let me show you something
I think might change your mind.
So Katherine has a picture
that I painted for Mike
hanging over her mantelpiece.
- Does she know you painted it?
Yes, and we talked all about it.
She loves it.
You painted that?
Wow. You're good.
What? Where the hell is it?
- Bye-bye, high road.
What's with the puss?
Katherine hung one of
Mike's paintings over the mantel
till she found out
Susan painted it.
Then she took it down.
Ooh. Something tells me
this party's about to get good.
You know, there could be
A perfectly innocent explanation.
- Hey, Kathy.
What happened
to Susan's painting?
Oh! I am such a klutz.
I was dusting yesterday,
and, well, it just fell.
The glass shattered, and ugh.
It took it to the framer.
It'll be back in a jiffy.
Mm.
Oh! Excuse me.
See a peectly innocent...
bald-faced lie.
It is possible.
I just drained
a pitcher of martinis.
I'm not buying it.
Really, Susan,
there's not a woman in the world
who doesn't know what
"I broke it dusting" means.
That's how I got rid
of Tom's last bottle
of "musk, the cologne for men."
All right,
you guys think what you want.
I'm gonna choose to believe her.
All right, so we have
whiskey and bourbon.
What else does Mike want?
Bup, bup, bup.
We need a system.
Let's start
over there in Scotland,
Head over to Russia and work
our way around the globe.
Wow. It's crowded in here.
- They're all buying lottery tickets.
The jackpot's $100 million.
Look. There's a priest.
I knew that vow of poverty
was a crock.
Hello!
You remember me.
Father Drance.
I-I didn't know you'd moved back
to the area.
Oh, I just remembered.
Mike wants vermouth.
Can you grab that
before we forget?
Sure.
Right away.
It's wonderful to see you
looking so well. I--
Shut up.
I'm only gonna say this once.
I've moved on.
I've remarried,
I have a new life,
and that's the way
I want it to stay--new.
Of course.
So, uh, what was that about?
Oh. He said we sat together
once on an airplane.
Apparently he's less memorable
than he thinks he is.
Come on. Don't want
to miss the party.
Fine
Fine.
Fine. I will do it,
but you owe me.
I gotta go.
Let me guess. Brad.
Yes, he wants me to take
Maria shopping tomorrow.
Yeah, so he can grab a quickie.
You know,
this whole thing is disgusting.
I can't take it anymore.
- I know. Just keep reminding yourself
that we're getting things
out of it, too.
Things I don't want.
Things I haven't earned.
No, I'm gonna tell Bradley
we're out.
What? You can't do that.
You'll lose your job and all that money.
- I don't care about the money.
I do...
And so does my personal shopper
and pilates instructor.
Gaby, no.
We're doing the right thing.
Or we can...
make someone else
do the right thing.
Gaby, what does that mean?
It means...
tomorrow
I'm going to the mall
to get my hair cut by a slut.
Mm.
Hey. Uh, look at what I
found--  my beach painting.
Oh, yeah.
Katherine told me it broke.
Sorry about that.
Yeah, that's
what she told me, too,
Only, uh, it didn't.
That's weird.
Why would she...
I don't know.
She seemed to love
the painting...
until I told her
that I painted it.
Excuse me just a minute.
I'm not making a big deal.
I just want to know why you lied.
Mike, please, not now.
We have a house full of guests.
- No, we'll talk about this now.
What are you doing?
- Uh, nothing.
Susan showed me
the painting.
There's not a scratch on it.
She what?!
You didn't.
Susan!
I hope you enjoyed that.
- I didn't.
I didn't. Uh...
So what are we thinking?
Well, Shayla--
it is Shayla, right?
Mm-hmm.
I need a fresh look.
- Mm.
I've been going through
some pretty intense
personal stuff lately.
Oh. Really?
Fine. I'll tell you.
I have been having an affair
with a married man,
and it's come to that point
where I can't even look
at myself in the mirror.
So I want a new style that says
I'm not a giant turd of sin.
Well, it's not your fault
that you fell in love with a married man.
- Yeah, that's what I thought at first,
and then I realized
that's stupid.
I mean, what about
his poor wife?
Well, maybe she doesn't
love him enough.
Oh, no. She does.
She loves him plenty.
So you want to take the bangs up
a little bit?
And he has kids--
two adorable little kids.
That's sad,
but sometimes you just have
to look out for yourself.
Well, maybe I am tired of being
that kind of selfish bitch.
Have you ever considered,
uh, highlights?
Focus, Shayla!
We are talking about
how I'm ruining
innocent people's lives.
Gaby, you seem like
a lovely, warm person.
Stop beating yourself up.
Oh, for God sakes,
you bleached blonde twit.
I'm not talking about me. I'm
talking about you and Bradley.
What? What--what is this?
Who--who are you?
I'm a friend of Maria's,
who, by the way,
happens to be
a warm and lovely person.
Well, maybe she is,
but Brad doesn't love her.
He says
he's gonna leave her.
Oh, Shayla, he's lying.
She's pregnant.
That's impossible. They haven't
had sex in over a year.
Well, call the Vatican,
'cause we're gonna need
a manger and some hay.
Get out.
- I'm just trying to protect you here.
I said get out now.
Okay, let's just take
a deep breath here--
Let's not do anything
we're gonna regret.
Now.
This is why people should never
get their hair cut in a mall!
Mwah. Ohh.
You couldn't shave?
Come on, Tom.
You need to look nice.
Bree's going to a lot of trouble
for this dinner.
What, is she debuting
a new salmon puff?
Okay. I was going to wait
to tell you this
when you were in a good mood,
but I realize
that's not gonna happen,
so Bree has a special guest
tonight, her publisher...
- Mm-hmm.
And as luck would have it,
he's looking to hire
a new marketing executive.
Oh, my God. What are you--
are you tricking me
into a job interview?
I'll find something, okay?
I just need some time.
You're grieving. I get it.
But this sounds like
a fantastic job.
Please just hear the guy out
and make a nice...
impression.
Fine. I'll shave.
And brush your teeth.
My eyes are watering.
Oh.
And don't just wet
the toothbrush.
I can tell.
Bruce.
- Hello.
Hi. Come on in.
- Hi.
Hi.
Thank you so much
for joining us tonight.
May I take your coat?
Sure.
Let me.
Oh, wait. Let me get
my "brain" out of there.
I never go anywhere
without this.
That way, when I get
a bright idea--
wham! Right into
the tape recorder.
Huh. Sounds like quite a handy gizmo.
- Thank you, Orville.
It's Orson.
Orville, Orson--either way,
he came home from the playground
covered in bruises.
Am I right?
Idea for children's book--
kid who gets the crap
kicked out of him
'cause he has a goofy name.
Could be "Orson."
Oh, that's them.
Wait till you meet Tom.
You'll be so glad
you had that tape recorder.
He's just bursting
with ideas.
Hi.
- Lynette, Tom, hi.
Hey.
I'd like you to meet
my publisher, Bruce.
It's nice to meet you.
Hey. Bree, I'm getting a beer,
if you don't mind.
Hey, Katherine.
Mike is standing
across the street
watching to make sure
I apologize,
even though it's clear to me
you're the one who should
be apologizing for the way
you ruined my party.
One, two, three.
Well, that should
be long enough, so here.
Kiss my ass. Bye.
Hold on.
I'm sorry.
But neither of us exactly gets
a gold star for model behavior.
It's not the same.
Why not? I mean,
you loved that painting
until you found out
that I did it,
and then you acted
totally petty.
So why am I
the only bad guy here?
Let me ask you something,
okay?
Didn't it give you
just the tiniest little thrill
to tell me that
that painting that I was
so happy about was yours?
That I had
something in my house
that represented the love
between you and Mike?
No.
Then what are you doing,
Susan?
Can't you see
how hard this is for me?
You live
right across the street.
You guys share a kid.
Do I have to have a painting
of your honeymoon, too?
Look, I knew
I wasn't going to get
a clean slate with Mike,
okay?
I just wanted
a clean mantelpiece.
Oh.
Fantastic dinner, Bree.
This was a great idea.
Well, I just wanted to get you
together with Tom here.
I thought you two
might hit it off.
Yeah. Tom, Bree says you used
to be quite the ad wiz.
Oh, I don't know.
He's being modest.
He was the best.
Good, because I'm looking
for someone to head up
a new division.
I'm going to put
some coffee on.
Orson,
would you give me a hand?
Let these three chat.
So do you think
you have any interest
in getting back
in the game?
I don't know.
The timing's a little weird.
How so?
I don't know.
Well, Tom was just running
a very successful restaurant,
and he just sold it
at a handsome profit.
So he's waiting
for the right opportunity.
You might have to do
a little selling here, Bruce.
Huh. I guess the good ones are
always the hardest to land.
Yeah
Let me give it a shot.
We represent a small stable
of elite nonfiction authors
from all over the world.
So you'd be working closely
with those writers
to come up with
creative approaches
to selling their books.
That sounds... amazing.
I don't know.
Are there more potatoes?
You can have mine.
Stop saying,
"I don't know."
Mm.
Sounds like
there's a lot of traveling.
I'm not, you know, really big
on living out of a suitcase.
Even to do two weeks
at the book fair in Paris.
While you stay
at a five-star hotel?
Paris?
Like France?
Yes, like the greatest city
in the world.
Gee, I'm getting
Lynette excited.
Too bad you don't have
any advertising experience.
Oh.
Actually, I have
12 years of experience.
Really?
Yeah.
I was account executive
for eight years,
V.P. for four more after that,
and by the way,
I wrote my graduate thesis
on the rise
of the nonfiction novel.
W-wow.
I know. So what kind of starting
salary are we talking about?
Lynette, can I see you for a sec?
Okay. Bruce,
could you hold that thought?
I'm gonna be right back.
Well,
we're on pins and needles.
How's it going?
What the hell are you doing?
- I'm getting this job. That's what I'm doing.
I thought it was my job.
Well, you're not acting like
you want it very much, mister...
"uh, I don't know.
Are there any more potatoes?"
- It's not that I don't want it.
It's just that
it's all happening so fast.
I need a little time to lick my wounds.
- Okay, you lick. I'm going to Paris.
You're not taking my job.
Your job? The one you're
magically gonna get by sulking
and acting like a brat?
You had a shot. You blew it.
Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
You just messed with the bull,
sister.
Prepare to get the horns.
I... ugh!
Maybe we should slice the tart
in here.
I don't want to bring
a large knife into this.
Bruce...
I was just saying to Lynette,
I gave you my "I don't really
care about this job" thing
to see if you really care
about this job,
and you do, and I like that.
Clever.
Now we haven't talked
compensation package yet,
but I got a good feeling--
You know, Tom, you're right.
Bruce does care about this job.
That's why he wants
to make sure
he gets the perfect person
for it.
Well, Lynette, you yourself
said I was the best.
Oh, you were. You were the best
person who ever worked for me.
I used to be his boss.
This is not what I had in mind.
- I don't know
why either one of them wants
to work for that jackass.
Now, now.
He's been very good to me.
Well, of course he has,
because he knows
you make him a lot of money.
Me, on the other hand, he sees
as an insignificant little man,
barely worth mentioning
as he talks into his annoying,
penis-shaped tape recorder.
So I said to him,
"je crois que c'est l'homme
qui fait Les chez d'oeuvres."
And he said to me,
"non, Lynette.
Ce sont Les chez d'oeuvres
qui font l'homme."
Great story...
I assume.
I don't speak another language,
but I've had ad campaigns
translated
into 12 different ones,
including Professor Crispy's
potato chips.
I love that campaign.
You did that?
I did.
Yes. Tom was very good
at his job,
right up until he got fired.
Well, actually,
I was relieved to get fired.
My boss was
kind of a ballbuster.
Oops. She's right here.
Je regrette.
Oh. Would anyone care
for something sweet?
I know I would.
Well, we've all had our troubles
as bosses, haven't we, Tom?
I was sort of sugarcoating it
when I said his restaurant
was very successful.
The truth is,
he mismanaged that pizza joint
right into the ground.
Let me be very clear.
I think
Lynette is fantastic.
She is a great manager,
She's got
terrific people skills
and is very reliable...
As long as the cancer
doesn't flare up again.
You know what?
It's getting late.
I should probably hit the road.
But what about the job?
Yeah...
I just started looking. I'm sure
it's gonna be a long process,
but trust me, you've certainly
made an impression.
I'll get your coat.
Oh, it's a shame
you can't stay for dessert.
I've made Tarte Tatin.
Idea for novel--
woman who's married to a gay man
and doesn't know it.
Well, thanks again.
I don't know when I've had
such an interesting evening.
I'll call you tomorrow.
We'll talk about your friends.
Uh, Bruce,
why don't I wrap up a
piece of that tart to go?
Yeah.
Give it.
Give what?
- Bruce's tape recorder.
I don't know what--
- You took it. I saw you.
Hey. Has anybody seen
my tape recorder?
It was right here.
- I'll look.
Hey.
Ah.
Stop.
I don't have it.
- Ooh! What do you call this?
Uh, Bruce is looking for, uh...
Never mind.
We will talk
about this later.
Oh. Look what got brought in
with the dirty napkins.
Thanks.
Hello, Gaby.
- Ooh!
Jeez, Bradley, you scared me!
You talked to Shayla.
- Yeah, she's a real gem.
You shouldn't have done that.
We have a deal.
Well, I'm tired of the deal,
And what you're doing to Maria
is despicable.
Hey. You're in no position
to judge me.
Don't forget, I was working with
Carlos when you cheated on him.
Yeah, well,
I'm not that person anymore.
I've changed.
Right. You're worse.
You're so worried about Maria
until there's money
or vacation time at stake.
Then you're only worried
about Gaby.
You know what?
You're right.
I'm out.
What do you mean?
- Deal's over.
I'm not covering for your
stupid little fling anymore.
It's not a fling.
I love her.
She's the most incredible woman
I've ever met.
Shayla?
She has a Hello Kitty tip jar.
Well, she makes me happy.
I can't give her up.
Well, at least be
man enough to tell Maria,
because if you don't,
I will.
All right, fine.
I will tell Maria.
And you can tell Carlos
to bring a box to work on Monday
'cause he's fired.
So dinner...
Wow.
Lynette, I will regret
for the rest of my life
what I said tonight.
I... I don't know
what's going on with me.
I do, and it's okay.
Besides, did you hear
what came out of my mouth?
Like I said... wow.
Wouldn't you love to hear
what Bruce said
into his tape recorder
on the ride home?
"Idea--
check local mental hospital
for escaped married couple."
So...
were you serious about
wanting to go back to work?
I was talking about
that job tonight
and trying to convince Bruce
I was good,
and I remembered something.
I am good.
And I would like
another chance to prove it.
Okay.
Really?
Yeah. We did my thing
for seven years.
Now it's your turn.
Oh! Mwah.
Do you know how embarrassed
I would have been
if Bruce
had seen you take it?
He deserved it.
He insulted me.
So say something.
Stand up to him. But stealing?
Honestly, Orson, why would
you do something like that?
I don't know, Bree.
I don't.
Here's something I do know--
When I was
a successful dentist,
no one spoke to me
the way they do now.
When I lost my practice,
I lost people's respect.
And you hope to earn it back
through larceny?
You haven't walked
in my shoes.
Tom lost his job.
Everyone jumped to his rescue.
Even you--
bending over backwards
trying to get him a job.
I don't need to walk
in your shoes, Orson.
What you did was embarrassing
and childish,
and it's never
gonna happen again.
Understood?
See you. Thank you.
Father?
- Yes. Can I help you?
Oh, I hope so.
I, uh, saw you the other night
when you were
buying your lottery ticket.
I was with my husband Dave.
Ah.
Yes. He said that
you barely know each other,
but it didn't seem that way
to me.
And, well,
he refuses to talk
about his past,
so if there is anything that
you could tell me about him--
I'm not sure I can do that.
Please.
He has so many secrets,
and I don't have anyone else
to turn to.
I wish I could help you,
but...
this is something you need
to discuss with your husband.
Well, if it was that easy,
do you think that I would be here?
- I'm sorry.
Please know that my thoughts
are with you both, Mrs. Dash.
It's Williams.
I'm too old-school
for my own good.
I shouldn't just assume that
you took your husband's name.
Anyway...
Good luck, Mrs. Williams.
Hey, Susan. I thought
I had M.J. till 7:00.
Uh, you do. I am here
to take my painting back.
But you gave it to me.
It's mine.
Well, now I'm ungiving it.
Try to keep up.
Okay, if this is about what
happened at the housewarming...
It is, actually,
because that is
when I decided
that I don't want this piece
of art that I slaved over
hanging in the house
you are sharing
with your new girlfriend.
Capisce?
Okay, so the other night
you were mad
because it wasn't hanging up,
but now you want to take it?
Yep. I'm complicated like that.
Aren't you glad you divorced me?
If you two want a painting
so bad, paint your own.
Susan--
- Mayfair.
Stay out of this.
This is
between me and my ex.
Got it?
Unbelievable.
Anyway, I'm thinking a brighter
color for the baby's room.
Now I know
it's a bit of a stretch,
But how do you feel
about turquoise?
Sweetheart?
We need to talk.
What you reading?
The want ads.
Can't decide if I should be
a data entry operator
or join the Marines.
I'm so sorry.
Don't be. I told you, I hated
working for that jackass.
You did the right thing.
I should have done it sooner.
But you did it,
Even though you knew you were
gonna lose a lot of money.
You're a good person, babe.
I'm very proud of you.
Well, that means a lot, coming
from a United States marine.
Mm.
Hello?
Maria.
Calm down.
Calm down.
Okay, we're coming over.
I guess Bradley told her.
Thanks for coming.
I didn't know who else
to call.
It was horrible.
He just kept telling me
he loves her.
She's the best thing
that ever happened to him.
He finally understands
what love means.
I just wanted him
to stop talking.
You should never be
too impressed
by people with good manners.
They're the ones
who will give a friendly wave
even when
they've stolen from you...
they're the type
to sweetly welcome you...
even as they try to uncover
your secrets...
They're the kind
to offer you coffee,
even as they report you
to the police.
And don't be too offended
by someone who's openly rude...
because they may be that way
for the nicest of reasons.
