Previously on DH...
Dylan and katherine raised their profile
and attracted the attention
of an unwanted admirer.
Mike made a surprising request...
do you think you can forgive me?
Which brought orson's
guilt to the surface.
I'm sorry, mike.
Oh, you're sleepwalking.
I'm sorry I ran you over, mike.
Gaby was learning to deal
with carlos being blind...
I'm sorry for what I'm
putting you through.
If it for anyone but you,
it wouldn't be worth it.
And lynette worried...
it's rick's place--
totally went up in flames.
That jealousy could drive
tom to an act of violence.
the thing you have to
know about lynette scavo
is that she had always
trusted her husband tom,
mostly because she could
always tell when he was lying.
Sometimes he would ask her
to repeat the question...
did I eat... your ice cream?
Is that what you're asking?
Or he would use odd words
he had never used before...
oh, I think it looks... spiffy.
Or his voice would get higher...
I guess she's pretty. I
mean... I didn't really notice.
clearly, tom scavo was at a distinct
disadvantage when lying to his wife.
And on this particular morning,
that's exactly what lynette...
{\a6}ARSON SUSPECTED IN RESTAURANT FIRE
was unting oN.
whatcha doing?
I amonesing for a cup of coffee, but
the stupid burner is acting up again.
Need a little caffeine fix?
Big-time.
Too much booze last
night. I'm really draggin'.
the open bar is no
longer your friend, huh?
Guess not.
But they were pouring top-shelf
stuff, and I couldn't resist.
Is that where you were during bree's
acceptance speech-- doing free shots at the bar?
No. Uh, I think that's when I snuck
out to the car to listen to the game.
You go alone?
WellI would've invited carlos, except...
obviously, he can't really
sneak around anymore, so...
yeah.
I was thinkin', if anyone
asks about that fire at rick's,
it'd be good if you had someone
to account for where you were.
Why would it matter?
I didn't start the fire.
Right, right. It's just...
if anyone thinks you did, it'd be handy
if y could prove them wrong, wouldn't it?
- you think I did it.
- No.
One stupid brick, and
now I'm an arsonist?
No, no. Of course not.
It's just, if the police came
here to ask us about the brick,
they're probably gonna ask us about
the fire, so you might wanna be ready.
Listen to me, lynette.As
mad as I have been at rick,
I had absolutely nothing to
do with this fire. We're fine.
- Okay.
- Good.
Lynette scavo had always
trusted her husband.
She had no idea that trust...
was about to go up in flames.

Season04 Episode13
{\a6}KEEP OFF THE GRASS!
Everyone breaks the rules now and again,
and when they do, they
always haven excuse...
like the neighbor whose own
trash was already full...
or the blonde who forgot
to eat her breakfast...
or the employee who needed
an advance on his salary...
it's true-- everyone has a reason
for not following the rules...
even the people who are
meant to enforce them.
Cense and registration, please.
Well, what did I do? I wasn't speeding.
There's a construction zone back
there. You failed to slow down.
Are you sure? I didn't
see a sign or anything.
You wanna step out of the car, please?
You're not gonna give me a ticket,
are you? My mom will kill me.
Where do you go to school?
Fairview high.
- Pretty necklace.
- Oh, thanks.
Listen, I'm really sorry
about the construction zone.
I would have slowed down if
I had seen the sign, I swear.
I'll tell you what.
I'll let you go with a warning.
Just pay more attention next time, okay?
Thank you. That's very
nice of you. Thank you.
that's everything, I guess.
Well, if you forgot something, you
can just come back for it, or...
you could just not leave.
Oh, that's so sweet, but...
our house is livable again-- the downstairs
anyway-- and we have imposed long enough.
Besides, mike is comingome tonight, and
you're gonna need the house to yourselves.
Well, before you go, I
just want to say that, um...
having you here
these last few weeks--
susan, I'm just going across the street.
There's no need to act
like a silent movie heroine.
I know. I just... I can't stop now.
I broke the seal.
Well, um, as much as I appreciate
this naked display of emotion,
you know how this sort of
thing makes me uncomfortable.
I can't help it. My
hormones are in overdrive.
Didn't you get that way
when you were pregnant?
No. Never.
Ally?
Not even when you heard
an acoustic guitar?
No. Never.
Oh, I just can't
control myself like that.
Oh, sure, you can.
Whenever I feel my emotions
getting the best of me,
I simply picture an empty box, and I take
whatever I'm feeling and put that in the box,
and then i picture myself
putting the box away
in a big,empty closet
and closing the door.
Then if I have time, I
go back and open the box
and deal with the emotion...
in private, like a lady.
Thanks.
I'm gonna try that.
so you don't think I act like a lady?
prove me wrong, sweetie. Prove me wrong.
All right. Come on, girl.
Okay, carlos, here's the harness.
There you are!
Oh, you must be roxy!
Aren't you the cutest thing!
Okay, not too close. It's silk.
Gaby, this is steve. He's the
head trainer at the dog school.
Ah, nice to meet you.
Carlos told me how much he
enjoyed taking classes with roxy.
Well, they make a great team.
Well, I have got a million questions
about this little lifesaver here.
Okay, shoot.
Okay, hypothetical situation--
carlos and I are sitting on the couch.
I'm doing my nails. He's
whining for the remote.
How do I get roxy to fetch it for him?
she's serious.
Roxy doesn't do that.
Um, her job is to get carlos from point
"a" to point "b" as safely as possiblE.
I get that, but surely she's
trained to do other stuff, you know,
like find his keys or turn off
the radio or lick up his spills.
Yeah, and after that, she can go
solve crimes with shaggy and the gang.
Don't ve me your blind sarcasm.
I saw a collie on tv who
could push a lawn mower.
Do you have one of those?
Gaby, roxy's fantastic.
Really? Well, for a dog who's supposed
to help us, she sounds kind of limited.
sorry, but it's true.
She's not here to help us.
She's here to help me, which you would know if you
had bothered to show up to the spouses' orientation.
Well, I'm sorry.I was on
my hands and knees that day,
scouring the bathroom floor because
you fused to pee like a girl.
So... any other questions?
No, it's crystal clear.
Carlos gets a new best friend, and
I get to check the sofa for ticks.
Yay for gaby!
Did I exaggerate?
Actually, you were kind
oh, it feels good to take a shower
in my own house. At you doing?
In honor of you coming home, we are making
your favorite meal-- steak and mashed potatoes.
Oh, that sounds great.
For future reference, my
favorite is potatoes au gratin.
Since when?
Since always. Since I was 3.
You could say "au
gratin" when you were 3?
Oh, it's fine. Susan,
mashed is great, too.
it's not your favorite?
what are you doing?
Excuse me. I have to put something
in a box and stick it in the closet.
Hormones.
Got it.
Pretty much anything
sets her off these days.
Uh, which is why I haven't told her...
told her what? Something wrong?
Well, when bree and orson
were staying with us,
this weird thing happened.
Oh, yeah. Naked orson? I heard.
Must have been quite a show.
No, this was the next night.
He was sleepwalking, and he
said something kinda strange.
But like I said, he was asleep,
so it's probably nothing.
Julie, what'd he say?
He said... "I'm sorry I ran over mike."
- what?
- It's crazy, right?
Why would he say something like that?
He didn't even know
you when that happened.
Yeah, you're right. It's crazy.
Yeah, that's what I figured.
Okay, well, I'm gonna go check
on mom and make sure she's okay.
We don't need any more
drama in this house.
yeah, I agree.
How's the move going?
Need an extra pair of hands?
No, thanks. We're almost done.
Okay, well, I won't
get in your way then.
Let me just run something by you.
I got a call today from a couple who
loved our work on the founder's ball.
Oh, how sweet.
Yes, and they want to hire us
to do their anniversary party.
Hire us? But we're not a business.
We could be. Think about it.
We do the exact same
thing we did at the ball,
only this time, we walk
away with a big, fat check.
Katherine, need I remind you we nearly
came to blows over floral choices?
I think it's our creative friction
that makes us a great team.
I think it's our creative friction
that nearly caused me to poison you.
All right, look, bree, I'm
gonna be honest with you.
With adam out of the house,
I really need the money.
I sympathize.I do,
but I have a new baby,
and it's really more work than
I care to take on right now.
I understand.
- Guess I'll just do it myself then.
- Excuse me?
Now did you take pictures of
those table settings you designed?
I'd love to get copies.
The couple raved about them.
Yeah, sure.
You know, I don't really think it's fair that
you should profit from something that I designed.
You're right.It would only be fair
if I asked you to do this with me, which
I did, and you said no. So on we go.
I hope you don't mind if I serve
your cinnamon apple crumble.
That is a cherished
recipe from my grandmother.
Well, w it's a cherished recipe
from catering by katherine.
Oh, I see what's going on here.
This is shameless emotional blackmail.
And?
And... it worked beautifully. I'm in.
No more doggy treats. She's had enough.
But she's been so good.
Yeah? Well, when she learns how to
make granite sparkle, she can have more.
I'm giving her a treat.
Carlos, I said no.
fine. One treat.
That's it.Those things are expensive,
and until your disability kicks
in, we have to tighten our belts.
So I guess that means you won't
be getting your hair done anymore.
Carlos, remember what
my fingers look like?
Just picture the middle
one all by itself.
Besides, you're the one
who married me for my looks.
Well, I'm blind now, so as long
as you use deodorant, I'm good.
Do you have any idea how
selfish you sound right now?
Just because you're blind,
the world should suffer?
I'm just saying, you know,
$300 visits to mr. Francois--
carlos, I'm getting my hair
done! End of discussion!
what are you barking at?
You got your damn treat.
You know, if we really want to save money,
you could cut down on those cuban cigars.
Or... here's a thought.
You could get a job.
- Why don't you get a job?
- Doing what?
Put flags on pencils and
sell them at the airport.
What do I care? Just
get out of my kitchen.
- What is this about?
- I don't know.
I guess she doesn't like
it when you smack me.
Oh, so now I can't hit my
own husband in my own house?
Look, we can cut corners all you want, but
I am not gonna skimp when it comes to my dog.
Roxy, come.
- hey, neighbor.
- Oh, mike.
Welcome back. You're looking well.
Yeah, well, you know me. Indestructible.
- What you looking for?
- A hammer.
We're putting some of
the pictures back up.
This it?
Thanks, buddy.
You got a minute?
Uh, actually, uh, bree's
waiting-- waiting for me.
You said something to julie
when you were sleepwalking.
I did?
Yeah, and I need you to clear it up.
Are you the guy that ran me over?
mike...
I'm so sorry.
I'm so...
no way.
That mutt is not sleeping in our bed!
She's clean. It's okay.
No. No, it's not.
I read the pamphlet steve left.
These dogs are not allowed on furniture.
I know. I...
I just think it's good for a dog to
sleep with its master. It helps us bond.
Well, if you ever want to bond with
my boobs again, you'll get her off!
you're being selfish.
We can put her at the foot of the bed.
Carlos, no!
she doesn't like it when
you yell at me, remember?
you're right, baby. I'm sorry.
let me try it this way.
you listen to me, you
blind son of a bitch.
If you don't get this mangy, 6-nippled,
cujo wannabe off my satin sheets,
you n't just need a dog to get around.
You'll need a motorized wheelchair
that you steer with your tongue.
Really?
Carlos, I mean it.
Who's it gonna
be-- me or the dog?
maternity
lingerie-- ah, right.
Why don't they just call
it what it really is?
A pup tent to hide your stretch marks.
Oh, actually, if it's okay, I'm really
not in the mood right now. I'm sorry.
- I understand.
- Thanks.
You just don't want to be crushed
under the weight of a repulsive cow.
- That is not it.
- No, I get it.
really, I knew this day was coming.
I just didn't know it would
be a day when I was so horny.
honey, I still find you incredibly sexy.
It's me. I...
I just got a lot on my mind right now.
What's going on?
I found out something today.
I didn't want to tell you, but...
well, you can tell me anything.
That's what we talked about in
all those sessions with the doctor.
you're right.
But if I tell you, you have to promise
to let me handle this my own way.
who could that be at this hour?
susan.
what on earth?
You are never to come
near my family ever again!
- Do you understand?
- What are you talking about?
Do you hear me, orson?
Damn it. Susan, I-- I told
you to let me handle this.
Will someone please
tell me wh's going on?
So you don't know that your
husband tried to kill mike?
What?
Look, I explained this to
mike. I panicked.I was trying--
trying to protect your
mother? I know. Who cares?
Youdrove the car, you ran him
over, and you left him for dead!
Susan, let's go.
And the worst part...
all this time, you
pretended to be our friend.
If there was one thing gabrielle
solis would not tolerate,
it was a rival,
whether she walked onwo legs... or four.
So when gabrielle crept into her bedroom
that morning, she'd made up her mind...
the bitch had to go.
roxy... look what I've got.
come on. Come on.
Okay,yes
Okay, let's go.
let's go, roxy. Let's
go, roxy. Let's go.
let's go in the car.
hey there, dylan.
Don't you remember me? I'm the cop
who didn't give you a ticket yesterday.
Um, yeah, I remember.
would it be okay if I sat down?
I just want to have a
little chat with you.
Why?
Don't worry. You're not in trouble.
Actually, I can't stay.
I'm meeting my friend
julie at the mall, so I--
look, I'm--i'm not trying
to scare you. I just...
I just want to talk.
Talk about what?
How's your mom doing?
You know my mom?
Oh, yeah.
Look, a couple of days ago, I saw a
picture of you and kathy in the paper,
and I did a background check, and I found out
that you're living back at your aunt's place.
When you left yesterday, I
was parked down the street.
You followed me?
- So when you pulled me over,
that was-- - I lied to you.
You weren't speeding. I'm sorry.
I just had to meet you.
Who are you?
I'm wayne davis.
I'm your father.
Oh,roxy,this way.
Uh,mrs. Solis,what are you doing here?
Uh,I'm bringing roxy back.
Uh,what?
Shame,isn't it?
I mean,i personally adored the little
angel,but she and carlos just did not get along.
Really?
Well,sorry it didn't work out.
I gotta run.
uh,tell carlos I'll call
him about another dog.
Oh,well,actually,we found one.
From where?
We're the only guide
dog school in the area.
Well,that's it.
It's not a dog.
We got him a seeing...eye...monkey.
He's amazing.
not only can he call
9-1-1,he can toast a bagel.
Bye.
roxy,what the heck happened back there?
Roxy!
Roxy!
Roxy,stop!
gaby,where were you? Where's roxy?
Oh,carlos,I'm afraid
I have some bad news.
What? At happened?
Well,you know how you like it
when I read you the box scores?
When I went out to get the paper--
ly thinking of making you happy--
gaby,where's my dog?
She ran away.
When I opened the door,she saw
a squirrel,and she took off.
She's gone? Well,you gotta go find her.
Where do you think I've been?
There's no sign of her anywhere.
Yeah,I'm sure you looked
really,really hard.
How dare you.
I have looked from one
end of town to the other,
and I'm telling you,
she's nowhere to be found.
but since you love her so
much,I'm gonna keep looking.
was that roxy?
I'm not sure.
Why don't I go look?
No. It's the scavo dog...
way down in their yard.
I guess it's true-- lose one
sense,all the others get heightened.
okay,you get that.
I'm gonna go find your dog.
come on,you stupid mutt.
gaby,you still here?
Yeah,still no sign of roxy.
But don't worry.
I'm on the case.
That was steve from the guide dog place.
You want a piece of pie or somethin'?
Yeah,I'm not ngry either.
I don't know what to say to you.
You don't have to say anything.
I'm having a good time
just looking at you.
You have my nose.
bet you didn't know that,right?
My mom says we left because
you used to beat her.
Is that true?
Yeah,I hit her a couple times.
So you admit it?
What,did you think I was gonna lie and
tell you that I was a great husband?
'Cause I wasn'T.
But you gotta know,there's
two sides to every story,
and I swear to god,your
mom gave as good as she got.
I mean,you believe me,right?
I don't know.
You know what? This was a mistake.
I should go.
Go? We just got here.
Look,I didn't track you
down to cause any problem
I only wanted to make sure that
your mom raised you properly,
and now I see that she did.
I mean,you're...
you're spectacular.
That's what I needed...to
know that you're okay and...
that a little part of
you looks just like me.
How can you just walk away?
'Cause I'm not the
same jerk I used to be.
Sure,I'd like to have
a relationship with you,
but if your mom is still scared
of me after all these years,uh...
no.
I don't want to upset her again.
I don't haveo tell her.
What?
She doesn't have to know that I saw you.
Oh,that'S...
I don't know about that.
It's just that I have
so many questions,and...
I don't think we'd be hurting anybody
if we just sat and talked for a while.
And we'd keep this from your mom?
Sure.
Well...okay.
darlin',bring me back that dessert menu.
I wanna have a slice
of pie with my daughter.
uh,I think we might be out of candles.
I don't think so. Check under the bar.
Rick.
How's it goin'?
"How's it goin'"?
It's goin' pretty bad.
I didn't mean to.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry--
sorry for your troubles.
Oh,that's touching,man.
Thanks.
So did you just come here to bust my hump,or
is there something I can help you with?
Actually,you can help me.
You can help me figure out what the hell these were
doing by the back door of my torched restaurant.
How should I know?
so that's how you're gonna play this?
Uh,no candles here.
I'm--I'm gonna go
check in the back.
Great.
Look,I can see you're upset,pal,but
I'm not the guy you're looking for.
you know I respect you...
hey,andrew. What do you need?
Uh,I'm looking for candles,and--and
that guy rick's here.
oh,my god!
Stop it!
What are you doing? Stop.
Hey,easy. EasY.
Just stop it!
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Andrew,do something!
Do something!
stop it!
Stop!
Oh,for god sakes,what
is the matter with you?
What are you,12 years old?
Stop it.
Jeez.
so when are you guys gonna
finish grilling my husband?
It won't be much longer,ma'am.
you know,in spite of everything that's
happened,it's really good to see you again.
It makes me realize how much I miss you.
If you insist on questioning my
husband about a crime he didn't commit,
you should at least have all the facts.
Okay.
You've got my attention.
Well,for starters,mr. Coletti opened
his restaurant to get back at me
because I wouldn't
have an affair with him.
Honey.
Oh,so you're saying your husband
had two motives for setting the fire?
No.
I am saying that if anyone
had an ax to grind,it's rk.
Maybe he set the fire himself
soe could blame my husband.
I was at the gym.
You can call my trainer.
And tom was at the
founder's ball with me.
We have witnesses that say
he disappeared for a while.
I told you,I was in the car
listening to the basketball game.
That's true.
I saw him.
I was mad that he ditched me,so I
went to drag his ass back inside.
But when I saw him shoutingt the radio,
I decided I'll just wait and make
his life miserable when we get home.
So unless there's a law againschoosing
lebron james over your wife,
I think we're done here.
All right.
So that's it?
Y-you're just gonna let him go?
Look,we don't have enough
evidence to hold him,sir.
Because his wife provided him an alibi?
Come on,man.
Rick,look.
You know me.
If tom had done something like this,do
you really think I would protect him?
Fine.
you know,you didn't have to
make up that story for me.
Didn't i?
'Cause it kinda seemed like they
had you against the ropes in there.
Well,that would only be a problem if I
were guilty,and clearly,I'm not,right?
- God,you don't believe me,do you?
- Sure,I do.
It must've been some other random maniac with a
grudge against rick who burned down his restaurant.
So you're calling me a liar?
That's what you're doing.
You're saying I lied.
Well,it wouldn't be the first time.
You lied about the brick,and
you were pretty smooth,too.
Hell,i bought it.
Yeah,just like I bought your story
about never sleeping with rick.
Excuse me?
- "Oh,look at me,rick. You know me,rick."
- Okay.
God,I felt like telling
you guys to get a room.
Okay,you are angry,so I'm
gonna let that one pass,
and I'm gonna say this
for e very last time.
nothing happened between me and rick.
Okay.
I didn't set that fire.
You see? I can talk slow,too.
Carlos asked me to pick up
some doggy treats for roxy.
He called you?
Why didn't he ask me?
Oh,I think you were busy at the
time...kidnapping his guide dog.
classy,by the way.
Don't judge me.
You don't know this hound from hell.
I raise my voice a
teensy bit,and she barks,
or I give carlos a little
smack,and she growls.
Well,I have an idea.
Why don't you not do those things?
Thanks for the biscuits,edie.
No,I'm serious.
There was always a certain...sick charm
to the way you used to abuse carlos.
But now that he's blind,it's just sick.
We're fine.
This is who we are.
This is our relationship.
Well,ur relationship has to
change,gaby,because he's changed.
Not that much. Just his eyes.
Mm,no.
I know carlos. He's proud.
He's gonna pretend that he can
still go toe-to-toe with you
as if he was the same
man that he always was.
But he's not,and he
will never admit that.
are you done with your armchair
analysis,3-divorce annie?
Sure.
But if you're not gonna
treat carlos right,
there are plenty of other
womenout there who will.
I think I proved that.
why don't you come inside?
I can't come out my front door
every day and see that man.
We have to move.
susan...
I know this is difficult,
but before you start putting up "for
sale" signs,let's just take a step back.
Take a step back from what?
He tried to murder you.
I know what orson did
was horrible,but...
I've decided to forgive him.
How can you do that?
He put you in a coma.
I sat there day after day,wondering
if you were gonna live.
As far as I'm concerned,orson
can go to hell.
Well,I've talked to him.
Trust me,he's already been there.
Well,that's not enough.
He should pay for what he did.
He should go to prison.
And what,leave bree without a
husband and benjamin without a dad?
You don't want tha look...
I've done some pretty
horrible things in my life,
but you forgave me because you
knew how much I regretted 'em.
I really believe he's
sorry for what he did.
So now i have to forgive hi
I've just got to.
But...
I also understand if you can'T.
Hey,you guys know you're not
supposed to be out of bed.
How come daddy's sleeping
on the couch again?
Come here.
Come on.
okay.
Mommy and daddy are sort of...fighting,
but we're working through it.
What are you fighting about?
Oh,something he did that
made mommy really mad.
Can we talk to you about something?
Yes,of course.
The other day at the pizza place...
We heard daddy say that man
wanted to take you away from us.
Oh,sweetie,I am so sorry.
I bet that really scared you,didn't it?
Yeah.
So when you went to that party,we got on
our bikes and de down to his restaurant.
You did what?
We just wanted him to go away.
That's why we set the fire.
So please don't be mad at daddy.
Oh,my god.
mike says I need to forgive orson...
- susan--
- and he's right.
I have to find a way to
make peace with all of this.
But you need to understand,it's gonna b
one of the hardest things I've ever done.
And like most things in my life,I probably
won't do it with much elegance or grace.
So if I don't come over
to your house for coffee...
if I don't smile when
the two of you walk by,
just please know that I still love you.
And for forgiving orson...
just be patient.
I'll get there.
I think it's admirable that
you wanna forgive orson...
because I can'T.
whatcha doin'?
Working on the menu for the event
that bree and I are catering.
I have to stop now to...pick up the
invitations at the printer's beforehey closE.
I can do that for you.
It's okay,sweetie.
No,I want to.
Maybe I could pick up some
dinner for us on the way back.
You know,mrs. Hoskins' daughter
became nice like this once...
right before she brought
home a boy named slash.
I'm being nice because I've
been a pain lately,and...
with adam gone,we need to be a team.
It's just us now.
what?
It's just...
it's like you turned into this lovely
young woman when I wasn't looking.
We have to stop at the
printer on the way to dinner.
Whatever you say,sweetheart.
The truth is,everyone breaks
the rules now and then...
well,what you've you been doing?
Never thinking for one
second they might get caught.
Some things disappear.
like,that happened to me like...
but if they do,they
simply ask for forgiveness.
And most of the time,they receive it.
But some acts are so wicked,they
demand only our condemnation.
How do people avoid such a fate?
Well...the trick is knowing which
rules are made to be broken...
and which rules...
are not.
