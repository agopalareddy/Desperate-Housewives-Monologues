Mike's therapy hit a snag.
Keep telling you,I don't remember.
Something happened at the movie.
Who did you see it with?
Probably Susan.
Why not ask her about it?
- Mike,it wasn't a movie, that was us.
- What?
That was the first night that
we spent together.
I saw you watching us.
We were just talking.
Gaby saw another side of Victor.
I didn't marry an angry woman.
I just divorced one.
And I set her up in a nice house,
and gave her allowance then
I came and went as I please
I've known you for two weeks,
and this is the first glimpse of a guy
I could actually like.
Tom's back put him out of commission.
It'll be a while
before he's back on his feet.
How much of a while?
Three months.
And Eddie bared more her soul for Carlos.
Im here,and I'm asking for a chance.
Eddie Britt had always thought of herself
as passionate--
aggressively...
relentlesly...
violently passionate.
Carlos Solis had always thought
of himself as passionate
romantically...
spontaneously...
constant passionate.
So it was natural for Eddie and Carlos
to assume that if they ever had sex,
it would be amazing.
And, in fact, it was...
amazingly...
bad.
- Morning.
- Morning.
So, uh, last night...
Yeah, I know.
Wow.
Super wow.
Oh, man, I gotta get to work.
Ah, I gotta get home.
Uh... Oh! We should do this again.
Oh, definitely.
Yeah, this week doesn't seem to be that great.
- Maybe...
- Ugh! Next week, I'm swamped.
Well, we'll figure something out.
It was at that moment Eddie and Carlos
had the exact same thought...
Thank you.
No... Thank you.
They would definitely
be having sex again...
just not...
with each other.
