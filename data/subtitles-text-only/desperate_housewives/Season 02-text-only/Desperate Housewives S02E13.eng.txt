I'm curious. Um...
why were youso congratulatory?
Oh,the spleen surgery--
it'll be his first!
Hey,honey.
Can we talkabout something?
Sure.
So I've been thinkingabout the whole baby thing.
And how ever long it takes for you to feel ready,I am fine with.
Okay.
But here's the deal--
I need to knowthat this isn't a maybe.
I want a promisethat we will have children.
I'm sorry.I can't promise that.
Why not?
Because I can't saythat I'm gonna wake up tomorrow
and suddenly wanna do somethingthat I swore my entire life
I would never do. "Maybe" isa very big step for me.
Yeah,well,it isn'tbig enough for me.
Well,I'm sorry,but you'rejust gonna have to accept it.
There's nothing else you can do.
That isn'tnecessarily true.
Excuse me?
Annulments
You are threatening mewith an annulment?
That conniving little bitchput you up to this,didn't she?
Didn't she?
This fight could beover right now
if you'd justmake me a promise.
The only promiseI am making you
is that this isso not over.
hi!
Hey.
Hi.
How's the search coming forthe new ad exec? Any luck?
Oh,the pickings are slim.
So far none ofmy top choices are available.
Hey,um,do you have someonefrom your old company
that you could,you know,maybe recommend?
Daddy!Well--
I can't find my toothbrush.
I'll be upin a second,buddy.
Hi.
As a matter of fact,
there's this one guy who would be perfect.
Yeah?
Yeah,hard-working,smart as a whip. Total package.
Really? What's his name?
Tom.
Tom? Tom what?
Tom scavo.
no! No!
I do not think thatthat is a good idea.
Come on,honey,I mean,the other nightdoing those pitches--
it just gotthe old juices flowing.
I remembered how muchI miss having a real job.
You have a real job,right herestaying home with the kids.
With two incomes,we couldafford a top-notch nanny.
What about penny?
You're the one who fought foroffice day care. Let's use it.
What about the two of us workingand living together?
I think that could bea recipe for disaster.
Why? The last timethat we worked together...
we fell in love.
Oh,it's just...
I'M...
I'm not sure that you would findthis job that satisfying.
You don't thinkI'm good enough,do you?
I'm not saying that.
Daddy,I stillcan't find my toothbrush!
- I'll go.
- I got it.
Come on,buddy.Let's hunt it down.
So who won the fight?
We weren't fighting.
Mommy's just lettingdaddy know where he stands.
Oh,hey! Hey!
- thanks for coming in,mr. Gainey.
- We'll be in touch.
Thank you. Bye.
What did you think?
Well,honestly,I wasn't blown away.
I know the pickingsare slim,
but we can't hold outmuch longer.
We need to hiresomeone this week.
I know! I know! I know.
So who's up next?
Tom cavos.You ever heard of him?
Just... uh...
could you excuse mefor just a minute?
Sure.
- Tom cavos?
- Yeah,it's an anagram.
It's deceptively simple,don't you think?
What do you think
you're doing?
I'm going overyour head.
I mean,you mightnot think I'm good enough,
but maybe ed will bea little more open-minded,
since,you know,he's notconstantly competing with me.
You want the truth,tom?
I think you're good.You have moments of brilliance.
But I also thinksometimes you coast.
And I thinkif i were your boss
and had to ride your assevery day,
you would come homeseething with resentment.
Come on! It's hard enoughkeeping a marriage together.
If you're at all concernedabout saving our marriage,
you better let metake my shot.
What does that mean?
It means that a little partof me has been hating you
ever since you tankedmy promotion at petersen.
Tom...
but I could let it all go ifyou'll give me this one thing.
Excuse me.Ed's waiting for you guys.
Great! Great!
Just let my résuméspeak for itself.
Uh,just let your résuméspeak for itself?
Yes.
okay!
Oh! You workedthe poncer cheese accounts?
Those "angry mouse" spots?They were hilarious!
I was on thatfrom the beginning.
warning,do not eat the cheese!
The cheese is evil!
I love that!
You've got a great résum?Thank you.
Yeah,gosh,it is.It's quite impressive.
Oh,wow,I see you workedfor bellfore and barrasso.
That's a great shop.
Yeah,I put my time in.
Uh-huh,and when were you there?
Because you forgot to list your dates of employmentfor that one.
Um,that wasa few years back.
Uh-huh. And how longdid you stay?
Just about five months,actually.
What,did you getrecruited by another firm?
Did somebodycherry-pick ya?
No,I was fired.
Yeah,but honestly,I was happy to leave
because they didn't getmy sense of humor.
I actually pitched a version of the "cheese is evil"there first.
They hated it.
Idiots!Well,their loss,right?
Yep.And I see you won a clio for the thompson's salad dressing spot.
That was very cool.
So did you do that solo?
Actually,no. My wifehelped me on that one.
Um,she's inadvertising,too.
But if you were to ask her,
I'm sure she'd tell you she did the whole thing all by herself.
credit hog,huh?I know the type.
You know what,tom?I like you.
Ed...
and I'm not usually onefor hiring in the room.
No,no,no,no,we never hire in the room.
But we're in a time crunch,and we need someone now.
I think you're the guy.
Lynette,you got any issues?
Well...
um,let me just call ina few references
before we makeanything official.
Sure! Sure!We'll be in touch,okay?
the cheese is evil!
Oh,god,I love that.
Oh,um,I'm lookingfor father crowley.
Do you know where he is?
Um,he's inthe confessional.
How long has it beensince your last confession?
Who cares?
Father,it's me.
Gabrielle?
Yeah.
Look,I need youto do something for me.
I need you to get rid ofsister mary bernard.
What? Why?
Because she's ruiningmy marriage.
- Sister mary?
- Yes!
At first it startedwith the love letters while he was in prison,
and the next thing I know,
they're spendingday and night together--
sneaking offto private bible study,
- and one-on-onespiritual consultation.
- Gabrielle--
and if that wasn't enough,he issaying her name in his sleep.
"hold me,sister mary,hold me."
it's disgusting.He's like a lovesick puppy.
do you have reasonto believe that your husbandand sister mary are...
having sex?
Speak from the heart,gabrielle.
This is just betweenme,you and god.
Yeah... yep.They're having sex.
Carlos confessedeverything...
right beforehe asked for an annulment.
forgive me,father,for I have sinned.
How long sinceyour last confession?
Mm,not that long ago.
Look,I sorta told a fib,so...
how many "hail marys"is that gonna set me back?
- oh,honey.
- Go away!
Oh,honey,what happenedwasn't my fault.
There's no way I could'vepredicted how betty would react.
Oh,please,you knewsomething bad would happen.
You wanted all thisto blow up in my face.
Oh,honey,why would I want that?
Because you're jealous thatmy life's just getting started
and yours is over.
Danielle,that's ridiculous,sweetheart.
Daddy's dead.
You drove your boyfriendto suicide.
You're getting olderby the minute,
and soon you'll beso dried up and bitter
that no man will ever wantto touch you ever again.
Danielle...
and now you're determinedto ruin my life
so I have to stay with you hereand keep you company
while you turninto an old fossil.
All I ever wanted wasfor you to be happy.
Don't just want it.Make it happen.
danielle,I don't feel muchlike cooking tonight.
I'm thinkingof ordering a pizza.
I want canadian bacon.
Please.
All right.
He's mad at you'cause you hit him.
Well,I feel bad about that.
But when I considerthe risks he was taking...
it's a shamehe can't see that girl.
She's so pretty.
What did you sayabout danielle?
I said that she...
you know I don't want youthinking about things like that.
I'm sorry.I didn'T. I'm sorry.
It's okay. It's okay.
Go on and run upto your room.
Read the comics I got you.
And,caleb?
If I ever catch you lookingat that van de kamp girl,
I'll hit you twice as hardas I hit your brother,
and I won't feel bad about it.
Okay?
Okay.
So this wholesplenectomy thing--
you feelgood about it,huh?
Yeah,yeah,I told you.It's a routine surgery.
You're gonna be fine.
Right,right.
Actually,I sort of meant,um...
do you personallyfeel confident?
What do you mean?
Well,you know,you're gonna be...
hacking into me,
and I just wanted to make surethat you feel ready.
I've never taken outa spleen before.
But believe me,it's no big deal.
Spleen,gallbladder--it's all the same.
Okay,red flag! See,I didn'tgo to medical school,
but I'm thinking--not all the same.
Susan,I know what I'm doing.You're gonna have to trust me.
I would like to.But I gotta be honest--
the fact that you can't evencut that steak isn't helping.
That's not fair.You overcooked it,
and,frankly,it's not the freshest meat.
Well,neither am I.I've got 35 years on that cow.
Wait,susan,are you saying you don't want meto be your surgeon?
I'm sorry.
I don't mean this to soundthe wrong way. I just...
I would be more comfortablewith an experienced surgeon.
That's okay. I understand.
Thank you.
I should really be going.
What?
I didn't evenserve dessert yet.
You said you understood!
No,I do,I do.I respect your decision to see another doctor,
but you know what?
You need to respectthat my feelings are hurt.
What? You want me to putmy life on the line to service your ego?
I save lives every day.I cut. I save. I cut. I save.
That's what I do,and if that gives me an out-of-control ego,
well,maybe I need that to cut intoanother human being.
jim...
hey.Hey.
Dinner's ready.
So did you call around?Check on my references?
I told edyou were my husband,
and he was cool with that.
He really wants to hire you.
So who am ito stand in the way?
Really? So I got the job?
On one condition.
If you take this job,
you are never allowedto bring up
what happened beforewith your promotion.
That's it? Deal.
No,it's not a deal.I need a solemn vow
that you will never throwthat in my face ever again.
Because if you do,you will unleash demons
that you do not wanna meet.
I get it.
And what i really need from you...
is to be forgiven.
Actually,I already haD.
This dinner is really good.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- Hi,betty.
- Hello.
I wanted to talk to youabout what happened the other day with the kids.
I told you,we will be moving soon.
There's nothingto worry about.
Well,my fear is thatif we keep them apart,
they'll try that much harderto be together.
I mean,you knowhow teenagers can be,and,
well,a lot can happenin a couple of weeks.
I'll make a deal with you.
If you control yours,I will control mine.
Well,how about someold-fashioned chaperoning?
That way they can,um,still see each other,
and we won't have tobe the villains.
When it comesto my son's best interests,
I'm not afraid of beingthe villain.
I assumed that you wouldfeel the same way,bree.
Now that you mention it,I guess I do.
I have to go. I have some,um,muffins in the oven.
Mom,what's wrong?
It's the applewhites. I don't want you to go near them.
What?!
Do you remember the manthey arrested--
the one that brokeinto gabrielle's
and escapedfrom the mental hospital?
He's there.
I saw him in their window.They're hiding him.
You're kidding.No,I'm not.
And I forbid youto go over there.
Lynette,hi,it's bree.Uh,listen,
call me when youget this message,
and please cometo poker tonight.
I have some big newsabout the applewhites.
All right,bye.
Who was that?
Sister mary.
They just transferred her toa parish in fairbanks,alaska.
You're kidding me. Why?
She doesn't know.
The diocese wouldn't evengive her a reason.
Ah,vatican politics.
What's wrong?
I think I'm just coming downwith a migraine.
Oh,well,maybe youshould go lie down.
I'm gonna be outfor a while.
All right.
Uh,I'll see you there.
Susan?What are you doing here?
We need to talk.
Okay,all right,but,look,I just got out of surgery.
I've been waitingfor three hours.
After you stormed outthe other night,
I started to doubt myself.
I started to think,
"gee,you know,maybe I shouldjust ignore my better instincts,
and I should let dr. Ron gut me like a fish."
- Susan--
- I mean,why not?
'Cause all my life,
I have jumped through hoopsto keep men from leaving.
But I'm not doing it anymore.So tough luck,pally.
You just missed outon a good thing.
Susan...
you've been herefor three hours?
Yeah.Well,two hours ago,
flowers,champagneand an apology note were deliveredto your doorstep.
Really?
Look,I put our relationshipat risk,all right?
And it was stupid.
I haven't felt this wayabout somebody in a long time.
Susan,I really like you.
And because of that,I...
I can't be your doctor,let alone,your surgeon.
I mean,there's a pretty good reason why they make those rules.
Listen,I hopeyou forgive me,all right?
Because I'll hate myselfif I lose you.
I wouldn't want youto hate yourself.
No.
And I am so sorryabout that... snap thing.
I was just tryingto be theatrical.
I got your note.What's going on?
Are you hidingsomeone in your house?
What?
My mom saw someone inyour second-story window.
She thinks it's the guywho broke into mrs. Solis'.
Damn it,caleb.
Is that his name?
Has she told anybody else?
She left messageson her friends' machines.
They're coming oversoon to get details.
We're gonna have to leave tonight.
- This is--
- why? What's going on?
I would loveto tell you,believe me,I would.
But I can'T.
If you trust me,I could help you.
My familyhas secrets,too.
What my brother did--
it's bad.
Last year my brotherdid something really awful,
and my parentscovered it up for him.
If anyone were toever find out,
andrew and my momcould go to jail.
So you don't have to worryabout me judging you.
Tell me your secrets.I'll understand.
Okay.
But you tell meyours first.
What are you doing here?
I heard you werebeing transferred so I cameto say good-bye.
Come to gloatis more like it.
No,we've hadour differences,
but that doesn't meanI'm happy to see you shipped off to alaska.
Brr.
You had something to dowith this,didn't you?
Me? Oh,I'm justa humble sinner.
You're the one withall the power around here--
all the... annulment mojo.
Is that why you did it?
Well,getting rid of meisn't gonna change anything.
Carlos will do what he wants.
The problems in your marriagearen't going away.
Maybe not...
but you certainly are.
You missed a spot.
That was a mistake.
There.I think we're all done here.
Oh,my god!Oh,my god! Hold on!
Are you okay?
Stop fighting!
Stop fighting! No!
What the hellwere you thinking?
Uh,depends.What have you heard?
I got a callfrom the church.
They said you attackedsister mary.
Yeah,that's about right.
What are you thinking?
I wasn't,but I was thinkingabout it on the way over here.
And I realized the assI should be kicking is yours.
- Mine?
- Yes!
Sister mary manipulated youinto threatening me,
but you're the idiotthat fell for it.
I was notthreatening you.
I was asking for a promise.
You made me a promise,carlos,
a long time ago--till death do us part.
And one day you just come homeand start throwing words around like annulment.
How do you thinkthat makes me feel?
Okay,I'm sorryabout that.
I need to have a child.
And I need to knowI'm the woman you want to spendthe rest of your life with,
not just some uterusin high heels.
Gabrielle,please--
no,carlos,I am sorry.
I am not gonna be blackmailedinto giving birth.
You have to choose.
And I wish you would do itso I can move on with my life.
Well,of course I choose you.
I think that'sthe right decision.
You know,I made a decision,too.
The answer to your questionearlier is yes.
Yes...
I wanna have a baby.
I wanna havea baby with you.
betty.
What a surprise.
Can I talk to youfor a moment?
Uh,now is actuallynot a good time for me.
I think it is.
I wanted to chat with you before you didsomething foolish.
I don't knowwhat you mean.
The person you sawat my house today
is my other son.
His name is caleb.
He didn't harm gabrielle,
and he didn't hurtthe man in the car trunk.
That's all you need to know.
He's your son?
He's my dear sonwho happens to be slow.
Sometimes he makes mistakes.
But,betty,the policeare looking for him.
He escaped from that facilitythey sent him to.
He had help,trust me.
I've always thoughtthe maternal instinct
is one ofnature's most amazing gifts.
I mean,the length thatsome mothers will go to to protect their children--
it drives ordinary womento do extraordinary things,
women like me,bree,and like you.
What are you talking about?
If you breathe one wordof caleb's existence to anyone,
I will tell carlos,gabrielle and the police
that it was your sondriving the car
that killed juanita solis
and that you have been coveringup his crime ever since.
We're going to begreat friends,bree.
We have so much in common.
So is that all she said?
Yeah,something aboutthe applewhites.
I'm dying of curiosity.
it's rude to keeppeople waiting.
Hi. Come on in.
So,spill it.
What's the scoopon the applewhites?
Um,about that... um...
oh,bree,come on,dish already!
Well,perhaps I gotmore excited than I should have,
but I recently found outthat betty applewhite
is quite the poker player,
and so,uh,I have invited herto join our weekly game.
Hello,everybody.
I hope you broughtyour checkbooks because I am feeling lucky.
Everyone understands the nature of war.
I raise.
We also understand that victory depends on the cards
that we have been dealt.
Some,when faced with a bloody battle,
simply give in.
But for some,surrender is unacceptable.
Well,bree,what are you gonna do?
Even though they know it will be a fight...
I'll raise you.
...To the death.
