I'm gonna die,
and I'd like to know
what happened to my daughterbefore I do.
When it comes to wisteria lane,
there are old crimes...
new crimes...
as soon as it gets dark,we get rid
of that body.
And crimes that are happening...
right under everyone's nose.
I'm thinkingit's the applewhites.
Jim halverson was aware
that he had little to offer a woman.
He was neither rich,nor smart,nor handsome.
Are you jim?I'm susan mayer.
So when his friend set him up on a blind date
with a beautiful stranger...
wow,you're so much hotterthan nikki said you'd be.
How old are you?
How olddo you think I am?
Jim made the tragic decision to try to be funny.
Not a day over 50.
why don't weget our table?
Well,no,see,that was funny,
because you'reso obviously not 50.
That's why I said 50,'cause it's absurd.
Jim did everything he could to get
susan mayer to laugh.
He tried racial humor...
so guess what time chinesepeople
go to the dentist?
2:30.
uh,get it?"Tooth-hurty?"
Tooth-hurty.
I love that.
He tried to be engagingly risqu?..
rectum?Damn near killed him!
you know whata rectum is,right?
he even tried gentle teasing.
No,no,you see,by comparing you to a nazi,
I was making the pointthat you're
so not a nazi.
-You're like the--
-and just when jim
thought the date couldn't get any worse....
...It did.
Okay,jim,I need you to look up...
and down.
All right,so,how did this happen?
It was an accident.
Oh,I don't knowabout that.
In some cultureshead-butting is
a mating ritual.
Dr. Mccready,can italk to you
about my head?
Away from...the draft?
you can call medr. Ron. Everyone does.
dr. Ron...
I need you to pretendthere's something
wrong with me and admit me for the night.
I'm sorry?
This is the worst dateI have ever
been on in my life.
That man is the most obnoxious,
offensive,annoying human being.
And you're looking at melike
I'm crazy right now,
but I will be if I spendone more
second with him.
So you gotta help me.You gotta do something.
It's my mental health.My mental health!
You took an oath.
Could you let goof my lapel,please?
Oh,sorry.
Um,listen,I'm sorryyour date's
not going well.
But I can'tadmit you,susan.
Right. Right.
Jim,let's,uh,let's takea look at
those reflexes.
Okay,I got a jokefor you,doctor.
What's the correct medical term
for the circumcisionof a rabbit?
Hare cut.
I don't--I always--
jim,I'm gonna needto keep you here
for awhile,run some tests.
Really? I--
yeah,I'm still worried about
that bump on your head here.
That's still...
and,susan,
you're good to go.
And though it only lasted a moment,
jim caught the look that passed
between his date...
and his doctor.
Thank you so much,dr. Ron.
And he suddenly got the feeling
the joke was on him.

Desperate Housewives
Season 02 Episode 12
The annual blood drive was
a tradition on wisteria lane.
Most residents came to help
promote health and well-being,
but my friends turned up
for a different reason.
They were growing
increasingly concerned
that their street was infected
with a dangerous kind of sickness.
And they came to consult
with one another about a possible cure.
great,
she caught me staring.
Have you guys noticed
how friendly betty's been
since that body was found
in front of her house?
I don't trust
friendly women.
That's okay.
They don't trust you,either.
I just know those two have
something to do with that dead body.
Do we even know
who he is?
Well,the paper said the police
are withholding the details.
Bree,maybe you should call in a favor
from your police detective pal,
have him poke around.
That's a great idea.
You could have him do a background
check on the applewhites.
I don't think
I can do that.
Why not?
You said he was nice.
Well,once he stopped suspecting me of
murdering rex he was delightful,but,um...
I don't really know him.
Well,somebody has to do something,
'cause I'm losing sleep.
Betty! Matthew.
Hello,everybody.
Susan,a little birdie told me
you're having a birthday soon.
We should all go out
and celebrate.
Super.
Sounds like a plan.
Count me in.
bye.
See ya.
So why are you everybody's
best friend all of a sudden?
If there was ever
a time to be neighborly,
this is it.
We're idiots for staying here.
I mean,we should've hit the road
as soon as they found monroe's body.
I mean,how do we know he didn't tell
foster where we're hiding?
Because if he had,foster
would've shown up by now.
And besides,if we take off,
what are we gonna live on?
I have all of our money
tied up in this house.
So why not
just sell it?
Patience,matthew.
If we take off right away,
it'll look suspicious.
Now what we need
is a story--
a reason for us to move.
Look at this,a-b negative.
Yeah,it's the rarest
of all blood types.
Well,there must be something
in the water around these parts.
You're my second
a-b negative today.
Seriously?
Uh,who was it?
That guy.
Hi,bree.
Oh,hi.
I just wanted to thank you
for your advice on my azaleas.
They're just thriving.
Oh,it was
no trouble at all.
Such a shame I may not
be around to enjoy them.
Well,my mother has taken ill.
And matthew and I,
we'll probably go and visit her.
We may even be moving.
We just don't know yet.
Oh,well,
where does she live?
Oh,back in chicago.
Is it serious?
I-I don't know yet.
Well,obviously,I'll be
speaking with her doctor.
Oh,betty,if there's anything I can do,
anything at all...
thank you.
You've already
done so much.
Bye.
That dr. Ron called.
He needs to see you
for a follow-up appointment.
He needs to see me
or he wants to see me?
Jeez,mom,how cute
is this guy?
Oh,he could be cuter...
but I don't know how.
So ask him out.
Oh,no,
I can't do that.
Mom,he's a cute surgeon.
What's the problem?
He's young.
Young?
Younger than me.
How much younger?
Let's just say if I was
a senior in high school,
I'd be saying,"wow,
you're a hot fifth grader."
Oh,well,of course it's gonna sound
gross if you say it that way.
But you're both adults.So why not
just ask him out?
'Cause the conversation
could go something like this,
"dr. Ron,I think you're hot."
"Oh,well,thank you,ma'am.
"Now I think it's time we talk
about your hip replacement."
Mom,you're hot
and funny and nice.
And... clearly desperate,
and guys are into that.
Play to your strengths.
Thank god you're home.
What's wrong? Pat said youtold
her it was an emergency!
The boys weresent home from school.
What? Why? I called.The machine kept picking up.
I know. I know.Look,I...
they've got chicken pox.
Chicken pox?That's the emergency?
They'retotally contagious.
Not to us.
They are to me!I've never had it.
Well,you nevertold me that.
You know,the point is,I can't go in there.
It's a hot zone.
Well,tom,somebody'sgotta take care
of our kids.
Exactly.
And since you're immune--
oh,you've gotta be kidding!I have
to get back to work!
Just for a couple of days,until
they're not contagious.
It is not the ebola virus.It's chicken pox.
You are being a baby.
Yes,I am.
Okay.
And if you thinkI'm being a baby now,
do I need to remind youof what
I'm like when I'm sick?
Remember that timeI had strep throat?
We wound upin marriage counseling.
I'll call the office.
Thanks,honey.
Uh,mrs. Solis,I gotta talk to you.
Ralph,if this is about luis
overwateringthe hydrangeas again,
I told you,
no one likes a tattletale.
My wife left me.
Oh,I'm sorry.
I didn't know you and bonitawere
having problems.
We weren't.
Uh,it was all of a sudden.
She just packed her bagsand left.
She said I have an illness,
and I need to get help.
Why?
There's nothingwrong with me.I just
like to look atpretty ladies on the internet.
And sure,they're not always dressed,
and sometimes,there's more than one.
But I only go tothe classy web sites.
There's some really sick stuffout there,
mrs. Solis.
Ralph!
Make your point.
Um,last night,uh,I found this new web site.
And there wasa picture of a lady
sitting on a bearskin rug
with nothing on except for a little
pointyelf hat. It was very festive.
Uh,ralph,why are youtelling me this?
I'm sorry.It's just,um...
ahem. I think you reallyneed to see this.
Oh,my god!
The lighting looks greaton you,mrs. Solis.
I mean,most of the time,you have to squint
at the screen to see anything really good.
And not here,no,sir,that's good.
Well,um,thank you,ralph,
for bringing thisto my attention.
Uh,mrs. Solis,I was wondering...
would you sign that for me?
Oh,okay.
where have you been?
Why didn't you cometo see me?
I came every sunday.
You were just too out of it to
know I was here.
I think you're lying.
But then again,these days,
I think everyone'sbeen lying to me.
The thing is,you're here now.
So tell mewhat I wanna know.
Did you find the manwho killed my daughter?
It was a guy namedtodd forrest--
this lowlife drug dealer.
He got her hooked again.
She tried to steal from him,and he killed her.
And I killed him.
I thought hearing thatwould make you happy.
I thought it would,too.
But it doesn't.
I'm sorry.
I wanna start your I.V.,But your
veins are kinda bad.
Well,here,let me help you.
What the hellare you doing?
You're crazy!
You're fired.Get out.
So I guesswe're done then?
Yeah.
You,uh...
you gonna come see me again?
You planning on havingan open casket?
Hey,guys.
Hi,lynette.
Hi,carlos.
All right! A reuben?How sweet is that?
Lunch brought rightto the golf course.
I hear you got somepretty
sick kids in there.
Oh,it's justchicken pox.
But braveheart here will onlycome
in to sleep and shower.
I can't say I blame him.
I wouldn't want to beshooting blanks either.
Be well,my man,
Bye,lynette.
See you later.
I'm sorry,what did he mean,"shooting blanks"?
Oh,it's nothing.
There's justa small chance
of sterility if a grown mangets
chicken pox,so...
we're not having any more kids.
Why would it matter?
I don't know.You know,survival instinct?
So that if you're the last manto
survive a nuclear holocaust,
you could repopulatethe planet?
No,all I'm saying is that,
god forbid something wereto
happen to either one of us,
I'd want either one of usto have,you know,options.
So you're sayingthat if I died...
you would want a second wifeand a family?
Maybe.
I can't believe you'veactually
thought about this!
Haven't you?
Thought about who I'd marryif you died?
Hmm. No.
Well,honey,it's a back-upplan.
I'm not gonna use it.
Then why have it?
Well,I don't know,because...
it's like,there's this door,right?
And I'm not planning on
actuallygoing through it
because I'm so happyin the room
that I'm in.
But in case of fire or flood,
it's comforting to knowthat
the door is unlocked.
Honey,I'm notthrough with that!
Yeah,well,why don't you have your
second wifemake you lunch,okay? Oops!
You...
bree,uh,
I have to say,I was,uh,
I was very pleasedto get your call.
I mean,I'm surprised you'd wantto
have anything to do with me
given our recent history.
Oh,you mean your having suspected me
of murdering my husband?
Detective,that is allwater under
the bridge now.
I am very gladto hear you say that.
Although,I have to confess,I do
have an ulterior motive.
I need to ask you a favor.
Oh,well,shoot,whatever I can do.
We have these,um,new neighbors--
the applewhites.
It's a mother and her son. They
just moved here from chicago.
And they seem very nice.
But there's--
there's something about themthat'S...
off.
They're...
odd.
Odd?
Yeah,they're secretiveand watchful.
And there was a dead bodyfound
in front of their house.
I can't run a background checkon
your neighbors for being odd.
Is that why youwanted to see me? To--
to ask me that?
Yeah,why?
Well,I just--during the investigation,
I just thought there wasa kind of a,um...
spark between us.
You know,I thoughtthis might be a date.
Uh,no.
I just wanted to ask you a favor.
Fine,no harm done.
When do I ever getto have lunch
with sucha lovely lady anyway?
Date or...
no date.
Are you sure that you can'tcheck
on the applewhites?
I mean,I just knowthat there's
something there.
And,you know,I havea sixth sense
about people.
And yet,you got engaged to the man
who murdered your husband.
Well,your blood pressurelooks fine.
You're free to go,mrs. Mayer.
You mean,I'm notgonna see dr. Ron?
Well,I do the follow-up exams.
Dr. Ron only comes inif there's a problem.
Oh,well,maybe I shouldgo ahead
and see him anyway,
just to be safe.
I'm sorry.
Dr. Ron's scheduleis very tight today.
So unless you'rehaving a serious problem...
you're experiencing nausea,
chills and tingling,huh?
Yeah,
but nowthat I think about it,
I bet it's justall the coffee I drink.
I drink way too much coffee.
Do you liketo drink coffee?
Uh,no.No.
So the tingling is inyour fingers
and your toes?
I should switch to juice.I know
the best juice place.
You would love it.Do you drink juice?
Susan,how oftenhave you been having
these involuntary muscle spasms?
Oh,oh,not that often.
I probably just needa good massage.
Susan?
Yeah?
I wanna get you infor an M.R.I.
no,I don't thinkthat's necessary.
Are you a doctor?
I got high marksin math and science.
I wanna get you infor an M.R.I.
No,no,no,I think giventhe misunderstanding
that I should get the bill.
I won't hear of it.
All right,
we'll split it.
Fair enough.
You know what?
Let me,uh,let megive you a ride home.
Detective barton,is this somesort of high
school ployto get me back to your place?
I just don't thinkyou should be
driving a car.You've been drinking.
I had two glasses of wine.
Three,plus the tawny portwith dessert.
It's all here on the bill
if you wanna take a look.
You know what?
I politely rejected you,
and now you're getting your revenge
by embarrassing me.
You've had too much to drink.
Give me your keys.
I am not giving you anything.
Except the bill.
what do you thinkyou're doing?
I followed you to make sureyou were okay.
You were weaving.
Please step outof the car.
Oh,you can't be serious.
Out.
Detective,I am not drunk,and
I am not stupid.
I know exactlywhat this is all about.
I'm gonna need you to takea sobriety test.
A sobriety test? I'm nottaking
any sobriety...
test.
This behavior stems fromthe hurt feelings
of a man withvery low self-esteem.
The worldis a big place,
and I'm sure there isa woman out
there somewhere who'll respond to your
macho posturing.
Well...
here's hoping.
Baby,what you're about to see
will most likely shockand upset you.
Okay.
Remember scott,the photographer
I was dating when we met?
The one I dumped for you,
who never really got over it
and who I always said
was gonna get back at me?
Oh,carlos,I love you so much.
Move.
What is this?
Scott's web site,
with pictures of me on it.
well,say something.
Oh,my god.
It wassupposed to be funny--
a naughty little christmas gift
for my boyfriend.
Oh,my god!
I know,I was freakishlyflexible back then.
I'm sorry!
Look,what are we gonna doabout this?
I guessI'll call my lawyers.
I gave these pictures to himas a gift.
He owns them.
Then I guesswe're screwed.
Not necessarily.
See,here's what I'm thinking--
scott's a coward,
so you could totallyput the scare into him.
All you gotta dois go and rough him up,
and he'll take my picturesoff
the web site like that.
I'm sorry,but thisis your mistake.
You're gonna have tofix it yourself.
And I would love to,
but I have the upper bodystrength
of a kitten.
I need a brute!
Gaby,
I am just now starting
to get my rage issuesunder control.
This brute doesn't swingthat way anymore,
so go find another.
Well,when you left prison,
did they leave youa contact list?
So is dr. Ron gonnabe here for this?
Oh,yeah,yeah,yeah.
Uh,there's a hookon the wall there
so go aheadand get your stuff hung up
and,uh,just get comfy. Dr. Ronshould
be here pretty soon.
Okay.Okay.
is she tryingto put on the dust cover?
yep.
How long are we gonna let this go on?
Just a fewmore minutes.
Hi,uh,susan?
It's dr. Ron.
You don't have toget undressed for this.
Oh,uh,I-I,uh...
then why did youput out a gown?
No,no,it's not a gown.
It's the dust coverfor the M.R.I. Machine.
This should takeabout 45 minutes.
Now I know it's really crampedand
uncomfortable in there,
but try not to move.
Susan,I realizethat this whole process
must be troubling for you.
Yeah,it's prettytroubling.
Well,we're gonna getto the bottom of this.
And I'll be herefor you,okay?
Hey,dr. Ron?
I just have a feeling
that everything'sgonna turn out fine.
And when it does...
I'd like to buy you dinner
to celebrate my health.
You know,I was thinkingmaybe italian?
Oh,what the heck,
maybe we can call it a date.
If you like.
Dr. Ron?
uh,he left awhile ago.
He got a phone callfrom his girlfriend.
Okay.
Thank you.
I'd liketo get out now.
Try not to move.
good morning,luis,ralph.
-good morning,mrs. Solis.
-good morning,mrs. Solis.
Good morning,honey.
Hey,you're talkingto me again.
Well,I thoughtabout what you said--
about the pictures--and you're right.
It was my mistake
and I have to live with it.
What the hellare you doing?!
I'm living with it!
Hey,turn aroundand keep gardening!
Aw,you're so mean.
Put your clothes on right now.
Why? You either careif men leer
at me or not.
And you made it clear thatyou don't.
So what's the point?
Gabrielle,I am not beatingthis
guy up for you!
Then you better think of anotherway to
get my pictures back.
Because if you don't,people on wisteria lane
are gonna be seeinga lot more of me!
Ralph,luis,feast your eyes!
My finger!
I'll find it!
Aah,my finger!
It's gotta be here somewhere.
I'll look for it,man.
Don't worry,man.
-I'll find it.Oh,
-my finger!
Hey,honey,
good news.
I checked on penny,
and she didn't scream.
I think she's getting usedto the mask.
I don't want youto have options,tom.
If I die,I wanna hearyour life would be over.
I want you to spendthe rest of
your life screaming,
"it should've been meon that plane!"
-Plane?
-I'm assuming there was a crash.
It could've been something else.
Okay,wait,wait,wait,wait.
Do you have any idea
how painful it is to hear about you
even thinkabout your next wife and kids?
I could never do that!
I can't imagine my lifewithout you.
You are my everything!
Honey,you're my everything.
Okay,well,that's easy to say,
but I need youto show me.
How?
With a vasec to me.
Can't I justget you some flowers?
Look,it makesperfect sense.
We're not gonna haveany more kids.
And the pill just makesme bloat.
It'll be great!
No,okay,lynette,
this is crazy.
Oh,I know! I know!
But it is whatmarried people do.
They go out of their way to calmeach
other's irrational fears.
Oh,come on,tom.
I really need youto do this.
Well,okay.
Fine,yeah.
I'll make an appointment.
Thank you.
can I ask yousomethin'?
I'd rather you didn'T.
How'd you get started?
-Started?
-You know,
in the escort business?
I beg your pardon.
I bet the guys go crazywith
your whole...
classy,repressed thingyou
got going on,huh?
I mean,your skin has,like,
no pores.
I am not sure,but I think there
wasa compliment in there somewhere,
so thank you.
But I am not an escort.
How much you chargea night?
Look,I'M...
$5,000.
What do you have to doexactly for 5 grand?
All right.
Your bail cleared.You're free to go.
Your car'sat the impound lot.
And you can pick it upin the morning.
Well,how am I supposed to get
home? I don't have any money.
Call a friend.
I have been through enoughhumiliation
for one day.
I hope you have a bettersuggestion than that.
Okay,well,let me think,um...
walk.
oh,for goodness sakes!
bree?
Is everything okay?
Oh,oh,I'm fine.I just,um,had a flat tire.
It's your lucky day.
I'm a whizat changing tires. Hop in.
You know,thank you,
but I think it's actuallysomething
more mechanical.
My car has been makingjust a terrible noise.
Well,I have auto club.
Come on.
Actually,
my car has beenimpounded by the police.
Thanks,betty,and,um...
I'd appreciate itif you could keep
this little incidentto yourself.
I won't say a word.I swear.
Well,that's good to hear,
because most people on thisstreet
couldn't keep a secret
if their lives depended on it.
Well,bree,
even if everyone does find out,
it's no big deal.
I mean,lots of peoplehave D.U.I.S.
Yes,but the difference ismost of those people
were actually drunkwhen they were arrested.
I was not.
Well,of course.
You know,you sound likeyou
don't believe me.
Well,um,it's just...
I know you've gone througha lot lately--
the death of your husband,problems
with your son.
It would only be naturalif you
did self-medicate.
I'm sorry,but sincewhen do you know
so much aboutmy personal life?
Bree,
it's like you said--
the people on this street arenot
great at keeping secrets.
Except for you.
You're reallygood at it.
I beg your pardon.
Well,you moved into your housein
the middle of the night.
God knowswhat you moved in
that you didn't wantanybody to see.
People hear soundscoming at all
hours from there.
And,oh,what was the last one?Oh,right--
they found a dead bodyin front of your home.
Everybody talks aboutthe applewhites,
but nobody can figure out
exactly what you peopleare hiding.
So congratulations.
Your secrets are safe...
for now.
Edie?
Hi,it's betty applewhite.
Yeah,I'm sorryto call you so late but,um...
I really need to meet with
youfirst thing in the morning.
Yes.
Well,I've decidedto sell my house.
Dr. Ron?
What are you doing here?
Uh,we need to talk.
And it's not the kind of talkwe
can have over the phone.
Oh,are you sure?
Um,becauseI would look a lot better
over the phone right now.
Um,susan,your,uh,your test results came back.
And for the life of me,I can't figure it out.
Now based on the--on the symptoms
you were describing--
symptoms?
Yeah,the dizziness,the tingling,
the muscle spasms,
the chills--it could be neurological.
It also could be basedon an
autoimmune disorder.
I just--frankly,I'm stumped.
Oh,no,no,no,no.
Hey,listen,we're gonnaget through this,okay?
I am so sorry.
But I'm not sick.
What are youtalking about?
your nurse wouldn'tlet me see you,and I...
really wanted to see you,
so I sort of fakedall my symptoms.
The dizziness,the chills,you know,
all of it.
Why--why would youdo something like that?
What the hellis wrong with you?
I know. I know.I feel really awful.
I am just not the bestat meeting men.
And I thought you were cute,
and I sort of thought that maybe
you thoughtI was cute,
and you're a doctor,and that's so sexy.
So I was up all nightworried sick
digging through medical books,
trying to figure outsome mysterious disease
that doesn't really exist?
Really?You were up all night?
Yes.
I don't enjoytelling people
I thinkthey're going to die.
Especially not
people I like.
You like me?
Yes.
What about your girlfriend?
-What girlfriend?
-The one who calledin the M.R.I. Room?
We had one date. She wanteda
referral to a dermatologist.
She's got eczema.
Maybe we couldgo out sometime?
Do you like sushi?
I love sushi.
I'm available tomorrow night.
No,no,no,tomorrow's no good.
I'll still be angry.
I should be cooled downby friday.
Oh,uh,friday's good.
Oh,there's one thing--
your M.R.I. Showed that you
havea wandering spleen.
A what?
It's a wandering spleen.
It's no big deal.
Sometimes the thing just
moves around in there.
But we'll keepan eye on it.
Wandering what?
Okay,
go get him,tiger.
I can't do it,gaby.
What?
I can't go in there.I thought I could,
but I can'T.
You promised!
Ever since I got outof prison,
I've been tryingto lead a better life.
And for the first time,I can honestly say
that I'm a good catholic,
and I don't want to ruin that.
So do this today and go toan
extra long mass tomorrow.
It doesn't workthat way.
Okay,
look,I'm really trying
to understandyour moral dilemma here,I am.
But if you don't getmy pictures back,
I'm gonna be humiliated.
You think our gardener
is the only local pervsurfing the web?
I'm sorry,gabrielle.
You used to go crazy
when men would so muchas
look at me the wrong way--
and that's whenI had clothes on.
I'm trying to bebetter than that now.
Or maybe you just don't love
meas much as you used to.
Why can't you just let mebe a good person?
You know,if you really loved me,
you wouldn't even ask meto go in there.
If you really loved me,
I wouldn't have to ask!
fine,forget it.
Really?
Be a good person.
Knock yourself out.
It's not thatI don't love you. I--
yeah,okay,look,let's just go home.
What are you doing?
I'm gettingyour pictures back.
I'm not gonna hurt him.
I'll talk to him,
appeal to his better nature.
Can I help you?
I'm carlos solis.
You have,uh,naked picturesof
my wife on your web site.
You're,uh...
gabrielle's husband?
well,you know what?
I was just aboutto take those off anyway.
That's great.
I reallyappreciate this,scott.
Hey,no problem.
To tell you the truth,gabrielle's pages
weren't exactly raking inthe big bucks for me.
I find thathard to believe.
I'm not saying gabrielle's nota pretty girl.
Of course she is.But,uh,
she ain't exactlyinternet pretty,you know?
What does that mean?
The web's about fantasy,not fashion.
I mean,guys surfingfor porn,
they don't care how the clothesare
hanging off the body.
They just wanna seethe goods. So,uh,
if little miss nastyain't rocking
some curves...
my wife has a perfect figure.
Don't get me wrong.
Our little gaby knows how to,uh...
work a runway,but,uh,
when it comesto cyber lovin'?
No real man's gonnawaste tissue on that.
There you go.
That's all of 'em.
So we cool now?
now that's my guy.
You're not limping.
Did everything go okay?
I couldn't do it.
What happened?
I don't know.
I got there,I...
I put on the paper gownand I,uh...
I just couldn't do it.
Why not?
It felt likeI was being emasculated.
Oh,please.
I'm serious,lynette.
I don't make the moneyaround here anymore.
I don't providefor you and the kids.
And i wasn't going to let them snip out the l
ast thing that make me feel a man
Staying home and taking care of the kids
doesn't make you less of a man
that's crazy
you expect me to calm your rational fears,
i expect you to calm mine
Are you saying you are not happy ?
A little bit yeah
Well what we gonna do about that ?
i don't know
-can we just ?
-no,Lynette
I don't know
hi,it's detective barton,look i feel awful
about what happend the other day,
I was the jerk
so to make it up to you
I did some sniffing around about the dead man
they found in front of your neigbours house
I got some information his name is Curt Monroe
A private detective who lost his license
a couple years ago
Apparently he is from Chicago
I don't if this is helpful but...
years ago,he is apparently from Chicago
I,I don't know if this is helpful but
I just feel terrible about what happened
illness can take on many forms
those of the body are easy to treat
Much more difficult
are the hidden maladies festering in our hearts
the secret diction that consume our soul
and the disease we deny
which affect our judgement
To survive we need to find that special
someone who can heal us
I work so hard on my life,
so hard
Now it's all nothing
i got one daughter i hate who hates me
before her time
No one left for me now
What did I do it for
it was good i
did't feel a thing
XXXXX
XXXXXXXX
But we can never predict
who have the cure for what ills us
XXXXXXXXXXXX
or when they'll show up
But I think we can get along,
just
