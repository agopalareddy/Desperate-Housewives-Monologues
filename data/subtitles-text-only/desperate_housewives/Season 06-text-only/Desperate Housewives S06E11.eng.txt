Previously on Desperate Housewives...
A friendship was torn apart.
I care about my friends.
Sorry you are no longer
a part of that group.
- Need to talk to you.
- What?Here?
Bree's affair was revealed to Orson.
Mona threatened Angie.
You've got till tomorrow to come up with
the rest of the money, or I go to the police.
And then tragedy struck.
Celia!
I'm at the site of a bizarre
accident that happened just hours...
If you watch the news tonight, you will be told all
about a tragedy that occurred on a quiet suburban street.
You will hear eyewitness
accounts of the crash.
You will learn the extent of the damage.
But the news can't
tell you who survived.
Because no one yet knows... For sure.
Oh, Susan, thank God you're here.
I was on my way home. I
got this text from Julie.
- She said a plane crashed onto the lane?
- Yeah.
A single-engine plane that had
to make an emergency landing.
The pilot had a heart attack.
Julie said Karl was taken
away in an ambulance?
Yeah. He's in surgery.
H-how bad is it?
He's gonna make it, right?
There was a lot of bleeding.
The doctors are doing the best they can.
You want to sit down?
Here. H... have a seat.
Come here.
Was anyone else hurt?
Orson... and Mona Clarke.
Yeah, they're still in surgery.
Bree got a little banged up, but
the nurse says she's gonna be okay.
And little Celia might
have a concussion.
Oh... what... what happened?
The plane was headed straight for her, and
Lynette ran over and pushed her out of the way.
You saved her life.
Come on. You would have done the same
thing for my kids. It's no big deal.
No, Lynette, we owe you everything.
So what do we do now?
I guess we just wait and pray.
I think that's a really good idea.
Lynette, are you okay?
I don't know. I just...
I have this terrible pain.
The truth is, no one knows who
survived that tragic plane crash...
Oh, Tom, I think there's
something wrong with the babies.
Or more importantly, who didn't.

Any word about Karl?
Uh, still in surgery.
God, I feel like such a hypocrite.
After that guy cheated
on you, I hated his guts.
Never spoke to him again.
And I was just in the
chapel praying for him.
I know what you mean.
It's pretty complicated for me, too.
With that, Susan began to
think of her marriage to Karl...
how wonderfully it had started...
How they'd been so happy...
Until the day she found lipstick
where she shouldn't have.
Susan then thought of the day she
told Karl to leave, and she wondered...
What if she hadn't?
Wait. Wait! Don't go.
You just kicked me out.
I know.
I put 12 years of my life into this
marriage, and we have a daughter.
We owe it to Julie to
try to work this out.
Aw, Susie.
Don't touch me.
You're still a pig.
Okay, so, um, if we are gonna put this behind us, I need to
know about everyone that you've seen with since we were married.
Everyone?
I don't think this is a good idea.
Karl, I don't want to be wondering, when we go to
a party or a restaurant, "did he sleep with her?"
"Her? Her?"
okay. Well, you found out about Brandy.
Yes.
It was nice to put the
panties with a face.
Go on.
Well, before her... let's see... it
was Amber, the dental hygienist...
Kwan Lee, the massage lady...
Oh, remember when we had cable installed, and
you wondered why we got so many channels for free?
Okay, you know what?
Uh, maybe you were right.
It's good to have some
secrets between a couple.
Why don't you just go
upstairs and unpack your stuff?
I will learn how to swallow my rage.
You are not gonna regret this.
Hey there. I'm Mike Delfino.
Oh, yes.
We met at, um, Mary Alice's funeral.
Uh, your husband told me
you have a clogged sink.
Oh, yeah. Come on in.
So how you liking the
neighborhood so far?
I lit. It seems quiet... friendly.
It is. And safe.
I bet we have the lowest
crime rate in America.
You need to get that?
Nah. Let the machine get it.
It's Susan and Karl.
Leave us a message.
Hey, Suse. It's me. Listen,
I'm gonna be working late.
Don't hold dinner for me.
By the way, the switchboard's gonna
be closed, so don't bother calling.
Love ya.
- He's screwing his secretary.
- Huh?
My husband.
Thinks he's fooling me.
He's not.
I'm sorry.
You know, uh, what would serve him right... to
come home and find me in bed with another man.
- Yeah, I gotta go.
- What's the rush?
Well, I've got to get a
part at the hardware store.
And they close at 6:00.
Oh, my God.
Am I that undesirable?
No, you're very desirable,
uh, i... in... in a big way.
Did you just call me fat?
No. No. I... I think
you're very beautiful.
It's just... you know, you're married.
Right.
Um... I'm sorry.
Look... if you're unhappy, you
should do something about it.
Oh, please. Not another business trip.
Oh, please.
Let it be another business trip.
I tried.
I'm sorry.
That's it?
15 years of marriage, and that's
all I get... two lousy sentences?
I don't know what else to say.
I don't know. How about, um, "hey,
Susan, "thanks for eating nothing
but broccoli and colon cleanser for the last six
months so you could lose weight and look good for me"?
Or, "hey, Susan, thanks for wasting the
best years of your life while I went out
and I banged everything with
a GED and a tramp stamp."
I'm sorry, okay?
But you could've spared yourself all this
pain if you'd just let me go the first time.
You really do deserve better, Susan.
Mrs. Delfino?
Karl didn't make it.
Oh, my God.
If there's anything you need,
we have counselors available.
N... no, I'll... I'll
be fine. Thank you.
I can't imagine what
you must be feeling.
Mostly I'm... I'm feeling grateful.
Bree Hodge was told about the death
of Karl Mayer at 6:12 that evening.
She became so hysterical,
she had to be sedated by 6:18.
It wasn't long before she fell asleep.
And then, she began to dream.
A dream about what her
life would have been like
if Karl hadn't died.
You are so corny!
No deviating from the marriage playbook.
I'm doing it right this time.
Happy?
Karl, you've made me happy in
ways I couldn't even imagine.
Now if it wouldn't be too much trouble,
would you mind pulling down my zipper
with your teeth and taking me on the table?
Nag, nag, nag.
What is it with you women
once you get a ring on?
Mm, and if you're a stickler for tradition,
we could always take it up to our bedroom.
Our bedroom... I like the sound of that.
Well, get used to it... Mm. Because it's
going to be our bedroom for a long, long time.
I meant what I said when I proposed.
Being with you is gonna make
me into a whole different man.
Well, I hope not completely different.
I don't ever want to lose that
sexy beast who swept me off my feet.
Trust me. He's not going anywhere.
Honey, that was fantastic.
Bree!
Oh, my God.
You're supposed to
be catering a wedding.
Yes, clearly this is my fault.
- Courtney?
- I'm so sorry, Bree.
Really, Karl, yoga instructor?
No charge for next month, okay?
Like I'm keeping you!
- Get the hell out of my house.
- She... she's going.
I'm not talking toher!
How could you, Karl? In our own bed?
Yeah, you're right. That was tacky.
I am so sorry.
- Bye.
- I'll call you.
- What?
- Sorry.
Uh, force of habit.
Look, this thing doesn't have to
mean any more than we decide it does.
You made a vow to me, Karl.
Oh, my God. Why did I
think I could change you?
Yeah, I know.
You thought you could turn me into
your personal lapdog, like Orson.
You leave Orson out of this.
Why? I haven't done a thing to
you that you didn't do to him.
Get out of my house!
- The truth hurts, doesn't it?
- Get out.
I didn't know who else to call.
You were his emergency contact.
I'm just a little surprised.
Orson and I hadn't spoken
in nearly ten years.
A... are you sure there wasn't someone
else in his life? A girlfriend maybe?
Never saw one.
In fact, in the seven years he lived
here, I never saw anybody visit him at all.
Um... Where did you... find him?
In the bed.
Paramedics said it was a heart attack.
He'd been there two days.
Can you imagine?
Just like that, you're
gone, and no one notices?
Poor Orson.
Well, take whatever you want. I'll
have, uh, goodwill pick up the rest.
You know, he spoke about you constantly.
It was always "Bree this", "Bree that."
- It was almost like he died of...
- What?
Say it.
Like he died of a broken heart.
Mrs. Hodge?
I just wanted to tell you
your husband's out of danger.
Thank God for that.
But there were some complications.
What kind of complications?
This is a preliminary assessment, but it seems
there has been some damage to his spinal column.
What does that mean exactly?
There's a good chance
your husband is paralyzed.
excuse me.
Can you tell me anything
about Mona Clarke's condition?
The doctors... they did everything they could,
but that woman... I mean, she was hit by a plane.
Oh, my God!
Now all we can do is wait and
hope that she pulls through.
Pulls through?
Yes. Your friend's a real fighter.
She's hanging in there.
How? She got hit by a plane!
The doctors couldn't believe it either.
I don't know if you're religious,
but now would be the time to pray.
Oh, believe me, we will.
Dear God, please take that
blackmailing bitch home now.
A frickin' plane hit her. What
is it gonna take, a silver bullet?
All right, look, I'm gonna go home,
pack up our stuff. You stay here.
If they pry the propeller out of that woman's mouth
and she starts yapping, get the hell outta here.
Just like that, Angie Bolen began
to consider what was happening.
She thought of the doctors trying to save
Mona and how long it might take her to recover.
Then she imagined Mona waking up... And
telling the police everything she knew.
And Angie asked herself, what
would happen if Mona Clarke lived?
How about a little lunch, Ms. De Luca?
Eggplant parm.
Maybe it's not like the place we used to see
you go into on east 10th street, but not bad.
I want to see Nick.
He's a little busy at the moment.
I just want to talk to
him for a couple minutes.
As far as the Bureau is
concerned, Nick is a traitor.
Get used to it. You're never
gonna talk to him again.
What about Danny?
Tyler is with your mother.
But enough about what you want.
Here's what I want... Patrick Logan.
You need to be thinking
real clear right now.
We know Logan ran everything, but
without him, it's all gonna fall on you.
I don't know where he is.
I haven't spoken to
him since that night.
You've been on the run 18 years, and you and your
former lover don't even exchange a phone call, huh?
Don't take this personally, Agent Padilla, but
you guys weren't the ones I was running from.
Look, I know Logan.
I know how scary he is.
But I think the situation
you're in now is worse.
Then you don't know how scary he is.
Federal sentencing guidelines
dictate the punishment in this case.
There's no room for
leniency from the court.
That being said, Ms. De luca, you have indicated
that you would like to address the court.
Thank you, Your Honor.
No one... was supposed to get hurt.
We just believed in something, and we wanted
to make other people believe in it, too.
But someone did get hurt.
A man died.
I read every newspaper article
about your husband, about Sean...
how he coached little league, that the
whole neighborhood came to his funeral.
I never lived in a world like that...
until we moved to Fairview.
I never felt like a part
of a community, which...
Made it so much clearer to me how horrible
it is that I brought so much pain to yours.
Please rise for sentencing.
Angela De Luca, you are hereby sentenced to life
imprisonment without the possibility of parole.
Marshals, remand the
prisoner to custody.
Ma? Ma!
So... how is she?
I'm... I'm so sorry.
She didn't make it.
I know how upset you must be.
Please don't be angry with God
because your prayers weren't answered.
Oh, don't worry about it, hon.
Me and God are good.
I spoke with the doctor. They are goingo
keep her overnight for observation.
I thought they said she was fine.
No, they're just being
extra cautious. That's all.
Look at her.
I feel bad even saying it, with
everything's that's happened,
but... we really lucked out, huh?
I don't think it was luck.
I think it was God.
Actually, it was Lynette.
No, Lynette was his instrument.
Either way, it was a hell of a tune.
No, I'm serious.
I think God saved Celia
because she's special.
She has a gift.
What kind of gift?
I'm not sure yet.
But she has one.
I know she's gonna do
something amazing with her life.
Fine. While you figure out how our daughter's
gonna change the world, I'm going to the cafeteria.
See you in a few.
As she lay there, Gabrielle began to
think of ways her daughter could shine.
She thought of music...
And sports...
And other creative pastimes.
And before she drifted off
to sleep, Gabrielle wondered,
what if her daughter was
destined to be a great actress?
Celia Solis.
How old are you?
5.
It's our first audition.
We're very excited.
Well, great. Such a cutie,
just what we're looking for.
Oh, she can be cuter.
Show him, honey.
Good girl.
Okay, Celia, this is a... here.
This is a commercial
for ouch away! Bandages.
Stand right there on the "T."
You just got a boo-boo on your finger.
You're gonna hold it up,
look real sad and cry, okay?
And go.
No, no. Don't smile, honey.
We need you to cry. Let's try it again.
Uh, okay.
Thank you... thank you very much.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You gotta give her another shot. Please.
I... I love the look, but
can I be honest with you, mom?
The side dish that came with
my lunch has more talent.
What are you saying?
I'm saying she's not as good
as coleslaw. Deal with it.
Hey, that little girl
is here for a reason.
She is going to inspire people,
and you are gonna be part of that!
All right. Well, hurry up.
All right. Hey, I got
you another chance.
Can you cry for mommy?
Sure you can.
When that nice casting man asks you to
hold up a finger, just hold it up and cry.
How easy is that?
Hello?
What?
Oh, my God.
Daddy fell and hurt himself.
I don't think he's gonna make it.
And... when he fell, he landed on your
hamster cage and crushed Mr. McFuzz.
He's dead. Mr. McFuzz is dead.
Okay.
Roll it.
Gaby, I'm going to take
Celia for an ice cream!
Be back in a bit!
Come on.
The bus for camp leaves in 20 minutes.
But what about my auditions?
Mommy's gonna kill us.
Hey, let me handle mommy.
You need a sleeping
bag to get ice cream?
Run!
Leave it. Leave it! Leave it!
What the hell are you
doing? We talked about this.
No summer camp. She's got auditions.
Gaby, you have got her living
in this weird little bubble,
and she needs to be
around kids her own age.
She will be. I'm taking her
to a casting call for "Annie."
Why can't you support her career?
Celia, will you wait in the car, please?
Thank you, sweetie.
Because she stinks.
That little girl is destined for
greatness. That is why God saved her.
God does not save people who stink.
Yeah, well, maybe God saved her so that she could go to
camp and make some friends and have a normal childhood!
Who would believe in a God like that?
Gaby, she's miserable.
No, she's not. She wants this.
No, she does it to please you!
That is a horrible thing to
say. I am not hurting her.
In fact, making her
shine is my life's work.
All I want is for people to
understand how special she is.
- Celia, get in the house!
- Celia, wait.
I'm sorry, but you have clearly lost your mind, and I'm not
gonna stand here and watch you ruin our daughter's childhood.
If you don't like it, leave.
Gaby, be careful what you say,
because I am very close to going.
See ya. Come on.
Let's go get ready for your audition.
You're gonna be the best Annie ever.
There you go, sweetie.
All better.
Ouch away! Adhesive bandages...
They heal with a mother's love.
Mama, no.
Look at that face.
That's a star.
You're not watching this again.
Now please, help me with the groceries.
Did you get my wrinkle cream?
You can't buy stuff like
that with food stamps.
I know. I just wish you
loved me enough to steal it.
Hello?
Jerry, sweetie.
Honey, it's your agent.
Oh, Celia's dying to work.
What do you got for us?
Oh, come on. There's gotta be something.
No, no. She's not too old.
She can pass for 15.
hell, I'm looking at her right now.
Okay, we'll be there.
Baby, we've got an audition.
And we gotta get that
hair into pigtails.
Ma, I think we need to talk.
What did I dowith those ace bandages?
We gotta flatten you down.
Listen to me.
I don't want to be an actress.
What? You can't quit. You're...
I'm special. This is my destiny.
It's why I was spared.
You spent the last 20 years
telling me I'm meant for big things.
And you are.
No.
I'm not special. I'm normal.
And I just want to have a normal
life... get married, have kids.
And there's gonna be
plenty of time for that.
You always say that.
Why can't you admit it's over?
Because if we give up, then everything
I've worked for is for nothing.
Your father walked out.
Your sister never calls.
This is all I have.
What time's the audition?
Tomorrow, 3:00.
Now let's do something about this hair.
Oh, honey, this is the one. I feel it.
One day you're gonna thank me.
I brought you coffee.
So have you figured out what our
4-year-old is gonna do with her life?
No.
But I did figure out what
she has to do to be special.
What's that?
Absolutely nothing.
How could this happen? I know I
fell, but I felt fine afterwards.
It doesn't take much to
cause a tear to the placenta.
But you said the one baby is fine?
Yes, but if we don't
operate on the other one,
there could be a decrease in blood flow to the brain,
which could put the child at risk developmentally.
At risk how? Physically? Mentally?
Right now there's no way to know.
How soon can we do the surgery?
We're ready to go.
Let's get her in.
At that moment, Lynette began to
think of the baby she had yet to meet.
She thought of what it
would be like to hold him,
how it would feel to
look into his eyes...
And to kiss his tiny hand.
And then Lynette thought of what would happen if the
doctor told her that same beautiful child was disabled.
He especially hates
the hamstring stretches.
Well, and obviously it's hard to hear him
cry, but you really need to tune it out,
because without the therapy,
his muscle tone will...
You try. Maybe it's me.
Sometimes it helps to sing to them.
Oh, I do that. He
loves it when I do that.
And the sailor said,
"Brandy, you're a fine girl,
what a good wife you would be"...
Why don't we take a break?
Maybe we should take some time
and talk about where we're at.
Where we're at is we haven't
seen any milestones since August.
Not since he finally
started grabbing his feet.
- But that was a big one.
- Definitely.
But he should be sitting by now, right?
Or pulling to stand or crawling.
If you worry too much about whathe suld be able
to do by now or what other kids his age are doing,
it's gonna drive you crazy.
Fine.
I know I keep saying this, but try
to focus on the progress he's making.
Like what?
You're with him every day.
You tell me.
What do you see?
- Would you, um, excuse us for a second?
- It's okay.
What is it?
- I can't do this.
- Can't do what?
This, her, the therapy, and the
injections and the equipment.
And no one can even tell
us if any of it is helping.
I think it is.
But even if it isn't, this is what
there is to do, so we're doing it.
Well, I can't.
No, you don't want to.
Neither do I.
Neither does he. Didn't you
hear him crying in there?
But we don't have a choice. So come on.
Jean's gotta go home soon.
I feel like I'm being punished,
and I don't even know what I did.
You can't think that way.
What else is there to think about?
Hopes for the future?
He might not even have one.
He's 14 months. Don't write him off yet!
But you should start thinking about the
future, because no matter what, it's coming.
And it's either gonna make
you less afraid or more,
and you willnow that you either did
everything that you can for your son...
Or you will be sorry.
Yeah. There we go.
I know.
Come here.
It's okay.
I can do this.
Hi, honey.
Can I have a sandwich?
Uh, sure.
I just have to finish these dishes.
But I'm hungry.
Well, unless you want soap on
rye, you're gonna have to wait.
Actually, why don't you
make yourself a sandwich?
But you always do it.
And you always watch me,
so I know you know how.
I'm tired.
So am I, and I still have
to vacuum and do the laundry.
My arms hurt.
I had to swim today.
And you do that so you can get stronger,
so you can do things like make sandwiches.
Speaking of which, in the time
we've been arguing about this,
you could've... guess
what... made a sandwich.
So could you!
Jason's mom makes him whatever
food he wants, even french toast.
I would happy to make
Jason french toast, too.
He always tells me how pretty I am.
Not to mention, he's also in a wheelchair,
so he can't reach the shelves in the fridge.
But you can!
Too bad you don't appreciate it.
You're not... you're not really busy!
You just don't want to help me!
You know what? One day I won't be able
to help you because I won't be here,
and then maybe you'll understand why I
wanted you to learn to do stuff for yourself!
Or you won't!
But either way, I'm not
making you a sandwich.
That looks good.
Can I have a bite?
When I was born, my doctor told my parents
I wouldn't make it through the night,
then through the week, then it was that
I was blind, that I'd need a wheelchair.
I guess what I'm saying is...
I've really pissed my doctors off.
At first, my mother was scared...
scared of my disability, my limitations.
I know this because she told me.
Then she realized what
she was really scared of,
was my potential and that she's miss
something that would help me reach it.
Gandhi said, "strength... does
not come from a physical capacity.
It comes from an indomitable will. "
My mother's probably
never heard that saying...
But every day of my life,
she showed me how true it is.
Now I... I hope I can start showing her.
Thank you.
Thank you all very much.
How's our baby?
Is he okay?
We lost the baby.
But... the other baby is fine.
It's okay.
We're gonna be okay.

I don't know how to say thank
you for saving my child's life.
And how sorry I am for...
We were gonne name it Patrick.
And he would have been amazing.
The funeral for Karl Mayer
was a dignified affair.
Attented by friends and family.
And those who loved him.
The priest spoke about
the nature of tragedy.
How it causes people to ask what if...
What if he hadn't died...
What if I had chosen differently...
What if I had made that mistake...
And then the priest said
the best way to honor those who had died
was to focus on what was
and to keep on living
the best way we know how.
And in time, that is exactly
what my friends would do.
