Previously on...
It was a joyous occasion until...
Did I miss anything?
I'm asking you nicely to leave.
If you won't, I will drag you
out of this church myself.
I don't love these babies.
Lynette struggled with her pregnancy.
Stop saying that.
Gaby made a commitment...
I am now officially your guardian.
- And Bree...
- I'm married.
To a man who's blackmailing you.
Jumped in with both feet.
I think we could be happy here, right, Danny?
New neighbors...
Would you like to go to a movie sometime?
Moved in.
Look, Danny, please let me explain.
- Go to hell.
- What's gotten into that kid?
- He's a teenager.
- Go look for him.
And evil made an appearance on Wisteria Lane.
The first time Karen McCluskey saw Roy Bender,
she did something she didn't expect to do.
She smiled.
The next time they met, Roy did
something he didn't expect to do.
He smiled back.
After a week of sly flirtations, Karen and
Roy did something no one expected them to do.
And they did it twice.
With each passing day, Karen began to
feel something she hadn't felt in years,
and she realized she needed to know
if Roy was feeling the same way.
Has it been an hour yet?
14 minutes. Come on. Your doctor
said you need to walk an hour a day.
The little snot nose... I'd like
to drop dead just to piss him off.
Don't even joke about that.
I like having you around. I like it a lot.
You remember to put the seat down.
You can drive at night. A
girl could get used to that.
How many minutes has it been now?
I'm trying to tell you how I feel, Roy.
I didn't expect this. I always thought that...
You just get one big love in this
lifetime, and that was my husband Gilbert.
And after he died, I figured the rest of
my life was about making meatloaf for one.
Then you come along and... well... hell.
I love you, Roy.
Isn't there anything you wanna say to me?
You know how I feel.
A woman needs to hear the words.
All right. Here we go.
What the hell?
Oh, my God! Are you all right?
We gotta call 9-1-1!
For a moment, Mrs. Mccluskey didn't move.
And whether it was her boyfriend's discovery
of Julie Mayer or her realization that
he wasn't going to say the words
she desperately needed to hear,
Karen McCluskey suddenly felt the urge to...

******
It was a shame what happened that day,
considering how nicely the morning had begun.
One neighbor was out reading the sports
section, delighted to see that his team had won.
A child was playing with her new doll,
thrilled to discover just how durable it was.
And a woman was walking
with the man she adored,
determined to say she loved
him for the very first time.
Yes, up until the screaming started, people
thought it was going to be a wonderful day.
Oh, good. You're up.
- Uh, yeah. Good mornin'.
- Good morning.
Did you go to sleep with a
breath mint in your mouth?
This is our first morning waking
up as husband and wife again.
I wanted it to be perfect.
Well, it couldn't be more perfect.
Yes, it could.
Here's a breath mint for you.
Did we really get married last night?
Either that, or we paid a lot of
money to watch our friends get drunk.
- Come here, mrs. Delfino.
- All right.
We have a honeymoon to get started.
Hey, whatcha doin'?
Uh, nothing, sweetie.
Why don't you go play in
your room for ten minutes?
Ten?
I wanna play in here.
Okay. Of course you can.
In fact, I can't think of a better
way to start our new life together...
all of us here, Julie's home.
You know, the last couple years, when I used
to think about what I needed to be happy,
this was it.
This was the picture I had in my head.
Hey, Danny. It's Ana. Did you get my
message about going to the mall later?
Oh, okay. That's cool.
Um, how about tomorrow?
Yeah, me, too. The mall blows.
Well, give me a call if you wanna hang.
Shot you down, huh?
I could get Danny bolen anytime I want.
Okay. Well, let me know if you need any help.
Not that I need your help,
but... what do you got?
Here's the secret to landing
a guy... you have to ignore them.
You are the one who ends the conversation.
You are the one too busy to get together.
- And?
- And that's it.
Trust me, it works. How do
you think I played this one?
- You did not play me.
- Like a fiddle.
You know how many runway shows he sat
through before I would even look at him? Six.
- It wasn't that many.
- Six.
And when he finally asked
me out, I said, "okay."
but then at the last minute,I
backed out, saying I didn't feel well.
- You weren't really sick?
- God, no.
I had a pedicure and then
went to sardi's for drinks.
After that, he was my slave.
- I rented a yacht that day!
- Really? That's hilarious.
A week later, he gave me this.
I lost that deposit!
Eat your waffles! I'm teaching!
- Look at you.
- I know. Martha friggin' stewart, eh?
Hey, Ana. Yeah. I'm... I'm
not much of a-a mall guy.
Yeah. But, uh, I'll see you around, okay? Yep.
- Mornin'.
- Where were you last night?
- Out.
- Yeah, where "out"?
I drove around lookin' for you.
I couldn't sleep. I went a lot of places.
Happy now?
Don't be a wiseass. We were worried about you.
Nick, go take your shower. Go.
12 oranges for a half a cup
of juice? That's worth it.
No, thanks.
Okay, so we're sticking with
the moody teenager thing, huh?
Come on. What'd you do last night?
I already told dad. I went out.
Danny, it's me.
What did I do when peter spadaro pushed
you off the swing set in first grade, huh?
I threw a slushee in his mom's face.
Clearly, I have your back. Talk to me.
I went out drinking.
There's nothing else to do here, mom.
Look... I know this move has been hard on
you, but try to make the best of it, okay?
Trust me, it takes a lot
more effort to be unhappy.
Okay.
Thanks for being honest.
And that's for drinking.
Mom, was that you throwing up
in the bathroom this morning?
Yeah. I was just feeling a little nauseous.
Mm, sick in the morning.
If you weren't so old, I'd say you were pregnant.
Okay, guys, here's the deal.
I had some bad seafood last night.
At the wedding? We had chicken.
I mean after that. I went out
to get gas, and I had... Clams.
I don't even remember where I ate them.
I just remember seeing
this sign that said "clams, "
and I thought, "ooh, I haven't
had clams for a while."
so I went in and had clams, but they
were bad, which is why I was throwing up.
Well, my point was, next time, please flush.
And I'm done with my oatmeal.
What? We said we weren't gonna tell the
kids until after the first trimester.
That's next friday.
Wow, you actually know the day.
Wow, you're really into this.
Well, someone has to be.
I'm not telling anybody until we're
absolutely sure everything's okay.
Really? Are you sure that's the
only reason you're not telling them?
I can't open my eyes all the way. Who is it?
Did someone have too
much wine at the wedding?
I don't know. I was too drunk to notice.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I'm just looking for Bree.
Oh, she's not here.
- Where'd she go?
- I don't know.
I just woke up, and she was already gone.
- She's not in the test kitchen?
- No.
I just wanted to let her know
I'm taking the morning off.
Well, I'm sure she'll understand,
given all you've been through.
What do you mean?
Well, you know, Mike and
Susan getting married.
Oh, I'm not upset about that.
Really? Good. I'm glad.
I mean, it's not as if it's gonna last.
Excuse me?
Oh, Mike doesn't really love Susan.
He just feels sorry for her. He'll be back.
My thoughts exactly.
That... was amazing.
Yeah. Who knew you
were such a wild woman?
I'm not. I've never done this before.
- Well, you are a fast learner.
- No.
I mean, sex for me has always had to have an
emotional, romantic or even spiritual dimension.
I can see now you can take all
of that away and it's still...
Marvelous recreation.
The best there is.
- Except, of course, when you actually tried to...
- I'm sorry.
- I mean, really.
- Well, some people like it.
You've done this a lot, haven't you?
You don't stay this good by skipping practice.
God, you're a pig. Kiss me.
Hold that thought.
Well, that's weird. It's Mike. Hello?
Hey, Karl, listen.
There's no easy way to say this,
but something's happened to Julie.
I mean, she was just lying there.
What if we hadn't found her in time?
Thank god you did.
How could this happen? I mean, Julie's,
like, the nicest girl in the world.
I know. Who'd want to hurt her?
Okay, I gotta go. We'll call you from
the hospital as soon as we hear anything.
Tell Susan and Mike we'll take good care of M.J.
This is insane. How could someone strangle Julie?
I know, and on our property. It could've been me.
I've never had much upper body strength.
I'd love to say he means well, but...
What are you looking at?
Well, this horrible thing happened.
We're all out here trying to make sense of it.
Where are they?
Oh, they were out here... for a minute.
You know, when you think about it, how
much do we even know about these people?
Not much. They're from New York. They have a son...
Danny, who I saw coming out of a
movie the other night with Julie.
Seriously? Like a date?
Sure looked that way.
You know, when women are attacked, the police
look at the husbands or the boyfriends first.
Maybe it's time that we get to know our new neighbors.
Okay, they are all looking at our place, and
I do not think they are admiring our azaleas.
Why are they staring at us?
Oh, let's see.
Uh, we're the new people on the block,
Mrs. Mccluskey saw you fightin' with Julie,
and, uh, this morning,  she turns up almost dead.
What, are you kidding me? I had
nothing to do with that. I like Julie.
Then what were you fightin' about?
Nothin'. It's personal.
You're not gettin' how serious this is.
If that old lady talks to
the cops, we got problems.
Okay, okay.
Danny, just tell me where you went
when you were drinking last night.
I keep trying to remember.
I... I think I was at the park.
I drove by the park. You weren't there.
I drank a lot, okay? It's a little fuzzy.
That's great, Danny, you
know? That's really great.
All right, if anybody asks, let's
just say he was home with us.
No, because if anybody saw him out, we're done.
Maybe the old lady won't talk to the cops.
Uh, maybe I won't need an alibi.
Danny, people are already lookin' over here!
Maybe that is because we are hiding
in our house like guilty people.
Now I am going to make
Susan and Mike a manicott'.
And then we are going to get out
there and start hugging people.
The cops are going door-to-door asking questions.
Won't be long before they're here.
What am I gonna tell them, huh?
The truth... that you saw that
bolen kid fighting with Julie.
Well, it was just a couple of
words. They're kids. They argue.
If I start pointing fingers...
You're just telling 'em what you know.
What if I'm wrong?
I can't have another family
on this street hating me.
Who hates you?
Oh, the gay guys. I've said stuff.
Listen to me.
- You know you've gotta do the right thing.
- Yeah.
But you don't have to do it alone.
I'm gonna be right here with ya. And...
There was something I wanted to say
before, and I didn't get the chance.
If you got hit by a bus, I'd really miss you.
That's it?
Okay. You're showering alone tonight.
All right, I love you. There. I said it.
Do you mean it, or is that just
your beta-blockers talkin'?
We'll find out in an hour.
So you can't think of anyone who
would want to hurt your daughter?
No, I told you. She's a great
kid. Everybody loves her.
Where is that doctor?
He'll be here as soon as he can.
- Was she dating anyone?
- No.
- You sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.
If she was dating somebody, I would know.
He said he would be here.
Mrs. Delfino, I know how difficult this is for you.
Really? Has your daughter been attacked?
Hey, um, you know what?
How about we do this after
she talks to the doctor?
Okay.
Susan! How is she?
We don't know yet. Uh, nobody's talking to us.
Do you need somebody to take care of M.J.?
Uh, bob and lee are watching him.
- Mrs. Delfino?
- Dr. Hill, what is going on?
She's still unconscious.
I'd like to run some tests to make
sure there's no internal bleeding.
- What kind of tests?
- Blood work, some x-rays.
- Um, can... can we go with you?
- Of course.
- Can I talk to you?
- Uh, we really need to move here.
I... I... I don't think you
should give her an X-ray.
Lynette, just let him do his job.
Julie's pregnant.
- What?
- She might be. She's not sure.
What are you talking about?
She told me.
It's no problem. I can give her an M.R.I.
There's no radiation, so it's safer for the baby.
Hey, guys. What's up?
Uh, we're just taking some
food over to Mike and Susan's.
You know, we feel so
awful about what happened.
Nick, you talk to the guys.
- I'm gonna get this over there while it's still hot, okay?
- Okay.
So, nick, after what happened to Julie, we're
thinking of starting up a neighborhood watch.
- Are you interested?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, of course.
Great.
Danny must be pretty shaken up. He's... he's
pretty close with Julie, isn't he?
I think we're all pretty shaken up.
- Weren't they, uh, dating, though?
- No, no, just friends.
Uh, she was helpin' him with some tutoring.
- Really?
- Yeah.
'Cause some people saw
them at the movies together.
Like I said, just friends.
So this neighborhood watch thing...
is there, uh, gonna be a meeting?
Yeah, we'll let you know.
Is this... is this really about
the neighborhood watch?
'Cause it seems like the only
one you're watching is my kid.
Honey! It's your mother.
We're done. Right, guys?
Thanks, hon.
That, uh, didn't look like it was going so good.
Yeah, they were asking about Danny.
It's like you said they would.
Then it is time to get our son an alibi.
Katherine.
I saw you drive in.
Uh, yeah, I just wanted to come home and take
a shower before I head back to the hospital.
Look, I know things have been... awkward lately.
But I heard about Julie,
and I wanted to do something.
Thank you. I know Susan will appreciate it.
- So... How is Julie?
- Yeah, we don't know. They're still doing tests.
Oh, god. I can't imagine
what you're going through.
You have to stay strong, Mike.
Katherine?
Whoa, wait, wait. What are you doing?
Just letting you know I'm here for you.
Anytime.
Come on in.
Ana, there are two detectives here
who wanna ask you some questions.
- What about?
- We're investigating the Julie Mayer assault.
Where were you last night
at approximately 11:00?
Oh, I can answer that. She was in her room.
We have a very strict 10:00 p.m. curfew.
Actually, I was out.
What? I saw you go into your room.
Yeah, and then I climbed down
the trellis and I met a friend.
- Can I borrow your mace?
- Please, ma'am.
My tax dollars pay for
it. I should get to use it.
Who was the friend you met?
- Danny Bolen.
- Wait, Danny Bolen?
- As in the guy who blew you off this morning?
- Yes. He's a friend.
I want him to be more than a friend.
Mr. Bolen said that you
stopped by a liquor store.
No. No, no. She's 16. She doesn't drink.
Yeah, we bought some beer.
How about a taser? You
guys must carry a taser.
Can anybody verify your whereabouts?
Well... Danny.
Okay. Thanks for your time.
You know why kids are like this now?
Because you people won't
let us hit them anymore.
If I find this bastard before the cops do,
he won't need a trial 'cause
I'll kill him with my bare hands.
Look, I know you're mad. I don't
want to hear anger in this room.
We need to stay positive for Julie's sake.
Do we even have a clue who did this?
A jealous boyfriend, maybe?
Was she even seeing anyone?
No, not that I know of.
- Is this a bad time?
- No, no. Come on in.
Oh, how is she?
Still unconscious. We're
waiting for the test results.
- Karl.
- Bree.
You know, I need to talk to
Lynette. I'll be back in ten minutes.
She must never ever know I slept with you.
Bree, my daughter was attacked.
I've got more to worry about
than Susan getting mad at us.
Of course. I'm sorry.
Look, I know we said we'd
get together this week,
but till this all gets sorted
out, I... I need a little time.
I completely understand.
I do want to see you again. Really.
- Just not now.
- Okay.
Dad?
So what did they say?
The doctors still don't
know. But she's not pregnant.
I'm so sorry about that. I
just had to say something.
What made you think that she might be?
She told me.
A few days ago, I was out in my yard.
I was upset.
Julie saw me and asked me what was wrong.
We started talking about stuff, and...
It just came out.
Th... and you didn't just...
just immediately pick up the phone and call me?
She asked me not to.
So who's the guy?
- I don't know.
- She didn't say?
All she said was she'd gotten involved
with someone and that it was complicated.
Complicated? And that's the word she used?
Yeah.
Because..."complicated" means "trouble, "
so you knew that she was in trouble,
and you chose not to come to me?
Like I said, Julie asked me not to.
You are my friend, not hers.
After everything we've been through, I
cannot believe you would betray me like that.
Whoa, that's not fair.
Lynette, my daughter is hooked up to a machine,
and a guy who is complicating her life...
a guy that I didn't even know about... might've
put her there, so I don't need to be fair.
Hey, reggie. Thanks for coming so quickly.
No problem, Mrs. Solis.
How are those two little precious ones?
What?
Oh, my kids. Oh, you threw me off with "precious."
they're the least of my problems.
We've taken in a teenager.
Sorry to hear it.
Yeah, she's been using this to sneak out at
night. That's why I want you to take it down.
She climbed down this trellis?
Yeah, that's what she said.
Okay. It's just that it's pretty beat up.
I wouldn't have thought it could
hold much more than those roses.
But then again, why would
she lie? I'll get my tools.
I'm telling you, she opened her
eyes for at least 10 or 15 seconds.
- She called me "dad."
- I believe you.
Well, what does it mean?
Well, in layman's terms, drifting in and out
of consciousness is better than fully comatose.
Our main concern is the intracranial swelling.
In fact, if she wakes up, we
may choose to induce coma.
Well, why would you do that?
The swelling will heal faster if she's unconscious.
But I'm confident she'll recover.
Thank god. I should find Susan.
Good lord. They need me in the E.R.
Um, before you go, one quick question.
When Julie wakes up, will she remember what she
saw or heard during the brief moment she was awake?
- I don't see why not.
- But people in comas dream, don't they?
She could wake up thinking she saw something
odd when really it was just a bizarre dream.
Not very likely.
Her brain is swollen. That
has to cause hallucinations.
I once thought lauren bacall was in my
bedroom, and that was just a high fever.
Ma'am, there's been a bus crash. I need to go.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Uh, talk to your friend. You may
be surprised what she remembers.
- Liar!
- What?
There is no way you crawled down that trellis,
because I just tried to, and
it collapsed on top of me.
- What's your answer to that?
- I don't know.
Pull back on the carbs
and try again in two weeks?
Wh... Ana, this is serious.
Why would you lie to the cops?
Did Danny ask you to cover up for him?
I'm not covering up anything. Danny didn't do it.
Well, the police think he
did. You don't know this kid.
I know him better than the cops.
You're just mad because
I didn't take your advice.
What are you talking about?
You told me to play hard to
get, which is totally lame.
I figured out a way to make him owe me.
Aiding and abetting?
This is your solution on how to land a guy?
Who are you calling?
- The police.
- No!
Julie Mayer is lying in a hospital bed right
now, and Danny might have put her there.
You're telling the truth.
Bree, you're back.
I brought you your favorite biscotti.
Aw, you are so sweet.
And I hear Julie's doing better.
Much better. She's just sedated now.
The doctors are very optimistic.
Oh, my, that is good news.
You know, I wanted to tell you again
how much I enjoyed your wedding,
especially the part where
you and Katherine made peace.
Well, I'm glad someone enjoyed that.
But you are friends again, right?
I mean, you said all those lovely
things to her in the church.
Yeah, but it wasn't enough for Katherine.
You know, I don't know where she
gets off being the injured party.
She took Mike from me first.
But you and Mike were divorced at the time.
And... and Katherine was very lonely.
Okay, rule number one of the female code...
never sleep with your friend's ex-husband.
Well, uh, perhaps she should've seen
that you still had feelings for Mike.
It would've been different if she'd slept with...
Oh, let's say for instance, Karl.
Karl? Oh, yeah, like that would ever happen.
No, Katherine's a lady.
She's not one of those dumb skanks
that would fall for Karl's come-ons.
So you agree it would be different?
Much different. Worse.
Worse? Why worse?
Because Karl hurt me. He cheated and lied.
I mean, any friend who would know
all that and sleep with him anyway?
I would never talk to her again.
I don't blame you for
defending Katherine. But...
I just don't need a friend like her in my
life, especially when I have a friend like you.
Orson. Come in.
Uh, I'm getting everybody
to sign a get well card.
- We're sending it over to Julie.
- Oh, that's nice.
I suppose I should sign it somewhere
inconspicuous, given recent events.
I suppose.
By the way, this morning when I said
that Mike and Susan wouldn't last?
I know you thought I was crazy.
No. I didn't think that... exactly.
Well, F.Y.I., I stopped by their
house today with a casserole.
Mike was there... Alone.
Let's just say he was grateful. Very grateful.
Why wouldn't he be?
God, you have no ear for innuendo at all!
He made a pass at me.
With Julie in the hospital
and his marriage one day old?
Well... It may be the first day, but.
He's clearing having second thoughts.
Oh, and. Please don't tell Bree.
I'd hate for this to get back to Susan.
I hear Julie opened her eyes. That's great.
Yes. Yes, it is.
I'm sorry you're mad at me.
Yeah, I'm not mad.
I just can't understand why
she went to you instead of me.
That day that Julie found me crying?
The reason she opened up to me
was because I told her that...
and no one else can know
about this... I'm pregnant.
You are?
That's amazing.
Wait. Why were you crying?
Let's see. Uh, I'm in my 40s,
my husband is back in school,
I'm the sole breadwinner,
I don't know how I'm gonna do
this whole baby thing again,
and... also because...
What?
Because I can't quiet that one
voice in my mind that keeps saying...
Maybe I shouldn't.
Oh, honey.
Yeah.
Lynette, uh...
You can do whatever you
think it is you need to do.
Yeah. I know. Lucky me.
It's weird. Everybody talks
about a kid being a gift.
It's the only gift where you puke for nine months
before you receive it and
then scream the day it arrives.
That's true.
But they are a gift, Lynette.
I know that because...
I spent the last few hours thinking that I was...
Gonna lose mine.
I realized that I would...
Trade everything I own, I would
give everything I ever will have,
for just one more day as Julie's mom.
But I'm not telling you what you should do.
Actually, you are.
And I'm glad you did.
I had some briefs to finish, but i'd
rather work here than at the office.
Hey, Bree. You're still here?
Oh, she's kept me company all day.
Is she a saint or what?
Hey, Lee. Thanks for calling me back.
Uh, I'm just checking on M.J.
This has been the longest day of my life.
I thought I needed some time to myself.
I was wrong.
I... I need you.
I booked our room at the
motel. Here's the key.
If you could come by, even for just an hour...
Well, it would mean a lot to me.
Please.
I... I don't want to be alone tonight.
Neither do I.
- Hey, Gaby.
- Hey, you got a minute?
Oh, I think I know why you're here, and
believe me, I am as ticked off as you are.
- Angie...
- No, no, no, no.
Danny should've never kept your niece out so late.
When I found out, I kicked him so hard, he's
still trying to get the shoe out of his butt.
It'll never happen again.
- It never happened at all.
- What?
Ana wasn't with Danny last
night. She never left the house.
What are you talking about?
She snuck out. Danny bought
her beer. They both fessed up.
Ana was lying.
Well, why would she lie?
Because your son told her to.
Well, maybe she was changing her tune 'cause
she didn't want to get in trouble with you.
No. No! She's covering for Danny.
I don't know what you're
implying, but he's a good kid.
Your niece is the one that's

Can I at least talk to the girl
before she goes pointin' fingers?

the days ahead could be worse.
