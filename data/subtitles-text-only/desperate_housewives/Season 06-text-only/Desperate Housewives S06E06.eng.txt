Previously on "Desperate Housewives"
I think you're a lousy mother.
Gaby was insulted.
Did you just say that to my face?
I closed the door to ask
if you would like to
be my new senior V.P.
Lynette choose not to
mention her pregnancy
You get to stay in school.
Susan tried to protect Julie.
You shot me!
That gun is under our real name.
- I wanna call the police.
- Uh, just...
And Angie had to protect her secret.
- High road all the way.
- That's a good point.
Bree Hodge had a problem.
She did not want to fall
in love with Karl Mayer.
She was appalled by his table manners...
What?
His personal ethics...
What?
And his wandering eye.
What?
No, Bree did not want
to fall for Karl Mayer,
and yet she knew in her heart
that she was starting to.
And that's why she also knew
the time had come...
We have to talk.
to leave.
Hey, what's with the
face? You dumping me?
Karl...
Oh, my god. You are dumping me.
We've both known this
couldn't last forever,
so let's end it now
before someone gets hurt.
But it's going so well.
- I feel we're getting closer.
- We are.
That's the problem.
When I agreed to be your lover,
I felt quite sure that my
disdain for your vulgarity
and astounding lack of
scruples would preclude
any chance of my
developing feelings for you.
But against all reason, It's happening.
I don't want to fall in love with a man
I'm not even sure I like.
I'm glad we're being careful
about no one getting hurt.
Please, let's not make this
any harder than it has to be.
Okay. You say we're done, we're done.
I was gonna wait to give you this later,
maybe over dinner or something.
I guess now it's sort of a parting gift.
- I couldn't.
- Open it.
It's beautiful!
Oh, and it's inscribed.
"To my dear and beloved... Irene"?
Irene was my grandmother.
My grandpa gave it to her on their
first wedding anniversary.
Well, she had no granddaughters
so she willed it to me.
She said, "someday you'll find
the perfect woman to give
this to," and she was right.
I know how you feel.
I'm... I didn't plan on
falling for you, either.
And I don't blame you
for wanting to run the other way.
And for what it's worth...
I love you.
And in that moment,
Bree knew that the time to
leave her lover had come...
and gone.
Ann Peterson
was the principal of
Fairview Elementary School,
And she believed in rules.
She used them to teach hygiene,
to control behavior
And to instill order.
Yes, Mrs. Peterson believed in rules.
She also believed
That those who didn't follow
them should be punished.
Okay, the camera is rolling.
Are there any words you'd like to say
before your daughter
makes her stage debut?
Let us pray.
Gaby, Juanita is going to see this.
Oh, trust me this is not
the footage you wanna keep.
Well, I'm sorry. I
tried to work with her.
But you may as well know
your daughter is talent-free.
She is only 7. How bad could she be?
Well, I've already
looked through the program
to pick out a kid we
can pretend is ours.
I like Paige Glover.
I'm gonna be her mommy.
My name is Miles Standish.
We have come to share
with you our bounty.
And to give thanks for this new lands,
where we are free from
religious perskacootion.
- Which one is Paige Glover?
- shh, shh.
Religious perspacotion.
- Where we are free from religious...
- Persecution!
Read the corn! I wrote it on the corn!
Per... perska... prossa... aw...
at that moment,
Juanita Solis chose to utter
a certain 4-letter word...
for the very first time.
I did not write that on the corn.
Just promise me
you won't have a few drinks
and get all kissy with me
like you did last week at the Bermans'.
You told me you don't
want our friends to know
we're having marital problems.
Well, you don't have to
maul me to prove we're okay.
- I don't like public displays of affection.
- I know.
But these days, they're the
only kind I can get from you.
Sorry we're late, Mike.
oh, that's okay, come on in.
Oh, my god. I can't believe it.
It's just a pie, Susan.
I've brought them before.
No, the brooch that you're wearing.
It's... it's mine.
Excuse me?
Karl gave it to me
years ago. Can I see it?
Well, I don't doubt
that it's similar, Susan,
but it can't possibly be the same one.
No, yes! There's the inscription.
To his granny Irene! Mike!
This is the same brooch
I lost ten years ago.
You say you lost it?
Yeah. It was back when
Karl and I got divorced.
One day it was on my
coat, and the next... gone.
I never knew where it went.
- Hi, everybody.
- Well, now we know.
Great to see you. See you, sweetheart.
Hey, Karl, get in here. Wait.
You are not gonna believe this.
Bree found your grandmother's brooch.
- What?
- Yes, the one that Susan lost.
What an extraordinary coincidence.
Where did you get it, Bree?
She bought it. I'm assuming.
Uh, yes, at that little antique store
- down on Pearl Street.
- Yeah, so obviously,
whoever found it must've
sold it to that store.
Remember how mad you got when I lost it?
- He really yelled at me.
- You yelled at her?
- I don't recall yelling.
- You kinda did.
"How could you lose my
grandmother's brooch?!
- It was a family heirloom!"
- Unbelievable.
Yeah, that it would turn up
again after all this time.
Well, I'm glad I can give it
back to its rightful owner.
Oh, it's yours. You bought it.
Oh, I couldn't possibly wear it
knowing that Karl gave it to you.
Well, how much did it
cost? I'll reimburse you.
No need, dear. Trust me, it was a steal.
Whoa! We gotta get him inside.
- Shh. Shh. Just hold on. Just...
- Okay. Easy does it.
How can we get some pancakes?
- What? Oh, gee.
- Watch it. Watch it.
- I'm good, I'm good.
- Shh.
Porter,  for god sakes!
People are trying to sleep!
- Tom?
- Hey, honey.
What are you doing here?
I thought you were gonna
be at the library studying.
W... w... we were,
and after we were done,
I told the guys I'd
treat 'em to pancakes.
But the... the place was closed.
Ah, so we peed on the building.
Give it five, T-scav! Yo!
You're drunk.
Uh, I beg your pardon.
He's drunk. I'm faced.
Do you have a sink?
What did this library
have, a 3-drink minimum?
Well, after the library,
we went to a bar,
and they got into a
cutthroat game of beer pong.
Well, I'll just make 'em some pancakes
- and take 'em home in the morning.
- The morning?!
Can I talk to you a second, T-scav,
away from these beer pong champs?
Actually, they lost and... and
it was kind of controversial...
I don't care! they're
not staying here tonight.
Come on! Look at Niedermeyer.
I can't take him home
to his mom and dad.
You know how parents are.
Of course I do! we're parents!
Look...
I understand you want
the kids to like you
so they can elect you
Homecoming king or whatever,
but you are not going back to school
to have some second
childhood. Enough is enough!
Okay. okay, I hear ya.
Hey, I hear you, too.
Wanna keep it down?
And as punishment,
I'm having Juanita
draft a letter of apology
to every classmate and
family member who heard...
the verb in question.
That seems fair.
And of course, she won't
be allowed to participate
in the final two performances
of the Thanksgiving pageant.
Of course.
And she is also on
cafeteria cleaning detail
- for the next two weeks.
-Absolutely.
Uh, not so fast.
- I'm sorry?
- Oh, come on, Mrs. Peterson.
A letter of apology? Fine.
Taking her out of the play?
Hey, she deserved that based
on her performance alone.
But let's not go overboard.
Mrs. Solis, this school
has a zero tolerance policy
when it comes to profanity.
And we respect that. Right, honey?
Stay out of this, sweetheart.
You need to take a second
look at that policy.
Juanita made a little
slip. It wasn't intentional.
It's not like she flipped
the bird afterwards.
My ruling stands.
If you can't do the
time, don't do the crime.
What is this, Shawshank Elementary?
This school is not at fault.
If you want to assign blame,
you might look to your
dubious parenting skills.
- Oh, I wish you hadn't said that.
- Excuse me?
Well, Juanita learned
that word somewhere.
And you're saying I taught it to her?
No, I'm sure it was
whispered to her by the wind.
Let me tell you
something, Mrs. Peterson.
I am pulling Juanita
out of this crappy, crappy school!
Come on, Carlos! Oh.
"Crappy," huh?
What a shame Juanita won't be here
to blurt that out during
the pledge of allegiance.
Oh, yeah? well, here's a blurt for ya...
...And the horse you rode in on!
Don't shoot! it's just me.
Relax, Susan. It was a joke.
Is Mike here?
- He is out on a job.
- Oh, darn it.
I wanted to talk to both
of you so I could apologize.
Over the past few weeks...
I've let my emotions get the best of me.
I'm sure you've noticed
that my behavior has been... crazy.
Hmm, just in the... clinical sense.
Well, that's over.
I don't want there to be
any more tension between us.
When we see each other on the street,
I want us to wave,
not dive behind a garbage can.
Oh, I didn't dive. I...
just dropped my keys.
I just want things to be normal again.
Let me play poker
with you and the girls.
If you throw a party, invite me.
Maybe you and Mike can have me
over for a barbecue sometime.
Given what's happened,
I just don't see a
barbecue in our future.
Fine, Susan.
I was just hoping to be friends again
and show all those people
how wrong they were.
What people?
The ones who keep telling me that
I should sue you for, uh...
What did they call it?
"Reckless endangerment"?
Yeah, I'm sorry. Who
are all these people?
Neighbors, well-wishers,
a couple of lawyers who
dabble in civil lawsuits.
But I told them, "no, I
could never sue Susan."
In spite of everything,
we're still friends.
But... if that isn't true anymore...
Brunch! Uh...
Mike and I aren't
really barbecue people.
We like a good brunch.
So... let's give that a shot.
Um, I'm sorry. That was
just a bad choice of words.
I love it! Sunday around 11:00?
- I'll bring a quiche.
- Great.
Aren't you glad I'm not crazy anymore?
Oh, yeah. This is so much better.
We are over, Karl.
And this time I mean it.
Oh, come on, Bree.
You're gonna dump me
over a lousy brooch?
It's not the brooch, Karl. It's you.
Stealing Susan's Jewelry
and then berating her for losing it?
What kind of man does that?
How about a man whose wife's
taking him to the cleaners,
who wants to get back a little of
what she's costing him?
But how could you be so stupid
as to then give it to me?
Did it not occur to you that
she might see me wearing it?
Hey, when Susie and I divorced,
she lost a lot of things.
I forgot the brooch was one of them.
That's your defense
that you stole so much, you lost track?
Let's not forget who had no problem
staging a fake burglary to
protect her stuff from Orson.
Well, I am not proud of that.
I am even less proud of letting
my libido blind me to the fact
that I have been fornicating
with a morally bankrupt weasel.
- Well, not anymore. We're done.
- Wait.
Bree...
Will you marry me?
Excuse me?
I know, not the best time to ask.
But I was scared if I waited,
I wouldn't get another shot.
Do you think for one
instant I would even...
don't feel you need
to answer right away.
I'm pretty sure
what the short-term
response would be. But, um...
- I love you, Bree.
-For god sakes, Karl.
And I'd be honored if you'd even
consider becoming my wife.
- No.  I'm not done.
The man who swiped that brooch
that was the man I was.
The man I am now is a little better,
but he is nothing compared
to the man that I could be
with a woman like you as my wife.
There. Done.
- Karl...
- Don't say anything.
Just go. Think it over.
- I only wanna say...
- Bup, bup, bup!
Just think.
I hope I'm not disturbing you.
I just want to thank you for the...
Oh. Are you okay?
You're crying. What's wrong?
No, nothing. What's up?
Oh, okay.
I just wanted to tell you
how well our plan is working.
Our plan?
Yeah, the one about taking
the high road with Susan.
I was just over there.
She doesn't have a clue.
- Who's that?
- My mother.
Oh! where does she live?
She doesn't.
I'm sorry.
Tomorrow would've been her birthday.
Every year this time I
get a little depressed.
So let's go out. I'll buy you lunch.
It's the least I can do
for my partner in crime.
- Okay, you gotta stop with that.
- What?
This "our plan," "partner in crime."
This is your thing with Susan.
You do what you wanna do.
Oh, you're just upset
because of your mother.
You know what?
I'll bake you a pineapple
upside down cake.
Best thing in the world for depression!
Well, I called every
private school in the area.
No openings until september.
Damn it, Gaby.
You couldn't wait till summer
to cuss out the principal?
I make no apologies. She had it coming.
And I'd do it again.
She attacked our daughter.
Well, I'm glad you're
so devoted to Juanita,
'cause you're about to be spending
A whole lot more time together.
What are you talking about?
I think we have other choice.
You're gonna have to homeschool her.
That's funny. Oh, you're good, Carlos.
We needed something to cut the tension.
But seriously, what do we do?
Seriously? We enroll online,
They send us the curriculum,
and you teach her.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Before this gets ugly,
you do realize I don't
know how to teach.
Really? You taught
Juanita a few choice words.
Me? How about you?
What a blank of a day!
Earl at the office is such a blank.
I wanna kick the blank out of his blank.
Oh, yeah? How about,
that blanking hairdresser
totally screwed up my blanking hair!
Look at me! I'm totally blanked!
The blanking client
didn't sign the deal,
and we lost a blankload of money.
Wah! Blank, blank, blank!
Okay. We are both at fault.
- But you're homeschooling her.
- Fine,
but I know someone who isn't
getting blanked tonight.
Fine with me.
I blanked off earlier.
- Thanks again for the pie.
- You're welcome.
So I see you're wearing the brooch.
I must say it was awfully sweet of Karl
to give you his grandmother's jewelry.
When you were married,
did he do that sort of thing often
- surprise you with little gifts?
- Constantly.
Really?
Yeah, of course, after a
while I knew that it just meant
that he'd cheated and
was feeling guilty.
Once he went to Barbados
and brought me back
a pair of sapphire
earrings. I cried for days.
So... why the sudden
fascination with Karl?
Oh, I'm hardly fascinated, just curious.
When you talk about
your marriage to him,
it's always about the
lies and the cheating,
and you never really
talk about the good times.
Well, there were wonderful times.
Yeah, he was always a good kisser,
and he could always make me laugh.
You know, the truth is, if he
had begged my forgiveness...
I mean, if just once...
he had told me that he
was willing to change...
Oh! The hell with Karl.
In fact, um...
Here.
No, Susan. It's yours.
No, it's Karl's.
And the only jewelry I should
be wearing now is Mike's.
- Well, if you insist.
- And by the way, thanks.
It felt good to say a
few nice things about
Karl for a change, you know.
Well, it was nice to hear them.
Here you go, Gaby. It's kinda old.
It's from before the
Soviet Union broke up.
The Soviet Union broke up?
You sure you know what you're doing
with this homeschooling thing?
Oh, honey, Juanita's in first grade.
She'll believe what I tell her.
Hey, your phone. Oh!
Ooh. I popped my button.
Actually, Lynette, I'm not surprised.
- What?
-  Well, I wasn't gonna bring it up,
but... you have been getting
a little rounder lately.
Well, what can I tell you, Gaby?
I'm working long hours,
I'm not exercising,
eating a bunch of junk at work.
Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised
if she gets even bigger than this.
Don't you have some homework?
Actually, I've gotta pick
up some books at the library.
Good. I'll clean up.
Bye.
Seriously, Lynette, you can
lose this weight in one month.
No, Gaby, I really can't.
Yes, you can, and I'm gonna help you.
What do you say we meet
every morning at 7:00
and go for a run?
I don't know. That's
right around the time
I'm getting the kids ready for school.
Lynette, you cannot let this go.
You know the expression
"The longer you wait,
the bigger the butt."
If you'll excuse me, I have to get that.
It might be another friend
calling to tell me my ass is too fat.
Well, I'm just trying to help.
All right. Bye. I love you.
Hello?
No, T-Scav just left.
This is L-Scav. May I help you?
I'm... I'm sorry. What party?
Oh! Niedermeyer! Mahoney!
- Hey, Mrs. Scavo.
- Hi.
Would you like a slice
of long island watermelon?
Gosh, tempting, but I
just wanna find my husband
and bring him home.
- Uh, he's not here.
- Don't cover for him.
Somebody called our
house wanting to know
why he hadn't shown up with the keg yet.
Brilliant.
Niedermeyer, please. Tom
has actual responsibilities.
His jell-o shots and
beer pong days are over,
and I don't appreciate his new buddies
Making him think they're not.
He's not our buddy.
I don't care. I just
wanna know where he is.
He just dropped off the keg and left.
Well... wait! wait!
If he's not your friend,
why is he buying you a keg?
Why is he making you
dinner at our house?
- Okay, boys.
- No! oh, no, no, no!
Without this watermelon,
all these pretty girls will stay sober,
and we know what that means.
No! No! okay! okay! We'll tell you!
Dude, she's got our melon!
Tom's doing stuff for us
because gave him the
answers to the midterm.
He's cheating off you?
No. We've got a connection
in the math department.
We get the tests.
Wait, uh, Mrs. Scavo, can
we get our watermelon back?
- You coming to bed?
- Just a sec.
Oh.  So exhausted.
Oh. Okay.
No, no, no. Wait. Wait.
I am not that exhausted.
Oh. okay.
Delfino plumbing.
Uh, yeah. Well, exactly
what's the problem?
Look, I... I'm... I'm
not on call tonight.
I'll... I'll try to stop by tomorrow.
That's right, buster. You're
not going anywhere tonight.
Mmm. No kidding.
Katherine can fix her own leak.
That was Katherine?
You goota get over there right now.
Look, I know we've gotta
be friends with her,
but not at 11:00. And not
when you're wearing this.
Okay, she could sue us.
Oh, she's not gonna sue us over this.
It's not like our dog peed
on her flowers. I shot her.
So call her back and tell
her you'll be right over.
Fine.
How long will it take anyway?
I don't know. It's a
leak in her master bath.
In the bedroom?
Hello, Mike.
And Susan. What are you doing here?
I came to assist my husband,
get the job done in half the time.
Hey, um, where's your sling?
Oh! My shoulder's feeling
much better. Thank you.
That's great! So it
doesn't hurt if I do this?
Hey, why don't we take a
look at this leaky faucet?
Uh, uh, no.
Actually, it's the, um,
garbage disposal in the kitchen.
But I thought you said
it was in the master bath.
Mike, seriously,
why would a garbage disposal
be in the master bath?
Come on. This way.
It's just making this awful sound.
Well, they're supposed
to make an awful sound.
What are you doing up here?
I knew I never should've trusted you.
You just wanted Mike over
here to try to seduce him.
Really, Susan.
You have the most suspicious mind.
Oh, please. Look at this place.
Even I'm getting turned on.
So I lit a few candles and
sprinkled some rose petals.
I do that every night.
Really? Mm.
Do you also drink an
entire bottle of champagne?
Maybe I have a little problem, okay?
No, you have a big
problem, Katherine. Mike!
There's no reason to
bring him into this.
Oh, well, you say that
you do this every night,
and he used to spend
a lot of nights here.
So why don't we see if it
looks familiar to him? Mike!
Mike, I need you to come up here! Mike!
Come up here right now!
Stop! Stop! Stop! That's evidence!
Leave me alone!
Oh, my god. A bubble bath?!
This is now a bad Jackie Collins novel.
I want you out of my house.
Katherine, you need help.
What you're doing here... it's sick!
You don't actually think
that rose petals and champagne
are gonna work on Mike. He loves me!
Don't push me, Susan. I'll sue you!
Oh, you know what? Go ahead. Sue me!
And while you're at it,
get me for assault
with a strawberry, too.
Uhh! Just...
You bitch! Aah!
Crazy! Aah!
F.Y.I., we hate her again.
Mahoney called me and
told me that you...
- Know about the cheating?
- Yeah. I do.
What I don't know is what the
hell's the matter with you.
Why would you do something that stupid?
Because it is a required
course that I will never use,
and...
I'm failing it.
You're failing?
We can't afford to have you fail.
I know. That's why I did this,
so that I could focus
all of my attention
on my core classes.
Are... are you failing those, too?
No...
But it's
touch-and-go.
My advisor warned me that
learning a language at my age
would be difficult,
and Mandarin is one of the hardest.
I study and I study, but
I... I'm always behind.
Lynette, you gotta
understand, I am drowning here.
I don't care.
What?
You're having trouble
in school? Talk to me.
Talk to your professors. Hire a tutor.
What you don't do is cheat.
Come on, Lynette.
It... it is statistics.
I'm never gonna use it.
It's the principle of the thing, Tom!
What if the kids found out?
What kind of example
are you setting for them?
The same one you're setting.
When Gabrielle asked you
if you were gaining weight,
- didn't you lie?
- Oh, clearly that's different.
- Why?
- Because of the consequences.
You could get kicked out of school.
And you could lose one
of your best friends.
I'm going to tell Gaby the truth...
eventually.
And when you do, she'll tell Carlos.
And when he finds out
that his new Vice President
lied to him, he may fire you.
Some more about consequences?
I think the way you're trying
to rationalize your behavior
is pathetic.
We are two middle-aged people, Lynette.
We both know the value of principles.
We also know something that
we've never told the kids...
that there are, sadly,
some times in life
when you need to break the
rules in order to survive.
I cheated on a test.
You don't want to pat
me on the back? Fine.
But don't act like
you are better than me,
'cause you're not.
"Okay," said Skippy.
"I'll meet you down at
red creek after school."
This is boring. Can I watch TV?
Juanita, while you're here with me,
it's the same as if you were at school.
We just finished gym class.
Now it's time for reading.
Ironing isn't gym class.
Hey, who's the teacher here, huh?
Read!
You read.
Juanita!
Come on.
Let's just finish this chapter.
Don't even think about it.
I'm warning you. I am not playing.
Juanita, so help me god...
- Pick it up!
- No.
Pick it up or end up
on the floor next to it.
Thank you. That's much better.
Hello? So what did we learn today?
- Pick up the book! Pick it up!
- No! No!
Gaby, what the hell is going on?!
It's called homeschooling!
Pick... up... the... book!
I did what you asked, Karl.
I went home and thought
about your proposal.
And? No, wait. Not yet.
Do I need to brace myself?
- I'm not gonna say no.
- Really?
Or yes. What's the point
when I already have a
husband I can't seem to shake?
So for now, you might wanna
focus on getting me a divorce.
And if I do that, you'll marry me?
No, not you, but I am
interested in this other Karl...
the one you say you're
planning to become.
Yeah, if you marry me.
Well, I'm afraid
He's gonna have to make an
appearance sooner than that.
I think I can arrange a meeting.
Oh! That's another thing.
No sex for at least a month.
A month?
You are too adept at using
it to cloud my judgment.
I wanna see you through
eyes that are clear,
not rolling back in my head.
So I have to be a good boy and no sex.
It's like we're married already.
Karl, if we go public
with this, let alone marry,
there will be serious consequences.
Susan may never speak to me again,
and god only knows what Orson will do.
I will not even contemplate
paying that price
until I'm sure you're
damn well worth it.
And if you can prove that you are...
then you can give this to me again.
And next time, it'll mean something.
Well, did you talk with her?
Is she ready to apologize?
Mm, not quite.
She heard what you
said to the principal,
and she is blaming you
for her not being allowed
to go back to school.
So you defended me, right?
Well, that was a little tough,
what with her being
right and you being wrong.
What do you mean wrong?
I did what I did for her.
Really?
You don't think that
maybe a teeny bit of that
was in response to you
being criticized as a mom?
No!
Well, maybe "the horse
you rode in on" part,
but the original sentiment was
all in defense of our daughter.
Where does she get off being mad at me?
Gaby, she can't go to school
and be with her friends.
She can't have people
over because a chimp
mauled a clown at her birthday party.
She has every right to be mad.
You... not so much.
Ma? It's me.
I know. It's been a
long time. I'm sorry.
No, you know I can't tell you that.
Just... know that we're safe, okay?
Oh, ma, please, don't cry.
We only have a few
minutes to talk, okay?
He's good.
He just turned 19.
I know. Can you believe it?
Yeah, I wish we could, too.
Uh, it's just too risky.
But, you know, maybe
one of these days...
Ma, I gotta go.
I... I... I'll talk to you
soon. Rimanga Bene, okay?
Hey ya, Katherine. What you got there?
I thought you said your mother was dead.
Oh, yeah. That was
my mother-in-law.
Nick's mom.
You call her "ma"?
We're close.
I didn't hear you come in.
The front door was open. here.
Hey, is that one of
those prepaid phones?
Oh, yeah. When Nick
and I went on vacation,
we bought this to call home.
And then we had some minutes left over,
so I figured I'd use 'em up.
What's on your mind, Katherine?
Well, I wanted to drop
off the cake as promised
and tell you last night,
Susan and I had a big fight.
She threw me into the bathtub.
Really?
First she shoots me, now
she tries to drown me.
I'm going to the police,
so I'm gonna need that gun for evidence.
What gun?
The one she shot me with.
The one Danny gave Julie.
Listen, Katherine, I really
don't think it's a good idea
gettin' the police involved.
Just stick to your plan.
I hate that she can get away with this.
Hey. Nick's not Italian, is he?
No. Why?
'Cause you were talking
to his mother in Italian.
Oh, she likes it. Makes
her feel sophisticated.
I have a doctor's
appointment in 40 minutes.
I really should get dressed.
But thank you for the cake.
What's that, sweetie, your homework?
It's all homework now, isn't it?
Look, Juanita,
you know, when I was young,
I used to get picked on
because I was the
littlest kid in my class,
and I couldn't defend
myself from the bullies.
And then I discovered a
part of me that was big...
my mouth.
And I've been fighting
back with it ever since.
So when Mrs. Peterson
said those mean things,
I had to defend you.
Why? I said a bad word.
If you just let her punish me,
this would all be over.
Believe me, leaving that school
Is gonna wind up being a good thing.
Mrs. Peterson is a bully.
I like Mrs. Peterson.
Okay. I was wrong, and
I'm sorry you're upset.
You still think I'm a good mom, right?
Honey?
Can we just read?
I'm telling you, Katherine
cannot be trusted.
The way she talks about
stealing Mike back from you?
She has completely lost it.
Believe me, I know. Mike
and I have a new rule.
We're going to pretend that
Katherine doesn't exist.
You think that's gonna be enough?
You need to get her off the street.
Katherine hates you,
And I'm not talkin' "dirty
looks in the supermarket" hate.
That woman is dangerous.
Dangerous how?
Okay. I can't believe
I'm even saying this.
But do you know where Katherine was
the night that Julie was attacked?
No. That's crazy. Um...
Why would Katherine want to hurt Julie?
You had just married
the man that she loved.
It was dark.
A woman walked out of your house...
maybe she didn't think it was Julie.
There are so many rules in this world.
That's why we must start learning them
while we are still children.
We are told very clearly...
"Don't say bad words."
"It's not nice to lie to your friends."
"You shouldn't covet
a man who isn't yours."
"And you shouldn't betray a man who is."
So we grow up,
and still we break the rules...
completely forgetting
that if someone catches us,
we will be punished.
- Hi there. .
- Yes, good afternoon, sir.
Uh, I was hoping to
replace the camel brooch
my wife purchased here.
I'd like to surprise her.
A brooch? Hmm, we don't
have anything like that here.
You must be mistaken.
My wife was quite specific
about where she purchased it.
Sorry, we sell furniture.
She must've gotten it somewhere else.
Excuse me.
