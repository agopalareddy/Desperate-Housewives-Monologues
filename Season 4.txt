Sadly, it only took 15 minutes For the residents of Wisteria Lane ... To become art critics. Yes, art came to Wisteria Lane on a tuesday morning, And by tuesday afternoon... War had come as well.

But mostly, we keep our distance Because we'd rather our neighbors Know nothing about us... Than know too much.

Yes, the mistakes of our past have a way of drifting back into our lives... And when they do... We have to pay for them. One day in the early fall, Mike Delfino hurted his shoulder... To ease his pain, he took a little white pill recommended by his doctor. The pain persisted, so he took another... And another. Unfortunately, when mike's pain began to subside, his need for the little white pills... Did not. But mike never shared this with those who cared about him, only with those who could not have cared less.

    [Mary Alice Young]: The past is never truly behind us. Ghosts lurk in the shadows, eager to remind us of the choices we made. But if we look back, we might find an old friend with open arms...

To repeat it.
