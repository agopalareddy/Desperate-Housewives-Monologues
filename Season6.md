# Season 6

## Episode 1

[Mary Alice Young]: The veil was made from the finest silk.
The garter was trimmed with handmade lace.
The shoes were designed by the top couturier in Milan.
You see, the bride wanted only the best for her wedding day because she was about to marry the best man in the world... for the second time.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, the bride wanted the best wedding money could buy.
But as she left the altar, it suddenly occurred to her... She should've spent more on security.

[Mary Alice Young]: It's not hard to find sin in the suburbs.
Just look behind closed doors.
That's where you'll find your neighbors cheating on their taxes... and drinking too much vodka... and stealing their father's magazines.
Yes, the suburbs are filled with sinners, some of whom occasionally... repent.

[Mary Alice Young]: It's not hard to find sin in the suburbs.
Just look behind closed doors, and you'll find your neighbors cheating on their husbands... resenting their children... plotting against their friends.
But as much as we like to talk about the sinful things people do... we forget there is a difference between sin... and evil.
Sadly, there's always someone willing to come along and remind us.

## Episode 2

[Mary Alice Young]: The first time Karen McCluskey saw Roy Bender, she did something she didn't expect to do.
She smiled.
The next time they met, Roy did something he didn't expect to do.
He smiled back.
After a week of sly flirtations, Karen and Roy did something no one expected them to do.
And they did it twice.
With each passing day, Karen began to feel something she hadn't felt in years, and she realized she needed to know if Roy was feeling the same way.

[Mary Alice Young]: For a moment, Mrs. McCluskey didn't move.
And whether it was her boyfriend's discovery of Julie Mayer or her realization that he wasn't going to say the words she desperately needed to hear, Karen McCluskey suddenly felt the urge to...

[Mary Alice Young]: It was a shame what happened that day, considering how nicely the morning had begun.
One neighbor was out reading the sports section, delighted to see that his team had won.
A child was playing with her new doll, thrilled to discover just how durable it was.
And a woman was walking with the man she adored, determined to say she loved him for the very first time.
Yes, up until the screaming started, people thought it was going to be a wonderful day.

[Mary Alice Young]: It had been a horrible day, and people in the neighborhood were doing their best to recover.
One mother was about to share some good news with her family when her son saw a flashing light in the window.
Another was busy grounding her niece when she noticed the police car pulling up across the street.
A woman was planning a rendezvous with her lover when she saw a young man being taken out of his house.
Within moments, everyone had heard the son of one housewife was suspected of strangling the daughter of another.
Yes, it had been a horrible day.
And the thought occurred to one old woman... the days ahead could be worse.

## Episode 3

[Mary Alice Young]: There's a certain kind of woman you see in the suburbs.
She waits for the school bus in her bathrobe.
She stops by the post office with curlers in her hair.
She goes to the market in sweatpants and a t-shirt.
This woman is a housewife, and she doesn't bother trying to be beautiful because... it's a waste of time.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, there's a certain kind of woman you only meet in the suburbs.
She will try to look beautiful if she has someone to look beautiful for.

[Mary Alice Young]: On this street, the day begins with a cup of coffee.
Most need it to wake up.
Some can't read their morning paper without it.
A few like to drink it on their way to work.
Then there are those who just want something to hold in their hands while they discuss the neighbors.

[Mary Alice Young]: On this street, the day begins with a cup of coffee.
Some drink it while recalling a lover they once cared for.
Some pour it, thinking of the boss they must lie to.
Others sip it, contemplating a man they might be in love with.
But for one woman, on this particular morning, that cup of coffee has to wait... because she discovers a neighbor in trouble.
She goes to help, not only because it's the right thing to do, but because it's the only way she can think of... to ask for forgiveness.
And once it is given... the day begins.

## Episode 4

[Mary Alice Young]: Bree Van De Kamp was having an affair.
And whenever her lover called... she needed an excuse to leave work early.
But on this particular day, Bree was surprised to find her work had been done for her.

[Mary Alice Young]: Poor Bree.
She wanted to help her friend.
But she didn't have time to deal with Katherine's imaginary lover... not when she had a real one.

[Mary Alice Young]: You wouldn't know it to look at him, but that nice man who delivers your mail hits his wife.
You'd never guess by her smile, but that nice woman across the street embezzles from her boss.
And that attractive couple who jogs by every morning?
Well, they like their cocaine.
The sad truth is, we don't know our friends and neighbors nearly as well as we think we do.
Even the people we love... keep secrets.

[Mary Alice Young]: You wouldn't think of it to look at her, but the lady next door is having a nervous breakdown.
You'd never guess by her smile, but the wife of your uncle once betrayed his trust.
And that daughter you adore... Well, she's having an affair with a married man.
The sad truth is, we don't know our friends and neighbors nearly as well as we think we do.
Even the people we trust most... keep secrets.

## Episode 5

[Mary Alice Young]: It is in our nature to judge the people around us.
We judge the way strangers dress.
The way our neighbors tend their lawns... and the way our friends act in public.
Yes, we make these judgments all the time, never thinking that one day we may be judged... ourselves.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, it's in our nature to judge those around us.
It's also in our nature... to blame someone else for our mistakes.

[Mary Alice Young]: It had been two weeks since Julie Mayer had been attacked.
And when she came home from the hospital, the residents of Wisteria Lane were there to welcome her back.
She was greeted by children who came with signs... housewives who came with desserts... and old friends who came with flowers.
Also in the crowd was a new friend... who came with an agenda.

[Mary Alice Young]: It is in our nature to judge the people around us.
If they ignore our wishes, we believe they are disrespectful.
If they don't watch their children, we conclude they're unfit parents.
If we catch them cheating, we assume we know their reasons.
But, what happens when we finally stop for a moment, to judge our own lives.
It can be painful to step back and seeing what we've been doing, and even more painful to realize we have no intention of stopping.

## Episode 6

[Mary Alice Young]: Bree Hodge had a problem.
She did not want to fall in love with Karl Mayer.
She was appalled by his table manners... his personal ethics... and his wandering eye.
No, Bree did not want to fall for Karl Mayer, and yet she knew in her heart that she was starting to.
And that's why she also knew the time had come... to leave.

[Mary Alice Young]: And in that moment, Bree knew that the time to leave her lover had come... and gone.

[Mary Alice Young]: Ann Peterson was the principal of Fairview Elementary School, and she believed in rules.
She used them to teach hygiene, to control behavior and to instill order.
Yes, Mrs. Peterson believed in rules.
She also believed that those who didn't follow them should be punished.

[Mary Alice Young]: At that moment, Juanita Solis chose to utter a certain 4-letter word... for the very first time.

[Mary Alice Young]: There are so many rules in this world.
That's why we must start learning them while we are still children.
We are told very clearly... "Don't say bad words."
"It's not nice to lie to your friends."
"You shouldn't covet a man who isn't yours."
"And you shouldn't betray a man who is."
So we grow up, and still we break the rules... completely forgetting that if someone catches us, we will be punished.

## Episode 7

[Mary Alice Young]: Julie Mayer was having trouble sleeping.
You see, every time she closed her eyes, she dreamt of her neighbor.
They met when she came to tutor his son.
Later, a chance encounter at a cafe led to hours of conversation.
He asked to see her again... and again... and again.
And the next thing Julie knew, she was having an affair with a married man.
But then, after a close call, she came to her senses and told the man it was over.
Unfortunately for Julie, some men can't take "no" for an answer.

[Mary Alice Young]: That night, for the first time in weeks, Julie Mayer would sleep well.
Unfortunately, Lynette Scavo would not.

[Mary Alice Young]: "The Fairview Homeschooling Workbook" was created to help parents teach their children.
It's colorful, very entertaining, a bit challenging and guaranteed to make teaching fun.

[Mary Alice Young]: The truth is, there's only so much we can learn from books.
They can't tell you how to make your wife happy.
They can't tell you how to appreciate your neighbor.
They can't tell you if that man across the street is dangerous.
No, the only way to truly learn is from your mistakes.
Of course, if those mistakes land you in jail, it might be nice to have a book to pass the time.

## Episode 8

[Mary Alice Young]: If someone wanted proof that Judge Mary Gallagher had a sense of humor, all they needed to do was watch her pronounce sentence.
For the slumlord who refused to fix a furnace... the woman who threw a phone at her maid... and for the high school coach who made lewd remarks to a cheerleader...
And then there was the case of the housewife who shot her neighbor...

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, when it came to sentencing, Judge Mary Gallagher had a sense of humor.
But not everyone found her funny.

[Mary Alice Young]: There is a coffee shop in Fairview.
It's known as a place where you can read your morning paper... where you can meet your friends... where you can bump into your neighbors... whether you want to or not.

[Mary Alice Young]: There is a coffee shop in Fairview.
It's known as a place where you can read your morning paper... where you can meet your friends... where you can have a cup of coffee at the end of a long day.
Yes, it was a place known for many things.
But after this night, it would be known for something... far worse.

## Episode 9

[Mary Alice Young]: Her name was Emily Portsmith, and word of her death spread quickly.
You see, everyone in town knew Emily.
Her family was well known and respected, she'd been popular in school... and her customers at the coffee shop adored her.
People were shocked to hear she'd been murdered, mostly because another young woman had been attacked just a few weeks before.
Yes, everyone in Fairview now knew a killer was walking among them.
And they would soon learn... he wasn't finished.

[Mary Alice Young]: The world is a dangerous place, and we must learn to defend ourselves from those who want to hurt us... that stranger without a name... an employer who holds a grudge... the husband who won't let go.
Yes, we all try to defend ourselves so we won't get hurt.
Until the moment we realize our pain... can hurt someone else.

## Episode 10

[Mary Alice Young]: Daphne Bicks was an unhappy woman.
And no one knew this better than her husband.
That's why he hired her to work with him.
He thought it might cheer her up.
But sadly, Jeff Bicks soon discovered that it would take a lot more than a job... to keep his wife from complaining.
She complained from the moment they got up in the morning... till they were on their way home at the end of the day.
Things had gotten so bad, Jeff Bicks began to wonder when God would end his suffering.
Luckily for Jeff, God had a plan.

[Mary Alice Young]: And that is how the unhappy marriage of Jeff and Daphne Bicks ended... in a plane losing altitude right above a cul-de-sac... by the name of Wisteria Lane.

[Mary Alice Young]: The best Christmas ever... That's what the residents of Wisteria Lane were dreaming of as they prepared for their annual yuletide festival.
So they hung up a banner... brought out their candy canes... and put up Santa's workshop, as eager as children for the holiday to begin.
Of course, some were more childish than others.

[Mary Alice Young]: The best Christmas ever... That's what everyone had wanted.
But something went wrong.
Horribly wrong.
For those who survived, it would be a day they would try to forget.
For those who didn't, this Christmas would simply be their last.

## Episode 11

[Mary Alice Young]: If you watch the news tonight, you will be told all about a tragedy that occurred on a quiet suburban street.
You will hear eyewitness accounts of the crash.
You will learn the extent of the damage.
But the news can't tell you who survived.
Because no one yet knows... for sure.

[Mary Alice Young]: The truth is, no one knows who survived that tragic plane crash... or more importantly, who didn't.

[Mary Alice Young]: With that, Susan began to think of her marriage to Karl... how wonderfully it had started... how they'd been so happy... until the day she found lipstick where she shouldn't have.
Susan then thought of the day she told Karl to leave, and she wondered... What if she hadn't?

[Mary Alice Young]: Bree Hodge was told about the death of Karl Mayer at 6:12 that evening.
She became so hysterical, she had to be sedated by 6:18.
It wasn't long before she fell asleep.
And then, she began to dream.
A dream about what her life would have been like if Karl hadn't died.

[Mary Alice Young]: Just like that, Angie Bolen began to consider what was happening.
She thought of the doctors trying to save Mona and how long it might take her to recover.
Then she imagined Mona waking up... and telling the police everything she knew.
And Angie asked herself, what would happen if Mona Clarke lived?

[Mary Alice Young]: As she lay there, Gabrielle began to think of ways her daughter could shine.
She thought of music... and sports... and other creative pastimes.
And before she drifted off to sleep, Gabrielle wondered, what if her daughter was destined to be a great actress?

[Mary Alice Young]: At that moment, Lynette began to think of the baby she had yet to meet.
She thought of what it would be like to hold him, how it would feel to look into his eyes... and to kiss his tiny hand.
And then Lynette thought of what would happen if the doctor told her that same beautiful child was disabled.

[Mary Alice Young]: The funeral for Karl Mayer was a dignified affair.
Attended by friends and family.
And those who loved him.
The priest spoke about the nature of tragedy.
How it causes people to ask what if... What if he hadn't died... What if I had chosen differently... What if I had made that mistake...
And then the priest said the best way to honor those who had died was to focus on what was and to keep on living the best way we know how.
And in time, that is exactly what my friends would do.

## Episode 12

[Mary Alice Young]: A month after the death of Karl Mayer, his family assembled for the reading of his will.
To each, Karl left something to remember him by.
To his great aunt, he left a grand piano.
To his favorite cousin, he left gold cuff links.
To his beloved daughter, he left cash and securities.
But Karl Mayer left his most extraordinary possession of all to someone who wasn't expecting a thing.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, Karl Mayer left his ex-wife something to remember him by... not that there was any chance she would forget him.

[Mary Alice Young]: All kinds of men go to the Double D gentlemen's club.
Frat boys looking for a thrill... soldiers looking to get lucky... CEOs looking to close a deal.
Yes, all kinds of men go to Double D's, which can be very upsetting to all kinds of women.

[Mary Alice Young]: The act itself is quite simple... You strip away the outer layer and reveal what's underneath.
Of course, sometimes the results can be quite surprising.
If you strip away the veneer of happy domesticity, you may find grief.
If you strip away that facade of wealth, you may find self-loathing.
If you strip away the veil of helplessness, you may find cruelty.
Yes, stripping can be a dangerous pastime.
But for a lucky few, it can also be... a lot of fun.

## Episode 13

[Mary Alice Young]: If you want to throw a successful dinner party, there are certain rules that must be followed.
If the good silver is used, it must be polished.
If music is played, the volume should be low.
If the guests bring wine, it must be served.
And if the evening is to be truly successful... there must be a toast.

[Mary Alice Young]: And the number one rule for a successful dinner party?
Keep discussion of your marriage to an absolute minimum.

[Mary Alice Young]: Dr. Brent Avedon was the head of psychology at the Fairview Health Center.
He spent his days treating antisocial adolescents, delusional dowagers... and bipolar businessmen.
But lately, his most interesting patient was a housewife who'd had a nervous breakdown.

[Mary Alice Young]: In our darkest moments, we all need someone who will listen.
Some turn to friendly professionals.
A few rely on those who are older and wiser.
Others seek out someone who knows what they're going through.
But for most of us, nothing is quite so therapeutic as a good long talk with a few old friends.

## Episode 14

[Mary Alice Young]: Orson Hodge was smiling again, and it was starting to worry his wife.
You see, since his accident, Bree Hodge had grown accustomed to her husband's severe mood swings.
She had grown used to his unexpected rage... his sudden anguish... his deep depression.
But lately, an odd tranquility had settled over Orson, and his wife had the feeling something was terribly wrong.
Sadly, she was right.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, Orson Hodge was smiling again, and Bree would soon learn the reason why.
You see, her husband... had decided to kill himself.

[Mary Alice Young]: In this never-ending drama we call life, everyone has a part to play.
Some are cast as romantic leads.
Others end up playing the victim.
And a few provide comic relief.
But if the drama is to be really compelling, there must be a hero... and a villain.

[Mary Alice Young]: Seduction is an art.
Subtle methods of coercion are used to sway the susceptible.
And those who are determined will take their time to get what they want.
And when the seduction is successful, those who succumbed ask themselves... Was I seduced... or was this what I wanted all along?

## Episode 15

[Mary Alice Young]: The first thing you need to know about Robin Gallagher was that everyone liked to look at her.
They would stare at her legs... and her breasts... and her hair.
And once they were done, people would begin to ask... Who is this?

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes... everyone liked to look at Robin Gallagher... but not everyone liked what they saw.

[Mary Alice Young]: Later, while the men of Wisteria Lane were trying the shrimp, their wives were trying to control themselves.

[Mary Alice Young]: Seduction is an art.
Subtle methods of coercion are used to sway the susceptible.
And those who are determined will take their time to get what they want.
And when the seduction is successful, those who succumbed ask themselves... Was I seduced... or was this what I wanted all along?

## Episode 16

[Mary Alice Young]: Since she'd become a mother, Gabrielle Solis had learned many things-- how to get gum off a remote control... how to rescue a doll from the disposal... and where to find disappointing report cards.
Gabrielle had also learned that no matter how hard she tried... she couldn't please everyone.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, Gabrielle had learned many things as a mother.
The most important... was to get while the getting was good.

[Mary Alice Young]: Seduction-- Any soap opera fan will tell you, it's an art best practiced... on those who are vulnerable.

[Mary Alice Young]: In our darkest moments, we all need someone who will listen.
Some turn to friendly professionals.
A few rely on those who are older and wiser.
Others seek out someone who knows what they're going through.
But for most of us, nothing is quite so therapeutic as a good long talk with a few old friends.

## Episode 17

[Mary Alice Young]: Preston Scavo was finally coming home from Europe, and his family was wondering what kind of souvenirs he'd be bringing them.
His brother wanted an army knife from Switzerland.
His sister wanted some wooden shoes from Holland.
His father wanted some cheese from Bavaria.
And his mother?
Well, all she wanted was to hold her little boy in her arms...

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, Preston Scavo had returned from his trip with a beautiful souvenir, and his mother would soon wish he hadn't.

[Mary Alice Young]: Sometimes you must wash away the mud to reveal that sparkling yellow underneath.
Sometimes you must carry the flower into the sunlight to appreciate the redness of the rose.
Sometimes you have to take off the wrapping to understand just how green a bike can be.
And if you want to see a woman's true colors, just make her feel unnecessary.

[Mary Alice Young]: It's not always easy to see someone's true colors.
Sometimes you must look beneath the masculine veneer to find that fragile ego.
You must ignore the sparkle of the jewel to know you're looking at a fake.
You must bring the truth out of the shadows to see the beauty of its smile.
Yes, people hide their true nature from us every day, and sadly, we only find out when it's too late.

## Episode 18

[Mary Alice Young]: You should never trust family photos.
They are designed to be misleading.
A mother's bright smile may hide a lifetime of disappointment.
A son's sweet expression could conceal boundless rage.
A daughter's sedate pose might obscure years of un-ladylike behavior.
And as for that father with the air of dignity, there's always the chance... he has another family elsewhere.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, be careful when looking at family photos... like certain members of the family, they are not to be trusted.

[Mary Alice Young]: Every year, Oakridge Private School held a fund-raising drive.
Students were asked to sell $3 bars of chocolate.
Whoever sold the most would receive a prize.
Of course, for someone to win, someone else had to lose.

[Mary Alice Young]: It's not always easy to see someone's true colors.
Sometimes you must look beneath the masculine veneer to find that fragile ego.
You must ignore the sparkle of the jewel to know you're looking at a fake.
You must bring the truth out of the shadows to see the beauty of its smile.
Yes, people hide their true nature from us every day, and sadly, we only find out when it's too late.

## Episode 19

[Mary Alice Young]: Good neighbors-- they loan you cups of sugar... they tell you why your car won't start... they even help you find your lost pets.
Good neighbors also come over at the slightest hint of trouble... whether you want 'em there or not.

[Mary Alice Young]: Good neighbors-- they're people who try to help others.
Bad neighbors are people who make promises they can't possibly keep.

[Mary Alice Young]: The morning paper said a young girl was missing.
It quoted her family, who said she had vanished on her way to work.
It quoted her friends, who said she wasn't the type to run away from home.
It quoted the police, who said they had very little evidence to go on.
Sadly, people didn't pay much attention to this bit of news.
No one thinks about evil until it shows up on their doorstep, which it soon would.

[Mary Alice Young]: We all know that evil exists.
The newspapers are filled with stories about young girls who suddenly vanish.
But we don't pay attention because we're worried about our marriages... concerned about our friendships... anxious about our employees.
Yes, we don't pay attention to evil because we think it will never come to our house.
But it does.
And sometimes... we let it in.

## Episode 20

[Mary Alice Young]: There is a house in the town of Fairview.
Inside this house lives a monster... the kind who kills young women.
You may ask how such a monster came to be, and that's a very good question, indeed.

[Mary Alice Young]: His name was Eddie.
Everyone thought he was harmless... until the day his mother went into his room.
She was just looking for a bottle of scotch... but found the truth instead.
Soon everyone in town would be asking, "how could such a monster come to be?"
Sadly, the answer... would satisfy no one.

[Mary Alice Young]: (Narration setting up flashback for Mary Alice) I met Eddie on a Monday.
He had just turned 4.

[Mary Alice Young]: (Narration setting up flashback for Gabrielle) Gabrielle met Eddie on a Tuesday, the day she moved into the neighborhood.

[Mary Alice Young]: (Narration setting up flashback for Bree) Bree hired Eddie to help out on a Wednesday, and she helped him in return.

[Mary Alice Young]: (Narration setting up flashback for Susan) Susan first noticed Eddie as the boy who sold her coffee.
Then one Thursday, she noticed something more.

[Mary Alice Young]: (Narration setting up flashback for Lynette) It was during a Friday night game of charades that Lynette was clued in to the truth of Eddie's life.

[Mary Alice Young]: There is a house in the town of Fairview.
Inside this house lives a monster... the kind who kills women.
You may wonder how a monster like that came to be.
The answer is simple... monsters are created... by other monsters.

## Episode 21

[Mary Alice Young]: Many years ago, a terrorist fell in love with a woman.
This woman believed in the terrorist and his cause... until an undercover agent showed up, determined to stop them.
The terrorist wanted to attack those he felt were hurting the planet, so he got the woman to help him build a bomb.
But something went wrong, and someone was unexpectedly killed.
The terrorist didn't care.
He said it was unavoidable.
The woman wanted to turn herself in, but she was pregnant.
So the agent convinced her to run away with him, and he'd raise the child as his own.
So they escaped from the terrorist, hoping and praying he would never find them.
Unfortunately... he did.

[Mary Alice Young]: Our mothers tell us to beware of mysterious men.
Don't talk to them in the park.
Don't take their candy.
Don't get into their cars.
And whatever you do... don't let them into the house.
But what do we do when mother has already invited them in?

[Mary Alice Young]: Mysterious men-- they make promises they have no intention of keeping.
They tell lies to get what they want.
They may be more dangerous than they seem.
Yes, our mothers told us we cannot trust the men we don't know.
And those we do know?
Well, we can't always trust them either.

## Episode 22

[Mary Alice Young]: Angie Bolen was having trouble sleeping.
She kept dreaming about her life and the choices she had made.
After all, it was her decision to drop out of college.
It was her idea to join a group of eco-terrorists.
She let herself fall in love... with their charismatic leader.
And she agreed to build him a bomb.
Angie knew her choices had been bad ones.
How else could she have ended up here... with a man she despised?

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, Angie Bolen had made a lot of bad choices in her life.
And she now had no choices left.

[Mary Alice Young]: Detective John Booth was not happy.
You see, someone had been killing women in the town of Fairview, and he hadn't a clue as to who it was.
For months, he had pored over autopsy photos... read psychological profiles... and interviewed witnesses...
But Detective Booth was still no closer to finding the killer.
Until one day...

[Mary Alice Young]: People make choices every day.
And those choices... are what define us.
Some of us choose to be loyal, though we're angry and hurt.
Some of us choose to be brave, though we're frightened out of our minds.
Others choose to strike out when they could have walked away.
But what about those poor people who are trapped by circumstance?
What happens to those who have no choices left?

## Episode 23

[Mary Alice Young]: In those first awful moments, all Lynette Scavo could think of were her children.
She thought of the moment her daughter began to walk... and the day her son won the spelling bee... and that time her twins scared her with a frog.
Yes, this is what Lynette thought about... while a disturbed young man was holding her hostage.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes.
All Lynette could think about were her children... especially the child she was about to give birth to.

[Mary Alice Young]: Teresa Pruitt used to be a nurse.
For 33 years, she worked in the maternity ward at Fairview Memorial Hospital.
She spent her days caring for newborn infants... and looking after brand-new mothers.
It was a job she had loved with all her heart.
But that was many years ago.
Now Teresa Pruitt was back at Fairview Memorial... but this time as a patient... a patient with a secret.

[Mary Alice Young]: As they pulled away, Susan looked out on the street she loved so much... a street where parents could raise their children... where retirees could enjoy their golden years... where good friends could share horrible secrets.
Yes, Susan looked on this street and vowed she would be back...
But as she did so, she didn't notice the car that passed her... a car carrying Wisteria Lane's... newest resident.
