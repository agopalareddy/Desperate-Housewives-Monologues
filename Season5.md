# Season 5

## Episode 1

[Mary Alice Young]: 5 years ago, Susan Delfino gave birth to a son in delivery room A in hospital.
Moments later, Lila Dash gave birth to a daughter in delivery room B.
Around 10 ten the next morning, as the two new mothers were leaving the hospital, they nearly ran into each other.
Of course, they never knew this.
In fact, Susan and Lila would have been surprised to know how often their paths would cross over the years.
They almost met in the local coffee shop and another time at their veterinarian office.
And again in the bleachers of Fairview Flyers.
But despite these close calls, Susan and Lila never met.
Until one Tuesday, when Susan decided to take her husband to a fancy restaurant for their anniversary.
At the same time, Lila decided to take her daughter to buy some ice cream.
That was the night that Susan Delfino and Lila Dash finally ran into each other.
It will happen to all of us eventually.
The moment will come when we ask ourselves... Where did the time go?
How did the children I once cradled... grow up so very quickly?
How did the life I dreamt of... turn into a career I never expected?
And how did that woman I saw each day in the mirror... become someone I don't even recognize?

[Mary Alice Young]: The next morning, Edie Britt decided to announce her return to Wisteria Lane in a way... that was guaranteed... to make a big splash.
*(Narration from mid-episode)*

[Mary Alice Young]: It goes by so quickly.
In a flash, the life we knew is gone forever.
And we're left to ask ourselves... How could he have left me?
When did my beauty start to fade?
Why has my friend changed?
Was I the best mother I could have been?
Of course, there are some people who understand how quickly time passes.
That's why they're so determined to get what they want before it's too late.

## Episode 2

[Mary Alice Young]: All in all, Susan Mayer's boyfriend knew he had a lot going for him.
He was romantic... had a nice smile... and was consistently thoughtful.
Yes, Jackson Braddock had many wonderful attributes.
Sadly... a sense of timing wasn't one of them.
And that is why Jackson Braddock realized he needed better timing... and a longer robe.
If there is one thing everyone in suburbia can appreciate... it's a good neighbor.
You know, the kind that helps with the last bag of groceries... or brings over misplaced mail... or offers to mow your lawn.
Yes, everyone appreciates a good neighbor.
And no one knew this better than Dave Williams, who was determined to be the best neighbor Wisteria Lane had ever seen... assuming, of course, his wife didn't get in the way.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, everyone appreciates a good neighbor... You know, the kind that helps you with the groceries... But doesn't ask, "why is your son so moody?"
The type that delivers misplaced mail but doesn't point out your wife seems discontented...
The sort that offers to mow your lawn... But doesn't mention your husband seems cold.
But if you're not sure the man next door is as nice as he would have you believe... do everything you can to get to know him better.

## Episode 3

[Mary Alice Young]: Benjamin Katz was 6 years old, and there were a lot of things he didn't understand.
He wasn't sure why the woman you call "mommy" isn't always your mother.
Or how the man who was always there for him could suddenly be taken away.
Or why you could go for a ride... and never come back home.
Yes, there were a lot of things Benjamin Katz couldn't understand, and no one seemed in a hurry to explain them.
Yes, Benjamin Katz was only 6 years old, but even he could understand this was going to be... a long weekend.
Any child will tell you that where you find a playground, you will also find... bullies-- young tyrants who bring pain... intimidation... and violence.
What can children do in the face of such torment?
Well, there is one obvious option, but not every child is eager to go running home to mother.

[Mary Alice Young]: Bullies... Any adult will tell you the playground is not the only place to find them.
Everywhere you look, you can find people unconcerned or unaware of the pain they inflict.
It might be a neighbor preying on the suspicions of her friend... or a daughter punishing the choices of her mother.
Or a housewife seeking justice from the man who sold her a car.
Yes... there are bullies everywhere.
And the worst are the ones who take advantage of you without you ever knowing what they've done.

## Episode 4

[Mary Alice Young]: Every year, Ms. Elenora Butters would ask her kindergarten class to draw a picture of their families, which she would then display on "meet the teacher" night.
That's how Ty Richmond's parents saw his depiction of their fighting... and Amy Hines' parents saw her portrayal of their drinking.
And Jason Monte's parents saw his illustration of their hygiene.
You see, Ms. Butters felt it was important for parents to see themselves through their children's eyes.
She knew the experience... could be very educational.
Yes... every year, Ms. Elenora Butters would ask her class to draw a picture of their families, even though she knew the portraits... might not be that flattering.
If you look closely into the faces of your friends, you'll see it.
Right behind their smiles, you will see a certain green-eyed monster, and then you'll understand how envious they are of your well-kept home... your delicious recipes... and your tasteful possessions.
But you'll have to work hard to see the jealousy, because good friends always work hard to hide it.

[Mary Alice Young]: If you look closely into the faces of those around you, you will catch a glimpse of a certain green-eyed monster.
And then you'll see they envy your career... your love life... the time you spend with their child.
How do you deal with such jealousy?
There are many ways.
But the best... is to simply share what you have.

## Episode 5

[Mary Alice Young]: It could have been such a lovely evening.
You see, the idea was to have a surprise birthday party.
People would bring food and gifts and wait in the dark for the guest of honor to arrive.
But it turned out to be a night full of surprises... the kind most people don't care for.
Oh, yes, it could have been such a lovely evening, but this was one party that was over... before it even began.
Moments before she was to leave for the party, Gabrielle Solis was at her mirror, halfheartedly putting the final touches on her lips.
You see, a problem had come to her attention... one she couldn't gloss over.
Earlier that evening, as she waited for her guests to arrive, Susan Mayer took a moment to do her eyebrows.
Of course, she had no way of knowing just how high those eyebrows... would soon be raised.
The last thing Lynette Scavo did before a party was to check for gray hairs.
She had no way of knowing before this evening was over, she would have a few more.
Moments before she was due at her friend's party, Bree Hodge was at the mirror, applying her eyeliner.
It would not be the last time that evening Bree would find herself... drawing a line.
The party was in full swing, and everyone was waiting to surprise the guest of honor.
Little did they know, an even bigger surprise was on its way.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, it was a night filled with surprises.
Some had learned of their husband's plans for the future... others had discovered the truth of their wife's past... some were touched by their husband's secret longings... others were hurt by their lover's quick departure.
But for one resident, the evening had gone as planned, and he now turned his thoughts to his real agenda.
It wouldn't be long now before he destroyed the man who had ruined his life, but he knew he had to move carefully.
After all, he wanted it to be a surprise.

## Episode 6

[Mary Alice Young]: AS A MASSEUR FOR THE FAIRVIEW COUNTRY CLUB, CARLOS SCARL HAD BECOME AN EXPERT ON HOW TO MAKE WOMEN HAPPY.
THAT'S WHY HE ALWAYS HAD SCENTED CANDLES WAITING FOR SUE BRIDGES... NEW AGE MUSIC FOR BETSY DANIEL... AND APPLE SCHNAPPS FOR SHANNON GLENN.
YES, CARLOS HAD MADE A LOT OF WOMEN HAPPY OVER THE YEARS.
BUT ON ONE VERY UNUSUAL WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON... HE MADE MRS. VIRGINIA HILDEBRAND A LITTLE HAPPIER... THAN HE INTENDED.
YES... CARLOS SOLIS WAS AN EXPERT ON HOW TO MAKE WOMEN HAPPY.
AND HE KNEW THE BEST WAY TO KEEP HIS WIFE HAPPY... WAS TO LIE.
THERE ARE DANGEROUS WOMEN IN THIS WORLD-- DEVIOUS PREDATORS WAITING TO STRIKE.
YOU CAN SPOT THEM BY THE LIPSTICK THEY USE, THE SHOES THEY WEAR AND THE PERFUME THEY CHOOSE.
BUT THE EASIEST WAY TO SPOT A DANGEROUS WOMAN IS TO SEE HOW SHE BEHAVES... WITH ANOTHER WOMAN'S HUSBAND.

[Mary Alice Young]: THERE ARE DANGEROUS WOMEN IN THIS WORLD.
SOME ARE LOVERS, BLIND TO THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR ACTIONS.
SOME ARE WIVES ENRAGED BY THE BETRAYAL OF THOSE THEY TRUSTED.
OTHERS ARE PREDATORS, DEVIOUSLY SETTING TRAPS TO GET WHAT THEY WANT.
IF YOU'RE UNLUCKY ENOUGH TO COME UPON ONE OF THESE DANGEROUS CREATURES, THE SAFEST THING TO DO... IS RUN THE OTHER WAY.

## Episode 7

[Mary Alice Young]: THERE WAS A SLIGHT MISUNDERSTANDING IN THE SCAVO HOUSE THAT NIGHT.
YOU SEE, SOMEONE IN THE FAMILY WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH A MARRIED WOMAN, AND LYNETTE SCAVO SUSPECTED HER HUSBAND.
UNFORTUNATELY FOR LYNETTE, SHE WAS WRONG.
AND JUST LIKE THAT, THE SLIGHT MISUNDERSTANDING IN THE SCAVO HOUSE HAD ENDED... AND A HUGE FAMILY CRISIS HAD BEGUN.
DESIRE... IT'S AN EMOTION DESIGNED TO LEAD US ASTRAY, CAUSING US TO BUY THINGS WE CAN'T AFFORD... ENCOURAGING US TO SAMPLE DESSERTS WE DON'T NEED... AND PUSHING US INTO LOVE AFFAIRS WE'RE CLEARLY NOT READY FOR.

[Mary Alice Young]: DESIRE-- IT'S AN EMOTION DESIGNED TO LEAD US ASTRAY, PERSUADING THOSE WHO CRAVE LOVE TO MAKE FOOLISH CHOICES... CAUSING THOSE WHO YEARN FOR FAMILY TO ACT OUT IN ANGER... ALLOWING THOSE WHO ARE LONELY... TO BEHAVE IN RECKLESS WAYS.
AND WHEN THE PURSUIT OF OUR HEART'S DESIRE BECOMES AN OBSESSION, THE BEST WE CAN HOPE FOR IS A CARING FRIEND WILLING TO COME ALONG... AND STOP US.

## Episode 8

[Mary Alice Young]: ONCE A YEAR, THE OWNER OF THE WHITE HORSE BAR WOULD HOST A COMPETITION KNOWN AS THE BATTLE OF THE BANDS.
AND YOUNG MUSICIANS WOULD COME... WITH THEIR DRUMS... AND GUITARS... AND DREAMS OF STARDOM.
THIS YEAR, THOSE YOUNG MUSICIANS WERE JOINED BY A GROUP OF MIDDLE-AGED MEN WHO CAME WITH THEIR STIFF JOINTS... AND HIGH CHOLESTEROL... AND DREAMS OF BEING YOUNG AGAIN, IF ONLY FOR ONE NIGHT.
AND IT WAS... IN WAYS THEY COULD NEVER HAVE KNOWN.

[Mary Alice Young]: THERE WAS A FIRE LAST NIGHT IN FAIRVIEW.
IF YOU OPEN UP YOUR MORNING PAPER, YOU CAN READ ABOUT THOSE WHO SURVIVED... AND THOSE WHO WERE INJURED... THOSE WHO BARELY ESCAPED WITH THEIR LIVES... AND THOSE WHO DIDN'T.
YOU CAN ALSO READ ABOUT A MAN WHO RISKED HIS LIFE TO RESCUE HIS NEIGHBOR.
WHAT YOU WON'T READ ABOUT ARE THE REASONS FOR THIS BRAVERY.
AND THAT'S BECAUSE... NO ONE EVER DOUBTS... A HERO.

## Episode 9

[Mary Alice Young]: SOMETHING AWFUL HAPPENED TO GABRIELLE SOLIS... AND SHE WAS REMINDED OF THIS EVERY TIME SHE LOOKED IN A MIRROR... EVERY TIME SHE GLANCED AT AN OLD PHOTO... AND EVERY TIME SHE WALKED PAST A MAN.
YES, GABRIELLE KNEW SHE HAD LOST HER LOOKS.
BUT SHE TRIED HER BEST TO LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE.
AFTER ALL, WHAT WOMAN NEEDS TO BE BEAUTIFUL... WHEN HER HUSBAND IS BLIND?
YES, GABRIELLE SOLIS KNEW SHE HAD LOST HER BEAUTY.
SHE ALSO KNEW THE TIME HAD COME TO GET IT BACK.
THERE WAS A FIRE IN THE TOWN OF FAIRVIEW, AND THOSE WHO HAD BEEN INJURED CAME TO RECOVER AT FAIRVIEW MEMORIAL HOSPITAL.
BY MORNING, THEIR BURNS HAD BEEN BANDAGED... THEIR BROKEN BONES HAD BEEN SET.
AND THEIR WOUNDS HAD BEGUN HEALING.
YES, EVERYONE WAS WELL ON THEIR WAY TO RECOVERY... EXCEPT FOR THE MAN WHO HAD STARTED THE FIRE.
YOU SEE, HIS SUFFERING WAS JUST BEGINNING.

[Mary Alice Young]: IF YOU WALK THROUGH FAIRVIEW MEMORIAL HOSPITAL, YOU WILL ENCOUNTER ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE DOING THEIR BEST TO RECOVER.
IT MIGHT BE A HUSBAND LICKING HIS WOUNDS AFTER A MARITAL BATTLE... OR TWO PARENTS RALLYING FROM AN ATTACK OF DOUBT.
IT MIGHT BE A WIFE WHO'S BEEN CURED OF LOW SELF-ESTEEM... OR A PAIR OF LOVERS WHO FIND HONESTY TO BE THE BEST MEDICINE.
SADLY, YOU WILL ALSO FIND SOME POOR SOULS AFFLICTED WITH A CONDITION THEY WILL NEVER RECOVER FROM.

## Episode 10

[Mary Alice Young]: ONE MORNING, IT OCCURRED TO LYNETTE SCAVO SHE COULD NOT REMEMBER THE LAST TIME HER FAMILY HAD BREAKFAST TOGETHER.
SO LYNETTE DID WHAT ANY MOTHER WOULD DO IN THAT SITUATION... SHE THREATENED HER FAMILY WITH VIOLENCE.
LYNETTE SCAVO COULDN'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME HER FAMILY HAD BREAKFAST TOGETHER... AND SHE COULDN'T KNOW IT WOULD BE MANY YEARS BEFORE HER FAMILY WOULD HAVE BREAKFAST TOGETHER AGAIN.
IT'S AN AWFUL THING TO LIVE IN THE DARK, UNABLE TO SEE WHAT OTHERS TAKE FOR GRANTED.
BUT SOMETIMES FOR A LUCKY FEW, A FLICKER OF LIGHT PIERCES THAT DARKNESS AND BRINGS WITH IT THE PROMISE OF BETTER DAYS TO COME.

[Mary Alice Young]: IT'S AN AWFUL THING TO LIVE IN DARKNESS, UNABLE TO SEE WHAT OTHERS TAKE FOR GRANTED.
BUT IF WE ARE LUCKY, THE DARKNESS LIFTS AND WE CAN FINALLY SEE THE SECRET SACRIFICES MADE BY OUR WIVES... THE SURPRISING PROGRESS MADE BY OUR MOTHERS... OR THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF OUR OWN ACTIONS.
BUT THERE ARE THOSE WHO PREFER THE DARKNESS, BECAUSE THERE, THEY SEE ONLY WHAT THEY CHOOSE TO SEE.

## Episode 11

[Mary Alice Young]: THERE ARE IMPORTANT EVENTS IN THE HISTORY OF EVERY FAMILY... JOYOUS BIRTHS... TRAGIC DEATHS... SUBLIME WEDDINGS.
BUT THE ONE EVENT EVERY FAMILY DREADS IS THE MOMENT WHEN THEY FINALLY MEET... THE IN-LAWS.
YES, THERE ARE IMPORTANT EVENTS IN THE HISTORY OF EVERY FAMILY.
MEETING THE IN-LAWS IS ONE.
THE MOMENT YOU DECIDE TO HATE THEM IS ANOTHER.
THERE'S A HOME FOR EVERYONE IN SUBURBIA, AND A REALTOR EAGER TO FIND YOU EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT.
WHETHER IT'S SOMETHING WARM AND COZY... OR SOMETHING DIGNIFIED AND ELEGANT... OR PERHAPS SOMETHING AFFORDABLE WITH A PORCH.
YES, EVERYONE WANTS A HOME WITH A LOVELY EXTERIOR, MOSTLY SO THE NEIGHBORS WILL NEVER SUSPECT THE UGLINESS GOING ON INSIDE.

[Mary Alice Young]: EVERYONE NEEDS A LOVELY HOME IN SUBURBIA, MOSTLY SO THE NEIGHBORS WILL NEVER SUSPECT WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE.
BEHIND THESE FRESHLY PAINTED WALLS YOU WILL FIND... PARENTS WRACKED WITH GUILT... WIVES TIRED OF STRUGGLING... LOVERS WHO HAVE BEEN LIED TO...
YES, EVERYBODY NEEDS A LOVELY HOME IN SUBURBIA... IF FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN TO HAVE A PLACE... TO COME HOME TO.

[Mary Alice Young]: No narration found at the end of Episode 12.

## Episode 13

[Mary Alice Young]: Eli Scruggs was the handiest of all handymen.
You could ask any of his customers, and they would tell you, there was nothing he couldn't fix.
Whether it was a broken vase... a leaky pipe... or a shaky banister, Eli always knew how to get the job done.
But sadly, the man who had fixed so many things for the residents of Wisteria Lane was now about to break their hearts.
With that Eli Scruggs climbed his ladder for the very last time.
And once he had finished making his last repair, Eli Scruggs-- quietly, with no fuss-- had a heart attack and died.
And most importantly... without leaving a mess.
It took an hour for someone to finally notice the body laying atop Susan Mayer's roof.
It was less than ten minutes later that the neighbors began arriving, each determined to get a look at the various paramedics and policemen who were all frantically trying to figure out exactly how to bring the body down.
And it took two days for my friends to realize this tragedy had affected them... more than they were willing to admit.

[Mary Alice Young]: Eli Scruggs was buried on a Saturday... and all the people that Eli had helped over the years came to pay their last respects.
But one person was missing-- someone who had changed Eli's life... in a way he never forgot.
Eli Scruggs sat in his truck for almost an hour, devastated that he had done nothing to save me.
He then made a quiet vow to God-- From that moment forward, he would do what he could to help people, to help them fix their lives.
And for the rest of his life, that's exactly what he did.
And somewhere, in a place reserved for the very best of us, Eli Scruggs smiled and said, "thank you."

## Episode 14

[Mary Alice Young]: People don't talk about money in the suburbs... mostly because they don't need to.
The ones who have it let you know with their brand-new clothes... their expensive appliances... and their manicured lawns.
The ones who don't have it let you know with barbecues that need replacing... walls that need painting... and classic cars... that need to be sold.
Yes, people don't talk about money in the suburbs because when they do, other people get angry.
Whenever someone on Wisteria Lane buys a new car, a simple ritual is performed.
But on this day, one of the owner's friends refused to participate in the ritual.
And even more surprisingly, the owner of the car in question didn't seem to notice.

[Mary Alice Young]: There's a lot you can do with money in the suburbs.
You can pay for a night on the town.
You can provide a private school education.
You can purchase a token of affection.
But the one thing you must never do with money is use it as a weapon, because someone... always gets hurt.

## Episode 15

[Mary Alice Young]: It's not hard to spot a mother who works outside the home.
Just look for someone who dresses in a hurry... eats her breakfast while rushing to her car... and applies her makeup as she drives away.
But the surest way to spot a mother who works outside the home?
Just look for a child... who gets sick at the worst possible moment.
Yes, it's not hard to spot a mother who works outside the home.
Just look for a woman who leaves her house every morning feeling incredibly guilty.
It begins just after sundown, after a long day at the office, exhausted people start coming home.
Some are met by faithful pets... some are welcomed with dry martinis.
Others are greeted with dinner on the table.
Then there are those who return from a long day at work... only to discover... unpleasant surprises.

[Mary Alice Young]: It begins just after sunrise.
After a good night's sleep, people leave their homes to go to work.
They do this so they can provide a better life for their families... afford to buy nice things... and have a reason to get up in the morning.
And when their exhausting work is done, people come back home again... and some begin counting the days... till their next vacation.

## Episode 16

[Mary Alice Young]: Everyone who met Orson Hodge knew he believed in being polite.
He greeted his neighbors each day with a sunny...
He opened doors for young women with a gallant...
If he bumped into a stranger on the street... he'd cheerfully say...
And if one of his friends was having a hard time, Orson was the first to say... whether his friend wanted his help or not.
Yes, everyone who met Orson Hodge knew he believed in being polite.
What they didn't know is that he also believed in punishing those who weren't.
The day after Mike Delfino moved in with Katherine Mayfair, she thought it would be nice to share her happiness, so she decided to throw a housewarming party for her friends and neighbors.
But from the moment the first invitation was delivered, her friends began making assumptions about those who had been invited... and about those who hadn't.

[Mary Alice Young]: No narration found at the end of Episode 16.

## Episode 17

[Mary Alice Young]: Gabrielle Solis hated going to funerals for all sorts of reasons-- black was not her color... crying depressed her... and lilies made her sneeze.
Also, Gabrielle despised any event... where she was not the center of attention.
Luckily, at this funeral, that would not be a problem.
Yes, Gabrielle Solis hated going to funerals... mostly because she couldn't pretend to be sad when she wasn't.
You can find them on any sidewalk in any city... people with agendas-- the woman who calls up an old friend because she wants to borrow some cash... the man who takes his boss to lunch because he wants the corner office... the girl who looks after her uncle because she wants to be in the will.
Yes, you can see these people almost everywhere.
Doing what they can to keep their agendas hidden.

[Mary Alice Young]: You can find them almost anywhere-- friendly people with hidden agendas-- the woman who uses her neighbor to get herself a job... the wife who uses her influence to hire a friendly spy... the husband who uses his charm to steal from his friends... and you can be sure the friendliest people of all have agendas that won't ever be discovered... not until... it's too late.

## Episode 18

[Mary Alice Young]: Dave Williams had been planning the murder for years.
And like all the best plans, it was a simple one.
First, he would guide Mike Delfino and Katherine Mayfair to a remote cabin.
The next morning, he'd pretend to be asleep as the two lovers left to go hiking.
Dave would then grab the gun he'd carefully hidden... and start to follow his quarry.
He'd wait until the two had paused for a moment to catch their breaths.
And then he'd pull the trigger... breaking the heart of the man who had killed his wife.
When the rangers arrived, they would mention the reports of illegal hunters in the area.
And Dave would drive Mike back home, all the while enjoying his pain.
Yes, Dave Williams had come up with a very simple plan.
But as he was about to discover... there is nothing simple... about murder.
Life is full of nasty shocks... unpleasant surprises that jolt our systems... and cause our hearts to skip a beat.
And these shocks always occur... when we least expect them.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, life is full of nasty shocks.
And they always seem to occur when we least expect them.
And once our system has been jolted, the question becomes, will we survive?

## Episode 19

[Edie Britt]: So I'm driving my car the other night, and what do you think happens?
I crashed into a utility pole.
Then, to add insult to injury... I was electrocuted.
What can I say?
It was one of those days.
All my neighbors heard it happen, so they quickly left their microwaved burritos... and their expensive jars of moisturizer... and their racy pay-per-view movies...
And they hurried outside, excited to see what all the ruckus was about.
But then, when they saw it was me, this weird thing happened.
For a moment, no one moved or said anything.
They just stared.
And then... all hell broke loose.
Yes, everyone suddenly became very concerned, which was touching, but ultimately pointless.
Moments before the ambulance finally arrived, I heard someone whisper... Susan Mayer... wrong again.
Two seconds later, it happened.
With all of my neighbors surrounding me, I took my last breath.
The good news?
I died just like I lived... as the complete and utter center of attention.
Two days after I kicked the proverbial bucket, my husband asked my neighbors to do me a favor.
You could tell from the looks on their faces it wasn't something they... wanted to do,
But... they agreed to do it anyway.
So the next day, they piled into a car with two thermoses filled with coffee, a basket filled with baked goods and an urn that was filled with... me.

[Edie Britt]: And that is how Wisteria Lane came to be my final resting place.
My ashes were spread over grass I had once walked on... beneath trees that had once given me shade... on top of roses I once admired... and beside fences I once gossiped over.
And after my friends had finished saying good-bye, a wind came along and took what was left of me into the air.
As I looked down on the world, I began to let go of it.
I let go of white picket fences and cars in driveways, coffee cups and vacuum cleaners.
I let go of all those things which seem so ordinary, but when you put them together, they make up a life... a life that really was one of a kind.
I'll tell you something... it's not hard to die when you know you have lived, and I did.
Oh, how I lived.

**Reasoning for Narrator Change:**
The narrator for Episode 19 is Edie Britt. This is evident from the first-person perspective detailing her own death and subsequent events (e.g., "I crashed into a utility pole," "I died just like I lived," "an urn that was filled with... me," "My ashes were spread"). The entire episode is framed from her posthumous viewpoint.

## Episode 20

[Mary Alice Young]: Rose Kemper was a survivor.
You could see that by looking into her eyes.
She had buried one husband, given birth to five children, survived illness, bankruptcy, even the loss of her teeth...
As a result, Rose Kemper was no longer afraid of anything.
Sadly, the man who climbed into her window that night was unaware this...
But Rose was more than happy to explain it to him.
No, Rose Kemper was not afraid of anything...
But the man who had broken into her home... was now very afraid of Rose Kemper.
The fact is everyone does it... sometimes with the help of an overturned cushion... sometimes by means of a large potted plant... other times using the top button of a shirt.
Yes, everyone has something they want to keep hidden from prying eyes... but some people are better at cover-ups than others.

[Mary Alice Young]: The fact is everyone does it.
Everyone tries to cover up what they don't want others to see.
Women hide their need for commitment... men disguise their growing insecurity... wives mask their intense disdain.
How can ordinary people hide the truth of their feelings so successfully?
All it takes is a friendly gesture... and a plan.

## Episode 21

[Mary Alice Young]: On this street, the bargaining begins at sunrise... an old woman offers a paperboy a generous tip if he'll throw the paper onto her porch... a wife tells her husband she'll make his favorite dinner if he'll bring home roses... a man tells his neighbor he'll take in his garbage cans the day she finally mows her lawn.
Yes, on Wisteria Lane, everyone knows how to bargain... absolutely everyone.
Yes, on this street, the negotiating begins at sunrise, and it doesn't end... until someone gets exactly what they want.

[Mary Alice Young]: On this street, the bargaining is finished by sundown... a daughter agrees to go to bed early if her mother lets her dress up in her old gowns... a woman agrees to let her fiancé spend the night... if he'll agree to sleep on the sofa... a man allows his lover to get close as long as they don't discuss the future.
Yes, everyone knows how to bargain on Wisteria Lane... but sometimes... they get more than they bargained for

## Episode 22

[Mary Alice Young]: The lawyer arrived just after sundown.
He checked to make sure no one was watching, then he hurried to the front door... where his client was waiting.
As she poured him the scotch he requested, the client began to wonder exactly how he planned to hide her assets from the husband she was divorcing.
The lawyer suggested some creative accounting.
His client agreed.
He suggested a secret bank account.
She agreed.
He suggested a second set of books.
She agreed.
And then the lawyer looked deep into his client's eyes and made one final suggestion... that she was completely unprepared for.
And with that, the client offered a suggestion of her own... and the lawyer agreed.
Masks... you can find them in any home.
Some are used once a year to scare the neighbors... some are needed for the occasional chore.
Some are applied every other Thursday.
Then there's the kind of mask some men wear every day.
It's a friendly smile designed to hide the most wicked of intentions.

[Mary Alice Young]: Everyone wears some kind of mask, so you must look closely to find the truth that lies beneath.
Some conceal anxiety about growing older.
Some hide fears of financial ruin.
Others cover up a love that continues to linger.
And then there are those who let their masks slip.
If you look to their eyes, you'll see who they really are... and exactly what they're capable of.

## Episode 23

[Mary Alice Young]: The thing you have to understand about Dave Williams is he wanted to be forgiven.
That's why he made the videotape.
Yes, Dave Williams wanted everyone to forgive him... but not until he finished doing... the unforgivable.
After the White Horse nightclub was destroyed by a suspicious fire, one body was left unclaimed.
The detectives on this case referred to him as... "John Doe A-37."
For months, they tried to identify him.
Then one day, they got a call from an impound lot.
It seems a car had been towed from the club parking lot the night of the fire... a car that had been rented... to a Dr. Samuel Heller from Boston, who had been reported missing four months earlier.
The doctor's dental records confirmed their theory.
His receptionist, however, did not.

[Mary Alice Young]: No narration found at the end of Episode 23.

## Episode 24

[Mary Alice Young]: The first thing Lila Dash thought about that fateful morning was her husband Dave.
It occurred to her she should buy him a new tie.
She thought of her husband again that afternoon... and decided she would make him something special for dinner.
That evening, Lila once again thought about her husband... and she asked herself what she had done to deserve someone so wonderful.
But there would be no tomorrows for Lila and Paige Dash... because that was the night they crashed... into Susan and Mike Delfino.
The last thing Lila Dash thought about before she died was her husband Dave.
She wondered what her death would do to him.
Luckily for Lila, she would never know.
There was a wedding recently at Fairview Presbyterian Church.
The minister spoke about the nature of marriage and then said what all ministers say to conclude such matters.
It was then the church bells began to ring, telling brides-to-be everywhere their turn was next.

[Mary Alice Young]: There was a wedding recently at Fairview Presbyterian Church.
The minister spoke about the nature of marriage... the sublime joy of giving birth... the immense pleasure of raising a family... the importance of fidelity... and then he said what all ministers say to conclude such matters...
For a moment, the groom wondered if he was doing the right thing.
That's when the bells began to ring, telling him he had.
