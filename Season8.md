# Season 8

## Episode 1

[Mary Alice Young]: Every hostess knows there's work to be done after the guests leave a party.
And only the best of friends will stay long after the party's over... to help clean up the mess.
They help with the heavy lifting... they work together to lighten the load.
They take on the most unpleasant tasks.
And, of course, there's no task more unpleasant than getting rid of an unwanted guest.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, it's only the best of friends who stay long after the party's over to help clean up the mess... Even when that mess may be bigger than they bargained for.

[Mary Alice Young]: (Mid-episode) It has been said that change doesn't happen overnight, but over the course of a month, it's amazing how much the ground can shift beneath us.
A woman who helped conceal a crime is now sleeping with a detective.
A man who used to look forward to bedtime... is now finding himself dreading it.
A woman who once told her husband everything is now keeping a terrible secret.
And a couple who have decided to separate is now going to great lengths to show that nothing has changed.

[Mary Alice Young]: It's only the best of friends who stay long after the party's over to help clean up... to cleanse the pain of a guilty conscience... to pick up the pieces... of a broken marriage... to sweep away the loneliness of keeping a secret.
Yes... it's good to have friends who help clean up our messes.
But every housewife knows that as soon as one mess is taken care of... another one appears.
And we may find ourselves... right back where we started.

## Episode 2

[Mary Alice Young]: When I was alive, Bree Van De Kamp was one of my closest friends.
Maybe that's because we had so much in common.
Like Bree, I also received a menacing letter... one that threatened to shatter the perfect life I had worked so hard to create.
You see, I had once committed a desperate act of my own.
And despite my best efforts to conceal it, someone found out and was determined to expose me.
I thought about telling my friends.
But I decided not to burden them.
I had hoped that with one final act, I could consign my deeds to history.
But I had forgotten that history... has a way of repeating itself.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, Bree Van De Kamp and I had so much in common.
We shared similar lives.
And now Bree found herself praying that we wouldn't share a similar fate.

[Mary Alice Young]: In the divided world of the suburbs, everyone is looking for a way to connect.
They fend off loneliness with casual conversation.
They share old treasures with a young friend.
They help a neighbor make a difficult move.
But for Carlos and Gaby Solis, the only connection that mattered was the romantic one.
And when it came to maintaining it, Gaby was willing to pull out all the stops.

[Mary Alice Young]: Like Carlos, Susan Delfino was also feeling disconnected.
Her guilt made the world a strange and scary place... where she could be exposed at any moment.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, in the divided world of the suburbs, everyone is looking for some way to make a connection.
Some seek to connect by focusing on a greater good... some by revealing a common history... some by sharing a pain no one else can heal.
Then there are those who once sought to make a connection... that they now want desperately to escape.

## Episode 3

[Mary Alice Young]: Susan Delfino and Carlos Solis had never been the best of friends.
Susan thought Carlos paid too much attention to other people's opinions.
And Carlos thought Susan didn't pay attention at all.
Over the years, they'd never had much to say to one another.
But one night, Susan found herself troubled by thoughts she couldn't share with her spouse.
While two doors down, Carlos was in the same predicament.
And that's how it came to pass that two people who'd never had much to say to one another suddenly found... they had a great deal to talk about.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, Susan and Carlos were starting to pay attention to one another.
But what they didn't realize was that someone else was paying attention, too.

[Mary Alice Young]: Wisteria Lane may look flawless, but that's only because its residents are so good at concealing imperfections.
They know how to make something old look new again... how to make an embarrassing mistake disappear... how to make a poor showing look like a modest victory... and how to make a friend feel better after she's gone through a messy breakup.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, the residents of Wisteria Lane are skilled at the art of concealment.
They know how to cover the evidence of a messy breakup... to compensate for what their children might be missing... and to spare the feelings of a loved one whose taste they may not share.
But for some, the art of concealment comes at too great a cost.
And so they find themselves forced to reveal the truth... even at the risk of facing an uncertain future.

## Episode 4

[Mary Alice Young]: It's often said that children learn their most important lessons outside the classroom.
They learn to find peaceful ways to resolve conflict... to make smart choices about nutrition... to master the art of conversation.
But for Gabrielle Solis, the art of morning drop-off... was something she'd never learned.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, some of our most important lessons are learned outside the classroom.
And when it came to school politics, Gabrielle's education was just beginning.

[Mary Alice Young]: When it came to her separation, Lynette Scavo was determined to do everything by the book.
She made sure her visitation days were evenly divided.
She kept perfect records of her household expenses.
She found healthy ways to relieve her stress.
Yes, Lynette was confident her by-the-book approach was the right one, sadly, not everyone was on the same page.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, we often learn our most important lessons outside the classroom... the painful truth about the state of a relationship... the ugly cost of challenging authority... the sad fact that life's colors aren't always rosy.
Then there are those who refuse to accept these important lessons.
They simply wait for the chance to teach a lesson of their own.

## Episode 5

[Mary Alice Young]: In their 20 years together, Tom and Lynette Scavo had followed a few simple rules... always share the housework... never waste the hot water, and never, ever go to bed angry.
Yes, the rules for being together were simple.
But the rules for being apart... were anything but.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, Tom and Lynette were learning the rules of separation.
And the first rule?
There are no rules.

[Mary Alice Young]: In any group, there are roles that people are destined to play... the perfect homemaker to bring the snacks, the financial wizard to keep the books... and the busybody to share the gossip.
But sometimes the most important role of all goes to someone who's not the slightest bit prepared for it.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, we may think we're all destined to play certain roles.
But sometimes those roles can unexpectedly change.
A nervous student may discover a hidden confidence.
A longtime wife may confront a harsh new reality.
A busy mother may find her attention is needed elsewhere.
And a woman who wanted to do a little bit of good may find herself playing a much bigger role than she intended.

## Episode 6

[Mary Alice Young]: Paranoia... it's the irrational fear that someone is after you... that you're going to be exposed at any moment.
Paranoia can sneak up on you... causing you to stumble at every turn.
And just when you think you're in the clear... and the danger has passed... paranoia reminds you... that no place is truly safe.

[Mary Alice Young]: Paranoia-- it can still scare you to death.

[Mary Alice Young]: Susan Delfino had always been a great student.
That's because she knew how to be the teacher's pet.
Some liked gifts.
Some liked extra credit.
And some just liked her.
But in her new class, Susan would learn that not every teacher... was in the market for a pet.

[Mary Alice Young]: Paranoia... it's the irrational feeling that the whole world is against you.
But it's no longer paranoia when you discover... that someone really is out to get you.

## Episode 7

[Mary Alice Young]: No matter what the circumstances, Bree Van de Kamp always found a way to stay in control.
She curbed her impulses.
She enforced a strict dress code.
She maintained a strong moral center.
Yes, Bree was always in control, so when it came to handling a crisis... it made perfect sense that she was in the driver's seat.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, when it came to a crisis, everyone was happy to have Bree in the driver's seat... even if Bree herself would have preferred to be a passenger.

[Mary Alice Young]: As the mother of five, Lynette Scavo was used to uncomfortable questions.
"Why are you eating Santa's cookies?"
"What happened to my goldfish?"
"Why were you and daddy making funny noises last night?"
Yes, after five children, Lynette thought she'd heard it all, until there was one question... she never saw coming.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, we're all seeking control over something in our lives.
We may want to cover up the remains of a troubling secret... or ease the pain of letting go... or erase the mistakes of our children.
But sometimes the only way we can truly change our lives... is by letting go completely... no matter what the cost.

## Episode 8

[Mary Alice Young]: There is nothing more peaceful than the sounds of Wisteria Lane at night.
Whether it's the murmur of a neighbor's television... the hum of the street lamps... or the songs of the night birds...
Wisteria Lane is so peaceful that even the slightest disturbance... can be very alarming.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, there's nothing more peaceful than a night on Wisteria Lane.
Until someone comes along... and disturbs the peace.

[Mary Alice Young]: In a stressful world, we can all be forgiven for having a few weaknesses.
Some of us are lured by a sweet treat... others, by a sad face.
And still others, by the pull of a great novel.
But Gabrielle Solis was about to discover that some weaknesses... aren't so easy to forgive.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, there comes a time when we must expose our weaknesses... when our secrets can no longer remain private... when our solitude can no longer be denied... when our pain can no longer be ignored.
But sometimes we feel so alone... that a weakness we thought we'd overcome... suddenly becomes too strong to fight.

## Episode 9

[Mary Alice Young]: Whenever Bree Van De Kamp was feeling low... she found solace in the act of baking.
When her first husband passed away, she made coffee cake.
When her second husband went to jail, she made sugar cookies.
And when her teenage daughter got pregnant, she made crème brûlée.
So when Bree's best friends stopped speaking to her, she hoped that her warm cherry scones might thaw their chilly relationship.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, Bree had always taken comfort in baking.
But when baking failed her, she took comfort in something else.

[Mary Alice Young]: In a place as peaceful as Wisteria Lane, the smallest crime can prompt a call to the police... when a neighborhood kid makes a reckless mistake... when children need to be taught a lesson... when the teenagers next door start a band.
Yes, the women of Wisteria Lane were used to calling the police.
What they weren't used to was having the police... call them.

[Mary Alice Young]: Just when my friends needed each other most, they found themselves utterly alone... one with the frantic need to find her husband... one with the consequences of revealing a painful secret... and one with the feeling that she simply no longer belonged.
But for one of my friends, the sense of isolation was so complete... there might be no escaping it.

## Episode 10

[Mary Alice Young]: Bree Van De Kamp had always wanted to live her life with elegance and grace.
That is also how she wanted to die.
Her plan was to pour herself a glass of her favorite Chardonnay, put on her most stylish nightgown and leave behind a note on embossed stationery.
Yes, Bree had everything she needed for an elegant death.
Everything except... privacy.

[Mary Alice Young]: Renee Perry had no idea just how close her friend had come to suicide, and Bree Van De Kamp had no idea just how close she had come to being hit.

[Mary Alice Young]: Keeping secrets is a lonely business.
That's why we all search for someone to confide in-- an ally who will understand... an advisor we can trust... a friend who will never judge.
Of course, not everyone you tell your secrets to... will be happy about it.

[Mary Alice Young]: It's a lonely business keeping secrets.
That's why we all search for someone we can confide in... an ally who will understand.
An advisor we can trust.
A friend who will never judge.
Yes, we all need help hiding the darkest truths of our lives.
Because as soon as you've told one secret... another is likely to appear.

## Episode 11

[Mary Alice Young]: It's always easy to know who our friends are.
They're the ones who tell us when we look ridiculous... or when we're deluding ourselves... or when we've had enough.
But only the best of friends will tell you the truth, even when they know... it will upset you.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, only your friends will tell you the truth.
So when they warn you about someone suspicious, maybe you should listen to them.

[Mary Alice Young]: Susan Delfino was on a mission, and she had planned it down to the last detail.
She brought the proper identification, she mapped out the correct route, and she brought plenty of cash for emergencies.
But the one small detail she hadn't planned... was what to do once she got there.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, good friends are the ones who tell us the truth about ourselves.
Even when the truth might be something we're reluctant to admit... that we still have a great deal to learn... that we sometimes need to ask for help... that we may be overlooking a golden opportunity.
Yes, hearing the truth can often set us on a different path.
But we never know... where that path might take us... or who might be watching.

## Episode 12

[Mary Alice Young]: Bree Van de Kamp had always enjoyed a sterling reputation.
She was known for being kind to strangers and for greeting them with a warm welcome.
She made sure every guest felt comfortable and that no part of her home was off-limits.
She never had the heart to turn anyone away, because no matter how many guests she was hosting or how late she was entertaining, her generosity knew no bounds.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, Bree had always enjoyed a sterling reputation... and she saw no reason that should change.

[Mary Alice Young]: In the life of every housewife, there comes a time for renovation... when an eager child learns a new skill... when a romantic evening becomes an unsightly mess... or when a dinner party comes to an unexpected end.
But sometimes the only thing that needs to be removed... is a memory.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, in the life of every housewife, there comes a time for renovation.
She may be doing away with an unpleasant memory... breaking up a once happy relationship... or making the necessary changes to prepare for a new one.
But no matter how much a housewife may embrace the way her life is changing, the people in her neighborhood may take a different view.

## Episode 13

[Mary Alice Young]: When it came to her divorce, Lynette Scavo was determined to make things go smoothly.
So when Tom was late to pick up the kids, she waited patiently.
When he got something in the mail, she held on to it.
And when he left behind something important, she brought it to him.
Yes, after years of fighting had led her nowhere, Lynette decided to take the high road.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, Lynette had tried hard to take the high road in her divorce... but sometimes, the low road was easier to find.

[Mary Alice Young]: Carlos Solis was used to sitting in a position of power, whether it was behind the wheel of a powerful car... at the head of a power lunch... or at the helm of a powerful company.
But now that Carlos Solis had started a new career, he suddenly found himself in a much humbler place.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, love can bring out the best in us... the confidence to move on... the courage to tell the truth... the strength to keep hoping.
But sometimes what surprises us most isn't what love brings out... but who it brings back.

## Episode 14

[Mary Alice Young]: Renee Perry had waited many months for a proposal, and for many months, she had been disappointed.
There had been cozy evenings by the fire... that didn't go the way she had hoped.
A romantic moment in Wisteria Park... that wasn't so romantic after all.
And a beautiful picnic by a lake... that turned out to be nothing more than a picnic.
So when disappointment struck again... Renee decided to speak up.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, Renee Perry had waited a long time for a proposal... and she wasn't about to let it slip through her fingers.

[Mary Alice Young]: Bree Van De Kamp started every morning by catching up on the latest news, but sometimes the news came from an unexpected source.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, in life, when we see an opportunity, we have to take it, whether it's the hope of winning back the love of our life... a shot at proving our worth... or the chance to show a child the right path.
But sometimes when we answer the call... we have no idea what opportunity awaits us.

## Episode 15

[Mary Alice Young]: Orson Hodge had always known one thing... Bree Van De Kamp was the perfect woman for him.
When he was sick, she nursed him back to health.
When he was arrested, she promised to wait for him.
And when he suffered a terrible injury, she did everything he couldn't.
So now that Bree was suffering, Orson intended to care for her.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, Orson Hodge knew that Bree was the perfect woman for him.
And now that he had her back... he had no intention of letting her go.

[Mary Alice Young]: Lynette Scavo had discovered the silver lining of separation... shared custody.
For three glorious days a week, she had no child demanding her attention... no one to set an example for... and plenty of time to exercise.
But Lynette forgot that when it comes to being a mother, you can run... but you can never hide.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes.
There are times when we all could use a little help.
When our generosity has been repaid with cruelty... when our behavior has filled us with regret... and when our future has become terribly uncertain.
But then there are those who are past the point of help, and in their wake, they leave nothing but destruction.

## Episode 16

[Mary Alice Young]: In our neighborhood, there are people we see every day, and every day, we take them for granted.
As we go about our lives, we may be busy with a mundane task and miss one another completely.
Or we might give a polite wave, only to return to what we were doing.
One minute, we're spending time with a loved one... and the next, we're wrapped up in our work.
Or preoccupied with our own problems.
What a shame these neighbors take each other for granted... because in just a few days... one of these people will be dead.

[Mary Alice Young]: That afternoon, old friends got together to share coffee and gossip and to discover... that they were still old friends after all.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, as much as death takes from us, it also gives.
It teaches us what's truly important... like giving back after a lifetime of taking... going after something we never should have let go of... or looking back on what made us who we are.
But sometimes the lessons learned after a person's death aren't the ones we expected.

## Episode 17

[Mary Alice Young]: Every day on Wisteria Lane, women face their share of problems... like a paperboy who's off the mark... an appliance that's out of whack... or a report card that's below par.
These everyday problems can seem like matters of life and death.

[Mary Alice Young]: But then something truly horrible comes along... and we rush to hold on to what really matters... before it's gone forever.

[Mary Alice Young]: When a loved one dies, certain decisions have to be made.
A coffin must be selected.
A headstone must be picked.
Clothes must be chosen.
Preparing a body for burial is never an easy thing to do... but unearthing one can be even harder.

[Mary Alice Young]: No narration found at the end of Episode 17.

## Episode 18

[Mary Alice Young]: Renee Perry had waited many months for a proposal, and for many months, she had been disappointed.
There had been cozy evenings by the fire... that didn't go the way she had hoped.
A romantic moment in Wisteria Park... that wasn't so romantic after all.
And a beautiful picnic by a lake... that turned out to be nothing more than a picnic.
So when disappointment struck again... Renee decided to speak up.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, Renee Perry had waited a long time for a proposal... and she wasn't about to let it slip through her fingers.

[Mary Alice Young]: Bree Van De Kamp started every morning by catching up on the latest news, but sometimes the news came from an unexpected source.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, in life, when we see an opportunity, we have to take it, whether it's the hope of winning back the love of our life... a shot at proving our worth... or the chance to show a child the right path.
But sometimes when we answer the call... we have no idea what opportunity awaits us.

## Episode 19

[Mary Alice Young]: When it came to throwing a bridal shower, Bree Van De Kamp believed that everything should be done with taste and dignity.
There should be personalized party favors... delicate pastel flowers... elegant refreshments... and she insisted on traditional gifts, even if they received an untraditional response.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, Bree Van De Kamp believed in doing everything with dignity... even in the most undignified of circumstances.

[Mary Alice Young]: Sometimes no matter how much we plan... things don't turn out the way we expect.
A sterling reputation... may become tarnished.
A clear explanation... might get messy.
An ideal arrangement... could fall apart in a flash.
And one person may end up paying the price... for a crime that everyone thought was shared.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, it isn't easy giving up power... admitting that we might need help from friends and neighbors... deciding that a loved one... might know what's best for us.
Giving up our better judgment for a slightly darker agenda.
But for some, the hardest kind of power to give up... is the power to control their own desires.

## Episode 20

[Mary Alice Young]: When it came to her divorce, Lynette Scavo was determined to make things go smoothly.
So when Tom was late to pick up the kids, she waited patiently.
When he got something in the mail, she held on to it.
And when he left behind something important, she brought it to him.
Yes, after years of fighting had led her nowhere, Lynette decided to take the high road.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, Lynette had tried hard to take the high road in her divorce... but sometimes, the low road was easier to find.

[Mary Alice Young]: Carlos Solis was used to sitting in a position of power, whether it was behind the wheel of a powerful car... at the head of a power lunch... or at the helm of a powerful company.
But now that Carlos Solis had started a new career, he suddenly found himself in a much humbler place.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, love can bring out the best in us... the confidence to move on... the courage to tell the truth... the strength to keep hoping.
But sometimes what surprises us most isn't what love brings out... but who it brings back.

## Episode 21

[Mary Alice Young]: Since Bree Van De Kamp was arrested, she had experienced a wide range of emotions.
One moment, she felt afraid.
The next, she was angry.
And through it all, she felt ashamed.
But now that her trial was approaching, she was beginning to feel... a little rattled.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, after Bree Van De Kamp was arrested, she felt a range of emotions.
But the one thing she didn't expect to feel... was jealousy.

[Mary Alice Young]: At the Fairview Childbirth Center, there are certain conversations you expect to hear... discussions about the magic of a changing body... the beauty of natural childbirth.
Or the importance of healthy nutrition.
But Julie Mayer found herself having a conversation... that was rather unexpected.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, recent events in the lives of my friends had stirred up intense emotions... excitement about starting a new chapter... guilt over causing another's pain... disappointment in a failure to change.
Then there are those who are asked to put all emotion aside in order to make a coldhearted decision.

## Episode 22

[Mary Alice Young]: Karen McCluskey had never been sure what her neighbors thought of her.
Did they see her as merely a babysitter... an entertaining source for gossip... or just the mean old lady who lived down the street?
But for the first time in her life, she found herself thinking about such things... because she knew that her life was coming to an end.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, Mrs. McCluskey had wondered what her neighbors thought of her.
She was pleased to discover after all these years, they thought of her as a friend.

[Mary Alice Young]: The town of Fairview had been rocked by scandal.
A housewife had been accused of murder, and her trial was growing more sensational each day.
It truly was all anyone was talking about... which is exactly what another housewife was worried about.

[Mary Alice Young]: This is how it started.
The woman who had lived on the street for years came outside... and introduced herself to the woman who was moving in next door.

[Mary Alice Young]: And just like that, Martha Huber figured out I was hiding something.

[Mary Alice Young]: And my new neighbor made it her mission to find out what my secret was.
And this was the beginning... of the end.

[Mary Alice Young]: It was just after breakfast when Susan Delfino told her friends she'd soon be moving from Wisteria Lane.
They were shocked their old friend was actually leaving... so shocked it took them a moment to notice another old friend had returned.

[Mary Alice Young]: It was a promise made in all sincerity, but sadly, it was not meant to be.

[Mary Alice Young]: Lynette and Tom Scavo left the Lane four weeks later.
They moved to New York, where Lynette learned the joy of being a C.E.O.
She and Tom soon bought a penthouse overlooking Central Park... where, years later, she'd take her six grandchildren and yell at them.

[Mary Alice Young]: Gabrielle and Carlos Solis left the neighborhood the following year.
This was after Carlos helped her develop a personal shopping website, which led to Gabrielle getting her own show on the Home Shopping Network.
They soon bought a mansion in California, where they argued happily ever after.

[Mary Alice Young]: Two years later, Bree and her new husband left Fairview.
They moved to Louisville, where Bree joined a club for conservative women.
Trip then encouraged her to enter into local politics.
The following November, Bree was elected to the Kentucky state legislature.

[Mary Alice Young]: But Susan Delfino was the first to move from Wisteria Lane.
And this is how it ended.
She introduced herself to the woman who was moving in.

[Mary Alice Young]: As Susan left her driveway, she had a feeling she was being watched... and she was.
The ghosts of people who had been a part of Wisteria Lane were gazing upon her as she passed.
They watched her, as they watch everyone, always hoping the living could learn to put aside rage and sorrow, bitterness and regret.
These ghosts watch, wanting people to remember that even the most desperate life... is oh... so wonderful.
But only a lucky few realize the gift they've been given.
Most people just go on day after day, trying in vain... to keep secrets... that will never stay hidden.
