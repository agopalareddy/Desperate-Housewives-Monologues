# Season 1

## Episode 1

[Mary Alice Young]: My name is Mary Alice Young. In this morning's paper, you may come across an article about the unusual day I had last week. Normally, there's never anything newsworthy about my life, but that all changed last Thursday. Of course, everything seemed quite normal at first. I made breakfast for my family. I performed my chores. I completed my projects. I ran my errands. In truth, I spent the day as I spent every other day, quietly polishing the routine of my life until it gleamed with perfection. That's why it was so astonishing when I decided to go to my hallway closet and retrieve a revolver that had never been used. My body was discovered by my neighbor, Mrs. Martha Huber, who'd been startled by a strange popping sound. Her curiosity aroused, Mrs. Huber tried to think of a reason for dropping in on me unannounced. After some initial hesitation, she decided to return the blender she had borrowed from me six months before. And, for a moment, Mrs. Huber stood motionless in her kitchen, grief-stricken by this senseless tragedy. But only for a moment. If there was one thing Mrs. Huber was known for, it was her ability to look on the bright side. I was laid to rest on a Monday. After the funeral, all the residents of Wisteria Lane came to pay their respects. And, as people do in these situations, they brought food. Lynette Scavo brought fried chicken. Lynette had a great family recipe for fried chicken. She didn't cook much while moving up the corporate ladder. She didn't have the time. But when her doctor announced she was pregnant, her husband Tom had an idea. "Why not quit your job?" "Kids do better with stay-at-home moms. It would be so much less stressful." But this was not the case. In fact, Lynette's life had become so hectic. But she didn't have the time. Gabrielle Solis who lives down the block brought a spicy paella. Since her modeling days in New York, Gabrielle had developed a taste for rich food... ...and rich men. Carlos, who worked in mergers and acquisitions, proposed on their third date. Gabrielle was touched when tears welled up in his eyes. But she soon discovered this happened every time Carlos closed a big deal. Gabrielle liked her paella piping hot. However, her relationship with her husband was considerably cooler. Bree Van De Kamp, who lives next door, brought baskets of muffins she baked from scratch. Bree was known for her cooking. And for making her own clothes. And for doing her own gardening. And for re-upholstering her own furniture. Yes, Bree's many talents were known throughout the neighborhood. Everyone on Wisteria Lane thought of Bree as the perfect wife and mother. Everyone, that is, except her own family. Susan Mayer, who lives across the street, brought macaroni and cheese. Her husband, Karl, always teased her about her macaroni, saying it was the only thing she knew how to cook and she rarely made it well. It was too salty the night she and Karl moved into their house. It was too watery the night she found lipstick on Karl's shirt. She burned it the night Karl told her he was leaving her for his secretary. A year had passed since the divorce. Susan had started to think how nice it would be to have a man in her life. Even one who would make fun of her cooking.

[Mary Alice Young]: The next day my friends came together to pack away my clothes, my personal belongings and what was left of my life. How ironic. To have something I tried so desperately to keep secret, treated so casually. I'm so sorry, girls. I never wanted you to be burdened with this.

## Episode 2

[Mary Alice Young]: An odd thing happens when we die. Our senses vanish. Taste, touch, smell and sound become a distant memory. But our sight? Ah, our sight expands. And we can suddenly see the world we've left behind so clearly. Of course, most of what's visible to the dead could also be seen by the living. If they'd only take the time to look. Like my friend Gabrielle. I should've seen how unhappy she was, but I didn't. I only saw her clothes from Paris... ...her platinum jewelry... ...and her brand-new diamond watch. Had I looked closer, I'd have seen that Gabrielle was a drowning woman desperately in search of a life raft. Luckily for her, she found one. Of course, Gabrielle only saw her young gardener as a way to infuse her life with a little excitement. But now she was about to discover just how exciting her life could get. She was quickly reminded that what Carlos couldn't see... ...couldn't hurt her. The peaceful facade of Wisteria Lane had recently been shattered. First, by my suicide. And then by the discovery of a note among my belongings that suggested a suspicious reason for my desperate act. My friends gathered to discuss its implications. It's the age-old question. How much do we want to know about our neighbors? My friends were right to be concerned. They knew that every family has its secrets. And as my son and husband could've told them, you need to think carefully before digging them up.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, as I look back at the world I left behind, it's all so clear to me. The beauty that waits to be unveiled. The mysteries that long to be uncovered. But people so rarely stop to take a look. They just keep moving. It's a shame, really. There's so much to see.

## Episode 3

[Mary Alice Young]: After I died, I began to surrender the parts of myself that were no longer necessary. My desires, beliefs, ambitions, doubts. Every trace of my humanity was discarded. I discovered, when moving through eternity, it helps to travel lightly. In fact, I held on to only one thing. My memory. It's astonishing to look back on the world I left behind. I remember it all. Every single detail. Like my friend, Bree Van De Kamp. I remember the easy confidence of her smile. The gentle elegance of her hands. The refined warmth of her voice. But what I remember most about Bree... ...was the look of fear in her eyes. Bree had started to realize her world was unraveling. And for a woman who despised loose ends, that was unacceptable. If I don't start getting some sleep soon, I'll be forced back upstairs out of sheer exhaustion. Yes, Bree was afraid of many things. But if there was one thing she wasn't afraid of... ...it was a challenge. The day on Wisteria Lane began like any other with a cup of coffee and the morning paper, and while Lynette read the business section, and Gabrielle studied the fall collections, and Bree searched for decorating ideas, Susan scanned the front page and saw something that caught her eye.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, I remember the world, every detail. And what I remember most is how afraid I was. What a waste. You see, to live in fear is not to live at all. I wish I could tell this to those I left behind. But would it do any good? Probably not. I understand now. There will always be those who face their fears. And there will always be those... who run away.

## Episode 4

[Mary Alice Young]: Everyone has a little dirty laundry. When I was alive, I maintained many different identities. Lover, wife and, ultimately, victim. Yes, labels are important to the living. They dictate how people see themselves. Like my friend Lynette. She used to see herself as a career woman, and a hugely successful one. She was known for her power lunches, her eye-catching presentations, and her ruthlessness in wiping out the competition. But Lynette gave up her career to assume a new label. The incredibly satisfying role of full-time mother. But, unfortunately for Lynette, this new label frequently fell short of what was advertised. It suddenly occurred to Lynette, her label was about to change yet again. And for the next few years, she would be known as the mother of the boys who painted Tiffany Axelrod blue. It looked to be an interesting afternoon on Wisteria Lane. A mysterious cassette tape had been discovered by my friend Bree. She had stolen it from her marriage counselor. A counselor I'd once spoken to in strictest confidence.

[Mary Alice Young]: What type of person would send such a note? Was it an enemy? Of course. But what kind? An acquaintance? A stranger? Or how about a neighbor that lives a few feet away?

## Episode 5

[Mary Alice Young]: Every neighborhood has a woman like Alberta Frome. And every woman like Mrs. Frome has a cat. When she traveled, Mrs. Frome would arrange for friends to look after her beloved pet. This time, however, she was forced to ask her neighbor, Susan Mayer. Mrs. Frome liked Susan. But it was common knowledge on Wisteria Lane, where Susan Mayer went, bad luck was sure to follow. Her misfortunes ranged from the commonplace... ...to the unusual... ...to the truly bizarre. As she waved goodbye, she worried that Susan's bad luck would continue. For that matter, so did her cat. Though she didn't know it at the time, Susan's luck... had finally started to change. News that an intruder had breached the security of Wisteria Lane spread like wildfire. At a Neighborhood Watch meeting the next night, residents voiced their concerns whenever she took a shower. Bob Fisk warned those present that a government agency was listening in on their phone conversations. Helen Vale spoke of a ruthless local teenage gang that had egged her minivan. The evening concluded with Officer Thompson offering safety tips and a plan of action. The next day, as residents began to patrol Wisteria Lane in the hopes of foiling potential burglars, Gabrielle was about to experience a home invasion of her own.

[Mary Alice Young]: People by their very nature are always on the lookout for intruders... trying to prevent those on the outside from getting in. But there will always be those who force their way into our lives, just as there will be those we invite in. But the most troubling of all will be the ones who stand on the outside looking in. The ones we never truly get to know.

## Episode 6

[Mary Alice Young]: Suburbia is a battleground, an arena for all forms of domestic combat. Husbands clash with wives, parents cross swords with children. But the bloodiest battles often involve women and their mothers-in-law. The war for control of Carlos began the night he proposed, and Gabrielle had been losing ground to Juanita ever since. From the prenuptial agreement which she reluctantly signed... to the selection of wedding music she despised... to the color of the house paint she hadn't wanted, Gabrielle had suffered one defeat after another. And now that Juanita suspected her daughter-in-law of having an affair, it had become increasingly apparent, in this war... ...no prisoners would be taken. Sadly for Juanita, she had ignored the first rule of war... Never underestimate your enemy. Of the many suburban rituals, none is quite so cherished as the neighborhood yard sale. Shoppers come to sift through the discarded belongings of someone they don't know, in hopes of finding bargains they don't really need, each so determined to save a few pennies they often miss hidden treasures. Susan was infuriated by Paul's evasive answers. She was convinced he was deliberately hiding Zach and hiding the truth. She hoped that finding one would lead to the other. To succeed, Susan would have to be evasive herself.

[Mary Alice Young]: The search for power begins when we're quite young. As children, we're taught that the power of good triumphs over the power of evil. But as we get older, we realize that nothing is ever that simple. Traces of evil always remain.

## Episode 7

[Mary Alice Young]: Competition. It means different things to different people. In suburbia, it means keeping up with the Joneses. On Wisteria Lane, that means keeping up with Bree Van De Kamp. Everyone knew Bree had the nicest lawn in the neighborhood. And no one begrudged her this. No one, that is, except Martha Huber, whose own lawn paled in comparison. No matter how carefully she trimmed, or how lovingly she watered... or how generously she fertilized, the grass was always greener on the other side of the fence. Then one day, Mrs. Huber finally got the chance to mow down the competition. Yes, Mrs. Huber understood the first rule of competition: In order to win, you have to want it more. When I was alive, my friends and I came together once a month for a meeting of the Wisteria Lane Book Club. We found the problems of literary characters so absorbing. The way they dealt with adversity, conducted illicit affairs, endured domestic dramas, and planned romantic conquests. But since my death, my friends had lost their interest in fiction. Their own problems had become absorbing enough.

[Mary Alice Young]: Competition. It means different things to different people. But whether it's a friendly rivalry or a fight to the death... ...the end result is the same. There will be winners... and there will be losers. Of course, the trick is... to know which battles to fight. You see, no victory comes without a price.

## Episode 8

[Mary Alice Young]: There is a widely read book that tells us everyone is a sinner. Of course, not everyone who reads this book feels guilt over the bad things they do. But Bree Van De Kamp did. In fact, Bree had spent most of her life feeling guilty. As a child, she felt guilty about not getting straight As. As a teenager, she felt guilty about letting her boyfriend go to second base. As a newlywed, she felt guilty about taking three weeks to get out her thank-you cards. But she knew the transgressions of her past were nothing compared with the sin she was about to commit. Bree knew what she was about to do was wrong. But like most sinners, she would worry about her guilt tomorrow. Not since my own suicide had violence intruded upon the serenity of life on Wisteria Lane in such a conspicuous fashion. Needless to say, my friends attacked the problem head-on. Lynette brought the broom, Susan brought the trash bags, and Bree brought the industrial strength solvent. Like every city, Fairview had a neighborhood that was less than desirable. It was an accepted fact, anyone who lingered there after midnight was usually up to no good. Rex and Bree Van De Kamp were no exception.

[Mary Alice Young]: There is a widely-read book that tells us everyone is a sinner. Of course, not everyone feels guilt over the bad things they do. In contrast, there are those who assume more than their share of the blame. There are others who soothe their consciences with small acts of kindness. Or by telling themselves their sins were justified. Finally, there are the ones who simply vow to do better next time, and pray for forgiveness. Sometimes, their prayers are answered.

## Episode 9

[Mary Alice Young]: Gabrielle was waiting for her next great idea. Her first great idea came when she was 15, after her stepfather paid her a late-night visit. She bought a bus ticket to New York the very next day. Her next occurred five years later when she decided to seduce a famous fashion photographer. One week later she began her career as a runway model, which soon led to her next great idea, her decision to marry Carlos Solis. Before she knew it, she had jumped off the runway and moved to the suburbs. Her most recent great idea was born out of her boredom with her new life. That's how she came to start an affair with her teenage gardener, which was cut short by a tragic accident. So, once again, Gabrielle was in need of a great idea. It was then that Gabrielle got her next great idea. She decided to throw the first Annual Sacred Heart Charity Fashion Show to raise money for more nursing staff. And that night when she went to bed, Gabrielle slept like a baby. News of the fashion show spread quickly on Wisteria Lane. Though the event was for charity, Gabrielle soon discovered when it came to the latest fashions, women are seldom charitable. No one knew this better than Edie Britt. She understood that treachery never goes out of style. Sadly for Mrs. Huber, this was no longer the case.

[Mary Alice Young]: People are complicated creatures, on the one hand able to perform great acts of charity, on the other, capable of the most underhanded forms of betrayal. It's a constant battle that rages within all of us, between the better angels of our nature and the temptation of our inner demons. And sometimes the only way to ward off the darkness... ...is to shine the light of compassion.

## Episode 10

[Mary Alice Young]: To understand Maisy Gibbons, you first need to know how she spent her afternoons. Her mornings were spent running errands for her husband. Her evenings were spent helping with homework. But her afternoons, well, they were spent in the company of men. Frustrated, misunderstood, lonely men, willing to pay money to feel a little less lonely. And Maisy Gibbons was willing to help them. Every morality play has its cast of characters. There is always an innocent victim, a deceitful villain, a prosecutor who seeks the truth, a magistrate who dispenses justice and a lawyer who charges too much. This morality play was being produced at the Fairview County Courthouse. Its themes were trust and betrayal.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, we're all searching for someone. And if we can't find them, we can only pray they find us.

## Episode 11

[Mary Alice Young]: Edie Britt could never understand why she didn't have any female friends. Of course, she always tried to tell people she didn't need any. But the truth was it bothered Edie that other women didn't seem to like her. Even after moving to Wisteria Lane... Edie couldn't understand why her neighbors kept their distance. And then she met Martha Huber. Within five minutes Mrs. Huber managed to disparage what Edie was wearing. In fact, whenever they got together, Mrs. Huber insulted her. She made fun of everything from Edie's make-up... ...to her taste in men. Yes, Martha Huber could be cruel, offensive and downright mean. But Edie didn't care, because she was the first real friend Edie Britt had ever had. But now Martha Huber was missing. She had vanished without a trace. And Edie was not embarrassed to admit she needed her back. It was in that moment that Edie finally saw the family resemblance. Mrs. Huber was missing. The words echoed down Wisteria Lane until every last resident was aware of her disappearance. By noon, dozens of neighbors had gathered. Some came to volunteer. Some came in sympathy. And some came to learn exactly what the police knew... and what they didn't. By the next morning, everyone on Wisteria Lane was aware of Martha Huber's demise, with no exceptions.

[Mary Alice Young]: We are all searching for someone, that special person who will provide us what's missing in our lives. Someone who can offer companionship. Or assistance. Or security. And sometimes, if we search very hard, we can find someone who provides us... with all three. Yes, we're all searching for someone. And if we can't find them, we can only pray they find us.

## Episode 12

[Mary Alice Young]: Martha Huber waited her whole life for something to happen to her, something exciting. As a child she hoped to be kidnapped by a band of pirates. As a teenager she dreamt of being discovered by a Hollywood talent scout. As a young woman she fantasized a handsome millionaire would sweep her off her feet. But the years had flown by and still nothing exciting had ever happened to Martha Huber. Until the night she was murdered. In those last moments it occurred to her, in addition to being boring, life could also be very cruel. Luckily for Mrs. Huber, death was far more merciful. Officer Jackson couldn't be sure, but for a brief moment, he thought he saw the corpse of Martha Huber smile. Death had come once again to Wisteria Lane. Word of the tragedy would soon spread throughout the neighborhood. But for now people went about their lives as they always did, blissfully unaware.

[Mary Alice Young]: Trust is a fragile thing. Once earned, it affords us tremendous freedom. But once trust is lost, it can be impossible to recover. Of course, the truth is, we never know who we can trust. Those we're closest to can betray us. And total strangers can come to our rescue. In the end, most people decide to trust only themselves. It really is the simplest way to keep from getting burned.

## Episode 13

[Mary Alice Young]: There is a look the parents of well-behaved children give to the parents of the not so well-behaved. It's a look that says "Control your kids". "After all, they're your responsibility". It was easy for Susan to feel smug with a daughter like Julie. She brought home straight As. She was helpful around the house. She was bright, affectionate and considerate of others. To her mother's way of thinking, Julie was the perfect child. Unfortunately, Susan was about to discover that no such creature existed. There is also a look the parents of not-so-well behaved children give to parents like Susan. It says, "Welcome to the club". Suburbia is a place filled with responsible people trying to live responsible lives. Of course, even the most responsible among us has mistakes in their past. Mistakes they'd like to forget. Mistakes that sometimes come back to haunt them. Before Parker Scavo's Little League game had begun... ...a major player was about to be tagged out.

[Mary Alice Young]: Sooner or later the time comes when we all must become responsible adults... ...and learn to give up what we want, so we can choose to do what is right. Of course, a lifetime of responsibility isn't always easy. And as the years go on, it's a burden that can become too heavy for some to bear. But still we try to do what is best. What is good. Not only for ourselves. But for those we love. Yes, sooner or later, we must all become responsible adults. No one knows this better than the young.

## Episode 14

[Mary Alice Young]: Most mothers will tell you their children are a gift from God. Most mothers will also tell you the gifts their children give them are less than heavenly. Lynette had suffered through art work made in kindergarten... ...spice racks made in summer camp... ...and jewelry made at the scout jamboree. On this day... ...Lynette Scavo received a gift every mother dreams of. One she wasn't embarrassed to display. Lynette would cherish the memory of that moment for the rest of her life. The memory of that moment was ruined the very next day. Yes, most mothers will tell you their children are a gift from God. Most mothers will also tell you there are some days when you wish you could return them. It was the day before Valentine's Day and every man on Wisteria Lane was preparing for this most dangerous of holidays. While some purchased romantic cards... ...and some brought home candy and flowers... and some made dinner reservations at fancy restaurants... ...others managed to forget about the day entirely... again. This flurry of activity was lost on the women of Wisteria Lane. They were busy learning a secret about their neighbors. A secret that was positively heartbreaking.

[Mary Alice Young]: It's impossible to grasp just how powerful love is. It can sustain us through trying times... ...or motivate us to make extraordinary sacrifices. It can force decent men to commit the darkest deeds. Or compel ordinary women to search for hidden truths. And long after we're gone, love remains, burned into our memories. We all search for love. But some of us, after we've found it, wish we hadn't.

## Episode 15

[Mary Alice Young]: Bree Van De Kamp believed in old-fashioned values. Things like respect for God, the importance of family, and love of country. In fact, Bree believed so strongly in her values, it was always a shock whenever she was confronted with those who didn't. Yes, Bree believed in old-fashioned values. But she also believed it was better to be safe than sorry. Each new morning in suburbia brings with it a new set of lies. Little white lies, told not to hurt... ...but to make life more pleasant. They tell these lies to protect themselves and their reputations. Of course, every now and then, the day arrives when someone finally decides to tell the truth.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, each new day in suburbia brings with it a new set of lies. The worst are the ones we tell ourselves before we fall asleep. We whisper them in the dark, telling ourselves we're happy. Or, that he's happy. That we can change. Or that he will change his mind. We persuade ourselves we can live with our sins... ...or that we can live without him. Yes, each night before we fall asleep we lie to ourselves, in the desperate, desperate hope, that come morning, it will all be true.

## Episode 16

[Mary Alice Young]: Even in the most respectable of neighborhoods, you can hear the sound of scandal. Some scandals announce themselves with a shout. Some with a whisper. And some with a bang. And once in great while, there comes a scandal so deliciously sordid, its roar drowns out all other noise. Yes, the scandalous arrest of Maisy Gibbons would soon prove to be the shot heard round the world. It is often said that good news travels fast. But as every housewife knows, bad news moves quite a bit faster.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, everyone loves a scandal, no matter how big or small. After all, what could be more entertaining than watching the downfall of the high and mighty? What could be more amusing than the public exposure of hypocritical sinners? Yes, everyone loves a scandal. And if for some reason you're not enjoying the latest one... well, the next one is always around the corner.

## Episode 17

[Mary Alice Young]: In the coma ward at Sacred Heart Hospital, the dreams begin just after midnight. The pitch black of night gives way to vivid images that comfort the dreamer until the morning. Gus, the custodian, dreams of some day winning the lottery and quitting his thankless job. Howard, the security guard, envisions a luxurious retirement in the tropics. Ruth Ann, the night nurse, fantasizes about leaving her husband. But the most vivid dreams of all belong to the patient in Room 312. Yes, Juanita Solis had been dreaming steadily for five months. Sometimes, of the shocking secret she had uncovered. Other times, she dreamt of the accident that had put her in the hospital. But her most common dream was the one in which she finally told her son the truth. And then one night, Juanita Solis decided it was time... ...to wake up. Even though she knew she was about to die, Juanita didn't care. The truth was finally going to come out. Sadly for Juanita, this was one dream that would never come true. We all honor heroes for different reasons. Sometimes for their bravery, sometimes for their daring, sometimes for their goodness. But mostly we honor heroes because, at one point or another, we all dream of being rescued.

[Mary Alice Young]: We all honor heroes for different reasons. Sometimes for their daring. Sometimes for their bravery. Sometimes for their goodness. But mostly, we honor heroes because at one point or another, we all dream of being rescued. Of course, if the right hero doesn't come along, sometimes, we just have to rescue ourselves.

## Episode 18

[Mary Alice Young]: There were many things Gabrielle Solis knew for certain. She knew red was her color. She knew diamonds went with everything. And she knew men were all the same. But the one thing Gabrielle knew above all else, she would never want children. Unfortunately for Gabrielle, her husband Carlos felt differently. Yes, Gabriille Solis knew without a doubt she didn't want to be a mother. But what she couldn't know was just how much her husband wanted to be a father, or that he'd been tampering with her birth control for months. Or that within one week's time... ...she'd be pregnant. Saturdays on Wisteria Lane belong to the children. And while most would spend the day practicing their sports, and riding their bikes, and jumping their ropes, others were no longer engaged in child's play. Indeed, some children were being forced to grow up very quickly.

[Mary Alice Young]: Nothing is forever. And the time comes when we all must say goodbye to the world we knew. Goodbye to everything we had taken for granted. Goodbye to those we thought would never abandon us. And when these changes finally do occur, when the familiar has departed, and the unfamiliar has taken its place, all any of us can really do is to say hello... and welcome.

## Episode 19

[Mary Alice Young]: Every morning, as she went to take out her trash, Lynette Scavo would indulge in a little daydream, the details of which were always the same. One day, her nasty neighbor Karen McCluskey would keel over and die. And her home would be bought by a lovely Swedish family with two adorable twin daughters. The families would form an everlasting friendship, culminating in their daughters marrying her sons at an elaborate wedding the Scavos wouldn't have to pay for. Yes, Lynette enjoyed her little daydream. But Mrs. McCluskey always had a way of pulling her back to reality. For a brief moment, Lynette was presented with an interesting choice of options. And though she knew she'd hate herself in the morning, Lynette chose to do the right thing. Of course, Lynette didn't respond. How could she tell her neighbor that some dreams are just too beautiful to come true? Life is a journey. One that is much better traveled with a companion by our side. But sometimes, we lose our companions along the way. And then the journey becomes unbearable.

[Mary Alice Young]: Yes, life is a journey, one that is much better traveled with a companion by our side. Of course, that companion can be just about anyone. A neighbor on the other side of the street... ...or the man on the other side of the bed. The companion can be a mother with good intentions... ...or a child who's up to no good. Still, despite our best intentions, some of us will lose our companions along the way. And then the journey becomes unbearable. You see, human beings are designed for many things. But loneliness isn't one of them.

## Episode 20

[Mary Alice Young]: Since she was a little girl, Susan Mayer wanted to be a mother in the worst way. And from the first day she brought Julie home from the hospital... She was. Despite her desire to do well by her daughter... ...Susan suffered through countless failures. Of course, it took Susan a few years to realize that even the best of parents make mistakes now and then. But now that Julie was a teenage girl, Susan had started to realize... ...there was no room for error. Yes, Susan had failed many times as a mother. So she took her victories where she found them. Spring comes every year to Wisteria Lane. It's the time when flowers start to bloom. When butterflies emerge from their cocoons. When bees begin to search for nectar. Spring is also the time when a young man's fancy turns to... ...obsession. In that moment, while looking at the pills that had been so obviously tampered with, Gabrielle's nausea was suddenly replaced by an even stronger sensation. Rage.

[Mary Alice Young]: Spring comes every year to Wisteria Lane. But not everyone remembers to stop and smell the flowers. Some are too busy worrying about the future. Or mistakes they've made in the past. Others are preoccupied with not getting caught. Or thinking of ways to catch someone else. Still, there will always be a few who remember to take a moment and appreciate what spring has given them. Just as there will always be those who prefer to sit in the dark, brooding over everything they've lost.

## Episode 21

[Mary Alice Young]: When she was younger, Sophie Bremmer was a hopeless romantic. She was also hopelessly naive, which is how she came to be married four times. The first time to a man who liked to gamble. The second time to a man who liked to drink. The third time to a man who liked other men. And the fourth time to the same man she married the second time. Yes, Sophie was tired of having her heart broken. So she decided she would never get married again. And then one night... ...she had a visitor. Sophie Bremmer was still a hopeless romantic. But she was no longer naive. Marriage is a simple concept. Basically, it's a contract between two people that binds them together for life in the hopes that they can live happily ever after. Sadly, some contracts... are made to be broken.

[Mary Alice Young]: The vow is simple, really. Those who take it promise to stay together for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health. To honor and to cherish. Forsaking all others. Until death do us part. Yes, the vow is simple. Finding someone worthy of such a promise is the hard part. But if we can, that's when we begin to live happily ever after.

## Episode 22

[Mary Alice Young]: Edie Britt's favorite moment of every day was her arrival at the construction site of her new home, because she knew what was about to happen. Her sudden appearance was always sure to generate a few appreciative glances, a few lascivious looks, and some downright ogling. Sadly for Edie, the one man she wanted most to notice her... ...paid her no attention at all. Yes, Edie needed attention to feel good about herself. And she was determined to get it. Yes, Edie Britt needed the attention of men to feel good about herself. And even she was amazed at how far she was willing to go to get it. Mr. And Mrs. Edwin Mullins were finally leaving Wisteria Lane. In the past year, their street had played host to arson, violence, blackmail, and murder. Fearing they too would be infected by this moral decay, the Mullins felt it was time to say goodbye. Strangely enough, none of their neighbors seemed to notice they were moving out.

[Mary Alice Young]: Nothing is forever. And the time comes when we all must say goodbye to the world we knew. Goodbye to everything we had taken for granted. Goodbye to those we thought would never abandon us. And when these changes finally do occur, when the familiar has departed, and the unfamiliar has taken its place, all any of us can really do is to say hello... and welcome.

## Episode 23

[Mary Alice Young]: My name is Mary Alice Young. Before I died, my life was filled with love, laughter, friendship, and sadly, secrets. The secrets had begun 15 years earlier when my name was Angela Forrest, and I was living a life of quiet desperation. I'd feel it every morning as I made breakfast for my husband. And during the errands I ran in the afternoons... even at my work every evening... to me, each day was gray and meaningless. And then one night, suddenly... ...there was color. And we were. We were as happy as any family could be. Until one night three years later... when there was a knock at our door. And I was desperate once again. It was 5:00 in the morning on Wisteria Lane when the phone calls started. Each of them knew something was wrong from that first ring. It's an unwritten rule of suburbia... Don't call the neighbors in the middle of the night unless the news is bad. And so they came, with their uncombed hair and their unmade faces. They came because after all these years... ...they were no longer just neighbors.

[Mary Alice Young]: It's an odd thing to look back on the world, to watch those I left behind, each, in her own way, so brave, so determined, and so very desperate. Desperate to venture out, but afraid of what she'll miss when she goes. Desperate to get everything she wants, even when she's not exactly sure of what that is. Desperate for life to be perfect again, although she realizes it never really was. Desperate for a better future, if she can find a way to escape her past. I not only watch, I cheer them on, these amazing women. I hope so much they'll find what they're looking for. But I know not all of them will. Sadly... that's just not the way life works. Not everyone gets a happy ending.
